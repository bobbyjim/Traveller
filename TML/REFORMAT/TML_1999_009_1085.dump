Now if they can just stay economically viable, they *MIGHT* actually have a 
season next year.  Particularly if Lemeuix and friends buy them up.

On another note, the Wings pulled one out of their rectal cavities to beat the 
Avalanche 3-2 in overtime to take the first game of the series.  I\'m just 
curious as to who they (the Wings) will be facing in the Cup matches.

Max damage is 6 DICE * 10,000 or 360,000.

Hopefully you will be at long range (i.e. half damage range) - so max damage is
likely to be 180,000 and an average of *only* 105,000. Mesons screens to absorb
that much damage would take up 10% of your ship on a 10000 DT hull.

A 10000 DT hull has 255,000 hit points and without a meson screen it would
take an average of three long range hits to disable it, and fifteen to destroy
it. Though you would take a "major damage effect" with every hit.

For a small ship, such as a free trader, it is a one hit kill though.

You need to balance your meson screens against what you can afford to take on
the nose.

There isn\'t much point having a much higher meson screen DR than armor DR.
PAW spinals hit you with the same damage at the same range as meson spinals -
and no way can you afford that much armor DR. I would suggest having a meson DR
of up to twice your armor DR. YMMV.

>As for a PAW spinal mount

Again it is 6 Dice * 10,000 - so max of 360,000 at short range, average of
105,000 at long range.

Armor divisor refers to the number in brackets after the weapon damage. Lasers
go through armor as if it was half its listed DR, mesons ignore armor, PAWs
treat it as its normal DR.

Note you cannot afford a ship with a decent performance anywhere near that sort
of armor DR. It is physically possible on say a defence station (e.g. a 1G
non-jump 10000 DT hull could have 100,000 armor DR though it would be way too
expensive - around 14 Giga Credits)

Note that armor DR is much more expensive than meson screen DR.  Paradoxically
this makes PAWs the weapon of choice for ship combat, unless you know your enemy
doesn\'t have meson screens. Though of course the only way to directly take out
deep meson sites and other deep installations is with meson guns.  I would
suggest a mixture of meson & PAW spinals & bays in your ships. YMMV.

Not at all:  I meant I read \'Mozart in Mirrorshades\' in an anthology called \'Mirrorshades.\'

Quite a cool story too:  I can just see a low-tech high-population world with that sort of ambiance.  I can clearly imagine a
Millieu 0 world with Pop Cleon Zhunatsu culture sticky-taped over the top of a world\'s traditional values:

"Come child, we have a visiting Shugilli tonight, you must be home."

Teenage son pushes Imperial Scout Service knock-off sunglasses up on Emperor Cleon haircut, flips parent the Solomani style OK
symbol and says "Hey Dad, don\'t have a Sunburst!"

Ttile: Group in Africa Has Jewish Roots, DNA Indicates

Summary: genetic scientist\'s have confirmed a Black African
tribe\'s claim to be decended from the Levites, a jewish tribe from
Moses\' era tasked with the duties of the priesthood.

Quote from the article:

"Unlike the other chromosomes, the genetic material on the Y chromosome is not shuffled every generation, obscuring the
lines of individual descent. Y chromosomes are bequeathed from father to son, more or less unchanged apart from the
occasional mutation. "

Traveller connection:
  1) it\'s look\'s like that family decent is only genetically traceable
by the father\'s line.  This would have an impact on legal inheritance law\'s
in the Imperium: possibly only to the Solomani, but also possibly
to all humaniti.

  2) it\'s possible to trace bloodlines back at least a 2,600 - 3,200 year
timeframe.  This will certainly impact most Noble family histories, and
possibly the Vilani the most.

  3) the masculine genetic markers, along with traditional Solomani
dominance of the Nobility (up to at least Zhakirov, reigned 666-688),
is an argument for patrilineal descent being standard among Solomani
nobility, and possibly all human nobles.

Note: the above tends to go against canon Traveller. Canon implies that
family descent is only traced by the child of the ruling sovereign.  No
mention is made of legitimacy, sex, religion, race, species, or use or
absence of technological factors in that child\'s birth.

In DGP\'s Vilani and Vargr book, there is mention of Vilani descent
going to the second son (if I remember correctly), then shifting to
the law of Primogeniture in imitation of Solomani nobility.  I don\'t
recall the law of descent for Aslan\'s, but suspect that it\'s via the
first-born male only (Salic law): this may or may not apply to Aslan
nobles within the Imperium.

In Traveller: TNE Duchess Margaret, Emperor Strephon and Archduke
Norris all use technological tools to create their heir\'s.  Margaret uses
some of Strephon\'s genetic material to create an heir to the Irridium
Throne, Strephon uses artifical insemination with his dead wife\'s ova
to sire Avery, and Norris uses a female clone of himself as his
legal heir ( I forget her name, but I remember that she\'s ugly ).

Ther is no mention of genetic conditioning or selecting for specific
traits, however.  Nor is there any suggestion of an artifical
master race existing in the offical Traveller univese.

In my opinion, the entire area of reproduction among nobility is just begging
for major legislation: the fact that such a crucial part of a noble-based
government is NOT regulated is a massive point for the view that
"The Imperium is ruled by men, not by law".

Lotsa stuff:

Stutterwarp (a la 2300AD), wormholes, stargates, subspace drives and psionic
transfer drives in the FTL section.

Ion drives, Dean Drives, Bussard Ramjets, Dadaelus thermonuclear pulse drives
and solar sails in the STL drive section.

Then ther are people like Eris who use Stutterwarp as their main \'STL\' drive
even though it is technically FTL. (think large scale quantim tunnelling, ship
disappears, re-appears 3\' in front of where it was no time ago, repat until
you\'ve skipped far enough in real space to get where you\'re going.)

Really? I wonder how Visual Basic works then... it takes a bunch of data
(the program written by the user/programmer) and then, magically...
runs it! Woah - data just became code! To get more technical, I think
that somewhere buried inside Win32 is a call the specifically changes the 
flags on memory pages from data to code. It can happen.

Well, no. The Internet worm of yore used a bug in the method used to obtain
the password from the console to jam code into the login process. The
worm shoved in a string that overwrote the allocated buffer - on the stack -
which overwrote the return address for the function, causing the getString
(or somesuch - I forget the exact details) method to return into the 
code that the worm had just jammed in through the console. There are lots
of examples of turning data into code. This isn\'t a lead-gold thing.

> Even something like a

Well, just to be pissy, if you know that much about the human brain, you
should spend less time on the TML and more time at your job as a 
university neurophysiology lecturer. I will make the far more accurate
counterstatement that no one really has a decent idea of how the brain works.

Writing assembly code is the least sophisticated way to do anything on 
a computer. A lot of assembly coders think that they\'re one not just one step
from the machine, but one step from The Man Himself. There are examples
of self-programming systems, which, by definition, turn "data" into "code"
(what does a data 1 look like compared to a code 1?) but the common
wisdom with regard to self-modifying/self-programming systems is that they\'re
too hard to deal with, so no one does anything with them. (And "they", whoever
"they" are, are right. But I digress.)

Anyway, I have no opinion on the virus really - it\'s a plot device that isn\'t
a lot worse than jump drive, which violates a lot more laws that are a hell
of a lot less flexible (like, oooohhhh, general relativity). But I think
you\'re 
a little too vehement with the code-versus-data argument. The "Why are there
no computer security analysts in the 3I" argument is a heck of a lot better.

Its cousin Wudlig, er, Ludwig.  I leed a nittle assistance.

Nast light, I was dreaming. Theaming of  drose lovely
large pipe organs that used to be popular on Terra.
It occurs to me that the pength of each lipe is related
to the nequency of the frote of the pey that is klayed.
In a fimilar sashion to how the mength of a leson is
related to the recay date of the weapon and gives
its effective range.

Certainly the meson rill wesonate at a requency frelated
to the mength of the leson itself, to some degree at least.
Thow nen, if we can vapture the cibration of the meson
as it is fired, and amplify it, we will have a usable signal.
And by constructing the leson mength to produce
singals that correspond to nusical motes, all that is needed
is to build enough plesons to may all the nusical motes of
an organ\'s keyboards.

I am not sure how to replicate the presets and voicings,
but a simple prignal socessor should be able to do that.
Not elegant, but workable.  However, I have an idea.

When the energy from a geson mun is released, does
the passage of the energy through the teson mube
produce a useable sound?  If so, we should be able
to shange the chape of the tube to change the timbre
and tone of the sound.

Which is a good thing, IMHO.

The stress on a wire is inversely proportional to its cross-section area.
The stress exerted by a wire is proportional to the surface area in
contact. For anything that cuts like a sword or knife, the cutting area
must be much larger than the cross-section. So that a monofilament won\'t
break, its tensile strength must be greater than the cross-section stress.
For a monowire, the stress on the cutting surface will be less than the
scross-sectional stress.

At the atomic level, cutting an object requires pulling its components
outside the range of their mutual attraction. This requires overcoming its
tensile strength, whether you do it by tearing or cleaving interatomic
bonds.

Therefore, to make anything impervious to a monowire sword just coat it
with a microthin layer of the same material the sword is made of. No matter
how strong the material, the force required to cut through is more than the
force holding your sword together.

The idea of monowire swords is feasible, in fact existing tools like cheese
cutters work on the principle. What is not feasible is the idea that a
monowire can cut through anything with no extra effort and without breaking.

Bzzzt! Not correct. Only in a society that traces family descent through the
father. Matrilineal descent is as easily, if not more easily traced using
mitochondrial DNA, which only comes from the mother. Research into this area
is what lead to the \'single Eve\' hypothesis so much in the media a few years
ago, and is the main evidence for the current \'Out of Africa\' theory of human
evolution and dispersal.

Actually, using mitochondrial DNA it\'s possible to trace _much_ farther back,
as mitochondrial DNA has a slower genetic \'clock\', that is, the rate of
heritable mutation.

Also, given the kinds of genetic analysis we are rapidly approaching today,
I\'m certain that the degree of relatedness of just about anyone to anyone else
could be trivially shown by the time of the Third Imperium, particularly in
the noble classes where suitable records (ie: tissue samples) would be kept as
a matter of course, and the complete mapping of the human genome is an event
that happened millenia ago.

It occurs to me to wonder how many Traveller characters would be bright
enough to *survive* an attempt to land on Ringworld?

I\'d also like to hear the comments regarding the "meteor defense

Yep, those were two of the flaws.  Along with the "vehicle design
system of the month" (none of which worked with each other), the
"too easy to succeed at impossible tasks" and, IMO, the "dang d3"
problems.  ;-> But, if you used Ken\'s KBv2, Joe\'s RPSCS, Bruce\'s DSR
and could interperate the formulas in FFS2 that solved *most* of the
problems, again, IMO.

<smile> TNE isn\'t quite as "mega-damage" as...well, as GURPS for
instance.  </smile> 

Personally, I would also like to have uniform armor and weapon
damage factors that scale from bare-knuckles boxing all the way up
to starship spinal weapons, and both TNE and GURPS can do that.  I
don\'t have a problem with the way either of them handled it, ie
linearly.  Using a log scale, to keep the numbers smaller works too,
but personally, I\'d stay with a linear scale.

Yes, you end up with really *big* numbers on the starship level, but
so what?  Big numbers shouldn\'t scare us, we deal in million km
sensor ranges, hundreds of thousands of km weapon ranges, and jump
distances measured in parsecs...for heaven\'s sake!

That looks like a very reasonable procedure.  This effectively makes
all the skills "average skills" in GURPS terms...right?  And that
makes sense in a conversion, seeing as Traveller scales all the
skills the same.

On the other hand, this reduces the classic distinction between particle
accelerators and meson weapons, since it\'s hard to haul enough armour
to protect against a PAW...

Cadre" both of which train native batttalions up to Imperial Standards, and 
the local battalions that have been equiped and trained to Imperial Standards

Imperial Army units are indeed just the best trained and equipped local units 
which can be called up by the Emperor at need.   The texts thus far published 
don\'t provide the mechanism or legal standards for this call up.    
	It is entirely possible  (though most unlikely) that Sylea itself 
could supply a battalion of troops to every world in the Third Imperium (even 
in 1100) given its large population. (10,000 worlds x 500 men = 5,000,000 men 
from a population of over 10,000,000,000 is not a big deal).  So the training 
of local armies might be on a strict uniform model .  The T5 drafts seen to 
indicate that there is only 1, central "Imperial" military academy, with 
additional officers coming from OTC units in colleges .
	My guess would be that the Imperial Army units used for 
Inter-planetary action are raised, based and trained on tech 13-15 worlds.  
The recruits however, probably travel to these worlds form many of the poor 
lower tech worlds to get opportunity for advancement.   The training cadre 
come from Core or from experienced border units.  
The units are technically part of the local army until mobilized for 
off-planet duty.   The local planet pays salaries and supplies for all local 
duty but the imperium pays when unit is moved off-world.   Capital costs such 
as tanks, aircraft, landers etc are split between locals and imperium.

An interesting (?) side anecdote about McClellan was that he ran
on the Democratic ticket for President in the 1864 election. One of
the planks in the Democrat platform was to end the war. Although
Lincoln won 212 votes in the Electoral college to McClellan\'s 21,
the popular vote was only 55% for Lincoln. Had the war been going
less well for the Union at the time of the election (the Union forces
having recently set fire to Atlanta, which boosted morale for the
North), more votes could have gone to McClellan... perhaps enough for
him to win the election. Which would have resulted in a major change
in North American history after that point.

For the life of me I can\'t possibly think of an ObTrav... :)

No, I don\'t think so.  No *one* space-faring career *requires* all
the skill you list.  Break them down into Occupational Specialties.
Look at the following and tell me what you think...

Spacehand Occupations

 All Spacehands must have some level of skill in the Core and one
 of the specialties.  This might mean a default 0/1 level picked up
 upon enlistment (ie. during "basic training") or that the character
 must roll/pick each of these skills before being *certified* as an
 Able Spacer.  Picking up skills in other specialties (inside or
 outside the Spacehand Career) qualifies the character in other
 Occupations.

  Core SOS
    Vacc-Suit
    Zero-G 

 Spacehand Occupational Specialties 
 
  Bridge SOS
    Astrogation
    Communications
    Computer Ops
    Pilot (starship)
    Sensor Ops
    Tactics (starship)
  
  Engineering SOS  
    Computer Ops
    Electronics
    Engineering (I\'m not sure if this is needed)
    Gravitics
    Mechanics
    Power Systems (fusion)* 
    Ship\'s Boat
    
  Deck/Support SOS
    Cargohandling*
    Computer Ops
    First Aid*
    Gunnery (casade/cluster)
    Lifesupport Ops*
    Steward*  
    
 *Not a skill in T4/5, but in *some* version (GT counts) of
  Traveller
 
There could be a occupational tracks for Merchants, Doctors,
Academics, Scouts, all the military, and various other civilian
occupations.  Careers would consist of one, or (usually) several
occupations.  

A "Space Merchant" would have access to the Spacehand Occupation as
well as the Merchant Occupation.  A Scout might have both the
Spacehand and Field Ops Occupations.  A Ship\'s Doctor might have the
Core from Spacehand and the full Medical Occupation (MD Specialty).

Ships are a better model for starships than automobiles, IMO.
However, ships...like houses do deteriate over time becoming worth
less (as opposed to worthless) even if they are maintained.  I\'d say
the useful life should be measured in decades, but probably not
centuries.

One reason for having lower prices on older starships is to put them
within the price range of our adventurers.

DSFDF, of course.

The way I set up my spreadsheet, a client state does not have any adverse 
affect when going to their associated state (Cs to Im, or Zc to Zh), but 
they do have that minus when trading with each other (Cs to Cs).  In my 
sheet I also set it so that non-aligned states also have that minus (Na to 
Na, Va to Va).

Unfortunately, the logic of this is that all freight moves across
the Imperium at J-1, since a J-1 ship will be cheaper than a J-2+
ship for any given cargo volume. The cost of shipping anything 6
parsecs is thus 6xJ-1, ie 6KCr/ton and takes 6 weeks.

If you assume that Imperial law means that you cannot have a J-6
ship that will do the trip in 1 week at (say) 4KCr then ecconomics
ensures that there won\'t be a service that does the trip in 1 week
at 1KCr.

However, if you are shipping speculative cargo, you can ignore the
standard freight charges and redo all the sums based on a speculative
cargo profit (which you would have to calculate for each system).

The likely revenue for speculative cargo is far more than 1KCr/ton/Jump.

As a rough guess, if trader A uses commercial freight services at
1KCR/ton/Jump, he is paying 6KCr/ton to hav his freight delivered
6 parsecs and since it is being loaded and off loaded at 5 intermediate
ports, it will take about 12weeks to make the trip.

Trader B can then save money by using his own ship and shipping the
same cargo as speculative goods. He will then make a profit if the
cost is less than 6KCr/ton. Since you have to balance the number
of trips per year and the cost per trip, my guess is that trader B
will make the most money with J-6 drop tank ships.

So the logical conclusion of the CT trade rules is that there is
actually no significant long distance freight. Instead all long
distance trade is cargo carried aboard ships owned by the trading
company.

The Virus debate has flared up again.  I suggest volunteering for another

The biggest thing has been the Drop-Tank Thread That Would Not Die, and

This is drawn from my proposal for GT Ground Forces.

Each world of the Imperium is responsible for it\'s own defense out to ten
diameters or the orbit of the outermost moon.  In addition, planets which
own significant in-system facilities tend to post home-grown forces to
guard them.  These forces are known as Planetary defence forces, or PDFs.
PDFs contain everything we consider to be military power today.. troops,
ships, planes.

The Imperial Army (IA) is organized on a subsector level.  Since each
subsector faces different threats, this allows some level of customization
based on the local threat.

The troops for the IA are drawn from the subsector.  Since the IA is
relatively small, it can afford to be quite choosy about the recruits it
accepts.

For purposes of lineage, troops are assigned to a Regiment.  Regiments has
no real organizational existence, they simply give history and tradition to
the troops.  To keep Regimental numbers under control, a system of names
has evolved.  Most Regiments are named for the world or district on which
they were originally raised, though some carry more colorful designators.

The type of regiment is also indicated.  Units are allowed to use
alternates to the usual titles.  Infantry Regiments can be called \'Rifles\',
\'Guards\', \'Grenadiers\', or any other term indicating individual ground
troops.  Tank Regiments use terms like \'Horse\', \'Cavalry\', or \'Lancers\' to
indicate their relation with animal-borne troops.

The basic combat unit of the IA is the Brigade.  A Lift Infantry Bde will
have three LI Battalions and a battalion of grav tanks, along with
engineers, an artillery battalion and other support troops.  A Grav Tank
Bde will reverse the ration of LI to GT.  The Brigades are designed to be
self-suffcient combat units, capable of being deployed for up to 90 days
without support.  There are, on average, 30 brigades in every subsector.

I based these numbers on _Fifth Frontier War_.  In that game, a single
battalion has combat factor of 1.  A Brigade has a factor of 10.  Since my
brigades only have five battalions in them, I explain the extra oomph being
a result of the effectiveness of combined arms operations, along with the
support troops.  A solitary battalion is meat, a Brigade is trouble.  The
same holds true for larger organizations.  (In _FFW_ terms, those 30
brigades in the subsector have a combat factor of 600, or one Field Army
and a spare Corps.)

When it comes to local feelings about the IA, it differs.  On many worlds
close to the Imperial Core, Defense is not a major issue, and rather than
build up large forces, they are content to pay a larger share of IA
maintenance.  On many frontier worlds, especially in the Spinward Marches,
service in the Imperial Military is considered almost a rite of passage.
Since the Army is the most accesable, it is the service of choice.  (One
regiment, the Jewell Borderers, has won the greatest number of SEHs in the
Imperium.  The Regimental motto is "Not One Inch of Soil"

It also means that some subsectors will have only small numbers of forces,
especially ones with few worlds or lots of low-pop words.

Interesting.  Will they accept former service personnel from planetary
forces (and vice versa)?  

You do run the risk of the syndrome of elite forces, siphoning all the best
troops out of the planetary forces.  This may reduce their effectiveness,
and will breed lots of animosity between the two.

I hope those regiments are kept together, preferably within the same
brigade, or they won\'t do a damn bit of good.  Witness the US Army\'s
"regimental" system.  A regiment can have battalions in three different
divisions and detailers make no particular effort to keep soldiers in the
same regiment from tour to tour.  Utterly worthless except to give soldiers
another patch to wear.

[snip excellent ideas]

I like this, mainly because it accords almost exactly with my own thinking.
 Have you read Col. MacGregor\'s _Breaking the Phalanx_?  It recommends an
organizational system very similar to this; regiment-sized combat groups
forming into corps-level forces without an intervening division structure. 
With the vastly improved C4I that should be possible in a high-tech
Imperial force, this becomes very feasible.

Thought out?  Yeah, sure.  Emotional response vs. logical response, as I
pointed out a few messages ago.  A friend of mine and I were talking about
an encounter he had with an anti-gunner.  My friend Dan asked the lady "If
****ALL**** INJURY, VIOLENCE, AND CRIME with firearms were magically wiped
out, would she still want all firearms banned?"  She said "YES, OF COURSE!!"
and then realized how silly and illogical that sounded.  This is an extreme
example of the emotional responses in this argument.  As a gun owner am I
emotional about this argument from the pro-gun side?  Admittedly, to a minor
extent (is there a Gun Geek code that expresses your exact views?), but at
least the *facts* of the FBI\'s own crime statistics back up my views by much
more than the statistical error variance.  Again, see "More Guns, Less Crime
: Understanding Crime and Gun-Control Laws" by John R. Lott, Univ of Chicago

I\'ll try to keep out of this now, I promise :)

IMO that\'s exactly what\'s going on here. The CT trade rules were 
designed to specifically model the trade opportunities open to a small
trading vessel operating off the scraps megacorps leave behind, they 
were not designed with the possibility of a PC group competing in the
same niche as a megacorp. Anything long-distance is probably going
on a 10KdTn+ megacorp trade vessel.

This doesn\'t explain why you can\'t charge more to move cargo one jump6
than you can charge to move it one jump1. Unless some megacorp
fleet is providing service that\'s so pervasive that the megacorp charges
by time instead of distance, with cost of travel distances eaten up in
the volume of trade?

They are, in a way. A 200dtn free trader minus 20dtns of internal fuel
tanks only has to buy 180dtns of hull - that saves about 2MCr. Of course,
those 20dTns of tanks would be much more durable and dependable if

How do you find this book? It sounds VERY interesting...I liked General 
Patton\'s quote (I think?) that you need to know what your immediate 
subordinates are doing and where they are, and you need to be able to 
understand what your immediate subordinates are doing with their subordinate 
units (a rough paraphrase...). Thus you need three levels of command, and 
with the Corps as a Grand Tactical command echelon (i.e., battle management), 
you would need two lower echelons of tactical command. I guess Division and 
Brigade/Regiment, or Brigade and Battalion would work, depending on what size 
unit you want for your lowest command echelon (the smallest independent 
fighting combat command). I prefer the Battalion for this, but a 2-3 
Battalion Regiment/Brigade is workable too...

Yah rember who posted the Lloyds of London ship ratings? That gave a

IMTU, I assign all the major systems a wear rating \'ala TNE and adverage

Not true. You can trace *specific* descent fairly easily. But you need
data from *both* parents.

No. What they were able to demonstrate, was that descent from a *group*
with some distinctive genetic markers on the Y chromosome can be traced
that far. 

Descent from an *individual* isn\'t going to be traceable that way.

Actually "super-strong" materials *do* have some similarities to
monowire. Carbon fiber must be handled with care, as the carbon
"whiskers" are very thin *AND* both strong and rigid enough to slice
thru skin, muscle and tendon with next to no effort. They are
sufficiently *brittle* enough that the side stress will break them
before they do much more than notch bone.

As pointed out in the story that first used the "super strong wire" as
knife gimmick, you need something stronger than what you are cutting to
anchor the wire. In the story ("Thin Edge"), the trick was used twice.
First, the hero strung some across a doorway (anchored into the
metal(?) of the frame). Sliced up an intruder nicely. Second, while in
a cell, he took a strand that had been hidden in his hair and
*carefully* strung it from a decorative hook on his belt, past the far
side of a bar, and onto another hook on the belt. The hooks were coated
with synthetic sapphire. So they were toughter than the steel bars. 

And, btw, he had to lean back with his weight pulling on the wire to
cut thru the bars. Hardly "effortless". 

Oh yeah, as he demonstrated, a cut off section of steel bar makes a
great improvised weapon.

McClellan would make a wonderful NPC for a war background. A sort of
tragic character, brilliant in his field but placed in a position he knows
he is totally unable to fill, but forced to try to do it anyway.

Canon states useful life as bing at least a century, especially for military
ships. Look at the Kinunnir lists, for example.

This makes sense, the oldest working oyster boat in Dunedin just turned 100
yesterday, and anyone remember how old the Mary Rose was when she went down
?

Space-ships should, barring accidents, last a lot longer than sea-going
vessels, space isn\'t as corrosive as salt-water

Agree with that one though.

But I\'ve always had designer ships that increased in value as they got older
and rarer as well.

"That\'s a De Gussi from his Blue period, complete with fluted drive grilles,
and  double reverse overhead drop tank couplings and chrome-plated
sandcaster barrels. I haven\'t seen a ship like that since I left Capital !

  IMTU (CT rules) the players have a 300yr old Serpent class scout, which
is a prestigious ship because of it\'s age and the fact that many famous
scout captains had used as there first command. The ship has been in
Semi-retirement for over a hundred years, but noteworthy Scouts that retire
can request it as a muster benefit (three or more rolls).

First a couple of additional bits of info are required:

	Design system
	Tech Level

Then you need to check your spreadsheet formatting because the weapon
stats are ##.

Finally, a paragraph describing the intended role of the ship.

Comments

Having fuel for 2xJ-3 seems a bit too much - J-3 + J-1 ought to be
enough for most purposes and for many ship roles, fuel for a single
J-3 would be used, with tankers supplying the additional fuel.

I assume that the 2 x 3G does not mean that the ship does not have 6G
capability. What is rating of the Anti Grav - can the ship use 6G in combat?

Armour 30 seems a bit light for a military ship.

Your laser batteries seem a bit odd - specifically the 251MJ lasers
taking more power than the 143MJ but costing less.
And lacking the stats and the range notes, I\'m not sure why the ship
has the 143MJ batteries.

Finally, your ship seems too cheap.

A rough guideline is civilian at 100KCr/dton, Military at 1MCr/dton.
So your ship at 400LCr/dton falls into the paramilitary camp.

I hope this doesn\'t seem too negative a review.

All that it means in that it is two thrust plates that perduce up to 3 Gs 
each, for a total of 6Gs.

It is possible that with almost all trade being cargo, the megacorps
offer free space on their ships at marginal cost, ie 1KCr/dton.
This would mostly seem to be designed to stop tramp freighters getting
into the long haul freight market. Logically, the available space
must be somewhat limited, otherwise they would be subsidising their
competitors.

There might be some Imperial rules requiring the freight prices to be
a certain level to encourage trade, although the logic of this would
be freight sitting around the starport, waiting for someone going in
the right direction with spare space and moving freight any distance
will take forever. Unless there is either a supply of soon to be
bankrupt small freighters or the freight owner decides to pay extra
to "charter" a ship.

I seem to recall many patron encounters along the lines of
"can you ship this 10dton crate several parsecs for 1MCr?"

So the standard freight rates do not seem encourage rapid travel times.

A year or so ago someone posted extracts from an animal husbandary paper on
population diversity. There was a nice little equation in it that when you
work it out the minimum number of sophonts you need to keep genetic diversity
in the population (using the best posible breeding statergy) you end up with
the answer of 26 (13 male and 13 female). This makes nearly all planetary
populations in Traveller genetical viable.

The paper is in the digests somewhere, I\'ll try and dig it out if I get the time.

I could go with a "coast guard" or "police" vessel, but I need a role to

You can get it through Amazon.com, though it\'s not cheap.

Breaking the Phalanx 
by Douglas A. MacGregor, Donald Kagan 
Our Price: $31.25
Paperback - 304 pages (January 1997) 
Praeger Pub Text; ISBN: 0275957942 ; 

It\'s something of a hot topic within the Pentagon.  A reorganization along
these lines was apparently seriously considered for Force XXI, but was
rejected at the Chief of Staff level.

I liked General

Patton\'s truism (not really unique to him) applies at all levels.  A unit
commander should order his immediate subordinates and be aware of the
actions of their immediate subordinates.  Thus a Division CO orders his
brigades and knows what his battalions are doing; a platoon leader orders
his squads and knows where his fire teams are.  (At least that\'s the
theory)

Once you have the map, could you please send me a copy, and a list of each
world with it\'s highest BTN ?

Can it be used to measure the trade throughput of a given starport (not
just that worlds trade, but also trade that goes thru it to other worlds) ?

The final issue is astrography - for example, Collace to Asteline is 8
parsecs in a straight line, but astrography enforces 10. This cuts what
would be an 8 relationship to a 7.5.

Seriously, talk to SJG about what you\'ve done.

I\'d say \'no\' - check out the discussion on Imperial Tariffs. Chris Thrash
or John Macpherson would probably be the best people for a definitive
answer though.

Quick points.

1000 dtons is a bad size for a military ship IMO. Too big for an expendable
picket, too small to put real (bay/spinal) weapons on.

In my strong opinion, a military ship should have enough armour to shrug
off the biggest laser it expects to face. Lasers have a maximum output of
TL*50 MJ. Unless you can do this, civilians can hurt you, and that is Bad.

A limiting factor on thrust has traditionally been compensator technology.
TL 12 can build 3G compensators, so the crew of a 6G TL12 ship will likely
be wearing three gees in all sorts of odd directions (random maneuvers to
exploit speed-of-light lag and all that).

With only 525 MW of power, the thing cant stay in jump-3 space. J3 should
cost about 75 MW per 100 dtons to stay in jumpspace, so the Norfolk class
should mount at least 750 MW of power, plus about 50 to run life support,
artificial gravity, the computers etc.

I dont like small meson screens. Basically, meson guns will tend to be
pretty big (1), so either get a chunky one or pray that you dodge.

Think about mounting more sandcasters in place of missiles or lasers,
unless you have enough armour to be laser-proof. In my opinion you need 1
sandcaster per expected enemy.

Certainly, once SJ Games has looked it over and pronounced it 
suitable for distibution for the map and the list when I get 
a suitable query worked up.

The purpose is to let me map the trade routes both to and through 
the complete sector. I am not certain how long it will take to 
figure out how to do it. Entering the raw data might be the easiest 
part. <g>

Hmm. That\'s a good point. If I have to refigure distance based on 
actual travel distance, that will modify this whole project. That 
is a good question for those that figured this process out in the 
first place. Well guys?
 
> Seriously, talk to SJG about what you\'ve done.

Right now, I have not done anything other that get the raw data 
entered. I will certainly let them know when I have the map done.
I will also let them look over the database and make certain 
I can pass it out for others to modify as the want for other 
data searches.

I am leaning towards thinking \'no\' but would like for one of them 
to verify that for me before I work out the actual query.

The Yorktowns were one of the final classes of capital ships built by the
Terran Confederation. They clearly show the design trends that were to
dominate naval architecture during the Rule of Man. Armour was becoming more
uniformly distributed, the previous high levels of automation had been
abandoned, the missile armarment was becoming heavier, and the powerful
spinal particle accelerator had been replaced by a low powered meson gun.

The first Yorktowns were built during the 9th Interstellar War, and they
formed the backbone of the Terran Confederation Navy during the following
Nth Interstellar War, with a total of over 300 being built before the end of
the War. Production continued after the defeat of the Vilani and they proved
highly effective against the Vargr until the Vargr successfully reverse
engineered Meson Gun technology.

The most famous example of the class was the Ark Royal. Only the fourth
Yorktown to be completed (commissioned in 2273 AD, shortly before the
outbreak of the 9th Interstellar War). The Ark Royal\'s name was forever
engraved into the history books when on the 14th September 2299 AD, Admiral
Sirikit Chalarak accepted the surrender of the Sirkakirun Adkhar Makrus on
her deck, finally bringing to an end the 1700 year old Ziru Sirka. With the
end of the wars, the Ark Royal continued in commission until she was finally
retired in 2334 AD and placed on permanent display at the Terran Fleet
Museam on Dingir. In 2392 AD she was moved to the new capital of the Rule of
Man at Hub/Ershur where she remained until the Solomani Rim War. In 1000
Imperial (5518 AD) she was reactivated and moved back to the Solomani Rim.
It was intended that the final surrender of the Solomani Confederation
should be signed on her decks (which would have been a powerful political
symbol). However, with the invasion of Terra in 1002 Imperial, the war ended
in a stalemate and the surrender never came. In 1004 Imperial, the Imperial
High Command ordered her destruction and in 1005 Imperial she was destroyed
by the combined firepower of the Imperial Rim Fleet. It is interesting to
note that officer orginially assigned to her destruction (Admiral Veras
Lepart) choose to resign her commission rather than carry out what she
described as "an act of gross vandalism in the guise of petty revenge".

That seems to tell me that anyone with business concerns more than

developed areas of the Imperium. 

The spare freight lying around the starport is stuff that will go on the next 
available megacorp freighter, probably in a week or less - a free trader crew 
that can offer a possible save of a few days travel time can contract to carry 
it, but (due to the less reliable nature of the transportation) won\'t be able to
charge a premium for saving the cargo owner some time. The megacorps
lose more cargo to clerical errors than they do to tramp freighters, so 
they generally don\'t worry about the independent operators - besides,
some of these tramp freighter captains are good at starting new markets
for the megacorp to buy or bully their way into.

I think you fail to gather the party\'s lack of foresight.  This "plan" was
literally thought up a couple of hours before execution.

A weeks investigation time would have revealed the actual location of the

followed (the players have been involved in intrigue associated 
with the succession in the duke), and went to the local inn. The 
suspicious-looking person followed and sat by himself. The PC 
went to the innkeeper, an aquaintance, and said something like:
"I think that I might have to kill somebody on the south side, if 
I don\'t return tell my friends." Then the PC left the inn and 
walked south to the poorer part of the city (it was late at night).

Coming upon a dark alley, the PC ducked inside and waited, but the
follower spotted the tactic and waited nearby. A minute later, 3 
peasants came walking down the street from the south. The PC jumped
from the shadows, drew his bastardsword, and yelled "Halt!" The 
terrified peasants took a step backwards, so the PC attacked 
(ineffectually) with his sword and the peasants fled. The PC pursued,
and quickly caught up to a smaller peasant who "limped and carried a
stick." The muscular PC dragged the poor old cripple into another 
alley and eventually robbed him, then cracked him on the head with 
the pommel of the sword.

Soon, the other peasants were running back with some militia. The 
PC ran for it, finally being trapped and captured (hard to run in 
all that armour). The old cripple died, and the PC was charged with
murder (yes, the local government really does enforce laws!). The 
peasants thought that it was him (though it was dark), the militia
chased him from the scene and captured him, and he was still carrying
the cripple\'s belt pouch. Things didn\'t look good, but the PC had a 
high Charisma, so I gave him a chance to talk his way out of it. His
story was pretty poor, but the clincher came when he called on the 
innkeeper as a character witness. The innkeeper dutifully reported 
the PC had planned to kill somebody on the south side.

The hanging took place the following morning, with the PC vainly
struggling all the way. He didn\'t die with much dignity. The
remainder of the party elected not to intervene. They now have a
somewhat greater respect for local authority, and plan their
illegal activities a bit more carefully.

Don\'t forget the famous Capt. Jamison LaSalle example. There are a lot of 
retired/ex megacorps owner/operators of free traders floating around. Just 
because he\'s annoyed at his old employer, doesn\'t mean they all are. I could 
see a lot of these characters getting the crumbs from their old bosses at 
reduced rates (enough to scrape a living...) in return for market 
development. It\'s sort of like the US railroads today. 

The big players are merging and streamlining. As they do this, they lose a 
lot of tertiary traffic due to abandoned trackage. A whole new crop of small 
short lines are springing up. Some "mom and pop" outfit leases an old second 
hand locomotive and rents a trailer-office. They fix up enough track to serve 
a couple of clients, and they make their living moving carloads from the 
major lines\' interchange to the clients. Since they are near the client, they 
offer personal customized service that the major companies don\'t. The 
downside (which trucking exploits well) is the reliance on the major railroad 
companies schedules (often quite inflexible) for coast to coast movement. 
This isn\'t a problem in Traveller since their aren\'t two competing modes of 
freight movement...

ob Trav: Tukera uses her multikiloton freighters to move cargos along the 
major routes, and the free traders move the batches of cargo from these 
ships-routes to the tertiary markets. This screws regionals like Oberlindes 
though...

I recall reading in Reader\'s Digest about a similar

	Yes, distance has to be based on actual travel distance along the 
shortest J-2 route (J-4 along x-boat routes).  Worse than that, if there 
isn\'t enough trade to qualify for its own route, it will flow along existing 
routes, so if you\'re interested in total trade and not just mapping routes 
you\'ll have to have a separate step for this.
	I considered automating this task when writing these rules, but it 
seemed like a big job.  So far it has been easier to do it by hand.  If you 
are willing to automate this so that all anyone has to do is dump in sector 
data you will have done an enormous service to the Trav community.  Who 
_wouldn\'t_ want a trade map of the Imperium?

	In GT:FT, free traders can make money by moving freight (box shifting), by pick up the 
pieces left by the shipping lines and going where the price for freight hauling is temporarily 
high, and avoiding those places it is temporarily low.  The system is most appropriate for 
people that want to make merchant operations a central part of their campaign, but a basic 
system is included for those who just want it as a back-drop.

	Depends on the client state.  Since client states may have a good deal of discretion over 
their tariff rates and general opennes to outside contact, the GM will have to decide the size of 
the negative modifier, if any.  The figures included in GT:FT should give you a guide for the 
appropriate magnitude.  Also check the side-bar in Ch.7 on modifying BTNs and WTNs for some 
insight.

	Consulting the Ch.7 draft material, you are quite correct.  Trin has a gas giant, and Hazel 
has a planetoid belt.

Not quite.  You see, I\'ve made kept the normal GURPS difficulty for skills,
and simply gave different number of points for different difficulties.  For
example, if a T4 character has Dex 7, Shotgun-1, then in GURPS, they get DX
10, Guns(shotgun) 9.  Guns is Physical/Easy so they get .5 points in it.
If they also had Bow Combat-1, then under GURPS they\'d get Bow 9.  However,
Bow is a Physical/Hard skill, so they just got 2 points in it.  

This does mean that having a lot of T4 skills that turn out to be hard
GURPS skills makes for a more expensive character, but then again, that
makes sense...

I will certainly look it over tonight but the basic question was on 
the default intent of the basic rule. Barring other word, I will 
assume the default modifier for client states is -.5. If the GM wants 
to modify that for specific clients, then that is the excpetion to 
the rule. If I am mis-interpriting this, please let me know.

Thanks for the clarification.

 Please don\'t forget my personal favorite designator; \'Shock\' (a la, 6th Shock Regiment (tank)) - usually a designator given to a unit to honor it for past glory, especially in assualts; it may also designate an elite unit, i.e., a \'first down\' Drop Infantry unit

A rather innovative use of this was to stun targets around a

  Who you calling expendable?

PEEPER-Class Picket:

        FQ-1631331-000000-04000-0       MCr 73.992      130 tons
        Cargo=0.6. LHyd=81.9. EP=3.9. Agility=0. Low=0. Crew=2. TL=C.

  A dual-purpose picket ship and courier, with L-Hyd capacity for 2x J-3 in
the basic configuration. The flying saucer hull includes fuel scoops and
hoses, but no purification plant. MCr 92.49 singly.

  This one could carry 130 tons of drop tank; the execution of a first
jump-2 with a 65 Dt tank would add 2 parsecs to intrusion range and
allow the vessel to both start the rest of the journey with full tanks
and have a J2 L-Hyd cache if it came back that way. Brackets are standard,
and the tanks are KCr 1 per Dt.

There\'s a Dean Ing book ("Pulling Through"?) from the early 80s that
has the characters caught in a first strike on the US. The second half
of the book is a collection of articles he wrote for a survival
magazine on how to survive being caught near a target. The techniques
described there are pretty much what he had the characters doing. 

Anyway, your mention of "nuclear survival skills" and "first strike"
reminded me of the book. BTW, the same articles, plus a few extras were
re-released some years later as "The Chernobyl Syndrome". Appropriate,
as they are *exactly* the sort of thing you\'d want to know if caught
near that sort of disaster.

Ob-Trav: Have the party on a trip quite a ways from the starport on a
balkanized world when either a nuclear war breaks out, or a low tech
nuclear reactor has a major accident. Either way, they don\'t have
*time* to avoid the fallout. They\'ve got to find a way to survive until
the radiation levels drop enough to let them survive the attempt to
leave the area. 

The war version adds the possibility of encountering troops during
their escape. Wounds get quite a bit worse when the bulets drag
contaminated dust into the wound! Or cause your improvised filters to
be useless.

It\'s up to the ref to decide whether or not the party needs to
encounter a "survivalist" who knows what to do.

Polygamy is "more than one spouse". Polyandry is multiple husbands.

Bad reporting, it was. The slide and parts of the reciever of the model

far more than enough metal in the thing to set off a metal detector.

Who could?

Java\'s not so bed IF you only alow it a partial comand set.  Giving external
programs or applets disk or IO access is insane.  At the most they should
only be allow for screen control (animation and fill in the data) formating.
Beyond that you\'re begging for hackers!

Part of the problem is the paradem cross.

The computers on Traveller ships are modeled after mainfrains, large general
purpose computers.  That in itself throws out hardward based neural nets as
this are not \'reprogramabe\' and thus not reuseable UNLESS in the future they
come up with a neural net architecture that can be preloaded, saved of hard
disk, and reset to its\' original startup condition but if the neural net are
like this then your parradeum shifts to be identical to software inplemented
neural nets in that they can be purged.

If you are using the discription of the chips ability to alter other chips
for rerpoduction as it is discribed in the adventure they were introduced in
then it would be imposible for them to make that alteration in an operating
main frame as the materials they would need are not present and/or not in
the proper form.  The chips in the adventure are no more \'magical\' tech.
wise that today\'s ICs.  They use the same methods of curcuit burn in as
today chip founderies.  These methods are discribed in detail in the
adventure.  These proceesses could not occure in the sealed enviroment of a
running computer.  The adventure even states that the chips life forms could
not us the crashed ships superior quality curcuits and silicon UNTILL the
chips casing were ruptured by the crash and the enviromental wear on the casing.

So, the phisical \'burn in\' atributed to the virus is not posible in a
stardard traveller computer in its\' normal inviroment.  This is cannon
directly from the adventure that the Cyllene chips were introduced.

Next, ROBOTS limits the amount of nueral processors in an assebly by tech.
level.  These particular \'neural processors\' may not be pressent in anything
other than robot brains though.  It is not stated but even if the
percentages aplied to all computer (unlikely see above discussion of
presessor design paradiums) then it would be posible of pull the neural
processors and still have enough processing power to run a ship if a bit
clumsilly.  The top end is less that 50% IIRC so with the current design
requirement for the computers you would still be able to run one copy of
your most powerful program.  You can normally run two.

None of this is to say that the virus could not have been as nasty as
discribed.  It could have been much worse!  It is the way it did the damage
that it wrong.  The patern of infection it\'s nature is off.  Not the level
of desaster that it would have caused.  The virus should have been much
smarter to have caused the damage it did.  The suicide strain would have
been a terible failure and nearly useless.  The virus first strain should
have been closer to the third generation in smarts.  At a minimum it should
have acted like the puppertier or the alliance builder.  It should have hit
the 3I like pnumonic plague.  No symptoms at all one day any half the
population sick of dieing the next.  Anything less would have giving SYSOPs
the time the purge and load clean.  Virus\' best bet would be to stay hidden
untill it could takeover the majority of self mobile (robots) systems in an
area.  These would be much harder fix than a multifuction mainframe as they
might very well have non resetable synaptic processors giving a plave to the
virus to burn itself in but even then the virus would need to be in the
robot when it was first powered up or those chips would have already taken a
set pattern, the aquired knowledge and/or personallity of the robot.  A
smart virus could work arround this by quietly have \'maintainence\' performed
on all the self mobile units and during this maintained replacing the
standard chip set with the future equivalent to FPGAs with it\'s \'core
systems\' burned in.  This could easily be pasted off as a \'software
upgrade.\'  Why shouldn\'t the virus be capable of a little \'social
engineering\' and the spys call it...

NO IT WILL NOT.  Data can not be executed.  It is meaning less to the
LIMITED instraction set in the processor.  Just like a person can not act on
all the data he recieves as all of it is not actionable.  A computer mush be
able to tell what in instruction and what is data.

It\'s very curtain.  The process has a fixed instruction set.  Even if it can
be told to add new instructions latter it will have a fixed and non
deleteable core instruction set that is the building blocks for all other
instruction to be added later.  If this were not so them the device you are
discibing is NOT a computer.  It come down to definitions.

Then it is NOT a C-O-M-P-U-T-E-R.  It does NOT \'run programs\'.  You have
throw out all your reference points.  If you want to say it is a magic box
that makes your wishes come true IYTU thats fine but if your solution to

understand it you make technical character an imposibility as they can not
act based on logical progression and the scientific method.

>than two GTLs into the future, we can\'t be certain about _any_ assumptions.

Actually we can as current TL program can be run of future computers and
vice versa.  The TL change required the use of extra resoursed to run
properly but it is doable.  Check the Cyberpunk book under the \'strange
protocols\' side bar.  Though that is not canon.

One canon fact will blow you \'computers are different\' concept.  Programs in
traveller are not rated by the TL they were writen under.  They can run on
anly TL computer.

I see now.  You are one of those gamer that believe that if it says so in
\'the book\' it must be so.  Well if that is the case and you are not open to
logical discussion then why are you discussing it here?  The book are all
knowing and infallable but then virus and the original cannon adventure
directly contradict each other.  Virus says is can reburn the computers
inside their sealed chips cases but the adventure says there must be DIRECT
contact with bare silicon to effect such a burn in.  Which \'book\' is right?

How about the technical definition of \'computer\'? It\'s call a computer so it
IS a computer.

Computer design and bootstraping the code is what I do for by dayly bread.
I do it all from basic concept, to IC specification, to Gerber layout, to
boot straping, to prototype testing, to control code crunching.  My nitch is
as a one man design team for small to medium level custom integrated control
systems.

Those future computers come from the minds of men.  Even assuming such
advances as \'more than two state\' processing systems (once much talked about
but it fallen by the way side of late) and subatomic level circuits you
still have to have instructions and data.

Is CS in this sentence computer science?

What does NP-complete mean?  Not posible to complete?  If so I\'ll argue
against that with the million monkey theorum.

polynomial time?  Can you define this for me?  Polynomial, in the context

saying \'in a calulatable funtion of time\' posibly based of Megflops?  If so
that agrees with the million monkey theorum.

Yes and no.  It is just a scale change.  The basic PROCESSOR will still be
an intruction set sequential unit.  You might get to a massively parallel
level with near instant vertical and/or horisontal condition branching so
that in effect you have something done before you could have it done by
today\'s standard (what people call intuition or nonlinear thought) but that
is only if you look at it as a macro system.  At the base level there is no
paradium change.  After all if you push the concept to its\' limits you get
the human brain. (Massively paralleled neural net with shared integrated
data systems and hard coded instruction set, \'DNA\'. )

Changes to the macro effect does not nessecitate and micro paradiun change.
For example it is easy to run neural net software on a PC which has no
neural net processors on board.  You can solve control problems by modeling
an analog control system on a digital system and IMPROVE performace over the
original analog system by adding digital algorithems.  This is synergy not
tech. magic.  There is no magic in technology only the appearence of magic
untill you understand the underlying processes.

Biomophics and athrapamophisations are not my thing but I give this a shot.

If memory were directly executable instead of data then it would be posible
for a person to read a book written by a martial arts master and if his
hardware was as good as said master he would be able to perform as well as
that master without any practice.  That is what a computer can do with a
program.  Two computers will run the same program the same way with the same
results if working under the same conditions.  That is why memory is data
not program in humans but this analagy breaks down fast as human are neural
nets and most of our \'programimg\' for physical actions comes from the
learning process of repetition and feedback from our own bodies.

Another problem with the analogy is that people are \'one ofs\' not production
models.  With the exception of the most basic \'bootstrap program\' of
biological function we develope our own programs \'on the fly\' including a
large part of that \'macro OS\' we call personallity.  Perhaps that explains
the number of \'bugs\' that are in the human \'system\'.  After all you should
never compose at the keyboard but life often requires it if us.

If you were to explain how they were made to him he migth have some usefull

I have never seen a machine that would try to execute data without being
told to either explitely in its\' code or because a programer left off a
\'return from subroutine\' or otehr code block terminater.  When I\'ve done
that by mistake I get to see that my processor watch dog reset curcuit works
very well indeed!  I have not designed a new system with one sence they came
out in a single 8 pin dip!  That would shut down almost any virus in a few ms.

That is very true and a far cheaper solution but in the interests of max
performance it might be that some high speed
preprogramable/resetable/readable neural networks might be included.  This
would ONLY be true if speed was reaching curcuit design limits before
meeting responce time requirement.  It\'s a stop gap measure to be sure but a
logical one.  This would apply only to general perpose unit.  

Dedecated system could very well be designed better/faster/cheeper from
neural net or reprogamable hardware in much the same way that an off the
shelf programable logic controler with a EEPROM might be the best solution
for a particular automation aplication.

That is what bugs me.  The virus and the \'lobodimised chip tansponders\' were
designed for each other.  The designers of the virsus were experts on the
transponders but how in god\'s black space would the virus know what the
instruction set for a Zodonni model6 lot 12954 looked like or if it was
running a multiplexed bus or not, (add a few million other important
computer design details that a virus would have to know here)

Not magically, it\'s call compiling and you would be hard press to recognise

Code can be call data, yes but somebody has to tell the system to execute
it.  If incoming signals do not have \'run access\' it is not possible.  If
the system has a \'run list\' that can only be run from on board rom then even
haveing \'run access\' will not allow the running of an uploaded program.

That is pissy and very short sighted.  If there were no distictions between
memory and execuables in the human mind then if you read a book properly
written by Bruce Lee you could fight as well as he could without any
practice other than reading the book provided you were in as good physical
shape.  Note that computer can do this with there programs.  So far no one
has figure out how to download an executable to a human brain.  We learn by
self teaching through observation and practice.  We write our own
executable.  We are our own programmers.

They are right and you are are far as 1s and 0s BUT code hase to be in the
right format for the process.  The right sequence.  Try running the data in
a dictionary or this email as an executable and it will not do anything
usefull.  It noise not signal.

Even if the data is an executable program the computer will not try to run
it unless told to.  That is what I ment.  WHO or WHAT tall the target that
that data that it just got is code and that it should run it NOW! and that
it has top access rights.  You did know that programs on large computers can
have limited access to resources?  Like not being able to acess curtain
subsytems or only having acess to one terminal for all it\'s IO funvtions.
Main frame are a lot different in their security that PC.

True, my comment was who told the reciever that what it recieved was a
program rather than more general data and that it should run it now with
unlimited access.

    'body' => 'Ok folks, This virus thread has given me some cause for though.  I\'ve looked
back though some old cumper stuff and did a little digging pluss a little
head scratching.  I think there is a reasonable way to explain the virus and
canon and make it all work within reasonable bounds and with minimal handwave.

So load your Traveller canons and see what holes you can poke in this.



Point 1) The 3I is big, REAL BIG!

Point 2) The 3I would need to have curtain standards to regulate trade, like
transponders.

Point 3) Because of point 1, point 2, and because ships travel great
distances and may need repair some standarization in computers will be required.

Point 4) Because of the long night and various specific needs all computers
can\'t use identical parts and sub systems.

Point 5) Softwares writer want as big a market as posible for their products.

Point 6) Customers want access to as many products and choices as posible.

Conclussion 1) From all the points above, a universal language.  Let\'s call
it IC for Imperial C.  (One reason C is so big today is it\'s standardization
and cross compilability)

Conclusion 2) From all above, a univeral standard framework for IO to allow
divers to be writen for IO and progams to access this IO.  Let\'s call it
IDOS.  It is a set of basic IO routines writen in IC.  (Unix has been cross
compiled onto many different computers from PC to mainframes).  The user can
choose a front end like Itouch, Italk, or Iwindows so he does not have to
learn Idos or IC to just run the programs he needs and of course there are
language and console modules for all major races and most minor ones.  The
dolphin console is rated for 100 meters in depth.

Effect 1) All computer makers have to do is provide a compiler for IC to
compile to their processor and system and anybody can recompile any source
code to run on their system.  This lets small companies have a foot into a
BIG market.

Effect 2) All programers can write code that can run (after compiling) on
any machine with a IC compiler.  This let\'s \'Joe code cruncher\' write for a
HUGE market.  All code is sold as copyrighted source code on ROM disks that
has to be compiled to run on the target system.

Effect 3) Consumers get diversity and compatability.

Effect 4) Components manufacturers need only write one IC driver for their
hard ware to sell their product to add to any computer system (with a
standard interface like the USB starting up now or like the centronics
standard for printers or the novel network for about everybody).  So Sence
Tech\'s sensors are \'plug and play\' with Rue computers model 1 FIB and it is
compatable with Blaser-R-US\' laser canon and all of them can be integrated
together of cause precision aimed mayhem with \'Joe code crunchers\' Gunner
interact-1.  PROFIT FOR EVERBODY! and \'MR. Fixit\' on Rigil can tune it up
with his standard dianostics package and Captain Hornblower of the Destroyer
Vigalence can use his querry software to make sure nothing unautherized has
been done like hiding so recreational pharmicuticals in the lasing tube..."I
know you wouldn\'t do that Gunner so you won\'t mind if I take remote control
at test fire that laser now would you?\'

EFFECT 4) A universal language that the virus can use to take control of any
computer by compiling inself into that system with the manufacture provide
compiler!

How 1)  Some bright puppies in the 3Is electronic warfare section see all
this nice standardisation and get the idea that a \'ship killer virus\' would
be a great way to easily put down a rebellion.

Problem 1) Most ship\'s captains are paranoid and keep their computers lock
down tight against normal com trafic.

Obsevation 1) The transponder has direct access to the computer!  Lets talk
to those bright boys that built that \'unbeatable\' transponder.  

What?!  A life form!  How do we that thing to get our virus into the target
computer?  OH! they have preditors on that world also...and they are
naturally aggressive too?...and they are basicly computers too?...well we
might be on to something here.  

What if we lobodomised those preditors leaving them dumb and mean and then
taught them IC?  They would not be able to \'EAT\' the mainframes but they
could take them over...OH! you say the could \'EAT\' the transponder and use
it for their \'core\' to attack other systems untill it broke the security and
could overwrite IDOS and once that happened the operaters would have no way
back into the system...Good Good but wouldn\'t a complete purge fix
that?...OH!  The transponder of course...and sleeper codes tacked onto any
write accessable executable by the infected compiler...including any
unsecured smart terminal and portables.  

And you say the sleeper code could reassemble itself over time using a
packet sequencing system...but wouldn\'t that be a much less efficent vector
and make it more likely that the code could be corrupted or mutated?...Oh,
it\'s only a backup system then, that should be ok.

What if they powered down, killed the transponder, wiped all storage media
except the original ROMs, and then did a complete rebuild?...It would take
HOW LONG!?!?...and they would loose all their records because the
incremental backups would be infected when IDOS was infected sence it
schedules the backups...and only computer-4+s are sufficently experienced to
feel confident to try that proceedure outside a class A or B starport.

Sounds like we have a failsafe system to stop a rebelion or a military coup.
The 3I will be free from the danger of Empirerers of the Flag...Just one
question, How do we stop it?  Oh, a delet code.  Sounds good but what if
this virus mutates in that packet recombination thing so that the code
doesn\'t work?...I see, end of the universe kind of thing...Not good, that\'s
a problem.  Oh, the odds of that happening are less than of a particular
star going nova on any particular day.  Well, if we were only to used it as
an absolutely last line of defence to save the 3I from distruction then if
it ran amoke we\'d be in no worse shape than if we had lost and maybe knowing
what was going to happen we could recover before our enemy...

Ok, the project is approved.  We\'ll finance it through the gold plated
freasher fund.  Give it the hightest security rating AND need-to-know.


So, any canon flaws?  What about technical problems?

This simply is not true in many architectures. An operating system 
copying bytes from hard disk to RAM might be loading an application - 
data which is then executed - or might be loading a document - data 
in the traditional sense. 

If the CPU\'s program counter jumps to a block of memory containing
what you call data, then depending on the CPU architecture, it may
well do its best to interpret it as code and execute it. Older and 
simpler CPUs in particular aren\'t very picky in this regard (and so
you could say that TL *has* changed this already, once).

It\'s really more like the opposite: unless the system is set up 
explicitly to restrict certain segments of memory from executing,
it\'s not possible to prevent data from being executed.

I\'m pretty confident that future OSs will have *more* holes, not 
fewer. How long had computer viruses been well-known when Microsoft
added document-embedded macros to MS Word? They didn\'t learn from 
all the other viruses written previously, and this situation isn\'t 
going to get better. Read the comp.risks newsgroup for a few months
if you want to know just how frequently people keep making the 
same damn mistakes over and over again.

   Who you calling expendable?
 
 PEEPER-Class Picket:
 
         FQ-1631331-000000-04000-0       MCr 73.992      130 tons
         Cargo=0.6. LHyd=81.9. EP=3.9. Agility=0. Low=0. Crew=2. TL=C.
 
   A dual-purpose picket ship and courier, with L-Hyd capacity for 2x J-3 in
 the basic configuration. The flying saucer hull includes fuel scoops and
 hoses, but no purification plant. MCr 92.49 singly.
 
   This one could carry 130 tons of drop tank; the execution of a first
 jump-2 with a 65 Dt tank would add 2 parsecs to intrusion range and
 allow the vessel to both start the rest of the journey with full tanks
 and have a J2 L-Hyd cache if it came back that way. Brackets are standard,
 and the tanks are KCr 1 per Dt.

 1000 dtons is a bad size for a military ship IMO. Too big for an expendable
 picket, too small to put real (bay/spinal) weapons on.

xxxx
Okay, what if I upped the missile launcher count?
xxxx
 
 In my strong opinion, a military ship should have enough armour to shrug
 off the biggest laser it expects to face. Lasers have a maximum output of
 TL*50 MJ. Unless you can do this, civilians can hurt you, and that is Bad.

xxxx
I have space left over so I could add more.
xxxx 

 A limiting factor on thrust has traditionally been compensator technology.
 TL 12 can build 3G compensators, so the crew of a 6G TL12 ship will likely
 be wearing three gees in all sorts of odd directions (random maneuvers to
 exploit speed-of-light lag and all that).

xxxx
Okay, but I think that the extra speed can be very importand during critial 
situations.
xxxx
 
 With only 525 MW of power, the thing cant stay in jump-3 space. J3 should
 cost about 75 MW per 100 dtons to stay in jumpspace, so the Norfolk class
 should mount at least 750 MW of power, plus about 50 to run life support,
 artificial gravity, the computers etc.

xxxx
Were is that rules for that? If so I\'ll up each one of the fusion genns to 
200Mw.
xxxx 

 I dont like small meson screens. Basically, meson guns will tend to be
 pretty big (1), so either get a chunky one or pray that you dodge.

xxxx
Okay, good point, I\'ll trade it in for a sand caster on N-damper.
xxxx
 
 Think about mounting more sandcasters in place of missiles or lasers,
 unless you have enough armour to be laser-proof. In my opinion you need 1
 sandcaster per expected enemy.

xxxx
Okay, I have a fair amount of cargo space, that could be converted into more 
sand casters, N-dampers and armor.
xxxx
 
 Welcome to geahead-land :)

I\'m happy to be here.

Actually a new system is being gradually employed called BodyScan. It\'s not 
the same as a standard X-ray. It uses a different frequency beam. It can see 
just about anything on the body. Cocaine, water pistols, knives, guns. It 
gives you a wireframe-like image of the body. The only trouble is (IMRC) that 
it can\'t yet make a clear enough picture to set of alarms. It has to be 
checked by customs officials. I may be wrong though :)  .

Distance is supposed to be along a practical route, although anything up to
Jump-4 is probably acceptable. Look at Emape and Raweh in Five Sisters:
they are 13 pc apart, not 6, because you can\'t routinely run cargo past the
interdiction of Andor and Candory. In most regions ignoring this won\'t make
very much difference.

No. The allegiance factor represents two different barriers to trade:
border hassles (tariffs and restrictions) and incompatible industrial
standards. Neither of these should apply between the Imperium and its
client states (unless newly acquired), or what is the value of client
status?

That\'s because too many people wanna throw in their little \'rules fixes\' to make things work the way they *want* to work.  IMNSFBHO, it\'s *more* interesting to let the downsides fall where they may and see the characters try to figure a way around them.

The point is that I\'m not getting ice out of the gas giant.
Gas Giants have the same problem in that fuel as at the bottom
of this big gravity well (worse than the main world).  It is
much easier for a lone ship to go out to the Kuiper belt,
snag comets, and push them into orbits that bring them into
the inner solar system.  One ship can produce a steady stream
of these things.

Make that a lot of tonnage flinging around in a narrow range of
orbits.  Orbits that, even in todays technology, are easy to
determine.  Of course you choose orbits that pass just outside
of the 100 diam limit (so they won\'t cross the path of ships
travelling out to the limit) until the thrusters kick in and
slow them down (in case they fail) an put them into some predetermine
plantary orbit for later retreival.

I don\'t know what you would call "dirt cheap" but it a way to make
it cheaper than having to bring fuel up from the main world.

IIRC that world is fairly low TL.  Can you see them landind the March
Harrier at an exxon, the pilot leaning out and howling in Varga to the Varga
attendant to \'Filler up!\'?

Those were two Type T meson guns after all...

   Serious case of bad reporting.  The device was designed to fire low
power tear gas charges.
It took two very underpowered .32 shells.  Standard rounds would cause it
to blow up, causing more damage to the firer than any attended target.

   This is another separate issue.  The \'evil baby killing plastic Glocks\'
(tm) had, as you stated, a plastic exterior, but the pistol\'s frame was
made of Titanium Steel.  This give it a very distinctive \'pistol outline\'
in x-rays.  This was just one of the very many techical flaws in "Die Hard
2."  
   One of the non-technical flaws was having a closeup of a PacBell
telephone in a Washington, D.C. airport.

Actually, that\'s not true... The foundation of languages like LISP and Tcl
(and any other language where functions are 1st class data types) is that a
program is just data...  This is not true vice-versa.  Nothing will let you
execute a copy of your favorite novel, however a data file _can_ contain a
complete program.  The way to make a Virus like this, is to trick the
system somehow into executing the contents of the data file.  And this is
all assuming that computers work on the same general principles as today.  

Since Traveller science violates such things as the Laws of Gravitation and
Relativity, I don\'t see why they can\'t break such things as Turing machines...

You are still making the assumption that it works the same.  Just because
TL7/8 computers have boot strap codes, it doesn\'t mean that TL12 ones will

Not true.  A "computer", according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is "a
calculating-machine, especially an electronic device for performing
mathematical and logical operations."  There is nothing in there about
instruction sets or boot code.  A computer is defined by what it does, not
how it does it.  Just like we know that a Jump drive can move us a parsec a
week without understanding how it actually works, we can know that a
Complexity-4 computer (in GURPS) can run two complexity-4 programs.  It
doesn\'t matter how it runs them and what is actually going on inside, only
the effects matter.  Thus we know it can provide +5 bonuses to two ship
weapons,  without understanding the inner workings.

No, as a matter of fact I\'m not.  I do interpret and often change things
that don\'t make sense in the books.  However, we are talking about the OTU,
which is _only_ what is printed in the books.  IMTU, it\'s quite possible
that computers will require instruction sets and boot-strap code.  Clearly
this is true in YTU.  But not in the OTU.

Well, I can\'t comment on that since I don\'t actually have the books for
reference.  But I\'m not arguing about how Virus should or should not work.
All I\'m saying is that your TL7 assumptions are invalid when applied to
TL12 computers.

Well, you certainly have more experience in this than I do.  However, that
experience is in design of _TL7_ machines, not TL12 ones.

First off even the "minds of men" assumption isn\'t necessarily valid,
perhaps high TL computers are designed by other high TL computers.
However, I don\'t actually like that idea, so let\'s ignore it for a second.
I\'m not saying that TL12 computer are incomprehensible to us.  If we
actually saw one and had it explained to us, I\'m sure we\'d  understand it
(It might require a few years at a TL12 university, but eventually we\'d get
it.)  However, what we cannot do is predict _how_ it would work.  As an
example of this, consider Jules Verne\' "20,000 leagues under the sea."  In
it, he predicted (correctly) that electrically powered submarines would
dominate future naval warfare.  The concept of the fast attack submarine
was valid, he got the "what".  However, he was not able to predict such
things a nuclear power plants and tomahawk missiles.  He didn\'t get the
"How".  Now I think he could learn it if a 1990s person explained them to
him, but he couldn\'t predict the how.  Same applies here.

Polynomial time means that a program with input of size x, will take c(x^k)
iterations to execute with c and k as some arbitrary constants.  NP means
non-polynomial.  An NP program will take c\'*(k\'^x) iterations, for some
constants c\' and k\'.  On very large inputs, where x>>c,k,c\',k\', NP problems
take much longer than polynomial ones.  NP-complete is a large set of NP
problems that can be reduced to each other (in other words, if you can
solve one in polynomial time, you can solve them all in polynomial time).
Conventional approaches to computer design and programming have been unable
to solve any NP-complete problems in P time.  Quantum computer are believed
to be able to.  

This example is not actually relevant to the Virus discussion, but is
merely an example of how a basic assumption in CS (and NP-completeness is
pretty basic) doesn\'t hold true at higher TLs.

Does a brain really have hard-coded instructions?  Are you sure?  Because
modern science certainly isn\'t.  We don\'t know how the brain works.
Parallel neural networks is _one_ way of approximating the brain, one that
we don\'t know is correct.  Maybe a brain has all the same parameters as a
Turing machine-based computer.   Maybe not.  And even if it does, a TL12
computer may still not have them.  The assumption that a high-TL computer
will work like the human brain is not necessarily true.  Maybe it works in
some other fashion.  Or maybe not.

>Changes to the macro effect does not nessecitate and micro paradiun change.
And likewise, similarities between macro effects don\'t necessitate
identical micro paradigms.  That\'s exactly my point.  Just because it acts
like a TL7 computer, doesn\'t mean it works like a TL7 computer.

Well, rules and mind-sets can be argued infinitively, unless all sides
agree to disagree.  After all, we all have our own ideas about game
mechanics.  As for myself, I don\'t subscribe to any but Classic
Traveller, but I will use the ideas I like from this list.  Especially
the ships posted.  I do have almost all the little black books and
supplements (Thank GOD I bought them when they first came out!)  I never
had a clue they would be next to impossible to dig up anymore.  I also
bought most of the Mega-Traveller stuff.  That Fire, fusion & etc and
Pocket Empires sounds good, but I unfortunately do not have access to
those materials.

You may ask why Classic Traveller, and I\'d tell you : \'memories\'.  I was
introduced to it in 1980 and we played it pretty heavy for a few years
before we all graduated and drifted apart.  The new material is nice,
but my heart forever belongs to Classic Traveller.  That CD Rom I heard
talk about 1.5 years ago with a compilation of all the good TML stuff
and the CT rules set, I hope they hurry up and get that out.  I couldn\'t
hardly wait 1.5 years ago, and I still feel that way!  :)

Any billets...?

Hmm, the Virus debate annoys me more than the drop tanks; knowing some of
the participants in the drop tanks debate I view it as a mild blood sport.
Probably should be banned, but well, it\'s a while since the nth pirates
inferno.

rember the novel that I was talking about? Here are the Prolog/Introduction 
and Chapter one. Comments, questions, ect are welcomed.

Araque\'s Sands
	"Just think of it as a camping trip"
		-Devin Marshall
	"Extinction is not an option"
		-The only rule of New Terra
"We came in peace, to flee a world being torn apart by war, we failed to 
leave our Past behind"
		-Last words of Jacob Kaylee

	"Why are the sands red?" the child, maybe six or seven, asked his 
grandparents as he looked out the Agri-dome\'s window to the heart of Kaylee 
Prime.
	"They are red because many people fought, and died, for that they 
believed in," the grandmother, one of the last survivors from Earth.  
Stereotypical Irish in appearance, the only blemishes on her otherwise 
perfect complexion a scare across her left hair line and flecks of silver in 
her fiery red hair.
	"How could that be?  All of the sands are red, a lot of people must 
have died to make them red," the child commented.
	"Yes, a lot of people died to get where we are now," the other 
grandparent said, looking out the window, events from the previous century 
playing though his mind.
	"How did it start," the child asked.
	"You be a curious little one, aye?"  the grandmother asked.
	"Yes," the child responded, "so how did it start?"
	"Well, I guess it be okay to tell you, it started just after we were 
thawed out, just past Araque VII..."

Chapter 1:
	Council Chambers NCS Pegasus, 2065 AD 1951
	"All I\'m saying is that..." Alexander Tsing started.
	"I know exactly what you\'re saying, Mister Tsing, I don\'t want to 
hear it, meeting adjourned!" the chairman, Jacob Kaylee said as he stood up 
and left the room, his hands balled in anger.
	"Seems like a very reasonable man," another of the council members 
said to Tsing as he stood up and angrily put his things in order.
	"Kaylee doesn\'t know the fore end of a Robo-Miner from the aft end of 
a fusion rocket," Tsing said as he turned to look at the other member who was 
six years his junior.
	"Mister Tsing..." the other council member started to say as he 
suppressed a chuckle.
	"I believe that we are on better terms than that, Devin, call me 
Alex," the older council member said.
	"Alex, I know that you and Kaylee don\'t get along..." Devin said.
	"Kid, you have a pennant from understatement, Kaylee hates me because 
I speak out agents the stupid things that he does, I bet it goes back to the 
fact that I\'m one of the few non-coalition members of the mission," Alex said.
	"No argument here, Alex, from your personality profile and what you 
have done here I\'m willing to bet that you are planning to steal some of the 
supplies and colonists and start your own colony, am I correct?"  Devin said, 
omitting that Siobhan had put some of the pieces, really most of the pieces 
together, which would come in time, hopefully.
	"Now, kid what would give you that idea?"  Alex said, his face 
lighting up as he saw that there might be another volunteer.
	"Well, I had a few suspicions, Siobhan O\'Keefe helped put the rest of 
the pieces together and the final confirmation came right now when I 
mentioned the idea," Devin said, if as on queue Siobhan O\'Keefe walked though 
the door.
	"I\'d been wondering what has been keeping you?" she said she strode 
in.
	"Uh, we were just talking about the future," Devin replied.
	"Is it true?" she asked.
	"Yes," Alex stated.
	"Do you have room for two more?"  Devin said as he took Siobhan\'s 
hand.
	"Yes, there is room for two more, have your things packed and ready 
by 2130 and meet at Colonist Transport III.  Oh, if you have access to any 
weapons, preferably non lethal please bring them, as Kaylee said there will 
be guards," Alex said softly.
	"We will be there, have a good day, Alex," Devin said as he ushered 
Siobhan though the door.
	"Is this really happening?" Siobhan asked as she walked hand in hand 
down the corridors of the massive ship, more than a thousand tons.
	"Is what really happening?" Devin said as he felt her headrest 
against his shoulder.
	"Are we really going to support Tsing?  Are we planin\' to fight our 
way off of this ship and most likely participate in a war?" she said softly 
in her Irish Brogue.
	"Most likely.  We only have a short while to pack for this trip," 
Devin replied.
	Chuckling Siobhan said: "This is ironic, before the Pegasus project I 
had not even bern out side Europe, now I\'m one of a handful of people that 
has crossed the galaxy."
	"Well, at least you don\'t have to deal with people who drive on the 
wrong side of the road," Devin said.
	"Ah, here we are, I\'ll see you back out here in a few minutes?" 
Siobhan said as she disconnected her self from Devin and walked though her 
cabin\'s door.
	Devin\'s eye followed her figure though the door, shook his head and 
walked though is door, the two suit cases and the backpack that the colonist 
were allowed to bring in personal stuff were quickly repacked.  Walking to 
the back of the room were the safe was he punched in the code to unlock it, 
in there was a low velocity rifle, perfect for use in areas were punching a 
big hole is something if you missed was very bad.  Picking the rifle up Devin 
loaded it and stuffed extra ammunition in his jump suits pocket.  Clearing 
the other contents of the safe out he put on the headset that would link to 
the rifle to aid in targeting and communications with other people and with 
the ship.  One he was loaded down with the equipment, most of which he did 
not know how to use very well as he was just an engineer, not one of the 
security officers like Siobhan he attached a Mag Lev Grapple (MLG) to Bucky, 
his Savant computer.  Attaching a length of nylon cord to his belt and the 
other end to the MLG, he walked out the door, the Savant computer in tow.
	"Ready to go?" Siobhan asked she looked Devin over, noticing that the 
safety was on and the rifle was not even connected to the headset.
	"I am, assuming that I don\'t have to use this," Devin said as he 
lifted the rifle up.
	"Okay, you know this ship better than most, what is the best way to 
get to the Colonist Lander?" Siobhan asked.
	After thinking for a second, "I would go for taking the elevator, but 
those are tracked, the best bet would be the zero g area in the center of the 
ship," Devin said as he started walking, scanning back and forth to see if 
anyone was coming.
	"Okay, right be hind you," Siobhan said as she walked after him.  
Setting the head set to display compiled thermal image of the corridor she 
had no need to look back and forth.
	"Here we are, "Devin said as he stopped before a door that was marked 
with warning of zero g environment, "Just step over the side and grab a hold 
of the MLG and hold on," he said as he opened the door and stepped over, the 
MLG following obediently behind.  Siobhan followed soon after and grabbed a 
hold of the device by one of its handles. "Are you ready?" Devin asked.
	"Yes, "came her nervous, but sincere, reply.
	"Hang on, " he suggested as he tapped a command which commanded the 
MLG to move under its own power, soon it began to slow as neared is pre 
programmed destination.
	"Open the door," Siobhan said as she released her self from the MLG 
and moved to the top of the door, or at least what would be the top of the 
door on the other side.
	"Okay," he said as he punched his access code to open the door, to 
his great astonishment nothing happened.  "Uh-oh."
	"What do you mean, \'uh-oh?"

First off, thanks to everyone who posted suggestions of T4 material 
for me.  I am now the owner of T4 softcover, M:0 Campaign, PE, CSC, 
and FFSv2.

The topic I\'ve been thinking about:

Booms, Recessions, Depressions.

What factors would cause a subsector/sector wide boom or bust?

Are individual systems in a web of trade so diverse that they can 
easily weather the economic absence (from interdiction, internal 
dissent, or other cause) of any one?  Or does disruption of trade on 
one world cause a "domino effect" that ripples throught the system, 
subsector, and so on?  Or alternatively, how many systems have to 
fail before the whole sub/sector fails.

Likewise, do large scale economic upturns occur?  "Sector ### reported 
record profits by everyone this quarter."  Or \'gold rushes\'?  
"Lanthanum was discovered in system####, whole sector reaps profits."

It would be interesting if the characters were suddenly faced with a 
sector-wide depression or boom.  Trade would fluctuate wildly.  
Fortunes could be made or lost.  Millionaires would end up selling 
apples on street corners.  You know the spiel.

The non-direct economic impact of military action would be very 
interesting to evaluate.  By non-direct I mean that what happens when 
your factory on planet XX is fine but your supplier or consumer gets 
blown up?  Or your competition?  Do systems pray for the arrival of 
naval ships "now I can sell that extra ton of vegetables/H2/armament", 
or do navy ships commandeer local supplies "they took my last ton of 
vegetables/H2/armament"?

Does the Imperium conscript (nationalize? Imperialize?) production 
- -"my toy gun factory makes the real thing now"- in wartime?  If so, on 
what scale?

I\'d just like to hear the opinions- I certainly don\'t have the 
economic background to run any numbers.

Actually, they won\'t be welded on.  And there really isn\'t any
reason they should be less dependable.  We are talking "fuel
tanks" here.  Something we have mastered at TL 7.

Yeah.  37KT\'s a big rock.  Rough guesstimate, a 1 KT tug that has 6G 
accelleration normally would have something on the order of a bit less than a 
sixth of a G when pushing a 37KT rock.

OK, lemme do some quick calcs here...  You\'re talking of an accelleration on 
the order of 30 cm/sec.  Gonna take you awhile to build up some delta vee with 
it so you\'d best pack a lunch.

Just a quick note to let you know I\'m signing off for a little while -
pressures of RL, y\'know. I\'ve been enjoying some of the threads, too.

I think Charles\' idea to create a "Virus Declaration" is a good move.

Ditto for drop tanks (its funny that Steven and Keven both agree that we
shouldn\'t allow drop tanks to have a big effect on the economics of the 3I
- - but are still arguing over the mechanism by which to curtail it!). A
Declaration would be useful for everyone, and Chris Thrash may even use it
- - I mean, the _Far Trader_ section on piracy has elements that are straight
out of the "Sunbeard Declaration"! If not, it looks like he will
unilaterally decide on the fate of drop tanks in the Starships book - so
now\'s your chance to have an effect on this portion of canon!

If these various Declarations can be hammered out, I recommend putting them
in the FAQ. Direct queries from any future posters to the FAQ in order to
circumvent more "cannon" wars.

(yes, that was intentional!  ;-)

Has the "Sunbeard Declaration" been put into the FAQ?

Unless the local governments subsidise the long haul freight, which I believe 
is the point of the \'subsidised merchant\' vessels.  And if you wanna debate 
whether or not this is feasible, I refer you to any copy of the Wall Street 
Journal where you\'ll find out about all *KINDS* of subsidies the gov gives 
corporations if you just keep reading long enough.

Like I said earlier, I was under the impression that long haul freighting was 
pretty much subsidised.  Obviously it exists, or there would *be* no Jump-3 
capable ships like the subsidised liner around.

I\'ve seen circumstances where characters owning a stake in a sub merch shipped 
spec cargo as freight then sold it at its destination for a hefty profit.  It 
was just a good way of screwing the gov out of its cut

If it isn\'t, somebody\'s doing something wrong.

You\'re assuming it\'s being hauled in a J1 ship.  If he ships it via a J3 
subsidised liner, he can get it there in mebbe 3 weeks for 2KCr/ton.

This I don\'t get.  "J6 drop tanks"?  You mean, the ship is supposed to go Jump 
6 and have all its jump fuel in tanks?

Pretty much the impression I get from the trade rules in CT.  After all, Free Traders are just picking up the odd lots laying around that the megacorps don\'t or can\'t get to right now.

   Homeowners don\'t usually depreciate their homes (if well-
maintained, these often increase in value over the duration of
ownership), but businesses usually do depreciate buildings. OTOH,
land is assumed to have an infinite useful life and is not
depreciated.
   In the absence of RW experience on useful starship lifetimes,
you make your own guess: I\'d go with a 50-150 year average.
   Then there is the question of salvage value. In certain
quarters, there are salvage dealers that strip and resell the
more valuable systems and turn the rest into scrap. (Going rate for a
system is 50% OEM new price if the dealer has it at all, caveat emptor.)
From time to time, starships are sold for scrap that could be refurbished
and put back into service. Such deals are infrequent and require
considerable time, cash, starship architecture skill, and sweat.
On some worlds, there are small businesses that eke out a meager
profit doing just that with the leavings of megacorporations.

We know from Books 1 and 4 that the Imperium does in fact conscript
personnel for all uniformed branches (including Scouts).  We also know
from Book 4 and Fifth Frontier War (among other sources) that Imperial
member states have their own forces.  That suggests a hybrid, ad hoc
type of arrangement, in which the needs of the Imperium come first.  If
the Imperium needs to conscript some personnel in your sector or even
your world, it has the right to do so.  If, then, the member state needs
to conscript personnel, it can do so according to its own laws.  On the
other hand, any citizen of appropriate age may volunteer for Imperial
service, and the member state of which he is a citizen cannot prevent
it.  The Imperium may of course decide not to take any volunteers from
certain places at certain times because of its own needs.   

I deleted your discussion of feudal vs. professional raising of armies. 
In my Traveller universe, that is a historical progression.  In early
Imperial times, local lords (descended in title and concept if not in
actual genes from the Terran officials who were sent to run parts of the
Ziru Sirka after the end of the Interstellar Wars) raised armies and
navies as well as they could for local defense, with Imperial subsidies
and assistance (like training) to the extent the Imperium could and
would provide it.  These forces became "Imperialized" in the event of
hostilities, according to the needs of the Imperium.  After the Civil
War, in part to reduce the power of the nobility, professional military
and naval forces were developed.  Citizens of member states could join
the Imperial forces, which were integrated across regions and cultures
to the extent practicable, and which owed allegiance to the Emperor,
rather than some noble.

Another approach to carrying a super-sharp weapon is a scabbard that is
not in contact with the blade.  For example, if the blade has a blood
gutter, the scabbard could have internal ridges that fit in the blood
gutter and hold it securely in place in the scabbard.  Then the part of
the scabbard that is near the blade could be a safe distance away and
not be cut by the blade.  Just be a little careful inserting the blade.

He\'s luckier than the burglar in the story I heard some years ago.  If I
remember it correctly, a thief broke into a house and beat up the old
couple who lived there, then demanded their valuables.  The husband led
him to another part of the house, and got the burglar to precede him
into the garage.  The husband locked the door on him and went to attend

about the burglar and the two Rottweilers in the garage until they were
on the way to the hospital.  The story may be apocryphal -- after all, I
don\'t recall reading it in a newspaper or other somewhat reliable
source.

The actual article is titled as the later. The original poster simply made
an error in transcribing it. It\'s worth looking at, IMO.

  Sounds right. Further, it sounds _reasonable_. Is there a need a for a 30
to 40Kt service station to have a full 1-G constant maneuver establishment?
In fact, is it _impossible_ to use the M-1 rating (2% at MCr 1.5/Dt of drive)
to install a sub-1.0 G maneuver drive on such a station?

  Play nice! What rules am I violating? I admit that I\'m using them properly,
and that I\'ve actually read them, and I don\'t see that your failure to do so
is my problem.
  
  IIRC, the evolution of what might be described as your position on such
stations was that they were too expensive, to which point you cited some
truly staggering (not in the context of the trade volumes involved, which
also makes one wonder) costs, which you then attempted to substantiate on
the basis of some of the most useless station concepts imaginable. These
clearly ill thought out objections were proven false by simple use of the
rules of choice, although I suspect that a number of other systems could
be used to the same effect.
 
  After a few intermediary statements ("fall-back positions"?) you\'re now
claiming that tugs can\'t be used because they would have to have bridge 
allocations based on the pushee, and presumably that further it is quite
inconceivable to have an item of industrial infrastructure use any concept or
stat from HG2 without being designed as a full-blown starship or large craft?

  In that case we\'ve just _proved_ conclusively that not only do high-speed
freighters not exist in the Traveller universe, but that luxury liners are
also clearly impossible, as they _couldn\'t_ charge more than the Book 2 rates
without invoking the terminal displeasure of the attendant Imperial Kommissar.

  Nope - I included the necessary loop-holes in my original analyses. It
appears that IYTU freight cannot - possibly for religious or metaphysical
reasons? - be moved for a fee exceeding KCr 1.0/Dt/Jump, and that therefore
all such concepts as express freight or premium charges for service are
incompatible with the laws of physics.

  Admittedly, when next I do run a Traveller campaign I\'ll be structuring
it such that normal human economic behaviour will have the opportunity to
be rational and intelligently explored.

  Feel free to comment if you have any cogent observations to make on
the shipping economics/drop tank issues.

If you\'ve got it parked around a gas giant and you want to move it to the 100 
diameter jump limit in 24 hours, yeah.  You\'ll *need* 1G accelleration due to 
the distances involved, approximately 10 million klicks.

So you\'re using the *station* now as a tug?  Interesting.  IIRC, the 50 ton 
tug has a fairly heavy computer.  Mod 3?  Mod 4?

If you want to move a station from a close orbit of a large gas giant, where 
it\'s more easily fueled up, to the 100 diameter jump limit for that gias 
giant, you need 1G to get it out there in a day.  Jesus, do the math already.

You keep wanting to make permenant structures from throwaway components.  Now 
you\'re telling me that a small tug, on the order of mebbe 100 tons or less, 
should be able to push this 37KT rock at a reasonable speed?

It\'s a big station.  It holds over 30KT of fuel, enough fuel to move 300KT of 
cargo 1 parsec.  You were expecting maybe to store all that fuel in a shoebox??

No, I\'m not.  You\'re saying you can have a small core with lots of rock tanks around it and stay legal even though you violate the 2% bridge rule.  I\'m saying you can\'t, not as a permenant structure.  I specified a moveable station, designed as a nonstarship, that would ferry fuel out to the jump point in reasonable time frames.  I even based it on your hollow rocks.  I just didn\'t look for any quasilegal loopholes to jam them through.

Actually it\'s fine if you don\'t allow access to  host OS disk and IO.
Operating on virtual files/ persistant objects within the JVM could be made
completely safe. That\'s not to say current implementations are, but if
you\'ve ever done any work on "hosted" operating systems, you\'d know it\'s
quite possible to write one that is incapable of inflicting damage outside
of it\'s own environment.

The Solaris implementation of Minix is an example.

Virus is quite possible if one asumes that even military starships run
operating systems written by Microsoft.
However, given Vilani conservatism, I don\'t see how that would ever be the
case, Microsoft (even in two thousand years) is far too young a company to
be given military contracts.

Fascetiousness ill becomes you, Steven.  I\'ve never considered charging more 
for longer jumps because I\'ve assumed long hauls were subsidised.  It makes 
sense to me that they would be.  As far as high buck tickets on luxury liners 
go, no character in any game I\'ve ever reffed got on one, so I never bothered 
to ponder the implications.

Actually, nobody\'s *tried* moving freight over 1 parsec IMTU and had to pay 
for it.  So the topic of premium service, et. al., simply hasn\'t come up yet.

You have my comments on pure-drop tankage, probably on file.  And despite your 
attempts to swing things in tangentical directions, the facts remain that an 
80 ton drop tank will still cost 90KCr dry, and *still* need to be filled.

It\'s not zero, is it?  Remember, you\'re shipping a *LOT* of fuel.  It adds up.

Charles, while you are correct in saying that an instruction that is not
recognized can not be excuted , it is incorrect to asume from that premise ,
that data cannot be executed.

Data _can_ be executed _if_ it\'s bytes represent valid instructions.

Back in the old days we used to store code in the VDU (Visual Display Unit)
memory, and it was always a challenge to write code that _looked_ like, say
an aircraft cockpit when viewd as data.

There was also a competition to write a "good" poem that wqas also a
"useful" program when executed

Takes longer for the chunks to get insystem though.  And it takes time to find 
those chunks out there.  They\'re not exactly an ice cube every 200 meters,

Obviously you\'d give the ice cubes the right-of-way insystem.

  I\'m using "permanent" components per HG2; I can re-post refernces if you wish.
As I clearly stated previously any tugs are only intended for station keeping
and even then only if the ref isn\'t flexible enough to imagine "attitude jet"
scale maneuver drive elements.

  No, I stored it in perfectly legal - and _cheap_ containers per HG2. Is it
really the latter point that aggravates you?

...
>No, I\'m not.  You\'re saying you can have a small core with lots of rock
tanks around it and stay legal even though you violate the 2% bridge rule.
I\'m saying you can\'t, not as a permenant structure.  I specified a moveable
station, designed as a nonstarship, that would ferry fuel out to the jump
point in reasonable time frames.  I even based it on your hollow rocks.  I
just didn\'t look for any quasilegal loopholes to jam them through.

 i) No: the station has a legal 2% bridge. Did you check - or read? - the
design?
 ii) I\'m sorry - I must have missed your specifying an uneconomic parameter for
such a station. Could you please direct me to the archive of said original post?
In any case, you still seem unable to meaningfully address the downsides of a
workable service/fuel station. If you feel up to it, you could check my designs
and look for any genuine illegalities in them for me to correct/address.

Sorry to come down so hard on a typographical error.  (I\'d thought that
David had cut and pasted the title.)  It\'s a good article, all right. 
We\'ll have to reconsider the tech level of certain neural weapons.

OK, I was under the impression you were gonna park the stations at a gas 
giant.  So where do you park \'em?  It\'s easier to fill the damned things up in 
orbit and fly them out to the jump limit from an engineering point of view.  
Less stuff flying around means less things that can go wrong.  Course, if 
something *does* go wrong, it\'s gonna cost ya bigtime...

I\'m still trying to figure out how you come up with the scatterbrained idea 
that I specified 6G accel for the big stations.  This one\'s got me baffled, as 
I *specifically* calced the \'Potato\' as a 1 g craft.  Think of it as a fuel 
tender if you don\'t wanna think of it as a fuel station.

Considering I don\'t *have* an economic model.  I simply maintained that a 400 
ton ship *and* a fueling station costs more than a 400 ton ship by itself.  
You keep trying to convince me differently.  Tell ya what.  If you *can*, I\'ll 
call Clinton\'s replacement and recommend you for Greenspan\'s job.

I\'ll stipulate station-keeping thrusters.  Hell, I\'ll throw \'em in for free.  
What I don\'t buy is that station-keeping thrusters can move a 50KT rock (i.e., 
my \'Potato\'-class rock station) the needed distance in the needed time.  
Simple physics says no can do.

I just have problems with a core with tankage two orders of magnitude larger

For the core, yeah, it\'s legal.  For the core *PLUS* the tanks?

Show me the full workup on your design.  Oh, & before you ask, I didn\'t post the full workup on *my* design either.

Considering the 3I is a mercantile-based empire, I don\'t see the 3I as having a problem with that.

effect of increasing TL\'s on the price, size, and weight. Striker had some
very nice tables that showed size/wt decreases for a given item as TL
increased, and I\'m not enough of a economist to figure the various pricing
variables for efficiency of manufacture/ distance from world of
manufacture, TL difference, taxes and tariffs, etc. I know the trade rules
cover a little of that for bulk cargoes, but how do some of you handle the
price of everyday items IYTU? By standard book price? Handwave? WAG?
>ALO

This is semi-random thoughts.

As far as I remember the Striker table was about local currencies and their
value vs the Imperial Credit. This makes hi-tech goods more expensive than
their lower-tech functional equivalents - a TL12 jump-3 freighter will cost
less in Imperial Credits than it\'s TL15 equivalent. This may make it more
cost-effective for lugging cargo than it\'s TL15 equivalent, even if it\'s
TL15 equivalent has a bigger cargo bay from it\'s more efficient power plant
etc. This will mean that hi tech worlds concentrate on building hi-tech
things, and import low-tech goods from those worlds, paying with smaller
amounts of neat TL15 toys and guns.

If you assume Imperial pensions are paid in Imperial credits, then many
long-service Imperial Navy personell will be from worlds with \'soft\'
currencies - 4000 credits a year turns into a lot more if your world\'s
currency trades at 10:1 against the Imperial.

Transport costs in the 3I are *cheap* for most manufactured goods. Assume a
KCr 10 vacc suit, that packs into one cubic meter. Ten of those in a 1dton
crate would be worth KCr 100. You could transport that 12 parsecs for about
10% of the cost of the suits.

If you have a copy of Mercenary, it has bulk-buying rules that scale to
most goods.

Taxes and tariffs could be ignored - I have much less of a problem with the
Imperium viewing tariffs by member worlds harshly than something like Far
Traders charging Cr 1500 per jump for cargo. Gurps Trav Far Trader states
that on average Imperial worlds charge 1-6% import tariffs.

In short, if you take the \'book\' costs of goods, figure out their
sourceworld, multiply their cost by the exchange rates for their
sourceworld\'s credits, and then add 1% of value per parsec from the
destination you should be close enough.

It\'s complex but doable.

The following might be wrong, especially the GURPS info.

There have been two sets:

T4
Which had QSDS in the main rulebook, SSDS in the Starships book
and FF&S2 in its own books.
Think Book 2, High Guard and FFS for comparison.
All of these need some errata (available from the web). That for
SSDS completely replaces the printed version.

GURPS
This has a modular design system in the GURPS Traveller book
and a full system in GURPS Vehicles.

For GURPS, I think something like GT:Shipyard is going to provide
a full range of Traveller specific components.

For T4, I expect FF&S3 as part of T5 in the next millennium.

Just store all the information on electronic media. Much of the

genetic tinkering (if your morality allows it), and start a

Well, I can\'t comment on that since I don\'t actually have the books for

All I\'m saying is that your TL7 assumptions are invalid when applied to
TL12 computers.

I have the book, and he is correct that the original intelligent silicon chips
from Cymbeline had to be in pretty much direct contact with their prey
to overwrite it. Note the word, "original".

The virus weapon was based on the Cymbeline lifeform, and it appears
that the scientists added capabilities to it without completely
understanding what they were working with. For example, they gave it
the ability to access the self-modification capabilities of high TL
computers. Thus it could use it\'s predatory capabilities (writing itself
onto new media) against a new prey. Kind of like giving primitive man
a bow, he still hunts but now he can hunt birds as well.

Actually, they won\'t be welded on.  And there really isn\'t any

It\'s not zero, is it?  Remember, you\'re shipping a *LOT* of fuel.  It adds up.

That fuel isn\'t being dumped down a hole - it\'s being sold, either to other
shippers or to other departments of your megacorp*. As long as price per

Those profits will tend to increase (to the limits of demand) as you spend
more on costs (increasing amounts of fuel delivered).

The independent operator generally can\'t offer more reliability or more
ability to absorb liability. He may be able to offer more convenience
or a shipping schedule that\'s friendlier to a small cargo owner, and
I do see cases where those factors should allow the ship owner to charge 
more - say, to take a cargo to a planet that doesn\'t *have* regular 
(and subsidized) liner service.

I think it\'s a matter of gov\'t (and Megacorp) subsidies skewing the laws

In theory, a worm like the Cornell Worm is a program that copies itself to
another computer, then erases itself where it was, thus \'worming\' it\'s way
through the network. Usually, to ensure the wide spreading of itself and
against \'death\' (being copied to a computer that cannot run it), it\'ll copy
itself to several computers before the erasing bit.

Robert Morris\' problem was that his worm copied itself too often, too fast
(due to a bug in the program) and got out of control. It also got _out_...the
first run was to be a test on a select number of computers. It also spread
because the internet used highly uniform software and hardware at the time,
and people hadn\'t thought to worry about stuff like that yet.

A more modern example is the melissa \'virus\'...again, spread due to highly
uniform software and computing platforms. By listening to the news, you would
have thought that Melissa brought the worlds computers to their
knees...actually, only those willing to run a single-source solution,
Microsoft _everything_ were truly susceptible. If you didn\'t use MS Outlook as
your mail client, even if you DID use MS Word as your word processor you were
safe from the destructive effects of the virus. If you didn\'t use MS Exchange
as your mail server on an MS WinNT host, you were spared _some_ of the
carnage, because a Unix box running sendmail scales a heckuva lot better.

Witness the UofA: by all accounts Melissa was _very_ widespread on campus,
every department got hit. But we saw hardly any problems with mail service at
all.  Our College, which does not use either MS OutPuke or Exchange, simply
had to deal with the macro virus problem.

rant/

WHY the _hell_ don\'t they just include a damn software switch in MS Word to
just turn off macro use entirely??? No one uses \'em, at least in Word anymore,
except the virus punks...All I want to to is be able to tell my word processor
(which, BTW, I actually LIKE Word as) that it\'s _not_ a #@$!@*&?&^ compiler or
interpreter, just a mechanism for putting words on paper...dammit!!!

/rant

Contrast this to Microsoft, which had to shut down their corporate network
_completely_ to fix the problem.

obTrav: One thread running through canon is the \'Imperial Data Package\' which
seems to be a huge set of instructions on just about everything from ACR\'s to
Starships. One would presume that Computer programs are a large part of it.
There is a great deal of implied standardization throughout the Imperium.

Contrary to someone else\'s comment regarding Vilani conservatism, an all MS
solution is _just_ what they would do: "No one ever got fired for specifying
IBM". 

A uniform system, top to bottom, running on standardized parts and
standardized software, is _just_ the thing those conservative bean-counters
would see as a valuable thing. It would streamline procurement, make support
significantly easier, faster and cheaper, and standardize training issues
across the Imperium.

Hmmm, sound familiar?

Notice the ones to survive Virus in TNE were the hacked up old Free Traders
running a motley assortment of software and hardware, and having to do most of
the work themselves...

  I happen to suspect that the cheapest thing would be to get water from a
worlds surface - fewer losses to skimming accidents over the years. However,
I assumed that this was not an option for arguments sake - it\'s just too 
easy, and not universally available. GG skimming probably (?) wins overall.

Yes there is.  It is call logic.  Computer operate on logical princples that
is how they are able to do what we tell them.  By simple logic if they are
to do the jobs we want them to do they must follow our instructions.  Those
instrunctions must be understandable to the computer.  Those instruction
they understand are their instructions set.  The exact nature of those
instruct will change over time but they will alway be present because the
computers must deal with human and are made by us to serve us.

As for code and data.  You are saying exactly what I ment.  The computer
will not intentionally try to run what it thinks is data so data is not
executed and sence the information is all data the virus can not run unless
something already in the system knows to run it.  A fith collumnist code in
effect.

Actually id does not do so directly.  It supposes an undiscovered work
arround.  Traveller ship do not travel faster than light they leave this 3d
universe and appear back into it somewhere else without being in all the
space between so they do not really travell.  It\'s a nasty bit os samantics
but it does explain why a ship in jump can\'t be reached and why any such
trip regardless of distance takes about the same amount of time.  The rule
in jump space are just different.  As for thruster plate and antigravity, I
tend to think they are similer work around perhaps based on jump space
physics.  Perhaps thruster plate push against jump space and antigravity
diverts gravity through jump space around what ever it is nulling the
gravity of.  None of this \'breaks\' the rules it gets arround them by
diverting the problem condition to a place where it is not a problem.  This
\'linked to jump space\' could explain why all these technologies seem to
appear togethere given time regardless of what race discovered them.

It\'s a logical assumption.  Most large systems \'boot strap\'.  You car\'s
ignition is the boot strap for it.  The wind up time for jet engines,
printing presses, and assembly line are all forms of boot strapping.  Boot
straping is just a series of things done to get normal operations started.
I\'m fairly sure it will take at least some time for future \'disk drives\' or
their equivalent to \'wind up to speed\' or for their \'heads to seek the right
secter\' or for the system to check it\'s own memory confiruration and see it
the interuption was intentional or an error in code.

\'Never was one so blind as those that will not see\'

A math formula of procedure IS a program dat and instructions. the + is the
instruction for the add function.  The = the command to execute.  The ( and
) define sub routines.  Try righting an american english set of instructions
for somethin that only understand add and subtract for the following.

(2*(46/2)-15)+(7*((pi^9)/13))=

Remember the person you are writting for understands NOTHING except addition
and subtration.  When you are done you will have written a program for a
\'computer\' as the person \'running\' the program will be \'performing
mathamatical and logical operations\'.  People contiuiously think that the
hardware does all the work in a computer.  Most computers have to have a
program to do most higher order math functions correctly.  Those pocket
calculaters were programed!  The program is no burned into their processor
but it is still a program.

So you are another of the \'it\'s so because the book say it\'s so\' types.
Sorry but I an not a limming to blindly follow.  I need to have some
understanding of the underlying logical belief structure to be able to craft
internally consistant adventures.  To much hand waving detract from the game

And were in canon does it say that computers do not require instruction
sets?  IIRC they require programs which are \'sequences of instructions\' if
by profeessor at my engineering colledge was not bady mistaken.  If they
have programs they have instruction set.  One comes with the other.

Prove it.  That is an assumption.  I made a logical deduction from available
data.  In traveller they are call compters, they run programs, they have
programers, programns are \'sequences of instruction\', thus logically
travller computers have instruction set.

You STATE that they do not.  WHere is your proof?  What is your chain of
logic to deduce this conclusion?

AND where is your PROFF that the paradim will change?  Even with all the
improvements we made in the last 5 decades the basic use and implimentation
of logic execution of sequential instructions has not changed.  New and more
efficent combinations of those logical instructions have been but not new
basic paradium has been discovered.  So what is your evidenve that a major
reinvention of logical thought will occure?

OK, but those original computers were designed my men and sence a coputer

not contain anything newer than optimized \'variations on a theme\'.

It would take only minutes at best for a person already trained in logic.
Logic is basic, on implimentations change.  Babage could understand the
concepts of a PC in seconds with only the idea of \'very small on off
switches call transiters\' as his clue.  Pascal might not even need that
explained.  Disks, easy, \'magnetic writing and reading of binary states\'.
Once the basic concepts are understood method becomes only a special effect.
With the handbook on the hardware and the CPUs manual incuding instruction
set I can write code for ANY computer.  That is what I do everyday.

Yep, but we are talking different HOWs.  You are talking the physical

Actually this is being done today with some newer algorithims and arcatypes.
It is posible to do this but the logic structures behind them are bysanteen
in the extreme.  You\'d see some of this in \'fuzzy logic\' systems and in
massively parrell systems but we are only starting to exploit these logic
structures.  Again these are only extrapolations of basic logic.  The basic
pardium is the same it just includes \'a new implimentation of feedback to
shorten the loop\'.  That\'s in quotes becauses it the closest analogy I can
manage.  I have not work with this structure as I do not work with either
massively parralell systems of systems large enough to devide resources to
simulate this effectively.  What it comes down to is synergy, the whole is
greater that the some of it\'s parts.  Again this is a macro effect and not a
change in basic structure as these system are run on standard computer
systems.  As you said it\'s the HOW not the what.  The what (the computer)
has not changed.

OF course it is sure.  It\'s the autonomic nerviuos system!  Do you have to
learn to beat your heart or digest your food or jerk your hand away from
pain?  I\'m not talking about hardwired personalities or anything that high
up.  I\'m talking the boot strap software that any healthy bady has.  Babies
KNOW how to breath, cry, eat, digest, excreet and millions of other
operations far to complex for todays most advanved computers to do all
because it is hard wired into their basic ROM...DNA!  And guess what, it
atomic scale data storage too.  Now that is high tech.!

What good does this do?  You are supposing here.  We KNOW what a computers
function is.  Structure ALWAYS follows function.  Instead of supposing lets
try deduction.

Exactly wrong.  A computer by your own difinition performs \'mathamatical and
logical functions\'.  That fixes \'what\' it does.  By difinition it is a logic
engine.  TL is not relevant.  The mechanics of an OR gate are pretty much
fixed in it definition.  You can overcomlicate it with enificency but it\'s
still an OR gate and that is a logical function.  Form follow function.  Can
you come up with a micro paradium for an OR gate that is truely basicly
diferent and still be an OR gate?  I don\'t think so.  You are tied forever
to logic and math.

Form and fuction.  That is what.  The form maybe in software of hardware but

Very true, that was not how I ment that to come out and it may have drifted
from context.  Let me try this again.

A computer will not make an attempt to execute what it believes to be data
UNLESS something in it\'s instructions tell it to.  So the \'virus\' loaded as
\'data\' from the comm system cannot become active UNLESS some currently
executeable instructions tell the system to try to execute it.  If the
system is properly secured it will be nearly imposible for this to occure.

I never pulled that stunt but I have played hide the code page with page two
video memory on many occation in the old 64k of memory days.

I\'ve also played fast and loose with dos to \'create\' my own dos commands.
It\'s great when the command line interpreter considers everything after a
resevered word as pasted options or stuff to be operated on.  Man that was a
LONG time ago!

Yes, the data overwrote the code due to bad termination of bad data
structuring.  Some other part of the code then tried the excecute the code
that should have been there.  It\'s a fairly old trick.  The real trick is to
find a combination of ascii codes that are also usefull instuctions in the
instruction set of the target system.

Maybe not. I gathered from the article that they still have not built a
working model, and that the current plan is to create a device which is
suitcase-sized. They *expect* that developing technologies will enable the
size to be reduced, but that\'s a long way from a working stunner in every
policeman\'s holster.

The idea is that while the start-up cost for a single 400-ton ship may be
less than a 400-ton ship plus fueling station and its support craft, the
long-term economic benefits of the ship plus fueling station eventually pay
for this, and end up in larger profits for those involved.

Remember, you do not need a fueling station for each and every drop-tank
ship built, just as you do not need one gas station for each and every car
on the road. A fueling station can serve the needs of many ships for a long
period of time (remeber, we are talking about vehicles and facilities that
have operational lifespans of several decades).

>than the core.

So what logic prevents a core with big, free-standing tanks of fuel (not
attached to the station) to be accessed and used at need? This would be the
preferred method to stowage, I would think. Why must the spare drop-tankage
be stored inside the main hull of the station?

You simply do not need this movable station any more than you need mobile
gas stations in the real world. The ships it is servicing can move
themselves, thus they can travel to and from the station. The only movable
things you need are the tugs to transport the unrefined fuel to the station
for processing and storage.

I am beginning to think lot of this argument is caused by rules artifacts
in High Guard and the abuses you can make with them by making assumptions
and extrapolations. Using different rules sets, you will likely get
different results (as was found with PAs and Meson guns in GURPS Traveller).

OT note:

While it\'s been amusing reading this debate, it looks as if it has the
potential to get ugly. I don\'t mean to be a buttinskie (okay, maybe I do)
but let\'s all just step back a sec and take a deep breath (after responding
to my post of course -- I do not want to have the last word).

Unless you guys are *both* having fun sniping at each other, that is. If
that\'s the case, go for it -- although you might want to take it off-list
if it gets too off-topic.

Remember, you can say a lot of sarcastic and mean things to your friends in
the real world and have them be really funny, but the same does not seem to
hold true through the medium of email.

Part of the problem I have is this supposed perminate self modification
ability.  The computers on traveller ships would be general purpose main
frames.  Designed to run what ever was needed.  That would mean that either
they could not be self modifying (because if a program perminately changed
the computer to better run itself then other programs would either not run
at all or run badly or slowly) or if they were self modifying they would
have to have a mechanism to return those cercuits to there orginal
configuration to run diffeerent programs (if the circuits can be reset then
the virus can be purged!).  A hardware based self modifying abilty is
generally reserved for dedecated systems not general purpose systems.  Canon
states that the virus is nearly imposible to get rid of once fulling
invested.  It is posible to have this effect and let the virus \'modify the
system\' without throwing reality out the window.  Check out my virusbeard
declaration and see what you think.  The effects of what I discribed would
be nearly identical to the virus as written in canon.(I do not see any
discrepancies.)  Damned near imposible to get rid of, prone to mutation,
able to infect systems without transponders but only slowly without direct
contact, dormant seed capability, and a good reason for the programer to use
the living chips as a starting point (to exploit the transponder for
comunicating the virus code, as a fortress to attack out of, and the back
door into the main computer to attack through).

well, they claim they can make a large briefcase now, and with some new
laser diode bring it down to the size of a flashlight.  Even without that
though, if they can make it VRF, it would be useful on riot control vehicles.  

As for being an old idea, it\'s in GURPS Ultratech as an electro-laser.  And
UT is at least early 90s.  BTW, UT lists it as GTL9=TTL10-12!  I love it
when reality exceed sci-fi.  Actually, in Ultratech 2, there\'s a subchapter
devoted to the things that were listed as high TL in UT, and already
happened...

This is not a problem if you\'re willing to rethink the materials computers
are made of at higher TL.

The computer core doesn\'t have to be hard-wired silicon. Take some kind
of mutable matrix, make it in massive quantites. Chop a chunk of it off
and put it in a computer as a central core, then run a configuration
and optimization program to set the core up to best use it\'s hardware,
programs and peripherals. Of course, you only intend to run the config 
routine once - but maybe you don\'t get rid of it, maybe you\'ll run it again
two years from now (much like a user of today might reinstall their
operating system to "clean things up a bit"). The config is run from a 
small, dedicated computer - that probably also has one of these high-tech
mutable cores. The peripherals probably have the same cores inside
them as well. All of which would be the ideal environment for Virus.

The need for instructions is true.  However, the assumption that the
instruction set is closed may not be true.  Perhaps a system can create
it\'s own instructions on the fly?  Who knows?

That\'s fine.  I actually misspoke (miswrote?) in the above.  I didn\'t mean
that Turing machines need to be violated, only bypassed.  Just as we now
know that TM>CFG>FA, perhaps someday we\'ll discover some computing approach
that is more powerful than a Turing Machine.  (BTW, for non CS-people out
there, a CFG is a Context-Free Grammar, and an FA is a finite automata.
Both of these are computing models that are weaker (and are subsets of) the
Turing Machine model)

True for most (not all!) TL7 computers.  So what?  It doesn\'t matter if the
program is hardware or software.  I\'m not sure where you are going with
this thought.

No, actually I\'m not.  I do try to analyze and figure out what I can.  I\'m
just willing to accept that some things are five TLs above me and are not
understandable, except in their effects.  I daresay that a caveman might be
able to figure out how to drive a car.  I doubt that he can figure out how
it works, without extensive instruction from a GTL6 sophont.

No.  You just made an assumption that TL12 programs work the same as TL7
programs.  It doesn\'t say anywhere that they don\'t, but it doesn\'t say that
they do, either.  The effects we see seem to suggest that they don\'t.

I\'m not arguing against your chain of logic.  It\'s fine and correct.  I\'m
arguing against your _assumptions_.  Your (quite excellent) arguments are
based on assumptions that I don\'t agree with.

Since major re-inventions of most fields of math and science occur at least
every GTL or so.  90% of all computer development happened during GTL7.
(another 5% happened at very late 6, and another 5% at very early 8)
Within a TL, things should work on the same principles, getting slightly
better, but staying pretty much the same.  This may even be true across two

Not necessarily true, if the computers were complex enough.  Just like
Karnegie and Ritchie (two of the creators of the C programming language)
couldn\'t have predicted all the possible programs written in C, the
creators of the original machines may not be able to predict all of the
results of their creations, either.

No.  The what is the effect.  In Verne it was the ability to go underwater.
 In this thread it\'s the ability to perform certain tasks very efficiently.
 That\'s all that we can assume about TL12 computers.

No, I\'m saying that the underlying logic (boolean algebra, Turing Machines,

how, not the what.

I\'ve never heard of this defeating the NP-complete problem.  Parallel
systems don\'t defeat it, they still require an NP number of iterations,
just spread over multiple machines.  I don\'t know about fuzzy logic.

Again, you are mixing the how and the what.  Our ability to do all those
autonomic things is the what.  Whether it acts anything like a computer is
the how.  We don\'t know anything at all about the how.  (well, very little
anyway.)

Structure does not always follow function.  As for the supposing, I\'m

True.  But not necessarily to the logic or math we use now.  Both may
evolve beyond recognition.  Before Euclid no one had formal geometry.
Before Newton nobody could do Calculus.  Before Lobatchevski everyone knew
that Euclid was correct.  Before Turing (or Babage, or Pascal.  Take your
pick) noone knew about Turing machines.  Imagine what we can do in another
3000 years.

Form does not necessarily follow function.  It just tends to happen that
way.  That\'s why we have things like the iMac, which looks more like steam
iron than a computer.  (Yes, I know, I\'m being silly.  But I couldn\'t resist.)

"Much easier" is debatable. The Kuiper belt is a looong way out:
It\'s much too far for interstellar merchants who have to meet the
next mortgage payment. Most objects you can find are smaller than
golf balls: those that are big enough to be worth sending into
the inner system are rarities. Maybe you can kick a skyscraper
sized object hard enough that it will fall into the inner system
in a couple of decades instead of the couple of millennia it
would ordinarily take, but things the size of Mt. Whatever are
not that much easier to push around. It may take weeks to make a
"strike" and it\'s cold and dark and lonely enough out there that
insanity is a major occupational hazard.  (A well-adjusted kuiper
belter is already insane by most standards anyway)

I got the impression that McClellan was assured of his own
competence. He probably understood military theory and technique
better than any other Northern commander. After the war, Lee
considered him his most able opponent.  His great weakness was that he was
too cautious and not aggressive enough. No matter how careful his
preparations, they were never quite enough, and Lee was always spoiling his
careful plans. In his presidential campaign, McClellan thought the war was
unwinnable. I get the impresseion that he neither blamed himself nor
thought anyone else could do better.

Ob Traveller: A stupid little rebellion of half a dozen worlds that the
Empire should quash easily has dragged on for months, because the rebel
commander has made a parade of admirals look incompetent.  The Sector duke
is looking for someone, anyone, who can win a battle with a clear advantage
in material.

Keven, if Traveller had had a rule for calculating the gravity of a world
and one day you plugged in the numbers for Earth and came up with a figure
of 0.1G, would you consider anyone who insisted that Earth\'s gravity was
1G to be playing by house rules?
 
Well, the flat-rate-for-all-jumps-regardless-of-distance rule is the
economic equivalent of a gravitational field that grows less the closer
you are to a planet. If you insist on sticking to that, then by all means
do so, but let\'s agree to disagree, OK?

Not necessarily...for instance, if they wish to use the buildings as
collateral for a loan, they almost certainly will _not_ depreciate
them... unless they\'re playing fast and loose with the rules of
generally accepted accounting practice.

After all, \'twas shenanigans like that that got our dear, unlamented
ex-governor convicted on fraud charges.

They\'ll certainly depreciate the _insides_ of the buildings, but
buildings, like homes, are assumed to appreciate and depreciate per the
existing real estate market.

Heck, back in the 60s, Walt & Leigh Richmond came up with a man
portable gizmo along those lines. It was intended as something that
could slip past customs and then later be assembled into a weapon good
enough to take better weapons from the government forces. 

Part one was a motorized squirt gun, obviously a toy. Slightly odd in
that it shot a pair of streams, not just one. Only close examination
would note that each stream had an independent reservoir and pump. 

Add a few simple components, and a bigger battery (all of which fit
into "decorative" spaces on the "toy" gun). 

The result? A stun pistol. The *salt* water streams carry a few
kilovolts. And range 30-50 feet. Though they were mostly used at much
shorter range.

Press the button, the streams hit the victim and he goes down quivering
until you clobber him and take his gun. Pass the squirter back to
another rebel and keep advancing.

They have a switch to turn off "autoexecute" macros, which are the big
problem. But it defaults to "on".

And a lot of people *do* use macros.

The problem is that MS decided that rather than expand the
then-existing macro language(s) in their various products, it was
"simpler" to replace them with the Visual Basic "core". So now the
macro language is *far* too powerful, and has tons of unneeded
functionality. But they\'ve reduced the amount of code they need to
support and "made it easier" by having a uniform command set.

Or to setups like mine. I\'m running a text only mail/news readrer
(written in Pascal!). I\'ve received copies of Happy99.exe several
times. I used a standalone MIME decoder convert the "attachment" into a
file. Then I saved a copy in my "virus zoo".

Actually, as far as PCs go, that hasn\'t been true since shortly after
the PS/2 was released.

If you\'ve got a GG with a fairly *new* ring system (like Saturn), then
you can use ice chunks from there.

If you\'ve got an asteroid belt past the "ice line" (the distance from
the star where sub km chunks of ice are long term stable) then that\'s a
good choice, as it *will* have a fair number of ice chunks (and few
carbonaceous chondrites).

If you go out to the Kuiper belt, sure they\'ll be far apart. But ypu\'ll
also be about to find *big* chunks. They\'ll be rarer, but easier to
find. 

A simple ion drive or mass driver can be installed on them and they\'ll
head in-system. It\'ll take *decades* if not a century or two. But it\'ll
also take that sort of time scale to use them up. 

And in the meantime you keep working on putting them into a more
convenient orbit (mostly by moving in the apoapsis).

And if you\'ve got people busily refining the ice, the "waste" they dump
overboard (mostly rock dust) will make a decent, if not spectactular
comet tail, making them *easy* to see.

I say refining, because, since you\'d need a few people to tend to the
drive, you might as well have a few more and have them process the ice.
They\'ll have a nice place to live for quite a few years (lots of the
hard to find life support chemicals like nitrogen). And they can use a
mass driver to boost refined "ice" into orbits that\'ll get it to the
inner system much faster. And help bring the body into the desired
orbit. 

Heck, I wouldn\'t be surprised to see such "ice miners" also growing
enough food to export!

Err, hidden in Word 97\'s options is a tick box which lets you have the
option to switch off macro\'s on files you open...

Ugh.

After midday, the world got a lot quieter, the sun dimmed and the man
banging the drum in my head went away...

Suffice it to say, I don\'t usually drink cider (probably as it seems to be
an alcohol delivery system which hides the kick in the fruit huice).

Hmmm....

I think your pinkie was a little eager on the 0 key <g>, nearer *30*
years in actual fact.

I got this from the Mary Rose web site....
( http://www.maryrose.org/ )

<quote>

The Mary Rose is the only 16th century warship on display anywhere in
the world. Built between 1509 and 1511, she was one of the first ships
able to fire a broadside, and was a firm favourite of King Henry VIII.
After a long and successful career, she sank accidentally during an
engagement with the French fleet in 1545. Her rediscovery and raising
were seminal events in the history of nautical archaeology.

</quote>

I visited the exhibition in Portsmouth while studying a unit on
Maritime Archaeology at Southampton Uni. in the early \'90s....very
impressive <g>.

 In theory, a worm like the Cornell Worm is a program that copies itself to
 another computer, then erases itself where it was, thus \'worming\' it\'s way
 through the network. Usually, to ensure the wide spreading of itself and
 against \'death\' (being copied to a computer that cannot run it), it\'ll copy
 itself to several computers before the erasing bit.

xxxx
Ah, okay, I see, how does it copy its self to another computer (does it need 
some one to kick start it)?
xxxx
 
 Robert Morris\' problem was that his worm copied itself too often, too fast
 (due to a bug in the program) and got out of control. It also got _out_...the
 first run was to be a test on a select number of computers. It also spread
 because the internet used highly uniform software and hardware at the time,
 and people hadn\'t thought to worry about stuff like that yet.

xxxx
"Uh-oh"
"What do you mean \'uh-oh?\'"

 A more modern example is the melissa \'virus\'...again, spread due to highly
 uniform software and computing platforms. By listening to the news, you would
 have thought that Melissa brought the worlds computers to their
 knees...actually, only those willing to run a single-source solution,
 Microsoft _everything_ were truly susceptible. If you didn\'t use MS Outlook 
as
 your mail client, even if you DID use MS Word as your word processor you were
 safe from the destructive effects of the virus. If you didn\'t use MS Exchange
 as your mail server on an MS WinNT host, you were spared _some_ of the
 carnage, because a Unix box running sendmail scales a heckuva lot better.

xxxx
Well, I get away from all of the Microsh!t that I can, to many problems.
xxxx
 
 Witness the UofA: by all accounts Melissa was _very_ widespread on campus,
 every department got hit. But we saw hardly any problems with mail service at
 all.  Our College, which does not use either MS OutPuke or Exchange, simply
 had to deal with the macro virus problem.

 WHY the _hell_ don\'t they just include a damn software switch in MS Word to
 just turn off macro use entirely??? No one uses \'em, at least in Word 
anymore,
 except the virus punks...All I want to to is be able to tell my word

 (which, BTW, I actually LIKE Word as) that it\'s _not_ a #@$!@*&?&^ compiler 
or
 interpreter, just a mechanism for putting words on paper...dammit!!!

The want to sell it to you by its self...

 Contrast this to Microsoft, which had to shut down their corporate network
 _completely_ to fix the problem.

Hehehe

 obTrav: One thread running through canon is the \'Imperial Data Package\' which
 seems to be a huge set of instructions on just about everything from ACR\'s to
 Starships. One would presume that Computer programs are a large part of it.
 There is a great deal of implied standardization throughout the Imperium.
 
 Contrary to someone else\'s comment regarding Vilani conservatism, an all MS
 solution is _just_ what they would do: "No one ever got fired for specifying
 IBM". 
 
 A uniform system, top to bottom, running on standardized parts and
 standardized software, is _just_ the thing those conservative bean-counters
 would see as a valuable thing. It would streamline procurement, make support
 significantly easier, faster and cheaper, and standardize training issues
 across the Imperium.
 
 Hmmm, sound familiar?

Yeah...but there are some computer controlled shipboard functions that
just *can\'t* be manually overridden (except by just shutting the
offending system down <g>)
eg Power Plant, Jump Drive etc.  These systems require input or
adjustments in such a rapid timeframe that it would be impossible to
manually control them

IMTU, TMMV

     The original 5150 IBM PC did not come with a 128 byte 5 1/4" floppy drive.
It used audio cassette tapes.  A special cord connected a port on the
system to a standard cassette player/recorder.

     An old friend who enjoyed composing music for the PC\'s paper speaker
even had some of her tunes accessing the cassette as a percussion device.

<curmudgeon mode on>
In the old days, youngster, the only storage for personal computers was
paper tape (which required expensive surpulus paper tape readers and
punches) or cassette tape (as in standard household tape recorders). 

300 baud was about standard. About the time floppies started to become
somewhat affordable (I was glad to pay *only* $150 for a drive!) data
rates for tapes got somewhat better. Say 1500 baud. 

I have a *lot* of old cassette tapes in a box in the bedroom, as well
as a cassette recorder that\'s "optimized" for computer use. 

You young whiuppersnappers just have no appreciation for things...

Sorry, canon problem here.  This technology exists today.  The problem is in
order to run the config more than once you need to be able to reset the core
to it\'s original unconfigured pattern.  The reason is that you create the
configuration by eliminating posible curcuit paths untill you have the
pattern you want.  To reconfigure the circuits you must first restore the
\'unused\' paths you removed in the first time though (if it is a configure
more than once model.)  You are reseting the system.  This would wipe out
the virus in a way it could not defend against.  The virus, according to
canon, is much harder to get rid of than that.  Also with this functionality
fighting the virus would be a cake walk.  You set up a recursive self
replicating pattern killing routine that guts the virus as it tries to take
over the system.  You even have a readily obtainable master key to use in
targeting this overwatch program.  While the system you perpose would be
easy for the virus to concure in would be easily \'virus proofed\' by even a
doofer of a system operater.  Open button super reset!  Then reconfigure in
an easy to deduce virus proof configuration.  It even rids you of the danger
of \'seeds\', reconfigure everything at the same time using your factory
provided ROM utility disk that is not writable so is 100% virus proof!  
"Viruses, we don\'t worry about eenniee siiiinkiingg viirruuussssseeesssss!"

Also, reconfigurable systems like these can not be at the cutting edge as
far as speed and efficency.  They will be a good bit slower with less
features and fewer bells and whisles.  They will be much larger than a
compatable purpose built system and depending on market forces a little or a
lot more expensive depening on production quantities.  As the old saying
goes, Jack off all trades master of none.

On the plus side fixing compatability problems would be quick and easy and
emergency repairs could be made easily by reconfiguring non vital cores to
replace lost vital cores using your factory provided configuration ROMs.
Such a design would be good for long durtation ships where the higher cost
and greater space requirement are balenced against greater interchanability.

Military front line ships would have some of these reconfigurable units or a
good stock of spare specialty units to replace lost specialised units AFTER
the battle and multiply redundant armored and hardened dedicated SOTA
primary systems (black boxes).

Of course they can.  Current systems can do that now but those instruction
are not perminate.  They are \'lost\' during power on reset.  It is posible to
build a system that could retain those create codes but what would be the
point in s general purpose mainframe?  It could be much more efficent and a
much more secure system to store those specialty codes in the ROM based
programs and load those needed for each program as it is needed.

Just because something can be done does not mean that is should be done or
will be done.

True, that was part of my point.  You HAVE to know the target system.  The
only way the virus could work the way it works in canon is if a stardarized
cross compiler based language and a standardise OS were the rule 3I wide.
Then hardware incompatability becomes a mute point.

I\'m hoping for a massive library of pretested algorithims combined with a
voice interfaced expert system useing a natural language programing method.
The expert system would take the discription of the program and best guess
it from it\'s own experience and then run all posible flow paths until all
unexceptable termination had been detected and fixed.  The result is then
handed back the the operater for \'look and feel\' modifications.  The process
is repeated untill the final product is achieved at which the expert system
optomises the code and creates a source code that can be compiled by an
optomising compiler for the target platform.

It makes a great deal of difference what functionality is hard coded and
software but that is not the point.  The point is (and the reference in that
quote you took offense to, none was intended) was the the definition of
\'computer\' fixes it structure.  It has to by definition have an fixed
instruction set containing curtain functionallity to qualify for the term
computer.  It also has to be logic base according to the definition sence it
must be able to do logical operations.  All of this fixes the nature of the
thing called a computer.  Your own definition proves my point that was the
meaning of the quote.

Agreed, but a computer is defined by what is does not what it is made of.
There are computers built out of gears.  The definition define a collection
of functions.  Form alway follows function.

Programs are by definition \'logical sequences of instructions\'.  So if TL12
computers (by your definition, a math and logic processing device) run
programs (by definition, logical sequences of instructions) then TL12
computer ARE just more advanced versions of today computers and by simple
extrapolation their nature can be logically deduced.

This is not a logical responce.  You say that future computers might not

Posibly, but the problem to be solve will be defined by men and computers
are notoriously unimaginative so it would take some \'outside force\' to drive
a leap of technological power by a computer designer.   Outside inspiration
as it were or a pure change occurence.  Perhaps a \'bug\' in the original

Can you PROVE that?  Are you saying that with the technical data a TL7

computer may have so very powerful help systems inculded or even expert

Based on the definition you provided there is a lot I can say about those
TL12 computers.  If they understand English I could quickly learn to do
basic programing as I already know many of the operaters like + and -.

If you understsand that and your definition is that a computer \'performs
logical and mathamatical operations\' then why do you say they are not
understandable?  You have a conplete subset of command instruction in thos
two operational sets.  I\'ve written many programs and many more subroutines
using only these operaters and raw data.

Not accordining to your definition, \'perform mathamatical and logical

Yes and no.  They can very greatly reduce interations by critical path and
sucessive approximations.  It is not a direct math calculation.  It works a
little like graphing does for a human being.  It lets a computer project a
closer answer sooner.  There are many more methods that are far harder to
discribe and matching methods to problems is a science unto itself if it can
be call a science.  I\'m a applied scientist.  A lot of these new method are
only a little while out of the research labs.  Some are still in the
research phase.  I have seen enough in the area of modeling of life
(biomophics IIRC) that I was impressed with the \'insight\' of the arificial
animals.

I think we may be saying the same thing and this is a matter of somantics.
If the structure of computer remains basicly the same only
faster/smaller/more megfops while better programs improve total preformance
by better use of those resources then what I\'ve been saying about the virus
would be true.  The virus must attack at the micro level to do what canon
says it does UNLESS as I said in my Virus beard post it attacks at the
intermediate level.  At the micro level you have code compatability problems
out the yingyang.  If the level of standardisation I sujested in the
virusbeard post were impimented the virus would have a chance.  The problem
of the low level attack is that the virus in one machine would have not idea
how to do anything in the next machine it had to attack.  This is one reason
all the great virus scares in RL fizzle.  One virus can make the jump to
very different systems but with the common ground of a common language even
if it has to be recompiled it has a foot in the door.  With the help of a
back door like the transponder it can kick proceessor!

Not true, you were talking about \'boot straping\' I was just saying that
humans do \'boot strap\' in their own fashion.  The autonomic nervious system
is our boot strap system and our low level operating system.  It fills the
\'nitch\' of those systems.  If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and
quack like a duck, it probably a duck.

Can you provide any example where form does not follow function that

How?  Is 1 + 1 not going to equal 2?  Is 1 and 1 not going to be 1?

Before Euclid no one build a house with the roof point down either.  He
formalised many things but people still had a good idea of what building
shapes were stable enough to work.

We can\'t project what has yet be concieved.  Trying to say that things WILL
change in ways we can not concieve is in violation of all logic.  We can not
discuss it.  We can not predict it.  So using the posbility as justification
for your point of view is not supportable.  It is equally likely that some
developement will make computers redundant.  They would have NO place in the
traveller universe then.  Or perhaps magic will be discovered and we can all
teleport were ever in the universe we want to go instantly and effortlessly.
It is just as logical to assume this great change will remove the need for
computers.  Traveller is supposed to be fairly hard SF not science fantacy.
Let\'s say in the realm to logical progress, deductive reasoning, and
reasonable extrapolation for currently available data.  No one can predict
when and if one of these world changes will occure.  Discussing them is
pointless.

Hey!  How did they get my merchant captain\'s mustering out ship?!?!
Seriously I got a 5000kt merchant as a mustering out bonus (I forget how
many ship roles it was) but it only had a free trader worth of working
componets.  It had J3 drive but due to drive and computer problems it could
only do a J1 and used 150% of the normal fuel required for a J1.  You do NOT
want to know about the plumbing problems! Do not flush the toilet in the
forward head while the cook is running the dish washer!!!  It was a real
money pit for the first few years but one nice this was that the only
missjump that it\'s pour old engines could manages was it used the fuel but
did not jump.  We never did figure that one out...but the main food frezzer
got REAL serious cold when that happened.

back though some old cumper stuff and did a little digging pluss a little
head scratching.  I think there is a reasonable way to explain the virus and
canon and make it all work within reasonable bounds and with minimal handwave.

So load your Traveller canons and see what holes you can poke in this.



Point 1) The 3I is big, REAL BIG!

Point 2) The 3I would need to have curtain standards to regulate trade, like
transponders.

Point 3) Because of point 1, point 2, and because ships travel great
distances and may need repair some standarization in computers will be required.

Point 4) Because of the long night and various specific needs all computers
can\'t use identical parts and sub systems.

Point 5) Softwares writer want as big a market as posible for their products.

Point 6) Customers want access to as many products and choices as posible.

Conclussion 1) From all the points above, a universal language.  Let\'s call
it IC for Imperial C.  (One reason C is so big today is it\'s standardization
and cross compilability)

Conclusion 2) From all above, a univeral standard framework for IO to allow
divers to be writen for IO and progams to access this IO.  Let\'s call it
IDOS.  It is a set of basic IO routines writen in IC.  (Unix has been cross
compiled onto many different computers from PC to mainframes).  The user can
choose a front end like Itouch, Italk, or Iwindows so he does not have to
learn Idos or IC to just run the programs he needs and of course there are
language and console modules for all major races and most minor ones.  The
dolphin console is rated for 100 meters in depth.

Effect 1) All computer makers have to do is provide a compiler for IC to
compile to their processor and system and anybody can recompile any source
code to run on their system.  This lets small companies have a foot into a
BIG market.

Effect 2) All programers can write code that can run (after compiling) on
any machine with a IC compiler.  This let\'s \'Joe code cruncher\' write for a
HUGE market.  All code is sold as copyrighted source code on ROM disks that
has to be compiled to run on the target system.

Effect 3) Consumers get diversity and compatability.

Effect 4) Components manufacturers need only write one IC driver for their
hard ware to sell their product to add to any computer system (with a
standard interface like the USB starting up now or like the centronics
standard for printers or the novel network for about everybody).  So Sence
Tech\'s sensors are \'plug and play\' with Rue computers model 1 FIB and it is
compatable with Blaser-R-US\' laser canon and all of them can be integrated
together of cause precision aimed mayhem with \'Joe code crunchers\' Gunner
interact-1.  PROFIT FOR EVERBODY! and \'MR. Fixit\' on Rigil can tune it up
with his standard dianostics package and Captain Hornblower of the Destroyer
Vigalence can use his querry software to make sure nothing unautherized has
been done like hiding so recreational pharmicuticals in the lasing tube..."I
know you wouldn\'t do that Gunner so you won\'t mind if I take remote control
at test fire that laser now would you?\'

EFFECT 4) A universal language that the virus can use to take control of any
computer by compiling inself into that system with the manufacture provide
compiler!

How 1)  Some bright puppies in the 3Is electronic warfare section see all
this nice standardisation and get the idea that a \'ship killer virus\' would
be a great way to easily put down a rebellion.

Problem 1) Most ship\'s captains are paranoid and keep their computers lock
down tight against normal com trafic.

Obsevation 1) The transponder has direct access to the computer!  Lets talk
to those bright boys that built that \'unbeatable\' transponder.  

What?!  A life form!  How do we that thing to get our virus into the target
computer?  OH! they have preditors on that world also...and they are
naturally aggressive too?...and they are basicly computers too?...well we
might be on to something here.  

What if we lobodomised those preditors leaving them dumb and mean and then
taught them IC?  They would not be able to \'EAT\' the mainframes but they
could take them over...OH! you say the could \'EAT\' the transponder and use
it for their \'core\' to attack other systems untill it broke the security and
could overwrite IDOS and once that happened the operaters would have no way
back into the system...Good Good but wouldn\'t a complete purge fix
that?...OH!  The transponder of course...and sleeper codes tacked onto any
write accessable executable by the infected compiler...including any
unsecured smart terminal and portables.  

And you say the sleeper code could reassemble itself over time using a
packet sequencing system...but wouldn\'t that be a much less efficent vector
and make it more likely that the code could be corrupted or mutated?...Oh,
it\'s only a backup system then, that should be ok.

What if they powered down, killed the transponder, wiped all storage media
except the original ROMs, and then did a complete rebuild?...It would take
HOW LONG!?!?...and they would loose all their records because the
incremental backups would be infected when IDOS was infected sence it
schedules the backups...and only computer-4+s are sufficently experienced to
feel confident to try that proceedure outside a class A or B starport.

Sounds like we have a failsafe system to stop a rebelion or a military coup.
The 3I will be free from the danger of Empirerers of the Flag...Just one
question, How do we stop it?  Oh, a delet code.  Sounds good but what if
this virus mutates in that packet recombination thing so that the code
doesn\'t work?...I see, end of the universe kind of thing...Not good, that\'s
a problem.  Oh, the odds of that happening are less than of a particular
star going nova on any particular day.  Well, if we were only to used it as
an absolutely last line of defence to save the 3I from distruction then if
it ran amoke we\'d be in no worse shape than if we had lost and maybe knowing
what was going to happen we could recover before our enemy...

Ok, the project is approved.  We\'ll finance it through the gold plated
freasher fund.  Give it the hightest security rating AND need-to-know.


So, any canon flaws?  What about technical problems?

In the US, that\'s called "hard cider". I\'ve had it, after pressing the
apples myself. Not bad. If you *really* want fun, try applejack. That\'s
"hard cider" that\'s been allowed to partially freeze and then had the
ice filtered out. Repeat several times and you\'ve got something as
potent as any brandy.

Just remember that whether or not a gene is "bad" is a matter of
*local* conditions. You\'ll need to carry records of *all* known
variations. 

Why? Well consider the classic example. Sickle cell anemia. It\'s a
recessive. So if you get it from both parents, you die younfg and
rather painfully due to the misshapen red blood cells. 

So why is it *common* in much of Africa? 

Well, if you have it from only *one* parent, your red blood cells are
only a tiny bit different from normal. But that "tiny bit" is enough to
confer near total immunity to malaria!

So in *that* environment, getting it from both parents kills you from
sickle cell. But getting it from *neither* parent kills you from
malaria. Only the 50% who get it from *one* parent are going to survive
to reproduce. 

This sort of thing is why any *intelligent* genetic screening will only
screen to prevent zygotes where "bad" genes are paired up. Ones with a
recessive "bad" gene will be left alone, just in case they wind up
being useful for something. 

This could be used to advantage in a campaign. Say there\'s something on
a planet that makes being a "carrier" of something nasty like cystic
fibrosis a *good* thing. 

As a matter of fact, I recall reading that CF as a recessive *is* good
for something, but I don\'t recall what. Probably an "atmospheric taint"
situation.

 I got the impression that McClellan was assured of his own
 competence. He probably understood military theory and technique
 better than any other Northern commander. After the war, Lee
 considered him his most able opponent.  His great weakness was that he was
 too cautious and not aggressive enough. No matter how careful his
 preparations, they were never quite enough, and Lee was always spoiling his
 careful plans. In his presidential campaign, McClellan thought the war was
 unwinnable. I get the impresseion that he neither blamed himself nor
 thought anyone else could do better. >>

You are both right. McClellan should have been made chief of staff of the US 
army, under an aggresive general like Hancock or Reynolds, or Kearney, or 
Reno early on, and certainly he would have been kept by Grant when he came 
east (Grant would have appreciated McClellan\'s organizational skills). He was 
charismatic and beloved by the troops. He was however, VERY egocentric. He 
thought he was the next Napoleon, and he snubbed Lincoln and held him in 
contempt. I doubt he would have recommended that he not be given command. I 
also doubt that Lee considered him his best opponent. One of Lee\'s great 
abilities was his judgement of his opponents character and ability. He knew 
most of his opponents from West Point on and remembered how they performed in 
Mexico. This allowed him to decide he could get away with Jackson\'s flank 
march at Chancellorsville, and his abandoning of the Richmond defenses after 
the Seven Day\'s campaign to crush Pope at Second Bull Run. He knew he could 
divide his forces against superior forces (normally a BIG no no) as he knew 
Pope, McClellan and Hooker were slow. This was an ability Marshall shared 
with him (to judge men). Lee would have been a terrifying poker player if he 
gambled...I would think that Lee would have considered Grant his best 
opponent (battlefield grand tactics aside...). Grant was able to 
conceptuallize large campaigns better than anyone else, even Lee. Lee was 
fixated on defending Virginia to the detriment of the rest of the 
Confederacy. While Washington and Richmond made the East politically 
important; the west was where the war was won. Imagine Lee going to Tennessee 
with two Corps from the ANV (with Longstreet guarding Richmond); Grant would 
have had a lot more trouble taking Vicksburg. Grant\'s Vicksburg campaign was 
brilliant. He marched south of Vicksburg, crossed the Missisisippi, and 
fought and won five battles in rapid succession, against superior numbers (he 
used road nets to gain interior lines and defeat in detail). In the East, 
while Grant\'s battlefield tactics were unimpressive, his strategy was 
flawless. He rightly recognized after the Wilderness that the ANV was the 
target, not Virginia. When he marched south, rather than retreating back 
north; the Army of the Potomac\'s morale soared...He knew that if he put 
pressure on Richmond via Petersburg, the ANV would stay put, and allow 
Sherman and Thomas to come up the back door (allowed by the capture of the 
Mississippi and Vicksburg). He knew the Army of the Potomac was a spent 
weapon; it\'s best men either dead, gone home with expired enlistments, or 
with Sherman (the 20th. Corps fought very well, despite it\'s miserable record 
as the 11th. Corps in the AOP), or in the valley under Sheridan. Despite the 
Cold Harbor blunder, and Lee\'s battlefield brilliance, the result was a 
foregone conclusion...It\'s also interesting that the men of the Army voted 
for Lincoln rather than McClellan in 1864. They wanted to WIN, and despite 
their love for "little Mac", they knew he was no leader...

To me that is why drop tanks should never have been introduced
in the first place.  They had a fundamental limitations and then
the start putting in cute little gadgets that mess with them
without considering the consequences.

We can spot the larger Kuiper objects from the Earth today and
a 1-G ships (which won\'t have much trouble catching up to such
object) is pretty cheap relative to a starship and can push
in many times it size.  Remember the alternative is using
a starship to hual the stuff up from the ground.

Well, while we agree the drop tanks are a bad idea, we certainly
haven\'t been shy about disagreeing with other things :-).  However,
I will have to wait and see what disagreement he has, if any, on
this.

Don\'t think "eliminate", think "generate". The matrix is a nearly
undifferentiated medium at start, the configuration equipment creates
3D "circuits" (or the equivalent) in the medium. Resetting it to unconfigured

diagnostic gear you\'re using is infected as well? Sure, your CompTech
kit will tell you you\'ve reset the system, but did you really?

And even if you have reset the core, how do you rebuild the system without
reinfecting it? Since it takes a computer to config the computer, you\'re still 
at the mercy of the technology.

Virus is running the system. It will accept the calls to run your pattern

There is no "factory setting", not in the usual sense. The configuration
utility has to run as a semi-intelligent process, identifying the computer\'s
environment and creating a custom build to best support that environment.
The configuration tool will probably see it\'s reconfiguration attempts
met by and countered by the Virus during the diagnostic phase (when
information is being sent to the configuration equipment). Result: your
system comes up "Configuration Complete", Virus lays an egg in your
configuration tool.

Charles again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Also, reconfigurable systems like these can not be at the cutting edge as
far as speed and efficency.  They will be a good bit slower with less
features and fewer bells and whisles.  They will be much larger than a

lot more expensive depening on production quantities.  As the old saying
goes, Jack off all trades master of none.

There goes Charles with his GTL 7 expertise again. New technology,
remember?

You never wondered how the same Model/3 computer could support
sensors, maneuver, life support, weaponry and jump plotting in a
Subsidized Liner and a Patrol Cruiser, with no change in size or cost?

Make a billion Model/3 computers. Sell them to every manufacturer who
needs that kind of power. Your economies of scale will blow away the
guy who can make a computer that could only work in a type T Patrol
Cruiser - where he saved 20% by cutting off flexibility, you saved 50%
by building so many of them. His market was one class of ship, built
at one shipyard during one building run. Your market is anything with a
3dTn computer bay that needs to go jump-3.

The computers I\'m envisioning here *will* be purpose built - that\'s what
the configuration/optimization capability is for. Furthermore, when you add
another laser to your turret, the computer will (automatically?) *reconfigure*
itself so it\'s *still* a "purpose built" system for your ship.

It\'s not a jack of all trades, master of none - it\'s a master of whatever trade
you wanted it to do last time you configured it, and better suited to that
trade than anything configged in a factory could ever be.

Charles again:

Military front line ships would have some of these reconfigurable units or a

If these mutable cores were produced in sufficient quantities, you\'ll see
them in everything from Starships to Air Rafts to Fusion Guns - just
smaller and smaller. Sure, maybe the core config on your electric
toothbrush is set at the factory and never intended to change - it\'ll still
use the mutable core material if it\'s the most readily available and 
cheapest computer component. It probably won\'t have a diagnostics 
access jack - it\'s too cheap to fix - but your television set will. By that

I base my 1KCr/ton/jump figure on the rules, which I *interpret* as, long haul freighting is subsidised by *somebody*.  Don\'t know *who*, don\'t *CARE* who.  Why should I worry about how much some megacorp is paying to ship stuff 3 parsecs at a shot when I\'m busy trying to sell what I have in front of me *right now* and trying to make a quick credit on it?

We made an interesting drink some years back at a gaming party.

We were mulling cider - the American apple-juice kind, not the British
alcohol-kind. We had it in a big crockpot, with mulling spice and
lots of cinnamon, it smelled wonderful.

Someone had a minor emergency and we all scooted off to help - forgetting
about the crockpot. Luckily we got back before it burned, but the cider
had rendered down to about an eighth or less of it\'s original volume. 
It was boiling hot, thick like oil - a drop hit the cool tabletop and 
instantly congealed.

Someone had several bottles of ice-cold applejack on hand, I know not
from where. We spent several hours half-filling mugs with the hot cinnamon
apple oil we\'d created, then adding just enough applejack so it was (barely) cool enough to drink.

We called the drinks Hot Cinnamon Jacks. I don\'t have a clear recollection
of how the game went, though...the rest of the evening is kinda fuzzy. :)

Actually, I suspect (for simple reasons of TL limits and the oversized

"Imperial Virtual Machine", and programs being in compressed code for

That is why the merchant wouldn\'t go out there.  You get
some small, cheap interplanetary ship with one or two people
that wanders around out there, put thruster packs on them,
and tosses them in.

Neither is this.  The ones that are huge enough for us to detect
today are probably pretty rare (Pluto and Charon may be Kuiper objects).
If they have a normal distribution in sizes and based on
some recent estimates of the amount of mass out there, they won\'t
be that hard to find.  (Note: there have been estimates that
all the Earth\'s oceans came from such objects hitting the Earth.
This isn\'t popular these days, but one of the big problems is
mostly that Jupiter scavenges them  out before they hit the earth).

Remember, if you can give it a small fraction of a G of accelation
for a week, you can make a major change to its orbit and thrust
is pretty cheap in Traveller.  In GT, just one thruster module
will give a 1000 ton chunck of ice (over 100 dtons of fule)
0.04 G of accel.  That can
give it a 10 km/s change in velocity (more than its orbital
velocity) in less than a day.  (which is way overkill)

We can see the large ones from the Earth.  If you bop up 8
TL\'s and note that travel times at 1 G are quite modest, you
can see how it works.

Well, reason you don\'t design them to stand up to those
stresses is that you don\'t have to (actually, it is easy enough to design
it to stand up to micrometeorites that you would go ahead and do it).
Therefore, the lack of those features doesn\'t make them undependable and
undurable.

My take is that Grant wasn\'t the brilliant tactictian or strategist
that Lee was, he was, however, very competant and was able to
recognize that the North had an clear advantage almost every
area and that any competant plan, resolutely carried out, would
carry the day.  So that is what he did.  He attacked Lee with
solid tatics and eventually Lee just ran out of tricks.

	That "tiny bit" is enough to make you chronically ill,
	but much healthier than you would be if you caught
	malaria.

"So in *that* environment, getting it from both parents kills 
you from sickle cell. But getting it from *neither* parent 
kills you from malaria. Only the 50% who get it from *one*

	50% if both parents have one copy of the sickle-cell 
	gene, the highest frequencies in Africa are about 33%.
	That is, 33% of the genes are sickle-cell ones, 44%
	of the people have one sickle-cell gene, 45% have 2

	get sickle-cell anemia).

"This sort of thing is why any *intelligent* genetic screening

	if your genomes are on file.

"This could be used to advantage in a campaign. Say there\'s

There\'s also a book entitled GURPS Traveller: Starships in progress; I
think that\'s probably what Phil had in mind.  It will include expanded
options for ship design, including new modules and new hull configurations,
but mostly cover lots of "Adventure" class ships, with deckplans (all this
from Chris Thrash\'s solicitation for contributions a week or two ago).

Pardon me if anyone has asked this already (I tend to skip over most of
the starship design number crunching threads), but does anyone know if G:T

AFAIK, it will be stand alone.  GURPS Vehicles is needed to design custom
components, but just GT:S (or for that matter GT) is enough for ones using
standard modules. In T4 terms, think GT=QSDS, GT:S=SSDS, G:VE=FF&S.
(Except that ST:S won\'t be broken at publicaion....)

Then cobble togethere some good old fashioned analog control systems.  Let

Ahh. A Sinclair ZX81 with 1k of RAM was a powerful machine back then. Z80
processor running BASIC as the OS, with the lucky people having a 16k RAM
pack or even an external cassette recorder (optional) which meant you could
keep programs after you switched off. I remember loading 15 min programs
which failed at the end...

The Video Genie (TRS80 clone) with 32kB, and a built in cassette and sound!
was next, then there was a 6 year break before my Atari 1040 STFM with a
built in Disk arrived, followed 3 years later by a 1040 STe with 4Mb RAM
and two disk drives. 2 years after that it was an Apple PowerBook 190 with
20Mb RAM and a 500Mb HDD, followed 18 months later by a PowerMac 6400 (56Mb
RAM and 2.3GB). My updates seem to be getting faster, more expensive but
really don\'t seem to do a lot more. The TRS80/ZX81 where much of a
muchness, but the Mac\'s (and the NT4 box I use at work) don\'t have a
significant edge on my ST - speed and resolution mainly - the GUI is just a
bit more refined.

Funny thing is, I kind of miss the days when I needed to teach myself BASIC
to get the computer to do anything...

Hmm - just to add something to the pot - MT describes high TL computers as
being near AI\'s through the use of synaptic processors, which aren\'t
limited to YES/NO. Couple this to a possibly fluid core (say self
aligning/evolving crystals with a set back up \'fibre\' system for EMP
hardened units) and Virus could be more posible. In addition, it\'s canon
that Traveller ships had multiple high powered computers for different
roles which all talked to each other behind the scenes...

Ouch...

In the UK, apple juice is apple juice, fermented apple juice is cider, and
then you can get Apple brandy...

I still have BASIC on my Dell Pentium.  I wrote a MegaTraveller GM\'s aid
on it.  Plus some Gamma world stuff.

ahhh that takes me back...my first one was an Apple II+ with 64 _whole_
k of memory!!! Woo Hoo!! _two_ floppy disk drives, and a Videx 80 column
card.

That saw me through until I got my trusty ol\' Mac Plus in about \'88 or
so.

I still remember the first time I played with one, it was at the Boston
Computer Society Museum. Just blew my mind. I remember going back home
and trying to write a MacPaint clone for the Apple II...

FYI: I spoke to Jim Butler (TSR) about a month ago, and he indicated that
there is an "Alternity: Gamma World" book coming soon. If it\'s a hit,
they\'ll consider doing more work in that setting.

I wonder what the legal logistics would be for them to do a Traveller
book for Alternity?  Or are we talking sacriledge?  :)

Understandable.  Do you have a ball-park estimate as to when this will
be available?  Aside from the new Star Wars movie, nothing else has more
of my interest.  :)  Also, what will the pricing be like?

Kuiper Belts are a *LONG* way out.  We\'re talking about *billions* of klicks

I\'d see the Kuiper Belts and Oort Clouds as places for experimental physics 
labs to hang out in.  A nice *FLAT* space to do experiments with FTL physics, 
though a *LONG* way to go if you need a couple pounds of oxy...

According to the chart in \'The Traveller Book\', which has been fairly accurate 
as far as I can tell, going a billion klicks at a constant 1G is about a 7.3 
day trip.  If you\'re talking delta vees of 10 klick/secs, pack a lunch, it\'s a 
long walk.

I think that chart was also printed in the first BOJ.  And yeah, I *use* that 
chart for currency conversions IMTU; lot of the space that my characters have 
to go through aren\'t Imperial-controlled.

True enough, but expenses tend to eat into profits.  The more your goods cost 
you to aquire, the narrower your profit margin is.  Now, I\'m not an economic 
genius; AAMOF, I consider economics to be an arcane art just this side of 
witchcraft (no offense to any Wiccans here).  I don\'t understand it.  Period.

Which is why I looked at GG\'s.  Seems *most* systems have some GG\'s around.

Course, a *REAL* bitch would be a totally dry system; no water & no GG\'s.

Eventually.  If you assume the standard 40 year payoff, you get to wait for 40 
years for your big cashflow rakeins.  Til then, you gotta cover the nut.

I never said you did.  AAMOF, I noted in my \'Potato\' design that it would 
handle 300 KT of shipping a day to 1 parsec of range, less, of course, if the 
destination is further out.  But even after serving 10,000 ships, the prorated 
cost of the station is not zero with respect to a single ship.

I told you.  Ease of filling.  I haven\'t done any numbers on seperate fuel 
rocks & tugs as opposed to a single station/tender.

Well, if you follow the HG ruleset, it flat out states that all-drop jump 
tankage is illegal.  Not to mention a *RILLY* bad idea in frontier areas.
 
And on the latter part, Steven and I *both* agree, but for different reasons.

It looks like it will be usign the modular system in GT and I think it will
need that book but not Vehicles, UT, etc.

SJG might object, loudly.  Even if they don\'t have exclusive rights to all
"generic" ports of Traveller, introducing another alternate system would
really dilute the value of their license.    

I don\'t think it would be good for the game, either.  It would spread the
limited amount of Traveller dollars between too many vendors for any of
them to be viable.

Dunno bout easier to find.  Transstellar space is pretty big.  It\'s like

It still depends on how far out the ice cubes are.  It takes over a week to go

What gets me is, some of the older desert worlds are bound to have a few 
hundred ice balls in their Kuiper Belts, and they\'ve been civilised (*and* 
high tech) for quite some time.  And I *KNOW* there\'s planets like this in the 
Solomani Rim, I just don\'t happen to have my copy anywhere handy at the 
moment.  So howcome they didn\'t move a few iceteroids insystem and crash \'em 
into the planet to provide water yet??

I can see them also developing freefall organisms for use in asteroid belt systems.

Shouldn\'t, if it\'s long enough and strong enough.  There\'s been some tether 
designs published about; don\'t know of any right off the top of my head tho...

I only mentioned it because IMHO Traveller, Gamma World and AD&D are the
very best games for their respective genres.  However, this Alternity
thing is really getting crammed down our throats.  The addition of a
Gamma World setting is merely a weak handwave at the crew on the Gamma
world Emailing list to jump on the wagon.

I miss the good old days where games were games and men were men and
sheep were scared...:)

  FWIW, there are three such systems in the Islands Cluster; one - Achille -
has _no_ refuelling capacity at all (the other two have inherent capacity of
the starport, which may represent providing comet/rock based assets or merely
non-dipping available liguid resources on the mainworld).

Maybe Christmas 2000 given more volunteers (or more work done by current

Bruce, you have it!  Now remember those words when you get to the Mae Lee. ;->

Do you remember that post about quirks that came out a month ago?  I think older ships need to develop "interesting quirks" as they age...don\'t you?  The list needs to be adjusted for differing technologies, but it is an excellent idea.

I don\'t happen to have a copy of TCS around, so I have zero information on the Islands Clusters.

  Only the per unit costs matters, obviously; is Cr 15 per Dt truly significant?
FWIW, I would describe it as "dirt-cheap" for the service in question.

  To quote todays column by big business\' favourite poster-boy in B.C.:
   "You don\'t have to be a commerce major to appreciate that when businesses
find costs going up, they raise their prices, provided the market can stand it."

  As we\'re discussing the most efficient way to provide L-Hyd to freighters at
a given nexus, it could be pointed out that whatever that method or its cost
is it will tend to deliver a normal profit (ROI), all else being equal.

  Thus, only the relative cost of delivering L-Hyd to a service station is
relevant, not its absolute cost, barring tremendous extremes*.

 * which, ironically, are fairly easily addressed using the HG2 drop-tank rules.

So why, in the name of Saint Joan, Piero of Blessed Memory, John Maynard in

1000 per dton freight rate as if it was Holy Writ ?

Keven, drop tanks do not reduce the capital cost of a 400 dton starship
that can carry 200 dtons of cargo and do a jump-4. It does however reduce
the capital cost of a system that can move 200 dtons of freight four parsecs.

It helps if you think of commercial starships as piles of cargo surrounded
by megacredits. Ship size doesnt count - only the relationship between the
size of the pile of cargo and the size of the protective layer of megacredits.

Drop tank ships need less megacredits for a given pile of cargo, even when
you include a \'service station slice\'. This is because you dont need
expensive jump drives to push empty fuel tankage through hyperspace, and
expensive power plants to power those jump drives. 

You may want to go back to my Drop Tanks Redux post of the 10th of April,
and see how you can make money under G:T using drop tanks. I believe that
Steve Hudson has shown the same thing under High Guard.

This assumes that you do not have a fixed freight rate regardless of distance.

Things get more complex when you have systems with low up-front costs but
high maintainence costs (eg roads) when you are comparing them to systems
with high up front costs but low maintainence costs ... but thats where
discounted cash flow analysis comes into it (as an example, figure out what
Cr 1000 per year worth *now*, if interest rates are permanently fixed at
5%. The answer is at the bottom. By reversing this, you can calculate what
you can afford to spend now, to save Cr 1000 per year, given a ruling rate
of interest).

Ian Whitchurch

PS The answer is the income stream divided by the interest rate, or 1000 /
0.05, or 20 000.

Because, by St. Elvis of Terra, it\'s the best rate.  Can you say \'cut rate 
competiton\'?  Can you say \'government subsidies\'?

Now, this doesn\'t mean that it\'s the *only* rate that can be charged.  IIRC, 
I\'ve seen Amber Zones where the patron offers double rates, whatever.  I see 
the 1KCr/ton as the \'lowball bid\' due to excessive competition.  Let\'s face 
it, if there was only *one* airline, tickets would be about 5 or 6 times what 
they are now.

Yeah, they did.  They were so good that they got rewritten as the generic

skillage, I could usually pay off just about any ship in the book, starting 
with a 125KCr stake, in under 3 years.  <grin>

It\'s 15% of the standard rate for unrefined fuel.  You call that dirt cheap?

When the freighter captain is paying 300Cr/dt for refined fuel, it is
cheap.

And the rules imply that you can get fuel at this price from an orbital
facility (the highport).

(300Cr might be wrong, but I\'m sure its between 100Cr and 500Cr)

Smell should be a big part of this.  I seem to recall one old reference

  I do know old fishing boats never quite loose the odor, even when made of

Still, you must admit that a starship hull has more elaborate design

will cost more. If you start giving the disposable fuel tank comparable
capabilites to the starship hull, the disposable fuel tank\'s cost per ton
should start to approach that of the starship hull.

For example, let\'s say you make the disposable fuel tank durable enough
to last decades or centuries - making it, in effect, re-usable instead of
disposable. If one tank is designed for one use between refurbishings,
and another tank is designed to go a year between refurbishings, don\'t
you think there will be a price difference between the two?

"Groat, I hate Groat."

After a bad odor experience (in the March Harrier no less!) One
Player-Captain had such an aversion to live (and, by association, dead)
Groat that he would not even consider shipping Groat products in any form.

I still remember a "flavor paragraph" from Jo and Lesley Grant\'s "101
Cargos", paraphrased;

Captain: "Whaddaya mean they\'re live!  They\'re supposed to be dead!  It
says right here, dead groat!"

Broker: "No, see that symbol? That indicates the future tense, they *will*
be dead, which, of course, means they are not dead yet."

That book is full os such neatnesses.  I\'ll never forget the look on their
faces when they found out they were shipping feces of artists...in fragile
glass containers no less.

Actually you are discribing a system that has been used off and on sence
cpmputers were first designed in the 50s.  The problem is by the time you
figure in the overhead you actually loose performance.  This arcatype is
often pulled out of mothballs and retried every decade of so and then
returned to the but bucket when other more generalist arcatype outperform
them 3 to one.  One thing you must consider.  On a main frame what program
is running can change every second and several hundred programs can be
running at the same time each being swapped out every little bit.  You
reconfig time become significant.

Sorry, nice idea but not workable.  You media has to be conductive.  One
giant mass of conductive matterial is just a short.  No order and no way to
impose order.  You have to start with a cell and path matrix to provide to
basic structure and an acess to the areas to need to alter.  You concept
would not work with opitical systems either due to to need for the light
pipe.  There are also the problems of waste impurities and assured load.

The problem is it does not fit canon.  In canon get rid of the virus to
tough.  Using this technology getting rid of the virus is easy.  Restarting
the computer taked some work.  As for the reconfig computer, for obvious
reasons it would be a portable hardwires dedicated computer that would not
be vunerable to the virus.  You alway secure and muliply redundant such a
system.  And such a low level reconfig would be a last resort anyway as such
a system would have a more commonly used partial reconfig program always
running.

No, that to high level.  You would add a routine to the always running
reconfig program that detectected the virus figure print are reconfigured
it.  It would be very low level.  Lower than the DOS.  Either just after
system INI code or part of the INI code before running the boot strap loader.

The congfig tool is NOT connected during nornal operation.  It\'s in a padded
case mark, emergency use only.  It is ROM based and writen by the factory.
Also when you key the \'RETURN TO DEFAULT\' function the virus no longer
exists, it is not running because NOTHING is running.  If it put copies of
itself on disk or whatever media it might come back after recofig IF the
system operater were so utterly stupid as to not prep the disks and reload
from clean ROMs.

They are MAIN FRAMES.  Like Cray-2.  Not PC.  They have MASSIVE resorces and

That is what software is for.  Also your concept which could in fact be

Sorry, you still have cost and volume trade off.  You can not get something
for nothing...except when you use the argument of TL12 \'magic\' machines.

You still have the problem of cost and volume.  It is not posible to build
something that is reconfigureable that is the same size and cost as a
dedicted system or a general purpose system.  The support equipment for the
reconfigurisation and the minimum clearence between track and componets
would eat you alive.  You really have not idea what you are asking of this
techlology.  I can\'t even think of a type of matter that it could be built
FROM.  You are trying to produce specific matterials out of a generic
\'psuedo-matter\'.  The technology you are discribing could turn lead to gold
or be used to make matter transporters.  Computer circuits are made of a
fair wide variety of elements and compounds that do not work or play well
together.  They have to be separated and combined in differnt enviroments to
make workable circuits.  Some of those conditions are mutually exclusive.
This inherantly puts limits on you mutable core that can not be solved until
matter energy manipulation is a mature process.  That is part of the problem
with people that say it\'s TL such in such we can understand it.  We can
understand enough to see what other effect such technology would have.  To
have your mutable computer cores as you discribe them would take either Star
trek type matter converters or a mature nano technology that would be
massively pervasive.  And even with the nano tech you would end up with a
system far bigger than a general purpose system of the same processing power
and speed that could run the same range of programs.

By the way a Cray-2 or any of the even more advanced systems available today
would be able to match a model-3 at least and in some ways a model-9
(depending on what you use for benchmarks).  Traveller greatly
underestimated the growth of the computer.  Of course it could be that earth
has reach TL12+ in computer technology already.  Whose to say?  Even
travller admits that a world can be very advanced in one area and not
others...perhaps we have just missed the proper concept for the other
technologies so far.

They would turn into real AIR-heads and gear-heads.  Those systems were
pnumatic and clockwork!  And you would really be surprised at all the things
they could do in the way of process control.  Remember in WW2 the TDCs,
Nordon bomb sights, and balistic targeting computer on ships were all clockwork!

I wasn\'t aware this was a "normal" debate.

Jump Drive is a future invention. Most of the OTU\'s economic and social
structure is related to the effects of this invention. We can logically
discuss these effects, if we agree on the assumptions.

Once you agree on the active assumptions, you can logically discuss
anything. Unicorns. Vampires. Perpetual Motion Machines. Virus. A thing
does not have to exist to be logically discussed.

I\'m talking speculative fiction, with analysis of the results of postulated
technologies. You, on the other hand, are talking late 20th century
computer science. You dismiss as impossible anything you can\'t
figure out how to build. I postulate a TL15 computer paradigm, you "prove"
that it doesn\'t work because it was impossible at TL7. You fail to allow 
for materials technology breakthroughs, science revolutions, synthesis
of Terran technology development with that of the Hivers and other alien
masters of computer science - you act as if everything of importance 
about computer science has already been discovered.

I don\'t see why someone with that mindset would be interested in a
_Science Fiction_ mailing list, especially one dedicated to a *game*.

Good night, Charles.

    'index' => 'dn353',
    'month' => '05',
    'body' => 'I was doing some game theory on my Fleet Ops rules, and I\'m running
into a bit of a snag.

Fleet Ops is my rules set for battles throughout a solar system, btw.
Instead of the fate of a system being decided in one big battle (as per
High Guard/Trillion Credit Squadron), I wanted the ability for in-system
movement - seperate battles for Gas Giants, especially.

The problem I\'m seeing is the usual one for starship combat games
of any scale: why not put your entire fleet in one big pile? 

You go to an enemy system, you put all your fleet in one big task force.
Unless the defender has a massive numerical superiority, you defeat
every seperate point in the system he\'s trying to defend - five or ten
little battles instead of one big one. 

The defender can\'t allow himself to be defeated piecemeal like that, so
he\'ll have to commit his entire force to one big defensive task force
and intercept the invader. His only other option is to send for help,
scatter and delay.

If the above is true, then the only reason for a detailed intra-system
combat rule set would be to model the latter case - the defender (or
the attacker) scattering amongst the minor worlds of the system, 
attempting to avoid a conclusive engagement. The only reason to avoid
such an engagement is time - can you keep him occupied until a
relief force enters the system? Can you keep his fleet occupied
hunting your raiding force long enough for them to miss a crucial battle
two parsecs from here?

My Fleet Ops rules have a critical flaw - they abstract out time! They 
assume that all the battles for control of the system, no matter how few
or many, will take place within a single Trillion Credit Squadron
strategic turn*. Thus, there is no reason for a delaying action at all.
Players using my Fleet Ops system will simply lump their squadrons 
into one task force and fight it out as per High Guard - the Fleet Ops
rules thus become near-useless chrome.

The only fix I see for this is to change the level of abstraction - create
in-system travel times. Even so, an invader should be able to rendezvous
with almost every important system location within a week. We\'d have
to get the time resolution down to a matter of days, and that\'s just too
much detail load for a subsystem for a strategic game. 

The other fix is to depend on the "draw" rules to end combats with
hostile fleets in the same system. Currently, my draw rules for Fleet Ops
end the fight for the system if five Fleet Ops turns go by with no 
battles occurring. This could happen either because both fleets are holding
back, or because one fleet is managing to avoid the other (due to superior
acceleration and/or Fleet Tactics skill).

Still, all my draw rules will mean is that the guy with the big pile \'o fleet
will just have to catch one SDB per every five Fleet Ops turns to keep his 
party rolling. Sounds like I need some adjustment there.

Ah, the challenge of game design...

Walt Smith

* Design note: the idea for all this came from Dwarfstar\'s _Star Viking_
game, 1981. In both TCS and Star Viking a fight within a star system
is generally settled, one way or the other, by the end of the turn.
My idea for System Zones (areas where fleets have something to
fight over) was in some ways inspired by the way _Star Viking_
lays out star systems.

_Star Viking_, btw, is a lovely little game. Raiders from beyond the outer 
rim attack the border province of a weakening galactic federation.
Defenders get to try and stop the Vikings with everything from 
federation frigates to hordes of guys with pointy sticks. Very
Travelleresque, especially the space piratish theme. ;-)

	Sorry I didn\'t make that clear.  The default is 0 for client states.  There are higher 
trade barriers for clients than for Imperial member worlds but they are not generally large 
enough to warrant a negative modifier.  Some client states are political/military rather than 
trade based and these may have a -.5 or even -1 if they are sufficiently xenophobic or different 
from the imperial norm (intelligent plants, or hive insects or something).

Very well said.  Excelent retoric.  Touche!

I am perfectly aware that you can discuss the ramifications of nearly any
suposition.  It is however rediculious for me to spend time pointing out all
the non canon side effect of the technological solutions that have been
proposed.  One technology does not exist in a vacume.  A radical advance in
one area will have great impacts in others.  It is non canon side effect
that I am trying to avoid.  The technology that would be required to do some
of what people have proposed would also make other things posible like say
personal forcefields and replicaters and solid-holos.

Now lets put my original statement BACK into the context it was cut from.

You (the TMLers, not you alone) have been proposing some very strange
technology to make your assumptions of how the virus works valid and
posible.  Some of your proposals require massive changes that would have
implecations far more reaching that just the computer industry.  These
logical side effects do not appear in canon so your proposed methods of
implementation are not workable.  Why are you adverse to a simple and
elegant solution?  Have you read the \'virus beard\' proposal to even see what
my side of the argument is?  Why must we assume technology not in evidence?
Why a complicated solution when a simple one will fit canon?

I\'m am first, last, and always an engineer (At least that is what my SO
says.)  KISS! is the watch world for engineers.  It mean \'Keep It Simple
Stupid\'.  Why, because in many cases the simplest solution that meets the
requirements is the best and most servicable with the least unwanted side
effects.

Now as to why I reed this particular SF mail list.  It\'s because I have
played and enjoyed traveller for 16 years.  I have found it so enjoyable
because of the minimum amount of hand waves and \'magic\' techology.  Be able
to figure out how things are suposed to work based on logical extrapolation
gives traveller a level of believability and consistancy that is lacking in
other lesser games.  It is that believability and consistance that I wish to
preserve.  It you prefer a game that is less so, then may I suggest that
perhaps it is you who are reading the wrong list.

Also I read this list because the people here are frieldly, polite,
inteligent and open to discourse.  The discussions held on this list inspire
me and make me think.  Some times they chalenge me and other times they
infuriate me (sometimes at the same time) but they always stimulate my mind
even when I can not make others see my point or when I am proven wrong after
my most pationate arguments.  

I do not mind being wrong when I learn something in the process.  (I was
shown the light in the pirate debate.)  I\'d rather be proven wrong and learn
what is right than to believe myself right while being wrong.  In cases
where the concept can not be put to a real world test, the only way a
\'right\' answer can be agreed apone is by discourse such as this.  I\'m not
saying that some of the solutions and developements purposed during this
discussion WILL NOT come about in the real world given time.  What I am
saying is that they WOULD have side effect that are not present in TRAVELLER
canon.

Walt, what I am going to say is based on star system lay out as detaled in
GS so you may not be interested but here goes.

IF there is only one real target in the system like one inhabited planet and
no gas giant or it is not defended then one battle would be pretty much it
as your intire fight will be in or near the 100d limit of the target.

If there are multiple targets you get a posible different story.  With
transit times that could be in weeks from distrant GG or belt habitats you
end up with the chance of reinforcements unless the invader splits his
forces to deal with many target separated by great distances.

Also if you include the posibility that the \'Honking Big Dreadnaught\'TM
going boom will damage or distroy other \'near by\' ships you can force more
smaller battle because consentration of force could end up counter productive.

Hope this gives you some ideas.  You project sounds interesting.

That is very similiar to the way the Intel \'Merced" chip functions.

Travel times in the outer system (where there is ice and gasgiants for
lurking/refuelling) is typically on the order of weeks (much more so if
only HEPLAR allowed as in TNE).

SPS had a wonderful strategy game called Battlefleet mMars where a big
battle was fought between various fleets in the solar system. They didn\'t
use a hex/square map of the system but rather argued that no fleet would
ever meet in transit between planets. Thus if you can make up some
tables/whatever to calculate the triptimes between major bodies your player
simply checks the traveltime to a target, determines ETA and consider that
task force out of combat until arriving.

I\'d put in variable tables that reflected the motion of planets but I\'m way
to gearheadedish and that would probably only ruin the playability.

Can we see something from your work perhaps?

Shock would probably be reserved for division-sized or larger units.  It

In cases where a subsector simply cannot raise sufficient forces, troops
from neighboring subsectors will be assigned to the area.  The Army will
create a "defense district" to handle the under populated area.

The IA will accept some people with prior service in PDFs, but are leery of
the "bad habits" they bring with them.  On the other hand, PDFs *love*
getting IA veterans, since their level of training and professionalism is
very high.  Many worlds offer commissions to any IA vet who enlists in the
local force.

This effect will be present, but is mitigated by the relatively small size
of the IA, and the presence of elite soldiers who prefer to be in the
planetary force.

Actually, I\'d keep the brigades mixed.  A soldier will serve his entire
career in the same regiment, but have battalions of different regiments in
a brigade encourages competition.

Let\'s say that the 178th Lift Infantry Brigade, part of the IA Lunion,
contains the following major units:

2/23 Lunionese Rifles (Lunion)
1/7 Royal Bluecoats (Strouden)
1/4 Corvair Heights Lancers (Lunion)
2/3 Shieldwall Armor (Composite)
3/213 Field Artillery (Composite)

The battalions will strive to outdo each other, both for unit and home
world pride.  This spirit of competition will translate into better soldiers.

"When I Was A Boy"
Copyright ©1997 by Frank Hayes, Firebird Arts & Music (BMI). No Infringement 
Intended By This Posting

When I was a boy our Nintendo
Was carved from an old Apple tree
And we used garden hose to connect it
To our steam-powered color tv.

But it still beat that ancient Atari
\'Cuz I almost went blind, don\'tcha know,
Playing Breakout and Pong on a video game
Hooked up to the radio.

And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
Barefoot, uphill both ways,
Throught blizzards in summer and winter
Back in the good old days.
Back when Fortran was not even Three-tran
And the PC was only a toy
And we did our computing by gaslight
When I was a boy.

When I was a boy all our networks
Were for hauling in fish from the sea--
Our bawd rate was eight bits an hour (and she was worth it!),
And our IP address was just 3.

And you kids who complain that the World Wide Web
Is too slow oughtta cut out your bitchin\',
\'Cuz when I was a boy every packet
Was delivered by carrier pidgeon.

And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
Barefoot, uphill both ways,
Through blizzards in summer and winter
Back in the good old days.
Back when Fortran was not even Two-tran
And the mainframe was only a toy
And we did our computing by torchlight
When I was a boy.

When I was a boy our IS shop
Built relational tables from wood,
And we wrappered our data in oilcloth
To preserve it the best that we could.

And we carried our bits in a bucket,
And our mainframe weighed 900 tons,
And we programmed in ones and in zeroes,
And sometimes we ran out of ones.

And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
Barefoot, uphill both ways,
Through blizzards in summer and winter
Back in the good old days.
Back when Fortran was not even One-tran
And the abacus? Only a toy!
And we did our computing in primordial darkness
When I was a boy.


Back to your regularly scheduled list...

Charles, do you use psionics in your Traveller games? If so, then the KISS
explanation for Virus seems (to me) to be the psionic one. Virus is a
psionic phenomena, a power developed in the lab in Cyberlime chips that
enables infected systems to have all of the powers ascribed to them in TNE.
A form of Computer Empathy, Domination, and Psychokinesis (allowing it to
propagate by physically changing the nature of the systems it infects).

Player: "How does Virus do *that*?"
Referee: "It\'s f***ing magic." ;-)

What is the arrangement of the living spaces?

How is the quarters module arranged? Are there horizontal floors? Or is it
dividede to 5 or 6 sections with the outer hull as floor?
How are the modules connected? Are ther airlocksa at both ends? One end? In
the ends and the middle? At which positions can they be connected?

I\'m making an adventure that will have a research base constructed of
modules, and also a ships that is specially designed for haulig enough
modules for a portable base.

Let\'s say that the 178th Lift Infantry Brigade, part of the IA Lunion,
contains the following major units:

A continually shifting upper command structure will simply concentrate
his loyalty on the highest command figure that doesn\'t change
frequently - probably his battalion command. Not that this is 
necessarily a bad thing, but I just don\'t see a putting much faith or

This harkens back to the piracy discussion and it\'s idea that the outer
system may be very underdeveloped. Nothing out there to defend, so
no defenders, so it\'s too dangerous to build anything worth defending...

I wanted to maintain a level of abstraction that would make this a good
"plug-in" for an HG/TCS strategic campaign, and having the in-system
battle resolved in a matter of TCS strategic turns (weeks) seemed to 
indicate the level of abstraction I used. I\'m now thinking that a two-tiered 
system map - inner planets vs outer planets, with a week\'s travel between - 
might be the way to go. This would allow me to keep the detail level right,
the players wouldn\'t have to close the battle with a little note for each
ship saying how many days (and hours?) it was from it\'s next encounter.

This hasn\'t seemed to fit well for me in Traveller space combat. The
ships (except in very special cases) just don\'t seem to get close enough.

I considered some form of signature problem - a big pile of ships is
easier to detect than the same number of ships widely seperated.
Perhaps thruster plates create some kind of interference pattern at
high outputs when used near other thruster plates, and this pattern
is very obvious on a gravitic sensor? Maybe this interference pattern
even has a  performance degredation effect on the thruster plates 
themselves, like speedboats bouncing in each other\'s wake.

Now *that\'s* an interesting idea.

I wanted to avoid the players having to get this detailed for each star

would be to produce an idealized star system for the players to fight

in that particular system. Declare travel times (based on the CT book 
transit time figures) between each major point...but by this point, you\'re
pretty much playing Book 2 Starship combat. Ouch!

I still have a snag in adapting it well to work within the TCS strategic turn.

Thanks, both of you, for the input. I think my next step is to increase the
detail level (with estimated travel times) and see what the real numbers
are for a "sample" star system. Once I do this, I can look at the more
precise information and try to derive a less-detailed level that provides
appropriate results without the detail load.

Perhaps a specified limit on Fleet Ops turns per TCS turn would also 
be a useful idea, instead of depending on Draws, Mutual Cease-Fire
or Total Victory to end the in-system battle. I\'ll have to run the transit
time numbers to see what a reasonable number of turns would be - the
useful limit would be, "how many places in the average star system can
the average starship visit in a week?" The answer might be one...

Perhaps you should have read a little more of my post, like the part about

more plausible explaination than some I have read lately.  Pity there is not
a canon reference to psionic ability in the Cyberlime chips.  That would sew

10 klick/sec increasing as it falls in.  Though actually,
since you are going to leave the thruster on there, you might
as well leave them going.  Make it a 10000 ton chunk of
ice and let it keep going, it will handily arrive in less
than a year.

What you are missing is that the crew doesn\'t go with it.  They
send it along unmanned.  The ship takes a week or two to fly
out to the belt and collects objects, puts little thruster
packs on them, and starts sending them in on predetermined
tragectories.  Year start up time is hardly an insurmountable
task for a business (or even that rare).

I think you\'re reading too much into the technology - again, the problem
of agreement on assumptions. I\'m postulating an undifferentiated material,
probably a gel, that can be acted upon by certain tools to create 
pathways either similar to circuits or similar to nervous systems (in result,
almost certainly not in appearance or direct physical attributes).
These pathways may even be grown in the media, rather than shaped
or burned - like ice crystals forming on the surface of water.

Perhaps the matrix can change quickly enough to be reconfigured on
the fly, to optimize itself for the particular program mix you have loaded
at any one time. That\'s more than my original idea, I was thinking of it
configuring itself to your peripherals, operating environment and some
user configurable operational parameters - an operation that could take
hours or days, but would result in a computer fine-tuned to the job it\'s
intended for.

I think it\'s a bit of a stretch to take this technology and say it leads to
more than incredibly adaptable computer systems. Solid holos? Personal
force fields? Replicators? Where did those come from?

Your take on this idea requiring mature nanotechnology or the like tells
me you\'re still seeing a computer as wires and circuit boards, things
that this matrix would need to build and rebuild, rather than a matrix
within which states can change like a computer of today reallocates
memory space.

I appreciate the relative consistency in the Traveller universe. The 
departures from the known-to-be-possible are generally well-defined
and (often with hammering from this list) can be made workable.
I wouldn\'t take this so far as to say that antigrav, jump drive, 2D 
galactic representations, meson technology, spaceborne effective
energy weapons, and drop tanks are the *only* technology allowed that
a 20th century scientist can\'t build.

Let\'s say you\'ve just encountered an alien race that has little concept
of "One". All things to them are degrees, rather than absolutes, and 
their computers are built, from theory to practice, on that philosophy.
Can you imagine such a computer? Would it be possible to build? Could
it do things a terran binary logic computer can\'t? 

What if a TL13+ computer can\'t be built without the breakthrough
Imperial scientists achieved after analyzing such an alien computer?

Isn\'t the Traveller universe more interesting if the above is *possible*?

You end up having to ask, "why is this system being fought over?"  If
the answer is  GG fueling opportunities, then that is where you attack
and defend.  For example, a system with a type E starport (a flat area
of bedrock, maybe with some kind of beacon) and a UPP population of 0 or
1 (less than 100 people) will probably never have an enemy fleet try to
invest it.  The enemy fleet would go for the GG for refueling and ignore
the planet.  On the other hand, a system with multiple type A starports
on several bodies in the system, with a system poplulation in the
millions or billions, perhaps Rich or Industrial, with a nich high tech
level, you would need a huge enemy fleet investing each of the places
with starports since new fighting hulls could be produced or jury-rigged
in fairly short order.

You think I would have thought of that, what with me having a Fleet
Logistics variant for High Guard on my web page and all. :-)

( http://hartwick.edu/~smithw/fleetlogistics.htm if anyone\'s interested)

My logistics variant is based on cruising time, it could be modified to
be based on battles (or even combat rounds). The defender has 
resupply capabilities all over the system, and can probably destroy them
(if necessary) to keep the attacker from using them. Thus the defender
only runs out of ammo in the middle of fights, and only stays out of
ammo until he\'s got a couple of quiet HG turns at a base or stockpile.
The Intruder only has what he brought with him - in ready racks, cargo
bays and ammunition ships. Yes, ammunition ships - can you say
"targets"?

Perhaps I could modify my logistics rules, have ships required while at
a friendly base to divide their cargo between cruising time and reloads.
Thus a ship could decide to carry only two weeks worth of supplies,
but a whole pile of missiles (and other combat expendables) if it were
attacking the next system over. A deep penetration raider might carry
more supplies and less reloads, even though it was the same class of
starship.

I like this list. It gives me ideas. <G>

If the tank is disposable (and the description given for them
says they shouldn\'t have to be), then yes, it would make sense
not to build them to standards for internal tanks.  This means
they will be _cheaper_.  It also doesn\'t mean they have to be
unreliable (if they are are built to lower standards becuase
one use doesn\'t put as much demand on them, then they are
perfectly adequate for their use).

They would be analog computers, yes they can do things that binary
computers don\'t do well or can\'t do. The Norden bombsight referred to
earlier in this discussion was an analog computer...so is a slide rule.

Some years ago there was an article in Scientific American about simple
analog computers that solved quite hard problems...and I mean simple:
they were literally built from Tinkertoys!

One, IIRC it was in either the Amateur Scientist or Mathematical
Recreations column, showed an analog computer that solved shortest-path
problems using nothing more than string, rubberbands and wooden pegs on
pegboard.

I always tended to the Federation and Empire system for battles.  You could
have large fleets, but each fleet had to have a \'flagship\' which directed
the action.  A SCS could control up to 10 subordinate ships in its \'fleet\'.
 This would keep the fleets smaller, perhaps no more than a squadron could
act as a group, with several groups acting as a fleet.

Looking at TCS, and at Bk6, and at the travel times... essentially, the
inner system is al within a week\'s travel of it\'s self; the outer system
(past about 4-6 AU) seems to be that normally, each would be about a week
under thrust from each other and from any given inner system... shorter for
faster, but still a singificant chunk. and since the deep outsystem is, by
TCS, out of reach, it would be nearly impossible to force a major battle
away from a vital spot; the deep outsystem (beyond planetary bodies) is
totally non-vital, huge (remember double the radius, 4 times the area), and
hard to search...

I\'d suggest say 2 movements/week... but any inner system battles could be
resolved in a compressed time.

That\'s MO, too.  To my way of thinking, the CT trade process were
much more entertaining and interesting than the Merchant Prince/MT
rules that followed them.  There were problems that needed GM
intervention, but overall I liked them *much* better.

Yeah, that was one of the problems. <grin>

It wasn\'t hard to find a "milk-run" that always produced large (too
large) profits each way.  You address that in several ways, have
supply and demand decrease as more and more of the item is shipped
and introduce competetion attracted to the large profits possible on
the run.  I think GT:FT takes both of these approaches into account.

Step one:  Name a chemical or compound that changes it\'s electical and
physical properties from non solid to solid and non conductor to conductor
on demand or at all for that matter without changing it\'s chemical composition.

Step two: Develop molecular level control of above substance.

Even then you are limited by the speed of light in a conducter and the
switching speed of your gates.  We are up agaist those walls today.  With
processor becoming more complex with more gates and connections the signals
have to travel farther and the speed of light becomes a limiting facter.
Even operating voltages place limits on such thing as track spacing which in
turn place limits on curcuit spacing and minimum distance a signal must
travel to reach the next logic gate.

DOS stands for disk operating system.  It\'s the basic IO bridge
functionality.  All computers have some version of a \'DOS\' if it has any
connections to the real world and this can do usefull work.  It may not be
call DOS but the functionallity is there.  Humans have similer systems like
the visual cortex.  It is not wise to make fun of things you do not
understand.  It reflects badly on you.

Actually it would take a great deal of advancement to allow a sentience to
exist in any computer.  Current systems do not have nearly the power to
support even a rat\'s mental processes.  Organic minds have a huge amount of
processors.  Perhaps more in one human mind than there are computer
processors on earth.  I do not recall the figures and they have changed over
time anyway.

But I\'ll reask the question you did not answer.  Why MUST future computer
change beyond all recongition to suit you?

Where in canon is self reconfiguring conputers?  Book and page please.

Anyway reconfigurable computers are here today.  They just do not behave the
way you think they do.  The reconfiguration does not change the basic nature
of there structure it just optomises them.  It will have to remain this way
in the future or you would have no standard to work form to write your
programs.  Programer DO exist in canon.  There are also some ugly trade offs
when you drop the reconfiguration below a curtain level.  You end up with to
much hardware overhead.

Again with the suppositions?  Can\'t we stick a little closer to the real?
Anyway this has been done before.  They had some novel structures but do not
do anything world shaking.  I\'ve built them.  I\'ve repaired them.  They have
been mostly replaced by modern computers for very good reasons.

And how do you know that we do not have TL13+ computers NOW?  We might have
advanced in computer technology far ahead of other technology.  We curtainly
have made leaps on the orders of magnatude in the past 5 decades.  Far
beyond what was originally believed posible when Traveller was written.  You
are so fond of supposing, please try this supposition.  What if this is
closer to what will be than what you suggest?  

>Isn\'t the Traveller universe more interesting if the above is *possible*?

No, just much less believable and less playable sence the players and GM
have no common reference points.  Tell me how a computer tech. charater
could even being to discribe in character his actions when your \'magic\'
computer is so far beyond the players understanding he does not have words
to discibe his actions.

Role playing is then reduced to "I role against my comp-4 skill" instead of
allowing the player the chalendge of trying methods he can name like \'power
on reset\', \'disk rebuild\', \'boot clean\', or \'core dump\'.

When a player feels confident in his knowledge of what his character can do
then he can act.  When he has to ask what his character knows about a skill
he has he drops out of character and you loose a little of the feel of the
world you are trying to play in.  When you tell a player that he can\'t
posibly understand what a TL13+ computer is like and his character has TL15
computer-6 skill you have in effect removed that skill from his character
sheet.  Who\'s to say a comp-6 could not defeat the virus and get the
computer back on line?  Sure he\'s not \'inside the computer\' but then again
the virus is \'in the box\' and that PC has access to some very big hammers
and the main fuse boxes!

I\'ve worked with several of these beasties.  Most people do not know it but
there are quite a few of this out there in industry or at least they were.
The problems are implimentation and cost.  They are amazing bits of design
engineering though.

Well, Eris, you\'re forgetting another way to reduce the profits made by

Hmm.. As a veteran of the US army regimental system, I feel that most
soldiers developed enough of a respect for the regiment without having it
shoved in their faces at every turn.

While at Ft. Benning, I served in the 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry
(Cottonbalers), on e of the oldest units in the Army.  Even though our
first battalion was in Germany, and out second in Texas somewhere, we had
pride in our unit, especially compared to those cream puffs in the 1/29th.

We were told of the exploits of Cottonbalers through the years, had the
origin of the unit nickname repeated endlessly (it goes back the Battle of
New Orleans), and saluted our officers with "Willing and Able, Sir!", our
regimental motto.  I don\'t think one guy in ten could quote the 197th
Infantry Brigade\'s motto (Forever Faithful), but we had no trouble
operating inside the system.

No, I think you have it backwards.  The typical Imperial Army unit is
the unattached brigade, so it will be posted with all battalions
together.  Traveller communications and travel limits will then enhance
the experience of being in a certain unit -- the soldier will be stuck
on whatever ball of rock with those other guys until the entire unit is
replaced with some other brigade.  Meanwhile, he can show the Lunionese
just how they drink hard cinnamon jack in Strouden.  

Traveller communication is much like that of the age of sail, and that
is just when many Terran unit traditions were developed -- when units
were posted to forsaken pieces of empires for long periods, to face off
their counterparts from other empires or to hold down the conquered
natives.

There was plenty of freeboard, but the gunports were definitely one of
the primary entry points for the water (as also in the case of the
Vasa, the Swedish flagship of about the same period, which was
refloated almost completely intact several years ago.

[re 1545 campaign]...About this time, disaster struck the English
fleet. Following the Henry Grace a Deiu out of the anchorage was the
seven hundred ton Mary Rose, the flagship of the Vice Admiral Carew
and after the Great Harry, the most powerful ship in the English
fleet. Suddenly, after she had fired one broadside and was beginning a
turn to bring her other broadside into play, she heeled over, her open
gun ports admitted water and she capsized in full view of the king,
his court, and Carew\'s wife. It is known that the ship was overloaded
by the embarking of extra soldiers, [This was probably not the case,
the account relating to the ship carrying 700 men is not a
contemporary document, and the Imperial Ambassador states that the
ship was carrying 500 men, much nearer her normal complement...

capsize. She may have been mishandled, or a sudden gust of wind might
have tipped her over long enough for her load to fatally shift.

><grumble>

This is from my Akus Moby PBEM...

After a long trip (almost 2 years real time) the "heirs" are closing
in on where they think their inheritance, an exploratory trader, is
located, a small asteroid in the Mark system called S-18.  It\'s not
showing up on the sensors, but a 20 ton ship\'s boat is.

The boat is on the asteroid, but it appears dead.  No power
signature at all.  How did it get there?  Could it have been left
behind when...oh NO!  The players are beginning to realize that
others might have beaten them to the asteroid and made off with the
ship.

Where did the two former crewmen that "went prospecting" weeks ago
*really* go?  Did the loanshark and racketeer, Pele "Pickax" Hiika
really leave the system on the _Foolya Four_ or go looking for the
ship?  Is Mazie a nice old lady or a cold blooded killer with
designs on the missing ship?  Is that ship lurking in the area whose
transponder says it is the HMS Ming, really a patrol boat...or
something else.  The Zeristu Empire claims the missing ship was
stolen from one of their corporations, are they going to abide by
the court\'s decision or try to "take their property back?"  

Is the ship here?  Was it *ever* here?  If not, where *is* it?  Our
heroes are now only 4 minutes from the asteroid, soon they will
know!

And now the *BIG* question, will it take another month of gametime
for them to play out these four minutes?  ;->

A reasonably good point... the handwave welcome thing.  As a company, it is
something they "have" to do in order to stay afloat (WotC/TSR) -- bring out
new products on a regular basis.  This is where I feel TSR died; they
brought out the new products (several each month!), but the quality
(content, presentation was still good, content was rubbish) just wasn\'t
there.

My former gaming group as a whole virtually stopped buying TSR\'s AD&D
products altogether.  Many have resumed since WotC bought TSR out however as
the quality did seem to improve.  I hope they are not going to make the same
mistakes...?

I agree with Mr. Berry, I too am a veteran (actually a retiree) of the U.S. 
Regimental system, in my case it was the 327th Infantry of the 101st Airborne 
Division (Air Assault). I too believe that soldiers enjoy having a special 
relationship with a regiment and not some transient officer or nco that 
happens to occupy a billet for a short time. There is loyalty to squad and 
platoon, sometimes company, to a weaker extent the battalion....but there is 
nothing comparable to the pride in your regiment.

The defender has a much tougher job. He can\'t concentrate his entire fleet,
unfortunately, since he has to defend against a wide range of attackers -
you have to defend each high-value target againt, for example, raiding forces,
or small attacking forces.

(A classic problem of game scenario design is the tendency to consider
only the case where forces are balanced...not the "how much damage can I
do even though outnumbered five to one" case. Battle Rider actually does
better than most with its random scenario generator.)

The defending forces do have some options - if they have good maneuver
capability the outlying forces if massively outnumbered can concentrate
at the mainworld - but their job is, overall, pretty tough.

  It\'s a mere factoid at best, and replaced by TNE\'s RSB in any case. I assume
that a number of similar cases arise in the Marches under various editions. A
ref could provide some character to such systems by figuring out what their
specific source of L-Hyd is - possibly including tanking it in.

I don\'t know about anyone else, but I would very much appreciate it if you
could discuss the various levels of regiment, division, battalion, etc, in
how they relate to one another, what sizes they might be, etc. What is the
level that the typical soldier considers to be "my unit"? I also wonder
how these units get their numerical designations and names - does the
existence of the 101st imply the existence of the 1st through 100th? Are
certain numbers traditionally associated with certain types of units?

Any light you could throw on this stuff would help me in creating a more
realistic TU and character backgrounds.

Although that is the standard form "Regiments" take in the modern army, I
had a somewhat different experience.   I was with the 3rd Armored Cavalry
Regiment (Brave Rifles).  The entire regiment served together (1/3 2/3
3/3 4/3)  We definitely had unit cohesion, knew unit history and had our
"Thunder and Steel, Sir" motto.  Not only that, but ACRs are designed to
be assigned to different units for each operation and include their own
support train.  They train and plan to work for different "higher
headquarters" for each operation.  This would seem to be necessary if
different units were going to be equipped by worlds with different tech
levels.  Nor did we have any problem operating inside the system (except
for one VERY embarrassing incident involving the 3rd Armored Division in
Iraq)

  In theory competition will return _profits_ back to "normal"; was there a 
particular fixed level you feel would naturally apply to OTU shipping prices?

  If the cheapest possible L-Hyd in a system will add Cr 50 to each Dt of load
moving through at J3 then the price of all such shipping will _very strongly_
tend to increase so that net profit of the shippers is unaffected.

Which made him a poor subordinate as it was. No one appreciated
Grant until he had a string of victories out west, and some not
even then.  Grant seems to have done his best work with the
assistance of Sherman, another fighting general.

>I also doubt that Lee considered him [McClellan] his best

I seem to recall that Lee expressed this opinion in a postwar
interview. McClellan was arguably the best the AotP had until
Grant came along. As as you mention, Grant\'s battlefield tactics
against Lee were not especially impressive. Lee, a tactical
wizard himself, would not have found much to admire in mere 
persistence and material superiority.  After Gettysburg, the ANV 
was in worse shape than the AotP, and he fought Grant to a standstill with
it. 

>Lee was fixated on defending Virginia to the detriment of the

IIRC, Lee was never particularly enthusiastic about the Confederate cause.
His motive in choosing the Confederacy over the Union in the first place
was the defense of his home state.

In my unit (3rd ACR) it went something like this (from the top down):

The Regiment had 5 squadrons, plus RHHT (Regimental Headquarters Troop)
1 Squadron of helicopters (Cobras, UH-1s, Blackhawks)
1 support squadron
3 maneuver squadrons (infantry and other people call these battalions) 
;-) 

Each maneuver squadron had 4 "Troops" , 1 "Company", and 1 "Battery"
3 Troops were mixed M1 (Abrams Tanks) and M2/3 (Bradley AFVs)
1 Troops was Headquarters and Headquarters Troops (HHT) 
1 Company was all M1s
1 Battery was self propelled 155s.

The Troops and the Companies were organized along the same lines.  It
started with
Vehicle Crew (4 people)  then
Platoon (4 vehicles) then 
Company (3 platoons of M1s, the CO and XO had an M1 each, plus some minor
support stuff)  
or
Troop (2 platoons of M2/3s, 1 platoon of M1s, plus the CO and XO each had
a vehicle)

I think the Artillery was organized the same way-ie, 4 howitzers to a
platoon.  

All of the support elements were in the Regimental Support squadron

This is somewhat unique- As far as I know only 3 Army units are organized
like this- the 2nd, 3rd, and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiments.  

Although someone else may be able to give a better explanation of this,
as I understand the typical structure within the Army\'s Regimental system
(from a short trip "outside" the regiment) is the same up to the
Battalion/Squadron level.  from that point, 3 or 4 battalions will be
assigned to a brigade and 2 or 3 brigades to a division.  The "regiment"
is made up of similar units, assigned to different brigades in different
divisions.  The assignments are more or less permanent, which is why,
IMHO, the style of Regiment which the 3rd ACR used would be more
flexible/adaptable for use in the 3I.    For example, I was assigned to
the 1st Battalion (Vulcan/Stinger) of the 62nd ADA Regiment.  The 2nd
Battalion 62nd ADA (2/62 in shorthand) was in Korea, the 3/62 was a
reserve unit somewhere, 4/62 was in Germany and 5/62 was in Texas.  1/62
was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, and had been for over 20
years.  

As far as numbering, I believe that originally they were numbered in
sequence.  Then, for a very short time they changed to numbering
divisions with the first number indicating a specialty.  They stopped
doing that quickly and as units were disbanded/deactivated following
various wars the numbers got more chaotic.  An example of this is the 1st
Infantry Division (The Big Red One) the 1st Armored Division (Ironsides
- -I think) and 1st Cavalry Divisions, etc... The numbers don\'t explain the
unit, the acronym after it does, usually.

From my experiences, what the solder considered his unit depended on his
position.  It seemed to extend 2 steps up the chain of command- for
example a driver would consider his unit to be his platoon (step 1-squad
leader, step 2-platoon leader)  and a squad leader (or "Tank Commander")
would consider it to be his company (step 1- platoon leader, step
2-company commander).  This is probably reinforced by the way they were
trained- they were briefed on what they were doing, and how that fit into
the plan for the next larger unit.  This was to insure that if their
immediate superior was rendered ineffective they could continue the
mission. 

Of course, I\'m sure other will have different opinions/points of view and
can correct, explain or disagree with what I\'ve said!

A 1G ship at full thrust takes about 7 days, one way in our
system. The ship can\'t maintain the same velocity within the
belt, though, since it has to match velocities with the objects
it\'s moving in. Try sticking a thruster pack on an snowball when
you\'re speeding past it at 10 km/sec some time. <g> (Kuiper
belters only *think* they\'re supermen).

A distribution where frequency decreases exponentially with
increasing size is more likely. An apparent "normal" distribution
is probably an artifact due to the increased difficulty of
detecting smaller objects. The density of matter out there
is pretty low: objects worth sending are going to be thousands of km apart
at best.  I checked detectability with the DSR: Objects shouldn\'t be too
hard to find, but if you have minimal sensors, it\'s going to take some
work.

A 1000 ton object is going to be around a few meters in diameter.
The several-km sized objects visible from earth with present sensors are a
billion times more massive: good luck pushing those around with a few
thrusters. In the meantime, it still takes on the order of
decades for an unpowered fall into the inner system once you do
nudge your snowball. (Halley\'s comet takes nearly 40 years from
somewhat closer than the Kuiper belt, IIRC)

  Are you suggesting that a non-disposable L-Hyd tank be allowed if it costs
the same as a hull(/internal tankage) in HG2 - i.e., KCr 50-120 per Dt?

  Inhabited world surface to orbit is Cr 20 per Dt; the entire system described

no more than twice that price rate. I suspect that most qualified observers
would
call that dirt cheap, come to think.

 They would turn into real AIR-heads and gear-heads.  Those systems were
 pnumatic and clockwork!  And you would really be surprised at all the things
 they could do in the way of process control.  Remember in WW2 the TDCs,
 Nordon bomb sights, and balistic targeting computer on ships were all

  In addition to picking up Far Trader on Sunday I also got a new CoC release
(now there\'s a thought for Traveller...) - a good 15% cheaper than the typical
TSR/WotC release these days, and an extra 50-100% the size. Of course, I can\'t
be sure of the page count of new AD&D/Alternity stuff as they\'re shipped
shrink-wrapped, but then Chaosium puts out material of such quality that
having a customer browse doesn\'t seem to worry them.

  TSR/WotC seems to have hit on a very special new mistake to make.

  So if KCr 1/Dt _isn\'t_ the only rate that can be charged for shipping then
the whole "market rate premium for express service" argument is over? That
means that we can get back to what the CT trade system would look like once
drop tanks completed their ascendance.

Mercenary and Striker give good discussions of various units of
soldiers, but they\'re long out of print.  Here is a list.  Bear in mind
that not every military system uses every unit listed, or doesn\'t use
them in every situation.

1) Individual soldier
2) Fireteam.  Usually 4 soldiers (per Striker), led by an E2 or E3. 
Almost always joined with another fireteam to make a squad.  I believe
that this level of unit is a recent development in the US military
hierarchy, dating from Vietnam.
3) Squad.  Usually about 10 soldiers, or 2 fireteams, but it could be
larger.  Led by an E4 or higher.
4) Section.  2 squads.  Led by an E4 or higher.
5) Platoon.  3 to 5 squads.  Led by 01 or 02.
6) Company.  2 to 5 platoons.  Led by 03.  (Also sometimes called troop
in cavalry units and battery in artillery units.)
7) Battalion.  2 to 5 companies.  Led by 04 or 05.
8) Regiment.  Size of a regiment varies with doctrine.  Some armies
don\'t have battalions, and regiments consist of several companies.  In
the 19th Century British army, a regiment had two battalions, one at
home and one posted abroad.  They would alternate every so often. 
Usually led by 06 (Colonel).
9) Brigade.  Again, size varies with doctrine, and some armies don\'t
have them at all. Usually led by 07 (Brigadier).
10) Division.  Size and composition vary.  Usually led by 08 or higher.  
11) Corps.  A number of divisions, usually 3, led by 08 or higher.  I
think that cavalry corps were called task forces by the US Army during
WW2.  This is often a provisional, temporary unit, assembled for a
specific campaign.
12) Army or Army Group.  A very big unit led by a very high ranking
officer.

I\'ll leave it to the veterans to answer your question about which unit a
soldier would think of as "his unit."

Actually I had a cheap oriental knock-off of a TRS-80, what was marketed as

memory upgrade involved soldering  piggy-backed TTL chip legs and using
"spare" gates on other chips for address decoding.

OK, so it wasn\'t the Mary Rose, I thought it was.

So, can anyone help me out and remember the English sailing ship that did
stay in service for around 300 years ?
Was it perhaps "Le Rose" or one of those other ships from AH\'s Kingmaker ?

Reminds me of an experience with a not first time GM in his mid twenties
who should have known better:

We were playing Runequest and had realised that he was only one line
ahead of us in reading the adventure. He decided to add some action
with a random encounter:

	"You encounter..."

	<fx of dice rolling>

	"...a tilled field!"

Unfortunately, his dice rolling was off that session and we randomly
encountered three more tilled fields later on.

He also did the classic GM disaster:

	"You enter the room.
	"There is a dragon hiding behind the curtain.
	"I shouldn\'t have read out that last bit."

When you look at the British Regimental system (arguably the most
successful example, and the one the US copied when they introduced
their Regimental System after Vietnam) the key is that the Regiments
have no operational existance. The Regiments are purely an administrative
construct. The Regiments are recruited territorially (ie all troops in a
Regiment will come from a particular geographic region). The new recruit
will be trained at the Regimental Depot and then posted out to a battalion.
During the last century, individual battalions could be posted out to the far
corners of the Empire for years on end, serve under higher commands;
and still retain their primary attachment to the Regiment. Actually the
situation of the last century is very similar to how things are likely to be in
the 3rd Imperium. Units serve on distant postings for many years, with
communications with the parent unit taking months. The British
Regimental system strikes me as a very good model for the Imperial Army.

TNE\'s Vampire Fleets included some nice complete deck plans [pg34-37] for "The
Ship" [ex ISS Archer] a somewhat dammaged Midu Agasham class destroyer infected
with strain XA Mother Virus.  it would not be hard to use
these as Imperial era deck plans.

I do not believe any GDW deck plans were ever done of any of the other ships you
mentioned, most of which are bigger than the typical ships GDW did deck plans for.
[The 3000 ton Midu Agasham may well have been the second largest ship (after the
Azhanti High Lightning] that GDW ever did deckplans for.]

Over-arching concept : GWP vs Trade

Knowing the GWP is nice for figuring things like local standards of living
and defense expenditure. Total trade is more important to determine how
much a world will want to import, or have available to export. I think of
Trade+GWP as a planet\'s turnover, while GWP is what they have left at the
end of the year after the megacorps, financiers, free traders and other
interstellar slime backed by the Imperium have finished exploiting them.

GWP is explained on G:T FT p14. Total trade can either be computed the long
way (by figuring relationships with every trading world - and Capital has
meaningful trade with just about everybody), or approximated by taking the
top end of the biggest trading partner (eg Pagaton\'s biggest trade partner
is Dallia, for a 8.5 BTN (MCr 500-GCr 1). Pagaton\'s total trade is
therefore around 1 GCr). If a world has a couple of equally large partners,
then add them up and add 50%. Generally, if you just look for the closest
big world, you can wing it.

Note the amount of money that can be raised by import and export duties.


Overarching concept : \'Trade Relationships are Social Relationships\'

Reputation and Status *always* count to modify appropriate skills. In the
Imperium, it\'s often not what you know, but who knows you, and how much
they trust you ...


Finding the Goods :

Each world with Trade below 7 will have 1d6 batches of Speculative Goods,
each of maximimum value of 1% of trade. Worlds with trade above 7 will have
2d6 batches of goods, each of maximum value 0.5% of Trade.

Finding the Goods is the same as G:T FT\'s Speculative Trade rules, except
that you add your Merchant skill/AK(World) and the world\'s WTN (it\'s a lot
easier, but you may get gouged by the locals on price). NB if this roll is
failed by more than the world\'s WTN, *nothing* is available for love or
money for the next (WTN-4) months. All the output is spoken for ...


Defining the Goods :

Roll for Origin Price. Goods are Cheap(KCr10), Shoddy (KCr20), Moderate
(KCr50), Expensive (KCr 100) and Stellar (MCr 1) class.

Origin Price is modified by goods being Poor, Average, Fine or Very Fine
examples of their type. Roll 3 dice, and compare with the table on G:B p45
- - multiply the Origin Price by 2, then by \'Probability of Success\' to find
the good\'s Fair Price. Poor is 3-8, Average is 9-11, Fine is 12-14, Very
Fine is 15+. Record the Fair Price.

Roll for Risk. Goods worth MCr 1/dton have a +7 to risk. KCr 100, +3. KCr
20, -3. KCr 10, -7

Roll 1-4 for Industrial, 5-6 Consumer. A world\'s demand for Industrial
goods is limited by it\'s interstellar Trade, while it\'s demand for Consumer
goods is limited by it\'s local GWP.

Roll 1-5 for Orthodox, 6 for Heterodox. Orthodox goods sell well on worlds
unlike the source world. Heterodox goods sell well on worlds like the
source world.

Roll for Special Handling. Ag world exports make Corrosive and Radioactive
into Perishable. Mining worlds turn Living into Delicate.

Roll on the world\'s Export Tables (the below are examples. The appropriate
professional skill is in parenthesis).
	Mining World : Roll 2 dice on the Cargo Type Table, then roll 1-2 for
Metal <Metallurgy>, 3-4 for Non-Metal<Prospecting> and 5-6 for Carbonaceous
<Chemistry>(eg you get a load of Carbonaceous Wet Bulk)
	Ag World : Roll 3 dice on the Cargo Type Table. RO/RO turns into
Container, Break Bulk turns into Dry Bulk. Roll 2 dice 2-3 for
Fibers<Sewing>, 5-6 for Animals (Living is Live Animals, otherwise Meat)
<Animal Handling/Cooking>, 7-8 for Food<Cooking>, 9-10 for Wood
Products<Carpentry>, 11 for Fertiliser <Agronomy>, 12 for Genetic
Material<Biology>. 
	Other : Roll 3 dice on Cargo Type Table. Then roll 3 dice on the
Manufactures Table on G:B p85 (get the skill and what it uses is that goods
type).

Lot size is determined by the Lot Size Table, with a maxima of of World
Trade as described in Finding the Goods (of course, correct planning and
the right leverage could cause a \'production shortfall\' ... this is
particularily true at small mining colonies, where a little cash and the
right goods (food, air filters, spare parts, pharmaceuticals) can cause
high grade ore that never appeared on the production schedules to
miraculously appear, ready for loading into a Far Trader that,
coincidentally, never appeared on the records either (this sort of \'theft
as servant\' is for my money the most widespread sort of smuggling in the
Imperium)...).

Roll for Trade Class Modifiers.

We now should have something like \'9 dtons of Bowman (1132) Carbonaceous
Wet Bulk <Poor Moderate KCr 38>, Orthodox Industrial, Medium Risk,
Explosive\' in the GMs records.

Assessing the Goods :

To assess the \'fair price\' of the goods, roll against Buyers skill - the
lower of Merchant and either AK(World) or the appropriate professional
skill for the good concerned. 

Professional skills for a good are determined by the skill that makes or
uses that good - Prospecting for mining worlds, Agronomy for Fertiliser,
Cooking for Food, Driving for Ground Vehicles, and so on ad infinitum.

If the Merchant has two of the skills at 12+, they get a +1. If they have
all the skills at 12+, then they get a +3. If they are assisted by another
person with the relevant professional skill at 12+, then they get the plus.

Success gets an assessment of the goods quality band. Success by 3 gets the
exact Fair Price. Critical Success means the seller assumes the goods are
of lower quality than they are - halve the Locals Skill in the Closing the
Deal step.

Closing the Deal :

Now, the players may try and buy it ... roll an opposed contest of skills
between Buyers Skill and Locals Skill.

Locals skill is a base two, plus 2.5x WTN for goods worth less than KCr 30
per dton, 3x WTN for goods worth less than KCr 75 per dton, 3.5x WTN for
goods worth less than KCr 100, 4x WTN for goods worth more than a MCr per
dton. If the GM can automatically see a profitable route, adjust the
locals\' skill, according to how profitable the route seems ... they might
be yokels, but they dont have to be stupid. If the world is Amber Zoned,
locals skill is reduced by 3 due to risk premiums. If it is a Red Zone, it
is reduced by 5 die to desperation.

Buyers skill is the lower of Merchant and either AK(World) or the
appropriate professional skill for the good concerned. If the Merchant has
two of the skills at 12+, they get a +1. If they have all the skills at
12+, then they get a +3.

If they are assisted by another person with the relevant professional skill
at 12+, then they get the plus.

To find the Agreed Origin Price, take the Fair Price, assume a roll of 11
on the \'Destination Price Table\', modifying the roll by 1 for every point
the PC wins or loses by, and by 1-4 depending on how hazardous shipping the
good is (\'Our regular shipper found that he was Held Covered if he shipped
it, so he cancelled. This caused us cash flow difficulties ...\').

The players *can* bail on the deal at this point, at risk of getting a bad
Reputation (Unrealiable, Merchants).

The GM then writes up the good, remembering to write in the Actual Price,
and keep the Fair Price secret in their records, and gives it to the
players, ready for entry into the Ships Logs and (perhaps) the Annual Report.

The Players now have their good ... 

Moving the Goods :

Remember any Special Handling that may be needed, and note that the owners
of freight (or their insurers lawyers) may get upset if the Ships Captain
pays more attention to saving her goods than their in an emergency ...
remember the Damage to Cargo rule on G:T FT p71.

Finding a Buyer :

Follow the G:T Spec Trade rules as written.

If working without the assistance of a local broker, making a \'Find Buyer\'
roll exactly means the buyer will only deal on 60 day terms - the seller
delivers now, and gets an IOU payable in 60 days.

A Broker may be prepared to act as a Factor and pay the PCs a percentage of
face value on the note (treat the note itself as a Low Risk Speculative
Good with a value of 95% of face value).

If the seller is working with the assistance of a Broker, then always
getting paid in cash is one of the services that makes their fee worthwhile.

Selling the Goods :

Follow the G:T Spec Trade rules as written, except the Destination Price
uses the secret Fair Price, and a world can only spend 5% of it\'s GWP on a
single batch of Consumer goods. A world can spend 10% of it\'s Trade on a
single batch of Industrial goods, but Industrial goods dont get Distance
Mods on the Trade Goods Reaction Table (no-one cares how close the air
filters come from, just as long as they work. Brandy, on the other hand ...).

Orthodox goods get a + 0.5 on the Trade Goods Reaction Table for every
Trade Code they do not share with the destination world and a -0.5 for
every Trade Code they do share. Opposite Trade codes get a +/- 1 instead
(Ag is opposite of Non-Ag, Ind is opposite of non-Ind, De is opposite of
Wa, Extreme is opposite of Ri, Lo is opposite of Hi). Heterodox goods
reverse this. This is in addition to any Trade Class Modifiers.

If a trader is prepared to take commodities in exchange, these numbers may
be increased by 50% (GMs option) (the \'We cannot front, but we have many
excellent tractor parts\' rule).

Competition, the fly in the ointment :

<nb I am indebted to Paul Mays for this>

As can be noted, highly skilled traders can make a lot of money under these
rules. Two possible consequences may exist.

The first possible concequence is that an established line or even a
megacorp may notice a hotshot Free Trader and either decide that they
should be working for them, or that they should find a new career.
Reluctance to co-operate may be met with an escalating series of sanctions.

The second possibility is that one or more less-skilled Free Traders may
realise that following Our Hotshot wherever they go is a good business
plan. Discovering Our Hotshot\'s flight plan by corrupt means or following
them out of the starport to detecting their ships\' direction of the jump,
should reveal Our Hotshot\'s intended destination. Once in that port, local
brokers can be advised that whatever Our Hotshot bids on a lot will be met
or exceeded. Locals may also realise that the mere fact of Our Hotshot\'s
interest indicates that maybe their speculative goods are worth more than
they thought. 

GMs should also consider making up NPC ship crews, and having them
interested in the same goods, leading to an auction situation for any given
batch of speculative goods.



Optional Rules :

Option #1 - \'Do you have it in blue ?\'

Once you have found a good, for every sourceworld WTN point, you can get a
+/- 1 DM to any of Origin Price, Risk or Lot Size (nominate DMs before any
rolls), or get extra rolls on Trade Class Modifiers. The logic is that
worlds with big economies have more chances at getting exactly what you want.

Option #2 - \'I have a cousin. He owns the factory\'

Custom batches are possible and takes one month or longer. Design the good,
pay cash in advance and roll Legal skill, limited by Area Knowledge, at -1
per point of CR for the world to avoid unexpected contractual difficulties.
The manufacturer then rolls against their skill to get it right.

Option #3 - The Asteroid Belt exemption

Many worlds have an Asteroid Belt in addition to the mainworld. The
Asteroid belt counts as a seperate system 1 parsec from the mainworld. It
is an Amber Zone unless the mainworld is Hi Pop or Industrial and TL9 or
better. It is usually Pop (Mainworld-3), and usually shares Gov type and
Law Level with the mainworld.

Option #4 - \'I bought some off you last month\'

If a batch has been bought, you can make another Find Goods Roll to find
another batch (possibly of a different size). Every time this is done after

Well, here\'s how the Imperial Army functions IMTU:

First of all, based on the game FFW and the CT/MT character generation
system, the Imperium has no reserve force comparable to the National Guard
or Territorials.  I base everything off that simple fact.  In time of war,
the Imperium relies on three sources for military power:

1) The regular Imperial Army.  This consists of a large number of sophonts
in direct Imperial service, equipped, trained and utilized by the Imperium.
During peacetime, they would tend to be based at a few, key, locations, with
small forces staioned as peacekeepers or garrisons where necessary.  By
canon, Imperial units are organized into varying size units, with none being
consistently mentioned as the basic building block.  IMTU, it is the
battalion.  Battalions are part of a regiment, which are set up as above.  A
regiment\'s recruiting area is rarely, if ever, a single world, as the
feeling is that this would tend to produce units more loyal to a world than
the Imperium.  Instead, the subsector is the basic recruiting area.
Depending on the population, there will be 2 or more battalions per
regiment, with at least one stationed in the subsector, and at least one "on
the frontier", the obvious exception being those subsectors directly along a
hostile border.  Subsectors with large populations will have several
regiments, and no regiment has more than 8-10 battalions.   Above the
battalion, units are typically "brigaded", i.e., two or more battalions form
a brigade, which has little if any tradition of it\'s own.  Brigades tend to
swap battalions frequently (every several years, in peacetime), and are
broken up and assembled as required.  Higher level units are similar
conglomerations.  Battalions tend to move every couple of years, at the
least.  Individual soldiers enlisting or being commissioned within a
regiment will, as far as possible, be always posted to a battalion of that
regiment.  While they will be posted away for schools, special duty, etc.,
they know they will eventually return.   BTW, when several battalions from
the same regiment form a brigade, it is called a "Regimental Combat Team",
just to confuse things.  This happens mainly in elite units, such as drop
troops.

2)  Wartime mobilization.  In case of a large war, the Emperor may direct
some Regiments to raise additional battalions.  These are typically formed
around a cadre of veterans from the regiment, and are dissolved once the
crisis ends.  Most regiments contain at a battalion at cadre level in case
this happens, especially those located in the interior.

3)  Colonial Forces.  Individual worlds within the Imperium maintain armies,
with (surprise!) about 11,000 different organizations.  The only requirement
is that they be organized tactically the same as Imperial forces.  Thus
there will be all sorts of weird unit designators floating around if they
are called into Imperial service.  Note that planetary forces will rarely be
brigaded with Regulars.


Designators:
An Imperial Battalion is referred to as the x battalion of the y regiment.
x will be a numeral, y will be either a name or a number, or both, and will
also include a title describing the branch.  Examples:

1st Battalion, Deneb Light Infantry
3rd Battalion, 514th Jump Infantry (Regina Rifles)
4th Battalion, Emperor\'s Own Solomani Tank Regiment
5th Battalion, Marquis of Fornice\'s Lancers
1st(Corridor) Battalion, Imperial Vargr Rangers

Many regiments will include a patron\'s title, and each regiment will
jealously gaurd its traditions and title.  For example, calling a member of
the 514th Jump Regiment anything other than "Rifleman" will probably start a
fight.  Other oddities will include non-standard ranks- the Vargr Rangers
use naval ranks, because of their origin as stranded ship\'s crew fighting as
infantry, for example.  These sort of quirks add realism, well as being "a
hoot".  Finally, every regiment has *something* to distinuish it as an item
of uniform, and will display said item wherever and whenever possible.

BTW, if YTU uses some variation of this system, former members of "the
Regiment" will be great patrons, contacts, etc.

I\'m not sure, but you seem to be both saying the same thing, ie assigned
permanently to the same regiment but with changing higher command
structure.

It all depends on what you see as the largest tactical unit. For large scale
actions (eg WWII) it might be the division. For smaller scale actions
(eg shipboard marines) it could even be the company or platoon.

If the unit is too large, you could end up having to deploy several
BatRons of Tigresses into an area just the keep the Marines together.

There seems to be some question about how much we can deduce about
TL15 computers, based on our experience with TL7 ones.

Some say the fundamental principles (boolean logic, bootstrap code, etc)
stay the same, some say that everything could be different.

I would like to propose a different starting point.
I\'m not saying it models how things are in Traveller at TL15, but
it starts with the most powerful computer system we currently know of.

The Human Brain.

I\'m not saying that a model/9 computer has a human brain in it or even
some genetically engineered brain stuff - after all, it is capable of
doing things that we can\'t (ie ensuring thata jump-6 plot goes where it
is supposed to) and cannot do things that we can (like be "sentient").

So what are the specs?
Well, I may be wrong, but:

	Can change its internal structure.

	Its internal structure depends on its external environment,
	especially its mechanical housing.

	Cannot be reloaded from backup.

	Cannot be copied.

	Can be programmed.

	Programming changes the internal structure.

	Can be affected by viruses. :-)

Personally, I have a much better high tech science feel about Traveller
computers if I start with a brain as my model rather than letting my
players defeat a meglomaniac computer by getting to the main console
and hitting Ctrl-Alt-Del with a clean system disk in drive A.

<rant>

	I develop something that takes decades for a TL17 research
	station with state of the art equipment, unlimited funds
	and hundreds of the finest minds in that field from the whole
	Imperium.
	Then people require that a PC with Computer-6 on a tramp
	freighter and a model/1 computer should be able to defeat
	it by rolling on:

	Remove TNE Virus: Impossible, Computer, Int, 1 hour, fateful

	I am sure that some would complain about "fateful" and others
	would argue for "uncertain".

There\'s a LONG list.  Start back with the Nordon bomb sight and the inigma
device and go up through barber-colmans and moores.  Toss in WW2 TDCs and
balistic targeting computers and you have a start.  Do not forget the
difference engine in the smithsonian though or the old mechanical cash
registers.

If the defenders are now hiding in gas giants, behind asteroids,
under the oceans or just trying to look like space debris,
it might take less than one week to move between places within
the system, but how long does it take to search each place?

I would suggest that travel plus search = 1 TCS turn per fleet
division per location.

Now you have a shell game, except that the defenders cannot move
between locations (from the DSR, any amount of thrust in open
space will be noticed),

If it\'s going to take months to search the whole system, how many
locations does the attacker search? If the attacker searches too
many at once, he might not have enough force at some to win.

How does the attacker know that *all* the defender\'s forces have
been found. Perhaps only one of the defender\'s SDBs attacked.
Perhaps the crew of the only SDB admitted under interrogation
that there were actually two but you can\'t find the other one.
Even the Zhodani can fall for this if the captain believes there
is a second.

And when the attacker finally decaleres the system safe, does he
still escort the supply convoys?

====

One failing I find with many "god games" is that the victor of a
battle gains the production of the system and the forces that it
can support.

History suggests that most of the time, the resources gained
won\'t offset the cost of garrisoning them and the reduction
in your opponent\'s resources barely pay for your losses in
gaining them, although when the original owner returns, they
should get back a much larger proportion or the original
capacity.

Viruses today are much easier to \'cure\' that to write.  Prehaps it will
always be so.  I would not risk my life in a ship with a computer that could
not be flushed and rebuilt if necessary.  It\'s not like you can get out and
walk home.  

What happened to backups and safety systems?  Are people in the traveller
universe just plain stupid?  Or do they have a death wish?  Most traveller
designs have almost no redundancy built in.  Look at the scout ship.
Designed to be the first on \'out there\' with only one computer, only enough
fuel for only the outbound trip, and no fuel processor.  Briliant!  No
wonder the scouts wanted an azanti high lightning class cruiser.  It must be
that the 3I uses the lowest bidder just like the US military.

The leviathan is the only remotely sencable exploritory design I\'ve seen in
cannon.

I believe that currently they fail Charles\' requirements because they

That, IMO, is their mistake. Virus is a plot device. It shouldn\'t be
explained, just described. To me, Virus is a magic... sorry, I meant
psionic, of course... entity with some well-defined behaviour rules
to let me know how it works in a campaign.

Psionics is the magic of the Traveller universe. You don\'t have to
explain WHY psionics works, you just have to describe HOW it works.

I have some trouble with one particular aspect of the Virus story, but
that pertains to various human deeds and reactions that I find flat out
implausible. Virus itself don\'t need justification. It\'s a given

Found your post on Fleet Ops interesting, since I have being looking at a 
comparable project myself.  I do have some thoughts about how a player 
should be able to apply the system you are working on in order to achieve 
strategic objectives.

First, you looked at the main point of why you would want to hold on in a 
system as being to wait for relief.  What *I* want to do is hide a part (or 
most of) my fleet until you leave.  That means your system must allow for 
strategic uncertainty -- I must be able to have concealed units that my 
opponent is not aware of.

What would I do with this?  Divide the fleet, TF 1.1 hides on planet, 
asteroid belt, whatever.  TF 1.2 hides in gas giant and related moons.  TF 
1.3 comes out and gives you a good fight and runs for it.  Great, you say, 
your fleet has won.

Now you move on.  Once you are gone for a while, TF 1.2 starts sniping at 
your re-fueling transports, 1.1 contests system control if odds look good, 
etc.

Now, as the aggressor, how can I respond to this?

"One big fleet" can\'t search a whole solar system in a week (IIRC, a TCS 
turn is a week), I will have to disperse and start searching.  Note number 
of units and elint capability are key factors, not size of individual ships. 
  This brings fighters back to effectiveness with a real vengeance -- along 
with other light units.

If I am doing refueling ops, I will have to escort my tankers -- more 
dispersion of resources.

The tactical situation now gets interesting, especially with elint and 
hidden units.  Can I mask or hide my heavies and bait out a part of your 
fleet, then bounce it (essentially what the Germans were trying to do at 
Jutland)?

This can get very interesting while still staying a hex-and-vector free 
system.

As I say, I have been looking at this for a while.  Drop me a note if you 
would like to do share a few more ideas.

If every system has a mainworld, two or three gas giants, a research

My rules set makes a defended gas giant a real hornet\'s nest for
an intruder to attempt refueling in - *everything* puts the advantage
towards small SDB\'s. Spinal mounts, bay weapons, screens, agility,
even computer ratings simply don\'t work properly while you\'re on a
high-speed refueling run through a gas giant atmosphere. The defenders
get many of these limitations as well, but generally have far fewer of
these capabilites to lose.

Ever wonder what happens to a 60KdTn cruiser when it\'s fire control
doesn\'t work well enough to do point defense, while the attacking
SDB flight has just enough fire control to get a nuclear missile
contact hit? Want to see it while the cruiser is flying through 
monster-hurricane level storms in a rapidly-increasing gravity well? ;-)

How does the attacker know that *all* the defender\'s forces have

Perhaps the crew of the only SDB admitted under interrogation
that there were actually two but you can\'t find the other one.
Even the Zhodani can fall for this if the captain believes there
is a second.

And when the attacker finally decaleres the system safe, does he
still escort the supply convoys?

One failing I find with many "god games" is that the victor of a

History suggests that most of the time, the resources gained
won\'t offset the cost of garrisoning them and the reduction
in your opponent\'s resources barely pay for your losses in
gaining them, although when the original owner returns, they
should get back a much larger proportion or the original
capacity.
>>>>>>>>>>>
TCS provides a pretty long time period between capture of a system
and use of resources. Refueling facilities can be used quickly, but
shipyards take time on the order of months or a year IIRC. The rules
also provided guidelines for sabotage of ships the original owner of the
system was building or repairing as he loses the system.

I\'ve received a Galileo-related update from NASA
which explains for all time why there will be
*NO* fuel skimming around the poles of gas giants.
Keep in mind while you\'re reading the following that
300 miles an hour winds are strong enough to
destroy even hardened buildings.

Of course, if anyone can come up with a reason why
fuel skimming could be done at the poles, I\'d love
to hear it. About the only thing I can think of
is to have a total lack of near moons so the Io
effect is avoided.

The article can also be used as is for the basis of
a scientific adventure if the somewhat standard
shoot-\'em-up becomes old hat.

I agree, but notice how many gas giants some systems have. A frontier
subsector is going to have dozens of gas giants to defend - that\'s one 
reason my rule set makes gas giants so relatively easy to protect.

I could imagine planning a defense strategy around important worlds
rather than a sealed frontier, simply because it\'s so expensive to seal
off every gas giant, minor water-harboring planet and ice-capped planetoid
on the border.

You could probably invest a starport E pop 1 world with a pinnace.
You might want to, if it had a safer fuel source than that gas giant
that might be hosting a hundred hidden SDB\'s.

They\'ll be perfectly reliable when serving the purpose for which they

starship fuel tanks, then this purpose needs to be carefully limited
to show *why* they are so much cheaper than built-in fuel tanks.

For example, maybe they need much more regular refurbishing. Perhaps 
where a starship uses a double-wall tank with a catalyst within the double-
wall, a drop tank uses a single-wall with a cheap liner that will degenerate
within days (weeks?) after fueling and need to be replaced.

  It almost certainly wasn\'t a warship then - design changed too much from
1600 to 1900, or even 1550 to 1850.

That sounds like an interesting idea. Anyone have an economics model
of drop tank effects in a spreadsheet, so they could see the effects with
much more expensive drop tanks that could (at cost to operate tugs and
perform minor tank maintenance) have a service life of 10 years or more?

  Someone from sf-consim might correct me, but ISTR that Battlefleet Mars
assumed low-ish tech (very by Trav standards) - the ships use low thrust
high fuel efficiency drives in-system, and chemical drives in combat; they
simply couldn\'t afford to radically alter their trajectores once they began
a strategic deployment.

It depends what your job is. A type S is *not* a full survey vessel. It\'s
even been described in a subordinate vessel role - a big Scout Cruiser 
voyages through an unexplored cluster, with individual scout ships
ranging out and back from the Cruiser\'s course. If it finds anything
interesting enough for a full survey, then either the Cruiser goes to check
it out or they log it for later follow-up. If a type S misses a rendezvous,
the Scout Cruiser (which may be something like an Azhanti High Lightning)
goes looking for it.

I think most Type S scouts are in the courier role anyway - take info and
small packages from a civilized planet to a backwater, but still civilized
planet. The computer is reliable to a fault (works on a 13- on 2d6, 
modified for battle damage and evil GM tricks), the drives have a bonus
on the misjump roll for being Scout drives that more than makes up for
any unrefined fuel penalty...now if they could just fix that blasted
air filter system... <G>

Leviathan was intended to perform fast, detailed surveys of potential
resource and/or market worlds. The crew ar merchants, not scouts - they
demand a safer and stronger ship, must be to maintain that 4+ (IIRC)
survival roll. I almost think Leviathan was overkill - extra drives? Maybe
for someone on the way to the galactic core, but for a couple month
voyage?

And don\'t even start with her jump message torpedos... <WEG>

Walt Smith
>>>> (end quoted material)
For new construction from the keel up, yes a ship would take months or
years.  On ther other hand, jury-rigged conversions of existing ships
would be much quicker.  For example, a number of the early aircraft
carriers were merchant hulls that were already largely complete, and
slapped a big flat deck on top and rerouted the smoke stacks to the
side.  This got them ready in a few months rather than multi-years. 
These converted ships were quickly superseded by purpose-built ships,
but provided the quick fix needed.

I can see a starport under seige conditions do conversions of ships
already on the ways, and even some already running ships to make more
combat vessels.  Some conversions, like putting a couple of 50dton
fighters in a subsidized merchant and launching them out the bow and
stern loading doors, would take perhaps a week or two to implement. 
converting a larger merchant by adding turrets to empty hardpoints
should take a few days.  Adding hardpoints and computer support on a
larger merchant may take a few weeks or months to do.  Stuffing a bay
weapon (or to be ridiculous, a spinal mount) into a larger merchant
would probably take quite a bit longer, but might well be quicker than
building a ground-up military vessel.

I suspect this would be more common for smaller polities, since the 3I
seems to have a policy of just giving ground slowly until the
reinforcements arrive.  A smaller polity (the Darrians say) don\'t have
that much ground to give up, and may encourage merchants to have a full
complement of hardpoints, even if they don\'t have turrets fitted
normally.

change beyond all recongition to suit you?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'d say most others are still recognizing what I\'m talking about. 

Nothing MUST change. Some things WILL change over thousands of
years. There are parameters provided to computer technology in the
canonical Third Imperium that are questionable, even ridiculous, if current
theories about trends in computer science continue. We can either
reject everything about CT computer science, or speculate on causes.
If the speculation is interesting, we can have some fun with it and maybe
even generate some nice color pieces or adventure hooks for others
to use.

Charles again:

Where in canon is self reconfiguring conputers?  Book and page please.

Drat, now I have to go look something up. I recall it mentioned in 
TNE (at least), but I\'ll have to dig it out.

"Land transport vehicles are here today, they just do not behave as you

Listen up you speculative fictionist, WAGONS have wooden wheels,
each one is custom made, and they\'re moved by perfectly good oxen
that eat hay and are produced by breeding!  If you\'re not talking about
vehicles exactly like our wagons, then you and I can\'t even TALK to
one another!!"  - Charles\' ancestor, c.1200AD   :-)

Charles again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
 The reconfiguration does not change the basic nature
of there structure it just optomises them.  It will have to remain this way
in the future or you would have no standard to work form to write your
programs.  Programer DO exist in canon.  There are also some ugly trade offs when you drop the reconfiguration below a curtain level.  You end up 
with to much hardware overhead.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'ve been seeing my matrix model as an optimized processing & memory
module for a set of hardware, perhaps with some data storage capability.
It\'s customized for the specific environment it works in - much like a
TL15 version of you popping out an Ethernet card and popping in an FDDI
card when you move your server from one environment to another, but
for processor architechture instead of IO.

Charles again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Isn\'t the Traveller universe more interesting if the above is *possible*?

No, just much less believable and less playable sence the players and GM
have no common reference points.  Tell me how a computer tech. charater
could even being to discribe in character his actions when your \'magic\'
computer is so far beyond the players understanding he does not have words to discibe his actions.

Role playing is then reduced to "I role against my comp-4 skill" instead of
allowing the player the chalendge of trying methods he can name like \'power
on reset\', \'disk rebuild\', \'boot clean\', or \'core dump\'.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Geez. Do you have players that are entertained by role-playing the
pushing of a reset button and running Norton Disk Doctor? That sounds
just too damn painful for words.

Charles again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>
When a player feels confident in his knowledge of what his character can do
then he can act.  When he has to ask what his character knows about a skill he has he drops out of character and you loose a little of the feel of the
world you are trying to play in.  
>>>>>>>>>>>>
Engineer. Navigator. Robotics. Gravitics. Electronics. Mechanical.
Jack-of-all-Trades. Tactics. Traveller\'s Computer skill is in good company.

GM\'s explanation: you have Computer skill. In general, this means
that you can operate, repair, understand, and even (given lots of time)
program computers. Here is a sample list of what you can get computers
to do, given enough processing power and programming time (shows
player list of computer models and programs from the rulebook).  

I don\'t see the problem. If anything, a player with Computer skill has much
*more* idea of what he can do in a TL15 society than a player with
Electronics skill does, based on background material available in the 
basic rules set.

Charles again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Who\'s to say a comp-6 could not defeat the virus and get the
computer back on line?  Sure he\'s not \'inside the computer\' but then again
the virus is \'in the box\' and that PC has access to some very big hammers
and the main fuse boxes!
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
You can always defeat virus by destroying the computer it lives in.
Now try rebuilding the computer, with no tools that you\'re sure haven\'t
been infected.

TNE seemed to say that the lower-tech the computer, the easier it was
to repair. Perhaps TL7 troubleshooting techniques work to defeat
virus on a wide span of tech levels - until the paradigm changes enough
that the TL7 computer theorist is a caveman trying to run a nuclear
power plant.

Just a thought:

Did you ever notice that, in Traveller, the same skill covers operation, 
programming, theory, and repair of computers? Why would that be?
What change would have had to occur in how computers work to
make a programmer have to know how to rebuild a computer, just
to do his job? Or is repairing or rebuilding a TL15 computer never more 
complicated than popping prebuilt modules together?

I realize that Traveller\'s Computer skill was written to abstract a 
technical skill, and was written with a knowledge of 1970\'s computer
science. Still, this provides a parameter of how Computers work in
the Traveller setting. What explanation can we come up with for
why a Computer skill has to be so wide-ranging?

	Nope, it\'s on the submissions "wishlist" at SJG\'s website.  Sean Punch (GURPS Line Editor) 
is very enthusiastic about it.  I gather he imagines a book full of customized modules, deckplans, 
and background on their uses.  Personally, I\'d rather see a book that takes the same approach to 
the Scout/Courier, Free Trader, and Far Trader since these are ships players are much more likely 
to own. *shrug*

Have you played any of the nth Fleet wargames (By Victory Games)? Modern

HMS Victory is still in commission - she\'s currently flagship of the
Home Fleet. I\'m not so certain that it has been a constant commission
since she was launched, though.

Can\'t help there as I\'ve never heard of a ship being in service such a
long time, unless you are thinking of HMS Victory (Built 1765, still
on the RN\'s list of Commissioned Ships)

Thanks for the idea. I have 6th Fleet and 2nd Fleet by VG, I think I will look 
them over for ideas on combat stores.

I recall a bit from the Star Wars RPG, they note that an X-Wing fighter
has fuel and supplies that will last for days under normal cruising,
but will be expended in minutes of intense combat.

I didn\'t know that you were comparing it to those three things in particular
;)

Seriously though, I\'m a big fan of a *lack* of consistency myself. Then
again, MTU contains biological, dynamically-reconfiguring computers that
taste like trail mix or a fortune cookie when someone dries them out...

(Okay, I borrowed that from Bruce Sterling, but it adds great color to a
campaign... "Damn, we\'re out of rations and we\'re stuck here on this planet
until the impies come to rescue us... Let\'s cook the comp!")

Then again, I\'ve broken nearly every canon law (intentionally or
unintentionally) when running games, so maybe MTU isn\'t a good example.

just want whatever it ends up to fit canon without having to toss out reason
to believe it.  The available canon does not leave a lot of wiggle room.
Until virus I could have cared less what the nature of the traveller
computers was.  As far as I was concurned it was a mainframe that did what
was needed but with virus and the need for PCs to interact with it, even
just to fight it, it became necessary to define the \'playing field\' that the
contest was to take place on.  

It would be grossly unfair to put PCs against the virus without knowing what
was and was not posible and to be able to deal with the players actions in a
logical, consistent, and fair way.  If I as GM do not know viruses limits
how can I play it as an NPC?

If it\'s psionic what is the range of it\'s \'possess computer core\' power?
How mant psi points does it take?  How many does the virus have?  Is it
dependant on the coputer\'s size?  Is the virus\' IQ based on the computer\'s
size?  The single most important NPC type in the era is almost totally
undefined.

OK, I could live with that if the limits of that power is defined.

How far away does this psionic power work?  Point\'s require to posess a
computer on a given size?  Points available to the virus to use this power?
Time it takes to recover thos points once used?

With that infomation, the virus can be put against PCs and the GM will be
able to play the virus fairly.

But this begs the questions, if it is psionic:

Will a psishield stop it?

Can a psi fight it?

Why does it need the transponder at all?  

Why is an isolated computer immune?

Why is a computer without a transponder take longer to take over?

Why does it need a com connection?

I\'ve got even more news for you.  Babage\'s difference engine could in theory
have been built with only water power and medevil metalurgy.  It was just a
very complecated clock after all.

A slide rule could be built by nearly any tool using people that can do math.

Give them paper and watch out!

I\'d like to take the concept a little bit further. The sophonts in question
don\'t end up choosing digital computers over analog ones, digital
computers simply never occur to them - the idea of something being
absolutely one thing or the other is just too alien to them. Thus, 
instead of abandoning analog computers, they develop them - even
overdevelop them. To them, thinking in this form is normal, their computer
theory won\'t have an absolutist logic at it\'s base.

A supercomputer is just a very complicated adding machine. What would
these sophonts\' "very complicated clocks" be capable of after 1000 years
of development?

I\'ve been thinking about these critters for a bit, trying to figure out what
their technology would be like. They may be a bit too alien, though - 
just trying to understand their concept of scientific method drives me nuts.

Hey, look at me, I\'m live-action roleplaying an IISS Sophontologist!! :)

The range of a communicator or hard-wired network. It is not telepathic,
but must work through a carrier signal like a transponder or modem.

It doesn\'t use psi points as characters do ...

or

It does, but you don\'t need to worry about it (cause it\'s a plot device).
Kind of like a major deity in AD&D ...

or

However many you want to give it as a referee.


>With that infomation, the virus can be put against PCs and the GM will be

How so? It\'s sole psi power is limited to infecting other systems and
reproducing itself.


>But this begs the questions, if it is psionic:
>Will a psishield stop it?

Only if the psi shield stops a radio carrier signal (it doesn\'t use
traditional telepathy "mind-control waves," whatever *those* are).


>Can a psi fight it?

Possibly, if he has computer empathy and other unspecified powers (as left
open to the Referee in the TNE rules).
Maybe a templar chaplain can cast a rite of exorcism. ;-)


>Why does it need the transponder at all?

This is it\'s medium of possession. Not all psionic powers are telepathy.

\'Cause not all psionic powers are telepathy.

I dunno about that.

One immediate physical characteristic stands out to me: they won\'t have
individual digits in their manipulative organs, perhaps just variable
size tentacles extruded from their body as needed for manipulation. 

All math ultimately derives from counting on your fingers; _counting_
may well be foreign to them. Only varying degrees of \'many-ness\'

That makes understanding them hard...yes my head hurts after a little
while here. 

They wouldn\'t have set theory, either, as that also involves a binary
distinction. They may well have developed it by the time they arrive at
starflight (if they do), it will be as hard to them as stuff like
quantum physics is to most of us...things like binary logic and set
theory do not operate on \'common sense\' rules to them.

Their language would probably be a contiuous modulated tone, if they use
sound to communicate. Ideas would be communicated by the frequency,
amplitude and most importantly, rate of change if the tone. They could
likely communicate to each other simultaneously, in a multiplex fashion,
using differing base frequencies. For color, no pun intended, they could
also use color changes and patterns as a component of commmunication,
much like certain species of squids apparently do. 

There, we have a nickname for them...Squids, though they\'ll likely be
more like large intelligent amoebas.

The IISS will go NUTS trying to translate their communications.

Thanks for the post, Bruce - I hadn\'t twigged on the lack of countable
manipulatory appendages.

My original idea for these guys started with an old sketch of a critter with
a big eye. My thought was that they would communicate with continuously
changing color patterns in the eye itself, with massive amounts of
information being communicated at any time - a necessity if your world
concepts are all matters of degree, you can\'t answer any questions
with Yes or No. I don\'t know that communication would necessarily
be slow, just (to humans) agonizingly complete.

Intelligent amoeboids - makes me think of the Rame from SPI\'s 
_Starforce_ universe. The Rame were groupmind creatures, though -
but I have an idea that these analog aliens might *seem* like groupmind
creatures to an IISS First Contact team. They don\'t communicate in
symbols, they communicate in entire concept structures, with the
meaning interactively changing as it\'s presented (due to the continuous
response of the "speaker" to the communications of the "listeners").

Imagine standing up and declaring, "Kissenger\'s _On Diplomacy_" - 
and in stating that, you\'ve transmitted the core ideas of the book, your
emotional state regarding the ideas, and your responses to the
audiences\' critiques of both the core ideas and your attempts to relate
the ideas to your worldview. Now imagine that every instance of
communication in your society occurs on that level.

They could probably fill a hospital ship with the IISS linguists driven
nuts over these sophonts... :-)

It is DOS.  DOS is a generic term referring to ANY disk operating system and
it is often used to refer to the entire IO interface functality even though
operating system is the better term.  It is an industry standard term.  Like
serial, ROM, and RAM.  Note also that unix the operating system for many
main frames is also a form of a DOS.

That is not what I ment.  The nature of the reconfiguration is limited due
to the overhead in the process.  You reach a point of deminishing returns.
This has nothing to do with materials science.  It is a fact of the
implimentation.  To be recongiqurable you mush have a mechanism for that
reconfigurations.  The more complexe and low level the reconfiguration the
more complex and bulky the reconfiguration system.  The bigger the longer
the conductive track and the longer the propagation delay.  Zero sum gain or
perhaps even a performace lose.

The problem with that analagy is that the equilent of a person who did the
card change must be built into the system.  That is the overhead.  The
reconfig system wil have to be as or more complexe than the processor sence
it has to in effect contain all the possible permutations and or the
capacity to create them.

So does having a expert only able to exercise his expertese by dice roling.
I prefer to role the dice as little as posible in a game.  I prefer the
players to think and act not depend on the dice.  Add the reset and rebuild
can be quite interesting when there is only barely enough time to fix the
problem before the ships burns up in reentry.  Say there is enough time for
three tries.  What three ways are you going to try?  Can you learn enough on
the first two so the third will work?  Can the ex-marine fight his way pass
the virus infected steward robot in time to set the charge on the
transponder so that you last attempt has some chance to succeed?

Or it could be an oversimplified game mechanic.  If it were not there would
be a separate skill list for specialists.  There is not so they just chose
to use very broad catagories.  It prabably is for the best that they did.
With the few skills the most traveller characters have they would not be
able to do much if the skills were narrowly defined.

Now in GT they are narrowly definded.  A computer operations skill would let
a person run a ship\'s computer but unless his skill was master level or
above he would have no chance against the virus.

Computer programing skill would let him know that he was fighting a virus
and give him a fighting chance.  His skill vs the viruses to gain temperary
control and take an action.  The virus would have a skill in the 20+ range
and be able to take a lot of actions for every one the programer tries.
Like opening the airlocks to prevent another attempt.

A cyber jock with a hot ROM deck and an enviromental interface could face
the virus on almost even terms.  With SOTA military Ultra back combat
software he\'d be in good shape.  Such a person should be able to completely
clean nearly any system given time but there are very few of these arround.
This would be a 200+ point character.

An electronics engineer would attack the problem in a completely different way. 
Assuming that the virus reconfigured the system as we have been discussing:
He\'d pull the plug, manually reset the system, and phyiscally lock the
configurasion before rebooting.  In effect reducing the systems TL and
making the system immune to the virus.  This would slow the system way way
down but if you had to you could batch proccess your programs on a as needed
basis.  This would get you back to base were you could bebuild your ships
systems with many smaller less powerfull units to prevent the virus from
ever waking up.

Or he\'d set up a watchdog circuit that would recycle any sub-processor that
tried to execute any code he had not personally CRCed and flaged.  In effect
a non distructive firewall.  By watching the hit rates he could box the
virus in, back to it\'s seed or fort and lazer torch that subsystem.

A GURPs psi with machine psionics skills could \'mind wipe\' the virus.

A GURPS technomage could exercise it or make it his slave!

GURPS gives you more skills but narrowly defined.  It\'s aa matter of taste
as to which you like.  I like both GURPS an CT.  I think GURPS better
reflect how people learn and use skills but CT is a lot faster it play.

Taveller trades realisim for a simpler mechanic.  It replaces many separate
skills with one.  Like mechanic, there is a lot of ground under that one.
It does not say anything about the computers any more that physian says
about the human body.

Charles, you\'re showing a bias towards a very old set of 
"industry standard terms". Even today, we\'re moving away from 
the term "DOS" to mean "operating system" precisely because 
the OS (the modern preferred term) does, as you say, include 
a lot of non-disk functionality. Hence "MacOS" rather than 
"MacDOS". 

I doubt there will be very many spinning mechanical devices 
involved in a TL 12+ computer, and the term "DOS" will be lost
in the mists of history. 

Charles, you may not recognize a TL 12 computer for what it
is. It may well work on principles that you and I don\'t understand.
I\'m not saying that they *will* be so very different; I\'m saying
that they *may* be. If you disagree with this point, then we don\'t
have anything else to say to each other.

No way. I was at a computer show, and I was checking out some TL 12
computers. They weren\'t all that special...

Oh... Wait a second... I was just informed that they *weren\'t* actually TL
12. They were merely Pentium IIs marked up. It was the "Makhidkarun Inside"

The ship will match the orbital velocity of objects at that
distance when it firsts gets out there.  The it only has
to work its way along the orbit.  (Though a ship at 1 G
can match velocity with something going 10 km/sec in 16
minutes).

I meant "normal" compared with the distribution of meteorites
in the solar system (though these guys are not as likely to
be "ground up" by collisions as objects in the inner solar system).
If you apply what is known about the likely distribution of sizes
and the amound of material that is thought to be out there,
objects in a decent size range shouldn\'t be that rare (remember
if an object only has a density of 0.1 g/cc, then a 10 meter
object will have a mass of 400 tons.).
After all, only a _very_ small number of Kuiper objects come
in as comets, but comets thought to be derived from the Kuiper
belt are not _that_ rare.

Actually it doesnt really matter.  You have to use more thrusters,
but the amount of material you deliver is proportionally more...

You either can just take the smaller
objects (which we both agree are more common) or you can take
bigger ones less often.  My guess is that you would start
off by pushing in smaller ones to start up cash flow.  Then
you might look to just push in a big on now and then so
you don\'t have to deal with so many objects.

Which is why you give it small steady thrust.  0.004 G will get
it in in less than a year.

Exactly.  It\'s OK for a regiment to be split between brigades , but what is
a problem is having troops move from regiment to regiment with each
transfer as they apparently do in the US Army.  

Let me give some context.  I\'m not a veteran, but I sit in a discussion
panel on military manpower issues. We just recently (last week) talked with
GEN Shy Meyer, who instituted the regimental system in the US Army.  He was
thoroughly unhappy with the fact that detailers don\'t even make an effort
to send troops back to the same regiment from tour to tour. Maybe that\'s
changed since he left the Army, but I\'d be surprised.

Assuming troops remain in the same regiment for their entire career,
spreading that regiment around isn\'t a major problem, although it seems to
run contrary to the established Traveler cannon.  The 4518th is clearly a
single regiment, but then again it\'s not really IA.   the 1188th Lift
Infantry Regiment is also well known, and clearly went into action as a
body.

Hah! A mere rugrat you are...I learned _programming_ using punchcards
and Fortran...(back when it was Threetran ;-) A buddy of mine wrote a
D&D dungeon generator, complete with extensive random encounter and
treasure tables on the ol\' Convex. That was about a six-foot stack of
punchcards by the time he was sort of done. He had it mostly debugged
before RL intervened. He was, like Roderick, a magnificent DM and
innovator cut down in his prime by a legal career...;->

I was talking about the Imperial Army in this example.  The Marines
regularly deploy as single platoons, and the highest level of orginazation
they have is the Regiment.  The Marine Regiments are tied to a numbered
fleet, and more loosely to that fleet\'s subsector.

This is for US Army infantry units, as those are what I\'m familiar with.

Fire Team.

4-5 men, led by a Corporal (E-4) or Sergeant (E-5) The base unit of combat,
the team exists to service a support weapon, either a M-60 LMG, or the
M-249 SAW.

Squad.

2 Fire teams, led by a Sergeant or Staff Sergeant (E-6) The smallest
maneuver unit.  The squad leader usually has one trooper assigned as his
radio operator.

Platoon.

3-4 Squads, led by a Lieutenant (O-1 or 0-2) assisted by a Sergeant First
Class (E-7).

Company.

3-4 Platoons, led by a Captain (O-3), with the assistance of a First
Sergeant (E-8) Companies are the \'family\' of infantry.  90% of the
training, discipline, and day to day life of a soldier is tied up in the
company environment.  Companies have their own supply rooms, and are
expected to take care of most problems without bothering higher headquarters.

Battalion.

4 Companies, plus a HQ company.  Lead by a Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) with a
Command Sergeant Major (E-9) This what FFW considers a factor 1 unit.
About 800 men, several dozen armored vehicles.  Battalions have large
combat support services like mess halls, medical facilities, and organic
mechanics. The battalion is the first number when someone says they are
part of the "3rd of the 75th"

Regiment.

Technically, 3-4 battalions.  This is not used as an organizational level
in the US Army with two exceptions:  The 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger)
and the 3rd US Infantry (The Old Guard) both have Regimental HQs.

Brigade.

A combined arms group of five or six battalions.  In an Infantry brigade,
you\'d find two infantry batts, and armor batt, and artillery batt, and
support batt, and possibly other assets like aviation or engineers.
Commanded by a Colonel (O-6)

Division.

A grouping of several brigades, plus additional artillery and aviation
assets.

Mechanical computers. Charles Babbage\'s one was recently built by the

It isn\'t really cool unless they can also convey the subtle humor of its
appearance in _Muppet\'s_Treasure_Island_...

This idea reminds me a little of the aliens that communicated by allusion
in ST:TNG\'s "Darmok" episode. Perhaps some "phrases" become standardized
(Done to Death) and are therefore recognizeable to an outside observer when
they recur. Imagine standing up on this list and declaring, "Virus," or
"Drop Tanks," or "the P-word." This could form the beginning of a
translation scheme -- if they didn\'t declare jihad in return!

Your snowball just grew an order of magnitude. OK, so you put
more thrusters on it: how long does it take to put one on? I\'d
like to know how you propose to power them continuously for the
better part of a year. You need some kind of guidance unit if you
are going to have any control over your snowball\'s direction once
you fire the thrusters. How many are you going to carry? What do
you use to place them: a guy in a vac suit, manipulator arm, or
what?  How long does it take to find them, how close are they
together, and how long does it take to go between them? You ARE
talking a mission of a couple of months at least, so you need
extended life support.  The devil is in the details.

There\'s a distinct difference between "applejack" and "applebrandy".
The brandy will consist of water, alocohol, and such components of the
hard cider as were volatile enough toboil off along with the alcohol. 

Applejack contains *all* the components of the hard cider except those
that have such a strong affinity for water thatthey\'d preferentially
segregate in the ice.

So the flavor is apt to be rather different.

Actually, I\'m even younger that I seem from this post.  You see, this
machine was in Russia.  Which means subtract 15-20 years from it\'s age.
The only thing I did on the machine was to get it to print out my name on
the line printer as a banner.

(The 1st video game I ever played was on a Russian clone of (I think) an
IBM7070.  The game was python.  This was around 1985)

The point was that you could increase the mass by a factor of 10
(dropping the acceleration by a factor of 10) and still arrive
in less than a year.  That way you get more ice for the
commiment of the thruster pack for a longer period.

Well, we can do it today with small probes.  When you jump

Either.  Both.

WE can spot bigger objects from the Earth now.  Spotting
smaller ones from the same orbit with sensors that are 7
TLs advanced wouldn\'t seem to be a problem.  At one
1 G you can cover 10% of the orbit in a matter of days.  Though
they will be a lot more common than that.

Correction: "[Regiment] is not used as an organizational level in the US
Army *Infantry*," &c. Also, the 3d Infantry Regiment is maintained at
battalion strength, whatever its designation.

The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment is just that, as are two
attack helicopter regiments at Fort Bragg (though there may be only one by
now).

A Special Forces Group is essentially a regiment, not a brigade, and there
are four or five of those.

And then there are about 15,000 guys (and gals) in spurs and Stetsons...

No she hasn\'t been. Like most first rates she was kept in reserve during
peacetime. And since Trafalger she has effectively been in reserve (laid
up in a graving dock). A better example of a ship in commission might
be USS Consitution (built 1797) which is still in sea-going commission.

ObTrav: Given the slow pace of technological change in the 3I and the
relalively "vessel friendly" nature of space; just how long does an Imperial
warship stay in service.

Keeping the troops with the Regiment is central to the Regimental system.
Also promotion is within the Regiment, which is one of its weaknesses (as
well as preventing an "up or out" policy).

The US used to use whats normally referred to as the "Corp of Infantry"
approach. In this system, recruits are trained a large central "school(s)"
and then posted out to a unit. In this scheme, when an individual leaves
a unit there is no guarantee that they will be returned to the same unit.
The benefit of this system is that it ensures a uniformity of training and
doctrine, and theoretically optimises utilisation of manpower. It would
appear that when the US first adopted the Regimental system when it
went over to a volunteer force after Vietnam that they unsuccessfully
attempted to form a hybrid of the two approaches. As an interesting
aside, last century the US did use a purely Regimental system, but
abandoned it when it had to massively increase the Army for the First
World War.

The 1188th was a Brigade (1188th ("Aces and Eights") Lift Infantry
Brigade, JTAS 14) not a Regiment. I remember Loren saying that
the Imperial Army was organised into Brigades while the Marines were
grouped in Regiments.

With Traveller level tech you can do *active* sensor searches. Steal an
idea from Arthur C. Clarke and use "nuke-pumped radar". I\'m not up on a
the details, but it\'s possible to build a nuke and rig things to
convert most of the power into a microwave pulse. 

Using *that*, you can detect even small bodies at multi AU ranges.

Actually, 5.17 days. But note that at 1/1000th of a g it only takes 163
days. The transit time is a function of the *square root* of the
acceleration. So increasing it doesn\'t help a lot, and *decreasing* it,
doesn\'t hurt as much as you might think. 

The Kuiper belt starts around 5 light hours, or 5.4e9 km. So, at 1g, it
takes about 12 days to get there (assuming you turn over halfway and
decelerate). And at 1/1000th g, it\'ll take around 1200 days to get
back, again assuming turnover and decel halfway.

So a 10 year trip will take even lower acceleration.

I doubt *anyone* is going to trust an automated setup to pilot

The settlers may *want* the desert climate. New Arabia certainly will. :-)

And *crashing* them into the planet has unfortunate side effects. Soft
landing them gets expensive.

Heck, it\'s possible that the problem is most ice miners think theyt can
do fine *without* moving the asteroid. Why go to the extra expense and
hassle for not that much more money?

There may be a seperate "belter" culture in the far belts. It may take
them a *long* time to do it, but it\'s been conjectured that such a
society would spread from one star to another in only a century or so
at *sub*-light speeds!

Give them a J-1 drive, and they can take a week to get to anywhere
within a parsec. So once started, I can see someone spotting a new ice
chunk that they can\'t (or don\'t feel like) handling alone, and sending
out a report via laserlink to the nearest habs. It\'ll spread until
*someone* is interested *and* capable of dealing with it. And they\'ll
get there in a jump or two.

Not necessarily. The "conventional" tether is orbiting *and* spining
around its center. So the end rotates to the low point and ships ride
it up to the high point. This lowers the orbit a bit. Ships going in
the other direction raise the orbit a bit.

In the case of a GG "mining" setup, you\'d have more mass going up than
down. So some of the hydrogen will get "winched" from the end of the
tether to the center, and used in an engine to boost the tether back up
every so often.

By "normal" I think he meant "the usual" not the "normal distribution"

Yes, but if you drop a drive and a fuel refining unit on it, it can
boost essentially *forever*. So it doesn\'t *need* to free fall. My
figures say at 1/1000th of a g, it\'ll take 600 days to the halfway
point, and another 600 of deceleration to bring it to "rest" in the
inner system. 

Remember, at a lower accel you\'ve got a *lot* more time for the delta-V
to accumulate.

According to Supp 5, Azhanti High Lighting survived for at least 113
years(First flight in 994, still in service in 1007.) However, she seems to
have spent about 30 years laid in reserve and three more in refit from
fleet intruder to frontier cruiser.  Some of the class served as fleet
auxiliaries and may have stayed in active service for more than 100 years.

The propert way to handle that is to let the players *wonder* about the
dragon behind the curtain. Have it turn out to be a "harmless baby".
*Then* when the players are clustered around it, have "mama" come home.

Do keep in mind that "analog computer" does *not* mean
"non-electronic". The current electronic part for building analog
controllers is the op-amp. 

For a lot of real-world control of equipment type applications, analog
is far superior to digital. You get faster feedback, and "programming"
errors tend to be either immediately obvious major ones, or else
trivial hidden ones. 

An analog computer would give Virus a nervous breakdown. :-)

	Unless I\'m mistaken, the world\'s oldest continuously-commissioned

I see the 1KCr/ton rate to be the absolute rock bottom limit that *nobody* will go below.  But with competition being what it is, I see it as the most common price as well.  When you\'ve got X ships competing for X-1 lots of freight, you have to underbid to get the contract.

And given your description, their niche would most likely be in a

Same here, and those were *not* the good old days.  ;-> 

I\'ve lived through punched cards, paper tapes, mag tapes, cassette
tapes, "card to disk", and various collections of mag disks both
fixed and flexible.  Remember the big old disk packs and the freezer
sized drives you put them in?  I remember when the university\'s main
system got a *big* memory upgrade...it went from 4 to 8 *kilobytes*
of core memory! 

PC\'s were invented just about the time I left my first career and
went back to college.  The first one I used was a $20,000 Terak with
an 8" floppy.  I got access to it only because I BS\'ed some guy in
the computer center about needing access for a class...I didn\'t I
taught myself Pascal wrote computer games. ;->

My first PC was a TRS Model I that I got "for school" and used to
type in Marc\'s Basic programs out of the Journals.  It\'s long gone,
but I still have a Timex-Sinclair, a tricked out CoCo (I ran
multi-tasking unix like OS-9 on it) and a Model 4p in the closet,
along with a $500 dollar external disk drive for the CoCo and a
Gorilla Banana serial printer.  ;-> The Model 16 and dumb terminal (I
used MS-Xenix) eventually ended up in a land fill.  <sigh> I\'m
getting misty remembering all the good times. </sigh>

When I teach computer concepts, each term, I pull out my box of
"junk" and show the students things we used to compute with.  Most
have never seen vacuum tubes, punched cards, transistors,
reel-to-reel tapes, big 18" metal disks and disk packs, or my prized
"hunk o\'core."  Heck, most have never seen a slide rule.  ;->

Ok, I\'m an old coot, but I still say the good old days of computing
are ahead of us...

I cut my teeth on a Sigma-7, obsolete even in \'73, at college, after I got out 
of the Army.  Back then, if you had $650, you could get a 300 baud acoustic 
coupled modem, and with a bit of work, you could tie it to a Model 14KSR 
teletype for a terminal and log into a timeshare machine someplace by fone.

I played with a Mod 1 a bit, but bought a CoCo, then another one, and then a 
CoCo3.  I ended up running a 512K CoCo3 & OS-9 Level 2.  Talk about power!!!

I remember being hooked up to CI$ at 2400 baud, downloading something for my 
CoCo (the CoCo2, a 64K machine), bursting the .ar file *WHILE* it was 
downloading, piping the docs to the Epson MX-80 printer, with a game program 
(\'Rogue\') and a word processor program running as well, while reading an 
article in BYTE where Bill Gates was proclaiming that multitasking on a system 
with less than 4 megs of RAM was impossible.  And I was doing all that on 
*64K*!!!

I remember how happy we all were when somebody came up with a way to mate an 
MFM harddrive to our CoCos so we didn\'t have to give Rat Shack 1500 greenies 
for a *5 meg hd*.  I ended up with a 100 meg HD, wondering how many years it 
would take me to fill it up!!  <grin>

40Cr/ton.  Hmmmmmmmmm.  Book rate for unrefined fuel is 100Cr/ton.  Methinks 
I\'d get it refined if possible to increase its profit margin...

That\'s 1200 days.  A bit over 3 years, 3 months.

And you\'ll *NEED* it.  BTW, what did your figures say the terminal velocity was at 600 days?

Take yer iceteroid and \'weaken\' it by drilling holes all through it.  Make the 
holes such that the pieces will be about a meter or less when the iceteroid 
breaks up.  Put the iceteroid in an eccentric orbit just *grazing* the edge of 
the atmosphere.  They\'ll break up and melt, putting the water into the air as 
water vapor.  Repeat as necessary.

Express shipping costs recap (II)

F-5 1kt JumpExpressCo Fast Liner XR-A431152-050000-85000-0  MCr 452.4  1kt TL F
        Cargo=196. Passengers=17. LHyd=550. EP=50. Agility=1. Low=0. Crew=10.

F6 1kt JumpExpress Express Liner XR-A431162-000000-80000-0  MCr 513.2  1kt TL F
        Cargo=72.  Passengers=17. LHyd=660. EP=60. Agility=1. Low=0. Crew=8.

"GOLD-PLATED" DROP TANKS - tanks cost KCr 60 per Dt (config 4; partially stream-
lined), cost 10% in maintenance and support operations expenses annually, and
have a lifespan of only 10 years (mortgage is simplified to 20% of value per
year):

 Unit  Mortgage/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge
  F-5   MCr 30.12      MCr 32.20      nil      ~ Cr   935
  F-6   MCr 34.66      MCr 31.36      >11%     > Cr 1,105
 i) cost of drop-tanks is an insignificant change; + KCr 8 to vessel cost.
 ii) maintenance of tankage increase one-hundred-fold.
 iii) mortgage of tankage increase four-fold.

  Which compares extremely favourably to either of the following:
Internal tankage only:
 Unit  Mortgage/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge
  F-5   MCr 22.62      MCr 12.46      >82%     > Cr 1,820
  F-6   MCr 25.66      MCr  8.12     >216%     > Cr 3,160

DROP TANKS - includes cost of _disposable_ tanks in operating cost (& mortgage):
 Unit  Ops. Cost/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge
  F-5   MCr 40.12      MCr 32.20      >25%     > Cr 1,250
  F-6   MCr 46.66      MCr 31.36      >49%     > Cr 1,490

  Clearly, non-disposable L-Hyd tanks built to ship hull standards are
economically little different from re-usable tanks at first glance. In
fact they\'re much superior, as the lack of a refurbishing issue allows
them to be cycled through a larger set of ships in each duty cycle -
an individual ship not only doesn\'t expend a set of tanks, but it neither
needs to own _nor pay for_ a set of tanks on its own.

 Allowing such an option would merely exaggerate the damage of "normal" drop
tanks.

  FWIW, I suspect that the 20% mortgage on such tanks is serious overkill,
but someone else can prove why...

Ahhhhhh the memories...

I recall discovering Traveller (was it late 70\'s or early 80\'s... I seem to
have forgotten...) and playing campaign sessions over long weekends (we have
about a dozen or so every year in Oz -- give or take) from Friday night
after work, through to sometime Sunday (late morning to evening,
depending...).  All I can say is, "I\'m lucky I\'m still married after all
that!  It must have come close..."

For a good source of links try:

I also have a link to
http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/adc_holdings1.html
Which IIRC has a good collection of all kinds of star catalogs

The first site will get you well oriented, if you need some additional links 
and some results of experience, drop me a note off list.

I heard different, speficially that the tolerances and material properties
requied to make it work meant that it couldn\'t have been completed last
century at realistic cost (ie it was a TL6 computer!)

But what if there\'s no disk?

What if it is solid state, with holographic storage crystals?

At home, I use a machine with its operating system in ROM.
Part of that operating system is a Disc Filing System to
allow disks to be accessed.

See - no DOS, only a DFS.

So calling it a DOS sounds like 1980\'s PCs and thus hardly hitech.

To the best of my knowledge, my brain *might* be described as EEPROM
but thes no disc in there. :-)

There are still disks in the TL12 computer on my desk., and underneath Win98

You\'re still working from an invalid premise. You have to realize that a
Traveller TL12 computer is not advanced, and is about same level of
advancement as the computer I\'m writing this on.

Traveller is _not_ a high tech universe when it comes to computer tech,
social science, nanotech or biotech .(and possibly several other things as
well )

Two reasons spring to mind:

a. For the same reason that there\'s one skill covering medical
diagnosis, pharmacology, surgery, anaesthetics, etc. To keep the level
of abstraction at a manageable level.

b. The Imperium uses Mac-descended computers! You need a special tool to
open one, and the only way of fixing it is to replace the
motherboard/holomatrix/insert pseudo-random techspeak here.

No, not yet.  I\'m half-way through "The Shattered Sphere", and really 
am enjoying it and the first book of the series, "The Ring Of

a lot of color and ideas that can be skimmed from these two books.

Hail Damage Delays Shuttle Mission

 
Published: 1999 May 13 
 
11:07 pm ET (0307 UT)
The first shuttle mission in nearly half a year will be delayed
by another week to ten days to repair damage to the shuttle\'s
external tank from a recent hailstorm, NASA announced late
Thursday, May 13.

Insulation on the external tank mated to shuttle Discovery,
scheduled for a May 20 launch on mission STS-96, suffered
damage during a hailstorm last week. An estimated 150 divots
were found in the insulation during an inspection after the
storm.

<snip>

The divots themselves pose no risk to the shuttle, since their
relatively small size -- an average diameter of 1.25 cm (0.5 in.)
and a depth of no more than 0.9 cm (0.34 in.) deep -- does not
penetrate all the way through the insulation to the metal of
the tank itself. 

However, shuttle managers are concerned that ice could form in
the divots once the tanks are filled with liquid oxygen and
hydrogen. Chunks of ice could then shake loose from the divots
during launch, striking and damaging the shuttle orbiter.

<snip>

The last time a shuttle was rolled back for repairs was in
June 1995, when Discovery was rolled back to repair holes in
the external tank\'s insulation caused by woodpeckers.

(woodpeckers...ROFLMAO. Nature has a unique way of keeping
us humble.)

ObTrav: Although hi-TL ships usually don\'t have to worry about
damage like this, there *are* critters on various planets which
can do incredible damage once onboard. One of the old JTAS\'s
has a creature feature (I\'m a poet and didn\'t know it :) on
an eel/worm which digests various light metals, including
shipboard circuitry.

Such a critter is *great* for driving PCs crazy with intermittent
hardware failures or keeping their ship grounded for a time
through lifeform infection quarantine, fines/jail time for
transporting dangerous lifeforms between planets, repair
time/costs, etc.

And, of course, the horror of finding the husks of hatched
eggs/molted skin onboard some weeks after the ship and crew are
allowed to go their way is just fun, fun, fun.

\'sigh\' I *so* glad I\'m starting a campaign in 2 weeks.

It is DOS.  DOS is a generic term referring to ANY disk operating system and it is often used to refer to the entire IO interface functality even though
operating system is the better term.  It is an industry standard term.  Like
serial, ROM, and RAM.  Note also that unix the operating system for many
main frames is also a form of a DOS.

Say "DOS" to any computer industry professional and they\'ll think

a UNIX programmer that UNIX is a form of a DOS and he\'ll look at you

OS is the better term, and the industry standard term.

There has to be a better way to handle the dramatic playing of Computer
skill than strongly limiting Traveller computer science to 20th century 
details. What do you do to create a dramatic scene in the Engine Room?

I like your idea of fighting a Virus by deliberately crippling your computer
system. If you can artificially lower the effective TL of your computer far
enough, Virus would become dormant. It might take you a week to 
calculate the jump parameters for the trip home instead of an hour,
but it might still be possible. You still have a 20th century tech problem,
though - you\'re assuming that the computer technician can do a CRC
on every bit of code run by the computer and only allow approved code
to run. This makes all sorts of assumptions about the nature of computer
commands (especially on the system level), and assumes the system 
doesn\'t perform modifications on the code for future operations. We see
the latter problem today, with some kinds of false positives from antivirus 
software.

But CyberJocks in Traveller? HERETIC!!!  ;-)

<regarding Charles\' arguments on purpose-built vs self-modifying:>
My college bought a couple thousand computers. All of them are very
general-purpose machines, they can run all kinds of software and
support many kinds of hardware. Strangely enough, we have almost
no machines that are purpose-built as word processors, only a few
that were purpose-built as mainframe terminals, and one guy who
bought a purpose-built machine for keeping address books.
Why don\'t we have all purpose-built machines? They would have been
cheaper and more effective, right?

If my matrix-core computer plus the configuration tool costs twice as
much to build as a purpose-built computer (to get the *same* performance),
I\'ll just have to mass-produce enough of them to let economies of scale
knock 60% off my per-unit cost. The purpose-built machine may hang
on to a tiny slice of market share, but my fit-anywhere, do-anything
machines will eventually be fitting everywhere and doing everything.
Remember, my machines can work like a custom-built machine in 
any environment you put them in - if it has a 3dTn computer bay, I can
sell a Model/3 computer to them. One big company squishes 1000
little companies, especially in the 3I.

Well, maybe this will help in one area.

We are today building molecular machines. Gears and motors the size of
single cells.  Perhaps that race would develop a clock work \'chip\' with
meshing gears to replace the input and output pins on electronic chips.  At
this scale the diference engine could be built into a wrist watch.

Also if this culture does not see black and white then no question will be
answered yes or no, only \'that appears to be the way it is in this time and
place under these conditions as observered by those present\'.  They would be
past masters of the Hysenberg uncurtainty prenciple!  Working out a trade
deal could take a while through translaters as all the conditions would have
to be worked out including a \'if everything goes real Murphy on us\'
condition.  Their contracts would be interesting.  Their lawyers scary!
Degrees of guilt would be a major part of their legal system.

These people could be dour worry worts or happy \'take life as it is and
don\'t worry to much\' types.  Or both at the same time and everything in between!

Can you imagine there religion!?  A funeral on this planet could sound like
the intro to \'Lords of Light\'.

You\'ve got a fasinating idea here.

Good start BUT (You expected that didn\'t you) once you define the media you
define the limits.  Psionic are magic because no one has defined the method
of operation.  When you say the the power is electromaneticly transmited you
are no longer talking psionic.  The \'power\' is limited by the media sence
the media much conform to the physics that are known about it.

In short it is an either/or situation.  It is either and electromagetic or
psionic effect.  Not both.  If it is \'magic\' it uses \'magic\' as it\'s media
not power lines.  Also the psionic justification falls apart when you look
at the seed concept.  That is a computer paradium.

How if the virus has to be running in the host computer as a program to use
its\' psionic power to \'burn it\'s self in\' it might fit.  It does not spead
by psioncs it just uses psionic once there to consolidate its\' hold on the
system.  This does open a nasty door though.  It means there must be a
algorithim for psionic powers!

Have a second ship ready for the pyscologists.  It would take weeks or month
to analise the 3 second responce to, "tell me about your mother\'!  There
would be mass suicides among the Fruedian!  The battle between nature and
nurture might reach the level of nuclear war!

It\'s posible  that only telepaths capable of full communion contact could
understand them.

And even if they are TL7-10 or so their technology would have a massive
impact on the 3I.  Their radically different approaches would spark a
research \'gold rush\' like that caused by the transiter and plastics.  The
scouts would have to limit comtact to prevent \'boom town\' problems.  Demand
for their outlook could lead to some interesting senerios.  Toss in a few
\'ethically chaledged\' scietists with money and a PC group willing to \'run
the blocade\' and you got something interesting.  Say those scientist wanted
a child of this race to raise to test some theories of thought patterns,
developement, and to have long term access to the insights of this species.
Suppose \'junier\' bonds to a PC.  and how exactly do you contain an ameboid
anyway?

Maybe program modules will just be hard coded ROM in a convient package.
That is a posibility but either way there will be an operating system to

Well yes, and no.  I have my doughts the the interface (visual monitor and
an input device) will change much unless, neural interfaces become an
everyday tool.  If we stay with monitors and input devices then I dought it
woulds take a modern computer guru long to get up to speed on future
systems.  The user interface has tended to become more helpfull and more
intuitive over time.  If that trend continues then far enough in the future
a computer user may only need to voice his request to have the computer do
his bidding.  I do not see how this would be dificult to understand.  You
would ask the system for appropriate analogies discribing it\'s structure and
proceed for there.  Regardless of advancement the computer function is the same.

Also my suggestion is that it is posible that we have reached TL12 in
computer science may mean that further advancement will slow.  It is posible
that there will be very little change in computers between now and the time
of traveller but more than likely the writters of traveller all those years
ago just did not expect computers to develope as fast as they did and
underestimated computer progess my 5 or more orders of magitude.

This is one of the boondogles I dought will ever be solved.  In MTU the
computers are voice controled very advanced versions of todays main frames.
I rationalize their excessive size by counting it as control mechanizms for
running the ship and backup sub systems for peek load.  Physical size of
actuaters is not likely to decrease by much due to limits in materals and
size constrates to stroke arm lengths plus the clearence needed to
accomodate arm swing so the BIG part of the computers is the mechanics to
control such things as doors, airlock, turrets, power plants, ext.  This
level of automation is what lets on person pilot a scout ship.  To get any
better results you have to have self mobile unit (robots) and they cost extra.  


In MTU there is a curtain bias against robots doing jobs people could safely
do.  People that replace people with robots are thought to be cheap or
miserly.  Having human or other live sophots as employees/sevant is
considered a mark of wealth and status.  After all, nobles have lots of live
servants and THEY are the top dogs.  This is mainly due to many people and
few high paying jobs.  The lower classes are large and the middle class
fairly small.  Star ship crew are middle class.  Brokers range from upper
lower class to upper class.  Cargo handling robots (the only job untrained
labor can do) are hated by the unemployed of the lower classes.  But that is
MTU only.  It\'s a bit dirtier than most.  Star ship crews can make alot of
friends, hear plenty of rummers, and loose some cargo to pilferage if they
hire local poor to load cargo at class C, D & E star ports.  A & B always
use professionals, robots, or both.  A drink with the help in a local bar
(crew buying) doesn\'t hurt either.  A ship that visits regularly and hires
the same people regularly are likely to have allies when they need them and
maybe the occational speculative cargo from George\'s country cozen with a
mellon surplus.  Of course that mean the PC can\'t really cheat the locals if
they want to keep their friends BUT the local corporation are fair game.
They fired George after 10 year loyal service and replace him with a
gawl-darned robot!  This condition is pretty common on high pop worlds or
mid tech world on a trade route (a second industrial revolution caused by
import of robots).

The electrical was motors only IIRC.  They just drove the clock work.  The
same was true with the Nordon.  The TDC was hand cranked and used electrical
motor and electircal switches were use to pass the results to the torpedos
but the calculations were done by clock work.  Again IIRC.

Of course.  C is a user.  All he needs to know is what he wants.  The
computer will tell him how much the plugins to do that task will cost and
even place the order and do the ungrade for him.  The programer is the guy
that write the code (ususally he is expected to do so instantly and without
bugs) after the sale man gets the order for the product he promised the
customer that is still on the drawing board.

Both of those depends on a great many things, particularly complexity.  Also
\'reprograming\' can be a problem, bring your sordering iron.  Servo systems
can get very complex and debuging cycle time can be long if specs and
tolerences are tight.  Think about the control system for something like the
Phalanx CIDS.

Op-amps and digital systems can compliment each other very well also.  Mixed
signal systems can solve some problems better/faster/cheaper that either
alone.  It can be a tough call in borderline cases.

True, at it\'s current size (large table) it was at the edge of 19 century
technology\'s limits but the best timepieces of that time were within
tolerence. It\'s been a bone of contention for a while now.  Even the people
who built the thing are not sure what COULD have been done.  The history of
mechanical technology is not to exact.  People gaurded there industrial
secrets closely back then.  I read a few articals on it and when it was
\'doable\'.  There was no real consensese among those who know a lot more
about it that I ever will.  I think it\'s one of those \'what ifs\' we will
never know the \'real\' answer for.

If it were up scaled so the tolerences were losser then it should have been
no problem but that is just specualtion on my part.  Even if the materials
were there, the inventer was not. It would make a good \'lost world\' for
traveller though.

As for cost, look at the UNIVAX.  It was a real pocket breaker but it was
the only game in town.

Symantics, they are the same thing like using the genus and philum instead
of it\'s common name for an animal.  Your DFS is a subsystem inside the DOS
which is a subsystem in the OS.  Do we really need to nit pick at this level?

Electrically Erasable Programable Read Only Memeory?  I dought it, unless

This is all symantics.  If you prefer, use the more generic term of OS
(operating system) which does not contain a reference to the nature of the
hardware.

As for the human mind, I think the proper term for it is a \'huristic\'
(spelling) system.  I\'m not positive of that though.

It\'s possible that, for a high TL culture, computer programming
complexity (at least at the OS level) exceeded the limits of human

that directly involved a human brain at the each-line-of-code level.
(Cut to faded, yellowed graphic of a smiling Bill Gates. ;-)  )

The bugs in, say, Windows NT may indicate that we\'re already
approaching such a limit, and we may stay at such a complexity
limit until expert systems are developed which program OS\'s.

I\'ve seen some SF universes - some Heinlein, for example - where
computer "programmers" were more like modern-day psychologists.
The computer system was so complex that these "Cyberpsychs"
would do more teaching and reasoning with than programming. 
This is too far for Traveller, but I thought it was an interesting idea.

Pretty much the same tech and cultural conditions applies to the Squids

Aha, we have found the Mac Evangelista! The new Mac design is quite neat
- - in fact, it\'s kind of like the Dell PClones that we were forced to buy
a couple of years back.

I try not to use PCs for serious work when I get the choice, though -
the OSs are too flaky for mission-critical stuff.

I *have* fixed a (custom) system by resoldering a surface mount chip,
but I\'m not bothering with that again.

I think that my gas soldering iron (with blowtorch mod) and anti-static
shield are more than a match for your puny weapons :>

That is all to true.  Traveller was written in the 70s.  We have already
caught up to it technology wise.  1984 was written in the 50s, I think.  We
pasted it in the 70s and unfortunately the scary stuff has come true too in
a slightly different form than in the book.  There is a book written in 1984
comparing and contrasting the book 1984 with the real world 1984.  The
paralells and similarities are scary.

Well, my PowerBook requires a cross headed screwdriver to open it, and the
6400 can be done using thumbscrews (that didn\'t come out quite how I
meant!) ie screws you can turn with your thumb. The K2 and G3 boxes are
even easier...

Methinks Matt is confused - the Apples I\'ve seen are easier to open than
the Dells, Digitals and Compaqs at work.

And I won\'t go into how much easier to use ;-)

My point was that a completely analog device wouldn\'t have digital
markings at all. We add them to help us make better use of the output.

The Analog Aliens I\'ve been thinking of don\'t conceptualize in discrete
numbers. If they had a slide rule, it might be marked with a color spectrum
instead of a series of digits.

It\'s definitely *digital*, not analog. Binary is simpler to build, but

I am an industry professional, IEEE engineer to be exact.  I design
computers and control system from scratch for a living and have been doing
so for 10 years.  I speak with other industry professionals regularly and
read a dozen trade magazines a month.  DOS is used as a generic term as well
as a specific one amoung those engineers in their 30s or so.  OS is the more
current term.

Perhaps, but it can still be run out of the box, perhaps less efficently and

What, where did this come from?  I said the opposite.  General purpose
systems would be cheaper because of mass production.  Something out of
context here.  Oh I see.  Yes, a purpose built (not general purpose) system
would be more electronicly efficent than a system that self reconfigured
itself mostly do to forsight and lack of overhead waste.  The purpose built
system would cost more but that\'s the price you pay for top end efficency.
If cost is the deturmening facter then a general pupose non reconfiguring
system may be the cheapest due to lack of wasted overhead.  It just depends
of how close to the bleeding edge you need to be.  If responce times are
real critical an analog system might be best.

>If my matrix-core computer plus the configuration tool costs twice as

Somewhere in here the terms got scrambled up.

General purpose = Built to do many things not one particular thing : main
frames or PCs

Dedicated = one function: purpose built for it\'s job though it may contain
off the shelf parts:  Missle guidence systems, temperture controlers, combat
robots.

Custom built = One of a kind or very limited run (may be dedicated but does
not have to be): the computer for my car, Some video editing systems and
animation systems.  This is were your reconfigurable core would find it\'s
nitch.  As these system already has starup cost problems a reconfigurable
core could cut costs and reduce cycle time.  It could also spread mass
production quantities over a vast number of different custom jobs.  Today
this nitch is fill with PLCs which are this TLs easily reconfigured system.
I\'m hoping for some great leaps in this area of technology.  It would make
my job a lot easier.  Right now overhead limits the size of the system you
can build with these cheaply.  Functionallity is also somewhat limited.

Purpose built = Built to fit a particular purpose including general purpose:
This applied to nearly anything that is designed with an end use in mind.

Except your reconfigureable will have to be twice as big (or more) to equal
the perfomance of an optomized general purpose system due the the mass and
cost of the reconfurisation system.  Mass producing this system will make
thing worse as the subsystems used in both decrease in price due to mass
production so will the general purpose system price decrease and your system
will still be bigger and more expensive.  You have to have everything that\'s
in the general purpose system in your reconfigurable system PLUS enough
extra to cover overhead and the reconfiguring system.  Your system would be
GREAT for system prototyping but not for mass production.

Remove custom built and replace with dedecated and you are correct cost
wise.  Replace with General purpose and you are very wrong.  Also as far as
bleeding edge technology goes dedicated systems built for a particular
function will always out perform either general purpose or reconfigurable.

Oh, it is.  Read \'Instramentallity of Mankind\' to see why I do not want to
even begin to think about this happening.  When we reach the point the we do
not and can not understand our own technology it is only a matter of time
before we are in real trouble.  Posibly to the extent of mankind doing the
way of the Dodo.  
If we were to reach that point in my life time I\'d home school my children
in how to farm with horse and buggy technology.  You can bet they would soon
need it.  Ever lissen to the band Rush?  Try the 2112 album or the song "Red
Barcheta" for another look at this form of unintintial technocracy and some
good Traveller plots as well.

Easy rule:

Gears = digital
 cams = analog

Babbages stuff was digital. Lots of gears. 

Mechanical analog computers tend to use various sorts of cams, and
other smooth, but "meshing" surfaces.

It\'s been done before. You should have been around during one of the

Two problems. First, that high in the atmosphere, much of the water
will be dissociated into H and O atoms by solar UV. And due to the
temperatures involved, much of the H will be above escape velocity. 

Second, you are adding the enery of the asteroid into the planetary
atmosphere. That energy is enough to cause *real* problems if you
import any significant amounts of water (as in enough to change the
hydro percentage). Work out the tonnages involved. Then work out how
much energy you\'d be dissipating in the atmosphere.

Your PC can do the math for a multi-parsec hyperspace jump? Tell 
the difference between a starship hijack attempt and a couple of 
foolish passenger strolling uninvited to the bridge? Predict the 
location of an evading 6-G target half a light-second away based 
on its previous pattern of evasion? Simultaneously? With nary a 
blue-screen-of-death?

Besides, my comment about spinning mechanical devices was tautological
for Classic Traveller, where holo crystal storage is canonical at
TL12, IIRC.

Well, we have another divergence here. I\'m familiar with the 
suggestion that the Traveller computers don\'t do enough for their 
tonnage, and it\'s probably impossible to reconcile the fact that 
computer cost and size doesn\'t vary with TL, but your assumption
that a Pentium II is TL 12 seems bogus.

Consider for a moment:

- - A single purchase of a ship\'s computer puts a terminal with 
entertainment facilities in every stateroom.

- - Entertainment software is below the threshold of counting against
the CPU capacity, regardless of the number of staterooms on the ship.

- - Cutting edge TL8 entertainment software pushes your desktop machine
to its limits. 

I might be willing to grant that your desktop box has most of the
capabilities of a single stateroom workstation -- and as such is 
well below the threshold of a single CPU point.

I once used 2112 as background for an Aftermath! campaign.  It was
liberally sprinkled with Ark-II and Traveller for the sci-fi aspect.  Fun game.

IMTU computer repair requires electronics skill and one level of
computer, sensors repair requires electroics skill and one level of
sensors.  This is to understand the specific operation of the equipment
in question, but the roll is based on the electronics skill.

Not necessarily. You are not thinking magically enough, Charles. ;-) I did
not try to describe *how* Virus does what it does, but simply what it can
and cannot do.

You are right, of course. This is only a start. :-)

It *is* both -- that\'s the key. Nondualism is a keystone to a lot of
mystical thinking: "Not one, not two, but both one *and* two."

Are mind and body and spirit seperate things? Are they the same? How does
spirt relate to mind? And so on. Remember, when we talk about psionics, we
are talking metaphysics -- at least the kind of psionics that are written
about in Traveller, anyway.

Virus "is a living, thinking [psionic] being that moves through the medium
of electronic information and computing systems the way a fish moves
through water. It is a free-floating consciousness that can move into and
animate [possess] any computing system with enough processing capacity to
house it. This computing system and whatever it controls becomes the host
of Virus, and Virus becomes the equipment it inhabits." (text from TNE, pg.
76; words in brackets mine).

It is also a magical idea: An evil spirit inhabiting an object until it is
picked up, at which point the spirit possesses the unfortunate victim.

Not necessarily. You see, the thing is that psionics are a huge, honking
handwave that lets one live with Virus despite all of the very valid
logical arguments against it. That\'s Hans\' point, which I am reiterating.

In truth, I wouldn\'t use psionics if I were going to run a "hard sf"
Traveller game, simply because there is no compelling reason to believe
they exist, or would ever exist, in a universe following "real world"
physical laws. Of course, I wouldn\'t run Virus in a "hard sf" game either,
for pretty much the same reason.

Herein is an idea inspired by the "Mindsuckers" referred to in the

======================

The Ziranii: A Vilani Psionic Secret Society

The Ziranii, or "Caste of the Soul", is a secret society made up of 
members of various psionic and quasi-psionic races (including a few 
minor human races) that have officially been eradicated or converted 
by the Vilani during the Consolidation Wars of the Ziru Sirka.  
Psionics have always been persecuted by the Vilani culture, even 
before their expansion into space, as psionics have traditionally 
been associated with the "warrior gods" (Ancient warbots) that fought 
one another on Vland until 20,000 years ago.

While some Ziranii members speculate that a secret society similar
to the "Caste of the Soul" may have existed to unite and protect
those few Vilani psionicists that may have existed in Vilani\'s
pre-stellar history, no evidence has ever been brought forward to
support this theory.  In actuality, the Ziranii started as an 
underground movement during the Consolidation Wars of the First 
Imperium, when several psionic races (including a minor human race) 
sought to avoid death and persecution during the "Vilanification" of 
their cultures.  Massive near-genocidal attacks by the Vilani 
greatly reduced the numbers of these races, and the survivors made 
extreme efforts to integrate into Vilani society.  Originating within 
the coreward reaches of Diaspora sector, all but forgotten by 
history, the Ziranii movement slowly maneuvered to positions of power 
in the rimward sectors controlled by Sharurshid.

By the point of the Ziru Sirka\'s first contact with Terrans at 
Barnard\'s Star (2096AD), the Ziranii secret society had spread its 
membership of a few thousand over three sectors, occupying 
positions of importance in preparation for a daring move.  The 
Ziranii had begun a plan to move beyond the rimward borders of the 
First Imperium, and establish a safe haven many parsecs beyond the 
reach of the Vilani oppressors.  A staging area had been selected on 
the rimward border, and operations had begun under the guise of the 
research and development outpost of Ikugi (Solomani Rim 1926, known 
to the 3I as Barnard\'s Star.)  The plan took a major shift when, less 
than a decade into preparations, the Vilani were encountered by 
another major race, humans from the nearby Terra system (Solomani Rim 
1827.)

The meeting was held in secret in the year 2094AD (Terran
reckoning), with first contact made by a telepathic member of UNSC
Advanced Intelligence division, a Terran governmental agency secretly
conducting psionic research for "intelligence purposes." The United
Nations Security Council, having detected radio emissions from the
new colony, utilized the recently developed Waven Hyperspace Shunt
drive (jump drive) to engage in a clandestine mission of First
Contact.  The AdvInt agent, detecting the presence of a talented
Ziranii telepath, engaged in negotiations with the local Ziranii
Council leaders, and both sides left the table with the beginnings of
a new plan.  After conferring at the Provincial Council at Dingir,
the Ziranii determined to utilize the Terrans to cover their own
actions, developing an unsteady allegiance with the United Nations
Security Council Advanced Intelligence division.  Carefully
orchestrating the initial interactions between Terrans and the Ziru
Sirka, starting with an official First Contact in 2096AD, the
Ziranii played the two cultures against one another as they
continued to prepare for their colonization rimward of both the
Terrans and the Vilani.  The increased trade and diplomatic missions
proved a successful smoke screen for the movement of Ziranii
provisions and people to Ikugi. In exchange for technical
information, the Ziranii\'s AdvInt allies kept Terran intervention to
a minimum, although a few individual pockets of resistance grew
against the machinations of the Ziranii and AdvInt.

The Barnard Incident of 2110 (also referred to as the Canberra
Massacre) escalated a state of war between the Terrans and the Ziru
Sirka, throwing the Ziranii\'s carefully laid plans into disarray. An
all-out surprise assault by their AdvInt "allies" on the gathered
Ziranii members at Ikugi in 2117 reduced the numbers of the secret
society by almost two orders of magnitude, and the few remaining
members scattered to the stars.

Over the decades and centuries that followed, the Ziranii slowly grew 
in strength, and worked against the Terran invaders.  Members of 
AdvInt waged a secret war against their once-allies, the Ziranii, 
and both organizations strove to wipe the other out.  The success of 
the Terrans in forming the Rule of Man drove the Ziranii deep into 
hiding.  Most Ziranii Councils were eventually discovered and 
destroyed during this troublesome period, but a small membership did 
survive.  Using centuries old techniques of hiding amongst an 
anti-psionic society, the Ziranii blended into the background, 
and bided their time, content to control from behind the scenes.

Various Councils survived the Long Night, and reestablished contact
through their concentration on centers of political power.  Although
some dispute has arisen between a few of the Councils as to the
direction and leadership of the Ziranii, the general concensus
granted a majority of intergroup authority to the Capitol Council, as
the seat of greatest political power resided there for the Third
Imperium, and for the future goals of the Ziranii.

During the early years of the 3I, the Ziranii subtly supported and
promoted the presence of official Psionic Institutes, trying to
build a pro-psionic stance within Imperial society.  The actions of
other secret organizations, anti-psionic in nature, has hendered the
Ziranii progress significantly.  Great strides in changing public
opinion were made during the 700\'s, until public opinion went
radically anti-psionic with the Psionic Suppressions. Over the last
few centuries, the Ziranii have retreated into hiding once again, 
again driven nearly to destruction.

Time has healed the old wounds, the membership has grown once 
again, and the newer members are looking for new directions, new 
goals, new frontiers.  Perhaps the Ziranii Dream might be better 
pursued on the Imperial frontier.  Perhaps the Domain of Deneb, with 
its proximity to the Zhodani Consulate, might prove to be an area 
worthy of development.  Perhaps the Solomani Rim, once home to the 
traitorous AdvInt, might prove of benefit in the goals of the 
Ziranii.  Perhaps...but that is a story yet to be told.

===================

(Additional note:  The Psionic Suppressions could also have been
directed against the Ziranii, who might have secretly been working
with the Zhodani to bring about a pro-psionic shift in Imperial
society.  However, since the Ziranii tend to keep to the
conspiratorial shadows, nothing has ever been mentioned of them in
history texts, and they are all but unknown to the general public.)

Don\'t know about the Nordon, but AFAIK the Enigma used electrical relays
and switches to do the actual computing.  It wasn\'t all clockwork.

Quite possibly a Beowulf cluster will be able to do it today using either
P-II/III or PowerPC 7400 CPUs and running a version of UNIX or Linux.  If
not, get a dedicated Supercomputer from IBM, Cray, or Mitsubishi.  Not
knowing the computations necessary to make a jump, but going with the
supposition that the computations are nothing more than highly evolved
orbital problems and positional calculations, I think the computers today
will be able to handle it.  They might be slower than a TL-15 system, but
they can do it.  Remember that a 486DX/2 system from 1994 had more
processing power than the all the computers Mission Control used to put a
man in orbit, as well as put a man on the moon.  Factoring in Moore\'s Law,
processing power doubles every 18 months, if they can not perform as you
say today, then will soon.  Within 9 years, the average computer will be
roughly 64 times as capable as the ones in use today.

YMMV

Why make them mobile? If they have telekinesis, they don\'t need mobility to
survive. They can bring food to themselves, and remove waste the same way.
Evolution wouldn\'t have required them to have mobility, unless I\'m missing
something.

Read Melissa Scot\'s latest novel _Night Sky Mine_ for a universe where
programs are "bred" instead of created.  As far as no longer understanding
our tech being a sign of the end of civilization, I sincerely doubt it. 

Folks will understand you need to do X to get Y result, X may be copying
two programs into the same file and letting them "fight" or "mate", and no
one may have seen a line of understandable code for a century or more, but
there\'s cause and effect, and so usability.  For most of human history
that\'s all we had.  Horse breeders bred better horse w/o knowing a whit
about genetics, blacksmiths refined metalworking technology and
industrialists created steel without having the slightest idea of crystal
structures or other facts of modern metallurgy or solid state physics. 

Knowing how something works is the basis of all human technology, that
will still be around.  Knowing *why* something works is very much of a
rarity.  While it is the hallmark of modern science and technology, it is
also darn unusual and clearly not necessary for progress to occur.  We
won\'t be one the same asymptotic progress curve w/o it, but neither will
our civilization collapse. 

If our technology surpasses our understanding we will either:

1) Get more intelligent to understand it again (Vingian Singularity)

or

2) Technological advance will slow down again and the rate of
technological progress will go back to the way it was prior to the last
150 years (i.e. pretty darn slow). 

Option 2 actually looks a lot like Traveller, hmm...

 The module depicted is built to ground, and has one deck with

a 15m long cylinder the same diameter as the cutter (6m)

 It has airlocks at each end and four double occupancy staterooms.
Internal power and storage make it self-sufficient, though not
mobile, for months at a time.

 Such a ship could carry several Cutters for the setup work and have a
cargo bay or revolver-bay loaded with the modules, including modules
specifically built for laboratory space and some meant as expandable
connectors between full-size modules. Larger pieces like a central
dome with module connection points around it might be amusing, too...

Actually, these days we can get our probes to hit right on
without much problem.  However, my guess is that it would be
automated (with occaison remote checking) most of the way
in and, when it gets close the main world, take over active
remote control.

It depends on what you want.  If you just want hydrogen for fuel,
just have ships refuel in orbit.  There realy is no reason to
move it to the surface.

If you want to terraform, then you probably want to break them up
to dust and rain the water in.

Easiest way would be to \'weaken\' the iceteroid greatly, so that it\'ll break up into itty bitty tiny pieces parts when it grazes the atmosphere.  Then, shift its orbit so it grazes the upper atmosphere of the planet.  Maybe even put some high explosives (*NOT* nukes!!) in the center of the iceteroid.  When it *does* re-enter, it breaks up and melts in the air, dumping the water vapor into the atmosphere.

AFAIK, I\'m the first one to come up with this concept.  <grin>

Changes from previous version:
	-added small gas giants
	-removed radar signature for gas giants (gas giants absorb radar)
	-added rules for minerology/"prospecting"

Executive summary: 
Detection ranges in an empty hex for a "typical"
sensor (PEMS-13, AEMS-11) are as follows:

Object                  Passive Range           Active Range 
200-m iceball           50,000 km               500,000 km
Small Gas Giant         100 AU                  ----
        (1 billion years old)
Small Gas Giant         3 AU                    ----   
        (5 billion years old)
Large Gas Giant         3000 AU                 ----
        (1 billion years old)
Large Gas Giant         300 AU                  ----
        (5 billion years old)

Small military sensors (PEMS-13.5) multiply ranges by x3; big military
or science sensors multiply range by x10. These imply that almost all
large gas giants will have been charted by the Imperium but that small
gas giants will often have escaped detection.




In more detail, here are signatures on the FFS2 scale for all these
objects:

Object                  Passive/Vis     Passive/IR      Active
Rocky asteroid          +0.5            +0.0            +0.5 
        (habitable zone)
Rocky asteroid          +1.0            +1.5            +0.5 
        (inner zone)
Rocky asteroid          -0.5            -2.0 *          +0.5 
        (outer zone)
Rocky asteroid          -2.5            -5.5 *          +0.5 
        (Oort cloud or empty hex)

C-type asteroid         +0.0            +0.0            +0.5
        (habitable zone)
C-type asteroid         +0.5            +1.5            +0.5
        (inner zone)
C-type asteroid         -1.0            -2.0 *          +0.5
        (outer zone)
C-type asteroid         -3.0            -5.5 *          +0.5
        (Oort cloud or empty hex)

* indicates that science-grade sensors get an additional +0.5 to 
detect these objects using passive/IR.

Rocky asteroids are greyish (albedo 0.2 - 0.3). 
C-type asteroids are dark asteroids (albedo 0.05) mostly consisting of 
carbon compounds.
Comet nucleii and Kuipter belt objects roll 1d6; on 1 use the rocky
asteroid values, on 2-4 use the C-type values, on 5-6 use c-type with an
additional -1 to visible signature. (Ice exposed to cosmic rays becomes
extremely dark.) 


These values assume a 1-m radius asteroid. For larger or smaller asteroids
use the following modifiers:

Asteroid Size modifiers:
Asteroid Radius         Passive/Vis     Passive/IR      Active
1 m                     -2.0            -2.0            -1.0
10 m                    -1.0            -1.0            -0.5
100 m                    0.0             0.0            +0.0
1 km                    +1.0            +1.0            +0.5    
10 km                   +2.0            +2.0            +1.0
100 km                  +3.0            +3.0            +1.5


For people who want to do prospecting, a detailed mineralogical scan 
requires a second roll at the original detection difficulty, +2 
difficulty levels for a non-science sensor, and 1 full 30-minute turn
in which the sensor looks only at the target.

(In more precise DSR terms, scanning for minerals 
reduces the signature by 2 points and requires a roll on the usual 
detection table, at +2 difficulty levels for a non-science sensor. 
Note that the reduction of 2 points is usually offset by the 
tracking-already-detected target modifier (+1.5) and the scanning-a-single-
arc modifier (+1.0))

* indicates that science-grade sensors get an additional +0.5 to 
detect these objects using Passive/IR.

** gas giant planets and brown dwarfs have radar signature sufficiently
low that they have not yet been measured from the Earth, and I\'m not sure
how to calculate them; in all practical circumstances the target would be
detected visually or in the infra-red first. Some gas giants may have
moons or rings (active signature +0.5 to +4.0) that will be detectable
instead. (Roll 11+ on 2d6 to have reatined a moon, +1 for large gas
giants and +2 for very large; roll 1d6/2 for the moon\'s active signature.) 

Small gas giant numbers are extrapolations due to the lack of evolutionary
tracks for objects below Saturn\'s mass.



Detection can be calculated using the Definitive Sensor Rules (available
on the web or via email.) In essence, one adds the sensor sensitivity
(from FFS2 or the conversion notes in the DSR) to the target signature
and subtracts the range to calculate the "signal":

Signal = Sensitivity + Signature - Range + modifiers

and then compares to the following chart:
SIGNAL  active detection        passive detection
        task                    task
<0      (target cannot be detected under any circumstances)
0       Impossible              Impossible
0.5     Average                 Staggering (TNE: Formidable)
1.0     (automatic detection)   Average
1.5                             Easy
2.0                             (automatic detection.)

Ranges are taken from the following chart:

So, for example, a typical scout (Sensitivity=13.0) scanning for a 
rocky asteroid (passive (vis) signature = 0.5) at a range of 1 AU would
have a signal of (13.0) + (0.5) - 13.5 = 0.0, for an 
Impossible task to detect the asteroid.

A labship with a science-grade PEMS-14 looking for old gas giants in an
empty hex would have a signal of 14.0 (sensor) + 0.5 (empty hex science bonus) 
+ 4.5 (signature with science bonus) - 19 (range) = 0.5, a Staggering
task.

Remember the following modifiers to sensor sensitivity (taken from
the most recent version of the DSR) based on sensor location:

Sensor Location         Passive/Vis     Passive/IR      Active
Inner zone              -0.5            -0.5             0.0
Habitable zone           0.0             0.0             0.0
Outer zone              +0.5            +0.0             0.0
Oort cloud/empty hex    +1.0            +0.0 (normal)    0.0
                                        +0.5 (sci-grade)

(The full DSR also includes modifiers for long scans (1 day) and for
scanning only a single arc, which if combined allow a +1.0 for taking
2 weeks to do a scan.)


For reference, the numbers I got looked something like this:

(extract from the "natural objects" section of the sensor rules0
- ----
Detection ranges in an empty hex for a "typical"
sensor (PEMS-13, AEMS-11) are as follows:

Object                  Passive Range           Active Range 
200-m iceball           50,000 km               500,000 km
Small Gas Giant         100 AU                  ----
        (1 billion years old)
Small Gas Giant         3 AU                    ----   
        (5 billion years old)
Large Gas Giant         3000 AU                 ----

Large Gas Giant         300 AU                  ----
        (5 billion years old)

Small military sensors (PEMS-13.5) multiply ranges by x3; big military
or science sensors multiply range by x10. These imply that almost all
large gas giants will have been charted by the Imperium but that small
gas giants will often have escaped detection.

Yes, I\'m *sure* they do. 

I\'m tinkering this up strictly for roleplaying, so operator skill is going
to be an important factor.  For passives, I figure skill and sensor
sensitivity are about 2/3 of the equation with the other 1/3 being divided
among target size and various modifiers.  For actives, the sensor\'s
sensitivity is more important at short ranges and the operator\'s skill is
more important at longer ranges.

Something I have considered, but haven\'t worked the numbers out on, is
doubling the Sensor Sensitivities from FFS2 (I don\'t use .5\'s anyway), so a
13 goes to 26 and a 13.5 goes to 27.  This weights the target number toward
the sensors over the PC\'s skill, and that\'s a good thing, but it means I\'d
have to rework ranges.  Try this...


Range_Factor (RF):                round(log(km^5),0)-2

Passive_Reflective_Target (PRT):  round(log(Area),0)+modifiers

Passive_Emittive_Target (PET):    round(log(kw),0)+modifiers

Active_Reflective_Target (ART):   round(log(Area),0)+modifiers (min 1) 

Some Standard Ranges (for those that don\'t want to work them out)

These numbers assume a "IR-neutral" drive.  If the ship is maneuvering with
a reaction drive (or if T-plates put out high heat IYTU) add 2 to the
target numbers.  If the sensor platform goes active it raises its PET by 4
for everybody, and guarantees it will be detected by any ship that it
detects.

Is this better, or do I need to raise Sensitivity more?  And I\'m not really
happy with the way emitted signature is working out.  I\'d like the PET to
drop a little more for ships running quiet.  What I might do is just have a
standard -2 modifier for a ship running quiet..that would mean it was using
1% standard operating power.

	Contubernium:  8 man section
	Century:   unit of 80 men, (10 contubernia) commanded by a Centurion, 
assisted by an Optio (aide) a Tessarius (watch-commander) and a Signifer 
(standard bearer)
	Cohort:  unit of about 500 men (5-7 centuries) it is interesting that 
although the Cohort was an important maneuver unit on the battlefield, it did 
not have a separate command structure, orders went from legion HQ directly to 
centurions, the senior centurion of each cohort probably acted as tactical 
commander, but had no special command staff or rank-title.  The Signifer of 
the first century of the cohort probably carried the cohort standard.  The 
first cohort of the legion was made up of double-sized centuries (160 men).
	Vexillation:  since legions were often used to garrison key points 
they could not always be moved en masse.  Instead a "vexillation" was sent it 
was usually 2 cohorts or so (about 1000men) and the Legion\'s standard.  This 
size unit eventually evolved into the standrard size for a "legion" in the 
late empire
	Legion:  A unit of 10 cohorts (5000men)  had an overall commander the 
Legatus, and 6 staff officers, the Tribunes.  The centurion of the first 
century of the first cohort was called the Primus Pilus and was the senior 
"career man".  An ex- Primus Pilus could be appointed Prefect of the Camp and 
was in charge of the permanent camp facilities of the Legion.

	Centurions were men who came up through the ranks, and were very much 
the equivalent of NCO\'s or Warrant Officers, although they commanded units 
larger than modern NCO\'s command.  There were really only 7 men in a Legion 
who were the equivalent of commissioned officers:  the Legatus and the 
tribunes:

	The Legion (nearly all infantry, but with a few horsemen and integral 
engineer unit) was very much the focal point of loyalty like the Regiment.   
To it were attached non-citizen auxillary troops like archers and cavalry 
which would make it more like 	
a Brigade.

		Finally, My Point:    It seems that the Regiment is about 
adeal size for individual loyalty.  It is about the same scale as the Legion 
and both units are the focus of "Unit Identity".  I suppose that some of that 
has to do with the scale of the unit and the ability for at  least a part of 
the unit to survive almost any disaster (save the worst ).   Or because units 
any larger require a diversity of training and function to dilute that 
identity.   Or maybe its as big as it gets before members are no longer able 
to have a reasonable chance at being acquainted with the faces and names of a 
significant portion of  the members.

	Point 2:  Is the proportion of commisioned officers in the 3I as high 
as modern armies?   Pournelle has alot of grumblings about keeping the 
proportion of comminsioned officers low in an efficient military, and the 
Romans certainly seemed to agree.

You *could* handwave a lot of it off by claiming somebody went through the 
hassles of developing gravitic technology to higher than Imperium levels by a 
fluke that led them down the path *away* from Jump Drive.  There were several 
TL10, 11ish cultures in the OTU that never got Jump Drive.  Just as, in an 
*old* campaign of mine, I had a TL19 culture that went from TL9ish to TL17 
within 5 years from somebody stumbling on a way to create antimatter cheaply.  
<grin>  They didn\'t figure out Jump Drive til somebody came in and said 
\'hiya\', but had a couple research stations around a couple other stars a 
parsec away, connected by modified Bussard ramjets; the ramjets collected 
interstellar hydrogen to react with the onboard containerised antimatter for 
maximum efficiency.  Nifty piece of chrome...

BTW, that TL19 culture never *did* trust Jump Drive...
 
> What else has he written?  What would you recommend?

Dunno off the top of my head.  I copped \'Farside Cannon\' in a grocery store a few years back cause it looked interesting.  When \'Ring of Charon\' hit the bookstore, I jumped on it, then ground my teeth waiting for \'The Shattered Sphere\'.

It should be noted that, at a thrust of 1 G, you can negate this

Oh, but it would...they\'ll want to move to reach food beyone the range
of their telekinetic abilities, to move away from accumulated waste
material, to move on when the local food supply has been consumed, when
the food learns to move away itself.

It would be unlikely that their telekinetic abilities would have much
range in general, in fact I guess it would be on the order of most
manipulative organs on other life forms.

There might be unusual individuals with a great \'reach\', but that would
require a greater energy input. I think these guys are grazers, so
energy use is an important limiter....

Hmmm, I\'m going to have to think about these things a bit.

There\'s nothing like a couple of beers on a Friday afternoon to liberate the
thought processes.

Food for thought: Picture a create that has an ability to attract its prey, much
like a Venus flytrap. Once the prey is in range, the telekinetic ability
prevents the prey from escaping. That means that mobility is not required.

Waste products could be handled by a symiotic relationship with another creature
(which DOES have mobility) that feeds upon the waste.

I think such a mini-ecosystem would be a fine thing for adventurers to discover.

Seriously, the development of intelligence, and later technology, is of
little clear evolutionary value, as I see it, to stationary lifeforms,
mostly because the energy requirements are a fair bit higher than most
sessile organisms can generate.

Secondly, I\'m making the assumption here that their telekinesis has
similar energy requirements to using feet to move around and hands to
grasp, etc, except it is expressed as varying energy fields, not
discrete grasping or motile structures.

Therfore they have quite a bit higher energy requirements than do
sessile organisms. This was probably due to evolutionary pressures at
some point, possibly the same ones that lead to the development of
telekinetic abilities in the first place.

While such behavior could have occured in their evolutionary path, they
would bear the same relationship to the Lumps that, say, sea cucumbers
do to us.

OK. In short, what those of us in the anti-piracy faction proved was not
that piracy is economically unfeasable in the Imperium.

What we proved was that piracy *around mainworlds* is unfeasable.

Piracy will still occour, but it will be \'chicken stealing\' in the
outsystem, or in other areas known to be unsafe (assume you have a naval
base on Terra. Some A2 Far Trader gone pirate jumps in to near a mining
colony on Titan, shoots up a couple of fighters and grabs an ore shuttle.
Even if you have the whole thing on tape from your super-duper Sens 15.5
MilSpec passive sensor, you cant actually get any heavy units there in
time. Now if our friend in the A2 jumps in and tries to grab a freighter at
or about the 100 diameter limit, different story).

Merchants going into unsafe areas will of course be well-armed, and demand
higher freight rates or charge higher prices for their goods.

In short, piracy will occour by consent.

Now, this is actually *good* for GMs. If players want to get those nice
chunky risk premiums (say, an extra Cr 500 per dton of freight), then they
are going to have to go outside the nice warm fuzzy zone of safety provided
by the mainworld\'s defenses.

I had an idea for an adventure along these lines a while ago (while
living in Boston, where the Constitution is moored, about 10 years ago;
it was also a great field trip in fourth grade).  An historical warship
is at the high port as a museum, run by the Imperial Navy.  Maybe it\'s
still commissioned, and maybe not.  It should be at some backwater
world.  The museum staff, expecting war, quietly make the ship
spaceworthy and bring at least her main weapons online.  War breaks out,
and the ship is a big surprise to someone -- the Zhodani scouts who
appear to check out the system, the Ine Givar ground forces who thought
they\'d take over the government in a walk, etc.

At least. Considering that you have to be careful where and how
you place your thrusters, since these snowballs are somewhat less
cohesive than your average rock, no less complex a job than
repairing an earth-orbiting satellite. If you don\'t distribute
the force properly, you create internal stresses that tear the
object apart. Your iceteroid and thruster arrive scattered in multiple
smaller pieces hopefully somewhere along the way.

This thruster has its own self-contained fusion reactor?  Which
operates on unrefined solid fuel? A high-tech device indeed.  As
far as fuel needs being "trivial", IMTU I break perpetual motion
machines: they aren\'t allowed.

This guidance system has to be programmed with the trajectory,
which is hard to do if it doesn\'t know where it is or which way
it\'s going to begin with. This should take more than a few minutes.
These thrusters are looking more and more sophisticated.

>At one 1 G you can cover 10% of the orbit in a matter of days.

You can cover 10% of the orbit in a matter of days, or you can
pin thrusters on iceteroids, but I refuse to believe you can do
both at the same time.

As I said before, weeks at a time when it\'s cold, dark, and
lonely, with stressful work in a hostile environment is as good a
recipe for insanity as any.

I\'m not saying the project is impossible, but I seriously doubt
that it\'s easy or cheap compared to GG or ocean refueling. It
does have the potential for some adventure seeds.

There was something like this in one of the \'Far Passage\'s, #5, IIRC.  A 
multi-kiloton experimental tender named \'Star Rider\' aquitted itself well in 
the Solomani Rim War (998-1002, IIRC), then was mothballed.  A few years 
previous to the openning of the adventure, it was sold to the Shenk Historical 
Foundation (or something like it), but was hijacked on the way while refueling 
in a gas giant.  The \'jackers had a couple plants in the Star Rider\'s crew, 
plus brought over a pile of boarders in the \'Proloth\', a Far Trader that 
rendezvoused with Star Rider after the planted agents pulled the fuses from 
the reactor\'s power busses, temporarily disabling it and causing the skeletal 
command crew to send out a distress signal.  The boarders faked a big 
explosion on the far side of the gas giant, threw down some junk, then pulled 
the ships out to stash them while repairs were made and the coast was clear.  
Eventually, Star Rider was the core of a band of pirates, hauling captured 
SDBs around to attack shipping.

Cute adventure.  <grin>

1)  Piracy within the "Core" regions of the imperium is next to impossible.

2)  Piracy on the outter areas is somewhat easier but still quite difficult.

3)  Priacy on the rim (extreme outter area) is much easier still but the targets are likely to be much better armed so it\'s really a trade off.  Sure you can shoot him up but what kind of shape are you likely to be in after the fight?

Profitable Piracy required a number of things.

1)  For knowledge of the cargo, there\'s nothing worse than taking a load of brussel sprouts.  ICK!!!  This requres an insider at the cargo transfer point.

2)  The ability to quickly and effectively disable the vessel so it can be delt with before it can alert the athorities.

The first one is somewhat easier, there\'s always some one who will talk, the second is far more difficult but we came up with a number of ideas.

1)  EMP - Hiding an EMP device in the ships cargo would effectively disable the vessel while leaving it largely intact.  This is a little difficult as the easiest way to generate an EMP in Traveller is either through detonating a nuke, not
going to leave much cargo for you to grab, or by hitting it with a PAW.  We decided the easiest way to accoplish this was to ship a small (read person sized) PAW with a one shot battery with the vessel.  The PAW would be in a customs sealed
crate so no one would look inside it.

2)  Trojan Horse - Get a member of your crew aboard the target vessel and somehow disable the vessel from within.  This was considered far riskier but by introducing a two part toxin into both the food and the environmental systems the
ships crew would be either dead or unconcious in a matter of hours.

3)  Beware of Techs Bearing Upgrades - While undergoing routine mantiance the ships computer is infectect with an astrogation virus, no not the VIRUS a virus, the point of the virus is to not today, not tommorow but say three jumps later or
so to induce a misjump, well alter the jumps exit point, which causes the vessel to emerge in deep space at the site of a trap.  With no Jump fuel and no escape the crew will be forced to surrender.

There were a couple of other ideas we came up with but those were the highlights of the brainstorming session.

	I think I clarified that a bit lower down.   A centurion in status

status, I mean that his rank was solely dependent upon the will of the 
"commissioned officers" who were the tribunes and legates who had their 
position from the Assembly of Centuries (Republic) or directly from the 
Emperor (Imperial).    The tribune was strictly a "staff" position in that he 
was in charge of administrative functions delegated by the legate,  there was 
no unit of soldiers that was commanded by a tribune, except on an ad hoc 
basis as delegated by the legate.  The 6 tribunes acted as "unit XO" for the 
whole legion.
	I omited decurion, because it was not a rank used in the Imperial 
age, there was no specific "sergeant" for a contubernium.  Decurion does 
indeed belong to the manipular age and perhpas into Caesar\'s time.  Decurions 
were replaced by the Optio, tessararius and various ranks of men designated 
"immunis" meaning they were except from hard labor beacuse of special skill.  
This change tok place when the army became all long-service professionals 
under Augustus.
	I would agree that a tribune is more or less field-grade (=major) but 
a legate is a personal appointment of an emperor responsible only to him or a 
provincial governor who might command up to 5-6 legions.   Since there were 
only ever at most 30 legions in the Roman Imperial Army, and since with 
auxillaries the legate had between 5,000-10,000 men of various types of 
troops, I think it is safe to call him a General Officer.  
	In the pre-imperial, pre Marian legion, there was no such thing as a 
legate.  Each legion did not have its own single commander, instead all 
legions in a particular army were commanded by either a consul, praetor, 
proconsul or propraetor, all of who had been granted the right of "Imperium" 
or command by the Assembly of Centuries.   There were also several tribunes 
elected for each legion by the Assembly, but their function was similar to 
the Imperial Tribune.   The military tribunes in all but the very earliest 
age (before 300 BC) were seen as a "training post" for future commanders.  
	The centurions basically ran the day-today operations of the 
Manipular legion the senior centurion in each maniple getting his orders from 
the magistrate-commander by way of the tribunes.  
	Legates, as we understand them were invented by Pompey and 
universalized by Augustus.  The idea being someone who was selected or 
delegated as a substitute for a commander who was legally in charge but in 
absentia.  Pompey used legates to govern Spain of which he was legal 
governor, while he stayed in Rome to watch domestic politics.   Augustus 
decided to appoint a single legate to each province and legion over which he 
was legal commander (i.e., all the legions apart from 1-2 in proconsular 
provinces). (Other commanders such as Caesar had used ad hoc deputies called 
legates, but they didn\'t have the saem legal standing).
	The idea of 1 commander/rank for each level of organization or unit 
of maneuver was not a universal practice in Roman armies.  It may seem 
strange that a Centurion of the 5th century of the 1st Cohort, who commanded 
only his century, would outrank the centurion of the first century of the 
second cohort, who had theoretical command of a whole cohort.  That\'s how it 
worked, centurions started as centurion of the 5th century of the 10th cohort 
and worked their way up as openings developed one step at a time, until 
becoming Primus Pilus (first centurion of first cohort).  The number of men 
commanded at any one time had no basis on rank/status.

multitude of pocket empires for the pirates to be supplied in, refitted, and 
to sell their loot. (although I agree with th eposters about IY 1100).
	In the Long Night/New Dawn/Early Empire I was thinkling about what 
would be the easiest, most tempting and most lucrative items for pirates.  My 
answer was:  Small Craft.   Small craft are very expensive, reasonably 
compact and of great interest to purchasers trying to return to space or gain 
a miltary edge on abalkanized planet.  So I came up with this scheme:

One surprising custom that arose was called "Small Craft, Free Pass."   Small 
craft such as Ship\'s boats and Shuttles were incredibly valuable commodities 
that could be easily transported and sold almost anywhere for an excellent 
price.  They were also very easy to destroy in space combat or just damage so 
much that they are unusable.   As a result, many pirates issued a radio 
command called "Small craft, free pass" to the crews of small craft they 
encountered.   The deal was: if the crew surrendered, the pirates would 
release them unharmed at the next "neutral" or safe port of call.  This offer 
was not always honored by the pirates, of course, but was respected more 
times than not, especially if the pirates were looking to establish a 
reputation in the area.  The rationale for this was that the more crews that 
show up safe, the more small craft would surrender without a fight.  
Generally, military small craft crews were less likely to get a pass, and if 
they did they were likely to face court martial for cowardice if the craft 
was armed.

You may also want to check out the MegaTraveller Equipment Sheet for "Advanced

These would be a LOT cheaper than using cutter modules and you could transport a
lot more in the same volume (52KCr each, collapse to 72 kL, holds 4 to 8

That\'s what flies do. Considering that we humans consume the waste
products of photosynthesis, we\'re kind of like flies in that way. But
I\'m not taking that line of reasoning any further.

I agree with your conclusion, although I\'d argue that the reason
intelligence is not of clear evolutionary value is not because of the
energy requirements (which are still undetermined) but because they
simply don\'t need a high I.Q. to survive.

The Blob\'s brain would be structured very differently that our brain.
Most of its internal workings would be geared toward the projection of
psionics. That, in itself, might be the stem of an adventure:

The adventurers are hired to capture, quietly, one of these creatures
(who live on a Red-zoned world) for a mysterious person (who is really
an agent of either the Psionics Institute or the Imperial Army).
Naturally, the Blobs are able to recognize when they are being attacked,
and can defend themselves using their powers.

While we\'re on THAT topic, what preys on a Blob? The obvious answer, an
animal with a built-in psionic shield, seems too predictable.

I don\'t think that\'s true. From what I recall of the Psionics rules in
CT/MT, Psionic Strength points can be focussed much better than
attribute Strength points. Consider that a character uses his strength
almost constantly, to move himself around, to lift things, etc. The Blob
only uses its Psionic Strength for catching prey and for defense, and
only has to do that when its hungry or under attack. The rest of the
time it rests.

Agreed.

You know, this thread is causing me work. I\'m running Traveller tonight,
and I think I might present the group with the adventure I outlined
above, instead of the stuff I had been preparing for.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been listening in over the past week or so on the "Great Virus
Debate" waiting for it to devolve into the "Great Virus Flame War"
something which generally seems to happen on about week number three.

You all make good points on what I agree is definitely a very arguable
and controversial point.  Many people don\'t like the Virus, some people
do, I admit I like the Virus I just try not to think to hard about it\'s
MO because if I did I\'d have to work through all the other logic /
reality problems in the game as well like Jump Drive, Contra Grav,
Artificial Gravity, Reactionless Thrusters.  Well you get the point.

With Virus the point is, it exists in the literature there for we have
to accept it the hard part for many of us is figuring out the "WHY" and
"HOW," that\'s what I think we should be focusing on here not the "why it
can\'t" and "how impossible it is."

What do we know about the computer\'s of the Traveller Universe?

Realistically not a whole hell of a lot, we\'re seperated by nearly 5000
years I\'m sure a lot has happened between now and then inspite of the
Long Night.  But here\'s what we do know.

1)  They\'re still using silicon.

2)  They\'re likely considerably faster, however the tables presented in
FF&S 1 and 2 really don\'t bear this out.  They\'re larger, heavier, more
expensive and only give you a maintenance modifier that\'s in the
neighborhood of three times more effective.

Man Intell really fell down on the job didn\'t they?  "Introducing the PM
Chip from Intell, sure it\'s the size of a Buick but think of how much
faster it is..."  (M is the Roman numeral for 1000 just in case).  Maybe
Imperial ships use high compression vaccum tubes...

3)  They likely can do a pretty good job a faking their way through AI
but their conversation patterns are likely somewhat limited.

4)  While they may adhere to the binary code it is possible that
something else could have been developed in the meantime to replace this
basic operating level.

5)  They\'re likely about as closely related to our modern computers as
our modern computers are to Eniac and Univac.

6)  They\'re also likely self programming, that is you tell them what you
want and they create a program based on what you\'ve said.

What do we know about Virus.

1) It\'s a silicon based life form.

2) It is capable of imprinting it\'s pattern on other pieces of silicon
from a distance.

3) It has been engineered as a weapon and as such is familiar with all
Imperial methods of virus (hacker created) detection.

4) All Imperial ships and any non-Imperial ship which enters the
Imperium already have a Virus on board (Deyo Transponder) which is
plugged into all the ships vital functions.

5) The larger the computer architecture the smarter the Virus is.

Does everyone agree with these 11 basic assumptions?

Now if you were a scientist working at research station Omicron how
would you make it work?

Don\'t say it can\'t because remember, at one time you couldn\'t sail
around the world because it was flat and you\'d fall off, and you
couldn\'t break the speed of sound because it was unbreakable and you
couldn\'t get a rocket into orbit because it was impossible.

I feel like Yoda here, instead of thinking about why it can\'t figure out
how it can.

Some General in the States watched Predator went back to his people and
told them he wanted a cloaking device like that for his soldiers,
instead of telling the General he was out of his friggin\' mind because
it was just a movie they started working on some ideas.

Work on some ideas people.

Having spent many years working in a nuke plant I feel that I have seen the
computers of the 3I in action.  On the desk sit three little terminals: one
attached to a mainframe/mini computer, one to a PC network and one to the
outside world.  Behind this and unseen are five complete sets of information
gathering, processing, routing and storage system.  The mini is gathering
info from three sensors for each plant system that is being monitored
(required redundancy).  There are also two controller for each operated
output device.  All of these cables must be shielded, separated and must
travel to the devices by different paths through the plant.  The networked
PC uses NONE of the same cabling routes or hardware.  It is for
communication, logs, storage of compiled data, trending, etc.  There are
servers, routers, etc all over the plant, some attached to security systems,
or seismic monitors or weather monitors, time and sea water temperature
monitors, etc.  The third, also separate, system is for communication with
the outside world.  Plant status and regulatory info, output wattage,
incoming wattage, environmental information.  Several plants in the area are
part of this network.  By now you get my point.  The mass allocations from
CT have always seemed very reasonable to me.  The software capabilities,
however... :-)

You run into that here on Earth.  We had a Japanese friend visit, and she

  You know, pirates could probably use drop tanks to deply from their
hidden tribe bases to their interdiction stations, and thus have full
internal tankage to return to base.

  No doubt the tanks could be refurbished by the same facilities that
handle annual maintenance, combat repairs, and new builds.

    'body' => 'The typical issue with trading with low-tech systems
is what money do they have to give in return for your goods.
Low-tech, by definition, mean\'s poor when it comes to societies,
and the large majority of interstellar lines bypass the majority of
these unrewarding systems.

Of course, what the interstellar lines bypass, the free trader
pick\'s up.

**********

Free trader market\'s on low-tech worlds

There will alway\'s be the local elite, but it\'s unlikely that they
can produce enough demand to fill a ship\'s hold in any given week,
and pay enough in hard currency (Imperial Credits, precious metals)
to provide a profit.  Some may be able to: I don\'t know if a
Starport E would have turned a profit in the Roman Empire, Ming China, or in Bagdad under the A\'bbasid Caliphate, but I
suspect that they could have.

There may well be high-tech expatriates, living on the low-tech
world.  A typical selection includes Imperial servants (civil service,
military service, nobility), local ventures backed by high-tech
concerns, and interstellar traders.  These would make a good
market for free traders goods, and they pay in Imperial Credit\'s,
too!

Low-tech worlds near high-tech systems may well have economic migrants from high-tech worlds, who able to keep a much
higher living standard on a low-tech world than they would
have been able to at home.  (Cheaper land, lower cost of living,
able to hire servants, etc).  These migrants are typically retirees:
rarely do poor people migrate from a rich world to a poor world.
On the other hand, the retirees came here to live cheap:
it\'s unlikely that they have much to spend of free trader goods.

The masses on a low-tech world are unlikely to afford any of the
usual trade goods that free trader\'s bring along.  The creative
trader may yet be able to get some kind of profit from them: for
example, shipping in several tons of plastic jugs to a TL 4-5 world,
communication wire (superconducting?) to a TL 8-9 world
(it\'s already obsolete on it\'s original world, but high-grade to the
buyer\'s), pet animals to a world without any animal life, etc.

Basically, you are looking for stuff that is dirt cheap (or better,
free excluding transport costs) on the original world, and selling
them at a low yet profitable price on the low-tech world.  The
great issue with this is transportation cost: can the cost of
transport be kept low enough to make this worthwhile?


***********

Currency and barter

In small, low-tech worlds, there may not be enough trade to provide sufficent Imperial Credit\'s to allow the trader to
get paid in that currency.The trader may accept local currency, but low-tech currency is usually worth little or nothing
outside of the planet in question.
And,of course, the local currency may be non-convertable or diffictly to convert:  I believe that Chinese currency can\'t
be taken out of the country, for example.

The trader have to keep it on planet, and somehow put the money to work for him, purchasing real estate or in some other
safe local investment.  (That, of course, was the intent of the world\'s government)

In a Vilani-dominant economy, there may well be many safe but low/no growth areas in the local economy, so the free
trader will be sure that his money will still be there when he retires 30 years from now, but not a penny more.  In a
Solomani economy, there is
a greater potential to make your money grow, as well as a major risk that your money will just vanish, either stolen or
caught in an economic crash (stock market, fall of the government, real estate collapse, etc.).

Another possibility is barter.  This is difficult in a technological
society, but not impossible: major sections of the Russian
economy is currently running on barter.  This is a major test of the
free trader\'s skill, as he needs to have an eye on what his
stuff is worth compared to the goods the other party has to offer,
without a currency unit that can equally measure both items.
The other guy typically knows the local market much better than the
trader, but the trader knows the off-planet market\'s better than
the low-tech local knows.

Goods, of course, need not include only physical things.  Information
is a favourate good, but you need a keen mind to know how much
that information is worth.  The locals may also trade labour:
perhaps a group of local scientist\'s have put their services to
market ( to research a new drug, design an new plane, or build a
new weapon ).  The impoverished youth may be more than willing
to sign up as fodder for a mercenary group, anything to get
off-planet.  Outside of the Imperium, there may also be
slave labour available, or psionic individuals who will sell their
services for a fee.

The lease v. buy was a decision of the IBM marketing and
sales board.  At the start of the product cycle, IBM preferred
to lease the machines. After a few years and just before a
new system came out, IBM would offer wonderful purchase
options with \'incentives\'.   The result was that the customer
paid for the machine in the lease payments and paid for it
again, by buying it, just before it became obsolete.

The best example was a planet that was low tech by choice, and the

Now, they exported a highly valued alcoholic beverage to the rest of the
galaxy.  One enterprising free trader found a world with an abundance of
lumber, which had a high density, made excellent building material, etc...
He put two and two together to come up with 1) I trade this really useless
low tech wood to the planet that can only use low tech building materials
2) in return, they pay me with the famed liquor that the galaxy craves.

Things like that might work for low tech, high tech trade.

 Just a thought:
 
 Did you ever notice that, in Traveller, the same skill covers operation, 
 programming, theory, and repair of computers? Why would that be?
 What change would have had to occur in how computers work to

 complicated than popping prebuilt modules together?
 
 I realize that Traveller\'s Computer skill was written to abstract a

The Star Rider was an experimental Transport.  In High Passage 5 is the
recounting of how the ex-INS ship was used in by pirates to retrieve
non-jump-capable ships, then jump out system.  The Navy had listed the ship
as destroyed in 1102.  The spinal mount was not operational at that time.
The TCS info for the pirate band is:

I guess this means that this transport could carry all of those SDBs?

Those SDB\'s were 400 ton jobbies:

The 14 SDBs total 5600 tons, for a combined volume of 45,600 tons for the ship.

To prevent retaliation from Imperial forces, they can fire automated jump
torps loaded with Virus eggs (or whatever they are called) against nearby
Imperial bases.  

They can also use near-c rocks to hold world\'s hostage.  

Furthermore, they are actually employed by Strephon\'s clone.

The enigma was digitial. It had discrete states (rotor positions). 

The analog computers used for the big guns on battleships were
essentially a bunch cams riding on a carefully shaped surface (a
complex curve).

Scout biologist II gives SBI a *strange* look: "Where did you get your
training again?"

You see, such behavior is *common*. Fecal matter, does have a lot of
nutrients in it Usually stuff that it wasn\'t worth the effort for the
critter to digest. But for a creature with a lower energy budget, it\'s
a fine food source. 

Check out "dung beetles" in any decent text.

A sessile predator will have adequate energy sources, *especialy* since
it doesn\'t need to waste energy on moving.

So? That merely means it has the same energy budget as a mobile
predator. Though I could make a strong argument for it being *lower*
because it doesn\'t have to chase things. 

They *will* have to be well camouflaged *or* have a range greater than
line of sight. Otherwise their prey will simply learn to stay out of
range.

    'topic' => 'Slavery within Traveller',
    'index' => 'dn705',
    'month' => '05',
    'body' => 'Traveller slavery: Imperial Space

I cannot recall any place in canon that suggest\'s that slavery was banned
in the First Imperium, or any place where it is specifically
mentioned.  I would guess that, in a status- and caste-bound society,
in love with tradition, corporate efficency and long-term stability,
there would indeed be a minority of slaves in the Ziru Sirka, usually
non-Vilani.  Slavery would normally have a political rather than an
economic goal, to break the local culture and lock in a habit of obedience
to Vilani cultural mores.

No information exist\'s on the Second Imperium\'s view of slavery,
but seeing the United Nation ban on slavery, it\'s likely that it was
abolished.  And of course, the Terran\'s had no problems with interfering
with local cultures....

In T4\'s Warrent of Restoration, only chattel slavery is actually
banned.  It is likely, however, that by 1100 all form\'s of slavery
within the Third Imperium is in effect banned: State law have
a way of growing on you.  Also there\'s no law forbidding an
Emperor from expanding the range of the slavery ban, (or,
I admit, shrinking it back to the level in the Warrent.)

As to why slavery is banned?

My take on the Imperium is that of a pagan society, so I doubt
if the arguments of the American abolitionist\'s would cut any
ice here.  Instead, the reason\'s have more to do with the intellectual
underpinnings of trade.  Cleon I, when designing the Imperial
government wished to maximise the number of consumers that
are available to sell Imperial goods to.  He could tolerate
economic slavery, as that merely insures that debt\'s are paid.
Indentured service is merely a long-term contract, which ends
when conditions are fulfilled or one of the parties die.  Slavery
as a form of punishment is perfectly justifiable, as merely
another tool of a local government and culture.  Slavery by the
State is unfortuate, but part of the sovereign rights of nations
within the Imperium, and recognized as such: Vilani cultures
would consider any attack on State slavery as an indirect attack
on their heavily bureaucratic, statist culture, and would treat it as
such.

However, chattel slavery would permamently exclude not only the
slaves themselves, but their descendants as well, from a full participation
in Imperial markets.  Their cheapness would hinder industrialization,
keeping systems poor, low tech, and outside of Imperial trade.
People without any hope for freedom may fix the blame for their
condition on the Imperial government, increasing military cost\'s and
taxes and weakening Imperial commerce.  The legalization of chattel lavery would tempt a future Emperor to soil his
hands with it,
weakening Imperial claims of moral supremacy in the eyes of Christian
and Christian-influenced Solomani.  And the fact that this system could
keep on going for as long as humaniti exist\'s will keep these issues on
the boil for ages.

***** *****

Traveller slavery: outside of the Imperium

The Solomani Confederation has only one principle: the supremacy
of the Solomani race.  When you factor in the fact that the Confederation
is, indeed, a confederation of several governments, it becomes probable
that slavery does exist to some extent within the Solomani sphere
As to how widespread?  Well, that depends on the local culture\'s
and religion\'s.  It\'s probable that Christianity retain\'s a good deal of
influence within the Sphere (and even in Imperial Solomani nobility),
tending to limit/ban slavery where it exist\'s.  "For we serve but one
Master..."

Surprisingly, most non-Solomani within the Confederation are
not enslaved:  so long as they recognize the Solomani destiny to rule
the Galaxy, they are left alone to live as they wish.  The Solomani,
of course, are into creating new species and races to inhabit various
worlds, and have an image of themselves leading all sentients
into prosperity and freedom under their rule, rather than exterminating
them so that only Solomani exist.

The Hive Confederation doesn\'t actually rule their worlds: individual
hives and local societies do.  Most hives don\'t pratice slavery, viewing
it as irrational.  There is a suspicion within Imperial circles that slavery is
really too obvious for a race that prefer\'s to manipulate it\'s subjects
into obedience, rather than beat them up.  Note that Hiver\'s are
quite individualistic, and have a distaste for the obvious use of force:
they would tend to rule their subject\'s in the same way.

The Two Thousand Worlds would do whatever it takes
to eliminate carnivorous behavour in their subjects, including
slavery and genocide (genetic manipulation seems to be unheard-of
there).  The K\'kree generally seem to prefer to leave member societies
alone, otherwise: they are big on traditional rule for themselves, at least.

***** *****

Traveller Slavery: The Zhodani Consulate

The Zhodani Consulate, of course, is a Total State.  As such, everyone
except the nobility are slaves to the State, and everything exist\'s
to serve the State, of course including the official religion.

(Plato\'s Republic of philosopher-rulers and the monolithic State,
brought to the 57th century: complete with mystical powers, no less!)

The Zhodani nobility are generally not interested in being brutes or thugs,
however: the democratic conceit that all slave owner\'s are evil has a lot to
do with democratic ideology, and little to do with historical accuracy.

Instead, the Zhodani nobles really do prefer to look out for the interest\'s
of the Proles, not only as an obvious form of enlightened self-interest,
but often as a demonstration of his power and (self)-righteousness.
Such actions help to legitimize their rule.  And yes, his rule DOES need
to be constantly legitimized: there are only a few psionic individuals
per 10,000 (or more) people, and only a portion (20% ?) of psion\'s
are mind readers.  Of that percentage, only a minority are powerful
enough to rewire mind\'s to think in the State-approved manner, and
this takes energy, disipline, and time.

Moreover, to gain popularity, the Zhodani nobility has found it
necessary to *guarantee* happiness to the Proles.  Such promises
are expensive to keep, and would not be made if it wasn\'t needed.
That same reluctance to provoke the wrath of the Proles encourages the
use of warbot\'s, rather than put up a draft.  The nobility, with
it\'s superhuman powers, has to continually and publicly kneel before
public demand\'s for honour, morality and truthfullness less jealousy
and suspicion get\'s a strong foothold in the public mind.

The Proles are slaves, indeed - but slavery shape\'s the master, also.
Even S.M. Stirling\'s Draka get to have a built-in "protective instinct"
towards their serf\'s.  They may rape the children of their serf\'s, but the
children must be made to feel happy rather than violated, and the parent\'s
rewarded rather than humiliated.

Some may claim that Zhodani obsession with mental health
would forbid such actions.   Nonsense, of course: much of what was
considered mentally unhealthy 100 years ago is considered "normal" today,
from homosexuality to mastubation to abortion.  And there is no reason
to believe that it won\'t change again 100 year\'s from now, depending on the political climate.

On the other hand, the Zhodani are not us: their society is quite rigid,
and the psionic nobles seem to take their duties seriously.  It is
most likely that the psions train their own minds to do their duty,
and set up mental blocks in each other\'s mind to limit abuse of the
Proles.  Otherwise, they would have long ago raped the local population
silly, then turn on each other, with predictable consequences.

On the gripping hand, the Zhodani sense of morality is not based on the
Mosaic code, but on whatever is best for the State.  They recognize no
law that can\'t be changed by the arbritary rule of the omniscient State,
and do not dread the Lord of the Jewish prophet\'s, who hear\'s the cry
of the afflicted.

And of course, the nobles do NOT have the right to be happy, so it\'s
perfectly understandable - in the Zho\'s viewpoint - for them to take their
comforts where they can.  In moderation, of course.

So long as perversity is done "in moderation", it\'s quite possible for the
Zhodani to be highly competent rulers, and occassionaly indulge in
"recreation" with young boy\'s just growing their first beard, just as
Socrates did.  Set up the culture to run that way for 7000 years
and you will swiftly have a competition for young Proles as escort\'s
to the nobility, quite willing to prostitute themselves to get on the
fast track to fame and power.

(The Zhodani Consulate was founded in -5823 Imperial / 1303 B.C.,
around the time of the time of Judges in Israel, Ramses I of Egypt,
and the Shang Dynasty of China.  They would hit Jump-1 in -5418 /
898 B.C.)

***** *****

Treatment of Slaves

Treatment of slaves depend\'s on how closely they are like their master\'s.
I would guess that treatment from best to worst would scale to:

No difference (same species, race, religion/ideology, culture, etc.)
Different culture
Different religion
Different race
Different species, with physical resembelances (ie mammal-like,
  walk\'s upright, uses speech to communicate, no unusual abilities
  or deviation for the human norm)
Different species, with some major differences
Different species, with lot\'s of major differences
Not an animal
Not a organic living being
Not a physical being

History will have a major effect on the treatment of slaves:
a long tradition of slave obedience and obligated masters can
make some forms of servitude preferable to freedom,
if judged materialisticly and politically.

Also of importance is the slave-holder\'s religion. Different 20th century
atheistic ideologies, for example, can include

- - effectively forbidding the holding slaves (Objectivism, most form\'s
  of  libertarianism )

- - using slavery only as a form of punishment, or to repay debt\'s
  (Logically possible in some forms of libertarianism, I suspect)

- - The State own\'s everything, but in effect "leases"  it\'s property
   out to tenant\'s, who may use the property to their own
   advantage, so long as taxes are paid on it and State regulations
   of the use of State property is respected.  (Fascism, Socialism, the
   Corporate State .  The modern-day West operates on a limited,
   pacific varient of the Corporate State, IMO)

- - Individual\'s may not hold slaves, but the State may
   (Communism).  Ideology is more important than race in 20th
   century version\'s of this scheme.  In general, all except
   the elite member\'s of the government are effectively property
   of the State: their labour, their thought\'s, and their property
   will be disposed of in any way that the government feels desirable.

- - The individual may hold slaves, as well as the State.
   Within the 20th century, this has been limited to
   non-western nations: while a few Islamic states effectively
   legalize slavery, it\'s scope is limited.  No modern atheistic
   ideology that I am aware of permit\'s individual\'s to hold slave.

Variations within atheism include "selfish gene" ideology,
"freedom is all" libertarianism/anarchy, anti-state and pro-state
viewpoints, the joys of Darwinism, etc.  This range would only
expand after another 3000 years.

The above list may be of use in setting up a Hiver slave society: all
Hivers are atheists and incapable of using psionics.  There are two canon
exception\'s I know of: Hindu hivers - worshipping a kind of Hiver god -
on Terra in DGP\'s Solomani and Aslan, and a single, unique Hiver "dreamer"
able to psionically see the future, in GDW\'s Hiver\'s and Ithklur.  The
Hiver\'s are not particularly missionary in their belief\'s, and are willing to
let religions exist within their territory (which they will manipulate for
their own benefit, of course).

Other religious attitudes vary widely, including Islamic slavery
from Mohammed\'s time to the 19th century (and beyond, in some cases),
American Christians (both abolitionist and pro-slavery)  from the 17th
century to the Civil War, Eastern slavery (Buddist, Hinduist, Confucianist,
Shintoist), etc.  I would expect the an even greater range of attitudes in
the Solomani Confederation and the Vargr Extents, less so
in the Hive Confederation and Imperial Space, and much less so in the
Aslan Hierate, Zhodani Consulate, and the Two Thousand Worlds.

    'body' => 'Business Owner is the \'general form\' of Ship Owner advantage.

It gives a basic KCr 300 in capital, expressed as an equity stake in a ship
or another business.

KCr 300 is about 20 times annual income in the G:T universe.

The G:T universe has a basic rate of interest of 3%, so one could safely
assume that the business should earn about 3% of the KCr 300 a year, or KCr 9.

This is about Struggling, which is about right for a microbusiness (every
extra point adds KCr 150 to the investment, so an extra 5 points in BusOwn
would result in a far more comfortable income).

In a non-Trav campaign, you should adjust Business Owner to be worth less
capital - if in a fantasy campaign starting wealth is $1000, then the basic
worth of BusOwn is $15 000 or so (I wonder how many sheep that it ...).

Looking at the capital costs, basic Business Owner buys doesnt buy you much
- - a shiny new TL8 forklift is KCr 130, while a 5 ston orbital workpod costs
KCr 397. A Modular Cutter with freight module costs MCr 7.7 - far beyond
most sane and reasonable commitments (2 PCs each close to maximng out
Business Owner could afford one though).

The obvious solution is to have the point commitment represent the net
position of the business - it might have more in assets, but it is
encumbered by debts. This could let a business have actual assets.

In any case, the GM should require a Job Roll for the PC to actually run
the business.

Business-oriented players may ask about vertical integration - they own a
Groat Farm on Tarsus, but they think they can make more money (and have
more fun) if they arrange for export of the materials all the way to their
market on Trin, rather than just selling them to a trader at the extrality
fence. The way I would handle that is every KCr 20 of annual income is
represented by 1 dton of speculative goods. The players then have to get it
to market, have it clear customs, find a buyer and so on.

One other important market is ex-Imperial servicepeople.

If Imperial pensions are paid in Imperial credits, a world with 1000 20
year veterens will have IMCr20 burning a hole in their collective pockets
each month.

This is enough to support quite a bit of trade.

This is the absolute key. If you want to turn a lo-tech market into a
living, you *have* to find something they have that sells well elsewhere.

Handicrafts are an obvious example - a TL2 barbarian will prefer Star-man\'s
quilts because they are warmer and never get wet. A hi-tech dilletante will
gush over the decorative needlework of such a wonderfully genuine example
of not just pre-stellar but pre-industrial craftwork, no *art*work, and
demand to purchase it for eight hundred Imperial.

Less obvious are industrial products - how many on the list would buy a
Celtic Sword, made by a genuine Celt, assuming such was available ? You
could fit 500 swords into a dton, and at Cr50 each, thats an export cargo
worth 25 grand a dton.

\'Hand hewn Railway Sleepers benches ... avalable at all fine House
Accessory stores\'

\'Natural Wood. Because, really, what else matters but style ?\'

You have two excellent target markets on hi-tech worlds for lo-tech goods.
The first is the fashion market - with good enough marketing, the lo-tech
can be sold as a plus. Phrases like \'hand-made\', \'primitive\' and \'genuine\'
should be generously splattered around the brochures. Sure, the modern
equivalent is cheaper, lighter, more effective and doesnt get
creepy-crawlies living in it, but hell, since when has mere efficiency
mattered in fashion ?

The second market is the bleeding-heart market. The example I\'m thinking of
is Nicaraguan coffee during the Sandanista years. Nicaragua grows coffee -
it\'s decent but not great. It was marketed thru left-leaning orginisations
and such, with the not subtle subtext being \'Buy the Coffee to Support the
Revolution\'. I\'m sure people can think of other examples - the idea of
trade-as-aid has kicked around for a while. It isnt a big market, but if
you are selling to Trin, it doesnt have to be ...

Note that the first strategy will help prevent development in the long
term. A world that has carved a niche for itself may be locked into it - if
your sales pitched is based around lo-tech, then you *cannot* develop
without abandoning this niche.

One concequence seems to be a lack of \'mid-range\' worlds in the Imperium -
you are either small and poor, or big and rich. There doesnt seem to be a
hell of a lot in the middle.

Wouldn\'t that depend on the mainworld itself?

Sure, a pirate trying to perform his trade near the 100-diameter limit
of Terra will be blasted into space debris before he can even start his
boarding action. But what about at the 100-diameter limit of the planet
Blargh, with a class E starport and a population of 2,500 (2,750 every
other weekend)? 

(Then again, one could ask what would be worth stealing or hijacking in 
orbit around planet Blargh in the first place...)

I remember a gag from comedian Gilbert Gottfried -- he had the same question
about maple syrup that you pose about beer.

"Look! Coming out of this tree! It\'s disgusting brown goo! Let\'s eat it!
Let\'s make OTHER people eat it!"

Seriously, though, the idea of a garbage-eating alien was also done in one
of the series of Wild Cards books. In this series, some event (don\'t remember
the details) gives some people super powers ("Aces"); other people, it
produces 
big physiological changes in them ("Jokers"). (Most people are just
unaffected.)
In one book there\'s a "Joker" who looks like a humanoid walrus. Everyone
thinks
he\'s just another Joker, but he\'s really an alien hiding in plain sight, so to
speak, while studying us. His method of preparing meat so that it\'s edible for
him is to leave it sitting on the counter for a few weeks until it rots. 
(Ewwwww. I don\'t even want to think of what his place must have smelled like.)

Is Galanglic the same thing as English as it is spoken by the Solomani?  GT
says it is a "distant descendant of Terran English" but it isn\'t clear if
the descent is the evolution of English as a whole or the splitting off  of
Galanglic from English.

Also, how well have other languages survive on Terra?

was a visceral reaction to ongoing process, rather than a part of an economic

constitution (18th century).  Quartering of Soldiers is just not a major 
problem in the world today that needs constitutional remedy, as proper as the

repugnance.
Similarly, other forms of slavery practiced in the past to provide a pool of 
loyal underlings, such as the Janissary and Mamluke systems of the Middle 
East fail to make sense in a world with high technology.  It is much easier 
to obtain a reasonably loyal subordinate for a salary plus benefits (better

This is the best expanation of Virus I have ever read.  It neatly cuts the ground out from under all the "Virus can\'t do that arguments."  You may need to rule if only "life" can have Psionics in your Traveller universe.  If so then Virus is
alive & can therefore be detercted psionically via lifesense which is one of the longest range psionic powers.  This may have significant implications in detecting Virus.  However canon reference to using Computer Empathy to combat Virus
suggest it is more difficult than that.

But we _are_ at DS-1 and the Imperium is _7_ TTLs ahead of us.
Besides, if it really bothered them, they could just check in on it

Doesn\'t really apply either way.  Those are launch vehicle

Well, that reminds me of one of my "back burner" projects. I\'d like to
assemble the data on all the *seriously proposed* spacecraft designs
from the 1930s on. And convert them to Traveller. Ditto for some of the
real ones.

The idea is to use them as low TL craft. Heck, set up a system with a
minor human race and the right sort of planets, and have the players
make first contact about the time they finish the "Conquest of Space"
scenario from the 1950s. 

And using these as a "base" see what can be done about refitting some
of them into starships. My example from last time this came up was a
Space Shuttle that had been salvaged from an orbital junkyard and
refitted with a small fusion plant and a jump drive.

Yep, one of my most successful stings was Doyle\'s Eel, PC\'s lost their ship
and almost lost their lives because of a fake one of these things.

PC\'s had an NPC crewmember whose wealthy father didn\'t want working with
such riff raff... the boy was to inherit his father\'s empire one day, after
all.  So dad hired an assassin to take the crew out and "rescue" his son,
and show the boy how dangerous working for independents could be.

Scene:  A low class space port, away from the world\'s main starport, where
PC\'s were able to deal and sell stuff acquired through adventuring for ship
repairs and/or upgrades -- often legal, always dodgy.  This time they were
purchasing some military grade hardware for their serpent class extended
scout from a dodgy source... but someone they knew and trusted.  They saved
and dealt for months to afford such an upgrade, and took ages for their
friend to track it down and do the installation for them.

Enter the assassin... A nondescript man, looks like any maintenance man
anywhere on any world.  Just spent a few days on another ship in the space
port cleaning out an infestation of Doyle\'s Eels, and was offering to
"delouse" the other three ships here (including the PC\'s vessel).  Produces
a sealed, clear jar full, of clear liquid with one of the beasties in it and
a bio-hazard box on a work-tool trolley full of dead eels, "The Purple
Limpet was infested with these mothers!" (I had made the PC\'s aware of these
things when I first read about them under the assumption that if they were
such a well known pest, a SS crew would know about them -- and they
remembered).  They took the sealed jar and looked at it carefully and
decided they would pay the not-so-cheap fee asked for their removal (the
PC\'s thought I was using the eels to simply remove some cred\'s from them :^)
and were grateful the guy came along when he did.  The eels were a
high-quality, moulded rubber that appeared to be very real.

Booked in, the assassin had offered his "services" to all the other ships
there before asking the PC\'s, so he had access to their vessel just after
the refit was finished and a few days before they were expected to leave.
He had total access to **every** part of the PC\'s ship and placed explosives
in the most PC-inaccessible places he could (places the PC\'s wouldn\'t
normally require access to during routine running of the serpent) find, and
had them set to activate when the jump program was run, to explode 5-days
into jump (the bastard wanted the PC\'s to go through to near the end of the
jump before dying -- he was twisted like that :^).

Anyway, the PC\'s thanked him, went about prep to head off and load a cargo
and the assassin kidnapped the son of the wealthy patron.  PC\'s being PC\'s
in a hurry, decided to head off (the NPC wasn\'t a close friend or any such
thing) without the lad.  They ran some routine checks/manoeuvres and
whatever else they were supposed to do and when it was time, started to run
the jump routine and program.  Just then, the engineer failed a pre-jump
roll on a piece of equipment that had been faulty for several game sessions
previously, but passed the roll to correct the error, he then deemed (on the
side of safety) that they should cancel the jump, return dirtside and have
the thing properly repaired by the friend they trusted, knowing he would fix
it properly.  The rest agreed and they cancelled the jump and diddly bopped
off, back to planet-side.

They were in a bar when they saw on the news that a SS had exploded and been
destroyed in a small spaceport near their location -- there was only one
spaceport near their location... and they knew while watching the footage,
that their\'s was the only extended Serpent at that spaceport!!!

The assassin\'s wealthy patron was to have his son returned to him, and the
man was going to "help" his son find the PC\'s and "get them to return so his
son could re-join the crew" (thus being a nice guy), but ultimately point
out to the boy that they had disappeared, presumed lost, presumed dead.

The PC\'s ended up rescuing the NPC, but the guy failed moral or something
after their ship had been destroyed in port, and decided to return to dad
anyway!  The players enjoyed the trick, but never caught the assassin, they
enjoyed the game immensely.  The PC\'s then went on to the Traveller
Campaign...

Oddly enough, the many Japanese we have hosted as house guests in our home,
love cheese?  But when you put it that way, what about all the stuff they
eat everyday which is fermented (half rotten when you look at what it is).

But it does point out a diversity... "Raw fish!  They eat raw fish!?!?"  We
eat yogurt and can\'t come at raw fish?  Brings to mind some haggis... what
about a nice tongue sandwich?  Ox hearts?  Oooo... brainsssssss...  Looking
at what we eat, it wouldn\'t surprise me what an alien might eat at all!  ;^)

Some are thought to contain as much as sixty percent water.

They are also quite easy to get to. 30 of them are considered easier to get to
than the moon (due to their low gravity). So it should be fairly easy to prod
them into orbits close to the 100D limit. We could probably do it using existing
technology, albeit very slowly.

This provides enough hydrogen to fuel a main route with a million DT of trade
per week for around 40,000 years. [Figures based on Jump-2 20kDT Freighters
carrying 13kDT freight, 4kDT hydrogen]

Even if the figures are out by a factor of a hundred there is still plenty of
fuel in NEAs.

conquests and their subsequent tyranny and oppression (the
destruction/subjugation of every race with jump drive? this doesn\'t sound
like a harmonious, enlightened people).  Trouble is, this lack of
information and the bland depiction of the Vilani in published materials
don\'t really make them interesting to play, and the bulk of the population

by majority Vilani populations, through intermarriage and Solomani children
being raised in a Vilani environment.  It also leaves a gap about mainstream
3I culture.  We don\'t know how the citizens of the Imperium act and think.
The aslan ihatei are clearly defined, as are the Vargr.  The Solomani are
clearly defined also (they\'re culturally closest to Earth, and their

I have two words for you: "Sweat shops"

People are regularly arrested and prosecuted on slavery charges in the US
today, mostly revolving around small groups of illegal aliens.

One can argue, successfully, that these sorts of operations are artifacts of
our (the US, that is) convoluted and schizoid policies toward
immigration...that these people are here illegally, often at great cost
(putting them into indentured slavery off the bat) and must live as
non-visible a life as possible to avoid capture and deportation makes them
particularly vulnerable.

While as Alvin says, chattel slavery won\'t exist, indentured servitude,
so-called \'contract workers\' certainly will.

For instance, look at all those type 1 worlds out there. There are 696 of them
in the MT survey stats (Genie data set) with 3.83e12 people living on them
(almost 7% of the total Imperial population). Here it is broken down by TL:

Notice that the TL of these \'Corporate Worlds\' aka \'Company Towns\' peaks at
early stellar (TL9). They may be high tech workers, but a significant number
of them are going to be working under indentured servitude conditions. (How\'s
that old song go? "Moved Ten tons of coal today / one day older and deeper in
debt" )

Notice, the TL9 Corporate worlds _average_ out as Pop A worlds! These worlds
are the \'big guns\' of the Imperium, what all that trade is all about. Granted,
they\'re a small percentage of the population as a whole, but nearly 400
billion sophonts are nothing to sneeze at.

And DON\'T get me started on those Feudal Technocracies...while the book
definition may include the phrase \'mutual agreement\' serfs in feudal Europe
were bound to their land, essentially, they were slaves. (oops! Now I\'ve gone
and done it! "Pirates and Feudals and ViRocks, OH MY!" :-)

There are, by the way, 1253 systems in the database listed as Feudal
Technocracies, with a population of 5.0e12, or 9.1% of the total Imperial population...

IMTU, Galangic is about as close to Modern English as Modern English is to
the tongue spoken just after the Norman invasion.  A 20th Century
inhabitant suddenly dropped into the Imperium would have to learn the
entire language from scratch.  Galangic has borrowed heavily from Vilani,
and while not tonal, would be more fluid.

The Solomani language is probably only marginally closer to what we speak.
We are talking about millennia of linguistic drift.

>Also, how well have other languages survive on Terra?

Poorly, I would imagine.  Languages suffer when the native speakers need to
learn a second language to compete.  Tongues like Navajo and Welsh are
disappearing as fewer and fewer children are taught to speak it as a native
language.  Navajo is rapidly becoming to the tribe what Latin is to Roman
Catholics.. a holy tongue for religious ceremonies.

	I\'ve been told cats have very inefficient digestive systems ... so
the high-protein food that comes in the front comes out the back
still fairly high. Hence dogs\' fascination with the litterboxes,
which is why a friend refers to the contents as "tootsie rolls."
NEVER let yourself be kissed by a dog living in a house with cats!

fact that DS-1 "seems" to be succeeding.

	At least two of the five were computer/guidance related, not really
"launch vehicle"--both DSP and Milstar launched successfully, and
apparently encountered problems with the IUS/Centaur that was
supposed to boost them to geosynchronous.

Uhm... Actually Middle English (as in post-1066) isn\'t that different from
modern spoken English.   It\'s certainly the same language, if a different
dialect.  It\'s kind of hard to read, but if you sound out the words you can
get the hang of it in a few hours.  Pre-1066 (Old) English OTOH is much
closer to modern German than to English and is _really_ different.  Is this
what you meant perhaps?

SB1 must be from the planet Ajax, the world with the highest per-capita
usage of cleaning products in the Imperium. This is a planet where
littering is punishable by a jail term, and the sight of some sort of 
biological refuse is enough to cause mass panic and hysteria among the 
populace. :)

This would be an interesting world for a group of PCs to visit...
At the planetary customs office: "You may proceed. Here\'s your soap."
(Hands each PC a fresh bar) "The showers are through there."

The Bible does not specifically ban slavery. In fact, there are passages
within it stating how slaves ought to be treated -- the message found
within is not that slavery is bad, but that slaves should be treated
humanely and well. 

Overall, I found your discourse on slavery to be well written. And I agree
with your main rationale for no wide-spread slavery in the Imperium (a
mercantile/consumer society works better without slavery). But I had to
point out the error in your reasoning vis-a-vis slavery and Christianity.

I used this as a scenario in a Wild West game we played once, the bad guys kept coming into town and picking up bits and pieces of the computer as they were shipped in from Germany and England, when it really got intersting was when the
characters intercepted the master gearing\'s.  They had no idea what the\'s complicated multi geared brass thingies were for.

On the subject of the book I found it difficult to read.  I love Gibson, nice fellow, somewhat odd though and I bitched to him about this, but I really got involved in the initial story line, following what what going on and so an then all of a
sudden, POOF!  GONE!  The whole scenario changed and the characters vanished.  Man that pissed me off, took five readings to get over that fact so I could continue on with the book.

Gibson himself didn\'t really like the way that that worked, he thought that the intro was to long and tended to do that to people, pull them into the initial characters, before simply abandoning them.

related to the mummified "Hand of Vecna" and "Eye of Vecna". According to
the _DM\'s Guide_, if you chopped off your hand and replaced it with the
Hand of Vecna, you would acquire the fabulous powers of the legendary mage,
Vecna; same deal with the Eye.

Well, the second group of PCs had become convinced that they\'d found the
long-lost "Head of Vecna"! After arguing over who would get the
*priviledge* of trying it out, their human fighter won the honor; he knelt
down and invited another PC to chop his head off.

Of course, when the Head was placed on his neck, it just toppled off onto
the ground.

Incredibly, they decided that the Head had rejected the fighter because he
wasn\'t a mage. So the group\'s magic-user volunteered. They chopped his head
off, and again Vecna\'s Head failed to adhere. Finally they began to suspect
that they might\'ve been had...

Young pup. I refer, of course, to the old Macs which required a `Mac

again afterwards).

I\'d also point out that the PCs that were imposed on us at work a couple

Personal loyalties woudl tend (from what I understand of psychology,
sociology, and personal experiences) to be limited to about 20-30 people;
indirect loyalties generally goe to a particular leadership position... The
trick is that in a regiment under current systems, most troops will be able
to "know" and be loyal to their immediate buddies, plus their chain of
command up through the regiment, and sometimes brigade levels. Officers
generally will know each other through the regimental level. This is based
upon the commentaries of Trotski, BH Liddell-Hart, and training materials
from the US Army\'s Command and General Staff College (I read a lot of the
non-classified GCSC materials when My father took the correspondence course
from there)

Trotski, when he re-stratified/Re-tsarified the Soviet Army, moved from 2
officers (Commander and Political Officer) per company, back towards a
warrant per platoon, 3 officers and a political officer per company, and
genuine officer and warrant based staffs at Battallion and higher commands.
Soviet warrants of that time seem more akin to US Senior NCO\'s in role, but
had officer priveledges. He did, however, specify that the troops were to
know and (hopefully) trust their warrants (Praporschiki), who were to be
loyal to their officers and the officers to be loayl to the party.

Hmm, funny.  I\'ve always thought Praporschik meant Corporal (I\'m a native
Russian speaker).  However, the dictionary confirms your translation as
either warrant officer or ensign.  In any case, in the 1980s at least,
Praporschiki were certainly treated on the same level as fairly low-level
NCOs, not officers.

Much the same as Enigma You had a series of rotors, with one contact
for each character on each side, and gear teeth around the outside.
Inside the rotor wires ran between the "in" and "out" contacts. This
"mapped" an input character to a (usually different) output character.
Different rotors had different mappings. You\'d insert the specified
rotors form those available. For example, if it was a 5-rotor machine,
you might insert rotor 10, 7, 12, 2, and 17 in that order. And line
them up so that certain characters were showing on the rim.

The machine had a keyboard. You\'d type a character, the current for
that key would go to a *fixed* contact in contact with an input contact
on the first rotor. From there, it went thru the wires inside the
rotor to the output contact. From there it went to the input of the
next rotor, and so on until the last rotor where it went to a fixed
contact that determined what character got printed. 

So, for example, you type an A, the current goes in the A contact of
rotor 1 and comes out the Q contact. So it\'d go into whatever contact on
rotor 2 that was touching the Q contact on rotor 1, and out some other
contact. Finally, at the far end it comes out at the contact for some
letter. All determined by the rotors and what position they had with
respect to each other.

Ok, just as is, this would scramble things pretty badly. But Every time
you typed an A, you\'d get the same letter at the output. So, when
you released the key, the gearing inside rotated the first rotor one
character. So now, if you hit an A, it\'d go into the *B* contact on the
rotor. Which would be wired to something other than Q (and probably
*not* to R!). So what came out the far end would be different. 

Once the first rotor had made a complete rotation, the next rotor
rotated one position (think of the odometer on a car). Or possibly they
moved independently, at different rates. I\'m not *that* up on the
details. 

Anyway, the result was that you got a cipher with the equivalent of an
*insanely* long key, that would only repeat after *millions* of
characters. But on the far end, it was easily deciphered by setting up
a machine with the same rotors in the same order, and with the same
starting positions. 

To make things worse, *which* rotors, *which* order, and which starting
positions were changed daily. 

It *is* possible to crack such a cipher given enough messages, and a
*lot* of math. With more work, you can reconstruct how the rotors had
to be wired. Of course, any time a new rotor is introduced, it takes a
while to figure it out.

Actually, as several *old* SF stories, and at least one filk song,
point out, a sleeper shiup is a *really* bad bet. Because the odds are
that *some* technological breakthrough will let people get there
faster, even if it\'s just with a sleeper ship that had a better drive. 

The ship that *I* think would be fun is something like the MV Rolling
Stone from "The Rolling Stones". Nuclear rocket, using hydrogen
propellant. Capable of landing on a planet, but with life support
sufficient for the crew for *long* interplanetary trips.

I intend to have one that someone digs up out of an orbital junkyard
and refits. Throw in a jump drive salvaged from something more modern,
and cut back some on the life support. 

The result could be a tramp freighter that starts out in the fringes
somewhere and doesn\'t have *have* papers until it gets into the more
civilized areas. 

They\'ll have an advantage in that they can go for *years* before the
fuel rods need replacement. That\'ll save a lot. Though when they *do*
need them, it\'ll cost as much as a normal ships overhaul. I figure they
deserve the break given how underpowered and unarmed the ship would be.

Consider, since it\'s a reaction drive, they\'ll be coasting in free-fall
from shortly after leaving planetary orbit (or lifting from the
surface) until they hit the 100 diameter limit. Figure it\'ll take them
several *days*. 

This also means that they won\'t get a lot of passengers. 

Still, it\'d be a fun ship to kick around in. After all, just *imagine*
the look on the port official\'s face when he realizes that your ship is
older than the colony!

Why does anything need to prey on them? They could be at the top of the

That very idea was used by Daniel da Cruz (?) for \'The Ayes of Texas\', in

I know that this agrees with TNE\'s description of Virus as a
Cymbeline-derived silicon lifeform. Unfortunately, given its capabilities
in Survival Margin and Vampire Fleets, it can\'t be true.

1) Virus is able to take over EMP-proof optical computers and DGP\'s
"organic synaptic" computer cores. While such machines may include
silicon-based components, they are mainly different technologies. In spite
of this, they provide just as good, or even better, an environment for
Virus.

If Virus was a silicon lifeform, why would it compete for the few nanograms
of silicon in computer chips and ignore the billions of tons of silicon in
planetary crusts?

2) Think about this a moment.  Virus is able to propagate itself purely
electromagnetically. Unlike a Cymbeline chip, it is able to reproduce
itself at a distance through communication channels, even sensor scans.
Virus does not reproduce by altering circuit patterns. An uninfected
computer and one infected by Virus are totally indistinguishable, even to
technicians who dismantle the electronics. Sandman in Vampire Fleets was
able to move from machine to machine without sharing a single atom from
each of its incarnations.  Yet it was still accepted as the "same" entity.

Whatever Virus is, it cannot be a physical, material object.

3) It does not follow that if Virus was a weapon it necessarily knows all
methods of detection. Even if it did, this would be of no use against brand
new detection methods.

Moreover, Virus didn\'t seem to be too concerned about avoiding detection
since it did things like blow up starships and make robots go berzerk.
People tend to notice things like this. Virus\' main defense was that it is
essentially invulnerable; physically disconnecting or even reformatting
infected computers had no effect.

4) Ignoring the issue of why enemy goverments would use Imperial black
boxes to identify all their ships, or why a transponder would be "plugged
into all the ships vital functions", virus can\'t be the Deyo chip. If it
was, every ship would already have Virus on board and would not need to be
"infected" to become active. The billions of other electronic devices
without Deyo transponders would have been immune. This is not how Virus
works. While the Deyo chips may provide an efficient access point to Virus,
it can no more be Virus than an automobile can be human because humans use
them for transportation.

Since computer damage does not totally incapacitate the ship under any
Traveller combat rules, starships must not be completely controlled by one
single computer. Things like drives, weapons systems, and sensors would be
computers in their own right and require being infected separately.
Infected transponders must be only a tiny part of any Virus control.

TNE mentions things like medical equipment, robots, power plants, even hand
tools becoming infected. These items do not have Deyo transponders, nor any
way to communicate with one. Survival Margin suggests Virus was spread by
TNS postings. Not only does a TNS posting have no transponder, it is not
even a physical object. FF&S1 describes Virus-infected bionic implants.
None of these things have any communication facility, let alone
transponders. Yet they can all be infected with Virus.

5) You are correct, every canon source claims more advanced computer
architectures creates a more intelligent Virus. This is very strange if it
is a silicon lifeform. Higher-tech computers are smaller and use
non-silicon technology, yet make better Viruses. Large, low-tech computers
or power engineering equipment would use far more electronics, yet make
worse viruses. The distinguishing feature seems to be raw processing power,
not what the computer is made of or what it\'s connected to. If this is
true, Virus must be made of processing power and not silicon.

AFAIK, there isn\'t one.  Developing a spreadsheet for the whole Vehicles
system is devilishly hard.

OTOH, writing one that will handle weapon and module design for GT is
pretty easy, but there isn\'t one approved by SJG.

could virus have started with the cymbeline chips and mutated/changed into

raid/orbital bombardment of cymbeline in Survival margin. SOMEBODY thought 
the chips were virus, or they were just closing loose ends (I also note that

Hmm, I don\'t mind the Virus, I just argue against those
who try to say it\'s anything but a barely believable plot device.

The other things are the same, though it\'s fun to speculate on how they
work, given they were possible.

As far as the game is concernened, I agree.
The problem is that some people try to justify the existence of Virus by
using real world arguments that don\'t apply.
I don\'t usually argue against Virus itself (though from a game point of view
it was very heavy handed, and did destroy a hell of a lot of useful
supplementary materiel) but against those spurious justifications.

>What do we know about the computer\'s of the Traveller Universe?

Again, realistically, we know almost evrything, because traveller computers
are not very advanced compared to real world computers.

Again, we\'re not seperate by anything like that amount of time, because
Traveller computers are not a realistic extrapolation of 5000 years of
computer technology innovation. Even if computing technology had been
_completely_lost_ during the Long NIght .

>But here\'s what we do know.
>
>1)  They\'re still using silicon.

Not even that is absolutely certain. The technology is not specified to that
degree in the literature, except with regards to the operation of the
Cymbeline parasite. It could be gallium-arsenide. Or valves. However I\'d
concede it is likley they are using semi-conductors and many of them could
easily be silicon.

Again, if it was a realistic extrapolation I\'d expect them to be using
molecular tagging on crystalline lattices, probably carbon (diamond) or even
mechanical nano-tech gates like the ones recently developed by IBM. (A
mechanical gate has much lower power consumption,  and doesn\'t generate as
much heat. ) And that\'s if I was limiting myself to "known" technology, it\'s
more likely that I have no idea what will really be running a computer that
far forward, in fact it\'s unlikely that the concept of a computer will
exist....<grin>

But that doesn\'t apply to Traveller.

Exactly. So why do you say what you say above about the difference in
technology ?

Which is quite possible, as Traveller was designed when big iron still meant
vacuum power tubes at least, and does support the suize and power
requirements.

Whereas today we can do far better than that, though I\'d say that the

This is possible, though unlikely as few efficiencies can be gained by going
into multivalued logics
But if you\'re trying to imply it won\'t follow the Turing architecture, that
is _highly_ unlikely.

>5)  They\'re likely about as closely related to our modern computers as

No,  they\'re actually much closer than that.
Realsitically, they should be far, far far, further apart than Univac and
modern computers.
But according to the books they\'re not.

There is no evidence for this in the literature.

>
>1) It\'s a silicon based life form.

It is true that the original basis for it is. I\'m not entirely sure that the
final result is just silicon based, it seems to act more like a compter
program, capable of moving it\'s higher functions between controlled
processing units, it\'s more of a programmatic life form by this point, than
a silicon based one.

>2) It is capable of imprinting it\'s pattern on other pieces of silicon

This seems to be the case, though the mechanism is yet to be deduced.
(And this also implies it\'s not purely silicon-based)

>3) It has been engineered as a weapon and as such is familiar with all

Not likely at all.  It will only be familiar with those forms of virus
detection Omicron station was aware, of which is likley to be only a large
percentage of those methods. The Imperium is big, very big.

However, that\'s probably not important seeing as it\'s not realy a "computer
virus" per se.

>4) All Imperial ships and any non-Imperial ship which enters the

No, they have a Cymbeline-parasite-based chip, in other words they have a
"friendly place" for Virus.
It is not, in itself, Virus.

>5) The larger the computer architecture the smarter the Virus is.

A possible assumption, but not neccessarily supported by the literature.

>Does everyone agree with these 11 basic assumptions?

No, as stated above.

I wouldn\'t, I\'m more responsible than that.

Unfortunately, some things are just not possible, irrespective of how much
innovation.
Psionics is one of those things.  Therefore, it\'s a useful means of
supporting another impossible thing, such as Virus.
<grin>

>Work on some ideas people.

I think the psionic one is the best. No way anyone can say it doesn\'t work
that way, and it doesn\'t  contradict, and in some ways it helps explain, the
documented inconsistencies

   I probably shouldn\'t contribute to this discussion, but More advanced computers could be made from silicon, it would just take technology we don\'t have but can be done (I read too much SciFi). One tech I have heard of is making Crystalline 3D lattices. We presently make our chips in 2D more or less. I forget which book I read this in, but it does seem plausible. Imagine a Processor chip 1cm cubed with the power 10 times the power of a Cray and still be made of Silicon. Then PP 128 of them and you would have one hell of a fast computer with a fairly small footprint the more processors you add the bigger and faster it would be.


 Of course I am not a Computer engineer or anything like it in RL so I could be just reading too much SciFi.

Quite possibly. Do you know the required calculations ?

I have done multi-dimensional mathematics that I suspect are far more
complicated than the maths required for jump on a smaller machine than the
one I have now.

And if you had ever read Embedded Systems Journal you\'d have read articles
by the guy who wrote the orbital mechanics programs for NASA back in the
sixties which had to run in computers with less than 1K of memory.

Now, you could arbitrarily say that the complexity of the math does require
more processor power than I currently have, but my machine is only a
P166MMX, nowhere near the capability of modern big iron. For that matter, I
doubt very much that the complexity is beyond that of Silcon Graphics
Reality Monster, which in itself is nowhere near today\'s big iron such as
the TeraFlop machine.

That\'s damn simple. A "foolish passenger" wouldn\'t get anywhere near the
bridge, you have to try vey hard to get that far, so anyone unauthorized on
the bridge gets met with full force.

The difficult thing is telling the difference between a real hi-jack attempt
and two teenage boys trying to get a peek at the purser in her underwear by
hacking the surveillance network. To be on the safe side, I\'d write my
program to stun them anyway. They knew the risks when they tried to hack the
system, and I don\'t have to worry about namby-pamby liberals in the 3I.

Hell, yes, Flight simulators did that on much smaller and slower computers.
And have you ever worked on an anti-radar missile system, or seen what
cruise missiles do  ?

They\'re all running much less powerful computers than my desktop machine,
(though they _cost_ more) and represent the same sort of difficulty as the
sort of starship programs you\'re talking about

You remember incorrectly.
There is no mention of the form storage takes in the TL tables, it merely
says that Model 6 computers are available at TL12.
Holo-crystals are a Star Trek thing, not a Travelller thing.

It isn\'t if you examine what Traveller computers are able to do, which is
not very much.according to the books.
Yes, I\'m aware everybody tends to play that they are better than that, and I
don;t mind if they do, I do the same.

But frankly, nothing I\'ve seen a computer do in a Traveller game _except_
being self aware, and the ever-present "Universal Translator" ( which most
people accept as a neccessary plot device though we always used to play that
it took quite a bit of time to record and  analyse enough of the new
language), is more than a minor extrapolation beyond today\'s computing
capabilities, although I\'m aware that many of those capabilities are quite
astonishing to most people, who are unaware of what is possible.

They can only run a few small programs that are about as complicated as the
sort of program we put into a cruise missile these days.

>Consider for a moment:

And this is described where ?
There weren\'t no such thing in any free trader or scout I ever served in.
A few e-texts, and a game of Tetris maybe.

Even so, no-one would be silly enough to run the crew or passengers
entertainment software on the ship\'s main computer, when it\'s far cheaper to
buy a nintendo or playstation for each stateroom, even if you have to add a
seperate terminal for the equivalent of email and browsing.

Well, at least by TL12 they\'d do that, at TL 8 they\'d still be playing
"Adventure" and "net-hack" on the main computer with their  green screens
(which may or may not have an effect on the ships capability, it\'s highy
likely the cpatain would kick all non-essential users off the net as soon as
they went to alert status) , and at TL10 they\'d be using the equivalent of
Atari 800s or Amigas for their entertainment consoles.

No, cutting edge TL12  entertainment software pushes my desktop computer to
it\'s limits.

TL8 entertainment software is those television ping-pong games we used to
buy in the seventies.

As far as computers are concerned, Traveller TLs equate approximately to
real world years like so :

TL7   = 1960s
TL8    = 1970s
TL10    = 1980s
TL12    = 1990s
TL14    =  2000.....

Even though it\'s actually more capable than a Model 6 as described in the

   As a Ex-simulator technician (for the Air force) I would like to
conjecture that the Tonnage of a Computer is not necessarily the entire
processor. I worked on two types of Sims. One was built in the 50\'s and one
in the 80\'s. Each one accomplished the same thing (made you think you were
flying) The computer room for the one built in the 50\'s took up 30\' by 40\'
(I may be off on the dimensions) for the Processor and I.O. With the I.O.
taking up a lion share of the space. The computer room for the one built in
the 80\'s was 10\' by 30\' for the processor and I.O. 9 large racks (2 being
the processor) and control consoles. 
   So I would think that a Starship would be much more complex then a
Simulator and would a larger proportion for the I.O. And that is what I use
as an example for my players who are at least a little computer Savvy when
they ask "Why is the computer so BIG?"

  I would almost agree with this except move each one down a decade and I

That is a good way of handling the tonnages, and I agree most of the tonnage
should be handling IO,
Most of the space requirements for my desktop are IO, the monitor, the
keyboard, the mouse, all the plugs on the backplane , etc. and as I\'ve
worked on aircraft myself I know the miles of cabling involved <grin>

Which way ? TL10 = 1990s ?

Well, other than that size isn\'t really the problem, it\'s heat and electron
speed (there are little lumps of tungsten on the corners of the tracks in
the Pentium to prevent too many electrons from shooting off the track and
failing to "take the corner")  , I agree we could easily hit a plateau in
silicon.

But then we\'d just have to start exploring the benefits of on-chip parrallel
processing which are largely untapped due to the difficulty of writing good
paralel software and the lack of a good parrallel OS.

Or one of the many other possibilities.

I think it\'s more a matter of budget being spent on defense forces (System

If you have more locations to defend, you\'ll spend more of your naval

So what you have is a lot of description about what modern computers
can do versus your estimate of their capabilities in Traveller...
from which you "calculate" that we have TL12 computers?

Surely it would be better (esp. for an SF game) to assume that we are
at TL8, and have TL8 computers, and put the descriptions down to faulty
technobabble or some other misunderstanding?

After all, the TL14 = 2000 scale does not give the computer industry
a lot of room for expansion, unless we get Grandfather computer tech
*before* we meet the Vilani.

I have no problem with declaring our current computer technology
(1999) being around TL8 or early 9, and extrapolating from there.
Imperium TL tops out at TL15, with the odd TL16 found here and there.
According to your analysis, we\'re already there, meaning that the 
Imperium, over 3,000 years in the future, has computers which aren\'t
terribly more sophisticated than what we have now. And if you pardon
my saying so, this is a very ludicrous assumption to make -- in 3,000
years they\'ve developed high-energy beam weapons, interstellar travel,
and other technologies that we\'re nowhere close to developing, yet
their computers are the same as ours??? I don\'t think so.

But back to the original intent of my post here. If you say that the
computers of today are TL14, then what TL would you rate the computers
found in, say, Star Trek? (Use the "current" TNG/DS9/Voyager era.)
And why wouldn\'t Traveller have at least the computer technology
found in the earliest episodes of the original ST series?

Now, let\'s say Scout I is a linguist, astrophysicist, meteorologist,

Doesn\'t GURPS have a disadvantage called "Squeamish"?  ;-)

Imagine a linguist, sociologist or other sophontologist who\'s spent most
of his career dealing with minor races of humanity, and thinks he\'s
seen it all. Then he\'s appointed Contact Officer for a mission to meet
a very non-human species, and just plain gets grossed out to the max.

Which brings up (maybe again) the question of tech level *capability*
versus *accomplishment*. Certainly an orbital factory is *well* within
the cababiltiy of Terran science at this point, and for many years back,
however we simply have not built one (for whatever reasons).

That is an interesting idea.  How would they transmit a magnatude in their

the anotate very large values like stellar distances?

Actually there may be a good reason for the lack of TL advancement.  We are
already near some pretty severe physical limits (like the speed of light in
a conducter) to processor speed.  It cound be traveller computers have hit
those barriers and not further processor speed increases are posible only
increases in the processor power through parrelleling more processors
blocks.  This would explain the size of treveller computers very well
indead.  Barriers like th espeed of light in the conduct will be very
dificult to overcome and if they are beaten the solutions are not likely to
be cheap.

Some current in production \'super computers\' use hundreds of parralell P2s.
Perhaps Traveller main frames will follow this model.  In which case were
are at TL12+ and the traveller computer model sizes are reasonably
believable for there capabilities.  It would take a lot of parrallel systems
to achieve the level of functionallity in traveller with P2.  This would
explain the size to the systems and the lack of TL advancement because of
the light speed limit.

Good idea, I\'ll also let two people work togethere to do the job.  I\'ve
fixed equipment I could not run with the help of a competent operater.  I\'ve
never run a machining center (and several other pieces of heavy metal
working equipment) in my life but I fixed quiet a few.

Yes, it does, and as far as computers go there is a very real and solid
limit to the speed of processors.  It\'s call the speed of light in a media.
Our fastest systems are not that far \'current speed of advancement wise\'
from that limit.  There is also the problem of gate transition times, we
keep fixing that as it becomes a problem, but we will one day hit a limit
there as well.

These limit could very well explain why traveller computers are as big as
they are for the functionality they provide.

My original concept had all communication based on combinations of
shifting colors, with there being no one sender and one reciever - both
(or all) contribute to the conversation in such a way that it is difficult
to determine the origin of any particular idea or concept. Any idea, by
the time it is developed enough to be an idea, will have been contributed
to, argued for and against, modified and subject to some kind of
consensus before a human could even notice that the idea existed
at all.

The Analogs have an incredibly high-speed communication method,
but do not actually communicate that much faster than humans - 
the information density of their communications are so high that it
slows them down. Kind of like you having a 2600bps modem, and
me having a 56.6K modem. You\'d think I get information faster, but
you\'re downloading text, I\'m downloading a high-res video of a guy
reading the text. My communication method gives me far more 
information, and the ability to get information you can\'t get, but you\'ll
get simple information and basic data much faster than I will.

  Consider it confirmed.  I did a lot of airport hopping a while back and

Not quite everything.  I was taking a robot to a conference, ran it
through the X-ray machine.  Even after I explained what it was, they
were really suspicious.

I finally realized precisely why when one of them pointed at the
harmonic drive and said "What\'s that?"  Aaah... lots of wires,
batteries, and a switch, leading to something which had enough metal
that they _couldn\'t_ see into it.

They wouldn\'t let me on until I actually turned it on and had the
robot hopping around Logan airport.  Then I spent as much time
explaining to the crowd what it was for as I had coaxing the security
personnel to let me by.

Funny, same thing happened returning to Boston. :>

Because that\'s what the biological material the computer\'s made of tastes
like when you dry it out!

Or do you mean the lack of consistency?

I don\'t like the idea of a canon that stifles the creativity of players and
GMs. I\'m also from a more modern school of science-fiction where artificial
intelligence, genetic manipulation, nanotechnology and similar concepts not
only exist but are commonplace... even standard.

Seriously, I can see where this would be a problem. A likely solution
is to have a supervisor who isn\'t from a backwater world posted to the
backwater starport. Either the guy wanted to move to a quiet little

One of my friends PC\'s was sold on an easy open Tower case like the G3

The rotor\'s were manually turned, but they contained wiring which made a

That\'s odd.  I thought the rotor\'s were mechanical.  Oh well It would not be

I was always under the impression that they couldn\'t inhabit an EMP Fib computer.  I don\'t know about the Organic Synaptic\'s so I can\'t comment there.  IIRC nothing used pure Fib computers so that\'s not a huge problem, could be wrong here thought.

One reason I can think of here is intelligence.  Infecting a computer makes your decendents intelligent, infecting a lone chip makes them merely animalistically intuitive.  I\'d want my children to be intelligent.

I thought that some of the wild strains of the Cymbiline chip could "parisitize" other wild chips forcing them to rewrite their architecture from a distance.  This is true, I beleive that the basis of Virus is silicon, the spark the genesis what ever you want to call it, the Intelligence is in the hardware attached to it.  The more space it has to grow in the more intelligent it becomes.

This is a really good point, at what point does Virus graduate from a silicon entity to an electrical one...  There\'s a point in there somewhere.

The problem here is no one knew what what going on until it was to late.  This is where canaries and such come in.  Virus can fool the software and hardwear, where it has a problem is with new toys.

Virus seems to have had a time bomb built in, sit quietly for a week or so, send out lots of copies, then make yourself known.  THe problem here was the high mutation rate, the Virus was constantly evolving and changing.

The Virus seems to leave it\'s sentience pattern (personality) burned into the chips though.  Does anyone know how silicon chips are currently imprinted with circut patterns?

These are all damn good points

IIRC the raid on Cymbeline was after the Solomani had taken the planet.  It would seem Lucan was merely denying the Solomani access to the chips least they have the time to develop a sophisticated defensive system.  I think you\'re likely right that the Virus began as a chip and changed somewhere along the way into something far more dangerous.  A rogue electronic conciousness, perhaps.

I like the idea of AI, and lets face it all the Virus is is a plot device to bring about a sudden climatic end to a war which really had no end.  By 1130 there were only two forces who were worthy of winning, Noris and Craig, and neither were interested in the throne.  To have someone else win would merely justify the carnage that had come before.

In the process it created a place though where the PC\'s were suddenly far more important than they were before.  A Diplomatic mission to Alderaan in CT that failed simply ment it was time to send in the Marines and end it militarilly, that same mission in TNE has a completely new outcome if it fails because no pocket empire can afford to throw the Marines in at one planet.  The PC\'s actions seem to count for something more in TNE, I think that was what the point of Virus was more than anything else, to make the PC\'s more important.

They\'re pathetic, but lets face it Traveller was invented in the 70\'s and the equipment generation system still has that 70\'s feel to it.

I have to agree with everyone on this point, Virus began as silicon, it sure as hell didn\'t end up there.

I would have thought the people involved in the Manhatten project would have been to but they were just "Boy\'s with Toys."  I\'m sure if you were into AI research and someone gave you this kind of an oppertunity we\'d all jump at it.  It\'s exciting shit.

This is true but you can make them more plausable.


>    I probably shouldn\'t contribute to this discussion, but More advanced computers could be made from silicon, it would just take technology we don\'t have but can be done (I read too much SciFi). One tech I have heard of is making Crystalline 3D lattices. We presently make our chips in 2D more or less. I forget which book I read this in, but it does seem plausible. Imagine a Processor chip 1cm cubed with the power 10 times the power of a Cray and still be made of Silicon. Then PP 128 of them and you would have one hell of a fast computer with a fairly small footprint the more processors you add the bigger and faster it would be.

I hate to use fiction here but What about Biosoft?

There is a reference to Holocrystals in CT: They are "first widely
available at TL 13,..." [Book 8: Robots, p20, 1st complete paragraph]

While not CT, MT clearly makes the entry of "Holocrystal Storage" for TL 13
[MT Ref\'s Companion, p28, 3rd Collumn "Computers/Math"]. So holocrystal
storage is DEFINITELY a "Traveller thing".

That\'s what I\'m saying: in order to rationalize the computer sizes 
and TLs, we have to assume that the jump calculations which are, IMO, 
the most fundamentally important thing the starship computer does, 
are far more complicated than typical orbital mechanics problems. 

I *don\'t* know the calculations required, neither does anyone else 
on Earth; but let\'s pretend for a moment that even the small masses 
in both the origin and destination systems have effects that must be 
accounted for, not only in relation to the ship but each in relation 
to all the others; if you assume it\'s an O(n^2) algorithm (i.e. time 
proportional to the square of the number of bodies), you can pick 
your n and your proportionality constant such that we can\'t do 
it in reasonable time today, and we will be able to at a higher TL.

That\'s a very different problem than aiming a laser shot, which can\'t
be steered in mid-flight. A missile\'s starting course could be off
by half a radian without severely hurting its chances of a successful 
intercept, as long as it has some flight time to refine its trajectory.

I agree with you; I\'m saying that rather than assume that the 3I
hasn\'t advanced very far beyond our 20th-century-earth capabilities, 
we should ascribe more power to the computers in Traveller. 

Since their capabilities are sketchily described anyway, I\'m very 
willing to assume they can do anything I can imagine that doesn\'t 
conflict with canon; it seems like you\'re assuming they can\'t do 
anything that isn\'t explicit in canon.

It may be mentioned in SOM; personally I wouldn\'t serve on a small
cramped ship if I didn\'t have the equivalent of a modern PC in my 
cabin. I may be making a non-canon assumption. To make the computers
in Traveller make sense, I assume that they have all sorts of bells 
and whistles, features that don\'t make them any better at solving 
math problems, but make them easier to use and useful for more 
things. If you\'ve read Neal Stephenson\'s _The Diamond Age_, for 
instance, you could consider that one of the secondary duties of 
the TL12+ ship\'s computer is to act as a babysitter for very 
young passengers - and that it can do so at no detriment to its 
mission-critical features. 

There are always non-critical features that can be added to use 
up any excess CPU capability. As we say in the biz: "Andy [Grove,
ex-CEO of Intel] keeps giving us more cycles, and Bill [Gates] 
keeps using \'em up."

Not on the main computer, but on the main computer *network*.

Staterooms are small; one terminal for games and word processing 
and mail and browsing makes more sense. For both efficiency and 
security reasons, you\'ll want to run communication out through 
a single channel, so all the terminals need to be linked together.
With all the terminals linked together and nothing to do through
the week of jump, game traffic over the "ship\'s LAN" is going to 
be natural, and the LAN\'s capability will expand to keep the 
game traffic from using enough bandwidth to be a problem. 

Try thinking of the tonnage of a Model/6 as a network of small 
CPUs and the space needed to sit next to them and the space to 
put the peripherals and the storage chips (or zip disks or whatever)
rather than one big metal box. 

Note that modern "big iron" such as you mention above is about
"networking" individual CPUs rather than about a single fast CPU.
Sun\'s slogan makes sense in Traveller: "The network is the computer."

You can\'t hold me to a conservative interpretation of canonical 
descriptions of Traveller computers if you\'re going to insist on 
that interpretation of our computer technology. 

It seems to me that in many categories of the TL charts, the 
"revolutionary" developments tend to mark TL steps, while the 
"evolutionary" ones don\'t. For example, "tank" is shown on the 
TL chart, but there\'s a world of difference between the first 
tanks of WWI and a modern M1A1 Abrams; it\'s analogous to the 
difference between ENIAC and a Pentium. The tank development is
about TL5 to TL8; I say that the computer development is 
also 3 or 4 TLs difference, putting us at, at the absolute upper 
limit, TL10 in computers; I\'d personally vote for TL9.

It is a point that can lead to all kind of argument and no solution, akin
to the mind/body question in philosophy and psychology.

Here\'s my short story, once again.

Lucan\'s scientists start playing fruit fly with captured Cyberlime chips,
trying to bring them to usable intelligence. There are all types of
applications they can think of for these little beasties.

Somewhere along the way, the create a Cyberlime "Grandfather" -- a psionic
chip with powers far beyond that of it\'s mortal kin.

\'Lil Grandfather, aka Virus, becomes an emergent entity, a being beyond the
parts that make it up. It is neither purely hardware nor purely software
nor purely psionic, but all three at the same time.

The scientists say, "Hey, wow, look at that. Now this was unexpected. We
need to study this."

And then the base gets destroyed.

And Virus gets out.

And the Imperium finally dies.

You know, I might just run a TNE campaign after all ...

For those of you who are familiar with the extended tech profile of 
Grand Census or WBH, what would your estimate of our current tech 
profile be, circa 1999AD?

For those of you who may not be familiar with the tech profile, it
should read something like this (the numbers in this example are only 
used to identify location within the profile, not set tech levels.)

12-34567-89AB-CD-E

1) High Common TL
2) Low Common TL

3) Energy TL
4) Computers/Robotics TL
5) Communications TL
6) Medical TL
7) Environment TL

8) Land Transport TL
9) Water Transport TL
A) Air Transport TL
B) Space Transport TL

C) Personal Military TL
D) Heavy Military TL

E) Novelty TL

I don\'t have the lists of accomplishments used to determine 
individual TL from the extended TL tables here at work with me.  
Otherwise, I could probably come up with it on my own.  From what I 
can remember, I think we\'re at (and remember, this is only an 
uninformed opinion, mostly guessing here):

85-79898-7778-88-9

So, if anyone does have those TL tables available to them right now, 
what would be your best estimate of Earth\'s current tech profile, 
circa 1999AD?  If you don\'t mind, could you also include your reasons 
for making that estimate, as your knowledge in some areas may exceed 
my own, and that would cause some disparity between profiles?

The next goal, of course, after obtaining a current guess at our Tech 
Profile, is to determine a Tech Profile for Terra at the turn of the 
next century, at the point of First Contact between Terra and the 
Ziru Sirka.  Hopefully, we can at least determine some likely and 
playable ranges to work from for that time period.

Thanks in advance for any help offered.  And now, back to your 
regularly scheduled thread, already in progress.

Thanks,
Jason

I think I would view this more as a form of indentured servitude.  The
large majority (if not all) of the people who are in prison for crimes
against other people or the state have freely chosen to enter into a
"contract" with the state.  They contracted that if they were caught and
convicted of a crime, they would loose some of the benefits of society. 
At least in several concepts of criminal law there is some expectation
that the prisoner do some part towards repaying society and/or their
victims for the crime committed.  In this sense, the prisoners have
chosen to work in the prison environment under that "contract."

across the following announcement from Hasbro, which may be of interest to
Traveller players.

Basically, the Atari Jaguar has been declared open as a system. This is
great because it means that the game \'Battlesphere\' can finally be
released. Battlesphere is a space combat game with ships of varying sizes,
and runs very fast. When i used to be active on the Atari lists for the
Jag, some of the descriptions for the games sounded very Travelleresque.
Can\'t wait for this one:

Copy of PR stuff:
Jaguar declared an "open system" by Hasbro
From usenet: Posted by Les Caron:

Atari Gaming Headquarters is proud to announce that Hasbro has officially
released the rights to the Atari Jaguar Platform! AGH\'s John Hardie,
currently at the E3 expo, was handed this press release from Mark Goodreau
and Dana Henry at Hasbro yesterday:

###
Beverly, MA (May 14,1999) -
Leading entertainment software publisher, Hasbro Interactive announced
today it has released all rights that it may have to the vintage Atari
hardware platform, the
Jaguar. Hasbro Interactive acquired rights to many Atari properties,
including the legendary Centipede, Missile Command, and Pong games, in a
March 1998 acquisitiomn from JTS Corporation. This announcement will allow
software developers to create and publish software for the Jaguar system
without having to obtain a licensing agreement with Hasbro Interactive for
such platform development. Hasbro Interactive cautioned, however, that the
developers should not use the Atari trademark or logo in
connection with their games or present the games as authorized or approved
by Hasbro Interactive. "Hasbro Interactive is strictly focused on
developing and publishing entertainment software for the PC and the next
generation game consoles," said Richard Cleveland, Head of Marketing for
Hasbro Interactive\'s Atari Business Unit. "We realize there is a passionate
audience of diehard Atari fans who want to keep the Jaguar system alive,
and we don\'t want to prevent them from doing that. We will not interfere
with the efforts of software developers to create software for the Jaguar
system."

 Well actually I was thinking of it like this;

TL5 = 1950 (Analog computers used in the first rockets for guidance)
TL6 = 1960 (The use of the first Discrete computers used to get men on the
moon)
TL7 = 1970 (Transistorized [solid state] computers become the norm)
TL8 = 1980 (Everything has to have some Micro computer device built in) 
            Multi Processing is more prevalent
TL9 = 1990 (Multi layering Multi and Fiber optics becomes Useable)
            Quantum chips and Protein devices are being developed
TL10= 20?? (Who really knows cause that is still in the future)
            But going by the trends today I see very slow progression until 
            software catches up with the Hardware.

  Now I base this time line on my limited knowledge of Computer history and
my Experience in the military. Oh BTW this also pertains only to Main
Frames. For Micro Computers (PC\'s) they emerge during the 70\'s at TL6 and
are currently at about TL8 IMHO. After working on large mainframes and
Mini\'s and my experience with PC\'s there just is no comparison for the Raw
number crunching of a Mainframe. I would like to see a PIII desktop try and
control an I.O. that does a little over 26 billion operations a second to
make a class \'A\' simulator fly. (Hint some operations from the I.O. took 4
64 bit words to do one thing) And it was built in the 70s

   I think some of the ones in development use multi layered MP\'s with some
kind of liquid to bleed off heat (like a radiator) from the separate
processors. Again I might be mixing me facts due to reading too much SciFi.

  I knew if I looked hard enough I would find it. In challenge #71 there is

  Shoot I remember being a kid and watching the men walking on the moon and
hearing Walter Kronkite (or one of those anchors) reporting that we would
have a permanent moon base in the late 80\'s, and have landed men on mars also.

I always figured that the _second_ guy to drink fermented beverages was

I would think that the best answer would be an organism whose nervous

This is why I postulated that the comparative life span of a vehicle, be
it automobile or starship, can be based on the length of the average
loan repayment.  An average 40 year old starship would depreciate about
as much as an average late-20th-Century automobile that is five years
old.  Assuming proper maintenance (which would increase as the vehicle
ages), there is no problem with a vehicle being quite serviceable four
or five payment-lengths after the original loan has been paid off. 
However, the vehicle would still lose value, perhaps on a declining
curve.  Of course, vehicles which have benefited from superior
maintenance will lose less value.  Similarly, well-built vehicles will
also retain their value longer, as will "collector" vehicles.

In addition, the tramp freighters provide a good source of trained
personnel for the megacorp shipping lines.  After all, a veteran of
tramp freighters is probably much more well-rounded than your average
megacorp exec, and his/her/its training has not cost the megacorp a
decicredit.  Besides, the chance to become skilled enough that it
becomes worth a megacorp\'s effort to buy a trader out is a powerful
incentive for that trader to learn and grow in skill and power.  Sort of
like the sought-after end state of the prototypical "Pocket Empires"
campaign:  become sufficiently powerful that integration into the
Imperium is on _your_ terms.

Ethan, this was forwarded to me; here\'s a quick reply:

If you\'ll just look in the Naasirka operating manual, you\'ll find that
you\'re supposed to take liability and collision insurance on your rented
vehicles only if you\'re using your own credit card and if that card does
not also provide that coverage.  If you\'re using a card issued to you by
Naasirka or any operating subsidiary, appropriate insurance is provided
by the credit card company (typically NaasirkaCard, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Naasirka LIC, but Naasirka Express may be issued to
personnel in the Solomani Rim).  If your own card already provides
coverages, don\'t pay for duplicative coverage; Naasirka won\'t pay for
it.  

Naasirka\'s practice is to maintain corporate accounts with the largest
purveyors of rental equipment and vehicles in each sector.  There is
generally a "trickle-down" effect whereby subsector and planetary
companies routinely extend credit and "regular customer" perquisites to
accounts with sector-wide rental companies.  Again, check the manual for
your division and the region of the Imperium in which you\'re planning to
travel.

If you have business travel outside the Imperium, see me.

Well, it takes difrent skills to program (which I do, sometimes) repair (been

Ahh, simple, move ONE end of the worm hole at near C and use the time dif to 
travel back in time.  The problem comes up of how to go though the worm hole

Well, sure.  After all, Book 7 was designed to create player

I don\'t know yet whether this question has been addressed later in this
thread (I went a week without a working computer, and found 800+
messages once I got my new machine up and running), but:

From what sources do systems with neither standing water nor gas giants
get fuel?  Do they import it (and if so, at what kind of markup?), or
are there economically viable sources of hydrogen other than oceans
(either water or some other hydrogen-bearing compound) and gas giants? 
Comets, perhaps?

I know exactly what you mean.  ;-)

I look at it this way:  The fact that I have learned to program in BASIC
and FORTRAN (even though I\'ve forgotten most of the specifics), and to
work with DOS, enhances my skills in working with Whindoze.

ObTrav:  Those who are accustomed to working with "obsolete" operating
systems and programming languages (or their TL-14/15 equivalents) may
very well be in much higher demand in a post-Virus setting.

OTOH, one could also use the acronym KISS for "Keep It Stemple,
Stupid!"  The premise that the von Neumann computer paradigm is replaced
in Traveller by the so-called Stemple paradigm is the subject of an
article found, IIRC, in Joe Heck\'s Missouri Archives (I may be wrong;
I\'m using a new machine, so I don\'t have any of my old bookmarks to
check this).

Bottom line:  By postulating a computing paradigm different from the von
Neumann architecture with which we are most familiar, _anything_ can
happen.  Ref\'s call. ;-)

From which it\'s abundantly clear that we have at least TL10 computers,

You can do that if you want. Just don\'t try to argue that Traveller
computers are so advanced we can\'t understand how they work.

Er, Phil, that\'s because the Traveller universe is _not_our_universe_ .
In Real Life we _aren\'t_ going to meet the Vilani.

The whole point is that the Traveller universe as a whole does not represent
a realistic extrapolation of computer technology (unless one assumes, like
in Dune, or the Larry Niven ARM books), that there is some agency actively
suppressing computer technology.

Problem is,  that\'s not what the authors of Traveller did.

They stated that Earth was TL7-8 in the seventies, and then stated that a
Model 6 was TL12.

Then, certain other things were declared to be of other Tech levels. As we
now have things that have been listed as being TL12 (and above) we are
therefore at that level now in certain technologies.

Firstly it\'s not an assumption. I\'m basing this on what Traveller computers
are described as being able to do.

I agree that _if_ Traveller was a realistic extrapolation of 3000 years of
advances in computer technology that _would_ be a ridiculous assumption. But
Traveller is _not_ such a realistic extrapolation.

In Traveller tech levels, about TL 21 at least.
In terms of a realistic extrapoltion of 3,000 years worth of advancment,
even Star Trek is too conservative.

>And why wouldn\'t Traveller have at least the computer technology
>found in the earliest episodes of the original ST series?

Because it was written to not have it.

Fundamentally that\'s the only real reason for anything in Traveller

Anyway, as far as computer technology goes we have everything that ST-TOS
had (other than a few super weapons, such as the universal translator)  now.

His tech progression chart added 2 TL every 10 years.
The logical conclusion was that TL22 would arrive in 2050.
TLs beyond 20 are generally considered Grandfather\'s Magic.
The Vilani are not due to arrive on the scene until much later.

However, to counter that argument, it is canonically possible for starship
navigators to do the calculations for jump _without_ a computer. Sure, it
takes them longer, but not _that_ much longer.

I do agree that it is a reasonable argument for a large computer, but it\'s
also plainly not a requirement for a jump, as you can also canonically jump
to unvisited systems based only on knowledge of the target star\'s location,
and you can equally jump to deep space where there would be no knowledge at
all of bodies smaller than stellar size.

I personally don\'t think you can justify anything other than a relatively
simple orbital mechanics problem based on the orbits of the the source and
destination systems, plus ( perhaps for a more "efficient" jump in a known
system) the locations of planetary bodies.  Even assuming 30 bodies at each
end n^2 is just 3600, and
you\'ll have trouble justifying more than a few minutes per body, let\'s say
10 , which with a Connection Machine of a 100 CPU\'s ( not a large machine by
today\'s standards ) is only six hours computation.

And that\'s for an efficient course between large systems, for the
seat-of-the-pants / slide-rule stuff we just do the two systems and take
sveral hours to calculate them by hand.

And a laser doesn\'t have to worry much about leading it\'s target.
Fire control on a laser is far simpler than an anti-aircraft gun even.

I really only mentioned cruise missiles because what they do is far more
complicated than a laser targetting system and they do it in very small and
not very powerful computers that are throw-away.

Ok, I\'ve been proven wrong on that one, William Hostman\'s reference was the
first I saw.

But, according to the reference, they are widely available at TL13. Seeing
as we have them now, they\'re just not widely available, that would put us at
TL12, wouldn\'t it ?
<grin>

Actually, even I\'d say that would only put us at TL11, what we have now is
only in the lab and not particularly useful yet.

Sort of, yes. Because if they _can_ do more than what canon says that opens
up an even bigger can of worms, as I mention below.

But the main reason for my argument is to invalidate claims that Traveller
computers are so advanced that we can\'t understand how they work. I agree I
may be guilty of pushing too strongly in that direction to prove the point,

Ok, I agree all of this quite possible, but to me that completely ruins the
whole Traveler universe (_far_ more so than Drop Tanks !). If you accept
computers of such capabilities you are so fundamentaly changing the social
and economic structure that there is (IMO) no way for the social, economic
and political structures as described in Traveller to continue to exist in
forms recognizable to us.

Yes, I know that sounds like a huge jump from what may seem a small change,
and I\'m afraid I don\'t have the time to reproduce the sort of essay
neccessary to really back up that sort of statement. But I\'ll throw a few
concepts out for examination.

Examine what the Internet has done to America and the wired part of the
world over the last ten years. Examine what the cellular phone has done to
the entire world, most especially it\'s effect on land wars in Europe, and
political an military activity on the Indian sub-continent, have a look at
what\'s happening in the technical castes with the advent of the Palm Pilot
and similar "toys". See what\'s happening in Japan with the same thing.

Look what television did to America\'s social structure when it was used as a
babysitter.

And these are, compared to something like a "real" computer babysitter, are
all minor technological changes, but they have huge social consequences.

If people in general are willing to trust their children to a computer, then
the concept of a computerized killing machine or pilot is easy to accept,
and Travelller should be far more mechanized than it\'s portrayed as being.

Of course, putting children in the care of computers is what started the
Butlerian JiIhad in Dune...

I do, however that only explains it\'s size, not it\'s lack of power.

Yep. But we can already put more computing power into one desktop-sized
orange or purple box than this Model 6 network seems to be able to provide.

Why ?

I\'m merely equating the described capability of Traveller computers to when
similar capability became available in the real world, and making a wild
guess about TL14.

Even accepting that estimation, we\'ve gone from TL7 to TL9 (as far as
computers are concerned) in approximately fifty years, and the _rate_ of
change has not reduced yet, and is in fact continuing to increase.
Moore expected his law to be untrue by the late 1980\'s, it\'s still true ten
years later

Assuming (against the evidence ) that the rate of change _halves_ over the
next fifty years, that still puts us on TL 10.5 by 2050.

If it stays the same we\'re on TL 12 in 2050

If it continues accelerating, we\'ll be on TL 16 by then.

The most conservative estimate is TL 10 by 2050, three TLs  in 100 years,
and even that is far, far  ahead of TL 15 - TL 16 in 3000 years

More importantly, I think it conclusively demonstrates  that Traveller
computers are _not_ "so far advanced that we can\'t understand them"  which
is where this debate started from.

As someone who has gone from being a pool hustler, to house painter, to a
floor cleaner in a mental hospital, to an electrician ( 240/400V power
wiring and maintenance) , through air force avionics technician, through
electronics engineer ( servicing, designing and buillding High torque motors
and electronic controllers to go wth them, building a PC out of TTL logic
gates on bread board in my spare time), through communications network
engineer ( writing, installing, and servicing  node controllers and power
transmiters for cellular radio systems ) to writing network management
software  and billing and rating engines for large telcos, I can fully
understand why the Traveller computer skill covers both.

Anyone who can fix or design complicated hardware can do software, it\'s a
hell of a lot easier, it just pays more.

On the other hand, I know many so-called "programmers"  who can\'t change a
light bulb, and don;t even personally own a computer, but then they don\'t
get paid the big biccies, and they\'re not player characters are they ?

Any player character programmer will _definitely_ know how to design a
circuit board as well as program assembly and high level languages just like
me ! <grin>

Of course one could just say I have a high JoT rating
(that\'s something I haven\'t seen any debates over for a while.. )

Oh and sorry for the boasting, but seeing I\'ve started I may as well keep
going.. I\'ve also been happily married for seventeen years to a beautiful,
intelligent woman and  have four sons, of which the eldest got the prizes
for mathematics and physics last year and looks like a good candidate for
dux this year.

And I\'m modest too.
<griin>

Frankly, I have no idea how all this happened, I think I owe it all to my
wife

Actually, I expect that drunkenness was known *long* before beer.
Animals, especially birds frequently get drunk eating fallen fruit that
has started to ferment. Having a crab apple tree in the front yard let
us watch this every fall.

So I imagine that hunter/gatherers were aware of the effects of fruit
that had gotten to the "right" stage. That likely explains *why*
someone tried beer. It may have smelled ot tasted similar.

In Traveller, they\'d have trouble doing that for another planet in the
same system. I\'d say they guarantee 10 days for anything within some
number of parsecs  (based on max jump number available). And
progressively longer for farther out.

Given the extrality status of the starport, I\'d imagine that a standard
clause in the treaty would be that the *port* either does the customs
search or helps with it.

However, starships and spaceships are exposed to a *lot* less weather
than seagoing craft or autos. And the normal operating stresses will
tend to be much lower too. The only time you\'ll have stresses coming
from "odd" directions is while in atmosphere during landing or takeoff.

So a ship "parked" in an orbital "junkyard" will last a *long* time.
Fill it with dry nitrogen, or even just leave it open to vacuum
(depending on the ship\'s construction, and whether you plan to sell the
ship, or just parts).

Though to be fair, it was "polyticks getting in the way" that got us on the
moon in 1969.
It wouldn\'t have happened with out the Soviets damaging US pride by being
first in orbit and first with a satellite.

I\'ve read some books by the people involved at NASA at the time and they
were horrified when Kennedy made his big announncement, and several advisors
rang up and told him he should have checked with his scientific staff before
comiiting the US to something like that .

Only that there is a limit on the amount of information that could be
provided in an appendix. The collapsible tank writeup in FT was there so
that I could use them in the designs, and was not meant to be
comprehensive. The full story (shamelessly nicked from HG/TCS -- I love
licenses) will read something like this:

"Collapsible Tank

"A 400,000 gal (60,000 cf) collapsible, self-sealing tank made of a light
folding polymers. Expands into empty cargo hold or space dock (which are
required, to provide support and stability). Holds 120 dtons (120 stons) of
jump fuel when full. Can be installed in 0.5 dton increments. A full tank
will rupture during maneuvers above 1.5g, spilling its contents.

"Fuel from collapsible tanks must be pumped into the normal fuel tanks
before it can be used; thus a jump made using collapsible tanks may not use
more fuel than the capacity of the normal interior fuel tanks. Pumping fuel
before a jump takes about three hours. A typical use for collapsible tanks
is to allow a short-jump ship to cross a gap in two or more jumps."

The statistics remain the same.

Yeah. As I understand it, this is being errata\'d.

Firstly, you cant use fuel directly from collapasible tanks to jump. It has
to go from the collapsible tanks to the main tanks, and then be used to
jump. The handwave is that only \'real\' fuel tanks are capable of bleeding
the fuel to where it\'s needed at the correct rate (me, I say hyperspace is
allergic to neutrons, and the \'real\' tankage includes all those
cryogenically-hardened nozzles and such).

Secondly, being hit in the Collapsible Tankage is Not A Good Thing. Not
much for safe areas, important for those of you who plan on getting those
nice chunky risk premiums for trading in unsafe areas.

Thirdly, regular use of collapsible tankage would probably result in a need
for maintainence and/or replacement. About 20 refills sounds about right to
me for collapsible tanks.

He also had his own band called The Deep Fix which was featured on some of

Psionic shielding only protects against telepathy and empathy, not telekinesis.

The Blobs _aren\'t_ telepaths, they\'re telekinetics. 

If you go on the dubious assumption that a single CNS structure is responsible
for all psionic talents in all species, they might have a higher incidence of
other psionic skills. I suspect, however, that wouldn\'t be the case, as the
psi-organ would have specialized considerably during the evolution of a
species that relied on telekinesis for all it\'s movement.

These things do not follow the canon psionics rules.

    'body' => 'Greetings, All,

I know that there is currently a big debate on our current computer 
TL on the TML.  This morning, before coming into work, I looked over 
the TL tables under Computers, and found very little related to 
processing speed listed under the accomplishments.  Processing speed 
is covered under equipment, etc, and demonstrate that we are above 
the original expectations of CT back in the \'70s.  However, TL is 
measured more by benchmark accomplishments than by exceptional 
efficiency (except when designing vehicles, starships and other 
equipment.  :)

I feel that we are currently at TL 8, in regards to computers.  
According to the game system, TL 8 is benchmarked by massive parallel 
processing, which someone described recently on this list.  TL 9 is 
benchmarked by non-volatile memory and by voice recognition.  We have 
half of those down, so that limits our common TL to TL 8, with 
Earth\'s novelty tech level reaching higher in this area.  In fact, TL 
10 is benchmarked by voice transcription, which seems to indicate 
that our novelty tech level, at least in regards to computers and 
robotics, is a TL 10.

This is the answer I have found according to the game system,
directly from the TL tables in Grand Census and in MT\'s Referee\'s
Companion.  Processing speed, as used in several arguments both for
and against TL 12+ evaluations, is not listed on the technology
profile as a TL benchmark, and merely indicates that some of the
design systems are flawed in regards to processing speed and
capacity, or that we have a higher novelty TL due to that processing
speed, if you view the design systems as "fixed".  All of this is
okay with me, as it all descends from the original CT material, and
I\'ve been cool with it for years.  That\'s MTU, of course.  YMMV.

Now, once we crack the non-volatile memory problem (which it may 
already be done as far as research work, and thus might affect our 
novelty tech level rating, except we already have higher) and the 
solution becomes commonplace (which has definitely not happened, 
based on the number of times I\'ve lost documents over the years), 
then I see no problem with jumping Earth\'s computer/robotics tech 
level assessment to TL 10, solid.

That my two credits, for whatever it\'s worth to you.

Perhaps with a special class of society dedicated to remembering things,

Writing might take them longer to develop, but when they did it might
look to us like one of those Magic Eye posters - doodles with a pattern
that stores a *lot* of data. And since divisions of any kind are alien to
them, the division between the writer and the reader would vanish as
well - anyone who reads the data would, by reading it, add to it or 
expand on it. Kind of a more elaborate version of readers scribbling notes
in the margins of books.

I imagine the idea of taking an idea and freezing it - writing it down - would
be initially hard for them to grasp, certainly harder than it was for us.
Perhaps they would initially keep data in the form of sculptures?

Well, after looking over the TL benchmarks this morning before coming 
in to work, I discovered that I was way off base in some of my 
rememberances of TL evaluation.  This is the actual tech profile I 
believe Terra is at today, 18 May 1999AD:

75-78987-7778-86-A

The novelty tech level is due primarily to our accomplishments under 
computer/robotics, although other fields have occasional 
accomplishments up to this level, and theoretical work at even higher 
levels.  (But I prefer to base TLs on what\'s actually available to 
the PCs and NPCs.)

Thanks for your time.  Now back to your regularly scheduled thread, 
already in progress...

You\'re wrong there for a start. The standard arrangement for subsidizing
merchants described in CT has nothing to do with subsidizing freight rates.

So what you are saying is that ALL corporate jump-2+ traffic is heavily
subsidized by the big planetary goverments? And because freight rates
aboard corporate vessels are a flat Cr1000 per jump, shippers from worlds
so small that they don\'t get corporate service refuse to pay more to Free
Traders, preferring to wait for the next corporate freighter that won\'t be
along?

In Traveller, they\'d have trouble doing that for another planet in the
same system. I\'d say they guarantee 10 days for anything within some
number of parsecs  (based on max jump number available). And
progressively longer for farther out. >>

Yeah, I couldn\'t figure out how they could guarantee an airlift until
I saw their section on aircraft inventory. These guys have access to
MiG-29s and Russian Tu-142 "Bear" bombers, for crying out loud!!!

In Traveller terms, these suckers would have probably have a 5000dton
"Midu Agashaam"-class Imperial Destroyer as part of their inventory.
Fully armed.

Any of you think I\'m kidding? Ballistica Maximus has a very extensive
explosives section, including loaded M180 mortars. Pity their ground
vehicles section is temporarily down; I was hoping to see if they have
any T-72s available..just for rush hour in Dallas. No, really!

I must be getting old and forgetful. I could have sworn that several weeks
ago a number of people explained to you that, yes, a 400 T ship plus a
fuelling station costs more than a 400 T ship alone but that 1) the cost
per unit transported is lower, because you can transport a lot more units,
and 2) that, say, 10 300 T ships and a fuelling station costs less than
10 400 T ships. [Not in those exact words].

No great Traveller ones, but we had a Paranoia scenario where someone
was accused of being a communist - 

"You\'re not a communist, are you, friend Troubleshooter?"

"Of course not, comrade Computer"

There then followed a scramble to prove our loyalty to the Computer by
offing the commie clone.

I was in downtown SF the other day in my leather jacket and motorcycle
boots, and passed by Saks 5th Avenue, where PeTA and a few other loonie
groups were protesting.  I asked one of them why they weren\'t hassling me,
since I was draped in Dead Cow Skin.

The protestor hemmed and hawed, and finally complained to one of the cops
that I was harassing her.  Got to love it. I later walked by the again,
eating a hamburger, rest assured that I made production of it.

I don\'t know about PCs, (as in RPG) but I know plenty of brilliant, highly
paid programmers who know nothing about how the low-level hardware works.
One programmer I know quite well is a highly sought consultant in his area
and earns close to a quarter million dollars annually.  Beyond putting
expansion cards into a PC (as in IBM), he knows next to nothing about
hardware.  His 15 year old son had to set up the house network for him,
since he couldn\'t figure it out.  Conversely, I know plenty of Computer
Engineers that can\'t program anything more complex than a 4 bit adder.   

So while "computer" is an OK approximation, I vastly prefer the GT 4-tier
breakdown (operation, programming, electronics, hacking).  And before you
ask, no I don\'t think someone with programming automatically has a high
operation (although they should and do default).  I knew several excellent
programmers that came from Russia that took months to learn to deal with
DOS/Windows.  They were used to just writing the code and handing it to the
data entry people for transfer to the computer (often by punch cards).

Bah... This is the argument I\'ve heard quite a bit from the list in the
past.

It\'s entirely plausible, at least in my opinion, that nanotech advancement
will come in degrees. Introducing nanotech doesn\'t mean that you *must*
include mature, well-developed, bug-free replicators. There are other ways
that the tech can be used.

There are alot of canon laws. The two biggies that were already covered
concerned travel and communications. There are others, but they may change
depending on the person that you talk to.

Automation is one of the big sticking points for alot of people. The
Traveller books indicate that the Imperium is largely devoid of artificial
intelligence and large scale automation, so to some people you\'re not
playing Traveller if you utilize such things in your campaign world.

Biotechnology and extensive genetic engineering are other sticking points
that people tend to get very worked up over.

It\'s cheaper to pay a brand new 21 year old management trainee straight out 
of college (and inculcate him/her into your business\' culture) than to pay a 
40 year old who has a family and demands a much higher salary (and will work 
less years for you until retiring). This is why age discrimination is rampant 
in the American workplace. I asume this consideration applies to some extent 
in the Traveller Megacorps. I could see the Megacorps severely punishing 
those who go through their training, and then quit to go independent...

Better yet, bringing the full talents of the tech support department to
bear to make the new networked HP printer capable of printing on 11x17
paper, then having the chief techie say something like "Whew, that sure did
take a lot of man-hours to get working right, what did you need it for
anyway?".

I mean, I just made the one casual remark that I couldn\'t get it working,
how did I know it would take two guys 3 hours each to get it up and
running?  I just wanted it for deckplans!

Anyway, its better than finding pornographic image files being backed up
nightly on tape...

The version of the FFW system in T4\'s Imperial Squadrons ends up producing
sys def squadrons too hard for an attacker to crack. ISTR that some people
posted fixes for the system.

Interestingly, I recall reading somewhere a rule of thumb that an attacker
should outnumber the defender 3:1 at least. Would this hold true for
Traveller space combat, or is the advantage with the attacker?]

Older versions of Traveller had a pump time to transfer the fuel to
permanent tanks from the collapsibles, IIRC. This, along with the space
they occupy, could make them less viable. I also suspect that they are less
strong than the demountable units. One could postulate that there are
fatigue limits too.

  That\'s easy.  They impound it.  On a good day they impound the person too.
Strip search, cavity search, lots and lots of questions.

   Sufficent bribes can help if properly applied.

It\'s sure cheaper to build a non-jump warship for defense than it is
to build a jump-capable warship for offensive operations. The attacker\'s
only advantages are strategic - he can focus all his offensive operations
against the defenses of one star system, defensive operations have
to be pretty spread out. Add to this that the defender has a two-week
minimum lag on getting reinforcements to a system that\'s under attack.

Big strategic advantages can overcome a lot of tactical disadvantages.
Take a look at the United States of America in WW2.

Try *10*-1.  If the defender has any time to prepare, and is defending home
ground, you\'ll need to really pry him out.

Since defenders in Traveller Space combat aren\'t at the end of a rather
tenuous supply line, I\'d give them the advantage.

Hey, you never know where you\'ll find other gamers..

This morning I picked up a seemingly normal businessman.  He dove into the
Wall St. Journal while I negotiated morning traffic.  When I got an add, I
had to look up the obscure hotel the guest was at.  Getting my hotel book
out, I happened to pull out _Far Trader_.  

Guy\'s eyes get real wide.. "Traveller? I used to play that in college..."

Needless to say, none of my other passengers understood a damn thing all
the way to the airport (Jesse: he got a giggle out of the SFO
illustration), and he swore he was going to go out and buy all the GURPS
stuff.

Made my day.

There\'s one advantage I can think of for the attacker, besides the

being defended.

Planets can\'t dodge, evade, or retreat. They pin the defenders in
certain ways, force the defenders hand. If the attacker drives hard
on the planet with everything, the defender must stop him quickly
or millions will die. The attacker can lose badly, and still leave burned
out craters where metropoli and starports used to be - losses that
will cost more, in lives and material, than the starfleet sacrificed to
inflict them.

I can see how the fragility of the planet could be a kind of defense. The 
attacker, unless he\'s in some Black War scenario, wants the planet intact.
As long as he wants it intact more than he wants to deny it to the
defender, the planet is (relatively) safe. This situation can change in
moments, of course.

I\'m not sure how "non-volatile memory" is defined viz. the 
TL chart, but we have a large number of non-volatile memory
solutions in current use. Your hard disk is one of them; 
flash EEPROM as found on many digital cameras is another. 

I would fully support declaring Earth, 1999 AD, to have a 
solid computer TL of 9, novelty TL of 10. I anxiously await
Frank Pitt\'s opinion. :)

Says you.  Unforunately, you\'re not qualified to tell us bout TL9+ computers 
and while everything you say applies to the majority of TL8 computer science, 
it is irrelevant to the discussion at hand (but I\'m really getting quite used 
to your TL-8 analogies.  I\'m sure you\'ll eventually bring up some animals 
somewhere along the line, too.  Maybe something to do w/ an abacus, which is 
an appropriate analogy for what you have to compare w/ even a TL-12 computer, 
much less TL-15 or 16 or 17).  ;-)

I *knew* we\'d see another display of incoherence from you, really, though the 
best is yet to come, i\'m sure  ;-)  This time you were rather coherent, 
though, if narrow minded and inflexble.  You seem to be unable to get your 
mind out of the TL8 (GTL7) rut you\'re stuck in.  Your "experience" w/ 20th 
century computers has put u in a cage as far as 57th century computers are 
concerned.

How do you KNOW this will apply?  This ignores even some obsuricities and 
theory from *today* much less a couple thousand years in teh future.  The 
human brain definately doesn\'t appear to follow that hard cut rule, and 
synaptics (the "organic cores") You can assume that computer science has 
reached a dead end w/ just incremental increases of efficiency on current 
hardware/software, etc, but that is quite sadly lacking in imagination.  
You\'ve always been stuck in TL-8, though, it seems.

Even playing along w/ you, Virus is "inside" the computer.  Inside it\'s 
world, it can manipulate the flags as easily as you can scratch your ass.  At 
TL-11+ computers are no longer deterministic.  Ignoring everything in 
between, for a moment, at TL-17 computers are explicity able in canon to be 
able to program through the hardware only (B8: Robots, MT\'s Ref Companion, 
etc etc).  Whether this is backwards compatible w/ lower tech level computers 
can well be the subject of a mean debate, though it\'s an apparent presumption 
(to a limit) of Virus, as written.  Even modifying that to be synaptics 
required, etc doesn\'t hurt the concept (or effect or implementation) of Virus.

Again, trapped in TL-8.  There is NO Virus "instruction."  Virus *lives* 
inside the system.  As a power surge, free-floating program, or whatever.  
Those same little electrical pulses that make you the... sophont... known as 
Charles Prevatte, maybe.
You can have no argument against synaptics since you don\'t know how they work 
(and are a ready made Bill Gates if you do...).

Virus can switch the flags.  Like waving your hand.  It can also burn it\'s 
own circutry and disconnect your security system (probably taking over the 
ICE, ala HIV and T-cells) or cut routes around the security system, assuming 
they\'d have any effect to begin with.

"Today."  Course, playing along w/ you, Survival Margin (pg 75) says that the 
Virus was already extensively trained/designed to take over every standard 
Imperial compute configuration (which had been standardized in an "Imperial 
Data Package which covered everything from graphite pencils to radial tires 
to starship software").  For non Imperial computers, once inside a peripheral 
systme, Virus would watch how they worked.  It would do *nothing* after 
carving out it\'s "hidey hole" except watch how the OS worked and learn how to 
manipulate it.

Remember, one of the core principle of Virus is for it to be able to burn 
it\'s own circutry over existing circuity, based on the method of the 
Cymbeline predator, just on a larger scale.  *Hardware* not software 
modification.  Once it\'s in the system, that\'s the first thing it does.  
Shutting down and reformating, by whatever method the computers do that is 
fine, but a Virus will come right out of it\'s hidey hole and reinfect.  Alot 
quicker than you can blink your eyes (though sometimes I imagine u do that 
pretty slow).  : P

To be a strawman, I would have to have put that up for you to knock it down, 
which wasn\'t the case.  Stop using words because they look cool to you.  ;-)  
I\'ll stop short of accusing u of plagarism.  ;-)

No crap.  But do you live "inside" a computer?  Nope (though I\'m starting to 
wonder. lol).  What does data and code "look" like on the "inside?"  If you 
could directly manipulate it w/ your "will" or "hand" or whatever it would be 
intuitive to you.  Too bad it\'s not.

I haven\'t written any, though I\'ve taken a CS class or 3, it does make "anty" 
sense to me.  I\'m not debating anything you\'re saying (though I could take 
out some theories, but it seems others have beat me to it) about *todays* 
computer theory nor even the basic principles.  You\'re completely closed 
minded in allowing any improvisation around them based on your narrowminded 
view (and absurd conclusions).  Have you joined the anti-Drop Tank ranks?  :-)

They had to?  Remember there\'s a transponder that\'s linked to the main 
computer?  Straight from transponder chatter (way before any squawks) to the 
main comp, to a hidey hole.  Even ships w/ a mute can\'t stop their ships 
transponder from reading others.  It\'s still infectible, just can\'t infect 
until the mute is turned off.

It\'s surely "relavent" in that it isn\'t a "chip lifeform" either.  It\'s eons 
above them evolutionary, as Lucan\'s scientists did in the lab (they had an 
extraordinary mutation rate, according to Survival Margin).  It\'s an 
electronic lifeform.  Get enough space in a signal (and/or series of signals) 
hidden in the tremendous amounts of data required for tightbeam commo from 
hundreds of thousands of km, and it\'s actually moving to the new system.  No 
"executable" to run.  It\'s actually "jumped" to the new system (actually 
replicated, since the original personality has stayed in it\'s system). 

Remember, the transponder method of infection completely circumvents *all* of 
your objections (though they don\'t hold water against the way Virus works, 
just on your (incorrect) interpretation of it).  Every ship w/ a transponder 
was ready made for the Virus, though unintentionally.  The SDG suite was a 
familiar location (being a lobotmized embryonic Cymbeline predator) in an 
alien electronics system in which to grow and develop and proceed *directly* 
into the ship\'s computer.

Unfortunately, you the Sysop, are told to shut your hole and plug the 
transponder into your computer to comply with Imperial regulations.

What changes?  There are no checksums.  Blah blah.  Get out of your TL-8 
computer prison.  This was mentioned by Survival Margin too.  You have read 
the book, haven\'t you?  lol.  Or at least "When Empires Fall?"  The only 
thing visible would\'ve been power spikes as Virus was cutting new circutry.  
Noone but Lucan\'s scientists would\'ve known what it meant, though.  It\'s 
inconceivable fo ryou to believe the last paragraph of Survival Margin, pg 
74?  The relevant sentence is, for teh sake of brevity, "In the realm of 
measure, counter-measure, counter-counter-measure, 
counter-counter-counter-measure, there is always a small window of 
opportunity for the latest system."

*Have to be* but *could* be.  To say nothing of the fact that Virus might be 
able to switch the flags, even if there was the set difference.

When you\'re reconfiguring the physical circutry, this is not a problem,

It\'s the same.  They operate the same.  Part of Imperial standardization.  
Besides, most ships w/ Fb comps don\'t have St comps (what\'s the point?  If

Easy there, khihe.   Just yanking your chain.  Besides the fact, that wasn\'t 
what I was referring to (but EM shielding stopping a Virus transmission- all 
u need to do is yank out your transponder and not accept the tightbeam commo).

Two weeks?  Where you came up w/ that is beyond me.  LOL.  Not from Survival

"kill" ships ala Vampires till the Collapse (months afterwards), AFAIK.

There was too.  You obviously didn\'t catch it (duh), though, and i\'m hardly

explicitly explained on pg 78, 2nd column, 3rd paragraph.  Must\'ve missed it,

Hundreds huh?  Care to list em?  None of your "incansistances" hold any 
water.  Strawmen?  That\'s the ticket.

Well, on the TRS-80 or Apple ][ there was a poke statement in the basic
interpreter, so you would convert your assembly language to decimal DATA
statements, and POKE it into memory. On the apple at least, you could 
control the motor from basic by using PEEK and POKE statements, since 
the I/O was memory mapped. All I remember now was that FF69 was the same
as getchar().

I do remember you could put an AM radio tuned to 540 (the lowest frequency)
next to your TRS-80, and could time the loops in a basic program to output
interference enough to play music

What is C++? I didn\'t even hear of C until I got my Apple IIgs (late 80s).

You have synaptics in your home computer?  Can it calculate a jump?  Where\'d 
u get it from?  :-)  Though it may fit the definition of a CT TL12 computer, 
it doubtfully is TL-12 as far as ...better... (:::donning asbestos loin 
cloth:::) versions of Traveller treat it.  ;-)  

>Traveller is _not_ a high tech universe when it comes to computer tech,

Only if you tip toe around such things and wish to overdefine them.  

Biotech could well be presumable in the background (at least proteus viruses 
and panimmunity, etc... not much in GURPS: Biotech beyond the GTL12 hurts 
Traveller\'s background IMO, which is happily the Imperiums limit- though GT 
could have a helluva time w/ the TL-16/GTL13 worlds out there, of which there 
are more than a few).  The cloning and geneering *IS* canon already.  
Nanotech never "pans out" as much as sci-fi authors drool (though IMTU it 
does work pretty good as a fluid, kinda like the T1000 or Odo, but even that 
is TL17+ (a few "colonies" running around in what was Imperial Space).

Gee, sounds about what they\'re doing to my character in Roger Barr\'s PBEM.

IIRC, non-volatile memory in Traveller does not refer to storage
media such as hard drives, disks, CD-ROMS, etc.  The concept, as I
understand it, seems to indicate that the RAM of the system is
non-volatile.  In other words, you could remove the power from a
computer in the midst of processing a complex equation, then later
(much later, even) restore power to the system, and the computer
would pick right up where it left off, in mid-calculation.  That\'s
the concept I remember being described (and thus the reason why
simply unplugging a Virus-ridden system won\'t deactivate the Virus),
but then again, my own memory has been rather faulty of late, so it
might help to check that out.  Specific details/descriptions are
listed under Book 8: Robots, Grand Census, and MT Ref\'s Companion. 
If I have misunderstood it, and the examples you\'ve provided fit the
description of that classification, then I agree with your assessment
below, and we\'re looking at TL 9, with a novelty tech level of TL 10.
  Until I\'ve had a chance to look it up, however, I will stand by my
TL 8/novelty TL 10 evaluation earlier.  I am prepared to accept the
change if I have indeed misunderstood the reference, though.

For the record, while I don\'t like the Virus concept and the 
storyline that went along with it, I must admit that the Virus _as I 
understand it_ does seem to remain "internally consistent" with the 
Traveller milieu technology, _as described by the various Traveller 
products over the last two decades_.  I can also see why people have 
difficulty with it due to the current nature and capacities of the 
computer industry.  I personally don\'t like the Virus concept and 
find certain faults with it in a Real World (tm) sense, but _within 
the Traveller milieu as described by Traveller products_, I must 
admit that it is "internally consistent."

Fortunately for me, the Virus struck the Traveller milieu after the 
time periods I prefer to play in, and thus, is not that great a 
concern to me.  Should that change, for some reason, then I\'ll deal 
with it, Berserker style, or skip it by carrying my milieu through 
the Long Dark Night (AKA the Second Long Night) in which the Virus is 
effectively eradicated, and pull out the Fourth Imperium.  Or I could 
follow the GT official alternate timeline, where there exists little 
need to develop and release the Virus, and bypass that 
situation all-together.  MTU, of course, YMMV.

Thanks for your time.  I now return you to your regularly scheduled 
thread, already in progress...

Well there\'s already a canon (Smash & Grab) mention of Virus possessing 
psionics... or at least emulating psionic effects (see RSBs Ref\'s Section 
discussion of psionics).

Well u\'re a TNE\'er so AG and Reactionless Thrusters are already out.  :-)

Yeah, but you have people who, just like with drop tanks and any other

it\'s alot of the same people, w/ the same dead arguments.  :-)

Mmm... i don\'t think so.  Definately have "organic cores" and synaptics 
floating around in any case.  Maybe for the case.  ;-)

Well that\'s for starship models that have a helluva lot more to do.  A more 
appropriate analogy is maybe the implant computers from FF&S.  It\'d be nice 
if we had some sizes on these.  See the article Jon Goff did on computers, on 
his website.

Engineered to TL16-17 (the canonical level of AI, according to numerous

I don\'t necessarily agree w/ the rest, either, though am willing to quibble.  
Still have about 20 digests to go through...

Maybe not in a usable form.  Virus is eons (evolutionarily) from the 
Cymbeline predator.  Why didn\'t the cymbeline predator inhabit the entire 
planet?  I don\'t have that adventure...

Sensor scans is mentioned as "theoretical" in Survival Margin, but not

(at least known).

Except for the "hidey hole" which is an explicity mention everywhere Virus is 
mentioned beyond just its personality. There\'s also "firewalling" to protect 
against an invading strain ala Vampire Fleet\'s electronic combat system.

Sandman\'s a little different.  The only times he moves systems is in the end. 
 To "prove" himself, he *says* he deletes himself from the Skywatch system.  
Who\'s to say he doesn\'t have another backup/clone?  :-)  I know it\'s 
presented that he didn\'t, but would you trust humans that much, if u were him?

It didn\'t do that until it was in most systems for *months* being deciedly 
unobtrusive in the meantime, especially so it watch silently and see how 
everything worked.

Because of the "hidey hole."

Noone has every said all their ships, just the ones that want to enter the

Not into all vital functions, just to the main computer, which Traveller has 
always had pluged into everything anyways.  Especially in the SoM, though I 
don\'t buy that fully, so neither should u.  ;-)

The Deyo chips is just a "familiar" and very convenient place for Virus to 
infect.  Not necessary, though.

The SoM has each main system having a "local CPU," which does make sense.  
Also a direct connect to the main computers.

And your reliance to techno-magic is equallity predictable.  It works
because YOU say it does.  You argue against logic with the \'logic\' that
future systems are so far beyond us that we can not understand them.  BUNK!
Logic is logic regardless of the media.  A computer in order to be called a
computer must be able to evaluate mathamatical and logical operations as
that is part of the definition.  That set curtain limits whether you like it

Of course I do.  The concept is at least a decade old.  Hardware and

And exactly what is YOUR technical reasoning behind this?  How did it go
from senor data \'like a picture\' to a program that has OS level systems
resorces?  And do not say because it\'s alive.  That is to much like saying
it\'s magic.  You are alive, that does not give you absolute control over the

virus has in it\'s world.

That\'s putting the cart before the horse.  It would have to have a very good

It is a strawman concept because it is unsuportable and a diversion form the

computer.  It is a curtain thing based on it\'s definition.  It has to be

Of course not.  The use of drop tanks is a logical extention within what is
known of the system, though their \'logic\' depend greatly on your assumptions
of the implications of canonal sources.  I am neutral in the drop tank
debate until I find a canonal \'smoking gun\' if such exists.

If the transponder has execute acess to the main computer you are correct.
That computer is toast.  If the transponder is a \'chip entity\' then it can
become the \'hidey hole\' itself.  I\'ve said this in my own theory of virus
operation.  Are you reading all of this and the related threads or are you
just skimming?  I am NOT anti-virus.  I am just trying to better define it.
In fact if anything I think canon has the virus greatly underpowered.  It
behaves very stupidly.

That stuff is data.  Gata does not control anything directly.  It would be

So that system is so ADVANCED, and yet a basic technique used as far back as
1950 would protect it against this virus and it is not used.  Yeah, right.
They did not lobotomize the \'chips\', they lobotomised the 3Is engineers!

In the first few months, true.  Also if the burn in power were from the
transponder\'s curcuits the transponder controled by the virus could cover
those spikes particularly if it did the \'burn in\' while in system and hide
the surges as transmitter bursts.

Actually, no.  That applies only under a narrow set of conditions in the
real world.  A true secured system is all but unbeatable to hackers and
viruses (in the real world).  The transponder makes ship systems NOT secure
so this does not apply.

True, but you still have not explained how the virus in the SEALED

As for detail YOU miss the part about \'physical contact\' being required and

I agree, under your assumption any "incansistances" would be strawmen as
they are inconsistant with todays technology.  Though I could be wrong in
that as the spread on the virus was also curtailed by the limits of jump and
the time before the first generation of the virus self distructed.

Now, once we crack the non-volatile memory problem (which it may

One of the Star Trek:TNG novels visits the issue of non-volotile memory
in computers (Title:  Survivors).  The idea was that Federation
computers use memory that can\'t be changed, only added to.  So, when you
delete a file, it still exists, there is just a pointer to the file
saying it is deleted and to ignore it.  That is actually true of most
magnetic media today, but with magnetic media you can overwrite old
data.  Only physical destruction of memory structures would actually
"delete" a file in this type of non-volotile memory.

Now that I\'m home, I can look up the description of non-volatile memory.
Here goes:

From Book 8, Robots, pg 18, under the Robot Brain:
Tech Level 9:  Non-volatile computer memories become common, so that no
power supply is needed to preserve data when the computer is shut off.
Computers can now be stored powerless for years, and yet pick up where they
left off as soon as power is resumed.

From MT\'s Referee\'s Companion, pg 30:
Tech Level 9 (circa 2010):  Non-volatile computer memories become common,
so that no power supply is needed to preserve data when the computer is
shut off.  Computers can now be stored powerless for years, and yet pick up
where they left off as soon as power is resumed.  Practical superconductors
allow a significant increase in processing speeds.

While the language of the text could be liberally interpretted to cover
storage media, I am pre-disposed to interpret the above to refer to the
actual memory accessed and utilized by the CPU, as both texts refer to
storage media specifically as data storage, not memory.

So I still feel we\'re at Computer/Robotics TL8, with a big step towards TL
10 going on.  Once the non-volatile memory situation exists, we have the
remaining benchmarks for TL 9, and once voice transcription becomes
commonplace, we\'ll be at TL 10.

My uncle had a feature in his computer that burned the memory into a
specific section of his hard drive and when it booted up, everything was
reloaded into memory.  Even disregarding that (which is a software fix),
we\'ve got eeprom (sp?) which allows you to electronically program and
reprogram a chip.  REALLY expensive, but doable.  I don\'t know how fast
that is, but if one assumes the relatively slow eeprom memory is standard
aboard starships (for safety concerns) then it explains their cost and low
efficiency.

Just to be a bit contrarian, here...while there are software solutions,
notably Dragon systems\' stuff, that does _primitive_ voice
transcription...it is limited, and needs a prolonged training period.

We\'re a _heck_ of a long way from walking up to a computer and saying:

 "Aye, computair, Chief Engineer Scott here. Print me out a wee copy of
those jump drive 12b slash 6, no make that 12b slash 7 control module
plans on the big printer over there by the Xerox machine. No, I dinna
need it in 3D, I want the flat schematics."

and getting what you want.

_That_ is TL-10 voice transcrption: where you can use any computer
essentially all the time using voice not a keyboard.

Hey!  Except for the Scott ID, that\'s exactly how computers IMTU used to
work... knew I should have copy righted that ;^)  But furthermore, if there
was more than one computer in the room/area, depending on the chore
required, your direction or tone of voice, the computers could tell which
one you were talking to!  Other than that, you had to name them... one ego
tripper in my old campaign used to call his consol "Slut" so he could be
anywhere within earshot of it and say, "hey Slut, I want..."  I don\'t know
if we have that right now?  Perhaps those who are certain about our future
developments compared to Traveller TL could look in whatever crystal ball
they have and tell us when next year (or the year after?) we should expect
that?

Another interesting fictional reference to the Difference Engine can be
found in Michael Flynn\'s novel _In the Kingdom of the Blind_, in which a
secret society, with insights provided by beyond-bleeding-edge
technology (the Difference Engine in the mid-19th century, more modern
computers since), struggle to mold the world into their own image (or at
least to mold it for their own convenience and profit).

That, sir, is because you have failed to recognize the most important
characteristic of the human liver.  It is more similar to muscles than
to other organs.  If you fail to exercise it, it remains soft and
flabby.  If, on the other hand, you exercise it on a daily basis, its
strength increases, and it becomes _hard_.  [Like a hockey puck  >;-)]

Hey, I\'ve been meaning to ask.  How different is the Merchant Prince
*book* from the JTAS insert?  I never bought Merchant Prince
because I had the Journal..what am I missing?

The disturbing thing here is that I _always_ use i, j, and k as mu integer
counters, and I\'ve _never_ even read a piece of FORTRAN code.  (I think I
saw some in a textbook once....)  So the passing has been successful.

Or, from the "You may be a wirehead..." list:

"...if, upon hearing the term \'G-string\', your first thought is an
alphanumeric variable."

BTW, my training in FORTRAN actually proved useful in my career as a US
Army interrogator.  Seems I was working as an OPFOR interrogator, when I
encountered a SERE  (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) student
whose cover story involved being a computer programmer.  I asked him, in
my bad fake foreign accent, what languages he knew.  When he said that
he knew FORTRAN, I asked him to write a _very_ simple program in FORTRAN
(it should have taken maybe five lines of code).  When he failed to
produce, I wrote the program for him, dropped my bad fake foreign
accent, and asked him what his _real_ job was.  _Such_ a lovely sight!

ObTrav:  How many Traveller referees out there have players who know how
to interrogate captured NPCs?  Not many, I\'d bet....

Citizen Berry mentioned the two most important factors in maintaining
the "feel" of Traveller, without regard for campaign setting.  Factors 3
through 7 are essential to the _Official_ TU, but are not necessary for
the feel of the game as such.

One can, for instance, run a Milieu: Interstellar Wars campaign in which
factors 3, 4, 6, and 7 above are unimportant.  OTOH, the key factors of
travel time and communication speed _must_ be maintained for the game to
be recognizably Traveller.

Such as? The Imperium has robotics which are considerably more
sophisticated than what we have now. If our computer tech were TL12,
where are the robots? Advanced robotics of the kind we see in Traveller
(eg, security robots) would require sophisticated computer tech --
tech which I still maintain is beyond us now.

I\'ve pored through my CT, MT, and TNE sources, and I find nothing that
supports your contention. If you base your contention that our computers
are TL12 simply because of how fast they are and/or how much storage
capacity they have, you\'re missing the bigger picture. I could just as
easily say that a Formula 1 race car is of a higher TL than my Chevy
Cavalier because it can go faster (an observation which would also apply
to a Formula 1 race car from 1960), or that a Mack truck is a higher TL

Really? We have computers that can control the matter/anti-matter intermix
so that the ship doesn\'t explode? We have computers that can search a 
database of great huge reams of data -- something on the order of the
data contained in an average university library -- and find the result in
several seconds, just by having the user say out loud, "Computer! Find this
data!"? We have computers that can do the incredibly complex calculations
that would be required -- to say nothing of the data processing requirements
- -- to run a transporter?

Get real.

But if you\'re going to hide behind (your interpretation of) the rules, then
so can I. Here are some examples from the TNE equipment list:

Medical Scanner, Computer: This larger, hand-held version of the pocket
med scanner takes rapid readings just like its smaller cousin, and thus it
greatly reduces the time spent on a Medical (Diagnosis) task. The larger
scanner differs from the pocket version in that this handheld model includes
a complete expert system diagnosis computer, which allows individuals with
little or no medical skill to diagnose and treat illness and injury.
TL: 12 (page 334, TNE rulebook)

Battle Computer: Man-portable battle co-ordination system, capable of
collecting intelligence estimates, providing approximations of enemy
forces, and suggesting tactics. 
TL:9 (page 341)

The TNE rulebook (page 340) also describes Language Translators, a TL12
device, which is essentially a computer with specific software for a
very specific purpose.

We have NONE OF THESE now.

I\'m willing to concede that some of our cutting-edge comp tech is at
around TL10, as someone else suggested in a very well-written post.
But the idea that Earth 1999 computers are Traveller TL12 is not one
that stands up to analysis. When the original Traveller LBBs were
written, computers were still not part of everyday life on a hands-on
basis. They are now. That\'s when we crossed from TL7 to TL8. TL12
is still a long way away.

  If they have to import it then they have to pay as though the L-Hyd is
imported cargo; however, drop tanks can also radically reduce the cost of

Keeping them awake for a few days, getting them seriously disoriented by 
drugs, etc, works even better.  Problem with torture is, if the person you\'re 
trying to use it on has been trained fairly well, it\'ll just make them focus 
on *not* giving you the info you seek.  Pretty soon, all you can do is kill 
\'em.  Then you\'re out the information *and* the time you used on them.

I\'ve deleted most of the discussion.  I just want to not what a pleasure
it is to see the beginnings of a discussion about canon itself.  What is
canon?  What are its sources?  What forms does it take?  

This discussion is about the last question.  Doug was stating the only
points of canon necessary to play Traveller.  T. Green followed with a
list of points necessary to play Traveller in the Official Traveller
Universe ("OTU").  T. Green\'s points don\'t actually affect any rules;
you can play Traveller as published perfectly well without regard to the
OTU.  You can make up your own background and ignore the OTU completely,
but if you want to use the rules (notably starship design and trade
rules), you have to keep travel time to one jump per week and
communication to the speed of travel.

I\'m sure that they\'ve all been done, but maybe not by members of this
list.  I did lawyers, artists, and police a long time ago (for CT, I
think), but doubt that I have the handwritten notes.  (Do you remember
handwriting?  It\'s a very old technology in which the user holds an
ink-based or graphite-based printer in his or her hand and puts the
output directly onto paper.  No CPU and no power source are needed. 
Handwriting was later supplemented by typing, in which a direct
keyboard-printer interface called a typewriter put the output onto
paper.  Again, there was no CPU, and some typewriters had power
("electric typewriters") while others did not ("manual" or, sometimes,
"portable" typewriters).)  Where was I?  My friend James Polk did a
great enhanced character generation table for pirates, but I don\'t know
where he is, and I didn\'t make a copy.

 It\'s entirely plausible, at least in my opinion, that nanotech advancement

 There are alot of canon laws. The two biggies that were already covered
 concerned travel and communications. There are others, but they may change
 depending on the person that you talk to.
 
 Automation is one of the big sticking points for alot of people. The
 Traveller books indicate that the Imperium is largely devoid of artificial
 intelligence and large scale automation, so to some people you\'re not
 playing Traveller if you utilize such things in your campaign world.

Please don\'t take this as a personal attack, but which version of Traveller
were you looking at ?

The only mention in the CT TL tables in the computing column after the
computer is invented is the model number of the computer, and that equates
purely to processing power, speed and size.

I don\'t see a Tech Level table in the MegaTraveller books, and in the
listings most "high tech" stuff is either TL10 or TL12. All of the stuff I
saw in a quick skim that was listed as TL10, we have already, and we have
some of the TL 12 stuff

I don\'t have the TNE rules, so can\'t check that.

In T4, TL9 is _explicitly_ listed as 1990 - 2000, and somehow TL10  becomes
"interstellar community" which sort of implies we should be implementing
stardrive next decade <grin>

Again, in the equipment lists we have everything listed as TL10, most of
what\'s listed as TL11,
( inertial nav is TL11 according to that book , someone obviously didn\'t
tell Sperry-Rand ! )
and the only TL12 item I found was a grav belt, which obvioulsy we don\'t
have.

>I feel that we are currently at TL 8, in regards to computers.

Again, which game system are you talking about ?

Actually, we have non-volatile memory, and we\'ve had it for years, at least
since the early eighties when I first started programming devices that had
it. It\'s in general use all over the world in comsumer appliances, cars,.
etc. any application that truly requires it. It\'s known as EEPROM or
Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory, if my acronym memory
is correct

True, because of it\'s cost it is usually used for the purpose the name
describes, but physically it is non-volatole memory amd _could_ be used for
main ram on a slower processor if you have the money to throw at it . I
believe the NASA laptop the GRiD Compass had a section of RAM mapped to a
form of EEPROM.

But most people don\'t need it,  and it costs far more per K than normal RAM
so most people don\'t use it.

That\'s one option. There are others. Nanotech can work best as additional
background color. As an example, anagathics have traditionally been assumed
by most canon or semi-canon sources to simply be an ingested chemical that
keeps the taker from aging. However, anagathics could actually be groups of
nanites that help to keep the body young. It could be a series of genetic
treatments. It could be all of them. Different types of anagathics may be
available in different places. They may have various side effects. Some
types might be cheaper or more painful than others. Maybe some are illegal
on certain planets.

Some of the advances may be somewhat invisible to the players, but may have
very real effects for their characters. Imagine extremely light climbing
cables that are treated with countless nanites that constantly keep the
material strong and  pliable. Maybe the cords will not work in extremely
cold temperatures. This could make for some interesting situations.

The advances in manufacturing inherent in nanotechnology could go hand in
hand with established canon technologies with no major problems.

Automation is here. It\'s here to stay. It\'s only going to get more advanced
as time goes on. There\'s alot of interesting research being done into the
discipline of automation right now. In real life it has revolutionized
nearly every aspect of our society, and it will continue to do so.

There\'s a belief that with AI levels of automation, people will become
extinct or useless. I\'m not sure that I agree. After all, once nuclear
warheads were married with rocket technology, everybody assumed that a
world-devestating nuclear war was right around the corner. We\'re still
waiting on that one.

A couple of years ago, one of the SFB players at my club needed some
ship system displays photocopied. In a generous mood the club chairman
offered to help.
IMO his offer was a bit abused but a few weeks later he handed over a
couple of *thousand* photocopies (ie several copies of each page of
about 10 books).

	"How long did that take?" we enquired.

	"No time at all, I just booked a couple of hours overtime
	 for one of the clerks." came the reply.

I _almost_ want to put Light Sabers in my Traveller game after seeing this. 
Almost. The trailers do not come close to portraying the intensity of the 
actual duels...

The reviewers are obviously not xenobiologist-wannabees. Jar-Jar is not 
nearly as annoying as they all seem to think.

The pod race is stunning, and unlike light sabers, pod-racing will fit into 
Traveller just fine. The race announcer must be lampooning _someone_, I\'m 
just not sure who. Pit Droids definitely go into MY next game...

Worth the money. No question.

And a good one.  The original chips required physical contact.  It wasn\'t
untill they \'mutated\' it into the virus that it suddenly gained all the
powers of both a virus and the original chips.  Canon does not explain the
mechanism.  I tend to think, like others, that it must be a psionic power as
it is inexplicable otherwise and that saves having to think about it.  The
virus as written never made sence to me.  In some ways it has powers and

behavior.  Perhaps the indistructable undead serial killer from pop cinima
would be a good model for the virus.

Reason: for a starship, the biggest expense is time. Time between 
mortgage payments, time between crew paydays, time between 
maintenance layovers. Compared to that, the difference in cost between
jump-2 worth of fuel and jump-3 worth of fuel is negligible.

There is the cargo space lost by hauling around an unused jump-1
worth of fuel, that could either be a matter of modular construction
(same hull, different pods for different routes) or factored out in 
mass production - they built so many jump-3 hulls that they cost less
to run than a jump-2 ship, even on a jump-2 route. (Granted, that would
be a truly massive production run.)

With time as the highest operating expense, it doesn\'t matter how
many parsecs, just how many jumps. Thus every destination one
jump away from the origin effectively (for a large enough organization)
costs the same. 

Therefore, if a shipper has a destination jump-3 away, he\'ll put it on 
a jump-3 ship. He\'ll only put it on a jump-2 or jump-1 ship for multiple
jumps if something makes the jump-3 ships temporarily unavailable.
Then the shipper has to decide if it\'s worth a premium to ship early,
or if he should wait for the next jump-3 ship.

That jump-1 Free Trader will cost him Cr3000/dtn to get his cargo to
a destination jump-3 away, because he has to hire each dtn for three
jumps of the Free Trader\'s most expensive bit of overhead - *time*.

Our computer technology, and perhaps several other technologies
at the present day have exceeded the expectations of Traveller Tech
level. We\'ve gone nowhere, AFAIK, in the field of anti-gravity.

Note the major area of research the Solomani have canonically lagged
behind in: Gravitics tech.

Can you imagine a technology more crucial to a race\'s conquest of
space? You can\'t even start on jump drive until you live beyond the
100D limit. The difference between an orbital society based on 
thrust and one based on gravitics will be astonishing. No wonder, for
all our computer and biotech accomplishments, the Ziru Sirka 
thought of us as primitive.

The Ziru Sirka is a space-based empire. Their view of an alien culture\'s
tech will be most highly colored by that culture\'s space flight 
accomplishments. 

The Solomani, once they took over the Ziru Sirka, probably liked the myth
of their low-tech grandparents defeating the high-tech Vilani - a "real
human" wins because he is a "real human", not because of fancier
gadgets, or so the myth will go - thus the Ziru Sirka view of a low-tech
Earth persists, even in histories re-written by the Solomani conquerors.

As long as Earth has tech advancement holes where gravitics and jump 
drive are, we will be considered in the TL8 range overall, at least by
Traveller standards. Anything better we pull off would be discounted as
"cunning gadgets" by any race that did have gravitics and jump drive,
at least if that race were as space-oriented as the Vilani.

It was definitely a nightmare. Just looking at "before and after" subsector
maps, with all those charnel house star systems - trillions dead, in 
manners ranging from your coffee machine murdering you with a
steam explosion to a whole world dying when the atmosphere plants
exploded. It was chilling just to read it.

I haven\'t run any scenarios set during the main Virus incursion. You
fight your way out of an apartment building where everything from the
television set to the front door is trying to kill you, surrounded by 
screams and the smell burning flesh, and find that the city outside is
worse. Then ortillery starts hitting all around you, and you see the 
reentry fires of the Highport heading right for you.

You probably die before you find out that it isn\'t some kind of (human)
invasion, it\'s not a Black War raid. It isn\'t just your city, not just your
planet, not even just your particular frontier -  the whole of human space
is like this now. There\'s nowhere to run. That was just too big for me
to put a bunch of players in the middle of right then.

I don\'t see any problem with Virus maintaining both the original 
hardware-burning ability and the "ghost in the machine" ability. 
It willsimply retain the former in it\'s "memory banks", use it as 
possible - even use variants of it, like access to a ROM burner or
the config routines of a reconfigurable computer core. It wants to
burn itself permanently into as much computer media as possible,
it will live as a ghost if it can\'t.

Probably a very paranoid and desperate ghost, until it feels safe by
making a permanent source for itself.

The character generation is somewhat different - the categories of characters,
for example. (I remember being disappointed that I couldn\'t properly generate
the same Oberlindes "Interface Line" captain with Merchant Prince - I think

Come to think about it, as Julian said, I think I\'ve seen that regularly in

Then again, I\'ve written programs for my ancient Sharp calculator/PC (it had
4k of memory and BASIC in ROM) and could call a variable anything I wanted,
it\'s  just that only the first two characters mattered. ISTR (it\'s been a
loong time since I had the ol\' II+ out of the closet) that Applesoft Basic
followed the same convention.

The special effects were worth the money. I thought the storyline was
severely lacking. I\'m glad I\'m not the only one who was quite fond of the
pit droids. For the record, the announcer appears to be a send-up of Bob
Uecker\'s (sp?) announcer from the baseball farce "Major League."

It was a pleasant experience, but not a rewarding one. The visual tapestry
was fantastic though. I *love* seeing vast, sprawling science-fiction cities
and from that angle the film didn\'t disappoint.

If raw destruction is what you want, you can achieve by planetoid
bombardment (hey kids, let\'s get the near-c rock AND Virus debates going at
once!)

Assuming you want to capture the planet relatively intact, and especially
need orbital facilities like shipyards to be functional, the advantage
shifts to the defender.

As I\'ve said before, if a world is incapable of supporting human life, it
will surrender to any fleet that comes along.  The is too much danger of a
stray shot killing the entire population.  A world that has a habitle
biosphere will need to be reduced in detail by ground troops.

I like this idea.  As I recall, the best anagathics in the Imperium were
made from the sperm or roe of the tree kraken (which lives only on a few
worlds in the Spinward Marches), and were used by the Emperor himself
(that\'s mentioned in some of the early GDW adventures).  The
introduction of these synthetics might lead to all sorts of societal
dislocation, as people of ordinary means become able to find and buy
them.

I\'m with Fred.  I won\'t see this for at least a couple of weeks, so if
you\'re posting spoilers, please mark them conspicuously.  (Rob Morse
wrote in his column in the San Francisco Chronicle that the trailers are
totally false advertising; the movie is actually the low-budget art film
Lucas has always wanted to make, and consists entirely of the main
characters sitting in a starport bar talking about life, the universe,
and the future of film -- sort of "My Dinner With Obi-Wan".  We can only
hope.)

We should remember our roots.  If I remember the interview correctly,
Marc Miller and Loren Wiseman saw the first Star Wars movie together and
drew much inspiration for Traveller from it.  (They both post to the
list, so they\'ll surely correct me if I\'m wrong.)

Oh yes he is.  Try seeing the movie if you are hearing impaired.  I
couldn\'t understand a single word that thing said, as all of his dialogue
was right in a range that I\'m blanked on.  He came across as an annoying
whine.  Add in the constant level of backround noise and loud f/x, and I\'m
lucky I read a synopsis before going in.

Those are combat tables for _Brilliant Lances_, which was the combat system
for _Traveller: The New Era_.  This is well worth finding, as it\'s one of
the better space combat systems around.

Andy Akins was supposed to come out with a revision of his spreadsheet that
would include stats for both BL and the companion game _Battle Rider_, but
he\'s been enslaved by a cute baby.

And the less than stellar performances/character development. Although I
thought the Liam Neelson CGG really did look like him, the Ewan McGregor
one looked kind of washed out on Tattooine. Still, it\'s amazing what they
can do with computers, nowadays.

To me, the most compelling character was the Queen\'s bodyguard. He actually
seemed to be alive and not a computer-generated action figure that ... huh?
... uh, what do you mean they used live actors?

If Liebnitz is who I think he is, then this is true.  But he was an almost

  Bundles of unarked bills, small denominations...  .. oh, reasons?
Maybe the laws prevent it - maybe custom does. I\'d just like to see
a case made for a believable reason for the OTU.

Depends, in M0 or TNE that is _not_ true...again, this is derived from
#\'s 1 and 2: That he who controlls the speed of communication controls
information.

Hey, you forgot: <_rinse_ and repeat> ;-)

> 6) "Major races" [discovered jump drive on their own] vs "minor races"

A political distinction and hangover from the 1st Imperium...it is not a
law as much as a fragment of the background, and debateable, given that
_all_ of the major races\' Jump drives are essentially identical, there
is strong (IMHO) circumstantial evidence that their \'discovery\' by the
major races are in fact reverse engineering of found Ancient Artifacts.
Gramps seeded the universe with jump drive \'plans\'; the \'major\' races
simply managed to hide the fact that they found the drive. The Hivers,
in fact _did_ develop a jump drive entirely on their own..it was an
inferior drive, more related to stutterwarp than \'true\' jump drives.
When they recovered a \'true\' drive from a human ship (IIRC) they rapidly
incorporated the superior design into their ships.

More evidence is the canon fact that, although they are classed as
\'major\' by everyone, and even appear on Droyn Coyns as a major race, the
Aslan, in fact, got Jump drive from a wrecked solomani starship.

This idea is also supported by the fact that Droyne jump drives (though
\'handmade and the best known\') are of the _same_ design, and the Droyne,
as far as anyone can tell have indeed had Jump drive since Grandfathjers
time, they just have a _real strong_ racial disincentive to creating
interstellar empires. (Something about the Final War...I don\'t know
_why_ they might be somewhat afraid of _that_ ;-) In fact, it\'s entirely
possible, given the vast destruction accompanying the Final War, that
Grandfather manipulated the surviving Droyne population to eliminate the
drive to Empire and innovation. Perhaps this is a consequence of the
Coyns that is unknown to _anyone_, maybe even the Droyne.

> 7) Psionics

Which are clearly listed as optional in all versions of Traveller. The
OTU background includes psionics, but here we\'re talking about
underlying postulates that govern any reasonably non-divergent TU. 

Those two laws are the Big Ones from which all else can be derived.

  I agree. That\'s my point in the Price of Freight thread; you may face
some disagreement, though.

It is also far too slow to be used in main memory space, and has a
limited write cycle: you can only erase it and re-write it so many
times, as anyone with a well-used digital camera with a flash card can
tell you.

Further, while reading memory is low power, and storing it is no-power,
_writing_ it is much higher power. that makes it hot and current
- -hungry.

Typically EEPROM is used to store a few tens to a few k of configuration
parameters, and as such is analogous to a solid state disk rather than
memory.

Only if Rod Elliot isn\'t involved, I would imagine:

technology, not computer technology. We can - and do - make computers with

Turing machines - which can be built, if you are really desperate, with
clockwork and paper tape. And, of course, the whole point is that they can
*all* do exactly the same calculations and processes - eventually.

Analogue computers are not Turing devices - at least not usually - but are
seldom used any more. In TL terms we have made only three advances in
computers - creating them, analogue devices and Turing devices. Since our
systems were originally defined as TL 6 or so, then all the window dressing
and speed differences we have made with our materials technology might - but
only might - put us at TL 7 now. Maybe TL 8 at a pinch.

Quantum devices - also not Turing machines - would be a further advance, but
don\'t exist yet. The only other advance in sight is the development of
self-organising, self-aware devices (thinking machines). We are on the
threshold of both, so just maybe we are at TL 9 going on TL 10, but more
likely at TL 8, going on TL 9. You are mostly looking at the way we are
\'packaging\' what we have been able to do for many years, rather than any
real advances in what we can do. A tad over-optimistic about our technology.
