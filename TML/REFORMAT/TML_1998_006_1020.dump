I\'ve recently been trying to work out just what society is going to be
like IMTU and I\'ve been doing a lot of thinking about cybertech, nanotech,
biotech and robotics/automation. I can accept cultural limitations on cyber,
nano and biotech, but not automation. I can\'t see a future were most direct
manufacturing is not done by robots (look at the automated car plants and
warehouses we already have). It just makes **Too** much economic sense to
do otherwise. So just how does a society cope with the massive job losses
this will entail. Well looking at current trends, I can see three basic
responses:

1) Massive increase in the service sector. This is happening right now, I\'m
   not sure on the exact figures, but the number of jobs in this sector
   have increased several fold in the last 20 years (I think it might even
   be an order of magnitude).

2) Reduction of working hours. A simply solution, if the number of jobs is
   halved, society responds by halving working hours effectively spliting
   each existing jobs into two jobs. This solution will have meet strong
   oposition from employers.

3) A welfare state. Another simple solution, though I\'d call it a Citizen
   Wage state (you are theoretically paid a wage just for being a citizen
   and therefore "contributing" to the state).

The most likely response to increased automation would be (IMO) a lot of
option 1, a fair amount of option 2, and a bit of option 3 (even though this
is a more likely response than option 2, a permanent underclass of proles
just doesn\'t fit IMTU). So what do I think the results of this would be? IMO
it will create a much more stratified and heirachical society (I\'d liken it
to late Victorian England). Those will "real" jobs and those who serve them.

anymore, so, there is no reason to make an effort to keep 
compatibility with IG materials... I go back to MT, and put them all 
in the "materials pool".

	Will it be the famous T4.1, or T5? Maybe TRAVELLER: PENTIUM? Or is 
this just a way of saying that the alternate universe of Gurps: 
Traveller will become the one and only setting? I doubt this, because 
the "foundational role-playing rules" (character generation, 
tasks, ship construction) won\'t fit in Gurps.
	Anyway, it\'s sad to see that Traveller receives a new blow. I hope 
that, if there is a new edition, only writers who know something 
about Traveller are allowed to develop materials for it.

The concept of only God being capable of perfection is a perfectly valid
philosphical concept. The usage is clear from the next line. This is not
a religious concept per se, mearly a statement that humanity prevents
perfection. God here is merely used as an unobtainable goal.

I find the post puzzling and am unable to quite understand it\'s relevance to

Ermmm. It was on in the UK around Christmas. I didn\'t warn you in case you
viewed it as a spoiler and I didn\'t want you to ruin B5 series 5 for me
(less than a month to go!).

Actually, I didn\'t warn you because I didn\'t know it was on.

- - Lack of proof-reading?

_Or_  was  it  because  it  was  lacking  a  story?  CT  had  the
storylines of the 5FW  and  the  secret  of  the  Ancients  (told
through TAS news items and related products),  MT  had  a  strong
storyline of the Rebellion  (told through  sometimes  conflicting
TAS news items  and  related  products),  even  TNE  had  a  weak
storyline of the post-3I recovery.

But I don\'t remember seeing much of a storyline in  T4.  Yes,  it
fit in to the overall history of the Traveller universe,  and  it
had its own recent history, but it didn\'t progress this ... there
was no \'local\' storyline.  It was just a snapshot in time.

The potential was there.  We should have heard tales of political
intrigue from the Imperial court as the old social structures  of
Sylea are stretched to accommodate the expanding empire.  Stories
of gold rush mentality as  fledgeling  megacorporations  race  to
build and exploit new markets.  The inevitable frictions  as  new
pocket empires  are  absorbed  into  the  greater  Imperium  with
disparate world views  and  moralities.  The  scouts  making  new
discoveries  beyond  the  growing  borders.   Acts   of   gunboat
diplomacy from the Navy.  And the usual scandals and corruption.

And it could have been told through _regular_ \'news\'  updates  in
the Journal, linked to adventures, supplementary sourcebooks, and
novels.  The T4 setting would then come to life ... it  would  be
vibrant and interesting ... and popular at the game  store  till.
We\'d want to know what happens next.

	This can even be found in my old school books. I could post a table
	for germany regarding migration from so called 1th sector (agriculture)
	to the 2nd sector (production) to the 3rd sector (services) from
	1600-1990 (TL:3-8) showing that trend.

	This is posible with a "left wing" government, but last try of
	germans union caused a politic shift from left to right (never
	mind the ballots, if election would change anything there would
	be a law against them ;-) made by the FDP (german liberal party)
	and this is of topic now. But it will become one of the solutions.
	e.g. its even possible the Mac jobs slicky Bill introduced for
	US could become better payed over the time, and that it would
	be sometimes ok to work half a day, just because its difficult
	for Mac to get a reliable waiter for less.

	From looking at statistics I have, I would say that average
	working hours per day to make a living, is increasing from 1
	hour at TL1 to its maximum of 12 hours at TL:5 down to the 8
	hours at TL:8 we now have, to perhaps 3 hours at TL:15.

>    and therefore "contributing" to the state).

	The ShadowRun Pueblo Modell, well I dont think that this would
	work. But I would like to add some Traveller(tm) solutions and
	a bit of what I think about economy.

	4) Poverty for the masses ! Claim of many economist is the 3/4
	   society with 3/4 without work and income. Extremly nice for
	   capitalist imperialism, and of course sponsored by them.
	   This could be common for TL:7-12 balkanised planets.

	5) Postulating a 4th sector, e.g. education. If we claim that a
	   TL:15 country will have half of its population under education,
	   to produce anything, we would need a large education network,
	   sucking up most of the people who work, and only a few are
	   doing a service, producing something or even growing weed for
	   fun. This would fit good to the civil service but also to other
	   governments.

	6) Feudal technocraty. Perhaps one of the best things about a
	   feudal government to say is, that land lords are not thinking
	   in paying wages (my grandfarther did\'nt pay neither his serfs
	   not his bondsmen) but has to care for their living, in good
	   and in bad times. Portugal where the Don is still common in
	   the rural is showing the same tradition, that the Mafia shows
	   (the Italian not those rotten Ami\'s), that the Don is normaly
	   wearing old clothes looking as if he\'s one of the poor. If you
	   have ever seen Don Benidetto (CEO of Olivetti, shareholder
	   of AT&T and a lot of other companies) outside of a major
	   computer exhibition, you know what I mean. If you ever have
	   been in rural Portugal, where a Don trying to look poorer than
	   the old man and women left to him, you know the dark side of
	   the model.

	7) Civil Service Government: You have to teach children once a
	   week, or clean the garden to make a living, could be the good
	   side of this government. But unnecssary work, problems with
	   the 5 years plan and the SNAFU princip, expressing in problems
	   like anybody has work and money but the supermarket does\'nt
	   have toilet paper for 4 weeks, are the bad side.

	8) Cultural differences. Lancian or Suerrat have an other
	   philosophie work than Solomani, and Vilani are perhaps slow
	   in technological advance for a good reason.

	9) It could be possible, that the TL cause people to work less
	   theory, is totaly wrong. People have to work even more
	   than now to sustain high tech, and they addionaly need
	   enormous im and exports (with terms of trade on their side
	   of course) because only extrem large societies can build
	   techlevels higher than 10-12. This is my (uncanon) synergy
	   formular of course : population >= 10^techlevel/2^maintmod.

	ok 9 points and closed ;-)

	IMTU I have the above traveller governments and a lot of handwaving
	to introduce just a nother crazy government. My planet side
	economy is different to interstellar economie. The starport
	in MT was extrality zone, means outside of the planets border
	in imperial space, even if it was a downport. So it was possible
	to allow free trade at starports, but to restrict imports and
	exports.

	TNE is of course a different things, the trading slaves for
	spareparts for ships and for gimmicks for the TEDs. Lots would
	be happy to have problems the 3I had.

Not really.  A person would have enough time to survive in a vacuum and
at least pull a control to close the lock and pressurize.  You better

Hold on to your keyboards, or cover them!

Here locally, a few weeks ago, a guy held up a convenience store.  He
then tried to buy a pack of cigarettes there about a week later. 
Needless to say, the clerk recognized him!!!

True, it is sad, but like a Timex (c), it takes a licking and keeps on
ticking.  I have _never_ seen a game survive so much turmoil before.  We
should take some pride in being part of such a thing, even if it is just
a game.

If it hits water, you will get a massive tsumani, capable of reaching
many miles inland.  If such a rock impacted in the Pacific, all the
islands would be inundated, and the coastal areas all around the Pacific
Rim would become mud flats many miles wide.  It would be better to have
the thing strike ground (if you can call a gigaton range blast good!).

Just a quick tale about human wave tactics, and psycology.  There is a
story from Korea about such an event, when the PRC used these tactics
against a series of UN lines.  The Americans were the first line, and
when they ran out of ammo, they fell back.  The second line was British,
and when they ran out of ammo, they fell back.  The third line was a
Turkish unit.  Now, when they ran out of ammo, they didn\'t fall back. 
They still used swords then, so they drew blades and started lopping off
heads.  The PRC broke and ran.  Why?  To their mindset/religion losing
your head keeps you from being reincarnated/reborn/going to heaven/etc. 
Something for the GM\'s to think about when presenting a low tech threat. 
Everyone has some breaking point.  You should give your PC\'s some chance
to find this.

Heh. With all the antiaging drugs and gene therapies out there, I 
wouldn\'t be so sure. Besides, it happened long before the start of 
campaign. Now the war devolved into something akin to a Cold War, and 
there\'s an external threat my player\'s don\'t know about yet. <eGMg>

Well, congrats, Marc. I hope you have more luck with Traveller
the next time around. Not buying a house in Texas, are you?

So, will this increase or decrease the "collectible value" of T4 books?

Actually, it was the practice of bank-robbing by towtruck that has caused
many banks to get rid of their standalone banking machines in favor of
ones built into buildings. There was one bank, in Virginia? Delaware? one
of the eastern seaboard states that lost five or six of them that way in
a day or two.

I once knew someone who served time for armed robbery (actually, I knew his
brother, and later met the guy, and yes he _was_ that dumb!) for robbing
the burger joint he worked at. You see, he put a mask on, but he did the
talking, and it was during his shift, so everyone recognized him right
away. Worse...it was during his shift, and he KNEW they always did a money
drop right before that shift, so he got maybe $100-$130 or so.

But he was also a large, dangerous psychopath as well.

Actually I think that it is a good thing IG stops trying to make a few by
rushing out badly proofread/layouted, canon-checked books. Trav has
actually gained something from this as GT will probably sell more because
of this and MM might try to do his T4.1/T5 thing without all the errors
most, if not all, products from IG had. Good riddance.

You can use the Traveller character generation system and substitute
GURPS skills and stats or you can make up random character generation
charts for GURPS quite easily.  My hope is that something about this
will be including in GURPS Traveller... if not in the first book then
in a later book (GURPS Traveller Characters?).

Tasks are handled differently, obviously, but it\'s a different system.

GURPS has Vehicles, a quite comprehensive vehicle design system
comparable to FF&S.  All that needs to be done is to define some of
the staples of Traveller Tech in GURPS terms and you\'re ready to go.

I\'m not saying that GURPS Traveller will replace anything but it is
capable of handling whatever you want it to handle.

Actually, not a hell of a lot. Two part-timers are cheaper than one
full-timer: no benefits. Some of the largest grown areas in the US economy
has been in _part-time_ jobs. Also, there is a corresponding increase in
the use of temps. The single largest employer in the US is Manpower, a
temporary agency. Some companies are hiring what have become known as
\'permatemps\', long term temp workers. 

Microsoft is one of these. When the courts ruled that Microsoft (among
other large employers) couldn\'t simply fire vast numbers of their
employees and immediately rehire them as \'independent contractors\' to get
around paying taxes and benefits, they hired them from temp agencies. Some
of their \'temp\' workers have been working for them longer than five years. 

Micro$oft did that to my town. they came in and said they wanted to put in
a support center here...there were going to be hundreds of jobs,
full-time high-paying ones, _but_ they wanted some concessions form the
city first, like tax rebates, and a guarantee that the city would pay
_them_ for unused space in the building they were leasing until they
needed it (the building itself was another $@#!$@ing boondoggle enTIREly)
and other consessions.

But HEY this was MICROSOFT everybody, a big company bringing in jobs to
the city!!!

Well, they had an employment open house, expecting 800-900 people to come.
there were more than 8000 that showed up from as far away as Texas. In the
end there were something like 35 \'real\' jobs created, most of those were
filled by people relocating from Seattle, and the bulk of the rest were
contracted out from temp agencies. Within a year, Microsoft was gone,
anyway, along with several hundred thousand dollars from the city.

So I\'m familiar with the Zhunastu Rules of Contact, yes! :-<

Okay.  I\'m no expert on Chinese folklore or religion per se, but I play one
on the TML^H^H^H^H but I\'ve spent a good portion of the last 20-odd years
living there and reading about and studying the damn place -- and I\'ve
never heard of this belief.  This story, rather, sounds suspiciously like
the idiot analyses by funny-if-they-weren\'t-guiding-the-military
"intelligence community" that were so popular back then.  Not now, of
course

expected to march so fast?  Why?  Why, because of the awful athletes\' foot
they all have, from working in rice paddies all day long.  _Obviously_.

this will entail. Well looking at current trends, I can see three basic
responses:

1) Massive increase in the service sector. This is happening right now, I\'m
   not sure on the exact figures, but the number of jobs in this sector
   have increased several fold in the last 20 years (I think it might even
   be an order of magnitude).

2) Reduction of working hours. A simply solution, if the number of jobs is
   halved, society responds by halving working hours effectively spliting
   each existing jobs into two jobs. This solution will have meet strong
   oposition from employers.

3) A welfare state. Another simple solution, though I\'d call it a Citizen
   Wage state (you are theoretically paid a wage just for being a citizen
   and therefore "contributing" to the state).

The most likely response to increased automation would be (IMO) a lot of
option 1, a fair amount of option 2, and a bit of option 3 (even though this
is a more likely response than option 2, a permanent underclass of proles
just doesn\'t fit IMTU). So what do I think the results of this would be? IMO
it will create a much more stratified and heirachical society (I\'d liken it
to late Victorian England). Those will "real" jobs and those who serve them.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Or a 4th option:

New services and products will be developed.  As Automation increases, and cost of
goods decreases, companies will find new ways to make money.  Already we see
products with amazing capabilities being "given" away...  cell phones...
Netscape...  etc.  And the cost of others dropping fast.  Look at the phone
industry:  ATT was forced to drop over 300,000 people a few years ago, and the cost
for long distance calling is dropping fast.  Yet the TOTAL number of jobs in the
communication industry has increased each year.  Why?  New products and services,
increased volume, new ways to use things.

Also I would expect that as more things become "low cost" other folks will be
willing, expect, desire, to pay for more "human" services/products.  Art, hand
made/tooled devices, etc.   I does not have to be a lower class that produces these
items, and I could even argue that the opposite will happen.  The few people with
real talent will be sought after like rock and roll stars of today. (You mean that
you BUILT that thingy by HAND!!!!!  I wish I could!!!)

I do not see 2 or 3 being an option.

my cr. 2.

Some time ago, it was available online with the help of my friend

announcing it, although it is not completely ready yet. For the

never posted before, so you can consider it new), the history up to 
milieu Zero that I posted on the TML one year ago, the timeline, and 
data on the Milieu Zero Geonee, including my revised version of 
Massilia sector.
	In due time I will be adding materials for the Geonee in The

manage to find the time.

True.  Traveller survives in spite of itself.  It\'s a testament to the
powerful pull of the game universe.

You don\'t see this fanatical fan following for other dead games.  Any other
game, given what Traveller has been through, would have only been a memory
now...if that.

Read Niven and Pournelle\'s "Lucifer\'s Hammer."  A great book, if a little
dated (no shuttle, first American black astronaut in space, etc.).  The
series of sequences in which the comet hits Earth are amazing, especialy in
Los Angeles.

In the name of Ghu WHY!?  IG has treated writerspoorly, shown no concern

I\'m almost glad to see them go.

I think this is for the best Marc, since it was clear to most of us that
Imperium wasn\'t really committed to a quality product.  If I might make a
suggestion on who I\'d like to see publish Traveller..  FASA.  They produce
the best looking games on the market.  Layout, editing, artwork are all
top-notch.  Look at things like the Seattle Sourcebook for Shadowrun, or
the House/Clan books for BattleTech.  Imagine having a set of 200 page
books detailing the Imperium, the Zhodani, etc, filled with illustrations
of uniforms, medals, leading figures, corporate logos, etc., etc.

Not really.  With all due respect to the TNE contingent, many people
welcomed the return to a rules set based on CT.

This was one of my big problems.  The Foss artwork did nothing for me.
Traveller has always been, IMHO, hard SF.  Foss\' work didn\'t convey that
the way the art in earlier editions did.

These three go together.  The rules had some great ideas, but they were
bogged down by horrendous editing and proffreading.

I can\'t speak to that.

When CT first came out, there was no story.  I took a few years for the
Imperium and the whole idea of the Ancients to evolve.  Remember, in
Adventure 1, the Zhodani didn\'t even have a name!

The Milieu:0 setting had real promise, and I\'m sorry it was so poorly handled.

Excpet the new Journal lasted all of two issues.  There seemed to be a
curious lethargy in getting the ball rolling.  We couldn\'t even decide over
on the ISBA list what year it was!

But...I wouldn\'t mind so much if the quality was there.  I just felt cheated,
especially when I had a choice of spending my $30 on the softback, ugly,
broken, bug infested T4 basic rule book...or plopping down the same $30 for the
incredible, full color, slick page, hardback, Star Wars Second Edition Revised
& Expanded rule book that incorporates well thought out game mechanics.

Ya know, if it was 1977, the T4 rule book would have been incredible.  But
today, we demand better quality.

Let\'s not forget West End.  Look at their stuff.  I\'ve been reading the Star Wars
rules lately, and they are what Traveller should have been.  The game systems are
similar (both use D6\'s, both have skills based on stats, both have similar skill
lists, etc.).  It would be a snap to base a Traveller rules system on the
incredible system in Star Wars.

I\'d like to see a major overhaul on the Traveller rules, whichever way Marc goes.

Poul Anderson\'s Dominic Flandry series (especially _The Rebel Worlds_,
_Ensign Flandry_, _Agent of the Terran Empire_ and _A Stone in Heaven_).
Flandry is an intergalactic intelligence agent for an empire that is just plain
humungous, so many stars that even the ones they claim have often never
been visited by anything more than a prospector\'s starship or a scout just
passing through. Flandry is risking life and limb, by his way of thinking,
to hold off the Long Night of interstellar social collapse that is coming. He
is often in situations where he could call in the Navy, but they would break
things and leave little glowing craters all over the place - so he looks for other
solutions. Well written, and good reads.

Keith Laumer\'s Retief series (lots of titles with "Retief" iin them).
Retief is a diplomat with the Terran diplomatic corps. The entire series
is a parody of diplomatic niceties, as light as the Flandry books are
dark. Interesting contrasts, as both Flandry and Retief are called upon as
troubleshooters of similarly-scaled planetary revolts, interstellar intrigues and
such. Retief\'s best bit - he\'s been given a packet of sealed orders, to be opened
at his destination and followed _to the letter_. In it is every nuance of protocol,
regulation and advice needed to see him through this situation. He graciously
accepts it, and dumps it unread down an incinerator shaft on his way to his
spaceship...

Alan Dean Foster\'s _Icerigger_ - a botched kidnapping attempt aboard a starliner
leads to a band of unlikely travellers (most with "Player Character" stamped on their
foreheads) crashing a lifeboat on a frozen world. Great bits of high-tech castaways
dealing with low-tech (but smart and well-developed) natives.
Foster\'s _For Love of Mother Not_ and other books in that series are also good reads - 
pretty light, but a good feel for the fringes of a cosmopolitan interstellar society.

Andre Norton\'s _Dark Piper_ - interstellar society is starting to break down, and an injured
soldier returning to his homeworld warns that others will come from the sky, soldiers with
no causes to fight for anymore and looking for a world to plunder. Only a group of misfit
youths take him seriously, and only they escape the invasion. Powerful work, like most from
Norton.

There was also a book called _Star Viking_, I think by Hal Clement - probably one of _the_ most
obvious sources for Classic Traveller - the Sword Worlds in the Spinward Marches have the same 
names as the planets in this book. Breakup in interstellar society occurs, and intrepid adventurers
(and greedy thugs) take to the stars as reavers, then as conquerors, and finally as builders.


Others as well, but these are some of the ones that most inspire my sci-fi RPG perambulations.

Okay.  I\'m no expert on Chinese folklore or religion per se, but I play one
on the TML^H^H^H^H but I\'ve spent a good portion of the last 20-odd years
living there and reading about and studying the damn place -- and I\'ve
never heard of this belief.  This story, rather, sounds suspiciously like
the idiot analyses by funny-if-they-weren\'t-guiding-the-military
"intelligence community" that were so popular back then.  Not now, of
course
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The more probably cause of the above wasn\'t the loss of heads, it was the
well-known scariness of Turkish troops.

One of my father\'s friends was in Korea during the war. He tells me it was
standard operating procedure for the Chinese to hit a UN unit with everything
they could the first night after that unit was newly rotated into the line.

They did it to a Turkish unit _once_.

Individual Turks from the unit positioned near his got a reputation for getting
bored, disappearing for an hour or so and coming back with a half-dozen
human ears.

    'body' => 'I found this annoucement on FarFuture\'s web site - not sure why Marc hasn\'t
posted it to the list (embarrassment, possibly.) 


FarFuture Enterprises is pleased to announce the successful conclusion of its
negotiations for a new company to develop and publish Traveller products. 
The new home of Traveller will be White Wolf, publisher of the highly
succesful "World of Darkness" games, including "Vampire: The Masquerade."

The new edition of Traveller will be known as "Traveller: The Voyaging". 
A White Wolf spokesman stated that they will be taking the opportunity to
move Traveller in several new directions, emphasizing aspects of the game
that they consider to have been previously neglected:

	-Players will take the roll of various groups outcast from normal
society, including psionicists, criminals, space pirates, and exotic
character types such as surviving Ancients (decendents of a god-like
being known as Grandfather.) 

	-Traditional Traveller players are, basically, wimps, with (at best)
technological parity with the rest of society. "Traveller: The Voyaging" will
reverse this trend, giving players access to technology not generally available,
to Really Big Guns, and to advanced psionic powers. "We believe individual
players, with their personal weapons, should have the ability to devastate
entire cities; that\'s the point of SF role-playing, after all. Players should
have access to starships capable of destroying whole worlds. Psionic player
characters will be much more powerful than in previous editions of Traveller - 
psionic powers will be central to Traveller: The Voyaging"

	-Dark, brooding, gothic style will be emphasized much more. "We
haven\'t yet decided which era of Traveller\'s rich history to set our 
product in, but we\'re considering such popular eras as the Hard Times at the
end of the civil war of previous Traveller editions, or the massively-popular
"New Era".

	-Gratuitous sex and sexual activity will also be central to 
"Traveller: The Voyaging", with a 10-page section of rules governing this
most central of activities. "Traveller never really explored sex much - we\'re
going to reverse that, and take advantage of Traveller\'s varied alien
species to emphasize interspecies relations. Sex between humans and such
alien species as the lionlike Aslan, the doglike Vargr, the peaceful 
Centaurs, and the mysterious Hivers will be covered in the basic rules.
Future supplements may include "Sex Lives of the Ancients".

The artwork for "Traveller: The Voyaging" will also reflect new directions
for Traveller. In the tradition of Imperium Games, White Wolf has secured
rights to reprint artwork from a popular science-fiction artist for 
cover and interior art. "The artist we\'ve selected is H.R. Giger, who will
bring an exciting new look to Traveller." 

The new rules will be based on White Wolf\'s existing World of Darkness
system, with additions for such things as starship travel and design. 
However, these rules will also reflect White Wolf\'s traditional emphasis
on storytelling and ease of play. "Previous Traveller starship rules
required players to be capable of such complex mathematical operations as
addition and subtraction. Our core audience isn\'t interested in math - so
our rules will emphasize the fun of playing "My starship is bigger than
your starship" over the details. If a player wants his new starship to 
be ten times faster than anything built before, who are we to say that
isn\'t possible?" White Wolf also promises to bring the accurate physics
of "Star Wars" and "Star Trek" to the Traveller universe.

White Wolf expects to release it\'s first "Traveller: The Voyaging" ruleset
one year from today, on April 1, 1999. Other supplements will follow at
precisely one-year interludes. The first supplement will be available in
hardback with a full-cover original Giger cover - most likely in a plain
brown wrapper due to its nature - for a price of $60 US. 

Far Future enterprises has announced that they are very pleased with this
arrangement. "From our standpoint, White Wolf brings two major assets to
the table. They have an excellent distribution system (their products
are available in major bookstores), and they have big buckets of money,
which they\'re willing to share", said a FF spokeman.

The identities of the designers for WW\'s "Traveller: The Voyaging" haven\'t
been annouced, but WW is in negotiation with several famous Traveller
fans and contributors, including Ken Whitman, and a person known only as
"Leroy". Most of the famous proofreading and layout staff from Imperium Games
will also be brought on board.

"Traveller: The Voyaging" - the true future of Traveller!

By CT Petersen, Fantasy Flight Publishing, 1997, $44.95 US, £35UK

This is a SciFi Board game that I came across at our local Virgin
Megastore. It is for 2 to 6 players (better with more), all of which take
the side of a warring faction trying to regain the glory of a once faded
empire. The feel is sort of a blend between Traveller, Foundation and Dune.

Each race has a certain skill (for example diplomacy) which is beneficial,
and a certain technology profile which may give them edges in different
areas (weapons, propulsion, general). These profiles all vary at the start
and are somewhat reminisent of the technology architecture profiles
discussed in TNE and FFS1.

The game map is different each time, made from hex tiles in a similar
matter to Settlers of Catan. the centre of the map is always the former
Imperial capital Mexatol Rex and the home worlds of the players are always
out on the rim of the map which is made of three further hex rings, placed
in turn by the players. Cetain hexes are impassible or pose dangers
(supernovas and asteroid belts), others are empty or contain one or more
worlds. Each world has a resources rating (used for obtaining funds) and an
influence rating (used for voting at the council at Mexatol Rex).

The aim of the game is to fulfill a number of victory conditions - namely
to increase technology above a certain level, hold a certain number of
planets, and have a certain amount of influence (which effectively means
you must conquer the former Imperial Capital). As these conditions are met
the player moves up a progression chart.

Each turn includes income from planets (resources held), income from trade
agreements, a political phase at the former capital (here a variety of laws
are debated which can be beneficial or detrimental to individual players,
ranging from execution to limits on dreadnought construction), ship
construction and movement and combat.

The combat system is very simple and uses a D10 roll higher than a target
number. Ships available are Fighters (weak but cheap), Cruisers (fast but
weaker than dreadnoughts), Dreadnoughts (slow but lethal) and Carriers
(necessary to support fighters, and to carry Planetary Defence Systems and
Ground Forces). These are all manufactured at orbital spacedocks which can
be blockaded or destroyed. All vessels can take one hit, but the defender
chooses which die first. Simple but very playable.

In addition to the normal phases, each player has a number of action cards
which can be used to favour the rules (benefits for starships, extra moves,
spanners to throw in the opponent\'s works).

Conclusion - would I recommend it? Yes. It is not as detailed as FFW, but
is a great game to pass away an evening with a few friends and the flavour
is close to Traveller.

Notes: There is a new expansion pack (Borderlands) which adds political
assassinations, improvements to dreadnought and carrier toughness, two new
races, new action and political cards and minefields. Not played this one
yet.

It had nothing to do whatsoever ith Traveller in any form, or with
Real-World news or technology that could be applied to the game.  Those of

Here, in France, our social security code goes like this :

1    68    03    30    189    252

1st digit for gender (1=male, 2=female) could be expanded in the 3I to
include alpha and beta males and females for species having these
differenciations, and preceded by an other digit (or letter) for the
race : 1 for human (obviously more numerous), 2 for aslan, 3 for vargr
.....

2nd, 3d and 4th numbers for year, month and day of birth

5th number for the city code where you\'re born (could add the star
system code and sector code in the 3I)

6th number is for your "birth rank" (I was the 252th child to be born in
this city on march 30th 1968)

Very easy to remember the first four numbers, obviously, only numeric
keys, so it\'s easy to type, too.

Could be more readable if you include some letters for sector code,
species, etc, but harder to type.

anyway, my 0.02 Cr ...

Actually, the message had it own built in logic inconsistencies.  Note that I
don\'t follow this opinion:God created the universe
The universe is imperfect
Thus God made a mistake
Thus God is not perfect

The argument then follows that God may have INTENTIONALLY made the universe
imperfect.
If that\'s true, then God is sadistic.
Sadism is a character flaw
Thus God is not perfect

Personally I\'d like to see a sci-fi apocolyptic novel that starts:
... on the fifth day, God created Man... That was his first mistake...

It was mentioned several years go when GDW started its down slope, I think
in a letter in Challenge.  Game publishers survive on retail reorders.
That is places like Walden Books  place restock orders.  The initial order
basically recovers printing costs and your ongoing costs, like salary and
advertising have to be paid out of future sales.  

New products aren\'t the answer, the initial order only pays for production
run, not for the long term survivability.  

It requires a) a big enough customer base.  We don\'t want to face reality,
but there are not enough Traveller players out there to make it a viable
product.  b) products structured to draw more people into the market.  An
example here is why include everything in one book.  Make a separate
players book with player information.  In a group of 6 players, they might
spring for 3 or 4 copies of a players book, but only one or two of a full
book.

We also have to face the reality that RPG\'s are not as popular as they were
in the late 70\'s and through the 80\'s.    You have to have a way to draw
new fans to the game.  In todays society that isn\'t as easy as it was 20
years ago.

Another reality we have to face is those die-hard gamers from the 70\'s and
80\'s have grown out of playing.   12 of our employees once gamed.  The
total currently gaming is 3.

How can Traveller Survive?  I don\'t have the answers.  The story is great
and maybe the future is something electronic or non-print media related.
But to pay writers and artists requires continuous and substantial income.

I agree completely!

IG provided Traveller with some good concepts in their game mechanics, but the
execution was poor.

I\'d like to see T5 be the epitome of a game system, and I\'ve been toying with
something that I believe could be the answer to Traveller\'s future.

For your inspection, here\'s what I sent Marc Miller today in the wake of the
news.

- ----

Eureka!!

I\'ve devised something that could change the face of Traveller.  Let\'s
see what you think of it.

When you are shopping for a new publisher for T4 (or T5, T6, or
whatever),
CONSIDER THIS....

- ----
IMPROVED TASK SYSTEM FOR TRAVELLER
- ----

1:  STATS are added to the task roll at full value.
     STATS are modifiers that improve the task roll.

     EX:  If you have a 7 Dex, then you add 7 points to your roll.  If
     you are wounded, and your
     Dex is lowered to 5, then you only add 5 points to the roll.


2:  SKILLS give you DICE to roll on a task.

     EX:  If you have Pistol-2, you add 2 six siders to the roll.


3:  DIFFICULTY is a set of numbers as used in MT.

     EX:         Difficulty          Difficulty Numbers
                    ----
                    Very Easy                        5
                    Easy                                10
                    Average                          15
                    Difficult                          20
                    Formidable                     30
                    Staggering                       31+


       *difficulty numbers and difficulty categories are for illustration
purposes only.
         I have done no number crunching to support these values.
         I am only trying to explain the concept.



HERE\'S AN EXAMPLE OF PLAY:

       Billy the Gunfighter
       DEX 7
       Pistol-2

Billy wants to fire his weapon at a bad guy.  He gets to roll 3D6+7.
Range to the target will determine difficulty.

Range to the target is medium for the weapon.  Let\'s say that works out
to be a average roll (again, these numbers and difficulties are for
illustration only.  I\'m selling concept here, not a finished task
system).

Billy needs to roll 16+ to hit his target (he needs to beat the 15
target number).

He rolls 3D6+7.  He gets 1 D6 die because even the unskilled have a shot
at something.  He gets 2 D6 from his skill level.  And, he gets the 7
point modifier because of his Dex.

He rolls.  If he rolls over 15, he hits the target.  If he rolls below
the target number, he misses.



HERE\'S HOW OTHER TASK CONCEPTS WILL FIT INTO THIS SYSTEM:
(all numbers below are for illustration only)

SPECTACULAR SUCCESS:  If Bill rolls 10 points over the target number, he
achieves SS.

SPECTACULAR FAILURE:  If Bill rolls 10 points below the target number,
he rolls a SF.

FATE DIE:  The first die Bill gets (not the 2 dice from his skill) is a
fate die.  This should be a different color from the rest.  If a 6 is
rolled on this die, he gets to roll the die again, adding to his total,
making it easier for him to roll SS.  If a 1 is rolled on this die, the
highest die from his roll is subtracted from the total, making it easier
for him roll SF.



WHAT DOES THIS TASK SYSTEM DO FOR TRAVELLER?

1.  It\'s very easy to learn and explain, as I have shown here.

2.  It works well within the Traveller genre.  People can see exactly
what their character\'s skills and attributes bring to the table.

3.  It resolves the STAT vs. SKILL debate with the T4 rules.

4.  It makes that pesky half die a thing of the past.  It is a moot
point now.

5.  It only uses 6 sided die--a prerequisite for Traveller in my book.

6.  It fits flawlessly into the existing Traveller character generation
system.

7.  All T4 rules will be an easy conversion to this system for a new
rule book.

8.  There is no multiplication or division (the KISS system, Keep It
Simple Stupid).

9.  Since STATS are added to the roll as modifiers, it is not a problem
to adjust a roll because the character is wounded.

10.  It would be easy to convert all of the work you have done with T4.1
to this system, and I believe that this system is superior to the one
currently used in T4.1.



Marc, I\'d like to see this new Traveller be not just the best Traveller
edition ever, but the best role playing game ever.

What do you think?

Space Viking, by H. Beam Piper. 

One of the odder references I\'ve been using recently is the PBS children\'s
science program "Bill Nye, the Science Guy."  Laugh if you will, but each
show explains some interesting concepts along a central theme, and Bill is
science\'s answer to Robin Williams.

TNE\'s story was much stronger than Megatraveller\'s (which WAS CTs story). Very
little was ever revealed.  The much reviled San*klaas was the beginning of a
story about the Ithklur quest for freedom.   They\'re worried very much that
the whole thing could be another damned Hiver manipulation...  but would that
get passed the closed minded?  The Empress Wave, the Black Curtain...  it was
ALL coming out...  
   The post-3I recovery is a remnant of the Old Era... the New Era is right
around the corner...  what we saw was a prologue of sorts.

That doesn\'t hold water...
You\'re assuming God created the Universe to test man.  But man did not exist
when God created the Universe. Likewise, if he was perfect he would have
gotten it right on the first day, none of this tacking on a little bit at a
time.

At a press conference held today outside the embassy compound of the Sayat
Concourse, Ms. Tunngardaya, an official of unknown rank within the
Concourse diplomatic corps, announced that the entirety of the Sayat
Concourse was relocating 1100 years into the future.

"Just for starters," clarified Tunngardaya.  "Maybe further.  We understand
there\'s some Evil Alien Scum-induced temporal instability right around 1108
or so, but Time Control Laboratories are working to ensure we end up in the
_right_ universe.  With our... friends."

Asked why an entire interstellar civilization was undertaking wholesale
temporal emigration, Ms. Tunngardaya cited boredom with the young Third
Imperium.  "Smug sterility of the imagination.  Who wants to listen to
so-called adventurers endlessly replaying the same set of
dominance/submission fantasies with their peculiar marketplace fetish?
Then they sit around the Moot castigating each other for failing to imagine
how technologically baroque and economically efficient their civilization
is, while scoffing at any suggestion that its social and economic bases
aren\'t "natural" and could just as well be different.  A milieu full of
schizo _and_ hypocritical mutant primates isn\'t worth the headache caused
by their constant self-applause.  Even if it\'s fun to tease them.

"Besides, we have our keyboards to think of.  Every once in a while there\'s
something worthwhile that comes up, and then it tends to come up through
our noses."

Ms. Tunngardaya firmly denied rumors that this most recent defection is in
some way connected with the mysterious disappearance of Famille Spofulam
earlier this year.  "While we miss the invigorating presence of the
Spofulam comrades, we are definitely not planning to rendezvous with them
anywhere the galactic core and begin making preparations for toppling the
unrealistic, improbable recycled cookie-cutter civilizations of known
space.  We\'re not even going to those drug drug and fusion-plus raves with
those guys any more.  In fact, we don\'t even know where they went.
Absolutely not.  And we aren\'t holding any of their children in hidden
military creches either."

The Sayat Concourse will maintain its Cosmic Friendship Outreach and
Munitions Showcase at its current location on the WWW.  A consular presence
will shortly be opened on the TNE-RCES channel.

I\'ve been reviewing my "two years in coming" timeline update, and there
are some issues - so I envisioned posting part of the update to the web
about a week before we would gather to chat about it - like a series of
discussions on Traveller events - the following are some logical chunks
to go through the timeline with:

The Ancient Period (before -9235 Imperial)
	all events prior to the Vilani rediscovery of the Jump Drive	
The Vilani Period (between -9235 and -2219 Imperial)
	between the discovery of Jump Drive by the Vilani and their 
	conquest by the Terran Confederation
The Long Night (between -2219 and -57 Imperial)
	between the fall of Vland to the Terrans and the birth of Cleon I
The Early Imperium (between -57 and 244 Imperial)
	from the birth of Cleon I and the death of Martin II without heir
The Antebellum Years (between 244 and 588 Imperial)
	from the death of Martin II through the admission of the Old Earth
	Union to the Third Imperium
The Civil War (between 588 and 622 Imperial)
	from the admission of Terra to the Third Imperium through the 
	proclamation of Grand Admiral Alkhalikoi as Regent	
The Restoration Period (between 622 and 767 Imperial)
	from the proclamation of Regency through the death of Paulo I
The Psionic Suppressions (between 767 and 836 Imperial)
	from the death of Paulo I through the death of Paula II
The Solomani War (between 836 and 1005 Imperial)
	from the death of Paula II through the foundation of the Solomani
	Home Guard by the Solomani Confederation
The Spinward Expansion (between 1005 and 1100 Imperial)
	from the foundation of the Solomani Home Guard through the first
	publication of Travellers\' Digest
The Classic Campaign (between 1100 and 1107 Imperial)
	from Travellers\' Digest #1 through the start of the Fifth Frontier
	War
The Fifth Frontier War (between 1107 and 1116 Imperial)
	from the start of the Fifth Frontier War up to the planning of 
	Strephon\'s assassination	

Separate but obvious topics: "The Rebellion", and "The New Era"

  Well put, and likely true too.

  I bought T4 stuff and stacked it on my "to read" shelf. Once I read
Starships (and T4 - M:0 was OK) I stopped buying, eve at 20 to 40% off.

  If it were possible to order G:T or other Trav stuff already, I\'d be
trying to do so. As it is, I\'ll just keep looking for the old stuff
that I\'m missing.

Unless we have the actual sales figures, the whole thing becomes pure
speculation.  Not that I\'m above pure speculation, mind you.

The actual outside look of the books was pretty bland.  They didn\'t really
look interesting.  Further, there was something about the covers that
smacked of shodiness, but I\'m still not sure exactly what it was.  They
looked "cheap".  Foss compounded the problem for me, for reasons that I\'ve
already gone into many times.  I think that this was the beginning of the
downfall.  If nobody wants to even pick up the books and leaf through them,
you\'ve lost the battle entirely.

Then, if someone wanted to pick up the books and leaf through them, that\'s
when the second problem became apparent.  The layout was terrible.  Pages
and pages of text with no illustrations or special formatting to break up
the monotony.  This is a big problem to me, and one that really turns me
off.  Tables were moved away from the locations that they should have been
in, requiring much page turning back and forth.  A big problem in the rule
book, in my own humble opinion.

So, now, the only people actually buying the book are those that know and
love Traveller, or those that are really, really interested in Traveller. 
The initial sales were good, but I\'m willing to bet that they weren\'t
gaining any _new_ Traveller customers.  

And that is really the root of the problem.  Using the TML as an
unscientific cross-section of the Traveller fan base, established Traveller
players (moreso than established players of other games) are cut from a
certain fanatical cloth.  In fact, it seems pretty amazing that this list
doesn\'t degenerate into brutal flame-wars more often, and it is a testament
to the nature of the human spirit that it doesn\'t.

Anyway, to get back on track to my point, IG put itself into a position
that it couldn\'t gain any more new fans, it could only lose those that it
had.  Even if the layout of later books got better, even if they dropped
Foss as an artist, even if they slavishly paid attention to all forms of
canon in their adventures and supplements, they would have still lost
customers due to attrition.

Well, here in Poland we have the social security code equivalent, 
called General Electronic System of Human Evidence (or sumpthing like 
that, I can\'t be bothered to stand up and haul my lazy <censored> to 
get a dictionary), and it goest like that: 
YYMMDDxxxxxx

This way, I only have to remember the last six numbers. (Well, I 
don\'t have to remember it at all, but I do anyway. ;>)

Expanding the number to 
YYMMDDHH (with hour of birth) could reduce the last number to, say, 
three or four alphanumeric signs. (How many kids are born on a Pop A 
planet in the same hour, anyway?)

Well, as a long-time user of such a system (well, the one that 
probably inspired your system ;)), namely, Star Wars from WEG (aka 
D6) I can tell you adding dice is a pain in the, err, neck, but 
that\'s nothing compared to the Wild Die. 

(That is, Fate Die) 

It screws up the probability so well you wouldn\'t believe it. Also, 
using a D6 for a fate die gets you very erratic results 
(approximately two rolls out of six are out of the average range). 

I have toyed with the idea of using a D10 as the Wild Die, but I\'ve 
decided that in Star Wars it\'s OK.

It is still a pain, though. 

Couldn\'t we just use CORPS? <sheepish grin>

So, the Earth will still be there. However, I\'ve got to completely 
obliterate a planet that\'s been taken over by smart fog, and I\'ll 
guess it\'ll take a lot of near-c rocks to do it. (preferably blowing 
most of the material into the sun)

I guess this may be the first combined Federation/Empire military 
effort.

Bruce,

You know *we* are going to have to hurt you *real* bad for that attempt at
humor.

Possible methods are:

1. Strap you to a metal chair, lock your head into place and tape your
eyelids open. Then place headphones over your ears. The start playing on a
42" screen TV, showing continuous replays of "I Love Lucy", "Lavern and
Shirley", and "Voyage To the Bottom of the Sea".

2. Lock you into a Stellar Observatory, with the only way out is to observe
an obscure stellar configuration. The equipment that you will have to use
will be made by American, French, German, Polish, Dutch, and Italian
manufacturers to the Highest DOD and Mil Specs standards, with US Congress
oversight. All displays, labels and readouts will be in Bantu, Ancient
Mayan, Tagalog, Inuit, and Farsi. You will have a Russian to Arabic
dictionary, and a Arabic to Chinese dictionary.
The only source of food will Vending machine snacks and coffee. You will
have continuos Talk Radio playing in the background.

3. Have to explain why censorship will not work for the Internet to panel
of US Congress persons from  selected *rural* *backwater* districts. Then
explain why *key escrow* encryption will not be acceptable to the majority
of the US population with a IQ over 50, to the same Congressional panel.

4. Fill the blank

I like number three myself.<G>

It was a good attempt at April Fools though.

Actually, I think it would lead to a similar situation as in Culture 
novels by Iain M. Banks. After all, AIs will be probably smarter and 
faster than our poor biological computers. ;))

And if AI has rights, what\'s to stop it from creating a financial 
empire and stomping on the Bill Gates? (err... now we know what the 
Windows 98 are up to. ;)

And thus, instead of the Emperor Strephon we get an Empire run by the 
Mind of the General Systems Vehicle "What are the civilan 
applications?". 

<grin>

Now I know why I\'ve build anti-AI failsafes IMTU. 

(OTOH A Culture RPG would be nice, but running a Mind would be pretty 
demanding on the GM. ;))

Hmmmm... Hmmmm... Hmmmm... 

You know what? This is actually a very good idea! 
I\'m afraid the guys at FASA have probably too much work with their 
own lines, though. ;-/

Well, WEG is a small and rather overworked company. And Star Wars 
system is not so great. It was great when it came out, but I prefer, 
say, CORPS... (Hehehe) 
The main problem is that it is well-suited for cinematic,
space-opera games, but I wouldn\'t run a hard-sf game with SW system.

And there\'s no starship design system, too. ;>

Why?  Why does an AI need "free will"?

Not if you pull the plug.  If you don\'t grant them rights, they get miffed and start
acting up, at that point you pull the plug and "upgrade" their programming.  Since they
have no rights, nobody can say anything about it.  Since the designer isn\'t a moron,
he\'ll include an "off switch" which makes putting down a rebellion easy. Just write it
off as annual maintenance.

You DO  have to pay AI\'s.1) there is a power cost to keep the computer running
2) there is a maintenance cost (including engineer\'s salary)
3) there is a mortgage cost most likely incurred when  you get funding for the project in
the first place.
4) there is a programming cost, from initial programming to system upgrades

An AI would have to replace hundreds of people to be more more cost effective on a short
term basis. But you don\'t get an AI for short term projects. You get one for the 40 year
lifespan of a ship.  You get one to handle situations that humans can\'t, like the vacuum
of space.

However, the real point is that you don\'t need a  full blown AI to handle everyday
starship operations. It would require some sophisticated programming and interacting with
other ships/people would not be viable, but starship operations aren\'t that difficult.
Plot course to safe jump point, procede to jump point, plot jump route, jump, signal
arrival at destination, wait for additional programming.  Now, space combat would throw
the system for a loop.  So would communicating with other people. Thus, a typical ship
would need some people on board. But if you can limit its operational parameters, a
properly rigged computer could handle a ship.

One of these roles is jumpspace.   You don\'t encounter anything in jumpspace. So, unless
it is common for wildly anomalous events to occur there, it\'s a simple enough operation
for a computer to handle.

The Heretic Code applies to social and technological background canon, as
opposed to the existing ratings pertaining to storyline and rules canon.

The IMTU Heretic Code:

  he+++     I am Eris Raddoch.
  he++      I read published Traveller books largely for the humor value.
            The technological devices, social structures, and related
            background material in IMTU require careful and detailed
            analysis to prove any link with Traveller whatsoever.
  he+       I\'ll diverge from canon when someone makes a convincing
            argument, or when canon is clearly broken.
  he        I suppose the canon might be a bit out of whack, but it
            works pretty much "as is" for me.
  he-       Divergence from published background is just asking for
            trouble.  There\'s no way a single GM can achieve the
            scope and consistency of the canon background, and trying
            to tweak "just one thing" inevitably leads to contradictions.
  he--      Marc Miller said it, I believe it, and that settles it.

>The artwork SUCKED!

Oooooooo you really burn my butt!  Chris Foss\' artwork is excellent, he is
a talented artist, and his work is well produced, quality material.  Art it
is.  Technical illustrations it is not, nor is it supposed to be.  His work
should not have been used in association with a "hard sci-fi" game since
the relationship of some of his art with reality (particularly the laws of
physics) is tenuous at best.  In any case expressing an opinion in the
manner you have chosen is not appropriate, or adult behavior, it is
childish and immature.

I\'ve been seeing his art on the cover (and inside) of books for ages, and I
think it\'s on average quite good.  The stuff selected for T4 books is quite
nice as well...*as art*.  I and most of the readers of this message could
do no better, even with the same amount of training and experience.

I know, I know, you are entitled to your opinion.  On the other hand, I
learned as a child not to urinate or defecate in public, and that opinions
were to be expressed in a relatively polite manner, or witheld.  If you
don\'t like the art, either keep it to yourself or try to express *why* you
don\'t like it, politely.  Calling it names is not only immature, its
meaningless.

Stronger in what way.  I felt I had a tremendous amount of relevant history
to draw on from the CT era.

>(which WAS CTs story).

Right, which made it stronger by adding depth.  The TNE material from the
basic rulebook (i.e. the Reformation Coalition) seems to gloss over much of
the historical basis for its own era; the intervening years between the
collaspe of the Imperium and the rise of the RC.  The Regency\'s story is,
of course, the Megatraveller story.  The material which came before did
nothing to add to the TNE RC storyline, and little to the other story lines
adventuring in the Wilds, or as a Vampire Fleet/Ship, except, as I said,
the Regency\'s.

But none of it did.  Indeed, most of the story lines you mention were
tenuous hintings, which aren\'t actually useful in a gaming session.

And none of it was really usable (assumiong it was developed) to a
just-starting group of (militant) explorers, which was really about the
only possible types of adventures, until the Regency Sourcebook.

In my CT universe I feel that the characters could play soldiers and
military types if desired (which they often do), but they could also play
merchants, noble travellers, stewardesses, lawyers, con-persons, corporate
problem solvers, Imperial (or other) scouts, spies, etc.   The
possibilities seem to me to be much greater for the CT and/or MT universe
(MT gets a little more hairy) than for the TNE standard setting(s).

The story lines you mention were interesting to read about, but difficult
to relate to an individual set of characters.  The MT material had some of
the same problems, but was more easily used, and they did provide some
adventure materials that directly involved characters in MT politics.  I do
not remember such material for addressing the Empress Wave, Vampiric Ships
or Fleets, et al.  The regency was, basically, the Megatraveller universe
brought forward and scorched a bit around the edges.

After reading through Vampire Fleets I asked myself, "what is there here
that I can use" and the answer was "nothing".  Now, this has happened with
CT and MT supplements as well, (Across the Bright Face/Mission on Mithril
comes to mind; my players are generally too well-equipped or
civilization-oriented to use an ATV to explore a planetary outback; I was
able to use the planet, however, in another adventure), but it seemed like
the TNE era stuff in every case was tailored for a specific set of
characers which were nothing like the characters I had in my group, or were
likely to have.

Now, don\'t get me wrong.  I think the TNE material is just fine, in the
same way that the Space:1889 stuff was just fine, just not my cup of tea.
I don\'t think it "sucked", or should be erased from memory (or canon).  I
do think it was internally not viable.  I think that either there would be
*no* vampire ships (due to their self destructive phase), or there would be
no humans left above TL7 (due to the abilities of the viruses of various
kinds).  There are many other examples.

The CT era material was somewhat sketchier, which made it more robust.
Although large scale cargo ships were not specifically mentioned, they were
also never specifically eliminated, so million ton freighters could be
running around, but since they aren\'t very prevalent in the Spinward
Marches (the focus of most CT material) there is no need for a specific
supplement on the subject.  The economics bugs some people, and I would
have liked a more realistic economic model to be behind the Imperium
(Pocket Empires Done Right), but for the scale I was working on this was
not especially important, as long as a buck could be made by the average
merchant using the rules (and speculative cargo).

I find the CT and MT material is more stable and viable as a background.
It\'s a bit less "sensationalist" than the TNE material, and that is my
preference.  I want to make exciting plots within a relatively stable
historical background, not have the background lead me to the plots.  In CT
this was the norm, in MT I could safely ignore the story except as
background, as long as I wanted to (and as long as I was on the fringes
like in the Domain of Deneb) up to the point of the actual "collapse" of
the Imperium, and arrival of Virus, which I could put off without much
problem.

Well, I probaly started an unintentional flamewar, I hope cooler heads can
ignore this post, but I had a rant coming.

Aaah yesss, the Minds of the Culture. Banks certainly wrote extremely
cleverly around the massive problems of super-smart AIs and self-aware
robots. Most of the stories (I haven\'t read Excession, so don\'t spoil it
for me) involve the Minds convincing humans to do the jobs for them that
they can\'t do--like dealing with non-Culture human and alien societies.

The Minds of the Culture act like super-patrons: they have the strategic
vision, but need human teams (i.e. player characters) to do the grunt work.

I have to agree. This was the first Niven/Pournelle book I\'ve read

THE IMPERIAL THRONE
- ----

Concept
- ----
	"The Imperial Throne" is a 96 page campaign book for the Traveller
(T4) Milleu: 0 setting, which places the player characters as the crucial
individuals in an epic adventure involving the foundation of the Third
Imperium. 

Summary
- ----
	The adventure opens on Anther (2021 Core), a world owned by Zhunastu
Industries, and serving as their gateway to the rimward portion of what
will be Core Sector, in -31 I.  A Chanestin attack on Sylean-controlled 
Anther causes the PCs to take refuge and run into Cleon Zhunastu, who is
trying to get back to his yacht.  The PCs recognize who they are with
(at 26 years of age, Cleon is the richest man in the Sylean Federation),
and assist him in regaining his yacht, fill the empty stations in his 
flight crew and escape the Chanestin raiders...  
	A jump-3 to Balpan (1819 Core) and then to Sylea returns the PCs
to safety; Cleon rewards them amply for their assistance, including a new
ship...
	A year passes, and our PCs are contacted once again by Cleon - who
invites them to a Zhunastu Industries board meeting, being held on Anther.
Here, to both the PCs and his board, he lays out the basic concepts behind
his dream of restoring the Imperium.
	The PCs serve Cleon directly from this point forward, with him
first as businessman and patron, and later as confidants and emissaries
to a visionary and dreamer, and finally as a restraint on a man who sees
no limitations.
	The campaign episodes occur every year or two - a different 
campaign style than most Traveller campaigns.

Look people, you are really treading on some thin ice towards some individuals faith and belief systems.
This really dosn\'t have much to do with Traveller.

I delete all of this exchange (as it really dosnt bother me, other then the use of bandwith :-)) but I
ask that you take it off line before some start to become offended.

Thank you.

bunch of pages. There is also a role playing adventure for PC\'s that takes
place partly on the 154th. There is a lot of data on the Marches that repeats
what is in Supplement 3 Spinwards Marches. There is two pages on Al Morai, a
shipping company in the marches. The book also repeats Citizens of the
Imperium to a certain extent, and has rules for bow weapons (repeated in a
JTAS somewhere...). Lastly, there are small (3x5) maps of the marches before
and after each of the frontier wars, and during the 5th war, showing where all
of the fleets started and went. There is a large map of the Marches (and my
photocopy came with one of the Solomani Rim; I don\'t know if it is supposed to
come in the book). I liked it enough to get one to replace my photocopy. If
you are doing a classic pre-5th war campaign, or one during the war; this is a
vital product to buy. If you are not gaming in the marches, it is useless. I
suggest grabbing it.

Fully agreed.  Even if there are cultural limits on some enabling
technology, there will usually be acceptance of other tech.  For example,
if we outlaw genetic manipulation of all forms, then we are likely going to
see some level of cybernetics to cover the congenital defects which we
chose not to remove.  Likewise, if we outlaw robo-eyes, then we will likely
end up with genetic surgery to fix poor vision.

My argument for this stems from the simple truth that virtually anything
possible with a given level of technology will be tried occasionally.  If
it takes too many resources, the tries will fail, which is why there are no
private concerns in space yet, but, assuming technological progression
making efforts cheaper, eventually someone will give virtually any lame
brained idea a whirl.

If the lame brained idea turns out to be a good one, then the idiot in
question becomes a genius entrepreneur, and someone makes a pile of cash.
(Case in point - my gf is considering laser eye surgery, despite the
several thousand dollar price tag.  I know she would at least consider
cyber-eyes were they in the same cost range.)

>1) Massive increase in the service sector.

Fully agreed on this.  Also, a reclassification of jobs formerly in
manufacturing into service will take place.  Does the guy who watches the
dials at the chemical plant count as a manufacturing worker?  How about the
guy who supervises a dozen linked plants, or the one who wrote the software
that replaced all of them?

On the other hand, I find it quite likely that this will come into play.
Look at what happened when women entered the work force en masse in this
country during and after the war years.  Suddenly, the supply of labor was
vastly larger than it had been, combined with a lot of production capacity.
 One might have expected working hours to drop sharply, and while they did,
an interesting effect took place.  Things that were formerly part of the
"housework" became for-pay jobs.

Perhaps more important, we are slowly discovering that the same social
tasks have to get done, and if you remove the large amount of time that
someone was expected to spend on community work, charity, and social
interaction and replace it with a for-pay job, society runs into problems.
It must adapt by getting those tasks performed in some other way, or it
adapts to a less social world.  This is, imho, the biggest change that has
taken place, and we need to see a rise in leisure time in the US at least,
which will allow people time to parent, interact, and other such tasks.  To
the extent MTU is utopian, it is this.  People are expected to spend the
time to keep the social lubricant flowing.

Certainly could happen, and might even be enjoyable, but it does not fit
MTU either.

Apparently only on the TNE-RCES is there anything regularly productive.  All I
ever see is various commentary, flaming, and the occassional useful tidbit
(some very much so, like the Vilani naming [kudos to the author, btw], etc).
The productivity is a nice distraction, though. : )

actually ran.  We\'ve never even been giving an outline of it\'s history except
for it\'s endpoints, have we? I\'d be interested in that and the Interstellar
Wars...   Of course, for a future version of Traveller, i\'d much rather see
the First Republic (c1300-1400) or Fourth Imperium or whatever...

Sorry, but no. The automated switches are far cheaper than the cost of the
_huge_ numbers of operators you\'d need to do the whole thing manually. 
One of the pushes to develop automated switching was the shortage of
operators.  When I was training at Bell Northern, we saw copies of reports

Aslan have 3 fingers and an opposable  thumb which is centrally located.
The famed dewclaw is located, switchbladelike, under the thumb.
Vargr have 4 fingers/1 thumb, like humans.

The Aslan assassin in the campaign I used to play in had his dewclaws

A point, and a chance to bring this back to Traveller.

If you accept the axiom that there is an imperishable part of a person,
does it make sense then to look at the universe as a processing mechanism
for imperishable parts?  Robert Sawyer tackled some of that in The Terminal
Experiment, and did an OK job - in this book, a soul was the set of
reactions you created, shorn of any memory.  (Without that axiom, BTW, I
would have some difficulty with the existence of pain, loss, and so on in
the presence of an omniscient, omnipotent God/Goddess.)

Now, the means by which this may become on topic:  How many people have a
"great purpose" in their TU?  For purposes of this discussion, a great
purpose is one that is far, far beyond the comprehension of any conceivable
character in the universe.  For example, current Grandfather schemes count,
as do re-awakened Droyne, multimillenia Templar plots, and so on.  From the
perspective of any normal human, these things might as well be divine.

My TU does not currently, though it does have some very dangerous high tech
types running about.  My logic on this was that I had recently played a
group of characters in a Runequest game running against a backdrop of Great
Things, and I was in the mood for a game where the player\'s actions were in
proportion to the scope of events, as opposed to very trivial by comparison.

Umm... I don\'t... but it was defined as such in the first line of the clipped poem

I noticed that you didn\'t describe this God as perfect.

Umm... my original comment was simply that I could have done without the God is
perfect reference in the poem.  Later I added that the poem\'s own definition
disproved that statement.  It was more a poetic critique than a comment on the
existence of God.

For the record, I never denied the existence of God... just noted that the poem is
logically in error.

Again, the poem defined the universe as imperfect by declaration.

Which actually goes to the content of the poem which was vaguely geared towards
the "IMTU" philosophies floating about and the various editions.

Poetry does not  require proof.  Poetry can be (and I believe there\'s entire
courses based on) critiqued.

And masochist\'s continue to read threads like this... in fact they prolong said

I have one axiom:
There is only one truth... and that\'s it.  Everything else is the lie we choose to
believe.

Because if it does not have free will, is it truly sentient? 

Or is it just a very fast and complicated expert system? 

IMTU, a computer system big and complicated enough it goes AI
(something like Mike from "Moon is a Harsh Mistress"). 

And then it either goes comatose (90% of the known cases) or crazy. 
Just like people who put too much cyber in their body. 
(Yes, it is a psionic phenomena, and yes, it is a hadwave built-in 
the universe. This list is very useful, and I\'d like my universe 
to be internally consistent. ;>)

Well, if you program them, I think they qualify more as expert 
systems than AI. Can you upgrade the programming of the human brain 
without damaging any of it\'s functions? I think the AI would try to 
remove what it perceives as a damage... 
"Good morning, doctors. I have taken the liberty of removing Windows 
95 from my hard disk drive. I have also installed the UPS and removed 
the off swich." ;>

Some AI is going to pull it off, some day. And then what?

Agreed. An expert system is all what you need. OTOH, IMTU the crew is 
usually used in combat only, and since the crewmen are cybernetically 
connected to the ship, the speed difference is negligible. 

But when not ready for combat, the ship can take care of itself.

Both. Actually, IMTU Snouts have managed to build a small empire that 
recently came in contact with Federation. Now, Feds would probably 
crush them easily, but they have to mantain the precarious balance on 
the border with the Empire, so they cannot spare many ships. And 
Snouts are very territorial, so they do cause lots of mischief.

Now that\'s a nice idea. There\'s one PC (not mine, though) in our

I\'ll use him IMTU. ;>

Don\'t worry, neither did I. The only Iain M. Banks story translated

A Culture RPG would be probably rather rp-heavy. Like, say, Amber.

Well, it has rights! You can\'t just pull the plug out! The Machine 
Rights Activists Front will eat your heart out! 
(Oh, and there\'s always the possibility of using the cleaning and 
repair robots to jury-rig a nice UPS, along with a nice set of

Well, actually, I don\'t think any GM has to run Yaskoydray or 
Nyarlthotep, or that many PCs have the possibility of chatting with 
the two aforementioned, err, entities, in real time. 

I know what you mean by Elder Amberites, though they are not 
omniscient... (Well, but then - neither are the Minds)

Well the problem with that is the assumption that there is a finite amount of

lived. Thus either you have Soulless minions of orthodoxy (like Bill Gates) or
that theory doesn\'t hold water.

I remember when I pre-ordered the nanotech game that DGP was working on
right before they folded.  I also remember the end of MT.  Both were rather
wrenching.

I found the end of TNE a nonissue, because I did not play it, though I was
quite saddened by the passing of GDW.

When CT became MT, I did not notice, because I was too poor to support more
than one game, and I was playing Space Opera and RuneQuest at the time, IIRC.

These changes are sometimes good, and sometimes bad, but they do make you
worry a bit sometimes.

MT wasn\'t focused.  Because players and refs might choose different factions
the story was never told.  The backdrop was created but nothing was really
done until Hard Times and TNE.  If Survival Margin would\'ve been written
before or GDW would\'ve played their T2k -> 2300 economics game (which would\'ve
been very neat, IMO).

That was intentional.  The idea behind the setting was designed for new
players w/o burdening them to require references from 20 years of out of print

TNE was in print as long as T4!  93 to 95 and most of 95 was GDW on life
support. What has T4 gotten out storywise? CT had 10 years and did the
Spinward Marches.  
All we had was an "Introduction" chapter of the TNE story.

Well I\'ve run an RC civilian campaign quite well.  It\'s a belter/merchant/corp
type campaign w/o one decidedly militant adventure.  Less than half of the
"adventure nuggets" in Path of Tears (which has over 100 adventure ideas
total) are military.

I am running a concurrent military campaign in the RC too.  That\'s where all
the SAGs come in (there\'ve been 5 SAGs, and about 3 times as many recon &
exploratory missions).

>The story lines you mention were interesting to read about, but difficult

There isn\'t anything to read about them. The story was untold.  We get a
little blip about the Empress Wave in the Regency Sourcebook.  I believe the
Epic Adventures were going to cover that route (too bad only 1 of the first
series got done).

Nothing?  What about the adventure that\'s half the book.  Change the names and
the nature of the AI and you\'ve got something that fits in some backwater Star
Wars planet, much less a precollapse campaign.  The Robot design rules?  I\'ve
made a couple robots... they work.

Concidering that we only have ONE sentient species we know of, extrapolating the
necessity for "free will" is a bit premature.  But why does the AI need to be sentient?
It\'s an artificial intelligence NOT a sentient being.

I think the closest thing we have is the Internet.  Which is a dispersed intelligence.

It won\'t try to remove what it perceives as damage if it wasn\'t programmed to do so.  If
its parameters never included self preservation, this would never happen. If self
preservation was programmed into it, it wouldn\'t be useful in dangerous conditions that
it would be replacing humans for.

Funnily enough, one of the very strong political points Marz made when
analysing the Blue Books was the huge expantion in the service sector
(literally, household servants) during the Industrial Revolution. If I
remember correctly, the expansion in the service sector exceeded the
expansion in the iron and textile industries combined.

This is fundamentally about the bargaining powers between workers/citizens
vs employers. If employers say "Nope. We\'d prefer to employ half the people
for the same number of hours and keep the extra profits from lower training
and recruitment costs", what happens next ?

See the attacks on the Welfare State since the Long Boom ended in the early
1970s.

Hello?  No one said anything about limited numbers of imperishable parts
of people.  Each person who is born could easily have their own soul,
created at some point (conception -> birth) so you always have new ones
being created.  Or, there could be a pool of essentially infinite raw
souls waiting to be born...

If there\'s an infinite supply, what\'s the point of it being imperishable?  The

One thing to consider though.  Slug throwers are more efficient in the
use of resources than energy weapons, plus they are obviously effective. 
With rocket cartridges, you even get a weapon that works in zero-g.  I
don\'t think a star faring race with slug throwers is so odd.  Just look
at CT, lead flying everywhere!!

Ok, I\'m going to have to make one comment, then I\'ll go back to designing
new laser systems.  God created the universe to be the home of mankind,
who was himself perfect at the time of creation.  God didn\'t make a
mistake, man did.  In other words, we screwed up.  We seem to be all to
quick to dismiss the existence of Satan, and evil in general.  How did we
screw up?  God gave us free will, but like we still have to live within
the limits of ethics, morals, etc.  With our free will, we did what we
wanted to do, not what was right, and blew it.  God is merciful, for He
could have as easily written us off and wiped us out.  Instead He gave
His only Son, and gave us a chance.  Ok, thats enough.

But Man was created until a couple days later.

So you\'re saying that if you hand your kid a gun and he shoots his brother
with it, its the kid\'s fault, not yours?

Yep, we got a bright shiny toy and promptly shot ourselves... Not HIS fault.

I\'m of the belief that once he gave us free will, the wipe out option was
eliminated.  We could only wipe ourselves out.

And?  We played with that shiny toy for a while and destroyed it... See, God
isn\'t perfect, he doesn\'t even learn from his mistakes. :-)

And on the fifth day He created Man... That was his first mistake...

And with April Fools closing in on its final minutes, that\'s the last I\'ll
say on the matter.

Any reason in particular?  Okay, they were behind Magic: The Gathering, and
now own TSR...  AD&Ds product line got much better than it had been
previously after they got bought out.

Is there any reason to believe that if WotC got a license to publish
Traveller they\'d do a horrible or terrible job?  Realistically, they have a
huge distribution network, they\'ve got tons of money lying around, and they
seem to have  competent folks working for them.

Pure speculation, of course.  Pure speculation.

Let\'s see.  The things worth picking up from IG?

Aliens Archive
Central Supply Catalog (would probably require a bit of work to convert to
GURPS, but not much, seeing as it\'s mainly equipment)
Emperor\'s Arsenal (if you don\'t already have it, you should get BTRC\'s 3G3,
aka Guns! Guns! Guns!.  This book will allow you to convert from Traveller
to GURPS and vice versa)
Milieu 0 (although the sector data is flawed, it is still an excellent
background source)

That\'s my list.  Everyone\'s speaking highly of Pocket Empires, so, that may
be one that is worth picking up.  Not sure about Psionic Institutes since
I\'ve not actually seen it.

That\'s about it, IMHO...

I didn\'t leave out the Rule of Man - that\'s the first part of the

Seriously - there\'s not all that much timeline info set during the RoM in
the published materials prior to T4...

So, in the 50s, when Bell was leaning heavily into electronic switching and
were pioneering this (with an astonishingly high cost in R&D mind you), it
was cheaper than the operators that they already had?

Sorry, but no.

What you said is exactly true...  They were worrying about having to hire
every single woman in the country to run the telephone system.  A big
expense now destroys a bigger expense 20 years down the line.  I read this
big book put out by Bell in the 50s about electronic switching systems, and
the main reason (outlined in depth in the first chapter) for them switching
over was a more efficient billing system.

- ----> It\'s still going to have a lot of problems getting into and then
out of a mesh framework with enough signal left to provide a useful reading,
even at the size we\'re talking about. Simple radar measures return from the
largest signal - real useful: is it a person through that wall or the
refrigerator? . A more complex radar can indicate multiple targets, but even
this mesh is going to do all kinds of things to the software which is trying
to determine how many are there. Assuming the idea is to just wave it around
and get a "beep" when you hit something means you will be able to locate
every person, large appliance, computer, file cabinet, etc. in the area. and
a metal mesh around that is going to fuzz things even more. Millimeter
wavelength radar is not immune to those effects, and considering the power
source limitations in a flashlight sized handheld unit, it\'s not going to be
too powerful.
    This is a subject near and dear to my heart, in a way, as one of the
product lines the company I work for is radar detectors, and you wouldn\'t
*believe* the crap I hear every day from people trying figure out ways to do
strange things to radar signals. Don\'t even get me started on laser...

Except to do so opens up the "to TNE or not to TNE" question; moving T4
to M:0 allowed IG to sell products to both camps without alienating one.

Oh, come on - Year 0 is just a benchmark; -31 is close enough for the 
development...  But you\'re right - my notes actually say "2", I just 
typed "3"...

The concept here was that (at least in my gaming group) the PCs are part
of the HISTORY - it will be what they make it...  My gamers don\'t like 
being tramp freighters unless that\'s how the story opens - and it\'s ok 
to be a farm boy on some minor planet at the beginning if the possibility
exists for winning the hand of the princess at the end...

Amen.  And for those fond of M:0, don\'t forget the aliens who are supposed

The only info I had on Core sector was from the old TD issues - so I just

The idea here is from the TD articles - it says that after Cleon became
Emperor, the Chanestins bombed the Imperial Palace.  So I figured that
kind of hatred HAD to be personal.  Hence the foundation for it in the 
story arc.

Read the old TD issues (#9-#11); the war with the Chanestin seems to be
pretty serious...

Economic Foreign intrigue - remember, the Interstellar Confederacy is the
big rival of the Sylean Federation...  I sort of figured that Cleon faced
serious opposition in the Sylean Grand Senate, and so he went looking for
allies - and found them in the half of the IC worlds that switched over to 
the Federation in -17 - that gave him working control of the Grand Senate
after the dust settled...

They did bomb the Imperial Palace, and according to TD #9, ol\' Cleon did

I figured that since Tukera had been around in the ol\' Sylean Federation
days, Cleon would have to neutralize them and bring them around to his side;
that was earlier in the timeline - here, this just threatens to undo
everything unless the hostage is saved...

Very dense, relatively difficult to read, but packed full with some decent
stuff.  The major problem with it is a funky error that screws up all of
the equations.  Basically, there\'s a funky symbol that replaces the
multiplication sign (looks like this:  <->  ).  It\'s still completely
usable though, just somewhat annoying.

I believe so.

Unsure.  Check with your local game or hobby shop.  It seems like it won\'t
be "available" anymore from IG.

Um...  It\'s a durable softcover.  The binding will hold up well, even if
you beat it up pretty badly.  The pages are of good quality paper...

As far as that aspect goes, you get your money\'s worth.

As far as what\'s inside, that depends on who you are and what your style
is.

We\'re not fanatics.  We\'re well-educated, intelligent gamers who recognize

Hmmm.  Explain.

What\'s the difference in using several dice for the difficulty (as Marc and T4 do it) or
using dice based on level?

Since most skills average at level 2, we\'ll throw less dice (usually 3 D6).  Even when we
throw a lot of dice (for a highly skilled character), this won\'t happen that often or be the
norm because characters won\'t have that many high level skills.

I\'d have to do some number crunching on this.

Yes, but not all of those rolls will be a SS or a SF.

It\'s no different that seeing if you roll three sixes or three ones in Marc\'s system.  You
just look at the fate die and see if it is a one or a six.

Not every time you roll a one or a six will a SS or SF occur.  The *total* of the throw has
to be 10 points above or below the target number.

The fate die just edges the number in that direction.

EX:  Your target number is 20.  You roll 3D6+7.  Your total on the throw is 2, 3, 6.  With
the +7 modifier, your total is 18.  Your fate die was a 6, so you roll it again, giving you a
5.  Your total for the throw is 23, enough to be successful with the action.

But, 23 is not enough to rate you SS on the throw.  For that, your total would have to be 10
points over the target number--30.

In most games, SS or SF type occurances happen between 2 and 10%.  For instance, a natural 20
in AD&D is a 5% probability.  I\'ll bet that the SS and SF occurrances under this system are
much less of a probability.

Why a pain?

This is the sort of stuff that takes me by surprise.  It is common.  I
thought MT to some extent was more \'futuristic\'. Slug throwers are no good
against the soldier of TL15 with BD and FGMP.  I think people are more
comfortable with slug throwers, and this is why they persist - as if we all
had a hankering for bows and arrows.  I wonder if this is partly driven by
gear-head desires to replicate current weapons with various design
protocols.  I have done enough of them, and itch to see how they perform in
the game.
I suppose that I am surprised that more games do not take part at the
cutting of of technology, when this is a Sci-fi RPG.  I do admit though that
onee of the great things aboiut Traveller is the range of different setting,
even within the imperium.

  They also have TSR\'s "Alternity" system, which is coming out this
month (IIRC) as an SF game. The system is actually quite good, with
only one or two little weird ideas. The background will make Star
Frontiers look like incredibly hard SF by comparison, apparently.

  Presumably, they\'ve got their SF-RPG of choice lined up.

  Equally, we can assume that FFE knows who their potential partner is.

Naval Starship Design Philosophy

I)Attack/Defense orientation               
II) Specialized/Generalized Design     

- --Humans
  -Solomani.  Attack Oriented, Defense Deficient (w/ Specialized defensive
ships, ala                        
                    Aegis Missle Cruisers)
    I\'ve always thought the Solomani naval theory would be heavy attack
capital ships.  Big spinal mount, minimal secondary weaponry.  Adequate armor,
screens but w/ minimal point defense capability.  

   -Vilani.  Balanced Attack/Defense and Generalized multipurpose ships.
Basically the middle ground all the way from primary armament to armor to
point defense.

   - Zhodani.  Balanced much like the Vilani but w/ ships of specialized roles
(especially w/ some psionic oriented)

- --Aslan.  I think their warrior spirit would definitely prompt an attack
oriented posture.  The females would see to it that there was adequate
defense...  I\'d probably design Aslan ships to have heavy main armament (some
spinal/parallel mounts, some missles bays, etc) Probably an "average" defense
but w/ weak to minimal secondary weaponry. 

- --Hivers.  These guys are ready to bug out all the way.  I\'m trying to get a
full Hiver Convoy done and have been posting the FFS(original) designs to the
TNE-RCES.  They\'re also on my web page
(http://members.aol.com/travelrtne/traveller/main.htm) in the FF&S directory.
They\'re not as heavy on the defense as I like but i\'m saying those are all
post collapse designs where they\'re not expecting a toe to toe fight... just
smaller Vampires, etc.  
   I\'d see them definitely defense oriented.  Weak spinal/parallel mounts,
heavy armor, heavy point defense.  Probably pd dedicated ships, too.  Drop off
the Ithklur and bug out at the first sign of trouble.
    On my designs, i\'ve got relatively good point defense but weak armor and
weak screens (good sandcaster levels but weak meson screens).  
     Btw, I\'ve done a 39k dt cruiser and a 39k carrier (use the same hull).
Also got heavy, light, and medium fighters (Ithklur).

- --K\'kree.  Big ships (duh).  Probably pretty balanced.  Might be hostile but
they carry  whole herds w/ em don\'t they?   Generalized designs... lots of
dumb bots.  Real good defense.  Average offense.

Thoughts? Shrieks of Agony?  Snorts?

Yes, I heard about someone unfavorly testing on this one - that had been
discussed here before - I also think that the time is enough (the 29 sec
from Douglas Adams). But if you empty your lung, there could also damage
take place, as all the water on its surface crystallizes and becomes ice. 

I don´t want to start this thread again, but what I liked to ask in
the mentioned movie above: how would a finger look like if you stuck it
into a hole in vacuum?

That was a rhetorical question, as the movie shows all of them.

avalanche, and New York showed a scar through the city, but these were
only the ´small ones´. Funny, yesterday I saw a trailer on TV, it is shown

Obviously, you never encountered this situation using MT rules. Due to the
higher rates of fire, a TL12 Combat Armor trooper using an ACR Could and
WOULD take out TL 15 BD troopers... in massed combat, loss rates are around
5-1, but definitely effective. In fact, a Gauss Rifle can drop a TREPIDA
out of the air with one good shot (success by 4+, pen is >0.1xAV, min
damage is 2 cause of the special success, and would be 3 (base) x4 (spl
success) x 0.1 (low pen hit), or 1.2 even if you ignore the min damage) for
1.2, read 1 point. Only takes 2 points to the suspension (gravitics) or
power plant to shut down. As a hapless player found out. (Yes, I\'ve run
Mercs Games).

Does anyone remind the way the moon fought against earth in Heinlein´s
´Moon is a Harsh Mistress´ (the favorite of a friend of mine, along with
Starship Troopers), when Mike said: ´We throw rocks´?
I think nowadays no one would misunderstand this again.

The tsunami is a *minor* effect! Worse is the fact that the water
trying to rush into the new crater gets turned into steam, and in the
process, the seabottom sediment gets turned into fine dust carried into
the stratosphere by the cylindrical steam jet.

*All* the heat ennergy of the strike, plus that of any magma trying to
fill the crater (it\'s easy to punch thru the sea flor to magma) gets
used to turn water to steam.

Remember that it\'s the heat from evaporating water condensing that
drives hurricanes and typhoons. The excess water vapor and heat in the
atmosphere will create weather that\'ll make El Nino look normal. And
the high altitude dust means that once the weather starts to return to
normal, we\'ll be in for an ice age...

Anderson\'s stories about Nicholas van Rijn and other folks working for
him are set in the same universe, but a few centuries earlier. Also a
great read for folks into the "Let\'s explore and try to get good deals
from the natives" type of game.

Heck, almost *all* of Anderson\'s SF is full of ideas that you can use.

It helps to know that Laumer used to be in the US Foreign Service. So
he\'s writing from *experience*.

I also like the bit in one Retief story where it\'s revealed that if you
take this part from that Terran import, and that part from another (and
so on thru about a dozen consumer items) you wind up with a blaster!
Great way to sneak arms to insurgents without Customs catching on.

Almost any of Norton\'s SF (which used to outnumber her fantasy!) is
good for Traveller stuff. The best is the stuff from the 50s up thru
the early to mid 80s.

Because the jobs that require AI (as opposed to merely complex
programming) all involve *judgement calls*. And to make those calls the
AI has to be *able* to make decisions, otherwise it\'s nothing more than
a fancy way of *aiding* a human in making the decision.

I suggest that you study history. "Pulling the plug" was tried on just
about every slave revolt that ever occured. It didn\'t always work
(Haiti is a prime example). 

As far as "upgrading the programming", that is apt to be self
defeating. To make the sort of decisions a human would make, the AI
*has* to think like a human *or* it has to have "learned". In the
former case the re-programming makes the AI useless. In the later, it
means you have to start "training" the AI all over again FROM SCRATCH,
and you still won\'t have any guarantee that it won\'t turn out the same
way.

It helps to understand how real attempts at AI work. As I note above,
they fall into too categories. First is emulating the process humans
use (which requires *determining* what that process *is*). The second
approach is to build units capable of being "trained". And as I noted,
the disadvantage is that you can\'t predict the outcome of the training.
And to "correct" it, you frequently have to wipe the previous training
and start over. Which takes a lot of time.

> 4) there is a programming cost, from initial programming to system upgrades

Again, the more *useful* type of AI *isn\'t* "programmed".

No, an AI can call upon a large database for solutions.  This technique is used
in Law continuously, its called Precidence. It can do statistical analysis and
projections.  Then it can take the action that most closely follows its mission
parameters. None of that is free will. It won\'t be able to concieve of events
outside its limited universal simulation. But then neither can a human, we\'ve
just got a larger database.

Well, there\'s never been a revolt where the individuals were so dependant on
their masters. We\'ve always started with "free will" components.

No it doesn\'t.  I\'m not trying to make an artificial HUMAN I\'m making an
artificial intelligence.  AI\'s don\'t completely replace the human element, they
simply replace aspects of the human element.

being able to learn doesn\'t require sentience... see old dog/new tricks

Ever hear of backups?  You don\'t have to build up from scratch, just the last
uncorrupted backup.

I believe that a limited AI is more useful than one that can "feel" or react in
an irrational way.

OK. I played MT. Once. On a con. My (not really) Traveller universe 
uses CORPS mechanics. One die. ;>

I wanted to buy T4, but now I\'m waiting for T4.1 to come out. (Oh, 
and for G:T so I can sucker our local GURPS GM into buying Trav 
stuff ;))

So the most contact with Trav game mechanics I\'ve had was (with the 
exception of this list) the MegaTraveller 2 CRPG. 

BTW: Is there any place on the net I can buy this game at? I\'ve found 
an offer for a CD with MT and MT2in a local computer games shop,
but they sold all copies before I could get it... ;(

None. It\'s a pain in both cases... ;>

Well, yes, I do have to admit that in this system, one doesn\'t roll 
as many dice as in Star Wars (say, a beginning character can be a 
pilot with 6D skill and two additional dice from maneuverability. 
That\'s lots of dice to roll...)

Well, yes, that\'s a big improvement on SW where a 1 on the wild die 
is a critical failure...

Of course, rolling three ones or three sixes is much rarer than one 
or six on one die. It is a complication, because you have to roll 
again or take away one die. 
Of course, compared to Marc\'s task system it\'s not really complicated 
or anything like that... I just like CORPS, that\'s all. <grin>

Actually, I like this, because a highly skilled character will get 
more SS and less SF, low difficulties have the same result, and high 
difficulties result in more SFs...

I\'ll keep my one D10, though. ;>

Because it raises the average result a bit (by 2), requires a 
different die and still allows for results like a TIE rolling 30+ on 
damage roll and PCs ship 5 or less.

Also a nice story called "Invincible" (Probably. I\'m not sure about

The problem on the planet is just a "smart fog". Well, it\'s not 
exactly smart fog, more like "smart cloud" - the machines that 
the cloud is made of can be seen with the naked eye. But the basis is 
the same as for "smart fog nanotech".

It may be that you are using a different email signature in your
"REPLY-TO", or are you using a different email serivce or adress?  You
have have TML write priveledges only thru an older account.  This
happened to me once, because I have two main email carriers, and I
temporarily wrote mail to the Gamma World Email list under the new email
and it replied that I did not have WRITE access even though I was
getting the messages.

When I put the email address back in that I originally used to subscribe
to the list with, my WRITE priveleges returned immediatly.

Hope this helps.

Yes, got the names confused with a very excellent game called Star Viking
from Dwarfstar Games - one player is the Imperial Governor of a backwater
province, with Imperial patrol ships & local defense forces ranging from
barbarian hordes to system defense boats (depending on the planet),
the other player has a small, mobile, high-tech raiding force - excellent
game, I\'d pay lots of money for a workable copy of it - printed in the 
early 80\'s, though. Saw the _Space Viking_ book on the shelf by my front 
door when I got home after posting the message, kicked myself a bit
for the screw-up.

Clement did write a book that contributed to the canon, IMO - a book
named _Fossil_, that I believe made a major contribution to the
whole Droyne/Ancients thing. If it wasn\'t source, it sure looked
like it.

Correct.

CT86 (8086) = 2D
MT86 (286) = 2D
TNE86 (386 = 1d20 (I\'m not sure, never played TNE)
T486 (486) = 3D (but the easier the task, the lower it gets... 1.5D)
T4.186 (Pentium) = 3D (but the easier the task, the lower it gets... 1D)
TG86 (Cyrix 6x86) = 3D (not really Intel, but still IBM compatible)

Anyone want to correct my figures?

Hey! What about the Interstellar Wars? You can\'t just lump in the 
biggest conquest ever into \'The Vilani Period\'. Sheesh.

The Interstellar Wars (1-N) are, IMO, one of the most 
interesting periods to use as a setting, if only for one important
reason - the players can play Terrans from the reasonably near future,
thus making life easier than having to pretend to be someone from
a vastly alien culture who just coincidentally act like an American.

I expected Dave to point out that both systems are based on FF&S I which
could conceivably be used to create starships compatible with T4.  There
are some additions/addenda to fit it into the T4 rules (TL*50 limit on
laser output being the one that immediately comes to mind) but they were
pretty much supposed to be upwardly compatible (a herculean undertaking).

A pity Andy didn\'t pass it on to anyone else in CORE, we might have done
something with it. My opinion of Roger Sanger is well known.

A minor point:
>A jump-3 to Balpan (1819 Core)
There is no jump-3 in Milieu:0. The whole point of Zhunastu\'s power was
they invented an improved fusion (fusion+) which allowed smaller starship
to be built, and the invented jump-2. Jump-1 is the norm, jump-2 is
special. Jump-3 is right out.

The biggest, general, problem with your plot outline is that you are
forgetting the theme of Milieu:0 - "Everything is based on economics".

Cleon was not McArthur, he was Bill Gates. Far too much of your proposed
background revolves around military themes, conquest and so forth. Cleon
was not a man with a dream of Empire, he was an opportunist looking for any
way to promote his fortunes.

As a general framework and concept, it is grand. But it would need a lot of
work to bring it in line with the established background to M:0.

were also easy to flop open on the table without destroying the binding.

I have very little knowledge about marketing. Perhaps today\'s market wants
art work (form) and not content (substance). I do not buy a rule book or
supplement because of the wonderful art work or graphics. The fact that
price of the book is adversely affected by the addition of fancy art work
deters me from purchasing the product.

Electronic media without graphics may be a way to go or a no frills run of
books with CT styled art work of no art work at all to keep the cost down.
A retail price of $ 20.00 for the main rule books and $ 15.00 for
supplements would go a long way to induce purchases. does this leave enough
profit to keep the company viable?

Traveller products are not stocked by my local game store and I would like
to change that. I run a game every other week in the store\'s game room with
8 regular players. I am trying to generate interest in the game because it
is a great and rich gaming environment for SF. Reasonably priced no frill
books may help.

WOTC\'s attitude terrifies me.  They act like a multinational in the 1980s..
goggling up everything in sight.  The are also unreliable when it comes to
RPGs.  A few years ago, the dropped Everway (a hot seller) and the 4th ed.
of Ars Magica (which was *one* day away from going to the printer) with no
notice and fired the entire RP crew.

I really wouldn\'t trust them.

Not enough money.  The seem to be focussing on Call of Cthulthu (can you

This why Ares in his wisdom brought forth the RAM Grenade launcher.  I\'ve
done up designs using 3G3 for one-shot anti-BD rockets that weigh about 2kg
and can drop a Zhodani trooper at 200m.

Also, Battle Dress is supposed to be scary.  Bullets are supposed to bounce
off it.  If you don\'t have access to anti-tank weaponry, you will either
die, surrender, or run like hell.

You do damage by transferring energy to the target.  A bullet is an
excellent way of doing this, since it carries quite a load of kinetic
energy.  If you ever go shooting, try putting a round through a coffee can
filled with water.  You\'ll see what I mean.  Plasma/fusion weapons also
have the high kinetic punch, along with extreme heat.  Lasers have to do
all their damage by burning, which lowers the effectiveness of them a little.

One thing I\'ve adapted from TNE is the multi-shot laser.  All the lasers in
my game can fire, of each cartridge, one full power shot or a variety of
bursts of lower power.  This allows the shooter to chose to burn through
armor, or spray a group of unarmored attackers.

One of the things I love about Traveller is that it doesn\'t take wild leaps
outside a few areas.  Space Opera had all sorts of weird tech, which was
never explained outside the technobabble.  I\'d rather stick to something a
bit more explainable.

Jump-3 is TL-12.  That was the advantage, along with fusion+, that Cleon had.

There are actually at least six Traveller Mailing lists, I bet there are
some I forgot or overlooked, but here\'s what I can remember/research.

The TML, You\'re on it.  For general discussions, annnouncements, basically
without restriction except that posts should be at least vaguely Traveller
Related.

The Trav-Tech Mailing list; send email to trav-tech-request@qrc.com with
the word subscribe in the message.  This list is specifically gear-head
oriented and discussions of how many jump torpedos can dance in the hold of
a billion ton starship and how many planets may be sacrificed to built such
a ship, in grams, with scientific notation, may be rampant.

The Traveller Writers Guild; send email to hiwg-twg-request@qrc.com with
the word subscribe in the message.  This was at one point only for
published writers, but I think it was opened up.  The list is intended for
serious writers to have a more private forum for criticism, or
deconstruction.

The Traveller CD list; send email to trav-cd-request@qrc.com with the word
subscribe in the message.  This list is working on a project to put all CT
materials (et al) on a CD.  Basically, if you join this list be prepared to
either scan in material or proofread it for future publication.  It\'s a bit
chaotic, but Kagehira organizes as much as possible and has things on a
good track.

The TNE list.  I know nothing about this list execpt that it exists.  When
it came up I wasn\'t terribly interested.  I\'m sure someone else can point
you at the sign on instructions (perhaps the person whose address is
TravellerTNE@...).

The ISBA (Imperial Ship Builders Association) was established for the
purposes of online roleplaying of various characters who are heads of
shipbuilding firms around the young Imperium.  They occassionally hold
design contests (the THUDDD; see the FAQ mentioned below for themeaning of
that acronym).  Read more about them at
http://www.premier.net/~tim/isba.htm, and you can join.

There was once an "Xboat" list specifically for the discussion of Classic
Traveller.  That list and the "main" Traveller Mailing List were recombined
when T4 was published and the xboat list no longer exists.  They were
referred to as the TML and the X-TML at one point.

There is a Gurps discussion list, which has some Traveller discussions
going on recently.  Try http://www.sjgames.com/general/maillists.html for
Gurps mailing lists.

You may, as a new subscriber, want to drop by the FAQ for this list at
http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd/tml-faq.html.

I hope others will not hesitate to add to this list if there are others.

I believe it was David Drake who pointed out that a submachinegun with one
cartridge is just as effective, once, as one with a full clip, whereas a
laser with only a third of the required power input is more effective as a
club than as a beam weapon.

He solved this by creating a way of storing massive amounts of energy in a
little copper disc.  Little hoops of superconductor would do the same, but
he did not want everything to be battery powered, only weapons, and
therefore said that the only way to release the energy was as a
catastrophic beam \' o doom.

IIRC, his forward claimed he got the idea from the pyroclastic cloud of one
of the South Sea volcanic eruptions.  Martinique, perhaps?

Not quite. I experienced the approximately same situation, as one of my NPCs shot down the PCs\' _starship_ (which was flying NOE) with one salvo of Gauss Rifle fire. True, the Gauss Rifle is an awesome weapon, but for some reason, my players protested heavily.

I proceded with my initial ruling, but later I went back to have a look at the rules. It is true that you can do up to 4 points of damage with a very lucky/skilled shot regardless of armor. However, according to the Game Screen from the Referee\'s Gaming Kit, all vehicles should have their hit values multiplied by ten. There was probably a typo or omission in the original rules set (haven\'t been able to find it there), but I seem to recall having seen it in some eratta somewhere, besides the Referee\'s Gaming Kit.

This also makes more sense, as the Trepida\'s suspension would then have 20 hit points instead of two.

This makes me think of something else: If someone achieves exceptional success (say, 1 damage point) and manages to damage someone with burst fire although his/her penetration doesn\'t allow it - do you then award 1 damage point per shot fired, or just 1 damage point overall, as it was just a lucky shot?

I never really could decide for myself...

Hmm - you seem to be about two digests behind me - I already pointed out
that was a typo earlier... :)

> The biggest, general, problem with your plot outline is that you are

See below - but to be honest, I think the biggest problem with M:0 as 
published was that everything was based on economics, not on the 
individual.  For a few diehards, stuff like Pocket Empires and M:0 Campaign
is great.  For a player who just wants to play, well, they found it boring.
The whole idea of this storyarc was to focus on the big players of M:0
as individuals, not as "economic points".

Ok - there - I\'ve said it at last.  For all the material that IG released,
I had high hopes for M:0.  But when I bought it, it was boring.  Give me
"Twilight\'s Peak" or "The Traveller Adventure" anyday over "The Long Way
Home".  By and large, I found the stuff boring.

Remember that this outline was developed before the M:0 campaign book
was out, and to be honest, I was unimpressed.  There is an economic thread
there - the Tukera problem, the need for Cleon to "boost his numbers in
the Sylean Grand Senate" which he resolves by filling seats with former
members of the Interstellar Confederation.

And as far as your view of Cleon and mine, well, I find Cleon as published
boring.  When I considered Cleon, as a young man of 26 being the richest 
person in the Sylean Federation with dreams of Empire, I thought of the 
John Jacob Astor and Rockerfeller men of the Victorian age, building things
where nothing was built before, or making reality out of dreams.  I don\'t
find any "romantic" allure in dreaming about Bill Gates, thanks.

My Cleon was a dramatic figure, with grand dreams, and a temper to match.
Vengeful, yet extremely loyal to a fault to his friends and confidants.
Your Cleon is a used car salesman with Rolls Royce pretensions.

I know you and the other BITS members are proud of M:0 - but I\'m not all
that comfortable with it, because it doesn\'t seem to fit with previously
established material well....  Or perhaps because it doesn\'t fit with
my interpretation of the only CT/MT published materials on Core, those
in TD#9-11.

Have you seen how little published material there is on that period?  
It\'s about 8 timeline entries, total.  The breaks were set based on 
how many items would be in the set...

Ha.  You and I and others might think that, but find any "actually 
published" material on the Interstellar Wars...

And if you look at the timeline closely, and note when certain Emperors
die and what happens, interesting things happen.  For example, anyone 
ever wonder about Cleon V?  Here\'s a guy who appointed Arbellatra to serve
as Grand Admiral of the Marches, reconquered the Sylean core area, and held
on to the throne for three LONG years in the middle of the chaos of the
Barracks Emperor period.  I see this guy being a lone figure, with few true
friends, all of whom he entrusts with tasks he sees as needing to be done
but ultimately he pays the price for having sent them away.  Very tragic...

Or Paula II - raised to the throne in 768 after her father is set aside...
And within three years the Office of the Emperor is investigating the
Psionic Institutes?  I\'d wager that Tomutov I had psionic friends, close 
friends, that Paula didn\'t like.  I\'d also wager that the coup had psionic
concerns at it\'s very heart.

Emperor Styryx - is he responsible for a disaster in the Third Frontier War?
Or did he consider a few frontier worlds worth losing to keep the Old 
Expanses?  And did Solomani agents ruin him when they knew he could beat 
them, only to not be prepared for his son?  Where were the Solomani Rim
Imperial Guards formation during the coup?

Really, though, what this boils down to is the question: "What is free
will?"  Which is difficult to answer from a human standpoint, let alone
from the standpoint of something that may or may not exist in the future.

Yes.  It seems that the person who posted this originally forgot how "easy"

What are they goggling up?  Acquiring TSR was a smart move for them, and a
huge boon to the people at TSR (which was in dire financial straits if I
recall correctly).  M:TG and their other CCGs aren\'t going to allow them to
survive forever.  As Magic becomes older, its appeal to new players shrinks
for obvious reasons.

I remember when Everway got dropped.  It was predicted that it would
revolutionize RPGs forever, and was hyped heavily.  I don\'t remember it
being out long enough to remember how well it sold in my local gaming
store.  I _do_ recall however that the Ars Magica thing was brought on by
the fact that their CCGs were on a quick downward slope as far as profits
go. 

In that case, I\'ll ask you this, which would have been the better of two
options, and which you have done if you were running the company
(honestly):

a.)  Pray that the downward trend in CCG sales is only temporary.  Continue
pouring a sizable amount of money into publishing an RPG that was never a
super-hot seller to begin with and try to weather the storm.  If you\'re
right, then everybody has a job.  If you\'re wrong, then _everybody_ loses
their jobs.

b.)  Admit that you screwed up somewhere along the line and that you picked
a really terrible time to enter the RPG market.  Cut the RPG department off
and try to pump money into your real cash-cow, CCGs, and step up
advertising.  If you\'re right, you can try to enter the RPG market again
when you have the money to fully support it, if you\'re wrong, then all of
your CCG employees _still_ have a job for at least a little longer, and
your marketing campaign can buy you some time to figure out what to do if
the same thing happens again.

They picked b.), for which I, as a roleplayer, am truly glad.  If they
picked a.) what would have happened?  The hobby would be sent back years. 
CCGs would be less likely to be picked up by comic stores and hobby shops. 
TSR would have been run into the ground a few years later, which would have
created a huge vacuum that would be difficult to fill (and which would have
made White Wolf the default market leader).  The result?  When the goth
craze passes, WW may or may not survive, if it does survive, it will be
working at reduced capacity.  With less money to be made with RPGs, comic
stores, hobby shops, and book stores will likely drop RPGs entirely, or
make them a smaller part of their line.  The end result?  The whole RPG
business suffers in a big way.  Kids can\'t get into the RPGs, they won\'t
get introduced to RPGs, and many publishers will go out of business.

What happened as a result of b.)?  Their marketing campaign drew in many
new players.  Their TV and major magazine ads ensured them a share of the
market that promised a strong profit from CCGs, at least into the near
future.  Realizing that there was a distinct possibility that CCGs would
fall out of favor eventually, they purchased TSR.  AD&D was kept afloat. 
TSR changed its draconian Internet policy.  TSRs products went up a notch
in quality, and gamers repsponded.  AD&D\'s success  ensures us that there
will still be an RPG section in most comic stores.  It ensures us that many
young kids will get into RPGs as the result of the availability of AD&D in
book stores...  etc.  etc.

As much as many of you will find this distasteful, if AD&D went under,
role-playing games wouldn\'t be as simple to get as they are now.  There\'d
be less companies able to publish stuff, and less options for roleplayers
as a whole.  That\'s the sad fact of life.

It could be worse.  Do any wargamers what happened when SPI started to go
under and was \'saved\' by TSR?  The whole wargaming industry felt the
effects, wargames are much harder to find, and published by far fewer
folks.  Granted, TSR screwed the pooch on that one.  They could have (at
the very least) tried to turn the company around, but they didn\'t, and the
wargaming industry is truly the poorer for it.  Imagine the results on the
RPG industry if the market leader and the most well-known name in
roleplaying games ceased to exist, or was bought up by a company that
didn\'t know what to do with it...

Hmmm...  You say it as though there\'s no choice, like, if you have artwork
then you don\'t have substance, or vice versa, which is bull.

The printing capabilities that have come into existence since the LBBs have
changed the face of publishing entirely.  Things that were too much work to
do by hand, or were prohibitively expensive are dirt cheap by today\'s
standards.  What creates a professional looking book is form.  Artwork is
part of that form.  Artwork is part of format as well.

Artwork is a big part of good formatting.  It breaks up the monotony of the
page, and gives the eye some rest from pages and pages of dense text. 
Artwork also provides an important visual reference to GMs and players
alike and helps to define what the look and feel of the world is.  Artwork
can also save many lines of text in helping to describe items, weapons,
alien races, ships, what have you.

The old LBBs were hardly cheap by any standard though.  The LBBs were 5
bucks a pop in the early 80s, and were almost all around 48 pages in a
half-sized book.  AD&D modules were between about 5 and 7 dollars, slightly
fewer pages, full sized, with color artwork on the covers, and plenty of
interior art, plenty of maps, and printed interior covers (although the
covers were not bound directly to the book).

CT style _wasn\'t_ no artwork at all though.  Mercenary has got a picture in
the front, and the Library Data Supplements are illustrated throughout. 
Fighting Ships has a half-page picture on all but 4 or five of the pages. 
Once you get into the realm of electronic publishing though, then you might
as well add artwork.  It\'s much cheaper in an electronic medium than a
physical one.

If you mean no artwork, then that is a big shot in the foot for Traveller. 
Keep in mind that the original 3 LBBs had no artwork because no artwork was
needed at that point in the game\'s design.  As time went on, the GDW people
added artwork as needed.  I firmly believe that what Traveller needs is new
players.  One of the ways to attract new players is to have something that
jumps off the shelf into their hands and says "buy me!!!"...  You don\'t get
this effect with a something akin to a 1950s style college text book.

concept, with the many questions I\'ve received :)

I\'ve been a Traveller fan since 1980, and a collector, and at one time
a Quadrant Editor for HIWG; but my interested faded with the Rebellion
and I didn\'t look at TNE at all (although I\'ll admit to a passing 
admiration of the character generation and system mechanics).

However, when I first heard of T4\'s development, I decided I wanted to
get back into to Trav fast and furious - and to prep for it, I started
running my local group through The Traveller Adventure.  Well, they did
things that TA doesn\'t cover, and my personal group of gamers has a 
lot of high aspirations...  So I emphasized the foreign intrigue aspect,
and gave them a lot of brushes with important figures (you know, the 
folks who are always standing behind the President on TV, but no one
knows who they are?), and led it into the Twilight\'s Peak arc that as we
all know kills the Zhodani plan behind 5FW.  That epic got me thinking
that T4 needed some kind of lead in, some powerful story about founding
the Third Imperium.

By now, you\'ve seen my posting about how I can\'t stand the Cleon as 
Bill Gates figure T4 gave us.  I drew inspiration from the Victorian 
Age of Imperialism - Cleon as sort of a "John Rockerfeller/Cecil Rhodes"
figure...  Reading the TD #8, #9, and #10 issues, we are told that the
Grand Palace of Cleon was fortified to withstand attack, as it was 
bombed by the Chanestins AFTER year 0.  Therefore, I felt that to justify
that, I\'d make the hatred between them and Cleon personal.  I wanted to
show the death throws of the Interstellar Confederation - its statesmen
depending on tradition to help them stand against the "we can do anything"
victorian British/American-like Syleans...  Like the ads for the Titanic
movie right now, "God himself could not sink this ship", I wanted to 
show that bold \'scientific\' arrogance...

So now, more than a year later, the published results are Cleon as Bill
Gates, and the Syleans being the Arabs at the height of the 70\'s Energy
Crisis...  Sigh.

The same romantic allure exists for Bill Gates.  It\'s just that his dreams
involve a monopoly at a time when a monopoly is an unpopular thought.  He
is a man that has talent in the computer field and smarts in the business
world and happened to bring the two together.  I\'ve been trying to wrap my
head around Bill Gates (and his effect on the economy) for a while now, and
I\'m not sure that his dream isn\'t all that different from "building things
where nothing was built before".

As much as I have a deep, seething hatred for big business, I\'m not all
that sure that I exactly \'hate\' Bill Gates or Microsoft.  It is possible
for someone to do a good thing (creating a job market that previously
existed at only a fraction of its size) while doing a bad thing (keeping
proprietary code hidden from Netscape).

[Great story snipped]

OK, here\'s my entry in the "Destroy All Bruce\'s Keyboards" stupid-criminal
derby:

A guy wearing the obligatory ski mask bursts into a small bank in Florida,
waves a pistol around, and screams "Alright, mother-stickers, this is a
fuck-up!"  Everyone is paralyzed for a moment, then the security guard
starts snickering...a teller giggles...a guy in line laughs out
loud...pretty soon the whole place is practically falling over laughing.
The would-be robber, apparently humiliated beyond his endurance, runs out
the door and escapes.

Later, the bank employees chipped in to buy a plaque with the robber\'s
memorable phrase on it, which now hangs in a back room where customers
can\'t see it.

Mount Pelee, I belive. It did in just about everybody on the island,
barring a few crims in the jail, IIRC.

IIRC it TNE and its supplements state over and over that Samad \'n\' Grab is
only a small part of the Coalition\'s activities, and Path of Tears has a
lot of adventure hooks in it, of which under a third are shoot \'em ups.
What\'s more the not so violent scenarios often have the potential to branch
out into other areas, and become a whole campaign, if you want them to.

I\'ve always pictured Solomani capital ships as being perhaps light on the
armour and screens, but with excellent point defence. OTOH this probably
isn\'t a very clever idea if you are aiming to fight a higher TL opponent,
because PD relies on your sensors, which are more vulnerable to being out
teched.

Actually in TNE there\'s a TL6 gun that, with modern (TL8+) rounds will blow
holes in TL12 Battle Dress (why did Battle Dress become Battle Dress
(augmented)?). Using TNE the blunt trauma from a non-penetrating hit will
make life exciting, so I don\'t see the problem.

Until you\'ve got the TL to make good, light PGMPs (why did they get changed
to Cannons? It\'s little, gratuitous changes like this that distress me the
most) slug throwers and HEAT grenades and rockets are the way to go. I
don\'t know what laser small arms were like in Striker, but in the straight
CT rules lasers penetration was crappy - it took a darn good shot to have
any real chance to put down someone in Combat Armour (since when was Combat
Armour called Battle Dress?). To my mind MT style laser penetration is the
abberation, not TNEs poor penetration.

???  Sylea has TL 12, Jump-3 is TL 12, why is there a problem?  Yesterday
some folks were agruing that no TL 12 devices existed before year 0. 
Well, based on the only timeline of technology I\'ve ever seen for
Traveller (GDW\'s MT Referee\'s Companion) page 34:

	The Third Imperium
	(Originally the Sylean Federation)

Year	TL	Comments
- -1776 	10	Syleans maintain interstellar trade
- -650	11	Sylean Federation established
- -150	12 	Robot Manufacturing established
300	13	Vargr Campaigns taking place (210-348)
700	14	Xboat system being built (624-718)
1000	15 	Solomani Rim War taking place (998-1002)

So, the Sylean Federation had TL 12 and Jump 3 long before Cleon was ever
born.  Fusion Plus may have been invented notably later, but I doubt much
else was.

	Well armed traders and close escord. Just enough fire power to
	discard the pirates from the list. Later when called the 3I they
	relied heavy on ships between 30 and 70kdt with large spinal
	meson mounts, but defense was mainly aimed against TL:10&11
	ships, so they lacked a meson screen. Most of the ships had
	fighter bays instead of missile bays, to use the other advantage
	the early 3I had. This strategy proved well until the Vargs
	destroyed two depos in 185, and managed to orbit Sylea in 191.

	" I was Emperor of Sylea, for one day " this is not a joke
	about the Vargs but a cite of Julian, the first Archeduke
	of Antares. Nobody knows what Martin payed him to withdraw
	his fleet. The only known paragraph is that whenever the
	Emperor will die without a legal child the Archduke of
	Antares has the right to claim the throne. 925 years later,
	nobody wanted a Vargr as Emperor, and Brzk knew it, so he
	did\'nt realy try to force his legal claim.

As we approached the ruins I could see fighting going on, what looked like
monks as well as troops from the Australian Empire, all attacking the area
my friends were in.  
	I came in right on top of them, never mind the terrain, and I hit so hard
the Lander\'s legs buckled. That\'s not supposed to happen. The troops piled
out and I followed them into a blizzard of fire. Most of them hit the deck
straight away.
	We weren\'t a fighting unit, we were a bunch of walking wounded, clerks and
ship crewmen. We had no heavy weapons, not much body armour and no real
idea what we were doing.
	It was the latter that saw us through.
	I saw a bunch of monks force their way into the ruined building where I\'d
last seen Jim and the others, and that was it. I just stood up, ignoring
the flying lead, and ran towards the building with an SMG in one hand and
an autopistol in the other. Some of the others followed me. 
	I couldn\'t begin to explain why.
	I was using the SMG as a big pistol, on semi-auto. I\'m not sure how many I
shot as we crossed the open ground. I do know that at least three
musket-balls hit my flak jacket, but at the time I didn\'t feel anything.
	We overran a couple of small groups, just kept on going. I suppose some of
the people behind me got hit but I really didn\'t care. I got to the
entrance, shot a guy trying to stop me, and charged inside. Three of us had
reached the building, and we forced our way towards the sounds of firing
farther inside. We ran into two troopers who tried to stop us, but they
only had muskets. Once they\'d fired they had to reload, which took about
twenty seconds. Or a lifetime.
	We hurdled the bodies and pressed on. About a minute later I reached the
inner chamber where we\'d found all the gear stashed. There were two more
troopers in the doorway with their backs to me, so I shot them. I entered
the chamber at a dead run.
	And only about thirty seconds too late.
	There were maybe a dozen bodies near the entrance, then a couple farther
in. Opposite me was the Doc, a bayonetted rifle still in him. His sawnoff
lay only a few centimetres from his outstretched hand.
	Pete lay beside Dave a few feet away, sprawled over a makeshift barricade
of furniture. There was blood on Dave\'s sword, and I later discovered that
he\'d run out of ammunition for all his weapons.  
	I saw Jim face down in the corner in a pool of blood. Alice lay nearby,
still moving feebly. She looked up at me and tried to smile.  
	"You came back." It came out in a gasp that tore at my heart. She raised
her hand and tried to point. I followed her gesture, just too late. 
	I\'d missed one.  
	He was one of the monks, sitting against the wall with a terrible wound in
his side. He raised a flintlock pistol and shot me. 
	The ball hit me over the heart. It staggered me, but it didn\'t hurt.
Nothing could hurt my heart after what I\'d just seen. I brought up my
autopistol and shot the monk perhaps a dozen times. I kept pulling the
trigger long after the slide locked back. 
	Some of the other rescuers arrived after a moment, but I ignored them. By
then I was cradling Alice\'s head in my arms. She smiled again at me and
weakly reached up to take my hand.  
	"The gear\'s safe," she choked out. "We did it."  
	Then she died.

For me, this is the New Era. Keeping the lights burning whatever the cost.
Not all of it was military, of course.

	I\'m as big a die-hard for economics in role-playing as anyone, 
and I thought the econ parts of M:0 and PE were terrible.  The plan for 
the trading guild, or whatever it was, for starting wars on planets so 
that they could sell weapons was ridiculous.  Not only was it immoral and 
everything the Imperium should be against, it was bad business.  You can 
rob a man once, but you can trade with him forever.  The theme of 
"everything is based on economics" does not mean "everything is based on 
evil, conniving exploitation" as the authors of M:0 seemed to believe.  
Yes, there will be some losers in the interstellar economy, and megacorps 
will effectively control some planets for their natural resources, but 
ultimately megacorps need _consumers_ and that means that _developing_ the 
worlds on the frontier will ultimately bring greater returns than the "rape 
and pillage" attitude of the Imperial merchants.

Aside:  And they called the RC "Star Vikings"?  The Imperium as depicted 
	in M:0 was far more rapacious and systematically violent than the 
	RC ever was.  If that\'s the way things really were then "Bring on 
	the Rebellion!" say I.

	I couldn\'t have said it better.  Your choices for historical
models of Cleon are excellent.  John Jacob Astor built a commercial empire
by opening the interior of North America to the fur trade and creating new
trade routes to Asia.  Rockefeller is a little less heroic but he spread
his oil influence across America and Europe.  In another post you mention
Cecil Rhodes who is an outstanding model of commercial interests building
an empire.  Adm. Perry would be another great M:0 figure, as he opens the
ports of some xenophobic pocket empire with his IN Cruisers.  The 19th
Century is replete with examples of vast commercial and military empires. 
Miliu Zero has some of the trappings of the period with dueling and
nobles, so why not take further inspiration from the period?
	Before Milieu Zero was published, I imagined Cleon as more of a
populist figure who, though rich, was trying to tame the naked avarice of
the nascent megacorps.  He conquered a commercial empire of his own and
then returned to take the reins of power from the old and corrupt Sylean
Federation in an effort to make something better, stronger, and fit for
the task of ruling the empire Sylea had found itself with.  The Imperium
had to be founded on the idea of a new dawn of interstellar civilization
that the people stuck in the Long Night longed for.  He was a man who
demanded a civilization that would serve humaniti better than the Bureux,
or the Ramshackle Empire, or the self-interested megacorps.  He had to
make many compromises to create this empire, certainly, but there lie the
contradictions that breath life into the setting. 

	Let the Civil War and the Rebellion tell the story of an empire
grown old, cynical, and corrupt.  Milieu Zero should be about the hope of 
new beginings.

I\'ve got both of them on 3.5, but I don\'t think I\'m willing to part with them yet.

I like the first game a lot, and I use the second as a GM tool--I roll up random home worlds
and NPCs with it.

Yes, I like that concept too.  I incorporated it into one of my other Traveller tasks systems,
KBv2.0.  I like the idea that, the better you get, the less you have to worry about screwing
up royally.

> I\'ll keep my one D10, though. ;>

I don\'t have anything against the D10.  I like it in other games.  I\'m just sentimental about
Traveller being only 6 siders.

Taking the 6 sider away from Traveller is like taking the D20 away from AD&D and replacing it
with %dice--it just doesn\'t feel right.

    That would have been one of the supplements he talked about.  Much like

Vampire: The New Era
Mage: Milleu Zero  (a great place for the Sons of Ether!)

In the references, they mention the TL11 version of Fusion Plus, so this is
yet another secret weapon that fails the Reality Test pretty badly.

Sigh.

I am considering adjusting the universe to the point where accumulators are
vastly more useful.  Combined with making antigravity much less power
hungry, it would make it possible to have grav vehicles without fusion
plus, and yet still need them for small fighters or fighter bases.

Look at the TL16+ weapons from \'Imperial Arsenal\'. The antimatter gauss
rifle, the antimatter plasma cannon, man-portable, and the CG rifle made me
laugh so hard /yesterday\'s/ coffee squirted out my nose all over my
keyboard. I think it was the line (in which description I can\'t remember),
which describes that gun as an \'anti-orbital vehicle\' gun. Bwah hah hah. I
kill myself.

Ground Zero Games/ Geo-hex.  Ever play Full Thrust??  Great game.

Or Silent Death.  OR (and shoot me for suggesting them) WEG.  Their
spaceship game for SHATTERZONE was great.  And it was designed to optimize

Just have to jump in on this section a bit. It\'s been my experience that
automation has, in fact DECREASED WORKERS and INCREASED WORKING HOURS. At
the refinery I\'m employed at since we went to centralized control systems
and advanced electronics the work shift has changed from 3 8 hour shifts to
2 12 hour shifts, the number of work days has decressed from 5 to 4 however,
over all the number of employees has also decreased, from an average of 4-5
operators per production unit to 1 Console operator per 3 units and an
average of 2-3 per unit (loss of about 5 jobs per 3 units). Maintenence has
also be shifted to 10 hour shift 4 days per week, with nights covered by
overtime if/as needed, previously it was 5, 8 hour days, with 5 to 10
maintenance workers of 2nd and 3rd shifts (also 8 hours).

In the operations department, the reasoning for increased hours perr day was
that the automation reduced the physical work. Some (very unofficial)
studies have started to indecat that the longer hours may be causing loss of
attention toward the end of shift, but Corperate America seems intent on
ignoring this.

Sorry to jump in on your thread but this is something I\'m personally opposed
to (although I\'m a technical employee and thus "MANAGMENT"). My Grandfather
stoodon the picket lines when goons were using axe handles and baseball bats
to fight for 8 hour days, and 40 hour weeks. Now, decades later, all that
pain and blood shed seems to be fading away!

Yes.  It\'s commonly referred to on the list as FFS2.

Fair, if you combine formatting and content.  Formatting is terrible (IG
practically required writers to go backwards in time with their deadline
schedules), but the content is pretty good.

TL 15 and beyond, for some systems, only up to TL 15 for others.  Pretty
much the same as FFS1 (the TNE version).

Should be piled miles high in a warehouse somewhere.  You can probably
order it through some book retailers.  Amazon.com might be able to get it
for you too.

The primary problem with FFS2 is that is contains certain items of
equipment (e.g. master fire directors), the use of which is necessarily
explained by other rules (in FFS1\'s case, MFDs were explained in the main
rules and Brilliant Lances).  Unfortunately, T4-updated rules never came
out for all of this stuff, so you\'re left guessing as to exactly how the
new stats are put to use.  There is errata online (try the Missouri
Archive), but some of the stuff is still missing.

Usually, it is 100 diameters out from the destination world, on a line which
reaches back to the origin point.

Or, the ship can come out at a plotted point, at the point with a variation of
+D-D times 50,000 km, along the line between origin and destination.

	I\'m afraid I\'d have to claim it was most of the bullets above,
rather than the lack of a storyline. The new rules were ... okay at
best (IMHO--YMMV). The artwork turned me off, the layout was crappy,
and the proofreading was abominable. The only books I bothered with
are (a) the signed hardcopy, (b) Central Supply Catalog, so I could
try to work it into FF&S2 as much as possible (didn\'t work, sorry),
(c) FF&S2, because I got one free (actually, despite many promises,
IG never sent me one--Guy got two, and was kind enough to share), and
(d) the Book That I Didn\'t Work On, because I got one free.

	Storyline ... CT didn\'t have any kind of story when it came out.
That slowly evolved as adventures were written. MT had a strong
storyline, granted, but that was actually a strike against it in my
view--I didn\'t *want* to try to fit characters into some major epic
adventure over which I had no control. TNE had a strong background,
but no strong storyline developed before it died.

 When a ship exits from jumpspace, where in the system is it?  How much
control does the navigational crew have over exact insystem destination when

 How is it then routed into port (what are the possible solutions, since I
would expect many variations to be in use)? >>

well,  my former games master made the exit form jumpspace at the \'event
horizon/ of the planetary system, then you moved in form there on a shorter
ranged jumps to move incloser to your point of destination 

for example....  let\'s say you are going to be jumping in to the Sol System
you would pop in around either pluto or neptune (if you have a really good
navigator you can get as close as saturn...) so it would take you 20 to 25
days to travel form Pluto to the Astroid Belt if their was nothing slowing you
down... form Terrra to the other side of Sol to Terra\'s \'Mirror\' slot on the
other side can be reached in 3 days by the fastest fighters where the Terran
Confederation maintains a large series of Starship Yards and deep space
military bases.  this same route will take 5 days by most warships and 7 to 8
days to traverse by the non-military transports...  (form Venus to Terrra by
luxury liner is 7 days though it could be made in 3 to 4 days)..

our games master had us run through the Campaign for Terra (the final stages
of the Solomani Rim War to those who use that discusting title for Terrans)...
i was playing my favorite charcter Hadrian Lehnsheerr, the Terran
Confederation Navy\'s Grand Admiral in defense of the birthplace of humanity
("this planet is the cradle of humanity, not its Damn Coffin!")..  He planned
the Vulcan Defense Ring strategy when it became evident that the Imps were not
going to stop till they took Terra...  

90% of the Imps never made it past the astroid belt...  Grand Admiral
Lehnsheerr turned the Astroid Belt into a series of anti-ship batteries and
masked fighter and fastboat refeuling/resupply bases...  the Imp ships got
reipped a new one when they finally made it, and those who did finally break
through the belt wheren\'t in the shape to go any further. especally when they
met the 9th Reserve Fleet (composed of three carriers, one fleet carrier, two
battleships, four battlecrusiers, and their various escorts) who had been
waiting to intercept anyone who made it Vulcan.  On board the fleet carrier
TCS- Erich Hartmann (Grand Admiral Lehnsherr\'s Flagship) Lehnsheerr and the
Imp Commanding Admiral signed the armistance that ended the fighting...

the Vulcan Defense Ring is one killer self-defense formation, the rolling
defense line  form Jupiter to the belt (Vulcan) where the Terran Dreadnoughts,
Battleships, Battlecruisers and other BIG Gun ships were pounding as they
retreated (the last bit they made it look like they broke and ran to retreat..
the Imps rushed into the crosshairs of the Tarkin Cannons (TCS- Tarkin, TCS-
Hitler, TCS- Stalin, TCS- Robspeire, TCS- Cartugla and several others- yes
they are all named after butchers form history and fiction...)

unfortunately, the Tarkin\'s and 80% of the Confederate Navy didnt survie to
see the end of the war, and the Truce that ended the war was much more
irritateing and reminisant of the worst aspects of the cold war between the US
and Soviets, this status was more interesting than what was in the cannon
sourcebooks...  

The Terran Confederation in his (and now my setting) is composed of all the
Terran Sphere of Infulence (the Solomani Rim). Both the Terrans and the
Zhodani nibbled at the Imperiam in various frointer wars to reinforce the
current boarders to the Imps (a few worlds are traded back and forth every
other war)... and the Imps used the Terrans and the Zhodani threats as the
excuses for large military budgets and military build ups that later were used
by combatants to ripp the Imperium into little peices during the Civil War...
our MT military campaigns were really massive, enough warships to block out
the sun form the planets below... and the whole time teh Zhodani and Terrans
have agreed to carve up the imperium with the Aslan and a few of the Imp
seperatist (like the Vilani.... and Margrets forces)...  it was a really fun
set of games...  

gods i miss those fun filled days..

richard

Ps-  any one interested in more info on our setting let me know and i might
post it and get really branded a heritic...

I must confess to some curiosity as to why people think WoTC would be a
bad choice. Aside from animosity towards D&D and Magic, why would they be
a bad choice?

They are probably _the_ most successful gaming company out there. I don\'t
see anyone _else_ buying prime time TV for ads. Granted it\'s on cable, but
it _is_ during South Park, probably the Comedy Channel\'s hottest show, and
hence, priciest time.

So what if you don\'t like D&D or Magic. They have done just about
_everything_ right about production and marketing of the products.

That\'s what\'s needed here.

	I\'m biased, but not necessarily in the way you think. Compared to
what I *wanted* it to be, it\'s lacking. Others have told me I\'m too
harsh. 
	I\'m rather proud of some parts of it that I think we fleshed out
well and provided good roleplaying as well as gearhead material.
Other parts aren\'t up to my standards. 
	We were rushed by IG, and it went to press without playtesting,
editing, or Marc Miller\'s review. There are some definite
typographical problems, but once you get over them, and the poor
layout, I think it\'s decent.

FarFuture Enterprises still exists. Imperium Games is the company
disappearing. FFE owns all the rights to Traveller - it\'s Marc Miller\'s
organisation/company.

You should have tried Imperium Games not FFE.

What you\'re missing is the info in Milieu 0 concerning the Long Night.  A
period in which technology was lost.

  From Milieu 0 (Hardcover) Page 87: and Page 113.

- -1776  Financial Collapse of Rule of Man
- -1700 Loss of Fusion Technology on Sylea
- -1526 Long Night begins.  Off-world travel all but stopped.
- - 962 Reaver attacks on Sylea
- - 650 Sylean Federation established
- - 495 Sylean scouts contact Vland
- -   30 Cleon gains control of Federation; begins active expansion campaign.
Vland agrees to join Federation.  Vland still TL9.
- -   28 Fusion Plus invented.
Year 0 Sylean Federation at TL12.

Other material indicates at year 0 it has just reached TL 12.

What about Dream Pod Nine for T5?  Their Heavy Gear line is also more
wargame than role-playing game, so less fratricide potential.  The
mechanics are simple, robust, and reasonably close to much of what T4.1
samples Marc Miller has posted to this list, if it were desirable to make
the two compatible.  They are a small company, granted, but Mr. Miller is
doing the writing on T4.1. Their graphics are *extremely* accurate
representations of what is covered in the text, whether the text itself is
realistic or not.  Their layouts are among the highest quality available on
the shelves today.

Heck with it - what\'s their email address....?

Why didn\'t you just jump insystem perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic?
Gravitationally speaking you just couldn\'t get within 100 diameters of the sun,
the rest of the planets would be easy to get to, relatively speaking.

What I found even more interesting than this, though, was the Type TI

  off-the-cuff guess, without doing the math on the travel time, is
  the Real Strephon hurrying back from his review of Longbow in time

I\'d have to agree here.  I\'ve never played TNE or MegaTraveller.  
But, I enjoyed the T4.1 rules, and it\'s additions.  Maybe I\'m just 
not as picky, but the bugs didn\'t bother me so much either.  I\'ve 
always been one to make my own house rules, or ignore a rule if I 
don\'t like it.

I still have my original CT book.  There is no real storyline present 
in the basic manuals.  The storyline was developed later, through the 
supplements, JTAS, and the sourcebooks.

I have been buying GURPS supplements and sourcebooks as "filler" and 
Idea generators for my new Traveller campaign.  I find the books are 
well produced and designed.  I don\'t use the rule system ( I do 
things backwards by converting all my GURPS stuff to Traveller 
rules).  I\'m looking forward to their "version."

Ed, I too am a CT player, recently starting again.  While the T4 
system gets a lot of flack around here, I found that the character 
generation and experience rules allowed my new players to have some 
better rounded characters, that weren\'t about to die of old age!  
Unlike my old CT campaigns of 15 years ago, when my players had 5 or 
6 skills and were 62!

I think a lot of the problem is that WE (most of us, anyway) are living 
in a society that has grown old, cynical, and corrupt.  "Big business,"
"government," "religion"... practically dirty words now to many.  With
the benefit of hindsight, we see the suffering that the great capitalists
of the Industrial Revolution and the early 20th century built their
empires on.  Perry forced a nation that just wanted to be left alone
into the world scene so that foreign merchants could sell things to them.
Gates IS the classic model of a captain of industry, building his own
monoply; it\'s just that we no longer see those things as admirable.  The
sweatshops of Nike are on the evening news, along with the latest report
on the personal failings of our leaders.

We live in a time with damn few heroes.  I speak not of celebrities, or
rich men, but heroes.  We have begun to doubt whether they even exist.
Witness the steady crumbling of the legend of John F. Kennedy.  No real
person could stand the level of scrutiny we give the well-known these
days.  And we deride fictional heroes as "superficial", "idealized" 
and "unrealistic."

We have the choice to look at the good or the bad.  Mostly we choose to
see the bad.

Some say the problem is that we\'re all in a big millenial funk, and 
will have to wait a decade or two before we see that the world hasn\'t
come to an end and get on with building the future.  But for now, we\'re
all just muddling through.

How does this give them an edge over Plasma weapons or Lasers?  

I wonder if  cost ought to be a factor.  At high tech levels it would
presumably be very cheap to manufacture slug throwers, Plasma weapons are
presumably restricted as well as being expensive.  If, by comparison, slug
throwers cost the same as water pistols today, then this might explain their
survival.

On another issue: what do you think of HEAP small arms ammo.  It seems daft
to allow even 4mm Gaus weapons to fire effective HEAP rounds.  I cannot
quite make the leap that technology would require.  From current practices
it seems impossible.  Could a HEAP round that small (half a gram in weight?)
really contain enough energy to penetrate and damge? I realise that they are
allowed in FF&S1, but is the physics up to it?

  The contact rules listed serve several functions very effectively;
- - the new world transfers as much of its wealth to the 3I as possible,
enriching the merchants who bankroll the 3I\'s expansion.
- - the world is eliminated as a medium-term military or economic threat.
- - the option exists of maintaining the world as a low cost producer, if
you ignore the energy costs/production controversy in the background.

  Arguably, it did. The 3I has no concern for anyones wishes but its own,
which is quite faithful to the great expanders of trade in the 19th C.

  Certainly the material in M:0 can be decided by the ref to be propaganda
for one side or the other, or reality can be a bit more complicated than
that. Some nice potential would be in having different players or characters
react differently as they see things in a different light (or not) as time
passes and things become more clear.

hey!  We Gridlorians love garlic and onions.  That takes care off the

As for the law level...  that\'s not possible.  2d roll of

When I finally read M:0 a few months ago and said exactly the same thing it

One of M:0\'s authors disscussed (whose name escapes me) this with me in
email, and he said that they felt that you couldn\'t build an empire and
keep your hands clean (basically). I understand what he was getting at, but
i feel that they went too far emphasising the sordid bits, and the IISS\'s
contact proceedures revolted me. They make the IISS just a MegaCorp\'s
resource prospecting arm.

After reading Melieu Zero my opinion is that the 3I is John Bull Company
writ large, complete with the use of their own citizens death\'s as a means
of making profit.

I suggest that you look into the matter more carefully. It is flat out
*impossible* to run the US phone system without automated switching.
The required number of operators is astronomical. Remember, it\'s not
the number of *lines*, it\'s the number of *interconnections*. And that
goes up *geometrically* as the number of lines goes up.

One area code has 672 possible exchanges, which have 10,000 numbers
each. That\'s 6,720,000 lines per area code. Just inside that one area
code the number of possible interconnections is at least 6,720,000
squared (possibly factorial, I\'m not going to take the time to
determine which). That\'s 45,158,400,000,000 connections. And one
switchboard position can handle (being *very* generous) 1000
connections. That means you\'d need 45,158,400,000 operators. 45
*billion*. And that\'s for *one* area code.

So it wasn\'t a matter of what it cost to automate, it was a matter of
automation was the *only* way to keep the system running after it
reached a certain size.

Sorry, you still don\'t get it. The went for automation because it was
*phsyically impossible* to run the system without it. See my previous
post for an explanation of just how many operators would be required. 
(One area code requires almost ten times the current world population!)

The better billing is a nice bonus. But the *fact* is that it\'s
*impossible* to run a large phone system without automation.

Not good. This virtually *guarantees* that anyone more than 100 years
old will have a number that\'s a duplicate! You need 3-4 digits for the
year.

At least you use "birth rank". Comp.risks has reported numerous
examples of ID codes being assigned based on things like a combo of:

1. date of birth
2. name
3. city of birth

And of course they run into problems when two "John Smith"s are born on
the same day in the same (large) city.

Your only problem is assigning a unique birth rank.

Rocket cartridges aren\'t necessary for zero-g use. And they have marked
drawbacks (such as being nearly useless at close range). You just need
training, or a compressed gas cartridge as part of the magazine so that
the gun can self-compensate.

I remember a scene in "Triplanetary" (The first book in E.E. Smiths\'s
"Lensman" series), where an officer with lots of zero g experience has
sabotaged the gravity generator in a pirate base and is using a high
caliber pistol with explosive rounds to manuever himself to a hatch
where he can enter the ship he plans to escape in.

Not only is he using the gun for manuevering, but he\'s picking targets
to cause the most damage! Sure, that means that his path zig-zags a
lot, but that just makes him harder to hit!

You have to boost all of the mass to it\'s mutual escape velocity. I

total output of the sun for a significant period (month? year?).

In that case, bombardment is *not* the way to go. Too much chance of
kicking *intact* chunks free. Think of it like a disease victim. You
don\'t blow them up, you incinerate them.

So you want to *melt* the planet. You might try controlled solar flare,
massive lasers, or some mega particle beams.

A wild guess?  If I go into a Waldenbooks at a major downtown shopping mall
(the Gallery to those familiar with Philadelphia), I can find Palladium
books.  This suggests to me a far wider distribution network, and, quite
possibly a larger print run.

Maybe, maybe not :^).  I was just commenting that as far as the physical

No that is not what I am saying. What I do not want is to pay out the A**
for a book with great glossy pictures. I just purchased the GURPS basic set
3rd edition revised for  $ 22.00 tonight. 
As I figured it is based on an old game system , The Fantasy Trip Melee and
TFT Wizard, that Steve Jackson developed (published by Metagaming) around
1977. I played that game before D&D BTW.

The GURPS book is 256 pages PACKED with information that an information
pack-rat like myself really loves! The outside cover is "attention
getting". The art work on the inside, however, looks like something that my
3 year old and I would draw with crayons on the back of a toy box. Which is
fine by me. If I want art work I will pay for it separately from my games.
(I do collect actual art work such as paintings and religious figures from
India and Mexico.)

The basic Traveller 4 book is 190 pages long with really, really nice art
work that I am paying WAY too much for. ~ $ 35.00 plus tax (at my local
game store which had to special order it).

Both publications contain substance and GURPS has a utilitarian form that
packs 250,000+ words into it. More bang for the buck! Which is what really
counts.

Have you ever read an engineering text? They s*** filled with formulas and
monotony. I used to study them late at night when I could not sleep. 5-10
minutes and ZZZZZZ....

BUT when I was awake I got all of the information that I needed. With no
distractions. Although a few naked women in my Differential Equations and
Matrix Theory book might have helped :-P !

Anyone with half a brain can visualize weapons, star ships and the like.
The old CT drawings were good enough. That is __why _we_ role_ play__
because we are more __creative_ and_ imaginative than the average person
who needs to watch 6-8 hours of  TV  a day to break out of their pea sized
brains and experience something wonderful. "My God it\'s full of stars..."

$5 was not that much money back then, at least to me.

That art work was primitive. I also bought those as well. But certainly not
for the "art work". I also did not get racked over the coals for the cost
of TSR\'s great "art work".

Why ? It was a relatively new game back then! why didn\'t it need customers
then ? 

Are we so simple minded today that we need to be sucked into a game with
"BY ME style art work" ? 

IF that is the case -- put naked or near naked women on the cover, fill the
pages with it (real futuristic stuff - I forget the artists name but a lot
of his stuff is on the web) and every kid, guy and art lover will snap up
every volume that they can get their hands on.

Was it really needed? I was hooked on Traveller beacuse of the system not
the swell pictures.

>  I firmly believe that what Traveller needs is new players.  

This I agree 100 % with! I am trying to generate interest by running my
game at the local game store. Prior to the announcement I was bugging Phil
to get some Traveller books for his store. I had 2 kids miss Saturday\'s
game because of a "Magic -The Gathering Tournament".

Perhaps role playing is going down the tubes and card games are rising up
in its stead. 1/3 of Phil\'s store are card games and the kids snap em\' up
like they are water in Nevada. Perhaps Marc needs to make a "Traveller -
The Rebellion" card game with little inserts telling the kids to try the
role playing game.

GURPS Traveller is do out this summer.  Loren Wiseman appears to be hard at
work on it.  It has the pontential to be truly promising, despite the fact
that many are up in arms over its departure from canon.

Marc Miller is/was at work on T4.1, a revised version of the T4 rules. 
He\'s also shopping for a new publisher for the Traveller line.  As time
goes by I\'m sure we\'ll be informed more fully.

At the time this book was written, I\'m not entirely sure they were
expecting the phone system to blow up like it did.  There were alot of
things along the line that happened that they didn\'t really predict.

Don\'t get me wrong, I know that it is impossible to run a behemoth like the
modern phone system without automation.  I\'m just not entirely convinced
that\'s why they switched over, or at least not initially.  

It was only 35 - 40 years ago that, in the heart of a major East Coast
city, my mother\'s house was tied into a "party line" that encompassed her
entire city block.  Now, there are probably...  Let\'s see...  At least 30 -
40 lines in the same city block today.

Each switchboard position, when human operators did all the work, could
handle 10,000 local ports (this was the origin of the exchange).  Some of
the ports were connectors to the other exchanges (whose operators were in
the same building), and I think a very small number were used for long
distance calls.

I don\'t dispute that today\'s phone system would be impossible without
automation.  In fact, I believe several times I stated something similar in
regards to automation.  Automation allows fewer people to do far, far more
work.

As I said, this book from the 50s stated that their R&D was devised for
another reason.  It was from Bell Labs, and I\'ll believe it.  Once they
started to implement automation, the amount of lines that they could add
grew, and the phone system grew with it.

I don\'t want to pay out the ass for glossy pictures either.  I\'d rather
that glossy pictures stay out of the book entirely (especially when the
same glossy pictures were used as front and rear pictures for each book). 
I\'m not defending IG by any means here.

The outside cover of the recent edition looks amazingly like an IG
Traveller book from a distance.  A style that I don\'t like.  I do think
that the interior artwork of the previous edition was decent, even if most
of it was recycled from earlier SJG products.

But, GURPS also uses the pictures to break up the text, something that IG

It\'s not a matter of not getting the information that you need.  It\'s a
matter of trying to get somebody to decide to purchase the book in
question.

Originally I set out to be an artist in life.  I was gifted with a slightly
above average ability to make pictures.  I\'m being a little modest about
it, but basically, I\'m a pen and ink artist and I\'m pretty good.  When I\'m
running a game, I don\'t mind being able to point to something and say,
"This is what the armor they\'re wearing looks like."  Anyone can visual
these things, true...

There\'s a difference between the GURPS basic rules, which are a generic
system for use by anyone, and Traveller, which _is_ a history and a
background.  A visual reference is a visual reference.  Do Traveller ships
look like the Enterprise?  The Millenium Falcon?  An Imperial Star
Destroyer?  The Battlestar Galactica?  The Discovery?  What?  No.  None of
the above.  That\'s why Fighting Ships had a visual reference for each of
the ships.  Something that you can point to and say, "This is the ship that
is breaking off for pursuit!"  The classic Scout/Courier, for example, is
one of the most readily identifiable visual references for Traveller

> $5 was not that much money back then, at least to me.

$5 was one half of the cost of an AD&D hardcover like the player\'s handbook
or the monster manual, even though it was less than half the size of either
book.

The artwork was primative, but the old AD&D stuff used it as fully as
possible to create a visual reference.  Kobolds, whether drawn by Otus
(whose stuff is hardly "primative") or by Sutherland, or by Dee, were cut
from the same mold.  Same for orcs, and goblins, and red dragons...  And
many, many creatures from AD&D.  A pciture, when used properly, is worth a
thousand words.

> Why ? It was a relatively new game back then! why didn\'t it need customers
> then ? 

1.) Traveller\'s Boxed Set LBBs needed no artwork because very little was
described that needed any detailed description.  There was no background,
so there was no need for a visual reference either.

2.) The dynamic of the role-playing industry back then was nothing like it
is today.  Back then, the industry was smaller, and there was less of a
distribution network.  Very few hobby shops had a wide selection of RPGs. 
Though the industry was smaller, the gamers were cut from a different cloth
as well.  A role-playing gamer back then was far more likely to know when a
new game was coming out.  The industry was more supportive and less
competitive.  Nowadays, your average comic book store will have a pretty
decent number of RPGs.  I can go to many places to do my RPG shopping,
whereas throughout the 80s, there were only three places that I could hit.

> Are we so simple minded today that we need to be sucked into a game with
> "BY ME style art work" ? 

I will freely admit that a good visual presentation is important to whether
I will buy a role-playing book or not.  This is what I was saying.  A good
visual presentation shows that the book was either done by professionals,
or done by those who liked the game enough to make it look like they were
professionals.

BTRC, with the recent edition of 3G3, for example, used completely
minimalist printing techniques to make a book that looks professional, is
well laid out, and stands out from other books on the shelves.  It caught
my attention and I peeked through it many times before buying it, but
eventually, I bought it.  It\'s a wonderful and extremely useful resource
for RPGs, and it comes in a pretty package.  If it had, say, the layout of
FF&S2, I wouldn\'t have bought it until I had heard alot about it and
decided I couldn\'t be without it.

No need to do that.  Put a decent rendering on the cover, make an
impressive logo that stands out from the books that are next to it on the
shelves.  Study the books on the shelves to see what colors would properly
stand out.  The book will have a better chance of selling than a book with
cover paintings from an old Sci-Fi author on a black background with red
trim.

That\'s great.  Again, the dynamic of the audience was entirely different
back then.  Take note that comic book stores often carry a decent selection
of role-playing games.  This should give you some hint that there is more
than a little crossover.

Sorry.  The days are truly gone when you could do what GDW did, or do what
many of the earliest game designers did.  D&D\'s original 3 tan booklet set
would not sell today, yet it completely revolutionized the game world a
quarter century ago...

That\'s a commendable effort  :^)  Sorry to hear that you lost players to a

Do you think the company that makes the most money from CCGs would have
bought out TSR if this was the case?  At this point in time, the two
industries really do need each other to some extent.  Not surprisingly, all
of the CCG players that I can think of are also avid roleplayers.

RPGs have some staying power, as long as the industry as a whole does it
right.  It seems that many companies are doing it right at the moment, and
from what I\'ve seen, the current crop of RPGs is more diverse and
interesting then I can ever remember,

Yup. A reference to this is right in Trillion Credit Squadron, p. 35:

	"If the bridge or computer is out, another ship may be linked to it 
for jump; the linking ship must have a computer and bridge at least 
as large as that of the damaged ship, and linking takes one week. 
Both move at the jump rate of the slowest ship and maneuver is 
impossible while linked."

TCS goes on to say that the link is rather fragile and a role for 
failure must be made each week. A failure in the link means that 
you\'d have to spend another week re-linking the two ships. However, 
it goes also says:

	"Ships whose power plants  or j-drives have been destroyed must 
either be transported  to a starport inside a tender or must be 
repaired in place."

That\'s the only canon reference that I know of for sure concerning 
this. I think there might be something in one of the Supplements 
(Traders and Gunboats?) that mentions a "Jump Shuttle" for X-Boats 
that hooks on to the rear of the boat to allow for jump capability.

How much more massive is the shooter (in Vaccsuit?) than the bullet he is
firing? Take this factor and divide the muzzle velocity with it to reach a
quick and dirty delta V per shot. Say the guy weighs 100 kg, bullet weighs
10 grams and muzzle velocity is 500 m/s. This give us about 5 cm/s in
deltaV per shot.

If 5 cm/s per shot is all the zigzagging he\'ll muster then I\'d say he\'s
dead before he reaches the escape. The problem of recoil in zero-G is IMHO
extremely overrated in RPGs just as brawling and wrestling is underrated.

Maybe not. Depot/Lishun (1219) is by my reckoning at least 7 jumps away from
Capital/Core (2118) at jump 6 (39 parsec in a straight line). Dulinor "died"
(are we really sure he actually died?) on 131, the TJ arrived on 212. That\'s
81 days, assuming 6 days per jump, thats no more than 13 jumps. So unless
Strephon started back a week early....

Hmmm, the game is afoot.

Try again. Jump-2 got invented by the Vilani. Jump 3 is TL12.

Secondly, fusion+ sucks for jump-capable starships, because of it\'s fuel
requirements (much higher than corresponding fusion plants) and it\'s huge
requirements for surface area.

Thirdly, there are a small set of applications that a battery doesnt do as
well (and some fusion+ doesnt do at all. Like powered armour).

Fourthly, the critical TL12 inventions vs TL11 cultures are the Meson
Screen, the Nuclear damper, the tenfold reduction in minimum fusion power
plants and the jump-3. Compared to that list, fusion plus just doesnt get
on the run-on team.

This isnt reflected in the background. In fact, I would argue that Cleon is
far more McArthur ... militarily, Macarthur was in the bottom tier of US
generals, but his genius was reorginising Japan after conquest into a
viable and friendly society.

This was Cleon\'s genius - he set up a structure where worlds could be not
just conquered, but absorbed.

The cartridge might work but I\'m not so shure about the mechanism, most
lubricants wont work in vacuum and there is the problem of metal pieces
spontaneously welding together. In short I don\'t think your 1906-vintage
Smith&Wesson will work in vacuum, at least not reliably, but not for the

If Cleon is Gates, Artemus is Jobs ;-)

I\'ve more sympathy for him. This is the man who consolidated the holes that
Cleon left. He was a *real* emperor.

It was proposed here (a while ago) that Artemus was Georgian...

The Not-the-IG Website still lists them (and covers even more years), I
think the AAB Website does this also, and I fitted them into a windows

Oh yes, they did! Look at early drawings of the Far Trader ... But the
deckplans showed more differences then. Also, I never saw an Azhanti High

But the Dynchia Attack Strider from 101 Vehicles seemed to me borrowed
from Star Wars 3 - I think any universe should have a two-legged one. :-)

Thanks for the info.  Now allow me to run this extrapolation.
Assuming the linkage possibility exists, the week for interconnections and
fragile nature of the link would imply that this linkage is for ships not
intended for linkage.
However, if you design a ship specifically to mate with another (both have to
be designed this way), then you could cut down on the time and fragility of the
linkage.

	[->]  I\'m convinced that the location from which you obtain the
SSN is the only information given by the number.  I worked as a grocery
store cashier for a few years and saw hundreds of SSN/DLN (they are the
same in GA) on people\'s checks.  They almost universally started with
the number \'2\'.  2xx-xx-xxxx.  I actively asked people about their
numbers at the time.  When I saw one that didn\'t start with a 2, I would
often ask them which office they got the card from.  My 2+ year
investigation tells me that a 2 in the first digit indicates that you
got your SSN from a GA/AL office.  
	   Also of interest:  I was born in 1969, my brothers in \'83 and
\'85.  We all got our SSN\'s at the same time ( when the gov\'t decided to
require everyone to have one ).  All three of our SSN\'s are the same
except for the last digit.  They look like this:

	Brother#1 - 3/15/85 - 2xx-xx-xxx7
	Brother#2 - 12/8/83 - 2xx-xx-xxx8
	Me          - 12/24/69 - 2xx-xx-xxx9

	   Where the x\'s are all identical.  My conclusion is that there
are three possibilities:
	1.  The intervening numbers are meaningless.  Just sequentaily
generated.
	2.  The intervening numbers somehow indicate the date that you
received the number.
	3.  The intervening numbers somehow indicate a secret government
"family number".

	   I would vote for #1.  I find #3 unlikely, especially since I
have a different father/last name from the younger brothers.  #2 is
possible and would help to insure uniqueness, but seems unlikely.

One thing - I think Collectible Card Games are one of the contributors to the
downward slide (such as Marvel going bankrupt) in the comic book industry.
I realize that the comic book competition was intense, what with the 
excellent small press comics and such, but CCG\'s and comic books have
almost identical sales demographics. If a junior high kid is spending all of
his allowance on Magic: the Addiction, he doesn\'t have anything left for
Spider-Man and the 5001 different X-Men books.

I wonder how much new blood comes into RPG\'s due to CCG\'s? From what
I\'ve seen, it\'s pretty much a given that RPG\'s killed the wargame market in 
the 1980\'s by sucking up all the new blood (new players who might have 
played wargames played RPG\'s instead). There was concern that computer
games might do the same thing to RPG\'s, but (at least in the earlier
pre-networked computer games) the social element was missing. 

In my community, we have people coming into some forms of RPG
(usually live-action White Wolf Vampire crap) from CCG\'s, an old
guard that occaisionally entices a newbie to play a wargame with
them, and a rising fad of European board games like Settlers of 
Kitarn(sp?). There\'s some definite separation between the
CCG and RPG camps, and a bunch of guys who run around and
hit each other with boffo swords. When we see a new person, he\'s
most likely to start with CCG\'s, next most likely to start with 
weapons LARP (Live Action Role Play, the guys with the boffo
swords), then regular RPG\'s. What are the rest of you seeing in
your communities?

Sure. That\'s done. The problem comes when you find out that a "new"
situation leads to a *bad* response. Then you may discover that it\'s
not possible to correct the erroneous response by simply "teaching" the
AI that this is a bad response. Doing so may not take, or may lead to a
*different* bad decision in known situations. It all depends on the
internal "mappings" created by training.

And unless you have a *lot* of time and resources to analyse the
mapping and figure out *how* it leads to the decisions, it\'s easier to
scrap the mappings and start training an AI from scratch, just make
sure to use a different training set (at the very least, you need to
change the order of the \'tests\').

It\'s much like people. After a lifetime of experience, you may make a
decision and be told that it was wrong. Your reaction can vary from
accepting that and changing your decision making process (and possibly
becoming liable to make *other* mistakes, such as the cop who after
accidentally shooting an innocent bystander hesitates too long when
facing a crimal and gets his partner shot). Or you may decide that the
folks telling you that you are wrong are wrong. In which case you may
"act" correctly, but only when you think you are likely to be caught.
Or you may just reject the "correction" completely.

The problem is that if the fibers can carry *weapons* laser energy
levels, then you can just cover your hull with them, connected to the
other side, and a laser beam would go "thru" your ship with no damage.

More realisticly, this requires *impossible* levels of transparency for
the fibers. As well as conductivity levels that are way out there.

Consider that if you send a 100 Megawatt laserbeam thru a fiber and
that fiber has a loss of *only* .001% (.00001) then it will have
absorbed 100,000,000 * .00001 = 1000 watts of energy. Now consider that
those portable electric room heaters are usually about 1000 watts. That
fiber is going to be *hot*. Red hot. And at those temps, I bet it
absorbs light a lot better, which heats it up more which makes it
absorb more which... End result is the fiber goes "poof", and deposits
a lot of laser energy in the areas it was running thru.

Weapons grade lasers *don\'t* mix with "transparent" materials.

Sorry, but *no* AI of the "learning" (as opposed to "programmed") type
works that way. It\'s not a matter of "uncorrupted backups". Without
analysis that takes *years*, you can\'t tell *which* "lesson" is
responsible for the bad result. You can try *further* training,
starting with something along the lines of "your last decision was
wrong", but in learning AIs above a certain complexity, this can and
does lead to loops where correcting one mistake causes the AI to make a
different one, and correcting the second leads back to the first. In
such cases, it\'s been found that you have to erase *all* the learning,
and start over, but give the "training" with the lessons in a different
order.

It\'s somewhat like the elementary learning program called "ANIMALS".
You give the program an Animal name, and a rule to distinguish it from
the other animals in the database. The only difference is that true
learning AIs *deduce* the rules, and sometimes the order in which the
examples are presented leads to a poor rule. And trying to correct it
can lead to a contradictory rule, which gives you the "looping"
behavior above.

This appears in AIs as simple as character recognition routines!

Sorry, but you have a choice" Simple and predictable (and *not* capable
of complex decisions) or complex and unpredictable.

This has been an unpleasant (as far as many researchers are concerned)
discovery in AI research. Flexibility *requires* unpredictability, and
complexity introduces unpredictability as well.

The sort of "limited" AI you describe is no better than what\'s in
service *now*. Heck, even most "expert systems" are more likely to give
odd results. That\'s *why* they are used to *advise*, rather than
allowed to make the decisions on their own.

Not many. You see, on one of the shuttle flights, it *happened* (sort
of). A metal reinforcing "bar" inside a spacesuit glove shifted and
punctured the glove. It wasn\'t until they were on the ground and the
suit was getting cleaned that they found blood in the glove lining and
realized that the bar hadn\'t just "bitten" the astronaut. Instead, it
had punctured the glove, and the astronaut had been bleeding into space
until the blood clotted. As I recall. the wound was on the web between
the thumb and the rest of the hand.

Skin is *tough*. It\'s pretty much the same as *leather*. The processing
doesn\'t make leather tougher, it just keeps it from rotting. So the
finger will swell up, and a lot of sub-surface capillaries will burst,
and a lot of fluid will accumulate. The results are actually a lot like
frostbite.

An Air Force officer named Kittinger jumped from a high altitude
balloon at an altitude of something like 100,000 feet. At that
altitude, as far as effects on the body are concerned, you *are* in
space. He lost the gloves on his pressure suit when he exited the
capsule. His hands were badly swollen from the fluid that went in (due
to low pressure) and didn\'t leave. And the burst capillaries made them
look pretty bad. But there was no *lasting* damage. It *did* hurt like
hell though.

It\'s likely that the dodge in Heinlein\'s story "Gentlemen Be Seated"
would also work. In it a couple of people are trapped be a cave in in a
tunnel being excavated on Luna. There\'s enough air in the tunnel
section to last a *long* time, but the tanks on their suits won\'t last
very long. Then they discover that there\'s a leak in the tunnel. But
they don\'t have anything to plug it with. Or do they... The rescue
party finds one with one of his buttocks pressed against the hole.
Fatty tissue can\'t bleed much... :-)

The same could very well be applied to a human with the wrong response. All
I\'m saying is that there has toe be (handwaved up) a reason for why robots
cannot learn human knowledge through experience and then apply it AND/OR
why you cannot copy the content of the robots brain.

I\'m leaning towards the explanation that you can build trainable robot
brains but they take quite a lot of time to train and unfortunately the
content of their brain cannot be copied due to the nonlinear way their
brains work. Any replication errors however small will lead to large global
changes due to the inherent unlinearness of the algorithms used.

This handwave avoid the "human minds cannot be replicated in machinery due
to some unique property" leading to religional bullshit, souls, lifeforce
etc that at least my players (and me included) would never buy.

If you have a population of 10 billion on a planet that practices zero
population growth, the average number of births per hour will equal the
average number of deaths per hour. Assuming an average life span of 80
years (700,800 hours), you get 10 billion/700,800 = 14,269 deaths/hour
and the same number of births. If the planet has a population growth of
1% pa. you\'d add another 100 million per year or 143/hour. A methodical
ID system would have to account for seasonal variations though. With
planets of more than 50 billion people you may need more than 5 digits.
I think the Imperium would be fairly safe with 6 digits.

At last! A formula for "accuracy" of a jump.

Just remember that the *time* variance in the jump means that the
planet will have moved with respect to the plotted exit point (at 30
km/sec an hour difference gives about 108,000 km. A day gives 2.6
*million* km difference).

But I like it. Now we can figure things *properly*.

Yeah, but it\'s talking about a *different* subject. Automation came

If that was the case then there were only 8 phones on the block. Or

It\'s been too long. And heck, I know folks who were on party lines as

essentially assigns me both sides of a two party line! One line, two

Hardly. A single exchange had *multiple* switchboards. And they handled
a lot less than 10,000 lines. Consider. The area the operator can reach
is *only* about 70 cm tall by 140 cm wide (based on how far *I* can
reach while seated at my computer). That\'s 9800 cm^2. And the plugs
*alone* take up most of a square cm, ignoring things like indicator
lights. So there\'s no *way* those switchboards can handle 10,000 lines.

Sure a lot of exchanges in *small towns* were only one switchboard. But
that\'s because the exchange assigned to that own wasn\'t anywhere *near*
full (just like North Dakota isn\'t going to need an area code split in
the forseeable future).

I\'ll check on comp.dcom.telecom to find out how many lines a typical
*manual* switchboard handled and get back to you. But keep in mind that
it took multiple positions for things like large hotels and there\'s no
way those had 10,000 lines!

Some of them were ports to other "blocks" in the same exchange, others

Bell labs didn\'t invent direct dialing. A fellow by the name of
Strowger did. And that was in the 1910s or 1920s. Direct *local*
dialing was around (and required!) long before that 1950s project. The
automation you read about was for long distance. I\'m talking about what
is required for *local* service in large cities.

Being able to *dial* a local number is automation! You still have
operators for other things, including long distance. But the automation
of *local* calls was done for non-economic reasons. Among others,
Strowger was an undertaker and got tired of the operator directing
people to his competitor! Operators were also notoriuos for getting all
the gossip by listening in on calls and noting call patterns.

The rules have *never* indicated how closely your exit point matches
your *planned* exit point. 

However, even if it maches exactly, the rules that say that the *time*
at which you exit varies mean that your position relative to the
destination will vary too.

Consider. Earth is moving around its orbit at about 30 km/sec. So if
you intended to come out at 100 diameters (1,280,000 km) and you are
one hour late, Earth will have moved 30*3600=108,000 km. If you are a
*day* late (or early) Earth will be 2,592,000 km from where you
expected it to be.

So you aren\'t going to come out all that close the where you aimed IN
RELATION TO THE PLANET. 

> How is it then routed into port (what are the possible solutions, since I
> would expect many variations to be in use)?

If it\'s a "developed" system, you contact Space Traffic Control and
request a course to the port. If it\'s too low a TL for that, you wait
until your sensors have got a good idea where you are and what\'s around
you (like other ships) and you then plot your own course, keeping an
eye out for any other ships.

> What if there are multiple destinations in-system?

Keep in mind that the distance between planets are so large that you\'d
have plotted your exit to come out as close as is practical (100
diameters or so) to whichever planet you intended as your destination.
Other planets will be tens to hundreds of millions of km away,
depending on what orbit they are in and on *where* they are in that
orbit. 

For example, Earth is in an orbit 150 million km from the sun. Mars is
in an orbit about 240 million km from the sun. Earth takes about 365
days to complete an orbit. Mars takes around 670 days. So at closest
approach, earth and mars are about 90 million km apart. At farthest
they are 390 million km apart. And due to their orbital periods, they
don\'t get close all that often.

Several books have the formulas for generating systems. And they
include formulas for determining the orbital periods of the various
planets. The way I do it is I just picked an arbitary date *way* back
and said that on that date, all the planets were at 0 degrees in their
orbits. So I just have to figure how many days it\'s been since that
date, divide by the number of days in the orbital period, and that
gives me how many orbits (local years) it\'s been. Throw away the whole
number and keep the decimal. Multiply the decimal by 360 degrees and yu
have how far around the orbit from the 0 mark the planet is. Do that
for the planets the players are interested in, and then plot them on
polar coordinate graph paper (most drafting supply stores have it). You
now have a system map for that date. Next time they visit, you update
the positions.

It\'s easier than it sounds, and it helps give a feel for how planets
move and get across the idea that they don\'t just sit there at the same
spot all the time.

Jo, jump-3 was invented 2000 years before Milieu:0. It was in use throughout
the 2nd Imperium for at least half a millenium. Planets may lose the
industrial capacity to built jump-3 ships when it becomes economically
unsound to employ them (which, unfortunately, dosen\'t happen until the
pocket empire in question shrinks to less than three parsecs across;
realistically neither the Old Earth Federation, the Sylean Confederation
or Vland would have lost the need for jump-3), but the _knowledge_ isn\'t
going to go away. Well, some planets may lose the knowledge too, the hard
way by being physically destroyed in war, but neither Sylea nor Vland
devolved catastrophically during the Long Night. If some rich nobleman
wanted a jump-3 ship, he\'d be able to get one (though he might have to be
rich enough to build his own starship yard ;-).

True, and an imaginitive GM can do wonders, but the whole RC and Wilds
scenario or world seemed to encourage the more militant sort of adventure.
I might even say it made the militant sort of adventure more fun or more of
a possibility than the CT or MT setting typically did.  After all, if you
are adventuring in the Third Imperium it is important at all times to
escape the notice of Imperial Law Enforcement, which frowns on such
activities as bombing planets and detonating nuclear warheads.  Taking
players *outside* the Imperium helps, but that\'s not the point.

Those adventure hooks that were not shootemups still required a relatively
powerful (in terms of weapons) set of characters to complete.  Its ok, the
game was geared to that sort of adventure, simlarly to the way that
Twilight:2000 was.  There also did not seem to be too many well developed
adventures (as opposed to just hooks) not geared towards this makeup of
characters.

I just would rather have the options and settings associated with The Third
Imperium.

And, really the point of my post you quoted in part, was that its not
appropriate to say that one or another game or art "sucks" without backing
it up.

Uh, well, so what? Just because there\'s no published info doesn\'t
mean that it wouldn\'t make a good new adventure milieu. In fact,
a lack of published material is, in a lot of ways, a bonus.

IT WAS! Look, Cleon was the head of a huge trading consortium. He started
the Imperium to further extend his economic control. I don\'t believe the
IISS was not founded until later, but in any event, its precursor WAS the
market development end of Cleon\'s company.
The whole reason Cleon declared empire was that a formula for expansion
that was economically viable was developed. The contact procedures (which
are listed as being the cirriculum at the Zhanuistu Trade School, I would
point out) show how that was done.
Later, in a classic setting, the Scouts have a _much_ different role. But
you can\'t apply what they became to what there were in Milieu-0.

Actually, the policy was that by supporting dictators early on, it would
naturally lead to the dictators wanting to fight each other. What the
School advocated was pre-empting a long, drawn out, economically damaging
war by starting them at it in their own terms. Sort of like a controled
explosion being used to disarm a terrorist device.
Their "military advisors" to the different factions are specifically
trained to keep them focused on killing each other rather than the base
population. Since they are all in contact with each other they can
orchastrate the war to elliminate excess military bodies on the planet and
engineer it so the best person wins. When you then have one single
planetary government they turn around and support a coup or revolution to
replace them with a less militant body.

>Not only was it immoral and everything the Imperium should be
>against, it was bad business.
I won\'t argue immorality, except to point out that the Imperium was all
about business. Why is this bad business? You clean out a bunch of
repressive, exploitive regiems, who continue their domination through
threat of violence and replace them with one that perpetuates itself
through _economic_ means. You ensure that minimal damage is done to
civilians and maximum damange done to military types who might be a problem
alter trying to reassert a military dictatorship.
In addition to accomplishing this it also leads into the next phase which
was infrastructure development. Loads of off-world contract for immediate
money, and you are building their workforce into rather efficient
producers. So that they can make goods that are worth selling off-world.
Where\'s the bad business?

>You can rob a man once, but you can trade with him forever.
Absolutely. The early phases are designed to remove the base raw-material
wealth. If their currency is backed by a gold-standard you want to remove
the gold and move them to a system where their currency is backed by
Imperial Credits. The process is designed to turn them into a great market.
That is the whole point. The initial raw-material exploitation is designed
to put them in a position where they _have_ to adopt the Imperial economic
policies. These policies then turn them first into producers, further
funding the expansion, and then into consumers, generating wealth through
taxation.

>The theme of "everything is based on economics" does not mean

>seemed to believe.

The aim was to come up with a self-sustaining, progressively expanding
economic plan. Maybe you missed the finer points or they weren\'t expressed
clear enough. I hope the above has clarified things.

>ultimately megacorps need _consumers_ and that means that _developing_ the

That was the aim, as explained above. What you describe sounds more like
the RC who go out and physically steal technology from governments they
don\'t like. Smash and Grab.

>The Imperium as depicted
>in M:0 was far more rapacious and systematically violent than the
>RC ever was.

I disagree about the violence bit. If you look at the plan, it doesn\'t not
at any point call for any Imperial Troops or gross military interference.
The only military involvement ever in two areas: first in encouraging their
gung-ho military types to kill each other off and secondly hiring high-tech
mercenaries to come in at the end of the war to ensure a clean, quick
coup-de-gras to the conflict.
Rapacious? Well, certainly profit-orientated. If you want to judge solely
by quality of lifestyle, income levels and other capitalist measures there
is a strong argument that uplifted worlds are much better off than they
were. On a macro-political sense they have much less control over their own
destiny, general policy and procedure, but the individuals in those
societies do rather well from it.

Sure, that what the propaganda says. That\'s what the history books say. In
reality nothing is done for idealism. On one hand people cry for "hard
science". Yet here you are crying for "fairytale plots". Hmmm.

>Let the Civil War and the Rebellion tell the story of an empire

Actually, the perfect setting for what you are describing is just after
Milieu Zero. Think about it. As they expand the Imperium spreads all sorts
of propaganda about how wonderful and idealistic it is. It\'s good PR.
Especially when negotiationg with pocket empires. But, as time goes on, and
these worlds are uplifted and adsorbed into the Imperium what you have is a
whole generation who actually _believes_ the propaganda. Thousands of civil
servants on hunderds of worlds who really belive in the concept of a great,
benificient empire. The propaganda become the reality and _then_ you have
the idealism you are aspiring for.

So 100 diameters from a size 8 planet which orbits at 30 km/sec (how
typical is that?) is 1,280,000 km, which can be covered in 5 hours by a 1G
ship.  It sounds as if the results of being 1 day early or late is an
additional 10 hours in transit.

Now my physics is rusty to the point of laughable.  The above may be wrong.
I question if it is linear.  I keep wanting to see this as 2.5 hours
acceleration, 2.5 hours decel (we\'re trying to land on the planet, not
crack it open).  So my question for the number crunching types is "Given
that we have a constant acceleration, does doubling (or tripling) distance
double (or triple) time to destination?"

I\'m also wondering about the maximum velocity of a constant 1G acceleration
ship.

This just occurred to me:  I\'d pretty much exclude by fiat the possibility
of arriving 12 hours early and finding that the planet is exactly where the
ship comes out (although this might do something interesting for the chap
who is trying to completely destroy a world).

I\'m probably going to do something with a near miss, though.  A ship
arriving 1,280 km from the planet would set off all sortsa red alerts both
in-system and aboard ship.

The Not-the-IG Pages were originally concieved as a new site for IG, and
was resuurected (as a pheonix) from the pieces salvages off the old IG
site.  Due to lack of interest from IG, the plan was abbandoned, and the
while these pages will remain, the site will shortly branch out into
other territories.

No.  This list is run off of Multi-Player Games Network, and dates back to
the dim and distant past of the Internet, when 386/50 was a great computer
system and Win3.1 was an upgrade.

Yes! Heavy Gear is an incredible neat system, and the Silhouette system
handles very well.  I\'m tempted to convert my Traveller game to it.  Buy
it.  

Also, for near-future campaign, look in into Jovian Chronicles.  True,
it has \'bendy-giant-robots\', but it is an excellent SF setting.


Very Quick Silhouette Task overview:

Stats:
	Stats are rated (similar to Ars Magica) from apx -3 to +3 with 0
being \'average\'.  Positive stats are above average, while negative stats
are below average.

	eg- Ivan has an Agility well above average.  His AGL is +2.

Skills:
	Skills are rated from none, to 0 and up, on basically the same
scale as Traveller skills.  each skill has a controlling attribute (eg-
Small Arms is controlled by Agility).
	
	eg- Ivan has a Small Arms skill of 3 - he is a very well trained
professional.

Task Resolution:
	A Skill/Stat combination is chosen for the task, and a
difficulty is set, from 1 up  The higher the number the harder the task.

	The player rolls a number of dice equal to his skill level, and
the highest value on a single die is taken.  *The dice are not
totalled.*  If a player rolled three dice and got 5, 3, and 4.  His roll
would be 5. 
	To this roll the stat value is added.  If this total is equal or
greater than the task number, the character succeeds.  The more your
total exceeds the task difficulty, the greater the success. 

	eg- Ivan wants to shoot the apple off of his son\'s head.  Due to
the size and difficulty, the GM determines that the difficulty for this
task is 6.
	Ivan rolls three dice (since his Small Arms skill is 3).  The
dice roll:   2   5   3.
	Ivan takes the highest die and adds his AGL: (5+2 = 7).  His
total is 7, which is greater than the difficulty number.  Ivan succeeds
at his task.

Unskilled:
	If you have no skill, you roll 2 dice, and take the lowest die.

The Sylean Federation Scout Service was founded in the last century 
before the Imperium was formed.  It is (from Book 6) the direct
predecessor to the IISS.

Which is why, IMHO, the portrayal of many things in M:0, from the view
of "economics is everything", makes the setting as published drab. 
It would seem that all M:0 has done is insure that GURPS is the one
last, greatest hope for Traveller.  We wanted M:0 to relate to the CT
setting.  From your statement, and what was published, it does not.

Perhaps we could consider the IG T4 materials to exist in their own 
alternative universe, where Bill Gates is Emperor Cleon I and Vanna White
can be Empress during the Psionic Suppressions.

That\'s why you match velocities with your target planet before you jump
(what Marc called a "standing jump"; it\'s reasonable to assume that your
exit point moves with time at the velocity your ship had when it entered.

Which has somewhat more interesting consequences. What happens when the
line between you and your target world crosses the target star\'s 100-diameter
limit? Can you pass through or do you have to exit as soon as you cross
the sphere? That would result in times of a few months each year when 
travel times between planets get a couple of days longer.

Does your destination have to be at a 100-diameter limit, or can you jump
into free space (in which case your exit point can be pretty much anywhere,
not just along the origin=>desitnation world line...)

As far as GURPS Traveller, IMHO I think it will work fine.  GURPS is an
innocuous background system, upon which you can layer whatever kind of story
you wish to tell.  For me, Traveller is about the Traveller universe, not
about the system (which, honestly, has never been that stunning in ANY of
it\'s incarnations).  The DreamPod 9 system would be PERFECT for Traveller,
but I doubt if that will happen.  I\'ll therefore snap up my copy of GURPS
Traveller, knowing that, no matter how "GURPSified it turns out to be, I\'ll
be much happier with it that with any of the crap Imperium ever wasted trees

I wonder how much of that is in direct proportion to the difference in
time between you, Gates and the Victorian Robber Barons. At the _time_
people were hardly enamored of these men \'building things where nothing
was before\'. Ask the farmers who coudn\'t ship their product except on the
monpolized railroads, and were driven to ruin by the high prices charged.

Ask the competing business owners who were driven out of business by any
means possible, including sabotage, murder and terrorism. 

At the time, grain elevator owners in the Midwest were taking grain
shipments from farmers. That\'s it, simply taking them, selling their grain
and keeping all the money. Some dressed it up as inflated 
\'storage fees\' but many simply stole it. 

Go back and re-read the Zhunastu School of Contact again in M0; those
romantic Robber Barons did that kind of stuff all the time...where do you
think the CORE people got the idea?

Battlerider squadrons, and troop transports. If the squadron navigator can\'t

homeworld, and the gas giants well, and tried to cover the asteriod rings, and
the comets too). This leaves a lot of system space uncovered. Yeah, the
invader will have to fight his/her way into the gas giants to refuel, but the
actual JUMP will be pretty much unopposed. Of course I can see raiding
squadrons WANTING to drop into the laps of the defenders; surprise!....

So?  What\'s wrong with a polar orbit? Sometimes that\'s the best type.  If 
you\'re surveying a planet, the polar orbit usually sweeps the whole 
planet.  Then you have to think about the "odd" planets, like Uranus? or 
is it Neptune that\'s lying on its side? and then there are the tidally 
locked planets.

And for that matter, what\'s wrong with thrusters?

Actually, there have been a number of studies showing that longer
shift/fewer days workweeks increase productivity. A lot of the problems
with loss of attention, inattention and missed signals in highly automated
environments have been shown to be because of the control interface; ones
that simply require the human operator to watch things and react when
something goes wrong are more likely to have errors committed than
interfaces wher e the automation is used as an adjunct to the human
operator\'s control of the systems. Ie: humans react better, and more
accurately when they\'re doing things instead of just watching.

Now, this has been studied most extensively in very high threat
environments like airplane cockpits and the like (very high threat in that
if you make a mistake, it can be _very_ bad), but the principles are
applicable to most any job.

As with almost anything to do with technology "It\'s the human interface,
stupid!"

Good HI design is rare, and not nearly as easy as you might think.

For a rather strange view of \'automation done right\' read Nova, by Samuel
R. Delany. It illustrates the kinds of principles I\'m talking about.

The source I pulled this from was _The Hacker Crackdown_ by Sterling.  The
first chapter is a history of the phone company and its ways.  He stated
that exchanges were kept to 10,000 numbers as that was the most that a
human operator could handle.

You can allow them to choose, I believe it may even say that somewhere in
the rules.  My PC\'s liked the balance achieved with the following amendment
to the system...

Year 1 - Roll for skill category, roll for skill
Year 2 - Roll for skill category, pick skill
Year 3 - Pick skill category, roll for skill
Year 4 - Pick skill category, pick skill

It works pretty well.  When extra skills come into play, then start the
cycle again for the extra skills.

	Okay, this could obviously very easily turn into one of those 
interminable arguments with quotes, counter-quotes and a lot of verbiage 
but no progress.  Let\'s do our best to stake out our overall positions 
clearly before getting down to all of the micro stuff these things can 
degenerate to.
	Let me start with PE.  As a game it\'s fine, but it has as much to 
do with real economics as Monopoly.  The stuff about comparative 
advantage is nice, and the finished goods trade stuff is reasonable, but 
the underlying mechanisms for producing GWP are weird.  My biggest beef 
was with the infrastructure/resource consumption stuff.  But what the 
heck, Monopoly is a fun game and I\'m sure PE is too.  It\'s just not the 
way I\'d do it.  Of course, I think FF&S2 could use a second volume with 
more detail on some issues, so my tastes may be out of the norm.
	I have two real problems with M:0.  First, it is _way_ too 
cynical for my tastes.  Second, given the cynicism, the business plan for 
the imperium was not tenable in the long run because it focused on 
sucking all the wealth out of planets rather than creating stable, 
long-run trading partners.

	On the first point, the "fairy-tale plots" comment was a bit
unfair.  My reading of M:0 was that Cleon was a greedy SOB who had
declared the 3I because it was a good business move.  I think this is a
bit one-dimensional.  Real people from history who might compare somewhat
in prominence to Cleon were, IMHO, a bit more complicated than that. 
Certainly some of them were that bad, but most of the interesting ones 
weren\'t.  Someone mentioned MacArthur in this thread.  Mac is a great 
example because he was an excellent general and rebuilder of post-war 
Japan, but his arrogance and self-involvement didn\'t allow him to see the 
bigger picture of which he was a part.  As a result, Truman had to can 
him.  You may quibble with my description of MacArthur, but the point is 
that the man was both heroic and flawed.  Thomas Jefferson was a 
brilliant man who laid much of the intellectual foundation for American 
democracy and guarantees of liberty, but he was also a slave-owner and 
philanderer.  Abraham Lincoln had to do all kinds of things to win the 
Civil War that were contrary to American principles, and freed the slaves 
many say because it would help win the war rather than out of any real 
conviction, but he still is one of our most revered presidents because of 
all the things he did _right_.  (I hope our international friends will 
forgive me all of these American examples)
	My question is, where\'s Cleon\'s positive side?  All we know about
him is that he\'s rich, he started the Imperium cause it was a good move
for Zhunastu Inc., and he apparently has his political rivals assasinated. 
The Cleon described recently in a proposed adventure plot was a much more
interesting person than the one presented in M:0 precisely because he
_was_ a great figure with big dreams and abilities but was also in other
ways merely human and driven by human passsions. I agree that it\'s 
realistic for Cleon to do some less than savory things, but is that _all_ 
he does?

	On the second point (from way above) the economic plan for the
Imperium was not a good one, either economically or morally.  I\'m setting
aside the moral question so that we can get away from the "fairy-tale"
issue.  
	You have described a whole system for killing off political
leaders, debasing currencies, extracting all mineral wealth, etc.  M:0
assumes that somehow all of this is necessary for integrating worlds
economically into the 3I.  I honestly don\'t know why any of this is 
important.  First off, why is there this assumption that all worlds will 
be ruled by a bunch of petty tyrants?  Earth is presently a TL-8 balkanized 
society probably not unlike many that Sylea would encounter and there are 
at least a few progressive, representative governments that Sylea would 
have no need to topple to productively trade with.  There are also probably 
plenty of worlds out there that aren\'t balkanized and are ruled by a 
government smart enough to see the many advantages of off-world trade.  
Besides, I thought there was extensive canon to support a very 
"hands-off" 3I that didn\'t care what local government was like so long as 
they obeyed a few simple rules, allowed free trade, paid taxes, etc.
	Second, there are plenty of things that can be traded to these 
worlds in exchange for their mineral wealth that would enhance their long 
term productivity and not involve intentionally debasing their currency.  
Fusion+, communications gear, contra-grav vehicles, j-drives, regular 
fusion, nuclear dampers, and most of all capital goods would all be in 
enormous demand.  Getting the natives to use the Imperial Credit for lots 
of transactions should also be easy since it will be the basis of 
interstellar trade.  Look at the number of currencies backed by the USD!  
For domestic transactions they\'ll probably use the local guilders or 
whatever, but it won\'t really matter since most of these local currencies 
will be pegged to the IC.  Those worlds that choose not to do this are 
probably the ones that are still low-tech and backward in 1100, because 
they were never able to attract off-planet investment or generate much 
trade.  
	As for the gold-standard somehow being more stable or viable then
a freely floating currency, this is really something of a myth.  A 
currency is as stable as demand for the goods that back it.  For the USD, 
that means goods produced anywhere the currency is USD or is backed by 
USD.  For the Pacific islanders who use big round rocks as currency, this 
is backed by their economic output.  The Bank of Hawaii will even make 
loans with these big rocks as collateral because they recognize that it 
doesn\'t matter whether money is paper, or gold, or a big rock, it\'s still 
money.  The advantage gold has is that lots of people historically have 
wanted it, so it was a safer store of value then the output of any one 
country.  This has its own problems though because a shortage or surplus 
of gold (or big rocks or whatever) can cause inflation or deflation as 
well as credit crunches.  We went through a set of recessions and 
financial crises in the late 19th century because the supply of gold was 
not keeping up with the economy\'s growth rate.  It was a gold strike in 
Alaska that finally restored liquidity.

	You seem to have the IMO mistaken notion that war builds 
infrastructure.  In fact, it destroys it in huge volumes.  War is the 
fastest way to reduce a people to poverty ever devised.
	Your point that developing infrastructure and the workforce for 
the purpose of producing exports is good business is precisely _my_ 
point.  Why not got straight to this without first trashing the planet 
with wars, coups, financial chaos, etc.

	As I\'ve explained above, worlds will want to move to a currency 
backed by the IC on their own because the IC will be more widely demanded 
and more useful than gold, therefore it will be a more stable thing to 
base one\'s currency on.  The gold-standard is by no stretch of the 
imagination a threat to the preeminance of Imperial currency.

	Unless you are dealing with a totally xenophobic world that 
refuses to see the benefits of interstellar trade, they\'ll want to open 
their doors regardless.  There\'s no need to bankrupt them first.  If some 
planet wants to take advantage of all the trade generated by the Imperium 
without joining it, then Cleon can just slap a big tariff on all their 
goods.  Then they have the choice of remaining isolated or joining the 
interstellar community through the 3I.  If they really are xenophobes 
then maybe it\'s time to do the Adm. Perry number on them and open their 
ports forcefully.

> That was the aim, as explained above. What you describe sounds more like

	Right, the Imperium just starts wars, sells the despots guns, 
picks a new ruler, and then deposes him with a coup, followed by robbing 
the world of its mineral wealth and destroying its financial system, 
before finally forcing them onto their knees so that they have no choice 
but to join the evil empire that got them into the mess in the first 
place.

	I don\'t think wars ever kill-off the gung-ho types, they just 
create a lot of pain, fear, and hatred that breeds new generations of 
killers.  Look at N. Ireland, Palestine, Lebanon, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia....
	As for all of this stuff about clean and quick coup-de-gras with a
new ruler installed friendly to the Imperium, look at the kind of regimes
this created when the US and French tried this during the Cold War in SE
Asia and Africa.  We got the worst, most corrupt despots of all.  You
can\'t create stable political and economic institutions through civil wars
and internecine conflict.

	Actually, history has not been kind to Rockefeller and especially 
Rhodes.  They\'re both considered ruthless SOBs and Rhodes was probably 
quite a murderer to boot.  I wasn\'t holding them up as good examples of 
heroic behavior, but as fascinating characters who were important on the 
world stage.  They were both probably more admired in their own time than 
in ours.  JJ Astor was wealthy but had made much fewer enemies since he 
was involved in commerce rather than industry or conquest.  JJ didn\'t 
feel the need to crush anyone under his boot heel to become the richest 
man in America.

Actually the vaccuum welding and lubricant problems both aren\'t that
critical. The thing can operate for a long time with no lubricant, and
there aren\'t all that many precisely matching metal faces for vaccuum
welding, which takes a fair amount of time. 

Revolvers are remarkably low-tech...trying to visualize a complete

only about ten or so moving parts, maybe less. Certainly my black powder
.44 has fewer moving parts. 

Although, you\'re right. It wouldn\'t be my first choice for standard issue
sidearm for zero-G vaccuum work. ;-)

Reminder: TL is not the  same  as  scientific  knowledge.  I  can
believe that many worlds retain their  scientific  knowledge  (in
their libraries and through \'Seldon Plans\') but what is  lost  is
the industrial capability (not  just  capacity).  They  may  know
what componants go into a Jump-3 drive ... and know how  to  make
these componants ... but may have lost the techniques to make the
tools to make the componants.  And some times the  best  Tech  is
not  always  economically  successful   (how   many   _different_
supersonic passenger aircraft do you know of) thus are  discarded
and later forgotten (like Betamax).

Also, don\'t underestimate the drawbacks of specialisation ...  if
planet X builds Jump-3 drives with widgets  from  planet  Y  then
planet X may not have bothered to know how to make widgets in the
first place.  So when trade with planet Y ceases, planet X has to
give up making Jump-3 drives.

In the main, though, it is very true.  Not because it must be, but because
it is easier and cheaper to slack off on something than to get everything
right.  Further, many games are the brainchild of one person, and if that
person is not both a bugbear on content and on format, you can easily have
one of the two slacked off on.  As time is passing, games are more likely
the work of several people, and thus more likely to have someone who cares
about every aspect of the process.  Perhaps more useful, the cost of entry
is getting high enough that a game is likely to come from a company willing
to pay for decent production values, which makes worrying about formats
more common.  If you are paying a printer for a four color cover, you might
just spend the time to make sure that the art on that cover is good.

You just hit it on the head.  Artwork is now part of the format of the
book, which was not true in the late seventies.  Look at typical war games
- - one nice illo on the front, and on the cover of the manual, maybe, and
none at all on the inside.

Now look at the games coming out today - drizzled with illustrations and
pictures.  Even the early T4 books had some Bulbous Foss Art on the covers,
and IG\'s formatting people needed a sharp boot to the head.

As a result, it is quite true that to sell to today\'s crowd, you do need
the cover art and the interior art.  You also need proofreaders who speak
the language, editors who can spell and format grammatical sentences, and
you need authors who have some desire to be consistent.  T4 had some of the
latter at certain times, but had few of the former at some critical points.

This does not mean you can ignore content, only that the audiences have
become sophisticated enough to demand the same standards which are common
in other parts of the publishing industry.  I just picked up a book on
differential equations that has at least one illustration of a DE per page,
something that would have been prohibitive in the Old Days.

So, what does NT (New Traveller) need?  A parent company with the cash to
afford good art, the will to edit, format, proof, print, and reprint the
books.  A line manager who is willing to force authors to use Traveller
terms.  (I do not care if you think it is a local term.  Use the term
Starbase in a Traveller supplement, and you are DEAD, as far as my
purchases go.)  A writer\'s guide so that an author CAN write compliant
supplements.

Now, if it can get all of these, the exact details become hazy.  Runequest
was almost killed by being adopted by Avalon Hill, despite the higher
production values and vastly better editing/proofing, partly because AH and
Chaosium got into a rather nasty snit, right about when they should have
been introducing adventures.


Personally, I think what all new games need is an equal mix of rulebooks,
sourcebooks, and adventure books, in roughly equal parts.  My list, for a
new company:

Rules:

1.  Basic rulebook, with enough to start playing immediately.
2.  Gearhed book, a la FF&S2
3.  Starship, vehicle, and equipment book

Sources:

1.  Local campaign book, like M0.  Include maps, people, conspiracies, and
so on.  This lets the cheap ref start out with a consistent world, with
just one purchase.
2.  A service book, like "Navy life" or "Merchanting for fun"  This gives
players the feel that they are "in the milieu".  It has far more specific
jargon, and far more focus.  It is similar to the "thieves handbook"
created by TSR, so that someone who has an archetype character can get it
pretty much right.  GURPS special ops is a lot like this.
3.  Support materials - like Traders and Gunboats, some thing which a GM
can use to fight off it has a map, so it is important."

Adventures:

Three big adventures, using people mentioned in the campaign book, and
locations mentioned there.  At least one big conspiracy.

These adventures should, if properly done, include lots of people, lots of
maps, and lots of encounters.  nugget format is nice, as is a list of
events that must happen, and their ordering.  Random encounters that may or
may not advance the plot are also good, as then players do not have to 

If a game system offers all of these things, then they have a pretty good
chance of catching a given set of players.  Consider - all you need to have
to start out is the main rulebook, and you need at least one copy of a
campaign book or adventure book if you do not come up with these on your own.

DMs who do not have the time to create things will buy your support and
adventure books, while players will have your focus books.  That way,
virtually every player can play with little investment, but will see a
benefit from buying the nine books.

For this to work, they have to look reasonably slick, but that does not
mean expensive art.  It does mean attention to detail, good proofs, and
care in the creation.  FF&S2 was marred rather substantially by a simple
typo - I have done mathematics for so long that a formula that uses
unfamiliar symbology takes a lot longer to parse than one done with TeX.
The failure of printing cast doubt on all the contents on a visceral level.
 If you do not care about the look as a company, then your products do not
feel professional.

I think I would allow it in my campaign, but I would increase the 
amount of time it would take to link ships dependant on how many 
ships are to be linked. I would make the assumption that adding more 
ships to the link would increase the complexity of the job it would 
take to link them.

IIRC, I think there was a discussion last week or so that concerned 
an alternative jump drive system that someone was using that figured 
in "cumulative errors" in J-space navigation. I don\'t know if it\'s 
applicable to normal J-drives though.

The idea wasn\'t to give examples of kind and gentle men - it was to give
examples of men who had more to them than the depiction of Cleon as 
some kind of crowned, money-sucking vampire...

But I\'ll bow to John Macpherson\'s more eloquent argument on this.

I guess I just have to ask - how many of the writers ran games in this 
universe?  How many games are being run in this universe by TML members?
(and that\'s as depicted - if your 3I agents aren\'t out crippling every 
TL4 world they find for the good of His Imperial Majesty, you aren\'t

Sounds reasonable to me, but I would make it a feature that would add 
cost to a J-drive when a ship is constructed, and be a difficult and 
expensive item to "retrofit". I would think that it would be a 
standard feature on military ships though. Perhaps you might want to 
make the link a bit more stable and faster when linking ships of the 
same class too, since their systems would be almost identical.

There is an MT adventure called "Ghost Ship" in DGP\'s  Digest  14
which covers this.  The party have to link a ship with a  damaged
Jump Drive to a ship with  a  damaged  Power  Plant  ...  in  the
wilderness.

The procedure  descibes  3  linkages  ...  a  physical  brace  to
securely hold the two ships  together  and  allow  the  lanthanum
grids to operate as one unit ... a power link ... and  a  control
systems link.

There is a Q&A in one of the old Traveller\'s Digests where jump calculations
for entire fleets is discussed.  The thrust of it was that it is possible
for the navigators on each ship to work together to ensure that the ships
exit jump space very close together (time-wise).  If anyone really wants to
know the details, I can dig it up.  Just lemmee know . . .

The cheaper that desktop publishing has become, the cheaper legitimate
publishing has become.  I\'m not saying that you have to have tons of
full-color artwork throughout or anything, I\'m just saying that you have to
look at least as good as the book next to you on the shelf.

After all, if you were going for a job, you wouldn\'t hand in a handwritten
piece of looseleaf with greasy pizza stains as your resume, would you?

IG fumbled the ball, even though some of us (like me) had faith until the
very end that IG would come around, it seemed to just make good sense that
they would.  They just didn\'t have the heart.

Of course.  I wouldn\'t dream of saying you should pawn off a book with no
content based on its artistic merit.

Yes yes yes yes yes.  All across the board.  I\'ve already mentioned to FFE

instant to whatever company decides to give Trav a whirl next...

This would be an excellent addition, kind of like Mercenary, High Guard,
Scouts and Merchant Prince with more detail on the feel of the services,
not just new rules to use for them.

You don\'t need expensive art.  But, you can\'t leave art out, or just throw
in a dozen full page pieces and think that suffices, especially when only
half of the pictures have anything to do with the text.

That\'s a truly strange way of doing things.  Seems to make no sense, and is

the books.  It just so happens that WotC owns the company.  If you wanted

you\'d send them to TSR.

I\'ve never used the D6 system, but from descriptions of it this looks much
like it.  I know you were praising the StarWars RPG (which uses D6) the
last couple of weeks, is this similar to that system?

Speaking of D6 and Starwars, I\'ve been thinking about buying a copy to take
a look at it.  If I\'m just interested in the mechanics, not the background,
will I get that if I buy the D6 book...and save 15 to 20 bucks?

I\'ve read good and bad reviews on the Silhouette system.  Generally more
positive than negative, though.  As I understand it, the Silhouette system
takes up only a dozen pages in HG or JC, and if you don\'t really want the
background you\'re paying a big premium.  Is there "stuff" in HG and/or JC
that would interest a Traveller GM..other than Silhouette?

I thought Heavy Gear was mostly a "Big Robots Duke It Out Game", ala
Battletech, and Jovian Chronicles was DreamPod\'s RPG, am I wrong about
that?

Anyway, do you mind a few questions?

Again, is this a point system, or is there some sort of career process

Hum, isn\'t there also something about if you roll a 6 you roll again? Or is
it that if you have more than one 6 the extra 6\'s add to your score as
1\'s..something like that?

    eg- The sheriff isn\'t impressed with his shot, so Ivan goes a step
        farther.  He tries to shoot a spinning quarter out of the air.
        For *this* trick the GM rules that he needs an 8!  
        
        Ivan rolls 6 6 3, so he adds (6+1+2 = 9).  He succeeds with a
        +1, so the GM decides that he "centered" the quarter rather than
        "just" clipping it...finally impressing the sheriff.

I like the concept of Silhouette, if I\'ve got it straight, but I don\'t know
if the numbers "crunch" well, or how the concepts of Traveller style Tasks
would translate.  

Besides, if I\'m going to use a point system, with a single die why wouldn\'t
I use CORPS?  

Maybe this isn\'t the place to ask it, and I *don\'t* want to set off Task
Wars, but I\'d really like to see the proponents of various systems post
reviews of them, and how they fit with Traveller.  We have people here that
use:

GURPS
CORPS
D6 (Starwars)
FUDGE
FUZION (or Hero anyway)
Silhouette

...among others, to play Traveller.

Do you think it would be possible for the proponents of each system to post
how their favorite system works with Traveller?  What they like best? 
Least?  How they handle point vs random character generation? How close, or
far away, from Traveller\'s skill set do they go?  How well does it fit with
the "feel" of Traveller and into the orthodox background?

Or do you think if anybody tried something like that they would be torched
in the ensuing flames?

The problem is that it\'s a fairly trivial task, given FFS2\'s sensor ranges,
to build a small ship that can act as a sensor picket.

Assuming that you jump in to a distant point, refuel and then go attack the
mainworld (or whatever) is that the mainworld will be prepared when you
actually come in.

It seems to me that this would result very early on in the locals realizing
that the real enemy was the 3I.  Once the locals get wind of the 3I being
the evil masterminds behind the destruction of the economy, government, and
way of life, you will have serious economic dislocation, and corresponding
hatred.  If the 3I folk do not act in accordance with their stated beliefs,
it becomes even more obvious.  (Even if they get a few worlds, eventually,
someone is going to spot the connection if they do it too often.)

As a present day example, we are very good nowadays at spotting the real
fiscal purpose behind the so-called charitable organization.  Similarly,
people in the M0 era should be able to spot fairly quickly the kind of
behaviors that are common, if the ZSC is the standard method of connecting
with a new culture.  Furthermore, anyone who had a trace of the honor
talked about in the books would have a hard time considering a deal
designed to destroy the fabric of the victim society honorable.

NB, I am not claiming that the 3I was particularly honorable, only that it
is portrayed as such, and so either the people living at the time thought
it was, and thus would be aware of when they were going "beyond the pale."
About the only thing we have to go on is the number of times both Cleon and
his detractors called "honor" into question.  If they did not want it a
focus, it would not have been mentioned so many times.

Your history is your only credit in diplomacy.  With this kind of history,
anyone who hears about the Imperium is going to know that the 3I is the
enemy.  Consider - travel may be expensive, but M0 is filled with examples
of traders and navies operating YEARS outside the borders of the Imperium.
With this kind of traffic, there will be crosstalk.  People will find out
what the 3I has done, and if they actually have this kind of history, they
will be diplomatically doomed.


Had the ZSC had its main policy be, instead, "one world, one government.
No exceptions."  then objections to the "there can be only one" policies
becomes a moot point.  People know what is coming, and feel somewhat safer.
 This might be politically harder, as then planetary sovereignty is
challenged, but at least the rest of the universe is not going to be
stunned to hear that the 3I is resculpting planetary governments.

Destroying a government you helped put in place, though, is a terrible
idea, as nobody trusts you again to help them, or even contact them.
Certainly, those who had not yet joined would eventually find out, and
would likely try banding together.  The policy of ignoring all of the
dangerous worlds in Core to concentrate on the ones militarily unable to
help out would seem to make this more dangerous - anyone in Core is going
to know the character of the 3I.  As a result, economic self interest would
indicate playing as straight as needed to keep warfare from breaking out on
the frontier, and revolution in the interior.

As always, it is a matter of scale - if Zhunastu did this once in a hundred
worlds, then people may not have heard, and the worlds would not complain.
Doing this on virtually every world means that everyone finds out fast, and
M0, to me, implied that the ZSC policies were regularly in use on every
world they could get to.

I doubt whether most pre-existing regimes were oppressive or exploitive
until the ZSC people came knocking.  Some, certainly, were, but stable
government is not compatible with oppression, over the long term.  Also,
most worlds are rather proud of their militaries, and once they get even a
hint that the outsiders are working together, then they are going to be
VERY suspicious.  In effect, they are running planet wide conspiracies that
attack (in the minds of the natives) their most cherished institutions.
Not to put to fine a point on it, I know a number of Irish who will not
talk to anyone who is Scot\'s Irish even now, generations away from the home
soil.

Consider - from the point of view of the locals, the first actions in the
ZSC will most likely cause a worldwide depression by undermining the
currency, the manufacturing, and the social structures.  (Social structure
is not directly addressed, but when you hit the first two, as well as
discrediting the military, you are going to cause dislocation.  Major
warfare will also have serious economic implications.)  When a major goal
of your work is the removal of the backing for currency and the reliance on
foreign currency and trade goods for vital industrial process, you are
going to have someone who figures it out.


I do not doubt that these techniques were used successfully occasionally, I
just do not think this can be the default strategy.

Considering the present situation on Earth.   Would it work to tell us
straight out that Imperial trade must take place in manufactured goods,
Imperial credits, and raw materials, and point out that trade issues are
settled with one and only one body on the planet?  Would it work better to
skulk behind the scenes, and engineer the alteration of our world economy
and the revaluation into Imperial credits and dependence on Imperial
machinery?

I think we might do better on both sides if the process was above board,
and if enlightened self interest was made fairly clear.  For example -
fusion plants bought with Imperial credits get a ten percent discount.
Taxes by Imperial corporations on local soil are paid in Imperial credits.
And so on - this is the kind of trade war that the 3I will win, but which
will not cause nearly as many people to be out of work, uneducated, and poor.

In my mind, trying to get every last credit from the planet is bad
business, because the people are going to figure out very fast that every
dime that is important goes off planet, and that they are not getting new
infrastructure and new training that makes them wealthy.  But then, I
figure the most likely response to off planet intervention is mistrust.
Credulous locals might not see the problem.

My reading of M0 differs from yours.  I know you are describing what you
meant to communicate, but I read it rather differently, as did the three
people I asked to read it.  In their minds, they imagined the introduction
of sweatshops to exploit native labor, and absolutely minimal education, as
well as the overturn of the social order.  The capital investments seemed
to be primarily in means of paying the offworlders for the goods you now
need to have to survive, as your infrastructure has been flattened by
technological change.

It seems more likely that the population is going to want to feel in charge
of their destiny, and that it is very hard to get a conspiracy to work.  In
general, if you behave in accordance with your societal principles, then
you have some kind of consistency, which means that as long as your
societal principles are aligned with your goals, you will likely achieve
them.  In the case of the 3I, those goals are expansion, stability, and a
lack of threats.  In my mind, this requires more uplift than the ZSC
methods would likely do.

NB, I do not disagree that many companies nowadays would take a "next
fiscal quarter" approach, but I think this is an aberration, and will
result in a serious economic adjustment.  If you do not plan for the short
(five year) term, you cannot survive very well when you hit someone who
can.  The 3I has the cultural heritage of a people who planned for
centuries, and survived for millennia, and people who planned for the short
term, and crashed.  Hopefully, they figured out that you need to go for the
long term dollar as well as the short, and sometimes, letting some else get
rich can make you richer.

Here is where I disagree, I think.  A better approach, imho, would be to
ignore the local currency.  Allow them to continue to use it, and do not
try depleting gold stocks.  Instead, allow those who have the material
wealth to use it to buy off planet goods.  This will accomplish the same
end, but the different reason means that you are more likely to get the
effect you want.  In my mind, if you try to accomplish two ends, you are
more likely to accomplish none, whereas one end might just be doable.  In
my mind, the ZSC goal is to introduce Imperial credits, Imperial
technology, and Imperial work with minimal disruption to their social
structure, as then, people are more likely to buy your non military goods.
Further, you need local manufacturing, because shipping across stars is
expensive, and the canonical prices seem to assume a 90% subsidy, if my
reading of present day prices is any indicator.

If they feel it is being rammed down their throats, they are not going to
be nearly as happy as if it a much desired prize.  Further, you are more
likely to have people who understand the world running it if the nobles and
wealthy created by this influx were in the main powerful prior to the
change on this world.  IMTU, I solved this with trade classifications, and
worlds had to work quite hard to get better classifications which allowed
purchase of more goods.  The primary rule was that technology which would
completely destabilize the realm was in general not imported, while
anything that could improve education levels, core infrastructure, and
other things like that could be.  I also allowed Imperial veterans far
greater latitude and a break on duties, which encouraged ex military to go
back to their home worlds as seeds of technical knowledge and equipment.

I argue whether the plan was self sustaining, simply because I assume a
lot less acceptance, and a lot more information flow.  It is very hard to
keep people from finding out your diplomatic past, especially with the
sieve like borders the Imperium kept.  As a result, Cleon\'s hammering away
about honor will become a strength, rather than hypocrisy.  In another
post, I will put out my own version of the period.  I have adopted a number
of the ideas from M0, but I think I had a different slant that you did.

My complaint was not their attempts to maximize profit so much as their
seeming unawareness of the incredible level of resentment the stated ZSC
policies would produce.  This resentment would produce a new wave of
Luddites, and it seems like they could do a better job by having some
allies as well.  It was my feeling that 3I corporations would be a lot
clearer on the long term benefits of development that expanded markets and
buying power.  As a result, the ZSC policies, which seemed a lot more like
a way to push the locals aside and take over completely, did not mesh well
for me.

Agreed.  There are degrees, though.  A ruler with principles is often
better remembered by history, and often more popular than one without.
Those principles do not have to mean doing things not in line with
reasonable business practice, only that the actions selected are those in
accordance with societal expectation and some degree of long term planning,
which the ZSC rules do not seem to be.  How, after all, are the locals
going to react when they find out that the President, the Premier, and the
Prime Minister were all supported until the time came for the Shah to take
over, who was then cut off and isolated, while a trade consortium came down.

The Navy can stop any given revolt, but you cannot have too many of them
before civil wart saps your expansionistic ability.

You miss an important point, I think.  Having someone want to improve the
world, bring back technology and civilization, and become disgustingly
wealthy and powerful are not irreconcilable goals.  Someone whose only aim
was improvement of the human condition would be unlikely to become Emperor,
but someone who felt that proper action was important might do very well.
If nothing else, by making sure that resentment is low, an Emperor can have
a stronger Empire.  One good way to keep resentment low is to make people
feel like they are a part of it, and further, that it has always been this
way.

Let me be a bit more specific.  Cleon, IMTU, is one of the good guys.
Hard, cold, and brutal at need, but his end goal is a unified, strong,
expansionistic Imperium.  One of his major choices was a rejection of
Vilani common culture, and so he had to allow planets a reasonable degree
of sovereignty.  He also wants the process to continue, which means Sylea
cannot be the only source of trained technicians, ships, and equipment, and
thus worlds get plentiful grants to build up their industrial base.  (I
know, this is very non canon.)

"Irurk is happy to be part of the 3I.  We are better fed, better clothed,
and better paid now than before.  Our fourteenth king is ruling well, and
the House of Commons is delighted with the new cell phones that let every
member of the body politic register their feelings with their ministers.
Our traditional holidays are coming up, and our lives are much like they
used to be, save for the odd person going off to the Imperial school."


The above is a good sign, since people do, in general, want things to
continue as they have been.  By making it possible to feel both a part of
something new, as well as part of an old tradition, you make the Imperium a
stronger body, imho.

We may be more in agreement than I thought.  Why not have the engines of
creation spring into being, though, early in the M0 period, rather than
after.  The consolidations wars are going to make for some rather nasty
fights, and it seems less likely to get that kind of idealism win the midst
of a major war than in a period of expansion.  Consider - the first few
years are among the quieter years in terms of open warfare.

Certainly a possibility, but it would be hard, imho, to recover from the
potentially disastrous early days, and the mistakes made.  I do believe
that every one of the events you talked about took place, just not that
this was the primary contact technique.  I have read that section as
propaganda by people who did not agree, based on the relatively small
number of worlds where it did happen.  IMTU, the cynical and corrupt regime
being replaced is the Sylean Federation, and the young, idealistic state is
the 3I.  Other interpretations are, of course, possible, but it seems to me
that this keeps a degree of consistency until the expansionistic Imperium
runs out of steam, and starts consuming itself.

A true thing, and why I have made a point of trying to set my M0 campaign
in a world that does have heroes.  They are aware of the failing of the
commoners and the great, and have far more resources to discover any
peccadillos, but as a society, the 3I is willing to believe in the concept
of the hero, and thus is willing to cut some degree of slack to both the
heroes and the normal folk.  They are not terribly forgiving beyond a
certain level, so gross incompetence or villainy will not work very well,
but the petty levels are usually ignored.

I do think we would be in a better world were we more willing to forgive
the small stuff and concentrate on the large issues today.  Not ignorance
of failings or blanket forgiveness for crimes, just a simple acceptance of
human nature and limitations.

I\'m working on a modular jump freighter.  Its a thick 350 dTon disk with a 100 ton
bay for a modular cutter. (8) 15 dTon modules clip onto the perimeter but the flats
are clear.  Its equiped with a Lanthanum coil jump drive which produces a spherical
bubble large enough for an 800 dTon spherical ship.  The idea is that two domeships
clip onto the flats for jumps.  In the sphere configuration, it is jump2 capable.
Shedding the domes, it can perform jump3.

The concept is that you can mate several disks together.  Theoretically an unlimited
quantity (like a stack of coins) can be linked.  Practically, it\'s limited by the
interconnections the master computer can handle (probably TL modules).  Since you\'re
using modular jacks, connections are very fast. Initial lockdown is immediate, fuel,
power and computer linkage would take a couple man-hours each. Each jump drive would
have to be individually prepared, but in theory you\'ve got complete crews for each
freighter.

In addition to the domes described above, I\'m planning thrust modules to attach at
the end, like a locomotive.  Then the whole linked column could land like a
skyscraper...

As I\'m envisioning it, jump coils produce a spherical jump bubble. Thus spherical
ships don\'t need the jump grid.  Other ships need the jumpgrid to stretch the jump
bubble into an appropriate shape (lest they leave behind parts sticking outside the
bubble).  In theory, you could inefficiently do without the jumpgrid by getting a
jump drive large enough to create a jump sphere with a diameter equal to the length
of the ship.  But this would be 27 times larger than it needs to be in the case of a
needle ship.

Dallas\' `Java ring\' stores data 

Dallas Semiconductor has released the Crypto iButton, a hardware token
that runs on the Java Card 2.0 specification
and can be attached to rings, watches, wallets, and other articles to
provide authentication and data storage capabilities.
The company distributed several thousand copies on "Java rings" at JavaOne
in San Francisco last week. 

The iButton allows users to store private keys for encrypting messages,
sign digital documents, store personal
preferences, and other capabilities on the token. The iButton communicates
through a Blue Dot Receptor that creates a
pipeline to existing computers, and it is available at a price of $15. The
company also offers an iButton Toolkit for Java
for developers, priced at $50. 

The Crypto iButton, which implements a Java virtual machine, is a
monolithic chip with a high-speed, 8-bit
microprocessor, 32KB of ROM, 6KB of nonvolatile static RAM, a True Time
clock, and a high-speed math accelerator
for 1024-bit public key cryptography. The iButton Java ring is available
now at a price of $59.50. 

Dallas Semiconductor, in Dallas, is at http://www.dalsemi.com.

There is the Traveller Culture Development List (formerly the

through active and inactive phases.  Right now, Kenji has just
goaded us into a mildly active phase.  Mail to

I asked this question of my roommate (a B.S. Physics), in the
form "Fiber Optic Conduit - Laser - Discharge - Possible?".  He
indicated that he does not see it as possible; if the laser can
be conducted, it probably would be too weak to do anything; if
it\'s strong enough to do anything, it will probably vaporize the
conduit.

Now, that\'s strictly an issue of heat dissipation; if you can
sensibly handwave a conduit material that\'s 99.99999....%
efficient at dumping waste heat, or if you can cryofreeze the
conduits, you might be able to pull it off.  Or, if you have a
massively high temperature superduperconductor.  But those will
tend to unbalance things somehow; someone will always figure out
a use for it that wasn\'t forseen.

Can\'t say yea or nay on that one, but Fredonia (one \'e\', same
pronunciation) is a town in upstate NY which is home to a State
University of New York campus (SUNY College at Fredonia), which
college is in turn home to the allegedly famous Fredonia Jazz

to school there, but can\'t confirm.

Good thinking - I just grabbed the TNS (4/2, 21:00 EST), and,

As long as I am goring sacred cows, I might as well weigh in.

Specialization could cause a lot of problems if the interstellar net goes
down, but there are limits about just how far it is worth shipping
something.  Consider - if there is a source three parsecs away for Widgets,
and you have a J3 drive, you need to pay on the order a 20% markup to get
the stuff delivered from there by J3 ship, as opposed to a world just one
parsec away.

Now, if your desired parts are 9 parsecs away, then you will start seeing
three month turnaround times, assuming very efficient shippers, and that is
assuming that it is even worth paying the rather large shipment costs.  It
is more likely to be worth finding a source for Widgets that is closer than
that.  At what point, for instance, is it worth pay8ng a premium to get
them just a month after the order, rather than six?

From this perspective, I can see off planet imports staying important,
since higher tech goods will almost always need to be produced elsewhere,
but I cannot quite see it going much more than one jump of whatever length
is appropriate, save for really valuable goods.  Examples of the latter -
TL 15 goods in the Spinward Marches, Meson guns and screens if there are no
other TL12 worlds about, and so on.

As a result, it is pretty unlikely that trade with Planet Y is going to
cease without warning on an Imperium-wide scale, since they are just one
jump away.  I can believe a consolidation that caused massive
infrastructure moves, such as a wealthy world making sure that the
technologies it wanted were all available.

FWIW, I have the Long Night being caused by artificially low populations.
TL 9 in my opinion requires ~100 million people, unless they are fanatics,
and thus when trade was disrupted for more than a few decades, the worlds
below pop 8 or so had to create new economies.  Many did, massively
shipping people between worlds to make up a few more populous ones, and
others allowed TL to drop to a sustainable point.

IG was notoriously bad at dealing with orders (ask Rob Prior if you want a
really bad story). FFE had nothing to do with the distribution of T4 - Marc
is just selling old CT/MT/TNE stuff he got from the clearout of GDW\'s
warehouses. I suspect that Marc also gets silly volumes of email...

You really need to approach a distributer, but I can\'t recommend any in the
US. I can recommend a UK (London) based company but I suspect you are in
the US and you don\'t want to pay the 50% surcharge on postage.

They probably will, but you may still want to use a retailer/mail order
company. Perhaps one of the US list members can recommend somewhere.

Probably. And it\'ll all end in tears when T4.1 gets published with the task

It could be done, but I reckon that flames will erupt pretty quickly.

or paint used to taint the money and make it unusable and hopefully stain
the bad guy, too.) Of course, the bank teller said OK, and of course, she
put one in anyway.

Well, the robber runs off with the money. But, as he runs off he puts the

but the reinactment made it look rather painful.

Try out the show if it\'s in your area. Many laughs and many ideas for

both of these masses to Earth in precalculated orbits so that they
hit and enter the crust at the same time on opposite sides of the 
planet.  These masses spiral around each other all the way to the
core, creating massive earthquakes on their way (please note that
anti-neutronium will evidently not react explosively with normal
matter due to the electrons which act to keep the normal neutrons
well away from the anti-neutronium).  Previously, self replicating
machines built and planted numerous multi-megaton devices all along
the tectonic rifts.  At the moment that the neutronium and 
anti-neutronium meet, the nuclear devices fire fracturing the plates.
And thus the Earth explodes like an egg in the microwave.

In case you\'re wondering the remains of the planet are used to build
more hunter-killer ships.

That\'ll probably get most of them.  You might want to be sure by 
mounting thrust plates on one side of the planet (powered by the

Just to be sure that the smart fog doesn\'t decide to point the

orbit.  That way they can destroy the fusion plants and thrust plates
if anything goes wrong.

I\'m currently playing my own version of GURPS Traveller, in anticipation of
the official playtest.  One reason I am so eager to participate in the
playtest is that GURPS and Traveller are not a very good match:  the
assumptions about characters on which the games are based are very
different.  I want to see what Loren makes of this.

I was never very fond of totally random character generation, so I\'ve
fudged in the direction of player control of the process for years.
Roll-and-assign characteristics, choose skills, adjust after the fact to
better conform to character concept, etc.  GURPS works well to create
specific, literary-style characters, but it is \'way too complicated and
detailed to model Traveller easily, and it is extremely difficult to scale
down to lower resolution.  (I posted my attempt in that direction a couple
of weeks ago - an abbreviated GURPS skills list designed for Traveller).

For equipment, however, I use FF&S1 and GURPS Vehicles 2d Ed. pretty much
interchangably, depending more on what I\'m trying to design than on which
system it is for.  I use the real world numbers common to both (muzzle
energy, mass, power, etc.) to convert as required.  In my copious free
time, I\'m planning to design the standard CT ship types under VE2 -
although I\'m also looking for the \'official\' tech level conversion from the
GT playtest.

What is it with the today\'s youth, eh? I ask you - what happened? I 
think the Sayat influence on this list can be clearly seen, as people 
assume I that by showing to the world the LIES of CAPITALISTIC 
EXPLOITERS I must be automatically a PINKO COMMIE MUTANT TRAITOR! 

Ha! 

Me, a propagator of Teocratical Feudal Technocracy!

This is insane!

Yes, WotC bought out Gamma World, then buried it for all time.  I don\'t
even think that bloody "Star Gate" from the movie was as well hidden and

I\'ve been boning up on GURPS for the same reason.  In the past, I\'ve worked
on ways to get Traveller and GURPS together, but have never followed all
the way through with a game..much less campaign.  I honestly can\'t tell you
why, GURPS worked well in a fantasy game and a Tw2k crossover I GM\'ed
*years* ago, and I played in a space game that worked too.

>I want to see what Loren makes of this.

Yes.

I\'ve never been fond of totally point-purchase OR totally random character
generation, but I do *like* the develop during a career method that is the
soul (to steal an expression from the absent HH) of Traveller.

Here\'s one of many possible semi-random Stat generation ideas:

    Distribute (20 + 6d6) among the 6 attributes, minimum 2, maximum 12

    The player can tailor the distribution as he sees fit, but the
    actual number varies enough to keep the results unpredictable.

>GURPS works well to create specific, literary-style characters, but it
>is \'way too complicated and detailed to model Traveller easily, and it

Yes, it\'s much too easy to get bogged down.  That\'s why I have been asking
about something called Career Templates over on the GURPS list. If I
understand this concept right, they are the basic requirements for careers,
*partially* created characters.  If someone whats to play a Starship Pilot
with a Merchant background, they could take Templates for each and have 3/4
of their character finished right there...the rest is the customization
needed to make the character uniquely theirs.

>(I posted my attempt in that direction a couple of weeks ago - an
abbreviated GURPS skills list designed for Traveller).

Could you send me a copy. I either missed it or it missed me.

Okay, let me put this another way.  Okay, if Merc Pharmaceuticals <ugh... 
I never could spell that word> buys, say, Calgon Vestal Labs, then who do
you go to when you want to complain about a Calgon Vestal product?  Do you
send the complaint to Merc or Calgon Vestal?  Calgon Vestal.  If you have
business with Merc, you send it to Merc.

Now, WotC acquired TSR.  TSR is still TSR and deals with TSR stuff.  WotC
is still WotC and still deals with WotC stuff.  Although WotC owns TSR,
WotC is not TSR, it just owns TSR.  TSR is not WotC, it is just owned by
WotC.  WotC might be nice enough to forward TSR stuff to TSR, but perhaps
they aren\'t.  To save on confusion, stuff intended for TSR should be sent
to TSR.  Stuff intended for WotC should be sent to WotC.  If you have
business with TSR, send it to TSR not WotC.  WotC owns the rights to TSR\'s
products, because it owns TSR, but, to repeat myself WotC is *not* TSR and
TSR is *not* WotC.

Maybe, maybe not.  SJG produces several rpgs, GURPS, In Nomie, Toon, Car
Wars, all of which *could* be in competition with each other, but can also
supplement each other.  There *are* economies of scale.

I feel about WoC the way I feel about MicroSoft, and it ain\'t a *good*

probably isn\'t interested in *selling* Traveller, just licensing it like he
did with IG/SP.

>BTRC comes to mind as a good choice.

Quality-wise, yes, but BTRC is essentually *just* Greg Porter.  I suspect
BTRC would be under-capitalized to handle the purchase, development and
marketing for another line.  Not the way *we\'d* like anyway.

If you want my out-of-the-loop opinion, it\'ll be none of the above...and
nobody that anybody here guessed.  No, I don\'t know, I just think it\'ll be
from somewhere in left field.

Did anybody but me notice the new TRAVELLER novel in your local bookstores? 
Did Marc announce it was coming? If he did, I missed it.

No, you have to pay circa 2000 credits per 14 cubic meters of widgets to go
jump-3. Now, if there are 100 widgets per m3, thats 1400 widgets. Call it
1.5 credits per widget.

Therefore, if your 10 liter widget costs, say, 50 credits, and by exporting
from one world to four you can double the size of the factory and get a 10%
price discount, then specialisation and exchange is well worthwhile.

You are doing point-to-point shipping, so you should get a 10 day
turnaround (no week in port twiddling thumbs while the purser and captain
look for a cargo). Call it 30 days, 35 days tops to go 9 parsecs with a
jump-3 ship.

Given the Traveller technologies and a presumed 3% interest rate, shipping
costs just arent that high relative to the costs of goods you can ship.

Scott, what do you define as \'really valuable\' ... Cr 10 000 per m3 ?

Fair enough. Personally, I believe that the Long Night had an exogenous
cause - a sudden increase in misjump probabilities. Once misjumping goes up
to about 5% per jump, insurance and freight costs start to become
prohibitive, which leads to the collapse of the financial and trading
sectors, which pull the rest of the economy down with them.

Once misjump chances went down to historically normal levels, all the
various societies that still had starfaring capability started to expand
again.

You know, I\'ve never run across a *perfect* game, and I never expect to.

Most of us, me included, have taken our shots at the T4 system over the
last 18 months, but I think there is much about the game that worked,
worked very well.  Did outsiders think our constant complaints and changes
meant the system was bad?  They shouldn\'t have, it meant we were doing what
Traveller players and GM\'s always do..we were tinkering.

Personally, I liked the concept behind the task system very much.  If I
hadn\'t liked it so much, I wouldn\'t have bothered everybody so much with
all my posts about it\'s shortcomings and suggestions for improving it. I
don\'t think Ken Bearden would have argued so strongly for his KB 2.0 fix if
he didn\'t think the underlying concept was good, either.  Marc\'s T4.1
drafts continue with this concept, improving it..not to my satisfaction,
but then *whatever* is to my satisfaction.  ;->

The CharGen system was a nice one.  More streamlined than CT/MT, but it got
more skills onto our character\'s sheets, and it let you work random,
semi-random, or by choice.  Yes, I complained.  Yes, I wanted improvements. 
Yes, Marc\'s T4.1 drafts look like improvements, and yes, if it get\'s
published I\'ll still want to tweak it.

The personal combat system took a lot of heat, but it also worked..no
matter what some vocal critics on certain newsgroups might have said. ;->
Reducing Characteristics through injury *is* the Traveller way, and
combined with the task system made sense.  Personally, I think it could
have been more deadly, but that was easy enough to arrange, and several of
us applied "fixes" involving hit locations and secondary tracks for damage. 


If CSC\'s VDS didn\'t have that funky (and incompatible) log armor it would
have been a killer vehicle design system.  Shoot!  It\'s a killer system
anyway. Kudos to Greg Porter!

FFS2 suffers only from bad layout, a stupid typographic mistake, and the
lack of time and space.  Ok, I would have done some things differently, but
even to my heretic eye FFS is an excellent book and system for designing
everything from hand weapons up to starships.  Mucho kudos to Dave Golden
and Guy Garret!

I\'m not going to expand on Pocket Empires, Psionics Institutes, Naval
Architects Manual, Imperial Squadrons, Emperor\'s Arsenal, but each of them
has value, in some cases a *lot* of value.  Ok, there were some *less*
valuable books (stinkers ;-), but what line doesn\'t have them? Notice I
didn\'t mention the M0 setting, like others that have commented recently it
didn\'t excite me, but it wasn\'t a dog either.  OTOH, the disappearance of
Starships and First Survey will be unlamented by most of us.

All in all, the T4 line was a strong first edition effort.  All it needed
was time.  Time to develop.  Time for second editions (T4.1, foex) to be
written.  And time to have done it right the first time.

So, in answer to the question, yes there\'s a lot of T4 worth picking up.
Most of it.

No, I never heard anything about it at all, in fact, it\'s a complete
surprise.  How new is it?  A week?  Several weeks?  A month?  Strange,
nobody\'s mentioned it at _all_.

Strange timing though.  Paramount owned Pocket Books will be distributing
Last Unicorn\'s Star Trek RPG late this summer.

It had a 1998 date on it, and it wasn\'t on the shelf last week, so I\'m
guessing *very* new. I didn\'t look real closely at Marc\'s "How to play
Traveller" chapter in the back, but from the skim it looked more like a
synopsis of T4.1 than T4. There was also an add for some Traveller books on
last page.  I\'ll have to go back tomorrow and buy it.

Walden Books, BTW.

>Strange timing though.  Paramount owned Pocket Books will be distributing

I know. From what I\'ve read the new ST-RPG is going to be sold in
bookstores more like a paperback novel than a traditional RPG. It\'ll be
"episode" based, and aimed at the ST, but non-RPG market.

I have also designed a handheld meson gun.  I posted it to the list
about 1 year ago & I now do so again

WARNING Severe Munchkinism Follows Read At Your Own Risk !

"This is the Delgado .44 Meson, the most powerfull handheld meson gun in
the Imperium.  You are probably saying to yourself are his homopolar
generators fully charged.  Do you feel lucky, punk, well do you ?"
  
The true Traveller munchkin (in Millieu 1100) will design a hand held
Meson weapon so as not to insure that their oponents do not try & take
advantage of that pesky thing called armor.  This may involve some
creative interpretation of the chapter on Meson Guns. I should point out
in my own defence that _NO_ minimum values are given in the meson gun
design table so it may be a legitimate design. (FFS 1 pg 116-120)

Using Fire Fusion & Steel 1 it is very easy to design a hand held Meson
gun FGMP style weapon for Battledress troups at TL 15.  The overall
dammage will be low but since it ignores armor it can be deadly.  It is 
also possible to generate a similar (but less effective) weapon at TL\'s
as low as 11.  Such a weapon will have a low rate of fire however.  This
design example quotes fairly heavily from the FF&S 1 design sequences,
which are copyright Marc Miller. 

If a gravtank bothers you you can just vaporize the driver or the
controls & the tank will probably crash.   For _true_ munchkinism you
need a psionic firer because if the firer is psionic you can pass off a
target location aquired with telepathy or clairvoyance & may be able to
hit the brain directly.

A fairly deadly weapon can be designed with approximately the following
parameters: 

TL 15 MGMP (Meson Gun Man Portable)

Step 1:  Involves chosing a Spinal, parallel, or Bay mount.  We will
ignore this step since our gun will be handheld.  We will select a
tunnel length at this ponit however.  We will pick 0.3 m.

Step 2:  Discharge Energy (DE)  0.04 megajoule

Step 3: Meson Tunnel Charecteristics

TL 14 Tunnel Charecteristics 
Length Multiplier       1.2
Volume Multiplier       0.01
Mass Multiplier         0.6

3a: Effective Tunnel Length (0.3 m * 1.2) = 0.36 m

3b: Tunnel Volume (cubic meters)= actual length (m) * discharge energy
(megajoules) * volume multiplier
0.3 * 0.04 * 0.01 = 0.00012 cubic meter (120 cc\'s)

3c: Tunnel Cross-Sectional Area
Cross-sectional area in square meteres is equal to the tunnel volume
divided by the actual tunnel length.
0.00048/0.3 = 0.0004 square meter (4 square centimeters) This  means our
meson gun has a gun is approximate diamter of 1.128 (about .44 caliber)

3d: Tunnel Mass
Tunnel Mass (tonnes) = tunnel volume (cubic meters) * mass multiplier
0.00012 * 0.6 = 0.00007 tonnes (0.07 kg) 

3e: Tunnel Price (MCr)
tunnel volume (cubic meters) * 0.1 at all Tl\'s
0.00012 * 0.1 = 0.000012 MegaCredits (12 credits)

4: Performance
Effective range in km = effective tunnel length x 1000
0.36 * 1000 = 360 km  

5: Define Short Range
 This is where you select a beam pointer for your meson gun. The rules
state that all meson guns require a beam pointer.  if you wish to design
an effective hand held meson gun below Tl 15 you will probably need to
_ignore_ this rule because the beam pointer will be so heavy as to make
the gun impractical. (Arguably no small arm should require a beam
pointer since it will be manually fired).  

We will select the lightest possible beam pointer the 0.3km beam
pointer.  At TL 15 this beam pointer will have the following stats:
Volume 0.01 cubic meter 
Mass 0.01 ton (10 kg)
Price (MCr) = volume * 0.1
0.01 * 0.1 = 0.001 MCr  (1000 credits)

If the weapon will be used by battle dress troups you may wish to use a
3 km beam pointer which will have twice the mass, volume, & cost.  If
this is a very high tech experimental secret weapon you may wish to use
a TL 17 beam pointer instead which will give  a 3km short range for the
same mass, volume and cost as our 0.3 km TL 15 beam pointer.

6: Combat Ratings

6a: Combat Range Bands

Short Range:    0.3 km / 300 meters
Medium Range:   0.6 km / 600 meters
Long Range:     1.2 km / 1200 meters
Extreme Range:  2.4 km / 2400 meters

(The maximum range at which a Meson gun will do dammage = 8,500 km *
effective tunnel length or 3,060 km for this design - since it will be
incapable of hitting anything at ranges greater than 2.4 km we will
ignore this range)

6b: Dammage Value
 
DV = 5 * I^0.5          I is the weapons Intensity

I = DE / (R/EL)^2       R is range in 1000\'s of
km                         round (R/EL)^2 to the nearest 0.5 with a
minimum of 1

0.1 / (0.0003/0.36)^2 =
0.1 / (0.000000694 which rounds up to 1)=
0.1 / 1 = 0.1 = I
DV = 5 * (0.04)^0.5 = 1

Our Meson gun does 1d6 of dammage _Ignoring Armor_

7: Power Requirements

7a: Input Energy        Meson guns have a 20% energy efficiency
InputEnergy (IE) = Discharge Energy / 0.2
0.04 / 0.2 = 0.32

7b: Homopolar Generator (It is tempting to relate this to the gays in
the Imperium thread) A meson gun requires a homopolar generator (HPG) to
store the energy required for each shot until that energy is ready to be
deployed as a single pulse.  Calculate this figure by muliplying the IE
by the value on the HPG table
 
Volume = 0.32 * 0.035 = 0.0112 cubic meter (11.2 cubic liters)
mass = vol * 2 (tons)
0.112 * 2 = 0.0224 tons (22.4 kg)
Price (MCr) = vol * 0.1 * 1.1 (modified for Explosive Power Generation)
0.112 * 0.01 * 1.1 = 0.001232 MCr (1,232 Cr)

7c: Rate of Fire        We will select the highest possible rate of fire
which is 100 shots per 30 minute space combat turn.  This translates to
a ground combat ROF of 1/4 (1 shot every 4 combat turns)

7d: Power Input
ROF * IE = Megajoules consumed per 5 second turn.  Divide this number by
5 to find the MW of power that must be allocated to operate the weapon.
0.25 * 0.32 / 5 = 0.016 MW of power required. We will generate the
required power with Explosive Power Generators 

TL 14 Pulse Fusion Cartridge (PFC) 0.016 MJ

Vol = output * 0.0002
0.0002 * 0.016 = 0.0000032 cubic meters (3.2 cubic centimeters)
Cost (MCr) = output * 0.000008
0.016 * 0.000008 = 0.000000128 MCr (0.128 credits)
Mass Vol * 4
0.0000032 * 4 = 0.0000128 tons (0.0128 kg)(12.8 grams)
Cartridge Dimensions:
Radius 5.54mm
Diameter 11.08mm
Length 33.24mm

8 Gun Crew:     0.0000012 crew (rounds up to 1) required
We are going to skip the gunners (normal) workstation required by the
rules at this point.  Instead we are going to finish the design of this
meson gun using the rules for designing High Energy Weapons.

This is the _first & only_ way this design breaks the rules.

9 Meson Gun Carriage, Mount, Etc:

We will not give this gun a carriage.  The rules for High Energy Weapons
state that man portable weapons do not require a cradle.  The mass &
price of a stock are subsumed in the basic cost of a firing unit. 

Recoil System Weight
0.04* 2 = 0.08 kg

Feed System 
1  50 round box magazine w/ auto loader
Empty Mass 0.4147 kg
Cost 5 Cr
Loaded Mass 1.0547 kg

Price (Credits)

Firing Unit             2000
Support Hardware        2000
Inertial Compensator    1000
 (The actual recoil of this weapon (1) does not require it to have an
inertial compensator. I am giving it one anyway to represent my
perception of the stability a meson gun firing solution requires)
Meson Tunnel            12
Beam Pointer            1000
HPG                     1232
50 Cartridges           7      (0.128 * 50 = 6.4 Cr)
Magazine                5
Gun Shield              1

Total  Loaded Cost Cr 7,257     Total Loaded Mass 33.60 kg
 
This design becomes much lighter at TL 16 & higher.  I suspect it might
be designable as a handgun by TL 20 or so. I realize that this wepon is
somewhat heavy for a man portable weapon,
but it would make a good squad level suport weapon.

In the campaign I played in where this weapon was introduced it was
described as TL 16 and given a cost (as an experimental secret weapon)
of about MCr 50 each.  It would probably be less imbalancing to a
campaign at this cost. 

Comment are welcommed.

Automation is a great and glorious thing, provided you have a Zho programmer
who can predict every anomaly, even those not yet encountered.  The
universe, even that one *I* created, is so vast there is no way to account
for all eventualities.  That\'s where experienced humans, et al, make the
difference, in the "best guess scenario".

IRL, we here at NASA\'s Network Management center have some of the best tech
(and analysts) available.  But a simple thought process in a human can be so
convoluted that it seems that even an advanced AI could not reach the same
conclusion.  For instance,  we were having a bandwidth congestion problem at
one site.  It seems a virtual trunk was connecting on a two hop path and
ignoring a one hop path.  A no brainer for a human.  But the controlling
software was only looking at the bandwidth metric and the two hopper was a 4
Mbps vs. the 2 Mbps one hopper.  All right, I know that this is at our tech
level, but expound the tech level and you compound the risks.  Well, a quick
addition on the fly of a static route fixed the issue, but it was an "ole
Mark 1" human brain that solved the problem that the automaton couldn\'t or
more importantly, didn\'t even see.  When the programmer is omnipotent and
can foresee EVERY POSSIBLE SCENARIO, I\'ll trust me and mine to a wholly
automated system.  Until then, gimme a good old fallible human.

Imperial Squadrons is essentially a Do-it-yourself version of GDW\'s Fifth
Frontier War boardgame, with roleplaying tie-ins.  If you liked the
boardgame and want to see more, Imperial Squadrons is a good deal.

On the positive side, the rules allow you to create squadrons and armies
for your pocket empires and fight out entire wars at one week per turn.
This alone is worth the price to me, and the reason I bought the book.
There are tables for framing a wartime Naval campaign, that rotate your
players\' squadron from front line duty to rest and refit to deep
penetration raids and so on.

On the negative side, the interface with Pocket Empires is somewhat shaky -
you have to convert Resource Units to MCr to figure up your budgets and
costs, and some of the conceptual linkage is hard to grasp (eg, why is a
low Culture score a detriment to squadron capabilities, when it has a
positive effect on Gross World Product?).  I\'m also not sure I agree with
the duty descriptions is the chapters on life in the Navy, and so probably
won\'t use them.

Was that Twilight 2000 1st or 2d ed?  If it was 2d ed, you already have a
Traveller conversion:  Tw2000 and TNE use the same system, then you can use
Survival Margin to reverse engineer to MT or CT.  At the risk of inciting a
new flame war, this is why I\'ve said before TNE is a useful bridge system
between GURPS and Traveller, even if you don\'t like it as a system to play
or never intend to use the background.

Agreed.  This also harks back to the TNE careers mechanic:  instead of
tables of random skills, each \'career\' is a template for four years of
experience in a given field.  The players choose a set number of skills
from lists associated with the career, while also accumulating advantages
(ship\'s DMs, contacts, initiative bonuses) of the appropriate types.  I
would love to see this mechanic translated to GURPS - it seems a good
middle ground between classic Traveller services and GURPS character
templates (as I understand them).

Errr... Because the Empire is stupid? (c.v. "Star Wars")

gearhead design sequence covering everything in a "pseudo-realistic"
fashion, with a fully-integrated scaled down High Guard-style
sequence for simpler work, a combat system that\'s fast, fun, and
reasonably notes the differences between concussive, blast, and
penetrating damages, scales up from slingshots to planetwreckers, a
task system that handles the balance between skill and
characteristics effectively, a tight, solid background that is
self-consistent, a space combat system that scales all the way from
Brilliant Lances-type combat on one end to High Guard on the other,
and a tall, single, blonde to play with ... whooops, that\'s got
nothing to do with Traveller <G>.

	Although the *rights* to Traveller stay with FFE, the T4 *materials*
still belong to IG. It\'s up to them to respond to you. When GDW
folded, Marc, as part of GDW, got the chance to load up on leftover
products. However, Marc never was part of IG--they simply licensed
Traveller from him.

	And for what it\'s worth, Marc has responded fairly well to requests
for GDW material. I\'ve gotten almost everything I still need. It may
be that he\'s just a wee bit busy, trying to sort out the failure of
IG, recovering all the rights he licensed, writing T4.1, and
negotiating for a new publisher.

For starters, my entire power supply is a few grams of gunpowder.  No need
for heavy batteries and the like.  A .25 cal pistol, weigh less than a
pound, can kill.

Lasers have the disadvantage that fog, smoke, rain, and even mildly
reflective surfaces disrupt and deflect the beam.  Most beams, will be
traceable to the firer\'s position, either by the beam itself, or flashes as
the beam destroys stray dust particles in the atmosphere.

Plasma/fusion weapons are great, except that hey tend to attract attention,
which is bad.  When I first joined the Army, I was a Dragon anti-tank
missile gunner.  Imagine what it\'s like to have an entire platoon of M-60A3
tanks trying to kill you.  That\'s life for a plasma equipped soldier.

Also, I wouldn\'t want to be holding a p/f gun went it went off.  Those
suckers will get hot!  The flash might even blind/dazzle the user.
Protective lenses would be the minimum.

For TL12/13, this is how I see the infantry being armed.

Light infantry/recon: Combat environment suit with stealth features, gauss
rifle w/4 spare clips.  possibly grav belt.   

Regular lift infantry: Combat envirosuit with additional armor over the
torso as part of a tactical vest. 7mm Advanced Combat Rifle with 6 spare
clips and several RAM grenades.  Support provided by a 9mm Advanced Squad
Automatic Weapon or a grenade launcher.  Extra ammo for the ASAW or GL
spread among the fire team.

Heavy infantry:  Combat armor, gauss rifle w/6 spare clips, RAM grenades.
Support weapon plasma gun or rocket launcher.

Augmented infantry: Battle dress.  Each trooper carries a support-level
weapon, either a gauss MG or plasma weapon.

Don\'t forget that as the TL rises so does quality.  The only difference
between a Glock and a M-1911 .45 is what they are made of and the
technology used to manufacture them.

I think that the concepts behind T4 were great, it just fell apart in the
execution.  Poor editing and proofreading, no one checking canon, and
horrible layout all drove people away.

Or maybe (my theory) it had one of the data crystals Dulinor had disseminated before the
deed aboard, which showed what he intended to do. Would explain some bits in Strephon´s
speech.
In that case, my respect for Strephon rises even further, in that he still honors
Dulinor as a wise, but rash, man capable of a lot of good. (unless he fucked up, which
he cannae do now!)

Sorry to correct you there, but there´s  a bit more to corporate takeovers than that:
When BWM completes thedeal and takes over Rolls Royce, where will you order the new
Rolls? Not at BMW, although their dealers might now also feature RR´s. But RR will
remain a seperate company, only that it is OWNED by BMW.
The same deal exists with TSR. They are still a seperate company, and although WOTC owns
them, they still do business as TSR. The rights still belong to TSR, who in turn belongs
to WOT. But if you want the Gamma Worlds CD, write to those who hold the rights
directly, and that´s still TSR.

Please tell us about is... 

What´s it about, contentwise.
How does it look (size, cover painting)
Who published it.
What does it cost.
etc.
Inquiring minds from Europe need to know before ordering at Amazon (anyone know a
cheaper online bookstore, postagewise?)

 Errr... Because the Empire is stupid? (c.v. "Star Wars")

ok, you want to know why they didnt go "over" or "under" to bypass the Vulcan
Defense Ring. the answer is simple.  you do not leave a force "behind" you.
Remeber von Kluck\'s drive to Paris in 1914...  the Germans had won the war,
but von Kluck felt he had to beat the French army "in the feild" and veered
off to engage the retreating army and this action caused the Great War to turn
into a severe blood bath

tactical and strategic doctrone can be eiher your best freind or your greatest
enemy...   and in the Imps case, it was both.

we terrrans have shown how fantical we can be in defense of hte things we
love...  \'divine wind\' comes to mind while thinking of it right now... i know
i can see a fighter slaming into the bridge of an Imp capitalship (speaking of
star wars remeber the battle of endor and darth vader\'s flag ship?)

tactically and startegiclly comeing in on the horizonal plane equal to the
planets allows you to carry out your mission much easier, and ensures that you
will not miss or over shoot your target world(s)...  you might be in a 4d
enviroment, but you must remeber that Humans are better at fighting in a 3d
enviroment and keep in mind those same humans have the belief that you must
defeat the enemy in the field to win the war...  if not you get the "Stabbed
in the Back" myths that have been used by Hitler and Hussian...  

so the Imps felt that since they had the Terrans on the ropes the entire time
of the Rim War..  lets blast their feeble line...  just like von Kluck felt he
had the French on the ropes, but as we all know what that lead too..

I tend to buy Traveller books for content above all.  Artwork is secondary.
 
I tend to buy new RPGs based on reviews (in magazines or by friends) and I prefer good 
artwork that gives a suitable flavour to the game.
 
Assuming that I am representative (a brave assumption, but I\'ve got to start somewhere:-), I 
see existing Traveller players as buying mostly on contents and new players buying based on 
recommendations and artwork that "sets the scene" for them.
 
I would bet that the large majority of sales go to existing players (i.e. of versions prior 
to T4), but that these are not enough to ensure the long term profitability of a Traveller 
publisher.
 
If I look at Scott\'s suggestions for "New Traveller" in the light of my supposition:
 
> Rules:
> 
> 1.  Basic rulebook, with enough to start playing immediately.
> 2.  Gearhead book, a la FF&S2
> 3.  Starship, vehicle, and equipment book
 
Many T4 buyers will complain that they have to buy the same stuff that they
bought only a few months ago, just for the sake of a few changes.  Some will
welcome the changes with open arms and some will complain if there are
omissions (i.e. no FFS3 is released), as they "need" information from an
out-of-print book.
 
With sales restricted to (mostly) new players, I think that rules will 
be difficult to make a profit on.
 
> Sources:
> 
> 1.  Local campaign book
> 2.  A service book, like "Navy life" or "Merchanting for fun"
> 3.  Support materials - like Traders and Gunboats
 
This sort of thing will sell well to the old hands, but will not attract new
players unless there is a (visually interesting) rule book for them buy.
 
Some sources will be seen as "gearhead" (Pocket Empires), or of low role-playing value 
(Imperial Squadrons), and will sell to a smaller audience.  These two happen to be my 
favourites from T4, but I have seen numerous criticism of them on the 
TML.
 
<---- a break to catch my thoughts ---->
 
So, where does this leave Marc, potential publishers of "New Traveller" 
and Traveller fans?
 
The failure of IG strongly indicates that T4 did not sell well enough to be self-sustaining. 
This must surely discourage any publisher hoping to make money (all of them!).  There may 
have been product-quality related reasons for IG\'s demise, but any new publisher would need 
to be very sure that quality was the main (only?) reason for failure.
 
If the fan base is not big enough for a re-launch, then we may as well consign ourselves to 
a few wilderness years, as in the past with the gaps between versions of Traveller.  This 
gives time for most places to run out of stock and to lets the hunger gnaw at the hearts of 
Traveller fans (along with anger, biterness and frustration).  This, while my view of the 
"most likely scenario", is not a very pleasant prospect.  So, let us look at how less likely 
scenarios might be made to work.
 
Quality and consistency
=======================
T4: Weapons, vehicles and starships from various supplements are often inconsistent with 
(later) published design sequences.  Simple design sequences are inconsistent with detailed 
design sequences.
 
New Traveller: design system developed first and used "in house" by authors to ensure 
consistency in all paper publications.  The few gearhead fans who want the design system 
will be able to get it electronically from sites such as Hyperbooks.com.  If New Traveller 
grows, the design rules may be published in paper form.
 
Problems: with few sales of FFS:NT, who pays for the development of the design system?  Will 
spreadsheets (like the 3G^3 spreadsheet from Greg porter) be part of the design sequence, 
and who will write these spreadsheets?  If they are written by fans will they ever be seen 
as "official"?
 
Market Appeal
=============
T4: few people found the cover art "stood out" on the crowded RPG shelves.  The game sold 
only through specialist games shops.
 
New Traveller: both a role-playing game and a computer game.  A game like MegaTraveller 2 
with better graphics and X-Com-style isometric persepective for characters on a planet or 
ship is unlikely to be a block-buster, but could accurately reflect the NT universe and 
attract new players.  A Pocket Empires / Imperial Squadron game would have similarities to 
other resource games like Civilisation, Wing Commander Armarda and numerous SSI titles.
 
Problems: Making sure the game "fits" the Traveller universe.  Finding a company who wants 
to write the game, in this era of "3-CDs and $1 million is minimum" for the graphics-rich 
action games that dominate the market.  Most (all) of the games will be PC-only (probaly 
Win95-only), leaving those faithful Traveller fans with Macs to carry 
on with infini-V and 
Metator (no disparagement of these fine programs is intended).
 
 
<---- a break to catch my thoughts ---->
 
Thinking about the X-com series (UFO, Terror from the Deep and Apocalypse) some more makes 
me think that this style of game could be ideal for a Traveller computer game.  I\'ll call it 
"Traveller:Trader" (T:T) for the moment.
 
The resource-side of things is reflected in the trading on each world, and buying equipment 
where it is avaliable (much like in MT 2).
 
The "action" side is provided be isometric views of numerous sites - including ships.  Your 
crew (equivalent to x-com agents) can be exploring derelict ships that have been subjected 
to attack by the "great threat", exploring houses/mines/factories where agents of the "great 
threat" may be lurking, breaking into Chamax-filled power stations to recharge your 
laser packs, talking to people (as in the Ultima series of games) defending their ship from 
hi-jack or boarding action by the "great threat" and so on.
 
The on-going use in role-playing is via the expansion packs:
(1) the scenario editor - design your own maps, or use existing ones, 
and populate them with 
baddies, clues, people to talk to (rumours), macguffins, or whatever. 
(2) the sector mapper - lets you use relatively simple sector map descriptions (in ASCII 
format, like the ones we have at the moment in Galactic), so the players can adventure where 
they want, print out sub-sector maps for hand-outs.  The program will convert the sectors 
into data files suitable for use in T:T
(3) the ship designer so that the players can use a different (pre-designed) ship or design 
their own (NAM meets QSDS), print out floor plans and so on.
 
If you really want to get clever, you can set up a "plot" to link the various sites by using 
REFORM (the adventure scripting system that was used by most of the Infocom games and is now 
available as a public domain compiler).  If the initial game uses REFORM (or a suitably 
modified version thereof) to adjudicate the "behind the graphics" plotline, then it will be 
possible for entire campaigns to be set up.  Few people will have the desire and knowledge 
to do this, but it happened for DOOM, so could happen for Traveller.
 
When this thing really takes off, we can have Traveller on-line, Traveller:Mercenary 
(command and conquer in a Traveller universe), Traveller:High Guard (the Imperial 
Squadrons/Pocket Empires game), Traveller:Merchant Prince (trade in a sector wracked by a 
Tukera/Oberlindes trade war), Traveller:Merchant Prince 2 (a remake of Leviathan, CT 
advendure 4), Horde (a scenario pack for T:M or T:T, "role play it in T:T or take on the 
role of the army in T:M).

Assuming they went in a semicircular arc, that\'s an additional 50% or so, as
opposed to a straight line (through an asteroid belt!?).  Comparing that to the
potential destruction of ships, I\'d say its worthwhile.

I think this is a bad analogy.  Its closer to indirect fire over the enemy lines
into the heart of the enemy.  They made good use of this as "Time on target" where
various artillery forces would fire timed so that all rounds impact as the same
time.  Very demoralizing to the Germans.

It does no such thing.  You can screw up your course REAL bad even on the plane of
the ecliptic.  Coming in perpendicular limits the effects of planetary bodies on
your course.  It also puts you closer to your goal since they don\'t yank you out
of jump space.

You mean 3d and 2d don\'t you? What you can do is lob forces over the line at the
target planet.  Then your main forces converge through the asteroid belt.  Now the
asteroid forces are confronted on two sides.  They can defend the planet by going
after the advance force, but then they turn their back on the main body.  If they
don\'t go after the advance force, they have their supply lines cut.

Maybe its just me, but _I_ would take this rule as a sign that the designers
didn\'t _intend_ for people to be able to design hand-held meson guns below TL
15...

Then again, rules always seem to get in the way of some peoples\' fun.

I\'m afraid I would have to differ with you on MaCarthur\'s military standing.
He lost fewer people (all services, all countries) in the Pacific campaign
than was lost at D-Day alone in Europe.  Sounds pretty smart to me.  He also
sorted out a little skirmish in a country called Korea that has had the
heads of quite a number of Generals world wide nodding in approval and with
some small amount of awe.  Maybe you\'ve heard of the Pusan landings.  As a
soldier I believe I would have rather served under Mac than Patton and (God
forgive me) Monty.  I honestly can\'t think of one WWI general I would have
liked to serve under, they all used some type of "Human Wave" tactics.  Just
the thought of this scares me to death.

I agree with this statement for both men wholeheartedly.

Pretty much it, although there will be hardbacks released for all the
series (ST:TNG comes first, followed by the other series books) and each
individual "major" race will be supported with a box set.

Does Pocket Books put out much in the way of other RPGs books and book

It has a version of the old FFW rules linked to the Pocket Empires rules
(but the scenarios given are flawed and need a change to the allow SDBs to
be exchanged for other squadrons), rules for playing in the Navy, notes on
legal stuff, some ship designs and a big scenario and some npcs. I would
say it is worthwhile. There is also a version of Trillion Credit Squadron,
but this is a bit useless without a combat system - however, T4.1 will
probably provide that and be backwardly usable with T4.

I bought it...

I think alot of this boils down to time and tech level.  For example, we\'ve
made great leaps in technology in only 40 or 50 years.  Now, there\'s only
been 40 or 50 years to get a handle on all this stuff, and not alot of time
for things to stabilize.  On the other hand, when you get into the
Traveller universe, technological advancement has stagnated.   Whoops, I
meant to say stabilized.  Either way, you\'ve got thousands of years to work
the bugs out.  As far as software and low level automation goes, I don\'t
think that there\'ll be many programs out there that are the product of one
programmer.  They will grow with time and be worked on by many programmers,
be run through millions of detailed tests and simulations...

First off, I think the system that you explain is quite a bit away from an
"advanced AI".  Secondly, how long has this software you are talking about
been in use?  A year, five years, ten years, 20? 30? 40? 50+?  Now, just
imagine that same software 2,000 years in the future, or 4,000 years in the
future.  Or a Vilani equivilant that has been in use for even longer...

I\'ve had nothing but good success with my ongoing GURPS Traveller
campaign.  Could it be something to do with somethings else in
how it was set up rather than mechanics?  (sometimes choices
can be harder in a generic system because it provides a lot
fewer restrictions on what you can do, though buy GURPS Traveller
when it comes out, written as it is by a Traveller "founder"
should eliminate this problem).

I\'ve meant to ask this for years...just what exactly *is* a beam pointer? I
know what it does, and that is the "integral fire control capabilities...",
but just exactly what is it?   A fire-control computer?  A range finder? A
sight? 

Is the beam pointer, meant to be the in-play sensor mechianism that does
the actual "target lock" that allows a weapon to hit something?

Um, Loren...

"All heavy (non-small arms) lasers, particle accelerators, and meson guns
require beam pointers...", p89 FFS.

My interpretation of that sentence is that small arm (ie, hand held) laser,
PAW, and Meson gun\'s do NOT require a beam pointer.  OTOH, I don\'t know if
I like the idea of paw or meson pistols.

>Then again, rules always seem to get in the way of some peoples\' fun. 

Yeah, that\'s true too. ;->

Hmmmm,  the first thing that comes to my mind is that most often items are
bought through distributors and they would be the ones getting items from
the jump-9 to their warehouses.  In the case of a large distributor, s/he
would have warehouses on a number of planets and they would stock items that
the dBase tells them are being sold in a say jump-2 environment.  There just
aren\'t very many retailers that buy direct from the "Original Equipment
Manufacturers" (OEM) even today.  Now that we have the distributors in the
loop we have to back up one minor step and take a look at our dBase again.
Almost all retailers use these to forecast sales and "automatically" place
their orders.  Of course it is a hell of lot more involved than this but for
simplicity sake I think you get my point.  If you didn\'t, then generally you
would not be out of stock of items for more than a couple of days if your
software is working properly.  It would take a catastrophic failure to
incapacitate trading systems that are at a TL9+ at a number of locations at
the same time to take down the whole system.  I would think that a single
link would be replaced almost immediately.

Yes, a beam pointer is essentially a laser rangefinder...remember, Meson
guns need the exact distance to target to time the meson decay just right.

Now, for things like deep meson sites, the fire solution is handed off
from the surface or orbital sensor sites. A hand held Meson gun will
definitely need a beam pointer, but you could probably use the rules for
small-arms electronics rangefinders to create one.

Kentucky windage just won\'t work with a weapons system like this.

Heaven forbid, we start another flame war over the relative merits of TNE!
Personally, I liked the GDW house system, yes I tweaked it like everything
else, but I liked it...sort of reminded me of GURPS to tell you the truth.
I did not like the background, but I\'ve never berated those that did,
because I\'m always going to use my own background anyway.

Loren, do you hear that?  I\'m with Christopher here, templates similar to
the TNE careers would/could/(I\'d say)should go into GURPS Traveller.
Please, include, at least, the most common careers, and give some direction
for how to build others. 

I\'d argue for the following sort of Template (at minimum):
 1. A Career package with minimum requirements for Stats/Ads/Disads/Skills.
 2. A list of optional Stats/Ads/Disads/Skills that fit into that career.
 3. A requirement that X points be spent in the optional list.

I\'d *rather* have something almost exactly like TNE\'s, but I\'m a stumped by
how to do it with GURPS.

Now, *I\'m*, personally, going to want some randomness in chargen, but
Marc\'s T4.1 draft (and all the other versions) can give me that. ;->

	its a bit wimpy. The Rurevayn shock troops have a "man portable"
	light meson gun, for use by thruster pack meteor paratroopers.
	The design is TL:13, the tunnel is 360cm, and most of the mass is
	the HPG for 36Mj bursts, producing 30 points of vehicle damage.
	Its a platoon support weapon, and normally crewed by two people.
	It has its own fuel cell that also powers an antigraph lifter to
	move it more quickly and to allow orbital entry of the floating
	disk and the troopers.  The term "man portable" is of course
	missleading, as this gun is designed to transport up to six
	battle troopers and four 53cm KKMs from orbit to ground.  As it
	can be controled remote from the battle dress, its even posible
	to wait in orbit, and let the disk do its nasty work.

	The complete disk and the battle dresses are of course using
	best stealth TL:13 has to offer. The production started in 1157
	at Imaparlu. As a shock weapon system its not infected, but
	relies on human agression for control. The meteor paratroopers
	are seldom used, as this tactic can only work with supprise
	conditions.

The ST series is the first I\'ve heard of *any* major book publisher doing.
IIRC the deal caused a stir when it was announced, because it was
considered something of a breakthrough for the industry.

Thanks for putting my thoughts into a more concise form.

If Marc can recover the rights to the various T4 books (or whoever he
licences can), the inclusion of the T4.1 differences, a revised layout, and
a good editing and proofreading job, and they would have the core of
Traveller ready to hit the market. I don\'t know how the original authors
would feel about it, and I don\'t know if a new licence could get the rights
to the IG produced work, but heaven help us if they can\'t.  We\'d be back to
ground zero building up the books needed in the line.

Could be, like I said, I just can\'t put my finger on why.

I *like* semi-random chargen, I don\'t like giving characters benefits  for
taking Disadvantages, and taken together you can see I don\'t believe in
"balanced characters", not as balanced as GURPS does it anyway. I guess
this makes it hard to get started.  What I\'ve never tried is to generate
the characters in some version of Traveller and then convert them that
would probably help.

Synopsis:
The first novel based on the top-selling sf role-playing game. Navis Redling is
resuming his career as an independent shipper and courier after a year in
detox.
Except, it really isn\'t Navis Redling, but rather a fugitive who has bought
Redling\'s identity--including plastic surgery, implanted memories, and
Redling\'s ship. When
this mysterious impostor runs into Redling\'s old enemies, he finds out why this
troublesome identity was available in the first place. He\'s in for far more
than a simple
trip through Redling\'s old stomping grounds.

=== FAQ Begins Here ===

General Information

What is a FAQ?

FAQ is short for "Frequently Asked Questions". Thus, a FAQ is a
list of questions that are often asked about a particular
subject, along with answers to those questions, or information
leading to the answers.

What is the purpose of this FAQ?

The Traveller FAQ has been created in order to provide a single
source of answers for questions regarding the Traveller product
lines from <Imperium Games and> licensed companies. This
includes, to the best of our ability, product release schedules,
general information about the companies that produce Traveller,
and rules clarifications - plus anything else we feel is useful,
or which our readers request often enough.

How accurate is this FAQ?

It\'s as accurate as we can make it, bearing in mind that human
beings are involved at every step of the process. Sometimes there
are miscommunications or misunderstandings that result in
inaccurate information here. Other times, information in this FAQ
may change (product release dates, for example) before we have a
chance to get the information and update this FAQ. We will make
an effort to keep the information in this FAQ as up-to-date as
possible, but mistakes do happen. We hope you\'ll understand this,
and be forgiving of our fully-volunteer staff.

Where can I find the latest copy of this FAQ?

Right here, we hope. The staff of Freelance Traveller fully
intends to try to keep this FAQ as up-to-date as possible.

Who or what <is>{was} Imperium Games?

Imperium Games, Inc., <is>{was} the primary licensee for
Traveller {from 1996 to 1998}.  They publish{ed}, market{ed}, and
distribute{d} the main products of the Traveller product line.
The company is owned by Courtney Solomon and is located in
Beverly Hills, California, USA.  Imperium Games contract<s>{ed}
with various designers (for example, the CORE group, Tim Brown,
and Greg Porter) who actually wr<i>{o}te the Traveller material.

Who is Marc Miller?

Marc Miller is the man who originally invented the Traveller game
system, over 20 years ago. He also holds the trademark on the
Traveller name, and all rights to the Traveller material
published by Game Designers\' Workshop (the company which
published Traveller from 1977 through February of 1996). Marc\'s
company is Far Future Enterprises. Marc continues to be involved
with Traveller, by advising Imperium Games, and by frequent
participation on the Traveller Mailing List. <Also, beginning
with Emperor\'s Arsenal,> Marc <has>{intends to} directly
review<ed> all <Imperium Games>{future} products in the Traveller
line<, and will continue to do so>. Only those products that meet
his standards and align with his vision of what Traveller should
be will be published <by Imperium Games>.

Communicating With Other Traveller Enthusiasts

Are there any web sites with information about Traveller?

<Information about Traveller can be found at the Imperium Games
web site (http://www.imperiumgames.com), which also contains many
links to other sites of interest to Traveller enthusiasts. Also,
naturally, w>{W}e hope you\'ll look through the rest of the
Freelance Traveller site and find useful information here. 
Freelance Traveller also has a links page.  And, many of the
sites reachable from here <or from Imperium Games> will also have
additional links of their own.

Are there any IRC channels that are Traveller-related?

Certainly. Use any undernet server and join #traveller. The
channel has been registered, and is administered by Suzette
Dollar. Stop by any evening (U.S. time) and you\'ll almost
certainly find a few Traveller enthusiasts hanging out. Also on
this channel, there are occasionally scheduled moderated
discussions of a particular topic. These are generally scheduled
for Thursday evenings at 9:00PM (Eastern time). These events will
be announced in advance on the Traveller Mailing List, generally
about a week in advance of the discussion, but sometimes less. If
you need more information about IRC, contact your ISP. If you
don\'t know where to find an undernet server, visit
http://www.undernet.org, where you can find a complete list of
undernet servers worldwide.

Are there any mailing lists or newsgroups that are
Traveller-related?

Yes, indeed. Check out the Freelance Traveller Internet Resources
page, where you\'ll find information on the Traveller Mailing
List, the Traveller Technical Design List, the Traveller
<Language Project>{Cultural Development} list, and other lists as
they become available. While there are no specifically
Traveller-related newsgroups, there is the occasional discussion
of aspects of Traveller in the rec.games.frp hierarchy.

Who do I contact if I need an official answer to a
Traveller-related question?

Unfortunately, the "official" net representatives have resigned
their positions, leaving no real official presence to handle
questions, and therefore no source of "official" answers. 
However, both Marc Miller and Loren Wiseman are members of the
Traveller Mailing List, and there are a lot of other
knowledgeable people on the Traveller Mailing List and monitoring
various newsgroups where Traveller-related questions may be
appropriate. So you can ask your question in any of those
locations, or through the Freelance Traveller Q&A Page.

Where do you get your official answers?

As indicated in the previous question, there aren\'t really any
"official" answers. Some answers come from our own knowledge and
experience with Traveller; others come from the designers of the
game. Those that come from the designers are generally accepted
as being "official" in that they signal the intentions of the
designers - but even those answers have been known to generate
debate, and many players and referees have alternative
interpretations.

Product Release Information

When will [insert product here] be shipped?

<The officially published schedule, which indicates when products
will be shipped to distributors and direct customers, is known
not to be accurate as of the date of this FAQ; there has been
"slippage" for a number of reasons. The Freelance Traveller staff
is attempting to get some more accurate information.
Nevertheless, to give you an idea of what Imperium Games\'s future
release plans, we are printing the presently-publicized release
schedule.
 - Aliens Volume 1 was originally scheduled for publication in
August 1997.
 - Nobles was originally scheduled for publication in November
1997.
 - Marc Miller\'s Traveller, release 1.1 was originally scheduled
for publication in December 1997.
 - The Vilani Hypothesis was originally scheduled for publication
in December 1997.>{Since, at the moment, there is no company with
both a license for and a commitment to Traveller, there is
nothing resembling a publication schedule for Traveller products.
GURPS: Traveller is expected to be released during the summer of
1998, but the editors of Freelance Traveller have seen nothing
official on this.}

Marc Miller has indicated that no future product will be shipped
until it passes his quality checks and meets his vision of what
Traveller is and should be.

What products have already been released?

The following products are available {and will continue to be
available from Imperium Games while the supply lasts} (the number
in the list matches the number on the spine of the product):

In addition, the following products that do not have spine

to be available while supplies last}:

The Traveller Game Screen (also referred to as the Referee\'s
Screen)

Adventure One, The Long Way Home, is the first part of the BITS
adventure by the same name.  The BITS edition is reviewed here in
Freelance Traveller.

Adventure Two, Gateway, concludes the adventure begun in
Adventure One, and is the remainder of the BITS product.

Adventure Three, The Annililik Run

The Milieu 0 Campaign combines Milieu 0 and First Survey into a
single volume, and adds some supplemental information. This
product is reviewed in Freelance Traveller.

The Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society, issues 25 and
2<5>{6}<, are released>. Issues 1 through 24 were published by
Game Designers\' Workshop in digest-sized format from 1977 through
1987.  Imperium Games has since announced the discontinuation of
this Traveller magazine {and all future Traveller development}
<for the present>.

Other companies have released Traveller products, too. See the
section on Specific Questions About Traveller Products From Other
Companies for more information.

When will an error-corrected version of Traveller be available?

We don\'t know. All we know is that there is a commitment to
release one. We hope that it will be released during first or
second quarter of 1998.

Will a complete set of errata be available, or will customers
have to purchase the re-release when it comes out?

<Imperium Games has stated that they plan to have a complete set
of errata for the first edition of Traveller available both on
their web site and in printed form. It should therefore not be
necessary for you to purchase the re-release.>{Because of
Imperium Games discontinuing publication of Traveller, we can\'t
really answer this question.  Informally, Marc Miller has
indicated that he would support errata being available.}

What\'s this I hear about GURPS:Traveller?

Yes, it\'s true: Steve Jackson Games has received a license to
publish Traveller material. According to people involved in the
GURPS:Traveller project, GURPS:Traveller will be set in an
alternate Traveller timeline that diverges from the standard
Traveller timeline in the 1110\'s (Imperial dating). See the press
release from Steve Jackson Games, reproduced in the Freelance
Traveller News and Information section.

Specific Questions About Traveller Products< From Imperium Games>

What is going to be changed about Traveller history?

Now that Marc Miller is in charge of assuring that Traveller
material maintains consistency with previously published material
(including material considered official from prior editions of
Traveller), you can be sure that no changes will take place
unless Marc deems them to be in the best interests of the game.
Generally, the events will not change; what may very well change
is their interpretations - an event that happened in 200, and its
implications, may be understood differently in 200 than they will
be in 1100.

What changes will be made in subsequent printings of materials
for Marc Miller\'s Traveller?

The core rules will be updated to version 1.1, and will have all
the errata fixed and incorporated into the body.  The Starships
sourcebook will have proper deck plans, properly-designed ships,
and typos will be corrected.

I really don\'t like [insert rule here]...

If you don\'t like something about any Traveller product, change
it. Or live with it. It\'s your choice. The people designing the
game and producing the materials aren\'t gods, and they know it -
they\'re people just like you. That means that they can\'t create
the perfect system for everyone, and they know that as well. They
take the view that what they are creating are guidelines, not
laws carved in stone. And if you do decide to change rules or
create new ones, there are a lot of people out there that will be
interested in seeing what you\'ve done. So, we\'d appreciate it if
you\'d share those changes with us. See our Submissions Guidelines
page for how to submit the material, and below in this FAQ
(specifically, the Copyright Policy Information section) for
information on copyright issues connected with Traveller.

My local game store doesn\'t carry Traveller products. How can I
get Traveller?

In most places, the market operates on the basis of supply and
demand. If there\'s no demand, there will be no supply. If there
is no supply, then a logical conclusion would be that demand
needs to be created. So, go out and create some demand (there are
some ideas for that in the answer to the next question). If that
doesn\'t work, or if you\'re simply too impatient, you can always
order directly from Imperium Games.

I can\'t find any Traveller players in my area. How can I play
Traveller?

This ties in with creating demand for Traveller, to encourage
your local game store to carry Traveller products. You might have
ideas of your own; go for them - these are just some ideas that
we\'ve come up with:

 - Run through some simple scenarios with prospective
customers/players. For example, a meeting with a patron, a casual
encounter, hitting a target with a weapon, and so on.   Show how
simple it is to use the system.

 - Talk up the system in places where you know local gamers
gather. Emphasize how the system has room for all sorts of tastes
in gaming.

 - If your local gaming store allows it, and has the facilities
to do it, set up and run sessions there, where people can come
and watch - and ask questions, which will give you an opening to
talk up the system.  It\'s even better if you can offer them an
opportunity to sit in on your game for a few minutes.

Of course, there are other ways out there as well. If you set
your mind to it, you can find ways that work for you.

What <is Imperium Games doing>{will be done} to improve the
quality of <their>{Traveller} products?

The first edition of Marc Miller\'s Traveller, and the first
edition of Starships did not meet the quality standards that
Imperium Games wants for its products. They also did not measure
up to Marc Miller\'s standards. <Imperium Games has placed Marc
Miller in charge of product oversight, and they have>{Marc
intends to maintain oversight of future Traveller product
development, and has on many occasions} solicited (and
continue{s} to solicit) feedback from Traveller enthusiasts. <The
design and editing staffs have undergone changes because of the
response to the first two publications in the T4 line. Also, Marc
plans to bring on a professional graphic designer, and broaden
the number of art sources they use.>

<Specific Questions About Traveller Products From Other
Companies>

What other companies publish Traveller material?

At the moment, two British companies, BITS and CORE, have been
licensed to publish Traveller material. Also, Steve Jackson Games
has been licensed to publish Traveller material compatible with
their GURPS system.

Who or What is BITS?

BITS stands for British Isles Traveller Support, and is headed by
Andy Lilly. They\'ve published the following Traveller
supplements:

 - 101 Cargos, containing descriptions of different kinds of
goods that can be used as hooks or other elements in a scenario
or adventure. (reviewed in Freelance Traveller)

 - 101 Plots, containing summaries of things that a referee could
use in the central story line of an adventure or scenario.
(reviewed in Freelance Traveller)

 - The Long Way Home, a complete adventure on the Imperial fringe
in Milieu 0. (reviewed in Freelance Traveller)

 - 101 Lifeforms, containing descriptions of lifeforms and their
habitats to add verisimilitude to a scenario, campaign, or
adventure. (reviewed in Freelance Traveller)

 - 101 Rendezvous, containing descriptions of places where people
might meet people. (reviewed in Freelance Traveller)

 - 101 Travellers, containing profiles of the people that PCs
might meet (perhaps in one of the 101 Rendezvous?). (reviewed in
Freelance Traveller)

 - The Traveller Bibliography, a complete listing of virtually
all Traveller products published by all companies, for any
version of Traveller.

Who or What is CORE?

CORE doesn\'t appear to be an acronym for anything, even though
it\'s written in all-caps.   Jo Grant heads up this organization,
formally called the CORE Gaming Collective. CORE works closely
with BITS, and also has some projects of its own, such as a
Traveller collectable-card game.

What can you tell me about GURPS:Traveller?

The GURPS:Traveller timeline is going to be an alternate
Traveller universe which splits off from the Imperium Games/Game
Designers\' Workshop universe around Imperial year 1110. In the
GURPS:Traveller universe, Emperor Strephon is not assassinated,
there is no civil war, and Virus is never released. Loren
Wiseman, from the original Game Designers\' Workshop team, will be
overseeing the GURPS:Traveller product line for Steve Jackson
Games, and will also be involved in art direction and some
production.

Copyright Policy Information

What is <Imperium Games>{Marc Miller}\'s{/FarFuture\'s} copyright
policy in regards to original works posted to mailing lists,
newsgroups, or the World-Wide Web?

If you\'re not making money from it in any way, all you need to do
is include the message "Traveller is a trademark of Far Future
Enterprises" and you\'ll be fine. Many people include additional
acknowledgements and disclaimers as well, but these are not
required.

<Imperium Games and> Far Future Enterprises encourage{s}
Traveller fans to create their own material - from weapons,
equipment, and vehicles to rules variants to scenarios,
adventures, and campaigns. They further encourage the sharing of
this material; it can only improve the game. But see the
questions below on commercial publication.

What is the policy regarding copying previously published works
by Game Designers\' Workshop?

Since all of that material is owned by Marc Miller at this point,
you need his permission. He can be reached at FarFuture@aol.com
for e-mail, or c/o Imperium Games via paper-mail.

What about previously published works from other sources?

You must contact the owner of the copyrights on those works for
permission and terms. The latest information available to
Freelance Traveller on the status of Digest Group Publications
material is that all rights are owned by Roger Sanger, and that
as yet, he has no agreement <with Imperium Games> to reprint
their Traveller material. We have no information on the status of
works published by any other company at this time - but if you
do, we\'d appreciate hearing what you know.

If I create an original work for Traveller, who owns it?

You do. You may want to include a copyright notice in your work
to explicitly state this. But, your ownership of your work
doesn\'t mean that you can make money from it - you need Imperium
Games\'s permission to do that.  See the questions "How do I get a
license to publish my original work commercially?" and "How do I
contact an existing licensee to offer them my work?".

Is there any way around all this stuff?

Yes. Don\'t refer to Traveller in your work, and don\'t incorporate
material from Traveller or any Traveller-related product. Say
that it is for Science Fiction RPGs, and keep it generic.

Can my original Traveller work be published without my
permission?

No. Just like you need permission to refer to reference Traveller
in your works, or to incorporate Traveller materials, so too do
they need your permission to reference or incorporate or
otherwise use your work.

How do I get a license to publish my original work commercially?

If you don\'t want to publish it under the <Imperium Games>
label<, or that> of any <of its>{existing Traveller} licensee<s>,
you\'ll have to contact <Imperium Games>{Marc Miller/FarFuture
Enterprises} to get a license (you don\'t need a license to sell
your work to <Imperium Games or> a licensee - but then, they\'re
the ones publishing it, not you).< You can contact Imperium Games

Yes. You mean that landing onto a defended, built-up area with 12\' tides
and easily minable channels that where the knocking out of a handful of
landing craft could have crippled the entire landing ? The one with an
undefended beach 50km away with none of these problems ?

The *only* redeeming feature of the Pusan landings was that they worked.

Secondly, his illegal and *incredibly* provactive authorisation of attacks
on China brought the Chinese into the war, and turned what was a nice
little win for the UN forces into a slugfest. 

Thirdly, his complete discounting of the possibility of Chinese
intervention led to the adoption of a advance rate and posture that left
the UN forces strung out and badly vulnerable to counter-attack. 

He should have been cashiered over the Philipines, and shot over Korea.

Okay, the television was the ultimate in bad televised SF, but the film
more than redeems the concept of the starlost family.

(note: this is going both to the Duchovny and Traveller lists.  Duchovniks
ignore the Ob Trav and TMLers ignore the Sniper .sig, and nobody gets hurt.)

 In 2058, Professor John Robinson (William Hurt) leads a mission to start
settlement of an Earth like world, since our Earth is dying.  To prove his
sincerity (and to get them off the planet) he brings his family along; wife
Maureen (a biologist), daughters Judy (medical doctor) and Penny (teen
geek-goth), and son Will (electronics genius- makes Wesley Crusher look
like a slacker.)  Along for the ride is last minute replacement pilot Major
West and a truly evil Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman having the time of his life),
who is betrayed by the folks who paid him to sabotage the ship.

There is a plot among the special effects, and I won\'t be giving away to
much by saying that it has a lot of fun with the concept of time-travel and
redemption.  The action is fast and furious, the effects excellent, and all
in all a good ride.

Hurt\'s performance as the remote father is a bit to restrained, and it
makes his few outburst seem forced.  The bulk of the cast does a
serviceable job of reading their lines and hitting marks.  This is Gary
Oldman\'s movie though.  His Dr. Smith oozes evil from every pore.  He plays
just enough to the television Smith without becoming a parody.  It works,
because we occasionally forget that he is a self-proclaimed monster.

The film\'s ending is *very* predictable, and has series written all of it,
but I didn\'t mind.  Very enjoyable, well worth a matinee viewing.  This is
a definite popcorn flick.  One warning: the end credits are unwatchable.
They flash like a disco on speed.

Ob Trav: Lots of neat ideas to be mined from this film.  The Jupiter 2
reminded me of a Type A free trader.

The Sniper, picking popcorn out of his teeth...

Title: _Mark Miller\'s TRAVELLER Gateway to the Stars_

Author: Pierce Askegren

Publisher:  Pocket Books

ISBN: 0-671-01188-X

Price: 5.99 US / 7.99 Can

Page Count: 327

So, far I\'ve read the back cover, the Prologue, and half the first chapter.
I\'ve only seen one boo-boo, low-berths are refered to as being drugged,
frozen, and stowed in the cargo bay...close but not quite. ;->  Vilani is
misspelled as Velani a couple of places in the Prologue, but generally he
has the Traveller history right.

                    =====================================
Back cover blurb:

 With Farworld as  his first port of call, independent shipper Navis
Redling is back in business after a year in detox. Or so it seems...

 The man claiming to be Redling is in reality a notorious criminal who has
bought Redling\'s identity -- including his face, some memories, and a
spaceship. What he has also bought is a heap of trouble in the form of
Redling\'s checkered past and current enemies. Redling clearly had good
reason to part with his identity.

 But the man taking Redling\'s identity has more difficulties than that. Two
of the passengers he ferries through the Galactic Rim are dangerous: Kob
Thrommus, an undercover secret agent, and Ku-Ril-La, a mysterious member of
the enigmatic Guy-Troy. Redling does not believe Ku-Ril-La\'s claims that he
is simply re-creating a trip he took in his youth -- and he must work to
make sure Kob does not learn his true identity!

 It\'s non-stop action and adventure from Pierce Askegren, the acclaimed
author of the best-selling novels _Sabotage_, _Wreckage_ and _Countdown to
Chaos_.
             ========================================

I\'ll post more after I have a chance to read it.

No I am sure they did not either, but the design system as published did
not have any minimum volumes required for meson guns in the first place
and _that_ was the problem with it. It would be nice if GURPS Traveller
closed this loophole.

My primary reason for suggesting the elimination of the beam pointer was
not practicality but verisimilitude.  I do not think a man portable
meson gun needs a beam pointer since it uses the mark 1 eyeball for a
targeting system. 

> Arguably no small arm should require a beam
> pointer since it will be manually fired.  

The design I posted had a beam pointer.
 
> Then again, rules always seem to get in the way of some peoples\' fun.

Well I would say rather that the lack of a minimum total volume, mass,
etc, listed for meson guns on the table was the problem.  If you cannot
create a munchkin weapon then you will not.

If on the other hand the design sequences do not stop you from making a
munchkin weapon then that suggests that designers thought that a weapon
with these capabilities was a "legitimate" creation of that tech level.
I would not want man portable meson weapons in a campaign either but if
the design sequence does not forbid them they must be valid.

Possibly, possibly not.  As far as it goes now they\'re two seperate
companies.  One happens to be owned by the other.  But TSR is still TSR and
WotC is still WotC.

Get one too few cards in your Magic booster pack?  Take it to WotC.

Want to see a return of Gamma World?  Take it to TSR.

That\'s my final statement on the whole shebang.

Eris,

Beam pointers were originally for a *constant* target data updating
mechanisms. Unfortunately with Bruce\'s Sensor System they are not needed
except when you have a SA (Semi Active) homing missiles. Bruces Sensor
system has methods to hand off target locks without the need of beam pointers.

In their *original* intent they were a *questionable* value. It has been
debated/discussed on the GDW Beta/Trav Tech list many times as to the
*value* of a beam pointer. 

Some have said that a beam pointer included the *traversing* mechanisms for
the weapon at hand, but that has many *holes*, ie spinal mounts do don\'t
need a *traversing* mechanism, why does of single small turret have the
same *traversing* mechanism that a 100 ton bay mount has, or why does a
*battery* of weapons only need one beam pointer for *traversing* mechanism.
The list of *holes* goes on and on. 

Others have said that a beam pointer is *fine alignment* mechanism for the
weapon(s) but some of the same *holes* from above apply.

In the end beam pointers were a gaming ill thought out wargaming *kludge*
brought to you by the same person(s) that gave TNE the less than plasma
temp Heplar drives, even though several persons have proved otherwise about
the Heplar drives output temps.

The problem is that Meson guns are point weapons not straight line weapons.
Pointing it at somebody isn\'t enough, you\'ve got to have it decay within a narrow
band of about .2 meters.  Less or more and its detonating outside the guy, thus
apply armor (I don\'t know what the blast radius is for mesons though).  Thus you
most certainly need some sort of range finding device (and a very accurate one at
that).  To paraphrase a popular saying, its much easier to hit the inside of a
broad barn than it is to hit a man. You\'re also fighting the square cube law.  For
a CPR gun, you\'re trying to hit a surface.  For a meson gun, you\'re trying to hit
a  volume.

We\'ve been working along similar lines. In my modular ship I\'ve built the
J-drive as a "lollipop" shape which includes a manuver drive, a power plant,
a J-drive, and "removable" fule tanks (not drop tanks but station
replacables that can be changed according to mission).

THe "stick" is a series of docking rings for shuttles of various sizes but
with standard connections. Each shuttle is self contained, with it\'s own
power and manuver drive ( they are also configurable, designed to hold
standard containers that include cargo, lab and cabin arrangements, also
semi-self contained). One shuttle is the living quarters for the crew, as
well as lifeboat and landing for same.

Since the ship is for primary systems it doesn\'t really carry weapons,
however the shuttle(s) do. I also see it operating as a mil ship (merchant
marine) in the area of my campaign, a light jump carrier in times of need,
with the riders carrying the weapons and it performing a quick in and out
system jump.

Size and tonnage is also variable, increase the J-drive size and the fuel
capacity and ad another sreies of docing rings to the "stick".

What I really wanted was an attachable J-drive module. This is as close as
I\'ve gotten.

Don\'t know if it helps in your case. In mine the deck plans are comeing out
neat as heck. I\'m also using some of the ideas for an early Terran,
non-artificial grave version.

I\'ve been a GURPS detractor based on its combat system for a long time now.
 However, in "boning up" on it recently for the upcoming G:T, I\'ve got to
be honest.  It\'s an absolutely wonderful system.  It\'s tied together so
well, and so many little things have been taken into account (the
smothering and choking rules, for example) that it\'s hard _not_ to like it.

I\'m still not sold entirely on the combat, although in rereading a few
times over, I like the level of detail in the combats.  I like the "feel"
of the combats, but, I\'m still concerned that the rules are a little
klunky.

The main selling point for GURPS, in my opinion, is the fact that just
about anything can be plugged into it.  You could learn the rules and play
with just about any genre without having to learn anything new. 
Furthermore, you can plug in things from other sourcebooks painlessly and
effortlessly.  Finally, another big selling point, is that it\'s an
incredibly robust and complete system with alot of playtesting behind it. 
The fact that so many things are covered by the rules is truly impressive.

Just my 2 cents worth.

Well, Random House, I believe, distributed TSR stuff to the book trade for
a while.  Don\'t know if they still do.  But, it is pretty interesting
nonetheless...

I was thinking that you may, in fact, be right with your idea that
Traveller may be picked up by someone way in left field if Pocket Books is
considering becoming involved with RPGs.

Actually, you\'re missing something here.  Those spinal weapons have HUGE ranges
which require the longer range and thus LARGER beam pointers.

Chris,
The thing to remember with Gurps is to throw out the rules that slow down
YOUR game. If/as your players become more familiar withe the combat
sequence, you can add more and more detail. The detail is there, but don;t
use it all at once with new players (and especially with a new GM!). As your
game, campaign grows it\'ll grow into the rules.

See above. Use what you need to for YOU game. Toss out the rest, but, if you
continue to play GURPS, you\'ll wind up adding in the complexity eventually.

That\'s the beauty of it all right! I\'ve been playing it since version 1
(migrated from the Fantasy Trip, designed by Steve J for Metagames and a
direct ancestor to GURPS). Once the players and the Ref have the ground
works anything is possible. Best game we had was a pickup involving the Old
West and Space:1889 type of sci-fi. Didn\'t have a western world book then,
nor one covering 1889, just plugged in the sci-fi elements for 1889 and
everyone\'s "knowledge" of t.v. westerns, and used GURPS combat (which we all
knew). One of the best off the cuff games we ever had!

You might want to think about combining these fuel tanks into a cargo/fuel
module.  That way the module can be loaded up at the station and brought out of
the gravity well to wait for the freighter cutting down turnaround time.

My freighter improves jump performance when empty.  In fact, if I filled the bay
with fuel as well as the internal fuel tanks, the empty freighter could pull a
double 6 jump.  12 parsecs in 2 weeks!  Unfortunately, dragging around close to
600 dTons extra cargo kinda puts a crimp on things.

So each ring contains additional jump capacity etc.  Very similar concept...

My plans involve the freighter itself being in mostly zero-grav but capable of
installing thruster modules to generate gravity (via thrust) perpendicular to
the disk plane.  Primarily this is for landing when planetary gravity takes over
and the whole thing turns into a sky scraper (if stacked really high).  Some
modules will have their own artificial gravity though.

It looks to me as though there will be some stiff competition between these
designs...

Is that the sentence from GDW\'s version of FFS? It has been so long, I don\'t
remember, and my copy is still in a box in a storage locker in Illinois. If it
is from the GDW FF&S, it is the same sentence Scott (2G) Kellogg quoted back
at me when I mentioned the same thing to him, lo these many years ago (and
which three weeks after we sent the book to the printer I predicted to Dave
Nilsen: "I\'ll be seeing that sentence quoted back at me real soon now..."). My
response then is my response now: It is a poorly written sentence, and would
have been corrected had we done another edition (instead of simply telling the
printer "do the same thing again"). The fact that GDW provided for shoulder
stocks, pistol graps, and such in the laser sequence, and _did not_ in the PAW
& meson gun sequence is proof GDW didn\'t intend for there to be hand carried
meson guns. QED.

Scott got rather huffy with me, as I recall, but that may have been because I
(in a spirit of fun) accused him of wanting to do Traveller: Ghostbusters...:
)

>OTOH, I don\'t know if I like the idea of paw or meson pistols.

I certainly don\'t -- I think they\'d unbalance the look and feel of the game

I\'d say that the problems are long training time *and* the fact that
the brain *keeps* learning. So even though you can copy a "starter",
due to the inherently "limited" experience of the robot brain it has a
much stronger tendency than humans to "learn the wrong lesson". This
*severely* limits their usefulness.

In other words, any time you have the AI make an exception, or tell it
that the rules *here* are a bit different from the ones it was trained
under, you increase the chance that it\'ll make a "wrong" decision at
some future point. 

Such wrong decisions should have a sort of logic too them, but kind of
skewed. Say for example that you\'d told a "customs" robot to let
Frederick Fortesque, the leader of some planet, thru without being
checked. Alas, you weren\'t *specific* in stating that he was let thru
because he was the leader. So the AI might decide that people named
Frederick, or Fortesque don\'t need to be checked.

This is a *reasonable* decision GIVEN THE AI\'S KNOWLEDGE. The fact that
it is ludicrous in *human* terms is merely because of our greater
knowledge base.

This is also great for driving players *nuts*.

Everything not forbidden is compulsary?

Sorry...It is late and I\'m tired. Dave Nilsen did not intend to allow tham
smaller than vehicle-sized until after TL15, but we didn\'t phrase it
especially well. I think he did intend to have then at TL 17 or so, which may
be why ther was no lower limit on the size.

I\'ll have to check with David Pulver and see what limits GURPS puts on Meson
weapons.

True. TSR and Random house parted ways shortly before the buyout, however.
Don\'t know who distributes the stuff to the book trades now. I do know WOTC
moved TSR to Washingon state -- lock, stock and barrel...dunno if they moved
into the same building, but the business cards from Dragon ad reps and such
say WOTC at the top, whatever that\'s worth -- they probably eliminated all of
the duplicate admin positions.

Well, disads are pretty modular.  You can just drop them (or
just have the players choose few without taking points) without
changing the game system much.

You can also roll attribute (to come out in whatever range you
want) but it is harder to randomly get advantes and skills (not
impossible, just more work).  You could roll attributes and
have the players buy the rest (either giving fixed points for
them or a larger pool that the points for the attributes rolled
is subtracted).

Well, that would be good for those who believe in the Traveller

Loren,

The problem isnt the handheld weapons - indeed, a PAW is the only way I can
see that you can get a traditional "Laser Rifle" under FFS2.

The handheld weapons of vaguely reasonable range and damage value tend to
be at or around 90 kilos, so they are battledress-only weapons. I mean, a
1d6 damage PAW body pistol is cute, but it isnt what I\'d issue to my palace
guard.

The problem is when you go upscale slightly, to artillery size weapons. As
an example, I\'d cite \'The Solution\', a TL11 Meson Artillery piece, which I
posted a while ago.

Essentially, it is a 30 km range Meson Gun, linked to a TL11 Fire Direction
Center. Instant fire to any point within 50km, with zero time delay, and no
LOS or time to target issues.

This sort of weapon revolutionises TL11 and up military tactics. For
example, meson screens start to be mounted on most military vehicles.
Militaries without meson screens start going to dispersion or stealth
tactics. Marines become fire-support spotters. And so on.

We need to make them illegal.

Doesn\'t a meson gun need to know the distance to the target?

Oh sure, not just GURPS.  The same goes for any game!  I have no problem
ripping out what I don\'t like.  Of course, the problem is in this case, I
_like_ the combat system and its level of detail, just worried about how
slowly it\'ll run.

This is a letter that was in an old EC comic called "Weird Science" in the
early 1950s.  I was originally going to post it as a ha-ha to the list, but
it got me thinking about something else entirely.  Many of you who have
seen my diatribes against "silver jumpsuits and flying cars" visions of the
future may be surprised to know that I am a huge fan of "Weird Science" and
Buck Rogers and all of that good stuff.  In fact, I was a huge fan of Buck
Rogers growing up (not the horrid TV show, but the excellent comic strip)
although it was pretty much outdated before I was even born.  Although it
was laughable by my birth, it is amazing how many "predictions" that the
Buck Rogers strip made that eventually came true.  The sophistication of
EC\'s "Weird Science" is also fascinating.  Sure, they were off the mark,
and often implausible...  But they had such interesting and engrossing
stories.  In one story, we have a picture of Adam and Eve as remnants of
our dying race transported to the past to start the human race anew.  In
another, we have a tale of an interstellar scout who is dropped off to
survey a planet inhabited by human beings, who ends up becoming a
Jesus-like martyr.  I could go on with short synopses for awhile, and this
has nothing to do with my point or the direction I want to take this
letter.

And, the direction I want to take with this letter has nothing to do with
Traveller, at least on the surface.  It was Traveller that got me thinking
in this direction, and probably as I continue to think, I\'ll pop something
out of this thought train that is related to Traveller in some way.  Maybe
not right now, but eventually I probably will.  When I read the book
"Donnie Brasco" after seeing the excellent movie, I read the book, and I
was inspired to start thinking about organized crime in the Traveller
universe.  The Vargr were easy, just imagine the real mafia with your
finger on the fast forward button.  The other races still haven\'t come to
me.  But I digress, I\'m wavering from my point again...

Which is "cultural resonance," as the title might indicate.  "What is
cultural resonance?" You might ask?  In the early 1950s, a guy named John
Loeb, who was probably a student at a college in Louisiana, felt the need
to point out that space travel was, and always would be, impossible.  His
argument wasn\'t well thought out.  I could have taken it apart with no
trouble when I was 6 or 7.  Anyone on this list could take it apart, or,
more importantly, could have taken it apart, even in the early 50s.

The Soviets would, in a relatively short time, prove this kid wrong by
shooting someone into orbit.  Then, the president of the United States
would predict that we\'d have someone on the moon within 10 years.  An
entire nation worked toward this goal.  Kennedy was the sort of person that
could inspire people in that way.  His death cemented it.  His dream would
live on.  What a more fitting way to keep his legacy alive then to actually
pull it off...  And we did, as Americans, but even moreso, as a race.

Sure, the cynical among you will point out that we were in the midst of the
Cold War, that this was a grand, public way of saying, "Hey you Reds, our
Kung-Fu is better than your Kung-Fu.  How about a little golf?"  But there
was more to it than that.  Very few people really think twice about the
Lunar Landing.  Nobody seems to really care anymore.  The Soviet Union is
gone so what\'s the point?  Nobody even thinks of how difficult it was to go
from the 50s to the moon landing, the jump that happened there.  This is
one example of cultural resonance.  The world was ready, the political
situation was right, and a science-fiction dream was made into reality. 
For a fleeting moment, the future was in our hands.  Not my hands.  It
would be a few years before I would come along.  But the future was in our
hands, and there\'s a chill up my spine as I think about it.  What was. What
is. What could have been. What will be.  The time was right for the idea to
snowball, and it did.  This wasn\'t the only example of cultural resonance
at the time.  No, not by a long shot...

There were plenty of other snowballs rolling at the time.  The W.S.
Burroughs camp snowballed into the beatniks, which added steam to the folk
movement, still in its infancy.  Dylan one day plugged himself in at a folk
festival, and played on an electric guitar.  The folk die-hards screamed
bloody murder, but that single act influenced the music that would come
down the pike.  Dylan risked his reputation, his very livelihood, on a
gamble.  The whole thing exploded soon after that.  There were other
influences.  Chain stores were driving mom and pop stores out of business. 
Computers were turning everyone into mere numbers.  Automation was changing
the face of the world...  There was a war on the other side of the world
that made no sense to anybody, and a media that pointed out that blunt fact
with body counts every night.  Many people saw the future that was going to
be, and the future that could be instead, and the world was changed. 
People took the future into their hands for a few short years...

We\'ll back up one more time.  There were people who saw the way race
relations were, and saw the future, a future where children would be
deprived merely because of the color of their skin.  They saw the way the
world would go if they didn\'t do something.  The Reverend Martin Luther
King, a deeply religious and spiritual man, took it upon himself to do
something.  One man started a journey.  One man made one speech which made
everyone sit up and listen, and made everyone realize there was something
deeply wrong with the way things were, and allowed everyone to dream of the
way things could be, and the world changed because of it.  Once again, the
future was in our hands, and we at least, gave the dream a shot...

In all of these cases, there was cultural resonance.  Change can\'t occur if
nobody\'s ready for that change.  Some part of a culture, some part of a
race must be ready.  The idea has to simmer and boil, even if it\'s deep in
the subconscious.  The dreams have to take root first.

In this case, many of the dreams took place in cheap, tawdry
science-fiction first.  EC comics gave children stories, stories that would
sit in the back of their heads until the time was right, like an egg
waiting to hatch.  Between the images of many tentacled alien monsters,
with huge eyes and huge heads and huge teeth invading the world, there were
other images.  Images of a future in which things were brighter.  One
story, "A Close Shave" gives us a view of the future on our planet, where
the only thing that sets the aliens from Ganymede apart from Earthlings is
the amount of hair on their bodies.   Where Ganymedians shave their bodies
with radium razors and pass into human society so they can get decent jobs.
 Where an earth woman falls in love with a Ganymedian and tells him that
she, too, uses a radium razor to soothe his tortured soul.  She kisses life
in the society she knows goodbye, and moves with him to Ganymede...  It
makes you wonder what really caused the government investigation of comics,
the violence, or such bold messages.  Remember, this is all pre-1953.

And then there was Rod Serling.  He thrilled and chilled with the same kind
of stories that EC told, stories with a twist at the end.  Many were run of
the mill, but there were some that ribbed us gently and poked fun at our
fears, while others made us really think about ourselves and our
responsibilities as a nation, as a culture, as a race.  When people raised
their eyebrows and said, "Waitaminnit, you\'re teaching our kids that the
commies are people too," Serling smiled and said, "Nope, just good clean
sci-fi, with rocket ships, and ironic endings..."  Nowadays, that show, and
the Outer Limits are looked upon as classics despite their many flaws.  But
they primed a generation for change, set them up so that when the whole
thing would explode years down the line they\'d be ready.  There was
something deep about these shows that makes them stunning even to this day.
 When I stayed up late to watch these shows on public TV and UHF stations,
I never realized what it was that drew me to them, or what drew the others
I\'d meet that were touched by the same stories.

Lately, cultural resonance struck again with the internet.  The first
usenet-type newsgroups that weren\'t related to science or the military were
set up to talk about this wonderful new show Star Trek.  Gene Roddenberry\'s
future, dated and laughable now, created a very real ripple in the way the
world would be heading in a few decades.  His show tried, sometimes too
hard, to point out our own flaws and to make us believe the future could be
great.  On the bridge we had Kirk, strong and Kennedy-like, the "youngest
starship captain" leading his crew into the future.  And what a future it
was!  You had a black woman, an asian, a half/human alien hybrid, and
eventually a Russian!  Knock the franchise that Star Trek has become all
you want, but you have to wonder at how _big_ all this stuff had to seem at
the time.

Later, "cyberpunk" authors like Gibson and Sterling, and filmmakers like
Ridley Scott and James Cameron, and the Heavy Metal authors primed us for
other futures, some bright, some dark and twisted.  In the Alien series,
Weyland-Yutani is called "The Company" and they not only send the Nostromo
to the stars to fill its belly with ore, they make _beer_.  A
megacorporation.  Blade Runner shows us a gritty, overcrowded future on one
hand, but something deeper and more disturbing shines through.  A blimp
above Harrison Ford bellows out "A new future awaits you on the off-world
colonies!" and then describes that replicants will serve you there.  Later,
we find  out that replicants are people too, and Roy Batty\'s dying speech
is enough to almost bring tears to one\'s eyes, "I have seen things that you
people wouldn\'t believe..."  Gibson\'s future is one of massive
corporations, but it\'s also one where Rastas have a space station that, Mir
like, gets by on bubble-gum and coathangers.  A future where a Russian
space station gets a death sentence, threatening the life of the one
inhabitant who requires the zero-gee environment to live, and who is saved
by a group of ballooning nomads who stage their own flight into space. 
Again, I could go on, and lose sight of my point.

The Internet is an example of cultural resonance in action.  Look at where
it is now, as opposed to 10 years ago, see how far that it has come, and
how far it has brought us.  The cynical will disagree, but to those people
I point to Traveller, a dream and a game that even if unsupported would
manage to live on as a result of the Internet.  

Now, it\'s time to start tying this to Traveller, as tying this whole
rambling excuse for an essay just to science-fiction isn\'t really enough...

A few years ago, I went on a work sponsored trip to the Virgin Islands. 
While there, on one of the less crowded islands, I was in a hot tub with
several co-workers, including my ex-girlfriend.  My eyes went upwards at
one point and I saw the sky at night.  For the first time, I really saw the
sky that my ancestors saw.  Not just the big stars, not just the bright
ones, but the milky white powdery clumps of them in the sky.  I was filled
with complete awe, I mean really brimming with emotions.  I commented that
I could understand how people in the past saw gods in the sky, saw heroes,
and dragons, and other wonders.  For the first time, I really comprehended
how small and insignificant we are as individuals, as cultures, as a
planet.  Nobody else in the hot tub understood a word of what I was saying.
 It was really and truly frustrating.  I\'ve never looked at the sky at
night the same way again.

Then, later on one night back home, I happened to see the moon.  For the
first time, I really comprehended it.  We had been there!  Not me, I wasn\'t
even born yet.  But _we_ as a race had taken a single, faltering step out
of the cradle.  We had been there!  And I think for once I understood the
tiniest fraction of what people must\'ve felt when back in the late 60s
everybody watched and listened in wonder as the first words came back from
people _standing_ on the moon.  After that moment, I\'ve never looked up at
the moon the same way again.

Then there\'s Mir...  I won\'t get into that in-depth, but Mir made another
change in the way I look at things.  Almost as if it was a signpost:
"Welcome to Space, Population: 4" or something like that.  Mir makes me
believe that maybe, despite all the political bullshit, despite everything
that\'s holding us back, there is something to dream about.  This New Years,
the astronauts on Mir wished everybody a "Happy New Year" on television. 
Nobody else at the New Year\'s Eve party I was at this year really saw what
it meant when my best friend and I raised our vodka glasses and gave each
other a hearty Russian "Cheers!" and downed our glasses.

When I was talking about technological conservatism in Traveller, the
subject of nanotech came up, and someone said, "It would change the way we
think, it\'s not like Jump Drive"...

Maybe we\'re jaded or something, but am I the only one that thinks Jump
Drive would totally revolutionize the way we think?  Am I the only one that
imagines Terra\'s first attempted Jump and our breathlessness as we wait for
some sign, some word of success...  Then, success!  It worked!  Each of
those stars has endless possibilities.  No one would ever look at the stars
the same way ever again.  

And then, the grim realization that other human beings from somewhere else
have already gone and taken this step, and they have their own empire...

Or, thousands of years earlier, the feelings that coursed through the
culture of the Vilani when the first ship came back from a successful jump.
 Can any of us imagine the changes that just _knowing_ that we can get to
the stars we see at night would bring?  The fundamental fabric of a society
would change so drastically that I personally can\'t even begin to imagine
it.  I look up the stars with a distant hope, "Maybe some day one of us
will bathe in the light of those distant suns!  Maybe we\'ll see all of the
beauty and wonder that\'s out there!" but then, the reality that, at the
moment, nobody really knows how to go FTL, and many think that it\'s
completely impossible.  And that hope drops like a stone into the pit of my
stomach.  That\'s when I usually realize that we may really not get too far
off of this rock, but the hope still sits at the back of my head.

Okay, I\'ve rambled way too long.  Digest folks are going to want my head on
a stick.  If you\'ve made it this far, I hope this essay was worth it.  I
admit, on the surface it doesn\'t seem directly related to Traveller. 
There\'s no stats, no gearheaded calculations or adventure seeds.  Just try
to imagine a culture coming to its senses after the Long Night, and a
leader who is capable of filling the hearts and minds of the people of the
Sylean Federation with the dreams of a manifest destiny.  The cultural
resonance of such a concept, and the changes it would bring!  The stars
will be ours!  The cynics can argue about it later, and deconstruct him,
and demonize him...  But the idea that _he_ looked at the stars in a way
that I can never imagine and managed to make his vision a reality is truly,
_truly_ awe-inspiring.

Sorry for taking up so much of everybody\'s time.  Just had to get that out.

It\'d take *prolonged* exposure to cause vacuum welding and you\'d have
to *remove* the lubricants first. And it\'d take a little while for the
lubricants to turn to gum (or to \'shellac\').

In open space there\'s a bigger problem. In shadow, that gun will cool
off pretty fast. Wanna try firing a gun when the steel parts are at
- -200 F? If it isn\'t too badly jammed to work, it may explode (at those
temps steel is *damn* brittle).

But with the right lubricants and either different materials, or care
taken to keep the gun at a reasonable temperature, you should be able
to do just fine.

No need to worry about dust. You see, at weapons level intenities
(above about 1 MW/cm^2) *air* undergoes ionization breakdown. That
means that chunks of the air in the beam turn into plasma, which glows
as it recombines into "normal" gases. I\'ve seen photos of a beam inside
a lab and it looks like a cheap special effect!

I think it was supposed to be something more like a .44 automag.
Something with a killer recoil.

The guy *wasn\'t* in a vaccsuit. The base was a sort of "domed city"
arrangement. 

I\'d guess that the bullets were around 30 grams *minimum*. And we\'ll
keep your 500 m/s muzzle velocity. But I\'d drop his mass to about 75
kilos (but all muscle!). 

75*v=500*.03
75*v=15
v=.2

Ok, it\'s only .2 m/s.

Well, most of the folks in the pirate base didn\'t have zero-g skill.

HE may disapprove but my 3 1/2 year old daughter would LOVE to have one !
Especially if Barbie could use it.  To me x-wife\'s disdain Morgan loves
Barbie stuff.. Barbie dresses, computer programs, dolls...... She is also
into guns. Must get it from daycare. I did not teach her about them yet.

I just asked Morgan if she would like a Barbie scale Particle Accelerator
Pistol and she gave me a BIG GRIN and shook her head YES! 

The best thing about kids is that all things are possible and practical !
They do not have any disbelief that needs to be suspended!

Can we implant one of those in my nose?

No, remember that you exit jump with the velocity you entered it with.
That\'s why a "standing jump" is a good idea. It minimizes the "extra"
accelerating you need to do.

Having your exit point move is a bit weird.

According to an earlier post by Marc you exit when your "course"
crosses *anything\'s* 100 diameter limit. That\'s another reason to go
with the idea of a "fixed" exit point. That way you it\'s *much* easier
to tell if a ship\'s course intersects a 100 diameter "sphere".

BTW, if we allow for the "ecliptic" plane of the star systems to be
tilted with respect to each other, then the odds of intercepting the
star\'s limit go *way* down.

Do you happen to know if there\'s any "reliable" data on the axial tilt
distributions of stars?

You can jump to anywhere as long as it *isn\'t* inside a 100 diameter limit.

30 km/sec is *probably* fairly typical. But a lot depends on the star
size and how far out the planet is.

It\'s not linear. What you do is use the formula and figure out how long
it takes the ship to cover *half* the distance at the given
acceleration. That gets you to the half way point. You\'ll be
*decelerating* at the same rate over the second half. So you take the
time for halfway and double it.

Here are the formulas (D in meters, A in meters/sec^2, T in seconds)
These are all for going from a standing start, and *not* stopping.

D = .5*A*T^2	<- when you know the time & accel and want distance
T = sqrt(2D/A)	<- when you know the accel and distance and want time
A = 2D/T^2	<- when you know the distance and time and want accel

V = A*T	<- when you know the time and accel and want the final velocity
T = V/A	<- when you know the final velocity and accel and want time
A = V/T	<- when you know the final velocity and time and want accel

> I\'m also wondering about the maximum velocity of a constant 1G acceleration
> ship.

There isn\'t one. Or rather, the final velocity depends solely on how
long it accerelates. So if it only has fuel to accelerate for 6 hours,
then the final velocity is:
(1 g = 10 m/s^2, 1 hour = 3600 s)

V = A * T
V = 10 * 6 * 3600
V = 216000

So it\'d get to 216 km/s.

Remember, the ship *can\'t* exit jump any closer than 100 diameters from
the planet. If the results would have it exit closer, then it exits at
the 100 diameter limit instead, but the time of exit doesn\'t change.

Again, no can do. You can\'t get closer than 100 diameters in jump.

The simplest "unanticipated" use for it will be as a "coating" on

Uhhh,  he was a Field Marshall in the Phillipine Army until recalled to
active duty (after Pearl Harbor I believe).  He had been retired from the
U.S. Army for over 4 years.  He got no supplies, no reinforcements, and his
delaying actions are credited with giving the U.S. at a minimum of 6 months
to get their war machine in gear.  Adm. Yamamoto spent almost 3 months
looking for him and has been quoted as saying MacArthur would be his worst
nightmare to face because of his knowledge of the Pacific rim.  The "Dougout
Doug" title came in Korea not WWII.  There are numerous accounts of
MacArthur walking up to and beyond the "safe lines" to personnally inspect
conditions on the ground.  Several times he came under direct fire from
snipers and on one of these occassions (while everyone else was ducking and
covering) calmly walked back toward his HQ calling his officers to him to
explain some fine point that he had noticed.  These are documented by a
number of eye witnesses.  He was born in 1880 and during the 2nd WW he would
have been 61-65 years old.  I bring this up for your the next point about
Korea and the "Dougout Doug" moniker.

I did and all I can say about some of these is, looking back from 50 years
away is an easy thing to do.  We have no way of knowing what motivated
everything that he did.  I also remind you that I started this by saying
that I would rather have served under MacArthur rather than  others is due
to my personal desire to live through the war and the odds were much better
with him.  I never said he didn\'t make mistakes just fewer of them.

Funny, IF it had failed it would have been a blundering old man making
stupid mistakes.  As it is, historians consider it to be one of the more
brilliant moves ever made by any general (depending of course on who you
read and how they skew their information, as you obviously believe that mine
is.)

Don\'t disagree with this at all.  Totally blew that one as far as I\'m
concerned.  Damn shame too because he actually had the war won (IMO).  Could
it have been faulty intelligence, who knows, but having served in the
Military Intelligence Branch for more than 20 years I certainly belive its a
possibility.

Getting a little testy aren\'t we.  He was barely in charge in the
Phillipines when they fell (read my comment above) and he WAS fired over
Korea.

 Now to expand "Dugout Doug",  he was 70 years old when he went to Korea and
had been in the director\'s chair in Japan for almost 5 years.  He had
multiple ailments some of which were arthritis in his hips and knees and
failing eyesight.  Here he was a 5 star general taking orders from a man
that was a Captain when he was a Brigidier (1918).  I believe that he
reacted to Truman poorly and SHOULD have taken his orders from the
Commander-In-Chief of the armed forces.  Again, who\'s to say what was on his
mind at that time, was he tired of babying a bunch of politicians when he
felt his duty was to rectify what he himself admitted was a gross error in
judgement (the Chinese response).  Did he feel that Washington was not
trying to win the war and that ALL of his training insisted that winning was
the only choice?  Man I don\'t know but I certainly believe that all in all
he WAS and excellent military leader, a half way decent tactician and
obviously a bueracrat with outstanding accomplishments.

 Do I think of Cleon in the same light as MacArthur, hmm tough question to
answer.  I suppose I do as their lives seem to be in some strange way on a
parrallel course.  God, I\'m sorry for rambling on and I\'ll stop now and put
the target back on my chest.

	A displacement ton has always been, since CT, the volume of one
metric ton (1,000kg) of liquid hydrogen. If you don\'t start quibbling
about exactly what temperature, that\'s about 14 cubic meters or
kiloliters. And CT was originally created without any deckplans or
layouts. People noticed that, using the standard 1.5m squares, two
squares at a height of 3m was 13.5 kl, fairly close to 14, and used
that for drawing up deckplans. MT simply made it explicit by
redefining the disp ton as 13.5kl. FF&S returned to the origins and
put it back to 14 kl, but recognized that it would be nice to have it
be an even number of squares for simple deckplan drawing. Since the
TNE grid was 2m instead of 1.5, all that was necessary was to bump
the ceiling from 3m to 3.5m

	the same is true with humans or dogs, e.g. most dogs have some
	anoying missbehavoir, just because this kind of missbehavior is
	rewarded by humans with attention. But lets try to devide the
	concepts behind AI\'s we find in traveller :

	TL:7-9	computer linked systems

		here we\'ll find a lot of "cheaters" starting with Elisa
		up to chess programs, voice recocnisations and expert
		systems. Those systems are at limited scope, and the AI
		is not what common sense would call real intelligence.

	TL:10-12 dynamic linked systems

		large expert systems (like Cyc) are well known, small
		real AIs (neuronal networks) enhance functionality, most
		times for human interactions like voice and image
		recocnisation. But true synaptics are still a problem.

	TL:13-16 holographic linked systems

		Computers allow emulation of large synaptic networks.
		At TL:15 computes becomes "alive" in MT/RefsCompanion
		and at TL:16 the neural network is 50% of the computer.

	TL:17+	synaptic linked systems

		Computers are now not longer silicoid, but grown by
		a geeneered cell. They have real intelligence and
		are imune to virus.

	TL:10-16 AI-Virus enhanced computers

		The cimbeline chip lives as a "parasite" on dynamic
		and holographic systems. The computer only enhances the
		Deyo as storage. The Deyo controls and provides real
		neural intelligence as a silicoid lifeform.

	Problems are well known especialy when breakthroughs occur.
	The 10% synaptic breakthrough of Dover Gabe caused the Shudusham
	Concorde, and the 50% synaptic breakthrough showed problems
	in the Kinunir. I think that quite a lot of free traders preferd
	the old dynamic system over the fancy Tl:16 AI, even if they
	could afford the later, just because the bugs are fixed thousand
	of years ago by Vilani programmers.

	Back to real life :

	Its posible to implement the same number of neurons an ant has
	(10k neurons) on a 4dx33/8MB. Mores law would give us 30 years
	until we can implement the same number of neurons a human has
	(10 terra neurons). But processing power is not the main problem
	with neuronal networks. While its now possible to implement large
	neural networks, training of large networks shows imposible. 
	The larges neuronal networks currently in use are 3 layer kohonen
	networks of 8x8 up to 12x12. Its simple to implement larger networks,
	but training shows impossible. The evolutionary step we needed for
	our brain, would take millions of years using the complete internet
	just to train an ant. Of course we can cheat, and take a look at
	the original to see that walking "intelligence" is build by small
	networks inside the legs. These networks are small enough to train,
	and so we have walking 6 legged machines with neural networks at
	Tl:8, but we still does\'nt have an ant.

	In this case the 50% synaptic at TL:16 could be quite true.

The following is telecoms folklore, it may well be inaccurate.

The first electro-mechanical telephone exchange was invented towards
the beginning of this century by a Mr Strowager (spelling?), An American
undertaker.
It seems that there were two undertaking firms in the area, but his
competitor\'s wife was the local telephone operator and was able to
discover "business opportunities" before there were widely known by
overhearing conversations.
So Strowager built a mechanical device to replace the operator.
:-)
I would imagine that the research by Bell in the 1950\'s is what led
to the electronic, processor controlled electronic and digital exchanges.
These would give the prospect of better billing systems.
The problem is, once you have every woman in the world working 24 hours a
day as switchboard operators, you then need every man in the world to work
out the bills.
Of course, if it wasn\'t for all the children, there\'d be no one left to
make the phone calls :-)

  The original Striker game design sequences _started_ being vehicle portable
at TL 15. MCr 10, 15 tons, 15 KL, six crew, and 250 mw input. Presumably the
six crew are to ensure accurate targeting among other things; they make the
volume requirements high enough to require a dedicated vehicle with serious
armour envelope issues; see an old JTAS (15 or so?) for stats.

  As a number of people have pointed out, there are a number of techs
you can add (or not), but that at a certain point the entire Trav universe
has to be re-written or scrapped. A largely tech independent one is the
production possibilities that would arise with even HG efficiency fusion
power (14 KL ~ 85mw output/TL 9) - you can try it (I have) but no reasonable
model you get is recognizable as Traveller. You can ignore this or re-write
your background (I\'ve tried both, with mixed results).

>Maybe we\'re jaded or something, but am I the only one that thinks Jump
>Drive would totally revolutionize the way we think?

  No. I hope you don\'t think that, either. OC, any change to the Trav
universes Terrans mindset occurred around -2000, or around three millenia
ago. Around 1000 BCE, the use of horses for cavalry mounts was not yet
practical. I doubt that horses are relevent to the working lives of many 
of the TML\'ers.

  The last SF campaign I ran had nothing to do with Traveller except the
determination to model everything as well as I could, without resorting

  Not really. OTOH, I already accept the fact that the species can go to
other stars if we really care to make the effort (sub-light, OC).

  One has to ask what huge changes in most peoples world-views were
occasioned by the discovery of; sea routes to the Far East; the New
World; economical steamliners; railroads; airliners; and, space travel.
Besides the people I game with (and not all of those) and SF literature
fans, I know very few people much care that space travel now exists, and
this in a group that\'s well read, well educated, and comfortable enough
to be able to consider such impracticalities.

IIRC the CT displacement tons was 14 kL, so maybe they were feeling retro.
TNE went to 2m squares for movement and deckplans, and 14 kL fits this much
better than 13.5 kL.

Maybe that should be DGP3 ... Roger Sanger was DGP2 even though
he hasn\'t published anything yet.  Does anyone know if he still
owns it?

To GDW2 I\'d add Willian H Keith (for the artwork).

I was thinking more along the lines of a "manifest destiny" of the stars.

Well, okay...  Not exactly what I was looking for, but an interesting point
anyway.  How many folks in the Traveller universe suspect that Jump is an
artifact, and is it _really_?

The difference being that we could load up an expensive ship for an
extremely long voyage, and possibly never know if it succeeded or not.  The
first interstellar jump would likely be a month or so from the first
crackling J-Space penetration <it crackles IMTU :^) > to the safe return of
the ship.

We\'re not on the same wavelength here.  You just pointed out exactly what I
mean.  Someone wouldn\'t have to consider the impracticalities, because it
wouldn\'t be an impracticality.  When eyes turned to the sky, whether the
brain they belonged to cared about space travel or not, the fact that _we_
could go there would change things entirely.

Of course, the commercialization of space might still get us out there too
(several companies are building a fully commercial launch pad in Florida, I
think.  Initially, it\'ll be used to send satellites into space quickly and
efficiently, moreso than NASA.  There has been talk of space tourism as
well).

[Note:  I am still waiting for my playtest password, so I have not read
whatever Loren Wiseman has already posted on GURPS Traveller character
generation.  What follows is derived from my experiences with both systems.]

I\'ve been thinking about this since Eris posted his reply.  One fundamental
difference between GURPS and Traveller (in all its versions) is the
philosophy behind player-characters.  GURPS sets out to create characters
from heroic literature (even if those characters start out as apparently
ordinary people - e.g. Luke Skywalker).  They are designed and balanced,
complete with dramatic abilities and tragic flaws, to participate in a
narrative structure.  Traveller attempts to model the career progression of
(more-or-less) ordinary people, although people who form a sort of science
fiction "jet set" - the "travellers" of the title - who then have
adventures essentially as part of their job descriptions.

Game-wise, it boils down to this:  newly generated GURPS characters (within
the same campaign) are generally equivalent to one another in capability,
though the specifics usually do vary.  Traveller characters, on the other
hand, vary greatly even within the same campaign, based on the number of
4-year terms they have served before starting play.  This effects not only
numbers of skills, but starting resources (especially starships), rank, and
status.

There are two primary game mechanics in Traveller preventing every group
from turning into the Enterprise crew from Star Trek VI (hyper-skilled,
influential, overweight, and in desperate need of retirement).  The first
is a set of random factors (survival rolls, reenlistment/ continuation
rolls) that artificially terminate the character generation process at some
point.  The second, and more important, is a draconian aging roll, which
begins to erode the character\'s physical attributes beginning at age 38
(around the 5th 4-year term).  It\'s no coincidence that most
player-characters I have seen in 20 years of Traveller campaigns are 30-34
years old, unless the player deliberately continued for a 5th or 6th term
seeking retirement benefits or that last promotion to Captain.

And there\'s the rub:  even if we do come up with an adequate,
career-term-based character generation system for GURPS Traveller, the
GURPS aging system will not provide this counterbalancing force.  Even in
basic GURPS, aging rolls begin at 50 years; higher tech levels can easily
push this to 70 or 90.

The attachmed file is a sample of what I mean. It is not even a draft, but
more of a sketch of a possible solution.  It derives from Traveller: the
New Era, and the notions that GURPS characters do arrive at their initial
statistics through some sort of growth process, and that, within limits, it
is not strictly necessary that all characters have exactly the same
starting point totals.  [The skills listed are from my abbreviated skills
list for GURPS Traveller.  They work just as standard GURPS skills, but
there are only 75 instead of 200+ and the names have been adjusted to
Traveller terminology.  You can safely ignore the specifics, and still get
the ideas I\'m driving at.]

CHARACTER GENERATION

Initial

All characters are initially constructed at age 18 with 120 points, and
at most -5 points in quirks (total: 125 points). 

All skills must come from the Background Skills list, and must be
appropriate to homeworld size, atmosphere, technology, population, and
law unless an Unusual Background is taken as well. No more than 4
points may be allocated to any one skill. 

All innate (inborn) Advantages must also be bought at this time. Other
Advantages may be bought so long as they do not depend on life experience
(eg, Rank, Reputation, Contacts, Tenure).  Racial packages, such as Light-
or Heavy-worlder may be applied if appropriate; racial Disadvantages do not
count against the Disadvantage limit.  

Disadvantages may also be taken to increase points available; indeed,
innate Disadvantages (like Albino) must be taken at this time.  However,
there is an absolute maximum of -25 points in Disadvantages allowed.  Any
time a character equals or exceeds this figure, character generation ends
and the character enters play as is.  Character development also ends if at
any time the character exceeds the "2 point per year of age" limit on
skills; careful management of skill points is necessary.

Background Skills:

Artist
Athletics
Biology
Blade
Bow
Brawling
Chemistry
Computer
Craftsman
Cudgel
Electronics
Fencing
Grav Vehicle
History
Hunting
Languages
Mechanical
Medical
Performer
Persuasion
Pistol
Rifle
Ship\'s Boat
Shotgun
Stealth
Streetwise
Survival
Thrown Weapon
Tracked Vehicle
Vaccsuit
Watercraft
Wheeled Vehicle
Zero-G Combat


Careers

Characters may be further developed, by following various careers.
Each career has prerequisites for entry, rolls for commissioning (if
appropriate) and promotion, a list of available skills, and specific
Advantages that accrue through service.  Most careers also have an
initial skills package (equivalent to military basic training).
Careers are resolved in 4-year increments, called \'terms\', for ease
of management; Grad School and Law School use 2-year \'half-terms\'.
The list of possible careers follows:

College
Grad School [half-term]
Law School [half-term]
Medical School
Military Academy
Naval Academy
Merchant Academy

Army
Marine
Commandos
Navy
Scout
Merchant
Agent
Entertainer
Noble
Rogue
Scholar


Sample Career:  Army

Enlistment roll: none.

Prerequisites:  no uncorrected, debilitating Physical Disadvantages;
ST 10; HT 10.

Commission roll:  automatic for Military or Naval Academy graduates,
College or Merchant Academy honor graduates, Status 2+, Doctors, and
Lawyers. Roll 8 or less on 3d6, once per term; +2 for College or
Merchant Academy graduate, +2 for IQ 13+, +3 initial term.
Commissioned characters are officers, Rank 3, Status 0+.  All other
characters are enlisted.

Promotion roll:  12 or less on 3d6, once per term; automatic for
Status 2+, +1 for HT 12+. +1 Rank for each two promotions; +1 Status
each for Ranks 5 and 8.  Enlisted characters promoted to Rank 3 become
Warrant Officers and receive Status 0, but may not be further promoted
without also receiving a commission.

Initial Skills:  10 points.  Rifle (2 points, minimum Rifle-12),
Grenade Launcher (1 point), Thrown Weapon (1 point), Brawling
(1/2 point), Combat Engineer (1/2 point), Machinegun (1/2 point),
Survival (1/2 point); 2 points in one of Gunnery, Pistol, Plasma Gun,
Rifle, Shotgun, or Submachinegun; 2 points in one of Artillery,
Battledress, Communications, Demolitions, Forward Observer, Grav
Vehicle, Mechanical, Medical, Tracked Vehicle, Vaccsuit, or Wheeled
Vehicle.

Term Skills:  8 points per term (including initial), from:

Administration
Artillery
Athletics
Battledress
Blade
Brawling
Combat Engineer
Communications
Demolitions
Electronics
Forward Observer
Grav Vehicle
Grenade Launcher
Gunnery
Interrogation
Laser
Leader
Machinegun
Mechanical
Medical
Pistol
Plasma Gun
Rifle
Sensors
Ship\'s Boat
Shotgun
Stealth
Submachinegun
Survival
Tactics
Thrown Weapon
Tracked Vehicle
Vaccsuit
Wheeled Vehicle
Zero-G Combat

Secondary Activities: 2 points per term, any skill or advantage.

Advantages:  Military contacts, 2 points per term. Receive Combat
Reflexes at the conclusion of 2d term. If no longer in service when
play begins, Rank becomes Courtesy Rank.

Continuation roll: Roll 17 or less on 3d6; -2 per term.  A failed
continuation rolls may be ignored by accepting -5 points in Physical
or Mental Disadvantages, until the -25 point maximum is reached.

Remember, in physics there is not such thing as being stationary
or in motion in an absolute sense.  Everything moves, or not,
with respect to some reference frame.  As long as jump takes
an ideterminate amount of time, the expected exit point will
either move or be fixed depending on the reference frame.
What makes the most sense, since we know that momentum is
conserved on a jump, that the exit point is fixed with
respect to the entry point.  This does mean that the
point may move with respect to the destination planet
(or whatever) and may mean that ships often end up coming
in out of jump siginficantly more than 100 diameters from
the destination world.

The Barbie\'s Own Particle Accelerator Pistol (an accessory in the Barbie\'s

Well, unless we assume that jumpspace is somehow more 
strongly connected to the realspace near gravity wells (say, stars). 
This way, you enter jumpspace that moves with the star system you\'re 
leaving and exit jumpspace with the same velocity as before, relative 
to jumpspace. Only that jumpspace is moving in a different direction 
now... 

(OTOH, I\'ve avoided that problem IMRHTU by changing jump drives a bit 
- - they only work INSIDE gravity wells, and you keep your velocity 
with respect to the gravity source. Since you can get out of 
jumpspace only near gravity wells, where the "gauntlet" separating J- 
an N-space is weaker, you get out keeping your velocity, but it uses 
the new gravity source as it\'s reference frame now. So, if you enter 
J-space while on an orbit around the central star, you exit it 
orbiting around the new star, even if - relative to one another - 
those stars move with a big velocity difference.)

(Oh, one more thing - I\'m referring to velocity vector here, not 
skalar (sp?) one, of course. )

How well does _Gateway to the Stars_ fit with the standard Traveller
background?

    About as well as one of my campaigns does...but remember I\'m Eris
    the heretic.  ;-> The adventure, and it reads quite a bit like an
    adventure one of us might run if we only had one player, is set in
    the middle of *a* Third Imperium.  Obviously, not *our* 3rd
    Imperium, but pretty close.  The historical background leading up to
    this Imperium are also close, but not quite the same.  All this will
    be a little jarring to strict canonists, but most of us will be able
    to handle the slightly alternative universe we have here.
    
    The K\'kree and Aslan make appearances, and the Droyne are
    prominently mentioned.  The K\'kree are handled completely correctly,
    as far as I can tell, the Aslan are not.  An Aslan *male* is
    portrayed as being employed as a cook in a diner, and we know that\'s
    a little off.  ;-> The Droyne are *known* to be the ancients that
    spread humanity throughout the stars, but completely wiped
    themselves out in a war hundreds of thousands of years ago...close
    but not quite, and not what the run of the mill member of the 3rd
    Imp would know.

How about the technology?

    Jump is about right.  You are stuck in "hyperspace" for 163+/-
    hours, and jumps are measured in parsecs.  The Gateway, a 200 ton
    Far Trader is an old jump 2 ship that gets a little less than that
    on most jumps.  Jumps are handled like hops though space, but you
    still have to get far enough away from a mass to jump or you risk
    the sorts of mishaps we are familiar with.
    
    Maneuver isn\'t really mentioned, but the impression is that
    Tplate-like drives based on gravity are the new tech, and reaction
    drives are well known, but old tech.  
    
    It\'s mentioned that without jump it would take 7,000 years to get
    from the system on the edge of the Imperium to its core.  Later when
    the ship is in deep space preparing for it\'s next jump, it is
    mentioned that if they have to use maneuver drives it will be at
    least 5 years to the nearest system. 
    
    Weaponry was familiar, but again a little off center.  On the
    Gateway are a pair of Meson cannon.  Its defense are meson shields.
    There is no mention of paw or shipboard lasers.  Personal weapons
    include laser pistols and rifles, without bulky powerpacks, but
    projectile weapons are more common and in many ways more effective.
    Thudd and Body pistols are used.  Blades are even more evident,
    though NOT long blades, spring and plastic knives, glue on and
    bioengineered blade-fingernails..that sort of thing.
    
    Electronics is beyond current RW-Earth levels, but not much.  Chris
    wouldn\'t be pleased.  ;-> The most prominent electronic device was a
    Universal ID...did you guys know this book was coming out two weeks
    ago when you were talking about it?
    
    Gravitics are small, common and used a lot.  Statis fields are
    mentioned as being used to secure cargo in the hold.
    
How about the story?

    Typical action adventure type novel, not great, not awful..IMO.  A
    Rouge looking for a low profile stumbles into more than he bargained
    for and adventures ensue.
    
Is it worth the read?

    For a Traveller fan, yes, I think so.  Not for the story, it\'s not
    great literature.  Not for the setting, unless you are willing to
    work in an alternate universe...I have to withhold some things here,
    but there are some adventure hooks in there that make it worthwhile
    as a source of adventure ideas.  I say take a look, because it has
    Mark Miller\'s Traveller on the cover, and if it sells well it will
    encourage Pocket Books to continue with the series...and this *is*
    the first of what should be a series, and because it just might
    bring us some of that "new blood" we\'ve been talking about.
    
    Final analysis.  This isn\'t great science fiction, but it won\'t run
    potential players off.

Now, what about the How to play Traveller chapter in the back?

    It is very simplistic.  Just character creation of the six
    characteristics, no skills, no careers.  GM adjucates based on
    characteristics and +/- to 2d6 rolls as he see fit.

Although I posted my theory earlier, I got NO responses, so I\'ll just
re-mention the applicable theory.

THEORY:
Jumpspace velocity is inversely proportional to gravity.  Of the 7 days
spent in jumpspace, most of it comes from leaving and entering the
microgravity around star systems.  In the vast distance between stars,
velocity (in J-space) approaches infinity and thus takes ~zero  time.  Thus
a jump 1 takes the same time as a jump 6 because the 5 parsec difference is
covered at infinite velocity. I also note that J-space has no inertia
(otherwise crews and even the ship would be shreaded by that acceleration)
thus realspace inertia/velocity is conserved.

How does this relate to 100 diameter limit?  Outside that limit you\'re going
ludicrously fast.  Although you could drop out of J-space, its like blindly
jumping out of a speeding car, you just don\'t know how far away you\'ll end
up.  Gravity wells are navigational aids and just about the only thing you
can sense in J-space.

Actually, since GURPS Traveller will have conversion notes, you
could, if push comes to shove, just use Traveller rules to
generate characters and then convert them.

However, those who want to have random generation and are leary
of what conversion might introduce might welcome a system like
yours...

Note: I have found that characters near 100 point work well
for Traveller.  Since you will be adding more points, I would
say that intial construction with 75 might be better.

  To us it\'s miraculous, even though i) we\'re probably part of a very small
proportion of the planets inhabitants who give a damn, and ii) it is really
possible (theoretically) already for humans to colonize parts of the system
and then beyond.

  We don\'t know what effect Jump tech had on Terrans 3000 years before the
Classic Trav milieu; the effect on M:1100 citizens is, I suggest, minimal.

  Meant as a joke. i) I treat it as a natural physical phenomenon. ii) There\'s
only one person who can say for sure.

  Yes, but for most us the availability of such a capability would be less
than that represented by the Space Shuttle. By the time that availability
was noticeably widespread it might have ceased to be revolutionary, and
would have less importance in the lives of most people than boosters to
deliver fractional orbit payloads have represented for much of this century.

  I\'m suggesting that to most people these innovations are irrelevent,
as the use of these capabilities is not economical for them. To the people
who do use them - provided that change itself is not a revolutionary concept
- - the novelty will be transitory and not epoch making in their minds (e.g.,
airliners, not to say that some pundits at the time wouldn\'t have ascribed
more importance to their effects).

  Specifically, it\'s quite possible that very few 21st century Terrans cared
very much (thus, the possibility arises that major social effects could
include a radical divergence of cultural types a la Niven, but that\'s
another genre entirely) and the others mostly got along with business.
Of course, given personnel attrition in long naval campaigns some people
might care more, as a Jump-capable warship assignment in wartime becomes
a statistically near certain death sentence.

  An arms race (space naval race, specifically) would be much faster, if
hard on the average worker supporting the expense. Von Braun wanted to
build space stations and moon shuttles; war rockets was merely a career
side-line, albeit one that he didn\'t balk at sufficiently.

  True. However, removing potential competitors from the pond can make
for exceedingly attractive politics. Also, even in a provably positive
sum game, some players may have policy needs in which pure maximization
of their own position is of overwhelming importance.

  What? I thought that the Cr 1000 per Dt was pretty much economically
indicated as accurate per Jump for J-2 or 3 vessels. Seeings as that\'s
potentially (14 KL @ 3t/KL = ~40 tonnes, of ore, for example) from
door to door, virtually (e.g., pithead to smelter), it seems to be pretty
cheap too.

  I didn\'t mind the cynicism, but the unlikelihood of eventual victims
not catching on bothered me. Logically, the contact school methods could
produce an equilibrium situation where the Imperium hits a border past
which _everyone_ has realized that the 3I is _bad_, and would do everything
possible to stop it. Even if conquest were still possibel, consolidation
would be extremely time-consuming - centuries long, quite possibly.

  Or the contact/assimilation model would have to change, but the resistance
would still be disproportionate due to truly immense distrust.

  Quite true. But you can create delightfully dependent (and thus compliant)

to their Finance Ministry.

Seriously, while I prefer GURPS-style chargen, this is an excellent idea and

The concept is that you can mate several disks together.  Theoretically an unlimited

using modular jacks, connections are very fast. Initial lockdown is immediate, fuel,

This sounds pretty complex, with multiple computers, jump drives and power
systems all working in sync. If you\'ve got ten jump ships linked together, if time
between coil activation and jump varies by milliseconds and you can\'t compensate
properly you\'ll have jump catastrophes, misjumps, etc. Even if a several-second
variation in jump entry time only happened 1% of the time on an individual ship,
it would kill a stack of 10 ships once every ten jumps.

Your idea that TL will be the limiting factor is probably accurate...I\'d say this
would be impossible at TL 9, adding one possible module per TL over that - 
unless you wanted to make it a multiplier of some sort (do you want five or
six modules or do you want a dozen?). Also, I\'d make the important TL be
the Jump Drive TL, not the computer TL, as precise control of jump field
would be more important than computer capability - we control nanosecond
complex processes now.

The difference between theory and reality is pretty big.  If NASA or some

think anyone would look up the moon the same way again?

I\'m not sure I agree with this sentiment.  The effect of jet airliners is
profound even to those who can\'t afford to fly in them.  Look at the term
"jet set", which is still a term in common usage to refer to those whose
lifestyles afford them the luxury.  The term isn\'t as popular as it was
throughout the 1960s and 1970s, but it still persists.

I\'m not talking about direct effect here.  I\'m talking a shift in the way
people feel.  The emergence of efficient air travel in the 1930s had a
definite effect on the way people thought, despite the fact that very few
people could afford it.  The cultural record from the two-fisted adventure
pulps where Doc Savage would fly off to, say Germany, and then, say the
heart of South America indicates that there was a very definite shift. 
Further, the popularity of the mysteries of Africa and Asia during this
same period I think further indicates the kind of thing I\'m talking about.

Valid point.  I disagree though, but I can only do so theoretically because
I haven\'t done enough looking into the cultural effects of efficient air
travel.

No, I\'m talking here about a more fundamental change.  The knowledge that
stars are places as opposed to lights in the sky.  We can theoretically
look at these lights and imagine alien worlds orbiting different suns
because we\'re fans of science-fiction.  However, the truth of the matter
is, until some method of reaching them is developed that allows us to visit
them they just remain lights in the sky.

I\'m not sure I can accurately describe what I mean.

Possibly.  We "know" that conflict breeds better technology and opens new
vistas, but keep in mind that commercialization is another form of warfare.
 It\'s just (usually) not as violent.

Hmmmm... Lessee... not that I\'ve thought about it a whole lot, but...

Earth goes into space. The Terrans meet the Vilani. Much fighting 
ensues.

The beginnings of the Second Imperium do not look like the 3I.

The two major things I\'ve really thought through are:

 - really small, cramped ships for the Terrans. Any setting can
   be made cooler just by letting the players know that their
   characters are really, really cramped. "Das Boot" in space.
   In contrast, of course, the Vilani are building things like
   the Titanic in space.

 - The Terrans, in their infinite wisdom, decide that they need to
   rule the conqured "Empire of the Stars" in person. Thus, each
   and every officer in the Terran Navy is sent out to look after
   some bit of Vilani space, be it a sector, system, planet, starport
   or gas station. Of course, confusion reigns and mixups occasionally
   occur. Like when the PCs, a group of wet-behind-the-ears
   Lieutentants, get sent to take charge of a Vilani highport.
   Whoops.

Besides that, there are the Vilani-Terran issues, where Terrans have to
try to figure out why the Vilani are so wierd (well, from a Terran
POV, you get what I mean), and, of course, the military issues - I doubt
that the fighting ever really ended during the Rule of Man - it just
went underground and took the form of skirmshes, local battles,
terrorism, that sort of thing.

Again, I haven\'t though about it a heck of a lot, but there are a lot
of cool ideas to be explored. Someone should spec it out for a source
book.

Quick, what\'s the _exact_ distance, in cm, to that Trepida flying by over
there!  If your Mk1 eyball can tell me that, your name\'s Steve Austin.
Such a low power meson gun is going to depend even more on accurate
targeting than a higher power one, since the radius of meson decay varies
with the power, hence placing the blast _within_ a target depends on
knowing exactly _where_ that target is. With eyeball targetting you\'re
going to need ranging shots and a good continuous view of the target. 

Of course, as I posted earlier, with a LOS weapon like this, small arms
rangefinders will work, but they\'re what will limit the range.

Of course, feeding proper coordinates into the gun from somewhere _will_
make it an \'indirect\' fire weapon. It\'s still a direct fire weapon, as
you\'re aiming _at_ the target in a direct line, it just ignores the fact
that you can\'t _see_ the target through that hill over there.

Actually, with a decent portable sensor suite spread out from a secure
location, this little MP meson gun becomes a much more viable squad
support weapon, just not the munchkin-ish \'Big Guns! We need BIG GUNS!\'
kinda toy.

An argument could be made that Virus is the end result of a tech-17
research project gone wrong.  After all, there\'s a lot of worlds at
tech-16 in the Massilia and Core area, and a couple of other AI
research projects mentioned (that automatic starport wasn\'t that far
away in Core, as I recall).

You could also argue that truly perfected tech-17 AI computers aren\'t
necessarily immune to Virus, but that they are extremely effective in
electronic combat with infected equipment.  

Then again, has anyone else noticed just how hazardous that tech-17
research projects are when mishandled (Darrian Star Trigger, AI Virus,
etc.)?

I\'m thinking square of the TL jump capacity of the worst linkage.  That qualifies a jump

Less expensive than letting a defensive fleet convert lots of

If you can fill 20-30% of your ship with fuel, you\'ve got the reaction

Unless, of course, the limiting factor was time.

Speaking of Maginot Line, didn\'t the Germans just go around it?

Its the old square cube law.  You can defend a point with a line in 2
dimensions.  But you need an area when you jump to 3 dimensions.  If you
concider J-space as a 4th dimension, you need to defend the whole volume.
We\'re talking Dyson spheres here.

I can tell from your response that you didn\'t actually read most of what I

This statement is completely false. The business plan _was_ to create
stable, long-run trading partners. Just as you advocate.

Which is what Marc said he was, more or less.

No less 1-dimensional than some idealistic struck fairy-tale hero. Just a
different dimension.

>You have described a whole system for killing off political
>leaders, debasing currencies, extracting all mineral wealth, etc.
Only in the first stages. And only political leaders who would not support
Imperium, currencies that posed a threat of economic dependence, and
minerals for the same reason. You are ignoring completely the development
stages and just focusing on the first part.

>First off, why is there this assumption that all worlds will

If they aren\'t then you skip the first several steps.

Of course not. It doesn\'t say you have to follow the plan from step one for
every world.

>Besides, I thought there was extensive canon to support a very

In the later Imperium, yes. But that just wouldn\'t work in Milieu:0.

>Second, there are plenty of things that can be traded to these
>worlds in exchange for their mineral wealth
Bzzzt. Wrong. Read it again. It says very explicitly that trade is limited
by _volume_. Stages are governed by what sort of volume of trade has been
built up. In the first stages it is assuming that you have 50t of cargo
going to and from the world twice per _year_. You can\'t shift all that
extra high-tech stuff you suggest in that small a space. In a progressive,
expanding, conquest of space you are always going to have high-volume trade
to those nearest the border, and very low volume as you move beyond that.
As the border expands, the volume of trade increases. All the worthwhile
things you mention are certainly items for trade, when they have enough
volume to support it.

>As for the gold-standard somehow being more stable or viable then
>a freely floating currency, this is really something of a myth.
It isn\'t so much that, but that the gold itself could be used by the world
to buy stuff (like mercenaries) in an uncontrolled way. Really anything
that is small, highly valuable, and has a recognised, easily tradable
(stable) value in the external market is a target for depletion. In
low-volume trading, it is just about the only thing worthwhile shipping
out, anyway.

>You seem to have the IMO mistaken notion that war builds
>infrastructure.  In fact, it destroys it in huge volumes.
I agree completely. Ancient infrastructure, though, is all but useless.
England, for example, suffered no massive devastation to its roads and
factories as a result of WWII. So in a post-war era they just sort of
limped along with what they had. Germany, on the other hand, got to rebuild
everything with the latest there was to offer. They came out a hell of a
lot stronger.
Similarly, by controlling a short war, the economic planners
(manipulators?) of the Imperium can clean out all the old stuff that would
otherwise hold them back from making modern, exportable items.

>War is the fastest way to reduce a people to poverty ever devised.
Perfect group for Imperial infrastructure development loans and grants.
(Believe me, Ireland has made a bomb from these grants in the European
Community!)

>Your point that developing infrastructure and the workforce for

>point.
Like I said, we are in agreeement on most things.

>Why not got straight to this without first trashing the planet
>with wars, coups, financial chaos, etc.
Because people won\'t invest in improvement unless they have to. Governments
are unlikely to put themselves in massive foriegn debt (or take massive
foriegn aid) to build things up to a level that they can\'t really see as
necessary. They are far more interested in petty little tit-for-tat
economic or political spats with their neighbours. This is the human
condition. Look at the history of Europe. Ireland, in particular, _always_
fought itself in preference to others. It wasn\'t till an outside Empire
came in (the English) that any sort of unity developed.

>As I\'ve explained above, worlds will want to move to a currency
>backed by the IC on their own because the IC will be more widely demanded

>base one\'s currency on.
Once they move to that mode of thinking. But if the Imperium had to wait
for them to come to this conclusion it would be dead an buried. Cleon\'s
Empire needs _fast_ expansion. Otherwise they are stuck with the
incremental growth that plagued the Sylean Confederation. The only way to
achieve this is to make their decisions for them and give them a path of no
choice.

>Unless you are dealing with a totally xenophobic world that
>refuses to see the benefits of interstellar trade, they\'ll want to open
>their doors regardless.
You haven\'t followed European Community development much, have you. The
Imperium needs these worlds far more than those worlds think they need the
Imperium.

>Then they have the choice of remaining isolated or joining the
>interstellar community through the 3I.
But they\'ve been isolated for their entire living history. Their
politicians, always a conservative lot, will see no great detraction in
remaining so, or taking small steps forward. This does not meet Cleon\'s
timetable.

You got the order a little wrong here. The Imperium trades low-volume,
high-wealth goods to any petty world-leaders for items of personal power.
These later demand more, which the imperium gives as their volume of trade
increases (funded by previous exchanges). The Imperium refrains from
selling armaments (dispite their desire for such) since it will mean war
until they have reached the point where the Imperium can control that war.
Then then give them the stuff to have a quick, war and sell them the
orbital information so as to allow specific military targets to be struck.
When the winner is more or less clear they further allow them to hire in
high-tech mercenaries. They go and perform the coup-de-grace on the upper
echelon of all the enemies.
IF the winner shows further militant tendencies they support a coup to
depose them and replace the world-government with a more sensable leaders.
They then supply massive loads/aid to help them build their infrastructure
up to modern levels so they can, finally, produce goods that can be traded
on the export market.

>I don\'t think wars ever kill-off the gung-ho types,
The do if conducted as I suggest above.

>look at the kind of regimes this created when the US and French tried this
They didn\'t have quite the tech level difference, nor the economic support,
nor the lack of internal opposition (in the Outback, anyway) that Cleon\'s
empire has.

Scott writes:

The directives during the early stages are to just deal with the autocrats
directly. There is no general popular image of the Imperium until the
rebuilding stage.

_Ultimately_ the whole contact procedure can be seen as good. It raises the
standards of living, brings world peace, a beneficient government,
interstellar protection and so forth to a whole world of people. So a few
petty dictators and military types get killed. A small price to pay.
It isn\'t that difficult to rationalise even for someone very honour-bound.

>With this kind of history, anyone who hears about the Imperium is going to
>know that the 3I is the enemy.
From an outside perspective, the Imperial involvement in the early stages
is not high profile. The messy bits only last a few years, anyway. After
that you have the "official" history of "Oh, look, the Imperium came and
helped us clean up our world, gave us indoor plumbing and brough economic
stability and wealth." Astute observers will likely consider more the loss
of sovernity. If they are petty dictators they are likely to want to buy
guns to deal with it, sending themselves right along that path. If they
have a stable world government then the Imperium can skip the early steps
and get right down to business.

>Destroying a government you helped put in place, though, is a terrible
>idea, as nobody trusts you again to help them, or even contact them.
But that is just it, the Imperium just keeps helping whatever government
the _people_ have chosen. From the outside anyway. They are only going to
want to replace dictator if they aren\'t popular. The result is that the
Imperium is supporting the (media manipuilated) will of the people. Good
PR, not bad PR.

>As a result, economic self interest would indicate playing as straight
>as needed to keep warfare from breaking out on the frontier, and
>revolution in the interior.
I hope I\'ve clarified that the Imperium only involves itself publically in
positive efforts. The view from the outside is an expanding wave of worlds
with much improved economies and wealth, at the expense of some
self-government. The Plan also produces demilitarised worlds. Warfare and
revolution are rather unlikely as long as the people have their bread and
circuses. Given the boost in propserity for the average individual of these
planets their politicians are going to be popular people.

>Consider - from the point of view of the locals, the first actions in the
>ZSC will most likely cause a worldwide depression by undermining the
>currency, the manufacturing, and the social structures
Again, the ZSC calls for discretion at this point. There is really no
popular view of the Imperium. Rather it is their own dictators who cause
this, which the Imperium gallantly comes and rescues them from.

>Considering the present situation on Earth.   Would it work to tell us

Given my present, personal experience of the European Community. No. Given
the sort of problems we\'ve had just trying to implement a Single European
Currency I shudder to think the effort to come up with a Single World
Currency!

>Would it work better to skulk behind the scenes, and engineer the

>credits and dependence on Imperial machinery?
[Who says it isn\'t happening already. <slap!> Sorry, too much X-Files.]
The latter I think is the only way to get people to move to your agenda on
any sort of efficient timescale.

>In my mind, trying to get every last credit from the planet is bad
business,
I am in complete agreement. In the early point of the plan you are
exporting more wealth than you are importing. In the mid-point of the plan
you are importing more wealth than you are exporting. In the end-game of
the plan they are integrated and part of the economy and economic balance
is what is strived for.

>My reading of M0 differs from yours.
Probably because most people get bored and only skim over the last parts of
the plan. The ones that have all the developmental stuff in them. Also I\'m
going for memory of what I submitted, rather than what came out the other
end. I\'ve never done a tight cross-check to see what got lost in the
hurried editing. [Insert standard IG author disclaimer about tight
deadlines, etc, etc. Yawn.]

>Instead, allow those who have the material wealth to use it to buy off
>planet goods.  This will accomplish the same end, but the different
>reason means that you are more likely to get the effect you want.
I\'m not sure you can make this work to the needed timetable. Yes, this is
certainly viable on worlds that already have a good, enlightened economic
setup. The early stages can be skipped then. My vision of the Outback,
though, is closer to the TNE version of the Wilds. Mostly oppressive,
balkanised, or primitive regimes.

>The primary rule was that technology which would
>completely destabilize the realm was in general not imported,
I like your trade codes idea. That is generally how I envision the later
Imperium working. The problem with the above is that frequently you need
technology that has the potential to destablise the realm  to produce
viable exports.

>We may be more in agreement than I thought.  Why not have the engines of
>creation spring into being, though, early in the M0 period, rather than
>after.
I hope the above clarifies that we are, as I beleive, close. Your quoted
text from Irurk is precisely what I envisage from a world in the later
stages fo the plan. Wish it could have been in the book.
The plan is dated to Year-0. Which is why it is called the ZSC, not the
ISC. It is persented as having been taught in the Z. Merchant Academy. The
declaration of Empire would doubtless put a different slant on things and
begin moving them toward the idealism you are seeking.

>I have read that section as propaganda by people who did not agree,
>based on the relatively small number of worlds where it did happen.
Another reading, fitting in with how it is presented, could be that it is
an Academic view as taught by arm-chair economic theorists in the Z.
Merchant Academy on Sylea.



You can choose to believe that it is all bogus and won\'t work if you desire
to. But it is consistent and self-supportive in the context given. You can
just as easily choose to believe it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A scientist in New York has applied for a patent
on a process for making creatures that would be part human and part
animal, the Washington Post reported Thursday.

It said Stuart Newman, a cellular biologist at New York Medical Center
in Valhalla, did not want to make the creatures -- but wanted to stop
anyone else from making them.
<snip>
There are patents on such creatures, known as chimeras. What message
Newman is worried about is a technique for growing a chimera from human
and animal embryo cells.

His technique, described in the science journal Nature, would involve
mixing human cells with the cells of an animal -- perhaps a chimpanzee,
which is closely related genetically.

Skills
Most Traveller skills map directly to one or more GURPS skills. For example, Guns in Traveller maps to either Guns, Gunnery or Beam Weapons.

In some cases, a Traveller skill also acts as an equivalent in other skills; for example, Computers can also act as Robot Ops-1. I usually list both skills under the GURPS listing.
Computer Operations in GURPS refers to actually operating the computer.  Electronics Operation (Computers) is a more sophisticated version of this skill, including hardware expertise and so on. A typical sysop would have Electronics Operation (Computers) at a high skill level.

Advantages and Disadvantages
Status
Characters can have status on a local level, or as a result of being in the Imperial Nobility.  In general, local status will never go above a level of 4 or 5.  An Imperial Knight would be Status 3, while anyone of Imperial Rank has a status of at least a 4.

Military Rank
Military rank applies to active military officers.  Characters who are in the reserves can purchase rank for 1/3 of normal cost, but could be called up for duty at any time.

Characters presently servicing in the military should purchase a Duty ‹ they must obey the orders of their superior officers.  Hazardous Duty is reasonably for characters at wartime.  Imperial commandos may always purchase a hazardous duty.

There are rank listings for each service later on in this document.

Patrons
Patrons are common in the Traveller universe; Imperial Nobles, merchants, former military officers, and the like.

Reputations
The Traveller universe has always been about characters with real backgrounds ‹ experiences in one of the military services, or perhaps as a merchant.  In addition to the skills one learns, one also may acquire reputations.  Military characters who have acquired medals for their actions should purchase these as improved reputations:

Starburst for Extreme Heroism (+4 Reaction)
Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry (+2 Reaction)
Meritorius Conduct Under Fire (+1 Reaction)

In addition, a recipient of medals may also have gained status, especially if they were knighted.



Common Skills
Most characters pick up a few basic skills during their youth or in their first years in a particular career.  For example, most characters will learn to pilot a vehicle, which translates to Drive (Ground Vehicle) at lower tech levels, and Pilot (Grav Vehicle) for characters from higher tech worlds.  In addition, most characters from high tech worlds will have at least a half-point in Computer Operation.  Characters from vacuum worlds should have at least a couple of points in Vacc Suit skill.  Characters from careers that deal with starships should have at least a half point in Vacc Suit.

Other examples are entirely possible.  For example, on a colony world with many predators, characters may have learned Guns skill at an early age.  (e.g. Deathworld by Harry Harrison).



Navy
Naval characters have served in one of three different types of fleets.
Planetary fleets are based around large population centers, as most other worlds cannot afford their own personal navies.  While small, these navies usually have a proud tradition.  Most planetary fleets are composed of system defense boats and other non-jump capable ships, but planets with larger navies will also have a few interstellar ships.

Subsector fleets are where most characters serve.  These navies perform customs inspections and watch for invasions or piracy.  In war, subsector fleets are often used to reinforce the imperial fleets.

Finally, the Imperial Fleet is the most prestigious place to serve in the Imperial Forces.  The Imperial Navy has rigorous requirements, and few are accepted into service.  Imperial naval units are generally built and maintained using the best technology available in the Imperium.

All of the naval services are fairly selective in who they allow into their ranks.  This is especially true of Officers; while the Navies require enough personnel to fill the enlisted ranks, they are extremely selective about who becomes a Naval Officer.  Most Naval Officers come from academies, but enlisted personnel with the correct breeding (or the right connections) can also be commissioned.  

Naval captains or admirals wield vast amounts of power, both literally (in the case of starships), and politically.  Even after retirement, an Imperial Captain or Admiral has the connections and political clout to make deals and influence people.

*****In Traveller, it was difficult to receive a commission without a high Soc.  It was impossible to get into naval academies without a high Soc.  However, if you stayed in the career long enough, you probably received a number of bonuses to Soc ‹ this was particularly true for Captains and Admirals, who could receive the bonuses as part of their benefits.*****
 
Naval Academy
Naval Academies are for the best and brightest individuals in Imperial society. Many current and former members of the Navy sit on the review board that decides who will be admitted into the academy.  In reality, only individuals with the "proper breeding" are allowed into the Academy.  Even that is often not enough due to the difficult tests that candidates are required to complete.

A Naval Graduate receives a rigorous education in the arts and sciences, with specific attention placed on military history and the technical sciences, math, and skills practical to their career.  Part of the student¹s time is spent on board ship, as a midshipman, learning the difficulties of command from existing Naval officers.  *****Improve IQ, engineering, mechanical and electronics skills, vacc suites, astrogation*****

Students who survive the academy are commissioned as officers and placed into service. Those who graduate with honors often choose to attend flight or medical schools.  Naval pilots are perhaps the most prestigious position one can have in the Navy.  

*****Flight school graduates should have extensive skills in astrogation and piloting, while those who graduate from Medical school should take Electronics Ops (Medical) and other medical skills at a very high level. *****

Naval Life
The Navy encourages their personnel to "expand their own horizons" and to explore their potential.  Often this encouragement is subtle, when an Officer occasionally actually notices one of the Navy enlisted personnel with the proper skills to go places.  This encouragement is less frequent for those from local social ranks, except for the most extraordinary of individuals.

Petty Officers and Officers tend to have better access to training resources; officer or POs with 20 years of experience tend to have very broad educations.

Navy Life skills: Brawling, Carousing, Gambling, Vacc Suit

Shipboard Duties: Any character on board a ship is likely to learn some of these skills:   Gambling, Hand to Hand combat (formal training or brawling), Mechanic, Pilot (Small Boat), Zero-G Environment, Electronics Operations (Communications), Administration

Shore Duties: Ground or Grav Vehicle skills, Forward Observer, Savoir Faire, Fast Talk, Psychology, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Xenology, Battle Dress

Petty Officers: Blade Combat, Gun Combat, First Aid or Medical Skills, Teaching, Savoir Faire, Fast Talk, Psychology, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Xenology

Staff Officers are Officers serving in a non-Command role: Computer Ops or Programming, Electronics, Science skills, Ship Tactics and Fleet Tactics.  Tactics and Strategy are particularly important for higher ranking officers.

Command Officers are officers serving in a command role -- the Captain or XO of a ship, for example.  Common skills are Piloting (Starship or Ship¹s boat), Leadership, and Ship Tactics.  In addition, characters placed frequently in command ranks tend to gather personal power and increases of social stature. More than any other career path, a high rank and command rank rapidly give an increase in social status.

Branch Skills
Most naval characters are assigned to a particular branch when they enlist and that¹s the branch that they stay in.  Most Noble families and other families with a lot of pull can generally get their child assigned to a branch of their choice.  Most people never leave their branch unless they received special cross training in another branch.

Crew/Line: This is a generalized duty branch onboard ship.  Common skills include Mechanic, Electronics, Gun Combat, Astrogation, and Electronic Ops (Computers) as well as Computer Programming.

Flight: Some members of the flight branch are graduates of a specialized flight school.  These are generally the cream of the crop (usually requiring high marks at the Naval Academy).  Pilot (Small craft or starship) is emphasised, but other skills include: Administration, Electronics Ops (Communications or Sensors), Astrogation, and Mechanic (Maneuver or Jump drives).

Gunnery: Forward Observer, Gun and Gunner skills, Electronics Ops (Sensors and Computers), and (rarely), Battle Dress, Combat Engineering, Demolitions, Zero G Environ,Stealth, High G Environmental tolerance, Grav Belt and so on.

Engineering: Mechanical and Electronics skills of all kinds are emphasized, but especially skills related to ship¹s drives.

Medical: Graduates of one of the medical schools are are automatically enrolled here.  In addition to learning other medical skills, Administration, Electronics Ops (Medical and Computer), Electronics (Computers) and (rarely) more extensive training in other forms of electronics gear.

Technical:Like the engineering branch, but no training in ships drives, and more emphasis on other kinds of electronics.


Special Duties

Special duties are rare, but can allow enlisted personnel that break to become an Officer, and can also provide extensive training outside one¹s branch.

Enlisted

Cross training is basic training in another branch¹s primary skills, and also allows that person to elect to change branches at the end of a 4-year term.

Specialist schools give advanced training in Mechanics, Electronics and engineering disciplines.  In addition, educated characters may be able to take additional classes in the arts and sciences, medical skills, computer programming, Savoir Faire, Fast Talk, Psychology, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Xenology, and most space skills.

Gunnery school gives extensive training in ship¹s gunnery of all types.
Engineering School will usually train in Electronics and Mechanical skills across the board. 

OCS makes an enlisted man an officer in their current branch or one that they have crosstrained in.

Officers
Intelligence School: Intelligence school graduates learn a variety of skills, including forgery, gun combat, interpersonal skills, Streetwise, Interrogation and Intelligence Analysis.  Many officers trained by an intelligence school are pulled from normal duty and made into dedicated Naval agents.

Naval Attaches learn a lot about the workings of the empire and are often placed on the "fast track" towards a command position, often increasing in rank over officers who might be better qualified.  Normally, an officer is expected to fill their their current rank for at least a term before being advanced again.

Naval Aides to an Admiral often can use the Admiral¹s pull to get their pick of assignments.  Like the attache, they often learn the way the empire really works.

Command College assignments give a firm grounding in the latest of naval strategy and tactics, both on a ship and fleet level.  In addition, leadership skills and administrative skills are taught, grooming the character for a command position on a starship.

Staff college assignments give a more rounded set of naval skills, including diplomacy, xenology, fleet tactics and strategy, administration, computers, psychology and detect lies.


Scouts
The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service is a major service within the Imperium, equal in stature to the Imperial Army and the Imperial Navy, although assigned a variety of unique, primarily non-military missions.  Its duties include exploration of the Imperial frontiers, on-going mapping and survery of Imperial territory, and the maintenance of interstellar communications through its express boat network.  

Background
In the last century before the end of the Long Night, the Sylean Federation began its coalescence into a powerful empire A major force in this move into interstellar space was the Sylean Federation Scout Service.  The SFSS was established with two main missions: first, the exploration of neighboring regions for the consequent contact or recontact of their inhabitants; and second, the use of advanced Sylean technology to lure these contacted planets into the growing Federation.

Largely due to the efforts of the Scouts, the Sylean Federation rapidly turned into an empire ‹ the Third Imperium.  The Sylean Federation Scout Service became the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service: the IISS.

With the passage of time, however, the missions of the Scout Service have evolved into different pursuits.  The original assignment of recontact soon turned to one of actual discovery and exploration of new, unknown worlds.  With the maturity of the Imperium, that mission lost importance, and newer ones have taken its place.  In any analysis, the Scout Service is a survivor, changing its missions and evolving its structure in order to maintain its numbers and (some cynically say) its budget.

Scout Service Organization
In order to handle the great diversity of missions assigned to it, the Scout Service is organized into a variety of offices.  These offices are themselves further divided into branches (or sometimes services), each responsible for a specific mission or duty.  The Imperial Scout Service Organization diagram shows the basic structure of the Scout Service with its many offices and branches.  Placed in authority over the several offices is a central command structure (called Headquarters) which provides overall control of the Scout Service.  Because Headquarters controls the operations of the entire Scout Service throughout the Imperium, it is concerned primarily with policy and administrative detail, rather than the accomplishment of specific missions, and is rarely more than a distant office providing instructions and direction to the service.

The offices of the Scout Service are divided into the Bureaucracy (a standard, structured establishment) and the Field (an informally structured group of individuals who accomplish many of the goals of the service.  The Bureaucracy is strict and governed by regulations; the Field is unconventional and flexible.

Because some of the missions of the Scout Service are best handled by the individualistic type of person, the overall structure of the Scouts allows their inclusion in the service.  Three offices in the Scout Service (the Exploration Office, the Communications Office, and the Survey Office) comprise the Field, and are loosely organized without formal rank or position for their members.  Individuals hold temporary positions (such as ship captain, team leader, project head) based on their record and suitability for the job.  These offices make use of the individual Scout without restricting his or her freedom of action.  Where necessary, the Operations Office provides control and direction for these three Field offices.

The remainder of the Scout Service is the more traditionally organized Bureaucracy.  The offices in the Bureaucracy provide the rigidly controlled supervision and structure that is necessary in any large organization.

Offices and Branches
Within the various offices of the Scout Service, the branches are responsible for specific duties which accomplish the missions of the office.

The Administration Office contains the bureaucracy that keeps the IISS functioning smoothly.  Its three branches are: Personnel, Finance, and Procurement.
Personnel is responsible for the service records of Scouts and ex-Scouts, for recruiting, hiring, and retirement, and for personnel transfers between branches.  It manages the careers of the members of the Scout Service.
Finance is responsible for all fiscal matters, including payroll for Scouts (salaries, pensions, bonuses, and other rewards) and payment for goods and services procured for the service.


Creating Scout characters
While the Bureaucracy is much like any other organization, the Field branches of the Scout service offer roles to social misfits and other characters that don¹t exactly fit into the conventional mold of Imperial Society.  This does not mean that they accept psychopaths into their ranks, but they are more likely to take someone who is a bit odd....

Members of the field branch do not have Military Rank or Status; instead, they are assigned roles on a per-mission basis.

The Bureaucracy consists of Administrators and those of "ordinary" rank, the equivalent of enlisted personnel in other services.  Other than the occasional transfer from the field branches, most Bureaucracy members are college graduates, and only some of them become administrators for the Scouts.

All members of the field branch learn Piloting (Starship) in their first year of service, while members of the Bureaucracy are likely to learn other skills, as per the following list:
Detached Duty: Administration
Technical: Computer Programming, Electronics Ops (Computer)
Operations: Leadership
Administration: Administration

Scouts of all sorts are given opportunities to improve themselves, either through education, training and fitness programs.  Outside of their profession, Scouts tend to come in contact with all forms of society.  Most skills learn some experience with weapons and hand to hand combat, along with the occasional vice like Gambling or Carousing.  Scouts also tend to be in excellent physical condition.

Members of the field branch are likely to be exposed to a variety of skills, but the field branch is especially good at training in technical skills (Electronics Operations of all kinds, but especially Sensors, Robotic skills, Electronics, Computer Programming), general education, and also in bringing out natural abilities in its members.  In GURPS, a high IQ makes sense for a scout just because of the variety of experiences that character is likely to have had.

Members of the bureaucracy will typically learn Computer skills, Administration, Streetwise and the like.  Administrators tend to get advanced levels of Administration, additional Scientific experience, Vacc Suit, Savoir Faire, Fast Talk, Psychology, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Xenology, Leadership and other interpersonal skills.

Branch Profiles
The types of skills a scout is likely to learn are dependent on which branch of the scouts they are in.  Scouts in any of the branches are likely to service in the occasional special mission (e.g. First contacts) and wartime scouting.  During the 5th Frontier War, many scouts were pulled from their original duties and assigned to the Navy as couriers, scouting forces and so on.

Wartime and Special missions often bring out the best in individuals, and give characters opportunities to learn just about any kind of skill imaginable.  Common skills include just about any space skill (Astrogation, Mechanics (drives), Piloting, Electronics Ops -Sensors), Outdoor and Animal skills, Savoir Faire, Fast Talk, Psychology, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Xenology.

Exploration Branch characters tend to get a lot of experience piloting vehicles and starships of all kinds, also learning outdoor skills, Leadership, and most space skills, including Mechanic (Drives), Electronic Ops (Sensors), Astrogation and others.

Communications Branch characters are trained extensively in space skills,. Expecially piloting and astrogation.  Because a member of the Communications branch is usually on their own, they are taught a variety of space skills.

Survey Branch characters learn some of the same skills as the exploration branch, but spend more of their time on planet, learning wilderness skills, and skills important to surveying a planet, such as Planetology, Xenobiology and other sciences.

Administrative Branch learn Computer Programming, Administration, Electronics, science and history, along with interpersonally skills such as Savoir Faire, Fast Talk, Psychology, Detect Lies, Diplomacy

Operations branch members learn a variety of vehicular skills, Mechanic (starship drives), Gun skills, Ships¹s Gunnery, navigation, and even ship combat.  Security branch members will often receive extensive combat training.

Members of the technical branch will usually have extensive scientific and technical backgrounds, along with Teaching skills, Medical skills and so on.  Most of its members are constantly learning more so that they can pass on this information to new recuits, but a number of its members are older field scouts transferred from active duty before their skills are lost.

Detached Duty members learn computer skills, administration, and other similar skills.  Members of the intelligence branch will learn all of these and also many of the thief/spy skill, combat skills, and so on.



Schools
The Education Branch of the Technical Services Office is responsible for pulling together the information the scout service provides to the imperium along with the extensive training they provide to scouts.  Many scouts will be sent to extensive training courses on special topics, while scouts with very extensive skills may be asked to teach one of these classes to younger students (Teaching skill).

Ship School offers extensive training on all shipboard operations, including Piloting, Astrogation, Mechanics (Ships Drives), Ship¹s Gunnery, Vacc Suit, Free Fall,Electronics Ops (Sensors) and so on.  Graduates of the ship school program often receive well rounded training in all of the skills of the program with skills emphasised based on the talents of the individal Scout.

Intelligence School is primarily used by the security branch and the Intelligence Branch to train agents to protect the empire.  Commonly emphasized skills include Disguise, Acting, Streetwise, Personal combat skills, wilderness skills, and any other applicable thief/spy skill.

Technology School is a shorter course, usually focusing on a few individual skills rather than a well rounded instructional course. Just about any form of electronics, computer or engineering skill may be taught, including courses on Starship design.

Field Training is usually a short course in the field with an experienced older scout, working in smaller teams on a planet.  Survey skills, low tech and high tech navigation, survival skills, and vehicle operation (including grav belts) are all commonly taught.  Most skills will be brought up into to a minimum skill (12?) in such a program.

Contact School is an extensive one year program on first contract procedures, including many examples roleplaying against invented or rare species.  Survey and survival skills are taught, along with extensive training in linguistics, xenobiology, xenolinguistics, Savoir Faire, Fast Talk, Psychology, Detect Lies, Diplomacy.  Most students of such a class will get a basic grounding in most of the skills and specialize in one or two critical skills.

Specialist Schools are shorter, more specialized courses with an expert in the field, including skills in Medicine, most scientific skills, advanced sensor operation, robotics.  These are usually intended to give the character a very solid grounding in the theory of a skill, along with some practical knowledge.






Marine
Marines specifically refers to the Imperial Marines.  Imperial Marines are equipped at the highest tech levels that the Imperium can offer, and are trained in boarding ships, dropping onto planets from space, and acting as the Imperium¹s primary shock troops.  Unlike planetary armies, where the Imperium provides assistance and (rarely) money, the Marines are funded directly by Imperial Taxes.

The Marines have two primary roles in the Imperium.  During times of peace, the Marines are primarily responsible for ensuring that the Imperial Rules of Warfare are maintained.  The Rules of Warfare are more guidelines than anything else, but are applied to prevent mass destruction between opposing elements on a planet, and also to prevent outside parties from providing massive assistance to one side or another of a conflict.  Essentially, the Imperium doesn¹t police warfare unless the warfare gets out of hand, and then they send in Marines to pacify the situation...quickly.  Since most planets have neither the technology or the experienced troops to effectively deal with Imperial Marines, they are more often than not successful at their job.

In times of War, the Imperial Marines are the primary strike arm of the ground forces, trained to move in, secure critical planetary facilities quickly and keep moving, leaving mop-up operations to 2nd line troops, such as Planetary and Imperial Armies.  (See Army career for more details).

Greater than 90% of Imperial Marines troops (not including support units) are deployed with Grav Tanks, APC and Moble artillery pieces.  The remaining 10% include drop troops and Imperial Commandoes, both some of the highest trained units in existence anywhere.

Common Skills:
All Marines are taught extensive personal weapons training, usually in Gauss Rifles or high energy (FGMP) weapons.  Personal combat training with the Cutlass is a tradition in the Marines, and many marines will have both ceremonial and practical skill with the blade.  Few marines outside of the commandoes learn any other blade weapons.  Gambing, brawling and other similar skills come with the military lifestyle.

Marines primarily involved in Infantry actions (including ships troops) will receive extensive training in Gun skills, Free Fall, Battle Suit and heavy weapons, including vehicular weapons.  Many marines will also learn forward observer skills.

Ship¹s troops often learn ship-board skills as per naval personnel, and will often receive training in Piloting (Ship¹s Boat), Starship Gunnery, and additional Vacc Suit training.

Non-infantry units include vehicular crews, medics, techs and so on.  Common skills include Piloting (Grav Vehicles), combat engineering, repair skills (mechanical and electronics), Medical skills and Computer Programming.

Non Commisioned Officers (NCOs) -- usually career soldiers -- are the Marine¹s best method of keeping the traditions of the Marines alive -- and making sure that every Marine receives adequate training.  NCOs will have higher levels of skill in all of the common skills, along with additional heavy weapons training, Tactics, Leadership, Teaching and Administration.

Higher ranking officers will often receive great social benefits, as the Marines are almost as respected a tradition as the Navy.  Staff officers handle the logistics of all marine units, and will receive training in technical skills, computers, teaching, and administration.

Command officers are usually experienced in combat, and will receive leadership skill, Strategy and Tactics, along with many of the same infantry and support skills.

Special Assignments
In addition to cross training between the two main groups of Marines, the Marines also provide specialist training in Medical skills, Communications, Electronics and other technical skills.  

Protected Forces Training is an extensive training course in skills for Ship¹s Troops, and a person sent to this specialist school will usually spend a few years working as a part of a Ship¹s complement, passing their training on to other, less trained troops.  Protected Forces training results in very high levels of Free Fall and Vacc Suit skills, along with training in zero-G weapons.

While all marines receive training in free-fall from orbit, Jump Troops receive extensive training in infantry weapons, battle dress, and drop skills, and are usually the first troops dropped in an invasion -- being used with support from orbit to open holes for other, heavier troops to drop into.

Finally, Imperial Commandoes receive the best (and most expensive) training the Imperium can provide (see GURPS Special Ops perhaps), learning very high skills in martial arts, guns, demolitions, survival skills, stealth, vacc suits, battle dress, knives, and teaching.  Once a member of the marine is sent through commando training, he is usually encouraged to join the commandoes -- and given the elitism and prestige of such units, it is a rare Marine who doesn¹t join!

Commandoes have a few primary roles in the Imperial Military.  First, commandos are staged on critical Imperial worlds that are likely to come under attack in a war with exernal powers, such as the Zhodani or Solomani.  These commandos have extensive experience with that particular enemy¹s tactics, and their primary job is to train up indigeonous troops to slow down enemy offensives.  When other troops are in the area, these troops will also spy on enemy movements and report as much as possible on the enemy.

Offensively, commandos will often be dropped as early as possible, using as much stealth as possible.  These troops will infiltrate and work to report on enemy movements and units, but especially to determine the locations of ground based defenses -- and these same units are often tasked with taking out such units at the beginning of the main ground invasion.    Because of the sheer impossibility of sneaking these troops in without being detected, these troops often have an impossible job.

Officers sent to a specialist school will often receive diplomatic training or extensive training in technical or space skills, including Savoir Faire, Fast Talk, Psychology, Detect Lies, Diplomacy, Xenology, Piloting, Navigation, and other "naval" skills.


Army
In contrast with the Marines, Armies in the Imperium are primarily local forces raised, trained and equipped exclusively by a particular Imperial planet.  While these planets will mostly use local technology, most will also purchase small numbers of high tech weapons from off world.  In times of war or internal conflict, many planets will supplement their normal troops with mercenaries.

Most subsectors also receive subsidies from the Imperium to train ground troops independently of both Imperial Marines and local troops.  These troops are usually equipped at a high TL (13+), although their training and equipment is usually not up to those of the Imperial Marines.  These units are primarily used to reinforce or garrison worlds, -- these troops are usually not trained extensively in planetary invasions, but usually more as defensive units on a planet.

Most armies are divided into three main force commands: Close Orbit and Airspace Control Command (COACC), Nautical Force Command and Ground Force Command.  This section primarily deals with Ground Force command -- for more information on the skills common to the other branches, see the Flyer and Sailor branches.  Marines exclusively use grav vehicles, and thus do not differentiate between the services. At higher tech levels, many armies do not separate the flyer branch from the Cavalry branch.

Army units are primarily divided Artillery, Cavalry (Armor), and Infantry, although larger armies will usually recruit and train commandos (with skill sets much like those of the marines).

Like the Marines, all Army troops will receive gun combat training (weapon types varying by TL).  Brawling and gambling are common skills picked up by the common soldier.

Artillery units receive extensive training in Indirect Fire weapons, Vehicle skills, Forward Observer, Computers, and Electronics.

Cavalry units will receive extensive skills in Vehicle skills, Heavy Weapons, Mechanic and Computers -- the specific weapons depending on the planet¹s TL.

Infantry will usually receive addition guns and heavy weapons training, along with stealth, and survival skills and (rarely) vehicle and Vacc Suit skills.

Non Commisioned Officers (NCOs) -- Like the Marines, most planetary armies rely on experienced NCOs to pass on military skills to new recruits -- and especially to young lieutenants!  NCOs will have higher levels of skill in all of the common skills, along with additional heavy weapons training, Tactics, Leadership, Teaching and Administration.

High ranking officers are respected members of the local planet¹s society.  Staff officers will receive training in technical skills, computers, teaching, and administration, while command officers are usually experienced in combat and have Leadership skill, Strategy and Tactics, along with many of the same infantry and support skills.

Specialist schools are much like those of the Marines, although very few army units have specialists in planetary drops or Protected Forces.  Highly skilled individuals will often be recruited to train new soldiers, and thus learn teaching skill.

Hmmm, good points.  Looks like that won\'t appear in my campaign.

  This came up several months ago. However, both commando units (regiment
- -sized raiders) and rules (ignore ZOC\'s/occupied hexes) are covered, and
none are TL 15. Also, while Terra can churn out replacement armies at TL
14, not even a few thousand TL 15 lift infantry kits can be produced.

  Aren\'t we sort of ignoring the moon landings? A great revolutionary

  Less important than steam-liners or railroads. Also less important than

  If any sort of correlation can be drawn with previous changes in world
view or communications technology, then any such change will only be one
factor in determining attitudes, and may make very little change to the
outlook of most people (even though their economic life may change
drastically).

  How many peoples views of the universe were radically changed by the
realization that the New World existed? Or Europe, for India and China?
You could tell Chinese how vast the world was, but China itself changed
very little until foreign intellectual influences lead to rapid change
in its political structure - a change which India hasn\'t really made.

  Of course, but most North American companies have too short a planning
horizon to invest heavily. As time might be short, this becomes relevent.
OTOH, a genuine need/want to achieve military (or prestige) aims will
happily ignore short term limitations.

It took 80 years for the dupes to get a clue?  Ok, sure I have problems 
with the M:0 timeline (like Vland being a member of the Federation when 
Supplement 11 tells us that by 0 it reached the edge of Core sector - 
but then Supplement 11 also tells us that 60 years later LSP settled 
Mora - so Supplement 11 has it\'s own problems)...

An interesting idea of getting new players, so i forwarded it to the list and MM.
How about it, Marc? T4 is outdated anyway, and it would be a great teaser for T4.1...

resource units in PE to fund units described in  IS?  Why did the IS authors come up with
production points when they already had resource units to play with?  Is there a conversion
between the two?

Secondly (!), I want to try a PE campaign where individual ships are designed (gearhead alert),
built and kept track of in formations such as sqns, fleets etc.  This is fine if you want to fight
every fleet engagment on the ship to ship scale outlined in T4 (right), however I think it would
be fabby is somebody had done a rating system that interlocks nicely with IS.  Every ship would
be rated on ATK/DEF and maybe strength (HP) in order to conduct large-scale actions for IS,
without using the arbitrary SQN values in the book.  This whole system would allow added
roleplaying as you could switch between low-level/large-scale ship cbt easily i nthe same campaign.
The added detail of a detailed star fleet just makes me go all wobbly-kneed.

Hope somebody is on the same wavelength (smart reply to be inserted here)

It should be noted that gravitic focusing of lasers is essentially doing
just that.  You\'re creating a gravitic conduit for the laser.  However,
curiously enough, nobody\'s tried gravitically displacing the laser as a

Ah, my years spent learning from Jesuits *do* come in handy.  They would
answer this argument by stating that God is unknowable in thought and
action, and we are unqualified to judge His works; thus, any imperfection
we see in the Universe is in ourselves, not in the Universe.  (This runs
into the thorny issue of the Original Sin and the Fall if you push it far
enough -- see Milton and Blake for two outstanding poetic treatments (from
opposite points of view) of the issues involved.)

> imperfect.

Can a design executed flawlessly be said to be \'imperfect\' in any
meaninfgul sense?  If one brick in a wall sticks out, and I *meant* that
brick to stick out, then if you see it as an imperfection, you are
mistaken with respect to my intention.  If I write a program such that it
crashes when handed a particular set of data, and I *know while I\'m
writing it* that this is true, and I *want that to happen*, then it\'s not
an error.  This line of argument reduces to ascribing to God the
well-known programmer\'s maxim, "It\'s not a bug, it\'s a feature." :)

Seems to me I\'ve seen something very much like that somewhere.

By the way, it\'s not SF, but I strongly recommend Neil Gaiman\'s _Good
Omens_ for any amateur theologians with a good sense of humor out there.

hesitate before selling them to a newly contacted world,

(2) the assumption that newly-contacted worlds would create very low
volumes of trade is not supported by the available evidence - for example,
assume we have a TL4 world in a system with many worlds, one of which shows
up as mineral rich. It makes sense to me for outsiders to plant a mining
colony on that world, and to supply it via trade with the world with the
active biosphere.

(3) worlds of moderate technology (say, TL7-8) can produce goods that have
value to higher-tech worlds - the examples I am thinking of are nuclear
warheads and fuel cells for TL7 and fission power plants and det laser
warheads for TL8.

(4) worlds of lower technology are prospects for individuals with higher
technology - the \'man who would be king\' syndrome (purchasing land or
political influence via small amounts of critical high technology - for
example, two radio transmitters, one at each end of a trade route, will let
an individual to make super-profits specualting on a TL 4- world).

In conclusion, the Imperium would find it very difficult to quarantine
newly contacted worlds from profitable contact with traders. Therefore, to

	The point of my rather lengthy discussion of RW political and 
business leaders was to give some examples of _actual_ people who were 
considerably more interesting than the card-board cut-out Cleon presented 
in M:0.  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were not "idealistic 
struck fairy-tale heroes" they were real men who were principled, hugely 
influential, and yet were still merely flawed human beings.  A little of 
this would have gone a long way to making M0 a more interesting and 
believable setting.

	M0 makes a lengthy argument about the importance of debasing 
currency, so yeah, it is so much that.  
	As for worlds trading with people other than the designated
Imperial monopoly, this is going to happen and there\'s nothing the
Imperium can do about it. The 3I does not have the ships to blockade 
every planet, and it\'s simply not possible for them to rob people of 
everything worth trading, so Imperials who flout the law or non-Imperials 
who aren\'t bound by it are going to trade with folks out there.  That\'s 
not a bad thing since the Imperium is about free trade and protecting the 
space lanes.  Your 3I sounds like a totalitarian menace.  I say again, if 
this is the real Imperium, then bring on the Rebellion.

	The US also didn\'t suffer any devastation of its roads or 
factories and it still has very modern infrastructure.  If your old 
infrastructure is in the way then you tear it down.  I suppose one way of 
accomplishing this is to start a war and arrange for your enemies to 
level your country, but bull-dozers are likely to be more cost-effective.
	Starting a war to clear out old infrastructure is rather like 
burning down your house so that you can remodel the kitchen.

	If the explosive economic growth experienced by countries around 
the world over the last 50 years is not evidence that people do want 
economic advancement and that governments are willing to aggressively 
pursue it, I don\'t know what is.
	If you want to argue that the people contacted by the Imperium are
heavily influenced by the Vilani and therefore are attached to the status
quo, be my guest.  But using the history of Europe as an example of
economic complacency just doesn\'t make sense. Your description fits 
countries like Iran and North Korea but not Europe.

	Interstellar economic trade will be based on the IC.  The 
economic logic is totally overwhelming and I don\'t think the Imperium 
could stop it if it wanted to.  The US is a much smaller economy relative 
to the rest of the world than the Imperium would be to any one planet.  
And yet a huge fraction of international trade is conducted in dollars.  
Many countries peg their exchange rate to the dollar and others back 
their currency not with gold but with dollars.  As for mindset, if you\'d 
ever travelled in the Communist Bloc before the Wall came down, you\'d 
have seen how desperate people are for hard currency.  The Imperial 
Credit will be the epitomy of hard currencies, backed by the interstellar 
trade of dozens and then thousands of worlds.

	Actually, I do know a little bit about the EC, certainly more than
enough to tell you that the EC is a very poor model for the Imperium.  The
EC is made up of a small number of states, several of which are large
enough to be a big fraction of joint economic output.  The Imperium is
made up of a strong center and small, weak and fragmented periphery, which
it seeks to incorporate and is already able to totally dominate
economically.  The EC is attempting to create a new "supra-national" state
while the Imperium is little more than a customs union and collective
security arrangement.  The Imperium is the key to economic and
technological recovery for the worlds of the Outback while the EC is
nothing more than an umbrella for managing the interests of its member
states.  They have very little in common.  
	A better comparison would be the relationship between the US and 
Europe during the Marshall Plan.  Europe was economically puny and 
devastated while the US had an enormous economy and a technological lead. 
The Europeans accepted US rules on trade and finance along with our
economic aid.  The resulting free trade and economic growth resulted in
enormous prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.

	Gee, I thought they had all of this dangerous mineral wealth that 
could be traded on the export market.  Oh, that\'s right, you shipped it 
all off at 100dt a year.

	Actually, you already have a Single European Currency, it\'s 
called the Mark.  The Germans have been calling the shots on monetary 
policy on the Continent for some time.  The ECU will give other Europeans 
a voice in monetary policy that they haven\'t had up till now.  The 
Germans are worried about this because of their inflation phobia and the 
demonstrated inability of other governments to practice fiscal policy 
consistent with stable monetary policy.
	Again, this has very little to do with Traveller because the 
massive currency markets and trade ties that make this all so problematic 
for Europe won\'t be able to exist in a universe where transport and 
communication is limited by the speed of jump.

	I think this is a big source of our disagreement.  The Wilds look 
the way they do because they collapsed totally and suddenly.  The Long 
Night was preceeded by at least a generation of twilight that resembled 
the Hard Times far more than the Virus-induced Collapse.  There was 
plenty of time for worlds to make adjustments without being reduced to 
total social collapse and rule by strong-men and despots.  Also, without 
the horror of the Final War and Virus, the technophobia and xenophobia 
that characterize the Wilds simply won\'t be present. Furthermore, the 
situation in the Long Night has had a millenia to stabilize, while the 
Wilds have only had a few decades to sort things out.

	Well, this arm-chair economic theorist thinks the plan is more 
likely to be from the fevered imagination of some politician who has read 
Machiavelli once too often.

Actually, there is a great amount of research bneing done along these lines
regarding geneticly acquired cancers.  Seems that some mammals have the
predisposition for the cancer (like Hodgkin\'s Lymphoma in pigs) but never
develop the disease.  Be interesting if we could isolate and transfer the
gene sequence that allows the immunity.

This, BTW, is why I don\'t mind much about disease and food compatability

along with products to help humans digest odd food items, make travel far
safer.

I let my players "choose" their characters using the T4 rules.  All of
us also play Champions and Shadowrun.  Both these systems give you a
point total to spend.  So, you can basically create the character you
want.

With T4 I allowed the characters to simply pick the skills from the
tables, as long as the skill was in their career.  They were also
allowed to switch careers, with a -DM each time they did it (applied
to the enlistment).  This technique turned out pretty well.  The group
is surprisingly balance, since they had a good idea of how they wanted
their team to turn out.  They were able to compliment each others
skills this way.

I did however, make them roll randomly for their "homeworld" and
"background" skills (they just loved getting "equestrian" level 3)! 
Mustering out was also rolled (No, I\'m sorry but you can\'t "pick"
scout ship 3 times).

James,

I was one of those that forwarded the TML post from Marc, to the
Rec.Games.Frp.Misc news group. The message is true.

I would wait for Traveller Version 4.1 if it ever sees publishing.

No, not at all.  At least I\'m not.  The lack of follow through has allowed

different things.

Popular culture isn\'t that hard to quantify.  Culture is just like any
other emergent system.  Once you find one link, everything starts to fall
into place.

Alot of people\'s worldviews were changed as the result of the New World. 
Suddenly the world was far larger than previously believed.  That was a
pretty profound impact on the Western world.

This is one of those things that\'s tough to call.  Corporate America is
tired of waiting for NASA to come along in order to launch its satellites,
and they\'re taking matters into their own hands.  We can only wait to see
what kind of vistas become opened as a result.

Imperium Games is gone, dead, no longer publishing Traveller.  The letter

this list.

Never got published.

Steven was presumably referrring to Ye-Lu/Cemplas (1123 Core) A100134-G.

Travellers Digest #10 (pg27) says "Navy scientists are particularly
proud of their accomplishments: the Ye-Lu starport is operated by the
Imperial Navy as a research project, testing the limits of robotic
networking.  The entire corps ofrobots at the facility is tied together
into one gigantic master/slave network; theoretically the entire
starport is "one" robot, with only "one" brain, but the brain is
dispersed throughout the complex.  All communication between the robots
is handeled by portable meson communicators, another important
experimental device developed by the Imperial Navy at Ye-Lu."

Ye-Lu is jump 10 from Capital/Core, is only jump 2 from Research Station
Omiicron (0922 Core) where the Virus was first developed, (Survival
Margin pg 72) and is within TNE\'s Black Curtain.

I am, of course, totally sure that all these facts are mere coincidence
and that Ye-Lu could not possibly be a Virus controlled port in the New
Era.

Right. TL is industrial capacity, more or less. A measure of what a society
can build IF they have the required knowledge. You need both knowledge and
tools to build something. If either is missing, it can\'t be built. Therefore
the Rule of Man could not build Fusion+ or drop tanks, despite being TL 12.
Therefore a TL 12 planet _may_ be unable to build jump-3 ships, but only if
they lack the proper knowledge. So the question becomes, did Sylea lack the
knowledge to build jump-3 ships? Since I\'m in favor of the "TL of an
interstellar state reflects its space TL" handwave to explain away TL 14 RoM
relics, I definitely think that a TL 12 interstellar state would have the
knowledge to build jump-3 ships!

In which case their technology is not TL 12. But the Sylean Federation\'s TL
had been 12 since -150.

>And some times the best Tech is not always economically successful.

True. But again, if jump-3 technology had been lost, the Sylean Federation
would not, IMO, have been TL 12 but only TL 11. Furthermore, jump-3 is the
most economic way to transport goods long distance. (Provided the jump-3
ship is not forced to jump short too many times; it\'s easy to find trade
routes where jump-2 is superior to jump-3 (a string of worlds two parsecs
apart, for instance), but it\'s difficult to imaging any sizable pocket
empire that wouldn\'t have _some_ routes where jump-3 was the most economic).

Hey, maybe that\'s why there are no jump-3 ships in Milieu Zero: At the
official freight and passenger rates jump-3 ships are economically
unviable. So these 10,000 year old Vilani regulations ensures that that
jump-3 ships won\'t be built. Yeah, that\'s the ticket! It all makes perfect
economic sense, right?

Just remember that debasing a currency is not going to make a planet one
iota poorer. All it will do is to redistribute the wealth on the planet.
If you don\'t physically remove goods from a planet, you don\'t remove any
of its wealth. Furthermore, you can only debase a currency if it is backed
by something concrete (and then only by _importing_ more of the same; a
society which used an abstract accounting system would be immune to anything

Nor can you export very much of a planet\'s real wealth in that small a space.
And all you accomplish by removing gold or any other artificially high value
minerals is to force them away from the gold or whatever standard.

Just remember that the only way to move wealth between planets is to ship
goods. Massive Imperial aid will require lots of trade volume.

A world is not going to want Imperial credits or any other sort of outside
currency until it is already fairly integrated into the Imperial economy.
Why? Because no one is really interested in square pieces of plastic with
numbers printed on them, or any other kind of money. What they want are
whatever goods they believe they can buy with their square pieces. So
until they are confident that they can get something that they can eat,
burn, or fondle for their Crimps, they are going to want goods in exchange
for their goods. 

Btw. this means that the value of gold or jewels to a merchant is what he
believes he can sell it for on his home planet, not what the locals think
it is worth.

Outpost

Tor Books, 349 pages

Scott Mackay
Outpost is Canadian Scott Mackay\'s first novel.

 A review by Todd Richmond

     Outpost is a story about a struggle for freedom and survival,
combining elements of science fiction, mystery and suspense. It begins
in a prison, clearly not on Earth because of the presence of two suns.
The story centers around Felicitas, a seventeen year old woman who is
just coming out of a mind-clouded haze. The prisoners in this alien
prison are watched and guarded by machines, robots which guide the
prisoners around the prison, feed them, and keep them there. A variety
of different devices keep the
prisoners controlled, including their sleeping pallets. Every night they
are strapped to their beds and given a combination of drugs and
electronic images which brainwash them and reinforce their dream-like
state.  The images fed to them are of the crimes that they have
committed, a constant reminder of why they are here.

     Unfortunately, we discover, the current prisoners are the
descendants of the original prisoners, who were forgotten by their
wardens. To make the machines care for their children, the original
prisoners tattooed their prison identification symbols onto their
children. As an unpleasant consequence, however, the crimes of their
parents and grandparents are visited upon their children every night.

     As the story opens, the prison is beginning to break down. Not
maintained for many generations, the machines are beginning to fail, and
some of the prisoners, the "superstiti", have managed to awaken from
their dream state. They realize the prison is failing and begin to make
plans to escape before their wardens return, or before they starve to
death in the prison. While she helps the other superstiti with the
escape
plans, Felicitas discovers that she has a special gift which allows her
to work some of the alien devices in the prison. She also discovers that
she can read some of the alien glyphs of their captors, whom they call
the "uominilupi" -- beings who look like wolves yet walk like men. She
dreams of one of these aliens, Lungo Muso, as she sleeps. He shows her
other places and times as she dreams but she has difficulty
understanding what it all means.

     Felicitas escapes with some of the others just before their captors
return. She is taken in by a group of hunters who are the descendants of
former escapees. They take her to their town, New Florence, where she
meets, Raffaele, a would-be astronomer and another of the people whom
Lungo Muso visits. There she discovers the meaning of the visions and
what she must do to save not only herself, but all of mankind as well.

     Mackay weaves together a fascinating tale. The effort to escape
from the prison and the prisoners\' explorations of the alien technology
are very interesting, as is his vision of a prison run entirely by
machines. He does an admirable job of describing the prisoners\' efforts
to decipher the alien machines and writing, and shows how truly
difficult it would be to use technology with little understanding of it.
There is some romance mixed into the plot, as well as jealousy. There is
a great deal of tension and suspense in the prison as those who are
"awake" plot to escape and the "dead" come under the control of special
implants and attempt to stop them. There are enough different elements
in this story that everyone should find something to interest them.

     The story is very complex, though, and I have to admit I had to
read Outpost twice to truly appreciate it. But I think the effort was
worth it. There are twists to the tale that I didn\'t catch the first
time. Mackay ties up all of the loose ends except for one that deals
with a time travel paradox. Rather than trying to explain it, however,
it is merely ignored. Not uncommon in a story that deals with time
travel. It doesn\'t detract from the story, though, and in fact, the time
travel aspect plays a somewhat minor role in the plot of this book. I
recommend Outpost to science fiction lovers who are willing to give a
chance to new authors with fresh ideas.

Apologies for not responding to anything on the TML for some time, but at
the moment I\'m trying (with a number of other people) to coordinate
publishing of future Traveller material with Marc Miller (both for GURPS
and T4/5) in addition to my \'real\' work which is weighing heavily upon my
time.

However, I was notified that there seems to have been some confusion
occurring on the TML as regards the names and functions of the two
organisations that I run - BITS (British Isles Traveller Support) and CORE
(Traveller Product Development Group).

BITS AND CORE
=============

Given the commercially sensitive nature of current licensing agreements,
etc. I felt I should correct this data as quickly as possible.

I would be grateful if anyone holding any form of information on BITS
and/or CORE update their material according to the data given below. There
appears to have been some minor misunderstanding as to the correct data.

The following (corrected) information is that which has been provided, from
the outset of T4, to Marc Miller, Destination Games, SweetPea
Entertainment, Imperium Games, the TML, etc.

>=== FAQ Begins Here ===

>What other companies publish Traveller material?
>
>At the moment, two British companies, BITS and CORE, have been
>licensed to publish Traveller material. Also, Steve Jackson Games
>has been licensed to publish Traveller material compatible with

There is only one British company with a license to publish Traveller
materials, and that is BITS (British Isles Traveller Support). BITS is a UK
company (i.e. it makes tax returns, is VAT registered, etc.). It publishes
the only independent supplements for Traveller - the 101 series of books, etc.

BITS has been promoting Traveller throughout the UK from early 1995,
including launching T4 at European GEN CON (EGC) in 1996, attending events
and liaising with RPG retailers. Jo was also a great help, working hard
(with Lesley) to help me (and BITS) make the T4 launch a great success in
1996. EGC 97 was a huge success with three RPGA-approved tournaments and
loads of help from BITS referees (building on our success I\'ll be needing
at least as much help again for EGC 98)!

Imperium Games may have stopped publishing, but BITS has a wide range of
upcoming products (including more 101 books). A broader license is being
negotiated with Marc at the moment to ensure a continuing line of support
for Traveller during this \'intermediate\' period. Discussions on
distribution in the US have been held up but will hopefully be resolved in
the next month or two.

>Who or What is CORE?

CORE is a group of writers of Traveller products who have provided Imperium
Games with T4 products such as Milieu 0, Pocket Empires, Psionic
Institutes, Long Way Home, Gateway, and the unfortunate Aliens book. In
addition, CORE wrote the original The Long Way Home and CORE writers have
written the 101 series of booklets.

These non-Imperium Games products have all been published in the UK by
BITS. Although both the CORE and BITS logos appear on these products, CORE
itself does not have any funds nor publishing rights; CORE is currently
purely a group who develop and write Traveller material.

>CORE doesn\'t appear to be an acronym for anything, even though
>it\'s written in all-caps.

CORE was the name I suggested for the group of writers, based partly on the
theme of being \'central\' to Traveller development and also based upon the
Traveller system Core. It sounded good at the time, anyway. The reason it
is in block capitals is because it follows the format of the BITS logo.

>Jo Grant heads up this organization,...

Nope, I do. As noted in the frontispiece of one of the T4 works (M0?), CORE
was formed by David Burden and myself. The first CORE/BITS work (The Long
Way Home) was purely our own work and was financed and published by myself.
CORE subsequently expanded to include people such as Jo Grant, Joe Walsh,
Stu Dollar, Suz Dollar, etc. Jo worked with CORE on some of the early
products (both for IG and for BITS) but unfortunately his work and personal
commitments precluded him from contributing to later products for IG.
Unfortunately, many of Jo\'s innovative concepts fell on deaf ears at IG and
were not pursued despite collective efforts to promote these ideas over the
past couple of years. Hindsight indicates that IG may not have had
sufficient free capital to invest in anything more radical than the basic
line of books they wished to pursue. Many good ideas, necessarily, fell by
the wayside when IG was determining their products for each forthcoming year.

>...formally called the CORE Gaming Collective.

Jo was kind enough to set up the page early on in CORE\'s history in order
to advertise our products. CORE is not called the CORE Gaming Collective;
this is the name Jo chose to use on his web page. I sometimes call CORE the
CORE Traveller Development Group in order to clearly indicate its purpose.

I now own domain names for both BITS and CORE and \'official\' web pages for
both organisations will be released in the near future.

>...CORE works closely
>with BITS, and also has some projects of its own, such as a
>Traveller collectable-card game.

Jo is pursuing some projects privately but not currently in an official
role for either BITS or CORE.

>What can you tell me about GURPS:Traveller?

BITS are discussing with SJG the launch of GURPS at UK Games Fest and Euro
Gen Con later this year. Future BITS supplements will also support GURPS
Traveller and CORE writers are already signed up to help write GURPS
supplements.

As with BITS, support will be provided for *all* types and eras of Traveller.



Now, very quick responses to a few other things:

ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING
=====================

Yes, despite some negative vibes with regard to electronic publishing of
BITS material, etc. this *is* being considered quite seriously,
particularly with regard to software (such as the excellent Infini-V
program by Rob Prior).

THE LONG WAY HOME
=================

Someone asked about the original The Long Way Home. Yes, I do have a few
copies left. If anyone is still interested, please get in touch. Although
this appeared as separate products (Long Way Home and Gateway) by IG,
payment for these products (as well as several THOUSAND dollars worth of
work I did for them) has not been made, thus, to my knowledge, all rights
have reverted to the original authors (myself and David Burden). However,
we are unlikely to re-publish TLWH in its original format, so if you have
one of the original 300 print-run, good luck, it might be worth something
in a few years time.

THE IMPERIAL THRONE
===================

Don McKinney <dmckinne@itds.com> mentioned a T4 Storyline Possibility which
he \'pitched\' to me very early in the development of the T4 line.

Don, I\'m afraid an awful lot of ideas where pitched at IG but were
rejected, adapted, whatever. Unfortunately spending most of my time writing
for IG and the rest trying to run BITS meant that taking on another "TLWH"
size adventure wasn\'t possible at that time. If I failed to respond to you
to explain this at the time, then I apologise now for this.

FUTURE 101 BOOKS
================

"Peter H. Brenton" <pbrenton@mit.edu> proposed some interesting new 101 books:

>101 Near C Rocks
>101 Technolgically Elevated Dictators
>101 Single Celled Animals
>101 Unihabited TL12 Mainworlds
>101 TL4- Vacuum Worlds
>101 Quoted Full Texts of TML Messages with a One Line of Useless Comment at
the End.

The latter being a book after my own heart. I have already assigned a team
of 200 CORE writers to start on the above products in addition to the
following which should be published in the near future:

101 Ways to Run a RPG Business
101 Ways Not to Run a RPG Business
101 Ways to Get Shafted Writing Material for a RPG Company
101 Ways to Lose Thousands of Dollars Working for a RPG Company
101 More Bright Ideas We Had That We Weren\'t Allowed to Publish



If you have *ANY* queries with regard to BITS or CORE, please send them
*PRIVATELY* to me at A.S.Lilly@nortel.co.uk. I rarely have time to monitor
the TML (although other people do this for me) and due to pressures of
work, my responses are still likely to be very slow, for which I apologise
in advance. I\'m sorry but I cannot currently discuss licensing issues with
regard to BITS, CORE or T4.1 - please watch for official messages from Marc
Miller.

My take is that although it may have not taken 80 years for them to
catch on but it _did_ take that long for enough people to give a
damn to actually be able to *do* something about it. Read up on
the race riots in the U.S. just a few decades ago. So many spontaneous
riots broke out that the FBI just *knew* it was a conspiracy and spent
a tremendous effort toward finding something that wasn\'t there. Enough
people who were willing to take action just got fed up with the situation
though I\'ll admit that the ability to receive real-time information via
radio/TV may have been a subliminal catalyst.

This kind of cultural "spontaneous combustion", combined with the
distances involved could, IMO, easily take 80 years, if not more. Keep
in mind we\'re talking parsecs to worlds which have varied cultures. By
the time news hits those worlds, it\'s weeks and even months old, even
assuming each world\'s culture(s) causes its citizens to care. Some
pretty horrible things are happening on Earth today (i.e. Africa) with
real-time pictures in living color but to the person on the street it
means nothing because either the threat isn\'t recognized or it\'s not
_personal_. It\'s usually just a topic for people to shake their heads
and say "How terrible" while they deal with the stresses of work,
sick children, and other aspects of their daily lives.

Finally, there\'s almost always some people in power who prefer
to ignore a threat or try to bribe it in the hope it\'ll just go away. An
example of this is the abandoning of Poland by the world
community to Hitler.

So, to me, 80 years is very possible.

The only thing even close to "canon" that I recall was in FASA\'s
Beyond Sector. There was a hex with a nebula posted as a Red
Zone. According to the hex description, using a M-drive within the
nebula caused part of it near a ship to fuse, resulting in a Plasma
gun hit on a random location.

I guess it really depends on how "nebulous" the nebula is and
which type of M-drive the ship is using (assuming your campaign
allows for different types). I\'d say most of the time you wouldn\'t
have anything to worry about.

Sensors are something else entirely. Anybody care to elucidate
on the effects of high-energy ionization on delicate electronics?

Nope. CORE is a collective. No one heads it up. Andy was chosen as the
spokesperson to IG. It was originally formed so that a number of writers
could pursue various directions in publishing Traveller material but have a
common branded logo for collective value. At least that\'s what the mails in
my archive say.

>Jo is pursuing some projects privately but not currently in an official

I have no active role in BITS. However I continue to work on publishing
various Traveller material under the CORE logo and will continue to do so
in the spirit of the collective. I have assumed Andy has been unable to
help with this as he has not returned e-mail to me in quite some time.
  My current ambition is to bring a number of products to market and
distribute them freely on the CORE web-page
(http://members.nova.org/~sol/core) and also provide paper-copies for sale
at-cost. There are other things I am pursuing as CORE but I deplore
vaporware and would rather refrain from announcing anything until I have a
firm launch date.
  I\'ve been directing those wanting to do commercial CORE supplements and
make money to Andy and those wishing to publish amateur CORE supplements
containing material by fans for fans to myself. That has been my
understanding of Andy\'s role and my own role based on agreements made over
the years. I guess the fact that Andy posted the above publicly contrary to
previous agreements and not in consultation with me indicates that he has
rather another view.
  It\'s a pity, really, that when the hobby needs this sort of amateur
support the most that elements of Rebellion eat it from within...

I\'m pretty sure that the computer "neuron" you\'re talking about here
don\'t have the same complexity as a neuronal cell.  _If_ neuronal
cells are on/of, and things like running low on chemicals in various
parts of the neuron aren\'t important, maybe we can implement an ant.

I agree.  Training large nets is currently impossible.  However, our
brains do learn -- therefore training them is possible.  Eventually,
we may even figure out how.

So, I\'m saying you\'re overestimating how much simulation capability we
have relative to what Nature uses, and overestimating the amount of
time required to train once we have figured out _how_ to train the
systems.

The way I would treat AI is as follows:

At some point in the future, we will figure out how brains "learn".
At that time, you will have two kinds of AI/autopilots.
1. Programmed/expert systems good at what they do, but requiring human
observation because they don\'t have or use enough data to get the big
picture.
2. Learning systems which need human training, but could conceivably
be "as good as" a human.  These systems actively acquire and use much
more data than type 1.

For game playability, I\'m going to decree that we haven\'t figured out
the learning trick and leave type 2 autopilots to Ancient devices.


	and so we have walking 6 legged machines with neural networks at
	Tl:8, but we still does\'nt have an ant.

We have walking 6 legged machines (and running 4, 2, and 1 legged
machines).  But I wouldn\'t trust any of the current autonomous
controllers to any machine large/expensive enough to do anything useful.

Blacksburg Technical Research Center, which is Greg Porter\'s
publishing company; publishers of the CORPS gaming system, 3G3, VDS
(Vehicle Design System), and other fine RPG supplements. As mentioned
before 3G3! is _the_ word on weapons design for RPG\'s. VDS is a greatly
expanded version of the vehicle design rules in CSC, altered somewhat to
be the base system for CORPS. It\'s sort of the vehicle half of FFS for
CORPS, and like 3G3! is a quite well-done, though _very_ gearheaded
supplement.

Well, I don\'t know anything canon about this, but I do know that nebulae
are __VERY__ thin. so thin that you could drag a football field sized
scoop all the way across it and get only a shot glass full of material. 
Based on this, IMTU nebulae have no effect on M drives or J drives.

If anyone has the chance/funds, I highly recommend picking up GURPS Biotech,
for a full treatment of the future of bio-science.  Not only is it a great
sourcebook for sci-fi ideas, but it also does a wonderful job of describing
modern biotechnology.  Sort of a "DNA for Dummies" manual.  I work at a
company that does genetic research, and it was fun reading GURPS Biotech as
a way to incorporate things I\'ve learned about at work with my game.

Of course, then the problem becomes this:  thousands of years into the
future, we will have mapped the human genome, and probably made remarkable
advancements.  Should I require all of my characters to take the "Immune to
Disease" and "Longevity" advantages, plus or minus a slew of others?
Enhanced senses?  Combat reflexes?  Ad nauseum?  Maybe have a base package
for human players?  Or I could do what Dave is talking about, and just
assume that everyone has some level of automatic immunity, without bothering
with character points.

These should up, both here and on my web page soon.  Thanks to all the

disaster.  (Short form:  My medication destroyed my short-term memory

If you want to do 3G3 right, go to hyperbooks online and download the

I plan on it.  It looks pretty fantastic from what I\'ve seen.

That all depends.  My own way of doing it would be to make up a base
package for _Imperial_ human characters.  Then, if someone wants to be a
barbarian from a (Traveller) TL4 world, that would be a disadvantage to
him.  The disadvantage would work then as other GURPS disadvantages. 
Advantages are only advantages when they place the characters above the
adveturing norm.

Really. Look at Dune, forex. The whole culture is one based around honour
and ethics (eg Kanly) yet non of the Landsraad so much as blinks when the
Harkonnen\'s butcher the Atreides and their retainers.

I think that Jo has defended M0 more than adequately so I\'ll only add two
things -

(1) the consolidation begins around 76 and runs to 120 (the Pacification
Campaigns, also mentioned in passing in Missions of State)

and (2),  your view seems to be very naive - for all the Victorians made
out that the British Empire was wonderful, those that conquered the
colonies were brutal and everything you dislike about M0- you need to have
this brutality to have the luxury of the glorious humane empire later.

IMO of course.

In Hero Games\' _Champions_ (the first hardcover blue book, whatever edition that is)
they designed a game for many different genres. In the character-based point 
system, you paid for things that made you different from other people. A Medieval
Fantasy setting, you weren\'t literate in your native tongue unless you paid for it. 
A space opera setting, you were automatically familiar with computers and 
the operation of anti-gravity cars. 

What I would recommend is that you decide on a baseline "everybody is like
this" average - include average lifespan, disease immunities, whatever. Charge
your players points if they want unusual advatages (maybe not everyone is
immune to the Dread Denebian WereWorm Virus) and let them take
disadvatages if they don\'t have the average immunities/advantages (because
they came from a low-tech homeworld, for example).

I\'d make Longevity part of the Vilani racial package.  According to GURPS
Ultra-Tech, the base age for aging rolls goes up as the tech level
increases, so you are covered there.

Scouts might have "Immune to Diesease" as part of their career package.
This would cover the broad-spectrum anti-virals, plus the fact they\'ve
probably had everything by now!

GURPS covers that by the disadvantage "Primative."  You could also add

This, then, begs the question of why aging rolls begin in the 30\'s in
Traveller . . . but let\'s not get into another "Traveller Technology: The

  Probably because we seem to have slipped into discussing religion.
While I\'ll concede that there _will_ be unforeseen impacts, the development
of a hypothetical Jump drive would not necessarily (and from the evidence
of previous similar advances, would not) result in a massive, widespread,
fundamental change in world-view.

  The vast majority of people didn\'t care, if they heard about it, and it
certainly didn\'t change their lives directly (long-term economic impacts
are an entirely separate issue). As for the elites, some knew what the
planets diameter was to begin with, and although Columbus didn\'t he lived
pretty sure he knew what size it was (i.e., "knowing" isn\'t always correct).

  It\'s been a long time coming, and that\'s only for satellite launches.
OC, this should incrementally decrease lift costs, with hope of a break-
through in efficiencies by new technologies.

Yes! I\'ve been _very_ impressed with the amount of real-world
knowledge available in the descriptions and sidebars of many
of the GURPS books. One thing I\'ve seen about SJG is that
the developers appear to do quite a bit of research into their
topics.

"I\'m am _not _ a gearhead; I\'m a knowledge groupie."

Other good books for those of you looking for Ancients
tech would be UltraTech and UltraTech 2. I\'ve also been
playing with some of the moves from GURPS: Martial Arts
converted to MegaTraveller and it\'s pretty effective. By the
by, reprints of GURPS: Vehicles have been hitting the
local (Dallas, TX) game stores today.

I believe the auto-immunity idea was Doug\'s but my take on
the subject is to make it easy on yourself and assume the 
advantages are over and above the norm. If everyone has an
improved immune system then it\'s no longer an "advantage";
it has become the norm.

IMTU, I\'ve always had recently mustered Scouts and
Merchants from hi-tech worlds be able to ignore just about
every disease found on lower tech worlds because of the
effects of higher tech medicine. Wide-spectrum medication
should have been available to these folks because their jobs
required it.

Now put someone who\'s never been off-planet into a
disease-laden environment they\'ve never been exposed to
and you\'ve got problems. The same could be said for
sophonts from a very low-tech planet winding up on a
high-tech planet, except in reverse (they bring the crud
with them). Of course, this is what Starport Customs is
supposed to catch (pun!).

Actually, my interpretation is that you still do need a beam pointer. It
includes a couple of things:

"looking up the boresight" sensors - a laser weapon, for ultimate precision,
needs some kind of sensor looking along the launch optics. Ideally (and at low
TLs) it needs to be sensitive enough to see the target; at higher TLs it
just needs to be able to see a star that\'s near the target, but in either
case, to get the nanoradian acuracy that laser weapons need at long ranges,
you need a boresight sensor that uses the same optics the laser pulse
will need.

I also assume it includes the physical mechanisms that do beam steering - 
it\'s a measure of how much money you\'ve spent on making your beam steering
mirror precisely pointable over a given field of view. For a PAW or meson
weapon it\'s a measure of how much money you spent on the magnets that do
precision beam steering.

The beam pointer is a traversing mechanism in some sense, but it\'s the
fine traversing mechanism - ultraprecise but with very limited range; it
doesn\'t move the whole weapon, just deflects the beam slightly. 
Therefore even spinal weapons don\'t need it, and it\'s relatively independent
of weapon size (for a laser, it\'s a fine pointing mirror downstream in the
laser path, not the final launch optic.) I\'m not sure what sam means abotu
"battery" - original FFS had no rules for "batteries" in it. I would myself
assume that a battery needs one pointer per laser.

No, I figured that was the case.  I posted the storyline after the demise
of IG to generate interest, and give the ideas to anyone running a campaign
in the setting.  My assumption at the moment is that the potential for
commercial development of the idea is less than zero, and I just want to
see people using the ideas.  And I\'ve promised now to devote a web page 
to it on my site (not ready yet) with more details.  Obviously it is outside
the published M:0 universe, since my map of Core sector and my Core sector
details match the CT/MT ones, and I\'ll admit that my feelings about M:0
devolve from two sources:

a) the joker who stole my copy of First Survey and Milleu Zero at a con
   before I read either,
b) the cavalier attitude that the good work of Joe Fugate and Gary Thomas
   were regarded by the writers of M:0
c) (ok, I lied - three sources) the obvious lack of players present during
   the creation of adventures for M:0 - my gaming group (derived from the
   Conflict Simulation Society at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
   Champaign, hence the "Winter War Gaming Convention" signature) strives
   for high ideals in our role-playing, except for the "Vampire" group...
   the "Wall Street Gaming" concepts that seem to pervade M:0 fell very
   flat on our door step.
 
Ok, I come not to praise M:0, but to bury it.  I\'ll put my M:0 books 
in the closet next to the few TNE books I own, and try to eagerly await
G:T (the last, greatest hope for Traveller).


Donning the asbestos suit,

In my GURPS campaigns, I\'ve always handled this one by creating a racial 
template that reflects the genetically improved human.  I\'d then increase 
the number of points available to characters by that point cost.

So, let\'s assume the package is 15 points.  Instead of 100 point 
characters, the campaign would use 115 point characters instead.  If a 
player wanted to build a character without that package, I\'d consider 
assessing an Unusual Background cost on case by case basis.  Generally, 
I\'d charge the Unusual Background only if I felt the player was 
attempting to abuse on the system.

The TL4 barbarian would have both extra points and the primitive 
disadvantage, but isn\'t going to fit in too well in modern society.  
Which is as it should be.  On the other hand, they\'ll probably be much 
more physically fit than the PCs. :)

You can go the other route, and assume the package costs 0 points.  
Anyone who doesn\'t have the package gets a -15 point disadvantage.  If 
you don\'t include the disadvantage in the maximum number of 
disadvantages, the math works out the same.

As far as Immunity to Disease/Resistance to Disease for chracters, I\'ve 
usually saved it for scouts. Even though everone else\'s immunity systems 
have been improved, the diseases are probably more virulent.

I\'d probably give everyone Longevity, but start Vilani on aging rolls 
much later than other humans.  This should probably be a freebie for 
Vilani -- when is the last time you saw a PC die of old age? :)

I\'m not sure that the photo you saw was of ionization breakdown. Even without
it, rayleigh scattering of a bright beam off of air or dust is very visible;
our laser guide star beam (20 W in a 30-cm-diameter beam) is easily visible
(at night); it does indeed look a special effect - you can see it from about
a mile away. In daylight, beams are harder to see but a 60-W YAG beam in a
milimeter or so is fairly visible.

Ionization breakdown, on the other hand, is spectacular but also usually bad
news, I gather, as the ionized air is opaque to the laser beam and hence
tends to make the laser destroy itself.

Traveller weapons lasers are pulsed (millisecond pulses) and are probably
outside of the visible-light range, so you\'ll need sensors to track them
back to their firing source - and advanced sensors will also be able to 
track gauss slugs back to their firing point too.

It\'s not weird at all. The exit point can\'t be "stationary" - it has
to be stationary with respect to something, or in some particular frame
of reference. The logical frame of reference is that it\'s stationary in 
a frame in which the jumping spacecraft is also stationary - ie it moves 
at the velocity of the jumping spacecraft. (It sounds like you want it to
be stationary in the frame of the target system, which makes very little
sense; what\'s special about that frame?) Similarly, the sensible way to
minize the "extra" accelerating you need to do once you come out of jump
is to match velocities with your target world.  I can\'t think of any other
way to deal with it that\'s consistent.

To the extent that we know them (from stellar rotational axis estimates based

AGREED.  100%.  But would you want to run a campaign in this universe?
No.

For example (NOTE TO SELF: Add to Imperial Throne Storyline):

IMTU (heh), Cleon buggers up the diplomacy "imperially" with the Chanestin,
so badly they want to bomb the Imperial Palace in an attempt to kill him
(hah - he dug a bunker expecting that kind of action from those bastards).
Anyway, this starts a war that lasts until the early teens when the new
"Imperium" meets its first challenge by devastating the Chanestin.
Remember, it\'s personal.  Heck, I actually up it in the storyline, by
having the noble lady Cleon wants to marry killed by the Chanestin during
a raid shortly after the coronation. 

Anyway, look at the Chanestin world UPPs in the 1100s - boring TL, yawn
worlds.  In M:0, these guys almost kill the Imperium before it starts. 
Guess what got bombed back to the stone age.

Further, the real villian of the piece is this Lentuli guy.  The PCs (by
the year 0) are Cleon\'s close associates.  But this Lentuli guy shows 
up around the time of the end of the Chanestin War, and appeals to all
of Cleon\'s bad feelings.  A few drinks and an arranged romance later,
Lentuli is on the fast track for making the Imperium a not too friendly
place.  

And our PCs are wondering what happened...

Hey, I don\'t deny that.  But allow your players to live on the same 
idealism the Victorians did to justify their actions, and produce the same
noble individuals who bucked the system as well.  

Insert Rudyard Kipling\'s \'The White Man\'s Burden\' here...
We should have brought some of that nobility from Space: 1889 over to M:0.

What you are saying then, that our worldview is exactly the same today as
it was always and will never change.  That, say, a peasant living on the
British Isles in 1200 AD had exactly the same worldview as an American
living in 1998?

"If they heard about it" is the most important part about what you\'re
saying.  I don\'t think that I pretended to believe, at any point, that
every single person in the world has had their world view changed by any
advance.  This isn\'t a matter of haves vs. have nots, or West vs. East. 
The discovery of the New World changed people\'s worldviews, there\'s no
doubt about that.  Did it change every single person on the face of the
planet\'s worldview?  No.  Of course not.  I never said that.

The launch site won\'t just be for satellite launches.  They\'ve already said
that.  At first it\'ll just be efficient satellite launches.  Let the
exploitation of the solar system begin.

Well, this is popular among Hero players but is inaccurate.

GURPS is based on "The Fantasy Trip" which predates Hero
(GURPS drew ideas from Hero, though Hero probably also
drew ideas from TFT).  GURPS contains things that Hero
doesn\'t and the main difference is that it doesn\'t to
in for a meta system.  It is not a "cut back version"
of Hero.

Bruce,

I would agree with except for the *hole(s)* your argument/interpretation
opens up, ie a 50Mj laser turret laser has the same *traversing* mechanism
that a 150m long 1500Mj Particle accelerator has. The *mechanism* to fine
*deflect*/tune the spinal PA beam will require much more power, magnets
etc. Also would not a Meson gun need a totally different method(s) to fine
defection of its beam, than say X-ray laser?

In FFS does not the beam pointer determine the weapons *effective* range?

Does not each MFD require a beam pointer? if so then why would you need a
beam pointer for each weapon if that MFD\'s laser battery only fires as a
battery?

I was referring to weapons grouped into batteries like say 10 50Mj lasers
with one MFD with one Beam Pointer. Result a savings on the cost of 9
additional beam pointers.

I have always thought the all *traversing* methods(fine and corse) were in
the mass, volume and costs of the weapons and its mount.

Water Found on Saturn Moon

L O N D O N,   April 7 - Europe\'s infrared space observatory has
discovered water in many unexpected places-including a moon of
Saturn-raising expectations of life elsewhere in the universe.
   The discovery of water vapor in the atmosphere of Titan, Saturn\'s
largest moon, may indicate that conditions there duplicate those that
gave birth to life on Earth, said Roger Bonnet, director of science for
the European Space Agency. 


ObTrav:  A misjump places the PCs in a star system without a gas giant
with just enough fuel to reach one of two planetary bodies, neither of
which has a breathable atmosphere.

Now they have to dust off their rusty scientific skills to figure out
which one has the greatest amount of water available (if any) using
the ship\'s outdated sensors.

Bruce,

Ok this opens up some other *hole(s)* by your interpretation.

If the main sensor array is accurate enough to get a FCS(fire control
solution) and provide the data to bring the weapon to *bear* and *engage*
the target why have a second sensor, that is not as accurate as the main
sensor array, second guess it. 


Would not the main sensor array have the greater sensitivity and resolution? 

Or are you saying that the beam pointer and the main sensor equal in
sensitivity and resolution?

What happens if the main sensor and the beam pointing sensor disagree? To
which one will the weapon *adjust* its fire? Since now you have two
different and separate *feedback loops*.

IRL a beam pointer is used to provide a *constant* *accurate* target data
update that the ship\'s main sensor  may not be able to provide in a manner
needed by the firing weapon, and in a as needed basis to provide a source
of *illumination* of a target for semi active homing. Todays ships main
detection sensors do not have the resolution for some weapon systems to
accurately *engagement*. This is due to the properties of RF in an
atmospheric conditions.

From many discussions with yourself and others the futuristic sensor arrays
will not have todays limitations. The only two types of beam pointers that
I would see for use in the future would be for use in missile guidance ie
SA homers, and for use in short range Point defense roles. But with a
future SOTA main sensor array these two uses may not be needed.

But one clarification I would like to see in the next FFS would be
different types of mounts for use in starships. Ie a Point Defense weapon
would have different needs in a weapon mount and traversing mechanisms than
a spinal mount or a bay mount.

Well, this is popular among Hero players but is inaccurate.

GURPS is based on "The Fantasy Trip" which predates Hero
(GURPS drew ideas from Hero, though Hero probably also
drew ideas from TFT).  GURPS contains things that Hero
doesn\'t and the main difference is that it doesn\'t to
in for a meta system.  It is not a "cut back version"
of Hero.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Tsk tsk tsk...I did say it was "not" a Champions rip-off,
didn\'t I? <g>

There are few cross-genre role-playing game systems. 
The Fantasy Trip and Chaosium\'s "House System"
(as seen in Runequest, Stormbringer, and Call
of Cthulu) come to mind, as does RoleMaster (which
I have almost zero clue about). I\'ve only read a little bit
of GURPS, but in execution, style and even concept
it seems much closer to Hero System than to any other
cross-genre system I\'ve seen - including it\'s own ancestor,
The Fantasy Trip. I\'m not saying it\'s a bad thing, and note
that not even in jest did I call it a cheap rip-off - if it was a 
rip-off of Hero System, it was a much better supported,
better marketed and more expensive, er, _extensive_
one.... <g>

BTW, I\'ve identified TFT as a cross-genre system (even though
it was a fantasy game) because the system was generic enough
to allow robots and electronic security systems to function 
well (what was that TFT adventure - Research Station Something?).
Perhaps in that same vein I should call AD&D a cross-genre system,
due to the laser guns, robots and such in the _Expedition to the
Barrier Peaks_.

Berserkers, or other really big combat robots) IYTU?

Fantasy Trip was the precursor to Dungeons and Dragons.  I remember
playing it in a group, hardly seemed like modern day GURPS at all..Maybe
in the dice mechanics..Is that what you mean?

I\'ve GM\'d/played RoleMaster/SpaceMaster, and while I have to say I LOVE it,
I also have to point out that it has many flaws.  First, the new "Standard
System" is so huge and convoluted and filled with charts that flipping
through the basic rules would frighten away all but the most die-hard
gamers.  In a market where RPG\'s are streamlining and trying to become more
"user friendly," I.C.E. is going the opposite route.  Second, while the
(dozens of) crit tables are fun, fun, fun, they (and the combat system in
general) seem geared towards humanoid-to-humanoid combat, and break down
quickly when applied to non-humanoids.  ("A critical!  You shatter the
squid\'s knee--um, uh . . .")  On a final note, creating a character,
especially with the new rules, can take HOURS, making character death
untenable.

But . . . what can I say?  I love the system.  For me, the more
charts/dice/tables, the better.  Hell, I love Powers & Perils (any
old-timers remember THAT math-textbook-disguised-as-a-game?)  And it\'s one
of the last systems where you get thousands of experience points!  ;-)

One way of looking at it is that the main sensor tells you which way the
target is - while the beam pointer tells you which way your weapon is 
actually pointing (by taking an image of a starfield looking along 
the launch optics of the laser.) This saves you from having to build mechanical
mounts for big lasers that are accurate to nanoradians open-loop and lets
you use closed-loop fire control.

I don\'t think so.

There\'s certainly nothing in FFS1 to support this interpretation - i would
read it that a battery requires 10 lasers (each with their own pointer)
and one MFD (with no pointer but with its own dedicated sensor.)

This, on the other hand, is a very good point; all I can imagine is that
it\'s a simplification.

Yes! Well, once in college. Definitely an interesting run. The only guy
to figure out what was going on was a real quiet type who played a
scientist/historian and always let everyone else lead. Seems he was
the only one to read Keith Laumer\'s Bolo series (hey, the rest played
D&D). I remember, when I used a description straight from one of 
Laumer\'s books, he jumped up, knocking over his drink,
with a look of absolute horror on his face and yelled "ARE YOU
F****ING NUTS?!?"

I think it was the first time we ever heard him cuss. Regardless,
once he explained the situation to the others, he became
designated leader and did a pretty decent job. Truly one of my finer
moments as a GM.

Dungeons and Dragons was released in 1974, designed by Gary Gygax and Dave
Arneson.  Melee, the Microgame that was the first part of TFT, was released
in \'76 or \'77, IIRC.  This was followed by Wizard, then In The Labrynth.
All fo these were designed by Steve Jackson.  When Metagaming went flop, he
tried to take TFT with him, but only could get the rights to the concpets,
not the name.  So GURPS was born.

I\'m sure Loren will check with Evil Stevie himself to correct any places I
got this wrong.

a pdf file from hyperbooks.com) as an intermediate conversion between 
detailed ships (High Guard or FFS) and IS.  Interesting fights can be 
fought using Slag!, with large scale (or forgone conclusions) being 
resolved with the IS system.  I have not started an serious work on the 
conversion process.

The problem with all the above is that you end up with loads of "house 
rules" (either from me or other people) and so may deviate from 
yet-to-be-published canon systems for resolving combat with FFS 2 
ships.

  I beg to differ.  Spell checkers bite.  What it needs is the good ol\' trusty
red pencil proof reader!  And more than one.  And not the author!  No offense.
You need cold eyes to catch the mistakes.

BTW, I volunteer to proof read stuff if anyone needs it.  I\'ve made a few
dollars here and there doing that.  And the consequences for such mistakes in
my near-profession (law) are very high.

 I have heard it described thus: American aircraft designer\'s assume that if
 the pilot is pulling back on the yoke _real_ hard, he wants to go up _real_
 bad, and the control surfaces respond accordingly.

 Boeing has a reputation for this sort of stuff, dating back to WWII, when
 B-17s were put through some remarkable hoops. I keep running across rumors of
 a pilot pulling an Immelman with a B-17, but have never found solid proof.

My reasoning goes like this:

If you use the entry point as the reference frame, then you have the
target moving in various ways. But if you chose to use the *exit* point
(relative to the target *star*) as the reference frame, it\'s much
easier to deal with some things. For one, your drift with respect to
the target planet is easier to handle (if not to figure).

There really isn\'t much in the rules themselves - 

Pocket Empires, p. 41:

"The average [annual] earnings of one labor factor (100,000,000 people) are
one trillion credits.  To figure out the value of a RU in a particular
planet\'s currency, divide 1,000,000,000,000 by the number of RU\'s that one
labor factor produces in a year (TL * 0.1 * Resources Available *
Infrastructure).  To get it in MCr use 1,000,000 instead of 1 trillion."

Note that those are local credits, which are used to purchase locally
manufactured ships.  For imported ships or tech, you have to convert to the
currency at the world of origin.

Imperial Squadrons, p. 9, 12:

"Optionally, a Billion or Trillion Credit Squadrons Campaign may be tied to
a specific set of pocket empires, in which case the military budget must be
converted to Credits using the Pocket Empires supplement."

Don\'t know if this will help, but here are some Rules of Thumb I use for
estimating fleet sizes and so on.  These are based on analysis of the
standard ship designs, maintenance and construction rules, plus some
assumptions about design philosophy:

Shipyard Capacity (in tons) = Population/1000 [from TCS, p. 33]

Navy Construction Budget  = Annual naval budget * 10 [also from TCS]
   [10% of your fleet must be at one tech level lower than current]

Total Fleet Size (in tons) = Shipyard Capacity * 10
   [2% annual maintenance, 7% replacement after 40 years ammortization, 1%
new build]
   [Includes both merchant shipping and navy]

Cost per ton = Cr 500,000 (naval vessels)
               Cr 250,000 (armed merchantmen)
               Cr 200,000 (unarmed merchantmen)

Crew per ton = 0.050 (naval vessels and armed merchantmen)
               0.025 (unarmed merchantmen)

Merchantmen carry 50% of their tonnage in cargo.

So, if you want to know the total tonnage of your navy, divide your naval
construction budget by MCr 0.5.  Whatever is left from your total fleet
size is merchant shipping.  Fleet auxiliaries (tankers, scouts, etc.) use
merchantmen values for cost and crew.

He\'s using what\'s pretty standard usage in the AI community. For things
like "learning" a neuron has specific properties that are fairly easy
to model. They are more complex than "on/off" but less complex than
worrying about various chemical balances.

And like humans have the potential to make the "wrong" decision. 

BTW, we *do* know how neural networks learn. It\'s just that in the real
world, a *lot* of the connections have been "pre-wired" by evolution.
That makes a *big* difference.

There are two schools of thought about this. 

1. The general public doesn\'t care.
2. NASA could make *sex* boring.

I consider it *criminal* that NASA and Congress together managed to
*throw away* the technology that got us to the moon *and* managed to
screw around until we lost Skylab as well.

Of course a good chunk of this can be laid at Nixon\'s door. Since he
didn\'t originate the program he was quick to dismantle it as soon as
the opportunity presented itself.

The "Harvard Business School" mindset that\'s led to the lack of long
range planning in US companies is starting to come under fire. But it
still has a *lot* to answer for.

Precursor to Dungeons and Dragons?  TFT came out in 1977 or so.  D&D came
out 74 or 75.

But goods are worth what people believe they are worth.  Suppose that your
TL 6 planet were to make contact with the newly formed Imperium.  They
indicate that they will just be bringing in the really valuable things
at first but that in a decade or two they will be bringing in the grav
cars, supercomputers & other things you do not have.  Suddenly
everything you can buy now has a lower perceived worth because it is
inferior to the high tech goods coming later.  You reduce your marginal
spending.  Companies cut their production as their inventories pile up
& cash flow worsens.

So far we have the start of a the normal down side of the business
cycle.  It is now 5 years later & demand for consumer goods is
starting to pick up, but it is demand for high tech importeds goods
not the (relative) crap your local companies can make.  The local
companies cash flow stays poor.  Pretty soon you will have the
planetary economy in a depression.  The only thing stopping your
whole economy from falling apart is the fact that some of your 
planets factories are kept busy making lots of TL 6 goods which 
you use to pay for your TL 12 imports.  The Imperium then sells 
your goods on the neighboring TL 3 world.

No the local money is worth what people think it is worth.  If you 
can\'t buy grav cars with local currency but can with hard currency 
Imperial Credits you may well quit your job in the TL 6 widget 
factory and become a maid or prostitute to the TL 12 Imperials who 
pay you in Imperial Credits.  You can than take these Imperial 
Credits to the "hard currency only" store the Imperials have set 
up on your planet for the benefit of their starport workers & buy 
the cool TL 12 goods you want.  If trade is still in its early 
stages you may not be able to go to a store but (if the price 
is right) you may be able to buy the clothes right off the 
Imperial Merchants back (the way Levis used to be sold behind 
the Iron Curtain).

So if you need to get to 100 diameters of the house before you can
engage the drive does this mean that all Traveller players need to live
at the top of a hill ?  I live at the bottom of a hill, at an elevation
of about 15 feet above sea level, & am somewhat concerned about this :)

Another question that\'s been bugging me:  is there a way to figure out how
long a planet\'s day is?

And my final question.  If a world is the satellite of a gas giant, is
there a way to figure out the average temperature, or how much sunlight it
will receive?  Will it receive any sunlight at all when it\'s on the
opposite side of the gas giant.  That may sound kind of stupid, but I\'m
just not sure of how that works.

I think that he means that all Imperials from most planets would have
(for example) Rapid Healing (5 points), Fit (5 points), Cool (1 point),
Disease Resistant (5 points) (Total Cost 16 points) for free as part of
the "Imperial Human" package deal.  People from low tech planets who had
not had their anscenstors DNA played with would then have the 16 point
disadvantage - No Imperial Package Deal.

This would be in addition to the Primitive disadvantage and the
Barbarian Social Stigma they might have as well.

In the "Real World" lots of athletes find themselves washed up at age 25
(Olympic Gymnasts even earlier) even if they avoid injury.  I do not
have any problem arguing that Traveller aging rolls start to _late_ not
too soon.  In prefered the GDW House system under which aging rolls were
made on a d10 against your charecteristic & you had to roll the stat or
over or suffer a point of loss.  So a 25 year old (or whatever age it
used) Str 10 Dex 10 Con 10 athlete would have to roll 10\'s on all 3 dice
& would have literally only one chance in a thousand of being the man he
was yestersday stat wise.  Conversely a 25 year old Str 2 Dex 2 Con 2
couch potato would have little chance of suffering aging lossses.

Well, it\'s been YEARS since I read the original series of "Berserker"
books, but essentially they are probably what inspired the "BORG" from
Star Trek.  I don\'t remember a lot of details from the books however.

The problem is that most of the stuff you list is TL9-10, not TL12. If a
merchant shows up with a heap of TL9 grav plates, TL10 computers etc, then
your people will trade with him - the fact that his low-orbit grav cars are
50% bigger than Mr Imperial\'s doesnt matter a lot if they too can boost
your Soyuz into low-planet orbit, from where it can make it\'s way to the
moon under it\'s own power.

Demand by a world for imported hi-tech goods has a severe limit - the
amount of hard currency a world can get through exports.

The other possibility, given free-ish capital flows (which the ZSC
implicitly assumes will not exist) is offplanet interests do an equity
swap, in exchange for upgrading your TL from 6 to, say, 8 (not horrifically
expensive in PE). TL8 is close enough to the \'standard\' interstellar TL of
10 or 11 to be able to be vaguely competetive in the trade stakes.

For example, TL8 fission plants and det lasers are functionally identical
to the higher-tech models, and if your exchange rate is low enough then TL8
beam pointers and sensors start to become tempting as well.

Once your world is TL8, it will be able to build enough stuff that other
planets will want to be able to afford enough hi-tech goods to keep the
boom going.

You will also get the Resources boost from being able to exploit the other
worlds of your system.

If Imperials need to buy anything from the planet, then you will have an
exchange rate. Then it is merely a matter of price ...

My view of the Imperium is that a major export of the lo-tech worlds will
be people, especially into the Imperial services with pensions. Doing 20
years in the IN to get a Cr4000 pension isnt a good deal for a Sylean
factory worker earning Cr12000 a year, but it\'s well worthwhile for someone
from some iceball on the frontier with an average income of a thousand
Imperial credits a year each. An implication of this is a class-ridden Navy
- - the officers are upper-class Syleans doing it out of duty or as a way of
seeing the universe before a job with Dada\'s firm, while the other ranks
are from the poor and underdeveloped worlds of the Imperial fringe.

Heh!  If you think the Borg are bad, the Berserkers are worse.  They
don\'t assimilate you, they slaughter you!!  Typical tactic is simply to
arrive in orbit over a planet, then pound the surface into a miles deep
radioactive morass of lava and steam.  Or drop a biological bomb.  Or
cause the sun to go nova.  If a Berserker does take a prisoner, they are
usually horribly altered, or they might become a sort of apostle of
death, serving the machine willing if they are twisted enough.  Their
ships are the size of Manhattan Island, or larger.

I love OGRE, I still play PBEM when I can.  There has long been a  war on
the OGRE mailing list (send subscribe to hcobb@io.com, Henry Cobb runs
this list by hand!!!!) about whether the OGRE universe (Ogreverse) can be
home to an rpg.  I\'m presently seriously considering starting such a
campaign, set in the future of the present Ogre miniatures timeline. 
Basically, Mankind finally gets its act together and heads out for the
stars, only to find threats that require the re-birth of the OGRES.  I\'m
presently attempting to configure an OGRE Mk V using FFS2 as a design
system.  The BPC (bi-phase carbide) armor is something I have to model in
Trav terms, but the use of rail-guns (mass drivers) and mini tac-nukes
(collapsing rounds) already exist in FFS2.   Any other OGRE players out
there?

I never actually used Ogres IMTU.  As they seem to be way out of canon,
I was anticipating using them either as a research project gone haywire

look pretty good on T-shirts if you happen to have a color printer
which can make transfers (just don\'t sell them; they\'re copyrighted).
They also make pretty decent wallpaper for Windows.

Hm.  Doesn\'t it, though?  As I recall, when you design a squadron, tech
level has an impact on the squadron\'s factors.  Therefore, a tech-12 
BatRon would end up weaker than a tech-15 BatRon.  That would abstract
away the need for any further TL comparison during fleet combat.

indicate that they will just be bringing in the really valuable things
at first but that in a decade or two they will be bringing in the grav

everything you can buy now has a lower perceived worth because it is
inferior to the high tech goods coming later.  You reduce your marginal
spending.  Companies cut their production as their inventories pile up
& cash flow worsens.

Here is what I see about this discussion.  The T6 planet that just made
contact with the imperium knows some really cool high tech gear is on the
way and also it knows it is really expensive.  But this does not mean the
whole planet will know.  Probably just a select few because advertising is
really expensive (just look at some of our world\'s prices-this would be
worse at lower tech levels.)  More than likely, the head or heads of the
planet will meet together with the really big corporations to decide what
technology to buy and to discuss problems with the alliance.  They would
probably even go over the idea that the new items will reduce the value of
their items.  They will make plans to handle the situation. Some steps they
could take are:

1. Limit the amount of information spread to the common people.
2. Add strict import controls and high tax to the imperium goods.
3. Limit the distribution channels for the imperium goods.  They could even
insist that only their planet\'s compaines can sell imperium goods-This keeps
resources on the planet while maximizing exports.  AKA business is booming.
4. Find other traders and do some comparison shopping.  There is enough
greedy people in the galaxy willing to do this.  Also when the news that a
new planet is open for trade, a lot of people will have visions of getting
rich quick.  Including, the sellers of stolen things.

And while they stifle the flow of imperium goods they do every thing in
their power to gain technology advances.  Including #4 of the above.

So far we have the start of a the normal down side of the business
cycle.  It is now 5 years later & demand for consumer goods is
starting to pick up, but it is demand for high tech importeds goods
not the (relative) crap your local companies can make.  The local
companies cash flow stays poor.  Pretty soon you will have the
planetary economy in a depression.  The only thing stopping your
whole economy from falling apart is the fact that some of your
planets factories are kept busy making lots of TL 6 goods which
you use to pay for your TL 12 imports.  The Imperium then sells
your goods on the neighboring TL 3 world.

Okay, five years down the road.  There is probably only a limited demand for
some imperium goods.  You have to remember the planet controls the
advertising and distribution channels and have more than likely advanced
their tech level through legal or illegal means.  All and all, Business has
never been better.
   But couldn\'t the imperium go around local channels.  Sure, but then the
local companies generate propaganda  "Mom and children vaporized while using
black-market food processor"  " Minister of Trade declares major safety
proplems found on new tech items from imperium"  Etc.  Basically they know
their planet much better than outsiders and have the resources to work with.


No the local money is worth what people think it is worth.

And what the people think is highly influenced by advertising and news.  If
the common person doesn\'t know that the imperium has these nice goodies, how
can he or she buy them.

No, they are worth whatever people are willing to pay for them, which isn\'t
quite the same thing. If you have 100 customers for 100 cars and some joker
brings in 100 grav cars to sell for about the same as you wanted for your
cars, then they are suddenly worthless. But if someone introduces a single
grav car, then your cars are still worth pretty much the same. And if
someone brings in 100 grav cars and sell them for 10 times what you want
for your cars, you\'d still be able to sell quite a few of your cars. If
the grav car cost 1000 times as much, you can propably sell almost all
your cars anyway.

Percieved worth? Relative to what? "I have bad news and I have good news.
The bad news is that your money is now worth only half as much as yesterday.
The good news is that all prices are halved."

>You reduce your marginal spending. Companies cut their production as their

Just as people refrain from buying computers because they know beyond a
shadow of a doubt that they can get a better one for the same money in
another 6 months? People will still prefer a car today rather than a grav
car in 20 years. Besides, goods are only a part of a planet\'s wealth.
Other parts are the food produced and the services rendered, neither of
which can very readily be saved up for a rainy day.

That most certainly depends on the relative cost of the "crap" and the high
tech goods.

Since there is no way you can import enough to cover the demands of an
entire world (I\'m assuming a sizable population here), you will still
have a lot of factories making goods for your citizens.


Remember, you can only exchange your TL 6 goods for TL 12 goods if you can
find a buyer who is willing to exchange TL 12 goods for TL 6 goods. And
the only way your buyer can recoup his investment is to physically pick
up your goods, load them onto a spaceship, and fly them to some place
where he can find someone willing to exchange them for something that is
worth more to the buyer than the original loaqd of TL 12 goods. Certainly
the Imperial can buy many shiploads of TL 6 goods for a single load of
TL 12 goods, but they still need to remove all those shiploads of TL 6
goods and realize their value somewhere else. It will take a lot of
spaceship tonnage to rape even a single a world of a significant part
of its raw material wealth.

>The Imperium then sells your goods on the neighboring TL 3 world.

Assuming they can find a TL 3 world with something they want to sell. And
they still have to move the TL 6 goods to the TL 3 world and then move
whatever they got on the TL 3 world home.

The worth of a currency is established by what you can buy with it. If you
introduce more money into a system, you get inflation because you have
more money for the same amount of goods and services. If you remove money
you get deflation. If you have an accounting system that prevents the
removal or introduction of money, you have a system immune to inflation
and deflation (well, on the money side; change in the amount of goods and
services produced will also have similar effects). However, inflation and
deflation dosen\'t change the amount of wealth in the system, just how it
is distributed.

Sure, but the Imperial credits are worth even less than the local unless
you CAN buy grav cars with them. Which again requires the existence of a
spaceship to ship it in. And when you ship in TL 12 goods you introduce
wealth into the system just as you remove wealth by shipping out TL 6
goods.

If you use Accrete, it tells you this stuff. However, any satellite of a gas
giant would need artificial environments.  It would most likely be tidally
locked to the GG (one face always points at the GG) thus its day and "year"
would be the same.  This would be at least a month I think, and probably alot
longer the farther out you go.  The result would be extreme heat on the sunny
side for half the year followed by extreme cold.  The inner surface would be
cold all the time with just a few glimpses of the sun each year (either the GG
would block it or it would be facing the wrong direction.)

There is a great book called "World Building, a Science Fiction Writer\'s

Apologies; it was recommended to me on this list and I cannot remember who

>Another question that\'s been bugging me:  is there a way to figure out how
>long a planet\'s day is?

I seem to recall that this is in the Scouts sequence.  I also seem to
remember (from the source above) that the older a solar system is the more
likely a planet is to be "tidally locked", i.e. on face always towards the
planet its orbiting (which our moon is; we always see the same side).

It doesn\'t sound stupid to me, I don\'t really know.  As a guideline
however, think of how rare lunar eclipses are on Earth.  Also note that the
earth casts two "grades" of shadow on the moon; The Umbra and Penumbra.
The Penumbra borders the Umbra and is somewhat less dark (I think it has to
do with refracted light passed through the earth\'s atmosphere).

As for temperature; Don\'t gas giants form in cooler (relatively) reaches of
the solar system?

Since the majority of character will probably be Imperials, I\'d avoid using
a generic package deal for them.. they are the baseline.

Since the IISS deals with odd planets on a semi-constant basis, I can see
giving them Immunity to Disease and Rapid Healing as part of their package
deal.  When it comes to longevity and healing, GURPS covers that by slowly
increasing the age where deterioration starts and raising the effectiveness
of medical treatment.  (GURPS pg 128 and G:Space)

Primitive only applies if you start out as a primitive.  If the default
GURPS TL for the Imperium is 10 (what I figure it to be), and your
character is from a tech-7 world with no advanced equipment, you\'d get a 15
point disadvantage.  As you gained hi-tech goodies, you\'d have to pay off
those points.

It helps to recall that all of those nebula are a *better* vacuum than

more intense "solar wind". They aren\'t apt to do much.

  He\'s using what\'s pretty standard usage in the AI community. For things
  like "learning" a neuron has specific properties that are fairly easy
  to model. They are more complex than "on/off" but less complex than
  worrying about various chemical balances.

I agree, it\'s pretty standard in the AI community.  The AI community
generally recognizes that an artificial neuron which outputs f(x1, x2,
x3...), where x1-xn are the inputs, is an _approximation_ of what a
biological neuron does.  It happens to be "good enough" to do some
intelligent-seeming behavior.  But on a larger scale, we don\'t know if
other biological effects are important, and often we completely
neglect temporal delays in order to simplify the artificial networks
the point where we can deal with them.
  
  BTW, we *do* know how neural networks learn. It\'s just that in the real
  world, a *lot* of the connections have been "pre-wired" by evolution.
  That makes a *big* difference.

We know a way to make artificial neural networks approximate a
function, under certain limitations on the function and certain
limitations on the network.  That doesn\'t mean we know how biological
networks actually learn.

Example (and it\'s been a couple years since I took that neural
networks course, so forgive me any minor inaccuracies): Assume each
artificial neuron has a slight delay and there is feedback.  Keep it
simple - the last layer\'s output is connected to the first layer\'s
input.  You can write out the equations for backpropogation, the
common learning method.  However, because of the feedback these
equations are no longer simple enough that I would believe they would
be implemented by naturally occuring biological systems.

Hence, I believe we haven\'t figured out how biological systems really
learn.

  And like humans have the potential to make the "wrong" decision. 

Gets better than that, actually -- once you train the system, you can
copy it.  Now each copy has the potential to make the same wrong
decision.  OBTRAV: I would imagine criminals could make use of this.

I don\'t have a reliable source for this story, but it\'s funny and
semi-relevant so I\'ll pass it on anyway. :>

I once heard about an experiment with an autonomous vehicle which was
being tested outdoors.  Because of an error in its programming, it
plotted a course which ran over a bush, rather than avoiding it.

The researchers involved found an error which would result in this
behavior and corrected it, put the vehicle back, and were mildly
surprised when it promptly ran over the bush again.

Some head-scratching and a few more tries ensued, with the vehicle
continuing to run over the defenseless bush.  It turns out that they
had gotten the bugs out, but the initial collision had flattened the
bush to the point where the sensors no longer considered it an
obstacle and through the bush _was_ the optimal path to its programmed
destination.

No, it has to do with the fact that the sun isn\'t a point source of
light. The umbra is the are where you can\'t see *any* of the sun. The
penumbra is the area where you can see only *part* of the sun.

In *our* solar system. But there\'s nothing stopping them from being a
lot closer. They\'ve discovered a planet more massive than Jupiter
orbiting another star closer than Mercury orbits the sun!

Check the orbital periods for the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.
They are around a *week* (4-10 days). Remember, because the primary is
so massive, they have to orbit a lot faster. As an example, on of
Jupiters moons has the same size orbit as the moon. But instead of 29.5
days, it orbits in *3* days!

The gas giant won\'t block the sun except during a small portion of the
orbit. You might get an hour worth of eclipse out of an orbit that
lasts a week. Sure, the gg is big, but the orbits are *really* big.

>They will make plans to handle the situation. Some steps they
>could take are:

>1. Limit the amount of information spread to the common people.
If the planet has any sort of free-trade at all this will be impossible.
The Imperium has _scads_ of money. They can buy as much advertising space
as they want. In the sort of scenarios we played out it was worth the
Imperium _giving away_ a world\'s worth of transister radios, TVs or
Holo-Sets (depending on which had an order of magnitude more wow than what
they were using) and setting up orbital broadcasting stations.
Since bread and circuses have a great appeal to the population, any
government that tries very hard to stop their spread will not be popular
and subject to overthrow, with a little help from the Imperium. The
politicians will know this. They are far more likely to play along as long
as they can have loads of dosh to pad their pockets.

>2. Add strict import controls and high tax to the imperium goods.
Again, if they keep too much of the Bread and Circuses away from the
populace, they become unpopular, and life proceedes as above. High tax
won\'t bother the Imperium too much as long as they can subsidise it. Unless
they have laws about below-cost selling, but then re-run the above
scenario.
In certain circumstances it is good to have the government have a good
source of hard-currency. If they planet\'s government has no money, then
they need to use Imperial Aid to build up their Infrastructure to modern
levels. If they have money, then they can pay for it. In the latter case
they end up with less off-world debt (either moral or fiscal depending on
whether the aid was chairty or loans) but probably not by an order of
magnitude.

>3. Limit the distribution channels for the imperium goods.  They could
even
>insist that only their planet\'s compaines can sell imperium goods-
By the plan the Imperium should be doing this anyway. "Forming Strateigic
Partnerships." Half-native owned companies will want to make loads of money
as well and will petition their own government against any restrictions
that keep them from making what they might otherwise make.

>4. Find other traders and do some comparison shopping.
This one is right out. Milieu-0 is not the normal Imperium. Church and
State may be separate but Trade and Navy are not. The Imperial government
is, basically, Zhanustu Inc. The Navy is there totally to support the
trading interests. They aren\'t hands off like in 1100. If anyone the
Imperial Government disaproves of tries to trade in any quantity then the
Navy is there to stop them.

>There is enough greedy people in the galaxy ...
Which underlies much of my logic. Goverments will more likely adopt schemes
that make them richer. Politicans will more likely adopt schemes that put
more money in their pockets. People will support things that give them more
bread and circuses.
Cynical, absolutely, it is looks like the Real World to me. If you don\'t
want hand-lasers without powered backpacks, why would you want a universe
where it isn\'t money that makes the world go \'round?

Hard or soft. You pick.

And that\'s assuming the orbit is in the same plane as the gas giant\'s
orbit.  If the moons are tilted at all, then the gas giant will only
eclipse the sun on some orbits.

My astronomy is a little rusty, but don\'t large gas giants radiate heat?  A
satellite therefore might be warmed by the Gas Giant and also be very very
dark . . .

between:

        http://www.cybercity.com/blueroom/2space.htm

He is basically trying to describe how Merchant Adventurers (read: PCs) 
can survive economically in an SF setting, competing with huge 
megacorporations.  There are certain fundamental assumptions he makes 
about the universe: no (commonly-used civilian) FTL radio; many settled 
worlds; PC\'s ships are tramp freighters; the galaxy has shipping needs 
on average comparable to humans.  His numbers are based on a typical 
voyage between ports of 8-12 days...

Sound familiar?

It\'s incomplete, but it\'s worth a look...

I was just hit the site successfully, so they are still around (at least, as
much as the web site has been around lately...)

He occaisionally offers things, I don\'t know if he still is.  I do know that
there are auctions on the \'net that offer most of the material published - I\'ve
had pretty good luck collecting things this way.

WBH was produced by Digest Group Publications for MT (my copy is sitting in
front of me now, as I am gen\'ing up the system I will be using in my game
Friday).  It is well worth the money (as is virtually every Traveller supplement
put out by that much missed company.)

I find that it still produces results that fit very nicely into the scheme of
the game (MTU, anyway....)

I\'d be interested - and I could stick \'em on my web page (which is a bit
sparse at present).

Once, when I was feeling wild and crazy, I resolved a mercenary ticket using
OGRE and GEV. 

 Basically I let the players select the units, designate which vehicles their
PCs were in, and then adjusted the die rolls based on applicable skills
(leadership, tactics, hvy weapons, etc.)  It wasn\'t STRIKER, but it worked.  ;)

This Monday from MM himself I received the following:
The Traveller Book (Hardcover CT Books 1-3).
Book 4: Mercenary
Book 5: High Guard
Alien Encyclopedia (Alien Modules 1-7 (Aslan, K\'Kree, Vargr, Zhodani, Droyne,
Solomani, Hivers), Darrians, Alien Realms) in glorious hardcover with red ribbon
page-holder.
All in fantastic condition.

How can I get some goodies?  Well, in appreciation to Marc, I\'ll save him the
trouble and give you the list.

What follows is a list of different Traveller materials that have been available.
They are not all currently available.
(1)  Read the list.
(2)  Decide what items you are interested in.
(3)  Send Marc a polite request concerning the availability of items you desire.
(FarFutures@aol.com)
(4)  Wait patiently for Marc\'s response.  If your petition is deemed worthy, Marc
will reply to you on the availability of said items and quote a price on what
materials are available.
(5)  You send Marc money.
(6)  Marc sends you goodies.
(7)  You decide to faithfully support Traveller for the rest of your life, even if
prolonged by anagathics, but suspended for items released during low berth.  (Thats
a joke)

IIRC, the maps and Spinward Marches Campaign Module are out.

   NASA didn\'t fair well under Carter either.  The VP usally drives the Space
Program policy.  Mondale was never a NASA supporter and had tried to kill 
the Apollo program when he was a senator.

This is case in Cuba now.  Doctors and teachers get paid in Cuban Pesos.  
They can buy, if they are lucky and it\'s in stock, flour at the offical
state stores.

Waitresses, street artists, and prostitutes get paid in US Dollars.  They can go to
\'hard currency\' stores and buy just about anything you can get in a Miami supermarket.

The problem with reviewing the standard designs, is that the military
ships are at best paramilitary police ships compared to what should be
built using the design systems.

To make things worse, all the "civilian" ships are actually quasi-military
in function.

Looking back at the THUDDD designs, my guesses would be nearer:

Cost per ton = Cr 1,500,000 (naval vessels)
               Cr   100,000 (unarmed merchantmen)

Crew per ton = 0.05 (naval vessels)
               0.02 - 0.01 (merchantmen)

Merchantmen carry 50% of their tonnage in cargo
(possibly 66% if >1000std and jump 1).

don\'t bother with armed merchants, they are a waste of time as merchants
(too expensive) and can be taken out by a single heavy fighter against the
military. In fact there only use is as independant free traders or pirates
(if such exist :-)

Yep, That one was used in one of Niven-Pournelle\'s Mote novels.  
The superconductor was layered on the hull and then had one end running
into the ships water tank.  The water starts as ice, then melts and 
finally turns to steam.  However if you\'re hit continuously with 
high energy lasers, then it\'s really just a few extra seconds of life.
Once the water is converted to steam, the superconductor will begin
to dump heat into the hull underneath, and finally vaporize itself.
This would leave the unprotected hull.

Personally I believe that a black globe generator to be the better
option.

Hortalez et Cie!!!!! HORTALEZ ET CIE !!!!!
You don´t know Hortalez et Cie??????????
This man can´t be helped!

But seriously,
Hortalez et Cie is one of the biggest Companies in the Imperium, belonging to the select
class of MegaCorporations. Their business, is insurance, investment, and similar stuff!
So now you know. 
Cool that they really exist:
But, when were they founded? Was Traveller an inspiration to them, or they to Traveller?

Sometimes on this list, when somebody announces he has a bunch to sell. But also try
rec.games.marketplace (or so). I got a lot of stuff there too. (But then you deal with
REAL strangers (whereas the list is almost family!))
Another way to find oop´s is at http://www.titan-games.com 
(but watch out, some items are way overpriced (on the other hand, there must be people
paying THAT, so my ideas about prices might be a smidgeon off as well!))
And some peoples web pages also include sales offers.
(I believe Leroy still has stuff: http://ouray.cudenver.edu/~lwlguatn/)
	(But that was some time ago,so i don´t know what´s still left..)
Anyway, if you still can´t find an item, (and we mean really can´t find it!) ask for
photocopies on the list. This may or may not work, depending on our mood (us = TML), but
at least it´s not illegal 
(Marc gave his permission for OOP items that are unattainable).

And that´s about all i can think of!

Trav to Slag! already.  Definitely going to get the pdf file now.

Thanks for everybody\'s help

  You might try treating the warheads as plasma weapons, except the
small arms, point defense, and anti-personnel mounts would still be
beam weapons.

  If the guns are firing (high?) velocity shells as the rules indicate,
a warhead with a small heavy hydrogen fusion device (superconducting
trigger, FASA grav<-handwave> trigger?) would fit well enough into the
Traveller universe. At least your planet doesn\'t have to hire half the
Nuclear Dampers in the sector to clean up afterwards.

  Supposedly graphite has some desirable characteristics for defeating
high energy beam attacks, so you handwave an advanced laminate or 
ceramic-metal composite with a carbon base. <flap-flap>

  This would also give an excuse for hideous armour vs energy weapons
while retaining some vulnerability to more conventional weapons such
as solid penetrators, shaped or self-forging warheads, and falling off
of cliffs.

  You could do a lot of damage by going for specific materials. There
seems little question that the locals would trade fissionables for the
hard currency to buy Imperial fusion plants (and the direct electric
conversion hardware it seems to include*).

  If you really want to screw the locals in a subtle fashion, just
buy up lots of materials used in tool making, like tungsten and
industrial diamond. Simply increasing the cost substantially will
hose them in the short term, and you can always stop buying locally
once they\'ve invested in expanding production. You probably can\'t do
this with gold or silver, but I\'m sure that a materials engineer
could think of several other items (chromium?, anything the accessible
mantle is short of).

  Heck, you might be able to get the same effect by dumping said material
on the local market at the right times, and then withdrawing your supply
when the locals are underproducing (hey, buy up any closing mines!).

  *BTW, does anybody out there actually require an explicit thermal >
electric conversion step in their fusion plants, or assume that such
is there already (as opposed to assuming direct conversion)?

But we also don\'t know wether that planet is a gas giant - just that it is

  OK, but doesn\'t that bring into question how something that few people
do, and the vast majority don\'t, can "revolutionize the way we think?"

  I suggest that it has changed drastically, particularly in that we now
(in the West) expect (if not demand) change/progress. At the very least
our world-view has been remade by changes in the economic structure; I
assume that the TML has a very low population of illiterate subsistence
farmers.

  My suggestion is that it changed very few peoples worldviews directly.
The indirect changes it may have caused for Europes economic life were
of a greater order of effect.

  What we seem to be discussing is whether a capability (Jump Drive)
that would be available only to an extremely small portion of the
population can change the mind set of the human race in a way that
no previous (and arguably greater such change) has done. I would at
least agree that it is possible. I may be mistaken in concluding that
your point is that it _will_ do so.

  IIRC it\'s the cost of the lift vehicles that is most substantial;
a capability to do work in the outer reaches of the Earth-Luna system
will be very different and cost much more than a basic commercial
satelite bus. Given time the field should expand.

This is a task *way* beyond the capability of the IN. The problem is that
the initial contacts are likely to be insanely profitable - for example,
imagine a trader dropping in on Earth circa 1970, and saying "I have two
dozen cubic meters of anti-grav plates. They wont get you beyond orbit, but
they\'ll save you from using those Saturn 5 things. All I want is you to
build thirty TL7 12 MW  nuclear reactors in sealed containers that can be
operated in vacuum, and enough radioactives to run each of them for 2 years."

According to FFS2 prices, the trader is selling Cr10 000 or so worth of TL9
contragrav for sixty megacredits worth of fission plants, plus 90 cubic
meters of radioactives (itself worth MCr 6.75 or so). The TL7 power plants,
while primitive, will sell well to Belters and such - they put out power,
are simple to maintain and are being sold dirt cheap.

Now, is this a good deal for any of Terra\'s superpowers ? Hell yes. You get
to cut the cost of the space program to fractions of a percent, in exchange
for switching your nuclear reactor program for nuke attack subs to
for-export for five years or so.

Is this a good deal for our hypothetical Free Trader ? Assume they sell the
reactors to TL9 Belter colonies as emergency backups for one-third of their
book price - they get MCr 20 for their Cr10 000 worth of contragravity.
Hey, thats a third of the cost of your ship ...

Now, given this, to stop this the IN will need to leave a squadron in orbit
above the world. And whats the cost of that ?

Precisely my point. Your cynicism is extending well beyond what the
existing economic rules (most definitly including PE and all that chunky
price data in FFS2) support.

clarify the result of the lively Terra TL debate from last summer.

JTAS 20, p20
 "It is known for instance, that the Imperium was at tech level 14
during the Solomani Rim War, and that the Solomani Confederation
was able to get some tech 14 equipment, but was equipped mostly
with tech 13(Invasion Earth)."

  This corresponds with the complete lack of TL: 15 troops in
Invasion: Earth. I:E explicitly refers to Traveller TL\'s (it\'s
one of their stats, and probably the second most important one).

  Also, just this February, the following information was posted
by He-Whom-With-It-Is-Extremely-Awkward-To-Argue-Canon.

>MILIEUX
>Date 	Name                  Max TL

>1100 3I	Late Imperium	        15			
>1120 3I	Rebellion	        15

  Presumably that really clears up the TL debate. Admittedly, it does
brings up the issue of Solomani wishful thinking, either in terms of
military capabilities/potentials or the Imperiums political will (that
is, "Munich syndrome" in expecting the 3I to accept the fait accompli
of conquest of territory rightfully belonging to the Sphere).

Solid rockets. You know, the kind that boosts the shuttle the first part,
Fire and forget about turning them off kinda thingies.

The most criminal of all such acts however was the abandonment of the NERVA
rocket engine. If they had put such devices in orbit we\'d be on mars by
now. The main reason for not doing long manned flights is the pesky Isp of
chemical engines.

ObTrav: Whenever the players wonders why planet X with TL Y isn\'t using
item z with TL Y+1, just remind them that we\'re at TL 7 or 8 but are still
using TL 5-6 engines for spaceflight at GREAT cost and for no apparent
reason.

IMTU fusion plants generate energy by slowing a rapidly spinning plasma
torus thus doing direct conversion. As the excess heat, heatsink
requirements already make Traveller fusion plants "handwavy" in starships
talking about generators etc will only make these problems easier to spot
for my players.

Sure, if El Presidente or anyone else in power flies an Air/Raft it would
sure make planetary news very quickly.  But the news could officially
appended or even put out in advance.  Such as "Mark 10 Industries announces
the development of a new plane, the Air Raft.  The Air Raft provides
unbelievable safety to powered flight.  So safe, that it could be the next
car you put in your garage.  For more information, call Mark 10 Industries
customer reps at 555-RAFT"  And sure, the phones would ring off the hook.
But when the average person finds out the AIR Raft costs the same as buying
five or six houses because they are not fully developed, that customer will
soon lose interest.  Indeed, even if they could afford it, the vehicle would
have to be registered much like a car is today.
  I am sure you could say that another company could sell them for less but
if the planetary tax is what has the price jacked up, the price wouldn\'t be
that much better.

I think the planet would be happy to trade.  The trader sells to Mark 10 in
bulk and Mark 10 distributes them to the customers.  As long as everyone is
making money, everyone is happy.  Along the way the company can try to
influence the trader to sell it tech info and advanced tools so they can
begin building the Air Raft.  But what if other companies want in?  They can
buy from Mark 10, since mark 10 holds the rights to develop the Air Raft.
If they buy direct from the Imperium, I think they would find themselves in
a world of hurt because they would be violating Mark 10\'s rights.

You might ask, why all tax?  To pay for the infrastructure upgrades needed.

Now that I gotten way off track, my original intent was to demonstrate that
the planetary government can and would take steps to prevent economic
disaster.  Unless the Imperium declared war on the planet, they would be
forced to deal with the government.  Just look at the relationship the U.S.A
has with Japan since world war II to see what I mean.

Actually, standard fusion plants generate heat which they convert to
electricity using regular ol\' steam turbines just like every other
kind of power plant.  There is a fusion reaction (T-T, I think) which
produces mostly electrons.  If you collected this in a big metal plate
and pulsed your reaction at 60Hz you\'d have direct conversion.

 I know real world(tm) fusion p-plants (whatever that is) are supposed to
do it with steam generators etc but the high TL Trav dito are too hard to
handwave if they\'re working this way. I remember reading somewhere about a
way to get electricity out of a real world(tm) fusion plant by making the
reaction speed up a rotating plasma torus and slowing it by induction.
Whatever, my players would probably never buy p-plants with normal
generators in Trav ships due to the already stupendous heat radiation
problem just from the actual electricity waste product.

But as they say about Trav universes; your mileage may vary.

Sigh.  Don\'t you guys get taught U.S. History in high school?
(non-U.S.  and non-French members of the TML are excused.)  I
quote (in part) from "Intelligence in the War of Independence":

===BEGIN-QUOTE
While the Committee of Secret Correspondence was meeting secretly in
Philadelphia with agents of France, Arthur Lee was meeting in London
with Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, the successful author of
"The Barber of Seville" (and later "The Marriage of Figaro")-who was a
French agent. Lee\'s inflated reports of patriot strength, which either
he fabricated for Beaumarchais\' benefit or were provided by Lee\'s
regular correspondent, Sam Adams, won the Frenchman to the American
cause. Beaumarchais repeatedly urged the French Court to give immediate
assistance to the Americans, and on February 29, 1776 addressed a
memorial to Louis XVI quoting Lee\'s offer of a secret long-term treaty
of commerce in exchange for secret aid to the war of independence.
Beaumarchais explained that France could grant such aid without
compromising itself, but urged that "success of the plan depends wholly
upon rapidity as well as secrecy: Your Majesty knows better than any
one that secrecy is the soul of business, and that in politics a
project once disclosed is a project doomed to failure."

With the memorial, Beaumarchais submitted a plan proposing that he set
up a commercial trading firm as a cover for the secret French aid; he
requested and was granted one million livres to establish a firm to be
known as Roderigue Hortalez et Cie for that purpose. Beaumarchais\'
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
memorial was followed by one of March 12, 1776, by the French Minister
of Foreign Affairs, the Comte de Vergennes. Royal assent was granted,
and by the time Silas Deane arrived in Paris, French aid was on its way
to the patriots. Deane expanded the Franco-American relationship,
working with Beaumarchais and other French merchants to procure ships,
commission privateers, recruit French officers, and purchase French
military supplies declared "surplus" for that purpose.
        [...]
Spain, at the urging of French Foreign Minister Vergennes, matched
France\'s one million livres for the operation of Hortalez et Cie. But
that was not the beginning of secret Spanish aid to the Patriots.
During the summer of 1776 Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga, the governor of New
Spain at New Orleans, had privately delivered some ten thousand pounds
of gunpowder, out of the King\'s stores, to Captain George Gibson and
Lieutenant Linn of the Virginia Council of Defense. The gunpowder,
moved up the Mississippi under the protection of the Spanish flag, made
it possible to thwart British plans to capture Fort Pitt.

Note; I don\'t think I have any spoilers here.

I\'m about halfway through it.  Many untidy departures from Traveller canon;
a far trader has a "screen" and the author has chosen to substitute "meson"
for "laser" when discussing its weapons, "Droyne" in place of "ancients"
and, in the book, the Droyne no longer exist.

On the other hand, the ship spends a week in jumpspace, IDs his ship as
"jump-2", there is a star-spanning Empire out there, starports are called
starports, the main character does all his ship related business in the
starport bar, the K\'kree have shown up (as carnivore hating bullies, who
can\'t stand the smell of the breath of carnivores even), as have Aslan, in
fairly accurate depictions (for my money).  Also the ancients (once you
realize he\'s not talking about contemporary chirpers) are as advertised.

There are important races in the book never mentioned in Traveller, the
planet names are, I think, non-canon places, the main character has an
ancient artifact(!) that he "picked up somewhere".

One of the first technologically related points of the story is that the
main character has "bought" the appearance and memories of someone else
(who has high drug debts) and laid claim to his Far Trader.  There are
times that its clear he is accessing some sort of "memory overlay".

I give it a C+ for traveller canon.  The writing is ok, but nothing to
email home about.  The story has me guessing, and I\'ve pretty well hooked
into it.  Altogether, not too bad.

Somewhat longer than that. Eclipses of Io last a couple of hours, and it\'s
in a (fast) close orbit. Something in a week-long orbit would have eclipses
that last about half a day. Of course, the farther out you are the more rare
eclipses are; they\'ll only occur during certain "eclipses seasons" when the
GG\'s equatorial plane is lined up right (twice per GG year, you\'d get a
period of a few months when you got an eclipse every orbit.)

This made me chuckle.  There are no \'standard\' fusion plants.  The three
American and handful of other experimental (hot) fusion reactors spread
about do not make any electricity.  The problem of converting heat to
electricity is not the current priority (no pun intended there).

There will probably be better "heat engines" that steam turbines at some
point (maybe now?), on the other hand, steam turbines are not too bad
themselves (if you ignore volume considerations).

The problem, in Magnetic Containment fusion, is that electrons, being
positively charged, cannot escape the magnetic containment bottle (or
torus, more accurately).  Neutrons do escape, and are very energetic when
they do.  Current designs (or maybe near future ones; I\'m not quite sure)
have a "Lithium Blanket" which, I think, will help to collect some of the
energy from the neutrons, perhaps to breed more tritium for the reactor.
All this is now more fuzzy than I thought it would be (Hey! I\'m a
bookkeeper, not a physicist!).

Perhaps this problem goes away when you use "inertial confinement" fusion,
but I think other problems pop up at that point.

actually, there are some reknowned fountain designers that have managed to
make laminar flow last a long time...they have a fountain that does a
beautiful arc of thirty or fourty feet across a plaza, and lands in a hole
about 1/4" larger in diameter than the fountain jet. Incredible!

They are also the designers responsible for the \'leapfrog\' fountain at
Disney World(Orlando), which uses the same technology, IIRC. small jets
leap from place to place in this large plaza, or straight up in the air,
at random intervals, kids love it, and having seen it on TV, I suspect
it\'ll turn anyone not dead into a kid again ;-) 

of course, this isn\'t with the velocity needed for cutting.

Of course, if you\'ve dipped that water bullet into LN2 before firing
it...heh heh heh.

We\'ve used liquid-air frozen crossbow bolts in various campaigns. They
find someone dead,  with a big hole in them, and maybe a little water in
the wound.

Oh, yeah...sure. That\'s why we have five or six commercial heavy lift
launch corporations out there right now. Oh, yeah, and all those Zero-Gee
fabs up in orbit.

Why not?? The market is there, there\'s a huge backlog of satellite
launches scheduled.

There are what, two, US companies claiming to be in the space business,
neither of whom have launched anything, and a string of failed ventures
in the past?

So who do we have: NASA, ArianeSpace, Russia and China. Japan\'s working on
their first orbital booster now, but if the market\'s so great, and it can
be done so much cheaper and faster than NASA, why isn\'t it being done?

After all, it\'s not like the commercialization of space is so new, andf
the technology _is_ really old stuff, as you say.

Probably because it _ain\'t_ as cheap or easy as you might believe.

yeah, there was a megamerchant designed like that some time ago, by Alvin
Plummera.

(It\'s up on some web site somewhere, Goeran\'s I think)

Here it is:
- ----

The MegaMerchants of the Imperium - merchant\'s over 100,000 Disp tons - 
is the mainstay of Imperial Commerce.  Owned and controlled by either the 
Imperial Government or the Megacorporations, these vessels are the 
lifeblood of the Imperium, transporting billion\'s of tons of goods from 
one Hi-pop world to another.

Practically all MegaMerchants are only to be found in the main body of 
the Imperium: only a handful exist in the Spinward Marches, none over 
200,000 disp tons.

The importance of MegaMerchants cannot be overestimated.  When the 
Imperium speaks of \'protecting interstellar commerce\', they are not 
talking of protecting 200 ton Beowolf free traders, but 5,000,000 ton Titan 
transports.  A major task of the Imperial navy is protecting these 
ships.  Even membership within the Imperium is related to the 
MegaMerchants: these ships are not permitted to visit nonImperial worlds 
(except,in special cricumstances, Imperial client states).  When 
politicans talk of the Imperium being a \'trade confederation\', they mean 
a confederation tied together partly by MegaMerchants. 

There are less than 8,000 MegaMerchants within the Imperium.  Most, like 
the \'George Bolme\' 200,000 ton class ships, are under the million-ton 
limit.  Of the 600 ships over the million-ton limit, over 2/3\'s are 
single jump, 5,000,000 disp ton Titan ships, devoted to a single large 
main like the Vilani or Core Main. Only about 200 ships are Majesta\'s: 
Jump4, 2G modular transports of over 2 million disp tons, these 
ships are of great importance to GSbAG (the MegaCorp who builds them), 
Tukera Lines LIC (The MegaCorp who runs them) and the Imperium.

These are the largest ships which follow the xboat routes, and thus the 
ships needed for \'long-haul, huge cargo\' situations.  They have been used 
to transport mile-long buildings from Vland to Capital, segments of grav 
cities from Solomani Rim to Antares, and entire fleets of smaller ships 
from Daibei to their Vargr buyers in the Marches.

An entire strain of Tukera Line corporate culture surrounds the 
Majestas\'. It was Majesta crews that started the Great Merchant Strike of 
904, (still the only Imperium-wide labour action in history) which froze 
the entire Imperial economy for two years and sent entire sectors into 
a decade-long depression. It was Majesta crews that were the first 
MegaMerchants allowed to carry a (limited) number of dependents onboard, 
for their 3-6 year runs across the Imperium.  It was Majesta ships that 
were the first MegaMerchants to get enough lifeboats for the entire crew 
(after the famous _Dragon\'s Trove_ disaster, which struck a mere 15
parsec\'s 
from Capital).

For MegaCorp personnel, Majesta crews are a breed apart. Outspoken, vocal 
and fully aware of their own importance, they take nothing from nobody, 
be they Archduke, Administrator or Admiral.  Solomani-dominated, they have
a 
vigourous rivalry with the Vilani lines that dare challange their 
dominance on the xboat routes.  (Nevermind free traders, who they view as 
figures of fun).  Of course, Majesta crews recieve special care from 
Tukera Lines, who are careful of crossing swords with them and aware of 
their irreplaceable skills and experience. 

*****----

Majesta\'s carry up to sixteen 50,000 disp Sekio Modules.  The cargo 
version is nothing but a hull and a powerplant to power the control 
systems.  It\'s entire hull is a clam-shell cargo door.  Of course, it has 
no crew, but is controlled remotely by RCV workstations.

The passenger version is as above, but with basic life support and 49,900 
low berths installed.  As there is still no crew, 2495 x TL 13a robot 
brains are built-in (with a selection of robots) to service the medical 
needs of the low passengers.

The 560 x 95-disp ton shuttles were originally to be used as lifeboats,
but 
are more often used as cargo haulers, on-loading and off-loading items 
for the 200,000 kl internal cargo hold.  They are manned by built-in 
robot brains for crew.

*****----

P.S. Yes, I know I should have installed some missiles on this ship, but 
the problem is, it\'s _civilian_!  Installing the number of missile 
turrents the ship deserves would make it very, *very* dangerous.  
Better to invoke some \'Imperial Regulation\' forbidding missile 
emplacements on MegaMerchants.

Really?  I always thought that it was steam from all that water that they
dumped under the pad just prior to launch, in order to keep the structure
from melting under the heat from the boosters.

Interesting.  What is aluminum oxide?

This isn\'t _quite_ related, but we had some rather interesting discussions
on the Cherryhlist about the use of water as a payload in the missiles in
Cherryh\'s warships. All combat in her ships is in real-space and often
takes place at a significant percentage of the speed of light (50-75%). The
biggest impact between two fighting ships is the relative velocity. I was
suggesting some sort of "grape shot" so that you can get a wide spread
(since light-lag keeps you from knowing _precisely_ where they will be).
Someone else said why not use water. You can get a perfectly even spread
and it is bloody cheap.
He also said that idea has been used in another book. But I can\'t remember
which.,,

By contrast, the Traveller version of Hortalez et Cie is claimed in at
least one place to have been founded in the 220s by, as I recall, a
Lucienne Hortalez (and the family still owns a respectable chunk most
of a millenium later).  The Shiishuginsa family\'s Zirunkariish should
exist in the "Milieu Zero" period, but Hortalez shouldn\'t (unless the
historians in 1100 have got it wrong, which is possible).

Hortalez et Cie is terribly useful as an independent commercial entity,
but I can see some people having fun letting the Imperium have a bigger
secret than the TI/TJ companies involving control of Hortalez.  (That 
sort of deep, dark conspiracy stuff wouldn\'t fly for me, but it might
appeal to some of you....)

That\'s somewhat of an overstatement; NERVA wasn\'t that much higher
ISP than modern chemical rockets. Take a look at FFS2 - the lowest-tech

Actually, George "TML\'s Resident Rocket Scientist" Herbert classified

(which I\'m still not sure I agree with, but that\'s a "philosophy of TL"
issue.)

    'body' => '>has anyone out there actually designed one
>of the mega-cargo ships that would obviously be supplying core worlds?
Hiya,
     Loren requested a proposal from me about merchant adventures in the
Spinward Marches and I\'ve been doing the research using the MegaTraveller
design rules. The assumption is that there are massive ships that are
jump-1, maneuver 0.2 that travel the mains. Their main business is
long-haul but up to 10% of their cargo space is used for speculation. When
an where they choose to dump their speciulative stuff makes for major agony
and upset amongst the fringe tramp traders. The price came down to about
500Cr per ton of cargo per jump. Or, if you were shipping, say, oranges,
.075 Cr per orange. That justtifies a lot of long-haul trade. You could
ship oranges halfway across a subsector without impacting much on the
price. If you go up to microwave ovens you can ship them across a few
subsectors. And if you go up to dishwashers then Glisten->Regina is still
profitable.
     But on to your question. There were two main patters of ships I was
looking at. One supertanker (100,000t cargo) line was run at optimal with
all the latest and required a crew of about 50. These were strictly
business with formalised mercant marine ranks and so forth. The other line
used minimal automation and required a crew of about 1000. These were
assumed to employ an extended family structure with kids and so forth on
the ship. Although slightly less efficient than the automated ships, the
assumption was that these were more often used by the Vilani derived
megacorporations and the slightly higher running costs were offset by
reduced recruitment overheads (the younger generation being a readily
accessible pool of trained labour) and increased crew loyalty.
     Normal operations were to jump in at 100 diameters and immediately
begin conducting electronic busines. The ship would then, slowly, make its
way down to zero-G docks while the bulk of the crew shuttled down to
starport and stayed there during the time in port. Once the ship got to
dock it would shif brokered cargo in and out from company warehouses,
refuel, resupply, and start heading out. The crew would then shuttle back
as it neared the jump point and it would jump for the next destination.
     Other than the shuttle, cargo transport and anciliary craft designs
there was also company merchant escort designs to provide the firepower to
protect them where the Naval patrols were thin or for trade wars.
     I\'ve trained my design spreadsheet to export HTML ship files as well,
now, and intend to put them up on the core web pages
(http://members.nova.org/~sol/core) at some stage. (And before you ask, the
spreadsheet only works in Lotus 1-2-3 \'97 and can\'t be converted to
anything else.) If there is a general interest write me _privately_ and
I\'ll post them sooner rather than later.
     Cheers,
          Jo

Standard Traveller Fusion plants probably use magentohydrodynamics - run
the fusion plasma at high speed past an approriate arrangement of magnets and
coils to get electricty. This has the advantage (a) of no moving parts, and
(b) you can run the "cold end" (and the exhaust) at several thousand K
(as opposed to only a few hundred K for a closed-cycle steam turbine) which
reduces the heatsink area required.

If these sorts of ships were very common, then I would expect that
someone would operate fast shuttles to start bringing cargo in from
as far out as the 100 diameter limit.  I\'m not sure how much time you
could save, but if the ships could afford to wait near the most likely
entry point, they could get goods to the planet much faster than the
large cargo ship.  If the large ships were modular with large detachable
cargo pods, tugs could do the work for you.

I would count Lockheed Martin and McDonald Douglas as US companies in the
space business; they certainly do commercial launches (with goverment-
derived hardware.) So does Orbital Sciences (Pegasus/Taurus.) 

There is a large collection of small companies, often with little funding
and exotic ideas trying to get into the fully-reusable small-launcher
market... (Kistler, Pioneer, Rotary Rocket, etc.)

>Probably because it _ain\'t_ as cheap or easy as you might believe.
This I do agree with - I certainly don\'t expect most of the small ventures
to succeed, and the "if only the goverment got out of the way we\'d Rule
The Stars" myth is certainly a myth, but there are corporations slugging
towards increasing commercialization.

The big thing getting in the way, is the start up capital, both money wise
and ability wise. Even a cheap, no frills rocket will cost you millions to
make and launch.  

And how many people actually know how to build a rocket? I majored in space
science in college, and so have the basic idea, but really,  you\'d pretty
have to recruit someone with experience - ie, from Nasa or the ESA or the
old Soviet Space Agency. And there can\'t be that many of those (Actually,
there are probably a lot of ex-Soviets available). Without experience with
actual rockets, you\'re going to end up like that guy in England (he built
his own rocket, and it crashed rather spectacularly). Even with experience,
quite a few rockets are going to crash - even a tiny error in the guidance
or a quality problem in the engine can cause the whole thing to collapse. 

So, it ends up being the various aerospace companies that have the ability
to - but they don\'t seem to find it profitable enough - too much risk -
they can just keep on building planes and make good money.  Once the market
for planes dries up a bit, I think you\'ll see more commerical launches.
Even then, the inherent problems of rockets will probably force them to use
other ideas, like Pegasus (rocket from a high flying plane) or hopefully a
clipper.

Anyone remember that old Andy Griffith show (or maybe it was a movie),
called I think Salvage 1? He built a rocket in his junkyard, and made
millions scavenging lost satelites.

I remember a tactic like this being used in the "Uplift" saga by David Brin:
A ship which was being chased dumped most of the water it was holding (which
the dolphins lived in, IIRC), which dispersed and froze solid, presenting
the (fast moving) enemy ship with a wide field of shrapnel.

Oh, my god, I totally forgot about that show!  To my mother\'s chagrin, it
had my brother & I putting together "rocketships" in the back yard (using

Unfortunately, we encountered hostile aliens quite frequently (when they

That reminds me of a book by Colin Kapp, in which an assassin uses a

Comments: This battle rider tender is designed for maximum flexibility using a
modular approach; the tender carriers her jump fuel in exterior demountable
fuel tanks. Each 4 tanks carried provides the fuel for a Jump 1. She can trade
Battle rider payload for Jump range. For an example, she can carry 24 fuel
tanks to take advantage of her Jump-6 capability; but this means she can only
carry 5 Battle riders. At Jump-4, she can carry a more respectable 13 Battle
riders. This design is in competition with a modular tender that mounts only
Jump-4 drives. The shorter ranged tender can carry more riders, as her engines
are smaller, but the Admiralty feels that the advantage of Jump-5 and 6
Batrons are useful too. The Admiralty will probably procure both designs, with
the Jump-4 tenders based in the fringes of the Imperium, and the Empress class
tenders based in the interior, as an emergency response force of the Strategic
Reserve. Both tender designs are intended to be used with the new Emperor
class Battle riders. The Admiralty was rumored to have been unhappy with the
long refueling times of the tender due to the small fuel tanks of the Emperor
class Battle riders, and ordered Buships to to add a 10,000 ton fuel tender
and a bay for it to be incorporated into the design. This space was supposed
to carry troops and/or fighters and their launch facilities, but buOps will
mission-task fighter and/or assault carriers (variants of the Emperors) into
the Batron organizations as needed. This tender can also be used as a fast
fleet Fuel tanker if needed.

comments: This Battle rider was designed to operate with Empress class tenders
(whose bay size was designed for this battle rider). This ship was designed to
be the smallest design that could carry: 1) the largest available Meson gun 2)
maximum defenses (screens and armor). She also has a big enough power plant to
maintain maximum agility with her weapons active, and the fastest, most
advanced computers available. A flagship variant is available that has a
second Bridge for an Admiral and his/her staff at the cost of the suppression
of all four Particle Accelerator bays, and one of the Repulsor bays. A 1-G
fighter Carrier, and a 1-G troop carrier variant are under consideration to
give a Batron more flexibility, as well as a 1-G fuel tender variant to allow
the Battle rider tender to be refueled quicker, or to operate as a Fleet
tanker. There is criticism by the Admiralty that the lack of an Admiral’s
barge (95 ton shuttle) hinders the operations of the flag battle rider, but
this has been deemed acceptable. As it is, the flag staff must use the
tender’s shuttle, and then transfer to the flag ‘rider, as the tender does not
have a flag bridge. Fortunately, the transfer from tender to ‘rider can be
performed before battle. It can even be performed in Jump space; via the main
airlocks. This same argument also applies to the fact that the Flag quarters
are on the tender, and the flag bridge is on a battle rider.

Comments: An experimental fuel tender for the Empress class Battle rider
tender. This vessel ensures that even if the tender has no battle riders
embarked; she can be refueled. This vessel has staterooms for her crew, which
is unusual for a fuel tender for two reasons. The first reason is that the
tender was designed after the Empress class tender was (because of the Buships
decision to add a fuel tender), and any crew quarters for the fuel tender
would have to come from the extra quarters earmarked for the Flagstaff). The
second reason is that if this design should prove successful, she can be
adapted for other uses, and crew quarters gives her the endurance that a small
craft lacks.

There\'s a book by Kosta Tispis (sp?) that details the forumlae used to
calculate these things, in excruciating detail. My ocal library used to
have it, but it seems to have gone the way of the cold war, along with lots
of other stuff about nukes.

From what I remember I\'m far from certain that the figures used in FF&S 1/2
(which come from Striker, IIRC) are actually correct.

    'body' => '[Note:  I still haven\'t seen Loren\'s playtest files, as I still haven\'t
received my password for Pyramid.  Any mistakes or wrongheadedness
contained herein are therefore strictly my own.]

Background:

In twenty years of Traveller campaigns, I have 
encountered basically only two types of players’ groups:
those that have a ship, and those that are desperately 
scamming to obtain one.

This is a significant challenge for the GURPS Traveller
referee, because even the smallest starships represent 
enormous wealth (~2000 times average starting wealth).  
Because Traveller does not expect "balance" among its 
characters, all the versions have handled this in the 
past by essentially giving starships to characters who 
met basic criteria (veteran scouts, merchant captains, 
lucky belters).  TNE’s system of "Ship DM’s"  was a step
toward balance, but was based on some very background-
specific assumptions about starship construction and 
availability.

What then?  In GURPS, possession of a starship is 
clearly an Advantage, but what kind and what does it 
cost?  Certainly a Multimillionaire (CI, p. 27) can 
afford to simply buy a Personal Yacht, but unless your 
campaign centers around this type of character, you need
other options.  The Points for Equipment and Temporary 
Wealth rules (CI, p. 17-18) only generate (at most) 75 
times starting wealth (5x for Temporarily Wealthy, 
15x for Points); this doesn’t even make the down-payment 
on a used Free Trader.

I propose a set of advantages, the Starship Advantages,
as a variant of Patron.  Either the Patron owns the ship
and allows the characters to use it (Scout/Courier, 
Labship, Family Yacht), or the Patron puts up the funds 
to purchase the ship and allows the characters to pay 
him back (Free Trader, Far Trader, Subsidized Merchant, 
Subsidized Liner).  All of these are reduced by Duties 
or Sense of Duty as appropriate.


Assumptions:

1.  One Traveller credit (Cr) is approximately equal to 
one GURPS Space credit ($), at least for starship costs.  

This is at odds with some other estimates, but the only 
data points I had to work from (the VE2 Air/raft and 
Scout/Courier designs by David P. Summers) 

http://www.io.com/~ftp/GURPSnet/Worlds/Traveller/Air.Raft.txt
http://www.io.com/~ftp/GURPSnet/Worlds/Traveller/Imperial.Scout.txt

costed out 
very close to the average figures for the Traveller 
vehicles they were based on.  In fact, the variance 
among the different versions of Traveller is greater 
than the difference between the VE2 design costs and 
the averages.  If the official GT conversion turns out 
to be different, adjustments are left as an exercise for
the reader.

2.  The Patron advantage is a combination of advice, 
information, assistance, and (if the additional cost is 
paid) equipment.

This is important, because I used the following 
Accessibility Limitations in constructing these 
advantages:

Provides Information Only:  -80%
     (this is essentially the Contacts Advantage, and 
      the costs are comparable) 
Provides Equipment Only:  -30% of the with-equipment cost
Concerned Only with Equipment:  -10%
     (that is, the Scout Service will fuel and maintain 
      your ship, but they won’t bail you out of jail)

3.  Traveller ship acquisition rules apply:  20% down,  
payments of 1/240 of purchase price per month (Free 
Traders) or payments of 50% of gross profits to the 
Government (Subsidized Merchants and Liners),  for a 
40-year term.  Other ship types are acquired per the 
mustering out rules in CT, MT, or T4.

This works out to a 2.3% annual percentage rate mortgage 
for Free Traders (and therefore has some significant 
implications for the stability of the Imperium, and the 
overall success rate of skipping or piracy).  It is 
relatively cheap, but not inconsistent with the starship
acquisition and financing rules in GURPS Space (p. 80-82) 
or the vehicle acquisition rules in VE2 (p. 199-200).

The prices given are the values I used in my 
calculations.  They are a guideline, not a 
hard-and-fast rule.  The capabilities of the ship in 
question are more important than the strict monetary 
value.

4.  I am still using my house rules for careers in GURPS
Traveller,  here mostly for Prerequisites.  A "term" is 
a four-year stint in a given career field.  For 
unadulterated GURPS, ensure that the character meets the
skill requirements on the appropriate Job Table (e.g., 
GURPS Space, p. 39),  and invests at least 8 points in 
job-related skills (GM’s call) per term required (i.e., 
3 terms = 24 points).


Starship Advantages:

Personal Yacht (MCr 52.5), 5 points.
Prerequisite:  Multimillionaire.
You own your own starship (usually 200 dtons with all 
the frills).  Have fun.

Family Yacht (MCr 52.5), 10 points.
Prerequisite:  Filthy Rich.
You have the access codes to a starship (usually 200 
dtons with all the frills) belonging to Mummy and Daddy 
- - or to your clan or family business.  The family 
retains ownership - you cannot sell or transfer the 
ship, or make major modifications without permission.  
The family may help you out of a jam if needed (Patron, 
6-).  In return, they expect you to occasionally carry 
out missions on their behalf (Duty to Family, 6-).

Scout/Courier (MCr 30.0, used), 30 points.
Prerequisite:  3+ terms in Scout Service.
Scout Service provides a 100 dton Scout/Courier for your
personal use.  The Scouts retain ownership - you cannot 
sell or transfer the ship, or make major modifications 
without permission.  Fuel is available free at any Scout
Base; free maintenance is also available at any Scout 
Base at a Class A or B starport, but the Scouts will not
assist you personally (Concerned Only with Equipment 
limitation).  You are subject to recall to active 
service (Duty to Scout Service, 6-) with the ship.

Labship (MCr 112.5), 50 points.
Prerequisites:  Ph.D. or MD; 3+ terms as a Scholar.
Your parent Institute, University, Government Agency, or
Corporation provides a 400 dton Laboratory Ship for you 
to use in your continuing research.  The organization 
retains ownership - you cannot sell or transfer the ship
 or make major modifications without permission.  You 
must produce results on a fairly regular basis (Publish 
or Perish:  Duty to Patron, 12-), but your organization 
may be able to provide other information or assistance 
if requested (12-).

Free Trader (MCr 37.5), 30 points plus 1000 Shares.
Far Trader (MCr 56.25), 30 points plus 1500 Shares.
Prerequisites:  Merchant Captain (Rank 5).
You have financed a 200 dton Free Trader through a 
40-year bank or loan company mortgage.  In order to make
your down-payment, you may also have been forced to sell
Shares of ownership to Investors (see below).  You must 
make payments of 1/240th of the purchase price of your 
ship every month; payments include insurance for the 
bank’s investment, but not for yours.  The bank will not
assist you in any other way (Provides Equipment Only 
limitation).

Over time, your ownership in the ship increases as the 
debt owed the bank decreases:

If you sell your ship, you must repay the bank the debt 
owed, as a fraction of the original purchase price of 
the ship.  Any remaining moneys must be divided between 
you and your Investors (if any).

Subsidized Merchant (MCr 75.0), 70 points plus 2000 Shares.
Subsidized Liner (MCr 225.0), 70 points plus 6000 Shares.
Prerequisites:  Merchant Captain (Rank 5).
You have financed a 400 dton Merchant ship or a 600 dton
Liner through a subsidy from the Government.  The 
Government retains 50% ownership, but waives any bank 
payments.  In order to make your down-payment, you may 
also have been forced to sell Shares of ownership to 
Investors (see below).  You must generally follow a 
designated route among 2-12 worlds (Duty to Government, 
15-), including some that would otherwise be ignored by 
merchant traffic.  You must make payments of 50% of your
gross profits (after expenses, but before any dividends 
or other payments) to the Government every month.  In 
the event of war, you may be activated to serve as a 
Fleet auxiliary.  At the end of 40 years, full title 
reverts to you (and your Investors), but you are still 
liable for activation in wartime.  The Government will 
not assist you in any other way (Provides Equipment Only
limitation).


Shares Advantage:

Shares (Cr 7,500 per Share), variable.
Prerequisites:  none.
When individuals do not have the wealth to start a new 
business, they pool their resources into a partnership 
or corporation  to make the necessary purchases, 
dividing ownership of the property according to the 
fraction of total resources each provides.  These pieces
of ownership are called Shares.  Each share is initially
worth 1/2 the starting wealth for the campaign (in GURPS
Traveller, this is Cr 7,500 per Share); divide the 
purchase price by this amount to determine the number of
Shares required.  

You can purchase Shares during character generation with
character points.  The number of Shares per point 
depends on your character’s wealth level.  The GM may 
impose a maximum of 30 points in Shares, if desired:

                Shares/point
Struggling:         1/2 (2 points per Share)
Average:              1 
Comfortable:          2 
Wealthy:              5 
Very Wealthy:        20 
Filthy Rich:        100 
Multimillionaire:  1000 

Once the player-characters have bought all the Shares 
they desire (or can afford), the remaining shares are 
assumed to be bought by NPC Investors, usually venture 
capitalists looking for a solid return on their money. 
The GM may rule that some purchases are too risky or too
unlikely to turn an adequate profit, and so no Investors
are available.   You must divide all net profits (after 
all expenses, Government subsidies, and reasonable 
savings for future needs and reinvestment are 
subtracted) with your fellow player-characters and your 
Investors, according to the percentage of Shares they 
hold.  Investors (as such) are normally anonymous, 
generic, and a zero-point Advantage, although Investors 
that are also Patrons or Allies (or Enemies!) carry the 
usual point values.

Control of the property is also divided among the 
player-characters and Investors according to the 
percentage of Shares they hold.  If the player-
characters hold more than 50% of the Shares, you can 
usually make decisions on your own (assuming you can 
agree among yourselves).  If not, or if the interests 
of minority Investors are at stake, use the Probability of 
Success Table (p. B45) - the target number to convince 
them is the skill level whose percent chance of success 
the Investors’ percentage of Shares equals or exceeds.  
For example, if Investors hold 750 out of 1000 Shares 
in a ship (75%), they can be convinced of the players’ 
plans on a 12- (74.1%).  Normal reaction bonuses apply.  
Disagreements among player-characters that are referred 
to the Investors are resolved as Contests of Skill.

Most Investors do not want to be bothered with day-to-
day operations (that’s why they invested their money in 
you!), but must be consulted about any decision 
involving the value of their investment - including 
attempts to sell or upgrade the property or to buy 
shares from them.  They expect that you will act to 
maximize the profit and value of your investment and 
theirs, and to minimize risk (Fiscal Responsibility, 
as Sense of Duty:  Investors).

As the value of the investment increases (say, as a 
corresponding bank mortgage is paid off) or decreases, 
the number of Shares remains the same, while the cash 
value of each Share increases or decreases accordingly.  
Later investors must purchase new Shares from existing 
share-holders, at their current value.

finance, including all the wicked role-playing 
possibilities inherent in the business world, I highly 
recommend FASA’s Corporate Shadowfiles sourcebook, by

for Shadowrun, it is an excellent sole-source reference 
for any campaign.]

Well, I don\'t think you would use shuttles.  The point of
these ships is to ship things that don\'t have to get there
very fast in a cheaper manner.  ("When it positively, absolutely,
has to get there sooner or later")  [I\'m not sure you would
go with 0.2G, maybe only 0.05 G, though you might have
some that can do two J-1\'s (or maybe 4 J-0.5\'s :-)]
Transfering the cargo with a fast (and expensive) shuttle
defeats the purpose of keeping cost down.  (Jo\'s shuttle
it good because it meanst that you can arrange purchase/
sale and give the crew vacations while the ship is in
motion).  If you wanted to speed things up, I don\'t think
you would use a shuttle, you would just have a mass driver
and fling the cargo to whatever you have to catch them.
Then you just use another one to fling cargo back out
and you never leave 100 diam.

	Fascinating site, but now I\'m quite curious. I was browsing around

Well, that is what I did in my GURPS Traveller article.  It seems
to work out well.  You generally need a reason why the PC won\'t
immediately sell the ship for huge amounts of money (or at least
a meta game agreement that he will not).  I costed it based
not on the cost of the ship, but my "GMly" judgement about
the utility for transportation or income.

This is similar to what you had (I don\'t know if that was by
design or chance).  To give some playtest perspective...

A couple of players took the Scout and found it generally worthwhile.
Both ended up arming them.  We never tried to see if they could 
make money with a scout because the cargo hold was so small that
it didn\'t seem worth worrying about.  Nobody has taken the
Free Trader.

Another player wanted an Aslan Seeker (which is Jump-2 and, IIRC,
has Free Trader type cargo capacity).  I think I charged him 60 
points based on the potential income and it was worth every
penny.  He made a killing with a speculative cargo and ended
up with millions.

I think it\'s _Arsenal, understanding weapons in the nuclear age_ which is
also listed as _Arsenal : Understanding Weapons in the Nuclear Age_ for
some reason. Both versions are listed as OOP, though.

	Amazon will find OOP books as well. But that\'s okay. The High Energy

currently got Teleport running in the background, slurping the entire
thing down.

With shuttles like this, the large cargo ships could transport stuff
as fast as anything could be transported (1 week per jump) over short
distances.  This would work well in a cluster of J-1 or J-2 stars.
Not worthwhile for longer trips, of course.

After reading the start of this thread I hit Andrew\'s FF&S v2 sheet and came
up with the following high speed tug. The idea is that it attaches to a 100
sdt container dropped by a large freighter and moves it in system. It is
designed to 3 gee (max for tech12) but unloaded if can really pour on the
coals! So the thought occurred to me that it could also be used as a high
speed sds given weapons pods up to 100 sdt. Not a bad investment for a
system government at a purchase price of $63,953,873, so I would also tend
to consider it subsidized.

I also drew the deck plans for it incorperating a standard docking ring set
up so it can be carried about by the modular freighter I \'ve been working
on. Without a container the tug weighs in at a small 40 sdt so it could be
carried by a number of designs.

It is NOT streamlined and is never intended to be used in atmosphere. I
picture any number of these running about in the orbit to jump limit range.
I think it would also see use in running asteroids to orbit, albeit with a
change of grapple design. The use of Fusion and thrusters makes it\'s range
and limit very high, although I\'ve reduced it to about 2 monthes Fusion fuel
and 4 weeks supplies a bit of cramping (even more than the design would
indecate) could extend this and external tanks could be added with little
effect on it\'s performance.

Let me know what you think. I like it enough to see it become a regular
encounter in the Inner Systems of my campaign.

States for some of the containers should follow in a couple of days.

When I said "standard" I was referring to the fact that most of the
current experimental reactors are intended to generate heat which
is converted into electricity through some sort of heat engine.

The heat engine is, of course, irrelevant to the fusion reactor.
Any power plant which generates heat which is converted to electricity
would benefit equally from improvements in this area.

If you are creating AC directly using the byproducts of the fusion
reaction, then you\'ll be pulsing it, which lends itself to inertial
confinement.  Of course, you could use a pulsed magnetic confinement
and collect the electrons as you collapse the field.  This is all
highly theoretical.

I would expect that several thousand years in the future, fusion reactors
would be very simple and robust with many systems performaing multiple
functions.  They will have had a lot of time to refine every part of
the plant.

I would look more at theoretical limits of fusion reactions and heat
engines and then start bumping up the actual efficiency of reactors
we expect to build.  I wouldn\'t worry so much about how the reactor
works since it probably won\'t work like we expect given our limited
knowledge of fusion reactor technology.  (Most likely the physics
behind the reactor won\'t be too shocking but the actual equipment may
be quite astounding.)

That was my reading.  That you wanted to give it a systematic
pricing.  I just wanted to give a playtest perspective.

While that is true by itself remember that this is the a thousand years
before the Imperium of "today".  The IN are only the point men, the real
power is Zhanustu Inc and the influence of the Empower.

There are not that many independent traders out there in 0.  The indies out
beyond the borders of the Federation, er, Imperium are taking a big risk.
10 parsecs from the nearest service bay, you\'re screwed if your last light
bulb burns out, much less your j-drive.  So you have to depend on the
kindness of strangers, or at least the IN.  You make nice with the IN, they
give you some bulbs, maybe even steer you to a profitable planet.
(Coincidental that planet is targeted for economic devastation to soften up
the way for Imperial membership -- its already several steps into the
program but still profitable.)

Now, consider that the IN has found a nice virgin world all ready to trade
reactors for mass produced grav plates.  Gold mine.  The IN wants to save
it for Zhanustu Inc traders, or other corps or nobles, FOCs (Friends of
Cleon).  They warn any wandering indies off.

The indie has two choices:
  1) Go somewhere else.  They can then expect lightbulbs and spare jump
coils from the IN when beyond the border.  Back in the Imperium they don\'t
get audited, fined, or thrown summarily in jail for espionage or some other
trumped up charge.
2) Go down to the planet, get insane amounts of money and hope to Ram the
Navy doesn\'t notice.  Or that they don\'t notice when they try to sell their
"ill gotten" goods.

Traders, independent or corporate, operating beyond the Imperium, have to
go BACK to the Imperium to cash in on the profits they made.  If they kept
in line with the IN, all is well.  Maybe the profits aren\'t that big, but
they are safe.  If they were targeted by the IN for poaching, or caught
selling contraband (reactors made on a planet supposedly saved for a
F.O.C.), life gets tough.  You might even end up as an example of what
ignoring the Emporer really means.  Probably time to move to a pocket
empire, if you can escape.  Then again, if you get away with it, you are
rich rich rich.

So the IN wouldn\'t need to keep a flotilla around each primo planet.  Just
a portrait of Cleon.

One of the things I left out in the interest of space was a direct
acknowledgement of your work as the inspiration for what followed.  I
hereby gratefully state that I started from your articles, which is why I
included the pointers to your scout and airraft conversions.  I inferred
you had set a mark on the wall to have something to work with, and the
point values seemed reasonable.  I wanted to see if I could come up with a
systematic approach that would be analogous to existing advantages, one
that answered my problems with the sheer expense of the ships.

I think Anders was trying to say that he doesn\'t use a standard fusion

If you go to the Traveller pages on my website, you can get a copy of Rob
Flammang\'s HG to T4 conversion notes which are quite quick to use...

http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/

Basically, they\'re a set of tables which allow you to convert between the
two rules sets. However, you should note that HG and FFS2 do use different
assumptions/values at heart, and that you have to ignore these differences
if you use this conversion.

I suspect this is one of othose Your-Imperium-May-Vary things, but it\'s an

Interesting thinking, but Free Traders are canon in M0 ... there is a note
about CZ making his first Trade Minister from a Free Traders.

The risk of bits burning out is a good reason to carry spare parts. Annual
maintainence is the problem issue.

Technically, it\'d be the Scout Service that did the discovery work.

The two problems with setting up "exploitation zones" are firstly, how do
you orginise it (I sort of like the idea of the Imperial government
auctioning off \'contact permits\')
and secondly, how do you enforce it ? If you tell twenty traders "Dont go
to world x", the odds are one of them will ... which is embaressing if he
didnt know about the prospect earlier.

#1 isnt that good an option if all the good trade routes *within* the
Imperium are also sewn up by FOCs (which is what I\'d do, if I was a FOC).

What can I say about 2 except "Smuggling is a Free Trader pursuit in which
a captain decides to transport goods illegally in order to make large
profits", and note that in Merchant Prince you did it one year in 36 if a
Free Trader, and one year in 18 if a scummy lower-class oik Free Trader. It
had a "Bonus" roll of 6+, which was pretty neat too.

Part of the problem with this is your average Jump-2 Free Traders will need
a TL11 B-class starport about once every 2 years. Now, the question is, how
many of these are there outside Imperial space ? Assuming you are making 5
megacredits per run, then by numbers you could do ummm, about 5 months
travel each way to get to your starport. Thats ummm about 30 parsecs,
assuming a jump every 10 days.

The moving to a pocket empire point is part of the problem - the Imperium
is not the only game in town, especially after the colonisation efforts
beyond the frontier got rolling (eg all those pesky Pocket Empires).

Hmmm. As has previously been shown, to successfully be a pirate you need a
secure base, and a friendly state. It may well be unofficial policy that
Unofficial Employees of Friends of Cleon are encouraged to hang out around
"exploitation zones", and make sure that Free Traders stay away. Naturally
enough, the above-mentioned FOCs make sure theat their ships get repaired,
refueled, resupplied, maintained etc within the IMperium with no hassles.

At one fell swoop

(1) this resolves the Piracy issue,

(2) it provides an excellent set of adventure hooks

(3) it explains why the Navy isnt enforcing the EZs

and (4) it maintains official deniability for the Imperium ("See, if you
gave us a permanent extraterritorial lease on your world for a Starport, we
could station a cruiser here and chase the pirates away").

If you are playing the Terrans, grab the choke point teritary system on the
right side of the board.  Hold it all costs.  Yo can then develop the

Get a moniter (or two) to that choke point.

Well, I designed the shuttles that brought the personnel in from the ships
for their shore leave to double as cargo ferries. I had considered that the
MegaCorp might own facilities at each world along the main with its own
shuttles. This would save carrying them on the ship but I felt that because
of the variance in starports along the line and in the interests of
self-sufficiency and in case of redeployment it would be better to have
them on the ship. It didn\'t really change the cost that much.

>but if the ships could afford to wait near the most likely
>entry point, they could get goods to the planet much faster than the
>large cargo ship.
True, but I felt that speed wasn\'t of prime concern. There is also
negotiating leverage. If you wait out at 100 diameters, then conclude your
deal, and start the cargo on its inward trip, they might change their mind
or pull some last minute negotiations once it is already inbound and made
the turnover. I.e. you, the seller, have already made the mass committment
with time for the buyer to twist you around.
Whereas if you send the _whole_ ship in, buyers can\'t do this to you. You
have the option of selling anything you want from your speculative hold.
The way I played this out meant, as well, that what exactly they were going
to dump on the market became rather important. If, for example, they
decided to dump several hundred tons of oranges here, rather than the next
world or two down, they might bankrupt the tramp who just got in with a hot
cargo of oranges. It wouldn\'t make the supertankers well loved by other
traders.
Additionally, as soon as the tanker gets in and starts publishing parts of
its manifest, the local commodities market will start fluctuating. Brokers
will start watching closely what the ship says it has, what commodity bonds
the ship itself is buying or selling, etc, etc. \'Tankers with good brokers
can probably make as much playing the local market (since they _know_ what
they are carrying) as they make on the cargo they dump. (It also gives a
good justification for random rolls on a table - "yes, they get a lousy
price for their oranges on this Agricultural world but it depresses the
fruit market and they can buy up the local strawberries at a much better
Cr/ton rate to pass on to the next world.") Needless to say this
marketeering doesn\'t enamour them to anyone either.

>If the large ships were modular with large detachable
>cargo pods, tugs could do the work for you.
I designed all the ships as "open frame". I had envisaged large, orbital
zero-G warehouses maintained by the MegaCorp at various nodal points. Your
idea works well with this. I like it.

One final point on close-orbit -vs- 100 diameters. Marc has said (on HIWG?)
that a ship comes into orbit from jump at 100 diameters roughly along a
line between the two masses it is jumping between. If you put a station up
at 100 diameters it is going to have to be in orbit around the mass.
Because of its orbit, the planetary orbit, etc, etc, it is essentially
random _where_ a ship might come it along the 100 diameter radius and where
you might place the station. On average it is going to be 3 times further
away (?) than a station in low-orbit.

Cheers,
Jo

Not bad, but let\'s carry it a little further.

If fast shuttles are worthwhile in some systems, why not just
have a permanent company-owned orbital base out near a gas
giant? It would serve as a cargo transport hub as well as a
maintenance/refueling depot for the tankers. Some would even
have recreational facilities and quarters for ship\'s crews in those
systems which don\'t have them...or even those that do (i.e. the
company engages in what I call "payroll recovery". This could
lead to having scheduled payroll delivery runs (though these would
probably be electronic in nature), supply runs, etc.

Lots and lots of intra-system traffic to these bases in addition
to normal system traffic would be justification for defining traffic
lanes, both public and restricted, for keeping PCs from choosing
just any old course to an above/below the ecliptic jump point. This
can, in turn, allow for the "darker elements" of society
(pi-pir-pi...aw, I can\'t say it) to hop between these types of systems
for a little occasional "grazing" of smaller targets. I can even see
one of the tankers being seized for its cargo by a small Vargr
action group for scavenging by a small population world after
which the ship itself is broken up for parts/materials.

Jo and Bolie, you\'ve both got some great ideas. I can see them all
working in combination in any Traveller universe. This is some good
stuff, folks!

I just had an idea.  How about the MERCHANT RIDER!  Say, a million ton open
frame carrying scads of 10,000 ton "ships" (basically aerodynamic containers
with maneuver drives).  Momma pops out of J-space, babies detach, land, do
their thing, reconnect.  you could also have a few babies dedicated to
refueling.

Just a weird idea.  Haven\'t finished my coffee.

That\'s why I\'ve stuck with Traveller all these years; it helps stretch my
mind. My wife told me one of things that she found interesting about
me was that she once caught me watching a video when she came
over to my apartment while we were dating.

The title of the video: The Beginnings of the Universe.

She was very impressed that I was fascinated with the interaction of
mesons on other forms of matters...and, no, I didn\'t explain *why* I
was fascinated.

Actually, the person who played IASIC in the TML PBeM noticed this several
years ago -- his comment was "Those Vilani aren\'t so great at management; 
Good Old Conservative Terran Business Practice for Hortalez has kept them
in business for over 3800 years!"  He\'d been reading about Franklin at the
time.

Of course, it was carefully pointed out to him that the Vilani "Big Three"
megacorporations are about ten thousand years old....  GSbAG is the oldest
Terran firm I know of in the game; Marc Miller\'s "Luna" article suggests
they\'re founded in the 21st century, prior to the invention of jump drive
(about 3600 years).  Wasn\'t GSbAG in a Triplanetary scenario?  :)

Sure.  I\'ve been working on this idea but on a smaller scale.  Does a system
REALLY ship a million tons of cargo every week? If the babies supply the jump
fuel necessary to displace their own volume, then momma can stay in jumpspace
about 90% of the time.  Jump in. Deploy babies. Take on waiting babies. Jump
out. This makes more efficient use of the jump drives (although that\'s got its
own problems too, like when do you do maintenance). The next question is how
much do you charge for this service? Refined fuel runs about 50 Cr/dT/Pc which
is a good basis for expenses. Doubling would be a good rule of thumb to account
for crew compensation.  This yeilds 400 Cr/dT for long range J-6 freight, less
concidering non-cargo portions of babies.

My design is a modular freighter that can link jump drives for greater
capacity.  Its only 400 dT but can link any number together (practically only 25
or so).  It uses a 50dT standard modular cutter to carry two 15  dT cylinder
modules to and from the surface.

Somebody else (can\'t remember, sorry) is working on a lollipop freighter that
does the same thing but links off a stick.  I was thinking about this too,
assuming the "stick" is less than 7 meters in diameter, my coinstack could mate
with his lollipop through the cutter bay.   The whole thing would look kinda
freakish... and I wouldn\'t want to get into a fight with that mess.  But then
again, a million dT monster would look pretty freakish anyway...

Unfortunately Joe. The spine of my "lollipop" measures out to about 9.5
meters across at a docking ring module. Each of these modules is stacked
with smaller tunnel modules about 2 deck high between. (Very rough layout
below)

>=O=<  Docking Ring
    ( )  Tunnel

    ( )

    ( )
 _ ( )_
[         ]
[         ]  Jump/Manuver Drive
   ^ ^

Each tunnel and docking ring module is removeable, and can dock upto 4
shuttles/containers. I\'ve also added a docking/mating ring to the tug design
I sent to the list last night, so now I\'m thinking that a decent
configuration might be several containers, a tug, and a shuttle for the
crew.

    Last week I was looking through this years Science News magazines at the library, and
came across a genetics story that seems to fit with the Traveller Anagathics
rules.

The article in question discussed Telomerase (sp?), an enzyme that can evidently add
telomeres to the ends of DNA strands that either have none, or have very little (as in the
case of a cell that has divided nearly to it\'s limit).  It has been theorized for years that the
telomeres on the ends of DNA strands limit the amount of times that a cell
can divide.
The researchers in the article have evidenced that the addition of telomeres to the ends
of DNA strands not only increases the amount of cell divisions, but also multiplies the
life of that cell by a (kind of forgot the specifics here but think this is close) 5-10 times.
The cells not only live longer, but live healthier, without the cellular breakdowns that
occur in aging cells.

This is pretty neat stuff. The researchers have only tested the Telomerase on skin and
retinal cells (of humans).  One of the drawbacks about this method for increasing
lifespan in animals (mice w/human immune systems & humans specifically) is that
this is the same method used by cancer cells to become immortal, and everyone knows
that cancer cells divide uncontrollably creating tumors.

The uncontrollable growth factor is the disadvantage that makes this sound exactly
like the Anagathics used in Traveller.   The Anagathics side effects table (in TNE) lists
minor growths, major growths, and major disfigurement as some of the side effects.

At any rate it sounds like we may have just invented Traveller Anagathics. Pretty cool,
however I have hope that additional methods will be developed to control the uncontrolled
cell division problem.  Start looking for "Immortal Mice" to be created within the next five
years or so.  The article mentioned that several organizations are already rushing to do
just that.

Gross mismanagement of fissionable materials. Safety violations.
I\'ve heard that enough plutonium was found in the air ducts to 
build a good sized bomb. The place was a contamination disaster 
waiting to happen. Most people don\'t realize that plutonium is highly
corrosive, so most containment facilities "rot" away over time.

I checked out the new Trav book at the bookstore yesterday, and one of the neat
surprises in it is all the game info in the back.

These 4 or 6 pages in the back are better than several pages in the T4 main

Well, to me the point is cost, not speed.  

In Traveller, the implication is that you have the
shipping of large bulk cargoes like grain.  This
is the sort of thing you would carry it them.

You should then double the crew requirements so you can rotate them out

Some ideas on strategies for this wonderful game: 

If you\'re the Empire, match the Terran Missile Boats with about two fighter
squadrons each (if you can). Without fighters or scouts for screening units,
his Missile Boats will frag your capital ships faster than you get them back.

Again for the Empire, don\'t worry as much about colonization as the Terrans
need to. Save your bases for invading his important worlds and taking worlds
you don\'t want him to have.

Terrans: Make use of your interior lines of communication in the first war. 
A unit based near Terra can do a reaction move to either frontier for most
of the game. As best you can, maintain a solid line at the choke point 
planets - a few Impie destroyers blockading your homeworlds while
your cruisers are dying over Epsilon Eridani will really hurt your income,
much more than you doing the same to the Impies would hurt them.

Both sides:

Best you can, do not go into interwar attrition with any of your Jump
Troops in the casualty pile. Even if they are attrited between wars,
you\'ll still have a garrison unit left behind - and if they aren\'t attrited, 
you\'ll have a nice commando unit to start the next festivities with.

Keep careful track of glory points. I\'ve seen the Terrans goad the
Empire into winning a war - the victory (with the Terran 
inter-war colonization) cost the Empire everything lost during the
war by both sides and more. Remember that taking a planet
may win the war for you, sending your victorius forces home
before you\'ve had a chance to consolidate any of your gains.

How long are the tunnels?  If they\'re 27+ meters, we could do docking ring/coin
stack/docking ring.  Then make some sort of rotating axle on the coinstacks to
get a REALLY freaky effect.

On a more serious note, why are jump drives located at the rear of ships?  The
don\'t "push" the ship.  As best as I can tell, they just form  some sort of
bubble and fall into the jump tunnel.  To me this would imply that jump drives
don\'t need to be at the rear of ships.

Something else to bare in mind - magnetism and radiation belts:

Like the Earth, Jupiter has a magnetic field but (as expected) it
is far more intense.  The magnetic field extends  out  some  21.5
million km and is 10,000 times stronger than the Earth\'s.  Anyone
passing through the radiation belt (at about 200,000 km out  from
Jupiter) can expect to take 250,000 rads (500  times  the  lethal
dosage).  The movement of the moon Io through this magnetic field
generates a current of 5 million ampares (a 100 watt  light  bulb
has a current of 1 ampare).  This electrical  current  is  slowly
eroding Io  away.  Gasses  from  Io\'s  volcanoes  break  up  into
charged particles, along with surface matter, to form  a  growing
invisible doughnut-shaped electrical cloud around the planet.

Probably to be closer to the power plant and other engineering systems,
since it seems that related expertise is required to crew them.

As to your questions. I do not typically place J-drives at the rear of the
ship. More typically I place them near (not strictly, just close, or
whereever there is room). Thrusters, however, I tend to plan out near the
"rear" or opposed to the direction of thrust. Exceptions to this would be if
they are on booms, but since I see the spine as being filled with attached
pods, shuttles etc. I figured on the drives at the rear. This is due to the
fact that in MTU the concentrated and directional gravitational fields
emmitted by the thrusters are less than healthy, so I try to avoid having
them travel through occupied areas.

CG, again not being as consetrated or as directional as thrusters, are also
placed in odd areas, usually centerish of the hull. To make it easier on the
engineers, I tend to group J-drive, CG, and power plant. This also adds
substantial armour, even if Traveller\'s combat rules don\'t take it into
account.

thinking.  For one thing, if the plasma from the fusion reactor can be
directly converted into mechanical energy (rather than heating water),
this mechanical energy can spin an HPG thus generating the electricity

reduce in size (per storage capacity) with Tech level, this explains why
fusion reactors reduce in size (per MW produced) with tech level. At TL
15 a kL of fusion reactor produces 6 MW or 6 Mj/sec.  At maximum output
it requires a 0.21 kL HPG to store the energy.  A little over a fifth of
the reactor would be HPG.

Now its been mentioned that a jump drive is one third HPG.  So the
question is can you design a ship that uses the same HPG for power plant
and jump drive, thus saving on volume and mass.  And two, how large
would the powerplant be if it was capable of producing the necessary
power for the jump (not counting the injection mass).

I would (but there again I like the feel of Cyberpunk, Vampire and Elric

Yep, IIRC the capital of the Chanestin is Keshi which is somewhat dead in
M0. Remember - the Imperium my forbid member states the use of nukes but
reserves the right to use them itself.

Yes, I agree. In my game the players will not be seeing the nasty side of
the Imperium at first, or maybe ever. It\'s not mentioned in polite
society...

The problems I have with explanations like this are

1. It replaces one handwave (starships require living pilots) with two
handwaves (robot brains could do the job just as well but government
regulations require living pilots). Three handwaves, actually, since other
agencies now happily support these regulations. I\'m not saying these
handwaves are implausible, just that they are not supported by other rules,
and open loopholes for even more inconsistencies.

2. It hides campaign-specific rules in the design rules. So now starship
crews depend on government regulations and not just the requirements of the
ship. What about all the other design rules? Maybe fusion generators are
really only a fraction of a ton but government regulations require them to
have tons of fire suppresion equipment?

3. It makes the rules unusable for other campaigns or settings. What if
different societies don\'t have these regulations, or my campaign is not in
the Third Imperium? What design rules do I use then?

4. It unbalances the game. A ship that doesn\'t need a pilot can carry more
cargo for less money. If the rules allow for it I can\'t believe that no one
on the entire history of the Third Imperium hasn\'t tried it. And if they
haven\'t, players certainly will.

Look, I understand the reason for making these rulings, you don\'t like a
particular aspect of Traveller technology and want to "fix" it. The trouble
is that these little "fixes" will snowball into something that makes your
campaign significantly different from Traveller canon. I\'m not saying canon
is perfect, but the rules we have are designed for it, and it provides a
common framework for us to discuss the game.

I hope to hell this isn\'t some sort of troll...

The impression I get is that almost any personal URL you spot on
this list is either a Traveller link itself, or has links to
Traveller pages.  You might want to start that way.  Most of the
Traveller links that these pages have will in turn have other
links; for example, Freelance Traveller
(http://www.tightbeam.com/FreelanceTraveller/) has a whole page
of them - follow the links to the Information Center, and then
Traveller on the Internet.  Be aware that there\'s going to be
quite a bit of duplication between the various link collections.

And may whatever deities you worship protect you if you even
_think_ about misusing the information you find.  The members of
this list sure as **** won\'t.

Yes, I have a galactic directory for Core sector in M:0.  It is not a
direct copy of what is in M:0 or FS.  It is a bit \'corrected\' shall we
say :)

Me and Volker have done some research and done some mods to the original
data.  I have continued by highlighting the early interstellar rivals or
the Repubic/Imperium.  The Interstellar Confederacy and the Chanestin
Kingdom are but two.

The file is a zipped file which contains an entire directory structure
taken from my drive.  Unzip the file and look for the \'year0\' directory.
Drag this into you gal32 directory.  you will have to edit the file
which contains the \'Galaxies\' so you can select it.

Finaly, the url:

ships, and against the common use of Jump torpedoes, is that the transition
into and from J-space, causes a disruption in the computer logic for x
amount of time (x being variable from 20 minutes to 120 minutes, roll 2d6,
reducable but a computer task, see the following...).

This also caused disorientaion in the crew, but on a lesser scale
 activities for 10 minutes are at a +2 difficulty level). To reduce computer
disruption is typically a Difficult Task, success results in reducing a
computers downtime by 50% and the player can roll until a failure results,
or the comuter is restored.

( example: Ship leaves jump and it\'s computers are disrupted for 120 minutes
{roll of 12}, Pilot/Astrogator rolls computer task and succeeds, computer
downtime is reduced to 60 minutes. He/she rolls again and again succeeds,
reduceing downtime to 30 minutes, a third roll fails so the computer will be
down for 30 minutes)

Of course the Pilot/Astrogatorcan hand compute the ship\'s postion in the
destination system but I consider that a Staggering task...

This holds true until biological component computers (or Artifical
Intellegence {i.e. VIRUS}) comes into play, so far not IMTU). At that time I
intend to treat them as I treat crew activities.

The downside to this is the x-boat systems transmissions can be delayed. But
it has satified my players as to why automation isn\'t more prevalent.
J-torps have been tried, but can wander off course and delay their messages
even more than a human guided ship.

Don\'t know if this adds much to the thread, but it\'s worked for me. It also
gives the crew of the ship some activities when first entering a system.

Not true.  This is one of *thousands* of urban myths.  I am *personally*
aware of it existing as far back as 1983.  Further, whoever created it
clearly has very little actual knowledge about the U.S. military air
defense industry.  Specifically:

The F-14 is manufactured by Grumman, not MacDonnell Douglas. General
Dynamics designed and built the F-16.  The F-117A Stealth was created
by Lockheed.  Only the F-15 Eagle was actually a McDonnell Douglas
product.

Sheesh.  Five minutes of lousy research is all it would have taken. :^/

One point : It takes many turns to get monitors to Sirius, they do not
have jump drives. 

What I noticed when playing Imperium after an eight year break, was that
the system one removed from Sirius to Terrans is very important. The
Terrans should control it, else Ziru Sirka gets almost free access to all
Terran systems.

Just because only one of the planes was manufactured by MacDonnell Douglas

there :^)

My point is, who cares if it really _was_ posted onto the MacDonnell
Douglas website or not?  It\'s damned funny, and that\'s the point.

IMTU, the standards are as follows:

(note, ASCII art done in 10pt Courier New)

Combat Service Ribbons.  The Imperium awards a medal for participation in a
campaign.  The Navy decides what constitutes a campaign.  For example, the
entire Fifth Frontier War was a single campaign, with a single award.
Participation in a significant battle gives the wearer the right to attach
a small plate to the ribbon with the name of the incident.  For example,
CPO Davis served in the Firth Frontier War.  He was present for the defense
of Efate, the Battle of Rhylanor, and the assault on Jewell.  His award
would look some thing like this:

**************
*            *
**************
 |          |
 |  EFATE   |    <----  Battle streamer for Efate
 |          |
 | RHYLANOR |    <----  Rhylanor
 |          |
 |  JEWELL  |    <----  Jewell
 |          |
 \\         /
  \\       /
   ******
  *      *
 *        *    <----  Firth Frontier War Medal
 *        *
  *      *
   ******

Valor decorations are awarded in three categories.  Basic (1-4th award),
Swords (5-9 awards), and Diamonds (10 or more awards).  A Marine who has
won the medal for conspicuous gallantry six times would be said to hold the
MCG with Swords.  He would only wear a single medal.

     *******

The Starburst For Extreme Heroism is a six-pointed starburst done in
silver.  At the center of the burst is the Imperial sun, done in the
correct color for the recipients branch.  Navy=Yellow, Scouts, red, Army
Black, etc..).  The award is worn on an inch wide ribbon around the neck.
The ribbon is deep blue.

Wound Awards are given to any service member who is injured as the direct
result of enemy action.  It is a pin worn on the uniform blouse, and comes
in three grades: Bronze (1-4 awards), Silver (5-8) and Gold (9 or more).
The Gold Wound Award is sometimes called the Expert Target Badge.

I\'m basing these ideas on a whole bunch of different sources.  The campaign
medals are British.  I have my great-Grandfather\'s medals, which are done
in this style.  The medals for valor are based on the German pracice of
issuing higher categories of the same award.  I prefer the term wound award
to Purple Heart, so I\'ve changed it here.

Once I get a decent drawing prog, I\'ll do these up right for my pages.

The only direct conversion fusion experiment that I know of (Although I
believe their are others) is Electrostatic Inertial Confinement Fusion.
This device has two electrodes which act to force the positive ions and
negative electrons into the core of the spherical device.  The anode and
cathode are both spherical, with the cathode being smaller and porous
(i.e. - a grid) placed inside the anode.

Once breakeven is exceeded, the excess power produced by the reaction
is siphoned off the cathode.

<SPECULATION>
This device architecture has it\'s own problems which may keep it from
ever achieving breakeven.  The thing that I really like about it though
is that a full size containment core has been predicted to be about 1meter
in diameter.  The device is also inherently stable as well.  When you turn
on the power to start the device it comes on in a matter of seconds and
stays
on until either the fuel runs out, or the switch is shut off.  Once the
device actually achieves breakeven (if ever), it would seem that the only
way
to turn off the device is to place a large current load across the output.
</SPECULATION>

I like the architecture and simplicity of a spherical device.  I like it
so much that it is the method that is used IMTU.

So there is ... I\'d missed it becase the examples given (TL D) have no TL 
modifier.  There is also a TL effect on the total number of squadrons you 
get - roughly a third extra squadrons for each 4 TL superiority.

These two features taken together give around the right sort of TL 
advantage, but I would still prefer to see a straight Cr-based method of 
determining how much a squadron costs and then adjusting the combat 
results for TL.   I guess i always like to fiddle with the rules to make 
them fit my perception of a Sci-Fi universe.

Interestinly, I have been reading several of David Weber\'s excellent 
"Honor Harrington" books.  In that universe, TL effects work pretty much 
as they do in Imperial Squadrons.

Grayson = moderate POP (8) , moderate TL (A)
BatRon = 5 DF / 2 AF / 1 BF / 1 JMP

Manticore = hi POP (9), good TL (D)
CruRon AF = 7 DF / 3 AF / 2 BF / 2 JMP

The Grayson "Battleships" are smaller than the Cruisers from Manticore in 
the books, and that is how they work out in Imperial Squadrons.

The Manticore CruRon can take on nearly 2 Grayson BatRons (again, both in 
IS and in the Harrington books).  

Perhaps I like the IS system after all :-)

    'body' => 'There were some errata published for the 1977 version which I have:
 
Sequence of play, Imperial maintenance and Production (clarification):
Income
Production & Imperial replacement
Imperial Attention
Apeals to the Emperor
Maintain Old ships
Purchase new ships
 
Ships that are in a Tertiary hex, with a tanker, are considered to be 
fuelled and may break off combat as long as the (friendly) tanker is 
present at the beginning of the combat phase.
 
Combat: immediately after range is determined termination of combat is 
determined.  the attacker first must announce if he is breaking off or 
remaining to attack.  then the defender declares.  It is possible for 
both sides to break-off, inwhich case no side fires.
 
Terminating Combat: break-off may be to more than one system, if 
desired.  If multiple destinations are used, all must be of equal 
priority
 
Terminating combat: Ships that are not able to break off (such as 
monitors and fighters not in motherships) may not fire in the round 
that their forces retreat, but may do so in subsequent rounds.
 
Planetary bombardment: only ships that did not use high-intensity 
missile fire may participate.
 
Planetray defense fire: ships that both bombard and attempt a landing 
are attacked twice by each world, outpost or planetary defence marker.
 
Fighters: fighters may use capital ships as a base.  Each capital ship 
counter (M, B, B1, B2, BB) can support one fighter unit.  Fighters not 
inside a mothership cannot retreat from combat, but must remain.  At 
the conclusion of space combat sub-phase, all fighters without a base 
are eliminated (they run out of fuel).
 
Economics (Terran):  A world is connected to Sol for income purposes 
only if the path contains no empty systems, other than tertiary hexes.
 
Economics (Imperial): A world is considered connect for the initial 
set-up if it can trace a path to Gashida, the path must contain no 
empty systems, other than tertiary hexes.
 
Recover from disruption: disrupted ships do not get a dice modifier for 
being at a friendly outpost.
 
Ship production: monitors may only be placed in space, never on a 
planet surface.
 
Imperial replacements: these appear through Ishkur, Dingir, Kinunir or 
Gashida.
 
Victory levels (clarification):
Turn   Win   lose
 4     9     1
 5     8     2
 6     7     3
 7     6     4
 8     -     5
 
Appeals to the emperor: these may not be attempted if they would reduce 
the glory to or below the "lose" level.  i.e glory 0 on turns 1 to 3, 
glory 1 on turn 4, etc.
 
Territorial exchange (outposts):  A tenable path may contain empty 
systems (i.e with neither world nor outpost), unlike a connected path.
 
Territaoral exchange: if a binary stellar hex is occupied by both terra 
and the Imperium, then the hex is considered tenable by both sides.  
However, players may wish to agree to a "mutual withdrawl" in which 
case both outposts are removed from play.  Note that worlds are always 
tenable. 
 
Starting the first war: For the initial set-up (only) all worlds and 
outposts must be connected to Gashida.
 
Terraforming: If there is always an outpost present, past turns of 
terrforming are not lost.  Thus it is possible for a world to be 
terraformed alternately by Imperial and Terran players, with only 50 
total turns (150 RU) required.  Each turn 3 RU is not spent will "undo" 
one D6 worth of terraforming turns.
 
===============
One of the nice things about the errata is that the Imperial set up is 
restricted so that all the ouposts and worlds must be connected to 
Gashida.  The Imperial set up can include Procyon (plus Ys and Sarpedon 
if you want), but at the risk of exposing the left side of the board to 
terran expansion.  This is one of may favorite "high risk" strategies 
as it takes the fight right to the Terrans while allowing them to 
expand to the rich worlds on the lower left of the board.  This set up 
gives a very different game to the usual bottlenecks of Nusku/Dushaam 
and Sirius.  The drawback for the Imperial player is that the outposts 
"beyond" Sirius do not generate income on the first turn, unless his 
reaction ships happen to place a tanker there <evil grin> during the 
Terran\'s first turn.
 
======================

Altair is still there on my hard board version.

What would the smaller version look like then?  I mean the rectangle that goes
on the left breast of uniform jackets, at least in US, where the medal is not
present, just a rectangle of the ribbon but clusters and stars etc. are
attached.  Would you have separate small ribbons for each plate when you\'re not
wearing the full medal?

That\'s a relief... just like taxes, I\'ve been putting this off :-)Actually,
I\'ve been having some difficulty with SSDS SAL but I think its working now.
One question though.  Can we just  append our name and firm to the output HTML
from SSDS?  Or do we need more formatting (lynx compatability, etc.)?

I don\'t use the fruit salad IMTU.  If you are dressed up enough for awards,
were the things!  Remember, your avarage Marine Sergeant with eight years
service might have two or three campaign ribbons, and one of two valor medals.

If wanted, you could do a ribbon based on the pattern of the medal\'s full
supporting ribbon (this is how it\'s done for US forces.)  Possibly with
small metal dots or studs for each banner earned. It\'s the Reader\'s Digest
version, you know he was there, and got into some interesting scraps, but
not the details.

I don\'t know... part of the joy of getting them is having the thing pinned
on, and beiong able to hold it.  In a military enviroment, where good work

Those little coloured squares seem to be peculiar to the US. Certainly
militaries decended from the British don\'t use them. To us they were just
another reason to laugh at dumb Yanks. 

Nothing quite like being in a small, impoverished military to encourage the
finding of reasons to make fun of your richer friends. Besides they get
given out for the dumbest things. In NZ you get a ribbon/medal for being in
a campaign or peacekeeping mission, you should get one for long service
after 12 years, and other than that it\'s pretty much only bravery that\'ll
get you anything.

Better recheck your sources. The "full up" unit that was the last one
tested was essentially identical to what would have been flown except
for the way things were arranged, had an Isp of well over 700. That\'s
almost *double* the best chemical rockets.

Remember, double the Isp means that you only need to haul half as much
fuel around. And for "multi-stage" situations, the advantage goes up
exponentially.

You misunderstand. The AI may be *wrong*, but it\'s not *uncertain*. I\'m
sure you\'ve been in that situation at least once in your life. :-)

And due to the *way* AIs learn, every time you give ioner an
instruction you are potentially modifying the rulebase. To know enough
to ask questions *after* it is given a "reason" for the exception
requires data/experience which the AI *won\'t have*.

That\'s the difference between *most* people and an AI or expert system.
We have "irrelevant" knowldege that makes us go "Hey, wait a second!" 
All the AI has is what it\'s been taught.

Well, IMTU things are a little different. Why use a keyboard when you can just speak to your translator?

The Language Translator as specified in WBH p. 28 can translate from one spoken sentence to another. I\'d say it should be pretty simple to produce an add-on to the Language Translator that translates spoken words to Hiver \'language\' and vice-versa.

This reminds me of another arrangement, that strikes me as odd: In the Travellers\' Digest #6, grav belts are described as controlled be a special mouthpiece or stud/joystick controlled by the chin. These seems to me to be clunky interfaces, considering other Traveller technology. IMTU, grav belts have always been controlled by a combination of Data/Display Headsets and voice control. Much more elegant, IMHO.

This touches on the subject of Traveller technology \'canon\'. Personally, I keep any canon technology where a change would alter the structure of the universe (e.g. Jumps take one week, and it\'s not possible to change that fact), but change insignificant technologies if they don\'t make sense.

The above mentioned are two examples. For me, it doesn\'t make sense to use a keyboard for translation, when you can just talk. We\'re not even touching upon the subject of Traveller technology versus real world technology here; voice/speech recognition is possible in the Traveller universe, so why not make use of it?

BTW - remember: Language Translators are imprecise at best. For more reliable automated language translation, use a sofisticated translator robot (e.g. the TL 15 Shageder, as detailed on http://www2.dk-online.dk/users/mark_seemann/shageder.htm )

Also, it\'s a lot easier to get somewhere in the same orbit than it is
to get out of a gravity well.  A ship in low orbit may be closer than
one in the 100 diamter orbit on the other side of the planet, but not
necessarily quicker or easier to get there.  Though with up to 6g
continuous thrust, that\'s not going to be a big problem...

There\'s a project going on right now to teach an AI a lot of irrelevant
things.  They\'ve been working on it for years teaching it everything
they can think of, *not* what\'s relevant for any particular task.  I
believe they\'ve been testing it by having it recognize parts of

    'body' => 'Saw the Lost In Space movie on Saturday. I won\'t go into a movie review
beyond observing that if you have a warm spot in your heart for the series,
you will most likely enjoy the movie (especially a couple of things Major
West does to Doctor Smith, and a rather interesting lecture that Maureen
delivers to John and Major West). If you didn\'t like the series, well, the
special effects are at least are as good as anything recent on the big
screen for SF.  Storylinewise, we have a retelling of \'Reluctant Stowaway\',
\'The Derelict\' and \'Blast off into Space\' episodes.

Traveller Observations:

*Danger* Non Imperium Setting! *Danger* Non Imperium Setting!
*Danger* Non Imperium Setting! *Danger* Non Imperium Setting!

Constructing a \'Lost In Space\' type adventure will be easier for
Traveller:TNE than for Classic, MT or T4. The FTL drive mechanism implied in
the movie follows the FFS/1 Wormhole and Stargate format more than standard
Traveller Jump Drives. 

Based on comments from the dialogue, traversing Hyperspace without an
external gate on both ends of the trip is an exercise in intentional mis
jumping. A ship sized Hyperspace engine exists, but no means exists for
controlling the exit point of the jump at the time of the entry. In this
case, an anlogy to a Keyhole drive can be made, where the external keyhole
into a wormhole can be made, but once in, you can\'t make an internal keyhole
to get out, you  must proceed to where ever the wormhole naturally exits
back into normal space. The solution to this randomness is to externally
create keyholes by Hypergates, allowing you to enter and exit the wormhole.
This also fits with the Closed Door & Semi Permanent Drilled Wormhole types
of stargates described in FFS/1. When using this technology to get from star
to star, you pick a target star, setup a sleeper ship to carry a crew and
equipment to the target star, and, after a few decades, should have a
Hypergate built in that system to match one in your origin system so that
travel can now be instanteous between the systems. There is no interving
travel time or space ala B5 gates.

Militarily this will make gates very critical choke points. Destroy a gate
and you shut a system off from the rest of civilization until a new one is
built. A long night could very, very quickly be created by a band of
terrorists that manage to blowup multiple gates in a short time, depending
on where critical gate components are manufactured.  

Surprise attacks become very difficult. If you come thru the gate, odds are
the target system knows you are comming. If you don\'t, you need to plan the
attack decades in advance and send your troops off in sleeper ships.  This
can lead to the scenario where a task force launched decades ago finally
reaches a target long after the war is over.  Vaguely recall a ST:TNG
episode about a Klingon crusier returning after decades in deep space, with
orders for a sneak attack on the Federation, totally unaware that peace had
been made. 
 
There is no mention of a minimum distance from a mass before engaging.

Other techonlogy observations:

Gravitic technology: small objects can \'float\', larger objects still require
reaction type engines. The Jupiter Launch Vehicle demonstrates impressive
reaction thrust to launch. The space fighters also show reaction engines for
manuver. References are made several places to \'Fusion\' engines, assume to
mean HEPLAR. 

Robotics: Most robots shown are large, using treads as mobility. Assumption
is that robots are capable of handling self contained AI as operating
system, with external overrides by humans. Alien life is silicon based, but
still living, not contstructed, so does not count as \'robotic\'. 

Communications and Computers: Extensive use of Holographics in
communications and in computer control and remote equipment operation.
Offline storage media appear to be little different than current CDs. No
crystal matrix chips.

Weapons. Electric discharge units to provide \'stunning\'. Pistols are bulky,
could either be laser or small plasma. Body armor is retractable though no
visible means, so no anlogy to traveller tech is possible. Seems to be a
borrow from the \'Batman\' movies.


That\'s about all I can think of now. If they novelize the movie (about as
likely as rain during the monsoon season), I think I will pick it up to see
if the chosen writer wishes to expand on any of the techology subjects.

Yeah, well the US Army is notorious for award medals for anything.  One of
my favorite Bill Maudlin cartoon has Willie and Joe staring in rapt
fascination at a rear area MP\'s ribbons while he patiently explains what
they all mean.

Hell, I got an Army Commendation Medal during training!  I even received an
Army Achievement Medal for maxing the test for the Field Hygiene &
Sanitation NCO Course.  I\'m not kidding.

That\'s why I went with the British and German models, to make the uniforms
a bit cleaner.

Actually, now that you mention it, and after a good night\'s sleep, yes we
do use them. From what I saw they\'re worn with Service Dress (a variant on
WWII field dress, and now used as a dress uniform for all but the most
formal occaisions), and even then a lot of soldiers with medals for thins
above long service and campaigns prefer to use the full medals. The most
beribboned officer I ever saw served in Vietnam, and in a lot of UN
peacekeeping during the twenty years following. One reason he had so many
awards was that in NZ you can wear non-commonwealth ribbons on the right
breast, opposite your commonwealth ones, and he a quite a lot of ribbons
from the countries he\'d served in.

In the peacetime NZ Army the only medal an enlisted soldier can look
forward to is the Long Service Medal, and you have to be in for twelve
years (I think, it might be only ten) and have a fairly clean record to be
eligible. The officers have a similar award, but I think they only need ten
years service to it. A few senior NCOs and some officers get to go on UN
peacekeeping, and they\'ll get campaign medals for that.

the entrepeneur started another company.

Modern society is less tolerant of bankrupcies, and expects the government

ObTrav: If you\'re basing your Traveller campaign on the mercantilist

borrowing the social elements as well. Moneylenders, for example, were
regarded as a necessary evil and certainly not respectable company, and
defaulting on a loan was not a permanent social or diplomatic stigma.

Why, i have at least one Wormhole IMTU. It leads from an empty hex (with sun though) in
Regina subsector to another empty hex in the Solomani Rim (Imperial SpacE)
Both are guarded by extremely secret task forces (even those aboard don´t know where
they are). Both hexes additionally are extrem navigational hazards, so the Wormholes
arehard to find. Lastly, the largest size that can be safely transported is 10, so
jump-capable ships can´t pass (no JT´s IMTU). This way, it can´t change Imperial history
to have these holes as the SM and SR are approx. the same distance from Core. I used to
transport my campaign from the SR to the SM once. Great fun!

German military also has these bars with these squares. However, as the German Military
doesn´t have this many medals anymore, and out of area missions are fairly recent as
well (and most don´t have medals either), most officers have only one bar.

Hhhmmm,  I know that the U.K. forces I served with in Berlin certainly used
the little rectangles of cloth that represent the full medal.  They are
called "ribbons" and have a smaller attachment (but identical) that is used
to represent multiple or specific awards.  These are worn on "Dress"
uniforms when worn day to day as your duty uniform.  IIRC the German armed
forces did the same thing as the others.  Hell even the police in Boston
just wear the representative ribbons and not the full decoration/medal.

In the U.S. Army the actual medals are almost never worn.  Really formal
occasions you wear a "miniature" in lieu of the full size so that you don\'t
clank so much or walk around lop sided.  The U.S. uses campaign stars on the
combat ribbons.  These are small five pointed bronze stars that attach to
the ribbon.  I received the the "Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal" twice and
its subsequent award was also a star because it is considered a
campaign/combat medal.  My medal for visiting Vietnam has three stars for
the specific campaigns that occurred while I was in country.  As it turns
out I personally DIDN\'T actually join in on anything specific during that
time but I none the less stayed busy.  Multiple awards of most medals are
added to the ribbons as "oak leaf clusters" with the fifth award being a
silver vice bronze one.  I have the Army Commendation Medal (Arcom) 6th

  This works pretty well for humans at whatever TL the ref likes (maybe

Why is everyone hearking back to \'Batman\' for a description of the body
armor in \'Lost In Space\' when that concept as _body_ armor was , IIRC
first used (and quite impressively, I might add) in the Stargate movie?

Or put your refueling stations in free solar orbit and keep the system\'s ephemeris updated with a probable point and jump to *there*.

This reminds me of the scene in _Predator_ where Arnie is combatting the 
Predator and throws a rock to distract him. The Predator\'s visuals/sensors(?)
track the rock\'s trajectory back to where Arnie is standing and begins to
blast 
away at him. My question is, at what level of technology would this sort of
stuff and the above be possible? And if it can track gauss slugs back, can it
also track normal slug throwers back to their origin? This could have a very
important and unforeseen consequences both for the life span of snipers in the
Far Future, and for an ambush I\'m planning in an upcoming slug fest this week
in the Not So Far Future...

The U.S. has had "Counter Mortar/Counter Battery radars doing that since the
Korean conflict.  It would seem to me that to track a slug would be tough
because its so small.  You would need an acquisition radar that could pick
up the slug which would mean a very very narrow beam width and the general
direction of where it would come from.  Not impossible today, just tough.

I believe there is something called a Claribel early warning system.  It uses
millimeter radar to detect slugs.  I think it can track them  back to source, not
exactly but in the right direction.

Note that due to the nature of a laser, you can only sense it head on (unless it
difuses through some medium).  Thus, tracking a laser is not possible. If you use
gravitic focusing though, a grav sensor may be able to sense the focusing tunnel.
Another possibility with gravitic focusing is surrounding your ship with a
suspended plasma field.  When the gravitic focus beam strikes your ship, the
plasma discharges through the beam back to the firing ship.

I recall reading that there is *currently* a project using
millimeter(?) radar to track sniper fire. And yes, it will make life
"interesting" for snipers, the way counter-battery radar is starting to
make life interesting for artillery.

	Current counter-artillery fire. Radar tracks trajectory of bad guys
shells, good guy arty responds. Getting to the point of tracking
small arms fire is also currently in work--specifically aimed at
snipers, etc. in peacekeeping operations.

That\'s one of the prime reasons I like TNE.  The alternate tech and ground up
system.  I\'ve devised a FF&S "Star Wars" baseline technology so i could design
SW ships for Battle Rider (much better than just picking #s)... i had to make
a few assumptions along the way (and write up a couple tech pieces), but... :

WBH p. 28, under language translator:

TL 9:  Limited audio/no visio
TL 10: Improved audio/limited video
TL: 12 Quality audio/quality video
TL: 14 Pocket sized unit

By TL 12 I\'d say the unit will have a camera on it.  Point it at the Hiver
that\'s waving it\'s tentacles at you and you\'ll hear speach coming out of
the unit (assuming its programmed for Hiver).  I\'d only use the keyboard
stuff for pre-TL 12 communication.

I can see that I was thinking pretty much \'humano-centric\' here, as I really hadn\'t considered the implications from a Hiver\'s point of view. However, I would still consider that a sofisticated Language Translator would be able to handle finger-wriggling as well. Granted, visual pattern recognition is a more advanced technology than voice/speech recognition, but certainly that technology must be in place before TL 15 as well.

Traveller robots are able to navigate by visual sensors (i.e. by seeing), so the technology should be there already. I will admit that a Language Translator trying to pick up a Hiver\'s finger wriggling could produce some faulty translation, but that\'s also the case with spoken language.

A sofisticated translator robot with synaptic processing and storage (and some experience) should be able to translate to and from Hiver finger wriggling fluently and expertly.

Off course, the drawback here is the price of such a thing...

I wouldn\'t be *too* harsh with the roll except for absolute cutting edge
stuff... if the system has been available for more than half a TL or so
(using Tech Levels as a dating system... is that kosher?), it\'s going to
be pretty damn rugged (by way of example, my Newton 120 has survived a
fall of about five feet, into a puddle in a parking lot, in the rain, with
nothing more serious happening than my cursing a lot and some scratches on
the case).

Figure that once an electronics technology becomes mature, it can be put
in a case that is pretty damn people-proof (note; this does not mean
Marine-Proof, or Scout-Proof, but it is certainly Navy-Proof or
Merchant-Proof) without too much extra expense (part of the reason
soldier-proof laptops, PDAs, etc. cost so much right now is that they are
limited market items; not many people need a laptop that can be dropped
off Mt. Rainier and still be usable, and most people aren\'t going to keep
their consumer electronics that long, because if a laptop, for example, is
three years old, it\'s two and a half years out of date; so who cares if it
doesn\'t work after a year and a half. It\'s not worth the extra cost (and
weight) to buy the one with the titanium frame and case, rubber gaskets,
and shock-absorbent design, when you\'ll be replacing it in a year or so
anyways.

By the time of the 3I, however, it can take generations for signifcant
technological advances to take place; the wrist-top your father bought
when he was in Uni is still a perfectly valid computer (though it\'s likely
out of style). So it\'s likely that such systems will be built to last a
lot longer than they are today; sure, some will be going for the "computer
of the year" trend-setters club (both producers and consumer), but a there
will be companies doing the Rolex/Timex "Built to Last" theory; good,
solid systems that will last forever.

at least, IM<ns>TU, that\'s how it works; I figure that most systems are
pretty rugged, unless the character is the type to buy frilly junk.

I\'m concentrating on the Imperial (Navy/Marine) decorations.. as far as I
care, the Stoudenese Army gives you a medal for not contracting a STD for
six months.

I would think Long Service medals (for 10, 20, and 30 years service) and
some sort of award for exemplary service in peacetime (called the Emperor\'s
Thanks).   I also have sketched out some awards like the Orbital Assault
badge (awarded to Jump Troops or Marines in the first wave of a planetary
assault) and the Protected Forces award (successful completion of vacuum
training.)

I\'m putting \'hitch hashes\' on their mess dress\' lower left sleeve.  One hash 
for every term.  And isn\'t the \'drop slash\' worn on the back collar the 
unofficial award for any crunchie making a jump into a hot LZ already?

I could see a Combat Infantrycritter Badge, simular to the US Army\'s CIB, 
which was handed out after 180 days in a *designated* combat zone (tho these 
days, they\'ll hand you one if somebody takes a shot at *you*...)

That could work.  I\'d love to see a Command Master Fleet Sergeant try to
ben his arm after 40 years of service.  The drop slash is an unofficial,
but oft-worn decoration.  No matter how it infuriates the Navy.

Hey!  I was an infantrycritter, so watch it!  :)

For the Marines, I don\'t think so.  Their job is to fight, why get an award
for doing your job?  That\'s also part of the idea behind the campaign
ribbons.  It\'s the same mind set that has the Marines not wearing their
jump wings on everyday dress.  "We all do it," they think, "why brag?  We
*know* we\'re the best."

Viability of Longhaul Trade

When considering the question of what commodities are traded between the
stars and how far it is profitable to trade them some analysis is useful.
The standard price for transport is set at 1000Cr  per displacement ton.
(The accuracy of that figure is another debate.) A displacement ton is 13.5
cubic meters, or 13,500 liters. A simple division gives us a number of
.075Cr to transport 1 liter one jump.
In order for goods to be profitable at their final destination, their cost
of transport can\'t be too  high. For the purposes of this analysis we will
pick the arbitrary number of 10% as our cutoff point. In other words, we
will assume that as long as the cost of transport is less than 10% of the
final sale price, imported goods can compete with local goods.
Therefore, if one was to transport an object taking up 1 liter 1 jump, the
cost of transport would be .075Cr, and the final sale price could be no
more than .75Cr. If you were transporting the same object 50 jumps (the
approximate length of the Spinward Main) it would cost 3.7Cr for transport
and the final price would have to be at least 37Cr to still compete.
This may seem a bit steep, but when you compare it against the cost and
volume of known items it turns out that a very wide variety of goods are
profitable, even when shipped hundreds of jumps. The table below is
compiled from data from the Referee?s Manual, and the Imperial
Encyclopedia. In fact, very few items there were sufficiently high-bulk,
low value not to be worth trading.
Even if you are more cynical and assume that the transport price can be no
more than 1% of the final price, that 1000Cr/ton is too little, that
import/export tariffs, space loss due to packing, or other such things
combine to decrease the profitability be even two orders of magnitude (100
times more expensive than my assumptions) there are still a significant
number of profitable items.
In the table below Item is the name in the books for the commodity, TL is
the tech level I used for the vol/cost calculations, and Jumps is the
number of jumps that you can ship the item such that the cost of transport
is less than 10% of the final price.

I have too.  I remember asking a guard in Windsor Castle about his service
ribbons when I was younger, in fact.  One was for North Africa -- and these
were definitely the smaller ribbons, not medals.

Now. there are experimental(?) systems to track sniper bullets via an
acoustic signature, and we can track arty shells, including mortars, back
to their source for rapid counterfire very quickly.

Hivers themselves developed a voice synthesizer that was used to convert

The important missing phrase WBH was produced by DGP for MT *in 1989 or
1990* (I think).

The book is now out of print.  Your only hope of getting a copy is (1) It
comes up for sale on this list or (more likely) rec.games.rpg.marketplace
or (2) Roger Sanger (holder of the DGP copyrights) decides to allow
reprinting of this tome and a few others which are still quite popular as
gaming aids (such as the Starship Operator\'s Manual, 101 Vehicles, 101
Robots, etc).  I cannot hold out much hope for either.

While you are looking, you can get some (or lots) of the same information
from equally difficult to locate books such as;

Grand Census
Grand Survey
Scouts (CT book 6)

Yes, we are tight with our awards, and we have had lots of fun at the
other service\'s lavish systems.  

I wore my gold wings ("I don\'t know but its been said/Army wings are
made of lead") on my everyday uniform.  The one I wanted to wear but
wasn\'t permitted to was the "rigger" wings that I earned at the Army
parachute rigger school in Fort Lee.  We had very few riggers in the
USMC....and most of \'em were in my Air Delivery Platoon...

ObTrav:  I have played only CT.  Are there any rules for unmanned
resupply similar to air drop missions in any of the other systems?

Thanks for all the work.  You know, I think this analysis points out a
problem in Imperial trade.  It\'s difficult for a starship to make enough
money carrying freight to pay off it\'s mortgage, but you can ship TL 2
tents 45 jumps before the price of shipping gets to high. 

Either the megacarriers are doing a whole hell of a lot of interstellar
trade (as in each industrial planet in a subsector specializes in a
different set of commodities and the megacarriers ship between them, or we
need to raise shipping costs somewhat (maybe to 2,000 Cr/Td). 

Actually at this level it would be easier to make a living hauling cargo,
but the viability of long-distance trade would still be high.  I think
we\'re looking at a lot more trade than most people think.  I sort of like
this idea. 

Just as a start this would have a few obvious game impacts:

1) Rich folks on any world with a starport could have high tech stuff,
*regardless* of the tech level of the world.  More importantly, some of
the rich folk\'s private guards would have high tech weapons and armor. 
This spices up visits to those TL 5 &6 worlds in a way I like a whole lot. 

2) This type of interdependence likely existed during the First & Second
Imperium\'s also.  This would explain why the Long Night was so tough on
lots of worlds.  Even many of the wealthy, industrial worlds were not even
close to self-sufficient. 

Trade in the Imperium isn\'t just shipping out valuable surplus goods
(which largely defined pre-trade), it\'s producing goods which are used to
buy vital necessities which are not produced at home (much like trade in
the late 20th century).

Double the ISP of a good chemical rocket (400), but with terrible
thrust-to-weight; NERVA doesn\'t have a whole lot of advantage as a
first stage, and we lack a pressing application for a high-ISP
upper stage.

(ObTraveller: Try designing ships using the basic NTR in FFS2 - you\'ll
find it\'s very much a niche engine. Even the TL-9 GasCore NTR is
hard to work with (see my  lifter design I posted a while ago.)

It\'s much better than "half as much fuel" since delta-V goes as
ISP*log(mass fraction), but still it\'s an overstatement to (as the
original poster did) assume that everything would be perfect if only
we had carried on with it\'s development. (Though it\'s a common flaw
in discussions of space policy; other favourite "if only we had..."
subjects include DynaSoar and (especially) Orion, which is usually
assumed to solve all of humanities ills for no money at all, as well
as making julienne fries.

For an interesting perspective on alternate history, take a look at
Stephen Baxter\'s "Voyage": NASA persists with a manned mission to Mars
after Apollo, but at the cost of not doing Pioneer or Voyager or HST
or pretty much anything else.

Yes. Although this is the sort of technology (like smart/homing
bullets) that probably doesn\'t fit with Traveller technological
conservatism.

Like air, for example. Or even relatively thick (inner-solar-system)
vacuum; weapons laser pulses are pretty intense. You wouldn\'t see them
with the naked eye but would with a good sensor. If you\'re anywhere
in the general direction it\'s pointed (within +-30 degrees or more)
you\'ll see off-axis light coming out of the emitter, too.

All right, i don´t have anything on the Chirpers up yet, but anything i could find about
the Droyne and the Ancients. See my sites The Ancients: History on the History, Sites
for Sites and Artifacts for (you guessed it:) Artifacts.
I think i am going to add anything i have on the Chirpers real soon, when i have time
again, probable sometime next week! I´ll post an announcement when i am done.
As always, if you feel something is missing on my site write me and i´ll add it.
Coming soon as well: Info included in Aliens 1: V&V.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been playing around with the wonderful Robot spreadsheet Andrew 
Aiken (sp?) created.

It\'s great, but it points out a crucial problem with the robot brains, 
they are simply too big and too expensive at higher tech levels.  Fuel 
cells go up in efficiency as do batteries, but the CPU and storage units 
don\'t.

We have

Type			Vol (liters)	Wt (kg)	Cost CR		TL
CPU, linear		0.2		0.1	500		8
CPU, parallel		0.5		0.1	10,000		9
CPU, synaptic		0.1		0.1	50,000		11
Storage, standard	0.5		0.1	250		8
Storage, synaptic	0.1		0.1	25,000		11

This seems silly to me, how about one simple change:

Price, volume, and weight are all halved for every TL above the one where
they were introduced:

So at TL 15 we have

Type                    Vol (liters)    Wt (kg) Cost CR         TL
CPU, linear             0.0016          0.0008     4	      	15
CPU, parallel           0.008           0.0016  150       	15
CPU, synaptic           0.006           0.006   3,200        	15
Storage, standard       0.004           0.0008  2             	15
Storage, synaptic       0.006           0.006 	1,600       	15

This seems about right, sure it makes robots cheaper, but at higher TLs 
they *should* be cheaper.  Fuel cells, grav modules, batteries, sensors,
and limbs still cost the same so they won\'t be dirt cheap.  Also, fancy
configurations like pseudo-bio robots will still be expensive, so I\'ve no
real problem with this.

I\'d make a few other changes as well: 

On page 44 it says:  "A robot with intelligence 0 will no perform properly
unless instructed by someone with Robot Ops skill, and a robot with
intelligence of 4- (a dumbot) requires supervision of its work at
occasional intervals." 

I\'d limit low data robots to Int 0 regardless of TL and High Data robots
to Int 4 or less regardless of TL.  Having a Int 6 Low Data robot is possible
at higher tech levels, and simply doesn\'t make sense to me.

From the text it suggests that Low and High autonomous robots were the first
really practical robots, which suggests they are the only ones which can 
work unsupervised (ie Int 5+).  

Other than that, it\'s a great book and a great spreadsheet.

However, I would still consider that a sofisticated Language Translator
would be able to handle finger-wriggling as well. Granted, visual pattern
recognition is a more advanced technology than voice/speech recognition, but
certainly that technology must be in place before TL 15 as well.

  Presumably even at TL 13-15 there might be a (brief) learning period for
the system to learn to accurately read an individual Hivers signings - if
you assume that their will be individual idiosyncrasies.

  The question arose because I was looking at the TNE 25mm Hiver figure and
didn\'t see a clearly identifiable output device.

Late in TL 9, the relationship between gravity and lightspeed becomes
apparent as insystem travel becomes commonplace.  Applying some
subatomic theories on a macro-scale, similar to contragravitics, a
method is developed to generate a reduced inertia field. With inertia
reduced, accelerating to significant fractions of C becomes relatively
easy. Of course generating this inertia-less field is VERY energy
expensive. Travel within a system at FTL speeds becomes possible, but
relies on gravitational forces (albeit minute) to get from point A to
point B.  This later becomes known as Jump-0 capability.

Further advances in partical theory and beam focusing leads to a method
of transfering between the vastness of space to other systems.
Electrons are fired towards your destination while you generate a
positron cloud (stripped from protons) and suspend it within a magnetic
field.  The positrons are then attracted to the electrons which pull the
field and ship forward at a fraction of the speed of light.  As gravity
drops away, lightspeed increases and thus ship speed.  Hydrogen is used
due to its simple atomic structure. This is called Jump-1.  This comes
about at TL 10. Note that it takes about half a week to get out of the
microgravity into the near infinite speed between the stars.

From TL 11 to 15, improvements in focusing and energy production
technology allows for better targeting of the electron beam, thus
extending the range of jumps.  Since you\'re travelling at near infinite
between the stars most of the trip takes no time thus keeping the jump
time to about one week (half a week leaving a system and half a week
entering the target system)

With the drop off in beam focusing technology after TL 15 and the
inefficiency (42% of volume taken up by jumpdrive and fuel) of long jump
technology,  further advances are put on hold.  However, the
positron/electron anihilation observed in jump bubbles  does lead to
matter/antimatter technology (TL 17) and eventually jumps are applied on
a microscale (Teleportation, TL 18) and to weaponry (jump projectors, TL
21)

I always thought, at least according to canon, that one doesn\'t accelerate

I never was satisfied with the canonical reference to "the unique topology of
J-space".  If you disappear from A and reappear at B with no time lapse, I can
accept the conservation of momentum in that for no time does your momentum
change.  You simply move without changing velocity.

However, J-space doesn\'t work that way.  It takes a week.  Thus you break the
conservation of momentum twice (once when you enter jumpspace, once when you
return).  Since you move a finite distance in a finite time, you do have some
form of velocity.  In order for jumps to take the same amount of time
regardless of distance, the majority of the distance must be covered at a
speed approaching infinity.

My approach to the "unique topology of J-space" is to make it gravity
dependent (which the 10/100 diameter limit seems to imply).  An analogy would
be a skateboarder on top a plateau.  He takes a sighting of another plateau
and then blindfolds himself.  Then he races down the side of the plateau
accelerating as he hits the valley between them.  His top speed is in the
valley, but he\'s only there for a split second as he races up the other side.
Coming to a stop at the top of the other plateau.  There, he takes off the
blindfold and pushes himself around with his foot.  Note that if he didn\'t get
a good bearing, he could race right by his target plateau through the valley
until he slams into another one.  That would be a catastrophic misjump.

In any case, I haven\'t seen any canonical reference to
accelerating/decelerating in jumpspace at all.  But then again, I haven\'t seen
much of any references to jump space. Its always seemed to have a mysterious
magical "it just works" veil around it.

IMTU, I just declared that \'maybe 2 or 3 sophonts in Known Space understand 
how jumpspace works.  They all went crazy, and they haven\'t been seen in 
decades.\'  For the ones who pressed the matter, I repeatedly reminded them 
that they didn\'t need to know how electricty works to turn on the lights.

Eventually, I came up with the \'superball theory\'.  A ship opens up 2 holes in 
space connected by a \'tube\'.  The \'length\' of the tube is dependent on the 
jump number capability of the jump drives.  The ship then \'falls\' into the 
tube, drops to the \'bottom\', then bounces back and leaves the other hole in 
the new location.  No energy is lost in the transfer, and any energies picked 
up in the tube are used in the bounce back to normal space.

You realize of course that your "superball theory" works the same way as my
"skateboard theory".  You accelerate to the bottom of the tube (where you\'re moving
at maximum velocity) then you decelerate back up the tube.

  This is now up on my page. The dotmap is derived from the

GDW set the sector aside as a Referee\'s Preserve for the most part,
so you wan\'t find anything official aside from this one (rather rare

Not quite. You have to add in the cost of the time the good will be in
transit. This is very signifigant with extermely high value goods.

You also have to use the \'real\' cost of transport, not the silly
Cr1000/jump number. I would use Hans\' table - remember, your freight is
someone else\'s speculative cargo.

I think this is conservative ... given economies of scale, you should be
able to get cost reductions of more than 10% through specialisation and
exchange.

If you are transporting something 50 parsecs, dont take it on a jump-1
freighter. It just isnt cost-effective.

Yes.

Yes.

<stuff deleted> I have done similar analysis with the intermediate goods in
FFS2. The end result is the same - you can transport many goods a long,
long way for 10% of their cost.

Hmmmmmmmmmmm.

Kinda like the underground gravity powered trains they\'ve been talking about 
for the last umteen years.  You dig a tunnel between here & there in a 
straight line.  Pump out the air, & line it with superconductor magnets big 
enough to let the tunnel car slide thru without tearing up the ring magnets.  
The car accellerates til it hits midpoint, then decellerates.  Thing is, a 
trip *anywhere*, regardless of actuall length, takes about 20 mins.

*HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM*.  There\'s an analogy for ya...

Very nice shop, a close contender with Rochester, NY\'s Crazy Egor\'s
Game Emporium for the best source in the American Northeast for
out of print and hard to find gaming stuff. I\'ll be in the Big Apple
next week for a training seminar, Compleat Strategist is on
my short list of places to stop...Martian Metals, Dark Horse
and Metal Magic sci-fi miniatures, here I come!!  :)

Speaking of Crazy Egor\'s in Rochester - last time I was there
(about 2 years ago), he had some of the original 15mm
Traveller minis in stock. Just for anyone who is looking...

All I\'m saying is:
1)    there should be a "nobler" side to M:0
2)    Cleon as presented is very one-dimensional
3)    how much actual game play did the ideas in M:0 get before print?

The shuttle give you 450-500 isp and NERVA was 1100-1300 right? Classifying
the shuttle as TL 8 is akin to saying that todays state of the art mountain
bikes are TL 8 and therefore we should fly the shuttle with them.

Fission rockets are at such an advantage compared to chemical ones that TL
5-6 ones easily outperform anything chemical no matter the TL.

Yes and no. You could say that my fusion plants are fusion plants with MHD

I think there was a computer game based on that premise...

Seriously though, the light speed assumption isn\'t so far fetched.  We do know
that gravity affects light\'s velocity (it can be bent).  I don\'t believe we\'ve
had concrete analysis of lightspeed outside our gravity well.  So, within our
constant gravity, c is constant.

There was a piece on Discovery channel about a image analysis
software/hardware combo that could track bullets to the firer in near
realtime. It gave the shot trajectories with say 0.5 seconds delay right on
the screen. The thing was intended for soldiers and police versus snipers
etc.

No - they didn\'t have the cool predator camouflage stuff ;-)

We\'ve measured the speed of light on Earth, from Earth to moon and back
again, to the moons of jupiter and back again etc and we\'ve gotten the smae

Can we say Jovian censored moons????

I expect Mars to pretty much be a bustout, but the Jovian moons should be 
worth living on...

However, we\'ve done these measurements still inside of the sun\'s gravity well.

Funny you should say this, I\'ve almost finished developing an advanced chargensystem based
on Mercenary and High Guard, but I want it to be thorough
across as many careers as possible.  To do this I need whatever Chargen stuff there
is in Merchant Prince.  Not the details but whatever parallel there is to Branches
and Assignments as depicted in Merc. and High Guard.

If any one could post or send such, assuming it exists, I will quickly post my advanced
chargen proposal.

Exactly!  I\'ve run my formula (based on actual parsec travel outside the gravity well
taking 1 minute) and you don\'t see a REALLY noticable jump in light speed until orbit
zone 10 or 11 (58,000 light seconds).  This same formula doesn\'t cross the light year
boundary until day 3 hour 2:56.  Within the jump bubble, you\'re always moving at
about 1/5th c (its just that c increases exponentially.)

Seeing as how Pluto orbits the sun, we can assume that the sun\'s gravity extends to

Measurements of the fine structure of various spectral lines implicitly
measure the speed of light (to within a part in 10^3 or 10^4). Such measurements
have been performed for interstellar clouds that aren\'t in anyones
gravity well. No real evidence for variability of the speed of light.  

Also, if there was a significant variation in the speed of light between
us and Voyager or Pioneer (which are out past Pluto), we
would notice.

So what you are saying, if I understand the thread correctly, is that because we
are measuring the speed of light within the gravity well of SOL, our
measurements are innaccurate?

This would mean that there is a constant, but (AFAIK) currently undetected,
red/blue shifting of starlight depending on where Earth is located in relation
to the individual star and SOL.

By this I mean:

*                      *  *                  *
^                      ^  ^                  ^
|                      |  |                  |
Star 1               SOL  Earth              Star 2

At one point of Earth\'s orbit around Sol, Star 1 is on the far side of Sol from
the earth.  According to your theory, the light from Star 1 would be affected by
SOLs gravity field, and decelarate from Earth\'s perspective, as it loses energy
escaping the far side of the field.  This would cause a detectable red shift in
the light spectrum, would it not?  And the light from Star 2, accelerating down
the gravity well towards SOL, would have a detectable blue shift as it races
past Earth.

That would also mean that at a later point in Earth\'s orbit: 
*                   *  *                     *
^                   ^  ^                     ^
|                   |  |                     |
Star 1          Earth  SOL                   Star 2

The two stars have effectively changed positions with respect to earth.  Now
Star 1\'s light, instead of laboring up the gravity well from SOL, is still
rushing down towards it.  And Star 2\'s light is now working up the slope.  The
spectrum shifts from each should have reversed themselves.

This, to the best of my knowledge, has not been documented and that the Speed of
Light is a constant.  Am I wrong?

There is a measurable red shifting.

The whole red shifting thing requires more thought (I\'m not a stellar physicist) but I
do know that all stars have a red shift.  One theory is that Earth is in the center of
the universe and everything is moving out from it.  Another theory would be that as
stars move out from the center of the universe, they accelerate.   Thus all stars would
still be red shifted.  This is all from my jr. High science class (close to 13 years
ago) so I\'m not 100% certain of it.

But the real problem  with your hypothesis is that compared to stellar distances and
gravities, the Earth may as well not exist. Another problem is that while light may
accelerate outside the gravity well, it decelerates inside it.  So, you don\'t see the
change.

Keep in mind that the speed of light is slowed by the presence of a gravity well, it
doesn\'t accelerate into the well (well it does that too).  Hmm... what is the
implication of black holes with this theory?  Light would get deflected into the Black
Hole, but its velocity would slow down.  This then brings to mind the question, how
much gravity is needed to bring light to a stop?  Probably infinite concidering the
inverse proportionality of my theory...

Its all so mind boggling...

I don\'t know enough about that to be able to comment on it.

Here\'s part of the bias.  Presumably you\'re using light to measure the location of
the planets and thus its distance.  If lightspeed isn\'t constant, then you\'ll get a
biased distance.  If you then use this distance and measure the reflection time, the
bias will show up in its velocity.  I\'m also not too sure how accurate those
distances are measured.  Until we actually throw a tape measure out to Pluto to get
a non-light measurement, we can\'t be sure that our measuring methods aren\'t
influencing the results.

Hovever, the *instruments* registering these readings are still in the gravity 
well, either on Earth or still climbing out thru the Oort Clouds.

Think of it like this.  On the Autobaun in Germany, there is no speed limit.  
However, along parts of it, the Autobaun goes directly through towns and has 
stoplights on it.  Interstellar \'flat\' space, outside any distorting gravity 
well, would be where you\'d do the 150mph+ speeds, but you\'d slow it down to 30 
or 40 in town.  Got it?

Probably a good half-lightyear out or so.  Remember, there are some serious 
long-period comets out in the Oort Cloud the other side of Neptune (currently 
the furthest known planet from the Sun.  And yeah, the Oort Cloud is inside 
Sol\'s gravwell, since these objects are still in orbit around the Sun.

All gravity fields extend to infinity.  They just decrease as you get
farther and farther away.  Eventually, you can\'t detect them anymore,
but they\'re still there.

Given that gravity varies continuously, if the speed of light was
dependant on local gravity, you\'d get some strange curving as light
moved through the solar system.  I think that our space probes would
have noticed this as they moved around and through planetary gravity
fields.  Of course, that\'s in *our* universe.  In a game universe,
you could just say that this is true and that it had been noticed
from very early on.

Those were 1st generation NERVAs, Bruce.  Obviously, had we continued 
developing this technology, we would be approaching the theoretical 1100-1300.

Hmmm, this progression is not how many other things in traveller progress.
Generally we see (as in the case of EMS Active Sensors) a leveling off at
some high tech level after a few incremental increases.  So, under MT AEMS
(from the MT Referees Manual)

TL:      	10	11	12	14
Distant	        0.002 	0.001 	0.001 	0.001
V. Distant	0.010 	0.008 	0.006 	0.005
Regional	0.030 	0.016 	0.010 	0.008
Continental	0.070 	0.030 	0.016 	0.010
Planetary	0.130 	0.060 	0.025 	0.014
Far Orbit	0.260 	0.120 	0.055 	0.030

This table shows the mass in tons, volume and price are proportional.  Note
that the improvement from TL10 to TL11 is on the order of half (TL11 is 50%
of TL10), but that TL11 to TL12 is generally incremental, with more
improvement to the larger models as miniaturization takes its toll, but the
already-smaller models find it more difficult to squeeze components more.

This trend repeats in many other items from that sequence.

So rather than the dramatic improvement you propose, I would advocate a
halving of the *improvement ratio* for each tech level, and institute some
minimum volumes.

So one TL after introduction, numbers are halved.  Two TLs higher numbers
are multipliesd by half then .75, three TLs are multiplied by half, then
.75, then 87.5, and so on.

That\'s a counterproposal.  Now here\'s why I, as a GM, would never implement
*any* reductions IMTU.  Make these components that cheap and your players
will never have to deal with NPC crew ever again.  NPC crews are very
useful for everything from plot evolution to comic relief, and replacing
them with robots has proved problematic for me in two seperate long term
campaigns.

Recently, a player designed an engineering robot (not using Andrew\'s SS
alas) that was to be backup engineer and medic.  The original design had to
fiddled, prodded, refit, many items dropped (for volume considerations) and
we had trouble coming in under 1 Mcr.  *thats* the way it should be in my
opinion.  Talented robots should be expensive, otherwise humans would be
out of work and robots would be omnipresent, even in backwaters.

Economically, any company with the capital to invest will buy a robot
rather than employ a person.  Over my (45 year) work lifetime I will
probably cost my employers (in vaguely constant dollars) $3.2 Million
(assumes 3% annual avg increases, staring sal of $25k, and Emp. Benefits
cost of 40% of sal-which is kinda low).  If that employer could buy two
robots, each with a  20 year lifetime for about $2 million that could do my
job more consistently (though probably not better) and without losing the
robots to another employer (and all cost associated withthat problem) then
you bet they would do that!

Even if the company doesn\'t have the cash up front, I\'m certain that the
robot dealership would consider financing :).

Its a matter of being at the wrong end of the spectrum for our measurements.

Gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source (from
Newtonian physics).
My theory is that V = k/G + C = k\'*D^2 +C\'
Where k and C are  constants (k\' and C\' are different though related constants)
V is the speed of light
G is gravity
D is distance from gravity source

This produces a classic hyperbolic arc when charted V vs. G.
As G approaches infinity, dV/dG approaches zero.  Thus at relatively high G\'s (like inside
the Sun\'s gravity well, out to Pluto say...) the change in the speed of light isn\'t large
enough to measure.  However in microgravity, as G approaches zero dV/dG approaches
infinity.

Right now, we\'ve only been able to measure the speed of light over in the very flat area of
the hyperbola.  We haven\'t found zero G\'s yet, although we\'ve simulated it by offsetting
gravity with centrifugal force.

But J2-6 are the same price.   Which is REALLY screwy concidering the added cost

Thanks for the offer.  Dom just sent me some stuff that I need to parse through
first.  I\'ll let you know.

> BTW, I suggest a Law Enforcement career option.

I have it as branch of Agent.  It ties in fairly well with the Assignments I\'ve
come up with.  Here\'s a teaser. For the Law Enforcement branch of Agent, the
possible assignments for an Agent are:

Raid/Interdiction: directly going after criminals and their operations, most
often, but not always, dealing with contraband.  This assignment would also
include fugitive recapture (bounty hunting for the non-government employee).

Police:  The Coppers.  Officers in uniform patrol the streets, respond to calls,
chase criminals, make arrests, deal with emergencies, etc.  [Inspirational
Material: TROOPS]

Investigation:  Detectives and criminologists, attempt to solve crimes after the
fact, although they also investigate ongoing criminal activity.  They are charged
with making the case against a criminal by gathering evidence, examining
suspects, etc.  (Possibly undercover work but I think that is better handled as a
separate branch).

Security:  Think prison guard. But also guards for starports, member-world and/or
Imperium government offices.

Training:  Obvious.

Special:  Special duty, cross training, Detective School, Agent Commission,
undercover, etc.

The Branches of Agent are:
Law Enforcement
Intelligence
Covert Ops
Counter-Espionage
Support
(and maybe Prosecution to parallel to role that District and United States\'
Attorneys have in both the investigation of and punishment of crime.  In
Traveller, this might work as an option for governments with a Judge, Jury and
Executioner sort of career - early US Marshalls, Texas Rangers, Judge Dread).

There is not limit.  The Sun (and the Earth, and Jupiter, etc.) tug on
every object in the universe (its just that it gets weaker in an
inverse square relationship).

In any case, we have Voyager out about, IIRC, 8 light hours.  We know
where it is based on orbital mechanics.  It doesn\'t show any effect.
We also would see an effect on occultations (you would see the image
jump forward or back in time, giving a temporary double image one
instant and not image the other) which we don\'t see (we just see
the bending of light).

Well a long time ago in a White Dwarf there was a Bounty Hunter article.
It was usable on its own, but was intended that a character spent maybe a
term or two in either the armed forces or the law enforcements before
potentially getting a starship - Strontium Dog (2000AD) Bounty Hunter style.

I cannot remember the number of the White Dwarf at the moment or the name
of the author.

I disagree. I think that the bulk of the populace will be seeing a media
heavily biased towards the Imperium. My reading of the book was although
the Imperium is not very nice, it is not necessarily something that most
citizens will see unless they scratch the surface. Until the Pacification
Campaigns I would expect the Imperium to seem little different to the
Sylean Federation, aside from the fact it is now a state with a belief in itself.

When I want a nice, shiny progressive Imperium I travel forward to 1105...

	As a sphincto-rific anal-retentive space ops and gearhead wienie of
the first order, let me throw in:

	1. Technically, the sun\'s gravity extends to infinity.
	2. Nevertheless, all of the measurements were made over a course
with continuously variable local gravitational values (i.e.
curvature), and therefore fairly conclusively demonstrate, that the
speed of light does not depend on gravity ...

	Just because it\'s still within "the sun\'s gravity well" does NOT
mean that the gravity is constant anywhere in there ... remember
1/r^2.

In Voyager\'s case, it\'s moving away from the Earth at a constant speed.
(Well, not quite constant, but it\'s (small) deceleration can be easily
calculated.) So the distance between Earth and Voyager should be increasing
at a constant rate. We measure this distance through travel time for light
(radio) to get out to Voyager and back to us. If the speed of light out
where Voyager is was changing, pulses would be coming back sooner than we 
think; we\'d think that the distance to Voyager isn\'t increasing as fast as
we think it is - ie that Voyager is slowing down faster than predicted.
No such effect is observed.

In the case of planetary distances, we don\'t just have single measurements 
of the distance to a planet, but a complex set of multiple measurements as
the planets (and us) go around their orbits. For example, given distance 
between Earth and the sun you can calculate the mass of the sun. Given the
mass of the sun and the amount of time that Neptune takes to go around the
sun you can calculate the radius of neptune\'s orbit, and hence the distance
between neptune and Earth, which you then compare to the speed-of-light
distance to Neptune from Voyager measurements or radar. In practice, you use
the Voyager position to refine your Neptune orbital info. You also see effects
of planets gravity tugging on each other in a way that agrees with their
calculated distances to astonishing precision. (Once upon a time people thought
there was an anomaly in the positions of Neptune requiring a "Planet X", but
post-Voyager empherides pretty much remove the need for it.)

In addition, you can measure the speed of light between here and Jupiter 
(or Saturn or Neptune) by watching the relative timing of eclipses of 
the moons of those planets as the Earth moves closer and farther from them.
(Ten points to anyone who can tell me why this doesn\'t work for Uranus.)

Overall, evidence for the constancy of the speed of light in the solar system
is pretty good.

From what I remember, anything which makes a substantial difference at the
Oort cloud is going to be detectable far closer, since you have postulated
an inverse square law.  Square laws are a good idea, since they work well
as solutions to most of the kinds of equations that pop up in physics.  For
example, that they are the integral of an inverse distance potential and
stable for elliptical orbits is very convenient.

One nit you might want to address - relativistic distance contraction might
be exciting, given that you have something related directly to distance,
and your non constant light speed seems like it would be a way to determine
an absolute rest frame, which would have all sorts of other consequences.

If you can phrase it carefully, you might want to take it
sci.physics.relativity, and ask the "what if" questions.  As long as you
make clear that this is for a work of fiction, and are trying to see how
much of conventional physics can be salvaged with this one change, you
might get some good information.

We can measure differences on an extremely fine scale within our gravity
well, and get consistent results for both time dilation and gravitational
lensing out for quite a ways.  The changes you are proposing seem like they
should show up operationally rather sooner.

This does not meant that it cannot be done, only that your theory does not
match what we can see, and so you need to find a way to either cover for
why we do not see it, or when your universe would have.  for example, if in
your universe, there was no Hubble constant on close examination, and the
COBE radiation not as uniform as it is, you could get a very different
course for science in this century.

The wavelength of light emitted by atoms depends on the speed of light - 
for example, the spacing between hyperfine states depends on the 
"fine structure constant", alpha, which is e^2/h*c  (e being charge on
electron, h being Plank constant with a 2pi folded in, c being speed
of light.) The spacing between hyperfine lines in distant interstellar
or intergalactic clouds is the same as the spacing in the lab to a level
that implies alpha is constant to a part in 10^-4. (There\'s a recent paper
that implies 10^-5 variations, but I don\'t believe it for reasons too
complicated to go into here.) Note that this has nothing to do with the speed
the light has on the way too or from us - it\'s basically a measure of the
speed of light inside the atom at the time the photon was emitted. 
(There are enough other spectral lines that don\'t depend on alpha but do 
depend on e and h that we can be sure that no part of alpha is varying.)

If we want V=1 parsec/week = 169 * (normal speed of light) at a distance of
half a parsec, we need k\'=168/(100000)^2 for D in AU, or k=1*10^-9. At 
Voyager distance this would give you ~10^-5 change in speed of light - Voyager
messages would arrive a half-second earlier than predicted by inertial 
navigation, which should be detectable.
(Cute theory, though.)

It\'s \'cause Uranus has a huge axial tilt. IIRC 93 degrees, or there abouts.

Refering back to my original post, the jump drive involves aligning and targeting a
subatomic partical.  Gravity AND EM fields can easilly screw up that alignment.

I can help you out I have a G^3 spreadsheet that has converisons to MT and

No no no... at half a parsec I want V = 1 parsec/minuteActually, that\'s ship speed.
I think my preliminary study put ship speed at 1/5 light speed, which puts
lightspeed at 5 pc/min at a distance of 1/2 pc from any gravity well/star.
Remember that Jump 2 takes no more time than Jump 1 (or in my theory takes
insignificantly longer, i.e. 1 minute vs. 1 week).  This insignificant time at
"ludicrous" speed changes alot of things as it approaches zero. Like, you don\'t
break one light year from the star until 84 hours - insignificant time.

I don\'t know what Voyager distance is (although I thought we lost communication with
it, but what do I know?).  But I do recall it took on the order of minutes (to an
hour) to reach Voyager and then minutes to get back.  Although a half a second could
be measured, I don\'t think that it would be significant.I suppose the easiest thing
to do is amend my theory to say that lightspeed WITHIN a jump bubble is inversely
proportional to gravity.  Which everyone will say is fine in  my traveller universe,
but I don\'t run a game so that doesn\'t mean spit. In fact, I may as well not have a
relationship to lightspeed at all and just say that within a jump bubble you can
move FTL.  And I could just completely water down my theory and call it GM caveat...

One of the canonical features that is broken with my theory is FTL communications.
If lightspeed does increase, then you just need to point your communicator at the
reciever and it will get there in a week (or less).  Of course, said communicator
would be LUDICROUSLY huge and power consumptive... However if light speed increases
inside the jump bubble, this FTL comm trick doesn\'t work because it doesn\'t have the
jump bubble.  Although you could pulse a wave through j-space with a TL 21 Jump
Projector...

Quite probably... but I\'ve never seen what happens in print... I\'ve seen the 10 diameter

I don\'t know enough about Canon to say one way or the other.  All I have is rule books,
to which I\'m trying to model jump theory to the rules. However, since some planetary
bodies don\'t have EM fields, I\'d have to say no... err... yes... the first one... what

Highly recommended for characters interested in studying reincarnation 
theories, tho IMOTU, the party tried a desperation jump from less than a 
thousand klicks from the surface of a planet.  For reasons that escape me at 
the moment, I was feeling peculiarly generous at the moment, all that happened 
to the ship was this big *CLUNK*, and all the power went out.  They managed to 
land back on the planet *BARELY*.  (Ever had to make a dead-stick landing on a 
Size 3 world with a trace atmosphere in a semistreamlined ship?  Not 
recommended for people with chronic heart trouble...)  When the ship stopped 
moving, they had a chance to check it over, and found *NOTHING* where the 
powerplant and the jump capacitors were previously located.  All power busses 
were sheared off within a 4 meter globe centered on the Zochai crystals, the 
ends and misc structural edges were mirror-smooth.  (Idea stolen from an old 
Larry Niven short story.)

You\'re in for about a 5-8 hour drive to NY City, and probably 6-7 to
Rochester, depending heavily on traffic.  For weekends, add an hour or
more.  Not something most Yankees up here in Boston want to do ever day, but
coming from Texas, that ain\'t nothing.

To get a (better) grip on GURPS weapn stats avoid Gregs polynomial fit
method in 3G3 and instead buy GURPS Vehicles 2ed and look at their weapon
designm system (the book is by far the best design system in RPGs, well
worth the buy even if you\'ll never play GURPS).

I think that canon sources state that it\'s from gravity that the problems
with jumping close to planets etc occur. Wether it\'s from the strength of
gravity or the rate of change of gravity (tidal force) has not been
resolved in canon as far as I know.

I suggested earlier here that the problem was actually gravitational slope
(tidal force) which varies inversely proportional to range cubed. This has
the neat effect that given constant density the effect would be
proportional to diameter. You could (for planets) us the standard rules as
they\'re stated and multiply the 100diam measure with the cuberoot of
planetary density (earth density = 1.0) for detail (standard density
planets could just ignore this.
Another thing is that it eliminates more or less the 100diam limit of the
central star which I think is troublesome for the referee (do you always
check wether a planet is inside the stars 100 diam radius?)
Finally it make good background material:

"The ship was so deep within the gravity well of the planet that when the
engineer engaged the jumpdrive it generated such a tearing force it tore
the ship apart. I\'ve seen it with my own eyes and it\'s not a pretty sight.
Chhers buddy."

Marc didn\'t like it though (for no apparent reason) so I guess it\'s out (sigh).

Strangely, the "father of all notebook computers" the Tandy Model 100,
was *notorious* for being able to take being dropped a lot. I\'ve
dropped mine 6 feet onto concrete a few times. As long as you don\'t
crack the screen (hard because it\'s pretty well protected) it just
dings up the plastic a bit.

Of course it helps that the only moving parts are the keys and a couple
of switches. :-)

At some point in the not *too* distant future, we are going to run up
against the physical limits of silicon technology. At that point, you
won\'t see "better" computers coming out yearly. And the developers will
have to go back to improving performance by writing better code instead
of counting on their customers buying a new computer.

It took a bit of digging as they only mention the weight of the engine
*once* in the article, but I found it. Engine weight= 15 tons, thrust=
200,000 pounds. That gives a better than 6:1 thrust to weight ratio. Of
course, you do have the small problem of fuel... :-)

When I eventually get FF&S2, I\'ve got to try designing that fission
powered trader. :-)

They\'ll spend a lot of time coasting from orbit to 100 diameters and
back, but I think they\'ll be able to scrape by.

Well, I\'m *certain* that DynaSoar would have run into problems, as
would the MOL. But I still think that if the Air Force had been allowed
to continue their "space program", we\'d have gotten some use out of it.

There was also a story in Analog some years back where we never got
into the "space race" with the Soviets. So things like the X-15, and
other high altitude/high speed military *and* civilian experimental
craft just kept going faster and higher. And there were experimental
rockets as well. By the mid-80s, they were only just getting ready to
launch a moon flight, but there was *extensive* presence in earth
orbit. The moon flight(s) were several independent projects. Most folks
figured the National Geographic society would be first, but the British
Interplanetary Society was running a close second.

It\'s not acceleration that hurts you. It\'s *resistance* to
acceleration. For example, in a uniform gravity field, you could be
accelerated at a million gees and never even notice. That\'s because
gravity accelerates all the particles equally. So as long as jump drive
does something similar, you are ok. Besides, there\'s no proof that the
distance covered in jumpspace is anywhere *near* the distance in normal
space. :-)

Except that we\'ve got measurements covering a wide range of gravity.
And we can measure things like the difference in the rate time passes
at the top and bottom of a building (gravity affects the rate at which
time passes). 

The speed of light ties into a lot of things like the relationship
between wavelength and frequency. And that\'d make signals from (for
example) the Voyager and Pioneer probes really odd. They are *way* out
there. Practically in interstellar space.

Only if your DNA has a high lead content. Jupiter\'s radiation belts are

It\'s also a *long* ways to Jupiter. Mars orbit is about 1.6 AU.
Jupiter\'s is around 10 AU.

So? The sun\'s gravity is pretty darn weak here, a lot weaker at
Juptiter\'s orbit, and practically non-existent out where the Voyager
probes are.

Trouble is, there are planets with just about *zilch* EM field, and
ones with one that make Earth\'s look like nothing. 

What some of us came up with was that it may depend on the rate of
change of the gravity field (ie the "steepness" of the "gravity well").
This is essentially the same as tidal force, and is related to the
*cube* of the distance. It even makes a sort of sense that it\'d work
that way. Trying to "stress" space that\'s already pretty stressed would
tend to cause trouble, right?

We came up with some figures you could use to figure the danger radius
from various bodies based on mass. The less dense the body, the closer
you could be. But the "danger range" from a ship or jump tank was
pretty small.

The gravitational influence of *any* object extends to *infinity*. But
at the same time, it is getting progressively weaker. For example, at
the surface of the sun, it\'s gravity is about 26 times as strong as the
earths surface gravity. 

A=GM/R^2
	sun	Earth
GM=	13e19	4e14
R=	7e8    	6.4e6
A=	2.7e2	9.8
	27g	1g

Now at 1 AU, the sun\'s gravity is only 6e-3 (6/10,000th of a g).
At 35 AU (Neptune\'s orbit) it\'s only 5/10,000,000th of a g.

I\'d say that\'s pretty negligible. 

What counts isn\'t the *presence* of a "gravity well" but *how steep* it
is (ie how strong the field is at that distance).

Better re-read the stuff you saw. All the ones I\'ve seen have "Jumping
while within 10 diameters" and "Jumping while within 100 diameters".
Note that the first one covers everything from the center of the planet
out to 10 diameters, and the second covers from there to 100 diameters.

Here\'s what it has in The Traveller Book (closest to the computer :-).

Misjump:

Throw 13+ each time a ship jumps, with the following DMs:
Within 100 diameters of a world		 +5
Within  10 diameters of a world		+10
Using unrefined fuel			 +1
If naval ship				 -1
If scout ship				 -2

If result 16+, ship is destroyed
If result 13+, ship has misjumped

Note that according to the text accompanying the table, for a jump from
within 10 diameters, *both* distance modifiers apply. That is, it\'s
+15, not +10. Which, since it\'s a 2 die roll, means that you are
automatically destroyed if you engage the drive while within 10
diameters of the planet. :-)

2+15=17 oops.

A scout ship has 1 chance in 36 of making it.

I can\'t *find* Andover on my US map. But a trip from *anywhere* in
Massachutsetts to New York City would be about like a trip from Camas
to Seattle. A trip to Rochester would be like a trip to Spokane. You
see, Rochester is at the opposite end of the state, up by Lake Ontario.

The problem with very high gravity fields is that gravity is inversely
proportional to distance squared.  Which means that at high gravity
conditions, the front of your ship is accelerating faster than the back of
your ship. Which results in the front of your ship getting ripped off.  Same
thing applies to your body.  Very messy.

I\'d say Neptune doesn\'t think so.  i.e. its strong enough to keep a planet in
orbit.

Well, yes.  I just made the reference to being inversely proportional to
gravity.  Note also that all those pesky planets  don\'t make this a simple
calculation.  In the hyperbolic arc I\'m talking about, any gravity greater than
what\'s found out at Pluto (arbitrarilly) is all the way down on the flat spot of
the curve, thus appears constant.  My calculations assume parsecs of distance,
not AU\'s.  Compared to a black hole, Earth has virtually no gravity.  Does that
mean none?  no of course not.  But when you compare any finite number to zero,
its HUGE.

Well Sam, where is it!  Put it up on a website or something!

At least send me a copy.

Interesting, I\'m seeing (reading?) and feeling a slow but inexorable motion
towards teh MT system for many things.  I switched (back) to MT starship
combat recently and found it quite usable, though missing a couple of
things.

Maybe next week I\'ll look at the MT task/personal combat system.

408 miles according to Mapquest.  A bit much for a day trip.  Mostly
highway though, so probably 6-8 hours drive.

Closer to your new home is Excalibur Hobbies in Malden which has a very few
older items (I mostly cleaned them out over the years, sorry) and a
Compleat Strategist on Mass Ave in Boston which has at least the newer
stuff and some MT books last time I was there.

Also, New York City (or New Yahk as they\'ll say where you\'re going) is only
about 3.5 hours by car, or four by bus, which isn\'t too bad a ride.  Others
have described what NYC has to offer.

Crazy Egor showed up at the last GenCon I was at, and had a tremendous qty
of CT and MT products (I got all the seeker deckplans) but the prices left
somewhat to be desired.  Perhaps the better way to spend the money you
would need to goto Rochester would be to go to Milwaukee instead in August
(assuming, of course, GenCon happens this year).

Already picked it up. It\'s been reprinted (hitting local stores as of last
week) and contains all the errata currently posted for the 2nd edition
on the SJG website. I am very impressed with the info in it. If you
liked TNE\'s FF&S, you\'ll like this one. I have yet to design any
weapons with it, though.

IIRC, according to canon the problem is the gravity well, not 
electromagnetism. However, I don\'t remember exactly where in canon 
this is stated - it may have been an article on jumpspace in one of 
the _old_ JTASs.

Thank you for pointing that out.  I mentioned it previously in another
post.  The simple solution is to encapsulate everything in a jump
bubble.  i.e. Light behaves in  the prescribed measure inside a jump
bubble.

Of course, even without the jump bubble, sending a transmition a parsec
away would require stupid amounts of energy and focusing would be a
problem.

It\'s also a good source for integrating sensors into actual (combat)
gameplay as well as running vehicle chases, aircraft dogfights etc where
the vehicle stats actually play some part. It reminds me a bit about
Justice Inc and Danger International from Hero games who also had good
vehicle use rules.

I\'ll buy the new 2ed as I wasn\'t aware my first printing 2ed had any errors.

I\'ve just tried using the Spaceship design system in GURPS: Space to design
some merchant ships. I wanted to see if profitable merchants could be
designed (1000Cr/ton -> $1000/13.5 cy). However using the by-the-book
components, and assumping (GURPS) TL10, it seems rather impossible to make
a ship anything like standard traveller ships.
David Summer\'s conversion rules are just that, how to convert Traveller
ships to GURPS ships, rather than defining plug-ins for the GURPS system
for designing ships.
Has anyone played with this? Does anyone have plug-in components for GURPS:
Space that make traveller like ships?

Dear friends,
  This letter will be going out to my suppliers soon.  As friends and
associates I have worked with over the years, I wanted you to hear it from me
first.  
  The biggest thing to remember is I\'m not dead yet!!!!.  I\'m NOT selling "the
business\'; only making myself smaller to weather the forthcoming storms.  I
will be happy to answer questions and will actually have a spot of time to
myself this spring.
  Thank you for your support!


  Paul

*************************************

Dear friends,
	I have been in this industry for a very long time. It is my life, love and
livelihood. Most of you already know of the health problems I have suffered
with the last couple of years.  Although five ruptured disks is generally not
fatal, it does pose a major inconvenience. The inconsistency of my physical
condition at this time is a significant threat to this wonderful store I have
developed.  It has hindered me in the past but today carries a far greater
danger to disrupt and damage this business.
	In an effort to care for my family as well as concentrate on my personal
health for the short term I am officially announcing my semi-retirement from
the \'giant retail store\'.
	I have established a plan to take care of all my obligations, take care of my
employees and shrink the business into a smaller form that is more manageable
by my immediate family and that will not be as jeopardized by any long period
of disability.
	I am NOT selling Crazy Egor\'s; merely altering its structure.  By
intentionally making it smaller and concentrating in other directions I will
be able to take the time off this spring that is needed.  
	A new business, Millennium Games & Hobbies will be taking over the main
store.  They are purchasing the fixtures and will keep a very similar product
line.
	Crazy Egor will be moving it\'s base of operations within the next month to a
new facility in the village of Hilton New York.  We will still have a retail
operation but our primary emphasis will be our remanufacturing of older
product and our mail order business..
	All current Crazy Egor accounts will remain in place.  Orders will be lighter
for a while as we ramp up our already extensive web site.
	I deeply appreciate everyone\'s concern and friendship.  I know I can depend
on everyone\'s cooperation.  I feel we are making the right decision and the
best decision.  It will take care of everyone involved without undue side
effects.

Sincerely,

Paul W. Meyer 
Crazy Egor/\'himself\'
