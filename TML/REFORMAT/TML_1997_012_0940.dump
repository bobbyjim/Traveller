	Ummm...that\'s what I meant when I said the basics won\'t have changed much.
I\'d say that today\'s cars _are_ TL 9 because they incorporate today\'s
technology and production methods, and wouldn\'t be too diffcult for 1965
man to drive. And if you look in say QSDS, ship components are smaller,
better, more efficient, but they are still nevertheless a different TL. For
example, a Basic Sensor System; a TL 10 system incorporates much the same
technology as a TL 11 system, as, say, cars do, but it still has better
qualities that make it a TL 11 system.

	Today\'s car over its 1965 counterpart or even 1981 counterpart would be a
better TL. Consider, better road-holding, more efficient auto-transmission,
better fuel consumption, better safety measures, airbags, electronic
ignition, power steering (maybe earlier, but more common now), to name but
a few things. These increases coupled with finding them in more and more
cars would make the average new car TL 9 and not 7 or 8.

	See ya...

Why not simply combat experience? Mr Einstein might have been a bright chap
but he was probably not all that quick headed in a serious gunfight. I use
DEX + modifiers for aim, morale etc.

At one time I toyed with the idea that combat experience is the flipside of
karisma. The more karismatic/empathic you are (better at relating to others
etc) the worse off you are in a fight. This would work nicely as a
Travellers version of CoC sanity/Cyberpunk psuchosis: The more combat you
endure the harder you\'ll have relating to other humans. Finally you\'ll need
psychiatric care.
(I didn\'t implement it though due in a large part to my players objections ;)

Yes, but the Vilani are not the only players on the arena. There are scores

That\'s only partly true. In the rimwards sectors there are plenty of
Solomani planets.

The 3rd Imperium is only part of the point. I\'m talking about technological
progress during the Long Night. If technological progress is \'merely\' a
matter of will, rather than ability, then by the law of averages _some_
planets would have raced ahead. The Vilani mindset may explain why _some_
planets didn\'t want to advance, but it can\'t explain why every planet from
the Rim to the Vargr Extents felt the same way, because they wouldn\'t feel
the same way.

Besides, you\'re overlooking one crucial factor in the Vilani conservatism:
That during the Ziru Sirka they could afford not to advance, because they
were the biggest and baddest people around. But technology provides an 
edge; and if you\'re competing against other people who are about the same
strength as yourself, you\'re going to try to get an edge. The Long Night
provided a perfect environtment for technological development what with
Pocket Empires and Reavers and Aslans (Oh my! :-). Of course, the Long Night 
also provided a lot of impediments to technological development. It\'s no 
surprise that most planets regressed. But IF technological advancement is as 
easy as Earth today seems to indicate, then it is implausible that _some_ 
planets wouldn\'t have beaten the odds.
 
>You might note the interesting throwaway lines about patent law in

Imperial, or even Sylean, patent law didn\'t apply on 95% of the planets in
Charted space during the Long Night.

And, incidentally, I don\'t agree that the 3rd Imperium would be nearly as
conservative as the Siru Zirka was. The whole tenor of Milieu 0 speaks of
an altogether more agressive mindset.

I still think that if technological progress above TL 9 was as easy as
progress from 4-9 was on Earth, then the Traveller history won\'t work.
And if some planets around Sylea had TL 14 in Year 0, then Sylea would have
had TL 14 in Year 50 or 100.

So, in the Traveller universe technological progress is NOT an easy thing, 
at least not when you get above TL 8-9. (I would also reccomend that the 
Terran TL 4 to 9 spurt be regarded as a freak occurrence, but that isn\'t 
strictly necessary).

   Sorry I can\'t answer your first question; I don\'t have a copy of PE

   The rules for taking over planets are in the chapter titled
   "Expanding the Empire", located towards the end of the book. The book
   has several meta-tasks detailed for inducing (by politics, religion,
   economics, or corruption) worlds to sign up with you.  Military
   take-over is another possibility, detailed exhaustively in the
   following chapter, "War".  Right now my players are using election
   rigging and religious conversion (at cross purposes) to try to "take
   over" one particular world.  My game, howver, is very role-playing
   oriented, being essentially a traditional Trav campaign gone to very
   high levels.

Can\'t say I like this. First of all, it shares the T4 task system problem
of the attributes totally dominating the entire score. Even a trained
military commander will get about 3 times as many points from attributes as
from his training. This is too much, IMHO. Also, why should one
individual\'s attributes determine the responses of an entire team? It
doesn\'t matter how fast the CO reacts if the fire team is slow off the
mark. Dex and End are already counted in combat through the hit task roll
and the Endurance pool. I also dislike the vague "military background"
rules; it\'s too vulnerable to abuse.

Not to disagree with you but I think you\'re putting too much weight on
the characteristic (the same mistake you corrected with KB 2.0).

I have been toying with an Idea of my own which is a modification of the
base rules, of 1D6 + DM, but I calculate the DM differently:-

I use SQRT(DEX+SKILL MODS) as the DM, where Skill Mods is equal to the
sum of the characters following skills.

Highest Weapon Skill
Highest Melee Skill
Tatics
Leadership
Recon

and since the best oportunity to get these skills is in the military
they should have the higher initiative\'s.

If you use the unmodified DEX to calculate the DM then there is no need
to perform square roots in the middle of the play session, but this
therefore does not incorporate the effects of wounds. To do so, I
imposed a -ve DM equal to the high damage a characteristic has received
(Eg 777 reduced to 534 would result in a -4 DM).

I also think a +DM could be provided if the character is using advanced
tatical assistance and sensors (e.g. wearing battle dress), but I
haven\'t had chance to think about it too clearly yet. 

What do you think.

Chris.

The system is unclear, and the Traveller feel is regrettably dependent on
this.  See below for three asides on various elements, but here is the
answer I use for the need for so damn much fuel.

What is a jump drive?

Jump drives need a huge heap of energy, a bunch of mass to form a very
small, unstable universe with, and a hull grid that shapes the field that
turns that heap o\' stuff into a bubble of our space inside jump space.  The
energy could come from accumulators without a problem, and the hull grid
might get smaller as the tech level goes up, but the need for mass stays
the same until a way is discovered to use pre-existing bubble of our space
inside jump space.

How does jump space work?

The drive makes a small universe out of the ship itself and the heaps and
heaps of LHyd that you pump out as you enter jump space.  Jump space does
not like little bubbles of our space, and so starts to convert it to the
native stuff of jumpspace.  When that happens, the ship is destroyed, so
you want to leave jumpspace before it has eaten the little universe you are
in.

Why is there no controlled jump 7?

Each level of jump is an energy level of jump space.  In my universe, they
get progressively harder to do right, as you have to very precisely figure
out the size of the pocket universe you need, then you have to build it
just right.  While imperials think there can\'t be a controlled jump 7, I
feel that there is, it is just never really important.  At the tech level
where you might get jump 7, you discover how to do lower jumps without the
liquid fuel by using a metastable universe.  It does not decay slowly -
instead, it is entirely stable for a while, then vanishes almost instantly.

Shortly thereafter, you discover that you can use stable pocket universes
which exist in jumpspace to move without needing a big, complicated jump
drive at all.

A bit higher on the tech scale, you can pinch off bits of real space into
stable jump space universes, with the godlike power to just create a stable
pocket universe from whole cloth coming even later still.

So, the short answer is that almost all of that LHyd is just pumped out
into jumpspace.  You can either have it go into the drive, or to the hull
grid, which is my usual choice.

Aside 1: why use a TL12 J1 drive?

TL12 drives are smaller than TL9 drives, take less power, and are less
noticeable to a sensor scan.  While they still take 10% of the volume of
the ship in fuel, I have upped the size of the JD so that it is also taking
a significant size at TL9, dropping to overly large at 12, and pretty darn
small at TL15.  I am still fretting over TL16+.

Aside 2 - Why is a jump one week?

The best analogy is: you have a cannon that always gives a certain amount
of vertical oomph.  By adjusting the angle, you are telling the canon to
add more horizontal oomph as well, so you can adjust where you come out
fairly precisely.  Unfortunately, until you figure out how to use less
Y-axis powder, every shot takes the same amount of time to fall to earth.
Now imagine that there are barriers at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 thousand feet
that each require a different kind of projectile to breach, and you have my
model of jumpspace.

If you understand it well, then you can get virtually any interval, but
jump space is difficult.  Theoretical understanding is, in my world, a
>TL18 thing.  By the time you get the ability to make a three day jump, you
have discovered the pocket universe technology, and can make an
interstellar teleporter that takes not time at all.

Understanding of how to build a jump drive and use it, though, comes as
early as TL9.

I have wanted to post this before... but, here goes... if "SO" much energy
is required why cant it be stored in some sort of accumulator and

the area available for the rest of the ship for other aspects...

It is worth checking if the book is offered in your native language; it
has been translated into many European languages, as well as Japanese,

  Chapter 1 deals with the question of necessity as the mother of

I don\'t believe that there are any other instances of the phenomena in Deep
Space Nine, Sorry, Traveller. ;-)

However, there have been adventures in Challenge when other ships were
encountered in jump, and there certainly are adventures with portals to
other universes... What you\'ve got is a long portal back to the same
universe. ;-)

The claim is that the energy densities required are much, much larger than
can be stored in any reasonable accumulator.  DGP stated explicitly in
Starship Operators Manual that the jump drive has, as an integral
component, an very large accumulator that craps out after an hour or two,
so you do generate the energy over a reasonable time of hours.

(The size of the accumulator array can be determined from some old High
Guard rules that let you use the jump drive capacitors to store incoming
weapons fire.)

I decided that the numbers still did not work out - if you are actually
fusing 10% of the volume of your ship in anything less than years, it is
going to look like a small star for a while.  The only answer I could come
up with was that the power part of the jump for a 1400M^3 merchant might
use at most a few cubic meters of fuel for a jump 1.  The other 138 m^3 of
liquid hydrogen used is just sprayed out ports into jump space.  I have not
completely decided whether this should be a continuous process, or one that
is done within a few minutes/hours of jump.

Yes, I agree.  See my other post.  I was just brainstorming out loud,

Just striking out all around with you, aren\'t I?  That\'s OK, though.  
That\'s why I put the idea out there.

It\'s a poor execution of a good idea.  Check out my simpler solution 
in my other post and let me know what you think.

Here\'s another idea that one of my players came up with that has some 
merit.  Remember, though, that we are just kicking around ideas here.

What if the initiative throw was skill dependent?  If you were 
attempting a hand to hand attack, you use your Brawling skill as a 
DM.  If you were attempting a direct fire shot, you use your weapon 
skill as a DM.

In this instance, we are not using blanket DMs for everything the 
character does.  A character who is highly skilled with a rifle can 
klick off rounds right after the other, while he may not be so good 
at punching another guy in the face.

In this way, skill not only helps the character be more accurate 
(with the to hit throw) but also improves his speed (initiative 
throw).

When just throwing around ideas, that one seems to have some merit.

Actually, I am beginning to agree with you.  I posted this to my 
players as well to get their feedback, and they said the same thing.

I was just trying to integrate two Traveller rules that probably 
shouldn\'t be integrated.  As I said in the first post, this is not a 
finished rule--just some brainstorming out loud.

A red flag has gone up that the initiative roll is getting two 
complicated.  One of my players pointed  out that we may be doubleing 
the time it takes to do a combat round because of this.

Because of this, I have backed off the base initiative idea.  I\'m 
still pondering putting in the extra DMs though.

Something like this...

Initiative roll = 1 D6 for higher dice  (official rule)

DMs  + Leadership   (official rule)
         + Tactics (if used from tactics pool--official rule)
         +1 or +2 for military background (my rule--depending on 
                        type)
	+1 pseudo-military background (my rule)

What do you think of that?

I think the idea is along the lines of what I\'ve been thinking, 
except the sqrt seems awkward.  I like to keep the math simple, yet 
still make sense--like in KBv2.0 and in T4.

I would prefer a more simple solution.  I think just adding in the 
two additional DMs as I did above might be a better way to handle the 
situation in a cleaner, simpler, more T4 like way.

Because, according to canon, this is exactly what happens, but the
accumulators (zuchai crystal capacitor banks) do not hold energy stably
for very long. At high TL\'s you can get by with charging the jumpdrive
using other energy means, but you STILL need the Hydrogen to form the
\'Jump Bubble\' around your ship. To get away with that requires even higher
TL\'s (Grandfather level, here, folks)

The amount of \'jump fuel\' required to generate the energy is only a tiny
fraction of what is expended, so you\'re not going to gain much free space 
in your hull.

Mostly this is canon\'s fault for never really specifying how jump drives
work, other than saying that they use 10% of the ships volume/jump in LHyd
\'fuel\'; all the rest of the handwaving has been to justify that number.

You\'ve got a really nifty explaination for why ships require so much
liquid hydrogen as "Jump Fuel". I like it! I do have some minor quibbles
with your explanation, though, and I\'d like to posit a slightly revised
version of your excellent theory.

Quibble #1: What is it about our space that jumpspace doesn\'t like?
Ship\'s make a jump in outer space which is nearly vacuum, why should
jumpspace react violently with it?

Quibble #2: Why does the volume of hydrogen increase for higher
jumpspace levels? 10% of hull volume for jump-1, 20% for jump-2, etc.

This minor quibbles can be solved (I think :-) by a slight change in the
focus of your explanation.

The lanthanum grid creates an exotic particle field (Jumpspace Bubble
Boundry or JBB) which allows a starship and all else within the bubble
to enter jumpspace. At the same time, hydrogen is pumped out at
strategic intervals around the ship to "inflate" the bubble.

Each jumpspace level has a certain particle density which creates
pressure in much the same manner as an atmosphere does. A jumpspace
bubble therefore requires some kind of gas to "inflate" it to the point
where the outside pressure on the bubble is equivalent to the inside
pressure of the hydrogen gas.

If you were to form a jumpspace bubble without inflating it with
hydrogen, when you enter jumpspace the pressure of jumpspace would
instantly collapse upon the ship (since the pressure inside the bubble
is negligible), react with the heavier elements comprising the ship, and
boom.

Too much hydrogen pressure on the inside, and you increase the volume of
the jumpspace bubble, therefore lowering the density of exotic particles
in the JBB to the point where the ship misjumps.

Why Hydrogen?

Heavier elements react violently with jumpspace. Hydrogen, and some
isotopes of Helium (just throwing that in for fun...) seem to be
relatively inert. This is why it is imperative that the hydrogen be free
from impurities. Small impurities in the bubble may cause jumpspace
incursion and misjumps.

This is another very good reason to *not* jump within an atmosphere, of
a mainworld or a gas giant.

Why no Jump-7?

Increasing levels of jumpspace have increasing jumpspace pressures.
Entering Jump-1 requires 10% of the ship\'s volume of hydrogen to create
a stable bubble.  Jump-6 requires 60% of the ship\'s volume of hydrogen
to create a stable bubble. At Jump-7, the volume of hydrogen required
increases dramatically, and is actually greater than that of the ship!

So far, top secret naval experiments with drop tanks, pre-created
hydrogen "atmospheres" and other methods of externally "inflating" the
bubble have proved disasterous. The exact volume required is not yet
known, and it has been suspected that the Jumpspace Bubble Boundry would
become unstable before the required hydrogen pressure was reached.

One crazy and ultra-top secret experiment involved a modified Xboat with
an experimental J-7 drive which attempted to jump within the cargo bay
of an Xboat Tender filled with hydrogen under high pressure...

Although the idea of jumpspace slowly intruding upon the jumpspace
bubble, chewing through it like some flesh-eating disease, has some
appeal, it\'s perhaps a bit too melodramatic, imho.

You also have to deal with loss of mass in our universe, and whatever
nastyness that may entail.

That\'s why I prefer of thinking of the hydrogen bubble as an
"equilibrium" situation.

As I said, the loss of the LHyd to jumpspace opens a can of worms that
unsettles me. Why not have the ship jump in-system with the hydrogen
bubble still intact? This would cause some neat role-playing
opportunities.

"Sir, picking up increased hydrogen density at 45 mark 30, 12 light-sex
distance..."

"That might be the Azhanti, she might have just arrived. Red Alert! I
want a detailed analysis of the shape of that cloud before it disperses!
We may be able to determine the heading of the Azhanti by following her
wake... she\'s probably still dragging hydrogen..."

By the way, any physics buffs care to speculate how long a hydrogen
shell would hang around after returning to normal space? I imagine it
would depend on whether any G\'s were expended for maneuver or evasion.
Otherwise, the shell would likely have the same vector as the ship.

Of course, then there\'s the effects of the solar wind, planetary
magnetospheres...

How much time would a ship have to detect a hydrogen cloud?
How hard would it be for sensors to detect it?
Would a ship jumping in-system light up momentarily, like a comet?
Could one follow the "tail"?

	There\'s a lot of energy in hydrogen when you fuse it. Throw in the magical
thruster drive, which breaks physical laws, and there\'s no reason you can\'t
move around as long as you have power.

	Jump drives require both ENERGY to "rip" the hole between our space and
jump space, as well as MATTER to stabilize the "bubble" of normal space
around the ship while you\'re in jump space. Jump drives already include
accumulators to store the energy prior to opening the jump rift, but you
have to have the "fuel" to provide the matter necessary to keep the walls
of the bubble away from your ship.

Well... IMHO this is inaccurate. I spent a lot of years living and
working with U.S. Army Special Forces troops; lots of training, lot of
combat experience, tons of training, etc. One guy I knew walked into a
dark room from bright sunlight, caught a dart thrown at him in jest and
snapped it across the room and hit the dart board... all in one smooth
motion, all without warning, all in less time than it takes to say
\'boo!\'. And S.F. guys are usually the nicest, most polite people you
will ever meet. My wife (a non-military type) says they were the most
gentlemanly group she ever met. IMHO a skilled professional soldier will
be very self assured and, thus, very empathic.

someone. Sorry I can\'t remember the original poster) about the g-forces
jtroops could withstand on reentry and how this would affect approach
vectors for drop ships. I recently dug out an article from _The
Foundation Point_ VolI, Issue 1, by Eric Lee where he lists data from
_The Bioastronautics Book_ from Nasa that used various human and animal
test data on g-stress as well as data gathered from high-speed accidents
where g-force was extrapolated. The first table I will reproduce is for
sustained acceleration (more than 30 seconds, but LESS THAN 15 minutes!)

Tolerance for subjects
Time		Accel couch<Gs>		G-Tank<Gs>
(in min)		
..5			23		  28
1			17		  22
2			12		  17
3			8		  14
4			7		  12
5			6		  9
6			5		  8
7			4		  7
8			4		  6
9+			3		  6

at longer periods extreme pain/fatigue resulted. At higher Gs pain,
difficulty breathing, etc. were reported. Above 6 Gs breathing was
difficult and NO arm/leg movement was possible above 7Gs

The second chart is for short period (<6 seconds) acceleration

Accel time 	Safe	Moderate injury		Severe/lethal injury
(in seconds)	 <Gs>	     <Gs>			<Gs>
..005		 <45	     45-160			>160

2		 <13	     13-23			>23
5		 <12	     12-26			>26

Considering that there is an estimated 20% variance between subjects and
that the Jtroops will not be in acceleration couches, I think it is safe
to assume that they could withstand a (battledress/jump capsule
assisted) 10G acceleration for 5 seconds. (interesting aside... the high
G tolerance at the shorter durations is believed to be because the human
body is, effectively, a rigid object in a short duration exposure. But,
accident data seems to indicate that no human could surviveexposure to
250 Gs for any duration. Not that this should surprise anyone....)

I think one of the important points of Scott\'s post is that it *dosen\'t*
take "so much" energy to jump. The majority of the jump "fuel" is actually
displacement mass needed to create a pocket universe in J-space. You can
use accumulators or a power plant to operate the drive machinery, pumps,
and so on, but you must have displacement mass to jump.

This also explains why jump drives aren\'t used as super-power-plants, why
ships don\'t get melted to slag by waste heat, and how the Annic Nova was
able to jump merely with solar energy; jump drives just don\'t produce that
much power. We can assume the Annic Nova also had one of those "metastable
pocket universes" so it didn\'t need displacement mass. In my campaign such
metastable jump bubbles are occasionally encountered and are extremely
valuable.

If you inject the displacement mass into the pocket universe from a single
point, the hydrogen will have a high probability of fusing and we can use
some of the energy leakage to power the jump machinery, so this explains
where jump drives get their power too.

Good post, Scott. I like it.

This is good in theory but probably too complicated for ease of use.

IIRC in MT the official rule was that a charecters skill level was that
the task increased in difficulty by 1 level for each TL the equiptment
being used was in advance of that the charecter was familiar with (the
homeplanet TL for charecters who had never left their homeworld or the
prevailing high TL for travellers).  Thus if Joe Bob Gustafson was from
a TL 9 world and had never left his home planet (say he had served as a
cop or bureaucrat) it would be 4 difficulty levels harder for him to use
a TL 13 computer.

When using equiptment from a lower TL the task was 1 difficulty level
harder for each tech _code_ it was below the TL he was familiar with.

Tech Code Table (MT Players manual pg 13)

TL 0 - 3	Pre Industrial
TL 4 - 5	Industrial
TL 6 - 8	Pre Stellar
TL 9 - A	Early Stellar
TL B - D	Average Stellar
TL E - G	High Stellar
TL H +		Extreme Stellar

So if Joe Bob Gustafson were to try to use a TL 8 computer it would be 1
difficulty level harder.

The MT rules did provide for this.

If you want to make the TL penalties both less harsh and more realistic
(in a cinematic fashion) you might consider the following scheme.

For every 1 Tl higher or tech code lower the equipment being used is
decrease the charecters skill level by 1.  If the effective skill level
drops below 0 treat the task attempt as unskilled (because it is).

<hand waving ON>
Hydrogen is used as jump-displacement mass for a reason: You want the
particles that make up the bubble to contain as little uncharged mass as
possible and hydrogen is protons only. Neutrons degrade the effect quite a
bit and therefore some jumpdrive users filter out any deuterium, helium
whatever to improve stability of the jumpbubble (can you say refined fuel
anybody). The earliest j-drives (TL-9) where REQUIRED to use hydrogen only
and also couldn\'t create a nonspherical jumpfield thus requiring the ships
to be spherical or use an awful lot more jumpfuel.
<hand waving OFF>

This is not that well thought out I admit but I think it sounds a bit more
physics like than \'reacts violently to jumpspace\'.

The thing I disliked most about PE (so far, I got it yesterday) is the
apparent lack of TL impact on society. A high TL world according to PE is
like a low TL one but better. The only real TL advantage that plays a role
is jumpdrive but surprisingly enough the transportation costs does not seem
to go down with TL and the disadvantages of atmos etc doesn\'t alter with TL
either.
As have been seen from "history" again and again is that higher TL is not
only a quantitatative advance but a qualitative one as well. Terrans got
their mesonguns and whipped the Vilanis, when we get high powered lasers
we\'ll stop using high flying aircraft in warfare, out of womb child
carriage will improve population growth enormously etc.

Are there anybody interested in a PE rules discussion along the lines of
the gearhead one? Do some reality checking, handwaving etc (whats the PE
equivalent of a frac c rock?). I think PE despite some flaws (mostly in
presentation) is one of the most important things to come out for Traveller
ever.
I hereby dub such a thread as \'PE vs reality(tm)\'

    'body' => 'I\'m one of those players who likes to know as much as possible about their
character before the game starts. I want to know everything about their
homeworld, the culture they were born into, what happened to them when they
were young, what kind of family they had... anything that will help make
the character live and breath as a unique and interesting individual.

Like most players, I like to let my creativity fly, sparking ideas from my
UPP stats, homeworld skills and UWP, background skills, career history, and
so on. A detailed homeworld write-up can be a source of lots of character
development ideas, and if it isn\'t a world drawn from the game setting,
I\'ll work with the referee to quickly sketch out the world\'s physical
environment and cultural profile. Culture determines many aspects of the
character\'s family - big or small? dominated by one or the other sex?
healthy or dysfunctional? Eventually a general character history suggests
itself.

Still, there\'s a lot about the character I don\'t know. For more
information, I\'ll need a detailed history of virtually everything they\'ve
ever experienced. Well, why not? Why not come up with a system for sparking
ideas for detailing major formative experiences and turning points in the
PC\'s life?

The Life Events generation system is designed to serve this need. Don\'t
expect it to do all the work for you: it\'s only intended to give your
imagination a jolt in the right direction. It provides vague general
suggestions which you\'re expected to flesh out in detail.


The System

The Life Events system consists of twelve short tables: six "Personal
Development" tables and six "Transformative Events" tables. These labels
are highly arbitrary: they could just as easily be called Group One and
Group Two. Similarly, the tables themselves have vague names, some of them
redundant or meaninglessly broad: Single Life, Love Life, Relationships,
Career, Finances, Health, Change, Discover, Law & Crime, Turning Points,
Social Conflict, and Major Event. Below the twelve events tables, there are
few extra tables - I\'ll describe them in a moment.

Depending on how much detail you\'re looking for, or how much time you want
to spend on the process, you can roll up a separate event for each year of
the character\'s life, or for each two year period, or for each five year
period. It\'s up to you. But one event per year is usually more than enough
for an eventful life history.

You can skip the PC\'s first twelve years and roll from that age onward (the
system isn\'t specifically designed to generate childhood life events). Or
you can start with the PC\'s year of birth, but in this case you should
assume that most of the results apply not to the character but to their
parents or guardians: their experiences, obviously, can have a major
influence on the development of their children. Thus, the character\'s
parents might divorce, or the family might move to a new home (or planet,
for that matter), or their financial fortunes might change radically.

When the character is over the age of twelve, continue to use this rule of
thumb: if the result of a roll doesn\'t make sense for the character,
interpret it as the experience of someone close to the character, such as a
parent, sibling, lover, friend, whatever. For instance, if a roll
determines that your PC "splits up or gets a divorce," but they aren\'t
currently involved in a relationship, just assume that the PC\'s parents
have split up, or their best friend is going through a divorce.

The Events Tables refer to the character as "you". The word "You" is
assumed to proceed the Event description, as in: [You] "are involved in a
lawsuit".

The Events listed are supposed to be influential, pivotal, or in some way
character-forming. Obviously the PC will have a lot of inconsequential
experiences and relationships, but those aren\'t worth generating. Don\'t
just jot down the result as listed, such as "try a new sport"; instead,
work out the specifics of the event, and its consequences for the
character, rolling results randomly if necessary: "Age 19: Ensign Phred
takes a course in Free Fall Jujitsu, but quickly washes out, as the
instructor delights in humiliating late starters."

Similarly, if the tables say the PC falls in love, work out the
consequences. In love with whom? Roll up the lover\'s UPP; do the couple
have radically different Social Standings? Are they badly mismatched in
Intelligence or Education? Is the love returned, or unrequited? Again,
determine the outcomes with die rolls if you want, or make it all up. You
can assume the relationship lasts a long time, at least until another roll
determines that\'s it\'s Over. If it\'s just an "affair," you might give it a
randomly-determined time limit.

Remember to take into consideration the world you\'re on at the time of the
event - your homeworld, or a planet you\'re stationed on, or a ship for that
matter. Make use of the local culture, geography, Tech Level, Law Level,
whatever is appropriate. Sometimes, to determine the outcome of an event,
the UWP stats can be used as target numbers for rolls. For instance, if you
are "diagnosed with a serious disease or disorder", roll the world\'s Tech
Level or less on 3D to recover fully (use more dice or less, depending on
the lethality of the disease). A failure might imply that someone close to
the PC died of the disease. Similarly, use your UPP stats for target
numbers. If you are "involved in a lawsuit", you might roll your Social
Standing or less on 2D to win a favourable ruling. If you "try a new drug",
try rolling your Endurance or higher on 2D to avoid addiction. And so on.

Don\'t be a slave to the dice. It\'s your PC after all - you can make
decisions at any time. If the PC settles down with a partner, it might make
perfect sense that they have children, whether or not this comes up as an
Event roll; after all, pregnancies can be planned or unexpected. However,
since Traveller is about Travellers, it\'s generally a good idea to assume
that the PC will begin the game single, or at least not living with a
partner - unless you and your referee think that a marriage can be worked
into the game.

The referee should be allowed to check the final character history for
consistency with the setting (especially some of the large scale events
such as wars and disasters). But the other players don\'t necessarily have
to know any of it. You might have two versions - one the life story you
tell to your shipmates; the other listing experiences even your lovers
don\'t know about....

   4  are caught up in violent civil disorder, rioting, or protests
   5  experience a kidnapping, hostage crisis, or terror attack
   6  are caught up in political upheaval or revolution


If you need to determine the identity of another person related in some way
to your PC, you can roll on the \'Others\' table below. For instance, if you
roll an event that isn\'t appropriate for your character, you might decide
that it applies to a person determined by a roll on this table. 

Others
   1  A relative, or one of your children, if any
   2  One of your siblings
   3  One of your parents/guardians
   4  Your lover, spouse, partner, or close friend
   5  A friend, mentor, or hero
   6  A rival, enemy, ex-spouse, or ex-lover

If you\'re a real fanatic, you might roll up some of the more important
people in your character\'s life, and perhaps even roll up their life
histories (though you might want to only roll one event per three years,
say). This can add whole new dimensions to your PC, discovering how the
lives of lovers, enemies, siblings, or children intertwine with your
character\'s life.

Bear in mind that a good referee will find a lot of inspiration in all of
this. Expect people from your past to unexpectedly pop up in the middle of
an adventure. That high school rival who ruined your first romance; that
ex-wife you thought you\'d gotten away from forever; that twin brother who\'s
supposed to be long-lost... But of course this is one of the best reasons
for going to all the trouble. It brings the game to life and adds to the
fun.

Feel free to adapt and modify the system to your liking, or adapt it to
your game as necessary. Heretics who like icosahedrals or ten-sided dice
might want to convert it into a single D100 system (not a bad idea, really
- - even if it just ain\'t Traveller!)....

Comments and suggestions are most welcome.

Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence, Education, and Social Standing.

	2. Name. Decide on this character\'s name. (this step may be delayed until
the end of the sequence).
	3. Birthworld. Determine the character\'s birthworld.
		A. On TL Group Table, roll 1D for TL Group. Note Starport Range (in
parentheses).
		B. On World Determination Table, roll 2D for world trade classifications
using the correct column for TL Group.
		C. On Starport Table, roll 1D for the specific starport type.
	4. Homeworld. If player decides that homeworld is not the same as
birthworld, determine homeworld.
		A. On TL Group Table, roll 1D for TL Group. Note Starport Range (in
parentheses).
		B. On World Determination Table, roll 2D for world trade classifications
using the correct column for TL Group.
		C. On Starport Table, roll 1D for the specific starport type.

classification of the homeworld, on World Skills Table 1 or World Skills
Table 2, roll 1D to determine the specific skill received.
	6. Education. Determine Educational Background.
		A. Initial Schooling. Scan the Available Schools Table to determine which
prerequisites for education are met (University, Military, Naval, Merchant
Academy or Educational Certificate,). If additional education is to be
pursued, and prerequisites are met, consult the specific Educational
Institution and 
			1. Roll for Admission. If this roll is failed, character may immediately
attempt admission at any other schools for which the prerequisites are met. 
			2. Roll for Perseverance. If this roll is failed, the character spends one
half-die in years (1-3 years) in attendance (including for Education
Certificate) and receives one skill for each year spent, but does not receive
the school\'s education increase or degree. Re-admission is not possible.
			3. Attendees at University or Merchant Academy may also attempt to join

				a) If Army, Navy, or Marines and Injury roll is 10, 11, or 12, consult
the Military Heroism Awards Table.
				b) In any service, an Injury reduces one characteristic; consult the
Injury Table.
			3. Roll for Commission (if possible in the career).

on (each table may be different) and rolls 1D until all currently allowed
skills are taken.
			7. If player decides to continue and that is possible, go to step 2.
	8. Muster Out. Roll on the Muster Out Cash or the Muster Out Benefits
Tables, taking one benefit for each term served, and one benefit if the
character held a commission. If Muster Out is required due to Injury, the
total number of benefit rolls allowed is doubled.

Reacting in combat isn\'t simply a test of how quickly you can move, but of
how quickly you can effectively move.  Dim soldiers die because they can\'t
process the fact that their under fire until they\'ve been hit.. Smarter
troops recognize the danger and react faster.

Personally, I\'d use the average of DEX and INT, and reduce Initiative by 1
for each point of damage taken to DEX.. this solves some of the Hard to
Kill problem, since a wounded PC will be looking for a way out of the
fight, since he\'s going to be slower and slower as the wounds pile up.  +1
for each level of tactics also makes sense.

	Are there any specific rules for determining how long one can keep the
jump capacitors charged before the energy contained within them begins to
discharge? How about a difficult enginering task roll to keep the energy
stable longer, so that say a successful task roll keeps the energy in place
for one hour plus D6 times ten minutes (i.e. 70 to 120 mins)?

	I think I posted something like this before. A failure could have the
following varying results (all effects cumulative);

	Small failure = loss of all jump energy

	Then at incresing levels of failure...

		Engineering crew injured by uncontrolled discharge
		Jump drive badly damaged
		Zuchai crystals destroyed
		All engineering crew killed
		Engineering deck completely trashed
		Loss of all ship\'s powered systems
		Consoles all over ship explode injuring remaining crew

	...and last but not least...

	Catastrophic failure = ship destroyed

	Or whatever. Or is it too over the top?

	See ya...

<HANDWAVE>

Jump drives do not need mass for the universe, they need volume. Hydrogen is
quites simply the lightest thing you can carry to generate a volume at a given
temperature (in the range of about 10 Kelvin and up). The reason more fuel is
needed for higher jumps is that the degenerate space pressure (!?!) increases
linearly with distance.

This allows a couple of interesting extrapolations:

1. A ship carrying LHyd can perform a maximum of about jump-9 unless the relation
becomes nonlinear at high values.

2. Other means of storing matter at higher densities could in theory increase the
amount of hydrogen created per unit fuel volume. For example, 13.5 m3 (1 disp.
ton) of water contains about 1.5 tons of hydrogen.

3. Whatever material you use has to enable VERY FAST extraction of hydrogen from
other materials. Otherwise it\'s like having lots of holes in your boat that are only
filled when you put it in water...

</HANDWAVE>

Just a thought, folks...

Actually how you react in combat has to do with how frightened you get
(combat experience) and what kind of actions you think are valid (combat
experience). Neither DEX nor especially INT are all that important, but as
combat experience is such a ill defined cpncept that is easily abused I
choose between INT or DEX and decided on DEX for that express reason that
high INT guys in movies, books etc tend NOT to react well in combat (a bit
cliche=B4 I admit).

IMHO, your mileage may vary etc.

When designing such a ship a good idea might be to have a few low berths to
get continuity by waking these "leaders" up from time to time and telling
people of the old time and the importance of the mission. The oppression
might come from 2nd plus generation people wanting to use the lowpassage
units for themselves and the guys in control not wanting this to happen.
The freezeers might be a handy plot device to use for your PC when you (the
ref) thinks you\'ve exhausted the possibilities with the generation ship and
wants to play the colonization of the target system.

Then of course the comm link with Earth gets mysteriously silent and the
players have to find out why really they launched this ship (alien
invasion, environmental collapse, nuclear war, astrophysical problems,
curiosity etc).
It could be a multinational ship launched from Earth and there could be
different factions squabbling with hidden agendas etc. Don\'t forget to add
in Christian/Muslim crackpots wanting to do each other in or endanger the
mission as it conflicts with this or that scripture. There could be some
serious discrepancies between the data for the target system given to the
ship and data they actually collect themselves during the mission.

From the generation outline, the process looks much improved.  I\'m very 
happy to see the return of the military heroism awards and medals!  

However, I have a question about the educational procedures. It says that 
one receives the increase to EDU only if one graduates.  That is a good 
change.  However, it doesn\'t state the numerical value of the increase.  
I\'m hoping it is now only 1 point per four years - or at most 2 points - 
rather than 1 point per year.  

Is that the case?


Thank you for sharing the work in progress,

This effect is included in PE to some degree. Military units are rated in
absolute numbers. But it costs less to get a given number at higher TLs.
The figures dosen\'t correspond with the results you get using High Guard
combat rules, but then, those rules don\'t apply any longer (Sigh... the
thing I dislikes most about rules changes are those that change some
background aspect fundamentally). And I must admit that while I can
accept that 300 RUs worth of TL 10 combat units could be an even match
for 150 RUs worth of TL 12 combat units, I find it difficult to believe
that _any_ number RUs worth of TL 0 combat units can match 150 RUs worth
of TL 12 units.

I\'m interested, but I wonder just how much we can accomplish unless we can
drum up a playtest group apiece. I came up with my own suggestions for
planetary improvement, because the official ones are so obviously wrong,
but I have no way to know whether my own ideas aren\'t equally flawed.

Since you mention population growth I\'d like to reiterate one of my firm
opinions about the Traveller universe: That every spacefaring race in the
universe must practice some form of population control for most of their
history (and that includes the Aslans). Otherwise there have been more
than time enough to cover all of Charted Space with sentients. (Try working
out the number of Aslans you would have after 3000 years if they start with
a few billions in -2000 and have a population growth of 3% pa.).

I knew Father\'s Day was going to cause someone not to be able to make it...
me as it turns out. :) (Actually, it\'s my Father-in-law, but I don\'t mind
as he\'s a pretty nice guy...)

Anyways, I don\'t want to stop people from getting together, but I would
like to meet everybody, so... does anyone have any suggestions for a 
new date/time? How about Saturday night-ish instead of Saturday afternoon?

I checked out the Sci-Fi Cafe, it\'s pretty nice, my only concern is
that you pretty much have to have a car to get there and not everyone
has a car for sure. Is there anyone who can\'t make it to Steeles & Dufferin?
(just go straight up Allen Rd. and it turns into Dufferin)

As a second choice, I might suggest the Electric Bean, which is right
beside Eglinton Station, at Yonge & Eglinton. It\'s a new \'cyber-cafe\'
kinda thing, so I guess we could spend _even more time_ geeking out
whilst getting together. Anyways, I\'ve never "bean" there, but it seems
like a big place and it\'s really easy to get to via the TTC.
(Oooh, it even has a web page - http://www.electricbean.com )

Anyways, I\'ve only had about 4 responses, so everyone I CC:ed on this, please
let me know what you\'d like to do... if it doesn\'t seem to be working
out, I\'ll scrub the mission and we can try to regroup at some other
date/time/place.

Even if you didn\'t reply to me before, if you\'re interested in coming,
please let me know! Again, Greyhound has pretty cheap fares these days
and it\'s not a long drive/bus ride from all points east... we\'re
definitely not limiting attendance to people who gag when someone
says "Megacity".

Thanks!

And 1DT of Ammonia contains 2DT of hydrogen...I remember a long discussion
ages and ages ago on this list about ammonia-fueled ships. The problem, of
course, is what do you do with the 1/2 dt of nitrogen you generate when
creating the jump bubble?

I mean, everyone will get bored fast playing with freezing things in LN2,
and storing it on board poses a serious danger of asphyxiation, though not
as bad as storing all the O2 if you use water as a fuel...

A not particularly bright person stuck a dewar of LN2 in a walk in cooler
one time at a place I used to work. Fortunately, the person who came in a
few hours later, saw the thing and recognized it for what it was and
bugged out...we had people who would work in the cooler for twenty, thirty
minutes at a time. 

(For the benefit of those who have never worked with it...LN2 is wonderful
stuff for flash freezing biological materials for things like DNA or
labile metabolite extraction. In a closed space LN2, however has this
nasty habit of evaporating and displacing a large portion of the air.
While not directly poisonous, breathing nothing but N2 will kill you PDQ)

Cut marks on their bones prove that, in those days, nature really was red in tooth and claw and that a balanced diet involved the finest protein of all.<p>
Naturally, we are not at all amused by such goings-on. It is disturbing to find that we have cannibalistic relatives. What might they say about our own proclivities? Some cannibals are even closer to us than is Homo antecessor.<p>
 Sixty cultures are known to have indulged in the practice. In some it was the second most important source of meat. Circumcision and the mass - wine into flesh - may each be relics of a ritual anthropophagy that we prefer to forget; humans yielding to grisly appetites coded in their genes.<p>
 Why do we find our ancestors\' antisocial conduct so distasteful? Why, indeed, is any pattern of behaviour in fossils or in living creatures relevant to what we get up to? It seems obvious: our bodies evolved, why not our minds?<p>
 Although cannibalism is no longer an issue, there is almost an industry in explaining human affairs in Darwinian terms. Demonic males, virtuous villages, greedy children; there they all are, lined up in the human zoo with evolution as an alibi. It seems a scientific way of understanding society. But how valuable is the argument from nature? Cannibalism, as straightforward an act as can be imagined, is the perfect excuse for testing it.<p>
 More than 2,000 creatures go in for the pastime. Wall-eye fish in American lakes eat each other tail first, with whole chains of mutual diners busily gnawing away. Salamanders develop teeth which they use, while unborn, to consume their brothers. The habit started long before humans appeared. One 220-million-year-old dinosaur fossil has the skeleton of a young member of its own kind within its rib-cage.<p>
It all looks brutally simple. Surely it should be easy to explain - and the explanation should apply to us. In fact, there are almost as many evolutionary justifications of the self-devouring habit as there are cannibals. The complexity of nature is a warning to those who hope to use her as a universal excuse.<p>
Some creatures murder their kind as an insurance policy. Eagles lay more eggs than are likely to succeed. In a good year, most will; but usually only the first few survive. When hunger strikes, the firstborn eat their siblings - who are unlikely to live and may as well feed their family as they perish.<p>
For most cannibals, however, blood is thicker than water. They avoid the family at mealtimes. Plenty of males kill and eat the young of rivals to give their own genes a better chance. In mice the habit is so engrained that a pregnant female exposed to an unrelated male makes the best of a bad job with a pre-emptive strike. She reabsorbs her own foetuses. This gives the meal to her, not the waiting male.<p>
 In other words, choose your creature, take your pick: eat your relatives or kill outside the clan. For really Gothic complexity visit a beehive. There, the female workers kill and eat unrelated males. In some species the manly way to fight back is transvestism. Males pretend to be female; acting - and dressing - like a sister while furtively copulating on the side. If they are caught, death is instant. In others, though, counterfeit masculinity is the issue. Some females change sex and become active but sterile males. They present the opposite problem, but their fate is the same: food for the sisters.<p>
Nobody has yet taken up the parable of the beehive to explain (or condemn) human sexual habits. Even so, all this shows that evolution is infinitely complex - which makes it a marvellously flexible excuse. Not just cannibalism, but capitalism; not only socialism but celibacy - all are (according to taste) in the blood. Pick an example from nature and you have the perfect justification for whatever behaviour you choose.<p>
 When it comes to understanding what makes us human, biology is like a bikini. It shows what is interesting, but hides what is essential. We are, of course, constrained by evolutionary history, but only in the sense that pigs are limited in the ability to fly by their ancestors\' lack of wings. It is interesting to find that there are evolved drives for cannibalism or for greed: but essential to realise that Homo sapiens, unique among all creatures, need not defer to them. The site of human evolution has made a simple but crucial move, from body to mind. When that happened, we do not know. It means, though, that dead Spanish cannibals, fascinating though they may be, are no more srelevant to lives today than are transvestite bees.<p>

I know this is a game and there is a lot of hand waving going on... but -
please dont tell me I really need those Zuchai crystals for the
discharge... And I really do then as A captain of a ship I would set up
secondary accumulators which could hold my charge Indefinitely (or as long
as I have the power plant on) then dump it into the Jump Drives Zuchai
Crystals for the jump transition... Now what percent of the fuel is used
to charge those crystals - I could get back... 

I like the notion of the MASS or VOLUME of the rest of the fuel creating a
stabiliy option... however, lets not confuse energy and how we can or can
not store it... for that matter power cells could discharge into the
Zuchai crystals or even plain old batteries... (which we could then
refuel or recharge)... Not to mention our power plant could charge the
crystals ... unless we need a rapid charge - then something like HPG\'s
could be use or EPG\'s....

I do not recall any specifics.  They did say that the limit was measures in
hours, and the number was pretty small.

I like your suggestion for the results of trying to keep it there longer.
(I allow them to keep the power in the array for up to an hour without
harm, but after that, things get a bit dicey.  This makes stealthing a bit
interesting, as the ship then has very limited radiating capability.)

Agreed!  Technology should be more important, imho.  they do have some
impact, in the credit exchange table used to determine the actual credit
value of an RU, but I wanted it a bit clearer just how much of a
powerhouse, economically, a high tech world is.  (My rule of thumb - 2-4
tech levels is an order of magnitude, depending on field.)

I am a bit vexed that it does not get cheaper to transport as TL goes up,
which is why my TL12 J1 drives cost a lot less and are a lot smaller than
my TL9 ones.  I am moving to the system where the best jump that the tech
can produce takes a certain fixed size and cost, with lesser drives falling
off in size and cost fairly rapidly.

Yep.  I want this kind of effect as well - no TL 12 culture should be
beaten by a TL 9 culture, unless the TL 9 culture has 25 times the
population, or the TL12 culture cannot use the advantages it has.  Civil
war works, lack of military funding, and so on.

Like the idea!  And let me repeat here that I do like the supplement a
great deal.  I think it needs tweaking, but not generic rewriting.  Adding
a few charts or calculation results, and then running a few million monte
carlos on the results should do it.

If you are dubbing it, should it not be \'Sir PE vs. reality(tm)\'?  haut?  Von?

Oops, You\'re right.  Metator is great, and generating detailed tables is
easy, but I take it a step further; I want tables that are specific to
individual worlds, so that if the planet\'s description says "A major
exporter of Steel Alloys" the "Steel Alloy Construction Materials" shows
quite prominently on the trade table.  Of course, other than these few
exceptions the more random method works well.

Damn, what was the Heinlien book? Tunnel in the Sky?  Do I have the right
author?

Anyway the scenario was basically a ship based culture that was no longer
aware they were on a ship.  They believed the ship was the world.  Areas
above a certian "deck" were taboo (bridge and ships conrols) and the
people had formed their tribes and sects.

Cool idea, wish I could remember the name of the thing for sure.  Old Age

I\'ve only checked through my sections, so far, but there are several
(minor) bits wrong. Most crucially, the example family tree for the
Cararialta Family is arse-ways. Hazel the Younger is the grandson of Hazel
the Elder, not the grandfather. (!)

In general, follow the text, not the tables or the diagrams. The text is
almost always correct.

In some Cararialta examples, Anfinwen is refered to as "he". This should be
"she".

There are numerous inconsistencies in presentation. The intro casts it
primarily as a role playing schema where the players are various members of
a Imperial Noble family making a new start beyond the fringe. The back text
protrays the focus as pre-existing upstart empires beyond the fringe.
Tapestry of Stars says different players play individual pocket empires.
Sure, you do can all of that with the product, however I would have
expected the IG editors to have put some consistancy into the presentation.

Anyway, I was going to start a web page of errata (since I have the
original family tree I sent to IG which was _quite_ clear) but I\'m not sure
that\'s legal.

I _might_, in a few weeks, start a Pocket Empire Play-by e-mail. If I do it
will be "rules lite". The focus would mainly be on role playing the family
politics rather than gearhead budgets and wish-fulfillment dictators. If
you are interested _wait_ a few weeks, then say so. (I\'m on business. I
need to get back and get my life in order.)

Yea, you are probably right.  I think I\'m going to abandon this 
initiative thingy and stick with the official rules--that is until 
another idea hits me.

> How about just using TNE\'s initiative ?

No, TNE allows for multiple action in a round.  T4 covers that in a 
different (and I think better) way with the multiple action rule.

You could use the base init from  TNE, though, but I think that I\'ve 
found out that this initiative thing needs more thought.

It\'s not really broken in T4--just a little basic.  I was wanting to 
add some depth to it based on a character\'s skills and background, 
but I want the addition to be simple.

For now, I think I\'ll just play with it as is.  You never know, maybe 
Marc will surprise us with a brilliant idea for this in T4-Revised.

I really like this.  I used to differentiate between homeworld and

I like this too.  Is this the same as the 4 background skills allowed 
in T4?  Or, will a character be allowed a variable number of skills 
based on his homeworld?  If so, what is the range of skills expected, 
ie 2-4?

One note of caution here.  The T4 system is a little too generous 
with regard to awarding skills.  With the way default skills are 
being handled in T4 (which I think is brilliant), a character comes 
out of chargen too powerful with no where to grow to.

It should be a rare occurrence when we see a character with a level 5 
or 6 skill--especially straight out of chargen.

I like the idea of having an opportunity to receive a skill each year 
(rather than the 1 skill per 4 years as in CT), but I don\'t think 
this should be automatic.

I think the advanced chargen used in CT\'s Mercenary/High Guard/Scouts 
renedered ballanced characters--not too many skills, but enough to 
make him playable.  Coupling this with the way default skills are 
handled now, a character straight out of chargen has a lot of skills 
to pull from.

One way to put a limiting factor in the T4 chargen process is to have 
a character roll to see if he is awarded a skill that year--just like 
in CT/MT advanced chargen.

For example, look at the Marine chargen table on page 29 of Book 1.  
I suggest keeping everything as is, except you add a roll for skill 
next to the other rolls listed (Enlistment, Injury, Commission, etc)

The roll might be a number between 6 and 9--you\'d have to roll, say, 
7- to get a skill if you were a Marine.

I\'ve grabbed these numbers out of CT Book 4:  Mercenary (and inverted 
them for the T4 low is better system).  To come up with one skill 
number for a Marine career, I\'d figure a weighted average based on 
the numbers given in CT\'s Book 4.  

For example, if a marine has a training assignment in Book 4, he 
needs to roll a 7+ to get a skill.  If he has a Raid assignment, 
he needs to roll a 5+ to get a skill.  

I\'d assign weights to the actual assignments (like a Marine will 
roll a Raid assignment about 8.33% of the time), and then I\'d 
perform a weighted average to find a general skill throw number 
for Marines.

I\'d do this for each of the different careers, but the end result 
would be that a number is generated that has to be rolled each 
year, or the character doesn\'t get a skill that year.

Another dimension this will add to chargen is that players can use 
it to make their choices.  "I can go in the Army and only have to 
roll 5- per year to get a skill, or I can go into the Marines and 
have to roll 7- per year to get a skill.  The Army is also easier 
to get into than the Marines, but the Marines have these certain 
skills that you cannot get in the Army."

I\'m sure there are other ways of handling this, it just that I 
think adding a skill roll per year might be the easiest.

Cool.  Keep track of hit points on the character sheet.  I have

for NPCs.

The cascade skills are a nice touch--to remind the players what\'s 
available to them.

One thing I\'d like to add, Marc.  Going hand in hand with chargen is 
character experience.  I hope that you have devoted some time to this 
because the system in T4 is completely broken.  I\'d like to see a 
character expereince system that allows the character to grow at the 
same rate he did in chargen.  If he averaged 1 or 2 skills per year 
in chargen, then while playing the character, he should gain skills 
at a rate of 1 or 2 skills per year as well.

Chargen in Traveller is really just an abstract way of roleplaying a 
character through multiple years.  Actually playing the character 
should reflect that.

Marc, I\'ve got to say that I am impressed with what you have posted 
here.  To tell you the truth, I didn\'t have that high of hopes for 
T4-Revised.  I thought it would be a grammar corrected version of 
what we already have.

It looks like you are putting a lot of work into it, and, from what 
I\'ve seen here, it looks like I am going to like a lot of the changes 
you are making.

I\'m actually looking forward to getting it now.  From the EA to PE 
and now this, I\'m getting that feeling back that Traveller is in good 
hands again.  It feels good to have some faith in Traveller\'s 
producer again.

Keep up the good work.  I sincerely like what you have posted here.

Kenneth.

Come on, Hans! Haven\'t you seen "Return of the Jedi"? I think that\'s proof

As a TNE Referee I find TNE\'s initiative system is too deterministic, and
the inititive die roll at chargen time too important.

Recently I\'ve been experimenting with a where a character\'s initiative only
effects action declaration except in \'Wild West\' style shoot-outs and melee
combat. In this the character\'s action are declared from worst to best
initiative, and then resolved pretty much simultaenously, except for melees
which are resolved from best to worst (along with any shots fired into
them). Currently I\'m got initiative from the TNE initiative +1D6 and any
applicible aglity penatlies for melee, but I\'m not entirely happy with this.

	I don\'t know the Heinlien book, but Harry Harrison has written an
excellent one called "Captive Universe" (c) 1969, ISBN 0-586-05677-7

	This is about an Aztec tribe who are very unaware of the real truth behind
their world. When the truth emerges, there are quite a few details that
describe the way the captive inhabitants are looked after, plus a bit about
ship operations. I read this book a few years ago, so I can\'t remember too
much, but it is definitely the sort of thing that would be useful to anyone
interested in a generation ship scenario.

	And there\'s another book I have too by Brian Aldiss called "Non-Stop" (c)
1958, ISBN 0-14-017353-6

	Apart from some excellent twists, the storyline involves a journey through
the ship, which could be useful in describing to players parts of a
generation ship. Although bits of it are very un-Traveller, there\'s plenty
there to be useful.

 	Then there is a novel by Ben Bova called "The Exiles Trilogy", about a
modified prison ship that leaves Earth for the stars. Each of the three
parts deals with an entirely different generation in the ship\'s history. I
don\'t have the ISBN number.

	And finally, there is "Earthsearch" and "Earthsearch 2 - Deathship", both
by James Follett.

	An asteroid collides with the ship, killing all but four of the ship\'s
inhabitants. They are just babies at the time of the disaster, and their
lives and even their hormonal growth is controlled by the ship\'s computer.
There\'s plenty of exploring - "No one\'s been in that part of the ship for
hundreds of years, what are you doing!!!" etc... There\'s also bags of
cryogenic suspension involved, while the ship journeys ever onwards
searching for planet Earth. This is also one of the best books I\'ve ever
read, and if I could find it I\'d read it again! Needless to say, I don\'t
have the ISBN number to hand, sorry.

	Oh, and I thought I\'d mention the second part of "Hitchhikers Guide to the
Galaxy", "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe" by Douglas Adams. You
will find this on any half-decent shop\'s sci-fi bookshelf. Although the
story is a laugh by nature, the ship featured isn\'t really a generation
ship, but it does have a ship containing thousands of colonists. Might be
worth it for a laugh in your campaign ;-)

	I also believe that the RPG "Metamorphosis Alpha" has recently been
re-released. This game is set on a massive generation ship, and was also
the very first item featured in the first edition of White Dwarf. This may
be of some help.

	I also think that one would find bits of the wonderful ;-) TV show
"Battlestar Galactica" useful too. Although not very Traveller, there are
plenty of scenes of people cooped up in the battlestar, as well as the
ships it protects. Episodes have featured different aspects of a
civilisation living onboard a starship; recreation, the hydroponics ship,
command, medical, a shipboard fire, sensors ops, comms, etc... I\'m sure you
all know, just thought it might be helpful to mention it ;-)

	There must be plenty of other sources to draw upon, but that\'s all I can
come up with for now!

	See ya...

Another area of research going on now, is to use lasers to manipulate
the electron charges of opaque atoms to allow specific frequencies
through.  The note that I read in Science mentioned that they were
only experimenting with allowing optical frequencies to pass through
a gas of lead atoms.  The scientists, when questioned whether the 
technique could be used on solid materials, said that they were only 
working with gasses, but that it may not be impossible to achieve the
same thing with solids.

Stellar codes.. the first world orbits a type F4 Main sequence star..
bigger and hotter than our sun.  The second orbits a much smaller, colder

    'body' => 'Hi you all,

   I am a newbie to this list (finally), though in the past, I have asked
friends to post things here.  I am finally getting on here hoping I can
manage the extra bandwidth via the digest.  Some of you may know me from
the TNE-pocket mailing list, or the History of the Imperium Working Group
(HIWG) mailing list, or even from my Traveller WWW pages (a Webring site).

   I am not a newbie to Traveller, having been in from the beginning in
1977.  Some of you may know me from articles I did in JTAS #22/#24 and
the help I gave to the Atlas of the Imperium (in the credits there).  I
am also in the credits of MegaTraveller and TNE.  I plan to add T4 to that
list soon!

   My hobbies (outside of this game) are computers and astronomy.  I am
graduating next Spring with a Bachellor\'s of Science in Computer Science
and Engineering (being a Physics major dropout when the company I worked
for then, made me a programmer before there was such a thing as a C.S.
degree), and will most likely start on my Master\'s degree in, if not in an
outright C.S. field, a C.S. related field in some Astronomy/Astrophysics/
Space Science (NASA) application.

   I have everything worth having that has been published for this game,
and some things not worth having. :)  I have met most of the early majors
(Marc, Loren, J.Andrew) of the game and could kick myself in the rear for
not having pursued the possibility of taking the product line of Traveller
over when GDW was looking (and later found DGP).  I told Marc that my
friends and I had formed a company, but we were arguing over the name.
I quit the partnership of that company to keep my friends, and alas missed
the opportunity to do MT.  But, we did keep playing Traveller, so that was
good.

  I\'ve heard you all are long on opinion around here, so I look forward
to gathering some of that in the near future.  Of course, I have some
opinions myself, and am not shy about airing them.  From what I hear, I\'ll
fit in nicely. :)

  My web pages are at:
     http://ouray.cudenver.edu/~lwlguatn

  To save space and time, saying things here, I plan to put up a tml-devoted
page so that I can do things like, "refer to WWW reason #n here."  I think
I like that idea, borrowing from one of the only two radio talk show hosts
I like to listen to.  He is fond of telling his callers that they are
repeating themselves and if they have nothing new to say, don\'t say it.  It
seems highly applicable to the Internet as well. :)

  My name is Leroy W.L. Guatney (the extra L. was added when I married my
lovely wife, so some of the credits have only the W.) and in the late summer
of 1994 (has it really been that long?), I spent an hour in a Bloomington
Denny\'s with Marc going over old times, and briefing him on the state of
the game.  Sadly, I was right, but at least there wasn\'t a long night
between T3 and T4. :)  I gave him my heartfelt thanks for having invented
the game in the first place, and he had no idea how many hours of enjoyment
it had given me.

  Look for my involvement with T4 as well as TML in the future.  Don\'t look
for me to be bashing it--as that oft-used saying goes, "S--t happens."  We
often loose site of the fact that gaming has evolved quite a bit since we
first got those black books, and sometimes we judge today in a void of proper
comparisons.  No, I\'m not an apologist--just a realist.  When friends and I
were waiting for the first Space Shuttle to liftoff, our response to reports
of graft in NASA were, "I don\'t care how much graft it is going to take to
get our Space Shuttle on orbit."

The F4 V and M7 VI are stellar classification codes.

SD Mooney asked how the codes worked just four days ago. At the risk of 
repeating myself... aw, heck, I\'ll just repeat myself:

<regurgitate ON>

Stars are classified by Spectral Type and Luminosity Class.

The sequence of Spectral Type classifications, from hottest to coldest is 
OBAFGKM (with RNS being special types).

The types are subdivided by a digit 0-9 following the letter code.

Following the Spectral Type are Roman numerals denoting the Luminosity 
Class of the star. Ia and Ib are supergiants, II are bright giants, III 
giants, IV Subgiants, V are main sequence stars (dwarfs) like our sun, VI 
are subdwarfs and VII (or D) are white dwarfs.

<regurgitate OFF>

So in the examples you cite, "F4 V" is a main sequence star, hotter than 
our sun (which is a G2 V, iirc). "M7 VI" is a red subdwarf in the later 
stages of its life, quite cold.

If there\'s more than one stellar code on the same line, then the system 
is a binary, or trinary system.

These are the type and size of the primary star. You have a
F4-V as the star for the first world and a M7-VI as the second
world\'s star.

Says Bruce as his character tries to wiggle out of the "Detain for
Mental Observation" his character\'s background stuck him with before the
game even started! Tim might agree with you too...just wait until you
find out what *his* character\'s background is. ;->  We\'ve got a Section
Eight and a Section Four (at least I think it\'s Four). 

Glenn, I saved and printed your chargen stuff. Good job.

I\'ve read that system, variants of which appear in a number of R. Talsorian
games. I was intrigued by the concept, but I thought their method was poor.
Also, their system is intentionally a "soap-opera" conflict generator -
while my system is only as soap-operatic as you want it to be. The Life
Events system can be highly realistic if that\'s what you\'re looking for -
at least I hope it has that potential.

>At first glance I like it, though I\'d want to run through it a couple of
>times to see what\'s generated.

Do let me know if you find it useful. Suggestions for improvements are invited.

It was awfully early in the morning when I posted the system - which is why
I forgot to give my post a proper Subject line. I also mention that there
are supposed to be "a few" extra tables after the Events tables, but in the
end I only put in one (the "Other" table). I was thinking of adding more
tables, but opted for simplicity in midstream (in other words, I got tired
and went to bed).

A few words of explanation might also be in order, regarding some of the
Events. Under "Health", you\'ll find "get a minor body modification" - this
is supposed to mean something like a tattoo, a piercing, a scarrification
ritual, a nose job or other cosmetic surgery, small implanted device -
whatever fits within the world\'s Tech Level and culture. A "major body
modification" might be anything from a whole-body tattoo, complete skin
change, sex change, radical regenerative treatment, extra arms, major
implant or prosthetic - but again, it has to be within the world\'s Tech
Level (unless the PC can afford an off-planet biomod junket).

I put this in because I think people in a TL-12 society are likely to have
a John Varley-esque attitude toward their bodies. They\'ll change genders,
colors, or species at the drop of a hat. This may not be canonical, but I
think it creates interesting new role-playing opportunities.

could slot it in anywhere you like but I would suggest that I would go
something along the line of this:

1. suffer a disfiguring injury, Charisma drops by 1
2. seriously injured in a sporting match. Agility drops by 1
3. have a disasterous accident, lose a random limb or have it replaced

Any comments on this are most welcome (especially if you can enlarge on

Some of you will remember that I argued that any planet within a 
single Jump (of whatever TL) from a high Tech planet would have 
access to the TL of said planet and that the local TL would be 
irrelevant, except to note what they could *produce* locally.

Well, consider this. There are a number of planets in First Survey 
that have A Class Starports with TLs of less than 9, the minimum 
required for Jump Drives/Building Starships and there are many more 
that have Class B Starports with TLs of less than 7 (the likely 
minimum for producing non-Starships).

Given that a B Starport costs 600 RUs, and an A Starport costs 2400 
RUs, and that an RU is (more or less) equal to the investment of 1 
trillion credits and that the Cr has always been assumed to be (from 
the 1970s AFAIR) around US$2, then we are looking at planets that 
obviously have had starports constructed there by foreigners, at 
higher than local TLs.

I did some quick calculations, and it seems that the worlds in 
question have GWPs of only about the same as the actual cost of the 
Starports.

So, consider this, we have worlds with less than the required TL for 
building non-starships with 600 trillion credit starports or with 
less than the required TL for building starships with 2400 trillion 
credit starports. And these have no effect whatsoever on the local 
effective TL?

Pull the other one, it plays jingle bells.

Since these ports are capable of building starships/spaceships and 
all that goes with them *and* since the investment is so huge that 
they are obviously incorporating all or almost all of the actual 
construction facilities in situ -- and probably construct most of the 
componets in situ as well, based on the infrastructure cost -- then 
how can you possibly justify the rest of the world not having more or 
less the same TL?

Now, sure, you *could* argue that these are "relic" facilities from 
the ROM or 1st imperium, but a quick check of The Spinward Marches 
sourcebook for CTrav reveals the same anomalies, so that\'s obviously 
*not* the case.

Surely the rule should be that if a world has a B Starport they 
*must* have at least TL7 commonly available, if only as imported 
rather than locally produced goods -- or, more likely, with locally 
produced components using key elements that have been imported from a 
TL7 world. For a B Starport, I see that there is no justification for 
a world having less than TL9 for the same sort of reason.

Remember, we are talking amounts of investment in infrastructure here 
that would make the US Deficit look like a "piddling little amount"!

Any thoughts?

Those are the star or stars in the system. In the first system primary
is spectral class F4, size V. The second is spectral class M7 size VI.

Spectral classes from hottest to coolest are: OBAFGKM 
They are divided into 10 steps, so a G0 is next to a F9 (if I recall
correctly). So the F7 star is a lot hotter and brighter than the sun,
while the M7 is a red star and a lot cooler. The size classes range
from I (giant) through VI (dwarf?). 

Also, you\'ll see a few MD, GD, etc type entries. Those are supposed to
be white dwarfs, but really shouldn\'t be there at all. (Long story
involving real astronomy).

Right author, wrong book. What you want is "Orphans of the Sky". 

Other books on the Generation ship idea are:

"Starship" by Brian Aldiss
"Ballad of Beta-2" by Samuel Delany

Those are the only ones I can recall off the top of my head, but they
are all good, but with different "takes" on things. Pay attention to
the way Delany was dealing with language shifts back then.

JTAS #1 "Annic Nova" an alien ship that has *solar powered* jump drives!

I rather like the idea, and then there\'s the listing of AM powered jump
drives on the really high tech charts. 

So put me down as going with the idea that the jump drive needs all the
*energy* the jump fuel provides. But like a rocket engine, it\'s not
*practical* to turn it from an engine into a power plant (or rather,
doing so winds up with a pretty much normal sized plant for that output
because of all the stuff you had to add to get the power out).

So in my book, you can jump as long as you can get enough energy to the
drive fast enough. Heck, it may even be possible to supply the energy
more slowly, but at the cost of needing more to make up for "losses"
(But who wants to be sitting there for an hour making the transition to
jump space? Talk about a sitting duck!)

ps. if it\'s possible to get jump drive before fusion power, you have
the "what are we doing with all this %^^#$ hydrogen?"problem all over
again.

Another nasty regarding LN2 that you may not be aware of. If it has a
substantial amount of surface exposed to air, it will convert from LN2
to LOX. This is because LOX has a higher boiling point so it condenses
out of the air as the LN2 evaporates. Shallow trays of LN2 should be
looked at for the slightest trace of "blue" coloring (indication that
they are now LOX).

Frankly, tech progress in traveller is badly broken, but *has* to be
badly broken. Any *rational* level of tech progess reaches the
"Singularity" (ie the point where anything we can currently *imagine*
that is actually *possible* IS doable) thus rendering the universe
unusable beyond that point.

So we have two choices:

1. unrealisticly long times for tech advances
2. tech levels go "ballistic" before *any* of the large groups form.

After all, even considering our current "slow" progress with regards to
space travel. What are the odds that we won\'t hit max traveller TLs in
a couple of centuries or less? Now consider how far we\'ll get in that
much time. 

Interstellar travel is starting to look more like Anderson\'s recent
stuff than like Traveller. The travellers will be a "small" culture
that has budded off the main culture, and deliberately avoided
Vingean "transcendence". 

No interstellar empires. Just a bunch of sophonts who refuse to "grow
up" and choose to explore the universe instead.

Just be *very* careful. The program wasn\'t very SF. For example, that
shipboard fire could have been fought in two different ways. First, cut
off the air. Ok, that\'s a bit hard on anybody trapped in there. But the
SF answer is "turn off the gravity". No gravity, no convection
currents, no flames. The fire strangles on its own smoke (no grav,
smoke don\'t "rise").

I like this. It shows that our fighters running at 3 g more than the
compensators *are* doable, and with simple accel couches at that. With
g-tanks it looks like you could get *6* g above the comps. Which makes
fighters a *definite* good idea!

As for jump capsules. note that the very first line has someone in a
accel couch changing velocity by 6.8 km/sec! That\'s enough to de-orbit
safely! Also, they\'d be covering 100 km in the process. I think we
have a winner!

This does require a suit that acts like an accel couch, but that\'s not
out of the question.

For our fighters, I see a lot of 40 g evasion manevers, as that seems
to be a limit. But who can afford a 40 g drive?

One thing I\'ve heard is that the rate of onset of the acceleration (ie
third derivative forces) makes a *big* difference in survivability of
high accelerations. They designed ejection seat accel profiles around
that bit of info. It matters not just how high the accel is but how
fast it changes.

It\'s "spacetime" that it is reacting with. sort of like a magnetic
field or electrical field reacts when you stick the other sort of field
into it. Unless you balance things carefully, it gets messy.

Consider... hydrogen is just protons and electrons. As such it can
exist under conditions (changes in fundamental "universal" constants)
where other forms of matter *cannot* exist. Putting the other forms of
matter into such alternate conditions will resulting in a rather messy
conversion of the other matter into hydrogen. Messy in the sense of "boom".

Hmmm. Now that I think about it, that\'s why you dump hydrogen into the
bubble at first. It can exist ok under phsyical laws that other things
can\'t. You monitor the rate at which the impurities get converted to
hydrogen to tell you when the laws in your jumpspace bubble stabilize
close enough to ours to let you stick in an instrument to monitor the
final fine tuning.

While I don\'t like the hydrogen needed for the jump bubble idea, this
*does* make a good handwave. You can\'t be sure that the spacetime
bubble you are creating matches ours closely, so you need something
"safe" to stick in to see if it gets "eaten".

Well, in keeping with my idea of the spacetime bubble not quite
matching ours, there could be a risk of things getting out of hand
because of small differences (c is 2.996666e8m/s instead of 2.9979245e8
m/s for example).

True, the contents of the bubble should wind up back here, regardless.

The bubble will disperse at the speed of the component atoms. A few
km/sec as I recall. This depends on temperature. What happens is that
with nothing to confine them, they just keep moving in a straight line
in a random direction until they hit something. As the cloud spreads,
that happens less and less often.

Neglible. In less than an hour it\'d be far too dispersed to distinguish
from such things.

> How much time would a ship have to detect a hydrogen cloud?

Not too long. Minutes at most. And the emerging ship will leave it
behind, the ship\'s mass isn\'t enough to keep it nearby.

> How hard would it be for sensors to detect it?

Hard. you\'d have to detect some effect on photons travelling thru it.
Not bloody likely. No way to tell the difference between a photon
that\'s passed thru a ship sized bubble and one that\'s passed through a
few million km of slightly denser than normal interplanetary space.

> Would a ship jumping in-system light up momentarily, like a comet?

Nope. But it *will* create quite a pulse on any gravity wave detectors
or mass detectors as its mass "appears out of nowhere".

MA was a SF roleplaying game put out by T$R a long time ago...perhaps
before, but certainly of an age as CT; it\'s another claimant to the
"First SF RPG ever" title. You play a mutant \'something\'
living on a huge generation ship where the central reactor blew a gasket
flooding the ship with radiation a long time ago.

You don\'t know you\'re on a ship.

I know someone who played a mutant telepathic fungus living on the back of
another player\'s character, a spider, whose player had no clue why the GM
told her that her character did these odd things occasionally, or why she
heard voices in her head.  She thought her mutant had an insanity
disability. 

Me, I was pretty normal, a 6\' tall cobra with these skinny weak arms.

Convection currents have little to do with the presence of a 
gravitational field. Consider: the flame, in zero-G, creates a 
high temperature, low pressure region of air in its immediate 
vicinity. The lower temperature, higher pressure air further away
immediately moves in to occupy the space, driving the warmer air
out. That\'s the convection and gravity has nothing to do with it.

Smoke particles will be carried away with the lower pressure air.

If I read this correctly, a PC from a Lo, Na, Po world would recieve 3

This is a great feature.. makes the military careers dangerous, without the

Will skills be allocated in a similar manner to T4 ver 1.0?  One skill per

Ah, the Golden Boot Award!  This will make players more likely to hang out

Personaly, I always list skills from highest skill to lowest.  YMMV.

All in all, it looks like T4.1 will be much better than even I had hoped.
Kudos to Marc for doing it right this time.

   Hmmm.  Ken, I suspect that you are being biased by your own task
   system, which puts alot of emphasis on skill level, essentially
   multiplying it relative to the attributes.  So for you, a character
   with skill level 6 will be the role playing equivalent of skill-12
   character in my campaign (where I use the simple target =  skill +
   attribute system).  In my campaign, skill level 6 is no big deal.

   I suggest that Marc use a system that awards skills comensurate with
   the canonical task system, whatever that will be.  Those of us who
   tweak our task system (myself included) should also be responsible
   for tweaking our own skill award system.

   This is how it was handled in CT, and I for one did not care for it.
   There is nothing more heartbreaking than to watch one of your players
   fail skill roll after skill roll and end up with characters who were
   substatially weaker than their comrades.  

   I suggest a faster and fairer method, the N-skills-per term plus a
   few extras for good rolls, like the old Book-2 and the current T4.

   Actually, the experience system in T4, along with the excellent
   multi-task system, is the most delightful innovation I\'ve seen in
   this new Traveller release.  No book-keeping to worry about, no
   grubbing for points by the players, no recording of training dates on
   the character sheets, just a simple roll at the end of each adventure
   (or, the way I handle it, at the beginning of each new session). 
   It\'s fun to watch the players strategize their rolls, taking gambles
   or playing it safe.

	Metamorphosis Alpha was first reviewed in White Dwarf in the UK in the
first edition, dated June / July 1977. Traveller was first reviewed in
White Dwarf nearly a year later, in the April / May 1978 issue.

	I don\'t know if these dates or gaps between them could be applied to the
US release schedules. However the Travller review specifically mentions
that MA came out before it.

	BTW, looking at the MA review, it lists the books a few of us mentioned
here, Orphans of the Sky, Non-Stop, and Captive Universe.

My favourite explanation is that the fuel isn\'t used for power; it\'s
"jump ballast", somehow dumped into jumpspace (or maybe anti-jumpspace) to
initiate the jump. That explains why fuel requirements don\'t go down with TL,
for example, even though power plants are getting morefficient - and why
these miraculous jump power plants that can burn kilotons of fuel in minutes
aren\'t used for anything else.

	I\'d agree with this, plus why not assign some specific skills to specific
trade classifications in the new version?

	Lo could have maybe a vehicle skill (for getting to your neighbours!), Comms
	Na = Business
	Po = Streetwise , Gambling

	In = Computer, Electronics, Medical, Physics, Chemistry, Vehicle, Comms

	As = Vac Suit, Space Craft
	Ba = Survival, Vehicle
	De = Survival, Vehicle
	Ni = JoT, Craftsman
	Ri = Trader, Broker, Computer, Gambling
	Va = Vac Suit, Vehicle

	These is, like, a _really_ rough model, so hopefully you can get the gist.
Some skills may need removing, and conversely, some may need entering as well.

Well, you are right about me being influenced by my task system, but 
my task system was designed to fit in perfectly with T4.

T4 is basically a re-working of CT with a task system.  Paragraphs in 
the main book are taken word for word from the Traveller Book.  

Other game mechanics besides the task system are based on the value 
of CT skills.  Since most of the T4 main book is duplicated from CT 
rules, the value of skills in T4 should be kept the same as in CT.

For example, everytime a game mechanic calls for a skill level to be 
used as a DM on a throw, they\'re talking about a CT value skill.  
Using your example above, a character with a CT level 6 skill would 
equate to a level 12 skill in your game.  Clearly, we are talking 
about two different values for a skill level.

Given all of this, T4 skills should be kept the same value as CT 
skills.

Mind you, I am not advocating that the number of skills a character 
has be reduced.  I think it is a good change in T4 for a character to 
have multiple, different skills to choose from.

What I\'m saying is that it should be hard for any one skill to reach 
level 5 or 6 because so much of the T4 rules are based on CT.  
Chaning the value of a skill level will unbalance the game.

This sounds like a good idea.  I\'ve always thought characters should get
quite a few entry level skills for their first 18 years of life.

There are a number of skills that *should* exist things like swimming,
climbing, hacking (computer intrusion), singing..and from another thread
maybe something like "Combat Experience" or "Cool under fire." So, do
like I do and just add \'em. ;->

The only thing that troubles me is that you\'ll have to use an actually
existing world, ie. one that already has all the Trade Codes created,
generate one, or have such a detailed system to create a birthworld on
the fly that you might as well just use the World Generation System and
be done with it.  

It\'s just too bad a way can\'t be found to get more skills to choose from
during the rolls.  I\'d rather have 10 (or even 20) on each table, and
use d10 or d20...personally, I\'ll end up doing that anyway. ;->

Back in the mid \'70s, TSR released MA, by Jim Ward.  In 1994 they
rereleased a completely revised version called Metamorphosis Alpha to
Omega, by Slade Henson, as part of their Amazing Engine series of games.

Summary:  Generation ship (sublight?) Warden is launched from Earth on
12/25/2290 to Xi Ursae Majoris.  28 years into voyage Warden passed through
radiation cloud (???) that hosed most ship systems and killed most crew and
colonists.  Most colonists go native in nature areas (parklands aboard
ship?) on Warden.  68 years into voyage, ship reachs destination.  Various
(game oriented) mutants and other neer-do-wells kill the last of the
crew(descendents) who are in the final stages of preparing things for
debarkation to the colony world.  For the next 150 years, Warden orbits
world with inhabitants living aboard in complete ignorance.  PCs are
humans, mutant humans, mutant animals, and mutant plants.  The genre\'s
entertaining in the same manner as, say, a Wild West interlude...

How exactly will characters increase Education level during character
generation? The current system of adding 1 to Edu every year is far too
generous and unbalances the game. In my campaign I add 1 to education only
if the character gets honors. This does not seem to unbalance things too
much, and does give an education advantage to characters who have schooling.

I am not in favor of making Computer a common skill. In my campaign,
Computer skill is used for programming and design tasks. At tech levels 7-,
computers are still too rare and specialized for everyone to automatically
have skill in operating them. And at TL 8+ computers are designed to
operate without requiring special training. In either case, not everyone
would automatically have Computer skill.

I like the re-introduction of the military awards, but there should also be
awards for non-military careers.

I also like the possibility of reducing characteristics due to injury or
cold sleep. This will give some disincentive to staying in character
generation until your forties.

If you are mustering out due to injury, do you get a maximum of 6 rolls on
the Cash table or a maximun of 6 benefit rolls?

Perhaps T4.1 could revisit the notion of the Injury roll during character
generation. Currently the only way to leave a career during a term is
through injury. I know of very many people who have left a career in the
middle of a project; and only one was because of injury. I also know of
people who were injured during a career but who returned after a short
absence. The nature of the "injury" is rather peculiar; it\'s supposed to
make it forever impossible for a character to continue in the current
career, regardless of tech level, yet it requires no time for recovery and
has no effect on any future careers or adventuring. Even a psychological
illness can be treated effectively at higher tech levels, and would
strongly affect the character in future careers. The entire step seems
vague and military-oriented. Perhaps you could combine the Injury and
Continuance rolls into a single Outcome roll, where you determine what
happened to the character through a single die roll. It could look
something like this:

	2-	Decoration
	8-	Continuance
	9-	Honorable Discharge
	10-	Dishonorable Discharge
	11+	Injury

It could have the same DMs as the existing Injury roll, and the table could
be customized for different careers. Comments?

Well.. I remember reading a book years ago which stated that astronauts
had tried to burn matches on a space station (can\'t remember whether it
was Skylab or russians ). The smoke from the fire just stayed around the
fire and eventually (quite soon, actually) extinguished it. 

The book was in Finnish, but a translation, but I have no idea of it\'s
name or anything else...

<A bit off topic>
Metamorhosis Alpha was a supplement for AD&D. It did not function as a
standalone game which we found out when we bought it way back in the
seventies. The rules were constantly referring to tables of various sorts
that were to be found in the AD&D books. As we had no idea what roleplaying
was (I bought it because it was SF - I had decided to buy all SF games back
then) all about and lacked lots of tables it was of little use for us. We
rolled up some far out characters and made some maps but that was that.

  One of the members of the group had an early PC - one of those Radio
Shack things.  He liked to write character generation programs so we would
always have extra NPCs available - the one he did for Traveller came up
with a list of Scouts who either were lucky to get out after one term with
their skins, or made it through seven or eight and were fabulously wealthy
and had their own ship and lots of skills.  CT generation was weird that
way, what with the chance of dying thrown in.

  Anyway, he did a program for Metamorphasis Alpha, and most of the
characters turned out were reasonable, though a fair number lacked any
means of moving about or communicating (the char gen system for that game
is _really_ random).  Our favorite character from the list, though, was a
character who was a lettuce whose only mutant power was precognition - we
just died laughing at the thought of this poor lettuce alone in a field,
knowing when it was going to be picked and eaten, but unable to do a thing
about it.  That would be a roleplaying challenge for anyone!

This reminds me of another T$R game called Gamma World. It was sent of
Earth after a nuclear war and the PC\'s could be anything from pure humans
to mutant badgers. Back then I loved it; when I look back on it now I just
think about how stupid the character generation system was. For post
holocaust Roleplay I turn to Rifts.

But some of the options became too wimpy.The checklist details what has to be
done. The text will talk about options. In fact, one option I find I like is
to pre-roll a list of half die, 1D and 2D rolls, and then use them in order
to create a character. You can make any decisions, but you have to use the
rolls in order.

If I read this correctly, a PC from a Lo, Na, Po world would recieve 3
rolls on the World Skills tables, while a PC from a Hi, In world would
recieve 2.  Am I right?

Yes.

If you like your birthworld, you can keep it as a homeworld. If not, you can
decide to have a homeworld too.

Your homeworld is defined in the table by Starport and Trade Classifications
(you may want to search through FS to find a world that matches). You get one
homeworld skill for each trade classification your homeworld has. (ie. Your
homeworld is Industrial; roll 1D on the Industrial column). Which means that
someone from a Na world gets fewer homeworld skills than someone from a Na Va
Ast Ind world.

Injury inflicts up to 3 points (half die) on one characteristic. Recovery
inflicts from 0 to 3 points of recovery. If your injury still has 1 or more
points against you, you may muster out. If 3 points, you must muster out.

I agree that the current experience rule in T4 is completely broken. And that
the basic way to have experience is for a character to continue to add skills
or levels at about 1 per year.

Most of them should be changed to type V (main sequence) or straight dwarf
stars (VII).  The ration should be about 80/20 in favor of the main sequence.

Let me take this opportunity to call once again for the crew doing the FS
revision work to look closely at the stellar data.. An Agricultural world
won\'t be sitting around a barely glowing cinder like a M9D. Take the chance
to revise some of the oddities, and make the *nice* worlds (Rich, HiPop,

I have absolutely no problem with this.  Like I said in my first 
reply to T4.1 chargen, I use the standard, straight 2D, one-time, for 
each attribute--just like in CT and MT.

I doubt I\'ll use another system.  I was just surprised to see 
alternative stat rolling methods when I first looked at T4, and I 
thought it was a pleasant change for those GMs who wanted 
alternatives.

It sounds like what you are doing is making the 2D straight roll the 
offical way to roll stats, but in the text you are describing some 
optional rules.  

Personnaly, I don\'t care if the options are there or not, but it 
sounds like you are pleaseing everybody by having them there.

Your systems seems like a good idea, and I can\'t wait to see them.

Marc...I\'m lovin\' ya. 

 I\'ve got to tell you that my expectation of T4-Revised has 
completely turned around just based on these two posts you\'ve made 
about the chargen system.

My expectations were that T4-Revised would just be a spell-checked 
version of the book we have now.  You are making it clear that it is 
much more than that.

I\'m getting excited about seeing the new book.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

    'body' => 'The value of a T4 skill level...

There seems to be a misconception among some T4 players that one 
actual skill level in T4 is worth less than one skill level in CT.

I\'ve run into this before with our discussions on the task system and 
when I was designing KBv1.1 and KBv2.0.  Most recently, it has been 
brought up again with Marc\'s discussion on T4.1 chargen.

Some people think that having a (just picking a skill off the top of 
my head) Computer-4 in CT is equivalent to having a Computer-8 in T4. 
 In my recent reply to Marc\'s notes on T4.1 chargen, one TMLer cited 
my notes on skill level value and even said that a skill level 
of 6 in my game should be a skill level of 12 in T4.

This may be TNE thinking (where skill levels did reach into the 
double digits), but I want to make it absolutely clear that this is 
not true in T4.  The value of a level 1 skill in T4 is the same as 
the value of a level one skill in CT/MT.  

For those of you who doubt this, let me prove it to you.

First off, I think the misconception of T4 skills came about with the 
broken chargen system (that Marc is fixing, thank God!) in our 
current version of T4.  T4 actually did two things for Traveller 
characters--one of which was good, and one of which was not so good.

T4 did:

(1)  Increased the actual number of different skills a Traveller 
character can obtain in chargen.  This is good.  Characters went from 
having, say, 4-8 skills in CT and MT basic chargen to several varied 
and different skills in T4.

With the multiple skills a character gets in T4 chargen combined with 
all of the default skills that he can now use (over 40 skills!), the 
character has a lot of versitility and options for tackling different 
Traveller tasks.

Again.  This is brilliant, and one of the areas in which T4 shines 
out above all other Traveller rules systems.

(2)  In doing this, though, a limit was not placed on how far one 
particular skill could go.  I\'m not advocating that there be a skill 
limit, mind you, but I am saying that, through dice rolls, it should 
be hard for any one skill to reach level 5 or 6 through chargen.

Basically, what I\'m saying is that a T4 character should have many 
more skills to choose from than a CT character, but the actual skills 
in both rules sets will range in level from 1 to 6 (or so, having no 
skill limit--you might occasionally see a level 7 skill).

If skills in T4 were allowed to reach level 12, or 15 even, I would 
never have had a problem with attributes outweighing skills in the 
task system, and KBv2.0 would be unneccessary.

Here\'s my proof, with examples, that T4 skill levels are the same as 
CT/MT skill levels.

As I mentioned in the other post on this, T4 is just a re-working of 
CT.  Many of the same paragraphs that appeared in the CT Traveller 
Book (and other CT rule books like the 3 black books, Starter 
Traveller, etc) appear in T4 word for word.

T4 is the same game as CT with a few tweaks--the task system.

As you go through the rule book, you see game mechanics that use 
skill level as a DM to throws.  These are the same rules that were in 
CT (albeit they may be inverted throws to account for the lower is 
better system in T4).

Four Examples:

Page 45, Medical Skill.  It states in the skill description that 
Medical-3 is a doctor--just like in CT and MT.  

Page 60, Tactics Pool.  It is clear that the tactics pool is based on 
the MT model (where skill levels were the same as in CT).  Lessening 
the value of T4 skills would mean increasing the points in this pool 
making it much more powerful in combat than it was designed to be.

Page 115, Low Passage rolls.  You get a +1 DM if you have a Medic-2 
or better--just like in CT.  If T4 skills were less value than in CT, 
this rule should read something like, "You get a +1 DM if you have a 
Medic-4 or better".

There are many more instances in the T4 rules where it is clear that 
a T4 skill level holds the same amount of weight that a CT skill 
level does.  If the T4 skill levels were valued differently and 
actually reached the double digits like some have posited, this would 
greatly unbalance many of the rules throughout the book.  IG would 
have to go through the entire rules book and re-work all of these 
rules to fit the new T4 value.

Given all of this, it is completely clear to me that a level-3 T4 
skill is interchangeable with a level-3 CT skill.

This subject becomes awkward to explain because people start thinking 
number of skills vs how large one skill can be.

T4 increased the number of skills a character can earn through 
chargen--it did not increase the level each of those skills can 
reach.

You should never see a double digit skill (Computer-10) in T4 just 
like you would never see that in CT or MT.

YES!

This was, imho, one of the better things to come out of DGP.  When well
done, it makes an adventure a lot easier to run, especially if you play
every few weeks, and might have lost some of the thread.

In my world, the physical laws are fundamentally different.  At the
interface, you occasionally get flashes of energy as the matter involved is
turned to energy, combined with perfect absorbing surfaces that just take
matter away, and so on.

(I have ruled that this is the high tech power source which the ancients
used to make all of that antimatter.  Low tech folks cannot reliably
predict what will happen at the interface, and so must keep it very stable,
and far away from themselves.)

I like your pressure idea, and may steal it.

I have used an alternative explanation - each level of jump space erodes
the jump bubble faster, and it is a linear relationship, so you will need
to have twice as much fuel available if you are in J2 space.  The jump
governor was more a way of programming the drive to only enter J1 space if
you are doing a J1, J2 space for a 2, and so on.

I said the hydrogen thing was a density issue.  At the boundary, you want
as uniform a density as possible, as the decay/erosion happens less
predictably when it hits a particle of matter.  If they could fill the
space with unbound mesons (not the magic particle discovered by Bob, but
real ones that carry the strong nuclear force), then jump would be even
safer.  In addition, chaos theory is hard to work with, and the jump
interface is something that is a bit quirky anyway, so the more simplifying
assumptions they can make, the happier they are.  (Sort of like assuming a
spherical physicist...)

Refined fuel is pure hydrogen, which makes life easier.  If you get crud in
there, you have other elements hitting the J-space<->realspace boundary,
and causing some kind of fluctuation.  This happens anyway, but you might
get unlucky enough to have a serious fluctuation, which catapults you into
parts unknown, or splits the bubble (and the ship) in two.

This also works.  I kind of like my approach of making a controlled J7-j36
possible, due to the misjump rules, but so difficult that any race that
could do it would already be using instantaneous teleportation.

I have a number of bad holovid shows that get mentioned, like "Light
Crusiers Everywhere", a bit of Lucan fluff propaganda.  I may add "Evil
Jumpspace Monsters" next time.  Kind of cute...

I make it a point to wrap the vivid images that I create the universe with
in proper technobabble, though, so that I can keep the players happy.  For
example, the decay of the pocket universe is usually referred to as an
"self sustaining Jumpspace boundary breakdown."  (The rule is that the
scarier the problem, the longer the tech words.

>You also have to deal with loss of mass in our universe, and whatever
>nastyness that may entail.

In point of fact, this was the big problem that either the Grandfather or
the Baddies from the Core are facing up to - continued pinching off of
space time for pocket universes, plus the steady leak of matter into
Jumpspace may turn the universe from closed to open, which excessive
experimentation into the structure of Jumpspace may make it go the other
way.  Whichever happens, someone is going to be unhappy.

Not unreasonable.  I use the dynamic nature to give pilots and engineers
something to do during jump.

A good point - one should address it one way or another.  I kind of like
some of the H2 escaping into real space as a possible way to detect the
somehow undetectable vessels.  (Not to rehash the stealth topic - I just
like it too much to let it die, but I have not found an appropriate hand
wave to use it yet.)

well, since I only have 25 bucks to spend this pay period, I think I will go

        I tried to send this to the list yesterday, but apparently it never
went through.  In the event you receive this twice, then I apologize.

        I have a quick question to pose to those TML\'ers with more physics
background than I.  Here\'s the situation:

        Consider an orbital station, say around 5,000 metric tons mass.
Now, suppose there was a ship docked to this station, of around 200 tons,
but with rather robust engines (it\'s a ground-to-orbit cargo hauler,
currently unloaded).  It is docked nose-on to the station, facing in the
opposite direction from the station\'s orbital path.
        Okay.  Now suppose this cargo hauler flares its engines, say about
5G for about 1.5 seconds.  What will be the effects?  Here are the main
effects, as I envision them:

1.) The station suffers a sudden, sharp deceleration, dropping it below
orbital velocity.  The station\'s orbit begins to decay.
2.) The airlock the cargo hauler is docked to likely crumples under the
sudden strain, possibly opening the hauler to space and parking it partway
into the station itself. (Providing it holds together.)
3.) Everybody on the station not strapped down goes flying HARD against a
convenient bulkhead, console, etc.
        
        Does this sound right?  Am I missing anything glaringly obvious?  I
would appreciate any insight you guys can give me.

Thanks in advance,

Well, since the hauler\'s drive is rated at 5 gees of thrust for the
hauler itself, considerably less will be imparted to the hauler:station
complex.

You\'ll definitely wreck the airlock, and probably seriously damage both
the starship and the station, but you probably won\'t impart THAT great a
change of velocity to the station. You will send the station into a lower
orbit certainly, but I doub\'t you\'ll deorbit it completely. 

People will notice it, probably the whole station will shudder, and alarms
start screaming everywhere. And vaccsuit drill starts for real. 

But please, tell me where they have stations like this set up WITHOUT
drive interlocks on the ships docking to prevent the drives from powering
up, and preventing this entirely? I\'ll stay the heck away! A drive
lockout is a basic piece of safety policy for a station that actually
physically contacts the station.

   T4 skill levels do not equate well with those in CT and MT for two
   reasons:

   1) Character competition.  Because T4 characters have so many skills
   at such high levels, a fair minded referee cannot just indiscrimantly
   mix old CT characters with new T4 characters.  On average, to make a
   CT character as attractive to a player as a T4 character is, you need
   to double or even triple the CT character\'s skill levels.

   2) The task system. (Since CT did not have a task system, I will here
   compare T4 with MT.)  In MT, the skill level was used as a modifier
   to a roll of 2 dice for all tasks of all difficulties.  T4, however,
   uses a task system that rolls a variable number of dice.  Due to
   "task inflation" (the tendancy of the referee to increase the number
   of dice rolled to counter the way-too-easy-to-make task rolls listed
   in the rules) and the need to keep moderately difficult tasks from
   becoming automatic, the number of dice rolled in my campaign is
   typically 3-5.  Now the statistics here are a little tricky and
   depend on target numbers and whatnot, but typically a skill-2
   modifier on 4 dice will not mean as much as a skill-2 modifier on two
   dice.  

   Number 2 is especially true of Edu based skills, since Edu-15
   characters are trivial to generate in the T4 rules.  So a "routine"
   Edu based task will be about 4 dice, due to task inflation.  The Edu
   rules in T4 are not well thought out, and need to be improved.  The
   preponderance of Edu-15 characters in my campaign effectively means
   that I never use Edu as a task base; my player\'s characters may as
   well have only 5 attributes.  It would be nice if T4.1 fixed this
   problem.

   Note that these two reasons do not depend on arguments based on
   canon or qualifications to be a doctor, but merely the laws of
   statisitics and supply-and-demand.

Pursuing an ED8 certificate increases your Edu to 8.
Going to an Academy will increase it to 9.
Going to Univeristy gets you an A.
Grad School gets you a B.
Honors gets you+1 Edu.

BUT, some educational institutions have prerequisites, and it spossible you
couldn\'t vene get admitted to some of them.

suggestion.

If you add a roll to the chargen system (a throw to see if a character
is awarded a skill for that year), you will not only be putting a limit
on the already too generous T4 chargen system, but you will also be
paving the way for the addition of advanced chargen rules for T4 down
the road.

I,and I\'m sure many others, really liked the advanced chargen methods
used in CT\'s Mercenary, Scouts,High Guard and the MT player\'s handbook. 
Rolling every year of a character\'s career (rolling
assignment,resolution,etc) is my preferred method for rolling up
Traveller characters.

If you plan to introduce advanced chargen for T4 down the road (and I
really hope you do), you might have a problem with the characters
generated with the advanced method being inferior to the characters
created with the T4 basic system.  The reason:  In basic chargen, you
are awarded one skill per year automatically whereas in advanced
chargen, you will have to roll that year to get a skill.

One of the problems in CT and MT, when using the advanced chargen
systems, is that the advanced characters were so much more powerful than
the basic charcters.  In T4, if advanced chargen is introduced, we\'re
going to have the same problem--except in reverse.  Basic system
characters will be much more powerful than advanced system characters.

As I stated above, I would really like to see the option of advanced
character generation in T4, but I think that, if introduced, it
shouldn\'t matter which system you use (advanced or basic) because
characters should come out the same in both systems.

If you add a roll per year for a skill in the basic chargen system for
T4.1, you\'ll get similiar results.  Advanced chargen shouldn\'t mean that
a character comes out of chargen with more skills--it should mean that
the detail of career background is greater because you determine what
happens to a character each year.

Besides,like I said in my previous post,if you add a roll, this will
discourage skill levels from becoming too high (we don\'t need to see
level 8 and up skills from a character straight out of chargen).

But some of the options became too wimpy.The checklist details what has =

If I read this correctly, a PC from a Lo, Na, Po world would recieve 3
rolls on the World Skills tables, while a PC from a Hi, In world would
recieve 2.  Am I right?

Yes.

If you like your birthworld, you can keep it as a homeworld. If not, you can
decide to have a homeworld too.

Your homeworld is defined in the table by Starport and Trade Classifications
(you may want to search through FS to find a world that matches). You get one
homeworld skill for each trade classification your homeworld has. (ie. Your
homeworld is Industrial; roll 1D on the Industrial column). Which means that
someone from a Na world gets fewer homeworld skills than someone from a Na Va
Ast Ind world.

This looks good, I like the inclusion of Educational Certificate.. makes us

Injury inflicts up to 3 points (half die) on one characteristic. Recovery
inflicts from 0 to 3 points of recovery. If your injury still has 1 or more
points against you, you may muster out. If 3 points, you must muster out.

I agree that the current experience rule in T4 is completely broken. And that
the basic way to have experience is for a character to continue to add skills

that I prepared and filed away to use when ever players had questions. It is
done in the form of a lecture transcript from a Professor of advanced
Mathematics

For your enjoyment and commentary.

Good morning, class. My name is Stephano Davros. You may call me Professor
Davros. 

This class is Advanced Math: Jump Theory.  Today\'s session will be an
overview in which  I will be trying to separate the mathematical reality of
Jump Theory from the popular misconceptions.  Listen carefully, my
assistants will be conducting a test after the  lecture. Continued presence
in this  class will depend upon the results of that test. 


Jump \'space\' does not exist.  Exclude from your minds any concept of \'space\'
from jump theory. Failure to accomplish this will mean failure in this class. 

The classic model for space time is the culprit of this mis conception.
Image one, please. 

Note that the basic model presents space time as a surface on which various
objects are placed, their mass causing deformities in the surface: the
ubiquitous gravity \'well\'.  The depth of the well is considered proportional
the mass of the object. 

What are the flaws? First space time is not a \'surface\'. Surfaces imply
edges and sides, which space time does not have.  Secondly, all the
deformities are from the base line surface. Consider our star system.  In
the classic model,  the deformity in space time created by the primary is
separate from the deformities created by each planet, moon, comet, meteor,
ship, whatever.  Neatly separate and isolated.  And totally misleading.
Image two, please. See, to reflect the interaction of  the various masses,
we adjust the classic model by moving the \'wells\' created by the smaller
masses into the walls of the \'wells\' created by the larger masses.  This
gives us a closer, but not too close, of a approximation to reality since we
are still basing it on a surface.  Each mass, or more precisely, the effect
of the gravitational signature of each mass creates deformities in space
time. Deformities that extend in all directions from the mass, unlike what
is shown here.  If space time were a gelatin desert, each mass would be a
piece of fruit embed in the gelatin; each deforming the gelatin around it in
to varying degrees.

Image three, please.  Note here, in this artificially limited slice of space
time, colored a faint yellow for clarity only, that each mass, represented
the small dark dots, creates distortions in the yellow of space time,
represented by the faint reddish, translucent spheres surrounding them. Each
distortion sphere is of a progressively lighter shade to represent the
lessening intensity of the distortion effect. This model is as close as we
can come to the nature of the interaction of space time with mass. It is
woefully inadequate; but it is many fold better than the classic model used
popularly. 

The deformities overlap one another; the deformities created by smaller
masses would be contained within the deformities of the larger masses.
Photons of light do not have the mass to create any currently detectable
deformity of space time. However, they are bound within the deformities of
all masses. Therefore, they proceed over and under, up and down, around and
around the deformities, travelling large apparent distances from source to
destination. The interactions of the various deformities control the
apparent distance that is travelled by any object.  Your greatest challenge
in this class is going to be understanding that all of these relationships
are just that; relationships, and not physical existence. I can show you the
relationship as a mathematical formula; I can not show you the deformity of
space time that the formula represents. I can show you the effect of it;
like I can show you hundreds of examples of the PI relationship in circles;
but I can not pick up PI and hand it to you. 

This is a critical element in Jump theory.  Mass and it\'s corresponding
gravitational signature has an effect  on space time that creates
distortions therein. Some huge masses, like the proverbial \'black hole\'
create distortions that have useful effects. Under proper conditions a
collapsed stellar remnant of sufficient mass can distort space time
extensively, creating what is called a \'worm hole\' . In is not a \'hole\' as
you would find in a wall, but a specific distortion effect of space time
such that two apparently distant points in space time are connected. You
have not left space time. You are not outside of space time. You are not
under or over, sub or hyper,  space time. You can not use a sheet of paper
to create a model of it., as you can with the Mobius strip. You can not
create any image of the distortion that is visually perceivable to the eye.
You can conceive of it in your mind, you can create a mathematical model of
it; you just can\'t see it. You want to understand Jump theory; leave your
eyes behind.  The distortion effect of the mass\'s gravitational signature
has twisted the space time so that the two points are now in a different
relationship to each other than they are to other points.  When you
understand the math behind this cumbersome verbal statement; you will be at
the point of most pre-stellar civilizations that are dreaming of the stars. 

Given you do achieve that understanding; what is the next step to creating a
jump drive? Yes? A means to control mass and the gravitational signature?
Good. You may have a chance to pass this class.  How do we perform this?
Lanthanum? Correct!

Lanthanum has a  rare, naturally occurring, property. The property that,
when stimulated by large amounts of energy, will alter it\'s gravitational
signature. 

You can not have gravitic technology without Lanthanum. Your air raft, your
lift belt, our floating cities; even our jump drives all rely on Lanthanum.
Every race that has independently developed jump drives has had large,
naturally occurring deposits of Lanthanum within reach, either on their home
world or within their home star system.  

Like the aforementioned \'wormhole\'; controlled stimulation of a set of nodes
made from Lanthanum by sufficient energy can create an artificial
gravitational signature enabling the distortion of space time that connects
two apparently distant points.  The math representing this is . . .
challenging. The actual computations are beyond an organic brain; computers
are a prerequisite.  Applying the energy to the nodes in the correct
sequence and degree is an extremely precise process. 

The artificial gravitational signature created has a duration of 168 hours.
No more, no less. The distortion effect lasts for 168 hours. When this has
elapsed; the vessel that was at point A in space time is now at point B in
space time.  Much like in one instant your finger is on the apparent
interior of the Mobius strip, the next it is on the apparent exterior,
without having left contact with the surface or crossed an edge. Did the
ship  traverse something in between? No. Did it leave space time? No. It
existed within the distortion of space time; which, while not  visible, that
is, not penetratable by light or electromagnetic waves, to those not subject
to the same distortion effect, was still within space time. During the
existence of the distortion; space time was twisted such that point A and
Point B effectively overlapped. It takes 168 hours for the artificial
gravitational signature to induce this overlap.  Bending space time is not a
quick process.  When the artificial gravitational signature ceases to be
effective, the vessel is now at different point in space time than it was. 
 
Conservation of Energy? Energy was used to distort space time for a period
of time, and when the energy was no longer applied,  then space time
returned to it\'s undistorted state.  No violation of physics here. Did the
ship move? The ship\'s velocity is unchanged; neither gained or lost. Heading
or direction? Due to the distortion effect, these may be somewhat irrelevant
terms. The vessels heading is relative to the other masses in context of a
specific point in space time. By expending energy to distort space time we
can change the apparent direction with the distortion, as long as the
vessel\'s velocity does not change.  Remember the Mobius strip? In traversing
the surface thereof you do not take any action to change the side you are
on, yet you end up moving from apparent interior to apparent exterior. If
you do not have enough velocity to retain position  relative to your new
surroundings when the distortion effect terminates;  you will be drawn to
the nearest mass. If you have too much velocity, you will generally increase
your distance from the nearest mass depending on the relative direction you
are heading at termination.  Remember with a jump drive; you have expended
energy on SPACE TIME, not on the vessel.  

I see this concept has confused some of you.  That is expected, given that I
am verbalizing the concept rather than demonstrating it mathematically.  
 
Beginning tomorrow we will be leaving verbal descriptions behind and moving
into the math that represents these effects.  If you have questions that you
want a verbal answer for, ask now. After we have started the math, you will
only get answers in math. 

Yes?  Why 168 hours? Ah; why is it that no matter what size the circle, the
relationship between circumference and diameter is the same?  Why is it that
the square of the hypotenuse is always equal to the sum of the squares of
the other two sides in triangles? It is an observed effect. Research is
being done to try and define the why of  the matter.  Some rather advanced
theories seem to suggest that it is a matter of  how the nodes and
constructed and the degree of control in the stimulation thereof.  Given
this interpretation, properly configured Lanthanum nodes and energy
distribution network, would make shorter duration jumps with lesser energy;
but they will also be of shorter distance. You can not get two literes of
water in to a one liter pitcher, no matter how you design it or run the
water.  Of what value is a jump that lasts a few hours, uses only a few
liters of fuel, and barely gets you a single AU from initiation to
termination point? For intra system travel, thruster plates or Heplar
thrusters are much more cost and space efficient.  This will not be
discussed further in this class. If you pass and enter the next class, we
will touch on the subject towards the end.  A full exploration of this
subject is left for directed study projects, if anyone thinks they can find
a profitable use for these short jumps and can make a case for it.  

Yes? Parsecs for measuring jumps? Weren\'t you listening to my earlier
comments? Every mass creates a distortion effect. What is a parsec? Think.
Parallax Second? Good. What defines a Parallax Second? Taking an observation
of a stellar body from two points on diametrically opposing sides of another
stellar body.  Stellar bodies that create large space time distortions.
Why? For  measuring the APPARENT distance between the two distortion
enducing stellar masses.  When we get into the math, if you can keep up, you
will begin to see that the mathematical model of the distortion created by
the observer\'s stellar mass and the apparent distance to another stellar
mass have a major roles to play in the calculation of the overall space time
distortion between the two points and the energy requirement and application
pattern for the jump drive.

Next?  The 6 parsec jump limit?  Precision and Control. Each advance in
distance was related to better understanding of the math, better computers
to calculate the needed distortion effect and better means of controlling
the stimulation of the Lanthanum nodes and better means of construction the
of nodes.  The various stories of \'misjumps\', or more properly, minimally
controlled jumps, that have exceeded 6 parsecs demonstrates that is possible
to cover larger distance; we just have not developed the control TECHNIQUE
to match the THEORY. How far is the max? That is a good question. A common
corresponding question is short jumps and the \'zero\' jump.  Depending on the
precision of the calculations and the control, a jump is possible between
any two points definable within space time. As I said earlier, the upper
limit is currently set by TECHNIQUE, not by theory. At the other end, a
limit is imposed by the nature of gravity, Lanthanum and the mathematics. An
attempt at a zero jump was made some years ago, fortunately by an unmanned
automated scout ship.  Programmed to travel  to a point well outside of
possible interference by other masses, it was to calculate a distortion
effect where both initiation and termination points were identical and then
execute the jump.  It carried out this part successfully. The monitoring
ships noticed a residual gravitational anomaly at the initial jump point.
The anomaly intensified for a approximately 82 hours; then stabilized.  It
remains stable to this day. Subsequent  reanalysis of the jump program
transmitted by the scout prior to jump shows a possibility that the
artificial gravity signature would feed back upon itself creating a stable
distortion of space time, a \'black hole\' like effect.  The scout is
effectively eternally in a jump state.  What some have called a \'pocket
universe\'. The general rule for the shortest jumpable distance, derived from
the minimal safe jump distance from another mass, is the terminal point of a
jump must be at least 100 times the longest axis thru the center of mass of
the jumping ship. For our unfortunate scout, at 37.5 meters long, the
termination point should have been at least 3.75 kilometers from the
initiation point. 
 
Most races that developed jump drives did so initially to supplement the
early, poor performance, reaction based drives for orbit to orbit  jumps
within their own star systems.  In fact, the consistent element in the
records of each race is that the first jump was actually an accident
occurring in the testing a new designs for thruster plates, the operational
theory of which has many elements in common with jump theory.   

Yes? Going insane by looking into jump space?  Been sleeping? I said there
was no such thing as jump space.  The ship is inside the distortion effect
of the gravity signature.  Certain effects of the distortion have been
observed. The one that seems to create a problem for people is that,
visually within the bounds of human physical perceptions, the ship no longer
seems to have an apparent outside. Any aperture through which the
undistorted space time was formerly viewed is bent back upon itself. You
look out a window and see yourself looking back in through the same window.
Which one is the real you and which one is the \'distortion effect?\' Open an
air lock to go outside and you enter the ship, not leave it.  There is an
analog to the geometric construction called an Tesseract. I suggest you
review the material on that subject.  This phenomona has produced some
interesting events in relation to poorly controlled jump occurances.  While
most \'misjumps\' generally send the entire vessal to some unplanned point in
space time; a few have resulted in the distortion effect bisecting the
vessel generating it.  In these cases, the portion of the vessel left
outside the distortion effection was immediately laid open to vaccum. The
portion inside the distortion effect, because of the fold back phenomona,
actually had the open area laid back on itself, effectively sealing the
vessel until the distortion effect terminated.  Those inside the effect had
the duration of the jump to prepare themselves; enter life pods and or
vaccum suits, or seal off undamaged portions of the vessel, what ever. Very
rare occurance.    
 
Next?  Where does the fuel go? It is consumed, of course. Oh, you want a
reasonable response... Using a fusion power plant to run the regular systems
on a ship is the not the same as using a fusion power plant to power a jump
drive.  In normal operations, the power plant, like most any power plant
back to tech 6 or 7, actually generates power from waste heat. The contained
plasma releases energy that exits the magnetic bottle as heat, which
converts a coolant from liquid to high pressure gas used to drive an
generator which converts the physical  motion of a metal through a magnetic
field into electrical energy. Stable, generally cost effective depending on
how much power must be used to maintain the plasma. With a jump drive we are
distorting space time on a large scale. This requires power. Lots of power.
When a power plant is used to run a jump drive, fuel is fed into the
magnetic bottle where the electrons are stripped from he nuclei, releasing
energy and electrons. An electrical current is a flow of electrons  from one
atom to another.  For the jump drive, the released electrons are siphoned
out of the plasma and feed as current directly into the drive unit and from
there to the Lanthanum nodes. Huge quantities of electrons are needed to
create the current which, from the nodes becomes the artificial
gravitational signature. Even the nuclei, as they fuse, release electrons
that are also siphoned off to create current. 

This is one of the reasons that it is extremely dangerous for ships to jump
and then immediately jump again. After a jump, the power plant\'s plasma is
contaminated by huge quantities of  fusion by products commonly called heavy
nuclei. Part of the time spent between jumps is used to purge the plasma of
these heavy nuclei, generally outside the ship in deep space. 

Why is this a problem? For the same reason that unrefined fuel is a problem.
Pure hydrogen has an anticipatable quantity of electrons. Pure Hydrogen has
anticipatable number of nuclei fusing, releasing a knowable quantity of as
electrons to use in the Lanthanum stimulation.  Heavier elements either
release more electrons when injected into the plasma or pull electrons from
the plasma back into the atoms, depending on which element is involved. As
heavy nuclei are created; it becomes more and more difficult for the fusion
process to continue. Fusing two hydrogen nuclei takes less energy than
fusing two helium nuclei;  more heavy nuclei; less fusion. Either condition
alters the flow of electrons to the grid; creating unplanned over
stimulation or under stimulations; altering the artificial gravity signature
from the jump plan.  Result: your termination point is not the one
calculated. We will explore various simulations of jump plans and how
changes of power inputs will affect them later in the class.  
        

Other questions?  No? Then your ready for the test.  I will be seeing some
of you tomorrow.

What I\'m trying to say is, yes, I know that T4 characters have more
skills than a character generated under CT.

This is a good thing.  CT characters were always generated with sparse
numbers of skills.  The T4 method is an improvement.

But, I\'m also saying that a side effect of the T4 system, which is
broken, is that some skills can reach the double digits in level.

The levels of skills should be kept the same.  Game mechanics throughout
the book, originally generated for CT, depend on it.

Give the T4 characters more skills than CT characters had--I\'m all for
this, but watch out that any one skill does not reach too high a level
(say, 5 or 6, because they should be rare).

And the problem with what you are saying is that there are CT game
mechanics in the T4 rule book that depend on skill values being the same
as they were in CT.  If you inflate the numbers of CT skills to match T4
skills as you say, then these rules (which are all over the main book)
are skewed greatly in one direction.  

That\'s just not viable.  T4 skills must be kept at the same value as CT
skills.  You can still improve T4 characters over CT ones by giving them
more actual skills,but you must still watch that each individual skill
does not get too high.

In other words, a level-3 skill in T4 is the same as a level-3 skill in
CT.  Exactly the same.

I KNEW that if I kept looking, I\'d find my old MA!  It came out in the late
1976 (I think the finished product went to the printers in August) for
$5.00 (prod. no. SF18-R).  It was, indeed, stand-alone (at least in name),
though it\'s obvious that James Ward, the designer, had a copy of D&D (the
original 3-book set) in his other hands (he was a mutie) while he wrote MA.
 The character sheet templates and game charts do appear on pp 29 - 32 of
the rules, but some of the explanations of how to do things presumed prior
D&D-ish knowledge... Looking through MA, I wound up pulling my old CT copy

The smaller ship is 25 times less massive than the station and is
rated at 5gs.  F=ma so F is 9.8e6 N.  The acceleration of the
station is 1.96m/s^2----0.2 gs.  The station will gain or lose a*t
m/s, so 1.96*1.5s = 2.94m/s.  Not a lot.

Nope. the orbit becomes very slightly eccentric.

If it\'s already docked little will happen to the airlock or grapple
IMO.

They\'ve gained/lost 10km/hr worth of delta v, reasonably hard if
they have no grav comp.  If the force comes along the right axis
they\'ll feel a bump, maybe a big bump.

Remember that their orbital velocity is on the order of 10km/second,
so the orbit won\'t change much at all.

As I understand it a match will go out because it is too small a flame
to drag fresh air to it.  A larger fire will & thus can be dangerous. 
If I understand correctly even a large fire could not spread quite as
rapidly as in gravity but the fact that it was using up the oxygen in
the air would serve to make it more deadly. It will burn out when it
runs out of oxygen but that will be too late for anyone who needs to
breathe.

But do we really need a Liason skill, it always seemed to me to be 1)
unfairly more powerfull than Admin or Streetwise since both skills
defaulted from it and 2) implausible, yes there is such a thing as
training in how to interact with people but I think that in Traveller
terms you should just get Admin or Streetwise whichever you are _really_
learning.  In addition T4 adds in Diplomacy which _is_ formal training
in how to interact with people.  When I converted charecters from
earlier editions of Traveller over to T4 I made Liason convert to
Diplomacy & it seemed to work well (I threw in Admin 0 and/or Streetwise
0 if they fit the charecter concept).

First of all the hauler will produce 200 * 5 = 1000 tons of thrust for 1.5
s. This will give the station an acceleration of 1000/(5000+200) Gs for 1.5
seconds.
The deltaV will be 9.81 * 1.5 * 1000/(5000+200) = 2.83 m/s.
This orbital speed decrease will be totally insufficient to alter the orbit
of the spacestation as it is SOO much less than the orbital speed.

1) The space stations orbital velocity is slightly reduced which should be
of no significance whatsoever.
2) If the airlock could t ake 1000 tons standing on it on a 1G planet for
1.5 s it will crumble. Causing some damage to the haulers nose as well as
the stations airlock. The stations stress taking capacity is hard to figure
as it doesn\'t have to take any stresses being orbital but as it will
regularly dock with ships the airlocks would probably be tougher.
3) The inhabitants of the station will be jolted slightly but will be able
to react as it will build for 1.5 seconds.

Space stations that regularly dock with ships will either enforce that
dockings are performed by station pilots (look up the word pilot to see the
original meaning) and/or have telscopic airlocks that can take the stress.
Airlocks on stations will probably be "tentacle" like that snake out to
dock with a stationary ship. Oh yes the cargo hauler pilot will lose his
papers and be grounded for a year whereafter he will be allowed reapply for
space duty. He will also be severely beaten by thugs hired by a wealthy
playboy who got bruised in the incident as he was practicing zero-G sex
when the incident happened.
The hauler pilots thinks that this is the final straw and joins a new
colonist program from one of the pocket empires out there. !4 years later
he (now a custom inspector pilot for the Zurrhon empire) happens upon the
playboy character and breaks his arm. End of story.

You have to remember that S.F. personnel are not your average \'grunt\';
they are highly specialist personnel. One of the selection criteria is
mental and emotional stability, and the military expends considerable
resources on maintaining their mental health (the last thing you want on
a critical mission is for somebody to go over the edge). They are not a
good example to use for the mental and emotional effects of prolonged
exposure to combat. Being self assured is no measure of a persons level
of empathy, self assurance mearly means you regard yourself well; it
doesn\'t neccessarily follow that you regard others well. There a quite a
number of very self assured criminals. (before anybody leaps on me,
most of the soldiers I have met are fairly good at empathy, given the team
nature of warfare, it\'s probably a neccessity).

However back to traveller. I have very rarely seen the effects of
traumatic stress adequately played. If your being shot at it does count
as a traumatic stituation; and the higher your exposure to traumatic
stress, the greater the liklyhood it will effect you. Traumatic stress will
mess people up but good (understatement). The most common response
tends to be some form of dissociation (mentally divorcing yourself from
the situation), which then carries on past the event. A quick skim of the
DSM-IV will give a good range of effects. In my games, players get
very concerned about the effects of combat on their emotional and
mental stability rather quickly.

Since there are no DM\'s noted, this breaks down
to roughly:

83% Human minor
14% Alien minor
 3% Alien major

Any particular reason for this?  There\'s only about
40 surviving Human Minor races in Imperial space
(and environs); which means about one, maybe two per 
sector. While that number could be tweaked
somewhat, and some H-minor races are spread over
several subsectors at least (e.g. Geonee, Suerrat),
it seems hard to justify that kind of statistical
predominance.

Maybe it\'s best it was left off.

Personally, I\'d switch the die rolls for Human
and Alien minor races, and give a boost in
importance to the Bwaps et al. of the universe. 

Optionally (which is already the case), GM\'s can
assign alien populations as they see fit.

MASSILIA SECTOR REVISION.
	Here I present the revised data for Massilia sector. 7 types of changes
have been made. Most of them have been discussed in previous mails. Changes
number 4),5),6, and 7) should probably also be necessary for all the sectors.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:

1) Incompatibility with previous Traveller products (Knightfall, TD11)
	(detailed write-ups are rendered false)
	Changes to UWPs of: 0228,1025,1508,1510,1808,2010,2109

4) Suppression of B Pop worlds:
	(Population makes universe absurd)

	(There are two system in the same hex: conserve the Knightfall one)
	Elimination of excess worlds at: 0720,2503,2506,2508
6) Incompatibility of Stellar Types with previous Traveller products
	(There are lots of V types from Knightfall changed to VI or IV in FS, 
	as in a scanning error)
	(Also, some D types are missing because they didn\'t fit: check length)

Hang on a minute.  You\'re right but you\'re missing the context of this
table.

If a world suitable for inclusion is inhabited there\'s a table to determine
the nature of the inhabitants.  *That* table (which requires you roll 3D or
2D depending on whether you are within the current Imperial border or
beyond it), indicates you roll on the Alien Race table on a 6 or less.

You only roll 1 die on this table.  (Only mentioned in the text, p.32)

The DM is in the text: +2 for "each whole subsector that the world is
distant from Sylea"

So aliens become more and more likely as you move away from Sylea.

You\'re partly right there, but only partly. People of such planets would,
indeed, _potentially_ have access to the high TL of their neighbor, but only 
if they 1) can afford to buy it, and 2) wants to buy it. The second part is 
a cultural thing, of course. They could be ultra-conservative, they could 
have religious or philosophical reasons to stick to lower levels, or
something. But the first part can be a problem too. Not only does the high-
tech goods (plus transportation) have to be cheaper than locally produced
goods, but they also have to produce something that they can sell to off-
worlders in sufficient quantities to get the money needed to buy the stuff. 

IMO most uninterdicted low- and medium- tech planets are low- and medium-
tech because of economic problems.

Sure, you can always send off to the high-tech neighbor for whatever you
want (provided you have the funds), but if the locals don\'t generally buy
it, the local shops don\'t stock it.

And a good number of them propably dosen\'t make any sort of sense. The 
necessary technology would have to be imported, and since that would make
said starport more expensive to run than one on a planet with the 
appropiate TL, such planets should be very rare, especially following a
period of retrenchment like the Long Night.

You\'re off by a factor 200 there. A RU is equivalent to MCrimp5,000,
not MCrimp1,000,000.

Marc Miller recently stated that the Credit originally was worth 1 US$.
From recent discussions on the net it appears that thanks to inflation
the Credit is edging into the $3 range.

That, or starports that shouldn\'t really be there.

You\'re assuming that the costs of A and B starports given in PE are 
reasonable. That\'s something I\'m not so sure of. Certainly the costs of
E and D starports are far too high. You\'d have to be a real financial
wizard to pay MCr6,000 for a flat piece of bedrock and a radio beacon
without getting done for embezzlement.

You can\'t. But then, I don\'t agree that the components have to be built in
situ. Nor that a starport capable of building, say, a couple of 200 T ships
per year HAS to affect the economy of the host planet significantly.

They *must* have TL 7 space technology available at the starport. I see no
reason why they *must* have TL 7 kitchen appliances available on the other
side of the planet.

>Remember, we are talking amounts of investment in infrastructure here 
>that would make the US Deficit look like a "piddling little amount"!

One major problem is that there are really two different _kinds_ of 
starports. One is the single, almost self-contained, little pimple on
the backside of a world built and maintained by foreign interests. The
other is the vast industrial complex capable of serviceing the trade
needs of a whole planetful of people.

I know that the \'Remarks\' section of the UPPs are beginning to get
overworked, but I\'ve been mulling over a proposal to distinguish between
them:

1) The default assumption is that a given starport represent starport
   capacity enough to serve the whole population of the planet.
2) When this is not the case, a code in the \'remarks\' section details
   the effective capacity of the starport. The code consists of the
   letter for the starport type followed by three numbers, the population
   level and the population code of the effective size and the TL of the
   starport. Thus a UPP like

		A356984-4	A61A

   would mean that the starport is the standard size to serve 1,000,000
   people and that the effective TL is 10.

In any case, the cost of a starport (above type E) should not be a flat fee
but should depend on the number of people (or, in PE terms, labor points)
on the planet.

This is true. You will not have a flame which distinguishes itself. Also

I love it! This fits into my perception of how jump should work. When I
asked the original question it was meant to help me in designing some
deck plans. The answer I am incorperating is to consider the j-drive
itself as being directly attached to the fusion bottle (re: your
discussion). Thank you for sharing this, it will be included in any
future games I play as a standard hand out.

Only if the Advanced CharGen system is exactly like the one from CT/MT.
Who\'s to say that IG won\'t make a new Advanced CharGen system that makes
the characters even *better* than the Basic T4 characters?

It would behoove them to make an Advanced CharGen system that makes
characters who are more _detailed_, not more powerful, however. More detail
could include awards and service medals, specific year-to-year assignments,
and specific special assignments, all a la CT rules.

This may be true in T4, but what if it wasn\'t true in T4.1? What if,
instead of a skill of 3 being good enough to be called a professional, it
required a skill of 7 or 8? Skill inflation? No, skill normalization. A
characteristic  of 7 or 8 is average and we don\'t think characteristics are
inflated, they just work off a different scale. That\'s the problem with the
task system, really. When you add a characteristic and a skill level you
are adding together things of completely different scales. Characteristics
average about 8 and can vary by 5 or more points between individuals.
Skills average about 2 and a mere 2 points separate beginners and experts.
This means that when you add skills and characteristics together, like in
the task system, all the mean and variance come from characteristics;
skills have practically no effect on task rolls.

Now the KBv2 task system fixes this by multiplying the skill level;
normalizing it so it has around the same contributions of points and
variability as a characteristic. It works well for this, but what if skills
just had point totals and variabilities like characteristics right from the
start?

Exactly. If skills worked off the same scale as characteristics, adding
them together for tasks would work. Not only that, target numbers could be
based on skills or characteristics interchangeably. You could use either a
skill or characteristic as a DM. A lot of the tables for converting
characteristics to task DMs would be unnecessary because the characteristic
would be a DM.

What I am suggesting is that skill point totals be considered the same as
characteristic point totals; just as an \'average\' person might have a Str
of 7 and a weightlifter have one of 14, an \'average\' starship pilot would
have a Pilot skill of 7 and an ace have one of 14.

Not only will this fix the task problem, it is conceptually simpler because
a certain number of points will always mean the same thing, whether used as
a characteristic, skill, or DM.

True, because many of the the rules in T4 were taken directly from CT and
were not even edited to be consistent. The character generation, education
effects, skill ratings, task system, and experience rewards are all
seriously out of whack with each other. The book is already greatly
unbalanced, I suggest balancing it. Make 1 characteristic point = 1 skill
point = 1 DM = 1 experience point.

Now I realize this will require some changes, but nothing severe. A
"Doctor" will need a Medical skill of 8. The Tactics pool and Leadership DM
will apply equally to both sides, so the greater number of skill points
will not unbalance things. Instead of using skills as task DMs (like
Brawling for grapples) use opposed task rolls. Instead of skill levels
being added to tables (like Broker on the Actual Value table) give a DM for
skill minimums, like the character generation sequence already does. None
of these changes are new rules, they are just new uses of the existing
rules.

I think the T4 chargen system is too stingy, not too generous. Coming out
of chargen with a skill level of 10 should be no more unreasonable than
getting a Dex of 10. With more points for skills, there is potential for
relating skill increases to things like missions or training courses, so I
think this scheme would be even better suited to an advanced character
generation system. I have no quarrel with rolling to see if you get a
skill, but using this method it just isn\'t necessary. If you get, say, 3
skill points per year, an advanced character generation system could split
that into individual missions or projects.

Comments? Is this too radical a change? I thought it was similar to how TNE
skills worked, but I don\'t have that book. Are there serious problems I
haven\'t considered?

Well there aren\'t any good rules for vehicles.  I tried to convert
COACC planest into FFS, but there are too many differences in the
assumptions of fuel usage, power output and the like.  But most of the
time, my players don\'t really care about all the details, they just
want a plane and to know how fast it goes.  So I use the old Coacc designs.  

Weapons are another thing, I just don\'t use them, I really would like
to buy Emperor\'s Arsenal, but the weapons aren\'t in TNE format.  I
asked Greg Porter if it would be easy to convert them to TNE format.
Greg used Guns,GUns, GUns to develop the T4 guns, and G^3 has TNE rules
also, but he said you would have to reverse engineer the weapons, to
G^3 and then convert them to TNE, alot of work. 

Ships are another thing, I tend to use as is, TNE and MT use about hte
same amount of fuel to jump, so they aren\'t a bad approximation for
each other.  If I plan on using the ship extensivly, I\'ll just make up
a version of the ship with FFS, it is fairly simple, unless you are
converting a military ship, with lots of Fusion GUns, which don\'t exist in TNE.

   Whether the levels should or shouldn\'t be the same can be debated. 
   Effectively, however, they are not the same in the two games as
   published.  Inter-character competition is going to greatly influence
   which skill levels are normal in any given campaign.  T4 norms are
   much higher than CT norms, not `should be much higher\', but `/are/
   much higher\'.

   This is true for some cases, but is not generally true of the task
   rolls which dominate most games I play in.  For most task rolls that
   are not give-aways, a +1 mod doesn\'t amount to as big a change in
   probability in T4 as in CT.  (There are some exceptions for very high
   and very low probability tasks.)

   I\'m not saying what\'s viable, just what is.  And my campaign, using
   T4 rules with inflated task difficulties, is more viable than any CT
   campaign I\'ve ever run in the past as far as attracting players goes
   (though the task system has just about nothing to do with this.)

> In other words, a level-3 skill in T4 is the same as a level-3 skill in

   Except for the effects of inter-character competition and most task rolls,
   (where they are exactly different) what you say may be true.

I think that Liason is one of those old skills that is really
Traveller.  It\'s been around forever, and it has uses in many places.  I
still use it in my game.

Besides, Liason is integral to the Vargr.  They\'re so big into

True, this could be done.  I had to argue my point from what I know 
and what I\'ve seen.

The advanced chargen systems in CT/MT were great.  I really liked 
them.  They could be improved, just like I suppose everything could 
be, but they were pretty damn good just the way they are.

I\'d be completely happy with them being placed into T4 as is.

> It would behoove them to make an Advanced CharGen system that makes

Since I made this same argument in the post you quoted from, we are 
in total agreement here.

 More detail

> and specific special assignments, all a la CT rules.

Exactly.  But they must take care to make sure that characters, 
whether generated via basic or advanced character generation, are 
interchangable.

Otherwise, we\'ll end up with a situation like we had in CT/MT.  I 
really liked advanced chargen rules and want to use them, but those 
characters were much too powerful when complared to basic gen 
characters.

So what do you do?  You\'ve got a few careers that offer an advanced 
system that you really like, and you\'ve got a bunch of careers that 
use a basic system--but the two systems don\'t produce similiar 
results.

I\'d like to see T4 re-introduce advanced chargen AND make it fit with 
the basic chargen system we already have.

 Hmmm... maybe not "get out of hand" - maybe this kind of thing
 leads to the +/- 10% in a standard jump, and if the matching
 error is maybe 2.989994e8m/s vs. 2.997..., you start getting
 misjumps - the poorer the match, the more severe the misjump
 (with a mismatch of maybe 5% difference in some specified
 constant resulting in a "destroyed" mishap from the POV of
 someone not in the ship - i.e., the ship is never seen again.
 Destroyed?  Or gated to a universe with which the bubble is
 more closely matched?  Hmmmm...).

Yes, but both games were based on CT--not MT based on CT and T4 based 
on MT.

CT is the source.  MT and T4 are sisters, based on the parent, CT.

   It /is/ a radical change, but I personally love it!  It could
   potentially make things alot simpler.

   Some details need to be worked out yet, though.  In T4, we add skill
   + attribute.  If we were to do that with RHv1 we\'d need to roll about
   4 dice to make a routine task difficulty.  That\'s a fair amount of
   dice.  Of course, we could always average the (skill + attribute)/2,
   or use min(skill, attribute) and roll two dice, or whatever.  What do
   you think would work best?

This is true and why the task system must be fixed--and why the level 
a skill can reach must be watched in chargen.

T4 chargen encourages skills to get to a higher point than the game 
mechanics were designed to handle.

If you have a roll, say the low berth roll where you get a +1 DM if 
you have a Medical-2 medic attending the low berther, it means two 
totally different things depending on the value skill levels have.

I\'m suggesting we watch the level of a skill--keep them between 1 and 
5 (but 6\'s or even 7\'s could happen once in a blue moon).  This is 
the CT values.

Since the roll above for low berths was designed for CT, we have no 
problem giving a +1 DM to someone with a Medical-2 skill.  

Now, if we go with skill levels that can reach easily into the double 
digits, we do have a problem with that roll listed above.

If T4 is very generous in its skill awards, then a Medical-2 in CT 
would equate to a Medical-4 in T4--and a Medical-1 in CT would equate 
to a Medical-2 in T4.

This means that just about everybody who even has Medical will 
benefit from that +1DM.  It is no longer a bonus for some--but a 
given for MANY.

How do we fix that inequity?  Well, we either (1) change all the CT 
rules in T4 to go with the new skill awards (this would be a load of 
work), and the low bert DM would be something like "+1DM if Medical-4 
or higher."

Or, (2), we can keep the skill awards as they were in CT and keep all 
of the CT game mechanics the same.

This second option seems much easier to implement to me.

The problem here is that the T4 chargen system is awarding skills as 
described in option one above while the game mechanics in the book 
are run under option two above.

I\'m saying, let\'s make it easy on ourselves and keep the CT skill 
level values.  That way, we don\'t have all those problems down the 
road with the CT rules that are used, word for word, in T4.

An easy way to do this is to put a skill roll in for each year of 
chargen to see if a character gets a skill.

This would still generated characters with many more skills than the 
CT basic method (1 skill per 4 years), but it would limit skills more 
than the current system does--keeping the level each skill will reach 
down and discourageing high level skills.

The result will be a character with several skills--with each skill 
ranging from 1-6.

Awarding skills automatically for every year encourages skills to 
reach the double digits--unbalancing the game in other areas (see my 
low berth example).

Bottom line is, if T4 is going to use CT game mechanics, then CT 
skill level values must also be used.

I\'ll make a leap of faith here and predict that the game mechanics in 
T4.1 won\'t be that much different than they were in T4.

I don\'t think Marc is going through the whole book changing all of 
those CT era throws.  Given this, T4 skills are still equivalent to 
CT/MT skills--a level 3 is still considered professional.


 That\'s the problem with the

Exactly.  That\'s basically all I did in KBv2.0 to fix it too.  I 
multiplied the skill level by a factor to make it equivalent with the 
scale attributes are rated on.

Characteristics
> average about 8

Actually, a 7 is considered average for a normal human.  Traveller 
characters may average higher due to DMs in chargen, but they\'re 
supposed to be the cream of the crop.

Then I\'d abolish KBv2.0 because T4 would not be broken at that point.

Which is fine.  I\'m all for it.  But, T4 would become a new game if 
you did this.  I\'m not sure you are realizing what you are saying.

Right now, T4 is CT with a few tweaks.  Many of the same rules and 
throws apply.  If you made a change in the skill level value, you\'d 
have to go through the whole book and fix multiple CT rules that use 
the old skill values.

T4 would become more like TNE rather than CT, and it wouldn\'t be as 
interchangeable as it is right now with CT (or, to a lesser extent, 
MT).

That\'s a pretty big change for T4 to go through at this point.  If 
they were going to do that, they should have done it before T4 was 
released.

Yes, it fixes that task problem nicely, but it also creates a whole 
host of new problems with a multitude of existing T4 (CT based) game 
mechanics.

It is a much better solution to just change the task system--like 
KBv2.0 does.

Again.  Great idea.  I would be for that.  But, what you are talking 
about is a complete overhaul of the existing T4 rule book and game 
philosophy.  No longer would the game be based on CT.

I\'m not sure Marc is prepared to do that.  And, one of the neat 
allures to T4 is Traveller\'s fall back to its roots in CT.  I 
actually like the CT influence.

> Now I realize this will require some changes, but nothing severe.

Are you kidding me?  The whole book would have to be changed.  
Multitudes of throws, based on CT skill values, would have to be 
re-worked.

If this was done, T4 would definitely be a new animal--it would be 
T5.

Don\'t forget the scale difference between skills and attributes.  
With the system you are proposing above, I\'d be in total agreement 
with you here.  But, with the normal, average human, his attribute is 
considered to be 7 and his skill is considered to be 2 (as you cited 
above).  If that person comes out of chargen with a level 10 Dex and 
a level 10 skill, your skill will way out balance the attribute in 
various task throws and other types of throws.

My notes are above.  Too radical a change?  It\'s definietly a good 
idea, but I don\'t think its a good choice for Traveller at this stage 
of the game.

We have already been given a beefed up version of CT.  The best way 
to fix the problem of the inequity between skills and attributes is 
to change the task system to something like KBv2.0 and leave 
everything else the way it is.

Otherwise, you\'ve got a heck of a lot more work and an entirely new 
game.

I think they could use a slight boost in the number of skills awarded, but
you\'re right that they were great. I was so dissappointed that TNE\'s system
did not allow you to generate the level of detail available in CT/MT.

Yes. In the CT days, either _everybody_ was advanced or _everybody_ was
basic. Of course, after we started generating advanced characters, *no one*
would go back to the basic system! <g>

Richard, the effect is more or less what Ken is doing with his
KB2.0...though he might not admit it.  ;-> I\'m all for dropping
references to the number of times a skill has been rolled in character
generation, and instead use whole or partial target numbers.

There certainly are potential problems with increasing skill points to
the same scale as attributes.  The most obvious, to me, are the changes
in the task system it requires.  In T4.1 (as Marc has described it)
an average (7) professional (3), rolls against 10 giving a 50-50 chance
on difficult (3d6) tasks...or is that Formidable tasks..., anyway it\'s
probably a little tougher than most of us would like.  If you triple the
skill contribution, by any means, you get 16 giving odds on a 3d6 task of 
98%...that\'s probably a *lot* easier than most of us would like.

My compromise suggestion is 2 points per year, effectively doubling the
average points per skill.  Using this scale you\'d get something like:

Points
  1-2  Student
  3-5  Journeyman
  6-8  Professional
  9-11 Master
 12-14 Legendary Masters

An average professional would be 7+7 and have a 91% chance on a 3d6
task. 

Of course, *I\'m* using something else!  ;-> A mixture of FUDGE,
Traveller, and my own ideas that allow the use of either a FUDGE-like
task resolution or a T4-like one (but with a more difficult scale on
tasks).  Attributes still average around 8 points, like in Traveller, but
skill contibutes from 2 to 3 times as much to the target number.  The
target number (Skill+Attribute) in the table below is the level where
the PC would have an above average, but not sure, chance of success at
the corresponding Task level.

                                 Skill Level         
       Task Level   Skill Level   (Skill +
 Dice  Description  Description  Attribute)
 ==========================================
  1d6  Automatic    Terrible       3-5
  2d6  Simple       Poor           6-9
  3d6  Average      Mediocre      10-13
  4d6  Difficult    Fair          14-17
  5d6  Formidable   Good          18-21
  6d6  Staggering   Excellent     22-25
  7d6  Hopeless     Superb        26-29

...and Impossible *is* 9 or 10d6..or just plain impossible! <g> Any
character that can consistently succeed with target numbers of 30 or
above has a *truely* Legendary skill.

So, actually 3 (or more) points per year *works* for me, and if we could
convince Marc to use the above task scale and increased points I\'d be
*most* pleased!  ;->

Oh, and yes, I\'m sure both of our ideas are too radical for TPTB to even
consider.

	If Marc\'s new chargen system is possibly going to take note of the
birthworld and homeworld trade classification, how about extending it to a
player character\'s personal history? Or maybe even combine parts of the UWP
too?

	So, we could have some tables with DM\'s for ranges of parts of the UWP and
different trade classifications, and each result could be something to do
with this.

	For example, if the UWP and trade class shows a breathable atmosphere, at
least 20% land, low pop, ag, how about one particular result saying that
the character did something worthwhile in his life to do with farming?

	Again, if it shows hi pop, good tech level, industrial, and one result on
a table could show that a character once wrote a particularly good program
for controlling nuclear or fusion or whatever reactors, say.

	Other tables could gives results for personal experiences, like an ice
world could have a result somewhere of \'helped rescue some stranded
explorers\', and another one for personal relationships, and yet another
again for other things one encounters in life etc.

	Another possibility could be that another table could be rolled on if a
character reaches a high skill level at something; pistol-4 could gain a
certificate from the local gun club; acting-5 could make you a very famous
actor!

	And can we extend this to the character\'s six primary characteristics too?
If STR, END and DEX are 11 or more, the character could make a roll that
says he once won a medal at some sport.

	Bear in mind that I\'m just scratching the surface of this idea, and my
apologies if the idea has been mooted before. I never saw what I guess we
could call T2 and T3, being a CT and T4-type chap!

	Some of this may be unworkable, fair enough, but does anyone think that
there could be anything in all of this?

	It is fun designing personal history, but if some reasonably extensive
tables could be produced, it would make it far easier to knock up a new
character if one just has a limited amount of time, or is stuck for ideas etc.

	Big example...(obviously needs tweaking, but displayed entirely to show
what I mean here...)

	"If your character comes from a barren world, roll two dice; on 11 or
more, consult the table below by rolling two more dice. If the result is
inconsistent with any of the world\'s characteristics, ignore roll and
continue with main character generation."

	2 Character discovered unusual rock formations.
	3 Character attended meeting with planet\'s leaders.
	4 Character helped build local aquaduct system.
	5 Character nearly died of heatstroke when 2D+2 years old (if relevant to
planet\'s atmosphere)
	6 Character learned to drive particularly well here; +1 to any vehicle skill.
	7 Character spent six days lost during trip (define nature of trip
specific to world UWP)
	8 Character lived in part of planet with bad weather; now hates any storms.
	9 Character nearly died of exposure when 2D+2 years old (if relevant to
planet\'s atmosphere)
	10 Character lost friends (1-3) or relatives (4-6) in natural disaster.
	11 Character discovered new plant form.
	12 Character discovered way of making local vacc suit design last 10%

I don\'t use the T4 task system, so I thought you all might like
a salient point from an unbaised observer.

I number of people have compared the fact that the stat levels
are bigger numbers than skills and have concluded that this
means that they have a bigger effect.  This is a false conclusion.
What is important is the range.  If you have skills from 0-6
and stats from 100-106 the stats are no more important than
the skill.  Both have a range of 6, you are just adding 100
to all the roles.  The system is identical to one where you
have skills and stats both from 0-6 and you roll against
100+skill+stat.

I is also true that if one range is on a bell curve, it
will be effectively less than the same range on a staight
progression.  The bell curve will mean that the odds of
getting very small or larger numbers makes them less
accessible.

Now in Traveller, the majority of players will have stats
in the range 5-8.  80.5% of the players will have stats in
the 4-10 range.  So stats ranges of 4 or less are common.
Ranges of more than 7 are rare.  I would say this correlates
well to skill ranges of 7 or so (ie skills from 0-6 because
we are counting from 0, not 1).

The only thing that I still don\'t understand is why Jump space takes a

drive took a week to jump 1 parsec and a jump-6 drive took a week to jump
6 parsecs, but through my understanding a jump-6 drive still takes a week
to jump 1 parsec.

The only solution that I have with that is based upon a theory that I read
in "the Physics of Star Trek" (I forget the name of the author). I also
heard this theory on "Future Fantastic". The theory was based on the
possibility that space is curved. If space is curved then you could take a
short cut form one point in space to another. The short cut would take the
form of a wormhole. It is like folding a peice of paper over and the
poking a whole through the sheets. A trip that would take a while when
travelling along the paper takes only a short time by going through the
hole.

My point is that it doesn\'t matter how far you travel, the length of the
wormhole will always be the same. The question of why no higher than
Jump-6 is then raised. The only answer that I have for that is that the
energy usage in prohibitive.

This may go against Traveller Canon a bit, but then I\'ve never stuck
firmly to any game rules.

Air/rafts can achieve orbit. Remember, though, that they are grav
vehicles. This means that they must have a decent sized gravity well
against which to push. So they can\'t operate in deep space.

My PC\'s tend to pull up alongside and use a cable fired from a

    I\'ve reading this, waiting for someone with a knowledge of fire to say it,
but since no one has... ;)

    To exist a Fire needs three elements at the same time...

       Oxygen
       /   \\
    Fuel - Heat

    The triangle is deliberate, without anyone of those elements the the fire
stops.  Note I said stops, not extinguished. ;) The infamous "Backdraft" of
movie fame comes from when you close a room and deprive the fire of oxygen but
not the other two elements.  With heat and fuel available the fire waits, thus
when you open a door or window, giving the fire oxygen, combustion kicks back
in and it roars back to life.  This is all part of the charm of what make Fire
seem to be alive BTW.

    Now in space you have the natural ability to deprive Fire of one of the
elements it needs.  The ambient tempature of the universe at large is what?
Around 3 Kelvin if memory serves?  Starve the Fire of Heat and it stops.  Once
that\'s done you can go in and figure out what has been in combustion and stop
that cold and the fire is gone.  It\'s that simple and that complex. ;)

but then that was always a more visual show then anything else. ;)

The tables define a way to do things without racing forward into world
generation, which was, I think, a problem with the old homeworld system. 

The Homeworld Birthworld tables do two things: they assign a specific set of
Trade classifications as a result of die rolls, and they tell what each TC
can produce as a homeworld skill.

A player can substitute selecting a world from a list instead. And the book
will have a Core sector map, and list of UWPs in the back.

	Air/Rafts in all versions of Traveller have been able to achieve low
orbit. Under MT and T4, however, the anti-gravity/contra-gravity propulsion
used loses efficiency quite rapidly as you rise up out of a gravity well.
By about 10 diameters they\'re effectively worthless. So Air/Rafts and other
Grav vehicles aren\'t that great at inter-ship transfers in deep space, only
in low planetary orbits.

	The True Answer for this: That\'s how Marc Miller, et. al. wanted Jump to
work when they originally created Traveller. It provided interesting
limitations on travel, trade and communications, and has driven the nature
of the entire Imperium background that\'s grown up since then...

	FWIW, I tend to just go with "that\'s how long it takes the jump bubble to
decay" theory...

	I\'d possibly compare it to a construction hanger for 747\'s, or the
construction hangar for the space shuttle. Orbital contruction hangers
probably wouldn\'t need to be entirely enclosed, but ground based ones
would, unless on an airless world. Just think of the surrounding space
requried when building space shuttles and 747\'s and figure on how much
space is needed for shifting QSDS and SSDS modules about without the risk
of them bumping into anything.

Here is the deal, guys..

Follow me through this thought. The barrel is supposed to be shorter the
higer the TL so if you think the above table is valid,, think this:

Barrellength = (Velocity / 100) * TL modifier

It\'s so simple.

First compute velocity times hundred. Then take the result and divide it
with the modifier. I used a velocity of 4000 in the example below.

<BL  = (Vel    /100)    *TLm>     <TL
 ----
 64	4000	  100	    1,6       10
 52	4000	  100      1,3       11
 40	4000	  100	    1         12
 32	4000	  100	    0,8       13
 24	4000	  100	    0,6       14
 16	4000	  100	    0,4       16
 ----

So, for a TL: 13 Gaus rifle, the barrel is 32 centimeter.

Something that has my curiosity piqued here, how many people
play with the minor races as common parts of their campaigns? This
posting got me to thinking about what kinds of adventures I run on
a usual basis, and I realized that minor alien sentients rarely crop up
on a routine basis. If my players land at a starport, they get the usual
background "You see the usual assortment of shapes, sizes, and colors
from all over the Imperium," but they never seem to ask for anything
further and I rarely seem to flesh out anything more. 90% of my games
involve the Major races as NPCs and PCs, with the token alien thrown
in for color occasionally, or in that remaining 10% where a minor
race will be thrown in as the ally/enemy/obstacle in whatever quest
they happen to be on. Not exactly Mos Eisley Spaceport.

I think this is also why, although I really liked Alien Archive, it is also
the least used of my Traveller books; even First Survey gets opened
more because I need the maps.

So hands up, folks. How do y\'all use minor aliens in your games and
what impact have they had on the way you and your players game?

From Professor Davros:
Yes, power is required in larger amounts, but so is the need for precision &
control in the application of that power. Overpowering a jump drive unit is
a classic event in misjumps. With out the increase in precision of
termination point co ordinate calculations and the increase in control over
the application of the energy, you tend to randomly terminate from jump.
This three part  relationship is one reason why increases in effective
jumpable distances usually coincide in increases in tech level.

Well, my original idea was to roll huge handfuls of dice (I love doing
that), but after trying out a few task rolls using this method I found the
probabilities clustered too heavily around the average roll.  The effect
was that characters with high target numbers would automatically succeed at
everything but the most absurd number of dice, and characters with low
target numbers had no hope of succeeding even easy tasks. Not good. Using
(skill + attribute)/2 would fix this, but remembering the posts against
KBv1.1 I don\'t think anything requiring division is going to fly.

Well, I don\'t think there would be all that many; the task and experience
systems, but they will have to be fixed anyway; table DMs would have to be
replaced by skill breakpoints (eg. +2 DM for Broker 8+ instead of +Broker
DM), and opposed task rolls instead of using skill as a DM.

However, on the larger question I think you are right; it\'s a little late
in the process to be making such a significant change to the fundamental
game mechanics. I had thought this system would be similar to TNE and
therefore be able to leverage off TNE\'s mechanics and adventures. However,
there seems a much greater base of support for CT than TNE (I would include
myself in this generalization).

>Again.  Great idea.  I would be for that.  But, what you are talking

Aye, there\'s the rub. One of the advantages of T4 is that it is similar
enough to CT to be able to pull out old GDW adventures and JTAS articles
and use them on a new generation of characters. There\'s something very
satisfying about being able to integrate 20-year old adventures with the
newest set of rules. And a lot of those old adventures were pretty good, I
wouldn\'t want to make them obsolete when there are ways of fixing the rules
which keeps them compatible.

Is the chargen sequence only appropriate for exceptional characters or is
it representative of typical citizens? Some things, like getting your own
scout ship to joyride in and learning powerful psionic abilities, seem
vastly more likely from the rules than you would expect from the campaign
background. On the other hand, I have had a lot of characters generated
with this sequence who are more like the chaff of the crop. If it really is
only for exceptional characters there should be guidelines for making truly
average characters.

I would have to agree. Whatever the merits of making all points run off the
same scale, it would require more than T5; it would require going back in
time and revising all the books IG has already released. And while I
wouldn\'t mind seeing some books revised, I realize IG is not going to make
money doing this unless the revised books have new content people are
willing to pay for. IMHO changing the allocation of points isn\'t enough.

My \'suggestion\' was more for a house rule than to really suggest IG use it
in T4.1. In fact, I don\'t think I\'ll use this rule myself; it would require
too much effort. I guess I\'m just not a heretic - I\'ll use the published
rules unless they actually harm enjoyment of the game. Besides, my players
would lynch me if I changed the task system again... Looks like I\'m stuck
with KBv2!

The effect is similar, only Kenneth was able to do it by making 2 simple,
specific changes only to the task sytem and keep the results compatible
with all the published rules. My change would require rewriting practically
every book IG has published; I am not saying that would be a bad thing,
it\'s just unlikely to happen.

Unfortunately, as Kenneth also pointed out, you have to keep track of "the
number of times a skill has been rolled in character generation" to use as
DMs in a lot of cases. Sigh.

Before you ask, no I can\'t post them to a web page somewhere, at

spreadsheet that I used to test most of PE\'s economic systems, which 
I unfortunately deleted in a fit of temporary insanity.  I may 
eventually put something together workable enough to let somebody 
post it, but I\'m not comfortable with what I have so far.  

In the e-mail, please let me know what word processor and or

role-playing is what you are looking for, this is NOT the game for 
you.  The game will run one turn per week, but I promise that one 
turn will be entertaining and interesting for you.

I plan on adding some wrinkles I\'ve been toying with since I worked 
on the manuscript, and may be using you as guinea pigs for a set of 
simultaneous movement/hidden movement variants that I might 
eventually try to get published.  In addition, I may be 
running/testing some variant rules.

If you are interested in being a guinea pig for said rules, and want 
to play in a PBEM game run by one of the designers of PE, please 
e-mail me.  Slots for this game will be strictly limited, so get in 
your requests early.  This game will run 1 turn per week, and will 
begin in late July.  Only the serious (and discreet) need apply.

Y\'know, I\'ve answered this question several times, and one thought occurs 
to me.

Why do people always have a problem with this?

There are many natural physical processes which have a fixed time do 
matter the energy put in. Why should travel time be dependent upon the 
distance jumped? Jump number does not correspond to "speed" or 
"acceleration" or "power". There\'s no reason to have a relationship 
between distance jumped, or jump drive number and time in jump.

Imagine the havoc such a situation would have upon economics in the 
Traveller Universe. Say, there\'s a string of three worlds on a "main", 
each 1 parsec apart. You have a J-1 Free Trader, I have a J-3. If the J-3 
could jump 1 parsec in 1/3 week, I could traverse the route in 1 week 
(plus time at each world), stopping at each to trade.

It would take you 3 weeks travel time. I traverse the route 3 times for 
every 1 time you do, making 3x the profit! How long would Free Traders 
stay in business in this universe? Not very long, indeed.

In the Traveller Universe, I take just as long as you do in your "slow" 
Free Trader to traverse the route, stopping at each world. The advantage 
I have, is that if the first and last world in the chain generate more 
trade, I can skip the middle world and ply the richer route. But the 
middle world still needs trade, so I\'m not driving you out of business.

That\'s the advantage of the fixed jump time system, it creates greater 
diversity in the universe, more economic/ecological "niches" if you will. 
Free traders can still do business alongside their higher jump bretheren.

If you *must* have some rationale for the 1 week jump time, you can use 
one of the following analogies:

a) Trajectory model: If you shoot a projectile from a cannon at constant 
velocity, it takes the same amount of time to hit the ground, no matter 
the distance travelled. Jumpspace works the same way, each level of 
jumpspace is analagous to the "angle" of the cannon.

b) Jumpspace bubble decay: The jumpspace bubble is created by the 
jumpdrive pumping energy through a lanthanum grid. The bubble of exotic 
particles is what keeps the starship within jumpspace. The reaction 
within the grid must run its course once started. The crew of the ship 
monitor the decay of the reaction, and manage it the best they can. It 
takes 1 week +/- 10% for the reaction to run its course. At that point 
the jump bubble dissipates, and the starship "precipitates" into normal 
space.

took a number from Earth and scattered them across the galaxy (or charted

In our campaign & in starlink we use the following standard for shipyard
component of starports:
All published minimums for maintenance time pertain; a pop-5 world, if it
had a type A starport would be a type A5; if it failed to qualify, it would
be a type B5 or lesser A rating; except under extremely weird conditions, a
shipyards designator will never exceed its POP number (all the planetary
population are starport personnel, obtaining all their supplies from nearby
ag and ind worlds, Depots, etc.)
Type A1=Capable of making jump repairs on 100-ton Starships; basically,
There is a Jump-Engineer-1 or 2 on call or available, with adequate tools
to effect repairs. Instead of a hanger, a type A1 starport will have a
mobile jump-repair shop (3m x 3m x 6m, .5Mcr, 2t) and sufficient "spares"
(including entire modular J-drive units). Such a facility would have spares
adequate to its minimum task: if the only access to the world was via J-2,
J-2 spares would be available; if J-6, J-6 spares, etc. A type A1 shipyard
will take 21 man/hours per displacement ton of systems to be repaired, 
with average engineer level making a percentage reduction in time (Avgeng-2
= 21 *.8)

Type A2=No major change from a type A1 shipyard; possibly, would contain
spare J-drives 1 class better than the minimum required for a 100-t ship,
If access is J-2 would contain J-3 spares, etc. There is a Engineer-3
available, and 1d6+1 additional support personel. A type A1 shipyard will
take 21 man/hours per displacement ton of systems to be repaired, with
average engineer level making a percentage reduction in time (Avgeng-2 = 21
*.8). The mobile Jump-repair shop as in type A1 is used.

Type A3=Once again, no major changes; Would contain spares and replacements
2 classes better than the minimum neccesary to repair a 100-ton ship. There
is a Engineer-3 available, and 1d6+2 additional support personnel. A type
A3 shipyard will take 21 man/hours per displacement ton of systems to be
repaired, with average engineer level making a percentage reduction in time
(Avgeng-2 = 21 *.8).

Type A4=May perform repairs on starships up to 500-tons. Would contain
spare and replacements for J-drives equivalent to its technology limit or
minimum J requirement, whichever is greater.A type A4 shipyard will take 21
man/hours per displacement ton of systems to be repaired, with average
engineer level making a percentage reduction in time (Avgeng-2 = 21 *.8).
If groundside, Will have a 10,500 cubic meter repair hanger, 5.42Mcr; If
orbital, will be 540 cubic meters (clamps, ports, etc) and cost 5Mcr. A
type A1 shipyard will take 21 man/hours per displacement ton of systems to
be repaired, with average engineer level making a percentage reduction in
time (Avgeng-2 = 21 *.8). There is a Engineer 3/4 available, 1d6 Engineer
2/3, and 2d6+2 additional support personel. At no time can a A4 starport
repair a system that is over 10 displacement tons in itself.

Type A5=May perform repairs on starships up to 5000-tons. May construct
starships of 100 tons. Would contain spares and replacements for J-drives
equivilent to its technology limit or minimum J-requirement, whichever is
the greater, plus 1. A type A5 shipyard will take 17.6 man/hours per
displacement ton of systems to be repaired, with average engineer level
making a percentage reduction in time (Avgeng-2 = 21 *.8). If groundside,
Will have a 105,000 cubic meter repair hanger, 51Mcr; If orbital, will be
5400 cubic meters (clamps, ports, etc) and cost 50Mcr There is a Engineer
3/4 available, 1d6+1 Engineer 2/3, and 3d6+1 additional support personel.
At no time can a A5 starport repair a system that is over 100 displacement
tons in itself.

This is just something we through together to make the starlink game more
playable; If someone see\'s any holes in it or see\'s a need for any major
changes, feel free to modify.

I would appreciate it if you posted any perceived necesary changes to
http://www.10mb.com/tntsrv/folder/forum.htm
(and yes, I know my spelling sucks, but Outlook express does not have a
spell checker that works yet.)

I firmly think that the rating system for starports MUST change. It is
ridiculous to suppose that a pop 1 or 2 world would be capable of suppling
the resources, manpower & support to perform repairs on a military cruiser
or similar sized vessel.

You know, I\'ve come across the same problem when running Traveller.
What I think the game needs is a sort of "monster manual" with just
a page on each minor race along with a picture. That would go a
long way toward giving the GM some easily-digestable races to work
with.

Perhaps we should start working on such a book ourselves, just as a
net-project. I know that various TMLers have already written-up a
few minor races for their campaigns. I\'m going to sniff around and
see if I can\'t locate these in my archives. In the meantime, if
anyone else has any they would like to add, please post \'em to the
list or send \'em to me via email.

Also, it may be useful to come up with a generic format. Anybody
have any ideas?

And are there any artists out there that would be willing to
illustrate some of these? :-)

Incidentally, the next version of "Galactic" is almost finished.
Will be making it available, hopefully within the next few days.

That\'s the general rule, so you have to decide on the way Regina differs
from the general (so to speak). One is to say that Regina\'s space technology
is higher than its common TL. There are problems with that, since TLs are,
to some degree, interrelated. Or you can redefine the TL of the Kinunirs,
saying that they are not really TL 15 (except for the special experimental
computer which must, in that case, be imported (from Efate?)). There are
problems there, too, since Regina\'s TL isn\'t even big enough to build the
jump-4 engines.

IIRC Regina\'s TL is 12 (it was 10 in the earliest books, but was changed to
12 fairly quickly). I suggest that you use a combination of the two: Regina\'s
Space TL is 13, one higher than its common TL  --  not implausible  --  and
the Kinunirs are built at TL 13, with some special imported TL 15 parts.

>Also, can a TL12 world really perform the annual maintenance on a TL13+ ship?

Yes and no. Any Class B and Class A starport can perform annual maintenance
(and the Class C\'s can, too, can\'t they?). If the planet the starport is on
is not of sufficient TL to provide the spare parts needed, then the parts
must be imported.

It is not a typo, although you seem to be figuring it incorrectly.  Read 
the text accompanying that portion of the rules, and ensure you are using 
the correct numbers for those variables (there are some tables 
associated, etc.).


Total Tax Rate = Base Tax Rate + [(LL + C)/100] + Disc. Tax Rate

Base Tax Rate is derived from a look-up table based on Gov\'t type.

If you have a Gov 8 word, your Base Tax Rate is .40. Say LL is 8 and 
Culture is 6.  8+6/100=.14.  .40+.14=.54.  So, Total Tax = .54, if not 
using and Discretionary Tax Rate.

So, your GB = GWP * Total Tax, or .54GWP.


For expenses:

Civilian Expenses = [(C + I + L)/100]*A*G*GB

C is 6, as described above, and LL is 8.  Let\'s say Infrastructure is 6.  
So the first part is (6 + 6 + 8)/100 = .2.  Let\'s say you succeed on the 
Administration Expense Roll, so A=1.0.  Again, Goverment Type is 8, so on 
the Governmental Expense Table we get 1.3.  Plugging the values in, we get:

.2*1*1.3*GB = .26GB

So, you still have .74GB left over for Military expenses.  After figuring 
those, what remains is what you can spend on Infrastructure and so on.

Hope this helps.

**** DESIGN GEEK MODE ON ****

This is not a typo.  You are reading the formula incorrectly.  

The formula lists civilian expenses as 
(C+I+L)/100 * A * G * GB

Where 
C=Culture
I=Infrastructure
L=World Law Level
A=Administrative Factor
G=Government type factor
and GB=Government Budget

Assuming World X has the following: 
Culture: 7
Infrastructure:6
Law: C (12)
Admin Factor will vary from .9 to 1.2, let\'s call it 1 for purposes 
of our discussion: 1
Government Type Factor comes off the table on the table labelled 
"Government Expense" on the same page as the "Planetary 
Development" factor.  For our purposes, we\'ll assume a government 
type of 8, which gives a base tax rate of 1.35

So, our formula yields the following:

(7+6+12)/100 * 1*1.35 * GB=
25/100*1*1.35*GB=
.25*1*1.35*GB=
.3375 * GB

This will yield a percentage of approximately 33% of whatever the 
government budget happens to be. 

The highest these scores can ever be is
(15+15+20)/100*1.2*1.4*GB=.84 * GB

This number, as a percentage of government budget, will ALWAYS yield 
a small surplus.  Of course, Military budget could actually cause a 
government to run a deficit quite easily, but that was a design 
decision, not a flaw.

 I hope this helps.

 Does that mean that a character who rolls a B on EDU is allowed to assume
 that he has already gone through Grad School? Or that he will be able to 
 breeze through it? There should be some interpretation of just what a
 \'natural\' EDU of B and C really means.

Edu and degrees are "decoupled." There are many people who have the knowledge
equivalent of a university degree or a masters or something, but because they
don\'t have degrees, they cannot work in academia, or get admitted to grad
school.

I know some people with that sort of knowledge but who cannot persevere in an
academic environment and so don\'t have the degree to reflect it.

I was tempted to make it possible for someone to get a degree but not the Edu
increase, but that was a bit too cynical.

I don\'t think this is cynical at all.  I know several people that 
skidded by with a C average and got their degree while I worked my 
butt off and received honors.

There are several areas where I think I got more out of school than 
they did.  I was working for an education, and they were working for 
a piece of paper--just doing enough to get it.

I think Edu increase should be variable, like it used to be--not 
absolute.  Something like a 1 D6-3 increase or a 1 D6 increase would 
be appropriate.

Besides, a character with a real low Edu that stumbles into college 
on a high roll will obtain much more benefit from going than the 
average guy who goes and is successful.

I vote for Edu increases to be a die roll with 0 as part of the 
result (1 D6-1?).

non-streamlined ship land to utilize the facilities of a ground based

Since A class ports have space borne facilities I think they are natural
to the construction of non-streamline ships as wellas their upkeep.
Class B ports are more geared for surface to space vehicles.
The only problem with this is that non-streamlined ship should fall
"ahead" of streamlined ships technology-wise? Maybe B class yards fall
in the realm of advanced ground to orbit vehicles, of a non starship

 And so on...

 While I like what this table represents, some of the numbers trouble me.
The above two examples are the first two lines of the table. According to
the key at the bottom of the table, the \'Std\' column is the remaining
volume in DTons after the \'Hull\' is built.  Do these little craft hulls
really take up half of their own available volume?
  These numbers make a little more sense if you assume (or are told) that
the drives are already in place in these hulls. They are "Standard" after
all, so buying a hull with Maneuver drives already installed to one of a few
market-preset standards is actually a cool and understandable idea.  But the
table didn\'t say so...
  Carrying this idea into the table further, we find the following:


>Tons  Config.  L  W  H  +W  +H  Gs  Std     M3    M2   Mw  MCr  Armor Mat Str?
>4000  Box    59 31 31   -   -  3 1,562 21,864 6,668 1483 163.5   18  HS  SL

 What we see here are two hulls that are the same displacement, but rated
for different thrusts and are different shapes.  One of these hulls is
giving up 60%+ of its volume to _something_, while the other is giving up
nearly 90%! The hull with more available space is also the hull rated for
the higher thrusts and has more armor!

 Clearly something is wrong with the content and/or labeling of this table.
If I had access to the core rules and assumptions that went into this table
I would offer to fix it, but it is increasingly plain to me that FF&S-TNE
is no longer even close...

Actually, Minor Races not having Jump Tech would not limit their
usefullness. Generation ships, Sleepers, Gene Banks with Robotics or even
(more plausable, given that the Romans did it, and Gibson\'s Rise and Fall
of the Roman Empire is an inspiration of the Third Impirium), forced

Given the Pax Imperium of the 1st Imperium, a more logical explanation is
that they had access to Jump tech, but did not develope it themselves. That
is the _only_ way the Imperium differs from minor and major. There is
nothing stooping a minor race having a mutli system empire, except they
aere dependant of external sources for Jump and other Tech.

Minor is a Vilani banner, a tool to help to reinforce the superioroity of the
First Imperium, and by delfault , the ROM and 3I.

I always pictured starships being constructed much like ships of today
get built.  A large space with a frame work built up as the ship is
built.  When it is closed in the delicate stuff gets installed.  The
ship Hull is it\'s own enclosure.

This is of course in opposition to the everything has to be covered
crowd.

I would probably say something like the following

Take the ships maximum dimensions as a start.  Add 25% (or 5 meters -
whichever is higher) and multiply the Length and Width to give area
required.  Multiply by height to get volume (each m3 costs 100Cr for
building costs if a custom building is required) or you need that much
floor space in any other building.

25% or 5 meters is a guess based on other construction projects I seen
(been involved in).  Many large buildings go up in essentially their own
footprint and a bit of the roading nearby for trucks to use.

I see ship construction as being highly machinery orientated with small
work crews manipulating large machines to cut, weld and place the major
hull surfaces.  Various patches and portals being left open for access.
Large self contained vehicles simply drive in suck out any contruction
left overs and create required contaminant free zones as needed (jump
Drives - Computers, controls etc....).  In fact the layout of the ship
is probably influenced by the need to build it a certain way.

It\'s huge. according to this link
http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/facilities/vab.html it is 3.25 hectares(8
acres).  160m high by 218m long by 158m wide.  Woohoo!

As an aside (3,664,883m3 =  261777 dT) those million tonners are pretty
big!!!

If the player has a natural stat that high, I always make them account for
it in a character history. Then I can use their explanation against them
durring play :)

A real wide variety of sources.
The main source is my experience with Aircraft construction; I spent some
time helping to build F/A-18\'s.
But I did factor in some Traveller stuff from TCS & COAC; I will try and
dig up all my notes and give you the details within a day or so.
The Orbital component, BTW, was pure extrapolation from Traveller
resources.

  The way I read it, you can make as many sensor attempts as you like, but it
gets harder the more you try. This makes use of the Mulitple Actions rules on
T4 p58.

  Some of the SSDS electronics include redundant systems. I like the idea

  Well, ROF is handled at the design stage. For a ROF 100, you add +1 to the
damage at each range band, but you can\'t do more than double the damage at
any band. See my SSDS web page for the full table. The URL is
http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd/Trav/SSDS/Errata.html

  BTW: This can make a great modification for lasers - feed it more power, up
the ROF, and you do more damage. I am intending to let my PCs do this
dynamically - drop life support then, we need to make this hit count - type
of thing.

  Have to agree - it really adds some atmosphere to the game. Mind you it and
Brilliant Lances are the only ones I have used. BL was too complex to easily
use as part of a game, but fun as a standalone thing.

     HarperCollins 1996 (UK)
     ISBN 0 00 225485 9
(It happens to be sitting on my desk as the library\'s just bought a copy).

Useful book (particularly for Traveller referee\'s!) discussing all manner

        Well, I am most honored... now I am really starting to use the
revised data for my home universe ;-). At the moment, I am figuring out the
Imperial frontier at year 20 and putting some flesh into a handful of Pocket
Empires (the Geonee Confederation and the Rebin Empire being the most
prominent, but without forgetting the Trentan Federation cited in EA).
        Thanks for the attention, Marc.

        I suppose there are practical considerations preventing the revision
from going into the M0 hardback. But, one thought. Despite the fact that
around a hundred of lines had minor or not-so-minor changes in my revised
data, all the changes will easily fit in a single page. So, probably, all
the revision to FS would fit in 8/9 pages. This means a 4/5 errata sheet,
more or less the size of the old MT errata. Why don\'t include these errata
sheet with the hardback and future sales of the FS stock?

1) What happend to Scouts mustering out with Scout ships?  This is an
essential and long-established part of the game, please replace it.
 
2) In general the mustering out tables have been made more generic, I 
specifically don\'t like the 10 High Passage tickets for all porfessions.  
This basically amounts to nothing more than 80,000 fre credits.  Include 
Weapon, Scout ships and similar profession specific things instead.

3) Don\'t Noble get additional skills for promotions and commisions
(ie for Knighthood and Elevation).

4) The basic ide seems to be that character with ranks receive 
1 skill/year + 1 for Commison and +1/promotion.  Character w/o ranks
receive 1 skill/year + 1 skill/term.  I like this idea a lot.

However Schoars are cheated out of this by only receiving 1 skill/year +
one skill for raising their Edu to B or C.  Why not simply give them
+ 1/term.  Otherwise, in 4 terms they have 18 skills, rather than the
20 any other non-ranked profession would have.

5) The Commision and Promotion numbers seem *far* to easy.

6) Pleae kill the birthday generation table, it serve no purpose and takes 
up a whole lot of space.

Advantages:

I love the new Edu & school rules

I like the new rules for homeworld skills

Question:

Btw, T4.0 has both Homeworld and Background skills, have Background skills
been eliminated?

More Advantages:

I like the injury and recover tables, and the cold sleep weeks table.  

Final Thoughts:

Basically, I love this new system and think it vastly superior to any 
other char-gen system I\'ve seen for Traveller, but it does have a few 
problems.

Depends on circumstances. For example, a fire involving an oxygen line
(or a line carrying some combustible gas) would keep burning because
the pressure in the line provides the "breeze".

There exist two books from the CT days that are a reasonable start on
such: 

Spacefarer\'s Guide to Alien Races
Spacefarer\'s Guide to Alien Monsters

They were published by Phoenix Games back in 1979. There are also a
pair of books on planets. All the aliens, "monsters" and planets are
swiped from various SF books.

Sorry, but experiments on both the "vomit comet" and later on the
Space shuttle prove otherwise. The gases near the heat source get hot
and expand. But that\'s so that the *pressure* will remain constant.
There\'s *nothing* to make the outside air mix. The reason the warmer
air moves out of the way under g is that the warm air is less *dense*,
and thus rises. In zero g, the density differences don\'t cause movement.

In zero g a flame is *spherical and goes out as soon as it runs out of
oxygen, leaving a sphere of smoke. If you supply a slight breeze or if
you restore gravity, the flame will re-light! That\'s because you\'ve got
a lot of free radicals floating around looking for something to react
with. There are some research projects studying the production of
various radicals in such "suspended" flames.

> Smoke particles will be carried away with the lower pressure air.

Sorry, all the air is at the same pressure.

You assemble the ship in sections, then carry them to orbit for final
assembly. Just like we plan to do in the real world.

It won\'t. It\'ll get assigned a parking orbit (likely near a small space
station or at least a beacon) and if the ship doesn\'t have a
streamlined small craft, they pay someone to ferry things up and down.

If it does have a streamlined small craft (virtually certain) then they
use that to move things back and forth. 

This isn\'t that different from the real world seaports in places that
have lousy harbors. The big ships tie up at bouys a mile or more from
shore. Things get hauled back and forth in smaller vessels (cargo
lighters or barges).

Not necessarily. You can build ships in orbit without dedicated
"spacedock" facilities. It costs more and takes longer, but it is
doable. 

Also, don\'t forget that there are B ports on airless worlds or in
asteroid belts.

> The only problem with this is that non-streamlined ship should fall

Non-streamlined will come first WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR IT TO COME
FIRST. Airless worlds and asteroid belts. Any "natives" of such will
never have heard of streamlining until humans or other air-breathing
aliens come along.

Well, it won\'t *do* 5 g with all that mass attached. instead it\'ll

You slow the station. Which puts it in a *higher* orbit! I\'m not
kidding. Consider that a satellite at a 100 miles up orbits earth in 90
minutes, but the moon at 250,000 miles orbits in 29 *days*.

Likely. But maybe not. The forces involved aren\'t *that* far from what
might happen if a big ship "bumped" the airlock in docking. So the
docking ring may hold, but the hull of the hauler may not. So it might
"crumple" around the docking collar.

Not that hard. Remember, due to the added mass the accel goes down.
They\'ll be moving at all of 3 meters per second relative to the station
(1/5th g for 1.5 sec = 3 meters/sec)

Well, as I noted, you missed the fact that slowing down moves you
*outwards*, and the fact that the extra mass drops the acceleration a lot.

That first bit is one of the many contra-intuitive laws of orbital
mechanics, and explains why docking manuevers are so automated in the
real world. Until you are practically on top of your target manuevers
just plain don\'t work the way you expect them to.

Fire does not need an external heatsource except for ignition (as everybody

three requirements are however accurate. Turning off the floorfield will
reduce the amount of oxygen available to the fire but only if there hasn\'t

C program to handle the tedious maths for me).

There\'s been a lot of talk about making starport and infrastructure 
costs dependent on population; frankly, I disagree.  Here\'s why:

Infrastructure is an absolute quantity.  If you have too much 
infrastructure for your population, it\'s too expensive to maintain 
(as per rules).  If it were not so, every time the population 
increases, you\'ll need to increase Inf.  Too much fuss for me...

I see starports as similar, in that building a "main" starport of a 
certain class also involves building a number of sub-starports of 
lower class.  It also involves the creation of infrastructure on the 
world.  If I upgrade to a D starport from E, not only do I build a 
D-port, I produce a network of cleared landing sites all over the 
planet.  That helps my expansion, of course...

The rules for calculating EE give an infrastructure bonus to planets 
with D starports or above; I extend this to mean that upgrading a 
starport also includes an infrastructure improvement or 
restructuring, of +1 level per level of starport upgrade from E.  
Class A and B starports, once built, add to the resources score of 
the planet as per the same table.

One way of understanding the rules is that the better the resources / 
infrastructure a planet has, the better the starport is likely to be, 
when the world is discovered.  Thus, planets shouldn\'t receive 
inf/res bonuses for developing better starports.  My counter-argument 
is twofold: one, it allows pre-existing worlds to have more resources 
than ones which are developed in the course of a (long) game can ever 
have, and two, starports create resources.

How do I mean that?  Starports generate income through sales 
of fuel, maintenance and (A/B) construction, and indirectly through 
supporting space exploitation.  The resources of gas giants and 
planetoid belts has already been allowed for (+G +B if space travel) 
but space-based industries have not.  The key point here is:

Resources are determined by demand, and demand is determined by the 
use of technology.

In other words, uranium is not a resource at TL 0, because there\'s no 
demand for it.  Wood, on the other hand, is a resource from all TLs, 
which can be used more or less effectively (as detailed in PE).  An 
orbital construction industry suddenly creates a market for e.g.
lanthanum, or organic supplies (even water), which may be of almost 
no resource value up until that point.

A starport causes an increase in supply (starships and related 
services) and demand (raw materials and lifesupport).  This certainly 
merits an increase in infrastructure, but IMO also rates an increase 
in resources, since it\'s infrastructure which wasn\'t needed and 
couldn\'t exist before the starport and its use of new resources.

OTOH. there are child prodigies that have already finished grad school by the
time they are 18. And I would imagine that it would be possible for some
cultures to press average children into learning grad level stuff before they
are 18 (the same way some cultures make children into soldiers before their
teens). I just wondered if the system would account for high EDU stats that
way.

Fair enough. I just thought you ought to mention that in the text to avoid 
confusion. Also, what happens if such a person later does go to Grad School?
Would it be easier for him to graduate? (some self-taught people do go to
school precisely to get a certificate that they know what they already know).

I remember a Jack Vance short story where academic standards were so
different across the interstellar community that this planet\'s medical
authorities gave everybody, regardless of academic credentials, a test
before certifying them to practice medicine. The flip side was that if
you passed the test, you got the authorisation even if you didn\'t have
any credintials at all.
 
>I was tempted to make it possible for someone to get a degree but not the 
>Edu increase, but that was a bit too cynical.

Back when I ran a Naval campaign I fiddled a bit with the char gen. I
established minimum levels of skills for various ranks (f.ex. enlisted men
usually didn\'t get promoted until they had at least one MOS at level 2).
For officers, being of high social status added the same to your promotion
roll as having the appropiate skills at the appropiate level (being both
good at the job AND of high social status was even better, of course). So 
Captain Erakea Wois of HIMS (His Imperial Majesty\'s Ship) Mukhaldim had a
noble 2nd Officer who couldn\'t astrogate himself out of a paper bag. Wois 
and his 1st officer weren\'t too hot themselves. The best astrogator was an 
insufferable bridge ensign.
 
BTW. a completely general observation about T4: I was dissapointed that you
didn\'t make more of an effort to differentiate between general rules and
milieu-specific rules. This includes the benefits derived from mustering
out. TAS memberships and scout ships shouldn\'t, IMO, be as plentiful in
Year 0 as they are in Year 1100 (I was surprised to learn that the TAS
even existed in Year 0).

That was the reason we decided not to have infrastructure and starport 
costs related to Pop, actually.  There was a lot of discussion about this 
during playtesting.  In the end, Stu and I opted for the playability 
route instead of the realism route on this one.  

The game was already becoming so complex as to make each turn take a 
great deal of time and effort.  There were several suggestions on the 
table for making the game even more realistic, but adding them in made 
it much much less playable. More than half the playtesters wanted the 
game to be simpler, while less than half wanted the game to be more 
complex.  Game design isn\'t a democratic process, but we felt the 
playtesters who wanted it to be simpler were better representative 
of the intended audience. So, we opted for playable, attempting to strike 
a decent balance between the two extremes.

In game terms, what you\'re doing when you increase Infrastructure is 
coating the whole planet in improved Infrastructure, in a sense.  Thus, 
the Size factor in that cost formula. It\'s not necessarily a uniform coat 
of Infrastructure; maybe two continents are increased by 2 points and two 
continents aren\'t increased at all, giving a total, planet-wide 
Infrastructure increase of 1 (assuming uniform population distribution).  
Essentially, that\'s what the game is modeling.

Finally, it\'s a trivial task to change the formula for using Pop instead of 
Size, for those who like complex, realistic rules.  We figured anyone who 
wanted to do so could easily modify the rules to suit their own 
campaigns.  Those who just wanted to play a fun Traveller game could use 
the rules as written.

Yes, you\'ve hit the nail on the head.  The rules I\'m working on right now 
for city generation show this effect.  If you have a B class starport in 
the UWP, you\'re going to have primary, secondary, and tertiary cities with 
better starports and/or spaceports than you would if your UWP starport 
was C class.


> Class A and B starports, once built, add to the resources score of 
> the planet as per the same table.

I see where your reasoning is coming from, but actually that\'s not the 
case in the PE rules.  Of course, I\'m not trying to discourage you from 
using your variant rule; there\'s nothing wrong with that.  But, under the 
rules, Resources is a fixed valuation that is based on what exists 
on-planet.  The amount of resources you can extract and use varies with 
TL.  Thus, the .1*TL part of the GWP formula.  And, since the entire GWP 
formula uses multiplication (other than the divided by C+1 part), this 
affects Infrastructure as well.  TL and Infrastructure are inextricably 
linked.  Again, the cities rules (which include detailing rules for Pop, 
Gov, LL, TL, Resources, Infrastructure, Labor, and Culture) make this 
aspect of the rules evident to a much greater degree than does PE.

In PE, the + DM\'s for Resources based on Starport Type are merely 
expressing the tendency of planets with higher Resources to have better 
starports.  Working it the other way changes the meaning of Resources.  
Again, though, if that\'s how you want your universe to work, go for it. :)


One final note:  PE\'s economic rules could easily have been extended to 
make a whole book all by themselves.  There are a lot of complex 
interactions in there, as well as subtle inter-dependencies and effects. 
It will take most people quite a bit of time, study, and play before they 
fully understand every nook and cranny of the system.  Some of IG\'s 
future products will expand on the implications of the PE Econ rules, 
making them more obvious.  

I encourage those of you who are interested in this to stop by the PE 
walk-through on IRC this Thursday.  While Stu will be going through the 
whole book, I plan to be there as well, and we both hope to spend a good 
amount of time exploring the Economics section.

I beg to differ. My conclusion that attributes (ie. stats) have a bigger
effect than skills in the published T4 rules is not based on comparing the
numbers of each, it is based on actually using these rules in the game. The
trouble is that tasks and DMs do not just depend on the total number of
attribute and skill points, they also depend on their variance from the
norm, the number of times they get used, and the modifiers available. And
in all these effects, attributes beat skills.

\'Way back when I first got T4 I played using the published rules. Pretty
soon everyone noticed that the high-attribute characters were just
succeeding massively at everything they tried, regardless of the difficulty
of the task or what their skills were. Everyone else was a chump by
comparison. This may or may not be realistic, but definitely harmed
enjoyment of the game. My players soon learned to make all their character
generation rolls on the Physical and Mental development table since +1 Dex
was easier and better than getting +1 in every Dex-based skill. The effect
was that all the characters became very similar and the task results
unbalanced, so I had to use one of the alternate task systems

>What is important is the range.  If you have skills from 0-6
>and stats from 100-106 the stats are no more important than
>the skill.  Both have a range of 6, you are just adding 100
>to all the roles.

You are correct, the range is important. The range, or variance as I called
it in my post, determines the difference between a "good" skill from a
"bad" skill. If the variance was small, the difference between a "good"
pilot and a "bad" pilot would be minor. However, an average skill is around
2 and varies by 2 points or so. An average attribute is around 7 and varies
by 7 or more points (player characters tend to be on the high end of this
scale). This means two "skilled" characters can vary by as much as 10
points. This is an enormous range of variation, which is not bad. What is
bad is that most of the variance is from attributes, and almost none is
from the skill.

This means that one\'s skill level has little effect on how "good" you are
at doing things. For example, which do you think would be a better sensor
technician; a scout trained in the use of every known sensor technolgy
backed with years of experience, or some kid who took 1 course in college?
Answer: you have no idea. You have to know their Intelligence attributes.
The variability between different characters\' Int is so large is swamps any
difference in training. I am not saying Int shouldn\'t count, I am saying
training should be an important factor and right now it isn\'t.

How so? First of all, using the published rules, skills do not have a range
of 6; they have a range of 2 or 3 and the distribution of this range is
heavily skewed to the low end of the scale. Attributes have a much wider
range, and at least for player characters, they are skewed toward the high
end.

Secondly, you do not add the extra attribute points "to all the rolls",
only the ones which use the attribute, and attributes are used more often
than skills. Therefore, 1 point in a attribute beats 1 point in a skill.
And characters start off with more attribute points than skill points. The
combination is overwhelming.

Third, it\'s easier to get a high attribute than a high skill. Smart players
will make almost all their character development rolls on the Physical or
Mental character generation tables if you let them. The probability of
increasing Dex is 1/6 on each roll on the Physical table for most careers,
while Dex-based skills are scattered among several tables so the
probability of getting a single high skill is low. Therefore getting high
attributes is easier and more beneficial than getting high skills. This
rewards munchkins and penalizes role-players.

>The system is identical to one where you
>have skills and stats both from 0-6 and you roll against
>100+skill+stat.

Alas, it is not. You see, it\'s not just attribute+skill you roll against.
Many times, like in the personal pools, the table DMs, the character
generation breakpoint DMs, action points from Snapshot, breaking grapples
or \'sticky gun\' hits, and in may other cases, you do not roll a task. You
roll against a basic attribute, skill, or use one as a DM. In all these
cases using attributes gives you lots more points than skills. In your
example, it\'s like the 100 is added only when the attribute is included and
never when the skill is used.

Moreover, there are fewer attributes than there are skills. This means that
the extra attribute points get added to many tasks, while skill points are
only added to a few. If you have a high attribute you are simply
overwhelmingly powerful in many, many tasks. At the same time a high skill
is practically worthless; it only applies in a few instances, and cannot
make up for a low attribute unless skills reach double digits. This was the
basis for my claim that skills should be allowed to do so.

The result is the oft-lamented "Traveller Effect", where an English
professor picks up a jump drive manual and can suddenly make drive
modifications the designers themselves can\'t match. Or the olympic gymnast
who completes a first-aid course and can now perform heart transplants
better than Dr. Barnaard.

Moreover, our high-Edu English professor doesn\'t just outperform the jump
technicians, she also blows away every highly-trained mechanic, astrogator,
biologist, gravitics technician, and so on unless they also have a high
Edu. This may be appropriate for a "Gilligan\'s Island"-like campaign where
the "Professor" character can perform any technical skill well, but it does
not fit my campaign.

Simply looking at the target numbers and probabilites of the task rolls
does not give you a true indication of the relative effects of attributes
and skills. When the great Task System thread was going on I originally
made a claim similar to yours, that the difference in points did not
severely affect task outcomes. I was wrong. I didn\'t find this out by
talking about it but by actually trying out the various task systems
proposed in typical game situations.

Do you seriously claim that a character with Dex 15 and Vac Suit 1 and a
character with Dex 7 and Vac suit 9 are equally powerful? Go through the
rule book, comparing their performance on every Dex-based task, every table
and personal pool. Yet both require an equal number of rolls during
character generation. In the current T4 rules, attributes are vastly more
powerful than skills. The effect of this is to turn characters into limited
"Dex-class", "Edu-class" and so on characters. IMHO, this is the number 1
flaw with the existing T4 rules.

It means he has the "equivalent" of a grad school education. But it doesn\'t
guarantee admission or even completion.

I knew someone who did about fifteen years (Craig Lowen - if you\'re out

This goes for any of the versions of the game. (I don\'t have much choice at

My apologies.  This is perhaps not as clear as it should have been.

No it is not possible to have a discretionary tax which is negative.  
The only way to reduce tax below the Inf + Culture + Law is to reduce 
law and culture by the means described elsewhere in the book...

This sounds like an improvement to me, but what happens with those lucky
souls who rolled a high EDUT to start with?  Does such a character get a
fixed plus to their rolled EDU? (+1 for the certificate, +2 for Academy, +3
for University, +4 for Grad Schhol and +1 extra for Honors, to a max of
15)?  I would think that otherwise there would be little reason for the
character with a natural 12 EDU to go to the University, except as a
prerequisite for Med School or something.

Marc, a question about the FS data....

I was under the impression, since it was being hashed out here on the 
TML, that the FS data in the M0 harback would be revised.

Am I reading this right?  Are you still going to publish the broken 
data in the new book?

If so, I\'ve got two questions:  (1) Why has so many people been 
trying to fix this stuff if it is not going to be fixed in the 
hardback?  (2)  Why, after all of the hubbub on the TML are you still 
going to re-publish the broken data anyway?

I can tell you, if the M0 hardback does contain the broken data, I 
certainly won\'t buy it, and it will be the first T4  product that I 
haven\'t bought.

On the other hand, if the M0 hardback contains fixed data, I probably 
will get it--judging from my track record so far of buying everything 
that IG has put out.

Make me understand.

Carlos is right here.  I wouldn\'t be completely happy if the FS data 
being re-published in broken format, but I\'d be OK with errata sheets 
included in each product.  If that happened, I\'d probably get the 
product.

Not quite right, though I know what you\'re thinking about.  If you push
"backward" against an object in circular orbit, it slows down, which puts
it in an elliptical orbit with the original circular-orbit altitude as
apastron and a new, lower periastron.  At that new periastron (180 degrees
away from where the impulse was applied) the object will indeed be moving
*faster* than it was in its original circular orbit.

Similarly, if you push "forward" on such an object, it winds up in a
larger elliptical orbit, with a lower velocity 180 degrees away at the
new, higher apastron.

BTW, "Orbital decay" is one of the most misused concepts in SF.  An orbit
in vacuum never decays; it just repeats indefinitely, or until perturbed
by some outside force.  Only orbits near enough to a planet to feel the
outer edges of an atmosphere decay, due to the tiny but constant drag of
the atmosphere.

I would imagine that docking rings/bays would be built very tough, to
withstand just this sort of mishap.  Also, the points directly in contact
with the vessel would be at least a bit elastic, to absorb shocks.  Think
about how both (most) docks and tugboats are lined with old tires, so that
things can run into them without either crumpling.  I can\'t see a good
reason why this wouldn\'t work in space (with vac-resistant elastics, of
course).

How fast they end up moving is far less important than the magnitude of
the acceleration.  Still more important is the acceleration\'s direction,
and how quickly the acceleration occurs -- the "jerk factor," as some
engineers call the latter.  If the acceleration is lined up with the
station\'s artificial gravity, then no problems at all should occur.  If
it\'s perpendicular, a ramp up to 0.2g over a few seconds won\'t cause
people to fall over, but might well topple glassware on tables and such. 
0.2g applied instantaneously and perpendicular to station g *will* knock
standing people over and cause other general mayhem among unsecured
objects.  (For comparison, by the way, 0.2g acceleration corresponds
roughly to a magnitude 6 earthquake -- though of course in an earthquake
the direction and magnitude of the acceleration is constantly shifting
from moment to moment.)

Quite true about the counter-intuitive nature of OM...hope my
clarifications make sense.

That\'s only because the "sideways" velocity needed to continuously fall
"around" the Eath becomes less the further away you are (and thus, the
weaker the Earth\'s gravitational pull becomes) -- Newton did an early
calculation using just this analogy.  If your theory were true, then
braking a ship or satellite to _zero_ orbital velocity would presumably
suddenly cause it to shoot straight upward, no? 

When you "brake" in orbit, you are reducing your total energy (kinetic,
due to motion, and potential, due to height).  The two are related, and so
the loss of kinetic energy causes a corresponding loss of potential
energy: you lose altitude.  Some of that loss returns as kinetic energy:
you speed up as you approach the planet, and then "pay back" the kinetic
energy to potential as your elliptical orbit brings you back to the
original height where the braking took place.

Larry Niven\'s "smoke ring" novels (about life in an unusual free-fall
environment) have a nice children\'s ditty summarizing basic orbital
mechanics which, alas, I cannot for the life of me remember.

It is still there if you look closely, just not as a mustering out benefit.
At the bottom of the normal generation section, it says that scouts may, at
the end of their fourth or later term, apply for detached duty. They get a
ship, and occasional missions from the IISS. This, IMO, makes a lot more
sense than receiving the ship as a mustering out benefit.

Well, most scholars will have gone to University (automatic Edu of A), and
I image "in the real world" almost all would have recieved honours (+1 Edu)
or completed Grad school (automatic Edu of B). It just means that
characters who haven\'t the background and education to be a scholar are
penalised slightly. (so they either roll on the Mental table when they can,
or complete a year of Grad school at a later date).

It does take up a lot of space, doesn\'t it? I think it could be done
better, perhaps with a description. Something like:

1st digit: 1d6 - 1, reroll 5s and 6s.
2nd diget: 2d6 - 2
3rd diget: 2d6 - 2

and then a brief example.

Quite true.  That was my point.  The net spread, or variation, of
skill numbers is not qualitatively different than the spread of
stats.

>the number of times they get used

Well, every skill roll uses each stat and skill once, so usage
is the same.  It is realistic that stats would also get
used for carring things, etc.  But I guess maybe they
need to get to be harder to get.

>and the modifiers available.

I\'m not sure what modifiers you refer to and even if you do have a -2
modifier because of some situation, it applies to the whole roll
(including skill and stat).

This is a different issue.  Skills and stats are applied 
equally in rolls.  Now it is also true that Stats are a more
fundamenal number and so one might expect them to be harder
increase than skills (I don\'t have T4 char gen in front of
me so I can\'t comment on how true this is in T4).  But that
is a question for the character generation system, not the task
resolution system.  Perhaps you might want to make it so that
those who choose the physical and mental development rolls
don\'t always get a stat increase (perhaps put in a number
of "no effective increase" entries or give out 1/4 of a stat
increase.)

Well, unless I\'m wrong, stats of 14 are not suppose to be common
and skills above 2 are suppose to be relatively common for someone
who is conentrating on that.  I would agree that if you are getting
that then you are having a problem, but it seems to me to be with
the character creation system.

[I haven\'t used to Traveller enough to comment on the importance of 
skills and stats outside of the task resolution system.  However, again
one would way that this is a perhaps a problem in character gen.]

	Er, not quite ... slowing down (decreasing orbital velocity) DOES drop you
lower ... into an orbit with a shorter period ... which makes you APPEAR to
go faster, because your _angular_ velocity goes up.

	That\'s the source of the "counter-intuitive" aspect of orbital mechanics.
To catch up to somebody, you slow down, which drops you into a lower orbit.
To drop back, you speed up, which moves you into a higher orbit, with a
longer period.

	But reducing your orbital velocity does _not_ put you into a higher orbit.

This is not the way I understand that it works.  The apparent paradox 
of orbital mechanics is that you have to slow down in order to go 
faster and you have to speed up in order to go slower.

Yes, a higher orbit is slower.  But you have to _accelerate_ in order 
to achieve the higher, slower orbit.  A lower orbit is faster, but 
you have to _decelerate_ in order to achieve a lower, faster orbit.

So if the station takes a slight deceleration, it will drop into a 
lower orbit, but it\'s velocity will _increase_.  If the new orbit 
contacts the atmosphere at any point, the station will incur 
atmospheric drag and the orbit will begin to decay.  If the new orbit 
remains outside the atmosphere, the orbit will not decay.  The second 
is the more likely scenario, considering how small the deceleration 
will be. 

If my understanding is not correct, I await enlightenment.

It might not have been the intention, but it would make good sense to me to
allow a popularity modifier.  I see two reasons for this.
	1) There could be a perceived image that the ruler is financially competent.
	2) If someone wants to give themself the disadvantage of not having their

A few comments...

After quickly perusing T41achar I find my self really liking
the system. A fusion of what has gone before.

Changes I would like to see. Add Vaccsuit as a automatic skill
to the space based careers. (navy,scouts,marines,merchants)
The reasoning is that vacc survival is required to fight/fly
your ship even if it is holed. (In the real world Navy bootcamp
and marine sea school beat the OBA Skill into your head. (OBA=
Oxygen Breathing Apperatus) This is along with Basic and advanced
firefighting. By the time you finish your first year trouble shooting
an OBA is second nature.)

I would like also a longer explanation of the quik Character 
generation. I figured it out, but seemed to be somewhat 
obscure on the the first go through.

And lastly I like the random birthday/age charts, Charts like this
are great when fully generating Npcs and Pcs.

Btw if any of y\'all are keeping track I\'m a DIP. (God, I never 
thought I would use that in conversation. 8-) )

His system was complicated by atmospheric drag effects, of course, but the
general principles are true for any orbital system:

  "In takes you spin, spin takes you out, out takes you back, back
   takes you in."

(From memory, wording might be wrong.)  In other words, moving inward
(closer to the primary) would take you into faster-orbitting air, and pull
you spinward with it relative to your starting point.  Trying to move
faster to spinward than the air around you would raise your apastron,
causing you to drift outward as well.  Moving outward would take you into
slower-orbitting air, and tug you backward (antispinward) relative to your
starting point, and finally, moving against-spin relative to the air
around you would lower your periastron and thus cause you to drop inward
as well.

The whole thing is a true delight for slightly crazed physics junkies like
myself. :)

I completely agree with this, and I really wish Marc would reconsider 
the task system he\'s going with in T4.1.

With a simple change of the task system, the problem Richard is 
talking about here would be eliminated, and if Marc would come up 
with something that puts skills on an even keel with stats, I\'d 
abolish KBv2.0.

C\'mon, Marc, there is a real problem here when a Dex 10/Skill-1 
character can beat a Dex 6/Skill-4 character.

Traveller Skill-4 skills are miles of improvement and experience over 
skill-1 skills--I don\'t care how good a character\'s natural ability 
is.

And, if we change this, we\'ll get more variety in our characters.  
Instead of having a character with high Dex be good at shooting a 
pistol, dancing, flying a ship, and wearing a vacc suit (all very 
different types of tasks) just because he happened to roll a good Dex 
during chargen, you could require the character to have good skills 
in each area--something he not likely to have in all four areas.

His natural ability (high Dex) will help him out a lot--probably 
giving him the edge he needs over some, but it won\'t replace long 
term experience.

Marc, please fix the task system before T4.1 comes out.  You\'re 
doing such a fine job on the new book.  Let\'s make it perfect by 
fixing this glaring flaw in the most basic game mechanic in T4.

Please.

Kenneth.

Not sure how this missed the manuscript, but here goes:

Lightning Calculator:

Not a true psionic ability, lightning calculator is the ability to 
perform complex mathematical calculations with lightning fast 
ability.  A character with this ability can approach the speed of 
lower grade computers in terms of mathematical calculations.  This 
ability therefore gives the character an advantage in any situation 
where such calculations may be helpful.  Treat as a +1 DM on any 
skill rolls that the referee believes this ability would give the 
character an edge, such as Astrogation, Computer programming, etc.
This person can also function as a Rating 0 computer as a result of 
these abilities.

Thank you.  Actually, most of the specials were Guy Garnett\'s.  He 
originally wrote them as house rules for CT/MT.  I modified some of 
them, came up with the rules surrounding their use in T4, and 
added a few more.

Well, first of all its tough to even develop a special.  Psi strength 
has to be above average, only certain schools teach it, etc.  This 
was by design.

I heartily recommend, btw, that the referee implement the full range 
of this ability as well, i.e., the ability to latently go invisible 
in times of stress.  It tends to make the ability a mixed blessing at 
best.

Psionics Points are what, IMO, prevents Psionics from being a game  
 breaker, especially in a situation (Milieu 0) where ANY PC or NPC 
potentially has developed psionic powers.  I shudder to think what M0 
would look like without such a limiter.

I hesitate to use the word that sprang to mind when I read this. Instead

Which is exactly the reason why infrastructure would and should be

No, per the rules the USE of infrastructure is proportionate to the
population. That\'s why you get twice as many RUs out of 2 labor points as
out of 1, all other things being equal. But per the rules the BUILDING of
infrastructure is an absolute quantity. That\'s why there is a discrepancy.

>If it were not so, every time the population increases, you\'ll need to

Which makes perfect sense. Otherwise you can double a planetary population
by moving people from a low-tech, low-infrastructure planet to a high-tech,
high-infrastructure planet and and double the production of that planet in
a year.

However, there\'s no reason why you can\'t simply rule that the Infrastructure
increase that accompany natural population increase is a hidden factor that
the ruler needen\'t bother about.

I see starports as two different types, presently not distinguished in the
rules. One is the type that is sized to serve the needs of the whole planet.
That type would be bigger (and cost more) the larger the population is. The
other kind is the "pimple" on the planetary backside that is essentially
unrelated to the size of the planetary population. The trade station that
only really trades with the nearest country, the advanced military base, the
scout resupply base, etc. That kind would cost differently according to just
what it is supposed to accomplish, but it wouldn\'t have mucg to do with the
size of the local population.

But how playable is a system that makes the bulk of your planets lousy
investment prospects and a very few of the planets amazing investment
prospects? How many of your playtesters actually invested in anything
except the high-population planets in their pocket empires? The example in 
the book details an investment that will take 213 years to get back. How 
many pocket emperors will make such an investment instead of building
warships?

You actually tried out the suggestion? Could you let me know exactly what

Playability is the most important thing, I agree, to the point where huge 
abstractions and gross generalisations are justified, especially in a game 
with the scope of PE. But to me the line is crossed when you go from gross
generalisations into downright fallacies. And I still find it difficult
to believe that a system that makes a 10 man colony as expensive to build
as a 10 billion man colony can actually be playable, even at the level
of abstraction that is PE. I\'m handicapped here because I haven\'t been
able to set up a trial game; I have only a lot of of calculations to guide
me, so I may be wrong. But if the reason why it turned out to be playable
was that your playtesters simply didn\'t invest in anything but the high-
population planets, then the proper abstraction would have been to just 
ignore any and all economic considerations for low and medium population 
planets (That would actually make sense; the budget of a planet more than a 
couple of population levels below the biggest one in you pocket empire will 
be peanuts compared to the big planets). You should still keep them for 
political purposes, of course.

Did any of your playtesters try to run a pocket empire with no high-
population worlds at all? How much did they invest in infrastructure
improvement and starport upgrades?

Anyway, if anyone is running a pocket empires campaign, I\'d love to hear
about your experiences wrt these matters.

But that\'s one of the things that makes no sense at all. A colony of a few
million people wouldn\'t be using a whole planet. And no matter how uniformly
they were spread out, they wouldn\'t build bigger mines and factories than
they can run, just because the planet is bigger.

Essentially you\'re making a planet with a population of 10 million (or one
with a 100 people, for that matter) build the same number of mines and
factories and the same size transportation network as a planet with 10 
billion people. And you\'re making a size 10 planet with 10 billion people 
build 10 times as many mines and factories and 10 times the size 
transportation network as a size 1 planet with the same number of people. 
Simplification for the sake of playability is one thing, but this is just
plain wrong; except for the transportation network it dosen\'t make sense, 
and even the transportation network dosen\'t make sense for planets with low 
and medium populations, where the size of the planet is mostly irrelevant, 
because people won\'t be spread out equally across it.

Wouldn\'t it have been better to mention that in the book, then? And I don\'t
understand why a simple formula like "One point of infrastructure costs TL
RUs per labor point" is that much more complex than a flat fee. But it
would be a lot mote realistic. Admittedly, you\'d lose the difference in
the size of the transportation network for different sized planets, but
that is IMO a simplification that would be fully justified by the playability
concern. 

And you would have had one huge advantage from linking the costs to the size
of the population: the game would have been instantly scalable. You would be
able to run a game with only medium-population planets simply by redefining
the size of a labor point. One of the problems I had when I tried out the
rules was that I used (my version of) the Sword Worlds in Year 55 (something
I had already worked out in another context). Now, the biggest population
levels in the Sword worlds at that time was 7 (Again, please note that this
is unofficial; that\'s just my version). And with the number of RUs those
planets produced, there was no way anybody could afford to upgrade anything.

I have a sneaking suspicion that possibly your playtesters have all had a
few high-population worlds to play with and that they didn\'t have time to
run into these problems. But I may be wrong.

Unless the B starport is put there by a pocket emperor who just want an

to have more more than one starport on the whole planet.

Agreeing with the quoted poster about the infrastructure weirdness I\'d like
to add another questionmark:
When generating Resources for systems you get bonus for Industrial and
minuses for NonIndustrial. IMHO either Ind/NonInd is irrelevant to
resources or you should give NonIndistrial a plus and Industrial a minus.
Industrial planets consume huge amounts of resources and should therefore
generally be lacking in those while NonIndustrials have small populations
who cannot yet have made an impact on the planets resources. Beside realims
the rules as stated makes it even more unlikely to get the population
distributions as seen in Traveller - why would I want to live on a NonInd
world? Could someone responsible for those particular rulings please
explains their reasons (I might have gotten it totally wrong here of
course).
Note that the trade class modifiers are applied to worlds that already are
Ind/NonInd and not to those that eventually will become such types of
worlds.

My take on this issue (used in my own system) is:
Dex, Int, Kar are used in 2 ways.

1 The unskilled DM depends on the characteristic. The lower the
characteristic the higher the penalty. This cover innate ability etc.

2 The most important use of characteristics is when improving skills. In my
charGen system and experience system characters get eligible for skill
advancement for various reasons (rolling on tables in the former, using the
skill in the latter) and this allows them to roll versus their
characteristics for improvement and this roll gets harder as skill levels
increases.

The advantage with this is that that two equally skilled characters have
equal chances of suceeding at a task but the one with higher characteristic
is more likely to gain a high skill level and is also better at unskilled
tasks. Whenever an NPC is to be used only as a pilot all I need to know
about him is his skill level which simplifies the game a lot. As my skills
have verbal names: Unskilled, inexperienced,fair,good,expert and master
these terms compleately describe the abilities of tha character in that
area. What about damage to characteristics? Simple, whenever a controlling
characteristic goes down by 3 the skill levels of all skills controlled by
that attribute drops 1 lvl.

In the description of the psionic institues, What was the intended
purpose for the rating given to the individual psionic disciplines?
There are no rules which relate to the rating (other than level 0
diciples are not taught), and although I\'ll probably develop my own
rules I\'m curious as to what the intended purpose of these levels were?

Thanks in anticipation.

Actually, I feel the Solomani are *more* equal.

Nothing specific that I can think of, although I get that impression.

    'body' => 'Hi,

Regarding all the discussions of various rules that are "broken," from 
task systems to design systems to Infrastructure costs, to everything 
else, I don\'t quite know how to respond without further inflaming the 
issue.  I\'ve stated the reasoning for the stuff I was involved in, so 
I\'ll just speak my peace here and leave it at that.

Given infinite resources and infinite time, anyone could come up with the 
perfect role-playing system.  But, like anything else, game design isn\'t 
done that way.  You have a deadline, you have a certain amount of people 
you can pull in to the project to lend advice and playtesting (the limit 
being the number of people you have time to listen to, of course), and 
you get the work done under those conditions.

We all like to come up with better rules; that\'s part of role-playing, 
and always has been.  I can\'t think of a single rule in Traveller that 
has been universally accepted as the Right Thing.  That\'s good; that\'s 
how things improve.  Nothing is ever perfect, but we can make it closer 
to perfect if we keep working at them, even after they\'ve been published. 
I\'ll hate it if RPGs ever become like modern-day programming, where the 
average person no longer has input into the process and is no longer 
able to change things for him- or herself. 

But, I think it\'s counter-productive to complain to the designers who 
read the mailing list.  By the time the product is released, it\'s too 
late for the designer to do anything about it.  The decisions have been 
made, the die has been cast, it\'s over.  The why\'s and wherefore\'s are no 
longer important; either the product stands up on its own, or it 
doesn\'t.  No amount of discussion, here or anywhere else, will change 
that.  The marketplace will determine whether that designer\'s work is 
good, and, indeed, whether that designer will be allowed to continue 
designing.  Either way, the message will be loud and clear.

To me, the right thing to do if one isn\'t happy with the rules as 
published is to come up with something better, and share it around.  Back 
before T4, I shared around several rules, including some new Advanced 
careers for CT, some equipment, new experience rules, appearance 
generation rules, and a bunch of other stuff.  I got some good feedback 
on some of those rules, and was able to change them and make them better, 
not only for my own CT campaign, but for others here as well.

Everyone here on TML is very capable, and very willing to kick ideas 
around and find ways to improve them.  I encourage you to find 
improvements for the published rules, and share them around for comment 
and criticism. Someday, those rules will be, if not _the_ Right Thing, 
very close to it.  Then, either publish those rules in JTAS, or offer 
them the next time the product comes up for revision.

That way, everybody wins.  It\'s just a suggestion, but it might work.


Anyway, I have to get to work; a new project has just come up, and the 
deadline is extremely tight.  I\'ll be reading TML as usual, but I won\'t 
be responding until much closer to GenCon, I fear. :(


May your Travelling be happy,

- -Joe

    'body' => 'OK,  I\'ve looked over the T4.1 Character Generation rules, created one of
each type of character, and found the following issues.  Overall, these
rules are very nice; they flow smoothly, and have a good sense of internal
consistency.  I really like the education skills rules, and like the
Character Template concept (very useful for NPCs).

1.  Education bonuses for schooling are (per your earlier response) fixed
EDU values depending on the school attended.  To avoid the issues and
inconsistencies of natural 12 EDU characters, perhaps you should consider
using 1d6 for initial EDU generation, which will then be modified by formal
education or life/career experience.  You have all of the elements for this
in the current rules, other than the initial 1d6 value instead of a 2d6
value.

2.  Mustering Out benefits need some clarification.  The money is clear, as
are items like High Passages, but some clarification needs to be given for
Lands (noble), Weapon and Gun (are these the same thing?).  Also, the terms
of Ship Ownership from mustering out need to be addressed; what if multiple
ships are rolled, etc (I assume the old CT/MT rules are still in place, but
they are not stated.

3.  I like the World Determination piece quite a lot.  I am currently going
through the sector data file you had sent to try and create a list of
possible candidate worlds for these entries.  I was hoping to get at least
one per Sector, but some of the entries do not have a counterpart in the
sector data; I guess they will have to be defined in the "Free-Form"
sectors by each individual GM.

4.  In the Skills Available Through Education table, a number of skills
(Camouflage, Pilot, Ship Tacticss, Tactics) are underlined, but no
explanation is given.  These all look military (except for Pilot), so is
this a Military Academy only limitation?

5.  Important dates - very cool!

6.  Low Passage Effects - The column for a roll of 1 should be removed, as
this is a 2d roll with no modifiers.  Why do some entries have a \'-\' in
them, while others are blank?

7.  Character Cards - Again a nice thing.  In the file I got, the Str, Dex
and End checkboxes were not right-justified, whih I think is the effect you
were looking for.  This may be a word-processor foible, but I thought I
would point it out.

8.  Nobles - Why is this \'02\' instead of \'01\'?  All of the careers are
numbered one higher than intuitively expected.

9.  Entertainers - The speciality note is unclear.  Is this Specialty skill
in addition to the normal skill received, or in place of the normal skill
received?

10.  Rogues - The Masquerade rules have a small glitch, in that a Rogue
might be masquerading as somebody else when he fails his Continuance roll.
Would this require the Rogue to serve one additional Term as an Open Rogue?
Also the Cluster/Cascade skill headers were not in Bold in this sheet.

11.  Marines, Navy, Army, Merchants - Does time served in the service
academy count as a Term for mustering out?

12.  Scholars - related to the item above.  The Going Back to School note
says a scholar may substitute attenedance in school for years in the
scholar career.  I assumed this meant the Scholar could attend school and
receive school skills in place of Term skills, but it could also be
interpreted that the scholar\'s beginning education is counted for Mustering
Out calculations.

So that\'s it.  As I said, these rules worked out pretty well for me; they
generated fairly balanced characters, and did not cause me a lot of grief
and confusion.  Granted I\'ve played Traveller for quite a while, but I did
not find myself making too many assumptions based on past Traveller
rulesets.

I am very much looking forward to Traveller 4.1

I can understand that.  I note that the Be developer list appends a blurb
at the end of each message explaining how to unsubscribe.

I also note that the list is plagued with people who insist on copying that
bit of fluff into every reply.

Hear! Hear!

This is a key point that keeps me from converting to the new rules and
buying rule-based (rather than background-based) products from IG.

Please, Marc and IG, don\'t waste this opportunity. At least take a look at
Kenneth\'s KBv2.0 for an example and then make your own if necessary, but
don\'t pave the road for an eventual T4.2. Take care of business now and fix
the task system instead of presenting us with another broken one.

I know you\'re getting darn close to printing time on this, so don\'t waste a

I have played it, and by making it a bitch to use and learn, so it cost a
lot, it became fairly usable.  Essentially, it gave the character the
equivalent of a cammo suit from a couple of tech levels higher, and one
that he was never sure worked.

It does change the picture, but in a way that I kind of like.  I just
_hate_ point costs for anything, unless it is a rarely used thing that
merits some serious role playing.  For example, I give people with high
tactics or weapons skills a few points of "combat luck", much like the
tactics pool, and they can call in their markers at any time, but the
quantity is both limited and unknown.

For Psionics, I view it as like any other stat - a high strength means that
you have a maximum power level you can work at, but not for long, and a
lesser power level, which you can reliably use, but you will tire fairly
quickly.  A point system works fine here.)  You then have a low level that
is essentially always available.

For example, I can do something like 70 dips on a dip machine at half my
body weight.  I can do perhaps a few dozen at 80% of my body weight, and I
tried doing some at double my weight, and just barely did one.  Note that I
get bored before getting tired at 10%.

Psionics are a lot like that - a grade 12 telekinetic can lift, with
effort, about 200-300 kg.  He is going to be pretty useless after that.
The same telekinetic has a parlor trick of holding up a 5 kilo weight for
hours.

I raise the costs significantly, BTW, if the Psion in question does not
have an appropriate level of skill.

Rule summary: if the target number is enough below the base difficulty,
they do not pay at all, but if they do not have the prerequisite skill, the
difficulty is raised, which raises the target number.  A grade 12 holding a
10 gram weight is virtually never going to pay anything.

I am working out how I want range and power to affect usage of Psi for
decent game balance, but someone with a Psi of 12 is going to be bloody
dangerous regardless of how few skills he or she knows, just because he or
she can go on forever for small stuff - like lie detection for a skilled
and powerful telepath.

I have also abolished the age decay rules - I added it instead to the
standard aging charts, with the same decay as Int.  I also made it possible
to train, but I made it a very uncertain and dangerous task.  I balance it
with the requirement for all of those skills.

So far, it has worked pretty well in play, and my Zhodani Kill Kommando
test group has been reasonably happy, yet not totally superior to the
opposition.  The most game breaking aspect has been teleportation, and I am
experimenting to make it work.

Well I went out and got Psi Institutes this weekend, and I am quite 
impressed!  You Core guys are making quality stuff!

I did take a look at Anomalies, looks like a cool colection of adventures, 
will buy that next time.

I was realy tempted to get LWH, but I\'m still a player in that one with 
Allen Shock.  So I curbed my desire.

Anyway I basicaly skimmed over Psi institutes, then did a detailed reading 
of certain sections, particualry the psi rules for T4 and the special 
powers.  I had a few questions.

I see the question of Lighning Calc has been covered, so I won\'t go there.

It seems to be that if you can find/afford to train at a  five star psi 
institute(QI=5), your difficulty level for any basic task is automatic?  Now 
I see the need for Psi points (personaly I always thought TNE\'s psi rules 
made them a bit too powerful anyway <G>)

Another question, there doesnt seem to be any description of what exactly 
the levels for the different psi departments are for.  Is the number the 
highest skill level one can learn in that discipline?

Overall the book is rich in detail and explanations of psionics in society. 
 Sociopolitical Ramifactions(didn\'t think I could spell that did you?<G>) 
and History. Types of institutes ranging from Acreditied Scientific 
Universities, Secret Government Agencies(FNORD!) and Secret Mystic 
Societies(also FNORD!).

Still my favorite psi institute is the "crazy old man in the cave" on that 
TL-1 "Barren" rock ball. :)

KUDOS to you all, fine work on this book.

Which brings to mind a concept we are toying with in T41: Space cadets...
kids who are maybe 13 to 18 years old, with their homeworld skills, a full
set of characteristics (well, maybe Edu will be generated as 2D minus 5 at
age 13), and they gain +1 every year until 18. Aside from their homeworld
skills, they have access to the whole range of default skills (ie:

x	Acting	Int, Edu  
x	Art	Dex, Int
x	Athletics	Dex, End
x	Bow Combat	Dex
x	Brawling	Dex, Str
x	Bribery	Int, Soc
x	Broker	Edu

x	Forgery	Dex, Int
x	Gambling	Int, Dex

x	Ground Craft	Dex, Int
x	Gun Combat	Cascade
x	Heavy Weapons	Dex, Str
x	Instruction	Int, Edu
x	Interrogation	Int, End
x	Intimidation	Str, End
x	Intrusion	Dex, Int
x	Investigation	Int, Edu
x	Knife	Dex
x	Melee	Str, End
x	Music	Dex,Edu
x	Navigation	Edu, Int
x	Perception	Int
x	Philosophy	Int, Edu
x	Pistol	Dex
x	Psychology	Int, Edu
x	Recon	Dex, End
x	Research	Edu, Int
x	Rifle	Dex
x	Shotgun	Dex
x	Stealth 	Dex
x	Streetwise	Int, End
x	Submachinegun	Dex
x	Survival	Int, Str
x	Sword	Dex, Str
x	Throwing	Dex, Str
x	Trader	Int, Edu
x	Vac Suit	Dex
x	Watercraft	Dex, Int
x	Writing	Int, Edu

So, does Int also start as 2D-5 at age 13 and increase +1 every year until
18? Imagine a kid who is Int 3 who gradually gets smarter as he gets closer
to adulthood (I think I\'ve meet some of them).

Depends on the station configuration.  Given a station of sufficient TL
that has it\'s own artificial gravity, it is a good assumption that they
have thrusters of some sort to counteract any reasonable force a docking
craft might apply.  If the station spins to generate gravity, the easiest
thing to do is have ships dock as close to the hub as possible to reduce
the change in mass distribution and resultant angular velocity change.
Either way the station is sure to have thrusters to compensate with new
forces and hold stable orbits.  Ideally, a station would be very large in
comparison to any docking craft.  Small stations might require that huge
ships use smaller ship\'s boats for docking.

Agreed, fully.  A low pop planet is a good investment, if you have only a
small amount of resources.  You can make a planet of 5000 people a pretty
major force in an area three tech levels below it.

I altered my own system to drop certain trade codes as determined by the
physical stats of the world, and instead to make them society
determinations.  What was considered In in old traveller is now a high
infrastructure rating, and as soon as I get my Python script finished that
will produce new UWPs from old ones for the Galaxy at large, I will release
it.

I formerly kept ones like Ag, Ba, Hi, Ic, Lo, Na Wa, Va, and so on, as they
are useful determinations derived from the UWP.  Ri, Po, In, and Ni were
not related to the stats of the world, imho, and were determined instead by
DM intervention.  I am now considering making In and Ni determined by the
Infrastructure rating, and perhaps Ri and Po determined by the culture
rating.  While this would not have been the system I would have used, I can
live with it, and I can see some definite benefits.  FWIW, I would then
have to see if we want an alternative factor or trade code, like Type a vs.
Type B personalities.  There are two issues after all - how developed is
the infrastructure, and how hard do people work with the cool toys - I
could argue that Culture and Infrastructure cover both.

I am going to use the approach that all infrastructure and starport types
cost on a per population basis.  The costs in the book look okay for pop 9
worlds, so I just need to fiddle a bit.

(Note: this means that when population comes in or leaves, you will find
infrastructure and such changing.  I can live with a pop 6 In world
becoming a pop 7 Ni world because of a flood of unskilled labor, and lack
of resources to build the required infrastructure.  Resources and culture,
I suspect, do not change with pop, but the cost to maintain them do, and so
an influx of poor or rich people could change culture.)

Industrial worlds are better able to exploit the resources of the planet (in 
the same whay that space faring races are better able to exploit the asteroid 
belt than TL 3 worlds!).

It gets more confusing when you look at a Hohmann transfer between orbits.

You need to speed up to leave your initial (inner) orbit, which puts you on an 
elliptical transfer orbit.  At the "top" of your elliptical orbit you are going 
quite slowly, so you need  to speed up again to move into the new (outer) orbit.

As far as the ship is concerned, it has only ever used its M-drive to increase 
its speed, but at the end of the day, it is in a higher orbit with a lower 
speed!

When you look at the energy needed to transfer to a higher orbit, it makes more 
sense that you always need to "speed up" to move to a higher orbit ... the 
counter-intuitive aspect is that after all this speeding up, you are going 
slower than when you started.

I think you are in error.  
Kinetic + potential energy for a stable orbit = -GMm/(2r)
 
This means that for a stable orbit further out you need to add 
energy to the station.  Accelerating in the opposite direction to the 
station\'s orbital velocity will reduce the (both kinetic and total) 
energy of the station.
 
 
As an extreme example, consider the ship using its M-drive for long 
enough to completely counter the orbital velocity.  The station will 
rapidly plummet to the planet surface - it will not move to an 
infinitely 
distant orbit (which is required for a stable orbit at zero orbital 
velocity).
 
Orbit transfer (according to "Orbital Mechanics" by John E Prussing and 
Bruce A. Conway, Oxford University Press, 1st ed 1993, ISBN 
0-19-507834-9) is usually accomplished by a minimum fuel two-impulse 
circle-to-circle transfer referred to as a Hohmann transfer (p106 of 
said text).  The first impulse (period of acceleration) transfers the 
object from its circular orbit into another (usually elliptical) orbit. 
 The object moves along the elliptical orbit until it is time for the 
second impulse, which transfers the object from the elliptical orbit to 
the new circular orbit.  If your impulse is wrong, you can transfer to 
parabolic or even hyperbolic orbits, which may end in ultimate 
disaster!  

<fx: later>
I\'ve studied my Hohmann orbit info a bit further.
 
>> 1.) The station suffers a sudden, sharp deceleration, dropping it 
>> below orbital velocity.  The station\'s orbit begins to decay.
 
The answer to Mike Lee\'s query seems to be:
The space station will move into an eliptical orbit.  Due to the 
relatively small change in the stations velocity (3m/s change compared 
to around 10,000 m/s original velocity), the eccentricity of the orbit 
will be small and can probably be ignored for most purposes (other than 
a TNS item and a fine).
 
When the space station has completed one orbit, a small impulse of 3 
m/s opposite to the initial upset will set the space station back into 
its intended orbit.

I disagree with this.  Minor races didn\'t discover jump drive on their own. 
The term originated with the Vilani, who used to to reinforce the power
structure.  Think of a major race as being a Great Power and you have a good
analogy.

For example, look at East Indians.  You find them all over the world, and
have for a long time, even though India wasn\'t a power (or even a country)
for much of that period.  How?  The British \'imported\' them as servants, and
others came along as shopkeepers, in the 19th century.

Some minor races will be small and localized (especialy those with non-human
life support requirements).  Others will be widespread.  Look at the way Newt
bureaucrats flourished in the Third Imperium, for example.

When I wrote this section, I basically wanted the best of the

institutes are automatic, as they were in CT & MT.

It is the highest skill level that a character can learn in that

The only errata for PE is the two tables I\'ve posted a couple of times 
before.  I\'ve sent them to webmaster@imperiumgames.com, but they haven\'t 
been put on the web site yet. :(

Here they are again...


ALIEN RACE TABLE

Roll  Race Type
 2-9  Minor human race.
10-11 Minor alien race.
 12+  Major alien race.


PARTNER TABLE

1D  Social Rank  Homeworld
1   Soc +1       Same World
2   Soc +0       Same World
3   Soc +0       Neighbor World
4   Soc -1       Neighbor World
5   Soc -2       Another Pocket Empire
6   Soc -1D      The Imperium


The trade code table is correct, BTW.  Stu and I went back and forth on 
those things so many times...yeesh.  When we were designing Economics and 
Planetary Development (our two chapters for PE), we spent all night every 
night, and all day every weekend, working on it; about half the time 
together on IRC, and half the time alone, writing and coming up with 
possible solutions to the many issues.  We argued things back 
and forth for hours and hours, trying to examine every possible way of 
looking at things.  We tested the ones that seemed good, using about 50 
sample worlds provided by Marc (this was in the days before First Survey 
was released - oh, how we wished for FS to be out while we were designing 
PE!).  Finally, we came up with something worth playtesting.

We brought the playtesters in, and things changed again and again.  Those 
poor people were getting 100K emails every day, sometimes two, three, or 
four times a day, as things changed based on their feedback.  At last, 
there came a time when it was too late to make more changes, so we took 
the results and spent the last bit of time weaving things together into a 
coherent whole.

Oops, sorry, went on a trip down memory lane. <G>   Fortunately, since 
those early days after the changeover, the entire design team has gotten 
IG on schedule (as you\'ve seen from the recent spurt of products), so the 
amount of design time we have has greatly increased. Hopefully, we\'ll 
never have to work under the brutal schedules we had for M0 and PE. 

I don\'t really recall the reason for not having a Resources DM for Ni.  
As I mentioned, we went over this stuff so many times...I can recall 
various arguments and lines of reasoning, but darned if I know which one 
we chose for this issue.  Perhaps it had to do with Ni being defined as a 
world with Pop 6-.  Or, it might have been something else entirely.  I 
shoulda kept the 2\' tall stack of notes and drafts that I accumulated 
during the design phase.

Anyway, the table correctly reflects the final manuscript we turned in.

comments!

- --begin paste--

Marc:

Just a few thoughts on character generation...

(1) College and Advanced Degrees:

     a) Military/merchant personnel could be sent to college and advanced
schools during the course of a career. This would recommend the trend in US
military today where officers (and even NCO\'s) are requested/required to get
BA, BS, advanced degrees.

     b) Characters should be able to get additional BA/S, MA/S, PhD level
degrees as long as they\'ve got the credits and they make the rolls!

     c) Provision for on-the-job training, other slow accumulation of skills.
Example, the USMC now has a professional reading program. All levels must
read a variety of books, I think between 1-4 a year. These books range from
military fiction (Starship Troopers!!!!) to "self help (The Seven Habits of
Effective People!!!!) to biography, history, etc. If a character had a hobby
of studying Vilani archaeology, for example, and spent the "dead time" while
in jumpspace reading about this, maybe in a four year term they would get a
level of Archaeology (Vilani)...

     d) Should get additional skills through experience...I think from some
of your postings that you are doing this...

(2) Cross Training: In the US military (at least when I was in), advanced
officers had to do some cross training in another branch. For example, Air
Force pilots (if I remember correctly) might be picked to learn carrier ops.
Army might cross-train with marines. Something along this line might be good
if you are in a military career long enough...say Lt. Col (or equivalent
level) Army might be sent to be a staff officer for a term in the Navy in
order to learn logistics, fleet movement, grand tactics, etc.

(3) Nobles: Should have a chance to acquire skills from any other branch. For
example, basic gunnery, leadership, tactics from Army...kind of sending the
future leader off to get exposed to the common folks, get some skills, etc.,
become a better leader. Take a look at the (UK) Royal Family...

(4) Rewards for Heroism: In addition to medals, rewards for heroism might
include promotions or being sent to special service schools, e.g., a grunt
that gets a MCUF gets sent to commando school as she showed special
leadership under extreme circumstances, and displayed the initiative needed
by a commando...

(5) Rewards for Merchants: Let\'s face it, a merchant won\'t get a MCUF.
However, merchants should get something...let\'s say while serving on a ship,
a apprentice makes a really good deal. At the end of the term of service,
they might receive a cash bonus equal to x% of that deal they closed...

(6) Scouts: Another service that needs pumping up on rewards. Maybe exemplary
service would be rewarded with installment payments going towards your
retirement ship benefit...

which I enjoyed the read through.  I also got Anomalies, and I do not yet
have a strong opinion.  While parts of it looked good, there were two
points that really pushed my hot buttons.

I seem to recall a shouting match here recently ended up with people
generally deciding that the TL14 gear in EA was mostly good guesswork, or
the occasional differential tech level.  The consensus seemed to be that
there likely were not TL14 artifacts in the RoM, or that if there were,
they were way experimental devices a TL or more above what the planet knew
how to make.

(I know there will be no TL14 gear in the RoM in my own personal game.  I
am not going to play RCS in M0 by making the Rule of Man have regular
deposits of TL14 gear.)

I noted that in Anomalies, though, a major plot point was some recovered
TL14 gear, plus the hints that there were a lot more examples of it.  This
is not the occasional millennia old battered prototype, this was working
gear, and implications of even more of it.

I just hate that.

Yo, IG, if you want to make TL14 the RoM high point, feel free, but would
you mind telling us when it occurred?  The outlines I have seen do not give
a date for the RoM getting to TL14.  Also, could you put together a
writer\'s guide to tell all the people working in this stuff that this is/is
not common.  I cannot blame the authors, as Greg Porter put this in EA, and
was never told that this was incorrect by an official source, but this is a
consistency problem.

On another note, I seem to recall running across the term Starbase in
Anomalies, much like an official adventure in JTAS.  Given that the
official term is Starport, I am a bit vexed.  Once again, make an explicit
statement to the authors that this is not the Star Trek RPG, and that they
should at least get the terms right.

Fair enough.  I will state mine as an avid customer.  I also will try to
present a case for why IG needs to commit to errata and fixups.  Commit in
terms of actual money and contracts with designers AFTER the products ship.

Agreed, without reservation.  Life is a game of limited resources.

Yep.  In fact, this process is what makes the games better.  Every player
has a different take on what works, and what makes sense.  For example, I
find Traveller technology progression inherently silly, but I like to game
in and read books in that kind of universe.  As a result, I spend a fair
amount of time trying to make it make sense.  If you do not, then you will
tweak the system in other ways.

Each time a product comes out, heavy discussion ensues.  This leads to
better product.

There is an implied second half to that, which not under designer control -
getting improvements folded back into the master document.  For example,
look at M0.  This was a truly killer product.  It had lots of good detail,
a bunch of ideas, and then you got stabbed by having to use different data
that invalidated your own.  It also had a missing deckplan which was never
put up on the Web site.  These two issues are very different.  The second
is in the category of errata, and I suspect there is a good day worth of
such errata that you should put together at IG\'s behest - wording changes,
clarifications, and so on.  EVERY document has those, and it is usually not
a lot of work to put it together IF the publisher wants to.  What they
cannot do is pay you a flat fee, and then expect you to do this out of the
goodness of your heart - your skill is what you get paid for, and they
should be willing to pay the designer to use that skill for fixups.

Fixing the problems in M0 caused by FS data would take a lot longer.  At
that point, you need to consider a second product, and this is a completely
different thing.

When I refer to fixups, I am not talking about major rewrites, just
implementing the tweaks that you are well aware would be nice.  Resetting
it and rewriting major pieces might be nice, and is appropriate for a new
book, but this is a different idea - minor in-version revisions.  Some
publishers do them, and the quality of their products just goes up with
each release, as the standards get ever higher.

Now that we are clear on the scope of revision I am talking about, lets
move to PE, another very good supplement.  Despite having just gotten three
new supplements in the last week, I am still reading through PE, because I
find it very interesting, and I also find the core very solid.  Disagreeing
with the decision to base infrastruture cost on size, rather than pop, is a
quibble - the core flow seems to work about right.

...

Yes and no - whiny complaints about "shoulda done it that way" are of
little use, but there are only two groups out there we can talk to that
influence future products - designers and IG.  Designers listen, and also
often remember.  Designers are also the people who should be tapped to fix
anything, so it is our interest to get buy-in from the designer.

>  By the time the product is released, it\'s too 
>late for the designer to do anything about it.

It is too late for the designer to do anything about it for this release of
this product, but I have to hope that there will be other releases, columns
in JTAS, and re-releases of products with bits fixed up.  If IG products
are buy and forget, or only sell to someone who has not seen them, then
they are doomed.  Instead, IG needs products to be so good that after my
players read them, they want their own copy.  Pocket Empires, BTW had that
happen, as did Psi Institutes and Central Supply.  I expect the M0 campaign
will as well.

One way to do that is product iteration.  The publisher has to be willing
to contract after the fact for fixups, errata, and so on.  Assuming IG
wants to do this, then it is very important for us to make sure the
designers are willing to make the minor changes talked about, or at least
agree with what needs alteration.

...

>longer important; either the product stands up on its own, or it

>that.

The whys do matter, though.  If Marc feels that stat dominates skill, or
you feel that a class A starport costs a gazzilion CR for a pop 3 world,
then you have a reason, and if we know the reason, we still may disagree,
but at least then, it is in black and white.  Further, if it is a
contentious issue, like stat-skill tradeoffs, you can toss in a sidebar in
some revision that says "Stats are more important.", and then we have games
filled with wunderkids, or house rules, but at least then people do not
think the designers are doofuses.  They know you considered the issue, and
rejected it for a reason.

A system that fulfills the designer\'s goals is better than one that does
not.  A comment that the PE system does not work for more than a hundred
worlds because certain costs should be nonlinear, but are expressed
linearly for play purposes is enough to keep some of the wolves at bay, and
to encourage a JTAS article on nonlinear starports costs.

This, of course, assumes that what is written will become canonical.  That
people will refer to it in future products.  I think that should always be
the goal, and as designers, you need to have that goal.  You can only
really have it, though, if IG _also_ has it.  If they are committed to
always having the document for PE, second printing with folded in errata,
plus the errata itself, all contracted for from the designer, then you can
afford consistency.  If they do not, then it costs you money to be worried
about consistency.

>  The marketplace will determine whether that designer\'s work is 
>good, and, indeed, whether that designer will be allowed to continue 
>designing.  Either way, the message will be loud and clear.

It is never final, though.  If I do not like the skill system, and whine
about stat vs. skill, then there is a chance that a future product may be
designed taking my comments into account.  Further, future designers are
going to have at least heard my take on various issues.  They may not
agree, but they will certainly not be ignorant of it.

>To me, the right thing to do if one isn\'t happy with the rules as 
>published is to come up with something better, and share it around.

Agreed.  It is nice, though, if we feel that the fixes have a chance of
legitimacy, which JTAS and other IG organs should exist for.  For example,
if IG says straight out to you, the designer, that they are going to hire
you for a day, or a week, two months after the product ships for whatever
errata and changes you want to make, then it will make you that much more
likely to make use of some of these suggestions.  It also makes people
experiment with the system, if they know they might see the fixes they
liked in print, and perhaps got a mention.

Agreed, save for one point.  We are not consulted when the rules are coming
up for a revision, and it seems like they do not allot significant post
production time to the products for testing, and I believe that all
products do need testing.  This is not the designer\'s responsibility - they
have presumably already playtested what they can, and now it needs a
slightly larger test group that is not in direct contact with the designer.

Further, there is no process by which IG takes in such ideas post release
short of a JTAS article.  I do not think "Starports are proportional to
population" really has enough heft for a JTAS article, but it certainly
should be an issue that IG knows about, and that they have a process in
place to find out about opinion on it.

Anything that we, or you, can do to encourage IG in taking time and in
having new channels is a Good Thing.  It means that the older products
improve along with the newer ones, and that everyone\'s standards can go up.

Hopefully, the above was not seen as a flame, just a suggestion about how
IG could improve the lives of players, designers, and themselves.

	Some people tend to have the same level of intelligence throughout their
entire life, while others will increase it from the lower level as they get
older.

	Much of the increase I think is due to education, and so maybe EDU could
influence increases in a character\'s intelligence over the course of
reaching 18.

	Also, how about a separate rating for intelligence potential? This way, if
someone started off with a low INT score, then there is a possibility of it
increasing over time in a natural way. Maybe have a reverse of the aging
table for INT up to age 18, or roll below say INT minus age / 3 or some
other exotic formula to increase INT by a point. Or roll INT against
Difficult to increase, or something along these lines anyway.

	Marc:

	I have to agree with Kenneth and Chris on this one.  I\'ve GM\'ed
games using both the stock T4 system and Kenneth\'s system, and Kenneth\'s
wins hands down.  It presents major advantages over the T4 system in 2 main
areas: 1) it strikes a far better balance between skills and attributes,
and 2) it makes success at Impossible tasks much more improbable.

	This translates into a) more credible, fully fleshed characters, b)
a system that emphasizes roleplaying and not rollplaying, and c) more
credible event outcomes.  This makes for better games.

	I would strongly recommend Kenneth\'s system and hope that you\'ll
give it  the consideration it deserves for the fixed T4.

Joe understates things.  We spent approximately 25 hours a

it.  Not to mention the 20 hours or so a week revising and updating 
various draft versions of the rules in response to requests from the

We found one universal theme amongst the playtesters: there wasn\'t 
consensus on much more than that most of them thought it too complex, 
and esoteric.

I wish I could tell you the reason myself.  We tore our hair out on 
it.  I believe we came to the conclusion that Ni didn\' thin it 
necessarily have to mean that a world had no resources, just that 
they might have been untapped.  Ni means a world has moderate to low 
pop, amongst other things.  We also found our original table was 
unbalanced, and tweaked a few of the numbers to create balance.

Anyways, as a long answer to a short question, it is not an error.

avoid excessive skill levels.  


1)  During CharGen, any skill level awarded *beyond* level 4 counts for
only *half* a level.  For example, a character with Rifle-4 who receives
another level for Rifle goes to Rifle-4.5.  At the end of CharGen, any
"half" levels remaining are lost (i.e., if the character with Rifle-4.5
didn\'t get another level, bringing it up to Rifle-5, he\'d start play with
Rifle-4).  

(FWIW, this is the "house rule" I use in my TNE campaign.)  


2)  During CharGen, *double* the skill levels awarded, but record these as
"skill *points*" (not "skill *levels*").  At the end of CharGen, assign a
skill *level* for each skill based on the accumulated number of skill
*points* for that skill, as follows: 

        # of Skill      Actual Skill
        Points          Level
        1-2             1
        3-5             2
        6-9             3
        10-14           4
        15-20           5
        21-27           6
        28-35           7
        36-44           8
        45-54           9
        55+             10

(FWIW, anyone who plays TNE should recognize this as the number of
*experience* points needed to acquire the skill level in question.)


Anyway, these are just two possible "fixes."  :-)

That would be cool.  Hey, I can always use more money. <grin>  It\'d be 
really neat if they paid me for each item I fixed.  =)   But seriously, 
yeah, that\'d be great.  Say, 10% of the original design fee for a

product ships (to give time for the bugs to be found, collated, and fixes 
created).

This is true.  And, as I said at the release of PE, I do want to know 
what I did wrong.

But, personally, it does bug me when, after the designer (whether that be 
me or someone else) has explained why something was done a certain way, 
it\'s brought up again and again by the same person or group who were  
just answered.  That\'s really what I\'m objecting to.

That sort of behavior serves to drive designers away from the list, 
which is completely counter-productive for everyone involved.  I\'m not 
saying we should all drop down and worship the ground that Marc walks on, 
let alone show any deference to lesser mortals like me <grin>.  But, 
truly, when one\'s posts are greeted with negativity, it just makes one want 
to post less.  Conversely, when a response like yours comes 
along, it encourages conversation.  As a result of your well-thought-out 
and well-presented post, I\'ve taken what you\'ve said to heart.

In a sense, you\'re treating me like an equal, and that works very well.  
When I\'m treated like a parent who hasn\'t given his children what they 
want, or like a servant who hasn\'t performed to the master\'s 
specification, it doesn\'t work very well.  It just serves to distance 
designer from audience.

Definitely.  If that were the case, they wouldn\'t sell much beyond the 
main rulebook itself.  They - really, we; all of us - depend on repeat 
sales.  Thus, the ramped up quality of art, design, writing, and so on.  
It\'s clear that IG knows which side of the bread is buttered.  But, 
perhaps they haven\'t thought it out as fully as you have - I know I 
hadn\'t.

That\'s great to hear.  In the end, game design doesn\'t come down to much 
when compared to a million other pursuits.  But it does make me very 
happy to know that I\'m making at least a few people happier, at least for 
a little while. That\'s something I do not get in my day job.  I\'ve always 
wanted to make something I could point to, and now I am.  That part is 
really, really great.

It sounds like a good idea.  Of course, I don\'t know all the particulars 
of publishing games, but I do have occasional contact with those who do.  
I\'ll try to bring it up sometime, when it\'s politic to do so.

Setting aside for the moment the question of whether these things matter, 
I am struck once again by the difference email makes.  Most of us played 
for years and years and years, without have any clue about the why\'s of 
the various design decisions.  Either they worked for us or they didn\'t, 
and that was all.  Truly, we live in an amazing age.

To return to your point, it would be nice to be able to explain why 
decisions were made, but I can\'t say that every designer will have the 
time to do so in all instances.  Even given that every time such a post 
were made, the responses were well worded, most designers spend all their 
time designing.  Again, we get back to the limits on resources.  

Heck, some days I run through TML, deleting messages like mad, because I 
know: 1) I don\'t have the time to read any message that\'s not of prime 
importance, and 2) Even if I let them pile up from day to day, I\'m never 
going to have time to go through them all.  Some days I can read every 
message, other days I can\'t.  If I respond to every inquery on my work, 
I\'d never meet a deadline.  (Although, you\'ll note that I\'m pretty poor 
at ignoring messages that are important to me; I\'ve sworn off TML three 
times to day, promising myself to do nothing but design; yet here I am.  
I\'m on vacation from my day job, and had hoped to get a ton of design

It\'s funny how that works...the assumption of, er, doofushood. <G>  
Guilty until proven innocent?  Hmmm.  I\'m not pointing any fingers; heck, 
I know that\'s my reaction as well, most of the time.  It\'s just 
interesting how our minds work.

I agree.

True; again, mostly what I intended to object to was the attitude. Not 
the fact of criticism, but the way in which it is expressed.

In essence, I agree with you; but I do have doubts about people failing 
to test things just because they think no one else will ever know about 
it.  I think we gamers are terminal fiddlers. <G>  But, yeah, knowing 
that one\'s work has a chance of being ...er... canonized <shudder> would 
tend to make one go the extra mile.

This is true, and I\'d like to point out that IG has made great strides in 
this area.  The first products either got no or seemingly no 
playtesting.  Later products had hurried playtesting, due to the scramble 
for getting the schedule caught up.  Current products are undergoing lots 
and lots of playtesting.  All in contact with the designers, of course, 
so that does fall short of your suggestion.  But, at least things are 
improving.  And your suggestion is another one I can try to mention to 
The Powers That Be, when opportunity presents itself.

I saw it as you intended it.  Again, well done.  And thank you.

An excellent point has been made here, and I\'d like to add my Cr 0.02

In the old days, few roleplaying products were re-released or revised 
with regularity. Sure, you\'d have new editions, with different mechanics 
after a few years, but the only "tweaking" that was done was done in the 
gaming mags - JTAS, Dragon, Challenge, et al. And most of the mags 
countained adventures or source material (which is good).

With the communication powerhouse we see today (the \'net), the temptation 
is there to change the gaming cycle to more of a software programming 
one, with regular updates and bug fixes. (the \'iterative\' cycle you speak 
of)

I\'m of two minds on this, I\'m happy that IG had the good sense to fix 
things that are clearly broken, ie. get a revised Deluxe rulebook out, 
and that Marc\'s been kind enough to let us in on all the good stuff he\'s 
doing. I\'m excited that quality products such as PE can be tweaked 
"officially" with the original designer\'s input, and these tweaks and 
optional rules can be distrubuted on the web. 

OTOH, if Joe, Stu, et al. spend all there time tweaking and explaining 
themselves, they\'ll never get any new projects done and out the door!

In the end, it\'s a juggling act. I think with clearly innovative and 
popular products such as PE, time *should* be spent hashing out those 
fixes and rules options we crave. Input from the designers is desirable.

Patience is key, though, let\'s give these guys time to make new stuff too!

I guess the final reasoning will remain a mystery, a victim of burned out

As an aside, one of my favorite authors once mentioned that he would 
spend a day or so researching a particular subject for his novel, write 
what was necessary, then be shocked later on to realize that a day\'s 
worth of research resulted in only a paragraph or two.  I now know how he 
felt.

I\'ve actually made pretty extensive use of them. 
In my particular version of the Imperium, Bwaps are
quite widespread, possibly even edging out Vargr
for "Most Populous and Extensive Nonhumans in
Imperial Space." They tended to get bit-NPC
parts (warehouse staff, brokers, traders, 
low-level officials, the odd ship crew), but
they were a regular part of the landscape my
players had to deal with.

Ael Yael, Virushi, and others show up, about
one in ten NPCs is a minor race alien.
For the most part the play the same roles
as any other NPCs -- patrons, informants, 
red herrings, obstcles, etc. -- but my players 
have commented that they liked the way it added
to the "atmosphere" and helped keep them guessing.

Example: the players are having a "meet" with
someone in a public park. Two large creatures
are flying nearby, doing acrobatics and catching
thermals from a small escarpment. At one point one
of them passes overhead and the players can make out
that it\'s wearing some variant of an IISS uniform:
they finally recognize the creatures are not local
fauna but a minor race from towards the Imperial core
- -- the Ael Yael, they think.  Whoever they are, 
will their presence spoil the meet? And the Scouts 
could be interested in this -- what if they\'re here
to spy, or distract (players look around suspiciously)...

characters excessively high levels in skills.

I suggest the following tweak: during chargen, whenever a
character gains a skills, make him/her roll the current skill
level or more on a D6. Failure means that skill level remains
the same.

Current  | You need 
Level    | a D6 of
- ----
   0     |   0+ (Auto)
   1     |   1+ (Auto)
   2     |   2+ (83%)
   3     |   3+ (67%)
   4     |   4+ (50%)
   5     |   5+ (33%)
   6     |   6+ (16%)
   7     |   7+ (Impossible)

So gaining Lev 1 or 2 in a skill is still automatic, but from
Lev 3 onward chances get lower and lower.

This is similar to the current Experience system, but less prone
to abuse and reasonably fast for use during chargen.

It is still possible (but less probable) to gain an high
proficience in a given skill, but I think that players would try
to gain more skills at 2-3 instead that a few 5+ skills.

This is still largely untested (I don\'t need to roll up new
chars, for now), but I\'d like to hear your comments.

BTW, sorry if this has already been suggested by someone else. I\'m a little
late in readung the digests.

I have to agree with Kenneth.  I started playing CT, and I liked the 
way that skills were more important to success at tasks than 
attributes were, once the skill got above 3 or so.  And the higher 
the skill was, the more heavily it weighed in the success 
equation.(e.g. A character with a high attribute might have a +2 die 
modifier.  With a skill of 2, the attribute contributed 1/2 of the 
total die modifier.  But with a skill of 4, the attribute 
contributed only 1/3 of the total modifier.)

IMHO, the emphasis on skills gave CT a flavor which seems absent from 
T4.  Emphasis on skills gives more of a science-_fiction_ feel to the 
game.  Emphasis on attributes gives more of a feel of 
science-_fantasy_ or space opera, where the heroic character with 
high enough stats can do _everything_ well.  I play Traveller because 
I want to play science-fiction, not science-fantasy.

Please consider reworking the T4.1 task rules to give greater 
emphasis to skills rather than attributes.

Just my cr.02.  YMMV.

I\'ve just started in on Pocket Empires (delivered to New Zealand in just
two weeks or so) and I think that a very good job has been done.

I look forward to any other modified rules that may be suggested but it
is just a game and if it models sufficiently well (and it appears to)
then I will be happy.

I\'ve seen a couple of ideas to limit the number of skills awarded in 
T4 and T4.1.

The best way to handle this is also the simplist.  Up in the box on 
the character-gen page where continuance and injury rolls are 
indicated, put in one simple roll--

- --a roll for a skill that the player rolls each year.

No other changes are necessary.  This is exactly like the rolls 
required in the advanced chargen systems in CT and MT.

"You want a skill this year, make your roll of 5-".

It\'s a simple as that.  Different careers could have different skill 
target numbers--adding to the player\'s decision on which career he 
would like his character to go.

Just one line detailing a skill roll is all that is needed for each 
of the careers in T4.1.

You are doing such a fine job on the T4.1 revised book (I mean 
that--an incredible job that is much more than I expected), it pains 
me to think about you going ahead with the broken task system that is 
supposed to be an improvement over the official one we have now.

I really care about Traveller, and I want to see it be the best it 
can.  I\'d like to see T4.1 be the definitive Traveller game system.

Given that, I am forced, out of my devotion to the game, to make one 
final plea for you to reconsider the task system.

I will detail here everything that I can see wrong with your T4 fix 
in support of my case.

Please, please consider what I have to say.

==========================================================

Here goes...

First off,  the attribute vs skill issue:  T4 is weighted too 
heavily against stats.  Skills have a minor part in a character\'s 
success at a task throw.  These should be equally weighted.

Stats govern a character\'s general/natural ability.  Skills govern 
the character\'s expertise in a specific area.

To illustrate the problem in T4, follow me on an example.

You\'re overweight, smoking too much, not exercising enough, and 
eating fatty foods.  Walking down the street one day, you collapse on 
the sidewalk.  The EMT\'s are called, and you are carted off via 
ambulance back to the hospital.  It is clear that you have had a 
heart attack.

The EMT that takes care of you in the ambulance is a smart cookie.  
He knows his job, and he did well in school--yet he is only an EMT.

At the hospital, you\'ve got a veteran heart specialist there, ready 
to operate on you.  He\'s been doing this for years and you would be 
his 400th bypass operation--yet, in med school, he was an average 
student.

Now, here\'s the 5 mega-credit question:  Who would you rather have 
operate on you--the EMT or the veteran heart specialist?

No, really.  With whose hands would you rather place your life?

There is really no question about it.  I\'d be surprised if anybody 
could sincerely pick the EMT.

With respect to T4, the EMT would have Medical-1 and the veteran 
heart specialist would have Medical-4.

Now, let\'s add in their respective educations.  The doctor was 
average, we\'ll give him an EDU-6.  The EMT is an up and commer--we\'ll 
give him an EDU-10.

Do you see what I\'m getting at here?  

Under the T4 rules, as they now stand, the EMT would be a better 
choice to perform the bypass operation.  The doctor would have a T4.1 
target number of 10 whereas the EMT would have a target number of 11.

There\'s something inherently wrong with that.  

The problem is that we are dealing with two different scales.  Stats 
range from 1-15 with 7 being average human ability.  Skills range 
from 0-6 with 2 being an average skill.

In order to balance the two scales, we must somehow increase the 
benefit that skill brings to the target number.

Under KBv2.0, the problem is eliminated.  The doctor has a target 
number of 18 whereas the EMT has a target number of 13.  The EMT is 
still benefiting (vastly) from his way above average EDU, but it is 
not enough to put him in the same league with a veteran heart 
specialist (who is at skill level 4).

This, to me, is the single biggest problem with the T4.1 task system, 
and this needs to be corrected before the new book comes out.

Use KBv2.0.  Make up your own system--I don\'t care.  Just please 
address this issue.  There\'s a real problem here--problem number one 
with the T4.1 task system.

================================================================

OK, I\'ve got some other problems with the task system that you are 
putting into T4.1.

Another area that I have a problem with is how SF is rolled.  In your 
system, a roll of 3 sixes is required to roll SF.  Look at the 
table below, and you will see that this is not a good rule given the 
difficulty codes you have chosen.

Difficulty        Dice        SF Possible?
=======       =====      ==========
Easy             1D            No
Average       2D            No
Difficult         2.5D         No
Formidable    3D           Yes
Staggering    4D           Yes
Impossible     5D           Yes


Shouldn\'t SF be possible on Difficult throws?  On Average throws?  I 
can see the Easy category being exempt from SF, and I have no problem 
with this.  But SF should definitely be possible on Average and 
Difficult throws.

This is problem number two with the T4.1 task system.

=============================================================

Now, let\'s look at SS.  It is logical to me that the chance of SS 
should get smaller the harder a task becomes.

If you are rolling an Easy task, you should have a better chance of 
rolling SS than if you are rolling an Impossible task.

In your T4.1 task system, this is completely backwards.  Since 
anytime 3 ones are rolled, a SS result is indicated, and we roll more 
dice the harder the task becomes, it is easier to roll SS given an 
Impossible task in T4.1 vs. rolling SS on a Difficult task.

This needs to be reversed in T4.1.  It should be harder to roll SS 
the harder a task becomes.

This is problem number three with the T4.1 task system.

===============================================================

Speaking of SS, we have the same problem here that we did with SF.

Take a look at this chart:

Difficulty       Dice        SS Possible?
=======      ====       ============
Easy             1D          No
Average       2D         No
Difficult         2.5D      Yes
Formidable    3D         Yes
Staggering    4D         Yes
Impossible    5D          Yes



Does it make sense to you that SS is possible on Impossible task 
throws and not on the easiest there is to attempt--Easy task throws?  
Or, even Average task throws?

There is a definite inequity here, and this is problem number 4 with 
the T4.1 task system.

============================================================

Then, we\'ve got the half die.  Some people think that this is 
nit-picking, but I believe that we should fix everything about the T4 
task system as long as we are re-writing  and re-publishing it.

Why include a necessary evil (and a very unpopular choice) when it is 
not necessary?

I\'ve proved with KBv2.0 that a vialble T4 like task system can be 
created that uses only whole die.

We don\'t need the unpopular half die.  Let\'s get rid of it.

This is problem number 5 with the T4.1 task system.

===============================================================

Well, there you go, Marc--five logical reasons to re-think the T4.1 
task system.  

KBv2.0 fixes all of these problems, uses whole dice, involves simple 
addition--just like your system, and produces good percentages of 
success.

But, don\'t use KBv2.0.  I\'d be just as happy if you fixed all of 
these problems with another system.

I just want to see T4.1 be the best--not broken again.  You\'ve got a 
golden opportunity here to fix these problems before it is too late 
and T4.1 is published.

That\'s one of the functions of this list, isn\'t it?  To point out 
what can be done better?

Isn\'t that why you posted your chargen system recently?

Please consider this, Marc.  From the bottom of my heart, I want T4 
to be incredible--not flawed.

Sincerely,

Kenneth.

	In a 1989 issue of Traveller\'s Digest, there was an article named
"Children in MegaTraveller", with fairly detailed rules for 
generating underage characters. They assumed EDU depended on INT. In 
other words, an intelligent child was more curious and more likely to 
want to learn something new.

- ----Delurk section

	Hello all!

	I finally got to subscribe to TML (my previous attempts failing for 
reasons unknown), and despite my unfamiliarity with T4 I (apparently) 
couldn\'t keep my mouth shut.

	Bear with me. :)

	I\'ve been playing Traveller since \'87: I started with the 1st ed.
MegaTraveller (never played CT, actually), and when TNE hit the 
stores I started to develop my game into another direction, using 
GURPS rules with FFS/Brilliant Lances.

	I\'ve been lurking with the HIWG for quite some time, but due to the
fact that 98% of the material I come up with is incompactible with
current rules set (whether TNE or T4) I never really got around to 
properly delurk there.

	So here!

	I\'ve been doing some Traveller-related artwork for local gaming 
magazines and SF zines for some years (if anyone on the list gets 
"Magus" magazine, my piece is on the cover of their latest issue), 
and am now in the process of (finally) going through T4 rules and 
preparing a con game at RoPeCon\'97.

	(Advance notice: I\'ll probably have some Traveller art online later
- - I\'ll drop a note on the list then).

	As I mentioned earlier, in my own game I use GURPS rules. 
"GURPS/Traveller: Silk Vector" is now running for the 3rd year, and 
started off in 5656 AD (1135 Imp., virus-free); my earlier campaign, 
"Traveller: Albeense One" ran from 1990 to 1993 (1117-1121 Imp.). 
Both were located in the Neworld sector.


	5656 AD / 1135 Imp. - What\'s going on?

	The 2nd Civil War ("The Rebellion") ended with the release of a 
computer virus that wiped out what little fleets Lucan and Dulinor 
had in the Dagudashaag/Zarushagar/Massilia area. The virus never got 
around to do any serious harm to other factions.

	Lucan was finally driven off the Iridium Throne by a military 
coup lead by Admiral van Tazlin. However, van Tazlin failed to hold 
power for longer than a few weeks; a re-run of the Emperors of Flag 
ensued, which ended in the unthinkable disaster. In 1132, 
Capital/Core was raided by the Vargr.

	Into this chaos moved Margaret. With IRIS and the Moot backing up 
her claim of fostering Strephon\'s child, and with a relatively 
unharmed navy, she had little trouble assuming the Throne. The Third 
Imperium now controls Delphi, Old Expanses, Fornast and Core 
sectors, as well as small portion of Massilia, Diaspora, Hinterworlds 
and Glimmerdrift Reaches.

	I\'ve yet to come up with how Archduke Norris of Deneb will react to 
this turn of events. Also, the fate of Antares remains unknown. 
Daibei and Ilelish are still around, both independent states. And 
then there\'s the Hivers (like someone said: Curiosity killed the cat 
- - the Hiver took notes). :)


	Solomani Confederation

	By 1125, the Solomani forces were spread wafer-thin across Daibei, 
Magyar, Diaspora, Sol, Old Expanses and Alpha Crucis sectors. The 
battles of 1119-1120 had already inflicted terrible damage on the 
Confederation Navy, and many of the member-states (especially in the 
rimward-trailing area) complained vocally how their trading suffered 
with the Navy not being there to keep piracy in check.

	Meanwhile, the conservative/centrist elements of Solomani Party 
pushed for a more centralized interstellar government. Couldn\'t have 
chosen a worse moment. In 1126, the first member-states split off; by 
1130, when the New Charter was signed, about 450 systems in Neworld 
and Aldebaran decided to decline.

	The Solomani Assembly did not have a Navy to wage war to regain its 
lost territories. Instead, it resorts - even today - to black 
operations and various kinds of "new manhattan projects" to return 
the independent Terran ("Solomani" being a highly unpopular term 
these days) states back under Terran rule.


	Most of the push of the campaign is directed rimward, with the new
states of Federated Suns, Drennys Treaty and others looking for new
resources and trade contacts; also, the Imperium in trying to form
diplomatic and economic ties with the splinter states. For a
real life equivalent, think of the former Soviet Union and it\'s 
former "member-states".

	Anybody interested in learning more of the campaign background, or 
if anyone has any thoughts or feedback on the ideas I\'ve developed, 
you\'re more than welcome to mail me (privately, since I think this 
is too off-topic for the list).

the following system (apologies if it\'s already been suggested):

Roll 1D for each skill level, then add the appropriate attribute.

e.g. Computer-3 using Intelligence of 8 would give a 3D6+8 roll.

(This should drastically re-balance the attribute-vs.-skill imbalance of the
current system)

Difficulty levels would be something like:

Simple          7
Average         9
Difficult       12
Formidable      16
Staggering      22

would be: average 18.5, lowest 11, highest 26; ok so these might need
adjustment upwards)

Problems?

(Ok, I just realised that if you take off the attribute, you\'re pretty much
copying the Star Wars system)

Rolling high is good, which is usually intuitive to new players (although on
the other hand I\'ve had no problems whatsoever teaching the current system
to new players).

Critical success is if you roll any 1s AND exceed the required roll.

(So hopefully this counters the possibility of someone rolling all sixes and
only just meeting the target number but somehow then achieving a critical
success. Hmmm. Nope, probably doesn\'t work - Mr. Computer above would get an
awful lot of critical successes!)

Critical failure is if you roll 2 or more 1s AND fail the required roll.

(Not sure if 2 or more 6s would be better, but it seemed counter-intuitive
for a high roll to be bad...)

Anyway, there\'s a bit more fuel for the task system \'fire\'...

(Oh and it\'s totally anti-canon of course).

Anyone care to calculate all the percentage successes and all that? Just out
of interest?

        TWO adventures in Anomalies use TL 14-15 from the RoM. The two are
from Steve Miller. In another adventure of Steve Miller, he confuses the
Droyne with the Draysaskin, seeming to imply that there are no Droyne in the
universe... moreover, he postulates a surviving Draysaskin, but ***canon***
(flame retardant suit on) state that Grandfather killed them all (he kept
careful count). The confsion makes me think he is new to Traveller...

>I just hate that.

        Me too. But there are already Three supplements making direct or
indirect references to TL14-15 in the RoM, so it\'s starting to become a
major canon change.
        Obviously, Steve Miller was just given EA and CSC, and he based his
adevntures on that material, which leads to the errors. I cannot blame him,
but...

Six (Hiver) hands up here. :)  The best thing I like about M.A.s is that
it is a way of keeping those players who _read everything_ off balance.
It is afterall, something of my own creation, unless I am using one
from the pubs.

The best "trick" I\'ve ever developed for my game was in designing
minor aliens.  I used the "Animal Tables" from the Basic CT books
(or Trav Book) and fleshed out an intermittent/filter, or chaser/
pouncer, or what have you, and the tables even gave me things like
size, etc.

The one I had the most fun with was something like a 1200 Kg Escargot,
that had gotten J-drive from my RoM Terrans on the Rim, and were now,
after all those years, TL15 like most civilised places.  Their ships
were spheres, and their vacc suits left a synthetic molecular formula
lubrication, simulating their own natural slime-trails.  Oh yeah, they
had little patience, being "slug-like", they had _really_ adapted to
a tech way of life.  Their ships were usually 6G, and the players
never (until now) figured out that the aliens whom they were going to
rendevous with in the system, had gotten tired of waiting and went into
Jump.

The character sheet could even have a space for the final task number by

Also, I hate the idea of having to roll for skills every years or term or
anything else.  That system is quite unfair.  One PC in the party may make
85% of their rolls (I\'ve seen this happen) while another may only make 35%
of their rolls.  For the same # of terms served, one PC ends up with 2.5
as many skills.  I always loathed this in CT\'s advanced char gen. Maybe
you could limit skills to level 6 (an easy to remember number in Traveller)
during char gen.  Doing this allows folks to have the same number of skills

A shameless (sort of commercial) plug -- Dark Star #1 has a complete 
alternative character generation system that does away *completely* 
with rolling for skills on tables -- but which limits the acquisition 
of skills in a realistic way though still allowing player *choice*.

Its a neat little system, even if I do say so myself!

Unfortunately, print copies are no longer available, only electronic 
format ones are -- Adobe .pdf format (must have Acrobat Reader V3).
Cost? US$5 for me to email it as an approx. 500k attachment -- or 
US$7 to have it mailed on disk.

The only realistic way to send money, depending on response, is 
either to me as US$ notes in the mail *or*, if there\'s only a few 
interested, I have a US contact that will take US$ cheques and put 
them toward my account for something else.

If you are worried about sending money to someone "blind", well, ask 
around, everyone who\'s ordered DS has received it -- even if the 
money seems to have gone adrift in the mail.

I\'m not one to make \'me too\' posts usually, but I just have to agree. The
TL14 gear in CSC and EA can be handwaved away, the stuff in Anomalies
can not. The equipment in \'Lock and Loot\' is so far out of canon its not
funny. This adventure is a major revision of history. I can live with a
TL 13 RoM, hey I even like the idea; but I just can\'t live with a TL 14
one. It just violates too much previous history. For \'Lock and Loot\' to
work, a major portion of the RoM would have had to achieved a
consistant TL 14. This just doesn\'t fit with previously published
material.

An impassoned plea to IG and all T4 game designers:
Please please please don\'t do this. It just doesn\'t work. If the Terran
Confederation was TL 12 when they took over the Ziru Sirka they
could have reached TL 13, but they just couldn\'t have reached TL 14.
They would not have been able to spare the resources. They were
trying to hold together a collasping Empire with a massive and
overwhelming technological inertia. I don\'t think anyone who plays
Traveller wants to see the RoM turned into some great treasure hunt.
I can accept the occassional (heavy emphasis on the occcassional)
piece of TL 13 gear, maybe even a tiny bit of TL 14 (like a TL 14
battery on TL 13 equipment). But this is not the Traveller I know
and love. This is a dungeon crawl. One of the biggest attractions of
Traveller is it\'s consitant background, all this TL 14 RoM loot is
directly attacking that consistancy.

I mean that the quantity Infrastructure, as defined in PE, is *not* 
proportional to population.  It represents a combination of a) extent 
and b) depth of infrastructure provision.

In RL, I agree with you.  Under normal circumstances, anyway.

Here we are looking at a situation where worlds may be being 
developed with the purpose of becoming populous and hence lucrative, 
so costs to increase infrastructure "from outside" may well reflect 
that goal.

I agree that it is far more realistic to make Infrastructure a 
function of population.  I might do it.  You can too.  But that\'s not 
how it\'s defined in PE.

Yes, I know.

Perhaps you could treat it as a capital investment, so as to provide 
a certain level of infrastructure whatever the population.  The RUs 
are tied up rather than used; this could represent dedicating 
planetary output to manufacturing infrastructure improvements as well 
as funding the improvement.

Which in fact is probably a viable thing to do.  You\'ve just imported 
an underclass to do the scut-work for low wages (but high by their 
previous standards) while the effete original population do their 
high-tech manufacturing/processing/data entry/whatever.

Of course, the referee will manufacture social problems from this raw 
material, but it seems rather tempting nonetheless...

You mean, apart from the fact that you can improve infrastructure 
a.s.a.p. on the cheap, and watch your profits soar as population 
increases?  Hmmm.  Not in my PEs.

Improving infrastructure is a huge capital investment.  Take 
railways: the cost of all that track, the factories to make trains 
and spare parts, signalling, timetabling equipment 
(computers/printing) and so forth.  The cost of this is not 
proportional to population, either: if you want 200 miles of railway 
track, it will cost you a fixed amount.  If your sparsely-settled 
world is a series of mining camps (say), this may be your only 
option.  As population expands, it may only increase the size of the 
linked communities -- no more track is needed.  More rolling stock 
is, of course, but that could be funded out of infrastructure 
maintainance, or seen as an operating cost in effect.

Here are some possible "one-time" infrastructure improvements on 
similar lines:

Canals (TL 2+)
Road   (TL 1+)
Rail   (TL 4+)
Cable links (TL 4+)  -- telegraph, fibre-optic, whatever

The basic point is that once a system exists, new structures can 
connect to it (new stations, more cables along existing lines).  
Infrastructure cost is made up of a) initial system costs and b) 
investment for expansion of the system.

There are also projects with a high unit cost which are 
disproportionately expensive for a small population, like dams which 
store water and generate hydro power -- fixed cost to ship that back 
to civilisation, too -- or nuclear/fusion poweplants.

I accept your general point about infrastructure, but I hold that 
these counterexamples weaken it to the point where "absolute 
infrastructure" isn\'t such an impossible abstraction.

To be honest, I think once you have a single starport to attract 
traffic, additional starports represent infrastructure.

Of course, that *is* realistic, which is your other concern...

The far-future planners building an empire in isolation, who can\'t 
afford the upkeep of military units yet.  The incredibly well-armed.  
Those with population redeployment projects on the go.

I think things are broken at the low population end, but you can 
solve this by making a Low or Medium effort colonisation attempt on a 
lowish pop planet.  This will increase infrastructure and population 
rather more cheaply...

This is more or less what PE says, in effect.  It allows the attempt, 
but it\'s expensive.

I disagree.  A few million could be a thousand mines, or a thousand 
farms, over the whole surface of the planet, all linked by rudimetary 
roads and optical cables.

Which may not be inaccurate, at one mine per resource and roads 
between all communities; the size of your cities may vary.

And see my colonisation tip above for pop 1-4 worlds.

Not sure I understand.  Is Inf proportional to planet size?  Not
unreasonable if so; a size 10 planet has 100 times the surface area
of a size 1 rock, so 10 times the infrastructure cost isn\'t silly. 
(A size 1 planet has problems of its own, and may well need orbital
habitats for its surplus poulation.)

This would be a nice side-effect of the proportional improvement

Well, there\'s a correlation.  If it\'s suddenly easier to attract 
traders (B starport), there\'s an incentive to upgrade local 
facilities to supply the starport.  Even a military base will take on 
supplies from the local population, whose space infrastructure will 
improve.  The main port may even want auxilliary landing sites.

It\'s 8 p.m. (or is it later?) central which is about 2 a.m. GMT and 1 
a.m. in the UK.

It\'s not that I\'m not interested, it\'s just that I sleep at night...

I disagree. I would rule that a TL13+ ship could undergo minor repairs in
a TL12 starport. These repairs would be simple jury rigs and would need to
be further completed in a fully equiped starport of the equivalent tech
level. This would allow players who have just emerged for a very
devastating space battle to patch up their ship so that they won\'t be
destroyed in their next unfortunate encounter. Mind you, in my campaign,
my players just don\'t seem to be able to get the brakes repaired on their
Far Trader. I may just use this rule to keep the brakes broken for a
little while longer (if I ever actually let my players get them fixed).

Yes, but as stated in the rules Resources in NOT a measure of the worlds
ability to exploit its resources but the amount/purity of resources that
are there. It is your infrastructure and TL that determine what amounts
that you are able to dig up. The only argument I can come up with for In +2
Resources is that high Resource worlds tend to develop into In worlds. IMHO
either Resources should be independent on trade classes that deal with
population or that In should give the world a -2, NonIn a +1 and LowPop or
Barren a +2 - all this reflecting how much resources have been exploited
and therefore reducing the amount left (those arguing that high TL worlds
could recycle their resources have a point but then most worlds would be
self sufficient in resources and the reason for empires/PE etc vanishes).

I quite like Ken\'s KBv2.0.  However, here\'s another suggestion which 
eliminates those half-dice and feels a bit like MT, while being a bit 
more flexible, I hope.


Proposed new weighting: stat/3 (round down) + skill

Stat bonus ranges from 0-5, average character will have +2
Skills are such that experts will have level 3 or so

Stat.  DM
 1-2    0
 3-5   +1
 6-8   +2
 9-11  +3
12-14  +4
15+    +5

Average character has +3 (2 stat, 1 skill)
Pro character has +5 (2 stat, 3 skill)

Ken\'s example of med trainee has Edu 12, skill 1 = +5 whereas the 
brain surgeon would have Edu 9 (college) skill 4 = +7 or even if he 
had Edu 6 he would be +6, better than the trainee.

Scores would range from +0 to +12, in practice, with anything above
+8 being intensely rare.

Tasks:

Trivial (auto / 2D-2 unskilled)
Simple (1D-1)
Routine (2D-2)
Difficult (3D-3)
Formidable (4D-4)
Impossible (5D-5)

Target number = score (skill + stat/3) + DMs

Results:

Spectacular success if roll < skill
Success if roll < target
Marginal success/failure if roll = target
Failure if roll > target
Spectacular failure if 2 or more 6s rolled

Spectacular success and failure is only possible for Difficult (3D-3) 
or harder tasks; 

This scale is designed to have a roughly 50/50 success rate for 
different sorts of characters:

Task    50/50 chance for
1D-1    Average (stat 7, skill 1)
2D-2    Professional (stat 7, skill 3)
          or Talented (stat 12, skill 1)
3D-3    Talented Professional (Stat 9, skill 4-5)
4D-4    Superb (Stat 12, Skill 6)
5D-5    Overblown (Stat 15, Skill 8)

Many tasks can be performed slowly and carefully, with access to 
appropriate reference materials or advice, at one level of difficulty 
lower.  This does not apply to aimed fire from weapons, which gains a 
bonus based on weapon range.

For example, emergency medicine is fast and furious, and time is of 
the essence until a patient is stabilised.  After that, a slower 
procedure may be attempted to improve the patient\'s condition.
Thus: stabilise a patient, (3D-3), Medical or First Aid, Dex.
To diagnose damage: (3D-3) Medical, Edu
To improve condition: (3D-3) Medical, Dex (surgery) / Edu (drugs)

or if there\'s no time, it\'s going to be harder:
To improve condition (no prep): (4D-4), Medical, Dex/Edu
Only the best can do this...


Possible tweaks:

Change weighting of stat from stat/3 to stat/4 round down or stat/5 
round up (the latter being the MT task DM).

Change spectacular success criterion from roll < skill to
roll < skill *or* roll < stat.  IMO unless you\'re highly skilled, 
you\'re never going to succeed spectacularly well.

Remove "Simple" category; assume all tasks worth rolling for are 
moderately difficult to the skilled practitioner.


Any feedback welcome.

Shig and Rebin Empire, or thought that the matriarchal system in Rebin was
the cause of the one in Shig, or was it simple coincidence?

        Government code 6 has always posed some problems for me, and some of
them are reappearing as I go through the FS data (I read lists of UWPs for
fun...)
        In principle, most of the times, a 6 means the world is being held
captive by another (nearby) world, and thus the O:nnnn code in the trade
codes area. Captive means it is either a colony or a conquered planet.
        But, then, the owner should have the possibility of maintaining a
colony or winning a war. Namely, the owner should have advantages over the
captive:
        1) If captive means colony: Owner has more population, better TL,
better starport (or, at least, not two levels worse).
        2) If captive means captured: Owner has some good advantage, e.g.
much more advanced technology, much bigger population, etc.

        The problem is that, in the FS data, there are captive worlds with B
starport, TL A, surrounded by D/E starports with TL 6-, almost all Barren.
This is not a flaw of FS, I think this kind of situation has always happened
in Traveller data.

        So, there are captive worlds that cannot be reasonably held captive
by their neighbors... but, anyway, the rules always states 6=Captive
government, no government by neighbors.

        And, so, the question: Which kind of Gov=6 planets have people
detailed? I.e., which kind of explanations have been made when the "neighbor
owner" does not work? In Milieu 1100, I\'ve recurrently used the
Megacorporations, but for a world deep into the Gashda in M:0, it does not
look good.
        Explanations such as little corporations, military/merc units, etc,
do not seem to give Gov=6. If a Corporation owns the planet but is of small
size, i.e., the planet is its main asset, the Gov=1. If a Merc unit goes
rogue and takes the planet, well, they are there and they are the
government, so Gov=B, or F, or whatever, but not 6.

        Suggestions? Flames? Comments?

What I like about the higher tech gear in the EA is that it can be used
by people like me who are running their campaign in the 1100\'s.

Maybe IG should still include these higher tech things in their
products, but put them in a 1100\'s appendix.

That way, everybody is happy.

    'body' => 'Hi, I\'ve been lurking for a couple of weeks now and since I\'ve finally
managed to figure out how to post to the list I though I\'d kick off with
a couple of points related to PE.

Firstly. Is the fact that TL0 worlds always have a GWP of zero RUs
intentional? If this is the case then why list the costs for TL0
military units (at several gazillion RUs each), when such worlds will
never have the RUs to buy them?

Secondly. I\'ve been following the population versus size infrastructure
debate with some interest. Whilst I think that the population people
have made some good points, I think I favour having some aspect of
population to factor in to the calculation. So how about distinguishing
between base infrastructure and effective infrastructure in the same way
that resources distinguishes between the base level (potential) and the
available level (effective)?

Base infrastructure is bought at a fixed price, determined by the size
of the planet (since surface area has some obvious implications for
infrastructure development) and is used to calculate the infrastucture
maintenance cost for the world. Some kind of cap linked to available
resources (similar to what already exists in the rules) should apply to
the base. Since the population digit of a world is essentially a
logarithmic number how about subtracting this figure from base
infrastructure to arrive at effective infrastructure? This would
represent the division of infrastructure amongst the population. You can
then specify that no world should be able to have an effective
infrastructure higher than their TL (as in the original rules).

I think this adds very little complexity (its similar to, but simpler
than, the existing Resources mechanic). It models the decline in
infrastructure that should occur when a LoPop world gets nominated for
the PEs invountary colonisation programme and permits PEs to overspend
on base resources that are inefficiently used (presumably in preparation
for all those involuntary colonists that are going to be arriving Real
Soon Now). It allows PEs to develop low population, high infrastructure
colonies that are a (hopefully) a paying proposition, but still
penalises low pop worlds by imposing a relatively high cost for base
infrastructure development (the pop 10 capital only needs to have five
more BI points than its pop 5 colony to get the same EI, even though its
GWP will be five orders of magnitude greater than the colony\'s; all
other factors being equal). I originally thought of applying the LF
divisor to BI in order to calculate EI, but that produced enormous
variations in results for worlds at the extremes of the range, which I
didn\'t feel were warranted.

The only downside is that I\'m not sure how to extend it to big ticket
items such as starports and the like. The obvious first step is to have
a table of starport costs based upon population, but this raises the
possibility of a PE buying a cheap A-port at pop 5 before ramping
population up to 9 or 10. Perhaps particular grades of Starports should
have specified levels of EI in order to support them properly, thus as
population increases you have to raise BI to maintain the necessary EI
(this is a nice squeeze actually, since good starports will increase
population over time). This effectively breaks the present one-time cost
for startports into the initial investment (to get basic capability) and
the ongoing investment (to maintain capability in the face of increasing
volumes of traffic) which probably means that the RU costs for starports
would need to be lower (with the shortfall made up by the extra BI
investment required down the line).

This is all extemporised stuff, so feel free to refine and criticise.

It was coincidence.  I didn\'t even think about Shig.  Funny how things

Do you think that the current system involves too many more dice?  Let\'s
do a comparison.

Difficulty	T4.1\'s Dice	KBv2.0\'s Dice	Increase
==========	===========	=============	=========
Easy		1		2		1
Average		2		3		1
Difficult	3		4		1
Formidable	3		5		2
Staggering	4		6		2
Impossible	5		7		2


So, you see, with KBv2.0, you are only adding 1 or 2 dice to the task
throw.  That doesn\'t seem to be a significant amount to me--especially
when you see all of the benefits associated with using this system (see
my plea to Marc Miller).

> How about using Ken\'s first suggestion (keep

This is my first task system fix--KBv1.1.

Although it fixes problems with probablilities and so forth, this system
was unpopular because of the awkward math.

You\'re in combat.  You get hit.  Quick, what\'s half your current Dex
(which has been reduced because of wounds) plus double your skill
level--let\'s find your target number so that you can shoot back.

This is just too unweildy in combat.  It\'s one of the main reasons I
improved KBv1.1 into KBv2.0.

In KBv2.0, all you are doing is adding two numbers together--just like
in T4 and T4.1.  Except, in KBv2.0, a skill means a lot more than it
does in either of those systems.

Yes, but you haven\'t accounted for a character getting wounded.  When
this happens, his wounds reduce his effectiveness (read:  lowers his
target numbers).

Anytime you have to do a calculation with the stat, it becomes
cumbersome during combat.  I learned this the hard way with KBv1.1.

You get wounded, and then you have to recalculate the stat.  That\'s why
I designed KBv2.0 to adjust the skill instead of the stat.

Stats are left as is, and any calculation to the skill can be indicated
next to the skill on the character sheet because skills are not effected
by combat.

What you are left with is the simple addition of two factors--in KBv2.0
you\'re adding stat + experience score, just like in T4/4.1.

Never understood the problem with half dice... Just take a Sharpie and
write 1-3 on the sides, folks... I guess it\'s just "one of those things" you
either loath or don\'t even notice. I\'ve seen folks complain about having
to use a d3, then present systems using multiple divisions, square roots,
and natural logs, so I guess it\'s just the idea that sticks in people\'s craw.

And then we come to the bit that sticks in *my* craw <g>. I LOATH the 
"one skill per year, guaranteed" system in T4, and would love to see the
return of the skill rolls. Yeah, I\'ve seen characters go through 7 terms of
service and have fewer skills than another who only served 2, but I\'ve seen
that in Real Life(tm) too, and it feels realistic to me. The "everyone ends up
with the same number of skills" hits me in the same spot as the Objectives

"let\'s do away with grades and instill self-worth" concepts that just make
me want to get a hold of the GREAT BIG "Life Ain\'t Fair" stick and

everything has been a complete mess since then. 

Please don\'t feel you need to send condolences or the like; I know the TML
is a family, and I know you\'ll all be eager to help -- but I\'m getting
almost no time to check my email anyway, and I\'m close to running out of

The point is that, given that it will be several more days before things
are back together here (or close to it, anyway), June looks to be shot for
the THUDDD.  The \'Yacht\' competition will commence in July instead, and
we\'ll just leave June as a breather month.  Sorry if this inconveniences
anyone.

Once again, thanks for being such a cool group of friends.

I think it\'s showing. This was one of the worst problems with the first
printing. IG was obviously so rushed that they did not have time to
playtest most of the rules. The task system was one of the worst examples
of this. Products like PEs are apparently rebuilding IG\'s reputation
largely because they have been playtested.

This is similar to an Idea I had, which I gave up on, when I failed to

It seems to me that -way back when, possibly CT era- a captive government
was defined as a planet that was being administered by another planet (as
you described) _OR_ directly by Imperial Forces (usually the Navy).

This is exactly what they should do. Actually, how about a date/TL chart 
at the start of the book showing when the Imperium reached each TL? That 
way, if you were running a game in, say, 950, you could see that the 
Imperium was TL14, but rapidly approaching 15, so there would probably be 
quite a few TL15 prototypes floating around.

Marc!  Before I throw in a few thoughts, thanks for responding on the issue!

Here is a bit of backing for considering the issue and making skill a bit
more important.  (I do not care how, and there are a number of ways.)
Perhaps more, here is a push for you to include real world descriptions of
what levels of stat and levels of skill mean in the books explicitly.

I have stopped using tasks in general during play, but we find them very
handy to have written out.  Every player knows the target numbers they get,
and I made up a probability card showing the odds of success at a given
task.  The odds were made up out of the whole cloth, BTW, but give the
players a good idea of what works.

I do think that a medic-5 is going to be a better surgeon, regardless of
dexterity, than any medic-1, and a gun-4 should always dominate a gun-0
regardless of stat.  Exactly how that is expressed in the game is not
important to me.

Here, BTW, are the general rules I am using.

1.  High skill, high stat beat low skill, low stat every time.

2.  Some things are easy enough to not need rolling.

(these, BTW, have been satsfied by every contender so far.)

3.  High stat, low skill and low stat, high skill are not quite the same.
In the end, both contribute, but skills are somewhat more important than
stats on extreme cases.  (I want people to take skills over stats given the
choice.)

Here is how I make that happen:

Stat - 1-15, ave 8

Stats: 1-
1:  Extremely lacking, often to the point of special care
2-3:  Lacking significantly enough to have it be character defining
4-5:  Lacking in a noteworthy manner, but only enough to be a problem
6-8:  Average, give or take
9-10: Noteworthy superiority.  Can show off in most bars
11-12: Character defining superiority.
13-14: A superior specimen who then trained beyond any reasonable level.
Will excite comment, and will be famous for it
15: May well be famous off planet for the high stat, and will certainly
excite comment.  Should be a bit disconnected from normal mortals.

Skill 1-6 - ave 2

0: novice who can find the trigger
1: someone who had a few courses, or spent some serious time working at it.
 Could be employed, but will be considered entry level
2: someone who minored, perhaps majored in the topic, or who has some solid
experience.  Can be employed easily in the field.
3: A senior person, with either an advanced degree, or enough experience
that they are often the most skilled person in a work group.  They are not
going to be known outside of their own coworkers.  This is a level that
will excite some comment.
4:  A person considered excellent by senior people.  This person will often
have some degree of fame or notoriety in the field, though not to anyone
outside it.  Alternatively, a PhD with a bit of experience as well.
5:  A known expert, often consulted by others outside the field.  A very
senior faculty member whose work is considered important.
6:  Someone far beyond the usual pale.  Once again, groupies.  Usually
famous on their home planet, and often beyond.

I would really like to see some progression like this in the rules, just so
players know how good a 2 skill and a 13 stat is without having to do
probabilities.

(FWIW, I create target numbers to compare chances by tripling skill and
adding stat.  I am not wedded to that, but it seems to work out about right.)

>Your plea needs to have some backing.

There is my limited backing.  I do not use dice during play, and special
success/failure are on a different scale, but I do like the idea of
canonizing the tripled skill+stat, or skill+stat/2, or some other setup
where skill and stat balance out a bit more.

It is not a make or break thing, I just think it adds to the enjoyment if
some progression like the above were in the rule books, and then if the
system matched it.  If you do not do it, I will likely continue using my
system, and ignoring the actual mechanics.

Please fix the task system for T4.1 as the published one has soo serious
faults. Getting rid of the halfdice and the characteristics overimportance
makes it playable again. Nobody of my group that has tried it said they
would ever consider using it as is (I got my own system right now).

I hereby officially and pompously declare my backing for a tasksystem
rewrite and in particular make it Kv2.0 as it works and has been thoroughly
playtested.

Marc,

I agree with his points and would like to see a system like his
implemented. I cast my vote for Kenneth\'s task system.

Ok you other lurkers and lurker wanna be\'s Marc has let his self open for a
public quorum on this issue. Cast your vote on the following

1. Task system don\'t care

2. Task system something other than the one in T4 at present.

3. Kenneth\'s task system will do for a start.

Come lets get those 50 people.

AGREED!!!!!!

AGREED again!!!!!!


Another point that I would like to add to this plea is something I brought up a while back but didn\'t get to much of a response to was the issues of Tech levels and skills. 


What represents a techlevel? I would say the knowledge to build and repair items of a certain TL. This means that the TL of a world is relevant to the Skills of the people that live there! If a world is TL10 then the general level of knowledge and skills is at TL10. 


But as it is now (if I understand the rules correctly and please let me know if I don\'t!) a TL10 ships engineer could get on a TL15 ship and be able to perform lets say an easy task without any difficulty despite the fact that the engineer probably has never in his life seen a TL15 powerplant, maneuver drive or jump drive.


To me there is something wrong here! The last time I brought this up only one of the suggestions really made any sense (Richard Hough\'s). What I\'d like to know is does the rest of the list think this is irrelevant? If so then what is the difference between TLs, just equipment? 


This has been something that I\'ve been thinking about for a while now. Please let me know of any ideas that you can come up with.


Thanks

Unfortunately, things haven\'t changed completely; it still looks like FFS2

recieved from MM, what is already in the M:0 Book, and my own personal 
assumptions.  This write up is by no ways canon.

And Now i give to you, the World of Kain

Kain (Core/Core 2017) E576244-4 S Lo  821 Im M7V

The Kain system has been used for centuries by the Sylean Federation for the 
miming of metals from its 2 planetoid belts.  Many resources were mined, 
particulary lanthanum, that helped the Federation maintain its integrety as 
an interstellar society.  Belting still continues in the system, but most of 
the planetoids have been abandoned, long since depleated of useable 
materials.  However the Scouts use the belts as a pilot training ground.

Kain itself is a moon of the sole gas giant in system.  The Gas Giant gives 
off some heat, a bit more than what the Red M7V star gives.  The tainted 
atmosphere is full of greenhouse gases such as sulfur, and carbon dioxide 
due to vulcanism.  These factors help to warm the world, otherwise it would 
be a frozen wasteland.  Still, Kain can be a cold and harsh world.

It could be this "untaimed wilderness" that has caused the Scout Service to 
maintain its infamous "Survival Boot Camp".  Usualy, scout bases don\'t exist 
without at least a class D port to fuel its ships.  But this is a training 
facility, so the bedrock stays.  A Scout Courier full of new recruits come 
every 2 weeks.  The recruits are processed at the Scout Facilities and then 
transported somewhere on the planet to survive 2 weeks.  The only contact 
with civilzation is a small falre gun to only be used in emergency 
situations.

While the system is mostly a Scout Training facility, visitors are always 
welcome.  As the first J-1 stop on the Coreward part of the Sylean Main, 
many a Free Trader come by.  As long as the visitor remains at the Scout 
Instalation, and not interfere with the trainees, all is fine.  The Scouts 
at Kain welcome traders loaded with "Real Food" and alcoholic beverages. 
 These are given during the "Graduation Feast" when the cold, tired and 
hungry trainees return from the field.

Well thats a wrap for this world. :)

Well, I don\'t see the task system as that broken.  I do 
personally think the idea that a task system would change
the number of dice with the difficulty of the task is
a poor one (because it narrows the distibution of results, 
with more dice small changes in your target number give you
bigger and bigger changes in your odds so that you tend
to simply succeed or fail depending on who you are.  This
is why it is so hard to do come up with an "impossible"
task that most people can do on a long shot but
nobody has a good chance at).  But this is a personal
opinion.  I wouldn\'t use it to call the system "broken"

>First off,  the attribute vs skill issue:  T4 is weighted too 
>heavily against stats.  Skills have a minor part in a character\'s 
>success at a task throw.  These should be equally weighted.

As I pointed out in my other post. They are equally weighted.
Its not the size of the numbers that shows how much its
weighted, its the variation.

[Example of an EMT vs a doctor deleted.]

This is actually a bad example.  An EMT is trained different
things than a doctor.  If you put someone through 2 years
of training to be a doctor and 2 years training to be
an EMT they will each be better at different things.
(Either you want to seperate the skills into separate
skills, if you really want to be realistic, or you
just decide that the difference in training isn\'t
worth complicating the game with a new skill).

A better example is a person who is a naturally gifted
surgeon trying his first bypass vs a mediocre hack who
has don\'t hundreds.  I certainly wouldn\'t say that
the later is clearly a better choice.

The idea that skills should count more than
attributes is one that has been kicked around in a
lot of game systems.  It is an example of personal
preference that different systems take different
spins on.

Well, stats don\'t start at 1, they start at 2.  More
importantly, stats are rolled on a bell curve that makes
stats at either end harder to get.  Now I do agree that
handing out stat increases like skill increases is
a mistake.

Calm down there, Paul! ;->

I agree with you that people will advance at different rates, BUT NOT AT RANDOM or at least not at the same random frequency as everyone else! That\'s why I don\'t like  the "roll +7 on 2d6 for a skill" system for CT, everybody has the same 58% chance of success in that situation.

If the stat is the *aptitude* for a set of skills, then you should use the stat as the basis for increasing skills. High controlling stats should make it easier to increase skills, and make the increases bigger. Low controlling stats should make it harder to increase skill, and make the increases smaller. Right?

This isn\'t anything like I\'m using, but maybe something simple like this would appeal to people....

To raise skill level: (Controlling Stat + Current Skill - 2d6), positive number means a skill increase.

Example:  Joe has EDU of 8. He earns an attempt to develop Astrogation skill. He rolls 7 on 2d6...8+0-7=1..success he increases his skill by 1. Next time he rolls 9 on 2d6..8+1-8=0..failure, he fails to increase his skill. Next time he rolls 6..8+1-6=3..success he gets the increase. <----Now the question is does he get a 1 point skill increase or a *3* point increase? ;->

========

Now, for an "off-the wall" suggestion about stats vs skill levels. Has anybody thought about using 2d3 on the Attribute rolls? ;-> Don\'t use the dreaded d3\'s anywhere else, just for the generation of Attributes during CharGen.  You\'d get a range of 2 to 6 with an EV of 4. Now, the stats are *more* in line with the skill ,and we have to use fewer dice for task resolution. <gd&r>

Marc, I have to agree with Kenneth, even if I do get tired of his methods..
please take a look at KB2.0.. it is a good system.

Okay, I\'m (mostly) a lurker. I vote for a task system that considers
skills more important than attributes. Kenneth\'s will do for a start,
since it\'s the best one I\'ve seen since the MT system.

So, how many is that? Four or five by now, at least!

Excellent, excellent, excellent idea.  This way, people can pinpoint

The way I read it, skills should be tech level based, in much the same
way that a present day pilot has equipment that they are qualified on. 
Old Mercenary even had you note the specific equipment that your
character had qualified on in your service jacket.  If you have a decent
skill, then you can probably jump a few tech levels with minimal
retraining.  Once you hit a certain point, though, your life gets harder.
 Imagine a TL3 Physicist today trying to make it in a research lab.

<excerpt>...

But as it is now (if I understand the rules correctly and please let me
know if I don\'t!) a TL10 ships engineer could get on a TL15 ship and be
able to perform lets say an easy task without any difficulty despite the
fact that the engineer probably has never in his life seen a TL15
powerplant, maneuver drive or jump drive.

</excerpt><<<<<<<<


This is certainly how it is written in the present rules.  I solve this
by making it virtually impossible to use a piece of equipment you have
never worked with until you have bee qualified on it.  This can be a
formal checkride, or just days of puzzling out the buttons in your cabin.
 This is usually a difficult task, assisted by EDU, INT, and training
materials.


I drop the nasty negative modifier (about one difficulty per two tech
levels) once you have been properly trained.  I also make it harder to
qualify if the equipment is based on a different tech base than you are
used to, so someone from pre-thruster days trying to be a maneuver drive
engineer is going to have a rough time qualifying.

Marc,

Consider this my backing for Ken\'s thoughts on the task system. I too feel
that stats have much too much importance in determining the outcomes of
tasks. While I\'m not saying that KBv2 is the answer, I feel that at the
moment it is a better choice than the new system currently planned for
T4.1. I hope you reconsider your thoughts.

Regards,
Jason

explosives in the snub HEAP rounds, and the auto and burst fire
capabilities of the gauss rifle put down there targets quickly (not to
mention fatally). Of the three opponents, two died, and one was seriously
wounded.

I then allowed the players to escape, and had them encounter a squad in
Battledress and carrying RF Gauss Guns and a PCMP12. The effect was
electrifying - the PCMP lit up the night, blinded a character, and
destroying the surroundings. If I hadn;t been nice, they would have been
very dead.

My conclusion is that (i) combat is very lethal if run correctly, (ii) it\'s
smoother than MT or TNE and (iii) armour levels are very very stepped in
effect - Cloth did make a slight difference for survival.


I don\'t usually run combat fests, but this leads me to conclude that the
system isn\'t broke, and that players need to be careful!

I agree, to a point. The Ramshackle Empire as a whole probably did not move

Sorry \'bout that. But, as far as dungeon crawls go... one of the things I was
emulating while writing the "Anomolies" material was what I saw in JTAS. That
and the "push-pull" stuff in the rulebook... it\'s entirely possible I wasn\'t
up to the challenge. I will say, though, that I made an effort to infuse the
adventures with more characters then I\'d put in a dungeon crawl.

I\'ve always wondered why such rolls in chargen (like enlistment, college
graduation, etc) arent handled as tasks?  I\'ve done some work like this on
the MT advanced Naval and Scout systems.  

Instead of The normal:

Enlistment: Throw 7+ to enlist in Scouts, DM +1 if Int 6+, DM +2 if Str 8+.

I\'ve used this:

To Enlist in the Scouts:
	Routine, (Linguistics or Space),(INT or STR), 5min Unskilled OK
	Referee:  Character may choose which skill and which stat to use on this
task.

To Survive a Year in the Administration Office:
	Simple, (Admin or Liason), INT, Fateful
	Referee: If Training, Base, or Routine assignment, automatic success.

To gain a skill for one Year in the Exploration Branch:
	<Difficulty>, Admin,(INT or EDU), Unskilled OK
	Referee: If Training, Base or Routine assignment Difficulty = Simple
	if Mission, Spl Mission, or War Man, Difficulty = Routine


The actual chances to enlist/survive, gain a skill are not the same, but it
changes chargen from something that it done *to* a character, to something
that is done *by* a character.

Im waiting for the T4.1 charagen sheets from MM so that I\'ll be able to do
similar things to them.

Some of us *do* care about the task system.  However, we have been using
one system since 87, and have been so disappointed with some of what has
been published lately,  that we were resigned to use our system regardless
of what you did.

However, I do agree with all of Kenneth\'s points regarding the T4.1 task
system.  Its flaws are noticeable and apparent.


> Your plea needs to have some backing.
> 
> Marc

Here\'s some more.  While I believe Kenneth\'s system is *very* good, I do
not like it solely on the basis that I don\'t like rolling handfuls of dice
while playing Traveller (its OK with Star Wars though).  Traveller is and
always will be, in my mind, a 2d6 system.

(Why d6\'s?  There are Six major races, right?  Six sides to a hex, right? 
Yaskodray had 420 kids and grandkids, right?  Number of pips on a pair of
d6\'s?  42!  Highest jump number: 6!  Highest Misjump number:36 [6*6], etc,
etc.The Traveller universe is built on sixes!)

Please, though, weather you use a fixed T4.1 task system, adopt KBv2, or
come up with another system entirely,  Make it right.  The flaws in the
original T4 and current T4.1 system are well known and agreed upon by many
on the list.

I wouldn\'t say it was cumbersome.  One small division isn\'t that hard to
do, especially when the numbers are all under 20, and you can write down
the \'wounded\' value of your stat on your char sheet.

> You get wounded, and then you have to recalculate the stat.  That\'s why

And leave you with handfuls of dice to roll.  I wouldn\'t doubt that the
savings in time/effort from not having to make a division when wounded in
combat are lost by the need to add up many more dice when you roll.

> What you are left with is the simple addition of two factors--in KBv2.0

Then add up add the d6s you just rolled.  That can be quite cumbersome. :-)

My vote is for the task system as published in the Traveller Game Screen. It
is easy to use, and works better than the original one. My players like it
better, as do I.

One of my long-term adventure ideas has to do with several prototype
(TL11; predominant TL in the campaign is 9 & 10) suits of battle dress.
They can be dropped from orbit (built-in oxygen supply & AG), plus
Stealth capability (EMS + a very small jammer, if I can make it fit). Of

Is this possible? And what multipliers in terms of cost and construction

prototype antimatter reactor? What if a TL8 civilization wants to build
its first jump drive, or even hand-build several jump-capable
exploration ships, if their manufacturing technology isn\'t quite mature
enough to manufacture them wholesale? What if a Pocket Empire
desperately needs a crucial piece of technology that will give them a
decisive edge in battle, like a more advanced jump engine or power
plant, and is willing to foot the bill to build a few?)

Exactly.  Any ROM artifacts above TL 12 have to be very few and very far
between.  Using them in one adventure is more than OK, but they should not
turn up in another for a long, long time.

Actually, Yaskodray killing off all his young\'uns is a \'meta-fact\' of
Traveller.  This is information that is completely true, given through the
game to the referee (usually in \'Referee\'s sections\' of adventures), and
not through any \'library data\' entries.  We know of Yaskodray\'s pocket
universe through this data, not through TNS or lib data entries.

[details of fun-sounding combat fest snipped for brevity]

Out of curiosity, did anyone try firing on the unarmored parts of the 
PC\'s or NPC\'s bodies (you mentioned the first group of NPCs were wearing 
Flex, as were the PCs)?  For instance, a Decreased Damage Attack at DM 
- -3, on an unarmored body part (such as arm or leg) allows for half-dice 
damage, rather than the 1 point per die that gets through the Flex.  If 
the character has the skill, that seems a good way to go.

If they\'re really good, they can try for a head shot, and do a double or 
triple damage attack on that unarmored body part (at DM -5 or -9, 
respectively).  

I really, really like these rules, when coupled with the torso-covering 
armor that T4 offers.  Mabye I\'m interpreting them liberally, but it 
works for me. :)

Did your group try it?  If so, how did it work out for them?

Lots of people on the list are complaining about the skill system and task
system - maybe not precisely echoing K\'s comments but pretty close. I would
say at least 33% of those who actually play T4 think it weights abilities
too highly...I\'m not necessarily a vote for kbv2 as such, but certainly a voete
for a (attribute/2+skill) or (attr/3+skill) system to redduce the weight of
attributes.

Marc,

A bunch of us have been kicking task systems around since T4 came
out.  Well actually we were kicking them around long before that weren\'t
we?  I\'ve championed the more radical changes, specifically aptitudes,
bringing FUDGE style techniques into the game, and throwing away the old
Skill-# qualification system for a skill points based.  Ken has been
*much* more conservative pushing for the most minor changes possible to
make things work.

The relative weights of characteristics vs skills has been a hot topic
in the discussions from time to time.  Most of us agree that skills are
underrated in T4 and in your proposed T4.1.  Ken\'s method *does* produce
results that I like better.

Doing my best to be conservative tonight, here are my comments.

1.  Skills should be weighted more heavily than they are now.  You don\'t
    even have to make it equal weighting just get them closer than the
    current 4 to 1 it averages out to now.  Average Characteristic
    after CharGen is 8, Average Skill is now 2, they should be closer.
    Personally, I\'d like to get to 2 to 1 with *skills* weighting most,
    but I\'m probably a minority on that.  I really, don\'t see any way to
    do this without either significant increases in target numbers or
    calculations involving multiplication and/or division.  I vote for
    increased target numbers.
    
2.  With the increased target numbers we need to make the task
    difficulties harder.  This actually *helps* because it allows you to
    get rid of the single 1/2 die.  Ok, I never liked them, but even if
    you loved them having only ONE is...well, inelegant to say the
    least. 
    
3.  Ken is right about the SS and SF problems with your proposal.
    Regardless of what you do about the rest of the task system,
    spectacular success and failure need to be fixed.  SS should be less
    and less and SF more and more possible as tasks become more
    difficult.
    
Marc, I can\'t say I\'m in love with KB2.0, as Ken knows, but from
tinkering with both I think it works better than your proposed system.

Please, take a good look at it and *improve* on it.

What they *should* do is include higher tech gear, but include "standard" dates of introduction..perhaps as prototypes, as production items, and perhaps even reintroductions after the Long Night. This would give people a guide as to when along the traditional timeline items could be brought into game senarios.  

Everybody knows I\'m not big on adherance to a fixed published history, but I know a lot of people are, and this would be useful for them.  For heretics like me they would be relative guidelines...but guidelines *are* good.

	Marc, count me as backing Ken.  As I mentioned in a previous post,
I played 1 campaign using the T4 task system, was extremely unimpressed,
and seriously considered running my next campaign using White Wolf\'s
Storyteller system.  However, I decided to go with Ken\'s system instead.  I
am completely satisfied with it.  Ken\'s system is simple and fixes
everything that I felt was wrong with the T4 system.  I\'m going to continue
to use KB v.2 until something better comes along.

	Spend some time playtesting it... it\'s really worth a look.  Don\'t
get put off by Ken\'s vehemence; it really is a good task system.

Oh man, oh MAN!  This is great!  This is absolutely marvalous!  Marc,
regardless what you do about the task system JUMP ON THIS!

Everything you have like this I would LOVE to see.  This is exactly HOW

	I think part of the reason is we kind of burned out on "task wars" a while
back, and people just don\'t want to get involved in this But I do think
there is a significant sentiment that _skills_ should still outweight
_statistics_ regardless of how. No, not everybody wants to see KBv2 instead
of the current system. But there are many people still using it; others
still using MegaTraveller\'s (my personal favorite for its simplicity);
still others using homebrewed kludges to get that effect.

	Perhaps we should ask a simple yes/no question of the list: Do you believe
skills should count more than attributes? I think the answer will come down
heavily on the "YES" side.

	My personal vote is YES, with preferences for a simple, 2D
MegaTraveller-style system.

Still, let me add y voice to the general claomour... Marc.. please
reconsider your task system. The rest of the product is impressive, but my

Can I vote on both 2 and 3?  I think a new task system is needed.  I 
would really prefer that it involve only two dice, but am persuaded 
by the math that more dice could give a better distribution of 
results.  The important thing is that high skills should contribute 
significantly more than high stats to achieving success and that 
pesky half die should be gotten rid of.

KB v2.0, although not perfect, seems to be the best option 
at this point.

Marc, I agree with Ken on the point that Stats and skills should 
be closer to equel. But I do not like his task system. Nor am I
overly fond of the increasing the number of dice thrown for 
increased dificulty. 

I am a heretic. I use a much modified CT/MT system with the d6s
replaced with d10s. The 12 or better is the base task roll. 
Skill rolls are 2d10+skill+(attribute-7)/2+gm mod. Attribute DMs 
range from -3 to +4. The gm mod being based of a chart built
from the Mt dificulty system, very simular to the gurps range/
size/speed chart. And for combat I use a fusion of Snapshot/AHL/TNE

Wow!  I guess there are a lot of us out there who have problems with 
the task system.  Not everybody agrees on KBv2.0, but this is totally 
fine with me.

I just want to see a task system in T4.1 that is not broken.  I will 
abolish KBv2.0 in favor of an "official" system, if it is a good 
system.

There are many out there who do like KBv2.0, as well.  I invite 
you to take a good look at it.  If you would like, I will call you on 
my nickel to answer any questions you have about it.

I will work on a new system--if you will give me some guidelines.

Basically, I\'ll do whatever it takes to fix the T4.1 task system.

Let me help.  It won\'t cost you anything, and I want to do it.  I\'m a 
fanatic about Traveller.  I want to do what I can for it to be the 
best it can.

Your post is now just over 12 hours old.  27 people have written to 
the list backing what I have had to say about the task system.  There 
have been 2 that like T4.1 the way it is.

This should be enough to convince you that I am not the lone champion 
for this cause--just the most vocal.  They say if you get one 
complaint in business, there are 10 more out there who hold the 
same sentiments but won\'t say anything.  In this case, you\'ve have 
one dissenter and 26 (so far) others who agree.

Please listen to us.  Please let me help.  All of us--you, me, 
them--we all want the best for Traveller.

Sincerely,

Kenneth.

Things I would like to see in T4:

well and are great plot hooks.

2. Traders and Gunboats, Need I say more. Well I will, Starships
was a dismal failure. I liked some of the ship drawing, BUT the
Deckplan sucked major rocks. 
Whooaa, Just had an IDEA. We\'ve been having Thudd going on since the 
first of the year, why not put together a web sight devoted to ships
and deck plans? 

3. Careers, I miss belters.

4. Skills, I like the medical cascade from TNE, it made more sense
than a single skill. I would really like to see it come back.

5. PE, for the true masocist, how bouts rules combining PE and
Worldtamers. No, I don\'t want that job, but it seems like a good
idea.

given that I don\'t receive all the TMLs, I apologise in advance. So, bearing
that all in mind...

QUESTION:

Can I ask how many players any of you have inflicted the original, or
proposed T4.1 task systems upon?

ANSWER:

At a rough guess I can vouch for round about 60, the majority being people
new to the game (at Traveller events I\'ve run around the UK), but including
my own two established gaming groups.

RESULT:

For new players, the system is exceptionally easy to learn and understand.
They have little or no problem with D3s after you\'ve taken then through a
few example tasks, and they understand the stat+skill target number and the
principle that the more dice they have to roll, the harder the task.

DISCUSSION:

I feel that a lot of the arguments about stats biasing tasks too much is
simply because the CT and MT task systems (which everyone with a long
standing in Traveller seems to hark back to) placed the greatest emphasis on
skills - i.e. it\'s a system that we\'re all familiar with.

Many people have quoted the low stat requiring a huge skill input to
compensate for it. My view is simply that this is what happens in real life.
Sorry to say it, but Mr. DEX 2 just isn\'t cut out to be any good as a
sharp-shooter unless he spends many a year practicing. Similarly, Mr. EDU 2
might be ok at First Aid if he has a high INT, but otherwise no one is going
to let him near them with a scalpel unless he\'s acquired at least skill 8+
in Medic!

I think much of the stat/skill incompatibility arises because of people
still using random generation of skills (from the career tables). Referees
should be able to guide their players through this process, from choice of
career ("Well, your Mr. DEX 2 perhaps should not consider piloting or
sharpshooting, but if you really want to...") to skill acquisition ("Let\'s
face it, there\'s little point in your Mr. DEX 2 acquiring that skill unless
he\'s willing to spend a lot of his future skill gains on raising it to a
reasonable level..."), etc.

Look around you. See the divisions in real life, between the Dogbert New
Ruling Class and the InDUHviduals (I hope I just scrape into the former
category). Ever tried watching people of relative DEX 2 and 12 try picking
up a new sport such as badminton? Mr. DEX 12 will (assuming DEX reflects
hand-eye coordination et al.) pick it up pretty quickly. Mr. DEX 2 will be
lucky to hit the shuttle-cock back once in several hours of playing.

Likewise we\'ve all seen those INT 2 and INT 12 people at school - the ones
whose brain acted like a huge sieve, vs. those whose acted as a giant sponge
for information. This makes a *real* difference to how those people will be
able to pick up intellectual/cognitive/etc. skills in later life.

(Ok, so I\'m sure everyone can quote one high INT person who was a drop-out) :-)

QUESTION:

So, why is the current task system considered inadequate?

ANSWER:

I think it\'s because we still have this built-in feeling that Medic-1 means
Nurse, Medic-2 means Paramedic, Medic-3 means Doctor, Medic-4 means Surgeon
(with the right DEX, remember!), i.e. this is a throw-back to the CT days.

Now let\'s think this through again - the CT days used a different task
system, which didn\'t include attributes...

...so, why are we still assuming that there has to be a one-to-one
relationship between skill level and absolute knowledge in T4, which uses a
DIFFERENT task system?

So, Mr. DEX 2 can go down the firing range and practise with his rifle for
year after year until he acquires Rifles-9 and starts being regarded as a
moderately good rifleman. One might say, but he doesn\'t really have Rifles-9
skill with regard to technical knowledge, but we\'re talking about someone
who for several years has breathed, eaten, and slept with his rifle - his
effective knowledge is definitely better than someone with DEX 10 who just
joined the army and got Rifle-1. Likewise Mr. EDU 2 spends 10 years at
medical school having enough stuff drummed into him to make him a reasonable
doctor (Medic-10 giving a target of 12, vs. Mr. Average with EDU 7 who\'s
spent 5 years and got Medic-5).

Do these two have the equivalent ability to perform a medical operation?
Clearly Mr. EDU 2 appears to have double the skill - but why are we thinking
like this? Because of the CT/MT hang-up. His skill of 10 just reflects the
fact he had to work for so long to get his ability up to the equivalent of
Mr. Average. If you, as referee, had to work out whether one or the other
was more likely to be able to do a brain transplant, would you honestly
decide (under CT) that it would simply be whoever had skill 5+? Is this
really anywhere near reality? Surgery (IIRC) is a highly specialist field
with techniques peculiar to each branch. So why should we (under CT) have
assumed that anyone with skill 5+ could do heart surgery, any more than we
should now (under T4) consider that the skill level is the absolute arbiter
of a person\'s ability?

QUESTION:

How does T4 compare with other systems?

ANSWER:

From my minimal knowledge, some games such as CT, Star Wars and Call of
Chthulu are primarily skill based, while others including TNE and Ars Magica
are biased towards the attributes. T4 is not standing alone as the only RPG
to use attributes as a primary ability rating. Is it any more realistic to
have a game where a level of skill can outweight 1/5 or 1/3 or whatever of
one\'s associated attribute?

CONCLUSIONS:

* Plenty of people, particularly new players, can use the current system
once it\'s been explained to them (the only qualifier is that I\'ve not stuck
strictly to the T4 difficulty levels - I use whatever number of D6 and D3 I
think appropriate to reflect the difficulty of a task).

* Skill levels should not be considered absolute with regard to capability,
but only with regard to the amount (and to some degree the level) of
training. It\'s the absolute target level of skill + attribute that matters.

SUMMARY:

After all, unless someone can prove that T4 is bad for new players (which
I\'ve not found to be the case) then why are we trying to change it? Why
change T4.1 so much from T4 that anyone who bought the T4 book will *really*
be pissed off to find that all subsequent products are totally incompatible
- - remember, we (CORE) were asked to use T4.1-ish task rules for PE, TLWH,
Gateway, etc. Given the investment already put into T4.1, is it really
absolutely *critical* to change it?

DISCLAIMER:

If you don\'t like anything said here, just ignore it. If you agree with
anything, then perhaps the outcry against the T4/T4.1 system should be
moderated somehow?

My own opinion is that there will always be people on the TML who will
disagree with the \'canon\' products and suggest new alternatives - this has
been the case with M0 and particularly PE. I\'m always open to such ideas and
regularly integrate them into my games. On the task system front, though,
I\'ve just not found any reason to do this...

I must have had too much spare time sitting at my computer, having got into
work too early this morning... 8-)

Possibly because he\'s doing such a good job of \'championing\' we don\'t all
feel the need to jump in.

To be fair to Ken he\'s always wanted the *fix* more than he\'s demanded it
be *his*.  My understanding of his position is that he\'d drop his system
immediately for a better one that everyone\'s pleased with.  Yes, he\'s been
vocal in his recommendation of KB2.0 but with the bandwidth on TML you need
to shout to be heard!

IIRC several people have picked up on ongoing comments about his task
system, asked to have a look at it, and gone on to use it.  Had he simply
posted it once and shut up, I doubt so many would have been converted.


>Your plea needs to have some backing.

Whatever system you plump for, I would like to vote for more skill
emphasis.

Many thanks for asking what we think.

Everything becomes cumbersome in combat -- while it lasts, which 
isn\'t usually long in Traveller.  Stat/3 is easy enough to remember, 
anyway: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 get you +1 each.


> What you are left with is the simple addition of two factors--in KBv2.0

Yes, but the scales of the systems are completely different from each 
other and from my suggestion too.

T4 over-rates stat vs. skill on 1D - 5D rolls
KBv2.0 solves this but uses 2D - 7D, which breaks somewhat for higher 
  skill levels (which T4/T4.1 are prone to)
I proposed 1D - 5D rolls, modified to revalue the stat. downwards

How do I mean KBv2.0 breaks for higher skill levels?  Well, it\'s
distressingly easy to get a skill-5, stat-10 character from T4. 
That\'s a score of 25 in KBv2.0, which gives a 50:50 chance of
succeeding on an impossible (7D) task (average of 7D is 24.5).
It\'s worse for easier tasks, and using lots of dice biases the 
probabilities towards the average score, so a really good character 
will make mincemeat of things.

Now, I know you want the overskilling relative to CT/MT fixed. 
However, you usually present KBv2.0 as "the only thing one needs to
change to make T4 work", which isn\'t quite the case because of the 
overskilling.

There are a few other issues with KBv2.0, such as how similar in 
effect a +/-1 DM is in either (fairly similar for average characters, 
but less effective for highly skilled ones in KBv2.0), enough for me 
to suggest that while it\'s a good answer, it\'s by no means the only 
one.  Give me KBv2.0 over the existing (unused) system anyday, 
however!

Just for comparison:

KBv2.0 50:50 points

Task  50:50
 2D   Anyone (skill-1 and stat 4)
 3D   Non-specialist (skill-1, stat 7)
 4D   Competent (skill-2, stat 8) or Talented (skill-1, stat 11)
 5D   Professional (skill-3, stat 8) or Upcoming (skill-2, stat 11)
 6D   Top Pro (skill-5, stat 6) or Talented Pro (skill-3, stat 12)
 7D   Star (skill-5, stat 10)


My system: roll < stat/3 + skill; table repeated for clarity

Task    50/50 chance for
1D-1    Average (stat 7, skill 1)
2D-2    Professional (stat 7, skill 3)
          or Talented (stat 12, skill 1)
3D-3    Talented Professional (Stat 9, skill 4-5)
4D-4    Superb (Stat 12, Skill 6)
5D-5    Overblown (Stat 15, Skill 8)

Those tasks at the bottom are meant to be *hard*...

Marc, 

I have to raise my hand in support of Kenneth.  There are some very real
problems with your task system, which Kenneth has done a good job of
spelling out.  KBv2.0 looks like the best fix I have seen, so I would
urge you to consider it.

No way should a neophyte with stat 11 (approx the 8th decile on a 1-15
normal range), be as good as an experienced professional with stat 8.

My two big issues with the T4.0 task system were the crocked
probabilities and the weighting of stats over skills. You\'ve fixed one.
It would be nice if you fixed both.

Marc (and Kenneth),

I have been running a T4 campaign for some of the students here for
the last 8 months, and have used both the original T4 task system
and Kenneth\'s KBv1.1.  Before that I had played and run classic
Traveller games, but I never really got into MegaTraveller.  Some
conclusions that I have come to are:

1) The original T4 system suffers from 2 flaws - the tasks are too
easy, and the stats massively outway the skills (most of the
characters have skills at 1 to 3, but stats vary from 5 to 15 - like
CT characters).  The existing T4.1 system seems to solve the
difficulty problem, but not the stat/skill relationship. 

2) KBv1.1 solves the difficulty problem in the same way as T4.1, but
also solves the stat/skill problem with stat/2 + skill*2.  The
problem here is with recalculating stat/2 in the middle of a combat
(or just with explaining the target number calculations in the first
place).

3) I looked at KBv2.0, but decided against it because of the extra 
dice involved.  5 dice is at the limit of how many I am prepared to 
throw and add up, and I preferred 4.

In summary - yes, I think that the task system needs looking at, but
no, KBv2.0 doesn\'t work for me.  Unfortuantely, KBv1.1 has its
drawbacks as well, but for the moment I\'m willing to live with them.
 And I don\'t have a problem with the half die, and nor have any of
my players (10 so far) - it\'s not a bug, it\'s a feature!

Martin

PS - I don\'t have access to Word95, being stuck in the age of Win3.1. 
 Would it be possible (and permitted!) for someone to sent the T4.1 
character gen stuff to me in Word 6.0 format, or as a postscript 
file?  In exchange I can offer to send the list my advanced character 
gen for entertainers, based on the old CT advanced character gen 
systems.

General notes: and opinions
Names that are Vilani originally (in DGP-Data) should remain with
their original names, not be given new Vilani Names. 
Question: 
Should Frontier regions like Corridor be allowed to have LoPop
planets with highly developed Starports over level C? Likelyhood
of: a) them being built and:  B) them surviving the long night
seems low to me... Maybe they should be lowered to more sustainable 
levels for M:0!
Also: Vland and Corridor sectors should be limited to TL 
B, since that was the highest that the First Imperium achieved. TL C
should be only far in between and as for TL|s higher than D, they
should be impossible in M:0

Suggested Changes:

Antares Sector:
(i didn|t do that sector in detail as i have no fut|rther info on
it, however this one bit must be changed)
ant 2117 Irgi 
    Name change to: Gashukubi (First Imperium) UPP change to:
    X160056-H (Canon: Named by Vilani during 1I (Home of Sabmiquis)-> 
    Ch28, 31:)

Corridor Sector:
Only named that after year 140 Imperial. Name before that:
Eneri!!!
Also, many of the worlds already had vilani names in the
DGP-listing. Shouldn|t those worlds keep that name to reflect
that they remain settled?
Those changes below are what i feel is necessary. I am however,
open to discussions!

Canon Changes in Eneri:
cdr 0312 Amki:     Rename Muugaagen  MTJ 2 
cdr 1209 Kaasu, name stays, but was Mining Colony in Vilani
Times, so UPP should be more in the area of BA7A540-B (max.)
cdr 1413 Gamin:   Rename Itasis                                 
change to E442000-0    MTJ 2,8
cdr 1432 TD 18, 34 states that the worldwas onlyfirst colonized
in the late 300\'s. Thus change UWP to EAE3000-0
cdr 1511 Luug.(will later be Depot-Corridor, before that
unpopulated!) UPP->X686000-0 MTJ 3, 74
cdr 1606 Remains completely as it is, see history in MTJ 2, 50
cdr 1711 Giiku Es: Rename Naadi                                 
90 people with starport B?                                       
                                                                
MTJ 2,8
cdr 1904 Armaa Khiighar: Although also Pop, Gov, Law 0 in TD 18,
37, TD 18, 36 states that this world had a pop of tens of thousands before a
catastrophe wiped it out. Thus, there should be people living there, 
at your discretion.
cdr 2511 Khegakiir:  Rename Naagasa.... 800 people with starport
B?     
cdr 2806 Ishkad: Rename to Uughrae TD 18, 15

Other changes:
- - Change World of Pop greater than A (unbalances Universe): 
3225 shaniin: Now: C226BEE-9, was (in TD18, 38): B226787-C:
    Solution: Reduce pop to 7 or less!

- -Reduce TL|s of D+ to C:
cdr 1209 Kaasu  -> AA7A940-C

- -Worlds in Great Rift, that couldn|t have reasonably been settled
    in M:0 without the gretest effort and therefore                 
    should be barren, unless indiginous species or minor race!
cdr 0338: Girmi. Has X port in TD, so change port to same or to E
cdr 0638: Arga Am:  change UWP to E542000-0 
cdr 0931: Ashnishinipar: Change UWP to E-894000-0
cdr 1033: Kuun: Change UWP to E200000-0
cdr 1430 Khip: Change UWP to E8C2000-0 (Note: Atm C worlds
    couldn\'t be settled before late 300\'s due to lack in specific 
    tech!)
cdr 1923 Uushnii:  change UWP to E889662-4 (Note: I changed this
    world, since it contains mostly (in M:0 only) Chirpers. They 
    should have remained fairly stable in Pop and Gvt



- - Barren worlds that should have TL and Starport reduced to E /0!

To Marc:
Thanks again for agreeing to fix the data with us. It means a lot to 
me, even if this data isn\'t used for FS, 2nd edition. I just hope 
that future game designers for IG will have to use this data, not the 
FS-stuff, so that this data is established as Canon! I also hope that 
this data will be included with the new edition of FS either as an 
errata sheet, or (entirely new suggestion!!!!:) on a diskette in 
ASCII format in the back of the hardback. A disk with the full 
data might even be cheaper than a printed errata sheet with only the 
changes noted, and would make the correct data available to those 
who don\'t have Internet access (we do need to think of them as well!)

BTW: Will the maps in FS be changed to include full data (like in the 
Marches Map in the MT Boxed set??? I vote yes (in case a vote is 
started ;-)  )


Here goes:
An overall problem i have with the sectors closer to Core and the 
Solomani Rim is that most of the systems have  had their names 
changed to Vilani names. However, i feel that since the Ramshackle 
Empire should have also had it\'s influence in it\'s 500 year rule, so 
there should be more of the solomani names already to reflect 
solomani settlement and rule during RoM-times. Names in the area of 
Sylea should also be more Solomani influenced.

In Zarushagar, there should be worlds in Wolf and Oasis subsector 
which still belong to the duchy of oasis, who as TD 21, 21 puts it 
were reluctant to join (...)" (the Third Imperium). It also sais that 
in the Rebellion many worlds banded together to form the duchy 
again", so it can be assumed that most of the worlds listed as 
members in TD 21 were also part of the duchy back in year 0. 
Therefore follows that:
zar 3230  The world of Guudanmi must have it\'s name changed back to 
Oasis since without an Oasis" there wouldn\'t be a duchy bearing that 
name! It\'s TL should at least be A, if not B.


On to CORE:
2118 Sylea: i can only wonder why this one has been changed. The data 
in M:0 made more sense (almost identical to TD9, except for TL): Law 
level of 0 is not right on the capital of the 3I. It should rather be 
A586A98-C, maybe a little lower in the pop department to leave some 
space for growth later on towards 1116.
0722 Kuuda, Rename to F rnow (see TD 9, 35)
0622 Uurgigi, Rename to Sketola (same ref.) Was member of Int. Conf 
under that name.
0128 Sheki, Rename to Protalus, reason, see above. (earliest 
mentioned date: -239)
1623 aggaa Irpu, Already known as Velpare in -258.

I could go on with this name-change list forever in Core:
I strongly recommend not changing a single name in the Core Sector 
from the 1108-1116 dgp data. Core was already well known enough by 
Syleans, and new names had already been well established (see 
examples above!)! 

I have not gone into the UPP\'s here! Maybe the CORE group could 
donate something to that extent, as they already did the Core sector 
once, before it was trashed in favor of the FS data. Is this data 
still around? If so, you better use that!

I wont go into the other sector with much detail, as others may be 
doing them (Carlos is doing Massilia, isn t he?) and my main work is 
the revision of Corridor. Other sectors can be done by those with 
more info on them (Any HIWG \'ers for Gushemege?) 

I sure hope all this gets included in the M:0 hardbound, or at least 
an errata sheet!

    I think you misjudge the utter disdain and distaste the great majority of
us have for the Task System in T4.  Let\'s not get into the pure raw hatred many
of us have for that %$&#@! half die!  I\'m not particularly fond of ANY of the
systems purporting to fix the problem.  However I do want it fixed, especially
that Bloody half die gone!

    Consider this a vote that something MUST be done to fix the Task System.

Marc,

I\'d rather have any task system that considers skills more important than
stats,
I have tried the T4 Task system but didn\'t like the way that a character 
with high stats and a wide range of level 1 skills could dominate the game.

I don\'t have enough spare time to re-write the system, so I bought an old
copy of mega-traveller, which I think has a far better task system for two
reasons, 

1) it placed more reliance on skills instead of stats, in some cases the
task was rolled against 2 skills (no stat modifier at all).

2) the task system used 2D6 for all difficulty levels. I really liked the
idea that you could play the game with a pencil, paper and 2 normal dice
stolen from some board game.

So I\'d like to add my voice to the plea for you to reconsider the task
system for T4.1

Back into lurk mode..........

One of the greatest things about the TML is you can \'talk\' to the designers
directly.

I\'ve been a long time believer in that the RoM was significantly more
technologically advanced than conventional canon from 1100 would
have us believe. In fact I\'m planning a late Imperial campaign based
around that fact (players uncover proof of a TL 13 RoM and get caught
up in Imperial efforts to suppress it and Solomani efforts to get it). I just
don\'t think it could have reached TL 14 in anything but the most
experimental stages.

As I\'ve stated before I strongly hold that the Terran Confederation
worlds did reach TL 13 or near TL 13, I just think pushing that to TL 14
is not realistic. Given that most of their resources would have had to
have been devoted to holding together their empire, it just doesn\'t
seem reasonable. If a TL 14 (or near TL 14) world did exist, it would
almost certainly be one of the Terran heartland world.

Okay I owe an apology here, I did not want to imply that your adventures
were in any way inferior. For that I unreservedly apologies and retract,
the term \'dungeon crawl\' was inapproriate, I allowed my emotions to run
away with me.

To try and put my point in a more reasoned view. \'Lock and Loot\' has too
much TL 14 gear. Working high tech relics have to be handled with
extreme care, too many of them can quickly turn a campaign into a treasure
hunt, or even worse unbalance a game by giving the players too much
power. A single TL 14 laser pistol is a fearsome prize, \'Lock and Loot\'
has twelve of them, the players could easily retire on the proceads of
their sale alone, add in the vacc suits, the computer (and it\'s apparently
intact data), and the exoskeletons and you\'ve got a treasure haul beyond
belief. You seem to have underestimated how much this stuff would be
worth, you\'re not talking KCr for the research data, more like MCr. I
think \'Lock and Loot\' is a good adventure (though I think \'Sleepers\' is
your best), challanging and creative; its just the rewards are too high
(or at least underestimated).

Okay, so I haven\'t put that too well; all I\'m trying to say is that \'Lock
and Loot\' is good, but in my opinion the rewards are too high.

I think the term \'Drayaskin\' was first defined in CT adventure 12 \'The
Secret of the Ancients\' and again in AM5 which covered the Droyne.
The Drayaskin were Grandfather\'s children and grandchildren. The
Droyne are the race they came from, and the Chirpers are regressed
Droyne. The Droyne still very much exist in M:0, though they are not
yet recognised as a single race. The Drayaskin were all wiped out by
Grandfather in the Final War.

I think he\'s referring to the phrase:
  "The Droyne were ultimately destroyed in a centuries-long conflict
    by their creator....."

Well, canon is flexible and maybe one of the Drayaskin could have
survived, but releasing it back into the universe is a _major_ historical
change; one that virtually rewrites it from the ground up.

Mark me down as an against change. If you
rerate skills as being more important than attributes
you have to change the generation system to
make aquiring skills exponential. 2300 springs
to mind as a good example.

	Just thought I\'d jump in here.  I\'m a newbie Traveller GM, coming
to the game after getting rather burned out over White Wolf\'s tragically
hip undead.  I inflicted the T4 system on 4.5 players (player 5 developed a
bad case of grad schoolitis halfway through) over my first Trav campaign
(which I posted to the list under the title: Traveller: a Long Day\'s
Journey...).

	4 sessions were sufficient to convince me that the stock T4 system
sucked great big rocks.  I might be able to dig up and repost the game
transcripts, especially the one from the last session, in order to show you
the sequence of events that led me to this conclusion.  And my players
_loathed_ the 1/2 die.

	Little or no problem with D3\'s?  You should meet my guys :).  And
the problem I have with T4 is that the tasks aren\'t that difficult: a
fairly talented character has a 43% chance of success on an Impossible
roll.  That, IMHO, is inacceptably mediocre design, and a particularly
egregious example of what was wrong with original management IG products.

	And everything you write above applies to KB 2.0, which is what I\'m
using currently.  Furthermore, unless Marc comes up with something better,
I\'m going to continue using it.  For my group, the T4 task system is as
dead as the last brontosaur.  Nailed to its perch, pining for the fjords,
resting.

	I never played CT, and have had only minimal exposure (3 sessions)
to the MT system.  I personally think that WWGS\'s StoryTeller is a superior
system to any Traveller system I\'ve seen to date, but I use KB v.2.0
because it sorta feels Travellerish...

	Unrealistic balancing of stat and skill (in my subjective opinion).
I\'m probably approximately INT 9 or A, EDU probably B or C, LAW 3 (or so; 4
years of Law School anyhow).  I don\'t care how smart or educated you are,
without any law skill you aren\'t going to be able to tell someone whether a
given contract is a valid emphyteutic lease under Quebec law or not as
easily or quickly as I can.

	Yet T4 allows this to happen.  Strike 1.

	It goes far too easy on players and NPC\'s.  Impossible rolls are no
such thing.  In fact, they\'re far too easy.  Again, I can repost a series
of event outcomes from my last campaign to demonstrate what sort of
ridiculous effect this can have upon a game.

	So high attributed characters (in fact most characters) can get
away with pulling off unbelievably difficult tasks far too frequently.
Strike 2.

	The D3: my players hate it.  I only keep one around for use for
damage rolls for some old-FF&S designed weapons that do 2.5 or 11.5 dice of
damage respectively.  Strike 3.

[snip]

>
>QUESTION:

>How does T4 compare with other systems?

	Out of the 4 task systems I\'ve roleplayed with, I\'d rank it third.
Here\'s the ranking:

1) WWGS\'s StoryTeller system.
2) KB v2.0
3) T4
4) Basic Set D&D circa 1980 or so.

	And there\'s a big gap between 2 and 3.

	So basically, you\'ve already homebrewed a patch for one of its most
glaring inadequacies...  And, as I\'ve pointed out, KB 2 is just as easy as
the T4 system to pick up.  My guys have been using it just fine for several
sessions now, without _any_ system-related complaints.  This was not the
case for T4.

	I\'d say yes.  I think that T4 may not neccessarily be bad for new
players, but it does make for bad games.  And I don\'t think that anyone out
there is going to be using T4 for very long.  It\'s sadly, woefully
inadequate, and people are going to start homebrewing patches for it, even
if they don\'t get totally turned off Traveller because of it.

	 And, here\'s the kicker, using KB 2 instead of the T4 system causes
_zero_ compatibility problems; all it changes are the number of dice rolled
for the different difficulty levels.  So nobody gets burned...


	But anyhow, those are just my opinions...

this task system. The core rules fit on one page - extended rules took only

two six-siders...characteristics and skills had roughly equal weight, since
characteristics were divided by 5...

And I know it\'s nit-picky (I admit it)...but psychologically I feel better

This is what I have changed over to, IMNSHO it was, and is the best task

Yes, I must agree here as well.  I have given the T4 task system a chance, 
but people at both my home game and at a convention game I ran say that 
stats are too heavily weighted against skills and experience.  Some ol\' 
timer even quoted the "Age, Experience and Treachery over Youth and 
Skill(read: education/book learnin\')" adage :-)

My vote is for YES to skill over attributes, and more importantly a return 
to the old MT system or something akin to it.

1) One week of discussion on the merits of the different systems.

2) After that, the issue is put to a vote:
the Task system that wins is the TML-official system, officially 
the system we ALL support. After the vote, no more bitching about 
anygiven system being better. 

3) We then present the result of the discussion to Marc as our 
choice. That way Marc will not have to choose between the 5-8 systems

But who is to say that the adventure cannot be reinterpreted?  I tend 
to share Steve\'s view on the "facts" of Traveller.  I like a more 
flexible take on facts that allows room for ambiguity and differing 
inerpretations.  The idea of the secret of the ancients as being 
revealed and carved in stone was a big let-down for me, and one of 
the reasons why I preferred TNE to MegaTraveller.  At least they 
reintroduced the unkonwn and ambiguity into the known universe.

example, a TL12 Light Vehicular Meson Gun (call it, oh, 3m barrel

a Meson Gun burst anywhere the infantry call it in, with a zero

Well, there\'s a story in that, it was *originally* planned for March 
97 -- but, like IG\'s Timetable, it\'s been pretty much behind 
schedule!

Actually, the poor production values of the early IG stuff *really* 
depressed me and I was about to give the whole idea up as it seemed 
(way back then) that IG was probably going to go belly up *soon*.

However, the improvements with CSC, Emperor\'s Arsenal and (despite 
some major logical flaws) PE, I\'ve decided that I will probably go 
back to it "real soon now".

Unfortunately, in the meantime I\'ve got a "job" to write a Worldbook 
for Highlander Design\'s "Chivalry & Sorcery III" and, though I 
completed the first draft what, two, maybe three months ago, I 
haven\'t heard anything more from them (*they* have an even *bigger* 
problem than IG with being behind schedule!!!), so I\'m sort of caught 
up waiting for them to send me a list of things that have to be 
changed *urgently*, like, *right now* -- and I don\'t want to get 
caught halfway doing DS#3.

Then there\'s another project I\'m working on, "Armageddon" -- a 
complete worldbook/rule system that is based on a complete worldbook 
project that I submitted to SJ Games for GURPS a couple of years 
ago, and which they only recently got around to rejecting. So, I\'ve 
got the rulebook (all 88 pages or so at this stage) written and 
almost ready to go, but the Worldbook (200 pages in the GURPS 
version, probably longer in the new version because so much can no 
longer be "assumed" and has to be included) needs to be reformatted 
and some new material added. This will be (hopefully) be available 
"real soon now" (as they say in the gaming industry!) as an Acrobat 
PDF electronic version, possibly sold over the \'Net, possibly by 
mail.

Anyway, that\'s sort of taking up the rest of my time at the moment. 
But I *do* intend to get back to DS when I have the time -- hopefully 
when FF&S2 and NAH and some other products come out and allow some 
more advanced options for the game. Unless, of course, the new Deluxe 
Hardcover version is a complete disaster :-{

It\'s been said before, but I\'ll say it again...

I din\'t think Ken necessarily wants KB2.x to be adopted wholesale,
but he has done a pretty thorough analysis of the existing T4 task
system. He\'s found what he feels are problems and I agree with him.
I think you have to seriously look at coming up with a definition of
"what does one skill level represent" and making that consistent
with the balance between attributes and skills for tasks.
Also, the Spectacular Success/Failure odds are clearly broken.

While it\'s true that most players don\'t give a whit about how or why
the game was designed, I think designers should.

> Your plea needs to have some backing.

While Ken may seem to ramble on endlessly while producing gigantic
task outcome tables that are mostly sopoforic, he has got a point.
T4.1\'s task system needs to be balanced and tuned.

        Simplificating things, Grandfather was a mutant Droyne, with
superintelligence and psionic superpowers. He created 20 children, and each
of them created 20 children. That makes 400 children and grandchildren.
These are called "Draysaskin", and had psionic superpowers and
superintelligence. The droyne were just the original race (without
superpowers and without superintelligence). I recommend reading carefully
the following material that you own: Imperial Encyclopedia (Referee\'s
section), MT Referee\'s Companion (not guide)... these things were firmly
established in Traveller, IMHO. Probably, you should seek some CT materials
as Alien Module n: Droyne, which I do not own, but that I think is the most
extensive reference on the Ancients.

>BTW, I\'m not sure how I imply there are no Droyne in the universe. Could you
>enlighten me w/o touching off a flame-war? 

        I said "seemed to imply". It is because you speak of the "effects
that releasing a Droyne in the Universe will have", or something similar.
Well, there are thousands of millions of Droyne in the universe...
everything would have been OK have you used a term like "Ancient".

        Yes, you\'ve got a point, although about who is it who is giving us
these reliable facts about the Ancients, I think it has been stated as a
designer note, that is, not in a supposed document from inside the game, but
rather in explanatory notes from an outside point of view. The bit "he kept
careful count" is in MT, that\'s for sure, and in some other materials. I\'ll
check with my collection. IMHO, the problem is that changes to details
related to grandfather and the Draysaskin are prone to have spectacular
effects on the Traveller universe... I mean, releasing a forgotten
Draysaskin in the Universe is something that some people has already done in
their home universes, but it results immediately in an alternate universe
which rapidly evolves into something quite different from the ***canonic***
one. Many have thought about that just for fun, but putting it into an
adventure will *probably* (again, IMHO) spoil any campaign.
        Btw, I like your bit about that Draysaskin probably wandering out to
explore the universe when released...

        This has been a major thread in this list some time ago. Check MT
Referee\'s Companion, right after the TL table. It states the dates in which
each empire reached the TLs. Maximum stated TL for the RoM is 12. I
**could** agree with your version, but, in the recent IG material, it seems
that EVERY RoM facility that is discovered is at TL 14-15, and that\'s a
problem. Some, very scarce, high tech facilities, OK. Every single one, no way.

>I have say this, though... I\'m glad I didn\'t introduce the non-interstellar

        That would probably have been OK. As a rule of thumb, and strictly
IMHO, I think that Ancients have to be used very, very, VERY, carefully,
because they are the origin of the whole Traveller universe, so the whole
game background is very sensitive to what is said about them.

        Anyway, I just wanted to point out that there were some recurring
things that can reasonably be considered as errors, being poublished by IG.
The TL14/15 for the RoM is definitely one of those.

        Best,

I would prefer a T4 task system which uses as few dice as possible 
(preferably not D3), means that only highly-skilled and/or high stat 
characters can perform the hardest tasks (and then not reliably), and 
is easy to implement.

The MT system is the best I have seen to date, bar none.

I would prefer T4.1 to have a different skill system, closer to CT/MT 
for easy compatibility with old products, but I\'m not very 
enthusiastic about KBv2.0, having looked again at the probabilities.

And, as Ken will doubtless tell you, elements of it have been 
subsumed into T4.

I would certainly agree.  What I\'m not so sure about is how much I 
want T4 to reflect real life in this respect.  For good roleplayers, 
I think things might be OK - but I suspect that good roleplayers 
don\'t bother much about task rolls anyway; the (role)play\'s the thing.
For the hoped-for newcomers, I suspect it will become very 
disheartening when one\'s character isn\'t very good at anything much 
because of low stats, a slippery slope to munchkinism IMO.  (Yes, 
that *does* make for good roleplaying, in the end.)

AFAIK this is still the system.   While I might agree that less 
random generation is a good idea, it\'s not on the (official) agenda, 
and this discussion is about tasks for the existing system, not some 
ideal one.

In other words, we\'re using the CT chargen system (much improved), 
which works rather well with the CT value assumptions and many people 
seem to feel works less well with T4.x.

Again, I agree the RL example is accurate.  However, I believe 
there\'s a strong link between improving a skill directly and 
improving an associated attribute: you learn to play badminton, your 
eye:hand coordination improves.  (Mine did.)  You can even develop 
the "habit of intelligence" (my phrase) -- part of it is learned 
responses to information, part of it the habit of thinking, and part 
the development of neural pathways during formative years.

Ars Magica is more like 50:50 IMO.  D&D is probably skill based (in 
the sense that skills improve with experience level not stat, and 
improve far more by XP than by stat).

Most alternative systems seem to be trying to redefine the difficulty 
classes of T4.x for exactly this reason of compatibility.  The 
minimalist task profiles of PE are exactly suited to this.

The game will survive if T4.1 remains as is.  It will be improved if 
the time spent replacing T4.1 is spent on fixing FS.  Or FF&S 2.  Or 
Starships.

This is a pretty fine line to walk. A TL 15 gauss rifle isn\'t a big
deal perhaps, but what about jump-6? I think it just grates on people
in general mostly because of the rather coarse nature of TL ratings.
(Boy, talk about rehashing an old argument...)

The problem is that when you say "They had a TL 14 rifle", you imply
that they had TL 14 and thus, they had jump-5, which of course, they
didn\'t. Now, I doubt that you meant to make a statement about RoM
jump drive technology by sticking a rifle in your adventure, but in
some ways, that is what you\'re kind of saying. 

Perhaps I could say it all by saying, "the TL system is a constant
source of grief and complaint for TML members".

I don\'t know if you really need to own or have read "every single
Traveller item ever published". I do not think that owning "Forms &

Someone else responded and said it was a "meta-fact" that we had been 
given outside of the narrative description of the Traveller universe.
Well... I dunno. I think I\'d have to agree with you, Steve, there\'s
nothing to stop you from contradicting this in some way to provide
an adventure hook... though, on the other hand, a lot of TML readers
(myself included) get bent out of shape when "canon" gets contradicted.

Hm, well, I don\'t have my references here at work, but I think it is

Ok, heres my 1.5 crimp\'s

Yes the current system has problems, however the basic concept of
using the number of dice to measure the difficulty is IMHO good.
New players pick up on it quickly. It acts as  a visual cue to the 
difficulty of the task.

More dice = A harder goal. 

BTW Am I the only person on this list who actually owns D3\'s? 
Someone must make them still, if not, oh well yet another marketing
opportunity for IG!

So where do we go. The system my group of gamers has been using is
 
stat/2 + skill*2 

and to be honest it works fine. To ease gameplay, we have 
just adjusted our various character sheets to show the task DM next 
to the stat/skill. When an injury is taken we alter the stat DM\'s, as 
needed. There hasn\'t been any real slowdown of gameplay.

As a side effect, it has solved the other contentious problem of 
high skill levels, but people who hated the half-die <STOP READING NOW>

As the skill is doubled, Half skills become a possibility, perhaps as 
a halfway house indicating a skill being improved. We added this into 
the character generation system. 
Every skill level gained in a skill currently at 3 acted as half a skill 
and voila! Lower overall skill levels. Acheiving high levels of skill
takes perseverance and sacrifice just like \'real life\'. 

Finally all players who play PE, you must go and read Machiavelli, 
you won\'t be disappointed.

	MegaTraveller did that too; if my memory doesn\'t betray me, the GDW 
campaign Knightfall introduced a new starfaring race, older than the 
Ancients.

	Personally, I have three GOOs (Great Old Ones; spacer terminology). 
The Ancients, The Precursors (as in Knightfall), and the 
Antediluvians (a rimward non-humanoid race, -210,000 ~ -90,000 AD). 
Too much Babylon 5 you say... :)

	Makes me wonder... The Finnish translation of 2300AD was pretty 
successful, as was Twilight:2000. Maybe Traveller, too? Although 
Finnish gaming scene has been pretty saturated with cyberpunk and 
White Wolf games, a classic SF game might have a niche too.

I think that attributes are overrated in T4.  I don\'t mind the
multi-dice system (though I\'m not as fond of d3) but I think that
skills need to be more important.

That said, you could keep the T4 or T4.x system but have skills
alter _difficulty_, not Target number.

Then the fix is simple.  The trick is to assign tasks properly, IMO,
not what wierd math you decide on to get a target number.

I, too, have to add my support to Kenneths\' call for a task system change.
KBv2.0 is a decent suggestion, but is by no means the only approach that
could be taken.  I would be happy with any approach that:
A.  Removed the half die
B.  Gave a significantly greater weight to skill over attribute
C.  (Optional) Did not involve "on the fly" math calculations to determine
success probability.

CONCLUSIONS:

* Plenty of people, particularly new players, can use the current system
once it\'s been explained to them (the only qualifier is that I\'ve not stuck
strictly to the T4 difficulty levels - I use whatever number of D6 and D3 I
think appropriate to reflect the difficulty of a task).

I agree completly here.  I have learned to use a task whatever way I need.


He who speeks the truth  says 

* Skill levels should not be considered absolute with regard to capability,
but only with regard to the amount (and to some degree the level) of
training. It\'s the absolute target level of skill + attribute that matters.

True again.  I have a minor case of CP so my Dex at most is a two ; ) as
well as strength, and from personal experince I know I would love to be a
guitar player and have read many books and can even play a little but no
matter how much I read I ll never be a rocket star.  SO attributes do mean
alot.  If you think that a person\'s skill is important in a task then give
him positive die modifers or lower the task difficulty its that simple. I ts
just that simple.

 In SUMMARY Andy says 

After all, unless someone can prove that T4 is bad for new players (which
I\'ve not found to be the case) then why are we trying to change it? Why
change T4.1 so much from T4 that anyone who bought the T4 book will *really*
be pissed off to find that all subsequent products are totally incompatible
- - - remember, we (CORE) were asked to use T4.1-ish task rules for PE, TLWH,
Gateway, etc. Given the investment already put into T4.1, is it really
absolutely *critical* to change it?

I never real thought about, I am going back to school and I am going to be
brook for awhile, and I would be real pissed if i would have to spend 30 for
another copy of a book I all ready have.  Boy you will really see some ranting 
then Marc ; )

I want to thank Andy for saying alot of things I couldn\'t quit say myself.
As far as the Vote goes,  I guess as most of you know, I am  against any
further changes in the rules, I cant afford it.

Exactly.  That\'s why I haven\'t been pushing for KBv2.0.  We can work 
out how to fix T4.1 after Marc has agreed to listen to us and fix it 
in the first place.

We may not all agree on which way to fix it, but it is painfully 
clear that T4.1 needs to be fixed.

Marc, your challenge was to get 50 backers to change the task system. 
 That request was made just under 22 hours ago.  There are now 41 
people who have voiced an opinion for change.  There are still only 2 
who have supported T4.1 as it is.

It is painfully clear that I do not stand alone.  Now, can we fix 
this thing?

</excerpt><<<<<<<<


Perhaps because I have the strength of ten, for my heart is pure?  Or
possibly because I have posted more than once on the topic?  I will use
it as an excuse to post again, and soften my previous stance.


As I said before, I find the current system does not fit my needs, but
that may be more an indication of how we like to play than anything else.
 I roll very rarely for much of anything beyond a general trend in the
results.  We do not use the present task system, but one with more of a
skill weighting might get used.  I do not feel that strongly about it.


What I do feel strongly about is getting a table of equivalencies into
the text - something like Marc already did with the EDU stat.  Telling
people right out that their EDU-8 is the real world equivalent of a HS
diploma is pretty useful.  I liked how Gurps did their stats, with real
world levels next to the numbers.


Let me affirm, BTW, that I do really like the general idea of the task
system, with real world names for the level of difficulty.  My players
have an innate understanding of what it means when something is
"difficult"  I also like the general Traveller skill setup and character
generation, esp. after the revision.  It is only the exact results of
this particular implementation that I have trouble using in play, as it
does not match our own perceptions of the world.


It is worth noting that my players are thinking of moving to a name-based
skill system as well.  They think "Master" or "Apprentice" is more
understandable than 4 or 1.  I cannot really argue with them, but I have
not yet gotten around to doing it.

That works for me! Eventually IG will develop scenarios for this time period.

    'body' => 'Hi, everyone-

        Please add my vote to the growing list of individuals who feel that
the T4 task system is in serious need of overhaul.  Skills should be much
more heavily weighted than attributes in order to get realistic task rolls.
        Skills are bodies of knowledge and training which enable individuals
to accomplish tasks accurately and effeciently.  Raw ability gives an
individual the chance to pick something up more readily, perhaps, and even
to perform tasks with some higher measure of precision, but there is only so
much that physical and mental aptitude will go toward accomplishing a task
within a specific time frame.  I think it is important to keep in mind that
skill levels represent ever-increasing refinements to fairly finite areas of
knowledge, which give an individual the ability to make correct choices or
actions quickly.  Consider some examples:
        -Two riflemen take aim at a distant target.  One has higher ability,
the other higher skill.  The rifleman with higher ability has better control
over his weapon, making for steadier aim, but the rifleman with higher skill
knows that steady hands are only part of the picture.  There is also windage
to account for, plus the characteristics of the ammo they are using, plus
the rifle\'s individual quirks to account for.  Which rifleman has more
working against him?
        -A pilot and co-pilot are flying a twin-engined plane in a storm.
The pilot has higher ability, the co-pilot higher skill.  Lighting hits one
of the engines.  The pilot is smarter, and can certainly reason out the
various steps which must be taken to keep the plane in the air and cut the
burning engine, but how much of this can he reason out in  5 seconds or
less?  The co-pilot, with more skill, has learned the correct procedures
long ago, and can implement them without thinking.  Who has the better
chance of making the correct decisions in time?
        It is one thing to have the tools (i.e. abilities) to accomplish a
task, and another thing entirely to know how best to use them.  I believe
that skill greatly mitigates the difficulty of any task or challenge.  I
would like to see this reflected in T4.1, in a manner that emphasizes ease
of calculation and no half-dice.  I have one suggestion on how to implement
this and would like to offer it for consideration.  Let me preface this by
stating that the system is not yet playtested- I came up with this here at
work this morning.

        Routine Task: 1D
        Difficult Task: 3D
        Formidable Task: 5D
        Foolhardy Task: 7D
        Impossible Task: 9D

        Procedure:  Roll dice equal to the Difficulty minus Skill Level.
The target number is the character\'s relevant attribute.  A roll equal to or
lower than the attribute is a success.
        Example:  Two people are attempting to climb a cliff face without
ropes.  One person has Strength-6 and Athletics (climbing)-3, the other has
Strength-10 and Athletics (climbing)-1.  The task is a Formidable one.  The
first climber would roll two dice (Formidable task (5D) - Skill level (3)=
2D) against his strength.  The second climber would roll four dice
(Formidable task (5D) - Skill level (1)= 4D) against his strength.  The
more-skilled individual actually has a better chance of getting up the
cliff, because he is more trained and experienced in this sort of thing.
The stronger climber must count on his mighty thews to handle any unforseen
problems during the climb.  Consequently, he will have a more difficult time
of things.
        Spectacular success occurs when the player rolls half his target
number.  Spectacular failure occurs when the player rolls twice the target
number.
        Note that Task Difficulties are baseline numbers for unskilled
individuals. Thus, an individual with a skill of one would be able to
automatically execute Routine tasks (starting a car, booting up a computer),
while an individual with a skill of three would have the acquired experience
and training to automatically execute tasks which would be Difficult to an
unskilled person (repairing said car or computer).  As a natural corollary
to this, skill levels should not be easy to come by in the character
generation procedure.  A random skill table for each profession or a skill
acquisition roll after each term might be appropriate.
        I think this system, while rough, is realistic and simple to use.  I
invite everyone to pick it apart and offer comments/criticism or
modifications.  As for myself, I think I\'m going to round up some players
and put it to the test.
        Whatever the case, I believe my reasoning regarding skill versus
attribute is valid, and I think that the T4.1 task system ought to address
this, regardless of which system is used.

Respectfully, 

Mike Lee

Thank you Marc for taking the time to hear the opinions of the TMLites.

I also agree that a system that prompts characters to shoot for specific
skill (at various levels) is much more desirable than having characters
try and max out their stats and thereby effectively raising all skills
related to that stat by the same amount.  I am not in favor of lowering
stat values as I do not wish to make it easier to "kill" PCs, so IMO the
stat/skill balancing should take place in task resolution.  Kenneth\'s
system is workable and has been in-house playtested by many on this list
(myself included).  I am not proclaiming that KBv20 should become the
official system, but just that the issue should be addressed and a more
balanced system devised.  

Thanks

Debatable - it really depends on your opinion of what Int represents.  I
was very slow learning to read, because I wasn\'t motivated; once
somebody got me interested, I steamed ahead.  That was to my mind an Edu
increase, but within a couple of years I went from being regarded as
slow to bright.

Personally, I would rather have the Int being constant and the
improvements to mental abilities be due to increasing Edu and skills.
Have a look at the skills dependent on Int but not Edu.  Things like Art
or Perception shouldn\'t be reduced for kids IMO; the only difference is
in training.  And many of the skills with a physical component (such as
Ground Craft) wouldn\'t be a problem if the tools required were built
with child-sized people in mind.  A Solomani child and a Geonee adult
with no training and comparable Dex should both be at a penalty to use a
"standard" groundcar (though Virushi or Dolphins would be worse off ;-).
[This is almost a non-problem anyway by the age 13.]

OTOH, while some of the Edu skills can be seen as requiring general
experience of the world (such as Fast Talk or Instruction), my argument
above could also be applied to some of the others (such as Music or
Computer).  So I guess I\'m not left with much more of an argument than
"gut feeling"...

The problem comes from a table in a Megatraveller book (_Referee\'s Companion_
IIRC) where the times the various empires reached what TL was set out. RoM
never got beyond 12, Sylea reached (re-reached) 12 in -150 and don\'t get to
13 until 300.

I\'ve earlier proposed a way to explain some of this away: To define the TL
of a planet as the highest TL a large part of the population routinely used,
but to define the TL of an interstellar realm as its space TL. That way RoM
_may_ have had some TL 14 stuff (though I also agree that it would be best
to keep TL 14 relics severely curtailed), but it did _not_, repeat _not_,
ever, ever build any TL 13 ships. And neither does Sylea until Year 300.

It is set forth as information for the Referee in _Secrets of the Ancients_.
In fact, nearly _all_ information about the Ancients is Referee\'s info, only.
People are still debating just who the Ancients were in 1100. They don\'t even
realize that Droyne are a major race until 790. Very little of what we, the
players and referees, know about the Ancients are publically known even in
1100. So I sure hope you didn\'t let any cats out of any bags in a Milieu 0
adventure ;-)

Well, there are only about known 45 human races that survive in 1100, but I
don\'t think they have all been used up (though I think we\'re getting near it).

Yes they do, but skills matter too.  This is why I advocate that 
skills = attribute in contribution to the target number.

Let\'s not forget that there are a heck of a lot old players out there 
who want to like T4 too.

Just look at the outpouring on this list.  Given this, how can you 
even suggest that the T4.1 task system be kept the same?

The sentiment to change the task system to something where skills are 
more on par with stats is almost universal.

It\'s not just me.  There\'s many, many who want to see this change 
occurr.

Every skill based system goes through this.  The side that
gets more support depends on who is on the "outs" (ideas
to make changes generate more traffic) and current fads.

You really can\'t judge support on anything from who decides

that depends on people choosing to respond is going to be

I use a PowerMac and a USR Pilot for Traveller. I put all my PC/NPC on my
Pilot for easy access to skills/UPP/notes while gaming. While I am at it I
also use a Casio programmable calculator for travel time calculations etc
with some small programs written for the purpose. I\'ve done all my
Traveller software in Excel and Hypercard but if I\'d do it today I\'d use
Director for cross platform compatability and internet savvyness.

Your second question about what PE software should be is to vague to answer
intelligibly: I want my PE software to do everything in PE and then some
including really interesting adventures in the Keith brothers style ;)
Actually I\'d be quite satisfied with a bookkeeping kind of app to help ease
the burden of the referee.

	The same - I went for GURPS when I needed more accuracy with the

T4 system (although I will be - have to learn it for a Con game late 
this summer...).

	Vague questions deserve vague answers :P

	Ok, today\'s computers have been around for a couple of decades; even 
in M0, computers have been essential for millenia. So I\'m fairly 
confident even some unscrupulous software manufacturers have weeded 
out most of bugs in their operating systems. :) So I\'m not expecting 
them to crash, even if they are mere TL8.

	The way I see it, software and hardware would be much more 
integrated. All the software being on non-volatile memory chips, 
adding new programs would be just like adding new hardware (plug & 
pray!). Only heavy, non-portable expert systems would require 
separate hardware/software.

	Furthermore, I\'ve been toying with the idea of 
interchangeable processor cores. As in the following:

	"Oh darn, they busted our last damage control backup! Ok crew, rip
open those handcomps and hand over the cores.. that\'s it, those
little black hexagonal thingies..."

Whoops! The defenders were wearing cloth  - blame it on the late night and

No one tried firing at specific bodies but one player fired her snub SMG on

The groups actions were tempered by previous experiences of combat with
non-military spec weapons. Two of them have been hospitalised as a result
of brief gunfights (the don\'t usually wear armour on ship etc.). As a
result, the gun fights were cat and mouse around the stairwell, except for
the running away bits. The first fatality resulted from a guard running
down stairs, being surprised and walking into a gauss rifle autofire burst.
The second was the HEAP through the door. (I *love* the explosive rules!).
The third combined a grenade and a stun baton! (*)

I really like the T4 combat system. It is quick, easy and lethal. I\'ve
played CT/MT and T4, and test run TNE (before abandoning it for MT). T4 is
the best version by far.

No doubt my players will try the aimed fire/pinpoint fire type rules!

(*) ref\'s decision as the stun baton dropped all three stats below zero.

The armour seemed to work like this -

None - Hospitalised/kill
Cloth - Hospitalised, maybe ride out low rolling attacks
Flex - Ride out most hand weapons (note that I assume a knockdown if
players are hit and the
armour absorbs it.
Combat/Battledress - "Run away. Run Away"

1. Doc needs spell-checking.

2. Nice to see Decorations back. Seems odd that you can be injured *or* get 
a medal, but not both - ie you get a medal for running away from danger! 
Also, they\'re too common (a fault in CT and MT, too)- a 1/36 chance per term 
of getting an SEH? In other words, every term 1 person in your platoon will 
get an SEH (not to mention 2 getting MCGs and 3 others getting MCUFs). 
Suggestion: military characters roll 2d each term for decorations (+1 if 
wounded that term). Award given on 11+. 1-3=MCUF, 4-5=MCG, 6=SEH. SEH grants 
+1 Soc (bravery is highly regarded in the Imperium). WB or MCUF grants +1 on 
commission/promotion roll that term, MCG grants +2, SEH grants +3.

3. TL Group table is broken - MidTech worlds can have starports A-C but 
HiTech worlds can have A-D. Suggestion: Drop Starports from that table. 
Change starport table to:

   Lo Mid Hi VHi
1   E  D  D  C
2   D  D  C  C
3   D  C  C  B
4   C  C  B  B
5   C  B  B  A
6   B  B  A  A

4. What\'s that table at the bottom of p3?

5. Not completely happy with new EDU rules. Suggestions: roll 1D6 for EDU, 
+0 for VLoTech, +1 for LoTech, +2 for MidTech, +3 for HiTech, +4 for 
VHiTech, +5 UHiTech. For schools, where it states "EDU increased to n", add 
"or +1, whichever is higher." 

6. Not sure about Latin honours (sorry, *honors*...) degree suffixes - would 
prefer just "(honors)."

7. Why are Computer degrees BAs? Mine\'s a BSc.

8. Prerequisites for university are too easy - increase EDU to 8+ (ED8 Cert 
defines 6- as a "deficient education", yet it\'s good enough to get into 
Uni?).

9. Birthdate Determination - complete waste of space - just pick a day 
between 1 and 365.

10. Cold sleep weeks: nice idea. Two changes: first, Navy should spend more 
time (remember the Frozen Watch?) - make same as Marines. Second, IMHO 
enlisted men should spend more time frozen than officers.

11. Character Card: race and sex are missing. Might be useful to include the 
genetic data from PE?

12. Nobles. How much income does an Official Noble receive? How much land is 
granted by the m/o benefit? Include the section from TNE on addressing 
Nobles.

13. Marines. E4 should be Corporal, not L/Cpl.

14. Navy. Commander rank missing from between O4 and O5.

My reading of the Resources entry on page 35 and the side bar on p 42, leads 
me to different conclusions than Anders.  A TL 12 world can retrieve deeper 
oil reserves than a TL 4 one, as you note and as the rules allow, but that 
oil is a bigger "resource" for an industrialised world - more of the oil is 
used to create "high value" products.  A rough parallel would be the trade in 
crude oil compared with refineries near the oil fields and shipping (higher 
value) gasoline around.  I\'m sure you can argue that refineries are 
"infrastructure", but I see the world differently.

Another example: a TL 12 world can grow more crops on a given bit of land 
with its geneered seeds, but an industrial world can build the huge combine 
harvesters that allow millions of hectares to be harvested more efficiently.

I find no problem accepting (and trying to justify to others) a +2 Re mod for 
Industrial worlds.  Similarly, if the designers had chosen to have the 
industrial mod as a +2 to the effective TL for exploiting resource, I would 
accept that as well.  

If we view PE as an economic model then I would say that at least the 
following would effect the GWP: Industrialisation, infrastructure, TL, POP.
How these effects can most accurately model the "real world" is open to 
considerable debate, but I would always include industrialisation as a 
factor.

task system. This arrived sometime after Marc\'s post, but before I read
Marc\'s post in the Digest (Serendipity!). I would just like to expand on
the comments, briefly.

I decided about nine months ago to start gaming seriously again. Out came
MT, as although I bought a lot of TNE stuff in support of GDW, I much
prefered the older setting and the simpler rules.

Then I heard about T4 and bought a copy. I tried the new rules in the first
adventure and after the session changed task difficulties to 2D, 3D, 4D etc
in a straight progression to make tasks harder. This worked for me, but not
that well.

Marc posted his new system, so I adopted it as a trial. This seemed much
better until I ran a combat style session last night. This fell apart as I
felt a highly skilled PC was heavily penalised by having a low attribute.

I look again at KBv2 and reject my original thinking of \'I can\'t be
bothered with the multiplication\'. I feel a need (based on CTand MT) to
have a skill dominated system, with professional levels equal to skill-3.

I really like the MT task system, especially having re-read Joe Fugates\'
explainations of why it was designed as it was. However, the T4/KBv2 style
CT feel is easier for new players (none of my players have played Traveller
before).

In response to Andy Lilly: Andy, I agree the game has changed and the T4
rules are easy to introduce new players with, *but* having tried both
versions T4/T4.1 I am very uneasy with them. Maybe I\'m indoctrinated with
CT and MT but it seems unbalanced in use. (This isn\'t a flame - just a
personal gut feel).

Some points -
=============

1) The task system *can* be changed with impunity - so the screen may be
wrong, as will T4. But any scenarios that quote the difficulty code (eg
average) can be safely used, or back fitted. Give it a year or so and no
one will notice... they may even assume the screen has a typo! ;-)

2) Skills with numbers similar to CT/MT work for me, as I can use my old
back catalogue. Some ex-TNErs may disagree.

3) SF/SS don\'t work for me as written. And I\'m agnostic about 1/2 D - keep
it or bin it.

4) I\'m not necessarily advocating Ken\'s system, but it seems to be the best
I\'ve tried for T4.

5) Finally, Marc, if you don\'t want to drop the T4.1 system why not put in
a sidebar in the rules describing KBv2 as an official \'skill\' dominated
alternative that fits better with previous editions? Keeping everyone happy
so long as the task codes are the same...

Thanks you for the work so far - T4.1 is something I am looking for.

Close, P stands for Population Multiplier. The others are right, though.
The Pop multiplier give you a bit finer grain on the population of the
system, since all that the UWP gives you is an order of magnitude. A UWP
figure of 6 gives you millions of people, and a P value of 7 tells you
there are 7 million people there.

Most definately.  The idea that a talented beginner could beat
out and mediocre hack with experience would not be considered
reasonable on a lot of other lists.

If you add in the fact that there was a big disupute over
stat vs skill and then a long silence in which Kenneth
was the only one agitating, you have the making for
an obvious bias.  I\'m also on the GURPS list and I\'ll
say here what I said there.  You don\'t design systems
by apparent popular opinion.

My take is that the alternate task systems fix something I
don\'t see as broken (stats for skills), at least in the task
system, while leaving the one thing I don\'t like (variable
and large numbers of dice) intact (or worse off).  They
do this by introducing more math.

will have each spread some colonies out.  In addition, I am going to place
a few bizarre worlds here and there at random, though both colonies and
random worlds should likely be near a main.  I expect to have a roughly
similar distribution to that in the books, but with far fewer pop 6 or less
worlds that are not explicit colonies of some bigger world.

The UWP resources digit, combined with one for native life make it pretty
easy for a program to tell which worlds are congenial.

(I owe this fit of fiddling to Jeff Zeitlin and his alternative world
generation page.)

If you mean that no one else has strong feelings about the task system, I
believe you are wrong. I remember the great Task System thread about a
month ago, and estimate over a dozen house systems were posted. I posted
one myself. At least a few of the posters had "strong feelings about the
task system".

I and others have stated that the reason we felt compelled to propose
alternate task sytems was because of what we felt to be serious problems in
the existing task system. I can\'t speak for others, but I personally am not
one of those referees who is constantly fiddling with the rules. I am more
interested in role-playing and will change a rule only if I believe the
rule actually damages enjoyment of the game. I joined in the thread because
I feel the T4 task rules harm the game. I believe I gave specific examples
of what is wrong, but to avoid adding fuel to the flames if anyone wants
details please send me private email.

I have examined the new task rules included with the Referee\'s Screen, and
believe they have the same problem as the existing rules. Surely the fact
that there are so many alternate task rules proposed is evidence that there
is dissatisfaction with the current rules. For comparison, look at the
Psionics rules. They are at least as complex as the task rules, yet there
are comparitively few alternate Psionics postings, and those few are
usually designed to get a specific campaign effect. I believe this is
because most referees are satisfied with the Psionics rules, I know I am.
You are not doing a favor to the people who have supported the game for
years by passing this issue off as the whinings of a few malcontents, even
if there are some whiners among them.

During the time of the task system thread, I experimented with at least 6
different task systems, and actually used 4 in game sessions. Several
solved the problems in the T4 system but introduced other problems. After
this period of experimentation I finally decided to use KBv2.0. Not because
Kenneth whined the most, but because I felt his was the best system. It
solved the problems I saw in the existing system with the least changes to
the existing rules. It requires only two very localized changes to the
rules (different dice for difficulty and maintaining an "experience" stat);
it uses the task progression, terms, and DMs already published; and it is
easy to use with existing characters and adventures. No other proposal had
all these advantages. If you are going to revisit the task system for T4.1
I can think of no better system than KBv2.0.

>You are evil, you are. :)

Why, thank you! I\'m touched. ;->

A logical extention of my original idea is...

How about we drop attributes/characteristics/stats entirely from normal
task *resolution* and just use skills?  The stats are used to produce
the skill during CharGen and Experience with something like the
following:



First through Nth Gain -- increase skill points (SP) by controlling
                          attribute, option:  require completion of a
                          skill increase task to determine if you
                          increase skill points, and perhaps by how
                          much.

Skill Level used in task resolution = SP/3,d

Record both SP and Skill Level on Character Sheet.

Experience increases skill points (SP), so it takes 3 experience
increases to raise a Skill Level.

Injury (from combat or otherwise) provides -DM\'s to Skill Levels based
on levels of injury..tbd.

Stats are used for "Stats only" and "Unskilled" Task Resolution

Example:

 Str 3
 Dex 10
 Int 7

 First Term:
   Brawling 1st
   Dance 1st 
   Streetwise 1st
                  Skill
            SP    Level
 ======================           
 Brawling    3      1
 Dance      10      3
 Streetwise  7      2
 
 Second Term
  Brawling 2nd
  Streetwise  2nd
  Fast Talk  1st
                  Skill
            SP    Level
 ======================           
 Brawling    6      2
 Dance      10      3
 Fast Talk   7      2
 Streetwise 14      4
 
 Third Term
  Brawling 3rd
  Dance  2nd
  Streetwise 3rd
                  Skill
            SP    Level
 ======================           
 Brawling    9      3
 Dance      20      6
 Fast Talk   7      2
 Streetwise 21      7
 
Well, I was afraid the numbers would go up too fast, but it looks like
they might go up too slowly.  Maybe the *first* (and only the first)
Gain should receive twice the Stat?  I like the concept behind this
though.

What do *you* think?

I\'d rate this a "5 - least important", and I\'d like to vote for the exact
opposite:

T4 is weighted too heavily against skills.  Stats have a minor part in a 
character\'s success at a task throw, and these should NOT be equally weighted.

1 - most important.

>  2. Spectacular Success and Spectacular Failure are hard to do at easy and

2 - important, but not overwhelming

>  3.  It should be harder to roll SS the harder a task becomes.

3 - semi-important; if you keep this "proportional", it will happen via
the mechanics...

>  4.  Replace SS with SF in 3.

same vote - 3, semi-important...

>  5. I don\'t like the half-die. Get rid of it.

1 - most important.  Half dice get me laughed at in my gaming club, and
I run the Winter War Gaming Convention...

Marc - thanks for allowing the level of input from the gamers you are.

I had promised myself I wouldn\'t convolute this issue any further, but I
feel a burning need to make one point about the MT task system.

I have very fond memories of using the MT task system. I got to the point
where I was so comfortable with it as a referee that I could easily and
accurately bandy about tasks for the players to attempt.

However...

One of the problems with the MT task system was that if you were good
enough, you could actually wound a guy in assault battledress with an ACR
or Gauss rifle, if I recall correctly. This simply should not be possible.
The skills must weigh into the equation, but the mechanics must make
certain that physical impossibilities are accounted for.

Best,

Chris Griffen

Agreed, 2D6 system, more emphasis on skills over stats. I personally have 
always used and still do use the original task system as published in the 
early Travellers digest. Megatraveller got it right. TNE changed it to 
the house system - stupid move. T4 screwed it up. T4.1 hopefully back to 
2D6.

What do you think about the Skill from Stats idea I posted today? A low stat would increase skills slowly, average stat would increase skills faster, and high stats would increase skill rapidly. Stats aren\'t lowered, so PC\'s don\'t become easier to kill. Skill gains are multipliers, so they are more heavily weighted than through addition. Finally, it looks like it might work best with a return to some sort of 2 or 3 dice system. 

Take a look and tell me what you both think.

trying to devalue my vote here - just pointing out that for me Traveller is a
background more than a ruleset.)

My system is to divide the attribute by the number of tasks that the
character is attempting.  Thus, if you are driving and talking at the same
time your Dexterity is divided by two.  Driving, talking on your cell phone,
drinking coffee and fishing in your briefcase (like the ^$^%#^$ who nearly
ran me off the 404 yesterday) gets Dex divided by 4.

Because is most situations gamers are doing two things (at least, my group is
always talking if nothing else!), I rule that the attribute is divided by two
unless that character is alone and _undisturbed_, or unless the player makes
a point of role-playing a touchy "leave me alone" attitude.  Thus, if the
ship\'s engineer gets grumpy when under pressure, there\'s a reason.  The thief
who says she\'s concentrating onpicking the lock probably _won\'t_ hear the
security patrol, either! :-)

This does let "whizkids" do wonders, but only if they are not distracted. 
This matches what I\'ve observed at school, where I deal with kids of all
mental levels but usually low skill levels.

I use Macs when I can, Unix when I must, and Dos/Windows when I go to work.
 As a result, good traveller software for me is preferably Mac.

The stuff I am writing is a sim-empire dealy that will take the big data
file, add the economic factors, and then let you iterate for a year or two
using reasonable assumptions for behavior.

Since a real program to do the evolution, traderoute building, and so on,
could be a lot smarter, some planning smarts would be nice, and something
that lets me see what my empire is doing would also be good.

I agree with Hans on this one.  Given the work of DGP on defining TL\'s, 
where an individual world can range pretty far in terms of the separate 
TL items (land transport, space transport, energy, materials, etc. etc.), 
we know that each world has a range of technologies being produced 
locally.  Maybe they make TL 9 weapons and computers, but their personal 
transportation is stuck at TL 6, for instance.

When you move that out to the Imperium at large, knowing that each world 
has its own range of TL\'s, and that there are thousands of worlds in the 
Imperium...what TL is the Imperium?

It makes a lot of sense for the interstellar government to define its TL 
primarily by the jump technology in use.  Individual worlds would 
probably be best defined by the average of their various TL\'s.

So, yeah, there could be a couple of worlds in the Ramshackle Empire that 
had TL 14 personal weapons, armor, and medical equipment.  They wouldn\'t 
have Jump-5, because the RoM would almost certainly have grabbed that and 
used it for themselves, and thus be TL 14 as well.  But, having a range 
of other higher-tech products available on some (very few) worlds...sure, it 
makes sense to me.

   ( 1 ) Most Important.  Both Stats and Skills are important, but
         neither should completely dominate the other.  Right now, it
         seems Stats are in a dominating position.

    ( 3 ) Marc, Important.  I think all three of these are
          inter-related, and get the same ranking.  SS\'s should become
          harder to achieve at harder levels.  SF\'s should become easier
          to acheive at harder levels.  Frankly, though you could ditch
          SS and SF and it wouldn\'t bother me too much.  Maybe replace
          the concepts with degrees of success and failure.

> =============================================================

    ( 2 ) Very Important.  I\'d make it a one, personally, but that\'s
          just my distaste for 1/2 dice.  Go to d10 or d20 and I won\'t
          complain, but 1/2 a d6 and it sticks in my craw.  Shoot!  I\'d
          even accept a d3 (yes, I know what that is, but if the darn
          die was commonly available I wouldn\'t mind using it too much),
          but not in combination *with* a handful of d6\'s.  Maybe it\'s
          not logical, but it\'s the way I feel.

I do agree very strongly that the task system needs to be changed.  While
I\'m not wild about Kevin\'s Kv 2.0 it gives a feel closer to the classic
system.  I feel making the Attribues so dominant is a mistake.  If you plan
to use the straight Attributes the skill range should be raised to same
levels (ie 1 to F).  This would also solve what some think are excessive
skill levels in the Character generation.

I to would go with a variation on the MegaTraveller system.
There are things about T4 that I don\'t like, but the 
proposed alternates "fix" things I don\'t see as broken
and leave things I don\'t like (like multiple and variable
dice) intact.

product well worth our attention - note that everybody is talking about
"improving" it, not "replacing" it (unlike FS).

It seems to me that the sidebar on dividing technology (p.52) could have
picked elements more appropriate to the book.  I had a quick look
through the book to see what was affected by TL:

    Resources Exploitable: Materials Tech.
    Infrastructure limit:  Environment Tech (combination of Energy,
                           Information & Transport)?
    R&D limit:             Research & Development Tech.
    Uplift limit:          Matching element?
    Population Change:     Medical Tech.
    Popularity:            Medical Tech?*
    UMP Attack & Defense:  Military Tech (not mentioned).
    UMP Transport & Jump:  Transport Tech.
    plus various meta-tasks.

    * Popularity is already directly affected by Infrastructure,
      otherwise I\'d have included Environment too.

The omission of Miltech seems particularly strange (though I\'ve just
learned here that the authors of Economics & Planetary Development
didn\'t write the War chapter, so I can see how it happened).

My suggestion: replace Research with Military Tech, then use the
*highest* component TL as the limit for R&D.  Use the categories above
for which element to use in which case (for Environment tech, use a
rounded average of Energy/Info/Transport).

It seems to me that *for a Pocket Empires game*, there is no reason to
divide TL unless it has some game effect.  From a "colour" POV, I\'m all
in favour of expansions like the WBH tech profile, but that particular
set doesn\'t mesh well with PE rules - hence my suggestion above.

An additional rule to help make use of this: if you want to make sure
you improve a particular element, you can use "directed" research and/or
uplift.  If you do this, a roll of 1 for that element is treated as a 2
(i.e., up one level).  However, for any other element, a 6 is treated as
a 5, so no other element can increase by 2 levels.

Comments?  Places I\'ve missed affected by TL?

1----kinda.  Skill should really, IMHO, determine how difficult the
task is, then the attribute determines how good you are within a
given skill level.

For example a skill 5 Medic (aka a surgeon) might have dex 6, so
he\'d have a target number of 6 on an easy task for simple surgery.

A medic 1 might have dex 15, but he\'d have a Staggering task level
on the same operation.  

Using 1d6=Easy, +1d6 for each level that\'s a TN of 6 on 1d6 for the
surgeon, and a 15 on 5d6 for the medic.

This makes no sense to me (I need to eat :-)

P= Population Modifier  If Pop is 4, and this diget is 6, it means that
60,000 folks live here.

B= Belts, of the planetoid variety.

G= Gas giants.

This is a great idea, and I\'m working it into a campaign I\'m going to try

I\'m going to put up my designs Real Soon Now.. I don\'t have decent mapping
software yet (saving up for adobe) so the deck plans will have to wait.

I run MS-DOS 6.22 and Win 3.1.  Based on what page count telles me, about
60% of the visitors to my Traveller page use Windows, 35% Macs, and the
other 5% an odd mixture of Linux, Unix, os/2, and the every-popular "other."

Methinks I spoke too soon... 

As the bandwidth on this issue will be going on for months, at least
until Marc responds, I will add some more fuel to the fire.  

I like Kenneth\'s task system... I seems to work, and would be a good
fix. But a fix only. If I had to pick, change the whole damn thing. 

I do not like rolling more then two dice. Why? Silly reason, Traveller
has always been 2D6. 

Now if we are going to just fix the system, Kenneth\'s task system does
the job. If we are going to start from scratch... Teak MT, or start
fresh, and lets be done with it! 

No matter what Marc may feel on this subject, the size of the response
is a good indication of how many people feel that the current system is
not working. (So far about 2 people say keep, 30+ fix)

I work with advertising and communications firms around the world. If
one of my clients asked me what should we do, and had data that
indicated this trend, I would recommend to my client: FIX THE SYSTEM
NOW! No matter what line of work you are in, the old adage "the customer
is always right" will still get you far. 

Ken... keep up the good work, you have reflected many of our feelings
over the past few months. 

Marc... do not let Ken\'s wall of words distract you from the core idea
that rest within... The system needs fixen. 

Now with that bit of fuel... Burn baby burn!

Nuff Said.

I whole heartedly, as a GM and player of T4, would like to see KBv2.0
included in any future task system update or revision.  Nothing

I have my own house rule after having used all traveller task systems
since 1978.

My group has wrestled hard with this one. We like a system where skill
matters. Especially since skills are hard to get in comparison to
generated attributes.

work. When a character contemplates career skills, a low dexterity charac=

would rightly decide to avoid learning that skill.=20

Consider three characters: Three (with Dex 3); Seven (with an average Dex=
 7),
and Eleven (with Dex 11). Eleven has the best aptitude for the skill, but
without training is unable to safely interact with explosives; Three has =
the
worst aptitude. All three are selected to attend a class on explosives; a=

three successfully complete the training, and all three receive
Demolitions-1.

Consider three tasks involving explosives: Easy (the character must roll
equal to or less than Dex + Demolitions on 1D; Average (roll equal to or =
less
than Dex + Demolitions on 2D), and Difficult (roll equal to or less than =
Dex
+ Demolitions on 2.5D). Tasks are more fully explained in the chapter on
Tasks.

Easy Tasks. When Eleven tries the Easy task, he automatically succeeds (s=

Dex 11 plus Demolitions-1 =3D 12, and the worst roll possible on 1D is on=
ly 6).
When Seven tries the Easy task, she automatically succeeds (since Dex 7 p=

Demolitions-1 =3D 8, and the worst roll possible on 1D is only 6). Three,
however is at a disadvantage: his low Dexterity 3 plus Demolitions-1 =3D =
4
means that even on this Easy task, he has a 33% chance of failure.

Average Tasks. When Eleven tries the Average task, he automatically succe=
eds
(since Dex 11 plus Demolitions-1 =3D 12, and the worst roll possible on 2=
D is
still 12). When Seven tries the Average task, she succeeds 72% of the tim=
e
and fails 28% of the time (since Dex 7 plus Demolitions-1 =3D 8, and the
possible rolls extend up to 12). Three knows (or should know) better than=
 to
try an Average task (his low Dexterity 3 plus Demolitions-1 =3D 4 means t=
hat on
this Average task, he has an 83% chance of failure).

Difficult Tasks. When Eleven tries the Difficult task, he succeeds 91% of=
 the
time (since Dex 11 plus Demolitions-1 =3D 12 and the highest roll possibl=
e is
15). When Seven tries the Difficult task, she succeeds 43% of the time an=

fails 57% of the time (since Dex 7 plus Demolitions-1 =3D 8). Three knows=
 (or
should know) better than to try an Difficult task (his low Dexterity 3 pl=

Demolitions-1 =3D 4 means that on this Difficult task, he has an 96% chan=

failure). Spectacular Failure happens if the roll is three 1=92s. There i=
s, for
each of these characters, a 1% chance of Spectacular Failure; and a 1% ch=
ance
of Spectacular Success regardless of skill.

More Training. Three may decide that regardless of his aptitude, he wants=
 to
be a Demolitions Expert and he pursues nine years of study and practice a=
nd
eventually reaches the same level of achievement as Eleven (since Dex 3+
Demolitions-9 is the same as Dex 11 and Demolitions-9 when we consider
Demolitions as a Dexterity based activity). If Eleven made no improvement=
s in
his skill, and Three made these major improvements, than Three would
certainly be more of an expert, with more knowledge, theoretical experien=
ce,
and even practical experience; but when it came to defusing bombs, the El=
even
(with Demolitions-1) and Three (with Demolitions-9) would be about equal.
They might make a good team: Three giving instructions and advice and Ele=
ven
doing the actual nimble finger work.

Other Skills; Other Aptitudes
Two medically trained individuals are in an operating room involved in op=
en
heart surgery. Three (remember that he has Dex 3) has Medical-6; Eleven (=
Dex
11) has Medical-1. A basic task involving surgery (Average difficulty; no
other modifiers) indicates that Three has an 83% chance of success; Eleve=
n
has a 100% chance of success. The task is probably suturing up after the
operation. A different task might be Fixing the Defective Valve (Difficul=
t,
with modifiers +2 for Good Facilities; +2 for Good Support Team; +2 for G=
ood
Instruments, and +1 for Experience and Training in this specific procedur=
e):
Three has 100% chance of success and So does Eleven. More than that, each=
 has
a 1% chance of Spectacular Success, and each has a 1% chance of Spectacul=
ar
Failure. Eleven, not being a doctor, would probably never attempt the tas=
k
for fear of prosecution (unlicensed practice of medicine) or lawsuits (fo=
r
negligence). If Three dropped over from heart attack himself, then the
emergency could well dictate that Eleven step in and save the patient=92s=
 life.
If that 1% chance of Spectacular Failure doesn=92t come up, then Eleven l=
ooks
like a hero (and probably gets sent to Medical School).

The purpose of the Traveller task system and its mix of characteristics a=
nd
skills is provide a means of resolving situations; the details of those
situations in light of the tasks, skills, and characteristics become the
basis for the story-telling aspects of Traveller adventures.

skill and 1/3 stat.

2,3,4 are all rated at the same level.  There is an inverse relation

increases from Easy to Impossible, the chance of SS should drop, while the
chance of SF should rise.

5. This is the least important fix.  A 1/2die is merely an annoyance, but a

Thanks for all the time and effort you have put into Traveller, and all the

Concerning the tasklist.  While I agree that skills should play a bigger

the T4 system is be officially changed I would hope that access to this
information would be made available to everyone who has purchased T4
with no further cost. =20

In here I think is the problem.  So far only a few select Internet
user\'s have expressed an interest in changing the T4 rules.  How is
Imperium Games supposed to gauge the wishes of players worldwide in this
issue?  Further more in order to make the suggested changes many people
will have to put long hard work into making the new rules, playtesting,
writing, publishing and distributing the alterations.  That\'s a lot of
work to go into a product that may not be will received.  Even if it is
well recieved what about users of the original T4.  Few I would think
would want to continue repurchasing the rules time and time again. =20

*****I think the following might be a solution:
If it is we the TML that wish the changes to be made then let us be the
ones to do it.  With Marc\'s permission I should think that the list can
develope and post on the Internet its own HOUSE RULES variant.  Gamer\'s
outside the internet could continue to use the established system
without any BUMPS that we might cause by changing the whole system.=20
Since it is posted on the internet and we are the ones wanting it WE can
play HOWEVER WE LIKE. =20

Let us be considerate of ALL gamers not just us.  While we would like to

Well, Thank you.  My players have always liked it.

I was thinking of using this as a basis of a T4.1 Advanced CharGen system,
maybe as a new _B4:Citizens of the Imperium_, but I would like to call it
_Subjects of the Emperor_.

I just got then T4.1 chargen sheets from MM.  I shall be converting them to
Task-Based chargen, and posting parts of them to the TML during this
weekend.

Although I have tinkered with the MT system over those years.  One of the
most satisfying change is the Stat Mods:

Stat	Mod
0	-3
1-2	-2
3-5	-1
6-8	+0
9-11	+1
12-14	+2
15+	+3

This normalizes the stat mod around 7-Human normal.  It gives a bonus for
higher than average, while it penalizes for lower than averege.  Most
characters (people) fall into the -1 to +1 range  This table is on a margin
at the side of the charsheet for easy reference during play.

Also, I\'ve changed the difficulty levels to match T4\'s terminology:

DifLevel		Roll 2d
- ----	----
Easy		3+
Average		7+
Difficult		11+
Formidable	15+
Staggering	19+
Impossible	23+

MaxDM +10

And, due to the higher levels of skills in T4, I\'ve modified the skill
aquisition in T4.  In chargen, instead of skill levels, you recieve skill
points.  These points are then convereted to skill levels.

Level	Points
- ----	----
1	1
2	2
3	4
4	6
5	9
6	12
7	16

The points then become a way of increasing your skill levels during
adventuring.  A character may recieve 2-4 points a year adventuring.  When
recieved, they are assigned to *specific skills*.  It costs 1 to go from no
skill to level-0 only after chargen due to the time/difficult of obtaining
materials, instructors, time away from work, etc.
 
To go from Skill Level	To Level		Costs 
none			0		1	
0			1		1
1			2		1
2			3		2
3			4		2
4			5		3
5			6		3
6			7		4
etc

I really need to write this up in a neater format one of these days.

I think so, too.  If we had a task system everyone could agree on (me, I 
don\'t care; I\'ll come up with something that works for me, no matter 
which system is published.  I think everyone else here will, too.  The 
primary concern should, IMO, be publishing a system that *new players* 
can quickly grasp and which they will enjoy.), I think more folks would be 
finding that the combat system works well.  Turns out Les did a good job 
on it.

:)  If so, please let me know how it goes.

Hmm...
OK- lets see what is needed for a person with a Gauss Rifle to wound a guy
in BattleDress.

Weapons Statistics:	Gauss(4mm):		Pen:7/4 Dmg:4
Armour Statistics:	BattledressTL14:	18

Max roll allowed under MT Task system: 20
Max level of success: +16

Assume that the guy shooting rolls a 20, and rolls 16 over what he needs to
hit. (he needed an Easy(3+) to hit)
According to the MT Refs Screen, this would deliver an 8pt wound to the guy
in battledress.
If the shooter rolled a 18, he would inflict only 4pts.

While this may sound ridiculous, the chances of it happening are incredibly
small.  But, for a good marksman with a good rifle, it is *possible*
(although very unlikely) that he may hit the BattleDress at a vulnerable
point -  a joint, the helmet seal, etc.

However, this is an artifact of the MT combat system, not the task system. 
T4 uses a different combat system.  Grafting the MT task system onto the T4
system would not carry over that above problem.

Just figure someone should point out that reducing attributes would also
work.

What about simply dividing attributes by a fixed number (unless you like my
suggestion for dividing by number of simultaneous tasks/distractions)? 
Dividing by 5 gives you MegaTraveller.  This would be simple to do.  (So
would another number.)  Dividing by 4 would also be easy.  Whatever you pick,
adjust the number of dice to fit with this.

Very simple, minimal change.

Yup.  That\'s really a high compliment.  Extensions, variants, expansions 
- - all these things take time.  If someone is willing to spend his or her 
most precious resource (namely, time) on making something I wrote his or 
her own, that\'s a high compliment indeed.

The tone of the email containing those expansions, extensions, or 
variants makes all the difference in the world, though.  The two-edged 
sword of having instant communications with your customers. :)

Makes sense to me; and I wrote the particular sidebar under 
consideration. :)  More or less, it was just a color thing.  We wanted to 
have a bit more information on a lot of the basic topics, and we wanted 
to make the sidebars that contained that information provide usable rules at 
the same time.  Thus, you get the little rules tacked on to the end of 
some (i.e., how to integrate supply and demand into your regular 
Traveller campaign at the end of the Supply and Demand sidebar), and 
rules integrated into others (such as the Technology one you\'re referring 
to; instead of explaining what technology was comprised of, then offering 
a little rule at the end, I wrote a little rule that did the explaining 
for me).

But, if I\'d had the time to think about it, I like to believe I would 
have come up with something very like what you have posted.

That\'s why I\'ve decided that in my campaign, all task rolls will be 
against the skill only. Attribute comes into play in the development of 
skills, or in special Attribute "tasks" such as Endurance rolls to avoid 
passing out, or strength rolls to lift things.

Here\'s the way it\'s going to work for me (using FUDGE nomenclature, since 
that\'s what I\'ve decided upon)

Characters begin by rolling their attributes. Then they enter careers as 
per normal Traveller generation. When the player has a chance to choose a 
skill table, they get 4 Experience Points towards their rolled skill or 
attribute. Skills and Attributes can only be raised one level at a time, 
excess EP are set aside for use during the game as "FUDGE" points

Default skills start at a level of "Poor". Non-default skills are

*This would be the Traveller Level equivalent, assuming maximum 
controlling attribute. eg Pilot-6 would be Excellent Pilot skill.

Attributes require 3x the EP of Skills

If the desired skill level is greater than the skill\'s controlling 
attribute, there is a "surcharge" of 2 EP

So, if my Dexterity is Fair, and I wish to raise my Gun Combat skill from 
Good to Excellent, I need to pay 6 EP (4 + 2 low attr. surcharge)

I\'m going to modify my FUDGE docs this weekend to reflect my decision to 
make all Task Rolls skill based. (Like vanilla FUDGE)

I own a Mac. I use a PC at work. Just installed Win95 there. Was a little 
rough going when my mouse ceased working after installation. But I\'m not 
spineless or dumb, I mucked with the hardware configs through keyboard 
control and got it working...

I\'m happy to finally trash the Windows 3.11 though, I will admit Win95 to 
be superior to that dog. (It better be superior, since it swiped the 
remaining things to swipe from the MacOS UI ;)

I\'m always careful to avoid insulting honest, hard-working, intelligent 
users of other operating systems. Its the weenie horde that knows 
absolutely zip about Mac, swallows all the tripe fed to us by the mass 
media, and runs through Usenet screaming "MACS SUCK! Macs are toys! 
Apple\'s dead!" that gets me rankled.

If I understand the question and the context in which you\'ve placed it, 
you\'re asking "How much of Pocket Empires would you like to see simulated 
in software?"

At a bare minimum, world resource data and development, how many Resource 
Units and so forth, that are produced by the empire needs to be tracked. 
I think I could whip up a program to track world development, RU 
allocation, and so forth, given a couple free saturday afternoons.

My utopian answer is "Everything". I\'d like to see the whole book 
transformed into a "server" program, which players all over the world can 
each control a world, build families, form alliances, send their commands 
and build empires!

It would be not unlike those old text-based BBS games, except with more 
detail and a Traveller feel. Or similar to those Empire building games 
such as Nobunaga\'s Ambition. Ahhh... I still remember TW2002, Operation 
Overkill, Stellar Empires... that was cool.

his average attribute should likewise contribute a 25% chance of success,

1) I think that this is the most important issue.  Personally, I\'d like to
see stats:skills weighted at the very minimum 1:2 and preferably 1:3.

4) I\'m not that excited about SS or SF issues.  I\'ve tweaked KB v2.0 so
that 3 1\'s is a SS (with more 1\'s meaning a more spectacular success) and
ditto for 6\'s for SF\'s.  I also tend to interpret task rolls so that the
lower the roll the better the job the character did.  And that about works
for me.

anything terribly complex and timeconsuming.

1)  I\'m dead-set against the D3 in the task system.  However, I kinda like
using them in rolling damage; my group uses a few FF&S designed weapons
(Famille Spofulam Armaments gauss toys, to be precise), and I think that
the extra die gives a little better resolution in terms of the damage
spectrum.  However, since this won\'t be a problem for anyone else, please
interpret this as a vote against D3\'s in general; for most people they
wouldn\'t add much.

haven\'t tried KBv2 at all, but I agree with the comments about skills vs
stats, stats are the base that skills build upon and should not count
higher as they appear to in the trial runs we have made. The 1/2 dice
should be junked, a neat idea that doesn\'t work. Again, this is my own
opinion, but I have always like sytems with the minimuim of dice to
roll. The talk of MT\'s task system (alas the only version of Traveller
that I DON\'T own the rules for!) with a 2 die task system interest me
very much! (If anyone has the time, I would love to see a synopsis of
the system in a private e-mail). At any rate these should be concidered
as my "vote" for revisions in T4.1.

not have much incentive to stay in the service.  One of the things that
made CT so unique were the detailed characters.  With a weaker incentive to
re-enlist and the characters being exceptional by virtue of their stats
rather than their skills, T4 moves towards the "14 year old sword-swinger"
RPG tradition.

I still use MT\'s system, except that the modifyer is stat/4 instead of
stat/5.  It makes sense:  if you have at least minimal ability, you get the
same advantage of skill-1; if you are above average, you get the same
advantage a professional would, etc.  You do not have to add up a hand-full

  a) If the adjusted dice roll succeeds by *at least* four points (i.e., it

An average Joe (skill level 2, stat 7) rolls 2d6 +2 +2 (for a total of
  2d6+4).  
He rolls a "10+" ("Average/Routine") 26 times out of 36.  
  ("10+" on 2d6+4 = "6+" on 2d6 = (5+6+5+4+3+2+1) / 36 = 26 / 36) 
He rolls a "6+" ("Easy/Simple") all the time.  
He *never* rolls a "22+" ("Impossible").  

(Example #2): 

Super-Joe (skill level 6, stat 15) rolls 2d6 +6 +5 (for a total of 2d6+11).  
He rolls a "10+" (Avg/Rtn) all the time.  
He rolls a "22+" (Impsbl) only *3* times out of 36.  
  ("22+" on 2d6+11 = "11+" on 2d6 = (2+1) / 36 = 3 / 36)

Seriously, I hope you got my post on my ideas for character =
generation, and the decoupling of skills and attributes. I put a =
table in there based on FUDGE skill levels, but it could be =
theoretically adapted to any task system...

The basics are:

1. Experience Points, (Skill Points, if you prefer) are awarded to =
advance skill levels; during the game, or during character generation.

2. EP cost to advance a skill level depends upon the magnitude of the =
skill\'s controlling attribute.

3. Task Rolls are rolled against the Skill Level *only*. Exceptions =
would be physical, mental or social tasks requiring no skill. (eg. =
exhaustion rolls vs. END, lifting v. STR, etc.)

I\'m not sure how you want your skill levels to equate to current =
traveller, but =A1ay caramba! Streetwise-7 after 3 increases!? That\'s =
FAST. I guess it depends on what kind of dice mechanic one comes up =
with.

Your system of advancement is linear, with the rate of advancement =
dependent upon the controlling attribute. High attribute=3Dfast =
advancement.

My system (based on FUDGE\'s experience section) assumes that =
characters advance at the same rate for the lowest skill levels, =
until a "threshold" corresponding to each\'s controlling attribute is =
reached. At that point, the low attribute character is penalized.

I guess it\'s a matter of taste, but chew on this: An average guy and =
a really educated guy go to _basic_ law school. Should one come out =
with a higher skill than the other? Or should both come out with the =
same Law-1 skill?

Now they\'ve advanced a bit, and wish to train for Law-4 for example, =
by going to Harvard. The average guy is in over his head, he\'s got to =
repeat the year. The really educated chap comes out easily with his =
Law-4.

Here\'s my suggestion to revise your system, note that I\'m rating =
advancement on a similar scale to CT (1=3Dlow skill, 6=3Dreally high =
skill):

First through Nth Gain -- increase skill points (SP) by 3 for each =
roll
                          on the table if skill points < controlling
                          attribute. Otherwise, increase skill points =
by 2.
                          option:  require completion of a
                          skill increase task to determine if you
                          increase skill points, and perhaps by how
                          much.

Skill Level used in task resolution =3D SP/3,d

Record both SP and Skill Level on Character Sheet.

Experience increases skill points (SP), so it takes 3 experience
increases to raise a Skill Level.

Injury (from combat or otherwise) provides -DM\'s to Skill Levels based
on levels of injury..tbd.

Stats are used for "Stats only" and "Unskilled" Task Resolution

So, low Strength limited Brawling advancement by 2 levels, average =

PS. I considered making the penalty for advancement beyond Attribute =
capability change as the skill increases, but I\'m not convinced =
that\'s necessary... I\'m still mulling it over.

Brad,

While I think you have a very good point in saying that there is no way for
IG to know what the rest of the world thinks, you are overlooking one minor
aspect - the task system was already going to change in T4.1. Hopefully,
any new system developed for T4.1 will slot in to the existing (revised)
rules with very little modification, just as KBv1.1 and KBv2 do now.

Cheers,
Jason

Glenn,

I see what you\'re talking about, and it *does* make sense. I still think higher controlling Stats should allow for faster advance even at lower skill levels.  I\'ll have to think on that.  

I\'m still concerned by the levels we\'re getting here.  The Streetwise 4 our PC has after 5 gains in it is pitifully low as a stand along target number against *any* number of 6 sided dice. 

About the FUDGE material, yes I got it and have been tinkering with it some.  I\'m not bringing up things that don\'t use d6 in this thread though, because of all the "d6-fanatics" here. ;->

with respect to the task system, I\'m glad you\'re willing to discuss the 
reasons behind the decisions -- even if in the end I disagree with them, 
at least I will be aware of the rationale and adjust things in the game I 
run accordingly.


On 1997-06-19 17:54 thus spake Marc Miller:

>A character\'s six characteristics are a measure of that character\'s ability

I understand the rationale. I think many people on this list have a 
problem with that line of reasoning for (mainly) the following reasons:

1. There are more only 6 characteristics, and many skills, therefore high 
characteristics encourage "munchkinism" where characters with high 
characteristics take lots of low level skills and are good at everything, 
from ballet to demolitions to piloting an aircraft.

2. If skills were more relevant than characteristics to the task roll, 
characters roles become more defined. Someone with high astrogation skill 
would be an astrogator, high engineering skill means you\'re an engineer. 
If characteristics are more important, characters become more bland and 
one-dimensional. Anyone with High EDU is a good engineer, and astrogator, 
and ...

3. The way characters are developed through the Character generation 
charts and tables _imply_ that in the Traveller universe, training is 
more important than natural ability. The task system should reflect this.

The great tragedy, imho, is that the jewel of the traveller game, 
character generation, is tarnished by a task system that lessens the 
value of skills gained during generation.

>The purpose of the Traveller task system and its mix of characteristics and
>skills is provide a means of resolving situations; the details of those
>situations in light of the tasks, skills, and characteristics become the
>basis for the story-telling aspects of Traveller adventures.

Right. I think though, that a certain debate has ensued over what kind of 
story-telling Traveller is. Is it a space-opera style of storytelling, 
where Flash Gordon is good at many different skills by virtue of high 
attributes? Or is it a science-fiction style, where training is paramount 
to success, and young-bucks can only match their elders by years of 
training, not some 4 week correspondence course.

This is where many disagree. I prefer to play a science-fiction style, 
and my view is that characteristics limit skill advancement, they do not 
contribute directly to the success of a task.

Now, this may just be a difference in definition of "Skill". Using your 
rationale, "Three" with Demolitions-1 doesn\'t have the same skill as 
"Eleven" with Demolitions-1. Although they have the same Demolitions 
Skill Level, "Eleven" is more highly skilled by virtue of his Dexterity.

I prefer a more rigourous definition of "Skill". A Skill-1 person is 
always less skilled than a Skill-3 person who is always less skilled than 
a Skill-6 person. That definition is closer to the Classic Traveller 
ideal: glance at the sheet, see Enginering-6 and say, "Beam me up Scotty!"

That definition means more diversity, and fewer one dimensional 
characters; there can be good pilots who took a few lessons in dance, but 
aren\'t really great dancers, Einsteins can be great at Physics but never 
could get the hang of Biology, etc...

- ----

Anyways, what I\'m more interested in is a good Task description 
"framework" to hang a dice mechanic upon. And from your post earlier this 
year, I\'m sure I won\'t be disappointed. Whether you decide 
characteristics are base, or skills are base, I\'m glad there is a 
consistant task format, and difficulty level scale.

We "tinkerers" can then add whatever dice rolling mechanism, and 
characteristic and skill conversion we want onto that.

I\'m sorry, but "previously published material" has _numerous_ references
to rather _extreme_ tech for the Rule of Man.  Now mind you, I am not
advocating a uniformly high tech, but I could accept a rather high one
on the Rimward end (mainly limited to the area of the old TC), and
occasional disemenation into the coreward areas.  Tech 14 anywhere
coreward of the line between the "thumb" of the Great Rift and the Delphi
Rift, in the form of relics/artifacts/what-have-you, does not strike me
as unreasonable.

References are scattered throughout CT and MT (of which I have everything
major that was ever printed) and having them in T4 _is_ consistent, and
IMO shows just how well these guys are doing their homework.

Actually, this rationale is purely based upon the comparatively scant
references to TC/RoM tech that we have, and is mostly an extrapolation
upon jump number available to the TC Navy.  That is not necessarily
the case for a full spread (breakdown ala MT) of the Tech in several
categories.

I don\'t see this as a treasure hunt.  If anyone researches the published
record, the precedent (avoiding the \'c\' word :) is one clear case of the
table that Carlos refers to (below).  Versus numerous (and I do not
exaggerate, here numerous being an order of magnitude higher :) references
that confirm very clearly that the RoM tech was as high as the TI in
M1100, and even higher.

Thank you.  We\'ve been researching this issue particularly knowing that it
is a thorn in the side of a lot of people.  Unfortunately, I think this is
a case of cognitive dissonance on the part of those who don\'t want to think
of the RoM tech as high, even by TI standards.

I have to disagree.  Furthermore, the contention that RoM was NOT of the
TL that has been purported here has far more dire consequences for the
published record of CT, MT, and T4.  TNE doesn\'t care because everything
(well almost) is relic tech. :-)

Something I said above, bears repeating.  These guys _are_ doing their
homework (though you may have them on the Grandfather\'s offspring and their
offspring, I still have to read that).  I don\'t think we should be pounding
on them for that.  Let them work on fixing other things that there are to
complain about, and not spend an excessive amount of time fixing things
that have been established across several eras.

Not as well.  Attributes should be left alone to reduce math--because 
attributes decrease when  character is wounded.

The only thing we should do with an attribute is add it to something 
else.

Let\'s keep it simple.

I got one of them. I love this little toy, it would be great if you could
make some Traveller software for it! It would be so handy for situations
like generating characters or playing in places like a coffee shop.

Software I would like to see is a \'quickie\' character generator for NPCs, a
character name and foreign word generator, starship and personal combat
assistants. The assistant software would do things like track ranges,
damage, initiative, and pool totals for all combatants, and provide a
checklist of DMs and steps.

I think that T4 was a great idea that has had a bad implementation.  
I\'ll show you why MT\'s system may not be the best choice for change 
(everybody knows that game mechanics are my thing), but I\'ll post on 
that later.

Right now, I was just curious about where everybody\'s thoughts were 
standing on the task system.  I\'ve collected 68 messages from people 
advocating change in the T4 task system.

I\'ve seen a lot of support for the MT task system lately, and I went 
through those 68 posts to see who wanted what. 

Given the recent posts, I was surprised at what I found.

Here\'s the results:

Total number of people who posted advocating a task system change to 
date:  68

Total number of people who did not advocate a system, but just want 
the thing changed to emphasize skills more:  35

Now, here\'s where it gets interesting--

Total number of people (out of the 33 remaining) who advocate using 
the MT system or some variant of it:  7

And...

Total number of people who endorse KBv2.0:  26

I just thought that it was interesting, given the traffic lately on 
the MT task system, that KBv2.0 is endorsed by a 3:1 margin over the 
MT task system.

Like I said--MT was a good system, but T4\'s is better if we fix it.

We might need to come up with some other tweak (besides KBv2.0), but 
I definitely think we should stay along T4 lines over MT.

I\'ll post why MT is probably not a good choice for the T4 task system 
later--after I\'ve collected all of my support and data.

Wow!  Spend nearly a week straight working on the car and suddenly I
have 444 TML messages!  This thread caught my attention immediately,
however, and merited a quick response.

I, too, believe that stat points and skill points do not translate
well in a 1:1 ratio.  I believe that makes me #41 in this thread.

Kenneth states his point *so well* that I don\'t think I have anything
to add.  His reasons are my reasons... he just voices his opinion
stronger than most of us :)

As for the half-die, I couldn\'t care less.  It is of trivial concern
compared to the current task system.  KBv2.0 works well... just
because it does away with d3\'s is purely a trivial bonus.  If I were
currently reffing a game of Traveller, I would use KBv2.0-- not
because it does away with the half-die, but because it more accurately
(IMHO) depicts the effect of stat points vs. skill points.

I also like the Babylon project rules. The use of specialisation in skills
(With a bonus to your roll)
and the different approach in the random factor ( A plus dice and minus
dice) deserve to be emulated.
Esp. the specialisation - i.e. You are a scout who has pilot-3 and you
decide to specialise in the scout ship
you have always flown. This is just so intuitive. Anyone want a stab at some
house rules.

Best of all is the combat system with the dinky picture of your opponant ("
Wow, I shoot him in the head!...")

Culture and science advances by the synthesis of ideas. Look over some other
gamers shoulders 
and synthesise today.

BTW When I told my friend who plays Champions about the number of dice
debate...he laughed.

"Seven dice, you call that a lot? Thats a minor flesh wound."

Note: If you include me as a pro vote, you have to make it
clear that you are only counting votes for _any_ changes.
(which might even include Marc Miller since he will problably
tinker with the system even if he keeps the same basic system).
In fact, while I would go with a MT type system, I disagree
with a lot of the proposed changes....

Or you could:

a) ask nicely,
b) post your message with its own unique Subject header, and
c) include some information regarding *why* you can\'t seem to

I second this statement.  Besides, the extra time it takes to add up
on or two more dice (specifically, for the more difficult levels)
merely adds to the suspense.

Player: "Did I make it?"

Ref: "Hold on.  I\'m still counting."

Player: "The roof-top was only 60 feet away and I had a good running
	start.  Hurry up."

Ref: "Shut up.  I told you it was an Impossible task.  You *knew* how
	many dice were involved.  Now look what you\'ve done.  I\'m gonna
	have to start over..."

Player: "Argh!"

As a matter of fact, yes.  There\'s a Spanish CT boxed set still looking for

It\'s inelegant, but it\'s hardly a fatal flaw.

Well, I used to be a little more vocal on the list years ago when I first
joined back around 1990.  In those days people were still bemoaning the
errata in MegaTraveller and debating the shortcomings of the MT task
system.  (*sigh*, nostalgia).

Generally, I prefer to leave the cut-and-thrust of discussion to those who
hold more passionate opinions than me.  Also, I don\'t have a great deal of
time to spare.  But I\'ll still be around, lurking...

IMPORTANCE: 1

I have tried out the T4 task system, and **when coupled with the 
existing character gen system** attributes are worth too much.  As 
an old CT player, I never really got into the MT \'add stat/5\' thing, 
so T4 came as a real shock to me.  I don\'t mind the stat having an 
effect, in fact I think it\'s a good idea.  But I don\'t like the idea 
of it having such a large effect - it just doesn\'t feel like 
Traveller to me.  

(All that aside, I think I should point out that I\'m a big fan of
Chaosium\'s system from RQ and Stormbringer (et al), where stats add
a smallish modifier to the skill.  Not that it\'s particularly
important, but I thought I\'d expose some of my biases, while I\'m 
here.  Not suprisingly, I never really went for GURPS)

IMPORTANCE: 3(ish)

As other people have said, this is really just one issue.  I have to 
say that I have found the original T4 SS/SF system to work OK.  It 
was one of the (few?) aspects of the T4 task system that didn\'t seem 
to be broken, so I see no real reason to fix it.

> 5. I don\'t like the half-die. Get rid of it.
> =============================================================

IMPORTANCE: 0

I\'m easy.  My players found the whole \'different number of dice for 
different difficulties\' idea quite exotic, and just accepted the D3 
as part of it (after an explanation of how to use it).  We use 4 
dice of the same colour and one different, which is used as a D3 if 
rolling a Difficult task or a D6 if rolling an Impossible task.

Linking this section with the next, it appears to me that there is 
another question lurking in the background here.  Several of the 
esteemed members of the list have posted variations on the MT task 
system, and they and others have called for a move back to the old 
2D6 way of life.  The question here seems to be:

"Why don\'t we just go back to the MegaTraveller system - we know it 
works, it\'s had years of playtesting by thousands of people.  Why do 
we need all these dice?"

Tough one.  As I\'ve said, I\'m a CT player at heart, so 2D6 certainly 
appeals to me.  But I think the idea behind the T4 task system was to 
present T4 as a *new game*, not just another printing of Traveller.  
And I\'ve found that the multi-dice thing has grown on me, and it very 
much differentiates between T4 and CT/MT.  When I got MT, I ended up 
just pulling out the bits that looked OK and incorporating them in a 
half-arsed fashion into my CT game.  That hasn\'t happened with T4, 
I\'m not sure why.  Perhaps it\'s because I took a long break during 
TNE?  No, actually that\'s wrong - I took FF&S and WTH and 
incorporated them in a half-arsed fashion into my CT game, just like 
MT.

Well, I dunno.  Let\'s skip on to the next section of voting, before I 
write anything else.

John Snead asked for our votes on:

Your Rating of This System (1 = Best to 3 = Worst)

RATING: 3

Sorry.  I know it\'s 2D6, I know it\'s Traveller, I know.  But I never 
got into it with MT in the first place.  I always used 2D6, add skill 
and any other modifiers I felt like, 8+ is a success.  All these 
different targets left me cold.  Almost ironic really, considering 
I\'m a fan of the multi-dice T4-style system now.  Oh well.

RATING: 1

Not that I think it\'s perfect, but it works the best for me out of 
the options so far.  The only real drawbacks are the stat division 
and the slightly out of place D3 for difficult tasks.

>

Your Rating of This System (1 = Best to 3 = Worst)

RATING: 2

This fixes the problems with KBv1.1 very successfully, but introduces 
one that has kept me away so far - 5 dice is a lot to roll, but 
KBv1.1 only calls for that many for impossible tasks.  7 dice is 
*way* too many for my tastes.


SUMMARY:

I don\'t think that it is possible to make a system that uses the T4 
multi-dice approach, has skills that outway stats, and has no D3\'s 
without having lots of dice.  Not without changing the ranges of the 
stats and the skills in a major way, which would blow compatibilty 
with anything previously published totally out of the window.  So 
some compromises are needed.

Of the various features of the T4/KB systems, these are my thoughts:

Stat division: I can live with it, I guess, *if the character sheets 
and rules are set up to make it easy*.  After all, MT used it 
successfully (or did you all just fudge it a bit - be honest, I\'m 
curious).

D3\'s: Well, I kind of like them, now that you mention it.  They\'re a 
little out of place being only used for difficult tasks, but they add 
a certain \'je ne sais quoi\' to the game that sticks in people\'s 
minds.  Perhaps they should be propagated throughout the system?  
(Where did I leave my asbestos underwear?).

Multi-dice: Well, it\'s OK actually.  I don\'t mind having to roll 4 or 
5 dice (although 4 is better than 5).  6 or 7 is right out though, 
sorry Kenneth.

Right, I think that\'s me out of things to say and time to say them.  
Sorry I haven\'t come to any real conclusions, and thank you for 
listening to me ramble on for so long.  Now you know why I lurk, 
rather than participating. *shrug*

Going back to hide under my rock now.

Here\'s one that\'s a bit more complex, but gives a *flatter* distribution:

roll dice 3 times:
1st 	(1d6-1) * 61	(0,61,122,183,244,305)
2nd	(1d6-1) * 10	(0,10,20,30,40,50)
3rd	2d6-1		(1-11) 

Add the results of the 3 rolls. If the total is 366 and it isn\'t a leap
year, change it to 365.

Simple, more even, fewer dice, and no re-rolls. It\'s also
"progressive". The first roll determines what part of the year, the
second determines where in that part, and the final roll gets the exact
day.

If you want a vote on the task system issue, as much as I like KBv2.0,
I\'ll happily accept Marc\'s system and here\'s why:

The group I game with mostly does AD&D, so we have lots of character
generation each session:-) In this environment stats of 7-14 (on 3d6)
offer almost no benefit, so our stats dice rolls are modified to allow
player to get stats that give bonuses in what their character does
(ie high strength fighters, high dex thieves, etc).

I don\'t see any difference with Traveller.

If you want to be a research scientist, then the character generation
system forces you to have an education of B+, and this follows life -
the people who do research all seem to have pretty high EDU scores,
the skill just determines what they are good at.

Similarly, the armed forces want a decent physical specimen, even with
conscription - more so when you select less than a million marines from
over a billion people. So again I would expect the physical stats to be
in the range A+.

This means that when the characters met an NPC, that NPC would have a
stat (which AD&D calls a prime requisite) of about 9, A or B to support
their usual skill and 6, 7 or 8 in other areas (unless specially created)

This means that the target number for the professionals would vary 1 or 2
points due to stat and 2 or 3 points due to skill.
But experts would be stat B, skill 5 and amateurs stat 7 skill 1 and the
no contest result you expect would happen.

This would probably mean that I need to use more dice or more modifiers
on the task roll but I expected that.

Of course this only describes the average NPC. There are exceptions to any
system - in the case of roleplaying games, these are the players and
specifically detailled NPCs might have inappropriate stats and skills.
So what - I always felt that the players should not be your average
9-5 citizen worker. After all they do have a direct line to "god" and in
my case sit between me and the door of the house where we game:-)

I bet this has been said by someone else on the list but I can\'t read all
the messages whilst at work.

Priority One.  Skills and Stats should be equalized.  Dividing the stat by a 
nuber and adding it to the DM\'s seems to be the route most variants have 
taken.  Personaly, being a crazy ol\' codger (Travametricly Speaking, been 
playing for Nearly 15 or so years<G>). I am very partial to the MT way. 
(2d6+Stat/5+Skill over fixed number)

> 5. I don\'t like the half-die.  Get rid of it.

Priority Two.  I had very little prob with 1/2 dice in T4.0(until the skill 
over stat issue arose in gameplay) where there was more instance, but now 
T4.1 where it is only used in \'Difficult\'(2.5d) make it seem pointless. 
 Personaly I would like to see a return to 2d6, those multi dice are too 
much like SW.

I give these guy\'s equal priority. Zero.
I always believed that SS and SF were due to just plain dumb luck, again I 
will cite the 2d example, no matter how shoddy you are at a skill if you 
roll boxcars(12) you will luck out and pull through spectaculary.  Likewise, 
if it seems like there is no way you can fail with your +8 or so  DM\'s on 
that easy task, if you roll Snakeeyes(2) you fumble.  SS and SF are great 
role playing events.

Example: Joe Shigulii, is the best pilot in the Imperial Navy.  Dex=12(+2DM) 
and Pilot=6.  He wants to show off his skill to some babes.  He does some 
fancy flying at the formidiable level and succedes no sweat.  Now he comes 
in for a perfect military spit and polish landing.  Should be no prob, thats 
an average task, should be automatic, but he rolls a 2!  The silly pilot was 
so engrosed with impressing the gals that he forgot to engage the landing 
gear and grinds his fighter\'s ventral turret up on the tarmac!

"Doh! The Admiral\'s not gonna like this!"

Well thats my 0.02cr worth :)

who\'s opinion I trust have confirmed the deal as appearing to be on the

So if you want to encourage victi^H^H^H^H^Hplayers to join your

Who knows, the number of requests for different games might be used by
Shadis to influence the mix of articles in future issues.

Well, I can\'t speak for the others, but I\'m not involved in a game at the
moment, and have not yet bought in to T4.  So, being stuck in the MT mode,
I haven\'t got a real desire to join in T4 or M:0 discussions.  Much of the

Well, in MegaTraveller we had attributes (possibly reduced by wounds) being

Hmmm...this is exactly the place where all the people who think that the
task system is broken point to, Marc.

There is no way on the Emperors green Sylea that someone with skill-9 in
something should be merely equal to someone with skill-1, I don\'t care
WHAT their aptitude is! Gaining skills is not just book learning and
taking tests, particularly for something as demanding as demolitions.
Getting that skill-9 involves three things: Practice, practice, practice.
Ok, maybe four things, we\'ll toss in a little practice. Three may be
really bad at basketball, can\'t juggle one ball at a time, and drop his
food in his lap all the time, but in the real world he\'s going to
outperform Eleven almost every time at demolitions related tasks, if not
every time.

To take up our tired Mikey example from the great task wars debate,
Michael Jordan CLEARLY has the aptitude to play basketball, he\'s one of
the best in the world at it, maybe one of the best of all time. But,
according to your example, when Mike was in high school, at about skill 1,
he\'d be able to beat the majority of NBA players and almost all NCAA
players, because of his attributes. No way...Age and Skill will beat Youth
and Talent any time.

The problem with the T4 task systems, based as heavily as it is on the
underlying attribute is that it makes the assumption that the attribute is
unchanging. It isn\'t. Any dexterity related skill is going to be improved
by the muscle training that comes with gaining the skill...it\'s like
learning tennis, or golf, or flytying...you can read all about it, know
all about it intellectually, but if you\'re not _doing_ it, you\'re not
gaining the skill, and that\'s what the difference in skill levels are
supposed to represent: practice more than knowledge.

This is also where the old thing about gaining skills after chargen broke
down in that you had to find time to get a teacher, materials and time to
devote to practice, when the skills people were trrying to improve were
usually the skills their characters were using in their day to day gaming
lives.

You are 66% clueful. :)  \'P\' is the \'Population multiplier\' -- you
multiply it by the exponential UPP pop code value to get a more precise
population figure.  For example, UPP pop code 7, PBG value 412, would mean
there are 4 x 10^7 = 40 million ihabitants.

I think this is a pretty accurate assessment of most

I really have to commend Marc for taking our input and not

Which as it turned out was *too* vague a question!  My apologies,
especially to those for whom English is a second language.

My intent was to find out what software would be useful to users of PE,
without specifying whether this should be a game, book-keeping utility,
or whatever.

I don\'t have access to a Mac, but anything I write might still be useful
if I keep the user interface well-separated from the mechanics, so a Mac
C++ programmer could write their own UI without having to do so much
work.

One quick response, to this from Rob Prior:
>1) Generate the setting for a pocket empire (WBN)
No problem.

>2) Import existing settings, using HIWG-standard text files (ESS)
I was planning on that for my world-building program (now abandoned
because of Dulinor).

>3) Create the background data for me to run the empire campaign (ESS)
What do you mean by this?  Do you mean things like cultural details for
worlds?  I presume you don\'t mean a history of the region!

>4) Manage all the number-crunching when my players run a PE campaign
(ESS)
Yup.

>5) Let me play a PE campaign solo (WBN)
One of my aims, since solo play is all the Traveller I get.

I\'m getting married tomorrow, so may not have much time to post about
this. ;-)  I\'ll let the feedback accumulate and have a look at it on
Tuesday.  Have a good weekend, everyone!

In response to your questionaire, here\'s my opinion:

I rate this 1, this is the main reason I don\'t use the T4 task system

SS should be easier for easier tasks and slowly getting harder and harder
as difficulty increases.
SF should be difficult to get at easy levels but easier the hrader the task.

> 5. I don\'t like the half-die. Get rid of it.

I don\'t particularly like the half die, i\'d like to go back to a 2D6 system
but 
any system without half dice would be better. But you can improvise a half
die 
with a D6 and some sticky labels with numbers and once you get used to it it\'s
better than systems that use nearly every type of dice you can possibly buy.
I\'d rate this as 5.


Now a reply to Bruce Johnson\'s question:

The reason I don\'t send posts as often as I\'d like to is I just don\'t have
the 
time. I\'d like to be more active on the list, but by the time I\'ve waded
through
all the digests any comments I have have already been made by someone else.

The reason I spoke up about the task system was because I felt so strongly
that
it should be changed (as do a lot of others it seems).


While I\'m here a quick rules question:

In the Megatraveller trading system, in the freight and cargo section it
gives a
table for determining the number of major, minor and incidental lots available
do I use this table for freight and then again for cargo or role once for lots
and randomly determine if a lot is freight or cargo (ie. a 50:50 chance).
Or what?


Oh yeah John Wood:
I use a PC running Windows 95 (only because I have to for my work).
Just in case your still counting :)

Yes, I live in the states. Orlando, Florida to be precise.  The FLGS there 
is a huge monopolistic store called Enterprise 1701 (they have basicaly shut 
all the smaller FLGS\'s down, and been around for almost 20 years IIRC.)  I 
believe they do some international ordering.  They have a website with lotsa 
information.

www.enterprise1701.com

The price I am not sure of, probably pretty cheap.  This was in the 
used/bargan/want-to sell-this-thing-bad section of the store :-)

Not important at all.

6. Stop rolling so many dice.  Use 2d6, 2d10, or 1d100 instead.

I understand what you\'ve said, and it makes sense -- for one or two
examples.  But here\'s the problem with this system:  there are only 6
characteristics.  So someone can hit grad school, crank up the EDU, and
suddenly he\'s Too Good at Too Many skills.  

Now maybe if you had 12 or 15 characteristics and you evenly distributed
the skills out over all of them, that problem would go away.  But I\'m not
sure folks want that many characteristics (though I\'ve seen other systems
with them).  So the next best solution is to decrease the value of
characteristic compared to the skill.  That\'s what folks (myself included)
would like to see.

Make sense?

Hmmm. I belive that to be clear but that was my intent, I am only counting
those that want/desire changes to the Task system great or small. This will
be the easy vote, the next one will get very "murky" on the many
issues/problems that each of us percieves to be inherent in each task
system proposed.

Be warned - Web-gathered statistics are often dangerous.  I, for example,
visit with a Win browser from work, but use Unix and Mac stuff at home,
where I do not browse the Web often.  (This is changing - my connection
from home is a 200K cable modem, and work is a 64K ISDN connection.)
Spending 5 minutes browsing the web is one thing, but actually putting
software on the work machines is beyond the pale.

I have always been fond of Unix-y software, even if I do not use it as my
machine of choice, as it is usually in source, and I can get both Mac and
Unix versions fairly easily.

YMMV.

Yes, I agree. I think a dice mechanic needs to be decided, and a
suitable skill range agreed upon. As I said, my example assumed skills
range from 1 to 6.

Off the top of my head, one could use the *Skill Points* as the target
number (ie. don\'t divide by three), using a difficulty progression like
2d6-3d6-4d6-5d6-6d6. I haven\'t done the statistical analysis, but it
might work.

Better to die a heretic then a fanatic, eh Eris? :-)

PS. FUDGE dice are d6\'s! Just really strange looking d6\'s... ;-> Also,
there are alternate die rolling methods using d6\'s. My personal
favourite is rolling 4d6, 2 of one colour and 2 of another (ie.
red=negative, green=positive) Discard all but the lowest die/dice. If
the dice are red, use the result as a negative result, if the dice are
green, it\'s positive. If you get mixed colour dice as the lowest, the
result is 0. It\'s fast, and no addition is required.

Examples: R5 G3 G2 R2 = 0   Fair result
          R6 G3 G2 R1 = -1  Mediocre 
          G5 R4 G4 R2 = -2  Poor
          R4 R3 G2 G2 = +2  Excellent
          G6 R3 G3 R3 = 0   Fair

Or just us a CLI if need be.  I usually do for simple stuff until I get
around to wrapping an interface around it.  It is usually pretty easy to
add some kind of interface, as long as the underlying stuff is fairly well
thought out.

I do so wish the Dulinor people would either let me play with the source,
or would release a Mac/Unix version.  It sounds quite slick, but I cannot
use it on the machines that I fell comfortable doing so.

I do not dispute their decision to do it where they have, BTW, I just want
to make use of it. :)

I liked the above write up a great deal. I hope it makes it into the new
book!  I especially liked that you compared Three with a skill of one to
Eleven with a skill of one.

I am aware, BTW, that it supports the opposite position than the one I
voted in favor of, but clearly you can fiddle with the exact numbers
without changing the expository text, and frankly, the expository text is
far more important, IMHO, than the details.  Details can be changed, but
feel is difficult to do.  I might argue the results of that comparison of
Three and Eleven, both after a year course, but having it there puts the
issue in the open, where a DM can fiddle.

The above adds to the feel of the task system.  Toss in a few more examples
of the kinds of things that are difficult, easy, average, etc.  Perhaps a
half dozen to a dozen of each, and people will be set to fiddle as they see
fit.  (I know there are many examples in the rules already, but more would
help the beleaguered game master.)

We can then debate the TS mechanics virtually forever, but at least then,
everyone has a pretty good idea of the expected results.

Could you point me to some of the references, please?  I own a significant
fraction of the old CT and MT material, but I do not own all of it.  If
some of these references were in products I did not own, then I well might
have missed them.

Note that Darrians, etc., are a slightly different case, as while they are
perfectly valid sources for goodies, they are a separate political entity.
They are my current mystery men, in fact.  In the M0 area, they are the
boogeymen, as nobody quite knows what they are up to or where they are, and
it is a multiyear trip to get there, so any rumors have a great chance to
expand out of all bounds of rationality.

(I am especially looking for evidence that the RoM made it above TL12,
since that would put it above Sylea, and thus make relic hunting adventures
a valid type of adventure for M0 Syleans.)

All you have to do is ask, or find a topic that we feel important. But
remember, Lurkers always listen, and never forget. So be careful about

Personally, I would argue that the RoM (or at least the Old Earth Union)
reached TL13 (maybe 14) in a limited nature, and the Imperium waited until
588 to annexe it because it was worried about the TL advantage. The state
and nature of the Solomani region, and the wars with the Aslan stopped
Terran domination of the pre-Imperium period. Not to mention a degree of
reticence in meeting those retrograde, backward, conservative Vilani. IMO,
of course.

However, I too own most Traveller stuff published by GDW, DGP and IG, and
can\'t recall any references to RoM tech being in excess of TL12 *except
for* IG publications. I am not denying that you may be right about the
numerous references, but can you cite some of them to stop me thinking I\'m
going mad...

I\'ve got most everything too, and I\'ve not noticed such references.  Could
you provide page numbers, and perhaps a few quotes.  Doing so would go a
long way to settling this debate.

I have the sector information for Spinward Marches (circa 1107) 
in an Access database. I may even have it in an Excel spreadsheet 
too. It\'s only the main world UWP\'s, not the extended system 
information.

Is this what you\'re looking for?

   I was watching this process with some amazement.  I have not gotten up
to speed even on what Marc had posted with all of this bandwidth about the
voting.  I would not be surprised to find that I am not alone in this
problem either.

   I was undecided until I passed along the digests to a friend offline
who has more time to read than I do.  He convinced me to go with the T4
task system as is.  He pointed out that people here have suggested that
this is _simply_ a Stats-v-Skills issue, but that the complainer\'s are
not considering the fact that the T4 system tends to still be stats
oriented in the fact that age is a factor in getting the skills, and as
a result, the skills do come to dominate where appropriate, and the
stats help the younger less-skilled characters.  I like this.

   A problem with voting this way (via TML) is that the number of
responses causes a lot of things to be missed and people may be
discouraged from voting.  Also, why should someone who wants the T4
system the way Marc is doing it vote "to keep what they already have."

  For a vote to mean anything here, the opposing side needs to have
as much encouragement under the knowledge that unless they vote, the
old way will be taken away from them.  I don\'t consider your 50 votes
to be agreement on anything, and I doubt Marc will either, but I
would rather not speak for him.

  Anyway, you can put an off-line lurker (J.P.) and me (Leroy Guatney)
down for T4 the way it is from Marc.  I would guess, given that I have
not seen an announcement out there that you have convinced Marc, that
for each of us pro-T4 supporters, there are 10 or 20 or 100 more lurking
knowing (hoping) that T4 comes from Marc as outlined, with input from
TML, but being happy that the system is the basic way it is.

For myself and J.P.,

I obviously think 2,3 and 4 are intertwined.  They are equally important if
the task system is going to function properly.  I would edit 4 to with "It

replacing half-die, but it isn\'t critical.

Marc, 

I was thinking about the way you want to handle education last night, and
it reinforces my thinking that Stats are going to play too strong a role in
Target Numbers.

Jo graduates from to Grad School with honors and now has a guaranteed EDU
of 12.  For whatever reason her skills earned in school were concentrated
in Performance and the Social Sciences (Major:  Fine Art, Minor:  Liberal
Arts).  Jo makes a major life change and enlists in the Merchants and in
her next term learns Mechanics, Astrogation, Demolitions (Marc\'s example),
and Broker and *starts* with a 13 ON ALL FOUR!  As a comparison, her
crewmate Bob (Edu 8..college graduate) has been working his butt off for 4
years after graduating to learn Demolitions, and he\'s only gotten up to 12! 
Jo, after one "year" of study is better than Bob after 4 "years."  Why? 
Because she graduated with honors with a degree in Fine Arts?  <g> I
wouldn\'t buy this even if her degree was in Engineering..a choice that
should be included, btw.

Should Jo\'s high education play a role in her learning new skills quickly? 
IMO, yes, it should, but not a 4 level advantage, and not in *every* EDU
based skill!

Should a PhD, with honors, allow Jo to learn in one year what it took a
college graduate five years to learn?  IMO, only in the field in which she
got the PhD, otherwise *no*, it should not!

Should it allow Jo to become an instant expert in dozens of fields? IMO,
no, it should not!

Finally, should every PC that graduates from grad school with honors end up
with EDU-12?  No! No! NO!  

Marc, the other Stats have similar problems, but EDU is the one that
bothers me most, because it\'s the one that potentially increases most
during CharGen, and it\'s the one that unbalances the game the most.  

I see the Stats as fundamental characteristics of the character that form
the *base* for skills.  They shouldn\'t change as easily (if at all), and
certainly not by as much as skills.  They should measure innate attributes
of the character not fixed amounts of something...like years of schooling. 
To me, EDU does not measure EDUcation, it measures EDUcationability.

Having a high EDU should make it easier to successfully enroll in and
complete college and graduate school.  I can even see where successfully
completing a 4 year program *might* increase an EDUcationability stat by
+1, but I might reserve that as the benefit for the honors graduate.  I
*can\'t* see it conferring a magic "instant expert" status on every
graduate.

And IMO, that\'s what pushing EDU up so very high and having it count so
much more than the Skill gains does.

ROFL!  I\'m surprised my mail client didn\'t crash on finding \'Kenneth\' and

everyone agrees that both apptitude and training are important; no-one (or
almost no-one) wants to have a system that ignores attributes completely.
What most of us disagree about is how much weight to give to each. In current T4, being one of the
top 10% in natural ability (attribute B+) with minimal training (skill 1) 
makes you *better* than an average human (attribute 7) with many years of
intensive training (skill 4.) 

I\'m a bright chap (probably INT A-C, EDU D) with a little computer programming
experience (Computer-1.) I don\'t think I\'m better at doing computer tasks
than an average human with even a BSc in computing, though; I couldn\'t debug
C++ without significantly more pracitce - I don\'t even *know* C++.

It\'s bad purely from a gaming standpoint, too, because all good characters end
up looking alike; instead of being a good pilot or a good marksman or 
a good surgeon, your character is either high DEX - and therefore good at
all three - or low DEX and not very good at any of them. Very bland.

  time to pitch my pennies...

  (1)  I like the idea of a task system.  If nothing else, it
  provides a tool for me, as a referee, to avoid those irksome
  "fiat" decisions that my players growl about.  I think it does
  more, however, in providing guidelines for those people who
  are "working outside their experience" to have some way of
  comparing at least the relative difficulties of two tasks.

  (2)  The present task system is clearly counter-intuitive.  It
  gives too much weight to the characteristic, which I read as
  indicating the "natural ability" of a character to master
  related skills.  That may sound like support for the present
  task system; it\'s not - while natural ability will almost
  certainly affect how easily I _acquire_ or _increase_ a skill
  (up to a point), the skill level itself is more important in
  completing a task.  As an example, I have a naturally high
  INT, EDU, and DEX; my father\'s INT and EDU are comparable to
  mine, but he\'s a klutz.  I have auto-repair 1; I can spot when
  a gasket is leaking, I can put fluids into the car, and I can
  unstick some of the mechanical linkages that are easily
  visible and accessible.  My father has auto-repair 3 (or
  better); he can also change filters, replace belts, and do
  just about anything that doesn\'t require removing the engine
  from the car or using tools beyond wrenches and screwdrivers.
  He\'ll drop tools and parts, and spend twice the time working
  that I would (for a comparable job that we can both do), but
  he can succeed at more jobs than I can.  His superior skill is
  more important to the job than my superior DEX.  That\'s how
  real life works; so too should the Traveller task system.

  (3) I strongly urge you to consider a task system that
  increases the weight of skills relative to characteristics; to
  do otherwise will result in the perception of yet another
  "broken" incarnation of Traveller.  I have used KBv2.0 in some
  adventures; I have had no complaints about the results
  generated.  Ken has thought out his task system well; if there
  is something undesirable about it that would prevent you from
  adopting it, I would recommend that you at least strongly
  consider it and its goals as a starting point for a system
  that you feel more comfortable with.

Um no.  You system was endorsed by 3:1 _by_those_who_want
skills_emphasized_more_.  (Hardly surpising since that is
the primary point of the system).  You cut out 1/2 of your
posts from your count because they didn\'t advocate count
skills more and many of them (like me) are people who
don\'t have a problem with stats vs skills but do prefer
MT for reason like "don\'t like variable dice".

The problem I have is that when this preference (and it is a perfernce)
get\'s elevated to the point where a system that doesn\'t follow it is
called "broken".  The history of demphasizing stats has biased the
views here toward skill, but in gaming in general there is not clear
that the opinion that stats should count for more is even in the
majority.

And a lot of people would say that someone who is that stupid, clutzy
will never even go into the field and if they do, they will never
amount to anything.

If you take someone who can\'t even eat a meal without knocking
a glass over, he is _never_ going to be able to safely get into
demolisions and will alway be a danger, no matter how much he
pratices. (Every field for which safety is an issue has stories
about guys that have been there for _years_ and have always been
a hazard to those around them.)  Conversely, the oldtime of
mediocre ability resenting the young talent that is displacing
him is a staple of literature because it reflects reality.

Um no.  Because all those playes all have high stats too.  The ones
with 3\'s all never played basketball except when they had to in gym
(and then Michael Jordan _could_ run rings around them even before
he was trained...)

Just a few more thoughts on what I think would help any task system finally
adopted:

1. Can the basis behind the whole system be explained in one paragraph,
better still one sentence. 

This may seem a little spurious, but is the essence of good design. If the
system cannot be explained and understood easily , it will probably lead to
problems later.

2. Can the *whole* system exist on a one page reference sheet or better still,
the back of a postcard. Lookup tables should be restricted to one and at
most two.

I tend to go with the ditch the rulebook - play from reference sheet
approach in my games. Lookup tables can be a pain as they slow gameflow.
Whatever you do make it memorable! The half dice - love it or hate it - you
didn\'t forget it.

3. The target number should be calculated and declared *before* the player
rolls the dice.

This is a major aid to game flow. There is nothing worse than fiddling
around after a roll with + and - DM\'s while the player waits for the the
result. 

Interestingly enough getting below a number works well, although it can seem
counter intuitive at first, in that you *count until you bust* - I find the
too many dice arguement a bit spurious in this regard  - I find in actual
sustained play you pick out rolls high to low in turn and check for busting.
My players have adapted to this quickly and developed a \'feel\' for the roll
they have just made. Counting three or four dice is no major hassle On the
*very* odd occasion an impossible task comes up - more dice adds to the tension.

I leave judgements on how the current systems on offer do under these criteria
to your discretion. I would just like to add that I think the T4 task system 
was a *flawed* masterpiece. Its just so close to being my perfect system....

The origin I heard goes back to an AD&D touney at an early GenCon, where
the PCs were dropped in Oz.  Turned into the predictible blood bath, with
mounds of dead munchkins all over the place.  The term grew out of that.

Note that the above is rumor and lore only, and I don\'t have any evidence
for or against it.

Leroy, 

I believe that you must have missed to initial letter, Marc Miller stated
that he did not feel that anyone else wanted the Task System changed, and
that if out the 300+ members of the TML, if 50 people would say that they
wanted the task system changed., hi might reconsider it. So actually Marc
was only interested in the number of people that wanted change(s). I set
that up so we could see how were for change or against. 

If in you opinion the against did not vote, it matters little to the
original statement by Marc. 

I see no problem with the voting to turn out, so far it has been remarkable
all sort and kinds of Lurkers have been deLurking. I not seen some of the
Lurkers ever post anything ever since I have been here, as for the silent
majority being silent, it looks like a large chunk have become unsilent.

See the above comments it was not a vote us versus them just how many want
change(s).

I have added you name to the against area, but I can not add J.P. in would
not be a good idea to vote off-line friends it could easily run into many
problems/issues. As it stands now one vote one email address taken from
email headers.

The vote is not about pro T4 vs Anti T4 just how many want change(s) in the
task system. I am the one that set the quorum format, not Marc. I only did
it to see how many were against and would vote so.

Now that the votes supporting change(s) has met Marc\'s minimum, the hard
part will deciding what change(s) will/can be implemented. Even if Marc
does not choose to implement any of the task suggestions, I will be able to
fine tune the task system I am using form all of the dialog.

I would like it to import/read Excel or Database files containing sector
information. Then to take all of the die rolling out of the loop for me.
That way I can just apply the results.

the past year that I might go for, is that the system stays as is for
physical based skills, but that in the case of mental based skills, stats

Can I ask an impertinent question?  

Why? <g>

Why, do you need a formula or even a table to come up with a birthday? If
it\'s manual, just say.."Pick a number between 1 and 366 for your PC\'s date
of birth.", and if it\'s computerized, like a spreadsheet or program, just
have the computer pick a pseudo-random number from 1 to 366.

David, it may be a preference, but it is one that many of us share. You
don\'t, but then what you prefer is just a preference as well.  I think all
of us would like our preferences to be reflected in T4.1, many of us will
be disappointed. Frankly, I *know* Marc isn\'t going to give me the exact
system I want, but that doesn\'t mean I shouldn\'t tell him what I like and
don\'t like. And it doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t either.  

>The history of demphasizing stats has biased the views here toward skill, 

Perhaps, but that is the long experience we have had with Traveller
showing. Traveller started with almost complete emphasis on skills in CT,
then allowed 1/5 of the stat into the task with MT, and only started to be
"stat heavy" with TNE and T4.

Could you reword that for me, please?  I\'m not sure what you mean.

I get extremely annoyed when a game company decides to upgrade a system to
make it more "user friendly". I agree that it has its benefits, but from
the discussion that I have only glanced over because I do not play T4 (I
play TNE) I have noticed that there is a great disatisfaction with the
rules.

If a new version is released then make sure that this new version is
acceptable. When T$R rereleased AD&D 2nd edition in a new set of rule
books I was extremely annoyed because it meant that I was going to have to
fork out heaps of more money just to keep up with the products coming out
and the $100 odd that I spent on the previous books went to waste.

I do understand that extenuating situations mean that rules do have to be
revised and re-released. The dissatisfaction with the T4 task system seems
to be one of those situations. If the task system is fixed then PLEASE
make sure that you do not need to change the rules systems again. It is
just a waste of time and money on both the consumer and the producer.

May the grace and peace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all

Bruce just rolled a Spectacular Success here.  This is the *real* reason to
weigh skills more than stats.  With only six stats dominating the game, we
divide all characters into six classes (Str based, Dex bases, etc).  A char
with high dex and low str will never attempt to learn certain skills, but
his player will become the a good marksman, forger, pilot etc based on a
large stat and minimal skill level.  

Skills are one of the largest factor differentiating characters in
Traveller.  To allow stats to complete dominate turns the game into D&D in
space, with STR-class chars instead of fighters, INT-class chars instead of
mages, etc.

Skills are what makes a character different.

   I\'m with Ken --

    The T4 task system is horribly broken, and needs to be badly
overhauled.

    Several points need to be considered.

1) Ease of use - the task system needs to be simple enough to keep the
action moving. This may mean sticking to good ol\' d6s. (Traditionalists
will demand this)

2) Adequate realism - suspension of disbelief needs some support; IMO
provision for "automatic" tasks, as well as luck being a factor with
unskilled characters (few "impossible" tasks), is *absolutely* necessary.

3) I like the idea of a generic task system that only happens to be
used for combat, with a minimum of specialized rules. *Realistic*
auto-fire and area fire *must* be implemented, even if only as an optional
rule. Give automatic weapons and shotguns more to do than just shred
individual targets...

4) In combat, factors such as shock and individual mindset/experience
mean more than physical damage -- rethink the damage system to take this
into account. New secondary attributes or "skills" such as cool (Tw2000)
or morale may be necessary.

Simon, what you say above is so very, very important, that I couldn\'t let 
it go by without responding.  The task system should be an elegant design 
- - simple yet robust.  I don\'t give a hang which system is used, so long 
as it works and is simple.

When programming anything non-trivial, there will always be a few hot 
spots where the program is spending most of its time.  Good programmers 
optimize those hot-spots more than anything else, because if you shave 
even a microsecond off of each iteration, you\'ll end up saving people a 
lot of time, as the program iterates on that spot so frequently.

In gaming, task systems are the hot spots.  That\'s the part of the mechanics 
that we spend the most of our time on.  It just makes good sense to keep 
it simple.

The CT non-system was a nightmare.  The only reason I like it is because 
I\'m used to it - it\'s comfortable.  It\'s my favorite pair of old, 
beat-up sneakers. :)  But I wouldn\'t want to inflict it on any new 
customers.

The original DGP task system was pretty close to ideal, except that the 
progression of target numbers wasn\'t as easy to remember as it could have 
been.  Then they added several pages of exceptions to the rules, and 
thereby made it more difficult to use.  It was robust, and simpler than 
CT\'s sytem, but not even close to being simple enough.

T4\'s task system fit the bill in terms of simplicity, but missed the mark 
in terms of robustness.  It\'s pretty hard to fail at tasks under T4\'s 
system, so it misses the point of having a task system.  There are dodges 
around that, including Ken Bearden\'s systems, breaking down tasks into 
mini-tasks and requiring a roll for each, and over-using the Multiple 
Actions Rule, but each of those tosses simplicity in favor of 
robustness.  Again, it misses the mark.

T4.1\'s task system is a bit less simple than the one in T4 (it\'s 
progression is no longer smooth), but it does a better job of handling 
the probabilities.  It\'s also a heck of a lot better stated than it was 
in the T4 rulebook.  It is a better compromise, IMO, than the various 
fixes to T4\'s sytem outlined above, but it still misses the mark.  It\'s 
not simple enough, and it\'s not robust enough to be perfect.

Given the choice of any of the above, I\'d pick the system Marc has 
developed for T4.1.  

Given absolute power over all things Traveller, though, I\'d search for
something even better.  But the down side to that is making the Game
Screen, Pocket Empires, and Psionic Institutes confusing as heck to those
who purchase T4.1. 

I don\'t see a good way out at this point.

Marc did not understand where the issues were coming from, however, as the
first question was if STATS should be weighed heavier in the task system,
which "currently" was too skill-influenced...

to "T4 is good as it is".


If it was, would we have gone to all this trouble?

The PBEM I am involved with has three specifics. A normal, out of combat
turn comes around twice a week and the players decide what they are going
to do in a space of time that the GM specifies. If we are travelling cross
country and our destination is a month away, then the players will write
down what they propose to do while they are travelling. If we are in a
city then it is usually the players decision. Turns can go on a day by day
basis or for a week at a time, especially if the players are training.

The second thing is talking. Basically during a turn characters converse
with each other. When a turn goes around, the threads end and begin anew.
In the game that I am involved in there is ALOT of conversation. My DM has
a strict code of how the subjects are to be sent so that he can catagorise
them and put them into a journal.

Combat turns go about once a day. All conversation stops and everybody
submits a daily turn. The GM rolls all of the dice; the players, in their
turn submission, tell the GM what to roll.

I hope this is of some help for you.

Actually I have no problems with Terran Confederacy having very warped Tech
levels. 

Why?

IMHO Tech levels are a Vilani tool to project ist supiority over every one
else. Given the overwealming power of the beauro\'s , the Tech level would
have been used for licencing , taxation purposes.  

eg "You want to import a Tech 10 power plant?, well since you only have a
tech level 8 base, we are going to have to inspect your new power plant
regulary, you will need to get an approval from your local governer, as
well as paying a licencing fee"

The TC however, is a technological free wheeler that was unhampered by such
thing as conservative thinking (as well as being on a war footing, look at
the tech explosion during WWI and WWII for an example of what can happen
during war). SO (again IMHO) the TC would be a hodpodge of highly
experimental technolagy and tried and tested technolagy.

An example (Thanks to discussions will Phill MacGregor), The Vilani would
build a spaceship on economic lines, designed to last for centuries to
amortise the cost, with a conservite mix of weapons and defensive features).

The Terran Confederacy would slap together a hull that woukld fall in part
in 10 years (if it survives as ling) with a nifty new power plant (that
takes up more space than normal and break down easier), some solid and
reliable weapons and defensive systems, and may be a new super dooper
experimental weapon.

The TC technolagy would be all over the place compared to Villani. Its
material sceince would proberbly be cutting edge (TL13), it medical and
computer tech vastly supior (TL13-14), its power generation slightly lower
(TL-11). 

The Rule of Man however would have slammed this back to a grinding holt.
The Terran Occupation would have a nightmare of logistics supply, so by
default they would have to fall back onto Villani tech (since it is very
widespread and have the support base to maintain it).The TC tecgh would be
more prevelant towards Terra , but in the majority of the RoM, Villani tech
would be the determining factor.

additional 4 pages in the Ref\'s Manual that detail every part of the task,
including Ex Failure and Ex Success.  I have placed some of this info into
the text below, so comparison with similar parts of T4\'s task system can be
made.  If anyone want the entire system from the Ref\'s manual, ask me for
it, and I\'ll email it to you.

The Universal Task Profile (UTP) provides you with a simple (but still
comprehensive) method of codifying tasks. So how does the UTP system work?
A UTP answers these questions about a task:

	How hard is the task?
	What skills and characteristics are crucial to this task?
	How long does this task typically take?
	Does this task involve any special risks?

The UTP provides a list of answers to these questions. A task uses the
predefined answers in response to questions.
The predefined answers are specified in real-world terms. Even if you don\'t
know the task system, you can quickly understand a task defined by a
Universal Task Profile.


WHAT DOES A UTP LOOK LIKE?

The UTP always follows the same format. For example:

	To locate the source of the strange hum:
	Routine, Recon, Int, 1mim (hazardous, unskilled OK).
	Referee: Any Major or Destroyed mishaps automatically become Minor
mishaps.

The UTP is always separated from the surrounding text by a blank line both
above and below.


HOW HARD IS THE TASK?

When setting the difficulty, select from four difficulty levels:
Simple: 	Success is highly likely. Roll 3 + on 2D to succeed.
Routine:	Success is likely. Roll 7 + on 2D to succeed.
Difficult:		Success is unlikely. Roll 11 + on 2D to succeed.
Formidable: 	Success is rare. Roll 15+ on 20 to succeed; success is only
possible with DMs.
Impossible: 	Success cannot be achieved. Roll 19+ on 20 to succeed; success
is only possible with DMs.  More reasonable, success is possible only if
some situation or information changes the difficulty level from Impossible
to Formidable or less.

Note that the 2D roll for each level is easy to remember because it is 4
more than the prior level. If a 2 is rolled, a fumble occurs and the task
attempt fails no matter what.


WHAT IS CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS?

When crucial skills and characteristics are chosen as task modifiers (DMs),
a task uses related skills (like Pilot and Ship\'s Boat), or one skill and
one characteristic.
A skill level must be added directly as a DM on the task roll.
Characteristics are always divided by 5 (drop fractions) when used in
tasks. Never add characteristics directly.
Exceptional Success:  	If the player\'s task roll exceeds what is needed for
success by 2+ (including DMs), then the character has achieved exceptional
success.
For example, a player is rolling on a difficult task and has a total DM of
+3.  Since the player needs 11+ to succeed on a Difficult task, if he
manages to roll 13 or better (including hid DM of +3, so his actual roll
only needs to be 10 or better), he will have achieved exceptional success. 
Some tasks (such as combat) may state additional benefits for achieving
exceptional success.
Exceptional Failure:	If the player\'s task roll fails, and it is less than
what is needed by 2 or more, then exceptional failure occurred.  Following
the same example above, the player needs 11+ to succeed on the Difficult
task.  If the player fails, and his final roll (including his DM of +3) was
9 or less (an actual roll of 6 or less, since he has a DM of +3), then
exceptional failure has occurred.

HOW LONG DOES THIS TASK TAKE?

The time increment on a task profile is 10 percent of the typical task
duration. A roll of 3 dice (whose average result is 10) determines how many
increments the task takes. The increment is always one-tenth of the typical
task duration.
If the duration of the task doesn\'t matter, the task is Instant and that\'s
that. No time roll is made.
If the duration always takes the same time, the task is Absolute. No time
roll is made.
The duration of an attempt equals the increment times 3D (after any DMs are
applied). The minimum is 3 increments.


DOES THIS TASK INVOLVE ANY SPECIAL RISKS?

The standard task assumes a normal amount of risk. Other levels of risk are
possible:

Safe:		With safe tasks if a mishap occurs, it is never damaging.
Hazardous:	With hazardous tasks, there is a high likelihood of a serious
mishap if the task fails.
Fateful:		With fateful tasks, a mishap is guaranteed if the task fails.
Don\'t confuse this with hazardous, which indicates the severity of mishap.
"To avoid a mishap" situations are good examples of fateful tasks because
if they fail, the mishap has not been avoided.
Uncertain: 	With uncertain tasks, the result of the attempt is largely
opinion or cannot be confirmed. Those individuals associated with the task
have some idea of how successful the task attempt was; however, they are
not certain of the outcome.

Sensor readings, interchanges between characters (including any task which
might require a reaction roll), psionics, computer programming, repairs,
and research are all good candidates for uncertain tasks.
Unskilled OK: When a task states unskilled OK, the specified skills are
useful, but not required. There is no penalty for not having the specified
skills.
Confrontation: When two opposing sides are working at cross-purposes, the
task becomes a confrontation.

HASTY OR CAUTIOUS TASKS
The standard task attempt assumes the character is taking a reasonable
amount of care while performing the indicated task. The player can change
this amount of care.

Hasty:		When a player is in a hurry, he can specify that he would prefer a
hasty task. The time required is shorter, but the task becomes harder. The
task DMs are doubled before subtracting them from the time roll; the task
difficulty increases one level.

Cautious:	When it is more important to reduce danger than to finish
quickly, a player can specify a cautious task.

A determination roll is required first. If successful, the task is
cautious. If unsuccessful, the task is increased in difficulty one level. 
In a cautious task, the time roll is doubled before subtracting DMs; the
task difficulty decreases one level.

TASKS THAT FAIL
The details of handling failed tasks are the realm of the referee and are
covered more fully in this Referee\'s Manual.

Don,

I *think* you\'re reading Marc\'s first question backwards. At least, I hope
you are, because of the way I ranked it. ;->  

All the people giving question 1 a 1 raking, seem to be agreeing that skill
should have a greater influence on the target number. Some of us want skill
to dominate, some of us want skill and stats to be about 50/50, and some of
us just want skill closer to stat than it is now.  And yes, we\'ve heard
from a couple that want things just the way they are now.  We\'ll just have
to see what Marc makes of all this.

Try running a Marine with Dex less than 6 and you have a clumsy Marine.

This is the problem I find with the discussion about dominance of attribu=

over skills. When I look at a characteristic as an "aptitude" or "talent"=

"potential" which can usually only be actualized through skill, then the
higher the characteristic, the higher the potential.

If we have a low Dex football player, he doesn=92t make the cut. On the o=

The value of the Traveller T4 system is that it links skills with more th=

And, skills are a way to counteract natural inabilities in an area... Dex=

and Skill-5 is the same as Dex 5 and Skill-3. But it takes a while to bui=

For a Difficult task, with Characteristic-N and a default Skill (which most
clearly points out the benefit of an unskilled person), the chance of an
unskilled person succeeding is

T41                               Char/2                    Char/3
N=5  1%     Group 1        N=5  1%                 N=5  0%
N=7  4%                         N=7  3%                 N=7  1%
N=9  18%                       N=9  5%                 N=9   4%

The first level of skill Skill-1 provides an increased percentage chance of
success of

N=5  17%    Group 2       N=5  3%                 N=5  1%
N=7  39%                       N=7  5%                 N=7  3%
N=9  62%                       N=9  9%                  N=9  9%

Are you arguing that an unskilled person (who is allowed to use the default
skill with half Characteristic) shouldn\'t have the chances shown in Group 1?

Are you arguing that percentage chances shown in Group 2 are not a
substantial benefit for the person who has Skill-1?

Are you arguing that (in Group 2) that if this is Dex, that better Dex
shouldn\'t help out someone with the skill?

Or are you arguing that Skill-1 should be the same regardless of
Characteristic?

Or are you arguing that skill percentages should rise at 10% per level?

Or are you arguing that task resolution is too easy?

 Instead of The normal:
 
 Enlistment: Throw 7+ to enlist in Scouts, DM +1 if Int 6+, DM +2 if Str 8+.
 
 I\'ve used this:
 
 To Enlist in the Scouts:
 	Routine, (Linguistics or Space),(INT or STR), 5min Unskilled OK
 	Referee:  Character may choose which skill and which stat to use on this
 task.
 
 To Survive a Year in the Administration Office:
 	Simple, (Admin or Liason), INT, Fateful
 	Referee: If Training, Base, or Routine assignment, automatic success.
 
 To gain a skill for one Year in the Exploration Branch:
 	<Difficulty>, Admin,(INT or EDU), Unskilled OK
 	Referee: If Training, Base or Routine assignment Difficulty = Simple
 	if Mission, Spl Mission, or War Man, Difficulty = Routine
 
 
 The actual chances to enlist/survive, gain a skill are not the same, but it
 changes chargen from something that it done *to* a character, to something
 that is done *by* a character.
 
 Im waiting for the T4.1 charagen sheets from MM so that I\'ll be able to do
 similar things to them.

The problem with rolling for skills is the same as the problem of people
dying during character generation...some people get short changed for no real
benefit.

Rolling for skills makes some people come up short for no real benefit.

Marc,

First, I would like to say thanks for discussing this issue with us, 
explaining your reasoning, and allowing us input.  I am convinced 
that T4.1 will be a better game because of it.

Secondly, I would like to say that although I understand your 
rationale, I disagree with it totally.  In both of the cases you 
mention, I think that it is absolutely ridiculous to give attribute 
the same weight as skill.  In the medical example (quoted above), you 
say that a Dex 11 Skill 1 character and a Dex 3 Skill 6 character 
should be able to Fix the Defective Valve equally as well.  I think 
that\'s crazy! :)  IMO, the skill 1 character should not even be able 
to _find_ the Defective Valve.  He hasn\'t the training to know what 
he\'s looking for and no level of Dex can change that.  As a sidebar, 
I also think that the Skill 1 character should have a MUCH greater 
chance of SF in the above task and the Skill 6 character should have 
a much greater chance of SS.

I think that both examples only serve to further illustrate how 
broken the current task system is and how much it needs to be 
revised.

Thanks for listening,
WKH

   So far as I know, there is but one, and it is generally considered
errata.

   First some background for the others...

   If you open up a copy of "The Traveller Book" (copyright GDW, 1982),
which is a sort of compulation of the classic Traveller Books 1-3 with
some other stuff thrown in, you will see on pages 86-87 a tech level
chart showing the tech level that various things appear.  You will note
that under TL 12 there is a listing for "primitive robots" and under TL
17 there is a reference for "self-aware robots".  Later publications,
such as the "MegaTraveller Referee\'s Companion" use this same chart with
some modifications.  

   "Supplement 10: The Solomani Rim" from the classic Traveller era
talks about the Terran discovery of jump-3, and how that gave them a
decisive advantage in the Interstellar Wars.  We know that jump-3 is a
TL 12 achievement, which fixes the tech level of the Terran
Confederation at TL 12.  This number is confirmed by a number of later
publications.

   No publication has said "the tech level of the Rule of Man was \'x\'",
\'x\' being a number between 12 and whatever.  However, there are some
clues available.  

   The first is in the MegaTraveller Imperial Encyclopedia, which
contains a timeline on pages 6-7 that suggests that the "Terran Navy
uses artificially intelligent robots", the date for this, -2389, is 134
years prior to the end of the last of the Interstellar Wars.  This would
lead one to conclude that the Rule of Man must have had a TL of at least
16, perhaps even 17.

   This is contradicted, however, by at least two other sources.  The
first, "Book 8: Robots", gives the date -2389 as the year "the Terran
Confederation Navy commissioned a line of mass-produced tech level 12
[note: 12 **not** 16] robots as support staff for military personnel". 
This information is later confirmed in the "MegaTraveller Referee\'s
Companion", which also says, "Less than 200 years later, Naasirka
introduced the first line of robots for private, nonmilitary use. 
Dubbed "Rashush," these housekeeping and valet robots spread rapidly,
thanks to a powerful, high-prestige advertising campaign.  Although
expensive, ownership of these useful robots was within the reach of many
rich citizens of the Second Imperium.  "Rushush" were TL 12 robots, and
this is confirmed in DGP\'s "101 Robots".

   It\'s apparent that the reference in the Imperial Encyclopedia to
"artificially intelligent robots" is errata (and there is tons of that
in MegaTraveller\'s tables and charts), and the TL 12 figure is probably
the correct one.  Certainly Traveller Canon (what is generally accepted
as truth, versus what the publishing company says) places the tech level
of the ROM at 12, with perhaps some worlds verging on or crossing over
to 13.

   As to other evidence regarding the TL of the Rule of Man, I\'d want to
see proper citations (publication and page numbers) before I\'d believe
that any exists, particularly if it quotes a figure higher than 12 or
13.  In that regard, T4 doesn\'t count.

1.  T4 is weighted too heavily against stats.  Skills have a minor part in
a character\'s success at a task throw.  These should be equally weighted.
RATING = 1 - Stats are given far too much weight vs Skills in T4.1
2.  Spectacular Success and Spectacular Failure are hard to do at easy and
average, and easier at harder levels.
RATING = 3 - SF should be more common as things get harder, and SS  more
common as things get easier.  This reverse bell-curve is not good.
3.  It should be harder to roll SS the harder a task becomes.
RATING = 3 - This is really the same as the above.
4.  Replace SS with SF in 3
RATING = 3 - This is really the same as the above.
5.  I don\'t like the half-die. Get rid of it.
RATING = 2 - This feels too much like a "I\'m different" gimmick, and serves
little useful purpose.

Or, to summarize
1. = 1
2. = 3
3. = 3
4. = 3
5. = 2

As for KBv2.0 vs MT; I was using a modified MT task system before Kenneth\'s
system was proposed, and I did not want to switch task systems until we saw
what happens to T4.1, so I have not studied the merits of KBv2.0 vs MT.
However, I\'m not all that thrilled with a climbing scale of dice quantity
based on difficulty regardless.  Still, KBv2.0 is a large improvement over
T4.0.

Also, I should point out that my group has 6 players (including myself, all
of use at least 6-year Trav veterans) and we have been discussing this
issue.  All of us agree that Skills are MUCH more important than stats.
since I am the only TMLer of the bunch, I thought it only fair to mention
that.

 Now maybe if you had 12 or 15 characteristics and you evenly distributed

Sure it makes sense, but Traveller just isn\'t going to adopt D100\'s, or 12
characteristics versus the current 6, or etc.

So then, you say decrease trhe value of characteristic versus skill. What is
the current value (in terms of percentage chance of success) for one level of
characteristic? Quantify it.

Then quantify the value of one level of skill.

Then express it as a ratio.

Then we can discuss what the new ratio should be.

But right now, we\'re just saying characteristics range from 1 to 15 and
skills range from 1 to 6 (and we don\'t agree on that).

I\'ve run mountains of spreadsheets on the probabilities, and it just doesn\'t
seem to me to be worth the effort of dividing characteristics by something,
or multiplying skills by something to get different, but not too much
different range ofprobabilities.

Actually, I would say that the question people are interested is
which Traveller system (which is why I suggested that I prefered MT)
would be best.

(Otherwise, I might have suggested GURPS.  I did write that GURPS
Traveller article after all :-).

That\'s fine.  It just the view that one way is supposedly so much

[stuff about how EDU relates to skills snipped]
 
> To me, EDU does not measure EDUcation, it measures EDUcationability.

The discussion as to what EDU actually *was* was discussed in depth a
few months ago.  Eris, myself, and a number of others seemed to define
EDU as "EDUcationability", otherwise known as "a character\'s ability
to learn" (possibly including certain miscellaneous knowledge not
specifically covered by skills).  Far more individuals, however, felt
that EDU defined the time spent actually learning, with advanced
education and degrees indicating a higher EDU rating (a view that
seems to have been adopted for T4.1).

Marc, if EDU is going to define one\'s level or "degree" of education,
fewer skills should use it as their controlling attribute.  I agree
that an individual\'s exposure to the educational system found at a
college or university could be beneficial for some skills, but EDU is
handed out too generously during character creation and the number of
skills currently linked to it makes it the most powerful character
statistic by far.

If, however, you plan on reducing the number of skills based on EDU, I
do not have a problem with the EDU definition.

Marc, have you never worked at something for weeks and ended up with "no
real benefit?" ;-> I know *I* have!  I\'d prefer that not happen *too* often
to players, but just like injury a wasted quarter-term might be a
possibility.

I\'ve also had the opposite happen. I\'ve had "breakthroughs" and advanced
more  rapidly in a skill than my usual plodding pace. 

So, my preference is to make the benefit gained variable.  I know that\'s
not like any previous version of published Traveller, but it is still my
preference.  You advance by only 1 Experience Point (EP) in this skill this
term, next you advance by 3 EP, and next term you are do especially well
and advance by 6 EP.  Eventually, all the EP\'s are converted into Skill
Points that are used in tasks.  After CharGen ends players continue to
increase EP\'s which convert over to Skill Points at a 5 to 1 ratio.

The way the game stands now, and per your proposal, I\'d expect anyone who
could to get an advanced education. Wouldn\'t you?  

OTOH, for "gaming purposes" there should be alternative roads to the same
level of Target Numbers (Stat and Skill) that don\'t lead through Graduate
School. In many cases the alternative roads *should* take longer, but (and
here\'s were we seem to disagree) they shouldn\'t take 4 or 5 years longer
per skill.  Phil PhD spends 2 terms going through college and grad school,
entering some career 8 years after Andy Average, in those 8 years Andy has
earned 8 skills, but so has Phil and Phil has boosted his EDU to 12 far
above the natural 7 both he and Andy started with. Andy is at 2 or 3 in
several useful skills, but Phil picks up 1\'s in Andy\'s best areas during
the next term and outclasses Andy everywhere!  Even if you argue that this
is realistic (I don\'t), it isn\'t "game friendly."

The other point you bring up concerns modifiers.  No, we haven\'t talked
about modifiers too much in our discussions. Maybe we should, most of us
will include them in the calculations, but...well, I haven\'t because I
thought they would "muddy the waters."   If all sides get the same DM\'s,
then the DM\'s sort of cancel out of the discussion.

Coincidentally, they\'re *already* listed in order of importance, IMHO.

The stat vs. skill issue needs to be addressed first, followed by the
way SS and SF occur.  As I\'ve stated before, the use of half-dice is
really only an esthetic peeve.  Get rid of them if you can, but get
the *mechanics* working first.  It\'s not as if including half-dice
make the dice any more difficult to add up...

Three\'s nine extra years studying demolitions will give him something
that Eleven will not gain: confidence and hands-on experience.  It
would be strange that a person that managed *not* to blow himself up
during nine years of training would not also gain a few points of DEX
while he was at it.  It only makes sense.  If statistics can improve,
a person that works with his/her hands all day long should be able to
increase their DEX (or STR).

The way I look at it, the first few skill levels cover the learned
knowledge regarding the subject in question (perhaps 80% basic theory,
20% practicing on cadavers).  The later skill levels (level 4+, for
example) would consist mainly of experience learned on the job (80%
on-the-job experience, %20 from attending lectures and conventions).

IMHO, the measurable difference between two individuals with
drastically different aptitudes (such as Three and Eleven) is no where
near the difference between, say, a veteran surgeon and someone that
just completed a rudimentary industrial first-aid course.

This would be fine, except that the task should take at least twice as

I disagree strongly.  Being able to perform an operation with your
good arm tied behind your back and performing strictly by feel does
*not* compare with a "shaky" doctor possessing several years of
schooling & experience... they should /both/ fail!  Three should have
retired to a teaching job while Eleven couldn\'t possibly know *how* to
perform the procedure with only 1 skill level (which would probably
consist of more basic theory than experience).

What we have here are Talent and Skill, both as linear numbers...

There\'s no recognition that no matter how high a skill might be, there\'s
a "minimum" stat below which the skill actually cannot be performed...

There\'s also no real impact that both the Talent and Skill impact
curves should be bell-shaped, somehow...

Let\'s face it - it takes some DEX to be a good Marine, and some STR...
Someone with a 3 in each will be horrible, no matter how skilled he is 
trained...  but at some point, perhaps DEX/STR 7+, or higher, someone with
little skill will definitely OUTPERFORM someone with no skill, and if 
someone has a high skill it will be even more... but, two persons with
high stats and high skils, will do well to score on the other (which is
why Grandmaster-level chess matches require so many games for a decision).

Note - Some would say that Patrick Ewing has a better DEX than Michael
Jordan; but they both have high DEXs, and the true impact is how much more
skilled a player Jordan is than Ewing...  (Please don\'t flame me if you\'re
a Ewing fan, ok?) 

How this enters the task system, I have no idea - I would hate having
stat minimums and bell curve mods for each skill.  I want it simple, but
I think Marc\'s point fits here better than the "STAS Uber Alles" position
T4 took...

Marc, I don\'t have probability tables for 2.5 die handy, so I\'m going to
convert your percentages to 3d6, Formidable tasks, which I *do* have
sitting in front of me.

    I assume you are rounding down for the middle two.  I also added Ken\'s
    KB1.1, and KB2.0 for comparison, and because KB2.0 uses 4d6 for
    Formidable tasks I\'ll use 4d for that column.

With it now being a Formidable task, I\'d say T41\'s and both KB\'s are at
about the correct success rate.  KB2 might be a *little* high, but it\'s
acceptable to me.

>Are you arguing that percentage chances shown in Group 2 are not a
>substantial benefit for the person who has Skill-1?

That\'s begging the question, Marc.  Of course the benefit is substantial
because the benefit isn\'t *1* for T41 or KB2, it is 3 in the case of N=5, 4
in the case of N=7, and 5 in the case of N=9.  I would even argue that T41
is *too* generous in its increase.  I think the rate of increase by KB2 is
best here.

Let\'s look at the steps from Skill 1 to 2 and 2 to 3. 

                                             KB1.1           KB2.0

>Are you arguing that (in Group 2) that if this is Dex, that better Dex
>shouldn\'t help out someone with the skill?

I\'m not.  I would just like the ratio between the portion coming from Dex
and the portion coming from Skill to close faster than T41.  I, personally,
think the closing rate should be between that of T41 and KB2.

>Or are you arguing that Skill-1 should be the same regardless of
>Characteristic?

My argument is that a skill-1 really *should* differ due to differing
Characteristic values, but that is unlikely to be directly addressed.

>Or are you arguing that skill percentages should rise at 10% per level?

Certainly, not.  Are you?  ;-> T41\'s do appear to be progressing about
about 10% per level once you get past the initial boost. ;->

>Or are you arguing that task resolution is too easy?

The original task system certainly was, that\'s why I went to more dice. T41
might actually be too hard on Staggering and Impossible tasks.  KB2, is a
*little* too easy on Impossible tasks, but works well in the middle where
most tasks will be.

I do!  

If T4.1 uses KB 1.1 then the number of dice being rolled is just the same
as in the system used in the Game Screen.  The *only* difference between
the two systems is that the KB 1.1 uses 1/2 Stat + 2*Skill instead of Stat
+ Skill.  I\'d still prefer the MT, but KB 1.1 may be the best option given
the current situation. 

I still have problems about Impossible task being too easy in KB1.1, but
the situation is *far* worse in KB 2.0 and no better in the current
system.  MT is the *only* system for Traveller where Impossible tasks are
actually unlikely for highly skilled PCs...(If you assume a Skill 5, Stat
11 PC [good, but not *that* rare], in MT they have a 1 in 36 chance, in KB
1.1 they have arround a 40% chance, and in KB 2.0 they have around a 70%
chance (which in this respect makes KB 2.0 notably *worse* than the
current system).

I\'m arguing that it should not help out *as* much as it does.  With skill
level 1 the difference between a 5 stat and a 9 stat is between 17% (ie
almost no chance of success) and 62% (ie a high chance of success).  Heck
a *minor* difference in stats, between a 7 and a 9 (basically between
someone average and someone *slightly* above average) means that the two
characters have a 23% difference in their chances of success.  

At this point, why bother with more than skill level 1 with anything? Why
not just send your PC to college, get an Edu of B and then roll on the
Physical Development table until you have an 11 Dex and not worry about
having any Edu or Dex skills over 1?  Such a PC would have a 12 in *all*
Edu & Dex skills with only 1 skill level.  Meanwhile, someone with an 8 (a
good, above average, stat) would only have a total of 11 (ie not as good)
if they took 3 levels in a skill.  This type of system encourages
munchkins and does not make sense. 

>Or are you arguing that Skill-1 should be the same regardless of

No, only that they should be *less* influenced by characteristics

>Or are you arguing that skill percentages should rise at 10% per level?

No

>Or are you arguing that task resolution is too easy?

Well, that to.  Task resolution is too easy for the most difficult tasks, 
but that\'s not the point if this argument.

formed, and also goes into details on stars etc.  It also gives a variety
of equations and example calculations to support \'world building\'. Now, I
can\'t say how it compares to the WBH as I don\'t own that, but it is a very
welcome companion to Bk6 and the WTH. You don\'t need an excessive maths
ability to use it (no worse than High Guard...) and I think that it would
be a welcome addition to most Traveller GMs shelves, whether Gearhead or
not. Especially as it concentrates on giving you an understanding of the
little, vivid details that you can hang a story on. IMO, of course.

One possible solution to this is to remove the Edu bonus from advanced
education. Now this seems radical, but its not too unrealistic actually. If
Edu is indicative of knowledge, then thats not what you generally learn
in collage. What you learn in collage is how to aquire knowledge, not
the knowledge (outside the specific fields you study) itself. Thus a
collage educated character can use the \'skills\' gained at collage to mimic
higher skill levels by research (if given time), but they will not be able
to automatically function at higher skill levels just by benefit of higher
education. E.G. A trained lawyer can function as a historian if given
sufficent time (they have the skills to study and research); however
they can not automatically do so since they just don\'t have the specific
knowledge that a trained historian does at their fingertips. OR if I am
sick I will go and see a doctor, not a biology professor who\'s done a
first aid course.

This could be represented by removing the Edu bonus of advanced
education and replacing it with automatic reseach skill. This naturally
would require decoupling Edu with the level of academic insitution
attended, but that\'s not neccessarily a bad thing. As I see it, Edu is
measuring the characters level of general knowledge and that is
independent of schooling.

If you let people pick their birthdays this will only encourage
munchkinism as every player says "Today is my birthday, I was just
discharged from the service this morning." thus pushing back the day
they have to roll their aging saves by a few months.

I think that a player charecters birthday should not be random but
should have usually occurred shortly before the start of the campaign. 
If you have to be 18 to start a career (this seems to be Imperial law
(TNE used 17)) then many people are going to have joined up as soon as
they could, on their birthday.  Therefore they will finish there 4 year
terms about the time of their birthday.  Since many or most campaigns
start shortly after the PC\'s leave their old jobs they should have been
discharged fairly recently.

The system I use when I generate charecters is to roll 1d6 * 1d6 * 1d6
for the number of days ago the charecters birthday was at the start of
the campaign (although you may wish to adjust this for cold sleep weeks
now that they are in the system).  Using this system charecters
birthdays (which will have a high correlation with their term start/end
dates) will have occured an average of 43 days ago but can range from 1
to 216 days ago.  This will represent a reality in which many people
joined up shortly after reaching the age of maturity, served terms of
very close to exactly four years, and mustered out not very long ago.

If you randomly determine birthday this means that of two identical 38
year old veterans 1 may be 38 years and 0 days old while another is 38
years and 364 days old.  This is neither plausible nor fair to the
player of the older charecter, who will have to make aging rolls sooner.

Bingo! That\'s the problem in a nutshell... In T4 the skills are not what
makes the character, it\'s the stats they possess. Yet the character
generation system seems to be skill oriented. 
If the skill tables were roughly split 50/50 between skill increases and
stat increases, it would make more sense, especially because the task
system weights both equally during roleplay.
**Please Note** that I am not advocating this. Traveller to me has always
been a "skill" oriented system, with stats only providing minimal support.
This is the type of system I would like to see adopted.

Oh no... I feel a silly moment coming on....

12.2 And lo, Harry did dream of a perfect Traveller game, that was
universally accepted by all. And the TML did speak kindly of this game.

12.3 And the TML looked upon the character generation, and they did say
"look, it does fit neatly to the task system, and fills our players full of
roleplaying ideas"

12.4 And the TML looked upon the starship construction rules, and they did
say "look, it fit\'s exactly with our idea of the physics of the future, and
very nicely complements the starship combat system, but is easy to use!"

12.5 And the TML looked upon the details of this game, and saw that it all
fit canon perfectly, and they were greatly pleased by this.

12.6 And there was much rejoicing in the roleplaying community. And they
did play weekly, sometimes twice weekly, and there was much eating of
crisps, and drinking of soft drinks. And travellers did become fat and
imaginitive.

12.7 And then Harry did wake, and said unto his players "what\'s going on
then?" And his players did groan, and throw dice, chips and cola.  

..............Oh well, back to the exam study.

Put the T4.1 system in the rulebook. But put KBv2 in too as a sidebar,
keeping the descriptions of task difficulty the same (eg \'average), as an
official alternative system that isn\'t stats dominated.

Two hours into reading the TML digests that came overnight I sympathise!
How you manage to read it *and* find time to work on the system I don\'t
know! (not to mention real life!).

Tasks are good - one of the things that  I really liked about MT. T4 is
simpler than MT, and IMO more elegant. I just have problems with the
weighting of skills against attributes (echoed here on the list), possibly
as I believe that a skill level corresponds to an absolute minimum value,
(eg MD at lvl 3) and that the range that attributes give swamps this too
much.

Fundamentally, any solution/change you come up with isn\'t going to please
everyone, which is why I suggested sticking with T4.1 as written and
putting in KBv2 as a sidebar alternative system.

Anyway, your posts have provoked a reaction in the TML that I\'ve never seen
before, and the volume jump in mail is painful! I suppose it\'s only to be
expected as most of us here care for the game a lot.

All the best

Dom

IIRC attributes influence the entry into certain careers. If you don\'t have
the skill for the job, you get unemployed. Natural aptitude does help, but
raw talent will not overcome training and skill in most cases. A skill
level of, say, three indicates a certain minimum standard of performance
IMO. The dominance of attribute over skill in T4 means that this minimum
standard is not consistent between characters.

Effectively, the spread in the target number due to attribute means that a
skill-3, stat 10 character is twice as good as a skill 3 stat 7, because
their attribute difference accounts for a 100% of the skill value. I do not
believe that this is realistic, or playable. Skills cease to be absolutes
and the GM has to generate high stat NPCs to oppose the players. The whole
generation process looses it\'s attraction.

In addition, the attraction is to power game the stats and fiddle the
rolls. The attraction of CT and MT to me (I won\'t comment on TNE as I
haven\'t read it in a year) is that a character with a lousy, honestly
rolled, UPP can become valuable through training and aquisition of skills
from a career, something that T4 throws away.

We (presumptous of me to assume I\'m arguing the same point as Bruce) aren\'t
arguing that attributes shouldn\'t influence target numbers, just that
skills should be weighted more highly.

I couldn\'t agree more - my initial post was really just a reminder that its
the *practical application* of whatever system that is used that counts. Its

I too come from the early CT, AD&D etc.. generation.

In my day and age we had reams of rules and modifiers and tables on every
possible occurance and we jolly well put up with them. Young folk today,
don\'t know there born.
<OLD CODGER MODE OFF>
I think we remember the old systems with such fondness because they were
*FUN*. For me, I still get a kick from rolling a twenty or trying to follow
the rules in \'The Mountain Enviroment\'

I must agree with this, my players always had a problem with this system.
As a referee *I* liked it, they disliked it. However to be fair it was the
first task based system we tried.

I will repeat again, I think the current system and its revisions are on the
right path. Just a few steps away from enlightenment.

Given absolute power over all things Traveller, hmmmmm, now theres a whole
wish fufilment thread.

Well here goes, I would like to go to an alternative universe where DGP got
to finish all the promised products (i.e. The rest of the alien books, the
black duke, the omnesium quest, etc.....) Also i would have loved to have
seen the GDW products Flashback (in the back of COACC) and Rebels Tales
(Back of Fighting Ships). Any others with wishes out there..........

What about doing the same thing with Traveller?  That is, leave the task

The basic principles of a hot air balloon are really low
tech...Historically the hot air balloon was invented in the 1700\'s, but
the principle was used in toys and tricks far, far earlier than that.

In theory, you could have a TL-1 or 2 hot air balloon. It would be at the
mercy of the winds, and if you\'re living on mountaintops, that will be a
large factor.

Powered airships were invented at TL-4,5 or so here, and are dependednt on
the invention of light, powerful powersources for the propellors, and the
isolation of hydrogen (easy) or helium (harder). The isolation of
hydrogen is in turn dependent on the use of electricity (Gad I feel like
James Burke ;-), which again started in the TL-3,4 18th century,
here. Electricity helps, too, because that\'s the only way to get aluminum,
which is prebably an essential element for airship construction, although
composite materials could be developed earlier. Modern composites are more
dependent on the advances of chemistry, and less on a big industrial
infrastructure than are lightweight alloys...metalwork always needs bigger
machines than chemistry does. 

A few advances in organic chemistry occuring
a little earlier, and the great organic chem \'explosion\' of the 1800\'s
could have pretty easily occurred a century or more before; all it would
have taken is some of the earlier intellectual advances to happen earlier,
perhaps, by, saaay, the Arab world spreading farther and becomng more
dominant, undercutting the heavy hand of the Church, or that China be
considerably less isolationist.

Lightweight, powerful engines are the limiting factor, I would think,
since they would take the greatest amount of industrial infrastructure

I agree a Dex 7 Med-4 Doctor should beat a Dex-11 Med-1 EMT. But at what?
Suturing?... must doctors use the Med-1\'s or so to do that anyway. Open Heart
Surgery?... aside from the legal ramifications, what difference is there
between using the Dex-11 guy for the very steady work (which is why doctors
tried out a robot something or other a few years ago... to get that Dex-11
they didn\'t personally have).(or why there is a team in the operating room).

Dex 11 gives the EMT an 18% chance of success (Difficult Task Default Skill);
Med-1 adds 73% to his chance of success. (If Char/3, the chances are 4% and
+5%)

Dex 7 gives the Doctor 4% chance of success; Med-1 gives the doctor +39%
chance of success, and the total of Med-1 through 4 gives him +78% chance of
success. (If Char/3, the chances are 1%, +3%, and +28%).

I suppose some of this depends on the definition of Difficult task. Under T4
or T41, these guys succeed 90% of the time or so. Under Char/3, they succeed
99% (EMT) or 29% (Doctor). 

Is your argument that the chance of success (in this case, these characters,
this situation, Difficult task) about 1/3?

What if the Characteristic for the task is Int? Then you have the classic
conflict that we see in ER every week... Int-7 Med-4 Doctor argues with
Int-11 Med-1 EMT. The doctor knows he\'s right because he\'s a doctor... the
EMT just knows the answer. Make than an opposed task and they can argue about
which treatment to give the patient.

Zeppelins, and similar lighter than air ships are the way to go.  TL 5 is 
easily justified, probably TL 4 if you want to look at earth history:

1852: first powered flight of 30 km from Paris to Trappes using a hydrogen 
filled bag 43 m long x 12 m diameter, powerd by Henri Giffard\'s "light 
weight" steam engine which weighed 160 kg.

There were numerous other powered airship experiments culminating in the 
first Zeppelin in 1900.  Later Zeppelins entered passenger service in 1912, 
becoming the worlds first commercial airline.  During the 1930\'s you could 
travel across the atlantic by airship.

If your world is a regressed colony, I would reckon that steam driven 
airships are maintainable technology at TL 4 (below this it is unlikely that 
the steam engines can be made light enough).  If the civilisation has built 
up from lower TL, I would say that TL 5 is required, as the airships are 
unlikey to have a useful range until internal combustion becomes 
established.

If you really want the world to be low-tech, you can postulate TL 3 hot air 
ballons pulled along by local flying creatures.  Hot air ballons have too 
little bouyancy to carry a useful load, based on my calculations, whereas 
hydrogen-filled bags provide much more lift - enough for the passengers and 
the engines.  Production of hydrogen gas should be considered easily 
available at TL 4 in my opinion, but again you can find TL 3 examples if you 
are desparate to keep the TL down!

It\'s only a problem if you think that a skill of 4 (or whatever) means the
same thing as a characteristic of 4. It doesn\'t; they run off different
scales. A skill of 4 is very high, a characteristic of 4 is very low.

>That was my point.  The net spread, or variation, of
>skill numbers is not qualitatively different than the spread of
>stats.

This is not true. As I pointed out in my earlier post, the two are
substantially different. Skills typically have a range of 2 or 3 points.
Characteristics have a range of 7 or more points. This is not simply a
quirk of the character generation system, it is a fundamental game
mechanic. If the variation of skills were not qualitatively different than
the spread of characteristics cases where a skill is a negative DM, like
defending using Brawling, would not work. You would get things like
negative target numbers.

>Well, every skill roll uses each stat and skill once, so usage
>is the same.

While it\'s true a task roll uses one skill and one characteristic, it\'s not
true their usage is the same. There are many more skills than
characteristics, so each characteristic is used with several skills. If you
examine the skill list you will see that characteristics are used many
times more than skills.

>Well, unless I\'m wrong, stats of 14 are not suppose to be common
>and skills above 2 are suppose to be relatively common for someone
>who is conentrating on that.

First of all, it is not valid to compare a "common" characteristic with a
skill you are "concentrating on"; you should compare typical
characteristics and skills or ones that are both being "concentrated on".
It is quite easy to get a characteristic of 14 if you "concentrate" on it,
especially Education using the T4 rules. Also, your claim was that
characteristics and skills were not "qualitatively different", so the
comparison of a characteristic of 14 with a skill of 2 is not supportive
your claim.

>I haven\'t used Traveller enough to comment on the importance of
>skills and stats outside of the task resolution system.

There is no way one can get an adequate understanding of any game mechanic
without playtesting; I believe the current imbalances in the task system
and experience rules are evidence of that. Characteristics are used in many
rules outside the task system and this has to be included in any comparison
between the effects of characteristics and skills.

>As I pointed out in my other post. They are equally weighted.
>Its not the size of the numbers that shows how much its
>weighted, its the variation.

Yes, you made this claim several times; it\'s just not correct. Skills and
characteristics are not even close to being "evenly weighted". The average
characteristic is about 4 times that of the average skill. Characteristics
typically vary by 10 or more points than skills. The combination totally
overwhelms any contribution skills make to the task system. And of course
in mechanics like the personal pools, strength rolls, enlistment rolls,
promotion rolls, and so on, skills are not included and have no worth at
all. Having a Pilot-16 skill would have no effect whatsoever on your
ability to get, keep, or be successful in a piloting career.

I am actually quite confused on what you base your assertions that the
variation of skills and characteristics are the same. What character
generation system do you use? The one in the rulebook bases characteristics
on a 2d6 roll while starting all skills off at zero. Before you even begin
a career, characteristics can vary by 10 points while skills do not vary at
all. Character generation includes both positive and negative modifiers for
characteristics but only positive modifiers for skills. This tends to
increase the starting variation in characteristics more than skills. The
characteristics of the sample character shown on page 25 of the T4 rule
book vary by 5 points while the skills vary by no more than 2 points. And I
think this example shortchanges the characteristic variation since Mr.
Jamison\'s lowest characteristic is a 7. Certainly characters my players and
I have generated have far greater variation in characteristrics than skills.

>The idea that skills should count more than
>attributes is one that has been kicked around in a

I agree with this sentiment, it\'s just not relevant to this discusion. In
the T4 rules characteristics have a totally overwhelming effect on tasks
and skills have practically no effect at all. It is not an issue of whether
skills should "count more", right now they hardly count at all.

I also have one astonishing bit of news. Nearly all of the proposed
alternate task systems DO NOT count skills more than characteristics.
KBv2.0 certainly does not. With a typical characteristics of 8 and a skills
of 2, the tripling effect of KBv2.0 makes characteristics contribute around
6 points, or about 42% of the target number. And of course characteristics
are still used in more tasks and it does nothing about all the rolls skills
do not count in at all. KBv2.0 still weighs characteristics more than
skills. The difference is than in KBv2.0 skills have a minor effect and in
T4.1 they have effectively none.

>Most definately.  The idea that a talented beginner could beat

>reasonable on a lot of other lists.

This is a utter straw man. None of the alternate proposed systems have the
effect you seem to be claiming; in every system a character with a high
characteristics has an edge over one with a lower characteristic. In every
system a top notch expert has to have a high controlling attribute as well
as a high skill. The only difference is that with the T4 system ones\' skill
level is practically irrelevant.

Hmmm.  Yes, that could very well be the way out I couldn\'t find in my 
previous message on this subject.  Skill could be the key to good DM\'s, 
whereas low skill could lead to lower DMs.  Hmmm.  That could easily make 
the task system unwieldy, but, perhaps there is a way...?

In Real Life, ISTM the main reason for someone who *can* go to Uni but 
does\'t is money. Either they can\'t afford it, or they\'d rather have a job 
now than in 3-4 years time. Maybe the rules should include some way to 
represent this?

I have no arguement with this, in fact I would like it if the T4 task
system worked this way. It does not. A character with a low dexterity does
not have "a low aptitude" for demolitions, he or she is fundamentally
incapable of ever becoming a demolitons expert. While a low-Dex character
may "decide to avoid learning that skill", he or she has no greater
difficulty in learning than a high-Dex character; they both learn
Demolitions at the same rate and difficulty.

One would assume that learning a skill like Demolitions would involve
actually involve preparing and defusing actual (or simulated) explosive,
this is apparently not the case because the effort to learn is the same for
high and low-Dex characters even though the low-Dex character has
effectively zero chance to complete an exercise correctly. This is because
when you learn a skill you will have a skill level of zero. A low-Dex
character with skill zero can succeed most task rolls only with a
spectacular success. The high-Dex character can only fail even a Difficult
task with a spectacular failure. This leads me to believe that the totally
dominant effect of a controlling characteristic conflicts with the
character generation system.

This sounds fine, and has a lot of play potential. But this is not how the
existing task system works. There are not separate target numbers for
theoretical experience, practical experience, instructions, and "nimble
finger work". There is a single target number for a task, if the task is
based on Dex then Three and Eleven have the same effectiveness.

I believe this is example of the gross imbalance between skills and
characteristics. A skill level of 9 is extremely high in Traveller. No
characters given in the rules, in any of the CT adventures I own, or
players in my campaign have any skill levels even close to 9. The
description of a skill level 6 at Douglas Barry\'s "Traveller: The Silly
Era" page describes physically impossible abilities. I know the page is a
gag, but the convention seems to be that skill 6 is extremely high. A skill
of 9 would be almost indescribable. A character defending with Brawling-9
can give a mediocre fighter a negative task number. None of the tables
which use skill as a DM are capable of handling a skill of 9 unless you
arbitrarily cut off the DM allowed. The Actual Value table does this at
Broker-4, which means a skill level of 4 acts the same as one of 9 for
determing value. This makes high skills even less worthwhile.

Moreover, a characteristic of 11 is not extremely high in Traveller. The
sample character in the rules has a characteristic above 11 and so do my
players, in many cases considerably higher.

Yet this merely above-average characteristic matches a skill level which is
so high the rules break down in trying to describe it. Not only this one
skill, but every skill Dex applies to, and there are a lot. A character
with a 9 in every Dex-based skill would require hundreds of years of career
rolls to do this, assuming that such a character could pass all the injury
and continuance rolls and still be learning even at these skill levels. And
after all this, the low-Dex character would still be outclassed by a
14-year-old with no training whatsoever who rolled a Dex of 12. From
character generation, about 3% of 14-year-old kids will start with a Dex
12, and players tend to increase characteristics in character generation; I
have characters with a Dex of 15. Actually, such characters are still
stronger that characters with any level of skill because Dex is used for
other things beside task rolls.

>The purpose of the Traveller task system and its mix of characteristics and

I agree the task system is just a mechanic for story-telling. But it is a
mechanic that harms the game and turns the stories into farces. It is a
loophole that rewards abusive players who make most of their generation
rolls on the physical and mental development tables. It unbalances the game
by making characters\' performance almost totally dependent on a random die
roll at the beginning of character generation instead of the choices the
player makes. It harms role-playing by making all high-Dex (or whatever)
characters effectively identical. It cheats players who made a few bad die
rolls at character generation out of ever contributing meaningfully to the
game. It makes "specialist" characters who are superb at one skill and poor
at others impossible.

Someone proposed that the task system be left as is, that all the
obssessives here on the TML will use whatever task system they want and
that new players won\'t care. I disagree. It is new players that will be
punished by doing this, since they won\'t be exposed to the task system
alternates. They will eventually notice that characters with high
characteristics have superhuman abilities and assume Traveller is a
Lensman-like space opera and play accordingly. Or switch to the other, more
high-profile space opera science fiction RPG.

Yes, Marc, it is completely clear that you are considering every 
option.

I very much appreciate this, as does many here on the list.  This is

You should be commended for that.  I know it can be frustrating, but

If you go with KBv2.0, you could have your cake and eat it too.

In KBv2.0, a character\'s SS chance is based on how skilled he is.  
That Rifle-5 character has a much better chance of rolling SS than a 
character using gun combat as a default skill.

It makes sense to me that characters with higher skill levels are 
better at a task and therefore can achieve SS more often than 
characters with lower skills.

How is this done?  It\'s pretty easy, really.  Instead of having a set 
target number for SS (i.e. your 3 one\'s roll), the target number is 
variable and based on a characte\'s skills.

SS in KBv2.0 is:

SS Target Number = Skill Level + Dice Code.


This is how easy it is...
For example, an average character (Stat-7;  Skill-2), throws for a 
difficult task.  He throws his 4 dice (KBv2.0 Difficult dice code).  
If he rolls below 13 (KBv2.0 target number), he has a regular 
success.  But, if the result of that one roll is below 6 (Level 2 + 
Dice Code 4), he has rolled SS.

I think that in this way, the game could be made more exciting rather 
than using the notes you used above.

And, buy using KBv2.0\'s SS system, the chance to roll SS is harder 
the harder the task becomes, so that problem is solved.

And, with KBv2.0, SS is possible at all difficulty levels.  Your 
system is broken in that SS is possible only at Difficult and higher 
difficulty levels (besides being easier to achieve at the higher 
levels).

Clearly, we need a SS system that can (a) be rolled at all difficulty 
levels--especially the lower ones because with easier tasks, it 
should be easier to roll SS, and (b) it should be harder to roll SS 
the harder the task becomes.

KBv2.0 answers both of these requirements with flying colors, and it 
has the added benefit of being sensitive to a character\'s skill 
level.

We should increase skill level--not decrease attribute--because of 
the combat issue.

KBv2.0 handles this nicely....

Target Number = Attribute + Experience

where     Experience = Skill x 3


The multiplication is only done once.  You write a character\'s 
experience score next to the skill name, level, and base 
characteristics on the character sheet.

The only time this is changed is when a skill is improved--which 
won\'t be that often.

In combat, KBv2.0 works just like (and just as simple) as T4 and T4.1 
do.  When a target number is needed, the player adds his current 
attribute to the experience score (instead of the level).

Walaa.  Instant target number through simple addition--and we still 
see an increase in the contribution of the skill to the character\'s 
success.


> But right now, we\'re just saying characteristics range from 1 to 15 and
> skills range from 1 to 6 (and we don\'t agree on that).

Yes.  Skill do range from 1-6.  This is why is should be damn hard 
for a character, straight out of chargen, to get level-9 skill.  But, 
that\'s another issue.

KBv2.0 puts the skill level and attribute on the same scale.  3 x 
skill level = approximate corresponding attribute level.

Average skill = 2

Average stat = 7

KBv2.0 Exerience for skill level 2 = 6

7 and 6 are approximate.

I agree with 50% of this.  We should leave attributes alone because 
they will change value due to wounds in combat.

Let\'s keep math to a minimum.  KBv2.0 does that by multiplying skill 
by 3.   This makes the scale of skills vs stats approximately the 
same.



Whatever the spreadsheets tell you, this example is why we should 
multiply skills to bring them up on par with stats.

From my "plea to Marc Miller", we have a Medical-1, Edu-A character 
and we have a Medical-4, Edu-6 character.

In your system, the target numbers are:

Med-1 guy:  TN 11
Med-4 guy:  TN 10

The inequity shows it self.

Now, in KBv2.0, the target numbers are:

Med-1 guy:  TN 13
Med-4 guy:  TN 18

We can see that skill counts for something--it\'s not all attribute 
dominated.

Hmmm.  I\'m afraid I\'m not familiar enough with David\'s sections to tell 
you what was done about changing law levels and so on, you might want to 
email him about that.  (Hey, we wrote this thing months ago.:)

As far as Resources, there is no way to change them.  They\'re an 
absolute.  Resources is the amount of material available on the planet 
(and, if you have sufficient tech, in the system itself - planetary 
belts, gas giants, etc.).  It\'s modified in the GWP calcs to end up with 
what you can get at, thus the .1*TL part of the equasion.

So, Resources is an absolute, like Size.  You can import Resources and 
use them in addition to the ones you can get at on your planet with your 
own technology.  You can get better at extracting the resources you have.  
You can use resources you never thought about using before.  (both of the 
preceding ones being a function of tech and infrastructure.)  But you can\'t 
change the amount of Resources native to the system.

	Please don\'t do the last! Take what input you feel is relevant and useful,
and come up with what you, as the designer, decide is the best. We\'re all
going to take the parts we like, and change the ones we don\'t, anyway ...

	Ideally, the first step would be to define the terms, and then present one
possible system. By getting some agreement on the basics, you allow people
to graft their own task system in fairly easily. Here\'s what I mean:

	Routine Task: This is the reference point for everything else. A person
with average characteristics and some training will usually be able to do
this. (translation: characteristic 7, skill 1 will succeed about
three-quarters of the time).

	Impossible Task: Success at an impossible task is a near-superhuman
occurrence, requiring either an incredibly lucky or extremely talented
individual (characteristic 11, skill 5 might have about 15-20% chance).

	Etc.

That may very well be the best solution that is possible under the 
circumstances.  Not all problems have neat solutions.  And there is long 
precedent in the wargaming and RPG industries for "beginner" and 
"advanced" rules.  Heck, CT itself was rife with them.

Are we ready to call of the search for the perfect solution to this 
problem?

Are we ready to agree that this is the best solution that can be found?

	1. Most Important, but it\'s written kind of confusing--the first sentence
implies skills weight too much ("too heavily *against* STATS"), but the
second states it correctly--skills need to count for more, or Traveller
degenerates into D&D, where you have the high-strength character (fighter),
the high-dex character (thief), the high-int character (mage), etc. Just
because a person has high dexterity DOESN\'T mean he/she should be good at
all dexterity-related tasks, because the training isn\'t necessarily there.

	2. Second most important--it ought to be a lot easier to screw up
spectacularly on an inherently difficult activity like walking a tightrope,
than on walking down to the mailbox.

	One additional comment--a task labelled "incredible" or "impossible" or
the like truly should be near-impossible for an "average" joe
(characteristic 7, skill-1) to accomplish. Succeeding at something
superhuman should require outstanding skill AND ability.

	The "meta-facts" were not presented as something the players discovered,
but were given to the referee as the "absolute truth." And, as a _referee_,
having the "true underlying facts" of a universe are important if I\'m going
to run adventures in that universe. I HAVE to know the facts around which
future adventures are going to be run, so that I can stay consistent.
Otherwise, I won\'t waste my time and money on the standard
universe--instead I\'ll either take the time to create my own or, more
likely given my lack of time, give up Traveller. That\'s what I hated about
the proposed fix to FS.

	Again, if something is being presented to me as Referee\'s Info, that info
must be rock solid. If I can\'t depend on it, it\'s worthless. The ambiguity
and differing interpretations can come in in the player\'s information, or
by leaving information out. But once you\'ve told me "Mr. Referee, this is
the real info you can use as needed to guide the adventure" don\'t change it.

	Whether you like the past information or not, and there are parts I\'m not
thrilled with, if you want my business, stay consistent with it.

I see where you\'re coming from, and that method does solve some 
problems. In my view, though, that\'s not the best solution.  And for two 
reasons:

1)  It makes the system less simple (figuring division and multiplication 
is bad enough, but figuring and refiguring on the fly during a fight as 
your stats decrease slows up the game too much, IMO).

2)  It changes the task statement as given in the Game Screen.

It solves the problem of stat and skill weighting, as so many other 
solutions do, but it introduces new problems.  I don\'t see it as a more 
ideal solution than the Game Screen system.

Just my opinion, mind, but that does reflect the terms I set up in the 
post to which you were responding.


Please allow me to wax philosophical for a moment.

The big leap that we all need to make, IMO, is keeping in mind that we\'re a 
tiny, tiny minority of the current Traveller players, and an even more 
miniscule minority of the universe of players Traveller must reach if it 
is to be the success it deserves to be.  We have a great amount of 
knowledge, and a great capacity for accepting hairy, complex systems.  
The customers that must be reached do not share that knowledge 
or capacity.  I don\'t think we will find the right system unless we keep 
that in mind.

The sad truth is, the RPG industry is suffering under a depression that 
has continued for many years, but it\'s a strange depression.  The 
audience is shrinking, but the purveyors of role-playing material are 
increasing.

The reason is that barriers to entry have fallen greatly over the last 
decade, with the availability of relatively inexpensive computers and 
programs that can yield professional pre-publishing results.  At the same 
time, the number and quality of substitute entertainments (computer 
games, video games, and even the Internet itself) have increased 
dramatically.  So, as the old-guard ages and moves on to other pursuits, 
such as full time jobs and family life, there aren\'t that many new 
players to replace them.  Thus, more RPG products and fewer to buy them.

If the industry doesn\'t reach out to people much better than it has, 
it\'ll all go the way of the wargame.  We have to rise above the other 
systems, show that Traveller is clearly the best choice...while keeping 
it simple enough to draw in every possible customer.

There\'s not a whole lot a tiny company like Imperium Games can do to 
reverse the downward trend in the RPG industry.  But three of the things 
they /can/ do are: have splashy covers (like T4 already has), keep the 
core rules simple enough for beginners to teach themselves how to play, 
and make the game fun enough that they\'ll want to continue playing.  
Well, there\'s a fourth, and that\'s distribution - distributing to book 
stores as well as game stores.  Perhaps someday Traveller will have the 
clout for that once again.  But first, it has to show that it is worthy.

As I explained in my previous post, the Task System will dictate the 
quality of Traveller to a very great degree.  If it\'s too difficult, no 
matter how well it models the real world, Traveller will fail.  If it is 
like T4\'s original system, with a very small chance of PC\'s failing tasks, 
it will fail as well - there will be no challenge to the game outside of 
the challenge of role-playing itself (which, of course, isn\'t something 
someone new to the hobby is going to be most interested in; that takes 
time). 

A balance has to be struck.  I think _we_ _can_ find that balance....but 
only if we keep in mind that we\'re not the ones this part of the product 
line should be aiming at.  Our products include Pocket Empires; Fire, 
Fusion, and Steel; and other, future products that will be as hairy as 
we want them to be. :)  The core system is for the beginners..so we can 
hook them and get them interested in the larger, more complex (and 
ultimately more enjoyable), universe of Traveller products and activities.

The Task System must be kept simple and robust, over all else, or we may 
as well admit defeat and go back to CT, MT, and TNE.

My last words of advice:  Keep the typical 14-year-old in mind as we go 
about finding solutions to the Great Task System Crisis of 1997.

Yup. It\'s great to have that hot sports car that can do 220 MPH with its 
turbo charged engine...but if the speed limit is 60 MPH, and the car\'s 
constantly in the shop...what\'s the point?  :)

Similarly, if a task system can handle everything under the sun, and 
models the real world with 99% acccuracy, but one must wade through pages 
of charts and text to find the precise procedure to be followed for the 
task at hand...again, what\'s the point?  The purpose of the game becomes 
task resolution, rather than adventuring.

You bet! :)  Stuffing a backpack full of 5-1/2 by 8-1/2 and 8-1/2 by 11 
books on every concievable subject, just to play four hours of 
Traveller...ahhh. :)

That was our first as well.  It was a new idea to me - whaddaya mean 
there\'s not four hundred DM\'s spread over three dozen charts to look up 
every time someone wants to do something?!?  :)  OTOH, I found the rules 
exceptions confusing, and never could get them all in my head.

Give this a 3, I think it should be harder to roll SF and SS as the

See the above. Give it a 3.

Hmmm, if you mean SF should be harder to roll on harder tasks, I disagree.
Give

    Good point!  But... In a situation where those tools, team support and the
like are not available.  The Skill should outweigh the Stat!  It doesn\'t right
now and that\'s part of the problem.

the medical SKILLS that can carry out the emergency operation with minimal if
any equipment.  The SKILL is the equalizer and enabler here.  Not the Stat.

    True enough, however the military will take in that clumsy person,
especially in times of war, and count on training IN SPECIFIC SKILLS to counter
the clumsiness.  Problem is the current Task System doesn\'t really account for
this.  It does make a mockery of the idea that any specific level in a skill
has any meaning though.
    FoEx; I\'ve been through marksmanship training and I\'m not a terribly
dexterious person.  I watched guys on the firing range pick up their weapons
and perform miracles of marksmanship that made the sargeants smile (a
particularly grim sight for a struggling recruit.)  They didn\'t need to
practice, I did, and I practiced every sunday.  In the end I met the Expert
standard, because I increased my Skill through Practice!
    The Skill indicates a specific level of ability in a specific range of
tasks.  Yes natural aptitude should have an effect.  But it\'s been proven time
and again that Sheer Dogged Persistance, Perseverance and Practice WILL level
the field.  And that\'s Skill.

    Fine, what in heaven\'s name does that have to do with actual use and

I\'ve had experiences where the Coach and Team are happy to get whomever
volunteers!  Is it a great team?  A good team??  OC not... In the begining.
But over time as they practice they get better.  It not unknown for such teams
to get so good they take regional, state and occassionally National
Championships.
    They must definately do not have the Attributes, they DO have the skills.

    Uhm... I would expect nothing less Marc.  This is rather like stating that
the value of the sun is that it shines during the day. ;)

    Yes, quite correct, however...  Traveller skills quite often state that at
_this or that level_ the possessor of the skill now possess specific ranges of
ability to do things.  The Medical-3 springs to mind as a perfect example here.
A Doctor requires a decade or so of training and can do a rather marvelous
range of things.  Yet the Traveller system can easily devalue that if the
Doctor has a low Attribute and some Medical-1 has a High Attribute.

    ::chuckle::  You certain you haven\'t developed Diplomacy 5+ lately?! <grin>
Perhaps you should look at the idea of decoupling specific abilities from
specific skill levels and make it available at certain Stat + Skill scores.
    FoEx; Being a Doctor ceases to be Medical-3, but Int + Med = 10.  (ie.
Intelligence average is 7 plus the now traditional Medical 3)

Well one of the things I like about task systems like that in MT or TNE
(where you make the same die role regardless of difficulty) is that hyou
can have players make a roll and tell you the difficulty that they
made,without having to reveal the difficulty necessary - thus preserving
some secrecy from the players.

You don\'t have much experience with munchkins, do you? A true munchkin
would only roll on the physical and mental development tables until they
get a UPP of FFFFF7 (munchkins don\'t care about social standing). When they
start playing, they probe the referee to see what the adventure will be
about (assuming the ref designed the adventure; if it\'s a published
adventure he buys the book). Then, supposing the adventure will require
medical and gun skill, our hero takes a St. John\'s correspondence course to
get Medic-1 and gets an FAC certificate at a gun club. Our brave traveller
now faces the world with a target number of 16 in every important skill.

The problem, to me anyway, is that the Referee\'s Companion talks about
the TLs achieved by the various empires, which implies (again, to me)
that it\'s talking about pretty much the highest TL reached. Besides I
don\'t buy the notion of military tech 2 levels over the RoM\'s standard
max not being used by the RoM\'s Navy.

That\'s another problem - if the Syleans are finding TL14 relics, even 
in only small quantities why did it take them until 300 to get to 
TL13 and 700 to get to TL14? That\'s at least as long as the RoM existed, 
and the Syleans have these relics to help them.

However the biggest hurdle is that the new 3rd Imperium is expanding 
into old Vilani space, and I can\'t see how any of their worlds 
would\'ve been able to provide the climate for innovation and TL 
advancement. The high TL worlds (and thus the relics) will be in the 
areas the Terrans settled, and mostly around Earth.

Mind you, I think that the canon history has Vilani culture embrace 
TL progress far too readily, and badly under estimates the value of 
espionage and reverse engineering in keeping up with your neighbours 
- - in 1100 both the Solomani and the Zhodani somehow stay 1TL behind 
the Imperium, even though there are millions of TL15 Traders and 
Scout ships that can be purchased or stolen and disassembled.

Hm, well, I don\'t know if I\'d go so far as to say that "staples of
literature reflect reality". "Fear the unknown, especially people
from outside your social group" is a staple of literature, but 
I wouldn\'t say it\'s a good way to live your life. That\'s neither
her nor there though.

stats dominate, so much as that without a high stat, you\'ll 
never attain high skill. That\'s how I look at it anyways.
Someone with Dex-6 will never, ever attain Archery-10. It
just doesn\'t happen. Now, someone with Dex-14 could attain
Archery-10, sure. But don\'t expect them to do as well at 
basketball as they do at archery.

If I had to pick a house rule, I\'d say that no skill can 
ever be higher than half or two-thirds (or something) of
the skill\'s controlling stat. ie. Someone with Edu-6 could
get a maximum of Law-3. I mean, you could be less educated 
than average and still be a professional lawyer. To be
a real crack lawyer, you\'d need a higher EDU. So, someone
who had been to college, Edu-A or B, could, if they
studied law a lot, have Law-5.

Anyways, that\'s my take on reality.

Hm, well, I dunno about age or youth, but I think it\'s
unfair that having a high stat like DEX improves your 
chances at performing 26 different skills, while
having a high skill level improves your chances at
doing only one. Weenie min-maxers will throw for or
pick stat increases over skills every time, which
makes for unintersting characters.

I like the three ones/sixes idea.. makes it immediately apparent whether

I would like to point out at this juncture that from my real world
experience, most doctors aren\'t surgeons, and most surgeons don\'t do
anything but surgery.

In my case, my oncologist has a high INT and EDU, and about Medical-6.  His
ability is in diagnosing and prescribing the treatment of cancers.. when I
had my laparotomy, my surgeon was a specialist in abdominal surgery.

The proverbial DEX-11, Med-1 field medic may not know what to do when
presented with a patient who is suffering from painful seizures, an
enlarged spleen, and bizarre blood counts, if his EDU is only 5 or 6.  If
he has a high EDU, he may indeed know what is going on, tell a doctor, and
save the day!

If the surgeon spends extra time, has prepared, has the support of the
surgical team, is using good tools, etc..  the chances of sucess go way up.
 Dr. Gregg told me about the time he had to perform appendectomy on the
golf course; he said he never worked so hard in his life, or missed the
operating room quote so much.

I\'d use EDU myself.. I know plenty of nurses with a command of medical
knowledge that rivals (or eceeds) that of the doctors on staff.

In a an adventure I\'m working on, the Vargr are TL 9/10.  Their ships are
mostly fusion rockets armed with HE missles and weak (by Imperial

Yes, but we are the most dedicated Traveller players in the world.  
If you are a Traveller fanatic, and you have a computer, chances are 
you are here on the TML.

I think that if we are pleased, then the chances are that most of the 
occasional Traveller players out there will be pleased as well.

Nonsense.  KBv2.0 is completely simple.  It\'s a little more complex 
than T4.1 as is, but I\'d rank it in the same category with the MT 
task system, and that was pretty simple.

Besides, if you play RPGs, you\'d expect some complexity.

 Ummmm, I don\'t think so.  More likely, it was from the way such

 Somebody undoubtedly went from there - "what\'s an insulting

Fair enough.  It just doesn\'t strike me as all that difficult to come up
with a number between 1 and 366.  Of course, it\'s been a few years since I
was 12-16 years old. ;->

No, Joe. Not yet. I know there are good economic reasons for wanting to

I worked up some spreadsheets this afternoon illustrating what you are
talking about.  The STAT forms a base of, let\'s say 18%, that contributes
to any Target Number.  The Skill climbs the curve (the curve is important
here) contibuting what ends up being the bulk of the total for a Target
Number.  I\'m a lot happier about the straight STAT+Skill method now.

There is still a problem when the Stat gets into double digits.  Then the
base for Target Numbers starts too high.  That\'s the DEX 11 and EDU 12
problem we\'ve been complaining about.  All I can say is an effort should be
made to keep 11+ Characteristics *very* rare!  

This bumps up against what you want to do with EDU, Marc.  If you don\'t
inflate EDU due to schooling...and in fact make raising *any*
characteristic rare and expensive I\'ll withdraw my objection to Stat+Skill
completely.  (Not my objection to the 1/2 die though. It should still go.
<g>)

Example of an Average Characteristic (7) and Skills ranging from 1 to 12. 
I know Skills aren\'t supposed to get that high, but it did it for
completeness, and liked what I was getting.

You\'ll notice I dropped the 1/2 die.  <g> I like the numbers I\'m getting
here, but maybe the *average* number of levels for a skill needs to go up a
little.  Rather than 1 to 4 with 2 being average, I think we might want to
go to 1 to 8 with 4 being average.  

How do you get the higher average skill numbers?  Either give out *lots*
more skills, or give 2 points/gain...I think I\'d vote for lots more skills. 
Maybe as many as 8 per term, that would be 1 skill each 6 months..or in
educational terms 1 skill level per 2 semesters.

Look at the numbers I sent out tonight *without* the 1/2 die.  The numbers
for Routine and Impossible tasks hit your suggested targets within a couple
of percent. 

I\'ve decided that Stat+Skill *will* work, but we have to drop the 1/2 die
and get used to giving out even *more* skills per term.  Maybe not 8/term,
though.  Now that I look at the numbers, I think 6/term might do it.  I
also think we\'re all going to have trouble with any CharGen process that
allows characteristics of 10+ to become common.

Well, I guess I simply don\'t agree.  I\'m a scientist and I\'ve seen

for years.

A minumum of training.  It may be that the task system could use
an attibute based standard also...

I\'m not sure you you come to a target number of 13 being "twice"
as good as a 10.  In any case, Dex 7 is such a clutz I wouldn\'t
be suprised if he didn\'t mess up most of the time.

Clearly we disagree.

I don\'t see how.  If you make skills high the GM needs to generate
high skill NPC\'s.  The opposition always has to be consistent
with how the PC\'s are made up.

I don\'t see this at all.  If you make skills more important, then
powergamers will just go that way.  And I have yet to see anything
about how the current task system makes players fiddle the rolls.

Well, the problem is that stats are randomly generated.  I prefer
pointed based system for this reason.  I just don\'t see randomly
generating a number and then having to demphasis it because it
is random as the best way to go.  But then some people prefer
a measure of radomness in character creation and it is Traveller\'s
historic approach.

Ah, yes!  After doing all my number crunching today, I\'ve come to the
conclusion that inflated Characteristics and that darn 1/2 die are what are
messing up everything.  ;->

Let\'s change the "physical and mental developement tables" to squash this
road to Munchkinastan!

Proposal 1:  No Characterictic can be advanced beyond 12.  Additionally, to
advance a Characteristic requires successfully completing a roll on 2d6
equal or higher than your current level, examples..DEX=7, roll 7+ to
advance one level; EDU=11, roll 11+ to advance to the ultimate level.

    Reasoning:  Charactistics are the base of many skills, and represent
    the basic nature of the PC.  They should be increasingly difficult
    to advance, and only under the most exceptional circumstances should
    they exceed the normalized human maximum of 12.  
    
Proposal 2:  Change the Task Difficulty Levels to the following...

              1d6  Simple
              2d6  Average (or my preference, Routine)
              3d6  Difficult
              4d6  Formidable
              5d6  Staggering
              6d6  Impossible (or my preference, Hopeless)
              
    Reasoning:  The numbers given by (Characteristic+Skill) Target
    Numbers work well with this range of difficulties.  It eliminates
    the 1/2 die, and that will make *many* people happy.  It also fits
    well with the Char+Skill methodoligy.  I know some people will be
    unhappy with 6 dice, but "Impossible" tasks should be relatively
    rare.
    
Proposal 3: Base the Target Number on Char+Skill+DM\'s.

    Reasoning:  This is simple, and after analysis does value Skills
    more than Stats, as long as the Stats don\'t routinely exceed 10.
    This also does least damage to compatability between T41 and T4.

Proposal 4:  Change Character Generation to increase the number of skills
earned each term.  I\'m unsure of exactly how much the increase should be,
but as a first cut, I propose...6 skills per term.  These 6 skills might be
allocated as (Career related..1/year plus 2/term Free Choice).

    Reasoning:  Adding additional skills balances the slightly more
    difficult Task Difficulties without resorting to multiplying or
    dividing anything.  Frankly, every player in the world likes *more*
    skills and higher levels in the ones they have, and making the
    players happy is good for business.  ;-> This isn\'t a proposal, but
    some sort of cap on Skill Levels, like that on Characteristics might
    also be in order...I\'m just not sure about that.


What do you think?

You are comparing absolute values again.  I just don\'t agree
with this approach.  The fact is that skills run from 0 and
stats run from 2.  Additionally, low stats are rarer and hence
the effective lower level has to adjusted for the fact that
stats are non-linear.  100% of the characters start at a
skill of 0.  Only 2.8% of them start at a stat of 2.

>This is not true. As I pointed out in my earlier post, the two are
>substantially different. Skills typically have a range of 2 or 3 points.

Um no, skills can go up to 6 at least, for a range of 7.

Each _task roll_ has a comparable input from stat and skill.
The _task system_ does have the same usage.  Now it can be
pointed out that a stat is a more fundamental attribute, and
so should be harder to get in character generation.  I agree
with this.  But the fact is that, for me at least, the equal
input of stat and skill into the task resolution is realistic.

>First of all, it is not valid to compare a "common" characteristic with a
>skill you are "concentrating on"; you should compare typical
>characteristics and skills or ones that are both being "concentrated on".

Well, this is even more complicated.  Noone should realistically
try concentration on a career that they are inept at (ie have
a low stat).  That means that saying the range of stats in
that case goes down to 2 is even more unrealistic.

>It is quite easy to get a characteristic of 14 if you "concentrate" on it,
>especially Education using the T4 rules.

I have agree that you shouldn\'t be able to get stats as easily
as skills.  If you make it difficult to get stats you will
have (as I pointed out in my earlier posts) people rolling
stats that cluster mostly around 5-9 with characters raising
them a step or two.

Um, was specifically talking about mechanic outside of the task
system.  I have looked at he task system and I simply don\'t believe
it emphasises stats too much.

>>As I pointed out in my other post. They are equally weighted.

Just to be accurate.  It isn\'t correct _in your opinion_.
I stand by what I\'ve said.  If you believe it to be incorrect
you are free to point why.

>Skills and
>characteristics are not even close to being "evenly weighted". The average
>characteristic is about 4 times that of the average skill.

As I said.  It\'s not the absolute value.  That is irrelevant.
If stats that range from 100-120 and skills range from 0-20
you _can_ add them together and have them equally important.

>Characteristics
>typically vary by 10 or more points than skills.

I\'m sorry, but stats do not _typically_ vary over the
whole range.  It\'s a bell curve.  The extreme ends are
rare.

>I am actually quite confused on what you base your assertions that the

Right, and since rolls like a 2-4, or 10-12 are hard to get it
reduces the effective range of stats.  It is pointless to
worry about a number that only affect 2 or 3 stats out
of a hunderd.

I\'m sorry.  The question of whether the alternate system do over
emphasis skills _is_ in dispute and _is_ germane to the issue.
Additionally, this is a counter to a claim that _has_ been put
forward against the current task system.  If this is not a
point you want to address, then I suggest you just don\'t
address it.

   Here\'s the problem: doing something (changing a tire, performing
surgery, engaging in a aerial dogfight, shooting at a 25 meter target)
can be made so complex in a game so as to make doing anything in a
reasonable amount of time impossible.  No one wants a game in which just
landing your ship, walking through the starport and engaging in
conversation at the local pub takes all evening (real time).

   Fact is, that when you are dealing with physically-oriented skills
(playing basketball, boxing, etc.) physical attributes are just as
important (sometimes even more so) than skill level.  Otherwise the best
baseball/football players would all be over 35.  When you look at an
athlete at the professional level over that is over age 35, you find
someone who has maintained himself physically (extra workouts, better
diet), and/or someone who has managed to replace "points" lost off his
physical stats with "points" of skill.

   Declaring in mentally-oriented skills (History, Research, etc.) that
skill level is more important than relevant attribute (INT or EDU) is
debatable at best, but let\'s go ahead and conceed the point.  Now, how
do we formulate task resolution?  Using the physically-oriented skills
model (skill level equal in importance to relevant attribute) or the
mentally-oriented skill model (skill level greater importance than
relevent attribute)?  Using more than one method makes task resolution
confusing IMHO. As the physical model is easier to justify than the
mental model (again IMHO), as imperfect as you might think it is, using
a system in which skill points equal attribute points is the better way
to go.

   Surgery as a skill could be argued as being under Education just as
well as Dexterity.  However, you would be made just as nervous by a
clumsy surgeon who knew a great deal about surgery as you would a
surgeon who could carve Gothic letters on your spleen but couldn\'t tell
you the proper procedure for removing one.  *For purposes of
simplicity*, only one attribute is used, in this case dexterity.

[Oh God not another proposed task resolution fix...]

   If you wanted to make things a bit more realistic, then *some* skills
should use an average of two attributes.  Surgery for example: Dr.
William Kildare is a brilliant young surgeon, who has the physical gifts
to be a great surgeon one day, but isn\'t there quite yet (Surgery-2,
Dex-12, Edu-8).  Using the current TNE/T4 system of Dex+skill would
yield a number of 14, where as a revised system [((12+8)/2)+skill] would
yield a number of 12.  That lowers the chances of success somewhat, and
adds a bit more emphasis on skill in certain situations.  This system
would be easier to use than any others I\'ve seen proposed thus far
(unless somebody came up with something while I was away), and can be
easier to justify than the current system.  For example, Dr. Kildare\'s
twin brother Bob is just as dexterous as his brother (Dex-12) but he
spent his evenings and weekends hitting the books instead of out getting
drunk/pissed (Edu-12), unlike his brother.  Dr. Bob Kildare has an equal
amount of surgery skill as his brother (Surgery-2), but because he has
far more book knowledge than his brother William, he\'s a better surgeon
[((12+12)/2+skill)=14].  I would trust him to find my spleen, and take
out with competantly.

   Marc, task systems in general work, so long as they don\'t get bogged
down with too many modifiers, odd dice or too much math--I see no reason
to drop the idea.  The current T4 system doesn\'t work so well IMHO
because of the insistence on a modified D6 system.  Back when a D20 was
used under TNE, there simply wasn\'t the level of problems now associated
with using the skill+attribute system.

   Using AOL for anything generally acts as a severe negative modifier
against success.  :-)  No question that "environmental factors" can act
in a positive or negative manner on your chances of success.  I think
that people try to keep the modifiers to a minimum, since it tends to
slow down the pace of the game.  Having a consolidated chart of the most
common modifiers would be something that people could really use.

   Something I\'ve seen in Star Wars and would make a nice addition would
be to include some kind of modifier for teamwork.  TNE doesn\'t have one,
nor does any other version of Traveller (at least none that come to
mind).

   There has to be a degree of player (and referee) self control here. 
Yes, it\'s possible that a Scout character could do the self-study thing
and end up with a high EDU attribute, but a pirate is unlikely to spend
much time hitting the books.  Players need to define what kind of
character they want to run before they start the generation process, and
then the referee needs to enforce it.  The Universe is not going to
consist of a bunch of PhDs (or equivalents) running around shooting at
each other.

Well, sort of.  I\'m saying they are both important.  To be
the best in your field is an equal mixture of talent and
dedications.  Guys in the NBA are both amazingly talented
_and_ spend hours at it.  They should be better than both
people with just talent and just training.

I don\'t agree it\'s "unfair".  Some people are just
better at alot of things than others.  I do agree
that in game terms a stat increase should be harder
to get than a skill increase.  But that is character
generation issue.

I\'m not a scientist..I just play one on TV <g>..but seriously, what you are
seeing is the enternal battle between the "Young Turks" and the "Old
Fossils."  You can see it taking place in *any* organization from
government, to military, to Universities.

It isn\'t that the "new people" are more talented or better trained, it\'s
just that they are more *recently* trained and MUCH hungrier.  The "old
boys" have already made their waves, secured their positions and don\'t want
these kids rocking their boats.  The "Turks" just *know* how much better
they are, and they are only too willing to show it, and they have to or
they won\'t ever get one of this comfortable positions.  They better be
careful though, because if they push the "fossils" hard enough they might
rouse from their comfortable slumber and kick the "whippersnapper\'s" butts. 
;->

Maybe, we should model the strong possiblity of having 1 year of real skill
growth (Skill-1)...repeated 20 times in a career.  ;-> 

Look around and tell me you don\'t see it.  People who have been at the job
for 20 years, but their last real increase in skill was the year they
arrived.  People who had some *real* skill "on the line", "in the field",
but who got "promoted" to management/administration and have lost the edge
off of the skills that got them promoted in the first place.

Marc said he doesn\'t like the idea of a 0 skill increase, but believe you
me that happens.

   My players have learned through hard experience that if they want to
be superheroes, they will have to face supervillians (badguys will equal
stats).  As for adventures (Nick, you can stop reading this message
now), frequently *I* don\'t know where the story is going to go next
session, let alone my players.  I love to improvise things on the spot
and go with what ever the players throw at me.  This means that they
literally have no clue what I\'m doing behind the Referee\'s Screen, which
is the way it ought be.  Predictability is fatal to a referee.

   Favorite referee torture device: finding a player that has killer
stats and then placing him or her in a position where those stats are
meaningless.  This can involve stranding a ground pounder on a broken
spaceship, taking a space combat expert and forcing him to survive a
firefight on the ground, or forcing a group of "shoot first and ask
questions later" PCs to look for clues to a mystery on a planet where
they can\'t carry any guns (or their guns won\'t save them).  Being in
charge is a *good* thing....

Harold, I would suggest that surgury would be a case where you\'d want to
break the task into several parts, forex:

 To diagnosis the medical problem; 
 (INT+Medical) + (Medical Database)DM + (Diagnositic Equipment)DM <
 Difficult, 30min.
 
 To plan the proper surgical procedure;
 (EDU+Medical..Admin/2 may substitute)  < Difficult, 120min.
 
 To repair the heart valve;
 (DEX+Medical) +/ (Operating Theatre/appliances)DM + (Surgical Team)DM <
 Formidable, 90min, Fateful.
 
...or something similar.  We wouldn\'t do this for *ever* task, but I do
diagnosis problem, solve problem tasks with different characteristics all
the time.

BTW, in the above series of tasks, you\'d want the *smart*, but sort of
clumsy internist diagnosing and setting up the operation, but your want the
*very* dexterious surgeon and her *highly* trained TEAM actually opening
your chest...and that\'s how it works too.  ;->

automatic successes based on skill level.  Both CORPS and Conspiracy X use
this system to great effect.  The basic idea is that for a sufficient
level of skill there are tasks which are easy enough that the PC does not
need to roll to succeed. 

In the game Conspiracy X, Skills are rated 1 (novice) to 5 (world-class
expert). Tasks are also rated 1 (Easy) to 5 (Impossible).  If the PC\'s
skill level exceeds the rating of the task then the PC can automatically
succeed at the task w/o rolling. 

This could be adopted for T4.1.  For a first approximation, how about this:

Skill Level:	Tasks which automatically succeed

1		Easy
2		Easy
3		Average
4		Average
5		Difficult
6		Difficult

I don\'t believe skill elves should exceed 6, so I\'m not extending the
table beyond this.  This type of system would help to reassert the
importance of high skill levels. 

Comments?

chalk me up as against the multiple dice versus att+skill method, and even
tying skills directly to a single attribute.

rationale:

a good pilot prepping a course for n-space hohman transfer orbits shouldn\'t
be using dex, but int. Maneuvering in combat should be dex.

the variable dice for difficulty just doesn\'t mesh with the compressed
skill levels and attribute scale well.

In the UK, the Babylon Project has cleared this hurdle and is available in
WH Smiths (one of the bigger bookstores) with the other Titan Books stuff
like Sandman. Haven\'t seen this since Fighting Fantasy and Dragon

So? The system I was suggesting it as an alternative to used 2d6-2 to

Point 1 - 1
Point 2 - 0 (Not relevant in light of points 3 and 4)
Point 3 - 3
Point 4 - 4 (It should be easier to roll SF when the task gets hard)
Point 5 - 2 (See Point 6 below)

=====
6. All tasks should all be rolled on the same number of dice (2 or 3).
=====

I\'ve always personally loathed the notion of hauling around a bag of dice to
resolve game uncertainties. That was the beauty of Traveller in 1980 when I
started playing - you only needed D6\'s, and only about 4-6 of them if you weren\'t
hauling around grenade launchers or PGMP\'s. Rolling all those dice for a task
just rankles.

Of course, the other advantage of being a "mid-old" gamer is that I feel perfectly
comfortable running house rules that quietly ignore the canon...

This may be throwing oil on the fire, but \'artificially intelligent\' and
\'expert system\' are not the same thing. At tech level 12, an \'expert system\'
could be basis for a robotic operating system that, to the average person,
would make the robot seem intelligent. Household and valet duties would be
potentially within the range of an expert system. Today\'s cruise missiles
are run by \'expert systems\' in piloting & navigation. 

May not be errata, just an imprecise selection of terminology.

I wouldn\'t consider abandoning any kind of task system; maybe shifting from
\'rules\' to \'guidelines\' such that each GM & group could evolve something
that would work for them. People that have never been RPGers will need
something to help them determine what to do, but the more experienced
players & GMs should not be shackled by one size fits all rules. How about a
\'basic\' guideline with optional \'advanced\' sections for the skills over
attributes folks, and others for the attributes over skills folks.

I think this is a good idea.

here\'s *my* addition :-)

Make Target Number equal to Stat+DMs.

Skill determines what difficulty level, but does nothing for target
number (alternately you could add in in again as a DM, I\'d need to
look at the numbers).

Personally I look at the task and say to myself "What skill level
person does this routinely?"  Whatever that skill is has an Average
task.  Add or subtract from the difficulty level depending on
whether the skill level is above or below this number.

SS might be either rolling dice code plus skill, or perhaps just
skill or even just Stat.

SF is trickier since I\'d want increased diff level to increase SF.

That\'s the whole task system.

Ex:  A bright guy (Int 12) learned a little about explosives in the
military (Demolitions-1).  A business is planning on destroying a
building in place in a crowded city so it doesn\'t damage anthing
nearby.  This task is normally done by extremely skilled explosives
experts (Demo-4).  A demo-4 guy would have an Ave task (2d6) so our
guy has it 3 diff levels harder than Ave----Staggering.

Our bright guy with a little explosives skill has  to roll a 12 or
less on 5d6.  And Average explosives expert (Int 7, Demo-4) has to
roll a 7 or less on 2d6.

[the only problem I might address is that Routine should really
equal Easy since it implies that you do it right all the time]

I think KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is extremely important.  I
think the idea of doing to much (any, actually) math on the skills
attributes is too complicated (whay make a Char Gen system that produces
skill levels that you end up converting to something else and necer
useing?).

Because, #$@%^!$@ IT, finding a few TL-14 relics does _not_ mean that you
can take them and press on to TL-14 right away. Finding a TL-14 Vaccsuit
isn\'t going to help you make TL-14 computers, or Jump 4, or a lighter
Gauss rifle, or a PGMP, after all.

Here\'s where the TL systems is being abused...the TL of an ITEM does NOT
mean that the overall TL of that region is the same!

Espionage and reverse engineering are only minor factors of TL
determination...if they were all that counted, China, for instance would
be the same TL as the US, which they manifestly are not.

TL is determined more by resources and economics than anything else, or
else FOEX, Earth would be TL8 throughout, instead of a probable average of
about 4 or 5, or even less.

So what if I can disassemble a TL-15 scoutship...I can go to outer
Mongolia, and disassemble a PC, and maybe even figure out how it works,
but I\'m not going to be making more any time soon! If I can\'t make the
parts to make the tools to make the factories to make the ships,. I\'m
screwed! Having a finished product only gives me hints of the
infrastructure needed to make the thing.

Espionage and reverse engineering will only work if the two parties are
separated by one TL at most, and it\'ll be very hard then, they work best
at getting secrets from places with the same TL. 

Don\'t forget, in 1100 the Solomani had just fought a punishing war with
the Imperium, and lost their capital. From all accounts the Solomani
sphere was also a widely varied place, and much of their resources had
been focused to rimward...we don\'t KNOW what the TL of the far rimward
Solomani sphere was, only the TL of their military during the rebellion.

The Zhodani are working very hard to appear to be a threat enough to the
Imperium to keep them from invading, but not enough of a threat to provoke
them into doing so. On TL (on the surface) behind the Imperium makes them
a nasty place to invade, but unlikely to be a huge threat. Most of their
attentions, after all were really on the Core Expeditions, all that the
Imperium ever saw of the Zhodani sphere was their frontier regions.

   There have never been meta-facts in Traveller.  The entire gaming
   philosophy behind Traveller background has always been since day one
   that nothing is as it seems on the surface.  Beneath the surface, the
   real truth has often been presented in adventures and background as
   being ambiguous ---- the referee has free reign to interpret the data
   as he pleases, or better yet, not to interpret the data, but keep the
   players hanging.  

   There have been some exceptions to this method of presentation. 
   `Secret of the Ancients\' presented historical data without reserve as
   being true, and  the old CT Library Data presented the concept of
   Major Races as being well defined, but then later revelations showed
   that the Aslan, and possibly other major races, did not fit these
   well-defined criteria.  This is one example of a `meta-fact\' that
   wasn\'t.  There are CERTAINLY others.

   Ambiguity does not make information worthless.  The background
   presented by canon makes an excellent jumping-off point for
   adventures ---- remember, that\'s the sole reason we have a canon,
   adventures!  Canon makes for good adventures when the data it gives
   are true, and often makes for even better ones when the data it gives
   are false.  This is true for the player\'s information, and even more
   true for the referee\'s.

   One of the things I always enjoyed about CT was that the canon
   allowed me, a referee, to `adventure\' just by reading the rumors,
   information, and Library Data and trying to puzzle what was in store
   for the Traveller Universe.  I certainly hope that T4 products will
   do the same.  I haven\'t seen Anomolies yet, but already this talk of
   `tech level\' (now that\'s an artificial construct if I\'ve ever seen
   one) being violated has already got me scheming and planning up ways
   to rock my players\' world!  And I\'m tingling with anticipation to see
   how the next generation of adventure writers will rock mine.

Also, look inside the covers of the T4 books, in the credits,
acknoledgements, and playtesters, you will see an astonishingly high
number of TML members. We may be a tiny tiny minority, but we have a large
impact on the game...mostly because we are the vocal and accessible tiny
minority. Marc, forinstance, can\'t easily ask 300 or so NON-TML\'ers for
their opinion on Monday, and have nearly 100 replies by Wednesday, now can
he?

I also think, to a great extent, we\'re underestimating these hypothetical
14-year olds who are buying these hypothetical RPG\'s...they\'re not, as a
rule stupid or unable to grasp complex rules...if they were, they wouldn\'t
be buying RPG\'s in the first place...

In the Tech Level chart in CT\'s Charts and Tables book, hot air

Hmmm I was thinking of a TL 2 \'Air Clan\' who travel around, at the mercy
of the wind from place to place, and stuff just sort of haphazardly gets
around...could make for some really odd diffusion of technology.

No, swamp gas is methane. Hydrogen was discovered when Joseph Priestly

that was generated.

They could be, but you had better carry your Master Smith and all his

non-interchangeable parts are great when you don\'t travel more than a
few day\'s journey away from your manufacturing base.

Put KBv2 in JTAS. Putting 2 systems in the rules will confuse newbies; 
people who read JTAS are less likely to be confused by something like that.

    'body' => 'One of the main objections to task systems where stats are divided by some
number is the difficulty and trouble of doing so during combat as the PC
is injured.  Given that the stat could have up to 3 or 4 values during the
combat if the PC is hit several times this may be a valid argument. 

How about this rule: The contribution of statistics to tasks is not
refigured until after the combat where the statistic was lowered is over.
(ie if Maya has a Dex of 8, and takes 4 points to her Dex, reducing it to
4, she is still rolling vs. a Dex of 8 until the combat is over.  Once
that combat is over, she is using her current Dex of 4 until she has had a
chance to heal. 

Reasons: 

1) Ease of play, no math is needed until the players have a chance to
relax and refigure things, after combat is over. 

2) Realism:  Your first thought may be "Sure this system is easy, but it\'s
totally unrealistic."  I disagree, given what I\'ve heard about the affects
of adrenaline during combat this rule seems *very* realistic.  There are
many stories of folks in combat running on broken legs, and even fighting
(for a short time) while riddled with bullets.  However, once the combat
is over they realize how badly they are hurt and suddenly feel the pain
and injury their bodies have been blocking. 

So, how about making divided stat task systems much easier to use.

If I remember from FFS version 1.1 some of these developments also depend 
on the gravity and air pressure that the aircraft/airships will be 
working in, lower air pressure than earth means larger props ergo larger 
engines, however lower gravity means its easier to get up into the air.

Don\'t shoot me for a traitor, because I\'m trying for a compromise position
on TML, but please don\'t ignore me either.

Ken, as you know, I thought the tripling of skills by KB2 was too much, and
I didn\'t like going halfway on the Skill Levels vs Skill Points.  I was for
ditching Levels entirely and just giving 2 or 3 experience points for each
gain, if we were going that route, remember?  ;->

Marc, as you know, I don\'t like the 1/2 die..never have, but I got used to
them in T4.  However, with only a *single* 1/2 in T41 the system just
*grates*, it\'s inelegant and it\'s not as simple as it *could* be.  Yes, I
know the jump from Average/Routine to Difficult is big, but that\'s as it
should be...and actually encourages the player to look for aids to provide
DM\'s as tasks get harder faster.

Well, I *think* my proposal will combine the realism of KB2 and the
simplicity of T41, and with a few changes to character generation give us a
set of Target Numbers and a Task System we\'ll like.

Flat Stat+Skill *does* weight the skill more heavily than I thought it did
due to the nature of the bell curves.  So, for simplicity I\'d like to find
a way to make it flat Stat+Skill work.  It *will* work, as long as the Stat
forming the flat base isn\'t too high, and too high looks like 13+ to me and
it\'s worse with lower numbers of dice (at 13, the Stat contributes 83% on
3d and 44% on 4d..we aren\'t going to do much about the 3d, but for 4d and
above I\'d like to keep the base below 1/3). The best way to do this is to
keep Stat levels from commonly inflating into double digits.  Put a cap of
12 on them, and make it much harder to increase a high Stat than a low
Stat.  Let the player and GM negotiate the "purchase" or "award" of
temporary or artificially created Stat DM\'s to raise them (even above 12)
in game play, but don\'t hand out 11\'s and 12\'s like candy to
everybody...and T4/T41 does that.  Marc, your experience might not indicate
that, but mine does.

I also want to get rid of the 1/2 die..this ones for ME.  ;-> The half die
doesn\'t seem to ring other people\'s bells like it does mine, but the
majority of people have said they\'d *like* to see it gone.  The game is
simpler without it, more elegant, and the numbers actually work better,
IMO.  Using whole dice gives us one more die..6 rather than 5..that\'s not
so bad, and it also makes Impossible/Hopeless tasks *virtually*
impossible..that\'s not so bad either.  However, Hopeless tasks might be a
little *too* impossible so let\'s increase the Skill Levels..at little, but
not too much.

We could use some technique to double the skills (not triple..that\'s too
much for Staggering and *really* Hopeless tasks) or increase the number of
skills players get during CharGen. For simplicity, I\'m for increasing the
number of skills.  If we don\'t increase the Target Number\'s to *quite* the
number as might seem right, it also encourages the addition of DM\'s for
Tools, Teams, and so on...and Marc it seems you *like* that.

This means changing CharGen in two ways:  putting the Cap on Stats (I
suggest rolling above your current Stat on a 2d6 to improve..and if the
player wastes a skill roll trying, then tough...life\'s tough.  Instead of
giving automatic EDU bonuses for completing advanced schooling give some
additional skill rolls or maybe automatic increases in skills like
Research, Perception, or Instruction.), and increasing the number of Skills
(I suggest increasing the number of "childhood/background" skills by 3 or 4
and giving 6 skills/term rather than 4.  The 6 could be 4 career oriented
and 2 free choice.)

These changes are minimal, easy to implement, don\'t violate the feel of
Traveller, and give Target Numbers I think can live with.

    'body' => 'OK, here\'s my entry into the fray.  It has the advantage of being *very*
simple and requires a minimum of die rolling. 

All rolls are on 2D6, with the goal being to roll high.  Statistic
modifiers to the tasks are given below. 

Note: For simplicity I\'m using the old MT task divisions which eliminate
Staggering tasks

Skill	Tasks Performed Automatically	Rolls for other Tasks

0	None				Easy 9+, Average 13+
1	Easy Tasks			Average 9+, Difficult 13+
2	Easy & Average Tasks 		Difficult 9+, Formidable 13+
3	Easy & Average Tasks		Difficult 9+, Formidable 13+
4	Easy, Avg., & Difficult Tasks	Formidable 9+, Impossible 13+
5	Easy, Avg., & Difficult Tasks   Formidable 9+, Impossible 13+
6	E, A, Diff & Formidable Tasks	Impossible 9+

This system is not designed to work with Task levels above 7, but it\'s
easy to make 6 or 7 the maximum possible skill level (Six makes the most
sense in Traveller).  You simply state "all Skill levels go from 1
(novice) to 6 (world class expert)

You subtract Stat/3 from the difficulty of all tasks and then roll.

Stat	Modifier
0-2	0
3-5	-1
6-8	-2
9-11	-3
12-14	-4
15+	-5

For example, if a PC with a skill level of 2 and a stat of 10 is
attempting a Difficult Task you look at the two tables and add -3 (the
stat modifier) to 9 (the task difficulty).  The PC must roll 6+ (9-3) to
succeed at a Difficult task.  The same PC, using the same skill, would 
need to roll a 10+ (13-3) to succeed at a Formidable Task. 

Modifications:  With minor modifications this system could include 
Staggering tasks too.  Also, the numbers could be modified so that
you could use Stat/4 or Stat/5 instead of Stat/3

For example, if you want to use Stat/5 you simply lower the Task 
difficulties from 9+ & 13+ to 8+ & 12+ then you subtract Stat/3

Stat	Modifier
0-4	0
5-9	-1
10-14	-2
15+	-3

Note that this system does have one obvious consequence, any character 
needs a minimum skill level to attempt certain tasks.  If you only have a 
skill level of 1 you can\'t even attempt Formidable or harder tasks.  This 
does not seem at all unreasonable to me.  A rank novice simply can\'t 
climb Mount Everest or perform open heart surgery with any chance of success.

However, some will see this as unfair.  To help reduce this unfairness I
suggest we use the old MT rule that Marc Miller mentioned that he might
include in T4.1:  Every task takes X amount of time.  If the PC is
especially careful and spends twice this amount of time slowly and
methodically going through the task, then the difficulty of the task is
lowered by one level (ie a Formidable Task becomes a Difficult Task). 

Using this rule only Impossible (and Stagering if they are used) are
entirely beyond characters with a Skill level of 1, and this does not seem
at all unreasonable to me. 

Also, as I posted earlier, in this system stats are not refigure until
after the combat where they were lowered. 

Everyone has been talking about how most of the task systems being
proposed are too complex.  Well, this one is *very* simple, one sheet of
paper explains it all, the only number to remember are 9, 13, and the
modifiers for stats.  Does this satisfy most folks? 

Comments?

That\'s why I go for a system where the skill determines the
diff_level of the task (suturing a lac is Easy for a Med-2, but my
med-0 would make it a harder diff_level, not just leas likely on an
easy task).  The trick is assigning task levels, not the task
system, per se.

Also, using that as a suggestion (I posted it before) target numbers
tend to be low for tasks like surgery----a good reason to have a team
of surgeons!  Surgeon (Int/Dex 9 Med-5) tries a Difficult Surgery
(meaning the diff_level is Difficult for a *surgeon* (med-5+).  The
base level task is Difficult, but the surgeon doesn exceed the min,
so it stays Difficult. His TN is 9 on the 3d6 roll.  Use the team
rules to increase the TN (that number is if he does it *alone*).

Yeah, but those are ER docs, not surgeons (3 year residency vs. 5-8
years residency) ;-)  Besides, either the EMT or the ER doc can
probably remember the pager number for the service that will
actually do more than triage the patient :-)

Very true, indeed.  That\'s why, IMHO, skills determine Difficulty
Level, not Target Number (er, or should :-)  Then within a given
skill level they guy with the better attribute will do better (the
Int 14 Med-3 beats a Int 7 Med-3).  That said, it still is possible
for the Med-1 Int 14 guy to beat better trained people from time to
time.

I think for many tasks in traveller timing is also an issue.  Give a
med-1 person 3 or 4 years, and they\'ll be able to do a surgery, too
(even if they\'d never seen it before the task started----or course
those years working towards the task would end up giving them a
med-4 or 5 skill :-)

Seriously, though, it might take a skill-1 person an hour to do
something (sucessfully) that a skill-4 person would do in a few
minutes.

I like this!  It makes stats important without being overwhelming, and
helps focus characters.  If I might add an idea, to raise a skill above the
Char/2 limit costs two skill choices.  The above EDU-6 lawyer could still
rise to Law-6, but it would cost him *9* skill choices in the end.  This
would define the driven men, who overcome their own limitations to acheive
greatness.

Make sure one doesn\'t over do this.  Maybe 1 _or_ 4.  Maybe, instead
of not being sure of getting stat increase, you need to save up
2 or 3 chances at the table to roll for a stat once....

Don\'t shoot me for a traitor, because I\'m trying for a compromise position
on TML, but please don\'t ignore me either.

Ken, as you know, I thought the tripling of skills by KB2 was too much, and
I didn\'t like going halfway on the Skill Levels vs Skill Points.  I was for
ditching Levels entirely and just giving 2 or 3 experience points for each
gain, if we were going that route, remember?  ;->

Marc, as you know, I don\'t like the 1/2 die..never have, but I got used to
them in T4.  However, with only a *single* 1/2 in T41 the system just
*grates*, it\'s inelegant and it\'s not as simple as it *could* be.  Yes, I
know the jump from Average/Routine to Difficult is big, but that\'s as it
should be...and actually encourages the player to look for aids to provide
DM\'s as tasks get harder faster.

Well, I *think* my proposal will combine the realism of KB2 and the
simplicity of T41, and with a few changes to character generation give us a
set of Target Numbers and a Task System we\'ll like.

Flat Stat+Skill *does* weight the skill more heavily than I thought it did
due to the nature of the bell curves.  So, for simplicity I\'d like to find
a way to make it flat Stat+Skill work.  It *will* work, as long as the Stat
forming the flat base isn\'t too high, and too high looks like 13+ to me and
it\'s worse with lower numbers of dice (at 13, the Stat contributes 83% on
3d and 44% on 4d..we aren\'t going to do much about the 3d, but for 4d and
above I\'d like to keep the base below 1/3). The best way to do this is to
keep Stat levels from commonly inflating into double digits.  Put a cap of
12 on them, and make it much harder to increase a high Stat than a low
Stat.  Let the player and GM negotiate the "purchase" or "award" of
temporary or artificially created Stat DM\'s to raise them (even above 12)
in game play, but don\'t hand out 11\'s and 12\'s like candy to
everybody...and T4/T41 does that.  Marc, your experience might not indicate
that, but mine does.

I also want to get rid of the 1/2 die..this ones for ME.  ;-> The half die
doesn\'t seem to ring other people\'s bells like it does mine, but the
majority of people have said they\'d *like* to see it gone.  The game is
simpler without it, more elegant, and the numbers actually work better,
IMO.  Using whole dice gives us one more die..6 rather than 5..that\'s not
so bad, and it also makes Impossible/Hopeless tasks *virtually*
impossible..that\'s not so bad either.  However, Hopeless tasks might be a
little *too* impossible so let\'s increase the Skill Levels..at little, but
not too much.

We could use some technique to double the skills (not triple..that\'s too
much for Staggering and *really* Hopeless tasks) or increase the number of
skills players get during CharGen. For simplicity, I\'m for increasing the
number of skills.  If we don\'t increase the Target Number\'s to *quite* the
number as might seem right, it also encourages the addition of DM\'s for
Tools, Teams, and so on...and Marc it seems you *like* that.

This means changing CharGen in two ways:  putting the Cap on Stats (I
suggest rolling above your current Stat on a 2d6 to improve..and if the
player wastes a skill roll trying, then tough...life\'s tough.  Instead of
giving automatic EDU bonuses for completing advanced schooling give some
additional skill rolls or maybe automatic increases in skills like
Research, Perception, or Instruction.), and increasing the number of Skills
(I suggest increasing the number of "childhood/background" skills by 3 or 4
and giving 6 skills/term rather than 4.  The 6 could be 4 career oriented
and 2 free choice.)

These changes are minimal, easy to implement, don\'t violate the feel of
Traveller, and give Target Numbers I think can live with.

Comments?

Agree. At 14 I\'d been gaming 3 years and was into quite a few games more
complicated than T4. We can\'t make the mistake of patronising younger
players about their ability. In some ways, the mechanics mattered *more*
then, as the roleplaying element hadn\'t gripped me or my players that much..

The following outlines why I think that T4\'s system is broken for me - I
believe that we are playing different styles of game, which outlines our
fundamental differences in opinion. I don\'t think we\'ll ever agree due to

I still disagree - I\'m an engineer, and I\'ve seen new people with talent
come up with a brilliant idea or solution, but the actual implementation of
the solution has required the advice or guidance of someone older/more
experienced. Experience wins in the long game. I agree that in pure science
the upstaging is more likely to happen.

Let me explain - I said that the 3 extra points of attribute on the stat 10
character accounts for a 100% of the skill value (3 in the example). In
other words, the Stat 7 character would need a skill of 6 to match the Stat
10 character. That means that the 3 points of attribute = skill level 3 =
skill/experience of a MD/professional. IMO the difference that the
attribute causes is *much* too great. (I agree that I may have said this a
little unclearly, and the \'twice\' may have caused problems in
understanding.)

>be suprised if he didn\'t mess up most of the time.

Dex 7 is *average* on 2D6. Yes, you can augment it with character
generation. But I\'ve yet to see players doing that heavily. Skills always
seem to be what the players want out of generation, in my games anyway. If
Dex 7 is a clutz in your game you\'re playing space opera IMO. I\'m not.
Maybe that\'s where we *really* differ.

I disagree. Looking back at CT/MT a high skill was 3 or 4. The attributes
were in the same range. The range of effect of the attributes was less. To
give effective opposition in T4 the referee has to intervence in the NPC\'s
generation more often. High attributes and low skills in T4 give high
overall ability in many skills. Lower attribute influence and the same
skills give you professionals in a few skills. You play Skywalker, I\'ll
play Deckard. Difference in emphasis again.

Making skills more important by making attributes less important, and
keeping the current generation system (bugfixed, naturally) means that
power gamers can only really be good in 1 or 2 areas. In T4 high stats make
you a superhero and IMO encourage power gaming.

Hmm. I\'m not so much de-emphasising attributes as looking for a return to
equilibrium/perhaps a slight skill bias. Fundamentally, I don\'t think that
the range of the attribute generates playable target numbers in the T4 task
system. Increasing skill generation to supply 2 or 3 times higher amounts
would solve the problem, but I like the link with CT/MT levels.

I don\'t think we are going to agree on this one - if you are arguing for T4
as it stands you are arguing for larger than life Star Wars/Space Opera
style characters who are good at everything. I am arguing for more of a
\'slightly heroic professionals in space\', as seen in at least 2 of the last
three Traveller editions, and films like Blade Runner. I like space opera,
but why have Traveller\'s hard science ethos when you throw all away with
super human characters *because of the way the task system works*.

	What if some skills had restrictions, like, you can\'t wield a rifle if
your DEX is less than 5, or you can\'t attempt any skill that uses a
characteristic that you have less than six on.

	E.g. Geri has Int of 4, so he can\'t attempt things like Disguise, Gunnery,
Investigation and Sensors as they all rely on intelligence. Geri just isn\'t
smart enough to pursue these things.

	Then take Al, he can\'t attempt Survey, Comms, History and Law as he isn\'t
educated enough - they all require EDUcation.

	Different skills could have different levels, say, Law could have a
minimum of 7 EDU, Comms could have a minimum of 5 EDU.

	So, this would prevent low characteristic characters with high skill
levels outdoing high characteristic-low skill level characters. Only
characters with mid-range characteristics and high skill levels would be
able to compete with high characteristic-low skill level characters.

	This rule would stop weedy (STR), clumsy (DEX), unfit (END), stupid (INT),
ignorant (EDU), common (SOC) people from achieving too much, if you\'re that
way inclined of course...

Well, if you want a linear distribution, you could always use

1st diget: 1d4 - 1
2nd diget: 1d10 (treat 0 as 0, not 10)
3rd diget: 1d10 (treat 0 as 0, not 10)

I\'m presenting this as a compromise position to two systems that both

If multiple dice methods are decided against then we can concentrate our

I need to explain what I mean by "DM\'s."  I\'m talking about modifiers
for having artifical aids, tools, and environmental benefits or
liabilities.  An example would be:  task is to Pick a lock, Target
Number composed of DEX+Intrusion...(+1 as a DM because you have a good
lockpick set or -1 as a DM because you are having to pick the lock while
wearing a clumsy Vac Suit) Those kind of DM\'s have nothing, really, to
do with the skill or the stat, but they do make tasks easier or harder.
Of course, GM\'s are going to want to be able to use those kind of
modifiers in *any* task system.

I would beg to differ with this, as a military man that has thousands of
coworkers that have excellent oppuritunities to continue education, at a
major discount, and simply don\'t.  I think people will pursue continuing
formal education if their career advancement depends on it.  Some will do so
because they have ample time to do so.  There are always those that MAKE

Here\'s a simple thought...why not make the stats lower at the outset and the

Just one point I wanted to comment on. Dex 7 is *average* for humans -
hardly a clutz. PC\'s are likely to have a higher Dex level (depending on
how you let them generate their stats of course).

pontificating about what I\'d LIKE to see in a task system:

	1. Fixed number of dice--as somebody pointed out, when you don\'t want to
reveal exactly how hard something is because it would give away too much
information, it\'s nice to be able to tell the player "Roll vs Int and Med,
and tell me what difficulty level you WOULD have succeeded at."

	2. Variable skill/characteristic connection, depending on the nature of
the task--Med+Edu to diagnose an illness, Med+Dex to perform surgery, etc.

	3. Different weighting for skills vs characteristics--again, I don\'t like
the idea of high Dex automatically making a person even reasonably
qualified in a wide range of tasks (i.e. everything controlled by Dex). I
kind of liked the idea somebody presented about skill modifying the task
difficulty, and characteristic setting the target number. So a skill
level-2 would reduce the difficulty two levels, but the final roll would be
based on characteristic alone. That would require more granularity in the
task system, though.

	4. Simple--the entire task system should fit on a single page of the book,
and the basics should fit on a single 3x5 index card.

	5. Balanced--Impossible tasks should be just that: well-nigh unobtainable
for most "average" persons. Michael Jordan should have a chance at making
an Impossible basket; I should have a miniscule chance. Rolling against an
Impossible task ought to be a desperation maneuver, a time of high tension
and breath-holding all around the table; making it should be cause for
jubilation.

	6. Better integrated--the task system, whatever it is, needs to flow
through the rest of the game better. Some people have argued that it\'s a
fallacy to try to compare CT/MT skill/characteristic weighting to T4
because they\'re completely different, and yet are ignoring all the DMs and
other skill-related stuff throughout the book that are straight out of CT/MT.

	There\'s a difference between things presented in the course of the
adventure to the players, and "Referee\'s Facts." Sure, if it\'s in the
Library Data or anything available or given to players, reinterpret the
"behind-the-curtain" truth freely. Traveller has done that.

	But when the information presented to referees, marked as such and given
as the absolute truth, changes, there are problems. If I\'m told, in
"Referee\'s Info," that A=B, it better stay that way. The whole reason for
giving me that information is so that, if and when the players come to a
point where they peel back a layer and I give them more information, I
_know_ that the future storyline will back me up. But if, in one adventure,
I present "A=B," the players will be very upset if, in a future adventure,
I vehemently maintain that "A=C." Now, if there\'s a good explanation,
that\'s one thing. But the ongoing storyline becomes worthless if it occurs
too often, or for no other reason than that a later author either wasn\'t
familiar with Traveller, or chose to ignore it simply because it was the
easy way out.

	If you\'re running a "Star Trek" style campaign, consistency becomes less
of a problem. By ST-style, I mean a campaign that\'s basically a series of
minimally-related episodes, glossing over what happens between sessions,
and not worrying about an ongoing storyline. Much like the original Star
Trek series.

	But if you\'re trying to run an internally consistent ongoing campaign,
where the players are EXPECTED to learn from and remember what happened in
an earlier episode because they tie together, they *damn well better tie
together.* If the "official setting" no longer even tries to support that,
it becomes worthless to both new referees and old ones alike. The new ones
probably won\'t run into inconsistencies quite as early as those who\'ve got
stuff going back to the original Supp 4, but they will. And it\'s really the
old guys who are going to keep Traveller alive in the short term, both by
buying supplements IF THEY\'RE USEFUL, and by pushing Traveller. How many of
you have run games in your FLGS or a local con?

	Agreed. But all the puzzling I do is WORTHLESS if the authors don\'t stick
to a consistent story. Because how can I "puzzle" about an arbitrary and
constantly changing universe? There\'s no logical consistency for me to
unravel...

	As things have been presented, the \'tech level\' violation is more than
just an artificial problem. A real-life example: archeologists are fairly
sure the Aztecs (IIRC--or was it the Incas?) didn\'t use the wheel except in
a few child\'s toys. The evidence (or lack of evidence) about wheels is
overwhelming. Now all of a sudden some adventure writer decides to create
an adventure which hinges on a widespread use of wheels. You *cannot*
reconcile or patch that in. Too many archeological finds would have to be
magically changed.

	Likewise, if in the 1100+ years between the founding of the 3rd Imperium,
and the CT era, there\'s never been any evidence of widespread technological
capabilities commonly classified as TL13 having been in use in the
Ramshackle Empire, it strains the credulity to have adventurers in the
first few years of the 3I finding repeated evidence otherwise. What, every
single archeologist was an idiot, and blindly overlooked the figurative
wheels scattered around their sites, and the historical records littered
with references to higher-tech, and a government conspiracy suppressed
everything? This isn\'t trying to reconstruct things about a pre-literate
tribe like the Anasazi. In addition to the physical evidence, there will
still be historical records as well.

	If you\'re going to ditch the entire existing body of Traveller lore,
that\'s fine. But if you\'re trying to maintain some level of consistency,
you cannot suddenly reverse things. That was one of my problems with
reports about EA, as well, and that\'s why I chose not to purchase it.

I\'m aware of that, but there seems to be quite a lot of this TL13+ 
relic tech out there, so it seems highly unlikely that the Syleans 
would get no benefit from it - like going up TL\'s somewhat faster 
than their predecessors.

These last couple of points make a good deal of sense - like the 
strange claims of Soviet competence/incompetence that the Iron 
Curtain caused. I\'ve never really liked the way the late I3 with the 
strong Vilani influences has consistently higher TLs than almost all 
its neighbours, especially the Solomani and the Zhodani - both of 
which have been shown (very long range space exploration) to have an 
active interest in long term research.

   As do I.  TNE breaks the Medical cluster down into three seperate
areas rather than two as is done in T4.  Also, whereas generic Medical
skill would allow you to do all of the above tasks in T4, you would need
each seperate Medical-related skill in TNE to do the steps above, and
they would naturally be handled as three different rolls, rather than
the referee arbitrarily breaking it down that way.

   True enough.  Marc might want to re-think the way Medical skill is
handled in T4, but then he does have a lot of other things on his mind. 
:-)  This would also be an example of where having a modifier for an
assist to a task would be useful.

The problem with this tasksystem is (IMHO of course) that not only is the
tasksystem broken but the character generation as well. My view is that for
task resolution characteristics mean little or nothing (yes you read me
correctly) BUT in gaining skills it is EXTREMELY important.
My character generation system works something like this:
The chargen system generates one or several skills that the character can
potentially get that particular year. The character then chooses one and
tries to gain a level by rolling one to several D6 versus the controlling
characteristic, the higher the level the more dice to roll.

This system simplifies task rolls to be against the skill only and the
reason for this is that in my gaming universe the definition of a skill
level is that it is a measure of how good a character is at a specific
skill/group of tasks. That means that all skill level 3 medics are equally
proficient but those with high DEX gains skills faster and can reach higher
maximum practical levels.

Could someone please tell me what this Dulinor stuff is about? At first I

are some people objecting to world building software getting written. Are
they holding some sort of right or what?

No no Tsiotstroy is still out there and after having slept for 300 000
years under the Octagon tower at Fulacin he was awakened by Cassandra
Monastera and Ulrika Loke. Right now he is plotting the revenge upon
Yaskoydroy and the players are unknowingly helping him along. That is
totally uncanonical but true in my universe and great fun.

Yes but under T4 a FFFFF7 guy with level 1 in important skills nothing is
hard unless the ref invents an adventure revolving around knitting
competitions, japanese tea ceremonials or such stuff that the character
doesnt have skills in but an FFFFF7 guy would still have an asset of 8 in
any and all tasks (characteristic/2 for lack of skill right?)

I use that on Victoria in Spinward marches. The high oxygen level stems
from a peculiar plant that carries its seed over vast distances by
inflating balloonlike fruits with hydrogen. The hydrogen is taken from
water at considerable energy cost to the plant and the excess oxygen is
vented producing the high partial pressure below the mesas. Primitive
humans live on the mesas cruising around in large handcranked or
steampropelled airships. The humans have to go hydrogen foraging on the
lower levels to get new hydrogen and as this is damaging to humans this is
done by prisoners. Great fun with age of sail style fleet battles in the
air. My players spent more than 1 year (real world year) marooned on the
planet. There\'s an article about Victoria in JTAS#2 and you should pick up
the book "Prisoners of the sky" for ideas on this particular setting.

  IMHO, T4 is the best laid out of any of the basic rulebooks save possibly
the CT Traveller Book and large format boxed set editions. I find that,
I can actually find the four pages in this book which define the task
system and effects of injury, and the two pages which define the rules of
character generation, and tell by these few pages what makes this edition
different.  This is a good thing, because if I can find these things in
my first flip through the book then finding them for reference purposes
later is a given.
  Say what you like about AD&D and TSR, but the original Player\'s Handbook
shared this easy accessability. You could tell with a quick glance what
part of the book you were in, either during first flip or later usage. The
different sections had distinctive layouts and elements, so there was no
need to look at the page headers for a subject to tell where you were in the
book.  If more game companies strove to meet this example (and the T4 rule
book comes close) the gaming world would be a better (and less myopic)
place.

 CT and MT:
  Both have an open structure for determining tasks, and both keep the
skill vs stat balance right around even. MT does it by dividing stats
by 5, bringing them down to the +0 to +3 range, right where most skills
are. CT does it by an uneven set of DMs ("DM +1 if STR 8+" for instance)
which accomplish the same thing.
  While it is possible to blow out the balance with a high skill,
the fact that skills are randomly rolled and limited in quantity reduces
this to rare cases.  The advanced systems (High Guard et al) disturbed
the balance, causing the "total skills may not exceed INT+EDU" rule to
be created.
  The open structure for tasks is the greatest strength of these systems
IMHO. As has been discussed at great length here, both recently and
historically, the Medical skill can be assisted by two or three of the
stats depending on the situation.  Thus a system which allows for this
generates fewer "But that\'s SILLY!" responses from players.
  In combat, injuries directly affect the stats, causing a bit of death
spiral effect, but not an insurmountable one. An elegant system. In MT
this system is hampered by bad editing, but the message is still a
simple one.

 TNE:
  Stat and skill are numerically weighted the same, but have slightly
different ranges. This imbalance is reduced by the multiplier system in
TNE, where the really difficult tasks are rolled on a fraction of the
stat+skill total. The imbalance is further controlled by the fact that
stats (the factor with the wider range) are randomly generated while
skills are numerous and chosen.
  In TNE it is possible to blow out the balance due to two things. First,
skills are all tied to a single stat for task resolution.  Second, as noted
here by others, the EDU stat is tied to a near majority of the skills
as well as being the easiest stat to raise by great amounts during
character generation. This means that it is fairly easy to blow out
a large number of skills with a fairly simple and legal set of character
generation steps. A simple return to the MT task definition (where each
task defines the appropriate skill AND stat) fixes much of this problem.
  In combat, injury has grown a set of rules regarding threshold levels
and penalties, and now involves hit locations. This has caused two new
"stats" to join the Traveller list: Hit capacities by location, and
Initiative. Very much a part of the second wave of RPGs, BTW, but not
really very elegant. The combat and injury system in TNE is made worse
by a nearly impenetrable editing job and a really horrid choice of
typeface.

 T4:
  I must confess that I haven\'t played this yet, though I own all of it
to date.  My regular Traveller group rebelled at learning the second new
system in five years (go figure). That said...
  T4 reverts to the CT/MT model of stat reduction due to injury. This I
like, not being a fan of binding hit location charts, and having searched
for but never found a better/simpler way to represent injury in combat.
  Stats and skills are weighted equally in the task system, but have
very different ranges. As with TNE, this is somewhat mitigated by the
(larger range) stats being randomly generated and the skill levels being
numerous.  The skills are not chosen, however, except under one variant
rule, and that same rule allows for chosen increases in stats as well.
No other part of the task system mitigates the range imbalance.
  The variable dice system is livable, though only the catastrophic
failure rule makes Impossible tasks really dangerous for a moderately
talented character (stat 7 + skill 3 = 10; avg on 4 dice = 14). Without
CFs, the system is lenient.  The half die issue obviously bugs a lot
of people, but as an old Champions player, they don\'t bother me much.
As noted by others, the half die throws the CF percentages into a
stairstep progression (1 in 36 for 2 and 2.5, 1 in 13.5 for 3 and 3.5,
1 in 7.6 or so for 4 dice), but I frankly don\'t consider this a problem
that cripples the game.
  If you insist, however...
  To keep changes to a minimum, double the skills awarded per term and
move the task progression up to full dice (2 thru 7 dice probably).
Everybody now has larger numbers on their character sheets (something
that seems to make gamers happy), the balance is restored unless you
want to generalize severely, and you don\'t have to figure out half dice.
CF would have to go to three 6s in this case.
  To replace this system completely, revert to MT for task resolution
but leave character generation alone. Now you are dividing stats instead
of dice.
  Or switch to TNE, again leaving T4 character generation rules alone.
Now you are multiplying assets and have lost the Most Holy Bell-Curve.


  To contribute to the other religious argument going on here, let me say
that I own a Mac and am proud of the fact. I consider my meager Unix
skills more useful than nearly any level of W95 knowledge, and I find
great irony in the fact that Wintel users who turned up their noses at
the Mac because it was a "toy" now brag that they have more games for
their machines.

I suspect the reason there are so many refs without players on TML and
elsewhere is that Traveller unlike other RPG (with the possible exception
of Harn) didn\'t tell the ref the facts but rather hinted at them and put
the ref in the players position regarding the truths about the universe.
The old Keith adventures were like that as well; good to read as fiction as
well as good adventures. The DGP nugget format destroyed that but I still
think that if Traveller had told the ref what the Ancients were, if
Strephon really was a robot, that the 5:th frontier war was coming the game
would have a lot less referees.
The only good thing with TNE (except the rules) was that they didn\'t tell
what was behind the black curtain.

Since statistic generation is performed using 2d6 in T4, a dice result
of "2" will occur approximately 3% of the time.  This would then
translate into meaning that about 3% of the population has a DEX of 2
(by the age of 18).  By taking 1,000 people and picking out the 30
worst individuals with regards to DEX (ie: 3%), you could then observe
their level of dexterity to define exactly what DEX=2 actually *is*.

That being said, I don\'t think a DEX of "2" would be all that
crippling to disallow a character from learning a particular
DEX-related skill.  While stat maximums of 15 (F) may actually
represent the maximum level for a human to obtain, I *do not* believe
that a DEX of 1 or 2 appropriately represents a person that is
incapable of holding a pen or walking in a straight line.

In other words, a stat of 2 does not represent utter ineptness, but
rather the lowest level _commonly_possessed_ by human beings (barring
special cases such as those with mental and/or physical disabilities).
The statistical bell curve just doesn\'t translate well if it is
considered "finite" at both ends.  It is unfair to state that 5% of
the world\'s young adults possess DEX 3 and 3% possess DEX 2, and then
go on to say that a DEX of 1 translates into "falling-down-drunk" and
a DEX of 0 means utter and complete immobility.  It\'s too big a jump
from DEX=2 to DEX=1 or 0.

IMHO, I think that when learning certain skills-- when one\'s stats are
below average-- the low stat+skill totals are enough of a hinderance.
If a player wishes to create a character with Gun Combat 5 and a DEX
of only 4, s/he should be allowed to do so.  Skill points could
probably be better used elsewhere, however (making the character much
more effective), but character generation has always been designed to
allow the player some control over his or her character\'s creation.

Additionally, I feel that skills should become increasingly more
difficult to raise during character generation as they climb above 3
or 4, *regardless* of the character\'s statistics.  T4 already takes
this into account when spending experience points.  If T4.1 takes this
into account during character creation, a character with DEX 4 & Gun
Combat 5 would be more "expensive" than one with DEX 7 & Gun Combat 2.

If T4 defines 15 (F) truly as the human statistic maximum, and 1 as
the minimum (zero representing special cases for each stat), what we
really need is a character creation process that generates stats
*much* more centered around the human average of 7 or 8 than the
current 2d6 system.  And that ain\'t gonna happen ;)

Unfortunately, this only goes to penalize the low stat character,
while doing nothing to prevent Mr. EDU=12 from ruling the game with
all his EDU related skills.

While what you and Ethan state makes sense in the Real Way Of
Things(tm), it doesn\'t do much for game balance.  Normally, I like my
RPGs to relate well with the Real World(tm).  I also believe, however,
that characters (and therefore, players) should be "more-or-less"
equally balanced when entering the game.

While I understand that T4 doesn\'t create balanced characters,
anything that widens the rift between powerful and not-so-powerful
characters should be avoided (unless your players are ready to deal
with Conans and Les Nessmans cohabitating the same gaming group :)

Definitely *not* "just Stat".  This would mean that the two guys in
your example succeed spectacularly if they succeed at all.  I\'d tend
towards rolling skill level or less only.  A level-6 Easy skill (1d6)
would have an SS 100% of the time, while a level-6 Average skill (2d6)
would have an SS less than half the time.

Rolling 2 sixes ought to do it.  This gives the Demo-4 guy listed
below a 3% chance of rolling an SF, while giving the bright guy a much
greater chance.  The more skill levels you have, the fewer dice you
will end up rolling and your chance for rolling 2 sixes goes down.

I like it, although it will require some playtesting.  Bonuses include
the fact that it forces a cap on skill levels at "6" and doesn\'t
associate stats and skills with each other *directly*.  You could call
this task system SASARTS, or "Stats And Skills Aren\'t Related Task
System" :)

Difficulty levels would have to go as high as 8 dice, to take into
account skill-0 characters attempting tasks that would be considered
Average by level-6 individuals (2d6 for Ave task, plus 6d6 for the
difference between level-6 and level-0).

It will also tend to fall apart for characters with low stats (2-4),
making even simple tasks extremely difficult.  As I stated in another
post, a human with a stat of 2 (3% of the population, based on a 2d6
method for characteristic generation) shouldn\'t have to roll 2 or less
on 2d6 to succeed in an Average task.  Heck, the poor soul would have
only a 33% chance of succeeding in an Easy task!  You might want to
reduce the number of dice rolled at each level by one and come up with
a special rule regarding Easy tasks & low stats (perhaps using 1d3 :)

In a way, your idea of using skill level to determine the number of
dice to use, and using statistics for targeting numbers, is an
interesting one.  By making a single skill level equal to +/- 1 die
(with an average result of 3.5), you are essentially stating that
skill points are 3.5x as effective as stat points.  Sound familiar?

Between this task system and the one Eris is proposing, I\'m having a
tough time deciding.  Perhaps a good nights sleep will help...

Thinking back to CT, with its technique of using the skill level as a
DM to a predetermined target number (8+ in combat, for example) to
determine the final target number for the skill test, one could say
that in T4, "7" is the base target number for all skill tests, with
each statistic point in excess of 7 counting as a "+1 DM" and each
point shy of 7 as a "-1 DM".  Once you put things in this perspective,
above or below average statistics are essentially +/- DMs to a
character\'s skill levels (plus seven).

The trick then becomes "how do you manage these \'DMs\' so that they
don\'t get out of hand and cause problems?"  How about limiting the
number of skills that can gain the benefit of stats above 12 in some
way.  That way, high stats won\'t give inhuman skill levels in all
skills associated with that particular stat.

For example, a DEX of 12 functions normally in all respects.  A DEX of
13 would function as a DEX of 12, except for "x" number of DEX-related
skills (chosen during character generation).  A DEX of 14 could
function as a DEX of 12 for most skills, a DEX of 13 for "x" number of
skills, and a DEX of 14 for another "x" number of skills (ie: the
number of skills treated as using a DEX higher than 12 would be 2x).

I\'m a little confused by what you mean by "purchase" or "award" of
temporary DMs.  Are you talking about something like Karma, Luck, or
Fortune Points that could be accumulated over the course of the
campaign and exchanged (on a temporary or permanent basis) for
one-shot DMs?

These extra skill points would mean that individual skill points would
be devalued.  Not that this is a bad thing, but it might increase a
certain level of competence (eg: Professional) by a point or two.  In
other words, if you hand out more skill points, Gun Combat 6 no longer
represents a competence level as high as it currently does (either
that, or Traveller characters are competent in a *LOT* of skills).

Good stuff here, except that according to canon, stats as high as 15
(F) must be obtainable some how (perhaps by converting acquired skill
picks into multiple +1 DMs for a future stat increase roll).

These ideas didn\'t, per chance, happen to originate during a dream,
did they?  I wasn\'t really thinking too much about the current task
system dilemma Saturday night and I was just about to drift off to
Baywatch-land when "it" just popped in there:

"Hello?"

"Psst... instead of fooling around with character\'s skill levels
(doubling, tripling, etc.), why not look at it from another
perspective."

"Who is this?"

"Shut up.  Instead of modifying the task system, why not alter the
character generation & experience systems to make a modified task
system work.  By preventing characters from having such high stats in
the first place, you\'re half way there to preventing stats from
dominating your task rolls."

"Who is this!?!"

"Hasselhoff.  David Hasselhoff."

"ARGHHH!!!--"

That\'s when I woke up.

I\'ll try to gain some more insightful info tonight... maybe Yasmine
Bleeth has something to add :)

The Dex 7 Skill 4 vs the Dex 11 skill 1 still does not go away.  Stats+Skill

In a word *Yuck!* I like this idea even less than the current T4 system
(and that\'s really saying something). 

Keeping the skill system simple at the expense of making everything else
more annoying and more complicated is IMHO hardly a good idea.  I don\'t
see that your system gains anything and it just makes things messier and
more complicated.  Artificial stat caps, doubling the number of skills
gained in char gen, ugh! 

I for one, love the new char gen sequence Marc has developed, and think
its the best I\'ve seen for *any* version of Traveller.  Let\'s not wreck it
to try to make a "better" task system

One of the things I like about T4 is that skills have the same value as in
CT and MT, so that you don\'t have to convert all the old scenarios and
sourcebooks.  Doubling the number of skills PC\'s receive would eliminate
this advantage and make T4.1 a horrible mess. 

Please, Marc, whatever you decide, don\'t use this idea.

mistaken impression that Ken\'s system uses the same number of dice for each
task as your CTS system. It does not.

Your system:                              KBv2.0:

>1d6 Easy                                   2D

Which explains your earlier mis-statement that Ken\'s system was even easier
on high-stat characters than T4. Which it isn\'t, as you\'ll discover if you
do a correct analysis.

(BTW, your tables are also confusing because you left in \'CTS\' where it
should say \'KB2\' - as in the third chart below...)

I hope nobody is persuaded that KBv2.0 is broken as a result of reading
these incorrect charts. Having play-tested and analysed T4, T4.1, KBv1.1,
KBv2.0, and several other systems, I think Ken\'s system works best. We\'re
using it now in Derroch\'s campaign, and it works just fine. I much prefer
the probabilities it produces to any of the other proposed systems.

The only potential flaw with KBv2.0, I think, is that it involves up to
seven dice; at 6D or 7D, the probabilities are weighted very much toward
the average range. I feel this is a minor problem compared to the flaws in
the other systems that have been suggested.

Seven dice _is_ a bit much. But it only seems excessive in comparison to
older games such as CT and MT. Today\'s younger players are weened on such
dice-heavy systems as Star Wars, Champions, and Storyteller; somehow I
suspect they are less likely than older CT fans to balk at the number of
dice in KBv2.0.

Eris, please re-post your tables with corrected headings and KBv2.0
probabilities. At first glance, I think your CTS compares favourably to
T4.1, but I suspect that, if you correct the figures, you\'ll find that
Kbv2.0 is better than both. At least in terms of the probabilities it
produces.

However, this system put characters not generated with T4 at a clear

This devalues skill levels, something i don\'t like.

Everyone seems to be posting task systems, so after a weekend spent working
out an alternative that I could actually, use, I read the digests and find
that Merrick has already proposed it:-( (or should it be :-)?)

The problem that I always had with the MT task system was visualising task
difficulty - is brain surgery formidable or impossible? All I know is that
you need a good surgeon, about skill 5. Preferably one with a decent dex.

Taking the medical skill as an example:

Medic-0	Apply sticking plaster, mop brow:)
Medic-1	First Aid
Medic-2	Nurse
Medic-3	Experinced Nurse/Doctor
Medic-4	Experienced Doctor
Medic-5	Specialist
Medic-6	Noted in field
Medic-7	Name known across the Sector (not in M0:)

(For CT, there would be fewer skill levels and less ambiguity about what
 each meant.)

To perform a task that you ought to be able to do is 2d6 vs stat (ie bandage
a wound is first aid, thus medic-1. Surgery needs an experienced doctor, thus
medic-4.)

Roll one extra die for each level missed, one less die for each extra skill
level.

So a nurse does first aid on 1d6 and surgery on 4d6.

If you don\'t like dice buckets, you automatically fail tasks requiring more
than 4 dice (or more than 3 dice, or more than 5.)

If you need less than 1 die you automatically succeed (or roll 1d3 if you
bought some to play T4.0 :-)

The target characteristic should depend on the task - eg surgery on DEX,
diagnosis on EDU, research on INT.

If an action can be done several ways (eg diagnosing a disease you haven\'t
seen
before: EDU to know all the variants of a disease
    or: INT to recognise the similarities to a existing disease)
Then you roll on the better of the two stats.

If an action has several requisites (eg diagnosing a disease no one has seen
before: EDU to know all the variants of a disease
   and: INT to recognise the similarities to a existing disease)
Then you roll on the worse of the two stats.

There are three solutions to SS/SF:

#1 Roll three sixes for SF (the plus point with this system is that with the
   stat capped to 15 and not many DMs being used, you don\'t get SF on
   otherwise successful rolls.)
   Roll all ones for SS (if you roll no dice then all successes are SS)

#2 Roll the dice one at a time (or use different coloured dice, eg Red,
   Orange, Yellow...) until you exceed the target number. The more dice
   you roll the better the success.

Phil

ps as much as I like alternate systems for variety, I\'d still prefer Marc\'s
T4.1 system to be published because I don\'t want a published system that
multiplies the skills or divides the stats.
I can\'t see how you could publish an alternate system on a sidebar - it
would be very confusing for anyone who had not followed the great task
system debate. And in any case, which would you choose?
Besides, I\'ve already bought a set of d3:-)

Well, Please KEEP SOME task system. Reverting to MT wouldn\'t bug me...
Although I do like the "tasking" level that was added in t4.

MT\'s task system can be made t-4 compliant easily: atts count 1/3d
attribute (Drop Frac), skill counts whole. Difficulty Scale:

Easy	Avg	Dif	Form	Task	Imp
4+	8+	12+	16+	20+	24+	Rolled on 2d6+ mods
						Crit Fail is miss by 4+
						Crit succ is make by 4+

make variable durations optional. The WHOLE of MT\'s task system took 4
pages of Charts! It was memorable, functional, and fun. And it worked. With
Extra Time, most of the higher task level became accomplishable by
moderately skilled characters. It covered different levels of failure and
Mishap.

Also, since MT did not TIE skills to one attribute, GM\'s kept flexibility.
Too much TNEism is creeping into T4... remember That Not All Uses Of A
Skill Use The Same Attribute

The multi-dice approach is WRONG, I say, WRONG, though, as the any schmoe
with an average attribute and Level-0 in skill has the ability to succeed
at ANY TASK. THis does not model reality. I cannot jump to grab a 12\'
ledge, while I know others who can, I lack certain cahracteristics they
have. But under T4, even using KB2.0 Anyone CAN (althogh probably may not)
succeed.

T4 as is is far too epic in nature; it is too easy to succeed overall, too
easy to critiaclly fail, and far to wimpy in combat (The 3D limit in combat
MUST GO!!!) It goes beyond the epic-ness of TNE...

No, but finding a TL 14 relic proves that someone once knew how to build it.
Finding a shipload of TL 14 relics implies that they were more than just
prototypes (though they _may_ have been; note my careful use of \'prove\' as
opposed to \'imply\'). Also, TL 14 relics implies the existence of TL 13
knowledge, and that the TL 13 knowledge existed for some time before the
TL 14 knowledge was developed. The longer a technology is known, the more
likely it is to disseminate. Finding several shiploads of relics scattered 
across Charted Space also implies that the knowledge was once widespread.
The more widespread a technology was, the more unlikely it is that it could
disappear completely (and before someone trots out the Dark Ages, let me
just point out that much of the lost Roman technology was, in fact, not
permanently lost.). If the knowledge is confined to just one planet then
it may disappear in some huge catastrophe. But if the knowledge is widely
disseminated, it just won\'t be permanently lost. And if you think
reverse-engineering an artifact will boost your knowledge, just wait till
you see what unearthing a few buried libraries full of technical manuals
will do.

Think about it. An atomic war may very well hurl the survivors back to TL 0,
but do you really think that even a full-scale war would destroy all the
books in the world? And many of the RoM planets didn\'t devolve 
catastrophically (some of them didn\'t devolve at all).

Not that unearthing libraries would be needed at all. Sylea itself was an 
important planet during the RoM. Don\'t you think the Sylean universities 
would keep up their technical libraries? So if they don\'t have any TL 13 
information then it\'s because they never recieved any. That would do to 
explain the lack of cutting-edge RoM TL, but if cutting-edge RoM TL is 14, 
then much TL 13 knowledge would be common. And thus available on Sylea.

Of course, knowing how to do something and being able to afford to build
the factories to build it is not the same thing (That is, IMO, the only
reasonable way to explain why so many planets have inferior TLs. They do
have the knowledge, but can\'t afford to implement it). But surely that
excuse is a bit thin for the premier planet of a large interstellar state?
Sylea should be able to afford to implement anything they knew how to
implement, right? 

It\'s note the relics themselves so much, it\'s what they imply...

Someone mentioned that the tables are all at the back, and don\'t have their

	So, as I\'m reading it for the first time, I decided to photocopy the
tables, so that as I come across some interesting points of note in the
text that relate to them, like DM\'s and stuff, I can then scribble those
DM\'s on the photocopied tables as I go along. I\'m sure this will save many
hours of "I\'m sure it\'s plus 2 on page 23, or was it between 45 and 56?"

	However, I find some of Harry Harrison\'s stuff rather excellent; the
\'World\' series I would find particularly pertinent to Traveller -
Homeworld, Wheelworld and Starworld (I think that\'s the right order)

	In Wheelworld, the colonists on a planet are only able to inhabit the
northern hemisphere for half the local year, and then they must migrate to
the southern hemisphere for the other half of the year; then they must go
back ad infinitum.

	This is because the planet\'s axial tilt / peculiar orbit (I can\'t remember
which or what) makes one hemisphere far too hot to live in for half a year.
The people there solved this by building a railway line between the two
hemispheres, and the preparation for the journey and the journey itself is
a good and enjoyable story.

	As a sideline the people note that they appear to be cut off from stellar
civilisation, which prompts confrontation sort of stuff etc. Worth checking
out.

Sorry, a clue is all you\'re likely to get. I vaguely recall the term comes from either "mental munchkin" 
referring to Baum\'s characters\' stature or "munch-kin" referring to pac-man (!). Check the Space 
Gamer/Adventure gaming back issues if you can, somewhere around 1980-85; they used to run lists of gamer types 
in a lot of issues.

    'body' => 'Allow me to summarise:

1) Marc is very keen on the skill + stat approach, still; there is 
some real-world logic to it as well.

2) Many TMLers feel that *given the current character generation 
methods* stats are over-rated by a fair bit relative to skills.

3) There are a number of suggestions for skills reducing the 
difficulty of tasks (or increasing it).  This is based on the idea 
that skill is more than "enhancement of natural ability", which is a 
CT idea still manifest in T4 in places (Medic-2 bonuses, etc.)

4) All the task systems have problems.

5) All things being equal, the D3 should go.


I am going to accept 1) as a starting point.  Marc has good reasons 
for his decisions, and it\'s his call to make.  The Great Task System 
Debate (TGTSD) is therefore redefined as: how can T4.1 be adjusted to 
take the other points into account?

5): either round up the half-die (so harder tasks are D3 or D6 
harder, and the scale is 2D - 6D) or keep the rolls as per Ref\'s 
Screen.  It\'s easy enough to change this as a house rule, so maybe it 
doesn\'t matter so much.

2): It will be much more work to rejig the character generation, and 
that is quintessential Traveller, IMO.  A characteristic cap of 12 is 
a major change also.  So I\'ll stick to solutions which use the rest 
of the system as is, where possible.  In practice, that\'s solutions 
of type 3).

3): I strongly support the idea of a skill representing more than 
"training in use of natural facilities"; I believe it represents 
facets of knowledge and understanding at conscious and unconscious 
levels.  A medical-4 doctor, however poor a surgeon, can still *teach* 
medicine to high levels of skill.  I therefore reject any suggestion 
that skill + stat is the only determinant of task success by a 
character: there will be situations where the additional levels of 
ability are necessary.

This leads to the suggestions of changing task difficulty for 
different skill levels (in which I include making certain tasks 
require a minimum skill level).  The trouble with these solutions is 
they are horribly non-linear, especially those which lead to an 
improvement every 2 levels.  (Suddenly PCs develops skills at odd 
levels only...)  Furthermore, minimum skill levels are not in the 
spirit of existing tasks like those in PE.

People have talked about task DMs for environment.  This is the point 
on which MT is utterly superior to T4 as published: it was 
specifically designed for "adverse conditions" to make a task one 
level more difficult instead of having a huge table of plusses and 
minuses for success.  That was a brilliant idea which I don\'t find in 
T4 -- there were (to my dismay) huge tables of modifiers.  That\'s a 
big minus to playability IMHO.

So here\'s my idea:

Tasks are perfomed as usual in T4.x: roll under skill + stat + DMs

*Unfavourable DMs are cancelled out by skill*, so if a skill-2 
character has a -4 DM, skill reduces it to -2.

Optional: The maximum improvement is to halve the DM.

Rationale: skill represents widespread familiarity, including lots of 
experience in a variety of conditions.  A high-dex character may be 
an extremely good shot with a rifle under ideal conditions; military 
types would be much better at events like "keeping rifle clean in the 
field, running 100 m then shooting at well-armed opposition in the 
fog".  They have the experience to correct for problems.

Consequences: in ideal conditions, youth and ability can win out.  
(Research labs may be closer to ideal in this respect than most.)  In 
the nasty, dirty real world, experience and skill counts more highly.
This emphasises the distinction between tasks which are inherently 
difficult and tasks which are made so by circumstance: the former is 
controlled by Difficulty Level, the latter by DMs.

If most task DMs are negative, then this may make tasks too easy for 
skilled characters, and difficulty levels might need be stepped up 
slightly.  If large negative DMs are relatively rare, this won\'t be 
necessary.


Effects:  Gunnar (rifle-4, stat 6) vs. Dex (rifle-1, stat-12).
Competition shooting, Dex is much better (+3, or about one difficulty 
class).  If it\'s windy or the \'scope is misaligned (DM -2), there\'s 
very little change (or none, using the optional rule).  If it\'s dark, 
windy, and a pinpoint hit is required (DM -9, for a double-damage 
shot under those conditions), suddenly the two are on level terms.
That patrol on Shudushaam has given Gunnar all too much experience in 
this kind of thing...

Optional rule effects: there are some possible abuses, like always 
shooting for double damage under good conditions, never bothering 
with a shoulder stock, etc..  I think these are features rather than 
bugs, but until I test the system at the weekend I won\'t know for 
sure.  The optional rule eliminates the possibility, and means a -1 
DM always means -1, not 0, if you do the rounding that way.


Role-playing effects:  You let Dex (medical-1) start the operation, 
but if complications develop experienced ol\' Doc (medical-5) will 
take over or give instructions.

Characters with really high skill become effective gunslingers (in 
the Wild West sense) whereas mere mortals can "only" shoot straight.


Addition to existing systems:

Bolts right on to T4.x

Would improve KBv2.0 if weighting became stat + 2*skill and this 
rule was applied -- reduces "superhuman" effects of highly-skilled 
characters.  IMHO.

Less useful for MT (which uses fewer DMs, in any case)

Good ideas (FUDGE inspiration?).
I suggest the following based more or less on your (Phil) ideas:

Pick names for tasks/skills that mean something in both contexts:
(Can somebody come up with something less derogatory than bad,
inexperienced perhaps?)
Skill lvl       Skillname (code)     Taskname (code)
=========       =========            ========
No skill        Unskilled (US)       -
Skill-0         Extremely Bad (EB)   Extremely easy (EE)
Skill-1         Very bad (VB)        Very easy (VE)
Skill-2         Bad (B)              Easy (E)
Skill-3         Normal (N)           Normal (N)
Skill-4         Good (G)             Hard (H)
Skill-5         Very good (VG)       Very hard (VH)
Skill-6         Extremely good (EG)  Extremely hard (EH)

Roll 2D6 <= attribute.
+1D6 for each difficulty level above skill
- -1D6 for each skill level below attribute
If the number of dice is 0 or less success as well as SS is automatic.
If dieroll <= attribute/2 (round up) then SF

This gives the ref an easier task (pun intended) determining task
difficulties and every point of characteristic count and lowered
characteristics through damage etc really does affect the player.
(Hey I just thought this up so and haven\'t thought it through but as I
reread it maybe I can even use it myself ;)

actually, I always use dex for action intensive, critical-that-you-hit-the-
buttons-right-the-first-time tasks, in preference to other things. I know
that even in flight sims, when the presure is off, int is more important;
in  a cessna, int is vital EXCEPT when landing under bad weather; in
combat, you hit the wrong button and *P*O*O*F*...

I agree, that dex is not the vital factor it is in atmosphere... but then I
run starship combat under a personal combat time-scale, using mega\'s combat
rules (since no other traveller rulesetscales so nice). Since mega came
out, I have been reluctant to use any other ruleset for personal or
vehicular combat, and have fudged along witha fusion of MT combat system
with BL diffmods. Under such a time scale, with the much shorter ranges
from MT\'s "Starship Weapons" table in Player\'s, combat is generally at
ranges under 5 km, and short. a few good jinking maneuvers are more
important than long term planning at that scale.

Here I\'d disagree... not enough variety for my tastes (but then, I wanted

Again, here I agree whole heartedly. T4\'s saving grace is Marc\'s decision
early on to try and keep it compatable with CT/MT. Eris and the "TNE
Heretics" never were on par with CT/MT, and to them it may not be
important... but to those who kept the flame for over a decade, changing
the value of skill level x is going to be annoying.

Impossible tasks -to me- were alway just that: impossible. 
If a players insisted on doing something that most people would think 
to be impossible (brain transplant in our world), i\'d assign the 
impossible level, giving at least a shot at it, maybe even a chance 
to succeed.
If he just did something very, very improbable, i\'d assign the 
Formidable Level, still very hard to do, but easier than impoassible!

I feel that impossible tasks are too easy in T4.1 as well as in 
KBvXX. That\'s whya i promote using Traveller for T4.

I was wondering if anyone can fix my confusion of an issue I have...? I
was looking at the books to create my own deckplans and the first (green
small book with all the original deckplans) book I have on the subject
says each square represents 1.5m^3 and a cieling height is 3m so you need
2 squares on top of each other or => 6.75m^3 

Now my first question is where did they derive 13.5m^3 (it indicated
something about 4 squares?????).... what is wrong here or have I misread
something???

So if I had a 30ton vessel (small craft) this equals about 420m^3 volume
or roughly 62 squares right?? now of course some of this is wasted
space... but if I went by the book it says 14m^3 = 1ton and a 1.5m^3
square is considered 1ton (right?) that would be 31 squares???

Im confused could someone help me?

I almost immediately assumed the ship in question is a corsair.  I think
there was a reference to the clamshell doors being welded shut so that the
could no longer accomodate a 100ton ship - I think this feature was unique
to the corsair.

Of course, they should have included the ship\'s deckplans and class name.

I do not recall any CT product (I don\'t remember the corsair showing up in
any other version of Traveller) that featured the Corsair\'s deck plans
(almost every other CT \'standard\' class was either in an adventure or
Traders and Gunboats) so I doubt that any deckplan for that class exists as
yet (except perhaps in someone\'s private collection).

Personally I could never figure out why the Imperium would allow
construction of a purpose-built privateer in imperial shipyards, capable of
hijacking entire 100ton vessels whole hog (in addition to other, strictly
paramilitary modifications).  The class was absent in my own adventures
(although there was a Vargr version I used).

Yeah.  This is a better way of stating what I was getting at.
Again, regardless of the task system, if you don\'t know how to set
good tasks, it doesn\'t matter.  Having a system that bases task
determination on commonly understood benchmarks (professional
hierarchies) makes it easy to figure out how hard a task is on the
fly----the ref just asks herself, "Who can reprogram this computer
system----a CS person, let\'s see, Comp-2 is Average, slide the scale
from there."

The SS idea is a great addition.

I posted this during the last task wars with this as the primary
reason why I like it/use it--it makes setting tasks for stuff you
don\'t actually know about easier:  Who can do it?  OK, it\'s Routine
for that skill level.  Task set.

 However, this system put characters not generated with T4 at a clear

The problem is, as much as people may like TNE or Mega or CT, those systems
don\'t exist any more. There are no new publications for them, and comparisons
to them don\'t work. The objective standard in T4 is that characters get about
1 skill per year. And skill levels then reflect that idea.

Keep the target number determination the same = Stat+Skill BUT, Cap the

Thus,

Skill 1, Stat 5. TN = 5+1 =6
Skill 1, Stat 8. TN = 8+1 =9
Skill 1, Stat F. TN = F+1 = 16 (Capped to 9)
Skill 2, Stat 8. TN = 8+2 = 10
Skill 2, Stat F. TN = F+2 = 17 (Capped to 11)

This has many advantages:-

1) It\'s Simple!

2) Restores the importance of skills over characteristics.

3) Doesn\'t break existing the existing published system assumed in PE,

4) Reduces chance of success at high difficulties.

>Where did the RPG definition of Munchkin come from?

Munchkins, in their roles as protectors of the Yellow Brick Road, by
necessity develop a large number of useful skills. In fact, the
relentless training ritual of singing, dancing and skipping force the
small folk to develop perfect coordination and the best possible
cardi-vascular system. Consequently, all Munchkins have Dexterity and
Constitution ratings of 18.

The constant work the Munchkins do in picking flowers and replacing
yellow bricks that have faded to faint pastels also does its work to
chisel the muscles of these hardy folk. Lifting sometimes as many as two
or three bricks at a time, all Munchkins have a Strength score of 18.
Those who occasionally work out even further by practicing sword
fighting with dandylion stems actually exceed this score, and these
Munchkins have a Strength score of 18/00.

Munchkin life is not entirely a physical endeavor, however. There is, of
course, the Wizard to deal with. Being in such proximity to Oz--not to
mention all those Wicked Witches--requires sound judgement and a sharp
mind. Merely in order to survive such a lethal magical environment
requires all Munchkins above the age of four to have an Intelligence and
Wisdom of 18 each.

With their firm, chiseled bodies, the grace that comes from a lifetime
of dancing, a keen wit and impeccable judgment, Munchkins cannot help
but to be the envy of all other races. Still, their courage and senses
of humor make the Munchkins the most lovable race in the multiverse.
Therefore, all Munchkins have a Charisma (and Comliness, if this
optional rule is used) score of 18.

Munchkins as a race are, of course, the most highly developed beings
ever produced by the gods--in fact, each and every member of the race
borders on the divine itself. Their incredible aptitude in all areas
mean that they automatically gain every non-weapon proficiency the first
time they attempt a task. In fact, they never suffer a non-proficiency
penalty whether using a weapon or attempting a new skill for which they
previously had no proficiency slot.

Naturally, such a capable race cannot be held back to only one character
class. All Munchkins are Warrior/Priest/Wizard/Rogues, but use the Rogue
table to advance in levels for all classes. Lawful Good Munchkins are
usually Paladin/Specialty Priest/Evoker/Bards, while other Good Munkins
may be Ranger/Druid/Necromancer/Thiefs -- or anything else they want!

Because of the powerful aura which Munchkins posess, any being opposing
one automatically functions as if they are subject to a Protection from
[Good/Evil/Whatever] 10\' Radius spell. All attacks against Munchkins are
made at -2 to hit and damage, spells do -1 hit point per die, and
Munchkins are immune to any spells from the Illusion school.

In any adventuring party, the Munchkin will naturally be the party
leader, despite his small stature. In order to make up for this handicap
(being short), the Munchkin always gets first choice of any treasure
(particularly magic items) found by the party.

Munchkins are distantly related to dwarves, humans and oompa-loompas,
but of course they are far superior to any of these races.

Marc threw down the gauntlet by saying he\'d have to see at least 50 others
who want to see the task system changed. *He* initiated this.

Well more than 50 (I believe the count is over 80 now) responded that they
are dissatisfied with the task system in its current state.

As for what you "consider," that\'s really irrelevent. Marc has already
responded  with a new survey to determine with more specificity what it is
TMLers think should be done to fix the task system. Sam Thomas is
administering it.

As stated above, he *has* responded with an additional survey to determine
what needs to be done. As for your "10 or 20 or 100" for every TMLer
argument, if such a "silent majority" even exists, they have only
themselves to blame for not speaking up.

Or all skills have the same required level... If Char is <6, then Char can\'t
be used in the task. The problem is that it makes a rather sharp break for
those on the cusp.

It also implies that, if someone gets one of those skills in CharGen (and all
associated Char are <6) then he gets to roll again.

Steam engines + high O2 + close proximity to a bag full of Hydrogen

I can see it now: a flaming airship, falling rapidly into the depths of
the atmosphere, burning faster and harder as it goes...by the time it gets
to the ground, even the normally inflammable stuff should be lit up! You
could probably get _iron_ to burn readily in that atmosphere, once it\'s
heated up enough. 

Air battles on that planet must be horrific!

I don\'t know how they did the size derivation, but, yes, 1.5 meter squares
are a giant PITA to figure out. That\'s why I went to 1 x 1 x 3.5 m
\'squares\' on my deckplans. That way 4 squares = 14 m^2 = 1 Td. That makes
it a heck of a lot easier to figure out where to put stuff.

But, allegedly, the Naval Architects Handbook is supposed to fix all this
and be the definitive guide to making deckplans, right?

	At this point, I should mention the Deathworld series, also by 
Harrison. Not exactly a literary treasure chest, but Deathworld I was 
the book that originally inspired me to take up SF gaming instead of 
plain vanilla fantasy RPGs... :)

	The sequels aren\'t that good, but still worth reading if you\'re not 
busy with preparing an adventure.

I used invisibility in a game at one point.  It was a very successful
campaign but might have been too "Gifty" for many of the players here.  The
GM (me) was quite generous with weapons/equipment and abilities, but that
generosity extended to the NPCs opposing the characters as well.  In the
end, the characters destroyed each other.

In fact it was the very "downside" of the psi character (he basically
traded away his sanity to acquire the ability to become invisible - and was
a good enough player that he *played* the character as insane...unlike
another player in the same group under similar circumstances) that caused
their destruction.

It can be done, but it should definitely be something that costs
dearly...and turns out to be not what the character or player expected
(even though it is precisely what they asked for).

Little things like this are what make Traveller so much fun!

In the text of the book, there is a discussion about the Imperium selling
captured Corsairs, after making sure that they could not be used in thier
original occupation.

I can only speak for my campaign, but with the exception of the VARGR
classes of the ship, normally the Corsairs that have been commissioned
have been done so as Starship, Transport, Armed.  These are the ships that
go out and ferry the damaged Type S and J (by far the most common ships
out there) back to Class C+ starports for repair, deliver shuttles and
other small spaceships, etc...

I was wondering what computers/operating systems people here use?  I\'ve
seen quite a few mentions of Macs and only a few Unix/Windows/Dos.

If you *do* answer this, can we please be careful to avoid any OS wars.

My second question is more Traveller-related.  What would you want
Pocket Empires software to do?  This is a deliberately vague question to

I do too.  I always liked the old Merc/HG chargen system for characters
that would be around for a while, like major players and villains, with
others left to random assignment off the top of my head.

Using tasks for the parts of a year inside a term would give many of the
same results, but in a consistent way.  (Note: even in Merc/HG, I allowed
players unlucky at dice to get an automatic skill boost every year and a
half, with the dice determining the more RP-style things, like wounds,
decorations, promotions, and so on.  This way, an unlucky player might
never get a high rank character, but he would at least have a playable one.)

I do believe you are correct.  It is a corsair that was captured and
modified by the Imperial Navy for resale as a merchantman.

I to agree.  It would have been a lot more convenient.

There was a set of deckplans for a Corsair made by FASA (I think is was
them).

Not all ships have to be made at Imperial Shipyards.  There could be pirate
or independent shipyards or ships like Fleet Repair Docks (mobile
shipyards).

I don\'t think it is addressed, but if you want free advice...

Prototypes can be built by a culture at one tech level higher than the
current TL provided;

1). The item being made does not require some critical technology that the
building planet has not discovered (Referee\'s discretion; example - no
matter how much money you spend, you can make a grav tank without gravitics
having been discovered).

2). The prototype is made in a laboratory by hand (as you indicate) in a
manner that precludes \'mass production\' or \'common usage\' (example -
requires a process that uses cutting edge technology and some quantity of
experimentation, or perhaps a high failure rate - so that many flawed
examples are produced for each successful example).

3). The planet in question did not "just" reach the TL below the one they
are attempting to emulate.

In any case there should be a significant outlay of cash and time, both
highly variable and dependent on the specific situation.  For your Battle
Dress, for example, I would roll or choose a number 10-20 times the regular
cost and require 5-10 years of development time over which the dollars were
spent.
If possible, a \'size penalty\' would also be a good idea - think about
prototype computers as an example.  This would be hard to implement in the
Battle Dress example though.

Most importantly, any \'prototype\' will, contrary to TV or Movie examples
(usually), have "bugs".  In game terms that is a random chance of failure
whenever the item is used, and especially when it is pushed to its
operational limits.  I would probably, in the case of Battle Dress, roll 2D
secretly every ten minutes or so to see if a breakdown occurs (It would
occur if I rolled a 2).  Under extreme conditions (heavy lifting by BD, or
operation in vacuum perhaps) the chance would be greater (according to my
mood).  The first breakdown might be relatively minor (radio burns out, HUD
goes down, etc) or not, but each subsequent breakdown would be an order of
magnitude higher in likelyhood and severity until the thing was brought
back to the lab and repaired (or the bonds in the bonded superdense broke
down, leaving the character standing in his/her underwear in the middle of
a pile of metallic dust).  Oh, and did I mention the unavailability of
spare parts outside the lab?

Technological prototypes are an excellent example of the need for Game
Balance(tm).\\

This is a great suggestion.  Here we have a simple system, where stats 
are important, but skills are not made irrelevant.

This one gets my vote!

Just use the Traveller Task name and the Fudge Skillname..

          Skillname   Taskname 
          =========   ========        
Skill-7+  IMPOSSIBLE  LEGENDARY
Skill-6   HOPELESS    SUPERB
Skill-5   STAGGERING  GREAT or EXCELLENT
Skill-4   FORMIDABLE  GOOD    
Skill-3   DIFFICULT   FAIR
Skill-2   AVERAGE     MEDIOCRE          
Skill-1   SIMPLE      POOR  
Skill-0   AUTOMATIC   TERRIBLE  

...I added a couple to make to two sets of descriptions fit, but they *do*
fit well.

>Roll 2D6 <= attribute.
>+1D6 for each difficulty level above skill
>-1D6 for each skill level below attribute
>If the number of dice is 0 or less success as well as SS is automatic. If

This is similar to what I\'m using for my PBEM\'s as Task vs Skill
Descriptors..except I offset the skill descriptors up one row.  When I
use this technique, I usually don\'t use the Attribute in the task
resolution at all, it goes into producing the Skill Points (high
Stat-learn skills fast, low Stat-learn skills slowly).  I also describe
the Attributes with these descriptors, so I can use them in Stat only
tasks.

The FUDGE-ish way to do this would be:  To perform a task, roll 4 dice
(the preference is -1,0,+1, but regular d6\'s can be used and compared to
tables) to produce a number in the range of -4 to +4, put your finger
on the task descriptor and move up or down a number of rows based on the
number you rolled.  If you don\'t go past the PC\'s skill descriptor you
succeed.

Example of how I would do it:  Joe\'s skill is FAIR and he is trying to
perform a STAGGERING Task.  Placing my finger on FAIR and running it up
to STAGGERING we see that Joe will need a +2, or better, to succeed.  He
rolls +3, and succeeds...one level higher than needed making this a
*solid* success.  If he had roll +2 he would have *barely* succeeded.
If he had rolled a +4, it would have been a *spectacular* success.  If
he had rolled a +1 he would have barely failed, 0 or below would have
been increasingly worse failures, down to a *spectacular* failure at -4.

Plus or minus, modifiers can also be added, but anything over +/-2 is a
*big* modifier.

This system works nicely and can be adapted to Traveller in many
different ways, but it is *so* different, I wouldn\'t dream of suggesting
Marc use something like this in T41.  ;->

All right...I can\'t let this OBVIOUSLY BROKEN system go on!

You completely forgot step 1.5: The GM Cackles gleefully as he/she rolls a
HUGE handful of dice, including the DM special Death Die (A 10-sided with
a skull and crossbones on every face), then gasps as he/she looks at the
results.

Not only do I use this wonderful system, without fooling anyone, but now
my players don\'t even pretend they need to throw the dice. They just ask
what terrible result fate has inflicted upon them.

Examples would include:  Artificial aids that could be mechanical,

Hey, my idea is to *limit* high Stats, not outlaw them.  So, let\'s not put
a absolute *cap* on the Stat, just require a roll of 12 for every increase
above 11.  That will let\'s you get to 15 if you want, but it\'s going to be
*hard* and cost you many skill rolls. ;->

The problem is that that skill points are *currently* devalued by the
system.  In CT and MT we used 2d6, in TNE we used 1d20, now we are getting
up to 4,5,6 or even 7d6!  We\'re also getting more skills per term!  Skill
*levels* are already devalued compared to the old systems.

The easiest work-around is controlled inflation...add some more skill
points.  I think a couple per term would do it.  Would that mean our
*perceptions* of level of competency would have to change?  Yes, it would.
If you always thought of Skill-4 as Professional, you\'d have to get use to
thinking of Skill-6 as Professional.

I can accept that, or just have the 3% chance of increasing past 11. That
works for me too.

Actually, as more casual observer, I must say that this list has

The lable "complexity" is a real bubaboo in gaming these

Actually, I prefer limiting the number of skills linked to a
particular stat to /half/ that stat\'s value.  I can\'t see why poses
sing a low INT+EDU total would limit you in the number of physically
related skills you could possess.

My *gut* feeling is to agree with you, but I don\'t think *any* system
similar to Marc\'s and Ken\'s is going to completely solve the high Stat
problem.  But that problem only becomes sever with a *high* Stats, that\'s
why they should be RARE.  You don\'t have to cap them, just don\'t give them

What I\'m proposing here is a compromise system between Marc\'s and Ken\'s, so
I didn\'t want to go into other kinds of solutions.  I also want to see what
Marc and Ken have to say about it...your yuck not included. ;->

You don\'t want *more* skills?  You want to allow high Stats..even encourage
them with automatic EDU-11 on graduation from grad school? You also want to
complain about the descrepency between high Stats and low skills?

The skill ranges from CT and MT don\'t exist any more, John.  In T4 the
skills have already crept higher, and with Marc\'s new Character Generation
they are creeping higher still.

Hmmm... so a DEX=7 character, with skill-6, performing an Extremely
hard (EH) task, would *automatically* succeed.  The two dice he would
normally roll would not be increased since the difficulty level does
not exceed his skill level.  They would, in fact, be reduced to only
one die, due to the fact that the skill level of 6 is one less than
the character\'s DEX of 7.  Therefore, he\'d be rolling only 1d6, trying
to roll less than or equal to his DEX rating of 7... automatic
success.

> If dieroll <= attribute/2 (round up) then SF

This doesn\'t sound right, since the above example would translate into
wanting to roll as low as possible, without rolling too low.  This
might be confusing since each die roll would have to be judged whether
or not it was inside this variable window between success and SF.

The above example would then have a 0% chance at SS, a 33% at success,
a 0% chance at failure, and a 67% chance at SF.  It is the lack of a
possible simple failure that bothers me.

Me thinks this task system needs a bit more work (or am I missing
something :)

And I\'ve seen a lot of old hands insist on "guiding" a younger
person who could easily have handled the sistuation on their own
(and make no mistake, I am an old hand more than a young turk).
I guess is come down to what I said before.  It not a matter
of "right" or "wrong", it\'s a matter of things just happening
to be the way, or not, that one happens to see them.

Um no. A stat 7 person needs a skill of 3 to match a stat 10
person.  Also, the stats go off of a minimumt that is 3 points
higher and the additional fact is that stats are non-linear
so that very few people start from a minumum stat.

The point is that a stat of 7 is, even if most stats are only
augmented a step or two, slightly below average.  This is
seriously mediocre talent and is, at best, barely adequate
for a professions, like doctor, that requires some ability.
He _is_ going to take a lot of traing just to catch up to
someone who has some real talent.  If someone had a stat
of 3 or 4 I would say they should _never_ catch up.

I still don\'t see this.  If you use the character generation
system to make up NPC\'s (not what I would do) then you are
going to get similar characters (subject to the changes of
luck).  If you make them up you are going to just give them
similar skill and stat levels.  There is not game on
Earth where you can\'t make up NPC\'s similar to the PC\'s

It always seems that if you argue out any gaming issue long
enough.  Someone will start claiming that the other way is
more munchkin.  I\'ve seen this same claim put forward for
systems that emphasis skills over stats.  What happens is
that the power gamers make character that are uniformly
mediocre in every stat and just pump one or two skills up.
Then instead of having a universe where everyone is talented
but nobody is trained, you have a universe where, for some
reason, a bunch of no-talents were trained for all the
important missions.

We could argue about which is worse, but the bottom line
is that if skills depend on stats in any way, then the
munchkins will find the best tradeoff and exploit it.

I agree that a stat increase should be harder to get than a
skill increase (it is a more fundamental change in the
character).  But that calls for tweaing the character
generation system.  Not overhaulling the task system
(which I would do, but that\'s just because I don\'t
like the variable dice scheme...)

Well, a Dex 7 is that average rolled, before any additional
character advancement.  That means that  a stat of 7 is
below average.  I would say that someone on the clutzy
side of average is not doctor material..

Well, no. If you have most of the people coming out of
the stat generation (ie you acount for the fact that
stats are non-linear, and so don\'t have as big an
effective range) with numbers that vary just as much
as skill (ie skills are, say 0-6 and most of the
characters have stats in the 4-11 range.) then
skills and stat _are_ equally weighted.

The only reason Dex 7 and skill 4 vs Dex 11 and
skill 1 is seen as a problem is the desire to
see skill weighted more heavily than stats.  But
that is matter of personal opinion.

 actually, I always use dex for action intensive, critical-that-you-hit-the-
 buttons-right-the-first-time tasks, in preference to other things. I know
 that even in flight sims, when the presure is off, int is more important;
 in  a cessna, int is vital EXCEPT when landing under bad weather; in
 combat, you hit the wrong button and *P*O*O*F*...
 
 I agree, that dex is not the vital factor it is in atmosphere... but then I
 run starship combat under a personal combat time-scale, using mega\'s combat
 rules (since no other traveller rulesetscales so nice). Since mega came
 out, I have been reluctant to use any other ruleset for personal or
 vehicular combat, and have fudged along witha fusion of MT combat system
 with BL diffmods. Under such a time scale, with the much shorter ranges
 from MT\'s "Starship Weapons" table in Player\'s, combat is generally at
 ranges under 5 km, and short. a few good jinking maneuvers are more
 important than long term planning at that scale.
 <<

Being a pilot I think I can safely say that it is not sop much a matter of
atmosphere as it is speed.  Jet aircraft require more Int than Dex.
 Dogfighting in a Jet is much different that a slow moving biplane.  There
just isn\'t that much "seat-of-the-pants" flying done in jet aircraft, its
mostly procedural and being able to memorize maneuvers and recreate them at
the proper time.  Much more mental than physical.  

If I lined up the guys in my pilot training class and asked you to pick the
best pilot by looking at them you would probably not pick the best guy until
you exhausted most of the class.  He was large, balding, overweight and
easygoing.  Although he looked nothing like Val Kilmer,  he is the proverbial
"Iceman", with a very sharp mind and steady nerves.  He was a Comp Sci major,
just as an aside.  What stat covers steady nerves?

was getting kinda creepy :-)

Anyway, when I first threw this out (maybe I should go find FUDGE
and look at it since apparently it\'s similar) I suggested that one
way that I\'ve set task levels is to just think to myself "Who is
this task impossible for?"  

By this I mean *really* impossible, not Impossible Task Level.

For something impossible by people with no skill at all:

That skill would be Impossible+1 on the task scale, then drop it by
1 level (1d6 per level) for each skill level.  I include skill-0 for
this.

Skill Level	Task Level
- ----	----
none		really impossible
0		Impossible
1		Stag
2		Form
3		Diff
etc.

Say a certain task is impossible for someone without some actual
skill.  Take a complicated neurosurgery proceedure, for example.
For this case the person needs skill-3 to even be familiar with the
existance of the task:

Skill Level     Task Level
- ----     ----
2			impossible (really)
3		Impossible Task
4		Stag.
5		Form.
6		Diff.
7		Ave

(note that in this example I\'d allow DMs if the person had help, so
the surgery still might be a "Difficult" one for even an incredible
surgeon, but in normal conditions DMs will make it very likely a
success)

A good analog to the example above would be rock climbing.  We could
rate a free climb, barefoot, as Staggering, yet with DMs for shoes,
pro, and a partner on belay it might happen frequently without even
a fall.  Again, the task could either assume all the gear and get
called Average, or it could be baselined in such a way that the ref
adds in all the extra stuff as DMs.  I lean this way, personally.

It has the benefit, BTW, that it works with any task system\'s
mechanics.

*Two* 1.5 m squares = 6.75 * 2 = 13.5 m = 1 Displacement Ton

Some deckplans in Traders and Gunboats are *gasp* incorrect. Some plans
use 4x 1.5 m squares = 1 displacement ton. Most notably, the Empress
Marava is two times bigger than it should be.

The first half of your paragraph is roughly correct... don\'t go by the
book, it is what seems to be confusing you. :)

Use this handy conversion guide:

TWO 1.5 m squares (~3 m height) = ONE displacement ton.
ONE 2 m square (~3.5 m deck height) = ONE displacement ton.
FOUR 1 m squares (~ 3.5 m deck height) = ONE displacement ton.

BTW, I like to use a deck height of 6 m for the cargo hold, so for a
Trader\'s large cargo hold ONE 1.5 m square = ONE displacement ton.

A 30 ton vessel would need about 60 1.5 m squares.

>Eris and the "TNE Heretics" never were on par with CT/MT, and to them
>it may not be important... 

William, I find that remark insulting and provocative.  I wish to make a
special note disassociating myself from your attempt to include me in any
such group...if such exists.

I freely admit to being a "Traveller heretic", but this is a personal
choice *not* a group thing.  I\'m absolutely and most specifically not a
"TNE", nor an "MT" nor a "CT" anything.  There are many things about TNE I
liked, many I didn\'t like, and an attitude from *some* people I couldn\'t
stand.  I say exactly the same about T4, MT, and CT, though there was less
of an "attitude" problem with CT.

My heresy has always been about attitude, not specific rules or background. 
I reject the notion that there is "One, and only one, true way to play
Traveller."  I don\'t believe that has *ever* been true, and, IMO, and never
will be true!  A GM has the right to use as many, as few, or no rules, from
any source, applied to any *background* and still call the game Traveller.

I say, that you can play the game in the published background, and if you
lack the time or imagination to develop your own, then you probably should,
or you can change one thing, several things or everything. That\'s your
option, and your right, and no one should give you a hard time about it
either way.  William, *that* is my herecy, make of it what you will!

IMO, there was much too much of the "one true way" attitude from the GDW
shepherds of TNE.  They had a "plot", a "storyline", that they were playing
out, and we could play along so long as we didn\'t step outside *their*
boundaries.  I didn\'t like that, and I continued to play in my own
universes.  I also bought very few of the TNE publications.  Why should I
when they were specific to a single storyline, in a single universe that I
wasn\'t using?

There was almost as much of that attitude from the MT people. Not the
*official* people, so much, as the self-appointed "guardians" of that thing
they called canon.  I didn\'t like that, either!  If you weren\'t playing out
their rebellion, on their star charts, with their major NPC, in their
offical scenerios, and their details then there was nothing for you.  As
the years went by, fewer and fewer of the MT publications were worth
buying, if you wanted to play elsewhere.

The original CT had it right.  Present some guidelines for play, a simple
suggested background and let the players and GM use their imaginations.  I
bought virtually everything published for CT, and still use it.

I hoped T4 would be more like CT, in that way.  It\'s not, but I\'m use to
going my own way after 15 years.  So far, I\'ve found some of the books
worth buying, but how soon will everything be specific to a single Milleu,
in a single storyline, in a single universe?

Will never mind!  You can\'t do anything about that, and perhaps there are
good economic reasons for all those, IMO, bad choices GDW made and IG may
be making.  Part of being a heretic is being out of step with the
mainstream, and playing in non-standard universes is my choice, so be it.

>...but to those who kept the flame for over a decade, 

Ha!  Traveller is 20 years old this year, and I\'ve been playing it since
1977.  If you want to consider *Traveller* the flame, then I\'ve been
keeping it since the beginning.  If, OTOH, you consider the flame to be
"One history, one rule-set, one background, one way..or no way." then it
should be extinguished, post haste!  That\'s my opinion, and my herecy. You
can agree or disagree, that is your right.

If what I wrote above offended you, or anyone else, then I apologize for
the offense, but not for the opinion.  I don\'t evangalize my ideas very
often or very much, like some people <g>, but I *will* express them.

>changing the value of skill level x is going to be annoying.

William, that has already happened in T4.  Two is no longer an Average
skill level, it\'s three or four.  Four is no longer an Expert, that\'s gone
up to five or six.  Even Marc is talking about Demolitions-9, for heaven\'s
sake! <g>

CT is gone, MT is gone, and so is TNE.  Embrace the change, and move
on....or get use to being a heretic.  It\'s not so bad once you get use to
it. <G>

As much as I hate to disagree with one of the respected creators of our
favorite game, I have to take issue with this.  Those systems _do_ exist
in the form of all the copies of them that were printed, and are still
circulating in the gaming community.*  While it is true that there are no
new commercial publications specifically for those rules systems, I think
that enough was published for any of the previous game systems to permit
a gamemaster with a judiciously gathered collection to have fun for the
remainder of their natural lifespan.  Traveller has always been a game
involving a high level of "do it yourself" activity, and moving from that
to a system with no current commercial support is not an unthinkable step
for a referee with some experience.

The practical implication of this is that there will continue to be a
base of users of the older systems, and anyone starting up with the game
now is likely to run into users (or former users) of the older rules 
systems.  It would seem that comparisons are almost inevitable.

I hate to start a philosophy discussion when I won\'t be able to check my
email for a couple of days, but there it is...

So what do you do with the 50 extra m^3 your ship has? A displacement ton
is 14 m^3 _not_ 13.5 m^3. Your ship has almost 4 more deck squares worth
of space not accounted for...a tiny number perhaps, but LOTS of smugglers
have gotten by with less ;-)

   Actually I would round down rather than up (7).  Again, to me it\'s a
matter of referee control.  I generally don\'t allow people to generate
characters without my supervision (Nick, you\'re one of the few
exceptions).  Anyone claiming to have randomly generated a character
with stats of FFFFF7 would be laughed out of the room.  Anyone spending
too much time on building up their stats while ignoring skill
development would be told to stop spending so much time on their
hobbies. But then I encourage (cajoule, threaten, abuse, verbally lash)
my players to develop their characters to match a concept, rather than
trying to develop a character to beat the system.

   You do raise an interesting point though.  The way things are handled
in TNE, this problem simply doesn\'t crop up.  Opportunities for stat
development are much fewer and farther between, which may be another
reason that the skill level = attribute point system works so much
better in TNE than it does in T4 (use of D20 rather variable D6 being
the other).  Marc will certainly want to address this in T4.1.

   I like your suggestions a lot, Merrick, they parrallel some thinking
I\'ve been quietly doing on the subject myself.

   One thing I\'d like to point out here, is that we also need to satisfy
KISS in the area of not only _doing_ damage, and applying the effects to
stats, but at least somewhat satisfying gearheads with some realism.

   This leads to the point I want to make: The Babylon Project (recently
released RPG based on B5) has a very interesting and somewhat novel way of
handling combat damage. Combat does damage to characters in two steps:
"immediate" and "final". Immediate damage is abstract, and is applied
immediately - the only two results are "wounded" and "dead", with
"wounded" characters receiving appropriate penalties to their combat
skills until "final" damage is assessed after combat. After combat, final
damage is assessed and applied (eg, broken bones, organ damage, etc) which
may result in much more severe penalties (limited mobility, need for later
surgery, negative modifiers to skills, etc). 

   I think such a system could be created for traveller with little
effort, and could enhance gameplay dramatically.

   In converting from previous versions of Traveller to TNE, converting
old scenarios and sourcebooks rated at the bottom of the list in terms
of complexity (as in it wasn\'t complex at all).  As for CT/MT
compatibility with T4 (well sort of), that\'s wonderful for CT/MT users,
but not so wonderful for users of TNE.  Another reason perhaps that the
TNE folks have felt basically abandoned.

   Speaking as a "TNE Heretic", surprise!  I agree that doubling of the
skill number is not the way to go.  But then if we are looking for
"elegant solutions", varying dice with difficulty level isn\'t either. 
The Star Wars RPG solution, varying dice with *skill level* (the more
skill you have, the more dice you roll) does work.  Classic Traveller\'s
2D6 works.  MT\'s task resolution system works.  TNE\'s D20 system works. 
Enough said.

As a house rule, I used to put severe penalties towards re-enlisting
if a character didn\'t possess certain skills by the end of each term.
This often prevented players from serving another term for the sole
purpose of trying to gain additional stat points.

   A game system continues to exist so long as there is a group of
people playing it.  As for new publications, all of the above systems
have people creating new scenarios, new settings, new equipment, even
new rules for them on a daily basis.  Many of these new items get
distributed through the Internet, some through fanzines, or other
periodicals.  Outside the land of RPGs, Star Trek continued to exist for
years after the original television series went off the air thanks to
fan support--eventually that loyalty was rewarded with a revival.  Some
would even say that CT fans were rewarded for all their loyalty over the
years (hanging on through two changes in the game system) with a revival
of sorts in the form of T4.

   Anyone can pick up a copy of any version of Traveller and compare it
to any other.  That\'s how many of us arrived at the version of Traveller
we\'re playing now: we looked over new items before purchasing them and
made a decision as to whether or not we would convert our campaigns (or
start new ones) based on the new rules system contained in the new
books.  Will the comparison be a fair, unbiased one?  Probably not, but
then most of us have things like cost, time, and peer pressure to think
about.

   As for the "one skill level per year" concept, I really don\'t see a
problem with it.  As a referee, you have to decide at what point you
want your players to stop the character generation process and get going
with the campaign.  Ideally, everyone agrees on a max age or number of
terms.  This serves to limit the number of skill levels any one
character can have, without having to resort to radical changes in the
character generation process.

I feel for you, Joe. My FLGS went out of business a year ago. All the local
stores have converted to comics/card game shops. I have to travel to
another city to get Traveller stuff. The kids in high school these days are
all playing video games or card games.

However, I do a few suggestions:

Create a boxed "Traveller Science Fiction Adventure Game". The box should
contain a ship deck plan, a planetary or subsector map, counters or cards
for a group of vehicles, ships, and characters, a rules book and an
adventure book. The rules book introduces all the basic game mechanics in a
simplified, step by step method. The adventure book is a fixed sequence of
encounters which introduce the player to standard Traveller situations. For
example, meeting a noble patron, arranging passage at a starport,
travelling to another system, getting hassled by megacorp security,
investigating a strange or alternate technology, speculating on
interstellar trade goods, getting involved in a space battle with pirates,
conducting computer or engineering modifications, resolving the mission and
getting rewarded.

Each encounter should be simple and able to complete in an afternoon. It
should be cross-referenced to the rules book whenever a new game mechanic
is introduced, and each encounter should only use mechanics already
introduced. All characters, ships, equipment, and locations should be
pre-generated and described on reference cards or counters. It should be
playable solitaire.

The game should be visually attractive with an index, good layout, and
artwork showing the characters and situations.

The game should assume no previous knowledge of Traveller or role-playing.
It should be possible for some 14-year old kids to unwrap the game, turn to
page 1 of the adventure book, and finish the first encounter that afternoon.

IG was once dreaming about a Traveller movie to ignite customer interest.
Personally, I think a video game would be a better choice. The target
market has greater overlap, science fiction has greater penetration into
the video game market, and the startup costs are lower (though, admittedly,
probably still orders of magniture above IG\'s budget).

Perhaps a better idea is sponsoring a contest for high-school science or
computing students. From my experience this is the #1 breeding ground for
future Traveller players. Products like the adventure game would be prizes.

I don\'t claim all these ideas are original. In fact, the boxed introductory
game is a direct steal from I.C.E.\'s Lord of the Rings Adventure Game. West
End also has an introductory boxed set for the Star Wars RPG. They are good
ideas.

Hey Stephen...I have some ideas for your airship for you to condider:

1)    This is a suggestion that seems to fall (as far as TL) between the
NC (navigate currents) method mentioned and the IC (internal combustion)
ideas that were posted....though you were looking for lowest tech, I\'ll
throw this in just for thought.  The idea is for there to be a
cable/good stout rope extending between any two of your mountain-top
towns.  Wait a minute...this isn\'t as stupid as it sounds at first.  The
cable would lay on the ground between the two towns (imagine the cables
that were laid down across the Atlantic for communications before the
age of satellites....these lay on the ocean bottom).  Such cables/ropes
would be lay there by workers/slaves using something along the lines of
a diving bell.   An airship would wait for the currents to move it in
the proper direction.  It would then lower some anchors.  Workers with
large cumbersome helmets on would be lowered into the "soup" below.
Others workers on board the airship would be working to turn air pumps
that would send the breathable air down into the helmets.  (The pump
would be the highest TL item of this scheme--I beleive it would come
before IC--I don\'t have my rule books to see where it would fall out)
Like deep sea divers they would attach the beginning of a new rope
segment to the end of the existing segment (I guess this could even be
done while on the ship--but IMO the "air divers" make a better story).
They are then hauled up and the ship awaits for the currents which will
push them in the direction they wish to go.  At which point they lift
anchor and move to the next position.  (I got it...in order to keep the
"build ship" from straying to far from coarse in the unpredicable air
currents--"divers" are periodically sent down to anchor the cable to the
valley floor--so even if blown of coarse the ship could "pull" itself
back to its last anchored position.)  Once the other town is reached the
build ship returns along the cable and removes the anchors.  The system
is now ready for general use.  A ship is equipped with closable rings
which can be clasped over the cable.  Workers/slaves then pull on the
rope for propusion.  Enough slack exists in the rope that it rises from
the ground to meet the airship at a safe altitude and then sags back
down to the ground once it is past.  This idea is highly labor intesive
and would probably require a slave or worker caste in society inhabiting
your planet.
Anyway, its just another idea.

Also, for the NC idea:  have certain natives be blessed with "the
gift".  "The gift" would be a psi talent that the natives don\'t even
recognize they have (Much like chirpers from Research Station Gamma).
Certain members of the community are born with the gift and become
airship navigators.  The psi ability gives the user a "feeling" of the
environment around him.  He knows when to drift with the currents to
take them in the right direction and when to lay anchor to ride out
contrary winds.  Just another idea.  The "mysterious natives" theme has
worked well in several of my own campaigns.

Lots of luck!!!

Aside from the fact that it could use a little tweaking, the example
you posted isn\'t really fair.

Somebody with skill-6 (I have to admit I\'m more comfy with CT skills
number wise----I\'d consider a 6 to be a very famous expert.  Anyway,
The table posted wasn\'t mine.  I say that there is no fixed
relationship between skill and task level, just good guidelines.  I
would say that if the task is "extremely hard" (I used
Staggering/Impossible to fit with T4) for a professional (skill-3),
then it would be 3 levels easier for a professional of skill 6.  For
a task that is routine for a skill-1 person, the skill 6 guy should
have automatic success, IMO.

You haven\'t met the number of medicine people I have, obviously :-)

Most medical stuff would be Int dominant, for one.  Ortho guys might
throw in Strength :-)  It\'s been my observation that a lot of the
medical people I know are about average (average for people who
attend university, not the general public).  I guess I\'d say that
I\'d expect higher Int (I know the exceptions, too), and Dex wouldn\'t
be as much of an issue----I have trouble imagining how different a
dex 7 person is from a dex 10 person, actually.

been discussed.

Anyway, I have been thinking about reality lately (a little) and have come
to a few conclusions.  First, someone with skill-4 is going to be able to
do something better than someone with skill-1 almost every time, regardless
of stats.  Second, I have been thinking about people I know who are really
good at something, and invariably they have not only high skill level but
their relevant stat is also high.

As an example, any person with reasonable intelligence can go to tech
school and get medic-1.  No matter how clever they are, they are not going
to be able to do something as well as someone with a medical degree or an
EMT with a a few years experience.  If you were to look around for the
really excellent doctors, you would find a high degree of intelligence and
skill.  The best are not going to be bright kids right out of medical
school or old hacks who have been around forever but have limited
intelligence. Without exception, the best doctors (or attorneys, managers,
riflemen, mechanics, etc.) are all going to have high stats and skills.

As far as a game mechanic, how about limiting skill level by stats?  For
example, you can only attain a particular skill level equal to one-half of
the relevant attribute.  So if you have Intelligence of 8, you can achieve
Medic-4.  Perhaps players could be allowed to proceed above this skill
ceiling if each additional skill level "cost" twice as much.

Although this may be jumping off the deep end of skill v. stat debate, you
could eliminate stats from the task roll (except for things directly
related to stats like breaking down the door, etc.), as they are indirectly
figured in.

Whoops, it should read:
If dieroll >= 2*attribute then SF
If dieroll <= attribute/2 then SS

Or for those of you who doesn\'t like to multiply and divide during combat etc

If successful: Reroll lowest die and if it still is successful a SS occurred
If failure: Reroll highest die and if still failure a SF occurred.

Yes they are. My players convinced a local ruler to use burning arrows on

About the names of tasks/skills I think it is important to keep the names
of skills and equivalent tasklevels similar ie:
Extremely inexperienced  Extremely easy
Very Inexperienced       Very easy etc

My biggest gripe about FUDGE is that there is no tasklevel that is about
50%. I\'ve tried a tasksystem that gave Joe Average 6+ on 2D6 on Normal
tasks and we played an entire boarding action with that and later refought
it with 7+ instead. The differance in feel was quite large and both my
players and me agreed on 7+ being superior.

   Your assumption is that "imbalance" is a bad thing, which is just a
matter of opinion.  The High Guard, Merc, Scout, and Merchant Prince
characters I generated routinely had skill levels as high as 6 and stats
as high 12 (characters with low Int and/or low Edu were routinely tossed
out before generation began because of the totally artifical Int+Edu
stat limit)--that doesn\'t sound all that "balanced" to me.

   As in T4, done that way for sake of simplicity.  As I have indicated
elsewhere, I would have had no problem with some tasks being based on an
average of two stats.

   Sorry, but the actual breakdown is as follows:

Cluster      /   # of skills
Strength     /      14
Agility      /      21
Constitution /      12
Intelligence /      20
Education    /      26
Charisma     /      14

   While Education has the most skills under its cluster, the total
hardly qualifies as a "near majority".  Typically in a TNE gaming
session, characters with high EDU (12+) are eggheads (characters that
are useful up until the moment of combat, when they are best left back
on the ship), or engineers (in which case they are back on the ship
making sure the drives are warmed up for a quick get away).

   Increases in EDU are only possible by attending college or a Hiver
Technical Academy (assuming you can get access to one).  Increases in
EDU amount to a massive +1 (one) per term (+2 for the HTA, and that is a
one time benefit).  Referees have the option to allow a character to
increase their EDU level +1 as their secondary activity each term
(assuming the character is eligible).

   This isn\'t explained all that well.  Initative determines who goes
first in a five second combat round, with high initiative characters
(those with 6+) being able to act twice in a turn.

   As for hit capacity, it is a more detailed way of keeping track of
damage.  I prefer it.  Someone such as yourself who has a bias toward a
simplistic system of determining damage does not.

   All of course in your humble opinion.  I had no trouble with it
(unlike the MT system which I found very confusing), nor has anyone else
I\'ve spoken with who plays the game on a regular basis.  As for the
typeface, some people don\'t like it, and some people do.  Not really a

Sorry for my brainfart.
I should have read it more carefully before posting:
Roll 2D6 <= attribute.
+1D6 for each difficulty level above skill
- -1D6 for each skill level below skill
If dieroll > 2*attribute then SF
If dieroll <= attribute/2 then SS

How about an alcohol engine or a ctalytic sream rocket? What TL do 
you need to be able to make Hydrogen Peroxide? IIRC some of those 
man-portable chopper thingies used catalytic decomposition of 
Hydrogen Peroxide to power them.

It is perfectly fair... as Anders\' post explained it.  You have to
take into account _all_ possibilities to truly see how his idea could
work... I just used the first example that popped into my head.

I agreed pretty much with everything in your first posting of the M.B.
Task system, and even offered a few suggestions (please see Eris\'
"Task System: Four Different Proposals" thread).  Anders Backman\'s
posting, OTOH, used a slightly different method than yours, and I
simply pointed out an error in his proposal.

Phil Kitching made a point about considering 3 sixes as a SF.  I
originally believed that it should be only 2 sixes, since your system
uses the 2d6 Average task as a basis.  I could be persuaded to go the
3 sixes route, though.  I just like the idea for a SF to be possible
for an Average task (3%).  I guess I\'d have to see the numbers
comparing SF as 2 sixes vs 3 sixes to figure out which method I would
prefer.

I do believe, however, that Phil\'s rule for SS (rolling all ones)
makes the likelihood of such a result pretty remote.  Rolling all ones
on 3d6 is a 1 in 216 chance... a little too infrequent to even bother
with in an RPG.  I\'d use "dice totals that are _less_ than the
character\'s skill level are considered SS".

Phil also made a good point about not being able to perform certain
tasks requiring more than 4 dice, or automatic successes taking place
if the number of dice required drops below 1.  This would make my
comment about some tasks requiring upwards of 8 dice a moot point.

At first I was taken with the idea of rolling attribute tests to acquire
skills, but your remarks persuaded me that it was a better idea to ensure
that all characters get roughly the same number of skills for each term
served.

So here\'s an idea for an optional skill-acquisition rule:

   For each skill acquired while persuing a career:
        To pick the skill of your choice from the available skills:
        Difficult test of one of the skill\'s applicable attributes; 
        If success: PC acquires the chosen skill.
        If failure: PC must roll for skill randomly on the same table.

Thus, if a Scout is trying to acquire Astrogation, she would attempt a
Difficult test of her Edu or Int. If she fails the roll (didn\'t do well in
that training course, or didn\'t qualify for it that year), she might still
pick it up by rolling randomly on the same table (she is assigned to some
other training mission). Either way, she gets a skill. But she has to
succeed in the test to get the one she wants.

Another suggestion: put \'Sophontology\' into the Science cluster. I think
Traveller characters should have a chance to know something about the
universe\'s aliens, their culture, psychology, biology, etc.

This also applies to Background skills: if the world has a non-human
population, there\'s a good chance the PC will know their language, or have
some Sophontology skill.

Alternatively, you might institute an "Alien Culture" cluster, which
confers a skill in Aslan Culture, Vargr Culture, etc. Each alien culture
might consitute a cascade skill group: someone with Aslan Culture-2 might
automatically have Aslan Language at Level-1, and vice-versa. Same goes for
Sophontology, which might cascade to several alien cultures and languages,
at the ref\'s discretion.

More thoughts as they come to me...

It has taken me some time to chime in on the task system issue - after
attending Ad Astra in Toronto last weekend (big Faan-type fun) and
grovelling through a vast amount of backlog at my office (no fun at all), I
had a week\'s worth of TML Digests to get through. Am caught up now.

I\'ve been fiddling with task system fixes since the T4 system\'s
inadequacies first became apparent, last autumn. I came up with the D66
Task System, a brilliant stroke of genius which only required players to
re-learn how to add and subtract (in Base-6!) and which was not quite
entirely compatible with T4 (all DMs given in the books had to be
multiplied by 3, FrEx). Okay, so that was a dead loss, but it was an
instructive waste of time...

My thoughts and suggestions: 

Change the weighting of skill vs. stat to a 3:1 ratio, or at least 2:1. Ken
and I independently settled on a 3:1 ratio after much tinkering and
testing, and I like the balance this provides. With this ratio, a
high-stat/low-skill PC can still beat out a low-stat/low-skill PC, but not
an average-stat/high-skill PC...
                                   Target Numbers
                                   T4.1    KBv2.1
  Frank Four:   stat 4, skill 4:    8       16
  Fran Fifteen: stat F, skill 1:   16       18
  Eddie Eight:  stat 8, skill 4:   12       20

...and this, I think, is as it should be. The high stat surely counts for
something, but so does a high skill. Balance is achieved.

I am against balancing stat and skill by changing the chargen system to
produce typical characters with skills in the range of 6 or 9+. By simply
tripling the effect of each skill level, KBv2.0 achieves basically the same
effect -- without having to radically change T4 Chargen (which I think is
pretty cool right now, and getting \'way cooler with T4.1).

I also like the extra granularity KBv2.0 provides. I like Ken\'s idea of
adding EPs incrementally as a Character earns experience or studies new
skills, thus advancing their skills a third of a level at a time. And
though the effect of the various DMs given in the rules is reduced a bit,
they don\'t have to be changed or multiplied (as in my D66 system - too much
granularity!).

Obviously a lot of people like MT\'s system, but I never played MT, so I
can\'t comment on it. Except to say that, at this point, with lots of T4
books already on the shelves, it\'s rather too late to drop the variable
dice idea. It would certainly make a lot of people happy to go back to
something with only two dice - that was part of the motivation behind my
D66 system. But I don\'t object to throwing lots of dice on principle - even
half die if absolutely necessary (which they aren\'t!).

If it\'s decided that the stat:skill ratio should be increased to 1:2 or
1:3, I would recommend strongly against achieving this by dividing the
stat. It\'s *much* easier to multiply the skill than divide the stat. During
combat, stats fluctuate due to injury and recovery, and this math has to be
recalculated with every change. Skills, however, don\'t fluctuate during
game play, so the skill*3 calculation in KBv2.0 only has to be done once,
before the game starts, et voila\' (or "walaa" as Ken would spell it ;). I
note that a MT-style system would also involve dividing the stat, and thus
recalculating the TN after every injury or recovery. I also note that Ken
already tried (stat/2)+skill, with KB1.0, and it proved difficult to get
the probabilities to work out the way we wanted. This problem evaporated
when he switched to stat+(3*skill), in KBv2.0.

For those who don\'t know: KBv2.0 works like this:

   Target Number = Attribute + Experience

   Experience Score = Skill Level x 3

   Determine the task difficulty level and roll the TN or less to succeed:

   Easy           2D
   Average        3D
   Difficult      4D
   Formidable     5D
   Staggering     6D
   Impossible     7D

Yes, that\'s a lot of dice. But none of the other system\'s I\'ve analysed
result in the kind of probabilities we wanted. KBv2.0 does: Impossible
tasks are never a cake-walk, even for PCs with stats of 16 (unless they
also have a high skill!)

For Jack-of-all-Trades: don\'t halve the attribute, just add the Skill level
without multiplying it (stat+skill). This makes JOT a lot less
omni-powerful, as it was in T4, but it\'s still useful.

I don\'t know if I like Ken\'s fix for SS and SF - which basically involves
special TNs for SS and SF. In Derroch\'s game, we\'re using three ones = SS,
three sixes = SF (if anyone rolls three sixes AND three ones - well, we\'ll
worry about it when it happens!). 

For multiple actions: take the lowest TN from the actions attempted, and
divide it by the number of actions.

For default skill throws: just use the full attribute. (Personally I would
suggest a negative DM, depending on the situation.)

NOTE that higher than average attributes are still a great advantage,
especially for Difficult tasks, which are the majority during combat. A PC
with a weapon skill of 1 has little chance of hitting if their Dex is 7,
but a pretty good chance if it\'s 12. KBv2.0 generally gives lower
probabilities than T4 or T4.1 (personally I think T4 and T4.1 are too
\'easy\', so I like this. YMMV).

That\'s enough from me on this topic.

Whatever you decide, Marc, I want to thank you for soliciting to our
opinions on this and other matters. Whatever you decide, I\'m sure the
Deluxe Edition will be a killer book. Can\'t wait to see it.

[a bunch of good ideas regarding an Traveller boxed edition snipped]

I believe Games Workshop (of all people) once released cheap versions
of some of their games with greatly stripped down rules.  The idea was
to design a product that mimicked its big brother (in this case, T4)
at the lowest possible price.  These "minigames" would act as sort of
a springboard towards their mainline games.

Certain things like animal encounters, psionics, starships (combat &
construction), and much of the background can be stripped away,
leaving a core booklet of 20 or so pages consisting of nothing more
than a basic character generation system, a short equipment list, a
subsector map, and a brief adventure.  Basic game mechanics would have
to be identical (including the task system we finally decide upon).
Also included would be examples of some of the additional rules
sections found in the full-sized products.

Such a product would be designed in such a way as to appeal to the
individual curious about RPGs, but lacking the funds to buy the main
rulebook.  A coupon could be included towards the purchase of future
T4 products if the buyer decides that he likes what s/he sees.

This might not have been what Richard had in mind when he started this
thread, but I thought I should speak up, nonetheless.

The real trick would be shrinking the minigame down to the size of a
deck of Magic cards (I\'m kidding :)

No, it\'s the average of the general pop allright. You forgot about the 
aging effects! So the older people and the children are going to have 
lower stats than those "on their peak". That reduces the average back 
to about 7. (Also don\'t forget many characters never roll on the stat 
improv. tables, choosing skill improvement instead!

1.5m*3m*1.5m=6.75. A displacement ton is *two* of these rectangular
solids. In other words, 1 DT is 3m high 1.5 meters wide and 3 meters
long (3*3*1.5=13.5)

Another way of looking at it is that each "square" is one-half ton.

30 displacement tons is *60* squares. Remember, each "square" is *half*
a ton.

By the same logic, as the supplement Library Data A-M is out of print, does that
mean that its contents are no longer canon ? I think not. A lot of CT stuff
is still valid - look
at Snapshot for example. People still design stuff with FF&S et al for T4,
yet "TNE does not exist".

Comparisons with the earlier systems are not only possible, but important
If Traveller is to
improve, we have to ask ourselves if what we have in T4 is actually any
better than what we
had before. If not, then why take a retrograde step ? If it ain\'t broke,
don\'t fix it. MT was not
broken, T4 is.

As for tasks, my belief is that we stick to the MT system or a minor
variant thereof. My
suggestions for such variations are -

* Keep the ability to combine any skill with any attribute, it\'s useful

* Keep the 3-7-11-15-19 sequence, maybe with Staggering at 19 and
Impossible at 23 for
compatibility with already published T4 sources,

* Limit skill levels to 5 maximum, 3 or 4 during character generation. I =
do
this anyway and
no one ever complains. The best way to achieve this is the use of "skill
points" rather like in
2300AD - divide skills up into Primary, Related and Unrelated and set
prices for each skill
level accordingly. That gives a nice balance and removes "Combat
Accountants" from the
game. It also forms the basis of a nice experience system.

* Assume that an average stat of 7 gives no bonus, and use the 3-7-11-15
scale to determine
mods from statistics. ( so 2 is -2, 3-6 is -1, 7-10 is +0, 11-14 is +1,
15-18 is +2 etc ). This
makes Impossible tasks truly Impossible without circumstantial DMs ( Max
skill is +5, max stat
is +2, so +7 - you need a 16+ on 2D for Impossible even if you have Skill=
- -5
and Stat-F. Unless
you get an extra +4 plus from somewhere i.e. a modifier for the situation=
,
you are going to fail ).

* Use the rest of the system as is. That gives us Exceptional Success and=

Failure, the Mishap
table, and the wonderful time increment system as well.

> The objective standard in T4 is that characters get about 1 skill per
year. And skill levels then =

> reflect that idea.

Well, yeah, but you can still do that through skill points to purchase
skills.

Anyway, engage lurking device ! =

[snip]
Well, if you want to get technical remember;

1). Both 13.5 m^3 and 14 m^3 are approximations to begin with.  I\'ll leave
it to more chemically oriented heads to decide exactly how many m^3 are in
a displacement ton of Hydrogen (or is it Deuterium?...and what about water
before refining?)

2). I seem to remember that there is a significant "fudge factor" written
into the rules for making deck plans...maybe 10% or so?  At least this is
the case in MT and CT.

3). If you don\'t like 2). chock it up to "waste space" for hull structure,
tight angles, etc.  which do not count as "usable space" in that a 1.8
meter tall being cannot stand upright or on a level deck.  Of course, as
you point out, these spaces are excellent candidates for "smuggler\'s
holds".  They are also right where I would look if I were an Imperial (or
other) customs inspector.

Personally, I take a relatively vague approximation of the number of
squares as a guideline, and make the deckplans as I see fit based on the
approximate m^3 of the components I installed when I designed the ship in
the first place.

On the scale of a normal PE campaign you\'re propably right. But if you\'re
trying out a variant where the total population is so small that low- and
medium-population planets become important, you should propably let random
events allow for resources changes. There are quite a few examples of
planets and belts where a single raw material was found, causing a huge
increase of population, followed by the strike being exhausted causing the
system to depopulate. I can\'t figure on a way to model that other than by
a temporary increase of resource score. Hmmm... perhaps a comment: "Due to
lanthanum deposits this system counts as Resource 15 for up to 50,000 
people." Propably too complicated...

Information is scanty, but in _Alien Module 3, Vargr_ we hear of a Vargr
wanderer who sometimes between -2800 and -1800 (I could possibly refine
that if I read the information carefully, but I\'ve only had time to skim it)
visited the Zhodani and obtained a Jump-3 ship. He eventually gave it to a
prince who successfully copied it. His neighbors only had jump-2 ships, so
he used the advantage it gave him to found a large (by Vargr standards) 
empire. Knowing the Vargr it seems likely that the new technology would
disseminate fairly fast, so by Year 0 many Vargr would be at least TL 12.
If any of the ones in contact with the Imperium had TL 13, some enterprising
lone Vargr would have sold the Imperium a jump-4 ship fairly quickly (Anybody
believe that the Imperium wouldn\'t be able to obtain a jump-4 ship from the
Vargr in some way?). So the Vargr would range up to 12, but not up to 13.

I\'m not sure if this was common in CT, but MT had some "default skills" in 
which evey 18 yr old knew how to do defore character creation, based on his 
worlds culture and technology. I believe this rule has been caried over into 
TNE and T4 as well.   A pre-Stellar world (TL-7 or 8) would know Computer 
and Ground Vehicle, A belter would know 0-G Environment and Vacc suit and Hi 
tech(stellar) societies would know Grav vehicle but not Ground vehicle. 
Imagine something like in Classic Trek when Kirk didn\'t know what a clutch 
was! :-)

Of course if they wanted to role play someone who never learned to drive, I 
would let them take the \'default\' driving skill and use it as a background 
skill point in something else.  Maybe their world had a mass transit system 
and a low pop (I can think of a domed monrail system on a small vacc world). 
 Anythings possible :-)

<<Well, no. If you have most of the people coming out of
the stat generation (ie you acount for the fact that
stats are non-linear, and so don\'t have as big an
effective range) with numbers that vary just as much
as skill (ie skills are, say 0-6 and most of the
characters have stats in the 4-11 range.) then
skills and stat _are_ equally weighted.>>

I have to disagree. Lets say that stats are mean 8, SD 3. That means
that for the roughly 60% of the population that fall within one SD,
stats vary by a range of seven points. In my opinion your point that
this is the same as skill variability is flawed for two interlinked
reasons.

Firstly skills do not follow Normal bell curve. They are a Poisson
distribution with a mean somewhere around 1. Loads of 0s, a fair number
of 1s and 2s, but precious few 6s. Secondly, you are comparing the
*full*, 0-6 range of skills against a partial range of stats (5-11). A
more appropriate comparison would be a \'typical\' stat range 5-11 versus
a \'typical\' skill range of 0-3.

Even if you inflate the top of the skill range from the CT standard of
5-6 to, say, 9-10 (so the mean goes to between 2 and 3); you will still
find that the \'typical\' skill range is lower than the \'typical\' stat
range because of the way that skills cluster to the left of the curve.
You will have to stretch the top of the skill range a *long* way to the
right to get a typical spread of 0-6.


David:
<<The only reason Dex 7 and skill 4 vs Dex 11 and
skill 1 is seen as a problem is the desire to
see skill weighted more heavily than stats.  But
that is matter of personal opinion.>>

The reason I find this situation a problem is that to me Skill 4 means
\'skilled professional\', whilst skill 1 means \'apprentice/intern\'. Those
numbers are based on CT admittedly, but there are lots of places in the
T4 rules that use skill levels in the same way as they were used in CT
(the revival from cold sleep modifier for Medic-2 is the obvious one).
It doesn\'t jibe with my sense of reality that someone at the top end of
the \'typical\' range in terms of innate talent, should outperform an
averagely talented person who has put the time in and aquired the
equivalent of a professional qualification via training or experience in
the field.

This would be less of a problem if it was declared that Skill 4 isn\'t
anything special, but as I mentioned before there are lots of places in
the T4 rules where the CT assumptions (2 = competant, 4 = skilled, 6 =
notable master) are being maintained.

Round Table Games (to whom I am in no way connected) are having a
special on some Imperium Games stuff.  Their web page is at
http://www.rtgames.com/ -  They also have a selection of cheap 2300
books (which is how I heard about the sale).

I\'ve pasted in the IG section from their catalog so you can see the
prices (\'1 at this price\' must mean 1 per customer, at least I hope so,
or I\'ve just wasted several million electrons).
