Many thanks.

Any ideas on how to do the 400ton scout?  What would you convet from and
what would you use to do the conversion.

Some posible suggestions if you\'re interested.  My current hobby shop has
been in bussiness for several decades now and has made it through some tough
times for the industry.  One thing that has helped them besides being on the
main road out of the largest military base in North America (Fort Brag/Pope
Airforce base) is that they carry more than just games.  They have a large
and diverse model section, some colectables of local interest, Squadron
books, and used games.  The owner also go the extra mile for their
customers.  They have often found old out of print games for me.  Some from
gamers selling their own collection and some form the back corner of some
forgot warehouse.  They also have a \'subscription service\' of sorts.  If I
or another customer find something I want they will hold it for me or order
and hold it untill I return to get it. (Monthly in my case).  I often call
in requests after seeing something here.  They also pull my Dragon magazine
and other new stuff they think I may want JIC.  This \'extra\' service makes
for very loyal customers.  I call them first for anything they carry.

Also the large model selection bring in children and their parrent looking
for both models and knowledgable advice.  Those model customers see all
these other neat things and start shopping for other things...

More than one person came for models, tries some of the board games, and
finally a \'REAL\' game like traveller.  Incrimentallize can work for more
than just political things.  

The senergy of a healthy game store is amazing as everybody wants to help
everybody else learn their favorite game/hobby and with each new game/ hobby
your circle of friends/fellows expands.  Everybody wins.

NOT PHYSICALLY POSIBLE.

I have designed transmiter/reciever sets.  There are physical limits to
turner range and sensitivity.  There are to many diferences to even begin to
discuss between search and targeting radar sets and high sensitivity pasive
detectors.  Your swiss army sensor set is not physically doable without some
form of self reconfigurable nanotech self rebuilding systems.

Here is a simple real world comparision.  Design a device that duplicated
all the functionality of the Hubble telescope, the Harp instalation, an
electron microcscope, an optical 10,000x microscope,  a NMR scaner, lidar, a
search radar, and a targeting radar in a package that will fit in a F15.

The equipment needed to transmit laser, x-ray, gamma rays, and radio waves
are all very physically different and each has a limited tuneable range.

When you can place in front of me a single transducer that can
simultaniously transmit and recieve 1hz, 100hz, 1khz, 10Mhz, 900Mhz, visible
laser, x-laser, and 3.58Ghz. signals over a useful distance (100KW radiated
power per signal band minimum) then you have a chance to convence me.  Note
that \'signal\' does not mean noise.  It mush be capable of modulation.

There is nothing in canon that contradics what I have said.  It is your
assumptions of the range of capabilities on the ems that is overestimated.
Everthing I have seen in canon could be done with a fairly simple sensor set
without all the exotics you have claimed.  Basic combat aircraft radars,
ladar, a good broad band passive reciever similer to today SIGINT systems, a
good telescope with a spectrometer, a set of basic radiation sensors, a
basic braod band transciever set like those used by ham inthusists plus an
add on to cover the Ghz bands, and a decient computer to integrate the parts
and provide some in built expert systems.  Nothing magical or mysterious.
Yes the system has some holes but a fighter and a free trader is not
supposed to carry a full lab with them.  Your gain roles off at the high and
low ends of each band but the system is servicable and can be built small
and cheap enough to be reasonable.  CCD for the telescope, a set of loadable
antennas frame mounted, the search/targeting radars can be designed to share
and antenna, ladar will need it\'s own head, and the radiation sensors can be
surface mounted.

Have I missed anything important here for a basic sensor set?

Sorry, no amount of computer assistance can improve an unaugmented human\'s

the airforce about it.  They have been fighting this problem for 20+ years.

No.  I pity the aerospace fighter that comes up against a purpose built
atmosphereric or space fighter.

There is no free lunch.  For every design decision you make you make another
posibility no longer posible.  That is what is ment by design trade offs.  A
generalist can not win against a specialist in the specialist area of
expertese.  Never play a man at his own game.  An SR71 can\'t dogfight an F15
and the F15 can\'t out race an SR71.

I\'m an EE.  I can work in both systems.  My problem is converting between

I don\'t take them literally, but many supplements and adventures did. For
instance, the _Luuru_, a ship with a crew of 70, had two barons and three
knights in the crew. One of the barons was a marine private!

It is a matter of canon that there are non-inheritable titles. But the
Imperium needs a number of nobles that can be estimated:

If you use a top-down analysis you get:

1 emperor                         =      1
1 archduke per domain             =      6
1 duke per subsector              =    300- (not all subsectors rate a duke)
3-4 counts per subsector          =  1,100+
1 marquis per major world         =  5,000+
3-4 barons per major world        = 17,500+
some more barons for minor worlds =  2,500?

A total of between 20 and 30,000. Add an unspecified number of court and
achievement nobles and you may double or perhaps triple that number. Add
unto that comes an unspecified number of relatives. A lot depends on your
assumptions.

That is eminently reasonable, but that\'s not the way previous writers of
Traveller material have done it. Go though any of the adventures you have
and you\'ll find thugs, belters, rogues, soldiers, sailors, and customs
clercs that have been generated by the unmodified character generation
system.

Incidentally, while younger sons of nobles ought to be over-represented
in the ranks of travellers, holders of titles should be under-represented.
After all, if you\'re an Imperial duke, you ought to have your hands full
governing your subsector and not have time to go gallivanting around the
universe.

That\'s what I\'ve done IMTU, except that I don\'t think you are nearly hard
enough. My social status scale goes up to 33 and the Imperial nobility
don\'t start until level 24:


Description                       Social   Old Terran
				 Standing  Equivalent

Near-noble (Gentry)                 12      Squire
Appointed noble                     13      Knight
Very rich/powerful non-noble        14      Magnate
Hereditary noble, no base           15      Banneret
Town-sized base (1000)              16      Baron
County-sized base (10,000)          17      Count/Earl
Region-sized base (100,000)         18      Marquis/Duke
Province-sized base (1 million)     19      Archduke/Prince
Country-sized base (10 million)     20      King
Empire-sized base (100 million)     21      Emperor
Continent-sized base (1 billion)    22      [No equivalent]
World-sized base (10 billion)       23      [No equivalent]

[I modify the above according to various factors to account for prevailing
Imperial prejudices:

Pre-industrial society   -4      Sovereign ruler                 +1
Industrial society       -2      Elected or appointed official   -1
Pre-stellar society      -1      Heir to position                -1
Early Stellar society     0      Younger children                -2
Average Stellar society  +1
High Stellar society     +2      Minor non-human race            -1

All modifications are guidelines only. Positions that reach 24 and above
will almost invariably recieve an Imperial noble title (So the ruler of a
planet with billions of citizens and a High Stellar technology would be at
least an Imperial marquis, propably more.]
		

Imperial titles:

Knights (various orders and levels)  14-23
Baron                                  24
Marquis                                25
Freeholder                             26
Count                                  27
Scion                                  28
Duke                                   29
Senior Duke                            30
Archduke/Prince                        31
Crown Prince                           32
Emperor                                33


Freeholder was a leftover from the days of the Sylean Federation. It was
never awarded by the 3rd Imperium and by 1100 there were only four remaining
freeholders. Consequently most people had never heard of the title. Scion
was a title given to the children of Imperial princes and princesses who
didn\'t have another title of their own. The children of scions were not
automatically Imperial nobles. If, for example, Paulo III had not given
his brother Asan a dukedom, Asan would still have been a prince, but his
daughter Cassir would have been a scion and her daughter Margaret would
not have been a noble (Though in practice both Cassir and Margaret would
almost certainly had marrired high nobles). As it is, they were both
duchesses. Since most Imperial princes and princesses did recieved fiefs
of their own or married nobles, the title was never used much.

[I introduced the freeholder and the scion so that one could easily convert
from my system to the official by simply halving the numbers (rounding up).
This will cause Imperial nobles to have the correct Social Standing according
to the official system. You\'d still have to device some new way to roll
Social Standing for PCs and NPCs, since the planetary nobility would occupy
the levels from 7 to 11, so if you rolled SS with two dice, you\'d have a
society with more than half of the population nobles!]


And here\'s a small vignette to round off. Unfortunately I\'m a lousy artist,
so you\'ll have to settle for a verbal description:

At a brilliant gala ball. An unshaven slob of a marine in a dirty uniform
is stuffing his face with small dainty bits of food piled high on a plate
in his hand. A stereotypical dowager duchess in a gorgeous ball gown is
looking at him through her lorngette. Between them stands a diplomat type
in coat and tails (or, since this is science fiction, perhaps he is wearing
a formal jump suit (a jump suit with dress clothes printed on) and
introduces them to each other. Text: "Your Grace, may I present to you
Arnold, Baron Travesty. His Lordship is a private of marines on the

world.  Precendent says that they will genocide the colonists if they
succede in reaching the world.  All that is there is a small battlefleet and
a reasonably mean TL11 battlestation
.
        When you cut the level of abstraction down as you describe, the Bad
Guys jump immediately to the ISZ and then straight to the SDZ around the
planet.  Great.  What game mechanic is in place that says they have to
actually attack the defending fleet?  IE:  Once they are within 50000km of
the world, what rules mechanic is in place to say that they have to defeat
the defense fleet before bombing the world?  
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
At the level of abstraction I\'m using, all defenders in the main world SDZ
would be in one fleet - including the Main World and any significant
satellites. If the main world has no defenses or weapons it would start
in the reserve, and couldn\'t be attacked until the defender ran out of 
functional fleet. Of course, the main world couldn\'t choose engagement
ranges or break off - engagement would start at long range, then move
to short range. Considering that you can jump to 100 diameters, your
defense fleet won\'t have much time to stop them anyway.

When I\'ve completed the first draft of Fleet Tac I\'ll have to pay careful
attention to defense of worlds - images of an enemy bomber squadron
slipping past your destroyers as they fight for their lives against an
enemy light cruiser squadron.

Michel again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
        Logically, the defenders would engage the incoming warships from the
edge of the SDZ, to allow as early an engagement as possible.  However, with
space being loosly defined as "bigger than really, really big", and
engagements really only taking place by mutal consent, how does your concept
handled "end runs" instead of "break throughs"?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Some of that will be covered by pursuit and interception rules that I\'m
working on (based on Maneuver instead of Agility for operational scale
purposes). Space is big, and it\'s hard to be sneaky, so end runs will
be hard to pull off if the defender doesn\'t have as far to go as you do.

        What would happen is rather much like current naval doctrine of
"SAG"\'s (Surface Action Groups).  You spread your defenses out over the area
by priority...  really, who *cares* if he refuels?  Sure, its a great
opprtunity to bushwhack at cruiser with an SDB, but otherwise, what
difference does it make?  Since the only thing that can hurt a cruiser+
sized vessel is a spinal mount, and they pile so many hits on in one shot,
not to mention criticals, a full fuel tank can become an empty tank in one
soild hit anyway.  If he tries to escape by jumping out, ok, he can\'t use
any energy-consuming weapons and you get to pound on him unanswered.  This
is hardly a bad thing.  
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
One thing that can hurt a cruiser is an SDB that jumps it at the worst
possible moment during gas giant refueling ops. No shields, no agility,
no effective computer advantage, most weapons useless...owie.

If your objective is to defend a main world, giving the enemy the ability
to retreat can save your life. If your job is to keep his Vengeance Fleet
from refueling at your frontier world so he can jump deeper into your
empire for commerce raiding, your defense focus changes. If your
objective is to pin down and destroy his fleet rather than drive it off, 
interference with refueling becomes critical.

Michel again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>
<snip>

        For system interdiction, then perhaps the battle for the gas giant
will become the meat grinder and not the main world.  Most major systems
will be able to survive just fine for considerable time with interstellar
trade interdicted.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Eventually I\'d like to put together some good rules for planetary defenses.
Some way to make seiges possible - the attacking fleet doesn\'t dare send
it\'s capital ships within 10D of that well-defended main world, so they
orbit at 70D and whack any incoming or outgoing vessels. The defense
fleet hangs out at 10D or less, within range of the planetary meson
emplacements, ready to intercept any cocky enemy commando
raids. What breaks the stalemate?

Thanks for the input Michel.

TNT now says they\'ll air the 13 episodes filmed, and who knows? Maybe SF
channel will pick it up or one of the other cable networks. Maybe Warner\'s own
network (?). 

On the plus side, the B5 page that I refer to the most
(http://www.midwinter.com/) has a note that the B5 episodes should (finally!)
make it onto DVD (I\'ve not bought the VHS tapes figuring that I\'d just re-buy
them on DVD if I did!). See that web-page cited for that news, news on Crusade

NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif.--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--March 2, 1999-- Netter 
Digital Entertainment Inc. (Nasdaq:NETT - news) Tuesday announced that 
``Crusade,\'\' a new television series based on the ``Babylon 5\'\' 
franchise produced by the company for Warner Bros., has been scheduled 
to begin airing nationally on TNT on June 9, 1999. 

Douglas Netter, chairman and chief executive officer of Netter Digital 
Entertainment, said that production of the first 13 episodes of 
``Crusade\'\' is nearly complete. He added that TNT has elected not to 
purchase additional ``Crusade\'\' episodes at the present time. 

``While we expect to win production contracts for other television and 
motion picture projects soon, and hope that \'Crusade\' ultimately will go 
back into production, this decision by TNT will affect our financial 
results unfavorably during the current quarter,\'\' Netter said.

The problem with this is that drives of this sort have a well-defined energy
requirement, which can be quite high (though still lower than for a reaction
engine for the most part) -- it is equal to <thrust in newtons> * <velocity

        World defense almost has to be the building block for this level of
a system...  after all, in most cases if this is not to be "Jutland In
Space" where the objective was to smash the oppositions line of battle
Because Its The Thing To Do, then the world is the target.

        Where in HG does it actually say this?  I don\'t recall ever having
read this.  Many implications of this sort of condtion, but I don\'t remember
anywhere explicit.

        Ok, that makes sense.  However, in the Vengeance Fleet scenario,
that frontier world isn\'t going to have anything capable of slowing down a
battle group anyway.  My understanding of IN doctrine has been to pile the
defenses around the high-pop, high-tech worlds and strike back from there.

        Well, in medieval seige warfare, the siege usually ended when either
reienforcements arrived and attacked the attackers, or when betrayal opened
the backdoor and let the attackers in.  Otherwise, they were long, boring,
messy affairs.  Once in a while, the attackers would wind up stricken with
diesease and would use a trebuchet to hurl the dead bodies over the wall in
a crude attempt at biological warfare on the defenders.

        As far as 70D, thank God (Allah -> Zeus, inclusive, take your pick)
that this isn\'t GT or some jerk like me would build a dozen meson sites with
30-mile tunnels that would convert something out at the asteroid belt to a
plasma cloud.  =)

        As far as CT is concerned, this is where Big Assed Missiles (BAM)
might be of concern...  the main world can turn over part of its industrial
production towards building MSTO thermonuclear missiles to "shell" the
attackers with and force them further away from the 70D limit....

        The planetary fleet, I would guess, would spend a lot of its time
doing hit-and-runs against the Enemy battle fleet.  Kill them one ship at a
time...  after all, the main world can repair & replace..  the Enemy cannot.

        So, to break the "siege", the attackers have to start hurling
asteroids until the mainworld decides that the ante is to high and folds.
Or, the defenders have to get re-enforced by an out-system strike fleet, at
which point the attackers are sandwiched between planet-based monster
weapons an a very grumpy strike fleet.  Or, the defenders have to have paid
for those meson sites\' targeting systems to go down at a crucial moment.

The byproduct depends on the type of fusion reaction being caused.  For
hydrogen fusion, it is typically helium and free neutrons.  The quantity of
helium is quite low, and is probably removed by the power generation process;
if you want a closed system, a typical plant can probably store ten years of
helium byproducts without significant effort.  The free neutrons are also
ideally absorbed by the power generation systems, though they have a bad habit
of going off and inducing radiation in the structure of the reactor.  There
isn\'t such a thing as a \'real world fusion reactor\', but experimental designs
probably use a pump to clean the chamber.  Plasma is a state where a
significant number of the molecules in a gas have their outer electrons
stripped off; the result is electrically conductive and opaque.  It naturally
happens at high temperatures.

Depends on the design.  It isn\'t a big problem however you do it, though, since
there isn\'t very much of it.  It\'s probably removed during annual maintenance.

There are, but I don\'t recall offhand exactly what they are -- I think it\'s

Since Jump is definitely in the Fiction part of this Science Fiction game
<g>, I guess any reasonable explanation will work.  It\'s just not something
that had crossed my mind before...(and an evil GM could easily make this a
nightmare for some unlucky PC\'s if he decides to roll for each ship.)

Agreed.  I think the timing element would be very critical.  In most games
I\'ve seen that conduct strategic movement, you have to plot out several
turns in advance, and if you haven\'t allowed for jump variances, you could
very easily \'lose a fleet in the shuffle.\'  <g>

IMTU, all marines start as E-1s.. there is no Academy.  The Duke of Lunion
served as a one-term Marine, and is still proud of his Corporal stripes.

What would be far more interesting, is for the Private (an Armsman/3 IMTU)
to be dressed in mufti, and being introduced to an Admiral of the fleet,
who fawns over the noble..  "And, my Lord, what has been occupying your

        So, now here is the Cr64,000 question:
        If an AHL can\'t conduct combat in a gas giant, why should an SDB be
able to?

        If its just the issue about having to stick to a certain course for
refueling, would not the wise fleet admiral simply insist on his escorts
riding shotgun on the group of ships refueling...  the SDB then has to pick
a fight with a couple of combat-ready escorts to get a shot at the vessels
refueling (escorts in LOB, refueling vessels in reserve).

  Wouldn\'t it be simpler (and possibly more accurate, at least to current
TCS rules) to allow one TCS turn transit from Outer to an SDZ or SDZ to
Outer? BTW, are all SDZ\'s required to be de facto Inner?
>>>>>>>>>>>>
The alternating movement and combat phases in Fleet Ops all take place
during the combat phase of a single TCS turn. Where TCS makes it one big
battle, Fleet Ops breaks it up into skirmishes. You repeat Fleet Ops
movement/combat phases until the situation is decided, just like you
repeat HG combat rounds until the situation is decided.

Moving to the Outer System represents breaking off for deep space,
the same effect gained in HG/TCS by breaking off by acceleration.

The Inner System location for ships is an abstraction for movement
purposes. It represents being in space and going somewhere, rather
than getting far, far away from everything and hiding (the Outer System).
Thus all SDZ\'s are de facto "Inner" in that the Outer System is outside
everything in the system important enough to fight over.

Imperium assumed safe GG refueling in friendly or unopposed systems,
even if non-military enemy ships were there - you could refuel and jump
again in zero time as far as the game scale was concerned. You had to
stop in a system with any enemy warships, though you could leave
during the next movement phase.

The multiple system boxes in Imperium didn\'t represent multiple worlds
around the same star, they represented binary star systems with 
a main world around each (such as Alpha Centauri). The game effect
was the same as if the planets had been around the same star - except,
perhaps, that two planets around the same star might be able to shoot
planet-mounted weapons at each other.

He\'ll need escorts designed for fighting in a GG, which any wise fleet
admiral will have. There are things that are quite useful in a deep-space
fleet engagement (spinal mounts, missiles, rotating turrets) that you just 
can\'t use while passing through atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.
SDB\'s in a gas giant atmosphere will stow missiles, lock turrets
forward and fly like a fighter - it only has to worry about the few of your
ships that can do that as well.

There are also issues with maintaining formation (close enough to
intercept that incoming flight of SDB\'s, far enough away so the 
turbulence of that friendly AHL doesn\'t toss your little escort around).
Strangely enough, the SDB\'s will have similar issues - close enough
formation that the flight of SDB\'s can work together, far enough apart
that they won\'t bonk each other. In space, formation flying is all
physics and can be very precise - in the weather patterns of a gas giant,
your ship might move tens (or hundreds) of meters thataway over the
next few seconds.

My rules will allow for the difference between ships that are scooping
fuel and ships that aren\'t, but the major effects of a gas giant will be to
remove just about every advantage a big ship has over a little one.
This will make little SDB\'s a major threat in the depths of a gas giant.

It will not be on the WB, already saw somewhere on a reliable web site

Babylonian Prodictions INC already has a distribution contract with

        So, really, what you get into is fighters armed with nukes as
BARCAP, backed by a missile-bay packing destroyer.

        Hmmm.....  perhaps a piloting roll required per ship in the
formation to avoid taking 1d-1 surface hits.

        Ok, but what about armor?  USP19 is USP19, and an SDB isn\'t going to
crack it without a spinal mount that the AHL isn\'t allowed to use in the GG....

USP 19? I\'m using HG 2nd edition, the highest armor you\'ll see on a

I\'m working on it. I want a mechanic that isn\'t a specific, special rule

Except we are talking about pumping in *tons* of Hydrogen - shouldn\'t the

[blush] I am aware that we haven\'t *quite* reached the fusion era...I was

I\'d been considering no *missiles* as well - or would there be no problem

If missiles still work, that would be a reason for that BB to have that

A JTAS article talked about carrying missiles optimized for use underwater
(torpedoes). Would there also be missiles optimized for use in a GG
atmosphere? If so, that would be another factor encouraging dedicated
SDB\'s. It might also encourage dedicated escorts optimized for
protecting refueling ops.

        C\'mon, Walt, you are rapidly arriving at a situation where the only
thing they can do is look at each other menacingly through the
port-holes....  =)
        Lasers should not...  missiles should.  However, at those ranges,
they will practically be direct-fire weapons.

        If it is an issue, then yes, of course they would.  Otherwise, you
are naught more than spam and shrapnel once the ship *with* them gets done
with you.

Assuming you believe that jump drives actually fuse the hydrogen, sure.  Since
a ton of hydrogen, fused, is equivalent to a gigaton nuclear weapon, and with a
0.1% inefficiency (wildly optimistic) will instantly vaporize the ship, some of
us don\'t believe that jump fuel is fused (or if it is fused, it isn\'t fused in
the reactor, but by some esoteric jump-space phenomenon).  For the most part,
fusion plants in Traveller should mostly output raw hydrogen, since they use
orders of magnitude more fuel than can possibly be accounted for by their power
output.

Time to toss in my .02crs here.

Ok, what is a gas giant?

A big ball of atmosphere that\'s prone to big mother storms!

Atmosphere with serious attitude!

Ok, so mayby skimming is like storm riding a class 5 hurricane and then
some.  The traveller equivilent of surfing a Tidle wave or white water
rafting.  Any ship with lest than a stream lined hull is in for a beating
(AHL was parital streamlined emergence refueling only).

When you go gas diving you have to \'lock everything down\' to keep it
attached.  So turrets get locked into position, bays closed, exec.  You
would NOT want to fire a spinal in that pea soup.  All the energy gets
dumped into the atmosphere right there in front of you for you to fly
through UNLESS you have a meson gun.

Also missle life span is likely to be short and guidence questionable.

So let look at AHL with these assumptions.

She\'s lost her fuel shuttles and is alone.  She dives for the fuel to keep
running in \'locked down\' mode (All turrets pointed in one direction,
probablly aft), bays closed, ect.  In come the SDB also locked down but much
smaller and more manuverable because they are streamlined.  They past
forward and above the AHL so their back facing turrets bear and cut loose.
No defensive fire is posible so the AHL has to eat the missles.  The SDBs
are close enough that guidence is not a problem and the AHL can not return
fire in locked down mode with the SDB out of arc.  It is already struggling
with it\'s limited streamlining.  She tries to pull out and run with the fuel
she has but with the gapping holes from the missles, the pressure, and
winds, the gas giant finishes what the SDBs started which was their plan.

New rule, lock down for gas giant skimming.  Turrets secured pointing back,
bays closed, locks sealed, passengers and crew straped in, breakable
secured, tray tables in the up right possion...

Could also be that most fighters are to fragile to survive a skim pass.
Perhaps all that armor on the SDB is there for more than one reason.  Could
also be the fighters were not designed to withstand high atmospheric
pressures the the SDB can.  Or are so light they get blow arrond to much.

As for why she did not have escorts with her in the skim...she left them
behind previously.

There\'s no reason why meson guns can\'t be used through
a gas giant\'s atmosphere unless you rule sensors of any
kind can\'t operate within a gas giant\'s atmosphere.

Assuming you\'re using a design system which allows
it, build some stealthed vehicles with a completely
enclosed meson gun mount rated at as high a power
output as you can manage and with a very short range
(say, 500 miles). They need just enough of a maneuver
drive to move slowly against the atmospheric currents,
if desired.

Dump a few in a gas giant to float around on
their own CG drives and wait for a fleet to
show up. Make \'em robotic in nature and you
have meson gun mines. Put them in the relatively
calm areas of the gas giant\'s atmosphere, forcing
hostile ships to skim through nasty atmospherics,
and let nature take its course.

This subject has been kicked around a few times on the list; the rules
don\'t address fleet jump duration problems expressly.  We do know that
"[j]ump takes 168 hours ([plus or minus] 10%) to complete."  Marc W.
Miller, "Jumpspace," 24 JTAS 34, 34.  

Further, "One of the enefits of the jump drive is controllability; jump
is predictable.  When known levels of energy are expended, and when
certain other parameters are known with precision, jump drive is
accurate to less than one part per ten billion.  Over a jump distance of
one parsec, the arrival point of a ship can be predicted to within
perhpas 3,000 kilometers (on larger jumps, the potential error is
proportionally larger)."  Id. at 34-35.  

Finally, "[t[he duration of a jump is fixed at the instant that jump
begins, and depends on the specific jump space entered, the energy input
into the system, and on other factors.  In most cases, jump will last a
week."  Id. at 36.

From the foregoing -- especially the fact that jump duration "is fixed
at the instant that jump begins" -- we must conclude that ships cannot
precisely coordinate their arrival times, although they can precisely
coordinate their arrival locations.  Note that I say "precisely
coordinate" -- certainly ships of the same class in a fleet will use
identical computer programs to run their identical jump drives at
exactly the same time when entering jump space, and thus will minimize
the differences in jump duration. Nevertheless, a fleet consists of
several different classes of ship (see, e.g., Fifth Frontier War), and
even in the best case scenario, each different class of ship will have a
different arrival time -- the cruisers, the battleships, the missile
frigates, etc.  

This is one of the benefits of battle riders in the old battle rider vs.
battleship debate:  because the battle riders are attached to the
carrier, and the carrier is doing the jumping, the battle riders all
arrive at the same time.  

So how do we play Fifth Frontier War or Trillion Credit Squadron?  If
the fleet is going to attack the main world, I think its ships must jump
into the target system at some predetermined "Point X", hich can be
fixed with considerable precision, and which is a long way (but still
less than a week my maneuver drive) from the main world. There, the
fleet waits until it\'s sufficiently assembled, and proceeds by maneuver
drive to the main world.  During these times -- while waiting or on the
way to the main world --  a defending fleet may be able to attack the
invading fleet.  

If the fleet is just going to refuel at gas giant(s) and move on, then
Point X will be just outside 100 diameters of the gas giants, and the
ships will refuel as they arrive.  When everyone has jumped in and
refuelled, the fleet will assemble at Point X (or some other point) and
jump to the next target.  Defenders in the gas giant(s) may of course
attack, and other defending ships may have been stationed around the gas
giant(s) or may be able to come from wherever they are to attack.

It was more a question of maneuverability than any kind of

ranges would be so short in a GG atmosphere that the usual
aiming techniques for a spinal mount would be useless -

was pointing when the Meson Gun went off.

Yes, I know HG Meson guns get +2 to hit at short ranges.
I\'m talking about "sit on your lap" short, not "visual range"
short.

Two questions about meson guns, though:

Do you have to point the tube in the direction you want
to shoot? Can you make a meson tube with an angle shot
capability, perhaps by putting a bias in the beam while
still inside the tube?

Does the end of the tube need to be open? Is there any kind
of energy that needs to be discharged, or can you fire a meson
gun through a meter or so of aerodynamically contoured hull?

True, but will all the atmosphere be is such turmoil?  I would postulate
that by the time we will need to answer this question in game time, we will
have developed some sort of weather radar to determine the clamer spots in
the GG.  Naturally this is where the defenders might be lurking, but it
might give a calmer refueling run.

Another good weapon might be either fusion guns or PAWs (not sure wheter
charged or neutral - always get them confused).  A pack of fusion gun
atrmed fighters (the Zho Kia comes to mind from Adv. Class Ships 1 by FASA)
might really ruin someones day. 

I also disagree about the "locking down of turrets", if only in the CT/MT
OTU.  Based on the illustrations as posted, all they had was a port to
either emit the laser beam or launch the missile.  

>Also missle life span is likely to be short and guidence questionable.

Perhaps, perhaps not.  If you arm your missile with a good densitometer and
have it acquire the target before launch, you should stand a reasonable
chance of hitting the target.  Granted, the missiles might be larger than
their spaceborne cousins, or perhaps trade endurance/warhead size for
structural strength.

This might work fine on a ship that did not have meson bays but against a
ship with them it would certainly change the situation.

This does not tie in with previously published sources.  Certainly the SDBs
recieved the most favorable ratings, but fighters and other military ships
also rated quite well. (Secret of the Ancients)

I remember reading a book by Michael McCollum, Clouds of Saturn, which
dealt with the colonization of Saturn using sealed domed cities under giant
balloons.  They moved with the eddys and currents of the atmosphere and
were at an altitude where a minimum need of heating and cooling was needed.

This is much how I pictured it.  Although it hadn\'t occurred to me that
ships of the same class would be able to coordinate their arrival times more
closely.  This does allow commanders some ability to determine the arrival
_order_ of ships within the fleet.  Depending on circumstances, arriving
in-system could be a very shaky situation.  (This is where some great
adventures could occur.)  I think this adds much to the game.  Thanks for
the great info...

Based on deep sites which rotate the entire weapon to point at a target,

If you have a deep site several hundred meters or more located underground
that can still reach out touch the enemy, I\'d have to say that the magic
8-Ball would point to yes.

That\'s what I thought based on the handwave physics explanation, but
it doesn\'t match any of the artwork for starship designs. The Tigress
even keeps fighter ops to aft so none of them will get hurt by the
discharge from the beam.

Does the Deep Meson Site have a longer tube for secondary energy
dispersal that a spaceship doesn\'t use - the spaceship just vents
this waste energy out the spinal mount tube? If that\'s the case, there
could be a problem with firing a meson spinal while going hypersonic
through a gas giant.

In GURPS, the quantities are small enough that you don\'t need to.
In Traveller the plasma, after the heat has been extracted from
it, is presumably just vented to space.

This is an assumption that a number of TML\'rs (myself
included) make. I don\'t believe it\'s documented anywhere
one way or another but a *small* bias is usually
acceptable.

>Does the end of the tube need to be open?

Based on all versions of Traveller, the *only*
thing that will interfere with a meson gun discharge is
a meson screen. Therefore, \'no\'.

>of energy that needs to be discharged, or can you fire a meson
>gun through a meter or so of aerodynamically contoured hull?

Since a meson weapon is effectively a particle
accelerator, one of the TML particle physics
gurus would give a better answer but I\'d say
\'no\'.

In fact, in the campaign I\'m currently running
in, we\'ve done exactly this. We powered up the
meson gun on the Artifact ship in our hold and
surprised the heck out of the Berserker target
(just before it catastrophically detonated).
Of course, the local Navy is now very insistent
that the ship and crew be its guests at their
base for a celebration in our honor.

I\'ve test designed some ships (big ones, say 50k dt) to see the difference,
and it\'s massive.  Fuel tankage for a large warships G-turns is very
significant.  I\'m able to have enormous increases in weaponry and armor w/ T-

It seems to me that this is an argument in favor of battleriders (as
opposed to battleships), since a whole lot of them can arrive at once.
Perhaps a super-tender that carries not only normal ship-of-the-line class
battleriders but also smaller craft (destroyers, escorts, etc.)?  

Alternatively, you jump your fleet to a point a few days travel away from
the target, and let the fleet assemble.  Then, proceed to the target in
realspace.  This kills the element of surprise though...

That would be nice if we had the same rules as when Traveller started (and if
they were decent and flexible enough to be applied to situations that require
more detail), but I\'d wager it\'s a large majority that don\'t use CT rules
anymore (though maybe not as large on the TML).   To avoid this misperception,
in the future, I\'ll just refer to the Previously Published Setting, maybe.
;-)  Nah, canon is shorter.  The TML has been a mixed mechanics lot for a long
time.  So when you say "canon" you\'re referring to the rules?  I\'m referring
to the setting, not the adventures.  The adventures are like snapshots into
the setting (and themselves laughable in places, as your sig quote from
Kinunir illustrates).  The rules are just for interaction (and flawed in
allowing ships to have no internal tankage, that\'s clearly not the intent of
the ship design rules).

Ahem.  The Gazelle *has* internal tankage.  It\'d be easy enough, for anyone
interested, to calculate how many m3 of fuel the gazelle uses and figure out a
more detailed Jump theory for their own TU.  So far we\'ve still only seen the
gazelle in \'official\' material w/ drop tanks, right?

The CT rules hardly imitate you use every last drop of fuel when u initiate

fuel required less.  Course, that can possibly be handwaved away by saying
it\'s a new tech, but how long have the Gazelle\'s been around?  Supp 9 would
lead one to believe they\'ve been around awhile...

Yes.  And only in a bad way if there\'s a quirky theory of J-drive in place.
Otherwise, they barely rate mention, much less use in design.

lol.  You make it seem like i\'m interested in bursting peoples bubbles.  Noone
is going to ritually burn these TCS designs nor hunt down and heap scorn upon
their designers.  As far as these designs are concerned, I\'m far kinder than
the people who don\'t allow drop tanks period, no Ifs, Ands, or Buts.

It means the Gazelle (the only canon drop tank design) is still "legal" (and
makes sense).  Maybe it needs to be the same proportion of drop tank fuel to
internal tankage.  Maybe it\'s an exponential equation.  It could be anything.
I think that\'s good, as it allows each of us to do different things w/ our
TUs, yet maintain a relationship w/ the OTU.

I\'d also like to see T5 take some initiative and set something down, as
regards drop tanks, that doesn\'t involve revisionism in abolishing the design,
nor needlessly chiseling J-drive in stone.  A reprinting of the Jumpspace
article would be fine (maybe in a J-space/J-drive supplement of some kind...
that\'s never been done).  We\'ll see.

That\'s why you need to coordinate jumps.  IIRC, there was something from MT(?)
where it doubled the jump calculation time.  My house rules have a couple
levels.  Coordination is having task force ships work their own calculations
off\'ve a designated \'flagship\' and then going.  There is still variance (due
to each ships different equipment, etc, mostly).  The supreme level is a
"slave jump" where each ship slaves itself to the computers of the flagship
(cross checking the single jump calculation to the componets of every ship).
Every ship appears in exactly the same relationship at exactly the same time.
Duration of calculation can get very long with large numbers of ships.  

In any case, it\'s easier to jump to the far far outsystem (say 1 billion km),
where it\'s extremely unlikely there will be any native defense, to get a gauge
on the defenses, refuel (tanker or cometary bodies, etc), and then come in
coordinated (or IMTU, slave).

How did I KNOW you were going to say that?  LOL.  Unfortunately, I doubt
you\'ve designed a TL-15 set.  Nor even a TL-10 set.  If you have, I\'d like to
help underwrite your R&D and we can all get rich.  :-)

That self reconfigurable nanotech might be how it all works.  ;-)  Remember,
we\'re talking about TL-15 (a Rampart).  Now, canon says EMS sensors are TL10+.
That\'s the 22nd century IIRC.  Come back in a hundred years and tell me that
again.  lol

You\'re the one saying the Rampart isn\'t going to be able to use it\'s EMS
sensors in the atmosphere.  All previously published material says it will.
It\'s a ground interface craft that is also a space fighter.  I\'m not making
any assumptinos, just reading out of one of my handy Traveller books.  The
specifics (EMS covering everything above) is limited to the DGP SoM IIRC.
I\'ve never seen it anywhere else, anyways.  The SoM says "Finally, by late
tech level 10, most cultures use computer cross-correlation to integrate a
variety of electromagnetic sensors into a single sensor array."  That\'s the
EMS array.  Keep in mind they\'re massive at TL-10 (By FF&S, the 300,000km
active set on the Rampart, if it was TL-10, would be 26m3 and mass 52 tonnes).
Now, by TL-15 they\'re getting pretty small (the Ramparts active set is 3m3 and
6 tonnes)...  

Don\'t argue w/ me about it.  You don\'t like it, don\'t use it.  It\'s canon,
though and you want to have "official" Traveller space fighter vs aerospace
fighter, you\'re gonna have to swallow it.

The AF is TL-8.  TL-7 20 years ago.  Like I said, we\'re talking about a
*TL-15* Rampart.  Reread what I wrote, please.  7 TL\'s and a few thousand
years give great liberties to science-fiction, no?  ;-)

You keep saying that, but I\'ve witnessed so many gaming combats that go
against it.  I\'m gonna have to ask you to put up or shut up.  I\'ll trust you
to be honest on your own, since we don\'t have compatible design systems.
Using GV2, design the best aerospace or atmospheric fighter you can, and then
the best space fighter you can.  The original example was TL-9 vs TL-15, but
whatever u wanna do (I think u\'re leaning on TL-15 vs TL-15).  Run a combat w/
someone (who\'s not a moron).  Post us the designs and tell us the result.

Well, according to G:T, any spinal mount (whether Meson or PAWS) can fire
forward into an area 3 hexes wide and however many hexes long.  This means
it can hit things in an area 6000 miles across.  That seems to indicate
that yes, some aiming capacity is present.  Whether this is by playing with
the field (probably), literally rotating the tube inside the ship
(unlikely), or just quickly rotating the whole ship (in 20min turns, this
is possible) is not defined.

There was an article in one of the JTAS issues that talked about the
difference between PAW and Meson weapons.  Basically it said that a
Meson weapon was two PAWs that have an intersecting point beyond the
muzzle, and the intersection of the two PAW streams produced the Mesons.
 Therefore, you would indeed need to have the tubes open to shoot.  I
believe FF&S defined a spinal mount as being able to aim several degrees
off axis.

The measured Radial Velocities of the nearest stars very roughly average out to
about 50 km/s (ranges from about 3 to 108 km/s)

The absolute relative velocity could well be double this, at say 100km/s. You
may also want to add in the orbital velocities of the source and target planets
to add another 50 km/s or so. Giving an average difference of around 150 km/s to
match.

This sounds _huge_, but it isn\'t when compared to the accelerations of traveller
ships. 
Indeed it could well be one of the reasons traveller ships need such huge
accelerations.

A 1G drive ship will exceed 100km/s in its journey to 100 diameters from an
earth size planet (with turnover).

Selecting appropriate exit vectors from the source planet and entry vectors to
the destination planet will also greatly reduce the velocities to be matched.

Matching velocities, choosing appropriate exit and entry vectors, plotting
relative orbital motions, etc., can all add to colour - if you and your players
want it.  Otherwise the basic transit times are useful approximations for ease
of gameplay.

Incidentally adding this mechanic automatically rules out very low thrust, low
cost, commercial ship designs.

the usual maximum). A ship at 1g can match this sort of velocity
difference in a mater of hours.  So no "automagic" matching of vectors is
necessary.

	For this reason, the idea of decelerating to a small velocity
relative to your point of departure is not so ridiculous.  Assuming the
destination system is moving in roughly the same direction as the
departure system (a pretty safe bet), this will tend to reduce the

There was a debate on this about two months ago. Basically, in MT Errata
(part of the Q&A section in the MT Journal) it was proposed that ships in a
fleet could effectively do a cautious jump and reduce the arrival spread to
less than an hour.

website.

http://www.bits.org.uk/             on the archive page.

This 101 book is only available as an Adobe Acrobat pdf file, and provides
descriptions and design spreadsheets for more than 107 starships. All the
ships were built using the modular system presented in Steve Jackson Games\'
excellent GURPS Traveller.  The author, Rob Prior, has included notes on
the design system, plus a starship encounter system.


All designs were produced using the GURPS Traveller Shipyard Software (also
written by Rob, and currently available for MacOS), demos of which may be
downloaded from the products page at the BITS site. The software provides a
menu driven interface to produce designs using the rules in GURPS
Traveller, including the additional modules found in Star Mercs and Far
Trader (both supplements for Gt produced by SJG). With the software, ships
can be designed in a matter of minutes.

Enjoy!

I seem to recall some mention of deep meson sites (manned by deep
Masons?) being spherical hulls with contra-grav.  This enables them to
rotate to face any direction, and still fire.  The TIGRESS-class can, of
course, rotate to fire as well.  I\'m not sure why fighter ops would be
impeded by being near the "firing port" of a meson beam, unless the
target was close enough to the fighters that they ran the risk of being
within the decay of the meson beam.

speculation. I\'ve seen different theory\'s, with hydrogen bubbles and

I\'ve read through my CT/MT books and haven\'t found any "real" explanations.
Only hints of how it\'s supposed to work. I can only assume, by the existance
of drop tanks, that all the fuel is used prior to jump. (Their\'s no way you
could jump with drop tanks if you need fuel throughout the jump.)

I\'ve thought about it and talked with my group here. We figure both methods
can work. If a ship is designed with capacitors, then the fuel can be used
to charge up the cap\'s prior to jump. Then the power is just drawn from the
cap\'s throughout the jump. Alternativly, a ship can partially charge its
cap\'s to initiate jump then use the remaining fuel to recharge the cap\'s
during the jump. I imagine fully charging the cap\'s would take considerably
longer than just a partial charge. So, using up all the fuel would take
longer to initiate jump. Fully charging the caps would give a chance to drop
the tanks and get far enough away to not interfere with the jump. A partial
charge jump could also be used like an "emergency" jump. CT/MT says a black
globe can absorb enough energy to jump (but their must be enough fuel) In my
idea here, this would be the equivelant of a partially charged jump drive
and enough fuel would be necessary to complete the jump. (A ship would be
destroyed before it could accumulate enough energy from the black globe to
jump without fuel.)

Can anyone explain a canon reason why this wouldn\'t work? I\'m interested in
"fine-tuning" a jump theory my group is working on. When it is finished,
I\'ll put it up on the web as an IMTU Jumpspace FAQ.

High guard and MT both say all fuel is used then tanks are dropped away. I
don\'t see any reason why an x-boat can\'t operate on drop tanks. since a
tender will be their with the scout, it can collect the tanks to use with
the next ship.

You can, however, argue that PAWs and meson weapons will be 
hard to aim (and hence short-ranged) near a planet with a
strong magnetic field - and some GG\'s have very strong
magnetic fields.

My guess is that what one would do is, assuming no releative
movement between worlds, accelerate all the way out to the
jump point.  Jump so that your velocity vector is pointed
in toward the destination.  Then decelerate to the destination.

If there is relative velocity, you just play around with this
so as much of the velocity you build up in acclerating out
goes toward matching the difference in velocity between
the ships.

Of course this means that while ships can jump from anywhere.
There will be prefered spots to leave and arrive at (for each
destination).

Well, the idea that you can use drop tanks, but only for part
of your fuel requirements _is_ new.  Also, there are other
sources where the use of fuel before jump is described, Anna
Novic (or whatever, I don\'t remember the name exactly),
jump projectors, etc. all indicate this.

Also, Hans\' point is a relevant one.  If the Gazelle uses
the fuel in the
drop tanks (leaving full internal tanks), drops them and jumps,
and then arrives with full internal tanks, it couldn\'t have
used any fuel during jump.

>  Drop tanks exist in every
>version of Traveller.  They\'re not just going to go away.

Well, first of all, they don\'t exist in GT (where I think they
should be a strictly optional rule) or in T5 (which isn\'t out
yet).  As the MT, CT, and TNE, these are, since they aren\'t
being published, by definition personal traveller universes.

due to assumptions on the workings of J-drives, assumptions that don\'t seem
grounded in canon.

>Nope.  According to my MT Ref\'s Manual, Dismountable tanks are "fixed and

>Drop tanks are instant drop.

That makes even less sense.  You can explosively blow a tank
away in the minutes before jumping, but you if you want to b
olt it you need 2 weeks???

>How do drop tanks bust up YTU?  The economic thing Hans was talking bout (and
>solved nicely if that\'s the only problem) or the issue of J-drive workings I\'m
>talking bout (and is solved by correcting the theory behind J-drives)?

Mostly the former, even if you arbitrarily say they can only provide
some fraction of the fuel (which seem hokey to me) you will still
have every ship that can using them.  Any traffic along a
major trade route (important worlds and all the one that lie
between them) should be dominated by a system of jump tanks
(whether they are ships that use them to replace all or 1/2
their fuel).

As to your "correcting" the theory, I don\'t really see it as
solving the problems (unless you were talking about some that
I missed).

>The only problems w/ drop tanks (aside from eventually sundering economic
>assumptions), is the issue that is only a problem if you\'re the "instant
>consumption" model of J-drive.

If you drop the instant consumption model, you do have problems
with various areas (like the presence of jump projectors at
higher TLs).  Though I think the economic issues are far greater.

        Just as an aside, my understanding is that meson particles are
formed from the collison of two high-energy PAWs.   Its a byproduct.
        Where the rest of the particle beams go is not mentioned in any
reading I have done, but I highly doubt 100% efficiency.  So, I would
presume that there is a short-range PAWs discharge directly in front of the
collision chamber.
        Underground, who cares.  Just make the weapon enclosure cavern big
enough it doesn\'t touch a wall.
        In space, who cares.  Just don\'t let friendlies into the danger space.

        Hi, Bob!
        We had an involved discussion about this idea.  Traveller canon does
not seem to mention much about indigeous Comabt Support Elements (CSE)
within a squadron or fleet.  Battle Tankers, Rescue Ships, Millitary
Material Transports, etc all ought to be there, but there seems to be no
stated requirement.  TCS handwaves them out of existance, Supp 9 doesn\'t
mention them, etc.

        In short, since the Other Guy doesn\'t have to build them, why would
you spend BCr building Battle Tankers only to have them wind up in a cat
fight with the Other Guy\'s CruRon.

        Unless everyone agrees to use CSE in their game, anyone who
unilaterally opts for them gets slaughtered.

        IMTU, CSE is a bit of an issue...  Someone posted cargo space
requirements for military vessels, and I am using them.  There are also some
AOR-type craft IMTU.  <shrug>  Its pretty much up to each person.

the Skirmishes conventions in FL back in 89 and 90. Minimum number of 
players was normally twelve, max was at one time 19.
It can be done, but there are several major steps required and the 
referee MUST be extremely well prepared.

Your glass wall camment is totally correct. The wall must be totally

Also, I have found at the convention games, it is best to disarm the

I remember, when I was a child, being taken to the celebrated Barnum\'s
Circus, which contained an exhibition of freaks and monstrosities. But the
exhibit on the programme that I most desired to see was the one described as
"The Boneless Wonder". My parents judged that the spectacle would be too
revolting and too demoralizing for my youthful eyes, and I waited fifty
years to see the Boneless Wonder sitting on the Treasury Bench.

In the Full Thrust Traveller playtest rules, we have PA and meson spinals
firing in a straight line from the axis ofthe ship. This turned into the
reality that you couldn\'t hit with a spinl mount at anything over 18"
because lining up the ship was a complete pain.

This was changed to a 2" wide path (inner 1" doing full damage, outer edge
being a grazing hit). This still proved very hard to achieve hits. We\'re
now considering how to assist alignment of the spinal so it\'s a more
effective weapon.

This has made me believe that spinal mounts must have some angled shot
capability.

Hmm, I thought that the average relative velocity was far higher than that,
around the order of 50,000 km/s,
Perhaps I read something written in m/s as km/s

That\'s why I like this list, it\'s so educational.

However, this raises the opposite point.

If these differences can be handled by Traveller ships so easily, why would
they bother to slow down on the way out ? Just ensure you accelerate in the
right direction to put your ship on an inbound vector when you pop out  of
J-space and you\'ve saved yourself quite a bit of time.

I can think of one reason why having the smallest relative velocity would be
good, and that\'s if you can\'t
calculate what the _direction_ of your vector will be on exit from J-space.

HA!  I wish it was that easy.  What I am saying is that there are curtain
physical limits that are very unlikely to change regardless of tech level
unless of course we \'discover\' some new elements with some very interesting
properties or develope a device with capabilities like those of Star Treks
transporters of holodecks.  A device that can freely convert any matter into
any energy and back.  With THAT you could have your omni sensor/transciever.

Nanotech is not part of canon.  If it were Traveller\'s back ground would be
very different.  The laws of cause and effect are immuteable.  If nonotech
is available on very limited scale then a variable sensor system would be
posible but that would also mean that the sensor could only operate in one
band at a time and there would be a delay in band change.

I do not have SoM and you are talking about a very different rampart that I

You still do not get it.  I have no intention of doing so and no reason to
do so.  It\'s a basic point of logic not a caparation of game system
mechanics.  If the game system does not include stealthy cool air breathing
perpulsion systems then you can not even start to make an in game
comparison.  In short if the design system was written for space ships you
are unlikely to ba able to build a competant air fighter and vice versa.  If
you put a bird up against a cat on the ground the cat will win most times.
If the fight takes place at 3000 feet in the air, kitty goes splat!
Neighter is a fair comparison.

If a space war ship beats a air war ship in the air with \'all other things
being equall\' then you need to fire the air war ship\'s designer because he
is a moron!

I\'ll counter you proposal.  You design a space capable fighter at our
current tech level using any design system you chose and then compare it to
a real jet fighter in use today for the purpose of air combat at say 20,000
feet. See who wins then.  The air fighter.  Why because of the design weight
penalty

Don\'t you get it.  The plane can have anything the space fighter can.
Lasers, turrets, missles, partical weapons, anything plus special equipment
made just for it\'s type of combat.  The space fighter can not carry anything
that can not survive in space.  It has to use thrusters even though they
produce a massive heat signature that can be targeted or pay the design
penalty in weight for having two power trains.  If the space fighter has two
power trains to overcome the heat signature the fighter will have more
available weight for armor.  Remember I said \'all otherthings being equal\'.
That mean weight, dollars, tech level, pilot training time, exc.

The design limits placed on the space fighter are greater than those placed
on the air plane IN the atmosphere.

It\'s like comparing a battle rider and a jump capable war ship of the same
tonage.  Of course the battle rider will win most times in a stand up fight
because that is it\'s natural enviroment.  That why I keep saying it\'s a no
brainer.

This could be critical if you want to fire that meson gun while travelling

If standard starship meson guns fire the PAWs into space (creating
the mesons outside the ship), they\'ll have an open hole in the front
of the ship when they fire - that could be bad when in a GG.

IMTU we can control the gravitics with high precision. We don\'t have

There are some very, very expensive things a TL15 ship needs for space
combat that work very well for air combat. The atmosphere fighter will
not buy these things, as these items have abilities not useful in
atmosphere. 

You could probably build a capable atmospheric fighter (vs other
atmospheric fighters) for the price of a Rampart\'s missile load.

How about this - I\'ll build a light space fighter carrier and it\'s fifty
space fighters. I\'ll include construction costs, munitions, and pilot
training costs as if I were building it for both the anti-starship role
and the interface/ground attack role. 

For the MCr I spend, you could probably build a couple airbases
and a thousand atmospheric fighters. Or, you could build a base and a 
couple hundred aerospace fighters - and win. Because your
atmospheric fighters will have no more chance of winning than an
F-16 has a chance of intercepting a YF-12A[1] that\'s up to altitude
and running at speed.

The supremacy of atmospheric fighters in atmosphere is only obvious from
a 20th century design perspective. The rules try to represent equipment
and design capabilities from quite a bit further along. 

Walt Smith

[1] The YF-12A was the combat version of the SR-71. Just as fast,
it could deploy a batch of missiles (including the option for nuclear-tipped
ones) with no effect on it\'s altitude or speed capabilities.

        I have always presumed that the maw of a spinal is managed rather
like a torpedo tube with a set of inner and out doors.  When not at action
stations, or refueling, both sets of the doors are closed and the tunnels
actually pressurized to allow maint.  As soon as the ship closes up general
quarters/ 2nd degree of readiness, the tunnels are depressurized and the
inner doors opened.  Battle stations/ 1rst degree of readiness, outter doors
are opened and the weapon begins charging.

        On this premise, when screaming through an atmosphere at Mach 12 on
fuel scooping run, both sets of doors are *closed*.

        Note that there is no canon for this, but it does make some
semblance of sense...  as for Supp 9 with all of those ships showing the
open maw of the weapon.  They are "posing" for the picture, a la Soviet
missile subs who cruised on the surface with all thier missile doors open as
a NATO recon plane over flew them...  "Hi there!  This is what we\'re
packing...  keep that in mind when you pick a scrap with us..."

Or that TL 12 computers are better at pointing ships than humans on a tabletop?
In a hex game, one would let a meson weapon fire full a whole 30 or 60 degree
arc not to represent its real travel but to represent small repointings of the 
ship that the hex grid can\'t model. Similar rules could be applied to 
a miniatures game.
On the other hand, the target is really much smaller than your Full Thrust 
miniatures. And a ship that had to aim its spinal mount precisely to the 
nanoradian would severly limit its evasion. I assume meson weapons have
about a tenth of a degree of tracking ability (from deflection of the beam by 
magnetic fields.)

According to both versions of FF&S I have no.  The meson chamber is a perfect sphere
with the gun touching the walls at both ends.  It rolls around in there somehow.  CG
units are attached to the barrel to keep it from flexing in gravity.

A meson guns efficiency rating is determed soully by it\'s TL.  Understandable, but
they start out at about 80% efficient.

When you say "plane", are you still picturing something supported by 
aerodynamic lift? In that case, both of them will still get eaten for
breakfast by a grav tanks, which can afford to carry a lot more armour,
since CG thrust lets you lift a lot more weight per unit volume than
wings do.

>If the game system does not include stealthy cool air breathing
>perpulsion systems 
it\'s remarkably hard to imagine an airbreathing propulsion system 
that (a) produces thrust-to-weight even remotely comparable to a
thruster plate (6G!), (b) has a cool enough exhaust not to have
some significant IR signature, (c) uses so little power that its
generators don\'t have an IR signature, and (d) works up to a 
decent altitude. (Note that the space fighter\'s ability to
operate up to arbitrary altitudes and climb extremely fast is a 
considerable advantage - it can choose when and where to fight.)

This is a silly suggestion; at current TLs, rocket engines have such high
fuel consumption that an orbital-capable rocket has to be all fuel and
nothing else. The TL balance will change at Traveller tech levels.

This isn\'t to say that a specialized planetary-environment
vehicle won\'t have some advantages - but by high TL\'s they\'ll
be minor. gravitic thrust is just so efficient that it\'s very
hard to beat - space capability doesn\'t actually inflict much
penalty. All else being equal the "plane" might have a very
minor advantage - but to even be competetive the "plane" probably
has CG or T-plate thrust and an armoured hull and looks a lot
like a spacecraft, except for having bigger wings and a different
uniform for the pilot. It\'s kind of like having a debate about which
makes a better ground combat vehicle - a Corvette or a Ford Explorer,
with arguments about whether the Ford Explorer\'s off-road design will
hurt it in a combat on a freeway. At high TLs spacecraft and 
aircraft blur together.

In general, I expect that anything I post to the list is free to be used by
the list members.  The only exeption is use in a product that will be sold
for profit.  That requires a seperate inquiry.

I ask that I get proper credit, and that a link be provided to the Gridlore
Technologies site (http://www.hooked.net/~dberry/gridlore.html).  Also, a
nod to either Andy Akins for the ship designs, or if you post any weapons I
put on the list, to Greg Porter for 3G3.

IIRC the entire energy needs of the UK for a year could be met by fusing
2 grammes of hydrogen into helium.  2 grammes of helium has a volume of
about 12 litres at normal pressure and room temperature.

Hm...2 grams of hydrogen fused yields about 0.01 grams of energy, or about
9e+11 joules, or 2.5e+5 kilowatt-hours.  As I recall typical first-world power
requirements are around 100 watts/person (might be higher), so 2 grams of
hydrogen will probably power london for less than an hour.

It reminds me of an evening having drinks with two good friends from
high school some years ago.  Steve was probably a captain in the Army
then and Richard was about the same grade in the Navy (LtSG, I guess). 
After a while, Richard got up and said, "I\'m going to the toity-toity." 
Steve responded, "That must be navy talk for bathroom."  I guess you had
to be there; it was hilariously funny some 15 years ago.  In the middle
of the night.  After vodka shots.

Relating to Traveller (what does "Ob" mean, anyway?), most deckplans
refer to "freshers", although I\'ve seen some (but can\'t remember who
published them, nor of what ships) that say "head".  What\'s the
consensus on this important item of nomenclature?

I stand here dumb founded.  Such an obvious solution to such and obvious
problem.  As far as I know there are no ships in canon designed for this
purpose.  One cruiser sized ship designed just for Gas Gaint diving could
feed a lot of tankers in short order.  The tankers could then refuel the
fleet while the diver gets more go juice.

I\'d build laser armed stealth planes with missle bays.  Good for air combat
and anti space craft work.  My planes are hard to see, the space ship are
easy to see during interface.  Fry them crispy and send the missles out NOE
after the one you miss.  Add some deep meson sites payed for with less money
than you spent on jump drives to get here and thing get interesting.

There was the Arrora (spelling) the largest transonic bomber ever built.
Two prototypes were built but one crashed after sucking a fighter into it\'s
wing tip turbulence.  It was a decendent to the SR71 but not the combat
version.  That may be what you are thinking of.

The preposed SR71 combat variant was never built.  To little war load for
the cost I think.  Sorry, I do not have the book with the information here
at work with me.

Who needs 6G when you are laser armed?  Speed is nearly meaningless when
your weapons work at the speed of light and the range is short.

No you can\'t.  I see you, I shoot you.  Range is LOS.  I\'d add some smart
air breathing surface skimming missles with Det-laser warheads for over the
horison work and CG to increase dwell time and allow for vtol without the
normal weight penalties for vtol.  You have the A-10 from hell.  Massive war
load, Stealth to stay out of your percieved LOS, vtol, LOS light speed guns,
and fight while in difilade capable.  Toss in some remote sensor modules for
early warning and FO capacity and you have a squadron killer.

You can not pick this craft up on passive sensors beyond vissual range.  If
you go active it hits you with HARM targeted det-lasers.  If you stay on
pasive sensors He locks on to you with his remotes and can still launch from
a valley floor and move away out of you LOS while the missles close with
you.  If you get LOS with him he has just as good a chance to kill you as
you have him.

True for civilian vehicles but when in combat you want every edge you can
get.  Whay do you think we spend 1M per tomahawk when an old B52 has a
better range, warload, and is reuseable?  Because of lives and the value we
place on them.  Most militaries realise that trained personell are their
scariest resource and take step to protect them.

        The phrase "all the eggs in one basket" comes to mind.  That ship
suddenly becomes a monsterously high-value target worth loosing a BB to
kill...  trash it and the Other Side is now suffering a fuel crisis.
        If you have lots of them, that just means that it is now a better
deal to loose a BB trashing a squadron of these.  Surround it with escorts,
and now they are willing to make a fleet action out of it.
        In short, to me, that design concept reeks of "sh!t magnet".  =)

        And divinity help that "Diver" ship if it gets found by SDB\'s in the
GG...  for the very reason that you didn\'t want to send your captial ships
in there....

You have that nasty thing call a pressure wave not to mention the fireball

It was the XB-70 Valkarie (sp?) bomber produced by North American Aviation.
 The last remaining example is on static display at Wright-Patterson AFB.
It is extremely humbling to walk under it and realize that this huge
aircraft was to cruise at Mach 3.

The YF-12A was built.  Three examples IIRC.  They carried the missiles in
individual bays and were to provide a high speed, high altitude defense for
CONUS.  I seem to remember that they are either in storage or on static
display.

That\'s true only if the rest of your fleet isn\'t keeping the bad guys
busy...Obviously there would have to be a tactical neccessity for using tanker
sqd\'s...

I, personaly, wouldn\'t use them unless I thought I could deffend them. 
In a b/cr limited senario a player simply might not have the resourses for
them. That\'s why I mentioned an opened ended campaigne; in the beginning of a
war resourses *are* limited but as the campaigne proceeds more resourse points
become available- at least for 1 side...

_Ob_ligatory _Traveller_ reference. A mantra to ward off the "That\'s not
ON TOPIC!!!" goons fortunateky far, far rarer in this venue than in
others 

(I\'m on another mailing list where some prissy tightpants sort has
gotten their panties in a bunch because someone used foul language like
f$@#. No, not a word _represented_ by \'f$@#\'...the actual character
string: f$@#. A flame war has ensued. Oy!)

Word lesson for the day:

Spo-fu-lam Spo as in Spot, fu as in Kung, lam as in \'on the\', running
from Ditzie and her toys.

At least that\'s how _I_ pronounce it.

"fresher"  is a slang term probably derived from "refresher" that refers to a
combination cleaning and grooming system, usually using non-water means of
cleansing  (ultrasonics,  compressed air ), and depilatory creams, sometimes
having the abilitfy to provide anti-radiation foams,  that might look a bit
like a cubicle shower, based on the few descriptions that have appeared in SF

High tech vanity versions sometimes include hair and skin colouring systems,
capable of producing complicated fractal patterns in either long-term or
short-term treatments, and removing the same,

A few rare examples have even provided minor body sculpting abilities, though
they tend to be owned by stage and espionage professionals

The term was probably first used by someone like Heinlien in his juveniles,
but it is _old_ in SF terms.

Good points all.  Perhaps a purpose build diver ship for everyday use to
save wear and tear on the other ships and cut fueling times.  That way if
you lost it you could still refuel using convetional means.  It could also
me make less vunerable and better at defending itself than a fuel shuttle.
Or build this function into the escorts.

That\'s news to me.  What did they do to fit missles into that thing?  There

Using the basic round, the weapon does an average of 105 points of damage.
Using the californium rounds, the average damage is 8,400 points.  Since
there is a great chance that the round won\'t work properly, the damages for
fizzles are 2100 points and 840 points for quarter and one-tenth damage.

The only handwave required for these weapons is to allow small damper boxes
holding perhaps two or three magazines worth of Ca ammo.  The listing
states that a damper box holds three tons of ammo, so I can\'t imagine a
scaled down version capable of holding 20-60 rounds to be much of a
hindrance to a battledressed Marine with a STR of 70+!

Also, I\'ve designed a "beehive" round, consisting of 60 5x50mm steel darts.
 Each of these darts does 10d6-1.  I\'m working on HE rounds as well.

The weapon has dual magazines, so that a Marine could have one beehive and
one nuke magazine loaded.  If you like, reduce the nuke magazine size to
five rounds, and say that the extra mass is a small damper box.   This
weapon would probably incorporate a CG generator to offset weight.

The keyword right there is "unless."  Alot can happen in 3000+ years.  Even
the hundred till 2100.  For all your experience and knowledge of TL-8
(possibly TL-9) electronics and such, it means precisely squat for the
discussion at hand.  Unless you find a secret journal of Nostradamus or take a
ride in your time travelling delorean, what you say only applies to today.
You haven\'t designed TL-15 nor TL-12 electronics sets.

Maybe it\'s just another space opera thingamajig, maybe you\'re just full of
hooey.  It\'s been part of Traveller for a long time and it\'s not going away.
What goes on in YTU, I frankly don\'t really care as we\'re not talking about
YTU, but the OTU.  Get it?

So YOU say.  It\'s not mentioned but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t room for it
as long as it doesn\'t live up to the claims of sci-fi authors (IMTU, this is
precisely the case).   When you get ownership of the Traveller copyright, I\'ll
put more weight into your words (well... probably not).

I don\'t have any problem with that.  Neither does HG or BL w/ 20-30 minute
turns.

Just what are the GURPSy sensors (PESA and AESA) capable of, especially in
relation to Traveller sensors?  What bands to they cover and what TL\'s do they
become available at?

The Rampart masses 186.52 tonnes in BL.  So are the dimensions mentioned
acceptable to you, for the capabilities present?  

Nice how you skipped all the other points.  The specifics mentioned in the SoM
are irrelevant.  The point is that it\'s canon for space sensors to be
effective inside the atmosphere and for the atmosphere/ground sensors to be
effective in space.  That they\'re the exact same systems and operating on the
same principles (whatever they are) must just be a happy coinicidence.

First read your top quote.   Then read my response.  The things you bring up
are laughably ludicrous.  Who cares what the TL-8 air force is up to when
we\'re talking about tech and people thousands of years further along the
timeline?  Especially in light that we\'re talking about a ***TL-15***
airframed space fighter!   Unless u\'re changing the frame of the discussion
again?

And who says such a mind machine interface isn\'t canon, anyways?  There are
these things called "neural jacks" in the cybernetics chapter in FF&S.

All I\'ve asked you to do is to put up or shut up, Charles.

I\'m not comparing game system mechanics (given the same craft parameters,
you\'re likely to see the same thing in every system, though... from Star Wars
to GURPS to TNE to FUDGE to Alternity).  I\'ve run the combats and seen the
results quite a few times (particularly TL-9 aircraft vs TL-12 Wildbat space
fighters).  GURPS has the veneer of being far closer to TNE than any set of
Traveller, so I\'d expect similar (not identical) results.  You\'re not afraid
to see your ludicrous assumptions shattered, are you?

Well, it just happens that I was using the design system for aircraft and the
designs system for spacecraft that are both in FF&S.  Imagine that.  LOL.

It\'s seems clear you\'ve never run such a combat, nor are willing to.  Nor
designed either a space fighter nor atmosphere fighter, nor are willing to.
Very interesting.  
In short, you\'re only following your own conception of "logic" to an absurd
conclusion.

LOL.  At our current tech level?  Where did that come from?  We\'re talking
about a TL-15 space fighter vs TL-9 air fighter (or TL-15 vs TL-15, as u
altered it to).  Where did TL-8 come into the picture?  lol.  Or are you
trying to change the frame of the discussion again?  Or is it time for your
pill?  I\'ve seen TL-9 air vs TL-12 space numerous times.  TL-15 vs TL-9 will
be even more lopsided.

<snip>

It\'s becoming more and more apparent you\'ve never designed what u\'re talking
about.  Try it some time, you might be surprised.  Then you\'ll have some frame
of knowledge that we can continue this discussion.  Until then, please stop
embarassing yourself.

Not an appropriate analogy, but you usually come from left field, so what the
hey, right?  If that discussion went anything like this one, you\'d start
talking about TL-8 battle riders and SDI and maybe throw in an analogy
involving a cat, a bird, and the local dog.  Then maybe a comment about
\'nonotech\' capabilities (and their absence in the OTU) and how you lack the
crucial supplement needed to realize what we\'re talking about.

The battle rider will win because it has weapons and armor and screens taking
up the space of the jump drives and jump drive fuel tankage.  That\'s it.  It\'s
very simple really.  Has nothing to do with environment.  Both are dueling in
space, according to space combat rules (whichever u happen to be using).  But
I doubt u\'ve designed either of these, either, so nevermind.  ;-)

Annic Nova was an unusual case, wasn\'t it?  Jump projectors are more advanced
tech so have another possible handwave around.

That\'s not how it works, though.  By CT standards, if the Gazelle keeps its
drop tanks, it can do Jump 4, completely draining all tankage (drop tank and
internal).  If drop tanks are dropped before jump, J-5 and everything is gone
(drop tanks consumed before drop?  Or internal consumed and/or transferred to
the J-drive and drop tankage transfered to internal?)  No drop tanks at all?
J2, all internal tankage.  
I don\'t know of anything saying if less than max jump is undertaken.  I
presume there might be something in Supp 7,but from Douglas\' post a couple
days back, I doubt it.

Do you see what that means?  NOTHING says exactly what fuel goes to where.
Alot of people have come to conclusions for their own TUs, but to say drop
tanks are flawed in concept is in error w/o an \'improper\' conception of how
jump is supposed to work (officially, which was left vague).

Personal TUs?  T5 is just a fantasy right now.  And G:T is, by self-

adventure or "supplement" published over 20 years ago, would they?

LOL.  Don\'t tell me about it.  I didn\'t write MT!  I\'m still glad theyr\'e gone
from TNE, though.  ;-)  I would advise checking what dismountable tanks are,
though, as you don\'t seem to have drawn an accurate recollection on them.  I
had to look in my MT Ref\'s to find out as they\'re not in FF&S.

Why should that be wrong if the things are discovered at TL-15?  I presume you
game in the Spinward Marches, a backwater.  They won\'t come in common usage
for a long time in the toolies.  If u\'re running a campaign in the Core
(anyone??), then u might have problems.  Given the date of the TNS entry, I\'d
say before 1120 or so, they\'re only gonna be seen amongst the Imperial
military and the megacorp bulk freighters.  Neither of these should impact
YTU, necessarily.  Does tech stand still in YTU?  A stagnant lack of
technological development and/or innovation?  Why shouldn\'t drop tank ships
come to dominate Imperial space by 1200 (assuming the Rebellion, Hard Times,
and Collapse didn\'t wreck said Imperial space)?  :-)  What\'s wrong w/ things
developing and growing and changing, just like Real Life (tm)?  Especially if
it\'s not going to do anything to your campaign, even over the long term, as
campaigns go?

If your J-theory doesn\'t say everything is instantly consumed (which I don\'t
find substantiated by canon, though I don\'t have 20 years of presumption
weighing in), drop tanks aren\'t anything but a marginal technology.

Solved by virtue of a \'higher-tech\' handwave.  In addition, you get to keep
the canon Gazelle.

> higher TLs).  Though I think the economic issues are far greater.

Ignoring the economic issues by simply abolishing drop tanks seems nothing
more than sticking one\'s head into the sand.   I don\'t mean that offensively,
but there shoudl be a better way to accomidate previously published material
than somethign so extreme (economic regions... a powerful lobby in the
Imperial Court against the drop tank manufacterers, etc.  Political and
economic backlash, etc etc).  Maybe you have alot invested in your particular
theory of jump drive...  I really doubt how that could be applicable to drop
tanks having a catastrophic effect on your campaigning.

What is laid out in one place is that it take 10% of the ships
volume, in liquid hydrogen, per parsec per jump.  It also
takes a jump drive that has the volume, cost, etc. as listed
in the supplements.  These drives require lanthanum to construct.
At higher TLs, you can have jump "projectors" that allow you
to jump something else.  In CT the jump drive used the same
powerplant as everthing else, later on this was seperate out.
It was stated that you couldn\'t interact with something in
jump space (though this was changed when the idea of getting
"precipitated out" by masses was introduced).


Various works have "generally" treated the drive as having
a grid of lanthanum in the hull.  It is also mentioned that
there is an energy signature when you enter and leave jump
space (was this original?).  Various adventures have dealt
with capacitors the store the energy for jumping and varoius
ways of charging them (from solar energy to drop tanks to
black globes).

That is what, at least, I can recall off the top of my head.

But your carrier would wipe out the support infrastructure with KKM
deadfall, missile fire and laser attack before the atmospherics can engage.
The aerospace fighters, if ground based, can be picked off by the fighters
and carrier during their vulnerable boost phase before they\'re out of the
gravity well, unless you base them in orbit.

The atmospheric fighters don\'t get to play, unless the carrier lets them.
Even with an ASAT weapon like the F15 Clancy describes in Red Storm Rising,
they are vulnerable as they have to get high enough to engage.

Operating down the potential well is a big problem.

Thta\'s easy. We don\'t have viable space systems at TL8, not for a space
capable fighter. Not even for something like the Deltas in Walter Jon
Williams \'Hardwired\'. So you ask him to design a space capable fighter with
a rules (and RL) framework which will not support one. Hardly a fair
contest when you\'re comparing a mature technology against one which doesn\'t
exist yet. Almost as unfair as comparing a mature technology (TL15) against
an obsolete one (TL8).

Maybe you should look at TL12 - this is viable for the whole Traveller
period. Otherwise this is heading to non-viable land. TL12 should be around
where the CG tech starts to outperform normal tech.

It uses Antigrav/contragrav generators in all versions of Traveller, not T
Plates.

That is a fair argument, but unrealistic; you are likely to have several
dedicated air fighters for each space fighter.

If you constrain it to match the parameters of an aircraft.

But you need to think outside the TL8 aircraft box you\'re thinking in. It
is unlikely you can compare a space fighter directly with a air fighter, as
the costs will be higher. You need someone to build a spacefighter, then
take your \'n\' aircraft and see if they can kill it for a fair contest of
technologies. Otherwise aircraft win be default as space craft cannot
compete against cost. This may be your point, but I feel it has little real
world (game world) bearing on discussing the viability of the technologies.

This is a good starting point as it lists a timeline for the A-12,
YF-12, and the SR-71 from the 50\'s through the 90\'s.  Educational
stuff.  I knew of the drone (Q-12/D-21), but not of some of the
missile launch tests.

The missiles were stored internally in the body of the craft.  If you look

Both PESA and AESA become available at GTL8 (about TTL 8-9?).  

AESA is a multi-mode sensor which includes: radar, imaging radar, and
ladar.  (according to GT)  VE2nd expands to say it has the ability to
switch between search radar, low-rez imaging radar, high-rez imaging radar,
and ladar.  At GTL10 (TTL 9) the basic bridge\'s AESA is 7500lbs, 150cf, and
costs 27kcr.  AT TL12 (GTL 15) it\'s 5620lb, 120cf, and21kcr

PESA is an array of infrared thermal imaging and low-light telescopic
sensors.  VE2nd expands to include passive radar, thermograph, possibly
ultraviolet imaging, low-light TV, and magnification (3000x in basic
bridge, 10000x in command bridge).  at GTL 10, the basic bridge has a PESA
that is 3000lbs, 60cf, and 200.6kcr  at GTL 12 it\'s half that.

Ya, well I have to admit the first place I learned about the 50 km/s
figure was on this list, so... :-)  I have since confirmed this peice of
data with (even?) more reliable sources just to be sure...

<Frank>
However, this raises the opposite point.

If these differences can be handled by Traveller ships so easily, why
would they bother to slow down on the way out ? Just ensure you accelerate
in the right direction to put your ship on an inbound vector when you pop
out of J-space and you\'ve saved yourself quite a bit of time. 

I can think of one reason why having the smallest relative velocity would
be good, and that\'s if you can\'t calculate what the _direction_ of your
vector will be on exit from J-space.  
</Frank>

I\'ve long thought that jumping randomizes the direction of your outcoming
vector.  According to some folks, this does not violate any physical laws,
although it seems to me intuitively that it would, so I just say that this
direction change is a byproduct of the energy one puts into jumping.  Some
energy "spills" into a vector that adds to your input vector in a
completely unpredictable way.

One advantage of this is it makes the whole "planet cracker" impact thing
a little more difficult to pull off (though it\'s still uncomfortably easy,
and NO I DO NOT WANT TO START THAT WHOLE DISCUSSION AGAIN! :-)

The other thing randomization of direction does, of course, is justify the
slowing down business at the jump point...

I asked the same question last year and got the 50 to 100 km/s
answers. It also matches what I found when I did some study on the
subject.  There are some rouges that are somewhat higher, but nothing
like 50,000km/s. ;->

As I understand it, that\'s called a "running jump" and it is performed
for just the reasons you describe. I believe a "standing jump" is
considered easier to plot, but a "running jump" gives you the benefit
of partially or completely offsetting the relative differences in
vector between the two systems. 

IMTU, ships use stutterwarp for in-system flight (my version of
stutter doesn\'t get faster than a few % of c), so they don\'t build up
a *real* vector while running.  They use gravity assists and HEPlaR
engines to change their real vector both before and after jump so they
can orbit their destination.

give enough power to  put the ship into jump space, but not enough to keep
the jump field up and cause a mis-jump? Would a jump induced by a black

Is the explanation in HG/MT a mistake and the relation of black globes to
jumps different. (Like no fuel is necessary, for example)

Bah.. its hard to design really excessive holdout weapons given the
restrictions in GT.  A TL 12 fusion holdout (fully loaded, 1 lb) is:
Fusion Holdout: Malf Ver, Type Exp, Dmg 6d*8, SS 9, Acc 6, 1/2D 110, Max 220,

blast effects as you\'re engulfed by the fireball ;)

Finally got a look at the Carnival ships site - wow, those are huge
monsters!

Could I suggest the following guidelines/rules for Trav cruise ships:

     1.   True luxury liners are BIG. For example, the King Richard.
     2.   To portray large areas of common space, create new modules
(GURPS) or components (HG, etc). For example: ballroom, large common dining
room, auditorium, casino, specialty shops, and so on. Then put these
modules into the ship. NOW you will be able to draw pretty deckplans that
match RW ships.
     3.   When figuring running costs and revenue, remember to take the
casino and shops into account. ESPECIALLY the "Millionaires Lounge" casino
(see the Destiny RW cruise ship to see what I mean).
     4.   Change the rules for passage costs. Even if IYTU you have ruled
that the Imperium subsidises ticket prices to keep them down, you can
easily say that cruise ships are a special case and are able to charge
more. After all, "normal" passage is generally one-way, at least for a
particular starship. Cruises, however, are generally round trips. Allowing
cruise ships to charge higher prices will not affect the transportation
economy at all.

Yup that\'s the ones.  They were actually created by Keith Laumer, but it\'s
a _very_ shared universe.  William Keith is one of the author\'s who write
in it, and has written some of my favorite Bolo books.

[Apologies if this has been asked - I haven\'t finished my digests yet!]

I have seen Hans\' noble system before. I thought it was a nice idea but a
bit too unwieldy. For example, I have a question: how do you reach these
esoteric levels? Do you still use the normal chargen system or something
else? Are Imperial appointments, therefore, something that you grant as a
GM ("too important to leave to chance") or can they occur "naturally"?

I think that the Milieu 0 explanation - which has appeared in other earlier
sources - is perhaps better: when a world is assimilated^k^k^k _welcomed_
into the Imperium, the Moot reviews the world\'s current rulers and grants
Imperial titles accordingly. For example, a world ruler entitled "King
Frederick" may also be granted the Imperial title of "Marquis [planet
name]". The Imperial title, although a "lesser" name, has precedence over
local titles.

This can have interesting implications for role-playing. For example, King
Fred rules over all he surveys, but has to kowtow to other Imperial
nobility that he may see as beneath him. This can certainly cause
resentment, and Fred may be subtlely impolite or even rude, all the while
maintaining a facade of deference to an off-world noble. Fun for those who
play political campaigns! Works best in a freeform (= US "LARP").

"Ob" as in "ObTraveller" is short for "Obligatory", which is
short for "Obligatory Reference to ".  It means, in essence, "I
know that this post is really off-topic for the list/newsgroup,
but here\'s my nod to topicality."

As far as "Head" vs. "Fresher", I suppose it depends on how you
view the Traveller universe, and what SF you read.  I haven\'t
really thought about it, and probably wouldn\'t be consistent in
my usages, but I suppose that IMTU the usage would be as follows:

On Navy ships: Head
On non-Navy military ships: Latrine
On non-military ships:
	Small owner (free/far/fat traders, yachts, etc.): Whatever
          the convention on the owner\'s homeworld.
    Large owner, non-passenger: Convention adhered to by the 
        majority of the crew.
    Passenger Liners:
        If they contain individualized laundry facilities:
            Freshers.
        If they contain water showers: Bathrooms.
        If they contain non-water showers: Freshers.
        If they contain no showers: Toilets, or WCs.
        If they are in public areas of the ship: Rest Rooms.
        If they are carrying a majority of passengers who are not

            heavily influenced by Solomani culture: Whatever the 
            convention adhered to by the majority of the 
            passengers.

You and I disagree on "fu" - I read it as "few", as in "not
many", as in the number of men that would make a pass at a

Well, you have Annic Nova, you have jump projectors, you
also have being able to get jump energy from black globe
projectors, they all point the same way (there may be
more that don\'t come to mind).  I would say that
to change them all is, in fact, something new.

Well, I don\'t know enough about Gazelle.  I have supplement 7
and I\'ll look when I get home.  However, the restriction that
you can only use drop tanks for part of your fuel would, indeed,
seem to be new (in addition to the points above).

Well, in fact you have the aforementioned and things like the
fact that the original CT ships used the same power plant for
jump drives and everything else.

I think drop tanks fit in with how jump was described (with the
addition that they allowed fuel to be used before jump).  However,
I also think that insuficient thought was given to their impact on the
background, which is non-trivial.

I\'m not sure what debate you are talking about.  They don\'t,

Let me ask you, if they were an option rule, what does that impact
_your_ campaign.  The problem with them as an official rule
is that they have profound implication for the background which
means they either take over the progress of the timeline, or
you have to introduce them and then have their uses be inexplicitly
ignored by almost everyone (even while PC are running arounds
showing what can be done with them) and that impacts suspension
of disbelief.

Yeah, but the point is whether one should accept drop tanks
becuase "they aren\'t going away".  Well, for CT, MT, and TNE
there is no new material.  You know everything that is
out and if you delete the references to drop tanks, they have
in fact, "gone away".  This will never conflict with new material
since there won\'t be any.

AS to GT and T5.  How they handle drop tanks remains to be seen.

The problem is that, unless you want to have the question
"why isn\'t this being used" hanging over everything, you have
to fully explore the consequences (failing to do that is one
of the causes of a background with holes in it and a "hokey"
feel).  This a) is a lot of work, b) if it is handled badly
it can introduce other things that are hokey, c) exploring
all the consequences of this can hijack the plotline from
more interesting things (there really is a limit to the
number of things you can reasonable develop at one time),
d) it changes the "feel" of the game (you get closer to
a B5 kind of situation where many ships will have to leave
from "jump stations".

The biggest issue, for me, is "c".  This isn\'t a problem
for everyone (Hans suggested it could be something that
made GT unique) but, at the least, it would require the
author of the plot line pefering to do that rather than
other creative events he might be invisaging.

It is not _that_ much of a backwater.  It can make them (gosh, they

in the Marches just as much money.

Well, sure, you can try and handwave new technology.  However,
too many handwaves make things hokey and each handwave has
the problem of possible future consequences.  I think not
having drop tanks (given how little was written about them)
is a smaller change than fussing with new restrictions on
them, dealing with how it affects black globes, jump
projectors, economic changes, etc.

If you abolish them, there are no economic issues.  The
economics were written without them in mind.  (In GT, drop
tanks would mean revamping significan portions of Far Trader).

Well, you have Annic Nova, you have jump projectors, you
also have being able to get jump energy from black globe
projectors, they all point the same way.  I would say that
to change them all is, in fact, something new.

Well, I don\'t know enough about Gazelle.  I have supplement 7
and I\'ll look when I get home.  However, the restriction that
you can only use drop tanks for part of your fuel would, indeed,
seem to be new (in addition to the points above).

>Do you see what that means?  NOTHING says exactly what fuel goes to where.

Well, in fact you have the aforementioned and things like the
fact that the original CT ships used the same power plant for
jump drives and everything else.

I think drop tanks fit in with how jump was described (with the
addition that they allowed fuel to be used before jump).  However,
I also think that insuficient thought was given to their impact on the
background, which is non-trivial.

I\'m not sure what debate you are talking about.  They don\'t,

Let me ask you, if they were an option rule, what does that impact
_your_ campaign.  The problem with them as an official rule
is that they have profound implication for the background which
means they either take over the progress of the timeline, or
you have to introduce them and then have their uses be inexplicitly
ignored by almost everyone (even while PC are running arounds
showing what can be done with them) and that impacts suspension
of disbelief.

In that case, what you want is a tank. An airbreathing aerodynamic lift
vehicle just can\'t carry the armour to compete with a grav tank; I think
no-one would argue that grav tanks will beat space fighters of equivalent
price either.

Excuse me if I butt in here with a little information (along the lines of a little
knowledge being a dangerous weapon).  My only reference to jump projectors is in
the MT Ref\'s manual.
Jump Projector: Jump projectors induce a jump field around the target, causing it
to misjump. Available at very high Tech Levels. [TL 21]

Now, if I may interpret this... suppose that means that you can hit a ship
attempting to jump with a jump projector.  This would screw up the jump, causing a
misjump.  The jumping ship still uses all of its regular jumping procedures, it
just misjumps.  Nothing in the description precludes the limitation on jumping
vessels only.

I know that liberals would like to say that it doesn\'t say it won\'t work on any
object, and therefore allow it to work.  But if we look to preserve canon without
reprecussions and more importantly avoid a definitive answer as to how a jump
drive works, this limitation seems to be reasonable.  I\'d even go so far as
allowing the induced field to initiate the jump drives, somehow tricking them into
activating.

It depends on what system you\'re using.  If you\'re using GT with the
optional rules of GURPS Vehicles I believe that at TL12 Reactionless
Thrusters do not actually have be physically oriented to provide thrust in a
specific direction. (I seem to recall at TL 13 (GURPS TL not CT) no external
"plates" are necessary and the drive is actually a Reactionless Drive.)

Depends on _how_ the Space Figher is armed!  It seems to me that said
fighter could fire some kind of \'Tank-Buster\' missile from a low orbit,
that would take the tank out, while using the atmosphere to mess up the
Tanks Laser weapons.

Do any of the design rules for weaponery take air friction and defraction
into account?

A useful "checkpoint". From something I was reading recently, I got the

I\'ve got the book. It discusses PC\'s pooling their resources to buy A ship,
but I didn\'t see this idea. (I haven\'t gotten all the way thru it yet, tho.)

I think the idea is way cool. Far Trader talks about all the different
aspects of running a company, but only real rich PC\'s could be at the top of
the food chain in a Megacorp. Call it a Combine or Collective or something.
Guild is already used to describe the professional space workers union, (at
least in GT.)

I would think that a group like this might set up shop in one of the
frontier subsectors.  I\'d carry it whole hog.  Let the Combine hire some
ground agents to set up cargoes with the brokers, just like the big boys,
maybe even get a semi-regular contract with IISS to carry mail, when the
liners are overbooked.

It would be a good way for a PC owned ship to do some real merchant prince
roleplaying without always being a jump away from bankruptcy and the repo
man.

To make it interesting I\'d make members keep their ships to a higher
standard than the typical trader. After all with a steady source of income
the ship\'s owner should be able to afford all those survival kits that are
suppose to be aboard for each passenger and crew member.  After all Ace
makes sure that their members maintain a certain minimum standard to bear
the Ace Hardware name.

Ace is the trademark of some company, whose name I don\'t know. I\'m sure all
rights are reserved. :)

Makes a lot of sense to me.  In the days of sail pirates on our mudball
mostly were supported either directly or indirectly by opposing governments.
Even today modern pirates scuttle the small craft that they rob, unless they
have a backer with the resources to forge or buy registration and ownership
papers.

A major criminal organization with an army of crooked lawyers (oxymoron),
forgers and perhaps even a few friends in a sector or Dominion might not
only be able to dispose of hot spacecraft, but might even have a shipyard
somewhere that could modify those "harmless" merchants into bad-ass raiders,
without getting quickly shut down by the IN or IISS.

Sorry, but relative velocities between stars are *way* under c. Try
10-100 km/sec. *Maybe* 1000 km/sec in unusual situations. These are
velocities a ships drive can easily counter.

Also, consider this. If the relative velocity between two stars is 1%
of c, then in 362 years, they\'ll have moved an entire *parsec* with
respect to each other. Since the maps of the Imperium and surrounds
show the same stellar positions on maps that span multiple *thousands*
of years, that means that the average relative velocities must be less
than half a parsec in 4000 years.

Half a parsec is approximately 100,000 AU. So we get a velocity of less
than 25 AU/year. 1 AU is approximately 150 million km. So we get less
than 3.75 billion km/year. Which reduces to about 120 km/sec. QED.

120 km/sec is about 3 hours and 20 minutes of acceleration at 1g.
During which time the ship covers 720,000 km. Which isn\'t that far from
the 100 diameter limit of some planets.

So if the velocity diff between the start and destination is 120
km/sec, you could just make a run to jump with constant accel in the
proper direction and come out more or less at rest with respect to the
destination system. 

Of course, if you are at rest with respect to the *star*, you are
moving at 20-40 km/sec with respect to the planet. But that\'s a minor
correction. And since exit time from jump can vary by a number of
hours, and the planet is moving, you aim for were it would be at the
"median" time, plus some offset so that you don\'t wind up sitting dead
in space in "front" of the planet if the time is off a bit.

So conserving velocity can be done, and merely adds a bit of extra
flavor to the game. Heck, I can see situations when a ship *wants* to
exit at high speed. A scout making a recon run during a war, for
example. Just offset the course so that he *should* miss the planet and
any satellites, and jump in with a high velocity in the "wrong"
direction. He\'ll go zipping by faster than anybody can catch him, and
be able to save his manuevering capacity for dodging lasers and PAWs.

The charts *may* be based on accelerating until you are halfway there
and then decelerating from there to the limit, so you arrive "at rest".
Or they may be based on accelerating all the way, so you arrive moving
like a bat out of hell. The two situations give *very* different
answers. 

Also, you have to remember that a ship launching from the surface of
the planet starts at 1/2 diameter.

 4H-> 1He4 +.7%of mass in energy
56H->1Fe56 +1% of mass in energy

So as you can see, we get 70% of the energy in the H->He step. Given
the temperatures and pressures required, the rest of the steps are
*definitely* not worth it. 

The second step tends to be:
	3He4->1C12 + .03% of mass in energy
As you can see, it yeilds less than 1/20th of the energy that the first
step yeilds.

The C-N-O cycle (Bethe Solar Phoenix) may yeild more, but I\'m a bit too
tired to calculate that. Things *definitely* go downhill after that.

Depends on which version of Traveller you are talking about. A ton of
hydrogen should produce around 600 billion GigaJoules of energy. Most
traveller reactors aren\'t that efficient. Even so, just about all of
them have the *powerplant* using quite small amounts of power. It\'s the
jump drives that use tons of LH2.

Of course, this means that with some creative engineering, you could

Alas, pushing against a planet has a problem. The faster you are moving
relative to it, the more push it takes to increase your velocity
(conservation of energy). A few years back we worked out the applicable
equations. It\'s a fun concept, but bear *no* resemblance to the way
thrusters are described as working.

This has the same problem as the above. Conservation laws *require*
that the amount of energy required go up as the square of the velocity.
So whatever amount of energy it takes to get you to 1 km/sec, it take
*4* times that to get to 2 km/sec and *9* times as much to get to 3
km/sec. Thus you rapidly run into diminishing returns.

Thrusters as described in Traveller are flat out impossible. They let
you get energy for free. There are several ways of using thrusters to
build a perpetual motion machine.

Reaction drives are far more efficient than the "real" thrusters I
described above. This is because they push against their own exhaust,
which always starts out at rest with respect to the ship. Thus it
always take the same energy to accelerate. Only problem is when you run
out of fuel. :-)

It depends on the reaction. Some produce helium 4, some produce tritium,
some produce helium 3. The ones that produce H3 or He3 tend to also
produce protons or neutrons. This is a real nuisance, especially the
neutrons. 

> How is it removed from RW reactors?

It isn\'t removed from current reactors. The reactions don\'t last long
enough. So the plasma is just allowed to disperse.

> How will it be removed when a self-sustaining reaction is started?

Actually, that\'s a misconception about fusion. Unlike fission reactors,
there\'s no such thing as a "self-sustaining" reaction outside of stars.
Instead, what you have is a reaction that can continue as long as the
reactor provides the proper conditions (mostly electromagnetic forces
to keep the temp and pressure high enough). Kill the power to the
confinement fields, and the plasma will dissipate rather than explode.
The fusion reaction will stop dead, and the plasma will expand until it
hits the reactor walls, where it\'ll cool *rapidly*. You\'ll get some
*nasty* "scorching" of the reactor vessel. Maybe even some moderate
damage. But it *won\'t* go "boom". 

Also, some reactor types (inertial confinement) don\'t even *try* to
create a continous reaction. Instead they use lasers or particle beams
to implode fuel pellets. This momentarily creates the required temp and
pressure for fusion, and in that moment most of the fusibles in the
pellet will fuse, the plasma disperses, and another pellet is dropped
in. Repeat indefinitely. The radiation (and possibly the heating from
the plasma expanding) are used to generate power.

In a magnetic or electrostatic reactor, the reaction is more or less
continuous. The fields are such that they\'ll confine the plasma that is
being fused. With a bit of creative engineering, you can direct the
"waste" out of the reactor to where it can be dumped. But do keep in
mind that the *amount* of waste is quite small. 

> What exactly is plasma?

The fourth state of matter. Solid, liquid, gas, plasma. A plasma
consists of free atoms, somewhat like a gas. But the atoms are not
grouped into molecules, and are at least partially ionized. That is,
they are missing at least *some* of the electrons from their outer
electron shells. The stripped electrons are floating more or less
freely thru the plasma. 

The most commonly seen plasmas are those in neon (*not* fluorescent)
lights. That space inside the tube that is glowing is a plasma.

Just as it requires higher temperatures (energy per particle) for a
substance to be a gas than to be a liquid, being a plasma requires even
higher energies. But plasmas are a good example of the difference
between *heat* and temperature. 

A plasma in a sign tube may be at many, many thousands of degrees. But
since the pressure inside is a near vacuum, the total heat content is
miniscule. 

> How would the exhaust of a fusion reactor be removed from a starship

Check out how *little* hydrogen is required for power. Approximately
.7% of the mass is converted to energy. 1 ton of hydrogen will
therefore produce 993 kg of waste, and 658e18 Joules of energy.  Except
that Traveller reactors seem to be rather inefficient. :-) So they\'ll
produce less power for a given amount of hydrogen. Still, the amount of
waste per megajoule will be rather low. 

In J-space, you could dump it back into the fuel tanks after using it
to preheat the incoming fuel. Or you could dump it overboard. In normal
space, dumping it overboard is the easiest.

If you are one of the folks who says that that jump fuel is burned for
energy, then you\'ve got a lot of waste to dump into normal space. If
you think it\'s used for something else, then that\'s where the hydrogen
goes, and fusion waste doesn\'t enter into it.

A fusion rocket just dumps *everything out the tail end after fusing
some of the hydrogen. So it\'ll have an exhuast of high temp hydrogen
plasma with some helium impurities. It\'ll be so hot that it\'ll be
invisible except for a slight violet glow. Most of the radiation will
likely be in the UV and X-ray range.

Nothing.  Well, actually it probably does mean something, that\'s probably
quite rude, but as far as Traveler is concerned, it\'s the family name of a
group of, er, shall we say, "talented" weapon designers who are

Jump energy from black globes is a whole \'nuther debate.  The Jumpspace
article would seem to indicate (and the black globe issue would probably
support) that lhyd isn\'t needed, especially if antimatter power is available.
But that rationale, you could possibly transmit power to another ship and get
the same "jump station" effect, couldnt u?  BTW, has power transmission (from
satellites) been addressed anywhere?  I remember reading bout it in a few
places of science fiction.

Jump projectors have never been dealt with by FF&S standards.  Deciding on
their operation is difficult when we don\'t have specifics on their
composition, size, mass, etc.  A reasonable debate about that requires a more
in-depth discussion on them, period.  Annic Nova is an odd duck, like
Leviathan.

We\'re only told (to my knowledge) what drop tanks do w/ max jump and my theory
on them saves their operation, though the economic concerns for them remain,
for you.

Original CT (book 2? HG?) is so abstract, that it makes a look into the
workings of jump drives and jump theory difficult, at best.  YMMV.

Their time of introduction and the uncertainty about them alleviates this.
You may well be right, but they dont\' *have to* have the catastrophic effect
on economics unless u want them to.  Perhaps they *should* have that effect,
anyways.

Drop tanks have always been an asterisk in Traveller ship design.  Their
application in that substandard ship is hardly the catastrophic thing you
proclaim it as.  There is only a \'profound implication\' if you want there to
be one.  I\'ve always seen them as a marginal technology in a marginal ship
design, but then I (nor my players) had preconceptions on the operation of J-
drives, either.  It seems to me like a strawman, though it\'s possible I\'m
reading more into it than you intend.  Do you have any PCs running around in
Gazelles?  How many times are Gazelles encountered?  Their operation is
something intended as innovative, but hardly with a clear advantage to it\'s
usage, especially if there seems to be some danger to the ship their used on
(as the TNS entry indicates).

Because there\'s no significant advantage to their usage, and even if there is
political and economic considerations can keep an innovative and superior
technology stigmatized and non-utilized.  Because there\'s a possibility (or
threat or proganda) of danger to the ship (and thus it\'s crew) using them.
Linked with the above point.

C\'mon.  That\'s just silly.  Do your PCs run a shipyard?  Do they get custom
designs commissioned?  By a starport even capable of doing drop tanks?  Just
because a couple gazelle\'s come in and do their thing, what are the players
going to notice?  They might fear their bombs.  They might think their just
plumbed fuel tanks or something that have been dropped.  The gazelle is hardly
going to cause a drop tank flourishing or panick.  It\'s fairly easy to say
there\'s a reason why the use of drop tanks is limited to the gazelle?

Sure it is, at least compared to the Core.  The players will never see the
result, as on the Imperiums scale and rate of movement and "age of sail" feel,
it could be hundreds of years before they make their way into common usage.
It\'s only a problem if u want it to be (or have some interest in getting rid
of them).

Jump projectors, not drop tanks, are the hokey new technology.  How do they
work, based on your model of jump drive?  Who knows.  Have they *ever*
appeared in one of your campaigns to be a consideration?  It\'s ancients
technology and Clarke\'s Law applies.  Black globes have big problems on their
own, and transfering the energy to jump dooms most jump theories.  Economic
changes.  You could have a beef here.  It\'s ignoring it in a really sad way
IMO, as there\'s plenty of ways to rationalize how it will never have an effect
in your campaigns time period.  It\'s hardly going to go against the inertia of
established ship building interests, much less Vilani culture.  It\'s not going
to pop up and be the rage in starship design in the forseeable future.

Look at the way you deal with the problem.  You can\'t believe they have an
instant effect.  Given the date of their introduction (presuming early 1100s),
it\'ll be decades, if not centuries before they make a widespread appearance.
I\'m not sure on the scale of Far Trader, as I don\'t have it, but don\'t see how
it would affect free traders, in particular, much less anything less than a
megacrop, in general,  before the centuries hash mark.  It\'s not a concern.  I
wonder why you\'re against them so, as none of the reasons you\'ve given will
have any effect on campaigning unless u want it to.

I know there\'s a Jumpspace article in one of the JTAS by one Marc Miller that
lays out the basics.  GDW always kept an emphasis on "Lanthanum Coils" and the
Jumpspace article does talk about a grid of some kind being present in a
"strong hull."  Jump takes a week on average (+/- 10%, though that varies too
usually expressed as 6-8 days, for simplicity).  Jump drives consume liquid
hydrogen, the exact use of which is the subject of enormous debate, as there
hasn\'t been anything proclaimed from on-high.  

DGP, for some reason, put the emphasis on the grid half heartedly mentioned in
the Jumpspace article and completely ignored the coils.  This has become a
popular view, due to the popularity of the Starship Operators Manual to its
owners.  The fuel is all guzzled in a "high efficiency" reactor (for some
reason unusable as a power system for an incredibly powerful weapon) which is
the "drive."

The original FF&S said that the fuel, collectively, had uses as "fuel,
coolant, and displacement mass" and leaves all mention out of jump grids, as
everything by GDW does.  Coils were again mentioned, though not in FF&S, as
they were in the Library Data and Imperial Encyclopedia.

FFS2 has the hydrogen being used to maintain a jump bubble that keeps out
jumpspace (which in the Jumpspace article is purely done by the hull grid.
Lanthanum grids are again present, and I see no mention of coils at all.  

So, in short, no official theory.  IMO DGP and FFS2 went too far in explaining
something while FF&S\' is easily malleable into others (though I believe GDW
mentioned somewhere that the SoM wasn\'t accurate).

No, if the tanks are dropped it can do Jump 6.

>(drop tanks consumed before drop?

Yes. As the write up for the Gazelle states "The ship has high capacity
accumulators in it\'s jump drive, and completely burn it\'s fuel prior to jump,
storing the energy while the tanks are jettisoned."

Note that the L-Hyd tanks represent _all_ of the Gazelles fuel tankage except
for a small amount of internal
tankage used for the Manueveur drive.

The book also states " but the tanks must be replaced before the ship can jump
again"

>Or internal consumed and/or transferred to

As written in JTAS 4, the Gazelle can jump anywhere between Jump 1 and Jump 4
with it\'s tankage intact, it can jump up to jump 6 by dropping it\'s L-Hyd
tanks, but it can then not jump again.

There is _no_ concept of moving fuel from external tankage to internal
tankage, because the "external tankage" represents _all_ of the Gazelle\'s jump
fuel tankage. Note that the "drop-tanks" ae not called drop tanks in JTAS 4,
they are called L-HYd tanks and they are called "droppable in an emergency".
This is actually different from  true drop tanks which are designed to be
disposable and dropped as the mission requires.

Having said all that, the Gazelle as written up in Supplement 9 - Fighting
Ships is completely different.

That claims that the Gazelle has enough internal tankage for Jump 2, and that
it _can_ Jump without the L-Hyd tanks fitted.

So, there is cannon reference for _both_ concepts, and it is contradictory,
unless one handwaves by saying that the Fighting Ships Gazelle is an upgraded
and modified version.  This is suported by the fact that the Gazelle pictured
in Fighting Ships looks quite different and quite a bit fatter than the one
pictured in JTAS 4

Oh, and there I was hoping it would turn out to be some cool classical

The Bolo books were not written by William Keith, but by Keith Laumer. 
They do deal with large AI-equipped tanks, and are excellent reading.

It appears that my previous message reflected an incomplete

It says that the jump projectors induce the jump
field, not disrupt one being produced by the target ship.

As to what you need to do solve the problem, making drop
tanks use some fuel only partially solves the problem of their
impact on the background and trying to tweak all the other
bit of the background to justify it is, IMO, not worth it.

I will comment that, if you really want drop tanks in your
campaign (though I think it is a mistake to think that
having a certain technology will make a game more "fun")
then you are better off just saying "they exist, don\'t
look behind the curtain".

Just a clarification.  Stars in our galaxy have relative velocities
way under the speed of light.  Stars 1/2 way across the universe
are moving away from us at a fair fraction of the speed of
light.

Very impressive!

However, a few nit picks:

When inputing a UWP, I can\'t go back when I\'ve made a mistake.

How to select stars in unclear.

Here is my test case (From First Survey):
Kuue Ir/ 2634 Antares (a world I\'ve unimaginatively renamed Aquana and
have developed a little bit to serve as a homeworld for a pair of
characters
IMTU).

B99AABB-B  Ind Wa Hi  920  F1 D M8 D

What I can\'t figure out is how to input the stars.
If I select D for size, I can only select DF, and not F1 (which is
available at
other
size settings), and the same goes for the M8.

I don\'t have WBH, so maybe there is some glitch between it and FS.

Have you thought about a Galactic 2.4 file output?

ISTR that the stick axis is sllightly inclined from fore/aft as they

isn\'t central? Anyone here driven one who could confirm this?

Oops. Mea culpa -- must have gotten lost in the shuffle.

Okay, first draft:

GURPS Space, p. 38, says insurance costs 10% of vessel cost per year -- go
with that for now. This is presumably insurance against loss, and pays the
replacement cost of the vessel. It would also include liability insurance
for accidents incurred onboard, and coverage for loss of or damage to
cargo. Losses due to gross negligence or dereliction on the part of Captain
or crew will not be covered, however.

Ships with a mortgage are already paying the bank\'s insurance as part of
the mortgage payment -- if the ship is lost, the bank\'s investment is
covered. Similarly, if the characters charter (rent) a ship, the owner has
factored his insurance costs into the charter party.

Ships are not required to have insurance. Large merchant lines often
"self-insure": that is, they have enough cash in their operating budget to
make up losses out of pocket. Free traders who try this trick had probably
better have a certified escrow account at a well-known bank, or they will
have a hard time convincing shippers and passengers to trust them.

I have some historical loss rates and such, and I just picked up a big
thick book on general insurance and risk. I\'ll see if I can\'t cobble
together a better answer in time for the "Designers\' Notes" article.

Here\'s the questions:
How much energy is needed from the black globe for a jump? I thought that

gets used in a jump powered by a black globe? Would the Black globe just
give enough power to  put the ship into jump space, but not enough to keep
the jump field up and cause a mis-jump? Would a jump induced by a black

Is the explanation in HG/MT a mistake and the relation of black globes to
jumps different. (Like no fuel is necessary, for example)

In High Guard, your Power Plant needed to provide a certain number of
Energy Points before you could burn your jump fuel and jump. Perhaps
this energy was to prime the capacitors so the rapid jump fuel burn
would go properly, it\'s hard to tell - but a black globe could provide this
initial energy as well.

Powering your jump from a black globe doesn\'t save you any fuel, but
it can keep you from having to take weapons and shields off-line in the
heat of battle to bring the jump drive on-line.

DGP\'s Ship Operator\'s Manual then seperated the two - they even
presented a situation where a ship lost it\'s power plant while on a
long, slow vector towards a star. It saved itself with a carefully plotted
in-system jump - they were able to plot the jump so carefully that they
came out sitting still (relative to the local system) at a safe distance,
ready for a tug to come and get them.

I don\'t have my copies of MT or TNE on hand, and I don\'t recall their
explanations for this situation.

Alas, pushing against a planet has a problem. The faster you are moving
relative to it, the more push it takes to increase your velocity
(conservation of energy). A few years back we worked out the applicable
equations. It\'s a fun concept, but bear *no* resemblance to the way
thrusters are described as working.

His example of a Gondolier pushing against a planet wasn\'t extended
by him to the starship pushing against the planet - the way I read it,
in his TU thrusters push against "space-time" itself. Depending on how
you read relativity, you are never moving relative to space-time at all - you
only move in relation to objects within space-time.

Not that I understand the physics well enough to see what effects this
would have on how thrusters work.

Slight problem. Your skimming run will necessarily be a straight line
thru around 20,000 km of GG atmosphere. It\'s *really* unlikely that all
of that will be even *relatively* calm.

Well, one thing to consider is that with t-plates, you can do some very
strange things.. Stuff like have units "hover" over any point on the
planet\'s surface.

You can also do "forced orbits". These are where you are using your
drive to accelerate *towards* the planet (or even an empty point in
space) hard enough to let you maintain an "orbit" than is far smaller
than your velocity would otherwise allow. Things like 15-20 minute
"orbits" around an Earthlike planet. 

This lets you stay closer to the planet, be moving fast, and make your
"orbit" hard to predict (a slight change in the direction or amount of
thrust will make *huge* changes in your path).

I might be wrong here but...
For any two blackbody radiators the radiation in any given wavelength
segment would be higher in the high temp than in the low temp. So a 300
Kelvin blackbody would radiate far less in the IR than an 1000 000 Kelvin
one but the peak wavelength would be much lower for the high temp one (peak
wavelength inversely proportional to temperature).

Well, actually, the High Energy Weapons division is the only one that\'s been
heard from lately, as the originator of the Famille, Rod Elliot, has gone and
done something inexplicable: he graduated and got, like, a job and a life or
something. Ross Coburn says he still plays in his FTF game. I feel for you
Ross, honest I do!

	Hengabar Spofulam, Ditzies older, genetically related family member (the
lines are blurred...it is thought that the Famille Spofulam is the end result
of some seriously illegal experiments.) is the head of a diverse company;
their main money maker is starships. Such as the Moonshine, a perfectly legal,
very high speed, legal, heavily armed, oh did I mention it\'s actually legal,
starship that is officially on the books as a fast courier. The fact that most
of their customers pay for it with large cargo containers of cash in
untraceable small denominations is entirely coincidental.

There were also designs for a fusion+ powered pogo stick, which under the
right conditions can reach orbital velocity. Kids are advised to use all the
safety measures.

There was also a grav bike, which, with the clearly marked and inexplicably
simple to remove governor, wouldn\'t kill the rider outright. Without the
governor, most riders had a lifespan of approximately 6.7 seconds. With it
they lived _much_ longer. Often as much as a month!

It is illegal on 365 different Imperial worlds. (at last count)

Study: DNA Conducts Electricity

By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer 

Strands of DNA might someday be used as wires
in computer chips and transistors, researchers
reported today in the journal Nature.

Hans-Werner Fink and Christian Schoenenberger
of the University of Basel in Switzerland found
that DNA conducts electricity as well as a good
semiconductor. A semiconductor carries electricity
better than an insulator but not as well as a
conductor like copper.

If DNA strands could be made with a switch to turn
the current flowing through them on and off, they
could be used to build extremely tiny electrical
devices, the researchers said.

Fink said he knows of no metallic wires that can be
made as small or as regular as DNA strands. A strand
is 2 billionths of a meter thick, or 
one-forty-four-thousandths of the diameter of a
medium-size human hair.

DNA strands might even be able to wire themselves
together.

Molecules at the end of DNA strands will link
themselves to certain other molecules, so it might
be possible to create a wiring grid by laying down
these target molecules as terminals and letting
the DNA strands attach themselves, the researchers
said.

Gary Schuster, a chemistry professor at the Georgia
Institute of Technology, said he suspects electrons
flow through DNA much differently than in a wire.
And whether the research will lead to a practical
use of DNA as wiring he called "a wide-open
question."

    'body' => 'Here\'s my Cr0.02 on jump projectors, for what it\'s worth.

Jump Projectors are TL-21 technology, as far in the future from 3I TL 
as 3I is from our current TL.  It appears to operate by inducing a 
jump field around the target ship, shunting it into jumpspace without 
calculated jump coordinates, thus guaranteeing a misjump.

PLEASE NOTE:  The following explanations address a number of current 
operating models on the function of Jump Space and J-Drives.  While I 
prefer grids myself, I am trying to address all situations.  Nothing 
herein is meant to be taken in any other way except as helpful 
suggestions and possible explanations.  I am in no way questioning 
anyone\'s TU theory on how J-space/J-drives function, nor attempting 
to impune anyone\'s TU through making these suggestions.  In short, I 
am not trying to rekindle the Jumpspace Debate again.  Repeat, I 
don\'t want to start the old Jumpspace Debate again.  With that having 
been said, I move on to the more conceptual aspects of this post.

For Lanthanum Grid fans, the Jump Projector imposes a resonance field 
within the lanthanum-doped grid on the exterior of the ship, opening 
a portal into J-space, and the ship is shifted into a misjump as a 
natural result of that action.  (In the SOpM model, hydrogen is 
not bled off into Jumpspace throughout the jump to maintain the 
field.  Once generated, you\'re stuck, for better or worse, until you 
emerge at the end of the jump.)

For Lanthanum Coil fans, the Jump Projector imposes a resonance 
field within the Lanthanum Coil, forcing it to generate a premature, 
uncalculated jump field, and shunts the vessel into J-space without a 
predetermined jump vector.  Thus, the target ship is forced into a 
misjump.

For Star Trek techno-babble fans, the Jump Projector induces a fold 
in the sub-space field structure, inducing a temporary wormhole 
which, according to the script, the crew cannot affect or avoid, and 
must spend the next 40-some-odd minutes dealing with.  [Sorry, 
I know it\'s not Traveller, but I couldn\'t resist.  ;P]

Problems with these interpretations occur if you subscribe to the 
J-drive model that requires hydrogen to be vented in order to 
maintain the jump field integrity during the week-long trip through 
Jumpspace.  While I have never seen canonical reference to this, 
enough people follow it to make me assume that such exists, so the 
Jump Projector does induce some problems with that model.  Here\'s a 
kinda cheesy shot at explaining that:

The Jump Projector actually uses Matter Transport to introduce a 
TL-21 microbot to the exterior of the vessel.  The Bot quickly avoids 
detection (using TL-21 Stealth) and accesses the Jump Field 
Projectors via the "small grid of wires" on the outside of the ship.  
Using anti-matter, the bot produces enough energy to induce a Jump 
Field into the coil and/or grid, forcing the vessel into J-space.  
While in J-space, the bot uses anti-matter to generate Hydrogen using 
the Matter Transport technology, thus keeping the field open.  Upon 
arrival at the destination, the bot commits self-destruction, 
removing evidence of its existence from the material universe.

Like I said, my explanation is cheesy, but an explanation, 
nonetheless.  I don\'t like it, but it was the best I could come up 
with on only ten minutes of thought.  I wouldn\'t mind hearing 
something better.

Personally, I think of the J-field as pushing the vessel into a 
higher energy state across J-space, and then the vessel returns to a 
ground state over the course of the next week, finally emerging into 
N-space when the vessel is again back to its "ground state."  
Conceptually, it fits my world view better, and I don\'t have to worry 
about hydrogen supplies throughout the trip.  But that\'s just me and 
MTU.  In the OTU, it hasn\'t been established concretely, nor is it 
likely to.  And in YTU, that\'s your decision. Either way, it\'s 
all still Traveller to me.  YMMV  :)

I have a problem with high penetration lasers in an atmosphere; above a
certain power level they\'d turn the air into plasma which would be
extremely hard to shine through. GGG has info on this and to me it seems to
rule out lasers as tankbusters. (I\'m well aware that high pen lasers are
serious Canon stuff and I wouldn\'t want to lose them but can somebody come
up with a good handwave why they should work?).

Why would it be a straight line?  Certainly they can maneuver, though not
as radically as if they were in space, and if they mapped the GG weather
patterns it should give them a fairly good chance of avoiding the turbulence.

I\'ve always figured out how much energy (In EP or MW for CT or MT) the
capaciters can hold.  The amount of capaciters is based off of the formula
derived from the black globe rules for determining how much energy the Jump
capaciters can hold.  Once that number is generated, I use the rule that
the jump capaciters need to be powered within 30 minutes, so an antimatter
powerplant needs to have twice the hourly output to charge the capaciters.

EX:

Jump Capaciters hold 1000MW of energy
Antimatter PowerPlant to power J-Drive needs to have an hourly output of
2000MW so that the 1000MW can be generated in 1/2 an hour.

YMMV, but it works for me.

You don\'t get energy for free.  Energy is still conserved (or at least it
could be, if the numbers in the game system are correct.  I haven\'t checked
them)  The law of physics you are breaking is conservation of momentum.
That does indeed appear to some from nowhere.  For a possible RL

This is an interesting idea, but if it is being used as a weapon, why
protect the ship while it is J-Space?  Why not just let the field collapse
and take care of the problem?  After all, if the ship is still intact it
might come back to haunt you later in the conflict.

systems that I work with on a dayly basis.  There are curtain physical
realities that are very unlikely to change in any length of time as they are
defined in the media and physics (example the speed on light in a vacume).
All I was trying to do was add a little vera similitude to an otherwise
unbelievable discrition.  Traveller is generally a fairly hard science game
with a minimum of \'magic\' gaggets.  That is one of the things that first
drew me to traveller 20 years ago.  It was my intent to help define a system
to alow it\'s capabilities to be more easily defined in game terms.  It is
obvious that you are not interested in the opinions of others which if true
beggs the question, Why are you on a mail list whose purpose is the free
exchange of ideas about a shared hobby?

Noone has to aggree with me and I am not saying my impressions are what must
be, I am simple stating my opinion as are we all with the posible exception
of MM who can, when he chooses, state the rules but then as GMs we can
change those as well.

Why are you being baligerant?  I have not nor do I intend to personally
attack you or your ideals.  I am simple state my oppinion.

I never said that nanotech is not part of the traveller universe.  I said it
was not canon.  I know of no traveller device who\'s explaination of it\'s
operation includes nanotech and I was also saying, in my way, that I did not
feel comfortable introducing it as the explaination as I am not one the the
authors of traveller canon.

I do not have the book with me but IIRC the technical aspec is avoided by
abstracting it into a game mechanic that give the device a detection number
and targets a modifier based on stealth, size, speed, ect.  Sensors packages
are also for different enviroments which was by basic point.

BL?  What is that?  The rampart I am familiar with is out of CTs AHL and
IIRC is not nearly that big.  (30 or 50 tons displacement)  I dought a F15
carries 12000 pounds of sensor equipment.  It\'s sounds like a lot for an
attrition unit but perhaps this excessiveness is neccessary to explain it\'s
versitility.

I do not have SoM.  I said so before and I do not feel comforable trying to

And not at all realistic.  If they work the same, an F15 could detect the
apollo in orbit arround the moon with it\'s radar that can not penetrate the
van allan belts much less the ionosphere and is somehow able to pick up the
returned signal that in well below the noise threshold!

I did.  I did. No they are real world facts. I do. I did not.  I said the
human bandwidth was fixed without augmentation.  I stated some basic limits
to technology as far as the man machine interface is concurned.  They apply
at all tech levels to an unaugmented human.  That was what I was saying.
That computer power alone will not solve the information overload problem.

News to me.  I play CT and GT.  I have FF&S v1 and have read it (never used
it for designs, I got it after GV came out as a source for ideas)but I do
not recall neural jacks.  Also nowhere in any rampart discription have I
seen a note that a neural jack was needed for proper operation.  GV makes
such notes for jacked gear but has not added jacks to the TU AFAIK.

TL-9 vs TL-12 was not my point.  Also the game mechanic and design system is
being compared wheather you wish to admit it or not sence it is the medium
of the test.  Example:  Try and design a tank using high guard.  Can\'t be
done.  There are no rules for tanks in HG.  It\'s a space ship design system.
If there are no rules for ducted fan engines, RAM, Tomahawks, Polaris
missles, exc you can\'t test your assumptions, you end up testing the game
mechanics.

Really, then what is the power to weight ratio of the following real work
systems in FF&S:

Raidial IC fix speed and adjustable prop:
Turbo prop:
Ram jet:
ducted fan jet:
Non jet Ducted fan.

What about the effects of the folowing features:

Super chargers:
Variable pitch turbines:
Stub wings:
Hard points:
Pylons:
RAM:
Thermal masking:


Game systems are inherently limited by what they choose to cover and to what
degree of accuracy and depth.  Game systems are by difinition limited and
the universe is by (some) definitions infinite.

Why do you assume based on limited information drawn from flawed simulations
designed by non experts (There can be no expert of space war as there has
never been one in human experience) that your assumptions are correct?  So
we are dealing with premise, supositions, and logical progressions from them
them, not fact except where we touch on the real world.

My basic premises are these:

1) A system build to operate in an enviroment will generally perform better
in the enviroment it was designed for than one that it was not designed for.

2) A system designed to perform a particular function will generally do that
function better than a system design for many general functions.

3) If for some reason of senergy that the above rules do not apply to a
particular pair of test units being evaluated then the lessons learned in
the evaluation can be used to improve the specialty system to perform better
than the generalist system in the function of the specialty system.  If this
is not posible for what ever reason (ussually money) the specialty system
will be replaced by the generalist system with it\'s system configure for
optimum performance in the new enviroment.  This is design evolution.

No, you said that.  I said \'all other things being equal\' an air fighter
will beat a space fighter in the air.

\'all other things being equal\' mean just that.  weight, cost, size, TL...
ALL other things being equall.  That is what I have been saying all along.
I have no dought that a TL15 will beat a TL9.  TL represents design
improvements so of course the TL15 will win.  That is a no brainer and I
said so in one of original posts to this thread.

I have designed hundreds of systems both real and in game.  I have design
cars, planes, and spacecraft for games in several different design systems.
It is not I who is going to be embarrassed.  These posts have been cut and
pasted and much of the original meaning has gone into the bit bucket.  I can
hardly blame anyone for miss understanding my premisses at this point.

I\'ve design both over the years.  I do not care for battle riders.  I think
they are an aboration caused by over abstration in the game system but that
is neither here nor there.

The analagy is a very good one as the space fighter will be hauling along
the weight of systems that are only usefull in space while the air fighter
could have everthing that the space fighter has that is useful in the air
and replace the \'space systems\' weight with more armor or weapons.  At the
very least the air fighter would need less life support, food, waste relief
system (or less complicated ones) ect due to the much shorter time a pilot
is in an air fighter.  

Take your basic rampart pull out its\' life suport system and replace it with
an air compressor, and more armor, chaff pods, flares, or whatever the game
system allows for defensive systems and you have a more survivable design in
the atmosphere.  

What about the computer?  Take our the navagation program for space flight
and replace it with a treat library, anti missle program, or a better
gunnery program.  Remove the 100000 mile sensor system and replace it a
10000 mile one with 10 time the resolution and add some ECM and ECCM as well.  

Decrease the missle size and weight and carry more missles or increase the
warhead size.  They only have to fly for a fraction of the time in the
atmosphere so less fuel is needed and the fuel does not need an oxidizer.
If the missle use thrusters your batteries can be a lot smaller.  

Engagement ranges are much shorter as well so refocus and retune your
lassers for atmospheric operation to increase damage over shorter ranges.
In the GT weapons design system you can trade range, damage, and cost to
suit your combat enviroment.

Also decrease your engine size to match the design\'s top atmospheric speed
limit (GV designs).  Use the weight saving for more usefull stuff.

Also let\'s look at $$$.  In GT space capability comes at a cost in $s
(sealed hull and life support).  The air fighter can spend that money on
more bang the space fighter can not.  Assuming the same starting budget.

See the point?

Well, IMTU:

"Fresher"  -  small  room  found  on  space  vessels  and   space
    facilities.  Includes a toilet-unit, wash basin,  and  shower
    unit (whether water based or some alternative).

"Toilet" - small room.  Includes a  toilet-unit  and  wash  basin
    only.

"Latrine" - temporary outdoor  ground  structure  used  by  Army/
    Marines.  Includes one or more toilets and  _may_  have  wash
    basins.

"Kidku" - Vilani term.  Similar facilities to a "fresher".  Found
    in office blocks and public places ... for public use.

"Head"/"WC"/etc - slang for "fresher" or "toilet".

True but at leat it would cancel out the effect of a design system biased

In GT with GV weapons design it might be posible to have a fair comparison
but even then you have to set the rules.

Same number of vehicles, Or total $s, or whatever combination of limits you
place on the designs and those limit in themselves my deside the result.

It depends on the parameters you decide for the test.  Weight, volume,
credits, number of crew, ect.  Just like TCS.  More crew less $s favor the
fighters.  Less crew more dollars makes for a more even fight of it.  At
least that would be by quess without first trying it.

Partly, it is my point and it does have gaming implications.  In war it come
down to who has the most resources and who uses them best.  Japan had planes
at the end of WW2 but ran out of trained pilots to fly them.  The pilots
were the scare resource.  Russia had the opposite problem at the start of
the war.  Plenty of people but not enough hardware.

Gaming has similer trade of.  If your character uses suppresive fire he uses
up ammo he may need later.  If he does not there may not be a later.
Resource allocation is the heart of stratagy and tactics.  What have I got
and what can I do with it?

Not, true.  The air craft fight from the atmosphere.  No \'boost\' phase.
Second any planet that consedes space superiorty will likely loose so 24
deep meson sites on the planet and 24 more on the moon with a massively
redundant remote sensor system.  No more space ships in orbit.  The areo
fighters are dispersed to hidden bases with only one or two plane or posted
combat ready in wilderness areas using VTOL to take on the space fighters
when the attack to try to clear the way for the space ships to get in close.

You need to decide what you\'re talking about here. Are you talking about
a TL-15 space fighter that\'s been modified for better interface/atmosphere
work, or are you talking about a combat vehicle that\'s limited to 
atmospheric work? A space fighter optimized for work in atmosphere will

to atmosphere only gets to play if the space fighters allow it.

Charles, you\'re sounding like a guy who designs sailing ships claiming

GDW\'s _Invasion Earth_ game had no air units, just SDB\'s, space fighters

well stay home.

This has been raised before. I must admit it wasn\'t really a priority. I

Orbit Zones, Stellar Mass and Stellar Luminosity for Size D stars are the
same throughout each Spectral Class. i.e. F0 to F9 has a Stellar Mass of
0.42 and Stellar Luminosity of 0.13. Therefore there is little point in
giving the user the option to select the whole Spectral Class. Hope that
clears things up.

>Have you thought about a Galactic 2.4 file output?

I have considered it, but I just don\'t think Galactic provides enough
information. i.e. no stellar details. The EWP and ESP file formats produced
by WBD will be supported by the next version of Tom Bont\'s Astrogator.

And on that note, where does one find sector files?  I\'ve been looking for

Which is why GT fusion plants have 200 year internal fuel supplies ;).  There\'s

Especially for TNE.

Personally, my grand unified theory (liberally culled from other people\'s
suggestions) is as follows.

Jump drives require power and displacement mass to operate. The
displacement mass is typically hydrogen, but can be a mixture of low atomic
mass gases. Hydrogen is prefered.

The hydrogen is typically consumed to generate power for the jump drive,
and also fed, through a surge tank and used to inflate a bubble of
realspace around the starship as jump is achieved. Non-hydrogen options are
less optimal than hydrogen bubbles, and may result in a misjump due to jump
field fluctuations.

The power for the jump drive energises the jump coil (typically lanthanum
although barium and other rare elements have been used), which generates a
jump field. This field is spherical. Some ships have a secondary lanthanum
(or other) grid which modulates and shapes the jump field. Otherwise, a
more powerful jump coil may be required to maintain some ships with
geometries such as needles in a jump field as the sphere has to be larger.
A modulated field conforms to the ships geometry.

By default, a jump drive can only achieve the maximum jump number it is
designed for. However, installing a jump governer in the drive allows a
ship to jump to lower levels (eg a j2 ship can do j1). The Jump coil
remains energised throughout the jump - the surface grid is typically only
energised for entry/breakout to manage the transition between jspace and
nspace.

The jump field is typically 1m off the starship hull, but may be more.
Staring at the jump interface can cause psychological problems with humans.
Contact or proximity to jspace may cause physiological problems too.

How about that,

I agree, but the text in both HG and MT say that the vessel is forced 
into a misjump.  (Other versions of Traveller are beyond my ken at 
the moment.)  I would assume that means that the vessel is not 
destroyed in transit (unless that\'s the result of the misjump mishap, 
should you use those rules.)  Otherwise, the texts should say that 
the ship is destroyed, which it doesn\'t state.  So, I can only 
assume that the ship survives to get to the other end of the jump.  
(And I know that assumptions only make an a$$ out of me and Umption, 
but I gotta start somewhere.  :)

First, it must not be cultural, as technology works in the hands of 
every culture, provided skilled operators exist to make it work.  So, 
no "Cannot Kill" dogma is going to do as a handwave for why the ship 
survives.  At least, for me, it won\'t, and I\'m sure others will 
agree.

Since the ship survives, and this suggested handwave was only given 
for those who feel that Hydrogen is used to maintain the Jump Field 
Bubble, something must be generating that Hydrogen in their TU; 
otherwise the ship is always destroyed, and one of my two earlier 
handwaves can work to cover the situation.

As to what generates the Hydrogen needed to maintain the Jump Field 
Bubble in their TU, I don\'t know.  I figured that something must be 
producing it, since the Jump Projector is not listed as having an 
exception regarding the results of a ship being forced into misjump 
without sufficient fuel to sustain the trip.  Therefore, the impetus 
to the jump, and the means to make it a "successful trip" should come 
from the TL-21 Jump Projector.  The microbot was the first, 
admittedly cheesy, handwave that came to mind.

For me, whether or not the Grid or Coil is the source of the field, 
the Jump Field maintains its integrity once generated, and there\'s no 
need for the Hydrogen support.  (I prefer to see it as energy 
interaction as opposed to matter interaction which forms and 
maintains the Jump Field.)  IMTU, and it won\'t stop me from playing 
in a game where it doesn\'t work this way.

Still, if Hydrogen support is needed, it must come from somewhere.  
So how does the TL-21 Jump Projector do it?

 Turning the double "L" into a "Y" is primarily a Spanish thing, though some
French probably do the same thing. The Disney Italian reference is to the
tendency of cinematic Italians to _strongly_ accent at least one syllable
per word.

To Whom it Mat Concern:

The Type-214 Heavy Gauss Weapon is a product of Gridlore Technologies, LIC,
and we retain exclusive right to it and it\'s proprietary design features.

In addition, Sir Arameth Gridlore has a long-standing legal dispute with
Famile Spofulam, which I am not at liberty to discuss.

To that end, I must demand that no further messages attempt to link our
Type-214 HGW with Famile Spofulam VP D. Spofulam.  Failure to comply will
result in prompt legal action.

2300 is a hard sci-fi game. Traveller is soft in comparison ;-) but hard

Low Level nanotech is discussed in the GT book.

Brilliant Lances, the TNE supplement/game which presents the stats for the
Rampart.

It masses 185.52 metric tonnes. It *displaces* 9 ton.
The MT version displaces 10 dt. This reflects the design system changes
from Striker/MT to TNE.

IIRC that\'s the Heavy Fighter, not the Rampart. And you\'re slipping back
into a TL7/TL8 example.

No, actually this rebuttal is flawed. An F15, as you said, does not carry a
TL15 6 metric tonne AEMS/PEMS system. If it did, and could power it, it is
possible that it could scan deep into space.

Bear in mind we are subject to significantly higher levels of data
assimilation than our ancestors, or even the generations who fought the 2nd
and 1st World Wars. We do not yet know what the capacity of the human mind
is. Holodynamic configuarble controls (canon since  MT) would go a long way
to help organise data management.

There is no reason why a canon Traveller ship could not be controlled by an
expert system (synaptic processing computer) which the operator just told
it to engage a specific ship. Additionally, there is no reason why such a
system could not preprocess the data sent to the command processor (human)
for decision.

But you can design all of the above using Striker, which has notes on how

Your point is? Or do you just want Gary to retype all the information from
FFS1 which you already have. I know and accept that you don\'t use it, but
you do have this information. If you\'re trying to say that the design
system approximates real life, fine, I for one accept that. However, the
Traveller design systems have tended to get better with evolution, and that
I would agree with having looked at GV2. FFS certainly reflects RL better
than HG or Striker.

But the game system, in this case any of Traveller\'s does define the
technological limits which effect the background; like it or not, aerospace
is not a significant cost penalty if you\'re lookig for a similar
performance.

Unless the general technology and performance of the non-dedicated system

Assuming equal technology levels. And the ability of the dedicated system
to operate within its design parameters. If these are exceeded, or pushed
to the limit, the general technology may have the edge.

There isn\'t one if you say equal cost and base the cost on the airfighter.
The only fair comparison is to see what the outcome of a battle between an
aerospace fighter (which we have agreed will be more expensive) and an
equal cost\'s worth of air fighter. This may mean a 3:1 engagement or worse,
but it would assess the performance.

My grandfather worked during WW2 at an army air corps base in Alaska,

and took off. There was a large and ever-growing mound at the end of 
his base\'s airstrip, made up of the planes that crashed on take-off.

Apparently the lion\'s share of these pilots had never been in an airplane
before they boarded the transport flight to Alaska.

That makes the assumption the the space force has total space superiority.
That is not nessarily the case with deep meson sites and other surface to
space weapons.  Also if the space fighter has to reach a surface target then
the space ship has to deal with the air fighter.

One thing you\'re missing from my question, Charles. What\'s the difference
between a TL15 gravitic, sealed cockpit, heavily armed and armored 
atmospheric fighter and a TL15 SDB/Gunship? Quite quickly at TL12+
you get to the point where there is no difference - just the insignia on the
pilot\'s uniform.

These hefty "space systems" you keep talking about is nothing more
than a fusion plant (which your laser-toting atmospheric fighter will need),
a weapons load (which you agree the atmospheric fighter will have as well), 
and a sensor suite (which the SF background identifies as perfectly capable of operating in atmosphere). In fact, if that atmospheric fighter of yours is 
able to engage at the ranges you claim, it will need the same sensor 
package anyway. We\'re running out of differences here.

As CT Striker says, aircraft stop existing as a truly viable seperate 
combat design once gravitics tech matures - they become space-capable 
gunboats, or you don\'t bother with them.

First attempt:

The grav focus beam that jackets a laser is emitted first, by a few
microseconds, to shunt the atmosphere out of the way, providing a laser a
near-vacuum path to travel down on it\'s merry way to the target.

What do you think, sirs?

For further info, according to MT, armour factor 40 is equivalent to
CT armour factor 0 (ie minimum armour for a spaceship).

So the armour of an Iowa is inferior to a Free Trader (on average).

In the UK:

Knighthoods (Soc A) are not inheritable, although having one would put
your heirs in the sort of company that made them more likely to earn
their own. Knights are not considered piers of the realm, do not have
a seat on the house of lords and aren\'t counted in the 869 piers.

The higher ranks were all hereditary, until the middle of this century
when "life piers" were introduced. Since then, almost all pierages have
been for life only. In the next millennium, only the life piers and 100
or so hereditary piers will be able to speak and vote in the lords.

Yes that is the way I meant it. IMTU thruster plates push at the
Universe. The change of momentum (of my ship) is given to \'the rest of
the universe\', thus momentum _is_ conserved, by giving a really really
BIG mass (see above) a really small change of velocity.

Yes, I know. Power requierement = Force * velocity.
This power usually has to be produced by your power plant.

You are right with this, too. But conservation of energy breaks _every_
thruster in traveller. Just take an average scout/courier: 500t, 2g
acceleration (as given in the TNE-handbook). As described in Traveller
(every version), acceleration to 100 km/s (not really fast for a ship in
Traveller) would take 5000 s, somewhat less than 1.5 hours. The kinetic
energy of the ship is about 2.5 * 10^15 J ( = 2.500.000 GJ). It takes a
500 GW power plant to produce that amount of energy in the given time,
the third of the power plant of a tigress battle ship

As per my suggestion, the Jump Projector forces the other ship to jump.  The
target then uses its jump drives and fuel in the process. You can assume  that
this means  that the target ship is co-opted some way or you can assume that it
screws up the field in some way to cause a jumping ship to misjump, as a large
gravity body might do.

How about adding the expanding field from the jump coil can be disorienting and may

Perhaps, but there are limits to human perceptions.  The airforce has been
working to put combat data into the best format for it\'s pilots.

Very true and that may well be the future of technological combat but that

I\'m sorry.  I do not have my books here.  I read but do not use FF&S1.  I
did not see any reference to any of the above systems.  Perhaps they are
portrayed under other game mechanics.  My point was that FF&S did not have
the depth to simulate the systems of an advanced air fighter.

The same can be said for the general technology and is more likely as it was

Agreed, that is likely.  I would also say that to properly test the
comparison that it would be necessary to test them under likely senerios.
Like a convoy attack, or infrastructure reduction attack.  It might also be
necessary to properly test the likely hood that such systems would be
fesible, for both sides, to give both sides a budget and fight out the
invassion.  It is generally considered that it take more resources to attack
that to defend but would that still hold true in a futuristic planitary
assault?  Gravity can be a great asset.

Against the space fleet you introduced to bombard the fighter bases, yes.
Frankly weapons systems rarely fight it out one on one.  They are part of a
combined force with a gaol and resources placed in oposition against another
force with differing goals and resources.  To properly test the fesibility
of the rampart or my hypothetical fighter you would need to test them under
the conditions they were designed you be under, planetary assault.

That flucks the reality test, big time!  A minimum of battle ships armor!?!
So the hull of all space ships is made of 10+ inches of carbon steel!?!?!

No, it\'s made of a quarter inch or so of bonded superdense.  Or something
like that.

Rather, it says that the minimum thickness of TL12+ alloys that you
can readily fabricate into starship hull gives you better protection
(once complete) than 10+ inches of carbon steel. I\'ll bet 10+ inches
of TL12+ alloys will make 10 inches of carbon steel look like wet

The other reason for this was that the P-39 was notoriously _different_
to fly. Not a bad design, but for pilots breifly trained in light
front-engined taildraggers, going to a heavier mid engine trike gear
plane with no further training is going to be tricky at best.

I\'ll bet the pile at the destination field was bigger ;-)

The TL21 Jump Projector actually has its own supply of Hydrogen. 
It creates the jump bubble "and extends it" around the target ship,

Trek Deflector Dish (God, would I like to have one them ... they do 
everything!) and then pinches off the bubble so only the target ship 
is within the bubble.  The little robot previously transported now 
maintains the bubble.  The projector then uses its before-mentioned 
matter transmission capability to transport the remaining load of 
Hydrogen into a pocket universe.  The little robot also has the 
capability to siphon off the hydrogen from the pocket universe to 
maintain the bubble.

Once the misjump is complete, the little robot does not self-
destruct.  He (sorry Ditzi) turns into a pen and goes to the Planet of 
Lost Pens.

There ... sure its magic.  But we all know about High Tech vs Low

That\'s defined by the description of the weapon.  The problem is that 
it still works on ships without fuel, as no exceptions are listed.

I just realized that the text indicates that the Jump Projector 
works on -ANY- ship, any target vessel, so the target vessel doesn\'t 
even have to have a jump drive at all.  My bad!  Scratch everything 
I\'ve suggested so far, except for maybe the Star Trek technobabble.  
(Seems my joke was closer to the "truth" than I thought.)

So, the TL-21 Jump Projector hits an in-system SDB without jump 
drives at all, and suddenly the vessel misjumps.  How does it happen?

My suggestion is that a Jump Field is induced by the Jump Projector 
around the target ship, INDEPENDENT of the ship\'s capacity to enter 
jumpspace or not.  With a TL-21 understanding of JumpSpace, it 
becomes possible that the Projector induces a field that is 
strong/stable enough to sustain itself throughout the entire misjump 
(if you are a Hydrogen leaking fan or not, this should work.)  Since 
no jump vector has been given, no course to follow, it\'s only natural 
that the target misjumps.

This implies another aspect of Jump Projectors that might be of 
interest to PCs exploring hereto unknown Ancient/Primordial/Elder 
Race bases or civilizations.  If the Jump Projector can be made to 
induce a Jump Field with a programmed Jump Vector, we have the 
capacity for Jump Gate technology.  (I know they probably already 
exist in canon, probably that FF&S book I\'ve heard so much about, but 
the realization is still cool.)  The vessels wouldn\'t have to have 
Jump Drives, then, as an established Jump Projector site at each 
system could send the vessel to the next location.

<Adventure Idea>

The PCs arrive in system to perform a routine survey.  Sensor Ops 
picks up some strange radio signals from an Ancient site located 
within the atmosphere of a nearby GG.  The vessel moves into position 
to survey the base.  Their scans trigger the "awakening" of a 
disabled Ancient AI assigned to monitor this out-of-the-way system.  
The AI scans the vessel, receives conflicting reports as to its 
identity, and beams a coded sequence to the vessel.  When the proper 
response is not sent by the surveyors, the Monitor initiates its 
defense protocol.

Suddenly, those on board register a surge of energy from the base 
below, and the vessel is thrown into Jump space.  A terrifying week 
later, the vessel emerges in deep space, six parsecs away.  Another 
Monitor nearby automatically performs a similar routine: beam a 
recognition signal, and uses a Jump Projector on the ship when the 
proper response is not given.  A mad series of these planned 
jumps finally drives the crew to submit themselves to the emergency 
low berths.

Some time passes, as the vessel is moved across Known Space, to be 
dumped into that new Sector the Referee wants the PCs to explore.  
The last Monitor station simply imposes a misjump on the PCs\' ship, 
effectively removing it from the territory of the Ancient it was 
supposed to defend during the Final War.  The ship tumbles through 
space, on minimal energy reserves, waiting for a reason to become 
active once again.  Some time passes...

On the bridge, a white light on a wall panel starts blinking quietly,
as it strives to tell a crew not present of a closing vessel.

Those beings that discovered the vessel dock with it, and enter the
derelict, only to find the PC crew locked away under Cold Sleep. 
After a quick discussion, the medic begins the process of "thawing
out" his new charges, and the PCs awaken to find themselves in a new
Sector, in potentially new time, and a long, long way from home.

</Adventure Idea>

Cool.  I\'ll have to give this one some thought.  :)

Certainly i\'m interested in others opinions (even yours, though sometimes I
wonder).  
If I wasn\'t, I\'d have plonked you a looong time ago, much less engaged you in
this discussion.  You\'ve dodged around the main point to duel over peripheral,
and minor, points of specifics.  As I said, ignore the specifics (possibly
uncanonical) mentioned in the SoM.  The general capabilities of EMS sensors
are well established.  There is NO problem between space and atmospheric
interaction.  If you don\'t agree w/ that, then your problem isn\'t with me, but
with Traveller.

You asked how much it *weighed*.  It *MASSES* 186.52 tonnes.  Displacement is
9 tons, compared to the 15dt in Supplement 5.  There are different versions of
the Rampart, you know.

Now, I take it the size of the sensor unit (3 m3, 6 tonnes, 6m2), at TL-15,
makes it that it isn\'t disagreeable to you?  The F15 doubtfully carries that
much, but the Rampart has at least 6 times the thrust, as well as CG.  We\'ve
been over this already, too.

Don\'t tell me about it!  I didn\'t design the sensor systems, nor their
capabilities.  There are sensors gurus on teh list far more qualified than you
and they\'ve never complained about them.  The point is that those are the
capabilities established by canon.  Do you understand?

That\'s why I do not use HG.  FF&S covers everythign quite nicely and it\'s part
of a ground up consistent system (TNE) built to utilize it\'s designs.

The whole point of any of that was so you could see a combat between a space
fighter and an atmosphere fighter.  You keep claiming the atmosphere fighter
will win, but until you design and astmophere fighter and airframed space
fighter, and are satisfied they are both "optimum" designs, and then put them
in a combat situation, your claims mean nothing.  When you run a combat,
you\'re likely to see the space fighter wins.  You keep arguing about it, but
don\'t do the thing to prove it.  Talk is cheap.  You use GURPS.  Use GURPS.
I\'m satisfied the results will be just as I\'ve said, despite your "common
sense."  Now maybe the game systems are all flawed and you\'re right.  It\'s
more than possible, I suppose.  That we\'re talking about rpg\'s makes your
point an exercise in absurdity.

You said you have FF&S.  Look for yourself.  I recognize most of those things
as being in there w/o looking.  I KNOW ramjets, ducted fans, stub wings,
hardpoints, pylons and masking is in there, but am unsure of the others w/o
looking.

No kidding.  It\'s just a game.  Are you rationalizing why you refuse to put up
or shut up?  Even in the game system of your choice (GURPS, presumably)?

So why are YOU here, then?  This is a forum for discussion about a game and
it\'s environment based on "flawed simulations designed by non-experts."
:::sarcasm:::  Do you actually play?  Would it be such a chore to have, in
your next game session, your game system evaluate whether you\'re correct or
not?   Or do you already know the answer?  That given the situations and
capabilites of crafts presented, the space fighter will win.  I know the game
answer.  The space fighter wins.  Repeatedly.

Has ANYONE\'s joined been debating *that* with you.  You came into an existing
discussion and changed the subject w/o telling anyone.  Unfortunately, it
seems noone joined you in your main point (if that\'s it), and stayed with the
original point.  You\'ve kept on as if you\'ve been joined.  Since grav vehicles
and aircraft merge at 
TL-13 (and effectively, space craft, as well), it\'s kinda ludicrous, though as
someone else mentioned there is a TL-15 craft in COACC (though I\'d just as
soon buy some Trepidas and Ramparts instead of those things).  I can certainly
use them both in different roles, saving me hard earned MCr.

So do you have an air fighter and a space fighter?  If so, Great!  Before your
next game run a combat and tell us the results (posting the designs would be
nice, too).
If not, you lack the two needed to continue this discussion.

<snip>

> See the point?

Yeah.  It\'s completely screwey, but yeah.  All of the things you\'ve said,
you\'ve said before and not convinced anyone (well possibly someone).  It\'s
proven, in game context, by designing the two, comparing, and running a
combat.  Your conclusion is in error, as far as most games are concerned (i\'ll
bet even in GURPS), given the tech levels involved.  That you refuse to back
up and test your claims is very interesting and possibly very relevant to your
point.

I am not sure if wings are an issue, as one of the MOST agile objects out
there are the things that are used to shoot down those pesky fighters...
missiles!  Having worked on various missile systems lets just say that at
any speed a Sidewinder will out turn any F-16, or any aircraft...  back a
few years ago the AIM 9M could do over 45G\'s in a turn.  The Rampart looks
like some missiles to me, and would work just fine at Mach 25+, or at
500kns, to provide a turning surface.  It may be the best design for the
job.  Both space and air.   Remember, the entire wing could pivot much like
the tail surface on most modern fighters, providing extreme maneuverability.

The C-N-O cycle is just a catalyst for the 4H -> He4 reaction.

          N15 + H -> C12 + He4

It requires much higher temperatures and pressures but runs faster,
boosting the energy output of stars larger than the sun.

You remember somewhat incorrectly.  It takes 33cm of hard steel to get
armor factor 40.  This is accomplished with equivalent hardness of bonded
superdense which works out to 0.14 of the mass of equivalent steel armor.

In other words, using Bonded Superdense to get the same armor value as 33cm
of hard steel requires about 1/7th the *mass* of equivalent Bonded
Superdense.  The ratio of the mass of armor to the volume of armor material
is a matter for a different discussion, and let\'s assume for this purpose
that they are about proportional.

I believe you mean to say "Flunks".

The U.S.S. Iowa has belt armor about 12" thick made of hard steel, that\'s
about 29 cm.  If the table for armor factor does, in fact, represent
thickness in cm (this is implied, but not stated), then 29cm of hard steel
works out to armor factor 38-39 (the table is such that a much greater
amount of material is required as desired armor level goes up, but its a
bit cheaper than 1-1 until around armor factor 27).  This is pretty close,
but a bit less, than a free trader.  Remember that the Iowa is only armored
in certain places while the Free  Trader is armored equally everywhere, so
the comparison is not really fair.  In truth, the Free Trader is armored
much better on average.  The tower and turrets of the Iowa, for example,
can have as much as 17.3 inches=42cm which is armor factor 42-43, while the
deck surface is about 6 inches=14.5cm which is Armor Factor 30.  Many areas
are not "armored" at all, but probaly have about an inch of steel anyway,
and are therefore armor factor 10 or so.

I do not find the superiority of the Free Trader terribly outside the realm
of (Traveller) reality for several reasons;

1). The energy of a small piece of debris travelling very fast in an
opposite direction can easily be greater than a WWII large caliber shell
fired in a typical battleship conflict, which is what the Iowa was designed
to resist.  Ships which commonly travel in space, where space is a busy
place, need an armored surface which will resist 99.99% of debris strikes.

2). The "cost" in terms of weight and volume (the latter is not measured by
MT) to apply this level of armor is not out of scale with the vessel\'s
budget, in general. In comparison, the cost of armoring WWI and WWII
battleships became unbearable in terms of the effect additional weight had
on the speed of the craft.  Moving to the Belt/Turret/Conning Tower only
armor instead of all around protection was a sign of (and partially a
solution to) this problem.

3). Compare the armor "value" of a TL2 warship with the armor of the TL5
merchant and you will find a tremendous difference in the possible
capability and comparitive level of "acceptable" armor.  I would guess that
a Greek Trireme, with its 6" of oak (I\'m guessing here) was not nearly as
well armored as a typical merchant of the 1930s with all of two inches of
hard steel.  In addition, we arent talking about a 3 Tech Level gap, but a
9 TL gap (Iowa, as built, is TL5, Far Traders are around TL14)!

No, I would not especially want to be aboard Iowa when she goes up against
the March Harrier.  Nor do I wish to be onboard an F-22 against a rampart.
For that matter, I don\'t want to be onboard an Iowa against a rampart, the
Tech Level delta is just way too big!

Hmmm, Charles, have you seen the effective damage of lasers vis a vis

Trust me, a laser doesnt scratch a heavy grav tank, once you take the 50 MJ

Missiles, sure. These wouldnt happen to have nuclear warheads would they ?

Well, when conducting the interface you arrange for a big meteor shower.
Nothing that will cause damage too much to the environment, but enough to
produce lots and lots of interference.

Given visual engagement range, you will need a lot of defensive craft to
cover the entire planet.

Air breathing missiles will be slow enough to pick off with lasers. Det
warheads have issues under the Imperial Rules of War, and in any case are
vulnerable to nuke dampers.

Sounds good Dom, though of course I have my own theory for MTU (and make no
claims on canonicity).  The only thing I\'d quibble w/ yours on is that I
thought the field was teh shape of the ship, just extending out a meter or so,
not a sphere?
You make me want to give my own watery musings on it.  :-)

My theory goes thus.  Fuel is used according to FF&S explanation of being a
combo of "fuel, coolant, and displacement mass," all of which is lhyd.  The
fuel and coolant are effectively put in the drive together (which is primarily
a fusion plant and a lanthanum coil).   The displacement mass is used not in
jumpspace but in the space left behind by the ship from the jump point and
precedes the ship in precipitation "clearing" that space.  

There is a j-field (hugging the shape of the ship about a meter or so out)
that is  established and maintained by the coil, using power from the reactor
(using the lhyd as fuel and coolant) via the HPG bank.  Fluctuations, caused
by impurities, or flaws in equipment or in the astrogation or energy transfer
from reactor to coil (task rolls by astrogator and engineer, respectively),
can cause madness, injury, and/or death to personnel, damaging and causing
malfunction in equipment.  There is a grid, of sorts, also usually lanthanum,
but it\'s more of a wiring thing (that gives the same appearance as the front
of the SoM, jump flash et al) that is a redundant system to the coil
(facilitates the easy maintenance and modulation of the J-field.  Not
necessary, but correcting a bad field is two diff mods more difficult w/o).

There is a jump governor (along w/ a connection to the main comp for
redundancy), too, but it\'s purpose is to precisely carry out instructions to
the various componets given by the calculated jump trajectory.  The other
componet is the HPG bank, which stores the energy generated by the reactor.
The energy is "purified" (regulated) to consistent properties and stored to be
transfered to the coil.

I\'ve been thinking of having the HPG only be used for the initial surge (a
large store of energy from teh reactor being required) and having only a
residual energy of some kind be needed.  This would enable all fuel to be
guzzled in the beginning, too, though I\'ve always held a distaste for that,
but would seem to bring me closer to canon.

Alternately, it can be made possible for lhyd to not be needed anymore (the
fuel supplanted by antimatter or solar arrays (after a loong time), coolant
replaced by usage of the ship\'s power radiators (which IMTU is effectively
part of the manuever drive, thus consuming no exclusive surface area), which
isn\'t as efficient as the lhyd and must be carefully measured not to exceed
radiator capacity (don\'t want to roast everyone inside).  The displacement
mass part is the tricky part, but by directly transfering alot of power (easy
w/ antimatter, requiring the shutdown of other systems) directly to the coil
and in concert w/ CG, can be done by gravitics.

The specifics I\'ll need to work on, but I envision a practical need by the
Vilani to do jump dimming (transferring all weapons, defensive, and even some
of the life support power) to the coil, as IMTU the Ziru Sirka jump drives
(particularly the J2 ones) didn\'t use displacement mass but did it the "hard
way."  The Terran theories did, and the ROM and 3I followed the Terran path to
where jump dimming was was just a cultural thing by the Vilani.  

Hmm... this is making my gearhead insticts flare...  maybe FF&S3 will enable
us to custom build J-drives.  I think my next traveller project might be to
dissect FF&S jump drives to where I can add and subtract all these things.

Strange Roswell Material Confirmed

The Hume and Bacon Institute for Alternative Science,
located outside of Edinburgh, Scotland has just published
some of its recent findings in the British science
journal Languet (Vol. 233, 1999). As the details of the
article become known, they will prove quite startling to
many. 

In a news conference, Paul A. Yiannis, the institute\'s
director, stated that his staff had convincingly
verified a number of controversial claims. 

The first involves a strange piece of metal found in
Roswell, N.M., where many believe an alien spacecraft
crashed in 1947. The fragment has quite an amazing 
property: It exerts a faint physical attraction on
every information-processing instrument so far tested.
Moreover, this attraction is nine times as strong one
foot away from the metal as it is one yard away. 

What to make of the fragment\'s effect is open to 
differing interpretations, but it can no longer be denied.
Yiannis maintains that the relation of this phenomenon to
the new physics of string theory will be an active area of
research in the 21st century.

You missed the part about the grid.  The Natural shape of a jump field is a
spheroid around the coil.  Larger coil = bigger spheroid.  This becomes cost
ineffective for ships that are really long because you\'d need a coil large enough
to encompass the longest part of the ship.  To cut down on expensive coil size,
you introduce jump grids which squish the spheroid shape into a tighter skin at an
arbitrary distance from the hull (1-2 meters).  Thus the unification of coils and
grids.  You always need the coil, but grids make best use of the field.

I\'m not saying its a good thing...  I\'m just saying that if want
to invoke "canon" thats the way it is.  If you want to change it
(and I, in fact would, to "drop" drop tanks) then you should a
admit that it is a change.

The point is not that is this (or other situations deleted) "prove"
the point.  The issues is that there are a number of exmaples
(your antimatter one being yet another), all of which treat
the issue at hand one way.

Well, I don\'t agree.  Aside from the contrived feel you get
if you carefully arrange them to be dangerous (or whatever)
at exactly a certain level, and never have this change as they
get become more common (if they were sort of working , a lot of
people would be very interested in working ou the bugs), they
still should become derigure for miltary vessels, fast couriers,
etc.  To the point that much of the plot should involve the
shifts in power balance and responses vis a vis the Zhodani
(and others).

If you say, "Oh, they just happen to be to dangerous for
anyone but PC and there is nothing that even the hordes of
IMperial scientists can do about it" my answer is both
"yuk" and that it really doesn\'t fully solve the problem
they present.

>Drop tanks have always been an asterisk in Traveller ship design.

Because they have never been explored.  They were introduced and
their implicatons were totally (and unrealistically, ignored).

I don\'t agree.  If they exist as presented, shipping throughout
the Imperium should be systematically switching to them.  That
this doesn\'t happen, for no apparent reason, is odd and makes
the background less believable.

> I\'ve always seen them as a marginal technology in a marginal ship
>design

But they aren\'t.  The jump fuel volume requirements are so
large that they are quited a fundamental change to how shipping
works.

>reading more into it than you intend.  Do you have any PCs running around in

The problem
is that they should be the revolutionary change of the decade in
the Imperium.  You should see the shipping changing from a "you
go and your jump where you want" to a "almost everyone jumps at
the jump station" (like in B5).  The changes should
be rippling through the Imperium, making some companies rich,
driving others out of business, changing the balance of power
(much as jump -3 is suppose to have done for the Solomani),
causes shipping prices to change radically (rendering the
economic rules in CT, MT and Far Trader obsolete), whether
the government is setting up fuel stations or corps are
doing it, if corps are doing it are the cooperating or
(perhaps) sabatoging their rivals, etc.
It also has problem with PCs in at, if they don\'t have
a ship designed for drop tanks, they should have to be
dealing with competition from drop tanked ships.

It\'s like some discovered a way to do jump-12 and nobody cared...

>  Their operation is
>something intended as innovative, but hardly with a clear advantage to it\'s
>usage, especially if there seems to be some danger to the ship their used on
>(as the TNS entry indicates).

Well, my take was that is was sabatage.  There had been
the explosions at the shipyard and their hadn\'t been troubles
in the interior.  Even if you don\'t agree, the article doesn\'t
invoke a fundamental limitation, but instead simple quality
control neglegence on the part of General shipyards.  The
fact that this problem hadn\'t come up in the previous 12 years
indicates that it isn\'t a fundamental problem.  Not are there
any rules (from memory) that say they are dangerous.

In fact, the TNS entries state that they _are_ being used for
commerical purposes in the core ("for the last dozen years") and
the author himself felt they should have a radical change
in shipping ("the dawn of a new era of commerce").

Gee, maybe they have a far trader and have to worry about competing
with them?  It invalidates the assumptions made, for example, in
the excelent book on economics, Fat Trader.  Or if you are running
an military ops campaign, the presence of drop tanks should make
a big difference.

Even if it didn\'t affect them directly, it changes
the background a lot (do pirates have to attack stations, some
have argued this would indeed be the death of piracy).  It will
change the balance of power with the Zhondani.  Maybe
you don\'t think the background matters if doesn\'t change
how the PC jump to the next system.  I do.

Hog wash.  The point was that they were coming into common usage
in the Spinward Marches _now_.  Also, the idea that it would
take 100 years for people in the Spinward Marches (who can get
blueprints in a year) is just absurd.

I guess we see it differently, most of these arguements seem
weak and unbelievalbe to me.  To me they are the sort of
shallow rationalizations that cause me to avoid AD&D.,

They are "advanced".  The phrase "new" here meant "new addition
to canon".

I haven\'t presented a model in this thread.

>  Have they *ever*

No, because they are TL 22(?).  If they were a technology that
the Imperium could build now, they would have the exact same
issues.

Black globes are indeed ancient techology that the Imperium doesn\'t
understand (and is only able to copy, they don\'t even know if
they are using them for the intended purpose).  This isn\'t true
of drop tanks.

>  It\'s ignoring it in a really sad way

They are a technology that one would expect not have as big effect.
They are something that takes a bigger ships to use effectively and
they are hard to make, unlike drop tanks which are suppose to
have been in use for years.  Also, changing the difficulties
of FTL travel (which is one of the fundamental principals that
Traveller was founded on) is a lot more fundamental than adding
a new military toy.

Black globes have been reasonable explored, unlike drop tanks...

Centuries is absurd.  Sure it will take decades.  Decades in
which they are driving force for change (as I mention above),
unless you want to divert the timeline to deal with those
decades of change you have issues....

Because Free Trader seeks to allow the PC to conduct their
trading in way that fits in realistically with how the universe
around them is suppose to work.  They didn\'t just come up with a few
arbitrary rules and say that, if it isn\'t unbalanced as a
game mechanic, it is "fine".  Instead it takes the way the
Imperium is portrayed and works out the economics from the ground
up.  Allowing on to do thing like look at a world and figure
out how busy the port will be when the PC\'s get there.  This
give us a detailed, believable, and interesting system that
allows many events and situations for the PC to flow naturally
and believably from the stitation.

Saying that things will arbitrarily work a certain way and
not caring if it makes sense reagarding how the setting is
suppose to work may work for you, but it doesn\'t for a lot
of us.  If how the world around the PC works doesn\'t affect
them, why even bother with a setting?  Just set up the worlds
they visit and ignore rest?

Centuries is absurd.  Sure it will take decades.  Decades in

which they are driving force for change (as I mention above),

unless you want to divert the timeline to deal with those

decades of change you have issues....

Because Free Trader seeks to allow the PC to conduct their

trading in way that fits in realistically with how the universe 

around them is suppose to work.  They didn\'t just come up with a few 

arbitrary rules and say that, if it isn\'t unbalanced as a

game mechanic, it is "fine".  Instead it takes the way the

Imperium is portrayed and works out the economics from the ground

up.  Allowing on to do thing like look at a world and figure

out how busy the port will be when the PC\'s get there.  This

give us a detailed, believable, and interesting system that

allows many events and situations for the PC to flow naturally

and believably from the stitation.


Saying that things will arbitrarily work a certain way and 

not caring if it makes sense reagarding how the setting is

suppose to work may work for you, but it doesn\'t for a lot

of us.  If how the world around the PC works doesn\'t affect

them, why even bother with a setting?  Just set up the worlds

they visit and ignore rest?

Okay, I\'m confused. I essentially stated that a hull with an armor value of
40 is the equivalent of 33 cm of hard steel.

What I meant by this was that a hull of bonded superdense with an armor
value of 40 gives the same protection as a hull of hard steel 33 cm thick.
I made no mention of how much superdense it takes to give this protection
(did I?).

Is this not the case? Or was I just unclear in my statement?

I thought it meant that a hull made of bonded superdense with _n_
protection massed 14% (1/7th) what a hard steel hull with _n_ protection
did. Or is this what you just said? :-)

BTW, where can I find this "different discussion?" Can I start one? :-)

Does the 0.14 modifier mean that a hull of superdense masses the same as
hard steel hull but is 14% the thickness? Or does superdense mass *more*
than hard steel per cc (being superdense, it would seem this is the case),
making hulls  even thinner?

Just how thick is a 40G hull, anyhoo?

I\'ll hazzard a guess, the property described above
is...(drum-roll)...gravity.

I had a joke for Lirpa Sloof, but I decided against it...as I didn\'t want to
create bad feelings on the list (as practical jokes often do).  This one was
rather innocuous, but funny...

Because of the word Roswell being uttered on April first?

Actually, I\'d guess it has something to do with magnetism and all
information processing equipment is electronic and produces some sort of
field effects.

Does this mean that a guass rifle, conducting rapid fire, has the ability to
hit 4 targets 3 times?

Is their any reason why the autofire targets can\'t be the same target? For
example, if their is only one target, why can\'t you "unload" your weapon on
that one target and get 12 chances to hit? or spread it out between 2
targets with 6 possible hits each?

One of my players wants to duct tape two guass rifles together and attach
the triggers with a metal rod. He wants to have both guns fire at the same
time. Is this possible? I figure the difficulty should automatically go up

Sorry, my mistake. I meant the time taken to climb from base to an altitude
suitable to engage the enemy ships. I realise with something like an F15 or
a BAe / EE Lightning this is a minimal period, but you are vulnerable as
you climb *if you can be seen*. (I realise this is a key point in a
different part of this discussion).

Is VTOL compatible with that kind of thrust? Anyway, if you use CG it

I think this is where the problem will come in. Unless you use batteries,
you\'ll need a power plant capable of charging the \'laser\'. I suspect this
is what will push the cost of mass of the airframe up. It\'s what would make
non-CG ships more viable. You could end up with the equivalent of an A340
to carry the power. Admittedly, the abomination known as Fusion Plus  makes
this easier.

Nope. It is 7 (superdense) or 14 (bonded superdense) times thinner ie 33 cm
is either 4.7cm or 2.35cm of material in Traveller. It is an equivalence...

It may need to be this think to give a degree of protection against
radiation from solar flares.

It also ties in with the possibility of hull damage causing a misjump, as
your jump field can fluctuate or not be maintained (even impinge the ship)
if the grid is damaged.

BTW Jump governors are canon (sort of) - they are described in HG1.

I have CT/MT/TNE and T4.

I use the CT adventures/background and HG, MT adventures/background and T4
rules (excluding starships). TNE I mine for ideas.

I also have GT (just got Far Trader which Leisure Games got in the UK on
30/3 and delivered to me 31/3) material which is looking really good. I
suppose that makes me sad...

I agree. Realising just how small the RL ship you mention was in Traveller
terms was scary.

Fair point, and the format will be critical. If you think about it, the
formating of data is changing - look at hypertext for example, something
which ten years ago would be really wild and novel.

It isn\'t really discussed at all in CT - MT started the discussion on how
the technology worked IIRC. CT just left the reader to assume the ship was
operated like an aircraft.

Sorry - the point I was trying to make was that CT evolved to include a

It is probably as close as we\'ll get (or want to get ;-) ). References for
some of the features are above.

But if the aerospace capable fighter can draw the air fighter to the upper
reaches of the atmosphere, (for example), the air fighter is ppush its
parameters. If an aerospace fighter enters the atmosphere, it is still
within its parameters, even if it has limitations that an air fighter
doesn\'t.

I think it would be especially advantageous to the attacker. I agree with
the need to model a number of scenarios.

I introduced the orbital bombardment bit - there is nothing to stop the

Except maybe your brain can\'t handle looking at the field? Of cause, it

Can\'t remember if the psychological problems are canon..

HG yes. Striker/HG fused together don\'t really give a problem, neither does

SOpM is really useful, especially when you have players with enquiring
minds. I use it like FFS - it gives me an understanding of the technology
used in the game.

To be honest, I would just say - your budget is X MCr at TL Y. Maybe limit
the air fighter to being non-space capable.

I agree again; my comprehension of the Traveller rules (certainly post
Striker 1) is that the difference between space and aircraft disappears
around TL12/13 (Trav Tech). This is the main difference in our perspectives
now.

Why not just build spherical starships?  It\'s the most efficient shape for
space, anyway (least surface area to armor, per unit volume, very strong
structurally, streamlined..)  and negates the need to pay for a lanthanum
grid.  Just use a coil...

I just pulled this on my players.  They found an _old_ asteroid base in an
out of the way system, and discovered inside what appeared to be the mother
of all deep sites.  The accelerator tube was close to 10km in length.
Anyway, through some contacts they got the Imperium involved, got a finders
fee, and then, just to see if it still worked, the lead scientist used it
on the players.  Bwahahaha...

When they emerged from J-space a shortly thereafter, not only were they not
in Kansas anymore but they were so far out of charted space that all they
had were some old references to star names about about two sectors distant.

They have learned a new mantra, "We all have to learn to deal with
dissapointment..."

You shouldn\'t _need_ a damper box for tactical use of collapsing
rounds.  Some of the Californium isotopes have fairly long half-lives:

248 Cf -> 334 days
249 Cf -> 351 years
250 Cf -> 13.1 years
251 Cf -> ~900 years
252 Cf -> 2.64 years

I\'m guessing that Cf-252 would be a good collapsing-round candidate.  It
decays by spontanious fission, though its neutron cross-section is quite
small.

A shell with a half-life of a few years is not going to decay
appreciably on a one or two day patrol.  It will get hot and possibly
melt, but a a box full of dry-ice should cure that.  A thin layer of
lead or depleted uranium on the box would make it vaguely safe to
handle.

Yes, according to David Pulver, who wrote the system.  For why this is so,
look at High Guard.  The only true unstreamlined configurations are
dispersed structures (aka open frames) and planetoids.  Neither are handled
in the basic GT ship construction system.  So USL covers all the configs
that were partially streamlined in HG.  Poor choice of terminology,
certainly, but it does simplify things.  It\'s so much easier to design that
50K-ton armored cruiser when you can make it USL and still allow it to
frontier refuel without fuel skimmers.

I don\'t want to change anything, but to accomidate all canon.  Despite what 
G:T already\'s ditched, I\'m still there.  Black Globes have a far worse 
implication than drop tanks and have their own problems, too.  I don\'t want

The antimatter one bursts far more than just mine (and it doesn\'t FTR).  
Nearly every one out there, actually.  What\'s your J-theory again? ;-)

The only credible issue you have is the economics changing the setting and 
that simply doesn\'t apply to the 1100s.  1130, possibly if there wasn\'t a 14 
year long civil war that breaks out.  Fortunately, the Rebellion, Hard Times 
and Collapse keep it from happening, though the Regency might show it.  ;-)

Even if you\'re right (and you\'re not IMO), how is that bad?  Things should 
grow and develop and change like that.  That\'s what technology does.  This 
should well be going on in the background behind the adventures and 
historical events.  The economics have never been fleshed out enough for this 
to be considered anyways.  The only thing hinting this isn\'t exactly the case 
is the profusion of designs lacking drop tanks and why?  Because they\'re from 
before the introduction (or wide acceptance of them).  We\'ve hardly had a 
definitive look at every ship in the 3I, at any date.

It\'s good that\'s not what I say, then.  :-)  If there are some notable 
accidents with them, there will be that much more a delay in widespread 
confidence (and thus use) of them.  Insurance companies refusing to insure 
drop tanked ships, etc.  The inertia of the Imperial Bureacracy licencing and 
authorizing such designs, as well as the Vilani roots (and bureaucracies) of 
the many megacorp boards and executives.  Ignoring the interests that have 
whatever stake in preventing their widespread use.

Their implications are not what you make them out to be, though the economic

Obviously you don\'t agree.  It\'s not going to be "hey, lets\' all switch to 
drop tank ships, first have r&d design us some ships.  nevermind the 27 point 
stock drop upon our announcement.  Then let\'s convert our entire fleet over, 
despite the fact they may be dangerous and lose us more money than we gain."  
That\'s ludicrous.  You have to be setting up a straw man.  

The sabotage you refer to was supposedly by commercial interests w/ some 
stake in preventing the proliferation of drop tanks, wasn\'t it?  Would any of 
your characters happen to be involved?  You\'re secretly supporting that 
faction, aren\'t u?  lol.  Just what is your stake in this?  ;-)  Anyways, 
even lacking the Rebellion and Collapse, the basic setting of G:T (1120) 
should be safe, giving it a few decades for the changeover by the large bulk 
haulers (almost exclusively megacorp).

I\'ll give you decades, but not 1.  10 years maybe if there wasn\'t opposition, 
but there appears to be significant opposition to the implementation and 
usage of drop-tanks to the Imperial periphery that could well delay it to 
even beyond 50 (by publically discrediting drop tanks to the bureaucracy, 
public, or nobility, regardless of the actual performance).

Well the CT and MT (and TNE uses MT verbatim) economics are laughably silly.  
I haven\'t seen Far Trader yet, but a "Drop Tank addendum" or "Far Trader vol 
2" shouldn\'t require herculean efforts.  The sky isn\'t going to fall in if 
G:T adopts drop tanks, David.

Your take.  You\'re not a megacorp board member or stock holder who stands to 
lose a whole lot (MCr, his job, possibly his entire life).  You\'re not 
Vilani, either, you Terran you.  That\'s how it was presented to us, but not 
necessarily how it actually had to be.  A suspicious megacorp exec w/ one 
hand on his neck could see it differently, but much less a bean counter at 
the bottom.

Well in reality, because that was in the first batch of TNS entries in JTAS

Reread the TNS entry.  That was from the press release by Tukera and General. 
 It\'s propaganda.  I\'m sure they want to make themselves look revolutionary 
and ushering in the "dawn of a new era of commerce."  It makes good 
advertising copy.  I know you\'re not that gullible.  Are you?

That is a strawman, pure and simple.  Not in the lifespan of your campaign 
(presuming you don\'t run generational decade long campaigns, which I suppose 
is possible).  Who do your far traders compete against anyways?  They can\'t 
handle the megacorps, as is, be it due to bulk freighters, drop tanks, or 
drop-tanked bulk freighters.  :-)

Only if the IN funds the ship designs.  As Real Life shows, it\'s far too 
often actual effectiveness takes a back seat to political and economic 
considerations.

More strawmen? You\'re not trying hard enough.  Pirates aren\'t an invading 
force who are going to use planet busters.  Hmm... which side of the Piracy 
Debate are you on, again?  First reference that discussion.  ;-)  They want 
to get Cr and raw materials and finished goods, etc don\'t they?  It\'s easy to 
defend a fixed installation against pirates.  U know where to put your SDB\'s 
and patrol cruisers, for one.  And since when is the Imperium so concerned 
about the balance of power w/ the Zhos?  And it won\'t change how the PC\'s 
jump to the next system.  Calculate hte costs of buying new drop tanks after 
every jump.  One bad run (for whatever reason: confiscated smuggled goods, 
buyer cancels, etc) and any far trader might not be able to buy new drop 
tanks, which could really lead to a bad end to his business ventures.  The 
megacorps don\'t have that problem, but the independants and small timers do.

lol.  A hundred years is more than possible considering the Rebellion and 
Collapse, if even then.  Actually, considering them, it\'s gonna be 200.  :-)  
It\'s as quick as you, the Ref, want it to be (in your case push it back to 
like 50 years).  For the official setting, it\'s not going to be in 10 years.  
Nor in 20.  How quick can the funding be gathered?  How many spare drop 
tanks?  A megacorp might handle it in 10.  If they have the will to.  If the 
CEO and board members aren\'t convinced of the profitability (and a faulty 
design can lose them a MCr ship, it\'s crew, compensation to families of the 
crew, lawsuits by the families and the buying concerns, etc etc, as well the 
ordinary revenue that was going to be gathered by the ship).  Being more than 
partially Vilani, what would you do?  honestly.

I was talking about jump projectors, not black globes.  Why did you bring up 
jump projectors anyways? There\'s very little canon on them (just the MT

You lost me there.  What are you talking about?  Black Globes?  "Changing the 
difficulties of FTL travel" *IS* Traveller.  It was there from the very 
beginning (If JTAS 2 doesn\'t qualify, what does?) and seems pretty 
fundamental.

Progress at last.  At least you admit it will take decades.  That\'s plural.  
How many?  2?  3? 5? (3 up and you\'re safe in your G:T campaign).  Noone 
forces you to deal with any issues.  Does anyone here think life will be like 
it\'s portrayed in Traveller?  It\'s 20th century people in space.

That\'s fine, David.  I have no problem w/ any of that.  You still didn\'t 
answer my point though.  Noone is invoking arbitrary economic rules.  Another 
strawman.  A new technology or implementation of technology *should* change 
the economics of the Imperium.  I\'m not familiar w/ Far Trader, as I don\'t 
yet have it (though I now firmly intend to get it), so i am unaware of the 
impact drop tanks would have.  Assuming it completely thrashes it,  Far 
Trader is of use for the pre-drop tank proliferated Imperium.  Would the 
authors be willing to make a companion volume dealing w/ the "after?"  There 
are those who don\'t like randomly discarding the bits of canon that don\'t 
offend them (for whatever reason).  I\'d like to hear from the authors that 
it\'s completely thrashed by drop tanks, first, though, until I get it and can 
read it myself.

Hm..no, I think the most important aspect is the neutron capture cross-section,
whether those captures produce fissions or simply a higher number element, and
how many neutrons are produced per fission.  You can always add a neutron
source.  I think I went through the list a while back and decided that there
were no californium isotopes which were suitable for nuclear weapons (I think
there were some americium isotopes which were), but this was _many_ years ago,
so take it with a grain or two of salt.

I would expect that any problems caused by viewing the jump field would
be based on the premise that the jump field exposes the senses to
non-Euclidean geometries.  Or, from the C\'thulhu for President \'92
campaign song (sung to the tune of "Chattanooga Choo-Choo"):

You\'ll see an ancient sunken city where the angles are wrong
You\'ll see the fourth dimension if you stay very long....

I can understand how that could be...disorienting (even without the
Lovecraftian horrors dwelling therein).


> Can\'t remember if the psychological problems are canon..

I don\'t know.  However, I did add a quirk to my T4 main character: 
viewing jumpspace nauseates him, due to vertigo.  As Colonel Erik von
Oldenburg is an Imperial Baron, who commands an Imperial Army Jump Troop
regiment, his tendency to seek a bit of privacy during the transition to
jump actually seems a bit odd to his peers.

Well, because they\'re spherical... Spherical ships have their own problems.  For
starters, spinal weapons prefer needle shapes.  Additionally, the expensive part
is the coil which generates a specific volume.  The grid is relatively cheap
compared to the coil.

	I saw your TML post about insurance.  I\'m not posting there 
because for some reason I can\'t get my jmaclean account subscribed to the 
TML.
	Anyway, the short answer with insurance rates is that the cost of 
insurace equals the expected value of the loss plus a small risk premium 
which is the banks compensation for accepting the risk.  Given the 
Imperium\'s low interest rates this won\'t be huge.  The big unknown is how 
likely ships are to be damaged or lost in GT.  I\'ll leave this up to you.
Whatever you decide on, I suggest that you use the interest rate figures 
for different risk levels in the stocks section as the risk premium.  
Then add on whatever the probability of loss per annum is and this gives 
the total percentage of ship price that must be paid per year in 
premiums.  Premiums will go down over time as the value of the ship declines.

	You mention the bank\'s insurance.  Readers should be reminded 
that the fact that the bank has made provisions for some portion of the 
ships it holds mortgages on being lost in no way affects the characters\' 
responsibility for paying the mortgage if their ship is in fact lost.  Even 
if the ship is an expanding cloud of plasma, they still owe the money.  
Of course, since the Imperium likely has bankruptcy laws they will get 
some relief....

I\'ve been semi-lurking here for a while.  Like many people, I was an early
Traveller player (my second RPG) and I played up to MT, but I got away from
it for a while in favor of GURPS.  It took GT to bring me back to the fold.

Anyway, I\'ve started playing with large ships using the GT ship design
system (with a few emendations from G:Ve.)  I just recently acquired CT
Book 9 and I\'m trying to convert the Ghalahk-class armored cruiser to GT. 
(I think it\'s the one really good looking ship in Fighting ships, and it
shows up in GT art as well.)  

In the course of this effort, two questions have come up.

1) Has anyone has figured out reasonable GT equivalents to the standardized
High Guard spinal mounts?  What would be a fair rating for the spinal
mounts presented in GT?

2) Are there any straightforward ways to convert the armor ratings from HG
into GT damage resistance?  Likewise meson screens and nuke dampers.

Thanks in advance for any help.  

PS: I\'ll try to post a draft of the cruiser this weekend; I just need to
pick up Star Mercs for the fusion guns.

There\'s a lot of parameter space to play around with with pulse duration - 
a 100 Mj laser with a 1 second pulse, for example, is probably OK. The
1 second pulse would hurt armour penetration, but not damage, I think.

On the other hand - it\'s not at all bad if lasers lose some penetration
in atmospheres; it\'s another reason for people to put plasma/fusion weapons
on tanks instead of big honking lasers. No great loss to Canon. Starship lasers
will still be threatening, but not dominate the battlefield or dominate
ortillery (also good.)

I don\'t know if they are either. I know jump *sickness* is, but that has to
do with actual physical contact with jumpspace.

Well, the problem with this is that the senses will only by exposed to
reflected or emitted visible light from the 3-dimensional manifestations of
these weird geometries. There is no reason to believe that non-Euclidean
geometry would cause an otherwise normal person difficulties to a degree
that could be classified as a psychological disorder. In fact, there is no
reason to believe that a person would be able to see into the 4th dimension,
simply because our eyes are not built to see into it any more than they are
capable of seeing gamma rays, x-rays, or radio waves. Just because we can
conceive of something doesn\'t mean we can actually sense it.

Of course, all this depends on how you define psychological problems when
saying that looking at jumpspace causes them. :-)

Vertigo I can believe. But when I read "Staring at the jump interface can
cause psychological problems with humans. ..." I think of schizophrenia,
personality disorders, or mood disorders, and so on and I just don\'t see how
it could happen. To me it\'s like saying "Staring at the jump interface can
give you the a nasty flu." There simply isn\'t a mechanism there to cause it.

David, what evidence do you have that this isn\'t happening? That it
hasn\'t been mentioned anywhere? How many adventures can you think of
where it is odd that drop tank equipped ships isn\'t mentioned? Most
adventures only mention that which is immidiately relevant. Far Trader
deals with free traders, which means _marginal_ trading.

My take on it is that if I was running a Napoleonic Era campaign, I wouldn\'t
leave it to random chance whether Napoleon, or even just Marshall Ney, showed
up as a ship\'s carpenter. Mind you, I\'m not saying that someone like Marshall
Ney couldn\'t appear as a common sodbuster, but it wouldn\'t be by random die
roll. And if it was by random die roll, it wouldn\'t happen with 3% of my NPCs.
Yet Imperial barons should (IMO) be about as common as emperors are on
Earth today. Consider: The most powerful head of state on Earth has at most
controlled a continent-sized country. We have never had a true world ruler.
Yet an Imperial Marquis is supposed to be about as common as world rulers.

Usually I do only introduce even planetary nobles when the plot calls for
it, but to introduce a bit of random chance, whenever I roll a 12 for social
status, I roll again with a 50/50 chance of turning that into a 13; if that
happens I roll again with the same chance of turning that into a 14; I keep
that up until I fail to get the increase or until I decide that enough is
enough.

That\'s exactly how I imagine that it would work. Only thing is, only ONE of
the many kings of that planet would become an Imperial marquis and only a
few of the other kings would rate Imperial baronies. The rest would have to
settle for Imperial knighthoods.

THe point is that to an Imperial noble, a planetary king is just another
petty noble. It\'s not what title you have, it\'s what power you have. The
head of state of Alell has the not very glamorous title "Captain". Yet
he would be the same social status as the king of another planet.

Ahh !
Now this is the _best_ part of your theory, as it neatly supports _both_
versions of hydrogen usage.

Jump without any hydrogen is thus possible, either by using some _other_
substance as the bubble, or by not having one at all and relying on capability
of your  grid-based field maintennce.

Great.

Even better.

And of course the higher TL the governor the more control, allowing extremely
accurate intra-system micro-jumps if you have a high TL governor.

I\'d also say that the 100D limit can be ignored. But, it takes far more energy
than normal to generate the field inside that limit, and you\'re relying on
your equipment and nav skill to prevent a misjump.

Conversely, one could say that the further out from the gravity well you go
the less energy is required, but that just beyoned the 100D limit is a point
at which the gains from jump energy requirements are usually outweighed by the
losses from maneuver energy, so no-one usually bothers.

Coming out of  jump closer in would require the expenditure of even more
energy  to counteract the effect of the gravity well pushing you out
(entering, you get pushed away from the planet as well as "out" of J-space,
meaning that the only way to emerge closer to a planet would be to pump energy
into the griid just prior to enmergence, which as sensors that work from
j-space to real-space don\'t exist, is an _extremely_ risky business, and
outlawed as well, thus any jump governor built to pump power into the grid on
emergence is illegal, immoral and fattening and likley to get you arrested as
an interstellar terrorist.

Reason I like this is because it means you _can_ create a planet-buster jump
torpedo that emerges really close to the planet. Of course, no civilized race
would use one.

Then again, the Xenophobes (remember StarForce ?) aren\'t what we\'d call
civilized

If it were my own system I\'d even be tempted to say that the 1-week travel
time is basd on jumping from 100D too. Jumping closer to a gravity well gives
you more J-Space "velocity" meaning you get there faster, whereas doing it
from further out makes it take longer, another reason why 100D is optimal.

I\'d have the times and energy requirments follow the inverse-cube law if the
maths works out nice,
so you can se that close i jumps really suck the power, and some ships may not
even be able to do them without burning out their systems.

I\'m certainly going to use that as the official explanation IMTU, though I
don\'t see why contact with, or looking at J-space should cause psychological
problems as such.

I\'d say contact with J-space can cause completely unpredictable effects on
_any_  physical matter.
These effects range from contact explosion, to molecular distortion, to
completely impossible effects, such as "possesion" of people or artifacts by
malevolent entities, a la "Event Horizon"

Lack of skilled combat pilots had immense implications in WWII after
the Battle of Britain, when the British lost many, and then in the late
war for the Luftwaffe, when they had no time to train new pilots.

Gotta love players!  Here\'s how I see it:  if you tape two weapons
together, size, weight, and recoil change; the new unit is bigger and
heavier and kicks harder than a single weapon.  Gauss rifles have less,
and more easily controlled, recoil than chemically propelled projectile
weapons because of their design (magnetic tube accelerating bullets
out).  Weight is doubled.  Size is doubled, but let\'s look at it from an
encumbrance perspective:  It\'s a bulkier weapon, but still probably not
as unwieldy as an LAG or LMG.  

The new to hit task is more difficult because the user is less familiar
with the size, weight, and recoil of the weapon.  How much more
difficult?  Because the weapon is not very big to start with and doesn\'t
have much recoil, I would put a negative DM on the basic to hit task,
rather than raising the difficulty level.  How much -DM?  Your call. I
agree about a higher -DM for rapid fire than single shots, until the
user is very familiar with the new arrangement.  

I would also have the -DM decrease over time as the user practices with
the weapon and gets used to the characteristics mentioned above.  

Do your gauss rifles have integral laser sights? electronic sights? how
are these affected by the new arrangement?  What about rifle grenades? 
(I\'d say no to rifle grenades because they are wider than the barrel of
the rifle (remember, they\'re shoot-through grenades), and can\'t be
affixed without being in the line of fire from the adjacent barrel.)  

How will the user make sure that the barrels are parallel -- or does he
want a little spread or convergence?  

I guess there are more questions than answers here; I hope you find them
helpful.

They\'re also implied in Book 2, Starships, at 15:  "Ships performing
jumps less than their maximum capacity consume fuel at a lower level

I think we have the same idea for this weapon. I was thinking of keeping the
increased difficulty level due to the make-shift nature of the weapon (duct
tape). If the player chooses to make more permanent modifications (welding,
etc...) then I\'ll probably reduce the DM to -2 (-4 for rapid fire). If he
goes to the trouble of designing a double-barreled gauss rifle and gets
sufficient practice then I would consider dropping the -DM.

I agree no RAM grenades. ...and as far as the sight is converned, it
probably won\'t be an issue. This player is more of the mind "more bullets is
better than aiming" usually taking combat slow and conducting rapid fire
every turn. (this was happening with our old ref, before he left and I took
over.) It would have been an interesting sight to actually see this guy in
action.

I imagine if the sights were actually used, only one of the sights could be
used and the other gun only hits on a successful pinpoint location shot.
(aim specifically off center but still in an area that can be hit by both
barrels)
If he goes to the trouble of setting up a sight in between both barrels,
this might help... but he would have to keep in mind that he would be
hitting to the right and left of center.

What do you think?

Because you may want more surface area for radiators. I suspect a geodesic
sphere would be more viable than a true sphere.

Showing my prejudices, I feel more comfortable with designs other than a
sphere, except when I\'m designing HG warships on a tight budget...

I sort of skimmed it and have a general question, not necessarily related
to your pages.

What is the minimum distance of a jump?

Could I jump as little as one meter?  If say, I didn\'t want to be located for
a week?

This would be enormously beneficial to smugglers and other criminals providing
a
redoubt, as well as misleading authorities who may be chasing them, if
possible.

    'body' => 'Dom Mooney\'s consensus explanation of how jump drives \'work\' is a good
one.

Hydrogen is consumed to punch the initial \'hole\' in space-time *and*
maintain a pocket of normal space that a vessel can travel through jump
space in ; literally a pocket universe!

The size and shape of the pocket universe is controlled by the jump
governor machinery, etc. of the ship, gobbling up a goodly amount of
computing capacity....

As understanding of jumpspace physics improves, it becomes apparent
that the hydrogen bubble is not required - virtual particles generated
from the \'vacuum\' will suffice to protect an object in jump space.

* The jump projector is a crude pocket universe generator, requiring
enormous amounts of energy (given contemporary estimates of quantum
vacuum energy, only a few cc of space time needs to be \'destroyed\').

Any object can be sent into jump space. Early in the course of
development of these devices, the pocket universes generated were very
unstable, undergoing "big crunches" within seconds... making them a most
useful weapons system.

The jump gate idea is a good one. Thanks Jason!

* Joe Dietrich had a good point about \'the gray wall of jumpspace\' being
a potential weapon.

Visual stimuli can cause nausea, vomitting, hypnosis, etc.
My preferred explanation for people going mad in jump is not a physical
effect on the brain (otherwise MR scanners, etc. would be dangerous) but
an aberrant stimulant effect on the CNS.

Look out for the \'jumpspace\' holovids, folks...

Keep the ideas coming, guys.
Gotta love this list....

Has anyone suggested that drop tanks are the Traveller equivalent of
lighter-than-air ships? Let\'s examine the similarities:

(1) The technology is reasonably simple, and decades old.

(2) If widely implemented, they would vastly change the economic
assumptions under which trade is conducted (cf. the numerous glowing
predictions in Popular Mechanics, etc.).

(3) No one uses them (except for a few highly specialized applications)
because of some well publicized disasters early in its history -- Akron as
well as Hindenburg -- disasters which there is no rational reason to think
would be repeated with modern technology. 

Given the inherent technological conservatism of the Imperium, I don\'t
think it\'s at all unreasonable that the 2-3 TL delay (so far) in
implementing widespread commercial and military use of LTA ships would
translate directly into centuries.

Now imagine the impact of just one more well publicized disaster on a
newly-inaugurated LTA shipping line, and you have the situation facing
Tukera in 1105.

About half of Far Trader is already "thrashed", as far as that goes. :)

I\'m not the economic expert (that\'s John), but I don\'t see where drop tanks
_by_themselves_ make all that much difference. We ran the numbers for
several different scenarios -- LASH frieghters, farports, SL vs. USL
freighters -- and they all came out very much the same. Jump masking had a
much more profound impact on commercial operations, which is why I ran it
by Marc Miller for confirmation before putting it in.

Fuel is not all that significant an expense, even when you calculate cargo
volume lost to internal tankage. Time is significant, as in the number of
jumps a given ship can make in a year. With drop tanks, you\'d be simply
trading overhead and time (capturing and remounting drop tanks) for
additional range. In the cases where that would be useful, I can\'t see that
it invalidates any of the underlying assumptions we made about trade and
commerce in the Imperium.

Maybe John has a different view; if so, I\'ll be happy to listen.

According to Dr. Kromm (the SJ Games GURPS guru) TAS membership is not an
advantage -- it\'s an investment of sorts, or a possession. If you want, you
could make TAS membership the justification for a Claim to Hospitality.

Most of the sample characters in Far Trader are merchants. In canon, they
do not normally have access to TAS membership as a mustering out benefit.
In practice, if any of them accumulated MCr 1 they\'d invest it in a
business or starship.

I\'d expect to see TAS members in GT: Imperial Navy, Ground Forces, or
Nobles. GT (p. 35) says Scouts as well, but I don\'t know whether Jon
Zeigler was tracking on that when he wrote First In.

Anglic (p. GT20). Remember that those are merchant characters, who have

Check out the illustrations in Far Trader, pp. 15, 56 (maybe), and 75, for
what appears to be Vilani script.

The Swordworlders speak a Scandanavian language, derived from Icelandic.

Most European languages are still spoken in the Islands Clusters, although
in forms several thousand years removed from the ones with which we\'re
familiar.

I\'d say no. By the same token, however, if you ever want to leave your
homeworld, you\'ll learn Anglic (and maybe Vilani, too, in that region).
Virtually all Traveller characters should have some fluency in one or both.

	The two gauss guns taped together does remind me of a weapon from the 
old Space Opera Game. it was called a Dolly Gun (for Dial-a-Gun) and was a 
laser, blaster and grenede launcher in a single weapon (three separate 
barrels).   
	I suppose you could built something like that at higher Taveller tech 
levels.  Perhaps a Heavy Laser Rifle, Gauss Rifle and Auto-Snub SMG built 
with a common stock (although I imagine this would be an Augmented Battle

This reminds me of one of the regulars at the paint ball field I used to
be a partner in...he taped a SMG and a regular paintball gun together with
the triggers lined up. "First" trigger was the pump, reach a bit farther
to tickle the SMG... It was moderately effective.

Maybe not that many thousand years removed. Remember that the majority 
of the colonists travelled to the Islands in cold sleep, with every generation
of awake crew & colonists including some Earth-born colonists awakened
from cold sleep in shifts. Also, most of those thousands of years were
spent in a very limited, controlled environment - aboard colony ships.
Not a new environment for these people, as many had lived their lives on
orbital stations before they signed on the Long Range ESA mission.

Since the environment will have few novel experiences, I\'d expect little
linguistic change - especially since the colonists had libraries and
videos in Earth languages, presenting a much more varied environment
than the one they lived in. The linguistic pressure would be towards
proper Earth dialect, rather than in their own directions, IMO. I\'d expect
their languages to have drifted less than almost every other colony group, 
due to their long quarantine from the rest of the galaxy.

Of course, once they landed on planets and had entire new environments
and social structures to deal with, their languages would start changing
at more common rates.

X-TEK/Maximus Defence Industries unviels Ground Support Meson Gun

X-TEK/Maximus Defense Industries, LIC unveiled its latest addition to the
\'Antioch Arms\' line of ground support weapons.

Harry Morrant, Spokesmerc and Chief MIB of X-TEK demonstrated the weapon
to invited guests on the HRD main testing range this afternoon.

The targets included a Trepida Grav Tank, A Rampart class fighter, and a
suit of Commando Battledess.  All targets, except the Battledress, were
remotely piloted.  All targets were destroyed with extreme prejudice.

It is believed the Imperial Marines have an extreme interest in this
weapon.

The smallest meson gun possible at current technology.
At 750lbs, this monstrosity would be impossible to wield if not for the
contragravity generators.
A specialized computer is incorporated into the unit to provide a firing
solution for the meson gun.
The computer uses the data gained from the laser rangefinder and
calculates the decay rate based on how \'deep\' the detonation should occur
within the target. The level of  \'deepness\' is set by the firer.
A HUDWAC is installed to provide optimal target and sighting information
to the wielder.  Information is displayed holographicly.

According to the article, the metal "..exerts a faint physical
attraction on every information-processing instrument so far
tested." Just what the instruments were isn\'t stated; they 
could have been rain gauges or a car\'s odometer, for all we
know.

So the only force which would provide the attraction stated
regardless of the nature of the instruments is..gravity!
Bravo to those who guessed correctly.

The second clue, BTW, was the distance of the instruments to
the metal when compared to the force of attraction.

All objects attract all other objects, according to the Law of
Gravitation, with the force of attraction equal to the inverse
square of the distance between the objects. Although magnetism
does the same, it won\'t attract non-magnetic instruments.

So much for my April Fools brain teaser.

Chock it up to a lack of coffee.  You did, indeed, on rereading, say that,
adn I did misinterpret to mean that 1" of BD was equal to 33" of Hard Steel.

Ah, now you come to the essence of the "other discussion".

In Megatraveller, a hull has a certain amount of volume no matter what
material it is made of or what the armor value is, which is just silly.  If
you chose to make your ship out of, say, armor level 40 of cardboard, the
mass might increase tremendously, but you\'d still have the same amount of
available tonnage internally to install stuff.  Other systems (striker I
think, and FF&S) require you to use internal volume to accomadate the
volume of the material of the armor.  MT simplifies this by not
aknowledging the volume.

So how thick is the armor, then, if we cannot directly determine the
thickness by the volume?  Well, the *mass* is 1/7th the mass of equivalent
Steel armor, but that is not the whole picture.  The density of the
material, as you point out above, will determine how much volume that mass
takes up.  Megatraveller is explicit that superdense is denser than other
materials, but bonded superdense is merely strengthened through an
"electrical current".  I would guess this adds no significant extra density
per se.

I think one of my other materials which are at home (I keep a set of basic
MT books at work for just these purposes) has the relative densities of the
other materials.  I will take a guess though that superdense is denser than
the densest "normal" element we know, which I think is Osmium at 22.6
g/cm^3 (my web resource for this data doesn\'t have the units mentioned, I
think this is the "standard" unit of measure).

If we guess that Superdense is, say, 30g/cm^3, and since Iron is 7.86
g/cm^3 (and steel is probably pretty close to that) then superdense is
probably about 3.75 times the density of Steel.  Therefore the thickness of
a typical hull is (33cm x .14 Div by 3.75=) 1.2cm of bonded superdense, at
a guess.

I would also say that there are ther factors; the shape of the hull and the
need for structural mmbers to be of a certain thickness, that will bring
the actual thickness of the hull plate down just a bit, on average.  It
would also make some sense if the hull plate on the outside of fuel tanks
were a bit thinner, and that around person-spaces a bit thicker along the
lines of the WWII battleships we were discussing before.  After all, a
typical puncture in the fuel spaces will not cause any real disaster.

Pete.

IMTU it\'s possible to dump and not actually go anywhere. There doesn\'t have

All attorneys aren\'t rich, or crooked. Not even a good percentage.

Thanks, Chris. If that\'s what Sean says, then I\'ll go with that. I suppose

Yep, the P39 was Chuck Yeager\'s first plane to train in.  He describes

I thought the Comets suffered from metal fatigue. In the wing roots,

I\'d be happy to take on the New Colchis slot. Rumors of an secret
alliance between Sansterre and New Colchis would then be
completely unfounded, of course. <weg>

Can you put a cut-off date on these two systems, and we fill them
with evil SDB\'s and Monitors? If each system spends all it\'s money
on system defense, no one (but maybe the Esperanzans) are going
to bother them, we can effectively have them out of play.

It would appear we have one player (Serendip Belt) not responding, 
and another player (New Colchis) unable to play.  So, we\'re looking
for one definite player (New Colchis) and one alternate (Serendip Belt).

No, it seems quite sensible. After all, the minimum armour requirement
is to resist micrometeor damage - and at the impact velocities we are
looking at, that\'s quite some armour.

You might also note that `x\' protection factors of bonded superdense
armour is going to be much thinner than `x\' protection factors of RHA.

It\'s a bit more complex than drop tanks/no drop tanks. The Comet was the
first commercial jet aircraft, but by the time of the crashes, and
cancellation of the orders, Boeing was close to entry into the market,
with the 707, which was a far more robust, larger aircraft. That\'s what
really killed the Comet after the intial crashes. The commercial world
was willing to wait a few years for a more economical, safer aircraft.

Thus, the initial drop tank fiascos would probably only put off the
adoption of drop tanks by a few years, at most a decade, once they
figured out what was going on.

Excellent job on the new version of World Builder Deluxe.  Overall, I
really like it.  The HTML formatted IS23 looks sweet, although it
keeps causing an error when I try to have the system generate world
details for the sector in that format.  (Always crashes on the first
world for me.)  Still, the plethora of info generated is outstanding!
 Thanks, also, for the honorable mention in your list of credits.

I did have a few suggestions to offer, if you have time.

1)  Since you obviously have the parser capacity to take entered UWP
data from SEC files, etc, why don\'t you remodel the Input UWP form
to become more user-friendly?  You can still use List Boxes for the
star data input, but you can take the UWP as an input field, run
some data verification to insure everything is in Upper case, and
then send it through your parser to seed your variables.  Either
method could be used for the Population, Belt and Gas Giant info,
depending on what looks good on the new form.  Just a suggestion.

2)  I noticed that the System Generation doesn\'t document satellites
for the worlds, like we see in published System Details.  I do
notice that satellites are generated in some of the data formats,
though. Would it be possible to include Satellite Generation as part
of System Details in a future release?  This way, if a Gas Giant
occupies the habitable zone of the System, the Mainworld can be a
Satellite of it.  I would like that very much, just for the flavor
it gives a setting.  Also, in this way Satellites could also receive
their own World Details sheet, which may spark some thoughts and
concepts for adventures and locations.  Just a thought.

3)  In Extended System Generation, I notice that worlds other than
the mainworld are not assigned an alternate name, such as those
suggested by the nomenclature from Book 6: Scouts or MegaTraveller
Referee\'s Manual.  While the name of the star doesn\'t have to be
listed, perhaps the greek letters, etc, might be listed in the name
field of the world or satellite to help with in-system references.

4)  The System Details data can also be HTML-ized.  I could send you 
a few examples if you are interested in the code or format.

5)  Also, since you have the capacity to generate Sectors randomly,
I would assume that you have a means of evaluating the generated
data for Trade Classifications.  You can also send the Inputted UWP
through the same classification process, and thus relieve the user
of entering that data on the Input UWP form as well.

6)  Finally, I would like to know what error has occured when one 
does, so that I might be able to figure out if it has to do with my 
file structure or with an internal problem within WBD.  It can prove 
helpful in diagnosing other bugs that may crop up as the fans put 
your hard work through its paces.

Once again, thanks for a great job!  I like it, and will be using it 
for some time, I\'m sure.  (Or, at least until the next version comes 
along.)   :)

In Service,
Jason

PS  One last thing, could you make it minimizable, so that I can hide 
it from my boss while I\'m using it at work.  :)  j/k

Figure that a spinal mount does 6d*250 * sqrt(# of spaces), has a 1/2 damage
range of 1 hex per 6d*1000, Max of 3x that, costs about .6 MCr/space, and has
sufficient Acc to make the question unimportant.  To determine the number of

so a type T meson (7000 spaces, 3000 energy) is 10,000 spaces, does 6d*25,000, 
has a 1/2D range of 25 hexes, and costs MCr 6,000.

Not really.  I\'d convert by taking the actual volume of the armor, filling it
all with manuever drives, and then piling on however much DR gives me the
correct final performance.

Hm...it might well have atrocious effects on armor penetration, if you want the
classic 1cm beam, even normal target movement could probably scatter the beam
across a hundred square centimeters or more (and presumably a vehicle being
shot at by a laser will respond by moving to scatter the beam).  Not sure how
the penetration effects would compare with just increasing the focal area to
around ten cm across and keeping the pulse extremely short (the second doesn\'t
require as much additional design work on the laser, since pulse and beam are
fairly different).  In any case, lasers in atmosphere _have_ to be visible
light, X-ray lasers will get stopped pretty much regardless of how you do it.

For some strange reason, people in the real world do not run around in

Duh.. I should have realized that. 

Do you have reference handy for the elements that make up the "layers"
in a star that\'s about to supernova? I know that the outermost shell
will have some hydrogen burning and the next shell will be helium
burning. But I\'m not sure what the succeding shells are except for the
last one being silicon ( 2 Si28 -> 1 Fe56).

It\'ll be a straight line for two reasons. First, you need a *high*
speed, since most ships lack the acceleration to get away from anything
*close* to a standing start.

Second, at any sort of speed worth mentioning, you *can\'t* make large
course changes unless you want your ship ripped to shreds. You basicly
need a headaway that is substantially larger than the local wind
velocities.

Please note that Earth\'s moon is an aberration. A typcal moon for an
Earth sized planet will be more like Phobos or Deimos (the moons of
Mars). Big enough to provide *some* protection, but not much. Rocks a
few miles across. A few heavy meson gun shots and the crust will be
well cracked and of little protection for a meson site.

Also, they\'ll be a hell of a lot *closer*. 

Terra/Luna is more of a "double planet" and thus a *rare* configuration.

And you need the equivalent of several *feet* of steel to protect

The one I had (from a 60s era kit) had what looked suspiciously like
missile bays on the underside. I can\'t be sure as I got the assembled
model from a friend who was clearing out excess stuff.

So does kinetic energy. Without an "exhaust", you wind up with energy

So consider the power required to give 2g of acceleration to a ship
that is already moving at 100 km/s. Assume 500t same as in your
example below. F=M*a, so P = M*a*V

P=500,000*20*100,000
P=1e12

So to continue accelerating at 2g after reaching 100 km/s, your scout
requires 1 *terawatt* of power! And this goes up linearly with your
velocity.

Ever check the power output of a rocket engine? You\'ll be shocked. As I
recall the Space Shuttle engines "only" generate a few hundred MW. 

I\'m too tired to try to figure the power output of a fusion rocket

That\'s *why* I want my space fighter zipping along at Mach 25. The
plasma sheath may make me noticeable, but it ought to seriously
compromise the usefulness of any lasers.

And I still think that with the right sort of electromagnetic and
electrostatic fields, you could interact with the ionized air to tailor
the hypersonic airflow.

Peak wavelength goes down (ie more towards UV, xray, gamma, etc) as
temp goes up.

Also, this is about as far from a "black body" as you can get. *Very*
high temp hydrogen (like the soloar corona, only worse) *and* highly
ionized. The radiation is likely to be electrons dropping from high
orbits to lower (but still above ground state) orbits. As I recall,
most of the Lyman series of hydrogen lines are in the UV.

I\'m going to be taking a trip in a week or so. On Amtrak. I\'ll be in a
"standard bedroom", so I\'ll try to note the dimensions. The "Deluxe"
bedroom includes a sink, toilet and shower, so it\'s sort of equivalent
to a "standard" stateroom in Traveller, right down to double occupancy.
I\'ll see if I can get a look at one of those.

Remember that some routes take 3-4 days, so it\'s not *too* far from
jump. I\'m only taking the first leg (8 hours) of the Portland to
Chicago route, which is 2-3 days.

Analog, Dec 1998. "The World\'s Simplest Fusion Reactor", by Tom Ligon

Basicly using a spherical "grid" to create a space charge and
accelerate hydrogen ions towards the (empty) center. The voltages
required aren\'t that hard to generate, and while most of the ions would
"miss" each other as they zipped thru the center, they\'d be slowed as
they climbed against the electrical potential. They\'ll brake to a stop
and fall back for another pass. 

The grid is *very* sparse as you only need a few wires to setup up an
adequately shaped potential well. So only a few ions get lost by
colliding with the grid. 

Apparently the devices are considered "Inertial Electrostatic
Confinement" reactors. And are a class of "Spherical Convergent Focus
Electrostatic Ion Accelerators".

I like this description.  Will this be aggreed upn by both camps in the coil
vs grid debate?  

And if you need to extend a jump field beyond a basic ship, for a bulk
carrier, or a battle rider, etc, you can.  Very nice.  This will also allow
subordinate craft to carried externally - the grid/coil combo has to allow
for a craft of a particular size and configuration, but not a particular
individual craft.  Now to make economic sense, the coil must be much more
expensive than the grid - more lanthanum, or a purer form, or a rarer
isotope?

...that reminds me, what does the Judicial system of the Imperium look like?
Is it a separate branch?  Or is this something that is included in the
duties of nobles?  Are cases decided by the local nobles at hand, with
appeals to going before higher nobles (possibly with the Emperor being akin
to the Supreme Court)?  Or are appeals even allowed?

Are defendants presumed innocent until proven guilty, or vice versa?

I think that Kenji runs a separate mailing list devoted entirely to
discussion of languages in Traveller.

I think canon holds that the "official" languages are Galanglic and
Vilani, and that all official documents are in both languages -- but
then, it could be just Galanglic.  

> Does the Imperium place a language requirement on new member worlds,
> mandating that the planet begin teaching Vilani or Anglic in schools?

1)  Most worlds will have retained some use of Vilani and Galanglic,
because the Imperium is largely coterminus with the Ziru Sirka and Rule
of Man.  

2)  Imperial policy in this regard depends on the time about which
you\'re asking the question.  During the time that the Solomani faction
had a lot of power at court, it\'s likely that they tried to
"solomanicize" the Imperium, in part by imposing Galanglic language
requirements on new members.  By the 1100s (and certainly for a long
time before), the Imperium had developed a "hands off" policy toward
most of the internal governance of its member states.

3)  At any time, the languages of court and the Imperial Government will
be Galanglic and Vilani, so all member states will necessarily want some
parts of their populations to be able to use these languages.  Galanglic
and Vilani will also be the linguae francae of commerce in the Imperium,
as Vilani was during the Ziru Sirka.  

> I\'m thinking over how I\'m going to attack this problem in my game, and I
> thought I\'d see how others feel.

I have a couple of thoughts that you might find helpful.  

First, humans create new languages rather quickly, starting almost as
soon as a group becomes isolated.  The history of humans in space
includes many long periods of isolation, and one therefore expects that
many worlds will have developed their own languages.  The Ancients put
humans on some worlds, and these populations were isolated for some
300,000 years until contacted by the Ziru Sirka or, much later, the
Zhodani Consulate.  The pre-contact languages on these worlds will each
be unique, and each world will likely have many languages -- after all,
these humans have had as much time to develop languages as humans on
Terra.  Colonists from the Ziru Sirka and, very much later, from Terra,
moved to other worlds -- some without Ancient-placed humans and some
with -- and then were cut off from interstellar culture during the Long
Night and even during the Rule of Man.  Languages will have developed on
these worlds, too. (I don\'t remember Zhodani history well enough to
comment on this point.)  

Second, technology will affect language development and Traveller play. 
(1) Broadcast telecommunications will tend to standardize the languages
broadcast.  Travel times may mean that worlds aren\'t bombarded daily
with standardized language.  (2) Language translation devices will be
ubiquitous in a cosmopolitan, polyglot Imperium.  The typical translator
will be a computer with vocabulary and grammar for as many languages as
can be crammed into its hard drive, and with both vocal and visual
inputs and outputs.  It should be the size of the Book 3 hand computer.  

Language difficulties (and overcoming them) are a part of travelling in
the Real World (tm) -- and, more important, part of the fun of such
travel.  They should also enhance Travelling in the Far Future.

> ObTraveller: Is there such a thing as a "Public Defender" under Imperial

No, I don\'t think so.  Bear in mind that Imperial law doesn\'t have
anything to do with local law, other than outlawing slavery.  So if
you\'re facing criminal charges on some planet, you\'re subject to its
laws and you have the civil rights that it provides, which could be more
or less than under Imperial law.  Maybe you get a PD, maybe not.  What
are the government type and law level?  That should give you some idea
of your civil rights.

You\'ll only get before an Imperial court on charges relating to Imperial
crimes:  treason, espionage, piracy, lese-majeste, or other Imperial
High Crimes; or violence, theft, etc. committed on Imperial property
(like a starport) -- i.e., Imperial Low Crimes.  

The Imperium doesn\'t have a tradition of bourgeois civil rights, the
Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights, and all that stuff that we take for
granted today.  The Emperor is an absolute ruler; the nobles have
absolute rights to rule subject to the Emperor\'s grant.  Your civil
rights as a citizen of the Imperium are to be protected from outside
invasion and internal slavery and piracy, but that\'s about all.  If
you\'re also a noble, you\'re entitled to certain courtesies, and to make
privileged speeches on the Moot floor -- privileged in that you can\'t be
prosecuted for libel, treason, or sedition for what you say, nor even
for lese-majeste unless you\'re being really stupid and say something
that really causes a lesion on His Majesty.

On the other hand, the Imperial government wants to cultivate an image
of legitimacy.  It wants to rule with the active, enthusiastic consent
of the governed.  That\'s the basis of the "hands off local matters"
policy.  When the Imperium is going to prosecute someone, it looks at it
as a political matter, and weighs what must be done to appear to be
righteous.  

I think that I wrote a lot about my views on this subject on this list a
few years ago.

Good point.  Even TL 15 duct tape is still ... duct tape.  It\'ll give
when the weapon is carried and fired, he\'ll have to re-tape
occasionally.  What if it\'s raining?  I guess TL 15 adhesive will last a
while.

I\'m not surprised.  Have you ever seen that Movie of the Week from like
1972 with two soldiers on an island?  I think Darrin McGavin is the US
soldier.  The US and maybe China have gotten into some unsolvable
conflict, but neither wants full-scale war, so they agree to a duel of
champions and agree to abide by the result.  Anyway, the American has
this cool double-barrelled SMG.  It was like a Schmeisser or and M-3,
but with two barrells and two magazines.  It really tore up the jungle.

If he\'s using a laser sight, I would just treat it as a normal laser
sight -- after all, if he hits the red dot, the other bullet is hitting
just a couple cm away.  Maybe he\'d want to use both laser sights,
anyway, to terrorize the enemy a little more.  

The visual/electronic/image enhanced/whatever sight, on the other hand,
might be more of a problem.  What if it\'s on the side of the weapon, and
not on top?  That will interfere with taping -- or he\'ll have to remove
the right rifle\'s sight.  

This guy sounds like fun.  Give him some good challenges.

Gurps Space and the Imperium?  Huh?

FWIW, since all Imperial citizens (nobles excluded of course), would
presumably have equal access to whatever courts exist, a public defender
would be mandatory _if_ you have an adversarial judicial system.
If you have an inquisitorial system, then it wouldn\'t be necessary,
though to promote fairness, I suspect there would still be some sort of
public advocate/defender available for indigents.

Its still in development, but I envision for MTU, a fairly complicated
system,
with an inquisitorial Ministry of Justice that is judge/investigator for
crimes (with
prosecution handled by a separate department withing the MoJ), and only as
judge for civil law matters, with hefty fees for using the Imperial Courts.

I should have said "varied" instead of "complicated."  I think that exactly
what
type of judicial system seen in the 3I will vary by location, and local
nobility.
In the Spinward Marches, you might be likely to see "frontier" justice,
with
brutal efficiency, but in Core, you might see a system full of ancient
ritual
and procedure.

Of course, Dukes and Archdukes probably have a great deal of leeway in
particular refinements they wish to make.  I have in mind a totally
different
system for dealing with lawsuits involving Imperial nobility.

I\'ve actually been drafting something this week on these topics, and may
post
something soon.

Uhm, I think you mean American.  If we were going by number of governments
or population, the Anglo-American or \'Common Law\' system of law is in the
minority of approaches to legal systems.  More common is the \'Civil\' or
\'Romano-Germanic\' system
(the term \'civil\' referring to the Justinian Code), which  generally uses a
common Code of
laws, written in allegedly plain language, which is then interpreted by courts in
each
particular case.  Although, \'standard\'  interpretations exist for the most part
in these
systems, strictly speaking, such courts are rarely, if ever, required to follow
the rule of
\'stare decisis\' (the thing decided), i.e., _binding_ precedent, and may decide
each case
without being held to apply rules used in previous decisions.  In the 1960s, even
England
(UK) backed away, at least officially, from the strict stare decisis rule that
the US at least
purports to practice.

I\'d be interested to hear speculations on how Vilani legal processes might vary
from
Solomani systems (both Civil and Common).

That depends on how much credence you give to the Imperial Constitution
that appears in Milieu 0.  If you accept it, and I do, then the Imperium is
has
an authority as broad as that of the US Congress to legislate under the
Commerce clause of the US Constitution.

I\'ve recently written a couple of pages on this very topic that I will post
to my website soon.  Its too long, and probably too dry for the non-legal
types, to post here.

Uhh, ever use milspec Duct Tape?  AKA 600 mph tape, AKA The Force (it

Quite strong and pretty damn waterproof, too. You can\'t wrap it on
something when it\'s raining, but that\'s about it. And if it\'s not
raining too hard you can stick it on, just requires a paper towel to
absorb the water off the surface as you lay it down.

NB: Spoken from RL experience. When (lo these many years ago) I decided
to gallivant across country on my Moto Guzzi, one essential tool in my
hardbags was my roll of 600mph tape.

I calculated a ship accelerating to the midway point, and then
decelerating. If you look at the time charts in the Imperial
Encyclopedia, then the distance is not equivalent to calculating 10
times the planet\'s diameter to get the 10 diameter distance, nor 100
diameter. In fact, the distance that the Encyclopedia seems to show is
that the distance is considerably more than the x 10 or x 100 (multiply
by 10 or 100). Strange. From what I gather, I may ignore these tables,
since they would make drawing a space map time consuming.

Thanks for all the feedback, but I am still stomped by the charts.

One thing is that the differnt

I will say that I do realize that some people are using drop
tanks and it would be best not to leave them high and dry.
That is why I think GT should have them as an optional rule.]

Well, First of all, if you really want to stick to canon, then
you have to stick to canon, contradictions and all.  If you are
willing to fiddle with things like black globes, jump projects,
whether drop tanks use all their fuel at once, how you
get to using antimatter at higher TLs, etc. it seems
a simpler thing to drop something that only appeared a few places
and was never explored.  (Actually, I wouldn\'t "drop" it,
I would make it an optional rule.  That way those who\'s
campaign are already set on them aren\'t abondoned).

I have no desire to stick with minor bits of canon
that were never really explored and have real problems. In
spite of all the other things I mentioned, we still haven\'t
gotten into one of the real problems with drop tanks.  They
require you to burn the fuel and store it as energy.  That
means there is no way around the "why don\'t you also use all
that energy for weapons" problems.

Well, I\'ve never given it.  But I do think the "fuel" is use for
fuel.  However, ships can not normally handle those kind of
throughputs.  What the jump drive has going for it is the
lanthanum grid (coil, whathever) gets grounded in jump
space, which allows you to pour the energy directly into
it without melting the reactor.

There have been a number of theories to solve the "why don\'t you
use all the energy for weapons" problem.  That is the one that
I think works best.

No, I also have changes in balance of power, etc (see my
previous post).

Also, the change in the economics doesn\'t
_finish_ right away, but it does begin right away (actaully,
according the TNS, it began a dozen years before).  Those
should be years of fundamental change, which will affect
PC (if you don\'t ignore how the world around them works)
significantly.  It will change what people ask of them,
why they ask it of them, what they can do (both directly
using the technology and if they want to do something like
trade in the changing climate), etc.

What you are doing is simply using one event to derail another.
Even then you should be exploring how drop tanks change the
balance of power in the rebellion (like jump-3 changed the
intersetellar wars).  Of course none of this applies to
settings were these don\'t apply.

Well, this is, IMO, the only real arguement I can see.  If you
decided that focusing your setting on the introduction of drop
tank technology is what you want to do, then you get around the fundamental
change in the setting issue.  You still have the "why don\'t you use jump
energy for weapons".

I think a lot of people think that there are more interested things
that can be done, and a lot of people feel they wanted to move
to a B5 kind of situation, they would play B5, and there is still
the "jump energy for weapons" problem.  However, this
is a judgement which is up to Author/GM.  If that is what they
want to do...  But in the end, the current
approach of introducing them, but have them have no other impact
other than a toy for PCs doesn\'t really work.

>The economics have never been fleshed out enough for this
>to be considered anyways.

Well, not quite.  The kinds of ships you interacted with, the
cost of cargo, etc. all change enough to be notice, even
under MT.  Additionally, GT does, in fact, flesh out the
economics.

>We\'ve hardly had a
>definitive look at every ship in the 3I, at any date.

We have definately been presented with what are suppose to
be the common types.  And if the introduction of drop
tanks mean that the price of shipping drops (for example), then it
does affect the PCs.

That might buy you a year or two.  Maybe less since they are

But those implications have to be believable

That has been done.  TNS presented them with working prototypes
and stated they had been in use for a dozen years.

Careful.  The only strawman I see is here.  I have never argued
they would appear overnight.  I said they would introduce a
period of introduction which would be a period of change.

>the basic setting of G:T (1120)

No.  It doesn\'t take decades to build a ship, let alone convert
and existing one to drop tanks.  (Esp since there is a ship
yard supposedly already set up to do it).  Those are the
kind of timescales you need to research the technology, not
implement it.  What is more, even if it did, it leaves
you in trap where you can\'t advance the timeline without
having face all the problems we discussed.

In GT they are suppose to have been in use in the interior
29 years and in the Marches for over a decade.  That is more
than enough time for shipping along the main trade routes
to go over to them and invalidate Free Trader, change the
basic cost of shipping, and have people start facing competition
from the new ships in various areas.  It also
plenty of time for them to be the driving force for
change, derailing the plot elements that Loren seems
to be developing.

It also cause real problems with the "using jump fuel for
weapons" problem (we really need a name for that :-)

I don\'t agree.  The change in economics means that there are
also powerful interests in favor of them.  All oppostion is
going to mean is that the fight betweent these powerful
interests is going to have an even greater in impact on
the setting.  Corps are going line up one way or another,
political factions and nobles are going to line up, PC will
get hired for jobs to support stop, poeple will attempt to
influence current trade and revenues to strengthen/weaken
a particular side, ships will be attacked, etc.

I\'m not sure what you mean here.  Are you going to back to the
arguement that the TNS entries and rules should be changed
to make them arbitrarily (and unalterably) dangerous? Like
I said before, yuck.

Or are you arguing that they were meant to be arbitrarily
dangerous (yuck again) but, for some unknown reason, they
decided to say that had been in use for a dozen years
in the interior, refered the incident as quality control
instead of fundamental problems (again, inexplicitly),
 and "forgot" to put any rules for them being dangerous?
My response to that is indeed "lol".

You have one incident, that is not in any one ascribed to
fudnamental problems, also mentions there use elsewhere
without fundamental problems, and when presented in the
rules not rules are given for fundamental problems. I
have a hard time reading that as saying it was intended
they have fundamental problems.

You have got to be kidding.  Corps run on the bottom line.  They
are going _jump_ at something that affects it.  The Imperium
isn\'t going to ingnore something that give them the edge just
becuase they don\'t like new things (why do you think they have
all those research stations).

Gary.  Knock off the strawman comments!  You have been twisting

For example...

I never said this!  I said that the claim is that shipping will
now come in predetermined locations that are now easier to
protect (the pirate has to attack a station to get at the
ship).


[More rationalizations about how it won\'t change things for the
PCs.  For me, trying to not see the implication of the technology
you are introducing is a sure way to a hokey background.  If you
want to have a realistic setting that matches the technologies
in use, you have to try and see how it would affect it, not
try and come up with rationalization about why it wouldn\'t
have any effect].

From where you sit.  I\'m trying to be polite and cast this
as a different point of view.  To be honeest, what I really
believe if that your rationalization are shallow and not
credible and are the same sort of thing that gave rise to
hokey settings.  I though it would be better to invoke
AD&D as a hokey setting rather than Virus.  But your comments
on how I\'m arguing my points is getting me to now care...

Don\'t get your hopes up.  A few decades to mostly finish.  (A lot

5, this will be the _end_ of a period of change that will
start as soon as they are introduced.

I do believe it would be better to make them an optional rule
rather than drop them entirely.  Free trader is a problem
because it assumes it knows the how the bulk of freight is
shipped and then fits the PC into that setting.  At best
you might get a Pyramid article on how adapt it (if it could
be done in that short of a space).

Actually it argues the other way.  It shows how, if the change
is an important one, it will go forward.  There was never any
inclination to abondon jet airliners and it driving force
was to keep going until they found the problem.  However,
in either case the stuation is limited for Traveller because
drop tanks are suppose to have been in use in the interior for
a dozen years without incident and the TNS entry is protrayed
as quality control and not design flaw.

Please note that Earth\'s moon is an aberration. A typcal moon for an
Earth sized planet will be more like Phobos or Deimos (the moons of
Mars). Big enough to provide *some* protection, but not much. Rocks a
few miles across. A few heavy meson gun shots and the crust will be
well cracked and of little protection for a meson site.

Also, they\'ll be a hell of a lot *closer*.

Terra/Luna is more of a "double planet" and thus a *rare* configuration.
</Leonard>

Actually, the most recent models (reported in Nature and IIRC
Astrophysical Letters) indicate that double planets will not be as rare as
was previously thought.  Early solar system models now suggest that
relatively "late and large" impacts will be quite common, thus allowing
time for accretion before the impact "lops off" a large moon.

I was also interested to read that new solar system formation models seem
to indicate that planets form in a much more chaotic manner than our
relatively orderly solar system would indicate.  That is, gas giants don\'t
really have a very strong tendency to be formed in the outer system, and
planet distances don\'t follow Titius-Bode relations.

(Yes, I keep bringing these articles up.  It\'s cuz I like the freedom it
gives to star system design...)

Well, Far Trader does it in a comprehensive manner, after all,
it works up from thing like what is the trade volume between
worlds, etc.   I do think the jump-tanks would mean it
would have to reworked.

I also think, that if they exist there are quite a number of
places where it wuold be odd that a drop tanks ship wasn\'t
used.  It also, IMO, has a ripple affect and the gains in
losses in economics due to them should be affecting who
the PC see running things, etc.  It also means that PC should,
if they travel on commercial ships, be leaving from jump
stations.  What happens there?  Does it eliminate piracy
like Ian (?) claims?   Do the PC get hired by General
Shipyards because they are rich from them or by Oberlindes
because they are poor?  Has GS become so powerful that they
monopolize shipping to the point that even Free Traders have
to cowtow to them?  Is the threat of a Zhodani war gone
becuase the Imperium has them?  Do the Sword Wolrds not
try and take back the border worlds for the same reason?
It the PCs are running a trader, how does drop tanks
ships affect their competition?

If you think about it (and people will) questions are
going to come up.  If they aren\'t dealt with, it will
seem odd and make the setting hokey.

They also have the problem in that they firmly establish
that jump fuel can be converted to power and should be
usable for other purposes.

I\'ve done a couple of Amtrak trips: 24 hours in a "standard", 
SF Bay Area to Seattle, and a cross-country (4 day?) run from 
NY to SF, the first night in a standard and the rest in a 
deluxe.

From memory, I\'d guess the standard room at 5\'x10\' (one HG
deckplan ton, two squares), and the deluxe at 10\'x10\' (4
squares, which is pretty common in Traveller deckplans). 

Incidentally, both rooms offer over-and-under bunks; the 
bunks (at least the lower) are somewhat wider on the deluxe.
In the standard, even a honeymooning couple aren\'t going 
to share a bunk for sleeping - other activities, sure. ;-) 
In the deluxe, you\'ll want to split up for sleeping if 
either one of you is prone to nocturnal reorientation maneuvers.

Both types are pretty impressive in their economical use of 
space, but a week in a standard sounds pretty brutal. You\'d 
probably spend most of your time in a lounge car, retreating
to the room only to sleep - hence a starship designed along 
those lines would have more common spaces and smaller cabins,
but probably a very similar total amount of space. 

I\'m something of an antisocial animal, so I think I\'d go nuts - 
having my breakfast and dinner at a table shared with complete

there\'s PEOPLE out there... AAARGH!" 

The visual appearance of J-space becomes VERY relevant if you 
spend time in a room that small: you will want to look at 
ANYTHING other than the inside of the room, so when you get 
tired of reading and socializing, you\'ll look out the window.
On a train, that means your neck gets sore and your eyes get 
tired of flicking back and forth to follow the scenery. 
Nivenesque No-See-Um hyperspace would get me out of the room,
drinking cheap whiskey, and talking to people pretty quick.

The deluxe sleeping compartment is quite a bit better, and 
I can envision spending a week in it. Do they actually have
individual showers? I seem to recall shared showers on the 
lower deck of the car and the rooms on the upper, but it\'s 
been a while. 

Keep in mind that in Traveller, you\'ve got the week in jump
plus a day or so of maneuver on each end. Plus, you might be
going more than one hop - you might get to spend a few days 
off-ship, but you know you\'re going right back into that 
little box pretty soon. And if you\'re a crewbeing rather than
a passenger, that little box is going to be your home for 
a year or more.

I think in GT you just buy it with cash.  However, I had it as

This discussion comes up on the list from time to time.  If I can find
my previous writing on the subject (which was fairly extensive, but
doesn\'t seem to be on this computer), I\'ll repost it.

Briefly, Imperial justice is carried out by selected nobles who receive
the title of "Lord Judge" or "Imperial Judge" in addition to their other
titles.  Selected means appointed by the appropriate person.  The
Emperor appoints archdukes and sector dukes to be Lords Judicial. 
Sector dukes may appoint lower Lords Judicial as they see fit, subject
to the consent of the archduke and Emperor.  The decisions of lower
Imperial Judges may be appealed to a higher Lord Judge, with the Emperor
sitting as the highest Imperial Judge and the end of the appellate
process.  The Emperor in practice doesn\'t have time both to play judge
and run an empire, so he or she typically appoints an Imperial High
Court, consisting of some very high ranking nobles with judicial
inclinations, scholarly backgrounds, and plenty of money (to make them
appear less easily corrupted).  

I won\'t try to recreate what I\'ve previously written about the
jurisdiction (subject matter; civil/criminal; trial/appellate; etc.) of
various courts until I\'ve looked through a few diskettes.

Maybe the coil is made of zuchai crystals.  I\'ve always wondered what
they were, so maybe it turns out that they\'re a rare isotope of
lanthanum?  See Marc Miller, "Amber Zone:  Crystals from Dinom," 2 Best
of the Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society 40, 40 ("An emergency
construction order from the Imperial Navy for jump drives caught Quadric
Industries unprepared as the corporation had not yet taken delivery on a
shipment of vital zuchai crystal.")  

I think Starship Operators\' Manual incorporates zuchai crystals.  If
they\'re lanthanum, they can stop being mysterious zapotron rays (tm).

That\'s a good question.  To the extent that the Imperium wants that air
of legitimacy and the active consent of the governed, it will adhere to
the rule of innocent until proven guilty, will notify defendants of the
charges and evidence against them, and will have public trials.

I think varied and complicated are both appropriate, as legal systems
tend to be both (as a lawyer, my work largely revolves around getting
results through the varied and complicated California and federal court
systems).

Great!  I look forward to seeing it.  If you (or anyone else) can search

I would appreciate it, and thanks for the brief summary as well.  (I\'m
currently trying to hobble together a decent campaign...and I\'m relatively
new to the list...so I keep bringing up topics that have already been
covered.  So far everbody has been rather patient, and quite

Warning: All this is IMTU!

Imperial crimes are investigated by the Ministry of Justice, and tried by a
panel of nobles from the affected area.

Any crime committed on a member world is prosecuted by that world\'s
authorities.  There is an expectation of fairness, in that trials with
pre-determined outcomes are likely to draw imperial attention sooner or
later.  The nature of the court process is up to the planet\'s culture.

Which brings up extradition.  In most cases, when a criminal is recognized
and apprehended on a world other than the one where the offense occurred,
it\'s a simple matter for the arresting world to send the suspect back for
trial.  But it can get messy.. what if the second world considers the
expected punishment to be inhumane?  Or if they don\'t even consider the
offense to be a crime!

This is where the bounty hunter comes in.  There will be some liberal
worlds that turn into havens for fugitives.  Not necessarily low law
worlds, but places that consider the rest of the universe unenlightened
fools when it comes to law and order.  These worlds might not appreciate
outsiders grabbing people for "illegal" trials.  Interesting adventure
ideas there...

The Solomani tradition is largely based on the American model, because
the USA dominated the United Nations government during the Interstellar
Wars.

DGP\'s Vilani and Vargr gives a good flavor of Vilani culture.  Vilani
culture is highly regulated.  I\'d expect that legal procedures would be
drafted in excruciating detail -- with the result that people would
avoid the court system if possible, by resorting to arbitration,
mediation, ombudsmen, etc.

I sort of skimmed it and have a general question, not necessarily
related
to your pages.

What is the minimum distance of a jump?

Could I jump as little as one meter?  If say, I didn\'t want to be
located for
a week?

This would be enormously beneficial to smugglers and other criminals
providing
a
redoubt, as well as misleading authorities who may be chasing them, if
possible.

>>>>
I enjoyed reading the FAQ.  I think your use of the term Tachyon is a
bit confusing since it is different than the physics use of the term (as
an FTL particle that gets more massive the slower it gets - the closer
to it\'s lower speed limit of c).  I would suggest a more generic term
like "Jump particle."
It has been stated several places (including an instance on the TML
from Marc himself) that a Jump-in-place is perfectly acceptable. 
Essentially, a Jump-0 is the same as a Jump-1 except that you go less
than a parsec (including zero displacement).  My own extension of this
is that if you want to Jump fractional amounts, you use the next higher
Jump number to determine fuel costs and required drives (e.g. a Jump 1.2
would require a Jump-2 drive, and use 20% of the hull volume as fuel). 
Fractional Jumps are rarely used except for under J1 (for in-system
Jumps).

It may have the authority -- and I haven\'t paid much attention to Milieu
0 since I bought it -- but in my Traveller universe, it stopped
exercising it as part of Arbellatra\'s reforms after the Civil Wars. 
Member states tired of decades of war were inclined to remain within a
looser empire that provided for the common defense but kept its nose out
of local affairs.

Nope.  That\'s my list.  Kenji is probably our

I don\'t think that Vilani is an official language, although it\'s
fairly widely known in the former Ziru Sirka.

The book is a bit surprising from a physical standpoint.  At 352 pages,
it is about the same dimentions as many books that are more like 250
pages.  It also feels quite a bit heavier than normal for a book it\'s
size.  The publicatio page says it is printed on acid-free, recycled
paper.  They type is also smaller than I am used to in pocket sized
sci-fi books.  It looks like the ratio of type size is similar to that
between 10 and 12 point fonts (I don\'t know what it\'s actual size is,
but that ratio fells about the same).
All in all, this is a dense, but good read.  It definately has the feel
of the RCES that I would expect from the othe material published by

I have to admit, I don\'t know much about tachyon. I\'ve read a little from
the internet and saw it\'s use in reference to FTL, wormholes and black
holes. I will consider the use of "jump particle". I invisioned the Tachyons
as being particles that can only exist in jump space. If a field of tachyons
particles were formed around the ship, then the ship would exist in jump
space instead of normal space. I think I might look for another "techie"
word for the particles... if you think tachyon would be inappropriate. Can
you think of anything (other than the generic, "jump particle")?

This is exactly how my system works too. Everything within 1 parsec uses
jump1 worth of fuel. If the jump goes beyond 1 parsec (but not greater than
2 parsecs), it uses to jump 2 worth of fuel (even jump 1.1)

You won\'t.  To the best of my knowledge book 3 was never printed (GDW went out
of business instead).  Books 1 and 2 are decent (better than average for RPG
literature, which isn\'t saying much) but unremarkable.

As I recall, it seems pretty typical of books from small publishers -- decent
paper quality, poor quality cover art, not very good binding.

The killer was actually the rectangular windows; when combined with the
cabin pressure test (which pre-stressed them IIRC) this reduced the time to
fialure from fatigue. I have some notes from 1st and 4th year materials
Science on my Mech Eng Degree somewhere I could dig out if you want a

The Comet still flies and is in limited production, but is known as the

They were abandoned because they weren\'t reliable.  Even without
the Hindenburg and the Akron (and everyone know that if you
used helium you didn\'t have that problem) the problem was that
everytime bad weather hit you would loose a few.

I work at Moffett Airfield and can see the big blimp hanger
the navy built from my office.  They used them for anti-sub
patrols (they launched airplanes from them).  The didn\'t
abandon them because of any scare.  They just had too much
trouble with bad weather.  It was a fundamental problem that
plagues those who talk about using them today....

Well, you wouldn\'t capture the tanks.  You would pay to rent
them and the system you are leaving from then picks them up,
refills them, and rents them again.  Also, if they work
as desribed there is no reason why you have to do it that
way.  You should be able to just string a pipe (or even a cable)
from a jump station.

Loosing jump tankage gains something like a 30% to 100% increase
in cargo space.  It also means that high jump ships can be constructed
by only increasing jump drive size (and jump drives don\'t take
much space).  This means that drop tanks increase revenue by up
to 100% even before you factor in that fact that you can cover
longer distances in 1/3 of the time (assuming most ships are
jump-2 as Far Trader does).  I don\'t see how this can\'t make
a big difference in the economics.  It like taking a ships
and saying you can have six ships at no extra cost....

Except that the TNS entry claimed that they were already

otherwise someone who was making exisiting ones would

This is a very Anglo-American view.  Note even all European contries
have presumption of innocent.  A justice system could be based on
the principle that is doesn\'t presumption that it simply decides
which is most likely (or that its job is to allow _you_ to prove
your innocence) and be seen as legitimate.

You\'re right.  I caught it when I browsing through the last couple digests, 
but after I sent my post.  That does make sense.  Probably what I\'ll do.  
Wasn\'t that your idea?

Regarding the Terrans doing it the "hard way" w/ "displacement mass" would 
make sense too, as Terran gravitic tech was so lacking, compared to the 
Vilani, who would\'ve been able to use their superior gravitics.  Plus, it\'s 
at least a rational reason why the Vilani would bother with jump dimming.  
That and/or have the Vilani jump drives not have an independant reactor, but 
getting it\'s energy from the main power plant.  I\'ll probably do a combo of 
the two for MTU, though Vilani the RoM and 3I would probably be more 
according to Terran/Solomani lines and just practicing a traditional 
exercise.  Has anyone else made any handwaves why the Vilani would practice 
that?

Pah.  Forgiveness?  You\'re far too humble.  :-)  You\'re exactly who I wanted 
to hear from (and the other Far Trader authors, particularly the econo one).  
I\'m big enough to admit I\'m wrong (when I am).  It\'s just David\'s arguments 
that seem particularly lacking (and he\'s the only vocal one I find on that 
side of the fence, though Hans tends towards there, too, i think), to me.

Exactly.  Eminently reasonable and the point i\'ve been trying to make.  An 
excellent analogy.  I\'ve never designed a drop tank equipped ship nor even 
used the stinky gazelle design (most of the stock designs, even in BL, stink. 
 RSB on the other hand, has some good ones...).

Very very interesting.  What is jump masking?

And that wasn\'t a concern that would affect anything.  Despite the debate 
over the effectiveness of drop tanks, the 3I doesn\'t care about the 
perception of the balance of power, as long as it favors them.  If it leads 
to war, it leads to war.  As far as imperial thought is concerned,the Zhos 
are cheats and liars and if it\'s going to happen, it\'s going to happen.  Same 
thing on the Solomani end (substitute fanatic and yahoo for cheat and liar).  
Who else are the Imperials concerned about?  K\'kree?  Hivers?  Vargr?  The 
answer is noone.  Internal trade is the primary purpose of the Imperium.  The 
IN can deal with the other polities.

As Hans has asked, what evidence do you have that such changes are not taking 
place?  The exact timeframe is quite debatable, as Christopher Thrash\'s 
commens on LTA craft bear out.   Just because such isn\'t happening in YTU, 
doesn\'t mean it isn\'t happening in the G:T ATU.

As you have said yourself, there are numerous handwaves for that.  The best 
of which is that the fuel isn\'t guzzled instantly.  It\'s all gone by the end 
of jump, sure, but not instantly.

One of the very authors of Far Trader says it won\'t have the catastrophic 
effect 
you claim.  In fact, I see an interesting discussion in rec.games.frp.gurps 
about 
this very topic where drop tanks are explicitly said to be an option!  Now 
maybe
this person is in error, but if not, I\'m left to wonder why you\'ve left such 
a thing out.  
I\'m going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you\'re not deliberately 
misrepresenting Far Trader, though.

1)  For a backwater.  2) For independant Han Solo types.  3)  (For Trader 
ships) Marginally profitible, niche, craft (except for TNE\'s World Tamer\'s 
Handbook IIRC).  All of which are summarized by "fringe."

What do you base that on?  Your numbers are just much a WAG as mine.  Hans 
is good w/ #s and calculating things, though I don\'t always agree w/ his 
conclusions, at least they have some objectivity there.  What do you say, 
Hans?  How long, assuming no more catastrophic events and/or a public 
backlash against drop
tanks?

Your \'implications\' are far overemphasized and overrated.  You appear to be 
the sole proponet that drop tanks destroy Traveller Economics As We Know It, 
when it\'s becomming clear it\'s not even true for Far Trader!

Well i\'m going off\'ve Behind the Claw here, but it mentions that 1105 was the 
*first* use of drop tanks commercially.  A couple notable disasters, as 
Christopher Thrash has pointed out, would easily push them back decades, and 
is conceivable for centuries.

That was mostly sarcasm, though the basic point remains unchallenged by you.  
Tukera and General have very little economic incentive, when you weigh the 
enormous possiblity for eating those drop tanks.  In fact, they have 
incentive to not convert over (a big stock drop that would be a neon/iridium 
sign for the other megacorps).

Noone, least of all I, have said that.  It will take decades before the 
stigma of drop tanks fades, following a few notable disasters and an enormous 
uncertainty of the true effectiveness of drop tanks (over debates that might 
well have nothing to do with the actual merits or flaws in them).  Why did we 
not see a BB equiped w/ drop tanks in Fighting Ships?  Because it wasn\'t 
explored, like you claim?  Or the Navy planners didn\'t have that much 
confidence is such an expensive platform being possibly so vulnerable to 
loss.  Look at the reputation the Gazelle\'s are said to have (which is a 
design and role flaw rather than a problem w/ drop tanks).  That would not 
lead to confidence in any circle, regardless of the actual merits of drop 
tanks.

> In GT they are suppose to have been in use in the interior

As military.  Recent advances in "capacitor engineering" made it possible.  
Besides the fact that the TNS entry is far from objective (if not an outright 
megacorp PR device).

Sure.  But like you said, solved by numerous handwaves (even if it wasn\'t a 
problem based on a particular model of jump drive, which is hardly 
substantiated by canon).

1 *decade* not 1 year. :-)  I thought that was clear, though I guess I can 
see where u misinterpreted it.

Where are these "powerful interests?"  In the few mentions of the subject, 
there is no mention of concrete supporters of it, but mention of a severe 
stock drop to the parties involved.  That\'s hardly going to make for 
enthusiastic business interests.   There might well be, but htat would be 
your inference for YTU.  Nothing at all comprehensive for the G:T ATU, much 
less the OTU.

One of the authors disagrees with you.  I haven\'t seen it yet, but I\'m 
beginning to believe you\'re misrepresenting it to support your case, though 
I\'ll give u the benefit of the doubt that it\'s unintentional.

And you seem needlessly naysaying something that will have a minimal impact, 
by wringing your hands w/ your own shallow, unconvincing, and clearly 
contrived handwaves and proclaiming the catastrophe that will befall G:T 
economics if they\'re adopted as "official," when in reality it\'s not the

And you lose 2 more weeks (for a J2 despite the fact u\'d need that many more 
drop tanks), in the time you can possibly do the same w/ tanks in your cargo 
hold (inflatable or demountable).  In the same time your competitors have 
made 3 stops.  And one misjump and you\'re done.  Certainly J6 drives are not 
any more viable for merchant craft?  Or are you saying J3 drives will become 
the rage now?

LOL.  Yuck?  ;-)  I mean that some of the first JTAS (#2) TNS entries spoke 
that there were bad things about them.  That they\'re not proven.   The debate 
over something you see as obviously proven effective dates from practically 
the beginning of Traveller.  Real Life.

Laugh from your belly, it\'ll make u a happier person.  Muwahahaha!  Like 
that.  

Game time 12 years, not RL.  If anything is flawed, it might be that.  That 
they\'re in the gazelles for 12 years (gaining the bad reputation that 
characterizes such), gaining the scorn of the IN is believable, though.

LOL.  That\'s relevant how?  Who was the author anyway?  Unless he has the

precisely squat and even then, that far from settles it.  The implication of 
the TNS entry is clear, regardless of the author\'s thoughts on its veracity.

I did misunderstand that, then.  I thought u were saying they would be easier

LOL.  I am pressing your buttons, ain\'t I?  The first line quoted was 
sarcastic.  I guess i should tone it down some, i\'m prone to sarcasm when 
dealing w/ absurdity.
My response probably goes along the lines of "Pot? Kettle?  Nice to meet you."

Any day you\'re feeling froggy enough to tackle Virus w/ me, I\'m here.  It\'s

You can visit rec.games.frp.misc if you want to partake in the perpetual AD&D

That is great progress from the instant destruction of Far Trader you were 
saying earlier.  Keyword is "mostly."  There\'s a whole lot of variation 
possible there, subject to an enormous number of variables and conflicting 
interests.  Then I take this is as an admission than within one, thoroughly 
wrecking economics as we know it, to be either devil\'s advocate or a strawman?

And drop tanks damage that how again?  Your ONLY valid argument is against 
changing the setting which doesn\'t HAVE TO happen w/ the rapidity you seem to 
envision.  It won\'t happen that quickly in ANY TU, IMO.

Well one of the authors seems to disagree that it\'ll have the catastrophic 
effect on even his work, though we have yet to hear from the economics guru 
author.  Hopefully he\'ll speak up and settle the issue on whether drop tanks 
"doom" Far Trader in a way that the other methods they modeled don\'t.

They\'re used as capacitors to control the charge delivery into the jump

True, but I think the problem is that you don\'t realize that just because you
may not find it beliveable, it doesn\'t make it any less likely.

As Haldane(?)   said "The universe is not only stranger than we imagine but
stranger than we _can_ imagine".  IME, this applies as much to the actions of
humans as to the universe itself.

And even if you do find it unbelivebale, so what ?
The whole damn setting is completely unbelievable if you really think about
it.
It\'s almost impossible that a society that far in the future, constructed of
multiple alien and human races with supposedly advanced technology ,would be
remotely recognizable to a twentieth century human. Think about dropping an
Australian Aboriginal tribesman from the 17th C  in the middle of New York

But it being unbelievable doesn\'\'t make it any less fun to play in.

Exactly, and that\'s the way they have always been supposed to work.
There really is no problem with that.

Why not let people use all that energy for weapons ?
Gives them one or two really big shots and then they\'re sitting ducks, unable
to jump out of system.
Sort of like what happens to a sailing-boat armed with an Exocet these days.

Valid weapon for last ditch efforts, but I\'d make it extremely risky unless
the weapon system was _designed_ for such a purpose, as otherwise the power
levels are way too high for normal weapon hardware to handle it, and it\'s
basically a waste of a ship in a real war.

If you want to argue like that, then you must also come up with a convincing
explanation for the lack if bio-tech, the crappy capabilities of TL 15
computers and communications, most of which we already better on Earth now,
and all the other strange lacks and presences that the Traveller universe has
when it comes to technology.

Now, the normal explantion for these things not being around (or still being
around) , is "Vilani conservatism". Apply that to your problem above, and it
is solved.  IF Vilani conservatism is enough to repress or limit development
over millenia whole technologies, it\'s not surprising that the drop-tank isn\'t
spreading like wildfire.

A few "progressive" companies on the edge of the Imperium may be using them on
loose runs in less well-controlled space, but the Imperial Aerospace Authority
haven\'t approved their use at rated starports yet, and based on normal
Imperial bureaucracy times, it\'ll take the committee investigating it decades
to decide on the color of paper they\'ll print their report on, let alone make
a decision on their space-worthiness.

Add the Vilani insurance companies reluctance to insure ships containing any
technology younger than half a century, and  they are not going to change the
Imperium in your lifetime.

Obviously you may find that unbelievable. Which is what the Solomani thought
when they first met the Vilani, so it\'s not very surprising, unless you\'re not
Solomani !

Normal space ain\'t much better. Unlike SF movies and TV the stars

Well, there are a lot of bodies in the solar system, and only
Earth/Luna and Pluto/Charon are "large" and "double". And frankly,
Pluto is small enough to be more like an asteroid. Asteroids seem to
occur in doubles moderately often.

But we are fairly certain how Luna was formed, and it requires a
*really* unlikely event. Basicly a *big* planetismal doing the right
sort of "grazing" impact during the last stages of the formation of the
solar system.

I guess you haven\'t heard. "Dreamland" aka "Site 51" is no more. The

to drive miles past the places where people used to be stopped, all the

Ok, I figured it out after I dug out my copy. I didn\'t bother figuring
the "surface to orbit" times as that gets *really* ugly because you
have to compensate for changing effects of planetary gravity.

The "orbit to 10 diameters" time matches the time for "turnover" trip
of 9 diameters. So assuming that orbit is about 1 diameter (reasonable
kludge), you boost from there to 10 diameters, turning over and
decelerating halfway, and the time checks.

The "time to 100 diameters" matches a *90* diameter "turnover" trip.
That is, start at 10 diameters, boost to 100 diameters, with a turnover
halfway. 

I gues they figure that a ship would rather reach 10 diameters with a
zero velocity in case they need to make a "risky" jump. Me, I\'d just
boost for 100 diameters, and chance having to jump with a non-zero
velocity. 

I\'d calculate it rather differently. If pressed, I\'ll write a program
to generate time/distance/velocity charts for continous boosts from
ground to 100 diameters with and without turnovers at halfway.

Hmmm. It just occured to me that my old "psuedo integration" routines
from 1972 would actually run fast enough to be *useful* on modern
hardware. I\'d still rather have the formulas for determining *real*
orbits, but maybe things will work ok.

The Navy launched airplanes from two zeppelins during the 1930\'s

the flying trapeze". Both were lost in bad weather, and caused the
end of rigid airships in US government use.

Blimps (non-rigid airships), on the other hand, were used extensively
for anti-submarine patrols during WW2. They could loiter on-station
almost indefinitely, could easily outpace a convoy or submerged
submarine, and carried a reasonable load of depth charges.
According to every source I\'ve heard, no convoy under protection of
a blimp ever lost a ship to a sub.

Blimps were also pretty weather-sensitive, but probably not much more
than your average 1940\'s aircraft. A blimp couldn\'t fly in nasty weather,
but no plane that could fly in bad weather back then could fight in it.

I believe the technicalities of it have to do with the relative amounts of
gravitational influence the Earth and Sun have on the Moon. The way I
understand it, the Sun\'s gravity has a far greater influence on the Moon
than the Earth does. Thus the Earth and Moon are really a double planet
system spinning around their centre of mass (which just happens to be
some distance below Earth\'s crust).

Each Imperial Noble is responsible for maintaining Imperial justice in
his or her jurisdiction. Thus in theory all Imperial cases should be heard
by the relevant Imperial Noble. Barons and Counts will only hear cases in
exceptional cases and most Marquises only hear very minor cases; thus
the usual Imperial court of first instance is the Ducal Court. While a Noble
is theoretically allowed to preside over any case themselves, by custom
they defer this to a properly convened court consisting of tribunal of judges.
However, occasionally Nobles will reach into a case and take it over
personally (especially when they want PCs to "do a little job" for them).

Now as I said, by tradition Imperial cases are usually heard by a tribunal
(3 to 11 judges, 5 to 6 being most common). These courts are *not* based
on the Anglo-American common law system and there is no presumption
of innocence (or guilt). The duty of the court is to determine the facts of
the matter, and it is solely their responsibility to do this. This has lots of
interesting implications. For instance IMTU, theoretically only the judges
may question or call witnesses (as they only they are responsible for
determining the facts). Now they may (and usually do) delegate this to a
defence attorney, but they can simply refuse to allow a line of questioning,
cross examination, or even access to a witness. Also there is no "right
of discovery", the defence does not get to see the evidence. Thus, if the
Imperium wants, they can easily stack the deck. The tribunal reaches its
decision by majority and appeals are only by leave (either of the first court,
or the higher one). A desenting opinion by a judge is usually grounds for
an appeal, and by tradition most first appeals are usually granted a hearing.
However, again the Imperium can stack the deck. Second appeals generally
require two desenting opinions or a serious point of law or fact (note here,
the prosecution may appeal an acquittal on an equal basis).

Above the Ducal courts are the Sector Ducal courts, the Archducal courts
and finally the Emperors Court. The Emperors court is actually two courts,
a junior court of 5 to 7 judges and a senior court of the full bench of 11.
Most cases are heard at the Ducal level with appeals to the Sector, but
some serious cases will jump straight to the Sector level with appeal to the
Archducal. There is no Grand Jury or Depositions; if you are charged, you
go to trial.

merchant ship\'s cost.  Under FFS1 & FFS2, it tends to be under 50%.  So the 
economic impact of drop tanks obviously varies somewhat with rules edition.  
What really needs to be done if someone wants to push this discussion 
further is to actually design some drop-tank and non-drop-tank ships and see 
how they stack up.  
     I\'m not going to do that, but let\'s try some back of the envelope 
calculations.  Based on all the designs we did for Far Trader, j-drives and 
cost around 60% and fuel tanks about 20% of a vanilla large J-2 ship.  The 
advantages of drop tanks are that the ship doesn\'t need to carry it\'s fuel 
tanks with it into j-space and can therefore reduce j-drive capacity 
accordingly, and that it can share the cost of fuel tanks with several other 
ships.  For a constant volume of cargo, a J-2 ship using drop tanks can 
reduce j-drive and fuel tank capacity (hence cost) by 20%. Since these two 
components make up 80% of the cost of the ship we see a (.8*.2=.16) 16% drop 
in ship price.  That\'s not huge but it is enough to make a big difference 
commercially. The cost advantage also goes up with jump number.
	There are some problems with drop tanks for shipping lines.  First of 
all, each system that is going to be served by drop-tank ships must be 
equipped with a system of delivering them to incoming ships, recovering 
them, refueling them, etc.  This is likely to resemble LASH operation in 
complexity.  Given the need for lots of port-side overhead and the greatest 
cost advantage being on high-jump ships, drop tanks would likely make their 
first appearance on x-boat routes.  
	Pushing the use of drop tanks out beyond the x-boat routes becomes 
much more problemmatic.  If you look at nearly any multi-jump trade route in 
the Marches, there is at least one very poor starport world along the way.  
For drop-tank liners to be feasible, each and every one of these worlds 
would have to have their facilities upgraded to be able to handle the demand 
for drop-tank service from every ship passing through.  This is likely to be 
expensive and take a lot of time.  It may not even make sense in a lot of 
places.  Note also that the cost savings for drop tanks only happen when 
ships are redesigned to take advantage of the technology.  Since Traveller 
ships can have a useful life-time of _minimum_ 40 years, and very likely at 
least twice that, it will be some time before enough ships could possibly be 
retired to make room for new drop tank ships.  Finally, the large 
investments in fixed facilities means that it becomes even harder to shift 
capacity from one route to another since doing so means over-loading the 
drop-tank facilities on one route and idling them on another.  The need to 
maintain conventional ships that can switch from route to route or surplus 
drop-tank ship capacity will erode the cost savings of a commercial drop 
tank fleet.
	All in all, drop tank ships do provide a significant cost savings but 
it is likely not large enough to introduce them off x-boat and main routes.  
In any case, it will take decades for them to phased in.

Almost.  The de Havilland Comet 1 crashes were  caused  by  metal
fatigue cracks spreading from a rivet hole around the two ceiling
mounted windows (approx  25%  along  from  aircraft  nose).  This
caused the pressurised cabin to explode.  Two parallel  lines  of
inquiry uncovered this cause:

First, two-thirds of the initial crash plane was recovered by the
Royal Navy and reassembled (the water was too deep at the  second
crash site).

Second, another Comet was put in a tank, with its wings  sticking
out.  Jacks bent the wings,  while  water  was  pumped  into  the
fuselage to create strains equal to thousands of hours flying.

Many years ago (using the HG rules) I designed a  ship  that  did
just that: the Panther class experimental ship was  1000dt,  jump
capable, and had a 100dt Meson gun  bay  that  could  fire  every
alternate turn.  The use of jump  capacitors  effectively  halved
the \'per turn\' power requirement of the Meson gun.  The HG  rules
covering jump capacitors in relation to  Black  Globe  generators
seems to support this possibility  ...  the  question  becomes  a
tactical trade-off between  more  (and  smaller)  ships  carrying
Meson guns versus those Meson guns only firing half as often.  In
general it is not cost effective and thus IMTU the Panther  class
was never commissioned in number.

The AAB is listed in the MT Imperial Encyclopedia as a \'major scientific
institution  on Vland, collecting samples, specimens and recorded materials
from all over known space.\' The IE also mentions the AAB in the same breath as
the Imperial Library as major libraries of the imperium. I do not know if it\'s
been more thoroughly documented anywhere in canon. (Sionce I don\'t have Vilani
& Vargr or Aliens:Vilani) The M0 description is longer than any I\'ve seen.

At a guess, it is probably the greatest source of research materials in the
Imperium, as it\'s been in operation for millenia, longer than any other
institution, certainly longer than any 3I institution. Think the British
Museum, the Smithsonian Museum, the Library of Congress, the Vatican Musem,
The Library at Alexandria (had it never burned) and all the other museums in
the world rolled into one.

A lot of materials were lost in the Long Night in various branches. Presumably
by 1120 most of those have been investigated and what recoverable materials
are left have been recovered. Most likely the vast bulk of that material will
have been transported back to Vland for safekeeping.

The MT encyclopedia also mentions that they sell a 15 holocrystal version of
\'The Encyclopedia\' "which holds the equivalent of 7500 extensively illustrated
volumes, yet can easily fit in a pocket" (Drool drool!)

Heh heh.  Ross Coburn and I are probably the only people on this list who
actually *do* know what "Spofulam" means, or at least, where it comes from.
And I think Ross is currently off the TML. Which I guess leaves only me.

Hmmm. Should I leave you hanging? Nah, I suppose that would be cruel...

When Roderick Darroch Elliot (we just call him "Darroch" -- pronounced
"Derick") was introduced to Traveller by Ross, Darroch\'s first character
was a pilot with a long, five-part name, the initials of which happened to
be S.P.I.F.F.  Yep, he was playing "Spaceman SPIFF".

Then, Ross made a mistake that would prove fatal to untold millions of
sophonts: he let Darroch borrow his copy of FFS.  Mad genius that he is,
Darroch took to the gun-design sequence  like a feline tasting catnip, and
soon the TML was filled with his twisted yet entirely FFS-compliant
riot-discouraging devices, and tailfinned chome-and-pink starships, and
gravitic pogo sticks, and things even more unspeakable.  All proudly
announced by Hengibar, patriarch of the now-infamous Famille Spofulam.
"Spofulam" being, I guess, Darroch\'s pseudo-Latinization of, you got it,
"Spiff".

And now that Darroch\'s a lawyer at Canada\'s oldest law firm, no doubt he\'ll
sue my butt to the wall for spilling the beans. But he\'s off the list, so
what he don\'t know...

Here\'s a sample of how the man\'s brain works. Back in December, Ross posted
the following to Darroch and myself, after one of our Traveller sessions:

Ross:

Darroch\'s reply:

Interesting idea.  My analysis so far has been abstract and from a Milieu 0

Why not just say that it\'s much more likely that members of the Imperial
Aristocracy are Travellers than bakers, or farmers or used-car salesman.
After all in the Seventeenth century you were much more likely to find a
nobleman among the colonist in Jamestown or among the European Fleets in the
new world than you were to find one in rural France or the in the villages
of the Italian Alps.
A Baron who has income from an estate or business interests is much more
likely to be Travelling offworld than a working stiff with a family.  Many
children of the nobility, who may hold courtesy rank of their own are also
likely to be travelling, either on the Grand Tour or simply to be out from
underfoot (see Remittance Man [GT]).

Who are the judges?

Some interesting ideas, but I suspect that there would be very little litigation
in YTU.

And I can\'t really agree with the idea of no depositions.  Thats how a great
deal of investigative work gets done, at least in a society with lots of civil
rights.  And its nothing more answering questions under oath, i.e., penalties
for lying.

The oversized Mayday was an updated version that came out just after the
Starter Traveller boxed set--when GDW was publishing the 8.5x11 boxed
adventures Beltstrike and Tarsus, The Spinward Marches Campaign, and the
Alien Modules.

The original Mayday was in small book format, then this updated 8.5x11
version came out--but it had it\'s own box and didn\'t come in a bag.

I\'ve always assumed that the drops the tanks part was apocryphacal, since it
never appeared in any other OTU source.  I haven\'t used drop tanks in any
game I\'ve played or GM\'d in years. But...when we did use them we only used
them to extend the range of the ships between fuelling.
Do it like so. Figure out the total displacement of the ship and drop tanks
and use that to calculate the maximum jump. The ship jumps with the drop
tanks.  After the jump the drop tanks are empty. Drop them. You now have a
lower displacement ship with the same Jump Engines. If the tanks are big
enough the displacement difference might give greater range on the next
Jump, if not you still have the advantage of being able to more quickly jump
again without having to refuel.  Also good for areas where the distance
between systems are greater than 2 or 3 parsecs.

This is exactly how I use them.  I believe this is the TNE way as well.
Likewise, I think that the only thing that drop tanks prove is that the original
designer didn\'t think about the consequences when he published it.  In any case,
drop tanks are directly analogous to multistage rockets.

And they were "unreliable" because they were woefully underpowered for
their size, due to the power-to-weight ratio of the motors available at the
time. This would not be such a problem today.

In fact, the Graf Zeppelin had such a long range that she could fly
completely around bad weather most of the time, and still arrive on schedule.

Moreover, the current loss rate for surface shipping is something like 2-3%
of total hulls *per year* -- everytime bad weather hits we lose a few. But
no one complains that surface ships are unreliable.

Someone has to capture them, so you will pay for the service either way. 

[By the way, High Guard says (p. 16), "Such tanks must be replaced each
time they are used," which could be read as they are completely disposable.
But I agree with your interpretation.]

The latest information I have from Marc Miller on jump drives strongly
implies that jump stations will not work:

"Jump cannot take place within 100 diameters of body (star, gas giant,
world, planetoid, or even another ship) larger than itself." [He goes on
later to discuss misjumps from inside 100D, so it\'s not an absolute
prohibition the way breakout is.]

Thus drop tanks will work, as long as they are smaller than the ship
itself, but jump stations (which are presumably larger than a ship) are an
invitation to misjump.

Let\'s put some hard numbers to this. I\'ll take the Tukera 3,000-dton
freighter (FT, p. 139, or The Traveller Adventure, p. 138) and convert it
to a drop tank configuration using GT/VE2 rules. I\'m only trying to
increase the cargo capacity right now: replacing ships on existing runs
would be the first step, with longer legs coming later.

Drop tanks are covered on VE2 p. 94-95, under Hardpoints. The first
interesting point is  a limit on the size of drop tanks, based (ultimately)
on the surface area of the vessel and the weight of the tanks. The actual
figures depend on the configuration of the drop tanks themselves (more on
that in a moment), but are generally:

Tonnage	Max Jump (from drop tanks alone)
100		6
200		6
300		6
400		6
600		5
800		5
1000		5
1200		4
2000		3
3000		3
4000		2
5000		2
10000		1
15000		1
20000		1
30000		1
50000		1
100000		0

So our 3,000-dton freighter can only get Jump-3 from drop tanks; the other
Jump-1 has to be carried internally. This is still an improvement. The
revised design is:

	Design: 3,000-dton USL Hull, DR 100, Hardpoints for 3 400-ston pods,
Command Bridge, Engineering, 135 Maneuver, 150 Jump, 300 Jump Fuel, 5 Low
Berth (capacity 20), 25 Staterooms, Sickbay, 6 Utility, Vehicle Bay
(100-dton Shuttle), 10 Turrets (two armed with one 360 Mj laser, one
missile rack and one sandcaster each), 2,184.5 Cargo (+24 in turrets), 25
Spacedock/Hangar (included in cargo hold).
	Statistics: EMass 2,614.9 stons, LMass 13,537.4 stons, LMass (w/tanks)
14,737.4. Cost (w/o tanks): MCr 639.2. 120,000 hit points. PD 4, Hull Size
Modifier +11.
	Performance: Jump-4 with drop tanks, Jump-1 without; 0.92g/1.00g/5.16g
(tanks/loaded/empty).

Cargo hold goes from 1,312.5 to 2,184.5 -- an increase of 66%. Crew
increases by one drive hand.

The drop tanks themselves have to be designed as pods; they require
structure, but not armor. This is in keeping with CT and the vulnerability
of drop tanks to damage. Military vessels would require armored drop tanks,
which will restrict the values on the table above even further. 

The freighter requires 900 dtons of drop tank. I\'ll use three of the
300-dton hulls from GT:Star Mercs (p. 67) and 300 jump fuel modules each:
400 stons and MCr 50.4 per tank. Note that this is significantly more
expensive than High Guard (MCr 0.3 each). They will rent for Cr50,400 per
day, or Cr2,100 per hour each (total Cr6,300 per hour).

We will need a tug to chase after the freighter, catch the expended drop
tanks, and carry them back to be refilled and reused. Rather than design a
separate tug, I will use the 800-dton tug from FT p. 138, which rents for
Cr6,336 per hour. We will also need a crew to service and reattach the
tanks, which I will treat as containerized cargo handling: Cr3,600 total.

Using the same model we used to arrive at the actual per dton per jump
costs in FT, it turns out that the drop-tank freighter saves about 22% over
the cost of the original (the actual numbers involve variables and
assumptions that are not pertinent here). This is significant but hardly
dominant: it does not even bring the cost of Jump-4 (express) service down
to the level of ordinary Jump-2/3 freight. The tradeoff, as with LASH
operations, is additional complexity. Note also that this presupposes that
the fixed base portions (tugs, crews, tanks) are constantly in use; if
there is too little traffic for this, their cost goes up enormously.

As John Macpherson pointed out, drop tanks are a highly specialized system,
largely restricted to main trade routes by the requirement for on-orbit
servicing capabilities. The limitations imposed by GURPS rules further
reduce their utility, especially for large vessels, both commercial and
military.

Fair enough. I\'ll have to defer that argument until I get my copy of Far

Certainly. I agree completely. You\'d expect to see jump-6 drop liners
jumping between Rhylanor and Mora (via Heroni), for instance. But how many
places have you seen described in adventures and other writeups where it is
actually ODD that they aren\'t mentioned?

Like who? What I\'m asking for are canonical examples.

Sure. If my players ever needed to get from Mora to Rhylanor and didn\'t
have a ship, they\'d be travelling by drop liner. That\'s IMTU. But what
EVIDENCE do you have that they wouldn\'t do the same in the OTU?

>What happens there?  Does it eliminate piracy like Ian (?) claims?

Let\'s not go there, right? Since I believe piracy would be almost non-
existent WITHOUT drop stations, I don\'t think it would be a good idea
for us to reopen that line of argument, do you? ;-)

The only adventure I recall where either Oberlindes or GS hired any PCs,
Oberlindes did it because they had a ship.

No. GS got dumped from the drop liner project because of quality control
issues.

No. Why should it be? If anything, warfare is one of the factors that
count against drop stations, since they are more vulnerable to raids.

The Sword Worlds don\'t need a new reason to WANT to take back the border
worlds, and they don\'t have the strength to do it with or without the
existence of drop tanks.

Most PCs operate between systems where drop freight service is not
available.

Agreed. That\'s why I want the questions explored. If I could think of

a paste-on), I\'d like to write it.

They\'re not alone in that. The MT material is pretty explicit on that
point without mentioning drop tanks at all.

While I suspect that Jim and Christopher underestimate the potential impact
of drop tanks, I\'m positive that you are overestimating it. For one thing,
the increase in capacity is not a factor six. For another, the increase is
only useful if you have a route with enough traffic so that you can utilize
the increase in capacity. And thirdly, long distance trade goes from being
cheapest PER PARSEC with jump-3 to jump-6, but getting something from six
parsecs away is still going to be more expensive than getting it from one
parsec away. So the greatest number of ships are still going to be jump-1
and jump-2 where the impact is least.

No, no, Gary, it\'s only when you\'re WRONG that I\'m on the opposite side of

>Very very interesting.  What is jump masking?  
 
The change in jump mechanics that makes any solid object between the two
end points of a jump (in real space) force the ship to precipitate out at
the object. Until Far Trader a ship ignored all such and only had to worry
about the 100 diameter limit of the departure and destination world.

It would depend on a lot of assumptions, though they would all boil down
to the same questions: 1) How much time would it cost a ship to mount
drop tanks when it arrives in a new system, and 2) How much will it
increase the per ton cost of fuel? This will IMO give you a number of
systems (the low-traffic ones) where drop tank service will never
outperform ordinary service. Then you have to consider how much the
loss of flexibility will affect the issue (and I find it difficult to
imagine just how you would establish that). Finally you\'d have a period
of time where no new normal ships were being build, but where those that
already exist will still be competing.

_Behind the Claw_ is wrong. Not only does the TNS newsbrief David refer to
specifically state that drop tanks has been in operation in the interior,
but simple logic will tell you that if Tukera planned to extend drop liner
service TO Regina, then it must have somewhere to extend it FROM. (Which,
incidentally, provides us with a problem, because the nearest system
likely to already have drop liners is Rhylanor, and Rhylanor is more than
six parsecs from Regina. Logically there ought to be a system in between
where the liner can get drop tanks; unfortunately there\'s no suitable
system with a Class A or B starport in between the two. So apparently
Tukera must have been shipping drop tanks to some system in between, which
can\'t help but increase the cost. Still, it\'s a minor problem). 

>A couple notable disasters, as Christopher Thrash has pointed out, would

I have to agree with David here. Drop tanks would, IMO, grow rapidly along
certain trade routes. I just don\'t agree with him that it\'s a problem.

>Why did we not see a BB equiped w/ drop tanks in Fighting Ships?

Real life explanation: Because the authors didn\'t think of it.
In-game explanation: Because _Fighting Ships_ didn\'t contain more than a
small fraction of all designs.
Alternate real life explanation: Because _Shattered Ships of the Fighting
Imperium_ stank. (Note: This last is hearsay. Same hearsay is why I never
bought the book, which I guess is also why it is still hearsay ;-)

Last year when Marc was selling the \'grab bags\' of material, one of the things
in mine was a bagged copy of Mayday. I just figured that they ran out of boxes
first in the print run.

Ack!  Are you saying that now a ship has to plot a linear course, which does
not intersect with any other body?  (Including other ships, comets,
asteroids, etc?)  I would think that this would be extraordinarily difficult
to do, BTW.

If so, is this to be part of Traveller canon, or is it an optional rule?

But as I\'ve pointed out several times, the various adventures and
supplements makes it just as likely that bakers, farmers, and used-car
salesmen are Imperial nobles. Or if not those, then doctors, bureaucrats,
soldiers, sailors, and others.

But how likely were you to find a king or an emperor? Or even just princes?
No doubt there were some (princes, I mean, not kings and emperors), but I
don\'t think it quite amounted to 3%. You see, that\'s one of the problems
with the fact that Imperial noblemen have titles that LOOKS like those we
are familiart with from history. But an Imperial Marquis is often a world
ruler. That\'s more powerful than any man in the history of Earth has ever
been. How many of those would you expect to run into in your average days\'
travelling?

But how many of them are likely to be serving as enlisted men or customs

It\'s GURPS.  Everything is optional.

However, IIRC, it\'s based on things Marc Miller has published in JTAS, so
it\'s at least semi-canonical.  In general, it seems that you can ignore
objects in interstellar space, and ignore relatively small objects.  Far
Trader only calculates jump masking for system primaries, I believe.

Description/Notes
I designed this ship with Andrew Akins spreadsheet.
The Archer Class is designed entirely with beam weapons for missile defense
and suppression.  Her Barbettes may be fired independantly, and each have a
dedicated MFD for increased range and accuracy.  The beam weapons also
require less supply support, so the Archer should be suitable for extended
missons.  (I tweaked the lasers and armor for best results under Brilliant
Lances, so the T4 numbers are a bit off...)
The Archer\'s Meson weapon, along with her Laser Bays, should give her a
significant punch against other ships in her size range.

Not really.  An Azhanti High Lightening (for example), is about 400 meters
long (per Supplement 5).  If we use this figure as the effective diameter
of the ship (a very conservative estimate) ships must have a 40 km
separation for a safe jump.  In space, this is next to nothing.  A single
30,000 km Brilliant Lances hex or 16,000 km GT hex could contain literally
hundreds of ships at this interval, However, they won\'t bunch up this
closely in a normal fleet formation.  I\'d expect typical separations in the
hundreds if not thousands of km.

Nope.  Both the first and second one\'s were published.

Not wanting to start a war here but think carefully about what you said there.  Did
Tolkien publish The Two Towers first?  Did Empire Strikes Back come out first?  No,
no one publishes the second book of a trilogy first...  Doesn\'t make sence.

Be careful of the examples you use...the _entire_ Star Wars Trilogy is the
second of a series of trilogies.  The new Stars Wars movie(s) take place
before the second set.   (That\'s why they\'re being called "prequels.")  So
whether or not it makes sense, sometimes the second (movie/book) _is_
presented first.

In short, yes.

The canonical misjump throws the ship anywhere between 1 and 36 parsecs in
a random direction.  Time dialation is also a common problem, with jumps
lasting much longer than the usual 168 hours.

Mis-jumps are yours to play with.

JUMPING
Jump allows a ship to travel faster than the speed of light by entering 
jumpspace. Ships in jumpspace are completely out of communication with the 
common universe, or with other ships in jumpspace.

BASIC PERFORMANCE
	Jump takes time, energy, and the appropriate drive.
	Jump Ranges. The jump drives for a ship determine how far it can 
jump. Jump capacity can range from 1 to 6 (which is possible range in 
parsecs). A ship can make a jump equal to or less than its jump capacity. A 
ship with Jump-1 can travel one parsec in about a week; a ship with jump-6 
can travel six parsecs in about a week.
	Jump Time. All jumps take about a week: 168 hours plus or minus about 
10%. Time spent in jump has no relation to the distance travelled.
	Equivalent Speed. A ship which jumps one parsec in one week travels 
170 times the speed of light.

	Jump	Approximately:
	1	160 to   180 x speed of light
	2	320 to   360 x
	3	480 to   540 x
	4	640 to   720 x
	5	800 to   900 x
	6	960 to 1000 x

	Astrogation. A jump must be planned before it is executed; this 
planning is the duty of the astrogator. Planning a jump involved plotting a 
straight line course from the jump point to the breakout point.
	Restrictions. Jump cannot take place within 100 diameters of body 
(star, gas giant, world, planetoid, or even another ship) larger than itself.
	If a plotted course intersects a 100 diameter sphere around any 
object larger than the ship, the ship is "precipitated out" of jump space.
	In System Jumps. It is possible to jump within a star system: The 
jump still takes a week (168 hours or so). In some cases, the jump is more 
efficient than using maneuver drive.

JUMP POINTS
	The location at which a ship enters jump space is called a Jump 
Point. There are technically an infinite number of Jump Points, but some are 
more efficient that others. Jump Points must meet certain criteria.
	Outside the 100 Diameter Sphere. A jump point must be at least 100 
diameters from every astral body (star, planet, gas giant, planetoid, or 
other object).
	In Vacuum/ Space. By inference, a jump point which is outside the 100 
diameter sphere is in vacuum.	

BREAKOUT
	A ship may exit jump space in two ways: at or near the point planned 
for, or at a point where the straight line course crosses a 100 diameter 
sphere.
	The Planned Breakout Point. The course plotted by the Astrogator may 
include a predicted point for breakout. A successful jump will carry a ship 
to that predicted breakout point within about 100,000 km. Breakout points are 
commonly used in naval operations when maneuvers take ships to locations 
relatively removed from astral bodies.

	Natural Safeguards. The physics of jump space force a ship out of 
jump space when it crosses the 100-Diameter Sphere. As a result, a ship 
cannot exit jump space within a world, planetoid, star, or even another ship.

WHAT IS OUTSIDE THE SHIP?
	Jump space reflects an alternative universe in which the laws of 
physics are vastly different from those of the common universe. The jump 
drive forces the ship into that universe (where it can travel greater 
distances in less time) but it also protects the ship and its interior from 
those alien laws of physics.
	Jump space is destructive to matter and deadly to life.

FOR SIMPLICITY
	In most cases, a jump can be described as a successful movement from 
one star system to another. It takes about a week. Travel from the StartWorld 
to the Jump Point takes about a day; travel from the Jump Point to the 
DestinationWorld also takes about a day.
	Only if circumstances require should the details of jump be 
implemented.

TIME TO BREAKOUT
	A typical jump takes about a week (168 hours). The actual time spent 
is random. Military ships can take slightly less time on average.
	Squadron Maneuvers. Highly tuned drives in a squadron of ships, along 
with highly trained crews, can make their emergence from jump very close to 
the same time (within about a 5 hour window).

DETECTION
	Ships entering and leaving jump space can be detected.
	Entering Jump: A ship entering jump disappears from detector screens. 
There is a pulse of energy which is detectable to PRadar. 
	Leaving Jump. A ship leaving jump emits a pulse of energy which is 
detectable to PRadar.
	In Jump: A ship in jump cannot be detected. A ship in jump is 
incapable of detecting anything also in jump, or outside of jump.

JUMP ASTROGATION
	The Astrogators responsibility is to determine a usable course and 
to plot it with the help of the ships computer. All calculation takes place 
before the jump begins.

BASIC PROCEDURE
	Astrogation procedures depend on a task for successful completion of 
the Astrogation task.

To plot a Jump (12 hours)
Edu + Astrogation < Formidable (3D)
Uncertain (3D).
Requires ships computer.

	Astrogation tasks may be performed as Cautious; Hasty, or Extra Hasty.
	Astrogation Failure. Astrogation failure causes a misexit from jump. 
Roll on the Misexit column of the Jump Mishap Effects table when the ship 
emerges from jump. It emerges at a random location at the 100D Sphere of a 
gas giant, world, or planetoid between the start point and the intended 
destination.

 JUMPING
	When a jump is attempted, the game master rolls 4D privately.
	Operational Faults. Jump drive or power plant failure, or jump within 
the 100 diameter sphere can cause a misjump. Roll on the Misjump column of 
the Jump Mishap Effects table when the ship emerges from jump.

MISJUMPS
	A misjump occurs when the drive fails during the jump process, or 
when a jump is attempted within the 100 diameter sphere around a body.
	No Jump. The jump does not take place. The drive fails to engage. 
Everyone involved knows immediately.
	Misdirected Jump. The ship emerges from jump space in an unintended 
location, usually far in distance and location from the intended exit point 
(this differs from a misexit).

 JUMP EFFECTS
	4D	Effect

  So use beamed power: As long as the reciever equipment is 
smaller than a jump drive it is still a gain.

I wrote:

I\'ve always assumed that the drops the tanks part was apocryphacal, since it
never appeared in any other OTU source.  I haven\'t used drop tanks in any
game I\'ve played or GM\'d in years. But...when we did use them we only used
them to extend the range of the ships between fuelling.
Do it like so. Figure out the total displacement of the ship and drop tanks
and use that to calculate the maximum jump. The ship jumps with the drop
tanks.  After the jump the drop tanks are empty. Drop them. You now have a
lower displacement ship with the same Jump Engines. If the tanks are big
enough the displacement difference might give greater range on the next
Jump, if not you still have the advantage of being able to more quickly jump
again without having to refuel.  Also good for areas where the distance
between systems are greater than 2 or 3 parsecs.

I later went looking for some old game materials that I\'d put away a decade
or so ago and found that I was mistaken about some of the details of my
post.  We used the numbers of J-4 with tanks, using only the fuel in the
tanks, J-5 using both the tanks and the internal tanks and J-2 with only the
internal tanks and no drop tanks. In all cases we assumded that the tanks
made the jump.

This is true and something you don\'t need to remind me of.  I\'ve been waiting since
1977 to see these movies...  22 years is a looooong time to wait for some movies...

The Black Curtian is the ultimate "Here be Dragon\'s" sign on a map.  According to the
book it\'s a kind of "event horizion" which roughly follows the boarders of Lucan\'s zone
of control immediately before the collapse.  It\'s an event horizon because nothing that
goes in ever comes out...

In 1201 the starting date for most PC\'s only the Hub Worlds are likely to know of it\'s
existance, so if you\'re running a Pocket Empire campaign, a Reformation Coalition
campaign or a Regency Campaign don\'t get to worried about it, it doesn\'t come into play
really until about 1208.  Then all hell breaks loose.  8^)

What\'s behind the curtian.  Well, that\'s somewhat of a controversy.  Given the evidence
we have we know.  The Kkree are involved somehow...  The Puppetter strain is involved
and I beleive is likely a carefully bred virus by the Kkree.  It seems to follow in
with their slaved computer systems quite nicely.

This is really a better question to ask on the TNE-RCES list.  You might also want to

There was _High Guard_. That\'s as canonical as anything else I can think of.

 Funny, because I also have one in this form. The only date I found is 1978.

GC

The Official Price Guide to Role-Playing Games by Timothy Brown and Tony Lee
 list three versions of Mayday.
A ziplocked bag version from 1978
A boxed version from 1980 and a larger boxed version from 1983.
All three are listed with the same contents.
Lawrence Schick\'s Heroic Worlds only lists Mayday as a sidenote without details

What are the GT statistics for the unmodified version (I have no idea how

Why should that be an issue? For a ship designed to sometimes carry its
drop tanks along with it, yes, but drop liners and freighters will never
need to go full throttle with drop tanks attatched, so I would think the
tanks could be any size.

I\'d say it is. Why is it so expensive?

Could you also let me have the statistics for the tug? And why do you need
an 800 T tug to manhandle a 300 T tank?

covers trade in as much detail as you could want, with lots of good ideas. 

I have been trying to make the Far Trader economics work for a Beowulf Free
Trader, but cannot get the figures to come out anywhere near a profit.

I tried to work out the income & expenditure for a single jump, with 100% load,
and came up with:

Income per jump:

  3 High Passengers:   3*1750   = 10.5 KCr
  6 Middle Passengers: 6*1750   = 10.5 KCr
  20 Low Passengers:   20*175   =  3.5 KCr
  63.5 DT of Freight:  63.5*700 = 44.5 KCr

Expenditure per jump:

  Mortgage = 58 KCr
  Salaries =  5 KCr
  Fuel     =  2 KCr
  Maintenance
   contribution = 1 KCr
  Berthing = 20 KCr
  Sundries = 1 KCr

Assumptions:
  24 jumps year.
  Unarmed.
  Mortgage = 240th ships cost per month.
  12.5 DT of cargo space taken up by passengers and crew baggage.

So   Income per Jump = 69 KCr
Expenditure per Jump = 87 KCr

This makes a loss of 20% per jump, and doesn\'t become profitable until you do 35
jumps a year, which is impractical.

What am I missing?

I certainly don\'t like spheres, they aren\'t nearly as neat as normal ships.
 Unfortunately, they make so much sense.....  And yes, a geodesic is
probably even better, and certainly easier to manufacture...

Don\'t try and claim the other side is inflexible in a

you have _no_ evidence that you are any more flexible.
That leaves such claims as nothing more than hypocritical
attempts to smear the other person\'s judgment.

If you are engaging in a debate, and you don\'t change sides
of course you find the other person\'s arguements lacks.  He
must clearly find yours lacking also.  The main result
is that this comments can only serve as an attempt to
depricate the other persons posts.

How posts comes and goes, especially on subject that have been
discussed before.  Add in the this the fact that you can easily
have vocal minorities

Just because you had 2 or 3 of people who post something to
support you does give you the right to dismiss the ideas of
others.  It is arrogant and you hurt yourself by closing
you mind to new ideas.

Not at all. If you don\'t want to use jump-masking IYTU, simply
rule that all ships arriving/leaving a system jump above or
below the ecliptic, based on the position of the planetary
body\'s relative to the ecliptic. A few systems will contain
an eccentric orbit which can affect the jump but you can
always handle this with the random travel time roll.

He also mentioned that he didn\'t write the section in question.  It

Making them an optional rule is exactly how I think they should
be handled.  As to how they affect Free Trader, maybe the
author was able to see a simple systematic change that would
allow the person to be able to change a fundamental aspect of
the book in a simple and systemtatic manner, if so, more
power to him.  (Though it will still mean that the drop
tanks are in variance with the setting as portrayed in the
book).

Good idea.  Even better would have been to not raise the issue
and then pretend you aren\'t so you can get a little accusation
in without taking responsibility.   That is the sort of thing
I\'m talking about in my previous post.

I was a playtester for Free Trader.  However, I don\'t have a
copy yet.  That passage was added afterwards.

It based on the fact that it doesn\'t take decades to fix
quality control problems, esp on items that have already been
shown to be in manufacture else where.

Also, unless drop tanks are the kind of drastic change you want,
pushing them 10 years into the future is a mistake.  It is
not that unusual for a timeline to be advanced that much
(either by a GM or in a published setting).

Hans has posted before that it does.  Just because you don\'t see

number of posts indicate how correct an arguement is.

I\'m going off of the actual TNS entries.  To quote...
"    L-Hyd drop ships have only been in service for the last dozen
     years in the interior"

As to centuries?  Why?  If they are in use elsewhere, then the
problems can\'t be that fundamental.  As the example of the comet
jet showed, such technologies will be used if possible.

General Ship yards will be making and selling the things and you
don\'t see they have any incentive for pushing them?
(Wasn\'t it you who claimed that the TNS entry was part hype on
their part to do just that?)

The examples seen show otherwise.  The Hindenberg did _not_ doom
blimb traffic, the comet did not push jet planes back a decade.
Even if the general public was scared of them, it wouldn\'t hold
them back since they can still be used for cargo, military,
scouting, etc. purposes.

I don\'t follow this at all.  Aside from the issue of risk (see
above), why do drop tanks ships loose two weeks?  Getting jump-6
cheaply is certainly quite viable for merchants.  If it doesn\'t
have to carry fuel, a Free Trader can carry 30% more fuel
and still be able get jump 6, getting cargos to destination
in 1/6 the time.  This will increase revenues 650%.

No.  It didn\'t.  It said there was one problem with them once.
It mentioned quality control.  As I pointed out, they are also
presented as being in use for over a decade and no rules for
danger from them have been presented.  The entry certainly did

fundamentally bad about them.

From where I stand, a war can really affect PCs.  It will also

Making them an optional rule is exactly how I think they should

be handled.  As to how they affect Free Trader, maybe the

author was able to see a simple systematic change that would 

allow the person to be able to change a fundamental aspect of

the book in a simple and systemtatic manner, if so, more

power to him.  (Though it will still mean that the drop

tanks are in variance with the setting as portrayed in the

book).

Good idea.  Even better would have been to not raise the issue

and then pretend you aren\'t so you can get a little accusation

in without taking responsibility.   That is the sort of thing

I\'m talking about in my previous post.


I was a playtester for Free Trader.  However, I don\'t have a

copy yet.  That passage was added afterwards.

>What do you base that on?  Your numbers are just much a WAG as mine. 


It based on the fact that it doesn\'t take decades to fix

quality control problems, esp on items that have already been

shown to be in manufacture else where.


Also, unless drop tanks are the kind of drastic change you want,

pushing them 10 years into the future is a mistake.  It is

not that unusual for a timeline to be advanced that much 

(either by a GM or in a published setting).

Hans has posted before that it does.  Just because you don\'t see

people posting doesn\'t mean they don\'t exist.  Nor does the

number of posts indicate how correct an arguement is.

I\'m going off of the actual TNS entries.  To quote...

"    L-Hyd drop ships have only been in service for the last dozen

     years in the interior"


As to centuries?  Why?  If they are in use elsewhere, then the

problems can\'t be that fundamental.  As the example of the comet

jet showed, such technologies will be used if possible.

General Ship yards will be making and selling the things and you

don\'t see they have any incentive for pushing them?

(Wasn\'t it you who claimed that the TNS entry was part hype on

their part to do just that?)

The examples seen show otherwise.  The Hindenberg did _not_ doom

blimb traffic, the comet did not push jet planes back a decade.

Even if the general public was scared of them, it wouldn\'t hold

them back since they can still be used for cargo, military,

scouting, etc. purposes.

That is what I go with also.  And that is a good description.
Since it keep and energy
based effect, it rationalizes thing like lanthanum grids/coils,
how antimatter/jump projectors/Annic Nova/etc. work, and
why there is an energy signature (and no mass signature)
when you jump more simply.  It means you don\'t have to rationalize
why it is called jump fuel (it because you are using it as fuel :-).
I also is more consitent with a the need depending on the
volume (if it were mass based, it should depend on surface
area).

I rationalize it a bit more.  Mine is that the reason you can
get "i" instead of "ii" is that the lanthanum grid or coil
becomes anchored in jump space, which makes it an effectively
infinit sink at absolute zero, early in the process.  Someone
else speculated that you create as singularity and that where
you get to put the energy.

It is not "completely" unbelievable.  There is a rule that,
in fiction, you get a suspension of disbelief where the
audience will accept something that is not possible as
possible to set up the premise of the story or settings.

However, you get to do this once, and in a limited manner.
If you keep doing it, you damage suspension of disbelief
and the whole thing become "hokey".  In your example, the
audience would accept that dropping an Australian Aberiginal
from the past in NY because it is an interesting situation.
However, if in the middle of the story it you arbitrarily told
them, "this also means he can turn invisible" you would damage
the suspension of disbelief.

After someone mentioned this, the more fiction I saw (good and
bad) the more true I realized this is.  It is one of the classic
mistakes that is made in rpg settings.

I\'ve argued this position in the past, I can not tell Hans that
I admit that I was wrong :-).  The problem is that; having
the choice can be a big deal, you can get a _lot_ of "sort
of big shots, and big ships would use this in addition to
having jump tankage.

It is a problem.  GT changed that.  In GT computers follow the standard

This never worked for me.  That arguement might apply to whole
TL progression, but if you want to stop one technology it doesn\'t
help.  Besinde, the Imperium brings in to many things (like
black globes) and researches too many things to be that conservative.

A Patron actually :-).  (Even Sean Punch decided that Patron

it seemed to work fine.  I don\'t know why they took it out.

Which could explain why you need both power plant output (or power
supplied by Black Globe generators) and jump drive output.  The initial
energy to charge the capacitors is used to "anchor" the lanthanum coil,
which then allows the jump drive to operate safely.

I would add the hypothesis that at least a part of the jump drive\'s
function is to create exotic particles (type to be defined by the
referee in question), which would also act to make the jump drive less
viable as a weapons opwer source.

You are forgetting something.  You are assuming these ships
remain small jump ships.  When you don\'t have fuel, a Free
Trader can go from J-1 to J-6 and only loose 10% of its
volume (less than it gained from not having to carry jump
fuel).  I made up a Free trader without fuel that could
do jump-6 and still carry 30% more cargo.

Now in you explination, you mentioned how the economics
were based on the assumption that trade will be generally
jump-2.  If trade become generally jump-6 won\'t that make
a non-trivial difference?  At the least, it should
redically change the BTNs, and what is based on them.

At the least, I can\'t see how the upgraded free trader
won\'t make a lot more money (mortgage, salaries, annual
maintenance cost all depend on how fast the cargo get
there).

Remember, the overhead for a drop tank station is not going to
be that great.  You need a fuel shuttle, a few tanks, and
some piping.  If you traffic doesn\'t warrant hanging around,
you can just have a ship that carries a tank in it belly.
It goes out to the jump point, lets the other ship use
it, and brings it back.  All the port realy needs is a place to park it.

Of course another problem is that, based on how they
work, you shouldn\'t have to attach the tank to the ship.
It should be able to drop away a pipe.  Thus you
just need a on tanker ship to set up a station.

You can also generate the energy on the tanker ship and reduce
the size the drive on the ship you are launching.

You would convert rather than replace.  You just need to

I don\'t think the cost of the station will be great (see above)
so you will just have excess capacity with a limited erosion
in savings...

I agree that it will take time for them to come into use in
peripherial routes.  A few very small worlds may never get
them.  However, this will still be a big change.  Just
off the top of my head, it means that non-drop tanks ships will
be restricted to shuttling cargo between marginal worlds
and the main routes an back (That would certain affect the
traders in one of my campaigns) and will mean that such worlds
have to overcome high shipping prices when it comes to competition.

Even so, it might be better have a drop capable ship and, if
you want to go to a peripheral world, you strap on a set
of demountable tanks for the trip there and back.

CT:  High Guard (ed 2) p27; Disposable Tanks
MT:  Referee\'s Manual p83; Design checklist, 10.4 - fuel(Drop tanks)
TNE: FFS p62; Drop Tanks
T4:  FFS2 p16; Drop Tanks

So all the design systems support drop tanks.

Whilst I don\'t intend to have them IMTU, I\'m campaigning in M0 so I
am not affected by what will happen in Y1100.

However, whilst checking this info, I did note that *none* of the
design systems make any comments that drop tanks are late TL15 or
TL16.

I would note the the Gazelle in supplement 9 is TL14.

So if you allow drop tanks, it becomes clear that they have been
around for several hundred years and should be completely integrated
into the economy. The TNS entry would appear to be at varience with 
the Traveller rules.

It should be possible to build drop tanks at any TL, starports A or B
(and probably C), even if the jump drive itself needs a higher tech.

This should mean that even the Spinward Marches should have plenty of
"Drop Routes" by 1120.

There are about 60 auctions of CT/MT/TNE/T4 Traveller items
on eBay, including *two* copies of "Beltstrike!" (the Traveller
supplement for Belters and prospecting in asteroid belts).

For you newbies, the "Beltstrike!" material has not been
reprinted for any version other than CT and it\'s rather
rare. It has rules for prospecting, Belter character generation,
and 3 adventures. Current top bids on the two copies are at
$5.00 and $4.95 and are *mint* (supposedly). These things are
worth $10 each (IMO) and I\'d get them both if I didn\'t already
have 2 mint copies (the glories of collecting since 1980).

Another excellent supplement that uncommon is "The Undersea
Environment" which is used for underwater adventuring (SCUBA
diving, underwater recovery, equipment, etc).

You\'ll need to register with eBay in order to place bids but
it\'s free and you can look at the auctions without registering.
Registration gets you a password via email within 24 hours.

Just in case you\'re wondering, I have nothing to do with any
of the auctions or eBay; just trying to "Keep The Flame".

No it isn\'t. The second edition of Mayday *did* come in a ziplock bag.
If there was a box, it came much later. I know, I bought a copy just to

For that matter, looking back at the period before the telegraph on
earth, I\'d suspect that depositions who get taken a *lot*, on the
grounds that it\'s easier and *faster* to ship a cryptographically
signed & secured deposition than a witness. And *much* cheaper.

If the other side feels the need to "cross examine" *then* you might
send for the witness. Though this might annoy the court unless it was a
crucial point. 

BTW, does the Imperium have "veridicators"? If so, at what TL? And what
are the limits on their use?

For those not familar with the term, it comes from H. Beam Piper. It\'s
basicly a gizmo that can tell if the subject is telling the truth or
lying. *Reliably*. That is, after a few simple "test questions", it\'ll
either respond correctly, or show that the person is incapable of
distinguishing between truth and falsehood (say, for example, they are
a pathological liar). In the latter case, the person\'s testimony is
worthless anyway, so being unable to verify it isn\'t a big loss. :-)

*If* they exist in the Imperium, to have a lot of the stuff we see in
"history" be possible, they must only be usable during trials, not
during investigations. Or rather, you can only be *compelled* to submit
to a veridicator when testifying "under oath", with no prejudice for
refusing to do so at other times. 

Also, quesioning would (obviously) have to be *strictly* restricted to
"relevant" topics.

I\'m not sure if they *belong* in Traveller, but I thought I\'d throw the
idea out.

Actually, as I\'ve said in the past, the *simplest* explanation is that
the *form* of the energy is useless for anything but initiating a jump.
At least at known tech levels. Maybe it goes into distorting space
inside the coils/crystals. 

Of course, the *effect* of my explanation turns out to be the same as
yours. :-)

Hardly. Contrary to what you see in all the movies and on TV fleets of
space ships *won\'t* be packed so tightly that you can throw rocks
between them. That\'s *asking* for trouble at their velocities.

Heck, if you look at a carrier group at sea, the ships are farther
apart than the ships in the average TV show/movie.

Having ships a kilometer or more apart will be quite reasonable. It
also makes it harder to take them all out with the same nuke. 100
*ship* diameters apart isn\'t all that far, even if you use the longest
dimension of the ship. 

At 100 km apart, a 30,000 km hex can hold around 9000 ships.

Nope.  Both the first and second one\'s were published.

Not wanting to start a war here but think carefully about what you said
there.  Did
Tolkien publish The Two Towers first?  Did Empire Strikes Back come out
first?  No,
no one publishes the second book of a trilogy first...  Doesn\'t make sence.

How about Raiders of the Lost Ark? It is the second movie in the Indiana
Jones Trilogy, but it was made first.

* Added the ability to export to a separate file all changes which

ship.
* Fixed a minor problem with the upper limit on turrets and bays not
getting set properly when loading a ship.
* Fixed a bug with incorrect spaces/mass/cost when removing cargo.
* Added an option to allow you to turn off the Tech Level filters.
This allows you to put (for example) TL 12 weapons on your TL 10 ship.
* Added an option to allow you to adjust the mass added to your loaded
mass for each empty cargo space.
* You can now add fractional amounts of certain modules (like cargo).
* You can now put weapons with a non-standard volume in turrets. This
means that you can fit two of the 1.5 space weapons in a turret
instead of being forced to mount them on the hull.
* Jump Rating is now displayed on the design screen. This rating is
automatically adjusted when you change the hull size of your ship.

This is info from the Pyramid G:T discussion group.   I don\'t have the
original text, so I am paraphrasing.  My apologies if I get anything wrong.  

According to Marc Miller, _all_ objects that are bigger than the ship will
cause  breakout if within 100D.  This includes object in interstellar
space, and is the reason why a ship needs an astrogator.  Fortunately,
_very_ accurate charts are available (After all, three different millennia
old civilization have been mapping this stuff. )  However, sometimes you
still make a mistake, or breakout due to an uncharted vessel.  This is
represented by the chance of misjumps that can sometimes place the ship
between the target and destination worlds.

This also (IMHO) raises the possibilities for piracy, since now most ships
will tend to come out within a predictable region (albeit a very large one)
rather than anywhere in the system.

As for fleets jumping together, a 100kdt battleship is about 2/5 mile long
(according to G:T)  thus, it\'s 100D limit is 40 miles.  Considering that in
G:T one hex in space combat is 10,000 miles, fleets can be in fairly close
formation. 

As for the issue of cannonicity, since I play G:T (or will, as of this
weekend when we convert from T4), this is cannon IMOTU (In My Official
Traveller Universe).  :)

None of it is canon, but back when I was playing and reffing TNE I put

about the Black Curtain and TNE\'s other mysterious. See my Traveller page

It just came out in December 1998 and I bought my copy at MediaPlay.
Most large bookstores should probly be carrying it. 
It is a large sized paperpack, 480 pages , ISBN 0-676-60144-8 and is
published by House of Collectables part of Ballantine Publishing which is
a division of Random House. They are the same publishers that put out
dozens of price guides for all sorts of collectables. 

It lacks the more detailed descriptions found in Heroic Worlds, but does
cover items up through sometime in 1998. The prices listed do not seem
to be too consistent based on my auction experience in the rpg.marketplace
newsgroup. It lists at $17.

I don\'t think it was ever fully developed by GDW before they went 
out of business.  As far as I recall, it was discovered by Project
Longbow and was moving outward from the galactic core.  It apparently
had entered Zhodani space and was destroying the psi abilities of
the Zho nobles.  There may be some write ups of it in TNE materials,
maybe magazines.  Anyway, the "Chick in Black" (the woman dressed in
the wicked witch outfit on the cover of TNE) figured into this 
somehow as part of an Emperor\'s (Strephon\'s ???) dreams.  IMHO, I\'m
glad this story line wasn\'t developed further.

These have been mentioned.  The list calls them demountable tanks
(is there a canonical source?  The Traveller adventure mentiones
internal tanks).  I don\'t think anyone disagree with these.

(So, you are right :-)

Yeah, I know about that. The point though is that it really _is_ completely
unbelievable.   If you don\'t think about it and suspend your disbelief, fine.
But nothing in Traveller stands up to any serious scrutiny, so worrying about
minor details like the fact that drop tanks aren\'t as common as you happpen to
think they should  be, seems a bit frivolous.

Though I admit  if we didn\'t have these debates there wouldn\'t be much point
in the TML

I think you may have misunderstood what I meant with the Aborigine. I was
implying that expecting the Aborgine to understand modern NY is the equivalent
of expecting 20thC  westerners to understand the Imperium ( assuming it
actually existed ) .

Not if they wanted to jump they wouldn\'t !

I suspect it\'s more practical, and probably cheaper, to put a better weapon
and a bigger power plant in than adding large amounts of unneccesary fuel
tankage and relying on over-driven equipment.

There\'s a difference between what is found at Ancient\'s sites (Black Globes),
what is researched ( Signal GK) , what is used by the Navy ( Gazelle\'s), and
what is used regularly by commercial operators.

IRL, we\'ve had "spaceships" for almost forty years now, and there\'s still only
a handful of commercial operators, and except for the avionics commercial
airliners are still largely using technology that is older than that. Although
drop-tanks exist IRL and have done since the end of WWII, still only the
military uses them.

Maybe drop-tanks really aren\'t economicallly feasible for commercial use in
the Imperium.
I haven\'t run the numbers, but in most Traveller incarnations traders are only
just viable anyway, and the additional expense of paying for drop tanks and
the associated couplings each time may not be justifiable.

 The only thing the drop tanks gain you really is the ability for a ship to
jump further with the same cargo
Yes, if there were no other Jump 4 traders available, the Jump 4 ship may be
able to charge a premium on priority goods, but that\'s unlikley.

Am I correct in my interpretation that a ship which is precipitated out of
Jump does _not_ roll on the Misexit column (on the Jump Mishap Table)?

	Perhaps the Aborigine to NY comparison is the wrong metaphor for 
modern to Imperial times.   Maybe putting a 1st century Roman or 5th century 
BC Greek in modern NY would be better.   Once he got past a few of the gizmos 
and the absence of slaves, the urban life would seem very recognizeable,  the 
shock would be great at first, but  he would recognize an awful lot (heck a 
Roman would be able to read a few things here and there).

I had a curious thought several weeks ago, and am looking to develop 
it into an actual adventuring concept for my upcoming campaign.  With 
the short-lived sci-fi series "Mercy Point" (I at least think it\'s 
short-lived, anyway, since I haven\'t seen it advertised in quite some 
time) and novels like "Hospital Station", etc, it would seem to me 
that a well-built TU should have its own versions of the Mayo Clinic 
in Space.

How do you handle the concept of Medical ships as moving hospitals, 
or Medical space stations as a point for special medical treatments?

I was considering using one as the focal point for an adventure in my 
First Contact campaign, and was looking for educated opinions on the 
form and location a Medical Space Station might take in that milieu.

Andrew, has this concept already been addressed in your ME21 
discussions?  Rob Eaglestone, what about your ME21 work?

Thanks for your time and patience.  I now return you to your 
regularly scheduled Drop Tank thread, already in progress...

You\'re only using the \'Average Price\' which is just one factor in calculating the
Current Freight Price.

Current Price = Average Price + (Price Volatility x 4d6-14).

Price Volatility is a variable that the referee can set to reflect economic changes
(see GT:FT p.36 sidebar on Price Series).  Its suggested to be 0.025*Average Price
unless the referee wants to model long term economic factors.

So, the equation for the purchase price of the freight is:
Pc = 700 + ((0.025*700) + 4d6-14)
This yields a range of
700 + 17.5*(-10) = 525 Cr
to
700 + 17.5*(10) = 875 Cr

Then, you must make a successful Merchant roll, with various modifiers,
to successfully bid for particular cargoes.  The success of that roll determines
the final price for the freight, a range of 50% to 150%.

In this case, the ultimate range of frieght prices would be
263Cr to 1313 Cr per ton.  An average of these values gives: 50,038 Cr.

The same process is used for Passenger rates.
Current Price for High Passage =
3500 + (Price Volatility * (4d6-14))
Pv in this case is 0.02*Average Price suggested
Pc = 3500 + (70*(-10)) =  2800 Cr
Pc = 3500 = (70*(10)) = 4200 Cr

1400 Cr to 6300 Cr in ultimate range; 3850 Average
3850 Cr Average * 3 = 11550 Cr

For Medium Passage:
Pc = 1750 + (35 * (-10)) = 1400
Pc = 1750 + (35 * (10)) = 2100
700 Cr to 3150 Cr; average value 1925 Cr
1925 Cr * 6 = 11550 Cr

For Low Passage:
Pc = 175 + (3.5 * (-10)) = 140 Cr
Pc = 175 + (3.5 * (10)) = 210 Cr
70 Cr to 315 Cr; 193 Average


So a max value load will be:
Cargo: 1313 Cr * 63.5 Tons = 83,775.5 Cr
High Passage:  6300 Cr * 3 = 18,900 Cr
Medium Passage: 3150 Cr * 6 = 18,900 Cr
Low Passage: 315 Cr * 20 = 6300 Cr
Total: 127,875.5 Cr

A least value load would be:
Cargo: 16700.5 Cr
High Passage: 4,200 Cr
Medium Passage: 4,200 Cr
Low Passage: 1,400 Cr
Total: 26,500.5 Cr

The median of that range is 77,188 Cr per jump.
Assuming 24 trips per year: 1,852,512 Cr

Several things will increase your chances of greater profits, primarily Merchant
skill, but also taking Special Handling Cargoes and searching for freight for
which there is no direct route to the destination.

You pay this per month and not per jump.

Also a per month expenditure.

Cheapest rate is 350 Cr/ton, 7,000 Cr.

This is 20Cr * Hull size, for the first 6 days, or 4,000 Cr.

Changing to an annual rate to deal with per jump and per month costs:

Income per year: 1,852,512 Cr
Expenditures:
Mortgage: 58,000 Cr * 12 = 696,000 Cr
Salaries: 5k * 12 = 60,000 Cr
Fuel: 7,000 Cr * 24 = 168,000 Cr
Maintenance setaside: 1,000 Cr * 12 = 12,000 Cr
Berthing: 4,000 Cr * 24 = 96,000 Cr
Sundries: 1,000 Cr * 12 = 12,000 Cr
Total Expenditures = 1,044,000 Cr

Income Per Year: 1,852,513 Cr
Expenditures Per Year: 1,044,000 Cr
Annual Profit: 808,513 Cr

I think the most significant error was paying the mortgage and other fees per jump
instead of per month.

Define \'better\' exactly.  Better power to weight ratio seems to be your

That depends on your assumptions.  You MAY be right but you COULD also be

What about before bonded superdence.  Also what about mass.  That superdense

Superdense needs some more defining.  Just what is it\'s base materail and
it\'s charateristic once it becomes superdense?  I\'d not ready to hand way it
just yet.

I do not recall Traveller defining the range, detection, ect capabilities of
the EMS sensor IN the atmosphere.  I am not about to state what is posible
in space as I have no experience in space sensors.  I do know some of the
limits on atmospheric sensor as I have worked with them.  If Traveller\'s
claims are plaonly imposible, passive optical reception over the horison for
example, I do have a problem with it.

6 tons in 186 tons is not over the top perportion wise, no, and part of the
problem could be the different verions on the rampart.  The AHL IIRC does
not have CG for example..

Yes, I understand your point but just exactly where in canon does it state
the sensor threshold limits?  I do not recall that stat in CT?  I also do
not recall any abjustments for atmosophere type, depth, storms, thermal
masking, camofage, defilade, ect.

Neither have you, so how do you claim that the space fighter will win?  You
make the assumption based on other people\'s comments.  I make mine based on
design rules and physical limits within the real world.

If that were so the RPGs are absurd.  I do not consider them so.  I do not
consider any intelectual discorse complete without merit.  We learn from
everything we do, if we are wise.

Also, I stated that a RPG based on space craft might not have a good air
craft design system because it saw no need for the detailed mechanics. This
makes the kind of test you suggest pointless which was the point I was
trying to make.  The only real test would have to be under a \'genre nutral\'
design system and even then the test would only ally for that design system,
game mechanic, and tech level within that mechanic.  I\'d expect that with
tech level changes there would be changes in the dynamics that would require
design changes and tactics changes the nature of which I could not speculate
on without extensive testing.

Yes, it would as my gaming time is limited and the games am currently
playing in are not under my control, (I\'m not the GM).  Also, I would not
tamper with one of my games as GM to test the theory.  The PCs were in a
scout courier that I know I can beat with a good fighter design.  Why should
I kill off the PCs just to win this arguement especially sence I dought you
would except one battle as \'proof\' as I would not do so.  Also a fighter
attack would not fit the current story line.

No currently or under the same game system.  I\'ll play almost any game in
the company is good.  I\'ve found there is something to like in almost any
game system.  I\'ve GMed mostly Gurps (many different Genres), AD&D, D&D, and
CT.  I\'ve also played Battle tech, Robotech, Renagade Legion, Rune Quest,
MagicTG, Melee, Star Fleet Battles, Ace of Aces, and any other game I was
invited to play.  I hope to be playing Earth Dawn in a few weeks when the
moving is over.  My SO is moving in with me.  Every free moment in the last
month has been devote to the move.  We are both looking forward to a break
when we are done.

You have stated that you have done so as well.  Please post YOUR test bed
units.  I have never designed two $ compatable units to make this test
balenced. If $s can let this test be balenced.

First what balence point do you want to use?  Money? Or one unit on one unit
with out concurn for the unit cost?  What GTL?

I think one of the big prblems with our discussion is we have not properly
deffined the test.  If your intent is one on one combat regarless of cost
then I think you are probably right that the space unit will win as I can
not see anybody building and atmospheric craft that is a match for the
Tygeress.  If that is your point I conceed it.  IF you are talking $s, then
I do not conceed and I think you are in an untendable position.

>If not, you lack the two needed to continue this discussion.
>

As I said, it is not doable, but there are other ways.  First we must better
define the terms of the test.

Yes, partly, but that is now beside the point.  We have a more interesting
posibility on our hands.

We need to better define the test before we go any farther.  What is to be
the design limit?  I\'d say money.  Next we compare not two but three
vehicals.  One air fighter, one space fighter, and one grave tank all of the
same or lower tech level all costing the same or less money.  My guess would
be that in strait fights to the finish in an earth standard atmosphere with
GTL12 that the grav tank will be the overall winner (because they will be
duals the tank has some design advantages).  It would NOT be fair for the
vehiches to be designed by the same person as personal bias is likely to
corrupt the results so perhaps if we can come up with the rules for the test
other interested parties on the list will join in and we can have a little
design contest.

As for a design of my own, my GV2 has gone MIA (looked for it this past week
end).  It will be saturday before I can replace it.

SO:

What GTL?

How much money?

Any other minimum design limits?

Turning Gs and speed are not neccessarily the same thing.  I do not know of
any mach 25+ missles that travel in the atmosphere below 50k feet.

And 45g turns would kill a human pilot.

To easy to pick the noise from the signal.  You lock up the real targets in
seconds.  That\'s what spectromiters are for.  Also that long approach by the
meteor gives the defender time to figure it\'s ntry vecter and iliminated it
as a posibility.

Affraid so.  The difference at this point get blurry.  I guess if it uses

Never said speed was all that usefull.  It\'s bloody useless against enery

That\'s pretty much what I had in mind as CG has less wight penalty than good
VTOL gear I think.  Would have to compare them but Cg has some advantages in
war load to so it would probably win.

Ouch!  Good point.  But I just thought of something.  What about a Star Wars

that one shot was one kill even on a dreadnaught.

Why would the fighter need to climb with energy weapons?  It would be better
to stay low and slow and fight sub style rising from behind terrain only to
fire it\'s energy weapons.

Deck Plans - 2D, 3D, 4D, your choice

Design stats - any design system or level of detail accepted

This means that if you are big into deck plans, but don\'t do exterior

I\'ve read a book titled (IIRC) _Company Commander_, an account by

Frightening indeed.

Also, drop tanks are highly fragile in combat -- they don\'t get armor
protection in HG, and any hit to fuel before armor is considered destroys 
them.  They make more sense on commercial vessels than military for most
purposes.  TCS also had "external demountable tanks" that were like drop
tanks except that they took longer to attach and couldn\'t be dropped.

The first TCS competition in 1981 had some winning military ships which 
used drop tanks to help meet the minimum jump requirements.  But in that
competition the victor was judged on the outcome of one battle, so ships
with drop tanks didn\'t need to worry about post-combat logistics.

As I recall, under the final High Guard drop tank rules it\'s not allowed. 
The Gazelle is one of the first CT designs, and my guess is that either
the designer goofed or the rule hadn\'t been solidified yet.

  Demountable tanks (internal or exterior) have some minor problems,
not the least being that clever players will wonder why they should
bother with the internal ones when a pre-fab tanker container could 
probably be found that took less than a week to dismount :|

  Both sorts would likely be more palatable if they cost more than KCr
 1.0 per Dt - even 5 or 10 would start to screw up the standard "drop
tank" economics if they truly weren\'t significantly re-usable (i.e.,
the material might be recycled but the tank would be essentially re-
manufactured at close to original cost - failure to do so might be a
great reason to use Hans\' recommended +1 to misjump rolls).

  Of course, it\'s the HG/TCS rules on pure "drop tanks" that are the worst.

  How about running some numbers in your favourite Trav edition and tell
us how standard and external tankage ships stack up, and then we\'ll compare
the costs to figure out how much inconvenience it\'s worth. NOTE - if you run
this for CT/HG and aren\'t appalled by the disparity, then you\'re not trying
hard enough :)

  Duels are not a great comparison, although I\'ll agree that a grav tank will
do very well in most cases. It should be noted that a heavy grav tank/gunship
is really just a small light SDB, and as such can participate in many missions
whereas an air-breathing flier or pure CG grav tank is limited to planetary
operations only. Thus, any pure comparison will be about as useful as trying
to assess the flexibility of a medium mortar as compared to a WW2 dive bomber.

Okay I have some contentions about this but it\'s basically correct.

The EW is a psychic phenomenon, traveling outwards from the galactic core at the speed
of light.  The CIB is indeed the Empress, and it was Strephon\'s dreams that she was in
but only after he\'d been exposed to the EW data from the Longbow site in Corridor.  The
reason he wasn\'t at core to be assassinated by Dulinor..  8^)

I think it\'s a pretty interesting story line personally.  It\'s effects seem somewhat
varied but it seems to brind about a fundamental change in peoples mindests.  IMO and
FWIU it seems to have the greatest impact on monolithic cultures, or the greatest
visable impact on monolithic cultures.  The EW had been travelling through the Vargr
extents for equally as long as it had through Zho space however, because the very
nature of Vargr society is chaotic its effect was less pronounced than those witnesses
in Zhodani space where society and politics were somewhat less dynamic.

I have my doubts about it stripping Psychic talents most of the evidence we\'ve been
left with due to the fall of GDW is somewhat to the contrary, it would seem or it sure
looks like (and this is strickly my opinion here) that the EW rather than closing off
psionic\'s rips them wide open.  Suddenly proles are psionic\'s and with this mass of
terror at the discovery of new tallents a psychic wave of hysteria spreads across the
planet growing in strength as it goes.  The Zho nobels psionic tallents are also opened
up and they overload due to the wave of panic sweeping across their planets.
Essentially destroying the Zho governement as the rulers become catatonic...

One thing that\'s not mentioned is that there is more than one Longbow site.  Evidence
within Survival Margin hints at three Longbow stations.   Gabriel (Depot Corridor),
Herod and Raphael both somewhere out in the Vargr Extents or beyond...

It seems that the initial wavefront of the EW simply brings about visions of the
Empress/CIB.  It isn\'t untill some 40-70 years later that the destruction begins to
appear, the reasons for this are as yet unexplained...

  Megacorps will self-insure their ships, unless their management is truly
monumentally idiotic. If you assume that the 3I does require licenses to be
issued for designs then that\'s a potential problem, but it doesn\'t apply to
the rest of the universe.

  Once it becomes a business decision rather than an engineering problem
then the battle is over - drop tanks will dominate most routes if the issue
is seen to be largely economic. If Gazelles exist without huge attrition
rates from drop tank use then the engineering issues are clearly solved,
at least for cargo uses (there is precedent for the "people are stupid"/
"perception is everything" problem if liners blow up once in a while, but
luckily that\'s inconceivable :| ).

  It might also be pointed out that our current business cultures obsession
with short-term stock values may be seen in the future as a pathology; it is
assuredly not a constant in the modern world.

  The Gazelle (however bizarre a mis-design it might be to us now) has
supposedly used drop tanks since it was designed, but its hard to believe
that it\'s a 1095-1100 new build; if it was originally a Rim War escort (and
what else could keep up with an AHL?) then what was it doing for L-Hyd tankage?

  See my comments of last fall re: Al Morai; at any time post-5FW switching
over a standard Type MK would take around 10 weeks in a shipyard. Their corp
structure also covers financing and management issues quite handily. Of course,
they\'re not Vilani either :)

20 Low Pass: 20KCr
63.5 Tons Freight: 63.5 KCr

Total income is 161.5 KCr per jump.

Of course your expenses would change also since I think fuel, life support
and all is also different.

		  12.5 DT of cargo space taken up by passengers and crew

Speculative cargoes is risky business.  The potential profits are great,
but so are the potential losses.

Pretty much everything is changed.  Freight, cargo, and passage rates are all
variable.  Far Trader is an attempt to be as realistic as possible.  While its
compatible with other versions of Traveller, you have to dispell the basic and
short hand system of the old, 10KCr High passage and 1Kcr/ton of frieght.

  Me, IIRC, although I doubt I ever claimed "eliminate". Piracy is
pretty much provably stuck in backwaters and outsystems, so the ones
who really get screwed by "jump-stations" are potential hijackers.

  I may have missed something in this thread, but this only follows
(i.e., shooting up the displacement mass hand-wave) if it is clearly
specified that jump can be held for a significant time period after
the tanks are dropped; I\'ve heard this, but don\'t know the page ref.

Actually, most typos don\'t..what I meant to say was only the first and

	A Beowulf-class Free Trader converted to J-6 and drop tanks _would_ 
make a lot more money than a conventional Beowulf.  Of course, it would also 
cost a lot more to own and operate.  The difference in price between a J-1 
and J-6 drive for a 200-dton GT ship is 31MCr.  This more than doubles the 
price of the ship.  The cost of operating a drop tank ship is also higher 
because of the additional infrastructure required.  It is true that drop-
tank ships are overall likely to be less expensive to operate than 
conventional designs and that this advantage increases with jump number, but 
it is also true that this cost advantage is not so large as to be truly 
revolutionary.

It is true that if trade became significantly cheaper and/or faster, the 
distance mods used in calculating the BTNs would have to be revised.  
However, it would have to be a _huge_ change, because the BTN scale is very 
course.  Remember that a +0.5 increase in BTN is equal to a five-fold 
increase in trade, and a +1.0 increase is a ten-fold increase in trade.  I 
did this purposefully so as to make BTNs robust to IMTU-type changes to 
background people might wish to make.  Drop-tanks fall into this category.

	In analyzing LASH ships Chris and I found that just the expense of 
having extra Lighters and Oilers around to keep things running smoothly 
eliminated a great deal of the LASH cost advantage.  Since LASH and drop-
tank operations are substantially similar, I suspect the same will be the 
case here.  In fact, Chris\'s previously posted analysis suggests just that.

	You also have to covert all the fuel tankage to cargo space, including 
adding access-ways, etc.  It could be done.

	You\'re missing four things:

(1) As has been pointed out, you should be making twice as much per high-
passenger.  This by itself closes your revenue short-fall from 19KCr to 
9KCr.

(2) 24 jumps a year is too few.  Canon aside, you don\'t need to spend a 
whole week knocking about port looking for freight and passengers.  35 jumps 
a year is definitely the max, but something in between helps close your 
revenue short-fall further.

(3) Skills!  Your crew should have Merchant skill to push up your freight 
rate, savoir-faire to push up passenger ticket prices, Market Analysis and 
Economics to predict where above average freight and passenger rates can be 
found, and Area Knowledge to find those juicy speculative cargos.

(4) The Beowulf has got to be the hardest ship to make money in ever 
designed.  Try an Empress Marava coupled with some long-distance trading 
strategies and tell me what you find.  The biggest problem I had in 
designing these rules was in how to keep clever players and highly skilled 
characters from making too _much_ money.

That\'s what I\'ve read.  Not a very stealthy approach, I wouldn\'t think. ;->

This is kind of a followup to the relative velocity between systems
topic...

Is there a common orientation reference direction that can be described
from each system? 

IMTU, I have always allowed relative velocity to be kept through jump.
(Roll 2d6 for # of G-turns required to correct velocity - 1d6 for hex
direction of velocity). Sucessful navigation tasks to determine this
info prior to jump.

I could never figure out a way to keep track of relative positioning
without a custom software package. I wrote a BASIC program 14 years ago
that calculated Book 6 system positions as a function of a time seed. 

I wish I could find that input now. It was for an Apple IIe and was the
culmination of a high school summer of learning BASIC. By that autumn, I
had a girlfriend and my gaming and programming time suffered
considerably. It hasn\'t really improved since. 

FWIW, both the computer and the girlfriend were repeatedly upgraded to
better models.

I think Megatraveller\'s Imperial Encyclopedia covers this; if not, look
at DGP\'s Vilani & Vargr.  Remember, the MT era starts about 1116, so
it\'s a good time period for you.

Don\'t forget the possible "ship destroyed" result, which I take to mean
that it never comes out of jump space.  Now if the ship isn\'t actually
destroyed, it\'s just stuck in jump space and the people aboard have as
long to live as they have life support.  As I recall, the expected
duration of jump -- even misjump -- is known to the ship at the moment
of jump, so the officers at least will know that they\'re never getting
out.  It would make for a very dark scenario.  I don\'t think I\'d inflict
it on the players, unless I thought they\'d enjoy it.

Actually, no. there are other misjump possibilities, ranging from simple
failure to jump, with possible damage to the drives, to the ND6
displacement in  a random direction to destruction of the ship.

The majority of misjumps, however are minor variations in the time of
jump or the final exit location. So yes, the ships officers will know
the expected length of jump duration, but it can vary...meaning that the
scenario above is converted into a race against time and air supply...

Not necessarily.  A sphere of 100 000 dtons has a volume of 50 000 000

r to get d and you get 458 ft.  100 times 458 is 45800 ft between ships

There are 5280 ft to a mile, so that is only 8.67 miles (about 14.45

Aaaaccckkk!  I said I was *short* on time today... <G>

Undernet is a segment of the IRC or Internet Relay Chat community. It
allows realtime text based chat for all logged into a particular channel.

To access undernet, you need an IRC client (I feel an FAQ for my site
coming on...).  For PC clones, I recommend mIRC or Pirch (should I link?)
and for Mac boxes I\'ve been told that Ircle is the best client. Once you
have installed the client, point it to undernet.  Currently, I use Phoenix
as my server of choice (phoenix.az.us.undernet.org, port 6667). I know mIRC
comes with a list of servers preset, scroll down to select an IRC server.
It is recommended by the internet community to use a server close to your
physical location, but I can assure you best results if most/all of the
attendees are on the same server. Lag, the time it takes for a message to
get from one client to the other via the IRC servers, can be brutal.

If you need help actually getting online, email me privately after you have
selected and installed a client and I\'ll be happy to work with you. 

I can be reached by ICQ, #1323623, for this purpose.

Cheers!

Lets do some numbers: (all my numbers are based on MT)

Free Trader gets a shipment to be delivered from 2036 Glisten/Spinward
Marches to 2038 Trane/Spinward Marches. Ship refuels and jumps immediatly to
save time.

Cost to travel from Glisten to Sorel to Horosho to Trane:
Time = 3 weeks
Fuel Cr30,000
Berthing Costs Cr300
Life Support = Cr10,000 (based on crew only)
Crew Salary = Cr3,000
Maintenance = Cr3,000
Total Cost = Cr46,200

Cost to travel using drop tanks from Glisten to (empty hex) to Trane.
Time = 2 weeks
Fuel = Cr20,000
Drop Tanks = Cr30,250
Berthing costs = Cr100
Life Support = Cr6,500 (based on crew only)
Crew Salary = Cr2,000
Maintenance = Cr2,000
Total Cost = 60,850

It costs an extra Cr14,650 to save 1 week time.

The shipment must be pretty valuable or time is very important factor to
make this profitable.

Now, a trading corporation could have private ships that collect and reuse
the drop tanks. This could cut Cr30,000 off of each run saving the corp
about Cr15,000 each time.  (but then their\'s the cost of the ship that
collects the drop tanks and other related costs)

I think most free traders would opt to pick up mid/high passengers and cargo
to bring to Sorel, Horosho and Trane and make the Cr8,000 to Cr10,000 for
each passenger. Probably take 6 weeks to get to Trane, but possibly make
Cr150,000+ from passengers and cargo. (minus expenses of course). That cargo
that has to arrive in 2 weeks has got to be valuable to make the delivery
worth while. (Of course, a Far trader will probably come along that will
take the cargo for less, because it can afford the trip)

I think the only way drop tanks could really be used effectively is by large
corporations. The "little guy" just wouldn\'t be able to keep up with the
costs of drop tanks.

I don\'t see how drop tanks will make an impact on economics unless the cost
of drop tanks are greatly reduced. I don\'t think you can reduce the costs of
drop tanks much. The Cr30,250 cost for 270kl drop tanks is a "rental fee". I
figure the actual cost to make a drop tank is closer to Cr550,000 (figure
270kl hull, config irregular, armor 40 (to survive micrometeorites and
radiation) and 80% for mass production).
I can imagine a shuttle escort following the ship to jump to retrieve the
tanks and bring them back (don\'t want Cr550,000 to float off into deep
space). The "renter" of the drop tanks signs rental agreement. If the ship
jumps without dropping it\'s tanks then it can be subject to additional late
fees. (maybe the cost of the tanks per day, which could add up quick after a
couple of weeks in jump space)

The drop tank company would make a little money... but wouldn\'t get rich on
selling drop tanks. Consider the costs of maintaining shuttle escorts (plus
crew) the costs of repairing damaged tanks, and purchasing new tanks. If the
tanks were sold for any less than the company selling them would go
bankrupt.

A ship could be designed (our modified) to have collapsable tanks (as per
MT) and use drop tanks. A free trader could increase it\'s cargo hold from
1107kl to 1377kl. A ship transporting freight (at Cr1000 per ton) could make
an extra Cr20,000 but would pay Cr30,250 for the tanks, resulting in a net
loss of Cr10,250.

1kl of jump drive = 4 tons of cargo
1kl of jump drive\'s worth of fuel in drop tanks = Cr5,000/kl (rounded for
simple math, actual Cr5,062.50) + Cr10,000

drop tanks cost Cr5,000 for each kl of jump drive + Cr10,000

Below is the minimum price for 1 ton of cargo to pay for drop tanks

2kl drives = Cr2,500 (minimum price for 1 ton of cargo to pay for drop
tanks)
4kl drives = Cr1,875
10kl drives = Cr1,500
200kl drives = Cr1,262
1000kl drives = Cr1,252
70000kl drives = Cr1,250

*reference [a free trader has 4kl of drives]

Basically, a free trader would have to make a minimum of Cr1,875 per ton to
pay for the drop tanks, but the ship would still only make the same amount
of money by the end of the jump. The cargo MUST be worth more than
Cr1,875/ton to make a profit from using drop tanks and using the fuel tanks
for cargo.

How can the existance of drop tanks upset economics? It just isn\'t
profitable to use them.

On the subject of fuel tankers and jump stations:

Fuel tankers would be the "ultimate" drop tank.

A little inconvientient, the ships have to fly to the tanker instead of to
"anywhere" outside of 100 diameters.

Cr500/ton refined
Cr100/ton unrefined

What\'s going to be the tankers "surcharge"?
Maybe Cr1000/ton? (someone has to pay for the delivery of fuel to the
tanker, pay for the crew, pay for the ship, etc...)

Tankers and jump stations could operate as a replacement for drop tanks, but
the cost would still be about the same. Drop tanks just allow you to jump
from anywhere (anywhere normally allowed) instead of having to go to the
tanker/station.

On the subject of Xboats:

I think Xboats could use the xboat station in the manner of a drop-tanker.
It wouldn\'t speed up the network, (since theirs a waiting xboat ready to
launch), but it could provide more cargo space (data-storage space). I don\'t
think it would be very useful though.

On the subject of double-jumps.

What happens to the wear on jump drives if a ship makes several
"double-jumps"? (when after arriving in system from a jump from drop tanks,
the ship immediatly jumps again with the fuel in its fuel tanks). Would the
drives take more wear from "running hot" for several weeks straight? Would
the chance of misjump increase from not allowing the drives to "cool down"?
IMTU, double-jumping can increase the dangers of misjump. (+1 on mishap
table for each consecutive jump, 3 jumps in a row results in +2 on the
mishap table)

Since I am not an artist, and I haven\'t tried my hand at deckplans, I would
be willing to design a ship for anyone willing to provide either/both.  I
prefer TL15 designs, but I\'m willing to design at most any TL.  I\'ve used
FFS v1/v2 and I am currently using Andrew Akin\'s spreadsheet.

I have a couple of designs for scout ships on the shelf.  A 100dton Mongoose
Class scout, the _Rikki Tikki Tavi_ (SL Disc with Turret).  A 500dton
Wolverine Class scout, currently without a name. (SL Wedge with 5 turrets).

I also have a 10,000dton Enchantress Class Luxury Liner  (SL Long Box), with
a breakdown (in dtons) of shops, lounges, restaurants, etc.

Just taking a step back from your current debate - couldn\'t drop tanks be
likened to Concorde in the RW?

Expensive to produce (comparatively to standard aircraft)
Faster (longer range in Traveller terms)
Public failure (eg the Russian equivalent which failed at an Airshow)
Small number of adoptees (Air France and BA)

Concorde has been around 20-30 years now and I don\'t see a rush by
manufacturers or airlines to buy equivalents.

Because the space fighter could star high and use drones or other spotters

But there\'s a whole interesting set of tactics that need developing ;-)

The Concorde also requires extravagantly long runways, sucks down fuel
like a \'69 Plymouth Road Runner Superbird and (critically for most
airports)is enormously noisy.

The interior is cramped, the tickets are hideously expensive, and
consequently it has a hard time attracting passengers. (My mother in law
flew the Concorde...once. She was shuttling some extremely
time-sensitive documents to the London home office of her company, from
New York, and basically flying her there on the Concorde was the only
way to keep a very big deal from costing a lot of money. The concorde
just _happened to be scheduled when they needed it...I don\'t remember
why but there was some stupid reason they couldn\'t just fax them) She
was _very_ glad the flight time was a short as it was, she said she\'d
rather have flown a commuter turboprop...they\'re more comfortable. She
didn\'t mind getting the weekend in London, though ;-)

The better Trav equivalents are Jump-6 ships.

Jump masking eats away at any time saving in port - most systems are
automatically masked if you go by the stellar types in MT Imperial Encyclopedia.
I am beginning to suspect that Jump masking is going to make it much harder to
make a profit. It should also make freight rates to masked systems higher.

(aside : jump masking, no life support costs, & self maintenance of ships also
opens the door to piracy a little wider than with previous versions of
traveller)

Fair enough. I don\'t see how this will be enough to offset the costs for a
Beowulf.

So you are saying that Beowulf is a broken ship as far as Far Trader is
concerned?

No. A GT Beowulf costs 29MCr. Mortgage per month is 29/240 = 120 MCr/ month, or
60MCr/Jump. 
(58Mcr was based on my independant calculation of the price and was therefore
generous).

>>   Salaries =  5 KCr

No. Engineer Salary = 200*lowest PR (12+) per month = minimum of 24000/year.

= 1KCr+/Jump for an Engineer.

I had assumed similar or greater amounts for the pilot and astrogator and a
lower amount for the steward. Though I found this hard to see on the GT salary
chart.

I had hand waved at 1.25KCr salary per person per jump.

I could accept lower say 4KCr but 2.5KCr seems harsh. Please show details.

>>   Fuel     =  2 KCr

>Cheapest rate is 350 Cr/ton, 7,000 Cr.

Oh. I assumed I could get it at 100Cr/DT unrefined and run it through my fuel
processor. I couldn\'t see this in Far Trader, but I had assumed it had not been
ruled out.

This makes the sums worse.

>> Maintenance contribution = 1 KCr

> Also per month.

No. 29Mcr/1000 = 2900Kcr/year = 2.4KCr/month = 1.2KCr/jump (I had rounded DOWN
for simplicity).

>>   Berthing = 20 KCr

>This is 20Cr * Hull size, for the first 6 days, or 4,000 Cr.

It is? GT says 100Cr per ship DT. The intro to the Far Trader bit on berthing
says that its rules average to the same as GT, and I hadn\'t double checked to
make sure that this was true.

[snippage of detail it will take me some time to analyse]

I will recalculate using your figures and repost, when I get the time, which may
not be until next weekend.

Note that I haven\'t yet included things like my insurance, and depreciation. 
These would obviously increase the cost still further. What values would you
suggest for these?

    'body' => 'What does a starship cost?

Any Traveller knows what a starship costs to buy; but
how many know what the cost is to a shipyard?  Like
airplane factories, shipyards are run as economically
streamlined as possible; this means demand must be
balanced against costs, manpower, resources, and
shipyard usage.  After all, an idle shipyard is a waste of
time, money, and resources.

The typical shipyard must be at least partially used most
of the time to be feasible.  For some wild guesses, I\'ll
say it has to be at least 25% busy all year \'round.  For
some shipyards (like Mora) this could equate to huge
orders all of the time, if you believe Trillion Credit
Squadrons applies to the 3rd Imperium -- but that\'s
another issue entirely.

Why be constantly busy?  Because your labor force
generally prefers a year-long job, in order to earn money.
In the case of robotic factories, I\'ll say you don\'t get your
money\'s worth of robot investments unless you run them
most of the time... a credit today is worth more than a
credit tomorrow, and rival worlds would be happy to
take your business...

The main point about the labor force is that (handwave)
it ends up costing you the same amount of money.  When
you pass the information age and replace your workers
with automated factories, you still pay the same costs (now
inflated due to a higher TL) per labor unit.  What you get is
better technology at those costs.

How much do workers cost?  I\'ll say (handwave) Cr10,000
per labor unit per year.  And here\'s where things get very fuzzy
to me.  How many people does it take to build a starship?  This
is new territory for me, but I figure there will be a different labor
crew focusing on each part.

Wait!  What about "off-the-shelf" components?

Okay, I\'m a believer in modular designs, even though most of
Earth\'s industry has trouble standardizing across product lines
for things like automobiles and airplanes.  However, I wonder
sometimes if standardized jump drives (for example) are really
made in advance, or if the shipyard just has plug-and-chug plans
for them.  There\'s no economic benefit to mass production unless
your production facility has a chokehold on some very lucrative
markets... in general, I think most starports don\'t have lucrative
markets for starships.  I haven\'t done many numbers, but I\'d
like to see some, to see where I need to change my assumptions.
This is an exercise for the reader.

Anyhow, labor costs come in, from the off-the-shelf "please
solder here" instructions, to custom-built "let\'s tweak the governor
there to make it 0.1% more efficient".  Labor costs will probably
amount to 1/4 the retail value of the ship.  Hard profit may account
for another 1/2, while 1/4 of the cost will be from parts.  HELP!
I have NO CLUE if these ratios are ANYWHERE NEAR
CORRECT!

Okay now, where are we?  Ah yes, a simple 100-ton Scout.
If you bought a brand new one for Cr12,000,000, where does
all that cash go?  If we assume Cr3,000,000 go to labor, and
the ship takes 9 months to build, that may be Cr400,000 per month
for labor alone.  If we assume there\'s one dude per displacement
ton working on the ship, then that\'s 100 guys at Cr4000 per
month apiece.  Cr36,000 per year... a great salary, and reasonable
for the engineering tasks (and is of course the average between
the bigwigs and the grunts).  But 100 guys?  Gimme a break!  What
would they be working on?  Union beer bashes?

Well, let\'s get 5 guys working on the jump drive.  Let\'s have
another 5 on the power plant, and another 5 on the maneuver
drive.  Next, the hull.  Lots of gravitic-related things going on there,
so we\'ll have a team for the grav plates, another team for the shell,
and a team to tie it all together.  Say another 15 total.  Now for life
support, say 5 for the systems and 5 to put the rooms in.  Put 5
people to work on the ship controls, and 5 people total for the sensor
installation.  We\'re up to 50 people.

What\'s left?  Well, the fuel systems might be 5 people.
Avionics or the computer might be another 5.  Weapon systems
could be another 5.  Now we\'re almost done.  Add 3 teams of
inspectors (overkill) and 5 managers and you have 85 people,
at least 20 of which will be getting twice the normal salary.  So
there\'s your Cr300,000 per month.

You want to trim that number down?  First, these tasks are
not all parallelizable (that\'s one reason the ship takes months
to build, eh?), so there aren\'t 85 people working on the ship
all at one time.  However, I\'d probably pay these people as
if they were really good starship engineers (level 5\'s: Cr6000
per month?), so the labor cost is defensible at

    Labor cost: Cr3000 per dton per month of construction

As I handwaved earlier, parts will cost Cr1000 per dton also,
and the retail markup is at least 50% of labor + parts... and
might be 100% ... or more!

But for my assumptions, a 100t starship that takes 9 months
to build would therefore cost:

   Labor: Cr4000 * 100 dtons * 9 months = Cr3,600,000
   Parts: Cr3,600,000
   Profit: Cr7,200,000

In other words, the cost of construction of a starship is

   Cr8000 per dton per month

and the price tag is twice that.

Subject: Jump Limits

If jump capability is delimited by gravity, 100D must be an
approximation
based around a \'typical mass\' and the gravity a certain distance from
the
mass.

So, anyone fancy a go at calculating the minimum gravity threshold
after
which jump is safe?

I suppose what I\'m getting at is that in some system 100D will be fine.
In
others *maybe* 95D. In a really bad one 100+D

Is a star less dense than a planet, and does this make the limit
closer?

Anyone more gearheaded than me want a go at this?


Dom

An alternative is to remember that all things Jump related are VOLUME
based instead of mass based.  Thus you need to have 100 dtons of ship
minimum, and the 100 diameter limit is based on the VOLUME of the
planet/star/body.
Just another thought process coming from left field...

100d probably _isn\'t_ directly gravity based; if you assume it is mass-based,
100D only works if one assumes tidal force, not gravity.  In the case of tidal
force, it works out to a tidal force of about 1.6 x 10^-9
newtons/kilogram/meter.

Basically, to go with Canon you have to work with rate of change of gravity
intensity, rather than absolute intensity.

If you try to use absolute gravity intensity (Earth standard) then:

solid planets:

 61 D Mercury
 96 D Venus
100 D Earth
 62 D Mars
 27 D Pluto

gas giants:

 160 D Jupiter
 103 D Saturn
  95 D Uranus
 105 D Neptune

Stars:

 528 D        Sun
 57,735 D     Earth size White Dwarf (1 solar mass) - 8.3Gs at 100D!
 43,000,000 D minimum mass Neutron Star (20km diameter - 1.4 Solar Masses) - 4.8
million G at 100D!
 4.5E12 D     minimum mass black hole (6km diameter - 3 solar masses) - 100
million G at 100D!
 3.7 D        "small" red giant (1E12 km diameter - 1 solar mass)


Formula is SQRT(object mass in earth masses)*earth Diameter/object diameter*100

I reiterate my first question "What EXACTLY is a misjump?"

There\'s a WHOLE bunch of things that can go wrong with a jump.  Are they all
misjumps?  Or is a misjump only the specific mishap where you get flung off
to an unknown parsec?

Or to real-world drop tanks - which are pretty much a military-only item.
Carried tanks could extend the ranges of jetliners by 20%, which is not at
all negligible, but don\'t seem to be popular. Similar, in rocket design,
our current rockets in some sense operate with drop tanks, and there\'s an
enormous effort to develop single-stage-to-orbit vehicles with no 
disposaable components, for perceived likely price savings even if the
vehicles are much bigger than their drop tank counterparts.

could service ANY new (i.e. post drop tank technology) ship design

> Just taking a step back from your current debate - couldn\'t

They are NOT like real world drop tanks  - real world vehicles
continue to consume fuel for the full duration of their flight.  Rocket
designs are closer, and prove how different things would be...
Like Bruce pointed out, our current rockets, in a sense, operate
on drop tanks.  While there is an effort to develop craft without
disposable tanks, the effort would not be considered if the current
"drop tanks" were completely reusable... which Traveller drops
tanks appear to be.

Reusable leads to generic standards and common designs.
Provided you accept the use of drop tanks, what arguments
could be made to prevent this?

Maybe they bring higher tech medicine to less developed areas (both
inside and outside their own state), and help deal with epidemics and
large-scale things (e.g., earthquakes).  I think that the UN or WHO had
a ship that did that in the 1960s -- or maybe the 1960s was just the
last time I thought about it.  

The military applications are obvious, of course.  While your fleet\'s
ships can each handle casualties, it\'s probably more efficient to get
them out of the sickbays of the battleships and cruisers (where they\'re
likely just in medical low berth, anyway), and get them some real care. 
I see hospital ships as part of the batch of fleet tender vessels --
with the tankers, the missile supply ships, the repair ships, etc.

It doesn\'t make any difference where obstacles might be.  When you jump,
you\'re not travelling in a straight line through normal space.  If
you\'re in normal space at point A, and there is an object at point B,
and on the other side of that object is point C, you can jump directly
from A to C.  You don\'t pass through B, because B is in normal space,
and you\'re in jump space, which doesn\'t correspond to normal space.  

As far as we know, there are no other objects in jump space.  We can\'t
see anything in jump space, nor get results from other sensors.  There
are no collisions in jump space. There is no communication through jump
space.  Even if your whole fleet is jumping with you, you are all out of
touch with each other until you reemerge in normal space.  

(The hex map just represents jump space, anyway; it doesn\'t represent
normal space.)

> the way you precipitate out, and emerge after a week next to Jupiter. 

Now precipitating out of jump space is a different matter.  If you
program your jump to bring you out of jump space and back into normal
space at a point that is too close to an object, you\'ll precipitate out
of jump space at a safe distance from the object.  That\'s true no matter
what the object is; if it\'s in or near your point of return to normal
space at the time of your return, you\'ll come out of jump space 100
diameters away from it.

Going into jump space too close to an object has a different result. 
You run the risk of misjumping -- not jumping at all, being destroyed,
or going into a jump that puts you back in normal space in a more or
less random place and time.

I think Bruce was referring to something from T5, called "Jump Masking."
This is it from a T5 post made earlier...

"A jump must be planned before it is executed; this
planning is the duty of the astrogator. Planning a jump involved plotting a
straight line course from the jump point to the breakout point.
 Restrictions. Jump cannot take place within 100 diameters of body
(star, gas giant, world, planetoid, or even another ship) larger than
itself.
 If a plotted course intersects a 100 diameter sphere around any
object larger than the ship, the ship is \'precipitated out\' of jump space."

Hope this helps...

That just came up on RASFS. Consider the effects of trying to turn the
"moon" quickly....

a=4*pi^2*r/t^2
a = acceleration (meters/sec^2)
r = radius (meters)
t = period of rotation

For the Moon r=1738000. Let\'s say you are willing to wait 10 minutes
(worst case) to be able to aim at something. That makes t=20 min = 1200
sec.

a = 4*pi^2 * 1738000/1200^2
a = 47.6

So you\'ll have an acceleration of close to 5 gees at the surface. Oops!

If we restrict turning rate to the point where the acceleration is
only 1/6th g, then it\'ll take 2.8 *hours* to swing 180 degrees. 

I think we can dodge that pretty easily.

There are a few more items you may want to include before taking
that profit.
Allocation of overhead costs, such as 
Cost of a place to build it
Cost to power the building site
Cost to market the ship, such as advertising, salepeople salaries,
   market researchers, communication staff, artists
Cost to design the ship
Cost of doing business such as licenses, taxes, inspection permits, legal
Cost of workers tools, furniture, computers, communication and equipment
Cost of administrative staff, executive staff, accountants, janitors, etc
Financing costs, interest, bank fees

Alot of these costs would be fixed costs and some are variable, but the more 
ships you produced the more these costs could be spread out
These would all have to be taken  into account before determing your net profit

I\'d say that all malfunctions of the jump drive that result in the ship
leaving normal space are "misjumps". If you don\'t leave normal space
it\'s a "failure".

Well, consider that it *might* be one of those things where there\'s
enough life support for fewer people than are on the ship. *That* will
get ugly. 

I also seem to recall at least one version of Traveller that a misjump
table where the external and internal durations of a jump could be
different. 

So you come out of a misjump after a week ship\'s time only to find
yourself in the *4th* Imperium. :-)

IMTU, travel is instantaneous once the ship enters jumpspace, but it
takes +/-168 hours for the "jump bubble" to collapse allowing the
ship to emerge.  

If that asteroid/planet/whatever is masking the route at the instant
of jump, then that is where the ship will emerge one week later.
The obstruction will *usually* have moved away along it\'s normal
vector by millions of km.  So, even *finding* what caused the
premature exit might be a difficult task.

As Jim MacLean mentioned, you can have more jumps per year than 24.
And by having some of the calendar related expenses tied to number of
jumps, you unnnecessarily confuse the issue.  So I suggest, calculate
average income and expenditures per jump, then aggregate that to an
annual rate, then factor in annual costs such as mortgage, etc.

Hmm...  My Jane\'s Advanced Tactical Fighters computer game aircraft

Pulse wave detonation certainly sounds familiar, but isn\'t ringing any

Its clear when you look at vehicle designs and vehicle design rules.  It\'s 
more than possible the differences are fudged over due to practical issues 
(though only till FF&S), but the capabilities of a Trepida grav tank are 
pretty well established in every version.

The how is just window dressing.  I don\'t give a hoot.  Maybe the SoM did go 
beyond reason.  It does in other areas IMO.  What EMS sensors do is plain, 
though.

Well one, canon is usually defined as at least everything by GDW (or that\'s 
my definition anyways), w/ the 3rd party stuff coming along the way.  That 
means
canon does not end w/ CT.  I have very little CT (nor desire it, really), but 
I\'m sure the design of the Trepida includes EMS sensors in any version 
(excepting G:T).

Check the vehicle stats for the Trepida and couple them with the combat rules 
in the version of your choice (especially pre G:T).  It\'s pretty clear 
(explicit in TNE and MT).

You did see hte part where I said I\'ve seen in many games where a TL-12 
Wildbat (much less effective than a TL-15 Rampart) beats TL-9 aircraft, 
didn\'t you?  It happened in the course of my campaigns already.  I can 
provide you with the TNE stats if you want.  The game rules say the space 
fighter will win.  This whole thread has concluded that the space fighter 
will win.  You remain unconvinced though... i\'m not going to rehash 
everything said by everyone.  Read especially what Shadow (aka Leonard 
Erickson) has wrote, though.

That\'s why i\'m asking you to run it in a game, using GURPS.  I\'m fairly sure 
you\'ll see the same results, anyways.  Don\'t need to mess up your campaign.  
Will it cause the sky to fall if you play the aircraft and the GM plays the 
space fighter? There is an existing G:T rampart already.   It\'s fine w/ me.  
You only need a GURPS TL-8 (?) fighter to duplicate the original topic of 
this thread.  Take it up to a GTL-12 atmosphere fighter.  There should be one 
somewhere, shouldn\'t there?  Plenty of GV2 designs that have to be floating 
around the web.  Asking a G:T/GV2\'er would be more helpful than me in your 
specific needs to see what I see w/ TNE.

And it was explicitly shown that everythign you mentioned is in FF&S (and/or 
the TNE rules).  Everything.  There is a good aircraft design system (though 
it doesn\'t *perfectly* replicate the Real World) and mechanics to operate it 
under.

As you yourself have said, things are rarely equal.  If they are, someone 
isn\'t doing their job.  That\'s probably the best way to test it though.  The 
basic point is that an airframed spacecraft is an overvaluable and 
overcapable aircraft of the same TL.  It likely costs alot more than the pure 
aircraft but is a helluva lot more capable.  That\'s what this thread proved.

At least one useful thing has come out of this thread (many, really.  I\'m 
quite pleased with its progress, just like w/ the "Max Accel" which i was 
dubious about, at first).  What you and Christopher Thrash and others have

That does not necessarily lead to a war.  Now who\'s depending on future 
events, anyways?  You say that your campaigns will be ruined, or the 
suspension of disbelief.  Any of your players on this list?  It\'d be very

You can\'t be that forgetful, can you (or are u doing it on purpose)?  
Remember where this thread really got rolling?  If you can\'t, it\'s up to you 
to go back and look.  I\'ll quote if you really need me to, though.

And the one who did says the same thing!  And, of course, despite his 
detailed analysis (w/ numbers... FAR above the WAGs and opinions both of us 
have, 
to say nothing about him being an economist and you not, which is another 
matter), you still "don\'t see how they can\'t" OR you just plain don\'t want 
to, which is becoming quite apparent.  Marc Miller and/or Loren Wiseman could 
tell you and you wouldn\'t believe them either (not that I make any claims on 
their opinions).  You\'re right and everyone else is wrong?  Is that it?  Do 
you care to design a drop tank and non dropped tank equiped ship, and follow 
with an economic analysis (rules up to you, i\'d assume G:T and Far Trader), 
to prove it?

I don\'t mince words, David.  I say what I mean and I mean what I say.   If I 
thought you\'re deliberately doing something as character-dubious as that, I\'d 
have no reason at all to reply to you with anything but flames, if at all.  
I\'d consider you, at best, a troll and treat you as such.

You are making me really start to wonder about that, though.  I\'m absolutely 
positive (w/o even seeing Far Trader) that you are misrepresting it, based on 
teh statements of the very authors (including the one who wrote the relevant 
sections)..  It\'s your intention I\'m not sure of.  I\'m coming to believe that 
regardless of the truth of the matter, you\'re going to continue to believe 
the preconceptions you\'ve drawn, despite the actual facts.

Your previous post seems nothing but a troll, which i\'m not going to dignify

*my* mind that\'s closed to new ideas (namely, the subject of this entire

is not *I* who won\'t even make an attempt for them to NOT destroy my TU (nor 
suspension of disbelief nor the lives of my poor lil PCs).  It is not *I* who 
am making a simple proclamation that they do what you claim they do (yet 
don\'t back up w/ anything but opinion).  Now I haven\'t crunched no numbers, 
either, but thankfully, I haven\'t needed to, as others have.  But they alwasy 
fail to address the crucial bit out that clinches it in your mind, right?

Like I said, a Wild Ass Guess.  Worth exactly the effort you\'ve put in 
actually
proving it.  At least do an analysis w/ some numbers, like others (notably 
Christopher Thrash and Jim Maclean).  I see an MT analysis (again w/ numbers)
that also says there isn\'t a dooming effect on the Traveller economics.  
Noticible, yeah.  Overwhelming?  Nope.

OOOOh.  LOL.  I\'m absolutely positive that Hans has said he doesn\'t think 
it\'s a problem, even if drop tanks do come to dominate the main routes (which 
we have ZERO evidence that hasn\'t happened.  YTU?  It\'s YTU.  The G:T ATU or 
the OTU, nothing at all).  Now was that intentional or not?  Do you really 
want me to cut and paste the quote?

Now which makes the better in-game explanation?  "Oh, you\'ll have to ignore 
this TNS entry.  And all the related entries.  And all mention of this 
incident.  They just don\'t work in my game.  Period."  This of course, 
ignores the fact that the implementation could take decades to complete (as 
you yourself have conceded to).  If they even have the catastrophic effect 
you\'ve claimed (despite the evidence to the contrary).

Nothing since CT (isn\'t just Book 2, also?) has allowed jump drives to get a 
higher jump rating than it\'s number.  A J1 drive will only do J1, regardless 
of the size of teh ship, etc.  Therefore, a J6 drive is needed to make a 6 
parsec jump.  With your J2 trader and drop tanks, you could do 6 parsecs in 
three jumps.  G:T drives go along that pattern IIRC. 

I\'ve also mentioned several times, that it\'s quite feasable you get a bad 
cargo run.  What do you do if you can\'t afford another set of drop tanks? 
What do you do if u misjump?  Can you afford more drop tanks on an 
unprofitable (much less disasterous) run?  And what happens when you can\'t?  

The *only* thing that busts drop tanks is if you allow there to be no or 
minimal internal tankage.  Let the only canon design be your guide...

Common sense would imply that the high point of the change would be in the
center of that, wouldn\'t it?  At least one decade for it to be prominent?  As 
Hans
as said, though he would see the dominance of drop tanks on teh main routes,
there isn\'t any evidence those changes aren\'t taking place.  Again, YTUMV.  
The OTU (nor the G:T ATU) is not yours, though, and I\'m not talking about YTU.

I\'ve said nothing of the sort, nor implied it.  What I *have* said is that I 
consider it a marginal tech, in a marginal canon design (the Gazelle).  The 
people w/ the numbers say it\'s not the economics buster you want it (or 
strawman it) to be.  But I haven\'t seen any numbers from you.  Nor will we.  
Perhaps you\'ve already run them and know the truth already, but refuse to 
accept it.

Ahem, the Instant (or at least Under 10 Year) Destroyer of Traveller

Summer\'s Suspension of Disbelief?  That closer to the mark?  Despite the 
evidence (in G:T Far Trader, no less) given by the very authors of said book 
(well 2 of 3, including the economics one)?

Though the engineering problem is anything but decided (and probably never

drop tanks having the effects David claims).

But it\'s well established that the Gazelles have a miserable reputation, due 
more to their being used in a role unsuitable to their specifications (even 
if the design didn\'t even stink at that), but the impression of the only 
canon drop tank design is very clear, and it\'s not good.

We can well give the 12 years the TNS entry speaks of.  Do Core Bulk 
Freighters have any more detrimental effect than Core Drop-Tank Bulk 
Freighters on the PCs?  Nope.  Are they economically significant to a trader 
sized ship?  The answer is being proven by others to be no, with no evidence 
to the contrary.  Issue some and you might well sway me around.  I,  unlike 
some people, keep an open mind as regards these things (like I\'ve said 
repeatedly, I\'ve never used them, nor the Gazelle) and am interested if I 
should be.  I simply don\'t see them to be the canon/economy busting thing 
their claimed as.

It\'s anything but monolithic.  That\'s not what TNE was about.  To have one 
matter-of-fact answer.  Think that the "Empress Wave" could be an umbrella 
name given to a number of psionic and EM phenomena (just like "Longbow" was 
an umbrella for a large number of Imperial projects aimed at the core, not 
just the single Longbow sensor array, nor even including Longbow II, as RSB 
makes clear) that happen to come behind the wavefront.  There wasn\'t going to 
be an "answer."  Whatever a ref wanted to do, could be done IMO.  The 
adventures and supplements would detail specific things, but only in their 
venue, not anythign all encompassing.  IMO.  YMMV.

Course, what in canon is to say that the *EW* travelling through Vargr space 
*is not* the very cause of their chaotic society?  Note that Cogs & Dogs says 
there were patterns (in the Gvegh area IIRC) of change.  Also note the weird 
psionic Vargr (Roth Thokken, et al).  Maybe the EW is related to the peaks 
and/or nadirs of strange things and great uphevals (or lack thereof) going on 
in Vargr space?  

That\'s even if it\'s not a multitude of phonemona that may or may not be 
interacting at the same time...  Effects that could be completely different 
in Zho space (making them all conform with the status quo, etc) or anywhere 
else, due to the nature of that space, the variable effects of the "wave," 
and hte nature of the sophonts being interacted with.

Here\'s my solution:
We want a handwave that falls back onto the physically unsound but playable
100d rule. We want to take various densities into account and also have
some kind of vague physical explanation.

"The hundred diameters limit is the thing we jumpspace engineers tell
uneducated TAS reporters, children and your average mudballer. It is fairly
accurate most of the time, easy to grasp and of course totally ridicelous.
Think for a moment about the galaxy we live in. The hundred diameter rule
would seem to imply that no ship can safely jump inside a hundred times the
diameter of the galaxy! Clearly there must be somthing wring here.

The simplification of the hundred diameters rule (from now on called 100d
rule) is that it treats all bodies as spherical and with a density of 1.0
earth standards. For these limited cases the rule still holds but for
anything else a more complicated calculation is needed:

The reason why ships cannot jump as easy when inside a deep gravity well is
due to the force of gravity or more accurately the rate of change of
gravity at the point. This rate of change is sometimes called tidal force
or gravity gradient and drops off much faster than gravity. To calculate
the distance from a planet where a safe jump can be performed simply use
this formula:

Js = 1 280 000 km times the cuberoot of the planets mass measures in
earthmasses.

If you know the density of the planet but not its mass use:

Js = 100d times the cuberoot of the planets density measured in earthdensities.

If the massive body isn\'t spherical, set up a reasonably fine mass grid and
calculate the field, then you calculate the gradients between the cells.
Consider this to be your homework until tomorrow but make shure your
massive objects have no rotational symmetry axes.
That\'ll be all today students, tomorrow we will discover why jumpdimming is
just an archaic tradition with no real bearing on modern jump technology."

Andarii Bachmanu, Introductory jump theory, first lecture
Rhylanor 053-1120.



I really think that my solution fits the bill perfectly; it falls back to
the 100d rule in most cases so those refs not interested in the finicky
details can ignore it altogether or use it only as a gamesetting tidbit for
realism but never actually calculate it. I can see no major problems with
it (except that Marc didn\'t like it for whatever reason) so feel free to
use it.

We\'ve been through this before. It turns out that for the "rule of
thumb" to be at all accurate, then the limit must be based on property
of mass that drops off as the inverse *cube* of distance. 

That\'s because the mass goes as the cube of diameter on a body of fixed
density.

It turns out that tidal forces follow an inverse cube law. And it even
makes a strange sort of sense as tidal force is a measure of the *rate*
at which gravity changes. Or, if you prefer a measure of how curved
space is. So like I said, it makes a sort of sense that the safe limit
depends on the curvature of space.

> Is a star less dense than a planet, and does this make the limit closer?

Yes. 

> Anyone more gearheaded than me want a go at this?

The formula is basicly:

X=GM/r^3
X = rate of force change (in Newtons/meter)
G = Newton\'s Gravitational Constant
    6.673e-11 N m^2/kg^2
M = Mass of planet/star (in kilograms)
r = distance (in meters)

So just work it backwards for both 10 and 100 diameters from a size 7
or 8 planet of "standard" density. That gives you values of "X" for
both "risky" (10 dia) and "safe" (100 dia) jumps. 

You then plug those into the formula along with the mass of the new
planet/star and solve for "r".

Alas, Marc Miller disagrees. He\'s used exactly this sort of example in
the past. If the straight line linking your entry and exit point passes
thru the 100 diameter limit of any object, you are dumped out of jump
space at that point.

Alas, Marc has never cleared up details like timing. Do you pop out
early? What if the object is in the way only part of the time taken by
the jump? 

The "simplest" way to do it would be to act as if the ship was moving
along the line at uniform speed. But then if you have something that\'s
in the way at midpoint, do you pop out early? Or do you pop out at the
end of the week? If the latter, *why* did you pop out? After all,
rescaling your movement to the shorter jump, means that you\'d *miss*
the object (unless it was motionless). 

I can\'t come up with good answers and Marc never gave any.

Apparently, the curvature of realspace can interfere with jumpspace.
And according to Marc, the hex map *does* represent realspace.

Sure. "The fixed stars". Or in this case, the directions to the various
other galaxies. No matter how far you move in this galaxy, the
direction of (say) the Virgo cluster (of galaxies) isn\'t going to
change noticeably. 

For that matter, given the size of "known space" in the Official
Traveller Universe, "coreward" is essentially the same direction from
anywhere on the maps.

Well, the simplest way is to assume circular orbits, and use the
formulas in the various expanded world generation systems to determine
the length of the year for each planet. Then all you need is a time
value for *a* time when the planet was at the 0 degree mark. 

Given those two *fixed* figures, you just figure out how many *days* it
has been since the zero time, divide that by the year, and covert the
remainder to the fraction of an orbit it is around its orbit at the
current time. 

Me, I plan on "cheating" and just assuming that all planets were at the
zero position at Julian Day #0 (noon, GMT, 1 Jan 4713 BC). But any
software for world design/system storage should have a field for "time
of perihelion passage" as part of the orbital elements. 

You can make up system maps for more frequently visited systems with
orbits marked with degrees. Just place planet counters on the orbits. 

I\'d like to have a program that keeps track of all this stuff, and
allows for plotting courses both inside systems and between them.

It\'d probably be best to write it "generically" with the ability to
convert things like planet info into the stats for various game
systems.

For the record, Jim is the economist and created those sections of the
rules (something I would never have wanted to attempt, even if I had the
background). I\'m the ship operations guy, though, so I did all the initial
modelling of ship expenses, profits, breakeven points, etc.

Jump masking was built into the models from the beginning, using the
average added travel time of 30.6 hours (at 1g). Jim is right: most ships
still manage between 30 and 35 jumps per year.

Say rather that the Beowulf is meta-designed for *roleplaying* -- fat,
guaranteed profits do not lead to desperate measures, which are the stuff
of adventures. It is *possible* to make a profit with a Beowulf under the
standard Far Trader rules; it is deliberately very difficult to do so.
Specifically, you are driven towards passengers and speculative cargo,
which are more interesting from a roleplaying standpoint. This (according
to Loren Wiseman) was inherent in the design from the beginning, and we
respected that intent.

[By the way, the ship operations costs in Far Trader do average out about
the same as the Cr100/dton/week in GT -- I adjusted them that way. But
that\'s assuming you pay full price for every possible category. By doing
some of the work by hand (which takes time, and eats into your profits) you
can avoid many of the fees. Also, be sure to note the Terms of Shipping,
and who pays for what.]

	Big ships are more efficient at all jump ranges.  Far Trader says that 
an important way tramp ships make their money is by taking advantage of 
temporarily high prices.  J-1 ships have a shorter range and therefore fewer 
opportunities to take advantage of good opportunities.  In general, this 
makes it more difficult to earn a living as a tramp.  The Beowulf can\'t 
compete with shipping lines because it doesn\'t have the scale economies and 
it\'s not a very good tramp because it isn\'t economical to haul cargo in a J-
1 ship further than one parsec.  This limits their potential destinations to 
just one parsec from their current world, whereas J-2+ ships can accept 
cargos for worlds many parsecs and many jumps away.
	The prices for 1 parsec tramp freight in Far Trader were set by a 
model 200-400dt J-1 freighter.  The biggest secret to making money as a 
Beowulf owner is to make more than 24 jumps per year.  Using Far Trader 
rules it\'s not at all difficult, and a skilled captain who managed to make 
35 jumps per year could make quite a good deal of money.

Well, I figured out a way.  I figured that most of the jump was taking place in
"deep space" where gravity was "near zero".  Even in deep space, your own ship\'s
mass and stray hydrogen molecules prevent absolute zero gravity.  Then I assume
that your velocity in jumpspace is inversely proportional to gravity.  Thus, you
end up covering the largest part of the trip in nearly no time.  The only thing
that slows you down is the time spent in the gravity well of starsystems  and
other gravity bodies.  It takes about half a week to accelerate out of a gravity
system and half a week coming back in.  Thus it doesn\'t make a significant
difference where the jump masking object is as far as time goes.

	I agree, but the feeling was that things were complicated enough 
already.  I wouldn\'t be hard to figure out how much more expensive such 
freight would be.  Simply add the average daily operating cost per dton of 
freight to the average price for a particular world for every day the world 
is masked on average.  This can be determined by using the ship types that 
commonly call on a world and the masking rules.
	As for the Beowulf, even a few more jumps a year is going to make it 
break even.

	Using the Merchant template from GT, you can increase revenue by 10% 
just by using the Merchant-15 on your final price rolls.  Using the other 
tricks in the book should help at least that much.

	I don\'t know a rules system that the Beowulf _wasn\'t_ broken for.  I 
can remember having had this conversation about how it was impossible to 
make money in a Beowulf for both CT & TNE.  I missed the MT-era but I 
wouldn\'t be surprised if it was true for that rules set as well.  The 
Beowulf was designed for the dramatic plot device of a very small merchant 
ship capable of being run by a group of PCs.  Fortunately for us, there\'s 
another ship that fits this description that _is_ profitable and, IMHO, more 
fun -- the Empress Marava.
	Let me point out that I didn\'t set out to make the Beowulf "broken" 
for Far Trader rules, nor is it merely a rules artifact.  The simple fact is 
that any possible economic role you can imagine for the Beowulf can be done 
better by another design.  Significantly, one of the places where the 
Beowulf can make money without too much trouble is in groups of Frontier 
worlds.

How do you figure 20,000Cr per jump in berthing fees?
	From Far Trader page 66:
	Berthing fee -- Cr20*200dt = 4000Cr
	Starport fee -- Cr500
	Total		 -- Cr4500

	I\'m guessing that you\'re making the ship pay for freight handling.  
Unless they\'re hauling speculative cargo, this is the responsibility of 
either the buyer or seller, as discussed on pg. 54 under Terms of Shipping.

Much Further..."

	Once again, I\'m no physicist, but I though that the

	Thus, the mass of the planet is what counts, and a

And don\'t forget that all starports are Imperial territory. The Imperium
is also going to get its share of taxes, fees, etc. I can then
manipulate the amount of its taxes/fees/whatever in an attempt to
monitor and control the number of ships built at specific starports.
Such economic control is just too powerful for the Imperium to pass
on. Even a tenth of a percentile represents a great deal of CrImps
when levied on a busy construction \'port building relatively large
ships.

I assumed that the orientation of each system\'s "flattened disk" set of
orbit trajectories be completely random. Therefore, the coreward
orientation vector should be random (have its own seed). And I\'ve
assumed up to a 15 degree angle above or below the disk for each
individual orbit. Reasonable?

My past attempt was even weaker than your cheat. It BASICly (pun
intended) asked you for the masses in each orbit, assumed circular
orbits and single stars and spat out positions and velocities for
whatever time you asked for.

There was no data storage. It required a lot of command line data input.
But it worked.

My intended redesign would include 
   User specified coordinate systems i.e. planetary or solar reference
   Automatic G-Burn calculations for transfer orbits
   Automatic G-Burn calculations planet to orbit / orbit to planet
      (and how many type of orbits I want to automatically calculate)
   Storing everything in arrays and writing a reference file format
   Full 3-d visualization (this is the show stopper for me, numbers I
can deal with)
   
Shadow again:

I would welcome any suggestions for a robust generic system
specification. Prferably one that didn\'t require hex to base ten lookups
all over the place. 

Before I starting working in the software industry, I would run
willy-nilly writing software and adding features. Now I try to get a set
of requirements and designs before I start coding. At least before I had
some software.

Obviously the OGTU has seen fit to ban the use of drop tanks by using a
device explained in GURPS Ultra-Tech 2. Which to paraphrase is to ban a
technology already existing in the game by having it develop some previously
unknown flaw. So you can let your players use drop tanks if you want or let
them have them and blow them up if you don\'t want. (Which you\'re free to do
anyway :) ).

As an aside it didn\'t mention use of drop tanks by the military at all,
though the description of how jump technology works in G:T would seem to me
to indicate that jump tank would have to be of the take them with you when
you jump variety that I have always espoused. (Increases your range between
refuelings.)

As another aside jump technology has always IIRC included the requirement,
or feature, that the jump engines on a ship be overpowered so that a jump
drive was capable of transporting a displacement volume larger than the ship
itself. This was explain somewhere (I can\'t remember where) as justification
for being able to drag another ship along through the jump. I think this was
covered in one of the corsair adventures. Anyway this would allown the extra
displacement of the drop tanks to be added to the ships. I do beleive that
this effects J distance.  As I said in another post we don\'t usually use\'em.

Subject: Villani Repository of All Knowledge??

I\'m desparately searching for additional information about the AAB.  
Specifically, I\'m wondering what role it plays in the Spinward Marches,
circa 
1120.  Milleu 0 is an awesome resource, but of course, is set in a
different era.  
Are there publications past or present that would be a good resource? 
Or, am I 
to assume that the lack of information for later eras means that it
plays a 
significantly smaller role in the Third Imperium?

Check the Travellers Digest magazine (by DGP).  One of the early issues
(5 I think) had information about the AAB in connection with a grand

I beleive you\'re referring to Project HOPE.  They did have a full-sized
hospital ship that visited virtually every port in the third world.
The entire operation was run on donations.

The U.S. Navy has two hospital ships: AH-19 Mercy and AH-20 Comfort.
Each contain 12 fully-equipped operating rooms, a 1,000 bed hospital
facility, radiological services, medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an
optometry lab, a cat scan and two oxygen producing plants. Both vessels
have a helicopter deck capable of landing large military helicopters,
as well as side ports to take on patients at sea.

Stats for the Mercy Class are:

Conversion: National Steel and Shipbuilding Co., San Diego, Calif.
Power Plant: 2 GE turbines; two boilers; 24,500 hp (18.3MW); one shaft
Length: 894 feet (272.6 meters) 
Beam: 105.6 feet (32.2 meters)
Displacement: 69,360 tons (70,473.10 metric tons) full load 
Speed: 17.5 knots (20.13 mph)
Aircraft: Helicopter platform only
Crew: 63 civilian mariners, 956 Naval medical staff, and
      258 Naval support staff

Use this as a framework for an IN hospital ship and then use whichever
set of ship design rules (MT, FF&S, etc.) suits you to complete the design.

Only if the fighter  come into the atmosphere directly overhead.  Then it\'s
a case of who shoots first and truest.  With any angle there will be blind

Why would you need to turn the moon?  Turn the weapon or divert the beam
with a wave guide.  Or us a meson gun and shoot though any part of the moon

Actually it would.  I have nearly zero free time these days and it is likely
to remain so for another month and perhaps two months.  RL can be a pain.
Also most of the groups I have played with over the years have a very low
tollerence for things not directly involved with the current game.  Free
time is precious.  I hope that after the current RL problems clear up I can
start a new group and perhaps restart another older group but at the
momonent I\'m limited to one group that would not be interested in this
experiment.

Actually this thread has \'proven\' nothing only discussed.  We have not set
criteria for a test and now that I have attemped to do so you say it\'s
pointless?  What gives?  \'More capable\'?  Under what conditions?  Can a TCS
beat a TC defense force?

By the way I conceed that a 100mcr space fighter is likely to beat a 20mcr
air plane but what about a 100mcr one or 5 20 mcr air planes?

A British company has developed a technology which allows
the use of flat panels of material as a speaker diaphram.

Some of you may have heard of this technology but the
breakthrough is a single flat panel of *rigid* material
can now be used as *multiple* diaphrams. The technology has
reached the point that the transparent screen of a laptop
PC can be used as the PC\'s speakers, including a subwoofer,
without degrading the video. It can also be used to turn
car doors, cinema screens, picture frames, etc. into speakers.

There is still some work to be done but Phillips, Blaupunkt,
and other audio companies are jumping onboard. This
technology is inexpensive and will be commercially available
_this year_!

ABC\'s story on this technology is available at:
http://www.abcnews.go.com/

Scroll down to the "Technology" section and select the link
entitled "Flat Panel Speakers Sound Off."

What\'s so incredible about this breakthrough is that if
the panels can give off sound, they\'ll soon be able to
pick up sounds from the environment (i.e. your voice).
Once this happens, say "goodbye" to microphones and "hello"
to arm-mounted computers you can carry on a conversation
with.

Just like in Traveller.

Here\'s a suggestion:  according to G:T, the Rampart (GTL 12) is about
14MCr.   According to Star Mercs, the Intrepid Class Grav Tank (GTL12) is
about 15.6MCr.  

Seems to me that at GTL12, about 15MCr is probably a reasonable cost.

Alternatively, if you want GTL10, the Irmada is about 5MCr, and the
Instellarms Light Grav Tank is 4MCr. (The Medium is 8MCr).

Again, GTL10, 5MCr  seems to be reasonable.  

Unfortunately, I cannot find any published GTL10 or GTL12 atmosphere-only
fighters...

IIRC, it _is_ the 100D volume-based limit.  Regardless of mass.  Don\'t ask
why, it\'s just the way jumpspace works.  :)

For references, you might want to see the Sector General novels by James
White.  I\'ve only read a couple, but they were good.  It centers around a
_huge_ space-based hospital, with facilities (IIRC) for thousands of races.  

It\'s probably a bit overkill for Traveller, but some of the books might
have good plot ideas, especially if you have players that are interested in
medicine.  An ambulance ship might be a possibility...

Actually, both Far Trader and the Marc Miller commentary seem to indicate
that you _do_ travel in a straight line, and object B, if greater than your
ship, will drop you out of jumpspace at it\'s 100D limit.

This of course is rubbish, what was I thinking :(

Jump mechanics must work off distance and have little or no relation to mass to
stick with canon distances.

I meant to say theoretical minimum stellar corpse black hole. 
Smaller black holes are theoretically possible of course.

Under GT, in an equal GTL fighter vs Grav tank duel, using existing designs
(Rampart vs Intrepid at GTL12, or Irmada vs. Instellarms Heavy), the
fighter can _never_ penetrate the Tank\'s armor with it\'s lasers.  OTOH, the
fighter can always stay totally out of range of the tank\'s fusion guns.
Thus, the only weapons that can still do anything are missiles (A SIM-12
can get through the Intrepid\'s side armor almost always), and both craft
have point defense...  This is all without dodging, which means that kills
are even less likely.  Therefore, the two really can\'t fight each other in
a meaningful way.

Alas, Marc Miller disagrees. He\'s used exactly this sort of example in
the past. If the straight line linking your entry and exit point passes
thru the 100 diameter limit of any object, you are dumped out of jump
space at that point."

	I like Bruce\'s interpretation. It makes more sense to me,
	and it avoids all sorts of problems.

"Alas, Marc has never cleared up details like timing. Do you pop out
early? What if the object is in the way only part of the time taken by
the jump? 

The "simplest" way to do it would be to act as if the ship was moving
along the line at uniform speed. But then if you have something that\'s
in the way at midpoint, do you pop out early? Or do you pop out at the
end of the week? If the latter, *why* did you pop out? After all,
rescaling your movement to the shorter jump, means that you\'d *miss*
the object (unless it was motionless)."

	As an added bonus, what if I plot a 1-week, 6-parsec
	jump that intentionally crosses the 100D limit 1
	parsec away? Do I get to do jump-1 in just over 1 day?
	What about sucessful jumps from within 100D: do you
	drop out of jump space when you make it to 100D of
	that same planet?

<snipped>
"Apparently, the curvature of realspace can interfere with jumpspace.
And according to Marc, the hex map *does* represent realspace."

	IMTU masses in real space do influence jump space, but
	there is not a one-to-one relationship between points
	in real space and those in jump space. Thus, it is not
	necessarily the masses on a straight "real space" line
	between A and B that one has to be concerned with.

Note that range for the grav tanks is given for fire in atmosphere; multiply by
50 out of atmosphere (which still gives a max range of only around 2,000
miles).  The major effect of all this is that using a starship for recon over a
battlefield is a _bad_ idea, as a grav tank can punch holes in the armor of a
heavy cruiser.

Here\'s my shot:

Jump Projectors are high TL devices.  Jump space has specific physical
characteristics, sometimes explained through the metaphor of "the weave".
For our explanation we will assume the GT explanation is OTU. The spacecraft
is contained by a bubble of hydrogen to isolate it from Jump Space during
the jump. (This is where much of the fuel consumed during jump is used. The
bubble is maintained by adding small amounts of hydrogen during the time in
Jump Space.)
The use of a hydrogen bubble is purely a specific technological answer to a
physics problem. i.e. isolating the \'real space\' containing the spacecraft
from the general environment of Jump Space. Any number of other methods
might be used.
For example a Jump projector might project a ship into jump space by opening
the weave and then create a force field around the ship to isolate it from
Jump Space as it closes the weave. Obviously meant to be a nonlethal weapon,
or not a weapon at all.
Perhaps a Black Globe can provide the same jump space/real space isolation.
Which would explain why hydrogen is not required when using a Black Globe to
jump. (After all Black Globes are TL16 (GT) technology.)

Which has some interesting implications for non-spherical bodies.

Eg on Earth you could jump closer by climbing up above the poles.

AHL refers to Azhanti High Lightning, a class of 60,000 ton cruisers. 
GDW published the deckplans in 15mm scale with an individual-level
combat game (called Azhanti High Lightning).  The Arrival Vengeance is a
Lightning class cruiser in the TNE module of the same name.

Has anyone written the GURPS stats for this ship yet? I would love to see

Type CF Azhanti High Lightning Class 60,000-ton Frontier Cruiser  -  TL
11

The Azhanti High Lightning is woefully obsolete by Imperial Navy
standards and
was declared surplus in 1048. Although no longer fit for action in the
line of
battle, several were transferred to the IISS for it\'s uses. While middle
sized by
Imperial Navy standards, this is far and away the largest ship that the
IISS
operates and is considered a highly prized posting.

Taking advantage of it\'s long legs and significant armaments, the IISS
uses it\'s
AHLs to search for viable routes across the rifts and to patrol systems
that
have been interdicted for the protection of their indigenous life.

The AHLs in IISS service retain their fittings and capacitors for a
black globe
generator, though the generators themselves were retained by the
Imperial Navy.
The AHL is manned by 395 scouts, 150 commandos of the IISSs Special
Services
Section (S-3), and up to 80 pilots, depending upon the mix of small
craft on
board for a given mission.

The AHL Class does have fuel scoops, but these are only for use in the
most
extreme of emergencies, due to the ship\'s unstreamlined configuration.
Refueling
is done ordinarily by the ships 4 fuel shuttles.

All but one of the missile bays were converted into lab spaces. The
remaining bay only caries probes and other non-weapon ordinance.

I haven\'t seen T5, nor Far Trader, but this appears to be a change in
canon, and it will make jump travel more difficult to implement.  I
don\'t think I\'ll follow it in my Traveller universe.

Which has some interesting implications for non-spherical bodies.

Eg on Earth you could jump closer by climbing up above the poles.

Dom
>>>>
The difference should only be a few tens of miles IIRC.  It is true
that the spinning of the not-quite-inflexible Earth creates what I have
heard called an oblate spheroid.  The differrence was nowhere near even
a tenth of a diameter I am pretty sure.  I don\'t have the exact
measurments to hand though...
If we continue to follow this path, then some other possibilities come
to mind.  Assume for a moment you have a very large ship (100 000 dtons
to match what I calculated with in a previous post).  A 458 ft diameter
sphere would contain that dtonnage.  You would need to be 8.67 miles
away from it in any direction to jump if you were a smaller ship (say a
100 dton scout).  If on the other hand you had a very long and thin
ship, the numbers would change.  For instance, if your 100 000 dton ship
were 1 dton high, 4 dtons wide, and 25 000 dtons long (just to be a bit
ridiculous), you could jump from 300 meters above the ship, 1200 meters
to the side of the ship, or 3 750 000 meters from the ends of the ship. 
The long-thin measurements are based on a  CT dton measurment of 3
meters tall, 3 meters wide, and 1.5 meters long.  [Anti-flame note:  I
know I have different measurements systems used here, but I would rather
not bother converting back and forth when I have a figure in one
measurement system in my head.]
Anyway, as my (extreme) example shows, this way of looking at things
can have some wild effects in extreme cases, but most bodies you could
consider nearly spheres from 100 diameters away.  On the other hand,
this does encourage the idea of Jumping from and to a spot outside of
the ecliptic to minimize real space transit time and minimize the issues
of Jump masking.

If anyone can get a single pane, no macro version of an Excel 95 (or

ClarisWorks 5 for us non-Excel MacOS users).

Otherwise, when I get the mythical free time I\'ll do it myself. I\'m just

Hmm. We have disclaimers in the BITS free stuff by Rob Prior, such as 101
Starships Release 2 (http://www.bits.org.uk/ on the archive page).

There is someone at SJG who deals with licencing (Reese?) and you can
probably find the contact on their website.

Here\'s what I would suggest: You do follow a line in realspace that has a
1-to-1 relationship with your path in jump space. If your realspace route
intercept an obstacle along the way, your ship is "grabbed" and held
immobile for the rest of your time in jumpspace. When you emerge, 7 days
after entering jumpspace, you are at the jump limit of the object.

So if there is an object at the halfway spot 3.5 days after you enter jump,
you will get caught. If it\'s there before or after that time, you avoid it.

I prefer the old interpretation of how jumps work, but I do think the model
above will solve the problems you raise.

Right. They can be built at any starport capable of building jump ships,
so the logical inference is that they are TL 9 (or less).

I disagree. Just because your society is TL X dosen\'t meant that you know
how to make everything that is possible to make at TL X. It just means that
IF you know how to make it, you can. Fusion+ was an example of this.
Something that the Rule of Man could have made if they had known how to,
only they didn\'t, because no one had found out how. Similarily the special
capacitors needed to make drop tanks practical wasn\'t invented until the
late 11th Century TI.

Right, but just how many would depend on economic details that hasn\'t been
explored yet.

The company is called Ballard Technologies.  They\'re just down the road from where
I live.  Daimler / Chrysler have already produced a car using the Ballard Cell,
Ford and GM have also invested money into the company.  I beleive the vehicle
produced by Daimler / Chrysler is the "EV4"  or "EVA4"

I\'ve driven behind one of the busses there are three or four of them operating here
and three or four working for the Chicago Transit Authority.  Interesting note /
effect for a game, because these vehicles produce only water as an exaust they
leave big trials of steam behind them on cold days...

Jump limit based on gravity is not a new idea. It may even classify as a
Done To Death item, since Peter (below) says it was first posted to the
list in Jan 1995. As you can see, the last time it was posted was October
last year. I dug it out of my files for Dom\'s sake, and he suggested that I
forward it to the TML as well.

From: "Peter L.S. Trevor" <ptrevor.trisen@zetnet.co.uk>
Subject: Jumping from zero planetary diameters (long)

Going through some old disks I found a draft  document  that  was
posted to the TML back in January 1995.  Anyway, I finally got it
finished it and thought it might be of interest.



Jump Drive and the 100 Diameter Limit
=====================================

Here\'s a thought or two ...

1) The jump drive\'s  "100  diameter"  safe  jumping  distance  is
   supposed to be due to the gravity from large masses  affecting
   the ability of the jump drive to form a jump field  correctly.
   But gravity will vary with  planetary  density.  According  to
   "From Port to Jump-point" (JTAS 22) this number is a thumbnail
   rule anyway so what\'s the real rule?

2) In  MT  the  jump  task  is  \'Routine\'  outside  this   limit,
   \'Difficult\' between 10 and  100  diameters,  and  \'Formidable\'
   within 10 diameters.  Each of these are a gap of 4 on the dice
   roll, yet  the  effect  is  described  as  gradual  ("Starship
   Operator\'s  Manual  Vol  1")  ...  so  does  that   mean   its
   \'Difficult+2\' at 50 diameters?

I propose that the phrase "100 diameter limit" is merely  a  rule
of thumb provided by ship\'s pursers to their passengers and  that
seasoned space travellers have a more accurate value for the  MSD
(minimum safe distance) to form a jump point.

First some  boring  math  so  you  can  follow  my  reasoning  if
interested (since "G" is used in the formula below, the  unit  of
"G" is expressed in "gees" to avoid confusion)

    Using the formula

        L=64(M/G)^0.5

    and

        R=8D

    from the original LBB rule books  (where  L  is  distance  in
    mapping units, M is mass in earth masses,  G  is  gravity  in
    gees, R is world radius in mapping units, D is world UPP size
    code) you can deduce that 1 mapping unit  =  62.5  miles  (or
    approx 100 km as stated in the original book).  So to express
    the formula for L in miles ...

        L(in miles)=4000(M/G)^0.5

    or put another way

        G=M/(L/4000)^2

    Not wanting to be too terra-centric lets pick  Vland  as  our
    reference example.  (As an aside the specified mass for Vland
    given in "Aliens Vol 1: Vilani & Vargr" is incorrect -  given
    a diameter of 14,850 km and a density of 1.02 the mass should
    be 1.5661792.)

    So G at 100 diameters is 2.94185e-5 gees.  Remember from your
    high school physics that 1 gee is 9.80665 m/s/s and  you  get
    G=2.88497e-4 m/s/s.

    Now because the the chance of a world being exact  like  that
    is small lets  use  some  pseudo-science  to  pull  a  little
    slight-of-hand.  The  universally  constant  speed  of  light
    c=2.99792458e8 m/s and so G/c is  9.62322e-13  ...  thats  so
    close to 1e-12 that maybe it should be!  Now say  that  space
    stress is measured in units of S or in this case pS (p=\'pico\'
    =1e-12) where 1pS=3.05703e-5 gees.

    So the 1pS  (\'one pico ess\')  limit  is  the  so-called  "100
    diameter\' limit for  Vland.  Recalculating  back  gives  98.1
    diameters.

So what was the point of all that  (apart  from  wearing  out  my
calculator)?  Calculate the 1pS boundary for Terra  and  you  get
91.3 diameters ... not 100.

Definition: Minimum safe distance to initiate Jump is  any  point
            in space where the  gravitational  stress  factor  is
            less than 1pS.

Definition: 1pS is the stress on space by a  gravitational  force
            of 3.05703e-5 gees.

Okay, so now we\'ve dealt with the first point and  can  add  some
colour to individual systems.

    Note that Sol\'s MSD of 482.6 is equavalent to 4.49 AU (almost
    as far as Jupiter\'s orbit)!

Repeating this process for the "10 diameter" limit  and  we  find
its actually the 100 pS boundary.  Hey, the numbers  go  up  with
the difficulty!  A geometric progression gives a step of 3.162277
or ...

    31,623pS - 100,000pS          Formidable +2

    The MSD column assumes only one distorting object.

So if your players are running for the "100  diameter"  MSD  jump
point while being persued but for feel the need to go early, just
compare their distance with the  table  above  to  determine  the
actual risk at that point.

Another issue:  Are  Lagrange  points  (points  of  gravitational
stability) safe jump points  within  the  1pS  boundary?  No.  In
none of the published Traveller works is  there  any  mention  of
this.  The term  "stress"  is  important,  at  these  points  the
gravitational forces may be in balance but the fabric of space is
still stressed (like the rope in a tug-o-war between  two  evenly
matched teams).  Therefore, even when two or  more  gravitational
sources are balanced their effects are additive.  Compute the  pS
value  of  all  likely  objects  and  add  them  together  before
consulting the Jump Difficulty Table.

     10%     100.000
      5%     400.000

Also note that this space stress does not simply end at 1pS,  but
continues out indefinately getting smaller  and  smaller.  It  is
theoretically possible to be beyond MSD for all objects yet their
combined gravitational pulls to still exert more than 1pS!

    Extended Range Stress Table

        MSD   Stress Factor
       ----
       200%       0.250
       190%       0.277
       180%       0.309
       170%       0.346
       160%       0.391
       150%       0.444
       140%       0.510
       130%       0.592
       120%       0.694
       110%       0.826

For example, at 140% MSD the stress factor  is  0.510.  So  if  a
starship were at 140% MSD for one planet and 140% MSD for another
planet, the total stress factor would be 1.100.  This  makes  the
jump task \'Routine+1\'.

One final issue: When player characters are  feeling  particulaly
suicidal/desperate/destructive they sometimes wonder  what  would
happen if they tried to jump while still landed in the  starport.
On  a  1  gee  planet  the  stress  factor  at  ground  level  is
32,711.463pS which makes such a task \'Formidable+2\'.

... Now you know!

Good question, first I\'ve heard of them, but don\'t feel like digging
through to my copy of "Scouts" (totally buried) to check it.  I just pulled

Book 6, page 6:

  The _Security Branch_ is charged with providing security and law
enforcement for the Scout Service.  Security Branch Scouts serve as
police enforcers on Scout property, as commandos or shipboard light
troops, for special Scout activities, and as clandestine agents for
Intelligence Branch.

In other words, the concept was described in Book 6, although not given
the S-3 name as such.

The fact that the Security Branch falls under Operations, as opposed to
the Field Service, backs up the description of S-3 as a quasi-military
force, since Operations uses a formal rank structure.

Thanks, the AHL writeup was good stuff..  However, I suspect that 150 S-3
scouts is way too many.  I\'d expect a mix of conventional security branch
scouts and a small number of S-3s (maybe three or four 5-8 sophont teams). 
These are very elite troops and should be pretty rare.  

Strictly IMTU, of course, but I\'d be surprised to find 150 S-3 scouts in a
single sector.  If there are more than a couple of teams in a subsector,
something very odd is going on.

The interior is just fine (then again, I\'m only 5\'7"); tickets are -
expensive if you buy scheduled tickets; and runs at a profit.

Of course, Concorde sales were also hit by politics (US firms not
ordering it in favour of the vapourware Boeing SST). Concorde now runs
at a profit for BA.

There is also quite some interest in the next-generation SST. It may end
up being a touch slower than Concorde; but with a higher passenger load.
This is the main snag with Concorde - only 100 seats.

[Drop tanks]

In the RW, military aircraft use drop tanks because there is a military
requirement (more range) that is too expensive to meet by making the
aircraft bigger. Passenger aircraft just get bigger until range isn\'t a
problem. If you have an old aircraft - you have a stopover. If your
marketing team are clever, they sell this as an advantage. The expense
of drop tanks (qualifying wing hardpoints for fuel, ensuring clean
separation, cost of the tanks themselves, risk to the carrying aircraft)
isn\'t worth it for commercial carriers.

        Hi, Robert!
        As a point, in Supp7, the X-Boat design therein specifically has
*no* powerplant...  *every* joule of energy required for jumping comes from
the J-drives.  Further, apparently the computer and life-support do not

This IS the premise that the JTAS Amber Zone "Found" uses. It pits 12
"Foxhound" fighters (ie. F-14\'s) against *three* Ramparts.

BTW, something I noticed when checking out the Striker conversion: the
Ramparts in the scenario are stated as having AF 60. This is NOT POSSIBLE
in Striker - at least, once the errata is applied. Originally, HG armour
factor 0 was equated to Striker AF 60. However, the Striker errata reduced
this to AF 40. Significantly, the Rampart in Referee\'s Companion has 40G
armour, meaning that this is the corrected version. The "Gyrfalcon" missile
(Pen 65) now has an even better chance against the Rampart... and even the
"normal" A2A missiles in COACC might have a chance.

A few interesting things from COACC: COACC contains the TL 15 "Magnum"
fighter - but the rating is in starship format! The technology tables don\'t
really show anything above TL 10, so perhaps the designer also believes the
"air-merges-to-grav" argument and didn\'t bother about adding anything else.

So, if you want to throw two comparisions against each other, use the RC
Rampart and the COACC Magnum and see what you get.

[However, I\'m not sure what rules you would use - MT\'s modified "high
guard" starship rules, or COACC\'s horribly broken air-to-air combat rules].

Yeah, but excepting the high population worlds, the pop density is pretty 
low, w/ most of a world unpopulated excepting a few notable centers.  The 
average Imperial Marquis is not what your comment would make him out to be, 
no?  But rather something comparable to his 17th century, don\'t you think?

LOL.  It doesn\'t sound like there would be many.  I\'ve always had the 
impression that the Imperial nobility didn\'t behave like medieval nobility.  
There isn\'t a "born to rule" philosophy so much, rather than the Imperial 
nobility were well raised and trained well to do their jobs, by the 
priveledge of their upbringing.  But nothing that implies that simply because 
someone is even a Duke\'s child, that he is automatically put in charge of 
armies or fleets, etc.  I can see an automatic commission or something, 
though.  Maybe the enlisted nobles are bastard children or something? 
Embarrassing to have at home, but legally (or culturally) entitled to certain 
rights.  That sort of thing.

I know.  That\'s the only combat of this sort that I\'ve run, which is what you 
asked.
At TL-13, grav vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft (though NOT starships) 
merge and as someone else has pointed out, your \'aircraft\' w/ all the TL-15 
technology and equipment only differs from a space fighter by the insignia on 
the pilots uniform.  (In fact, is part of the world\'s COACC IIRC). 

If you want equal TL (GTL12, I presume), you\'ll need an aircraft design (a 
design that is apocryphal, as far as canon is concerned), which should be 
somewhere, by a GV2 designer somewhere, though G:T\'s specific nuances may be 
needed.

Sure I have, but you don\'t have the gaming group that could do it (u only 
need one person.  One (you) to play the aircraft, one to play the space 
fighter.  TCS? Trillion Credit Squadron?  That\'s far different than the role 
playing scale rules, and is more statistically based rather than skill based. 
 The exact details, I\'m not sure.  A skirmish or raid type scenario, I\'m 
thinking, not anything on a planetary invasion scale.  Space fighter(s) comes 
to give air support or something (and for some reason can\'t do it from orbit 
or beyond) and air fighter(s) move to intercept.  U want them at the same TL, 
fine.  Money?  To have an effective space fighter, it\'ll cost alot more than 
a comparable grav vehicle (which by TTL15/GTL12 canon says is pretty much the 
same thing).  Maybe 2 space fighters vs their equivalent value in atmosphere 
craft.

Ah. I must\'ve missed it.  That\'s what the whole debate was about.  I would 
think the space fighter would at least have a wingman or battle buddy or 
something...  Guessing on prices will only work after the designs are 
possessed...

Or that it\'s the economics system that\'s broken.  The good thing bout it was 
that it was easy and fun to do on the fly, being both random and fast.  
They\'re obviously simplictic, thoug.  How quick was the system before 
Merchant Prince(?)?  How fast and easy is Far Trader to do?

Me 2, though this does raise interesting questions.  Does anything canonical 
void the jump masking? My initial impression on it isn\'t good, but I\'m not 
sure that it violates any previously published materials (though a whole lot 
of assumptions and musings on jump drives and J-space, etc).  It would be 
mostly ignored except when desired for a plot device, wouldn\'t it?  

Plus, the T5 Jump rules that Marc has posted mention an effective velocity 
for each jump drive, don\'t they?  This solves the "empty hex" debate from 
awhile back, too,  meaning any deep station could simply be a rogue asteroid 
or comet or something.

        The first thought I had was it makes jumping "past" a system
impossible.  If your destination is a Jp2 away, and there is a star a Jp1
away in between, you are going to wind up visiting that system even if you
are a Jp2 starship...

A hex is a parsec across.  A parsec is approximately 207000 AU.  Sol\'s
solar system is 150AU across.  On that scale, the chances of the system
being in the line of travel are very small.

A hex is a parsec wide!  ;-> 

As long as the route doesn\'t take the jumping ship through a 201
diameter (100 dia on each side plus the object\'s actual diameter)
dot in that hex you won\'t be trapped by the nearer star.  And if I\'m
not mistaken in my math that\'s approx 1 chance in 70,000,000.
Masking can take place with double stars or gas giants within
systems, but if it happens with stars in neighboring hexes then it\'s
got to be by GM decision...IMO.

Using James Halperin\'s "The Truth Machine" as a source :-
The device appears to combine functional imaging [high res CT or PET], a
polygraph and a sophisticated expert system to determine veracity based
on the \'sensor data\'.

Such devices have never been part of canon AFAIK. The Tech Level
requirement wouldn\'t be terribly steep, given the components described
above.

The closest analogues I can find, rummaging through my Traveller
collection, are :-
TL 14 : destructive memory reading via computer-brain interfaces, plus a
variant from an old \'White Dwarf\' article : ReMemBrE - the Recent Memory
[Brain] Extractor.
This device behaves roughly like a telepathic probe.
TL 16 : crude memory transfer
TL 17 : selective erasure
Tl 18 : partial memory transfer

The primary problem I can see with this sort of gadget is that it
represents a \'psionic-like\' technology which would in all probability be
suppressed in the Imperium, at least outside of top secret research
facilities.

Mark, do you know many are ICU level beds? With 12 theatres, the overall
bed numbers given, the likely caseload of the hospital, and North
American medical culture, I would suspect at least 5, possibly ten
percent of the total....

Some more RW data :-
ICU level care requires 150-250 square feet (13.9-23.2 m2) per bed area.
Allocate 2.5 to 3X this floorspace for support staff, and 100 square
feet per bed for equipment storage.

Ob Trav :-
Assuming overall heights of FF&S \'sickbay\' modules are 3m (overall
volume 112m3), a sickbay module can contain an operating theatre, three
regular ward beds, or two ICU beds.

Additional volume should be allocated for staff areas and equipment
storage.

In my experience, there are only a few basic \'medical plots\'.
i. Disaster scenes (individual or mass casualties, be they from
accident, violence or disease).
Variants include primary presentation (being a rescuer on the scene),
retrieval team, and hospital reception (spending 16 hours working on a
multi-trauma in theatre....) ;

2. Mystery plots (Why did the patient present like that? Are there
suspicious circumstances?) ; and

3. Romance (often highly inappropriate, and in most hospital settings,
not forgotten until long after the relationship [or at best that phase
of it] is well and truly over).

And carbon dioxide surely. The shuttles fuel cells uses hydrogen so it only
produces water but a methanol driven one has to get rid of the carbon

LOL.  Having seen a "Brick" struggle to get off the ground at an
International Air Tatoo (Brit airshow, for those who didn\'t know), wallowing
like a pregnant swan as it lifted with all the grace of the aardvark that it
so closely resembles, then watching an Avro Vulcan (probably about 7-8 times
the size, IIRC) do a take-off run then go VERTICAL as it left the runway, I
know which I would prefer!  I know that may not seem important, but when a
missile is about to goose you, it matters...

Mind you, the Brick does have that rather nifty crew escape module thingy
("Hey look, Ivan, those nice Yankees have given us *another* target!  Two
for the price of one!";})

Onthe other hand, which got scrapped first?  Hmm.

ObTrav:  If "Jet Noise - The Sound Of Freedom" for TL7(ish) Earth, does that
mean that the 3I would have something like "(Contra-grav) Whine - The Sound

My post was not based on the original authors work (in fact I hadn\'t seen
it when I posted) but the most important thing is that my system is NOT
BASED ON GRAVITY and that my system falls back to the original 100d rules
whenever the planet has a density of 1.0.

Was only close to the 100d canon rule when planets where close to one earth
mass and got progressively worse when deviating from that (note that most
Trav planets are less than Size 8). It also got extremely "un-canon"
results for Sol:

So let\'s look at some worst-case odds.  If Sol\'s system is 150AU, then
it blocks an area of:  150AU x 201 = 30,150AU
That is about 15% of the hex:  30,150AU/207,000AU = 0.1456

So the worst case is that 15% of jump-2s across an occupied hex get
blocked.  

We make that case better by noting that the solar system is not as
massive as my caluclation assumes.  To figure out exactly how much of
the hex is blocked, we have to know the solar diameter and the locations
and diameters of the planets located more than 100 solar diameters from
the star.  Then we add (201 x solar diameter) + (201 x diameter of other
planets not in front of or behind 201 x solar diameter) or something
like that.

Well, I\'m too tired to make any sense here; I hope this is helpful in
furthering this discussion.

You\'re quite correct about the Tech Level.  As a matter of fact, the FBI is
currently testing a device which is similiar to what you describe.  The
information I have on how it works is sketchy, as I just saw part of the
story on TLC (...or was it Discovery?).

Investigators use the machine to determine if an individual
recognizes/remembers words, phrases, or images.  They have determined that
the brain produces specific patterns when previously viewed/experienced data
is presented to it.  The machine reads brain patterns (exactly which process
they use I\'m not sure) and simply indicates whether the person recognizes
the object/word.  In this sense, the test is much like a polygraph in that
the test must be well controlled, and the results are subject to
interpretation.  However, in tests, the investigators were able to determine
which individuals in a group were FBI agents, and which were not.  (Without
error)

Given this information, I think it will be likely that the Imperium would
have some type of device which would be helpful to
interrogators/investigators...and this device would also be subject to error
and abuse.

Sparky, carbonated water then...

Seriously, I thought Honda already had an engine (standard internal
combustion) that was \'zero emission\', in fact, in the tests it spat out less
noxious fumes than it sucked in!

Correct me if I\'m wrong, but take a hydrocarbon, add an O2 (ignore the N)
and you get CO2 and H2O.  Incomplete combustion yields CO\'s, NO\'s and in
really bad cases straight C\'s.  With methanol (CH3OH), add some O2 (as
above), you get H2O, CO2, and some NO\'s when you\'re hammering the pedal.
With straight H2, you still get your H2O, and some NO\'s, but no CO2 - but I
dunno if I want to have a rotary tugging my car around... :)

I guess an upside to methanol would be being able to run your car on
windscreen washer fluid.

OTOH, what about a water cycle engine?  We\'ve all seen the blurbs, waited
patiently for the product, and given up in favour of fuel cells, I guess.

Hurry up with them fusion engines!  where can I order a 150kw fusion plant
for my telstar???

These machines work on the premise that all or at least most humans show
the same physiological traits when lying, something that is fairly hard to
believe.

Ob Trav: There is (if memory serves me right) sort of a canon truth-machine
that showed up in GDWs Murder at Arcturus Station. I don\'t remember the TL
of the machine but it couldn\'t be all that high as truth drugs (canon for
shure) effectively eliminate that need for truth-machines.

BTW How does other refs play the use of truth drugs? I give my players 5
minutes of questioning in real time with me as the NPC. I try to be as
forthcoming as possible but extremely dumb as to where the players
questions lead. I also stipulate that you fall unconscious after a truth
drug use, that it is dangerous to take another within 24 hours and that the
questioned will have NO memory of the questioning nor the answers he/she
gave.
In my justice system most courts allow a defendant/witness to voluntarily
take truth drug which tend to increase the wight of your testimonial but
that you\'re never required to do so. The Naval intelligence community has a
special virus which they give their agents that will kill them whenever
they are subjected to truth drug.

The ENTIRE solar system is 150AU, therefore it blocks 150 AU,

Um, isn\'t plotting a Jump course around this stuff what a "navigator"
is for? If memory serves, a Jump course is plotted before the jump
and cannot be changed once Jumpspace is entered. I don\'t believe
there\'s ever been anything published which discusses exactly *how*
the navigator plots the course or what the course entails.

CT\'s use of jump tapes wouldn\'t conflict with this and could
be said to support it, depending on what a GM rules the tape
contains.

        In otherwords, Jump Masking is a Non-Issue.  The only time you need
to worry about it is with a Black-hole, neutron star, a nebula or an

HE!  HE!

Can you see the anguished face of an invading captain after diving into the
atmosphere to escape the unexpected unveiling of a planetiod monitor,

"Damn that was close, but we\'ll be safe in the planets shadow untill the
heavies can deal with that monitor.  Launch the fighters and let\'s do some
damage while we are here!"

Ship shakes, lights dim, and alarms go off all over the place.

"What the hell was that!?, That thing couldn\'t follow us this deep into the
atmosphere?!?!", the captain screams.

"Sir, sensors show a batalion sized formation of grav tank 10 miles ahead on
our current heading!  That impact was the main gun of the closest tank!
Sir, What do we do!", screamed the paniced sensor operater.

"What do we do...we die", said the captain in fatalistic calm.

Sounds good.  As for why they have to be in the atmosophere that\'s easy.

  Reason 1: recon.  Sensor regarless of TL see better when you are closer to
what you are looking at.

  Reason 2: Fire suport:  Infantry support in montainious terain.

  Reason 3: Combat air patrol: over a grounded ship or instalation.

  Reason 4: Attacking a harded site with space capablie weapons.  (Meason
base)  Fly high and die!  Fly low and the big gun can track fast enough.

  Reasom 5: The two space fighter are all that you have. (PC reason).  Your
merc can ouly carry two fighters.  They are all you have available for the
mission as you G carriers and air raft are not available (for what ever reason).

Sorry, I have said this before in different ways and in different posts.  I
thought it might be the \'bone of contention\' so I restated it to be sure.
It was my contention that dollar for dollar the air fighters would win.
Curtainly not ship for ship.  The space fighters would win there unless the
\'air fighters\' were super tanks of equal value when thing get wierd.  The
tanks armor and defenses can be all but impregnable and it\'s gun will be a
one shot one kill on a fighter but it can not \'catch\' the fighter unless the
figther come to it.

Check with the "infinite energy" people (aka the Cold Fusion crowd).
Apparently they have all the energy we need, now, ready to go, and its just
the "Hot Fusion" scientific establishement conspiring to prevent them from
getting the funding they need to develop the stuff (no, really!).

For hot fusion, you don\'t wanna wait that long.  Its probably still 20-40
years from being workable in the big form, never mind something that fits
under the hood.

If the Navigator/Astrogator do the poltting before jumping; why keep him
aboard? You could order jumpplots from starports and jump based on those
without the expense of having an extra crewmember (I know the crew would
get a tad irritated at its cheapscate owner the first time they misjumped
into a system with E-port but...).

An AHL carries four 400tn fuel shuttles, but usually uses one or two

*grin* why do I feel like we\'re back in the G:T Trade and Commerce (oops,
Far Trader) email discussions :)

OK. A 25% cost savings will cause drop tank-equipped ships to rapidly
dominate trade, basically as fast as the infrastructure can be constructed.

Once the infrastructure is being constructed, banks will realise that
whilst an internal-tankage ship is viable now, it will not be viable in
10-20 years time when the drop tank infrastructure is complete.

Their horizon for getting their money back will thus shrink, and therefore
they will need to demand a higher rate of interest on long-term starship
mortgages.

<good stuff and ship, tanks and lighter designs snipped>

Note that the lighters are spaceships and can thus be maintained at
Starport C (class III in G:T terms) starports. They are also (relativly)
low technology, and can easily be carried as cargo to worlds incapable of
constructing them.

Thus, it should be a simple commercial enterprise to build them in mass and
ship them to suitable worlds.  I believe you should be able to find many
high WTN worlds 7-8 parsecs apart with a type C starport in the middle -
for example, you could use either Binges or Mille Falcs to run jump-4 drop
tank equipped ships between Collace and Glisten.

As for limitations, non-express cargo ships would be able to \'book in\'
lighter slots days in advance, trading off convenience in scheduling for
the cost of outbidding the other people interested in booking the lighter
on the same day.

The other issue to consider is that one fuel lighter can support a number
of jump ships - rather than 500 dtons of fuel tankage being idle on a ship
in jump space for a week, it could have gone back and forth three times to
the fuel point (probably the mainworld) and thus refuelled three ships.
Given the cost of fuel tankage in G:T, this is clearly a signifigant saving
on top of the opportunity cost of the cargo space forgone by internally
fuelled ships.

If I had a copy of Far Trader, I\'d crunch the numbers on the
Glisten-Collace run above with internally-fuelled and jump ships. I believe
that jump-4 aided by drop tanks would be more efficent than either jump-4
with internal fuel or a Collace-Mercator- Egypt-Glisten run with a jump-3
ship. I can probably do it anyway, if someone can tell me the average price
of express freight between Collace and Glisten (assume relevant mercantile
skills at 15).

Finally, two dead horses. The red herring about the Spinward Marches being
a backwater has again resurfaced on the list. Guys, the sector has a number
of Hi-pop, Industrial TL15 worlds - Trin, Glisten and Mora to name three.

Secondly, the P-debate. Please dont go there, but remember that if ships
jumping in appear in predictable places, then thats where you put the SDBs
(ships going out go in convoy).

Well not if you consider the 100 dimater rule. Since the diameter of the solar
system in this example was given as 150AU the jump masking to both sides would
be 2*100*150 = 30.000AU.

But if you are going to be scientific about it the solar system actually has a
diameter of over 1000AU, perhaps as large as 1 lightyear. Surrounding the solar
system is the Oort Cloud, millions of objects with diameters from 20km and up to
perhaps 500km. These are also going to pose problems for smaller ships.

Another thought is that you actually could go straight through the solar system
without being inside the 100 diameter of any of the bodies in the system. So
Jump masking vil not work every time.

Jump masking is an issue, because typically you are trying to hit a very
small target (the mainworld\'s 100D limit) while avoiding a very large one
(the star\'s 100D limit) that is very close by.

You are correct, however, that objects in interstellar space are rarely a
problem unless there is a misjump of the misexit variety (or the GM wants
it that way). FWIW, Marc Miller\'s T5 draft says that nebulae are not dense
enough to cause a misexit.

Jump masking has always been a problem for some systems, even if you only
account for precipitation at the immediate destination. The Sun\'s 100D
limit is just inside the Earth\'s orbit, for instance, and for smaller stars
(spectral class G5 and under) the entire life zone is within the 100D
limit. Since the majority of known stars fall into this category, this is a
problem.

What was lacking before was a clear understanding of the *implications* of
the 100D limit, backed up by mathematical analysis.

To keep flogging a rapidly dying horse, the number quoted by Christopher
Thrash was a *25 percent* reduction in freight costs by using drop tanks. I
believe I can increase that further, by ruthless optimisation of the cargo
lighters and tugs (note that fuel is not massy, which means you need less
m-drive than for general-purpose freight), and by owing rather than renting
the lighters.

It will take capital, but the Imperium that has a rate of interest of two,
maybe three percent, so even if the actual profits are a third of projected
profits, we still make about triple the ruling rate of interest.

Minimal impact ... I Dont Think So.

Next, running out of cash to buy drop tanks.

At or about 1150 AD, there was an invention called a Bill of Exchange that
let merchants borrow money. So if, for example, you needed 500 crowns in
cash to pay your crew before they mutinied, you wrote a Bill of Exchange to
a local merchant, and he advanced you the cash.

Later, you paid him back. Or he sold the bill to someone else, and you paid
them back.

By a similar mechanism (or perhaps the modern equivalent, the credit card),
a small cash flow problem will not be a problem in the 57th century,
assuming of course you have some sort of equity to back it up (i.e. you are
already bankrupt).

Bluntly, if you can\'t pony up at least a million in cash at any point, you
shouldnt pretend that you can effectively run a merchant starship.

The movie is quite enjoyable, especially for its production values, special
effects
and action.  But the plot is pure Philip K. Dick.  And not just one work of
Dick\'s
but an idea you can see in a great deal of his work.  Don\'t look too close toward

realistic consequences of the dramatic foundations.  Just enjoy the moving
pictures,
IMHO.

IIRC, in the film they said the human body generates 120V of electricity.
In the movie, humans are great electrical generators.  Not sure if thats true
or not, and I\'m skeptical about the cost benefit analysis of supplying the
necessary nutrients to the bodies.

Well, maybe.  But I think it has more to do with Willpower, at least
generally. I would say that Neo develops Computer Empathy later,
or becomes aware of his ability in it.

I\'m a sucker for anything with a Big Ass Map, and this product has one.
Whole sector on one side, on the reverse, 8 world maps.  5 Pocket
Empires.  Although content wise, it is bare bones, I like it.  However,
the canonicity of JG sectors is suspect, IIRC, because there is different

data for these sectors (Glimmerdrift Reaches, Ley Sector, maybe others).
I say get it though.

> $6.00 Astrogator\'s Chartbook

A waster of time and money, IMHO.  Go get a regular pad of hex paper,
such as those made by Chessex.  This contains, graph, hex, and world
hexmaps
with horizontal lines on the reverse for text.  47 individual pages
equally divided
between graph, hex, and world.  If you want world maps, the only thing
potentially
useful here, go to
http://portcaddo.com/bloo/traveller/Travmaps/
The paper in this product is of _very_ low quality.

> $10.00 Darkling Ship

Part of the Border Prowler series taking place in the Ley Sector.
Involves investigation of a generation ship.  Mediocre at best.
Original price $3.95.  Thats about what its worth today, unless
you just want to collect all things traveller.

Glimmerdrift, thumbs up.
Darkling Ship, so so.
Astrographers Chart, thumbs waaay down.

Actually, in one of the recent ones (Galactic Gourmet) The plot centers

No.   It\'s a non-issue for crossing a hex with a system, but it _is_ an

It seems to me that the current raging debate on drop tanks is getting longer

Would it be possible for you all to:

(1) Trim your responses by limiting the amount that you quote and re-quote 
from the other participants?

(2) Try to keep the personalities out of it (I see a spiraling flame war 
growing)?

or

(3) Take the personalities off-list?

Hmmm...  I just converted one of my players characters from T4 to GT, and
he wanted the limited mate\'s license from Far Trader.  He had good enough
skills (or defaults) for everything but astrogation...  So I let him dump
some starting funds and use bribery in place of Astrogation on the exam....

Note that 100d limit based on tidal flux has also been done a number of times,
though it may have not been around as long.  However, if you\'re going to put
something in the FAQ, use tidal flux, not gravity, because at least tidal flux
resembles the existing rules.

OTOH, who says that a target hit by a jump projector has to survive?
Perhaps the jump projector causes a ship to jump *without any protection at
all.* Thus the jump projector *is* a weapon, and possibly one of the most
deadly ones available.

        Hi, Joesph!
        This is how I do it...  1D+11 for a mis-jump roll...  most of the
time, you are just on the other side of the sector...  other times, you are
spread all over the sector.  Once in a rare while (1 on 1D), you are just
micro-jumped,  intact and in place. 
        And yes, these are truely frightening weapons....  Even if the
victim survives the jump intact, there is no guarantee that there is enough
fuel for life support for the week in between....

OTOH, who says that a target hit by a jump projector has to survive?
Perhaps the jump projector causes a ship to jump *without any protection at
all.* Thus the jump projector *is* a weapon, and possibly one of the most
deadly ones available.

Another possibility: the Jump Projectors we\'re seeing are a poorly

Let\'s say an archaeologist discovers a machine at an Ancients site
that, when lots of power is applied, sends the target of a beam into
a misjump. "Ah hah!" says the Imperial Navy rep at the site, "A Jump
Projector Weapon!".

What he actually has is a partially-functioning Jump Gate, but he lacks
(and doesn\'t realize he lacks) the PsiTech gear that would allow him to
cause controlled jumps instead of misjumps. Failsafes in the design
that create the protective field are misunderstood as part of the jump
effect generation, and included with the copies of the design. Since
advanced Disintigrators already exist (TL17?), there isn\'t any impetus
to figure out a way to make the forcefield fail to protect the target from
jumpspace - a culture working with Jump Projectors already knows how
to make things disappear.

        Hi, Walt!
        Another nicely thought-out concept from you.  This is a very clever

I\'ll bet that\'s true for alot of hapless small-fry traders out there (who 
really can\'t effectively run a merchant starship, but make great adventurers 
and smugglers, etc).  I know my PCs zeroed out the M&R fund more than once 
after expensive repairs, and another disaster (failed or disasterous run, 
more severe damage, etc) in too short a time would\'ve left them screwed and 
desperate (and ripe for another adventure).  Getting a loan or something is 
always a possiblity, but usually from guys who send people to break your 
fingers when you\'re late, and/or taking out a 2nd or 3rd mortgage on the 
ship.  ;-)

IIRC, it wasn\'t that people were such great generators by virtue of 
themselves, but that they were an abundant and easily harvestable source.  
Especially once they start creating "crops."

Yeah.  I\'d buy that.  Especially for the "normal" people in the matrix.  
Otherwise, it would be run w/ your normal skills, etc, but the possiblity of 
bending rules.  Noone was capable of breaking the rules except Neo, even the 
Agents only bended rules, but noone besides Neo and the Agents could move 
that fast, etc.

Glen, Tommy: The solar system isn\'t solid and so doesn\'t have a 
100D limit of its own. As previously noted, we\'re all well within 
the 100D limit of "the galaxy", therefore no one can jump, ever, 
by your argument.

Regarding the "odds of hitting stuff" question, even that rough 
150AU number is almost entirely empty space even after you take 
in the 100D range around all the planets, asteroids, comets, and 
such.

Also, keep in mind Marc Miller\'s statement that the hex maps map 
realspace and jumpspace both at a 1:1 correspondence. If this 
implies that jumpspace has a third dimension, it\'s easier still 
to avoid collisions.

I think ships that expected to jump while pursued or opposed (in 
other words, all PC ships and all military ships) would have a
navigator aboard: what if your jump tape only tells you how to 
get to your destination system starting from a spot on the far 
side of the enemy fleet? An astrogator can improvise; a jump tape 
can\'t.

But see We All Died At Breakaway Station (I\'ve forgotten the author\'s
name), a pulp novel from the 1950s or \'60s in which a big hospital ship
pretends to be a battleship, and, with its two small escorts, charges an
incoming enemy battle fleet and stalls their advance on Breakaway
Station long enough for repairs to be made to allow a subspace or
hyperspace or whatever it was transmission of intelligence information
back to earth.

(The escorts were the Iwo Jima and the Pharsalus, as I recall, but I
can\'t remember the name of the hospital ship.  The captain of the
hospital ship was Absalom Bracer.   He\'d been the captain of a cruiser
or something and had lost his legs in a battle, so he\'d been stuck into
this tracked vehicle contraption that took care of life support and gave
him mobility -- somewhere between Captain Pike in The Menagerie and the
Lost in Space Robot.  The enemy was the Jillies, an alien race best
remembered for its members\' habit of removing their stomachs after
digesting food and throwing them into a communal pile until needed
again.)

Jet noise is also the sound of oppression.  At the beginning of the
recent war in Afghanistan, the Soviets used to fly MiGs low over crowds
in order to break up demonstrations (which I admit causes less loss of
life than strafing the crowds would).  
Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, we have Fleet Week every fall, when
the Navy sends jet fighters low over the city.  In light of the area\'s
long history of opposition to the military and to other institutions and
cultural norms (this was the site of the largest protests against the
Gulf War; Berkeley was the seat of anti-Vietnam radicalism, etc.), I
can\'t help but wonder whether the Navy is more interested in
intimidating us than reassuring us.

Ob Traveller:  What sound does contra-grav make, if any?  I\'ve always
assumed that it\'s more or less silent, but have no basis for that
assumption.  If it is silent, what do military powers do to assert their
presence with civilians without actually shooting?

The world didn\'t begin in the 1960\'s. San Francisco is a major port city with
a long seafaring heritage, the US Navy is part of that. The people who make
fleet visit decisions are thinking as part of a 220 year old service, not
in terms of a 30 year old movement.

ObTrav: you think our militaries have traditions and protocols now. Wait
until the 82nd Airborne has 3000+ years of unit history to live up to.

I think that some noise would be normal, the hatch closing, the main gun
turret moving to draw a bead on the next citi...er, target.  You get the
picture.  But I think that from a psychological POV, having a little switch
labled "Go Quiet and Freak the Civvies" would have some merit.  Kind of the
way Ramius means in Hunt for Red October when he says, "Now they will
tremble to the sound of our silence..."

They said, and I guess we must accept, that some rules can be bent,
and some can be broken.  (IMHO, if they can be bent, they can all be
broken).  What Morpheus and gang can do is use their Willpower to
enforce their will, i.e., belief or desire, upon the Matrix.  Where Neo
can eventually, make new rules, or totally disregard existing ones, e.g.,
his little feat at the end.  They should have been doing that kind of stuff
from the beginning.  Heck, why don\'t they just make the people they
take out of the Matrix beleive that they\'re Superman.  Bullets no problem.
No reason to even go that far.  Just hack a newborn out of the Matrix,
raise it in that construct, give it superpowers, let it loose in the Matrix.
Boom.  Or perhaps easier, use religion to take advantage of the belief
of those in the Matrix, so as to give them power over it.

As I said, look to close and the whole movie falls apart.  Just enjoy the
moving pictures.  If its the plot that grabs you, Philip K. Dick did it first
and he did it better.  If I can find them, I\'ll mention the short stories and
novels that have this background.

1)  There\'s no canon word for this that I\'m aware of; 
2)  There\'s a Vilani dictionary available in a weird database format (from

Vilani-English wp/plain text files and putting up on the web.  This isn\'t

It may actually be a reversion to early CT material. IIRC Shadow posted a
table a while ago of the jump routes from each system to the next, which
kind of ties in to limited accessability...

Oh my! What about the jump drive problem we haven\'t considered. Hexes are
bigger across the points than across the flats. What if you jump from the
Far Side of one hex towards another, but your jump drive won\'t take you out
of the hex because you\'re jumping point to point..

Is a hex only an approximation, or are RL parsecs six sided?

IMTU, yes it is.  However, IMTU, that doesn\'t mean the ship can
maneuver during jump.  It has to put itself into a position where it
can make a straight line jump.

IMTU, this is what the astrogator and her computer programs are
doing...

1.  Using the "Jump Bible" or making (and double checking)
calculations that result in a plotted course to a point in space
and time where a direct line jump is possible to the target system.
The pilot flies to that point using the plotted course.

2.  Plotting a precise ship orientation pointing the "jump coil" (at
the ship\'s nose along its centerline) along the jump path.  The
pilot is responsible for maneuvering the ship into that orientation.

3.  Relaying the energy and mass requirements for the jump to the
engineer, who sets up the drive for the jump.  The energy and mass
quantity and timed release requirements vary slightly based on the
volume of the ship and the actual distance to be jumped, so there
are precise calculations here.  On command, from the astrogator, the
engineer energizes both the protective hull grid and the jump coil
and starts the first wave of mass release through grid ports.
Distinctive patters of energy appear on the surface of the hull as
energy interactions take place with the hull material as the jump
field extends through the hull.

4.  Triggering the controlled release of jump mass through the
energized jump coil initiating the 2 to 3 minute "jump window."
This is an artificially created wormhole, IMTU, but the details
don\'t matter.  To the outside world, the ship disappears and won\'t
reappear for a week when the "jump bubble" has thinned enough to
collapse.

5.  Using sensors connected to the "astrogation tank" to locate the
target mass.  She looks "through the jump window" and locks the jump
coil\'s "gravity hook" onto that mass.  There are "impediments" in jump
space that make finding and locking onto a target difficult, the
Jump Bible\'s data accounts for these impediments, but in *every*
case a skilled astrogator has to make minor corrections during the
very short period of time when the jump window is open before
"setting the hook."  The pilot then flies the ship along the "line"
into the wormhole\'s mouth.  Most misjumps that happen, happen right
here due to either the pilot not "walking the line" or "the hook not
being set properly."  IMTU, these steps can\'t be completely
automated.

6.  A week later, more or less, the ship emerges (hopefully at the
target location) and the astrogator plots a route to the target
planet (or station), providing both the course and vector
information to the pilot.  The pilot executes the course, adjusting
the ship\'s orbital vector to match the target\'s while enroute.

7.  After arriving in system she will seek to update the ship\'s
"Jump Bible" with any new data available here, and she will pass on
any new data she got from the ship\'s previous jump.  Jump route data
does change and becomes more and more unreliable over time.  A bible
a two years out of date is almost useless.

We had just arrived at Aberdeen Proving Ground for Armed Forces Day a few
years ago when we encountered the A-10.  It did a classic pop up over the
trees and then did a simulated strafing run along the road.  Traffic ground
to a halt and then the 2nd one arrived.  Had we been valid targets I think
we all would have gained a set of wings that day.  And the A-10 has a
_very_ distinctive noise when it flies past, like a cross between a
chainsaw and a blender.

Just a quick question: Does this mean that a military squadron has a
tighter spread around 168 hours (say +/-2.5hours) compared to the 168 hours
+/- 16.8 hours for civil ships? Or does it mean that a military ship takes
a different number as a base from 168 hours?

Sounds good. One question is are these the same highly tuned drives which
are happy to burn unrefined fuel safely, or is it assumed that all Milspec
ships have Fuel Purifiers on board? If unrefined fuel is standard for
military ships does this mean that the jump computer/governor is better
than a standard civil one?

Thanks,

A while back, I speculated about a regiment from that very division,
discussing the probability that there are units with an unbroken lineage
back to the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment in both the Imperial _and_
Solomani armies.

I would think (or, at least, would decree as referee) that the unit
traditions of the Imperial and Solomani editions of the 504th would be
amazingly similar.  Both would have "Tucker\'s Tankard", or a
reproduction thereof (of course, each would claim to have the original),
first drops with the unit would have similar "cherry" traditions and
rituals, etc.  Of course, YPMV (your parsecage may vary).

Sounds good. One question is are these the same highly tuned drives
which
are happy to burn unrefined fuel safely, or is it assumed that all
Milspec
ships have Fuel Purifiers on board? If unrefined fuel is standard for
military ships does this mean that the jump computer/governor is

than a standard civil one?

Thanks,

My take on this is that the CT reference to military ships being able
to use unrefined fuel was meant to indicate that they had integral fuel

GLIMMERDRIFT REACHES $9

As a general comment, the JG products were characterised by:
- - bad art
- - poor quality paper stock
- - weak to average content
- - grand ambitions

The last occasionally compensated for the first two, and makes some of the 
products quite interesting, notably the four sector guides which made up the 
"Gateway Quadrant". These sector guides are:
- - Ley Sector
- - Glimmerdrift Reaches
- - Maranantha Alkahest Sector
- - Crucis Margin

For each of these, you get: a big map of the sector, standard subsector maps 
and world detail (ie UPP lists), a small amount of background library data and 
a bunch of event/encounter/rumour tables (JG were big on event tables).

They\'re the best of the JG stuff - since this kind of material can get away 
with being raw background material. There\'s little to pick between the sector 
modules, although Glimmerdrift Reaches has (IMHO) the best sector name in 
Traveller. I don\'t think $9 is a bad price for this (it\'s not that good 
either), the other prices are as Colin pointed out high.

As I remember both the JG and the (much better) Paranoia Press sectors 
(Beyond, Vanguard Reaches) were declared non-canon at some point during the 
DGP era.

TARLKIN\'S LANDING

This as has been pointed out is a generic SF "port o call" module, not specifically for traveller. In fact the NPC stats are not UPP-based and don\'t readily convert over. It\'s meant to be a generic "starport town". Content is broadly OK, if you have players who just walk into a series of random buildings in starports, with low expectations on what they\'ll find, but as a utility you\'d be better off with 101 Rendezvous from BITS.

It does however have one of the worst covers I\'ve seen, which is basically a giant gorilla, with a scaley head and lower half, lizard claws for feet, a lizard tail, wearing a bra, smoking a cigar, carrying a rifle and taking down the particulars of a glum looking blonde guy in a blue jumpsuit and wearing a tie. Just one of your everyday situations at Tarlkin\'s Landing.

DARKLING SHIP

3rd in a series of linked scenarios, after Amycus Probe and Rogue Moon of Spinstorme. Not badly done (in relative terms) but like other JG scenarios provides lots of background information and little plot. You\'ll have to make up the point/outcome of the scenario yourself, or run one out of the event tables.

ASTROGATORS CHARTBOOK

Only for completists. A book of blank charts. In practice you\'d be better off with a software based solution, or just photocopies of the blank forms in, say, the Megatraveller Rulebooks. In either case you\'re either printing or copying onto better paper than is supplied with the JG book.

If you think that dropping the repayment horizon from 40 years to 10 years

then I\'m not sure what you think would be one.

Your point being ? With vaguely efficient financial intermediaries, you can
always turn equity or cash-flow into cash. One excellent thing about G:T FT
is that it deals with the messy business of borrowing money, futures
contracts and so on. The loss of this sort of infrastructure during the
Long Night and (to a lesser extent) the Hard Times was a major reason both
the Second and Third Imperiums went to hell in a handbasket.

The other point to remember is that drop tanks make jump-5 and jump-6 ships
far, far more viable, especially for time sensitive cargos like people. The
equivalent is probably the 1930s - even if the PCs are running a tramp
steamer in and around the Indian Ocean, they would still know about BOAC\'s
Australia-London air route.

What I think is that not every world in the Imperium rates an Imperial
marquis. Worlds with low-medium populations would only rate a baron and
low-population worlds would be lumped with another world or group of worlds
to form one fief. Lewis/Aramis, for instance, is the personal fief of
Leonard Bolden-Tukera, Marquis of Aramis. The baron of Yori/Regina (Norris)
is also the Marquis of Regina.

Now, it\'s true that not _all_ Imperial marquesses will be more powerful than
a present-day emperor. Marquis Leonard, for example, only rule 650,000 people
or so (IMO he would be one of the weakest marquesses in the Imperium; YMMV).
But some of them will be, and by association they will influence the
standing of their peers. In any case, they will still be _rarer_ than
present-day emperors.

I agree. But you can\'t tell by the way many adventure writers use them at
the drop of a hat.

I agree. But the fact that your father can afford to buy you a country out
of petty cash would IMO tend to be reflected in your career choices. Not to
mention how everybody ELSE treat you...

As I understand it, the main point about jump masking is the position
of the Star in the system you are leaving or entering.

Eg - the Earth is at the Sun\'s 100D limit (approx.). If your destination
is on the same side of the Sun as the Earth, then you only have to travel
to the Earth\'s 100D limit (about 800kkm).

If your destination is on the otherside of the Sun, then you first have to
travel about 100Mkm so the Sun\'s 100D limit is not in the way.

Or you can wait up to 6 months of the Earth to orbit the Sun and bring
your destination into view.

So the travel times in normal space can vary massively and these
variations will be seasonal.

The same calculation applies at the destination.

We also *used* to have Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Alameda Naval Station
(home of the "nuclear wessels" of ST:IV fame), Alameda NAS, Moffett Field
NAS, Hamilton AFB, Treasure Island, The Presidio of San Francisco (US
Army), Ft. Ord, etc, etc..

All of these are now closed.

San Francisco has a military tradition going bck to the building of Ft.
Point during the civil war.  Many roads in the Presidio are named after the
shore defense batteries that used to be there.  

During WWII, the Bay Area was a hotbed of military and naval activity, with
thousands of Marines and soldiers embarking from here.  Many Liberty ships
were built in the bay (including the Jeremiah O\'Brien, which you can still
see today at Pier 32).  One of the most popular hotels is the Marines\'
Memorial on Sutter Street (the street is named after the US Army Captain
who first rowed across the Golden Gate, becoming the first commuter in SF
history.)

San Franciscans will protest anything.  Trust me.

FENWICK class Scout cruiser IISS SHANGRI-LA is available for download at
my Web site (I haven\'t yet had time to translate the ship into text, so
all that\'s there now is the .zip file of the Akins v3.2 spreadsheet for
Excel 5.0).

Designer\'s notes:

The GRAN FENWICK class Scout cruiser, of which IISS SHANGRI-LA is a
typical example, meets an anticipated IISS proposal for a Jump-5, 4G
warship, of 20-30 Kdt, capable of serving in both reconnaissance and
combat roles.  Using the proven 11.1 k-Mj NPAW spinal weapon found on
the ST. LOUIS class light cruiser (upgraded to TL15, and reduced to a
ROF of 200 to allow for a smaller, stealthier power plant), the GRAN
FENWICK class is quite capable of fighting ships of 50 Kdt on nearly
equal terms.  The 500 mkm PEMS suite allows the GRAN FENWICK class to
find potentially-hostile ships first, and is supported by an extensive
science-grade sensor suite, including densitometer and neutrino
sensors.  To avoid detection, the GRAN FENWICK class makes extensive use
of stealth, visual coatings, IR masking, and neutrino masking
technologies.

The GRAN FENWICK class is designed for long-term habitability.  Every
crewbeing has an individual small stateroom (the captain and senior
department heads are issued large staterooms).  Sufficient provisions of
Good quality are provided to enable the GRAN FENWICK class cruiser to
undertake cruises of up to 52 weeks duration.  There are two lounges,
each of 50 dtons, and each equipped with a snack bar/galley capable of
feeding 60 crewbeings.  Further, the GRAN FENWICK design includes six
standard gym facilities, which exceed Imperial standards for exercise
facilities per 100 crewmembers.

The long-term habitability of the GRAN FENWICK class is not achieved at
the expense of mission capability, however.  In addition to the
extensive sensor suite, the GRAN FENWICK class sports a 50 dton Combat
Information Center.  For long-term surveillance of target worlds, 4
passive radio-frequency receivers, each of 10,000 AU range, are linked
both to the CIC and to a dedicated fiber-optic computer.

The small craft complement carried by GRAN FENWICK class, two 30 dton
ship\'s boats and 6 50 dton modular cutters, provides ample transport for
the 40 ship\'s troops routinely embarked, as well as for additional
mission requirements.

At scarcely over 70 BCr per ship, the GRAN FENWICK Scout light cruiser
class provides capabilities not found in designs of twice this price.

Well, if you get to count the Planet Ord, you can at least continue to
count the Presidio of Monterey, which is home to the Defense Language
Institute (which, in turn, was my home for the 63 weeks of the Basic
Arabic course in 1984-1985).

The Presidio of Moterey was established in 1770, and is thus older than
the Army which now employs it as an installation.  IIRC, the Presidio of
San Francisco was also established prior to 14 June 1775, and was thus
also older than the US Army.  (BTW, for those who haven\'t been there,
the walking trails on the former Presidio of San Francisco are
_outstanding_.)

\'Truth drugs\' exist now.
If one gives a subanesthetic dose of an intravenous induction agent,
people are often sufficiently disinhibited to answer just about any
question you ask them. That\'s the theory, anyway. The actual practice
would appear to be fairly ineffective.

Thiopentone (\'Pentothal\') was used as an adjunct to psychotherapy after
World War 2.

And it brings options, do you try for a hard plot skimming the

IIRC, it just nullifies, so probably no sound there.  I\'d have a sound (in an

I\'ve gotten a lot useful out of it.  We got some thoroughly useful details of 
economics by the very authors of Far Trader.  The Jump masking thread came 
from this,too, IIRC, as did the one on misjumps (though less sure on that 
one).  Jump projectors, too, though that\'s been pretty limited...

I think I might actually start using drop tanks (whereas before I never 
ignored them, just didn\'t think worth putting on... i knew there were 
benefits, but there\'s a logistical problem behind them, too, as well as other 
issues that have been discussed in this thread).  That\'s pretty significant 
for me.  

You can always delete a subject that doesn\'t appeal to you.  I\'m on the 
digest and "page down" over things that don\'t interest me all the time.  It 
appears to be winding down, anyways, but we\'ll see...  As far as the line by 
line reply, it is getting long.  I\'ll see what I can do to better summarize 
and/or paraphrase from now on.  :-)

I dont\' remember it being said that rules could be broken (except possibly by

Yeah.  Willpower sounds good.  So maybe normal skill use, etc but every now 
and then "willpower" to always grant outstanding success or something?  I 
intend to actually use something like this for an upcoming adventure...  

How would you do the "downloaded" skills?  Should people w/ Neural Jacks be 
treated like they have implant computers from FF&S?  Maybe download a skill 
at a time and it then fades?  Get too many skill/levels that way and you have 
a psychotic episode?   Otherwise, everyone\'s gonna want one and start 
cramming on skills if there\'s no downside or drawbacks.  I\'m not out for a 
fiat "game balance" rule though.... never did like them much.

Nah.  I like it the way they did it.  Course, I never try to analyze a movie 
till afterwards, if everything initially sounds viable.  I had a good 
impression of the Matrix, though, so that probably kept me from picking it 
apart.  ;-) 

Plus, Neo didn\'t believe he was "the One" until the end and couldn\'t see the 
actual workings of the matrix, nor just destroy the agents (and/or remove 
them from the program).

I don\'t think believing your\'e superman or a new prophet or something would 
work. You\'d still be subject to the rules. They can be "bent" but not broken 
(except by someone like "the One" (w/ comp. empathy or something).  You 
wouldn\'t be ressurecting people since their [real] bodies were unplugged and 
liquified and fed to teh others.  The agents would still kick some ass too 
since they can majorly fudge the rules (w/ that speed punching, etc).  Neo 
alone, i think, could break the rules.  In game terms, I think i\'d start Neo 
getting instruction w/ willpower, etc, then once he\'s convinced, he can 
control his computer empathy (in the beginning when he\'s sparring w/ 
Morpheus, it was reflex... i\'d make the roll myself until the player "knows" 
he has the power and/or experiments enough to "prove" it to himself).

Well yeah, IIRC your Imperial Marines are decended from the 82nd Airborne.
The most interesting threads would be the mixture of their
essentially democratic origin, their Rule of Man "Naval Junta"
expansion, their use as troops by ????? on ????? during the Long Night,
and their resurrection as the Imperial Marines by Cleon I.

Question: the times that would shape them most, I guess, would
be their creation as elite troops of the democratic USA during
the Totalitarian Era (WW II /Cold War) and their long stay on a certain
planet during the long night.  Given any though on which planet, and for
which nation/noble?

How bout on a campaign?  Possibly for teh whole universe, but nothing that 
has to affect any characters over the lifespan of a camapaign.  From what 
I\'ve read from the Far Trader economic analysis, I wouldn\'t even call it 
"catastrophic."  Noticible... maybe even significant... but not catastrophic.

Err... that it\'s fairly easily conceivable for there to not be "at least a 
million in cash
at any point?"  That was what u wanted an answer to, right?  Or was it

I\'m sure the Reavers and Lucan\'s Black War were also noticible, not to 
mention a certain Virus.  ;-)  I agree w/ you completely, though.  I intend 
to get Far Trader, but don\'t see any reason to believe that it\'s the end of 
Traveller economics as we know it.  If anything this thread has proven that 
belief (based on economic analysis posted to the list on MT (TNE uses the 
same economics system) and GT:FT).

How?  Maybe under book 2, but not under anything since IIRC.  You can get 3 
jump 2s maybe (in 3 weeks), but that\'s not the same as Jump 6 in one week.  
But you still face an enormous risk on a catastrophic run, especially in 
something like the Beowulf, which is only marginally profitable to begin w/.

To be fair though, you can say this about many books, movies and even
roleplaying games (and especially Traveller).

Where would Terminator have been without Ellison\'s Outer Limits episode
soldier? Large chunks of the film were lifted directly from the TV show.
Where would the film version of Blade Runner have been without the play
Rossum\'s Universal Robots? In books, Haldeman\'s Forever War wouldn\'t have
existed without Starship Troopers. Back to movies, the beloved sci-fi series
Star Wars is simply a retooling of the peasant hero myths of many countries,
with a hefty helping of Akira Kurusawa (sp?) tossed in for comic relief.
Messiah legends were around long before Herbert wrote the Dune series... and
then there are of course roleplaying games, and the one we discuss on this
mailing list in particular.

The Foundation series, the Dune series, Starship Troopers, Alien even to
some extent Star Wars all influenced the game that we love and discuss. I\'m
using the term "influenced" here, but I\'ve heard people use less flattering
and polite terms... ;^)

Not sure what you mean here exactly. I\'m assuming that you mean that there\'s
no real underlying logic to the film and it\'s simply eye candy. I would
disagree, not simply because I liked the film but also because there was.

***potential spoilers ahead***


My own two cents on this one:

I wouldn\'t say Willpower exactly, it\'s something a little less definable.
There\'s also a good deal of mechanics going on behind the scenes as well.
After all, why do you think that they had Operators sitting behind the
scenes at consoles?

The way that I\'d personally do a game version of the concept:

There\'d be an advantage called Matrix Synergy or something similar. It would
be similar to Psionics in CT (if you don\'t have it, you don\'t have it). This
would allow pretty much complete control, with certain limitations, over
one\'s representation in the Matrix. This would be far too powerful an
advantage to give to a character in a game, in my opinion.

To simulate the kinds of things that Morpheus and Trinity were able to do
there\'d be certain little perks that the characters could learn over time.
Jumping and running rules might be changed slightly, for example. Their
number of attacks per round might be upped slightly here and there. All of
this would require periods of intense training.

On the other hand, skills could be learned extremely quickly. Skills would
become something of a non-issue with a few limitations. The skill might not
exist in the team\'s "skill pool" (what, you need to play a sitar? Tough
luck!).

Skills that rely entirely on rote memorization could be learned in an
instant and on the fly, while skills that require more than one discipline
(such as martial arts) might take a little longer. Of course this would be
modified by the skill of the party\'s Operator. There is a limitation on the
ability to learn skills. Neo was able to learn many different sorts of
martial arts over a long period of time while it was clearly indicated that
nobody else had been able to spend as much time having this stuff fed into
their heads.

Further, a handwave could be made that team Operators have to be humans who
have never been hooked into the Matrix. Perhaps in the real world the former
inhabitants of the Matrix have only a fraction of the dexterity and fine
motor skills that their virtual versions have?

There\'s great potential for a roleplaying game or campaign in there. Really
great potential. Keep in mind that the Matrix is only part one of a planned
trilogy, so we may learn more about the specifics in later episodes.

Everyone got side-tracked with the duct-taped gauss rifles, but no-one
answered the original question. Joe Fugate replied to this question in
Digest 12, but I\'ll try to give you the short version!

- -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
COMBINATION ATTACKS IN MT COMBAT

Joe Fugate states that the key to resolving combination attacks in MT is to
use common sense, and take it a step at a time.

1.   ALWAYS determine a single primary target BEFORE you begin resolving
hits.

"Once the single primary target has been identified in a combination
attack, it remains the primary target for the entire combination attack. If
the firing unit wants a shifting primary target, then he is conducting
rapid fire instead." (Digest 12, p 42)

Determining the primary target saves a lot of headaches, as it becomes the
reference point.

Line of fire (Player\'s Manual p 72) comes into play here. Joe\'s solution is
to make the closest target in the line of fire the DEFAULT primary target,
all others in the same range band being secondary targets. Preferred target
precedence is:
     1.   Primary target;
     2.   Targets adjacent to the primary target AND in the line of fire;
     3.   Targets adjacent to the primary target and NOT in the line of
fire.

However, you can target something in the line of fire but behind the
default primary target if you use the Pinpoint Location rule - that is, you
must achieve Exceptional Success.

Here\'s Joe\'s example done in cheesy ASCII art:
- ----
+--+--+--+     +--+
|  |Hu|  |     |  | <-- one 1.5m square
+--+--+--+     +--+
|As|Ro|Hi|
+--+--+--+
|  |Va|Dr|
+--+--+--+
|  |  |  |
+--+--+--+
|  |  |  |
+--+--+--+
|  |PC|  | <-- has ARL with HE!!
+--+--+--+
- ----
Diagram 1: PC with ARL fires into melee ("with friends like these...")

In Diagram 1, the PC toting the assault rocket launcher wants to shoot the
Robot (more fool him ;-). This means that the Vargr, Robot, and Human are
in the line of fire, while the Aslan, Hiver, and Droyne are adjacent. The
Vargr becomes the DEFAULT primary target - sorry! To make the Robot the
primary target, the PC must Pinpoint it with Exceptional Success, otherwise
he hits the Vargr.

2.   Resolve autofire hits first

Roll "to hit" the primary target, then roll an identical "to hit" task for
the secondary target(s) - player\'s choice. In fact, all the autofire hits
may be applied to the primary target.

Evaluate the Penetration for each autofire shot and apply the damage.

Using Diagram 1 above, we assume the PC hits the Robot (requires
Exceptional Success), so the Robot becomes the primary target. The PC still
has two autofire hits left, and targets the Robot again - but must still
roll Exceptional Success. In Joe\'s example, one shot misses completely and
one hits but without Exceptional Success - the PC hits the Vargr. Ouch!

3.   Resolve danger space hits

"Danger space represents how much the weapon "splatters" or "sprays" when
it hits; that is, what collateral damage the weapon does to nearby targets
when it hits the primary target. These collateral hits are known as _group
hits_."

[In other words, p 72 of the Player\'s Manual is poorly edited - weapons
with a Danger Space of more than one square will cause Group Hits, and the
two should have been explained under the one heading!]

Translate Danger Space in metres to the number of squares. An ARL with HE
has a Danger Space of 3 metres, so this means 2 squares in every direction
including the point of impact - ie, a 3x3 square centred on the impact
point:
- ----
+--+--+--+     +--+
|YY|YY|YY|     |  | <-- one 1.5m square
+--+--+--+     +--+
|YY|XX|YY|
+--+--+--+
|YY|YY|YY|
+--+--+--+

YY = square hit with half Pen effect
XX = square hit with full Pen effect
- ----
Diagram 2: Danger Space of an ARL with HE rounds

Note that the effect in the XX square is usually ignored, since the primary
target has been hit with the full effect anyway, but _will_ be a concern if
someone is grappling the primary target!

Back to our example in Diagram 1: the hit on the Robot puts the Aslan,
Human, Hiver, Vargr, and Droyne in the danger space. Roll a Group Hit
(using the same "to hit" task from before) on each one. Penetration is
halved, however.

The hit on the Vargr puts the Aslan, Hiver, and Droyne in the danger zone.
Roll a Group Hit against each one - again, Pen is halved. The lucky Human
is outside the zone and takes no more hits!!

4.   Rapid Fire

Joe does not address this in detail, however his passing comment (see "1"
above) indicates to me that you repeat steps 1-3 for each primary target.
It sounds reasonable to me that if you can "empty your weapon" at three
separate targets, why not just one? That is, with a gauss rifle, you can
conduct a full autofire attack (as discussed above) three times at the one
target.

So in answer to Shawn, I would say you are nearly right - instead of
attacking 4 targets 3 times each, you can attack 3 targets 4 times each.
With the gauss rifle having one primary target and three additional
autofire targets per autofire attack, in one round you can shoot at the
same target 12 times!!!

The only drawbacks are that you empty your weapon, and that the Difficulty
goes up by one - even at Short range, every shot becomes Difficult.
However, I know this guy with Combat Rifleman-6... ;-)

One Rapid Fire rule I added IMTU is that of Suppression Fire: characters in
an area where Rapid Fire is being conducted must make a morale check or
else duck for cover (evade). [Based on the example above, are you
surprised? ;-)]

5.   The TL 12 4mm Gauss Rifle - my editorial comments

I have said for years that the gauss rifle is the MOST devastating
Traveller small arm in CT/MT. I mean, a Pen of 7 out to 500m, damage 4, etc
etc! BTW, remember that the rifle fires either 1, 4, or 10 rounds per pull
of the trigger (Book 4). My ruling for MT is that a 4-round burst only
allows 2 extra autofire targets, while the 10-round burst allows the three
as shown. Using it for Rapid Fire means that you empty the entire 40-round
magazine in one go - next round, reload, with no fire possible!

Note that the damage given in MT is wrong, it should be a 4D weapon if you
check Book 4. I _think_ this is covered in the errata. Also, if you read
the description, it should have the "**"" gyro-stabilised rating, which I
_don\'t_ think is in the errata!

Are you saying that it could be that there are
jump 6 drop ships travelling the main routes and it just wasn\'t
worth mentioning?  That doesn\'t work for me at all.
Even if it doesn\'t directly affect the PC, the description
of the backgrond is something that I want to be consistent.

It also means that jump-6 couriers aren\'t as special as
the Rebelion sourcebook implies.  In fact, I seems to
me that jump-6 ships become cheap enough that the j-4
X-boats do become pointless.  To me it doesn\'t
doesn\'t fit the idea that a jump-1 or jump-2 ships carrying
a cargo over long distances (like in the Traveller adventure).
They should be just ferrying cargo to and from the smallest
worlds, they can\'t compete.  It should also meant that PC will,
if they need to get someplace in a hurry have to decide
if they want to switch to j-6 drop ships (as opposed
to switching to a jump-3 or jump-4 liner).

You also have problem with military situations.  Aside from
issues of how far you can jump into enemy space, etc. the
classic a fleet jumping in and having to engage or refuel
before it can jump out becomes obsolete.  If you have
drop tanks you don\'t have to jump in with empty tanks.
But this is not a trivial part of the background.

Well, I don\'t know about you, but in my games I have had situations
where the evil bad guys had to stop the PC before they left
port.  With a drop liner you can have a shot at them at
the jump gate.

The issue above on military situation also applies to if
PC are going to be be the ones ambushed after they have
jumped in and need to refuel.

What is more, I don\'t find treating what the PC are doing
in a vacuum to be statisfying.  I want their actions to
exist in the context of the setting.  If the setting has
drop tanks, then it should reflect that as reasonably
as possible.  They should be affecting the timeline which
_will_ affect my PCs.

Well, since this issue means that I am moved toward your situation
of not believing the piracy encounter tables, maybe this
is all an illuminati plot to make me feel your pain :-).
You can feel my pain by noting that these rules give me
as many problems as piracy gives you (depending on how
much pain you feel :-)

Right, and the context of why Oberlindes hires them should fit
the background.  If they are being driven out of business
by drop tanks, then I expect that to be reflected in what my
PC see.

OK, so we ask the same question about another corps....

Military ships will use them as an adjuct to internal tankage.
Letting them jump twice before they have to refuel (meaning
the Zhodani have to protect at least twice as much territory),
letting them jump in with full loads (the Imperials don\'t
have to worry about running High Guard), they either take
the system and fuel at their leasure or just jump backout,
and other situations that might come up if I wasn\'t doing this
off the top of my head.

Both the Traveller adventure and Twilights peak had the PC
operating between decent sized systems and over long distances.

>>If you think about it (and people will) questions are going to come up.

Well, we had previously agreed, I thought, that drop tanks
made a difference in the setting but that you liked the idea
of the setting exploring the change in how FTL works and
I didn\'t.

Though I think that GT is increasing painting a picture of a
setting where drop tank ships operating between decent sized
world is inconsitent.

Yeah, that is true.  OTOH, if you want to change that, and I agree
that it is problem (weren\'t you one of the people trying to
covince me of that? :-), then they are something you have
to loose anyway.

Drop tanks are described as working by explosively jettisoning  through the
use of explosive bolts with the ship jumping when the remains of the tanks
are a safe distance from the vessel.  Aside from the issue that if you want
to get something away from you the best thing is not to explode it (you
can\'t be sure all the pieces will move away) and that, given the high
acceleration of Traveller ships, the best way is for them to move
themselves away, jettisoning a cable is going to be easier than jettisoning
a whole tank.

Which doesn\'t make sense for a space vessel.  To "carry"

(if you believe it would have to do even that).

It\'s like this, if it\'s based on acceleration, then the 100 diameter
limit doesn\'t work. That is, the value of acceleration for the standard
size & density Traveller planets varies by too much.

You see, for a uniform density (assumed for "standard" planets), the
mass of the planet varies as the *cube* of the diameter. But the
acceleration varies according to the inverse square of the distance. If
you figure the distance in diameters, the mis-match gets *worse*.

But if you figure "tidal force" (which is the rate at which
acceleration *changes* with distance) then you get a perfect match. For
bodies of uniform density, the tidal force at a given number of
*diameters* is the same.

But the *diameter* of a body depends on both the mass *and* on the
density. The lower the density, the bigger the diameter.

That is, a sphere of ice that weighs 1 kilo will be a *lot* bigger than
a sphere of iron that also weighs 1 kilo. And that\'s because ice is
much less dense than iron.

So since the jump limit is based on *diameters*, density has to be
considered.

Actually, if you sit down and do some calculations, you\'ll find that
this is wrong. 

First thing, the "distance" is not fixed, but in terms of planetary
*diameter*. Therefore, the limit must depend on *something* that varies
with the *size* of the planet. 

The default Traveller planet, be it size 1 or size A has the same
density as Earth. So, since they have uniform density, it turns out
that their mass depends on their diameter.

Size	dia	mass
- ----	----	----
1	1/7	(1/7)^3
2	2/7	(2/7)^3	
3	3/7	(3/7)^3
4	4/7	(4/7)^3
5	5/7	(6/7)^3
6	6/7	(6/7)^3	
7	1	1
8	8/7	(8/7)^3
9	9/7	(9/7)^3
A	10/7	(10/7)^3

So the mass goes up as the cube of the diameter. But we need something
that goes up *linearly* with diameter.

Acceleration due to gravity goes as mass (thus 3rd power), but also
*drops* as the square root of distance (1/2 power). Thus acceleration
varies as the 3/2 power of diameter of a fixed density body. So that\'s
no good.

The rate at which acceleration changes (aka tidal force, aka gravity
gradient, aka curvature of space) varies as the *third* root of
distance. and directly as mass. So that gives a variance of 3/3 or 1
with respect to diameter of a fixed density body. That matches.

Fine. The point is, that *is* a minimum diameter stellar corpse type
black hole. So, if jump limit depends solely on diameter, then the jump
limit for this black hole is 600 km. And at that distance tidal forces
would rip any solid object into individual atoms. 

If jump limits depend on mass (and thus on cuvature of space) the jump
limit for this black hole would be the same as for any 3 solar mass
star. Which is something over an AU.

No. 

*Please* stop and visualize the situation. If necessary, draw a
diagram. 

Assuming no overhang, you\'ve at best got a vertical cliff next to you.
More likely you have a slope at 30 to 60 degrees inclination. Let\'s
assume you are hiding "behind" a mountain 4 km tall (about 13 thousand
feet). And with a 60 degree slope on the side you are on. Call that a
2-1 slope (2 up for every 1 over). 

So at 50km altitude, I can be 25 km away from you and see you past the
mountain. 25 km ain\'t "directly overhead". 

Now consider that the average slope on tall natural features is more
like 1-2. Which means that you could be seen from 100km away by a space
fighter at 50 km altitude.

And then add in the fact that your aircraft can\'t get too close to
slopes. That gives *more* seperation. 

This is an unavoidable consequence of the terrain features being so
much *smaller* than the operational altitude of the space fighter.

And just *what* are you going to use for diverting this beam? True,
first surface mirrors for lasers can handle more power than the surface
of a ship can, simply because they can be kept far smoother. Even so,
you\'ll hit a limit *long* before you reach the power levels of a weapon
so big that it *has* to be built into something the size of Luna. 

Particle beams are *worse, because any field that will deflect the beam
defocuses it to a greater or lesser extent.

And since you seem unaware of the fact, I\'ll just point out that a
meson gun has to be pointed at the target. They can fire *thru* things,
but they can\'t fire around corners.

Actually, I\'ll bet it produces CO2 also. But yes, many fuel cells
produce water as a byproduct. And it\'s usually quite drinkable.

BTW, one detail the John W. Campbell pointed out back in the 60s.
Barring some major breaktrough, electric cars will not be able to spare
the power to run electrical heaters, and they won\'t produce enough
"waste heat" to drive a normal heater (or air conditioner for that
matter). 

So electric cars will have heaters and air-conditioners driven by a
heat source such as kerosene or propane!

You only get NOx emissions if the reaction takes place at high temps.
It\'s not a matter of "incomplete" combustion. And in internal
combustion engines, the high pressure in the cylinders aids NOx
formation. 

External combustion engines (steam engines) will produce some NOx
emissions due to high flame temps. But the better the burner design,
the lower the emissons. And, of course, they don\'t get much in the
"incomplete combustion" department.

Fuell cells react things at room temp, and the oxygen usually has to
pass thru some sort of dielectric. It gets passed thru that as
individual oxygen atoms, and the nitrogen gets left behind, so the only
way to get NOx emmisions is from arcing of the brushes in the electric
motors. Use brushless motors and even that won\'t happen.

Well, Inertial Electrostatic Confinement looks pretty good. Alas, it
looks like it\'ll take a 5 meter diameter unit to achieve useful power
output. That pretty much kills it for use in cars, trucks, and
aircraft. Ships should do fine.

The average inclination of the "flattened disk" would be the ecliptic
plane of the system. I forget the angle that our ecliptic is inclined
to the plane of the galaxy.

Actually, a proper system design system should give orbital
inclinations with respect to the local ecliptic. And even 15 degrees
would be fairly unusual. 

BTW, it takes more than just an angle to specify the orientation of an
orbit with trespect to the ecliptic or that of the ecliptic with
respect to the galactic plane. 

As I recall, to completely specify an orbit takes:

1. semi-major axis (size of orbit)
2. eccentrity (shape of orbit)
3. inclination of orbit (angle of orbital plane with respect to
   reference plane)
4. longitude of the ascending node (angle from zero reference to the
   point where planet\'s orbit intersects the reference plane while
   moving "up")
5. Argument of the perihelion (angle between perihelion and zero
   reference?)
6. time of perhelion passage

Basicly #3 gives the angle of the orbital plane. #4 pins down the
orientation of the orbital plane. #5 pins down which way the orbit is
oriented inside the orbital plane. And #6 pins down where in the orbit
the planet is. 

And what we need is a program that can take the above and give the
(polar or spherical) co-ordinates of a planet at a given time.

It\'d also help to have it able to convert between orbital co-ordinates
and xyz position and velocity vectors (ie at this time, it\'s at
position xyz, with velocities of XYZ along the xyz axes).

After all, ships are easiest to deal with in XYZ terms. I\'d only
convert to orbital when there\'s a long period of coasting.

My suggestions are to use real world figures, and convert to/from game
system figures in a seperate module.

So stars would be specified by mass and spectral class. That gives size
and other details by simple lookups. 

Planets would be by mass, size, and composition, both of planet & of
atmosphere. Ditto for satellites.

We also need to store orbital elements, and other such things. 

One thing that occured to me the other night is that it might be useful
to have an entry for "primary" for everything in a "catalog" or
"atlas". So Luna would list Terra, Terra would list Sol, Sol would list
"Milky Way Galaxy", the Milky Way would list the "local group", the
local group would list (I think) the Virgo cluster, which would list
the proper supercluster, which would list "the universe" :-)

This would at least get rid of the artificial distinctions between
planets, moons, and asteroids.

Aaahhh, the field of celestial mechanics. This is actually a straight forward
procedure. I have some fortran 90 code that does this if your interested.

I\'m not sure by what you mean by orbital coordinates. What you need
is the orbital elements and the desired time. From this you can calculate both
the position and velocity (its called generating an empherides).

Basically, every starship ever to jump in Traveller was WAY inside the
really big and massive object known as the milky way. If you cannot jump
within 10 diameters of the milky way then nobody can jump PERIOD.

As Traveller canon seem to indicate that ships DO jump from time to time
the 10 x diameter, 100 x diameter rules must be wrong. ;-)

Hmmmm....

I just flashed on a *lovely* bit of background for a world. Have it be
medium poulation, fairly "frontier", but trying to get a reputation for
being civilized (like San Francisco 100 years back). 

Add prominent local citizen who has gone harmlessly nuts. He thinks
he\'s the Emperor of the planet. And everyone goes along with the gag.

Now have it being approached to join the Imperium. And the locals
decide to appoint the "Emperor" as the official planetary government.

:-)

I want to see the players when they realize that the "Emperor" of the
planet is a loon. Especially if they need to negotiate a favor.

Boy did you miss my meaning.  I ment either mount a meson weapon on gimbals
and shoot though whatever part of the moon is in the way or use wave guides.
You\'d use wave guides to tansmit a powerful but unfocused beam (or several
AKA star wars) to the \'head\' pointed thawd the target and there focus it
with a final gravidic lens.  Or have more than one weapon powered by one
reacter and use the weapon that point at your target.  There are meny ways
to skin this cat.

Close enough.  You are still in the single digits or arc.  Less than .001%
of the posible search area.  Not to good.  Also unless the space fighter\'s
radar is instantanious it\'s likely to miss the fighter due to the time
required to actively search with a resolution in meters a surface in the
millions of meters with lots of iregularities that had to be classified
friend, foe, or terrain.

No, the air craft could land on the slope.  GTL12 CG system.  Or IN the

You\'ve also forgoten things like ground clutter, apperture, viewing angle,
resolution, scan time.  The grounded fighter will see the space fighter with
it\'s remove passive sensor array placed at the top to the mountain to give
the widest posible veiwing angle and attack it with remote placed weapons as
it crosses the horizon.

I thought about that when Trinity had to d/l helicopter pilot skills.  Since they
don\'t download all the programs as a matter of course, there must be some
limit or hazard to having all programs.  I don\'t know about implant computers
but it makes sense for there to be a limit to the amount of skill programs that
a person could keep active at the same time.  I assumed that Trinity lost
something
when she received the helicopter data.

Aw, come on.  You bought that head fake?  ;-)
His name is "Neo", and anagram for "One".  And "Neo" means "new."
Those aren\'t accidents.  Names of characters in movies are never by
accident.

As I said before, they said some can be broken.  But I still maintain that if
you believe the rules don\'t apply to you, they won\'t.  But even then, Superman
believes in gravity.  Under a yellow sun, it just doesn\'t have much effect on him.

In the context of the film, death of the body only occurs with death of the mind
in the Matrix.  So as long as you can believe you\'re alive within the context of
the Matrix, you can stay alive and generate power for the placeholder aliens.
So, take a guy who can preform \'miracles\' within the Matrix, have him convince
people in the Matrix that they cannot die, or if they do, there is life after
death.

[Not trying to get started with a religious discussion here, its just that since
belief (i.e., faith) can be a powerful force within the Matrix - there has been
some religious analysis of the film though].

As agents of the system, they can only function within the context of the
rules, though they have some kind of \'superuser\' authority.  They did say that
some rules could be broken, but you\'re right to point out that Neo is the only
one who did break any.  (Except for the Agents\' ability to takeover a human in
the Matrix) I think the only rules he broke involved stopping the bullets and then

diving in the one agent.  Everything else involves bending, i.e, doing something
faster, stronger, etc.

I\'m going to go see it again.

Sure, but there is one short story in particular that I\'m thinking of.
If Dick was alive, I\'d offer to be his lawyer in the copyright

Never heard or saw those, but at least Blade Runner says upfront that its

There is an underliying logic, but it contains significant inconsistencies.
Sure, few movies don\'t.  And they made a laudable attempt to give the
appearance of consistency, which works a little bit on a superficial level.

To pull them out of the Matrix.  The operators didn\'t assist them in
the actual task of performing an action or bending the rules.

Didn\'t know that.  I assume in part 2 we will learn more about the aliens.

Well, he did sorta come back to life... that\'s generally regarded as "breaking" a

IIRC, it just nullifies, so probably no sound there.  I\'d have a sound

HEPlaR is essentially a rocket engine.  Not exactly, but close enough

T-plates are based on gravitic technology, so I have imagined them as

Not at all.  The air fighter carried the systems to set up this condition.
Remote sensors and standoff weapons are common concepts today.  They are
likely to be common in the future as well.  I am basocly discribeing a
comando attack craft with some of the abilities of a helocopter, tank, and
plane.  I never said the planes crew or designer were fools or that they
would fight a stand up toe to toe fight either.  I was supposing a system
designed to make an invader pay dearly for the world he is taking.

Hm...ideally, you could probably create a dramatically more efficient heater by
using a heat pump (a reversed air conditioning unit).  I assume there\'s some
technical reason this isn\'t normally practical, since it could allow a 5-10x
increase in the efficiency of a heater (with the side effect of extremely
_cold_ air being produced on the outside).

Why not run the remote sensors and standoff weapons from an

I\'m not saying remote sensors and standoff weapons are bad ideas. I\'m 
pointing out that by grounding the plane and using them, you\'re 
acknowledging the ineffectiveness of the airplane itself, at least as a
combat air vehicle. 

Now, as a grav tank or mobile command center, we may be getting 
somewhere.

Basically, every starship ever to jump in Traveller was WAY inside the
really big and massive object known as the milky way. If you cannot
jump
within 10 diameters of the milky way then nobody can jump PERIOD.

As Traveller canon seem to indicate that ships DO jump from time to
time
the 10 x diameter, 100 x diameter rules must be wrong. ;-)


/Anders Backman
>>>>
What object called the milky way?  There is no such thing.  There is a
grouping of individual stars which orbit a common center.  At that
common center is (apparently) a very large black hole.  This grouping of
stars is labeled the milky way.  I don\'t need to get 100 diameters away
from the milky way since there is no such thing except as a label on
some pieces of paper.  As long as I am 100d away from the closest of
these stars I am at least 100d away from all of them.
Now, there may well be a certain amount of "background" gravitation for
the milky way galaxy, which would diminish radically at 100d away from
the major grouping.  In fact, this may be the way to get higher Jump
numbers.

<wild Jump theory>
Suppose for argument that Jump limits (the 100d limit dicated in every
Traveller ruleset so far) are connected with the tidal forces that have
been discussed previously [this is the best explanation I have seen so
far IMHO].  Each and every object in the universe deforms space-time
near it.  Two objects fairly near each other will deform space-time more
(and more complexly) than a single object.  Thus, in the area of Known
Space, there is a fairly constant "background" curvature of space-time. 
This curvature will decrease in rifts, but will increase along mains,
but not very much either way (since we are dealing with the aggragate
gravitation of a galaxy as well as individual stars).  This background
curvature is (adventure idea) just beginning to be theorized about in
relation to Jump during the early 1100s.  Thus this will not affect Jump
in CT, MT, or TNE (except perhaps in the Regency), T4, or GT (perhaps
just the first glimmerings).
In this case, the background curvature will prohibit access to Jump
spaces higher than 6 except under extraordinary circumstances (misJump
anyone?).  If you can get your ship to an area with a decreased
background curvature, higher Jump spaces are available routinely instead
of just as freak occurances.  Additionally, the destination of the Jump
is important as well as the origin.  Therefore, to access higher Jump
spaces, your background curvature would need to be lower and the place
you are Jumping to needs a lower curvature as well.  This is why this
theory hasn\'t been evident before, because people are usually trying to
get TO someplace specific.
So, to make use of this theory...
One needs to have a lower background curvature at both beginning and
ending points of the Jump, as well as along the whole (straight-line)
path of the Jump as it corresponds to real space.  So, if one were to
have a suitable Jump-7 drive designed and built, you could still only
just it as a J-6 drive along the mains.  But, if you got out into the
middle of the Great Rift, and then were to Jump ALONG the Rift (rather
than across it), one could achieve Jump 7.  Out on the distant edges of
the galaxy, or between the spiral arms, you could achieve Jump 8, 9, 10,
and perhaps higher.  To get the really phenomenal Jump distances (Jump
36 for example) on a consistant basis, you would need to get out between
galaxies.
</wild Jump theory>

So, any comments, flames, nuclear bombs?

No, not at all.  I was increasing the survivability of the design.  If the
air figther can kill a space fighter \'for free\' without directly exposing
itself to return fire that means each such fighter will get two or more
enemy craft.  A very good use of manpower.  One such fighter with a dozen
prepared positions could cost the invaders a great deal in manpower and
material.  It is only one posible design for a anti space invader craft.

As for why I did not use a bunker, a bunker can not run away to fighter
again tomarrow.  Once located it is toasted by dead fall ordinence.

[Clipped]
I think that one issue that needs to be addressed is why jump-2 is
significantly more advanced than jump-1.  And why jump 3+ is more advanced
than earlier versions.  Since misjumps allow up to 36 parsec jumps with even
a jump-1 vessel, it can\'t be a physical boundary.  That pushes me in the
direction of a control issue, i.e. advances in technology allow for more and
more precise alignments allowing for jump "locks" at further distances.

I agree with your statements. That\'s how I would handle the situation, but
MT rules seem to read as though autofire targets must be alternate targets.

New related question:

MT Imperial Encyclopedia: "A person under slow drug can make twice as many
actions or move twice as far as  normal."

Is it possible to conduct "rapid-fire" and reload in the same round with
slow drug?

I didn\'t think you could, because it takes a "normal" round to empty the
weapon. Just because the person firing the weapon is taking his action twice
as fast, doesn\'t mean the gun can too. I figure slow drug would allow
multiple semi-automatic shots. For example, if the guass gun is set to 10
rounds/pull (3 autofire targets) then the character can make 2 attacks.
(resulting in 20 rounds fired) This would give time to reload before the
round was over. But, if rapid-fire is conducted, then the character is
essentially "holding down the trigger" for the entire combat round (which
wouldn\'t make any difference if the character was on slow drug or not)

Does a weapon that conducts "rapid-fire" fire its weapon for the entire
round? Does it for more than half the round? I figure it would have to fire
for half the round or less to be able to fire and reload in the same round
(with slow drug)

        In the RPG "Cyberpunk 2020", this is a *common* problem because of
the way the initiative system works when using cybernetically and drug
boosted reflexes.  Here is how *I* take care of it....

        Things with physical limitations on rate of use (cyclics on
automatic weapons) are restricted to there maximum as the maximum for the
duration of the round...  so, if its a max ROF 30 weapon, then it is 30/1
action, 30/ 2 actions, 30/ 5 actions, whatever.  Things with no limitations
(fists, light blades & melee weapons) can be used as many times as you have
actions.
        So, in MCPG, a typical combat monster\'s 4-action initative might
look like:

                Action 1 -- Fires ten-round burst at first target
                Action 2 -- Switches target
                Action 3 -- Fires ten-round vurst at second target
                Action 4 -- Butt-strokes HTH-range third target

        So, if there are no rules in MT to cover it, I\'d say that if they
have effectively fired for a full intiative round (the entire mag) there
won\'t be enough "real time" to do a mag change...  however, working within
the constraints of the the ROF, they should be able to fire mutliple
targeted bursts, to reflect thier improved reflexes and reactions.

        JMHO, IYTU YMMV.  YAAA.  BYE.

No, the Earth is not uniformly distributed, the Milky Way is *far* from
uniformly distributed.

But, just to add something to this discussion, there is an ambient level of
stray molecules out there which have an infinitesimally small gravitational
effect.  They probably have less of an impact than your own vessel, but the
point is that you can\'t  get an Absolute Zero gravity condition.

Yes, that\'s the direction MTU went.  The drive, energy expended and
displacement mass for jumps aren\'t the problem, IMTU it\'s the
sensors and controls that are the limiting factor.

When the astrogator looks into his "tank" he is using specialized
sensors to "see" masses at multi-parsec ranges.  He has to be able
to precisely locate them and by adjusting controls lock onto the
right one with that "gravitic hook" I mentioned yesterday.  At
higher TL\'s (and I break TL\'s down into technology subgroups) better
sensors and controls can be built allowing longer jumps to be made.

Additionally, *very* skillful astrogators *can* exceed the stated
limits of the technology (succeed at more difficult tasks) and make
longer jumps than rated for their jump system.  So, if they have the
fuel and energy available, the desperate PC\'s can attempt a two
parsec jump in their Jump-1 rated ship.  Note they have to be pretty
desperate to try it, and they better have an *ace* astrogator
aboard. <g>

IAC, combining these two ideas allows me to have half steps in jump
technology.  A culture can increase their jump tech by 1, 1+, 2,
2+...etc.  At the + level the sensor/control technology for longer
jumps isn\'t quite there yet, but with ace astrogators ships can be
more easily pushed to longer jumps.  This creates situations where
having a very skillful astrogator aboard give a ship a significant
advantage over one with a with a less skillful one.

IMTU, I might rate a ship\'s jump system at Jump-2+ instead of just
Jump-2.  This means that it takes an Average task to make a Jump-2,
but is capable of a Jump-3 with success on a Formidable task.  This
would be opposed to a Jump-2 rated ship needing success on an
Average task for 2 and a Staggering task for 3.  Note the 2 parsec
jump didn\'t get easier, just the jump beyond the system\'s rated
capability.

Now the downside.  <g> Failure to make a task where the astrogator
pushes the jump system past its limits results in a misjump.  A
normal failure means the ship makes a Jump-0 (usually stays right
where it tried to jump from), and the ship just wastes a week and
its fuel.  OTOH, a critical failure means we go to the misjump
tables where *bad* things happen.

This is MTU, of course, but I think it adds a lot of flavor.

	Once again, I\'m no physicist, but I though that the

	Thus, the mass of the planet is what counts, and a
	planet wither lower density (like a gas giant), with

	smaller jump limit.

But the *diameter* of a body depends on both the mass *and* on 
the density. The lower the density, the bigger the diameter.

That is, a sphere of ice that weighs 1 kilo will be a *lot* 
bigger than a sphere of iron that also weighs 1 kilo. And that\'s 
because ice is much less dense than iron.

So since the jump limit is based on *diameters*, density has to 
be considered."

	I understand that, but doesn\'t that also mean that the
	jump limit for low-density objects like gas giants and
	most stars would be less than 100D? (cf. Dom\'s comment 
	above)

Some years ago the French magazine Casus Belli (reccomended if you can read
French) had a Star Wars scenario in what was, basically the Rebellion
version of M*A*S*H. 

I\'ve never played it, but it seemed very good. Among the various plot ideas
proposed:

- - Cut through Red tape and circumvent "official" channels to get a rare
medical compound in time to save someone.
- - Foil the attempts to close down the facility (or just tighten up
discipline in it!)
- - Bust a drug ring in the base. This is a favour to a shady character which
fears that drugs would cause a full 
  investigation by Rebellion officials.
- - The usual chase/be chased stuff with TIE Fighters and other Imperial
vehicles.

the jump drive needs the space, and the 100 planetary diameters is intended
to be a \'rule of thumb\' rather than a fixed physical constant.

I thought more for an advantage to "cheat" and be an overwatch kind of thing. 
 "Uh oh, what\'s going on?" when the agents institute a change (deja vu) or 
something.  And of course to give u any skills you might need.  :-)

I\'d use that, but think it sounds enough like Computer Empathy (at least in 
effect), that\'ll just use that.

I\'ll probably end up using my idea of having willpower to automatically grant 
outstanding success (or maybe another level "super success" or something, w/ 
enhanced effects w/ willpower at a more difficult level, ala the skyscraper 
jumping).

I like that idea.  The computer on the ship or facility or whatever has such 
skills in storage and, subject to memory capacity, can d/l that out.  It\'d be 
helpful to know if Trinity still knows how to fly that helicopter...  I\'m 
probably leaning on too many and have a psychotic episode.

Yeah.  Neo\'s could either be considered a special case... or just have 
computer empathy (or Matrix Synergy, whatever) to be able to instantly alter 
rules around a possessing character.

I don\'t think the Operators had to never have been hooked up.  Tank and... 
the big guy, whatever his name was (Hoser?) just *couldn\'t* enter the Matrix 
because they were natural born humans, didn\'t have all the jacks (are the arm 
and leg ones necessary?  or just the head one?).

My idea of rapid-fire has been that the person is more conserned with
shooting then aiming. (Hence, the increased difficulty) Here\'s an
interesting question then: Would the person conducting rapid-fire have more
time to aim? Essetially getting all three (12 including auto-fire) attacks
from rapid-fire but not having the difficulty penalty? What about a
decreased penalty, say -2.

Oh.  I just saw that different, i guess, due to my interpretation on what 
Morpheus
told Neo.  I don\'t think we see any "breaks" by anyone except Neo, which we\'d 
justify by being Matrix Synergy or Computer Empathy or whatever...

How?  I mean, the real mind and body is still being used.  Remember when 
Cipher unplugs the others, they died in the Matrix.  I wonder if the Agents 
would\'ve really reinstalled him into the Matrix anyways or if they were just 
telling him what he wanted to hear.  It\'s very difficult to see how he could 
ensure their cooperation (should\'ve said to reinstall them first and leave 
the ship).

And him coming back from the dead.  The speed movement used to dodge bullets 
also was restricted to Neo and the Agents (the latter apparently can\'t 
actually stop them, though I suppose they could do Electronic Combat (Vampire 
Fleets) w/ each other).

In the context of YTU?  No, it doesn\'t, if you\'ve detailed such things.  But 
isn\'t
your argument that drop tanks destroy the setting and/or are unviable and
unthought of technology?  You and Hans (and I) aren\'t arguing the same point, 
it seems.

> Even if it doesn\'t directly affect the PC, the description
> of the backgrond is something that I want to be consistent.

It\'s incomplete if you base it on previously published material and isn\'t 
inconsistent at all (if anything, there seems to be some dispute about the 
true merits and flaws of drop tanks).  If you\'ve gone ahead and drawn your 
own conclusions (for YTU), that\'s fine w/ me.  I just take exception to when 
you make your claims all encompassing.

You still do not get Jump 6 ships, but ships that can do multiple jumps (w/ 
the associated lengthening of the voyage durations).  There\'s a difference 
there (beyond book 2, that is).

That is an absurd military assumption, though.  The most reasonable thing to 
do
(if it\'s possible, and it\'s not w/ FFS2 T-plates IIRC, in which case you 
should jump out as far as possible and bring tankers), you jump to the oort 
cloud, refuel, get a measure on defending forces via c-lag, and then 
microjump in (keeping a significant reserve to jump out, if necessary).  
Fleets only duel when they have to (especially w/ reactionless drives).

For big military ships (like I always do w/ the Hivers), there will be extra 
tankage 
if the designer is worth his salt (IMTU, the Federation Navy, even in the New 
Era, maintains a standard of Jump 4 drives w/ J5 tankage).

Me neither.   We have at least *one* thing, in common.  :-)

Sure.  But the rapidity of the change, and thus it\'s effects on the PCs via 
the background, is very debatable (I\'d say you\'ve been refuted, and not just 
by me,
but i\'m sure you\'d argue the point).  And just because you havent\' featured 
such in your adventures, that means the changes aren\'t happening?  Have you 
actually tried to see what drop tanks would actually do?  I\'m not being 
accusatory there, actually asking.

Which ties into the above.  There\'s nothing to indicate their being driven 
out of business.  If anything, they should be in the drop tank business 
themselves.
This is if there hasn\'t been a backlash against drop tanks by 1120 (when i\'m 
assuming YTC is), as was mentioned earlier.

Would assuming every megacorp and shipping industry already is running drop 
tank operations (possibly limited to bigger ships, for whatever reason) be 
beyond what you\'re willing to do?  At least concieve of it?

        Hi again, Shawn....
        The only real reason to "rapid fire" a weapon is to "hose down" an
area to keep some schlep from sticking his head up, or to ensure what you
are firing at is "dead-Dead-DEAD-*DEAD*!"....  In the first case, basically
you are letting the recoil dance the muzzle around the beaten-zone and
really that 12 attacks all ought to hit seperate targets;  if you are
visible, you are attacked.  If you are not, you are safe.  So if there are
three targets, 9 attacks rip up the landscape and dramatically break the
windows, the other three *might* hit something...  just roll "to hit" with
no skill level on the part of the firer and taken into account armor effects.
        In the second case, by definition, you *are* aiming, and treat that
attack normally.

        As before, JMHO, etc....

Well, now the question lies in the drive sizes.  A jump 1 vessel takes 2%
drive (I think) but a jump 2 takes 3%.  I can see the initial 1% as
baseline ship preparation gear, like the jump grid and anything to
maintain the jump field integrity.  The rest of the drive is directly
proportional to distance.  Maybe the rest of the drive is either energy
generation or fuel pumping gear.  But again, its screwy because the 36 pc
misjump invalidates the requirement. grrr...

Perhaps much of the extra 1% (going from the Jum-1 to Jump-2 ddrive) is
the weight/volume of dedicated information processing systems to handle
the jump-targeting for the added distance. Maybe even extra (dedicated)
sensors, imaging, gravitic detection instruments, etc.

IIRC, the canon explanation is that there are "levels" of jumpspace that can 
entered, so it is a boundary of some kind (physical, energy, something 
else?).  Jumpspace dimensions 1 through 6 can be entered w/ the appropriate 
drive (the higher come out later in TLs).  7-36 are only entered through 
misjumps, as are levels higher than the max drive rating one possesses.

A bit ship could carry more fuel tanks, or maybe be able

Well, the TNS entry says it is being used commercially.  Also,
the difference between the first two and the last two is alot
bigger thant the differnce between the last two.  (Also, they
have issues on how they change the military situation, see
my post on changing the need for high guard situations).

The only think that retards commercial satalite launches is
government subsidies (NASA is getting out of the business and
this has caused a lot of commercial ones to get into it).
As far as manned flight goes, there is no commericial
interest in that.

Because it works.  If new technology offered some big advantage,
it would be used.

Unlike Traveller ships, fuel space doesn\'t take up such large
amounts of space.  Civilian aircraft can build planes with plenty
of range and they don\'t need to gain every bit of performance that
military jets need.

They are so simple, it is hard to see how that could be.

Actually, you can take a jump-1 ships, make it jump-6 and
still carry something like 30% more cargo.

The original quote your Sig is based on is

I tried once to write a story called "A Gun Alone" based on that.

That\'s a lotta dice rolling. IIRC, the rules (probably TNE and CT which
I usually remember best) say roll one d6 for direction, and then 1d6 *
d6 for distance, so it is in a straight line.

In fact, that makes sense, since all other jumps, mis or otherwise are
in a stright line.

I was talking about the \'unawakened\' humans.
For the jacked in, I assumed that pulling the plug with the conscience was
in the Matrix was death for normal physiological reasons, no juice to the
brain or something like that.  There is some inconsistency there though.

Althogh its an interestin parallel to the silver cord ideal in astral travel.

Not here.  The characters represent, so its been said:

Subject: Re: Jump Limits

> <wild Jump theory>

[Clipped]
I think that one issue that needs to be addressed is why jump-2 is
significantly more advanced than jump-1.  And why jump 3+ is more
advanced
than earlier versions.  Since misjumps allow up to 36 parsec jumps with
even
a jump-1 vessel, it can\'t be a physical boundary.  That pushes me in
the
direction of a control issue, i.e. advances in technology allow for
more and
more precise alignments allowing for jump "locks" at further
distances.
>>>> (end of quoted material)
The impllication from comments in various editions of the rules suggest
that Jump-6 is some sort of barrier, and that controlled Jumps are not
possible beyond it at least until Grandfather\'s TL (and its not clear if
he can do it either).  I don\'t have my books at work or I would try to
find the quotes.  A vaguely similar situation would be the speed of
sound speed limit in the 30s and early 40s.  [I do mean VAGUELY, so
don\'t fuss at the details of this relationship too much.]  In the 30s
and 40s, many scientists though that solid materials couldn\'t go faster
than the speed of sound in the atmosphere (most people weren\'t worried
about space yet).  They pointed to the fact that as airplanes got close
to the speed of sound, they started shaking violently, and control
surfaces were suddenly not functional.  I know that on the P-38
Lightning they put a sort-of barbell shaped thing on the elevator on the
tail to increase control of the plane when it got very close to the SoS
(as it did when it went into a steep dive).  Relating this to Jump,
perhaps Jump-6 is some kind of natural barrier, in that the technical
understanding of Jump space and the making of machinery to use the
higher Jump spaces makes a sharp jog up at that point.  It is clear that
there is some kind of jog in technical understanding needs to take place
early on as Jump-1 comes at TL9 and Jump-2 doesn\'t come till TL11. 
Perhaps the understanding to make controlled Jumps only comes at TL20 or
21?

To push the analogy beyond the breaking point (flame-bait anyone?),
lets tentatively match Aerospace technology with Jump drive technology.

Jump-1 might be equivalent to early, powered balloon flight (early
zepplin technology).  It has the ability to get you up off the earth in
a reliable way, but has very limited capabilities beyond that
(especially if you look at really early wood-burning hot-air balloons). 
Related to Jump drives, we have the early models of the Terrans that
would only do Jump-0 (insystem Jumps) and later Jump-1.  We see a very
basic WAG view of Jump space and the technology to make it usable.

Jump-2 might be equivalent to manned kites.  These represent a quantum
jump in understanding of aeorodynamics over balloons, and allow some
real control though still quite at the mercy of the elements.  While the
Terrans can see that the Vilani can do Jump-2, it takes a paradigm shift
to move on to enough understanding of Jump space to allow Jump-2.  The
Vilani didn\'t have that kind of example to get pushed by, but you
remember it took them a LONG time to finally get the idea that Jump-1
wasn\'t the end.

Jump-3 might be equivalent to early powered flight.  Very low speed,
but increased ability to go where you want rather than where the
elements take you.  When the Terrans realized that Jump-1 wasn\'t the
end, and Jump-2 follows once you understand the universe a bit better,
they were able to say "So why can\'t we do Jump-3?" and set about to
figure it out.  Their increased understanding enabled them to get a Jump
on the Vilani [pun intended] and begin the RoM.

Jump-4 might be equivalent to WW I aircraft.  An order of magnitude
faster than early powered flight, with better understanding of
aerodynamics, and much better equipment to get you up and working at
useful things rather than just sight-seeing.  Jump-4 seems a logical
step after Jump-3, but the understanding of Jump space had to get
better, and technology had to advance to the point of being useful for
these greater differences.  There is a pseudo-barrier at this level
since the biplane and wooden prop technology got stuck in people\'s minds
and they had to look beyond these to go to greater capabilities.

Jump-5 might be equivalent to aircraft from the 30s and early WW II. 
Much faster and more capable, with longer ranges and more reliability. 
Still some odd ducks in the mix though.  The refinement of ideas that
were present earlier, but finally get meshed and understood in Eureka!
type fasion.  "Oh, putting in rivets that are flush with the skin makes
a significant difference in how fast the plane can go."  "Oh, having
Zuchai crystals with these impurities makes a difference.  And you want
the Lanthanum hull grid to make these kinds of angles and curves going
around airlock and cargo doors so that you get maximum economy of energy
use during Jump."

Jump-6 might be equivalent to the best aircraft of WW II and the late
40s.  Almost at the speed of sound, with most of the bugs worked out. 
Hitting real physical limits on advances though, without changing their
understanding of aerodynamics.  "You know, these new Jump-6 drives are a
marvel.  Truely wonderful.  But you know the current Jump theory says
there ought to be 36 levels of Jump space.  Just think about all those
strange misJumps we hear about sometimes.  I wonder why Jump drives
shiver into their component bolts or disappear in an incredible blast of
light never to be heard of again when you try to set them for Jump-7. 
Oh well, hand me the hydrospanner will you, there is some fluidic
deformation on this nose lanthanum grid area that looks quite odd.  We
are getting some strange effects on this experimental vehicle aren\'t
we?"

Going beyond Jump-6 might be like going to transsonic airframe shapes
and moving to jet propulsion instead of props.  Perhaps at TL17 or 18
you get a new understanding of Jump space that leads someone to make a
much better Jump-6 drive.  Maybe it takes more fuel, or has a much
bigger flash when entering or exiting Jump space.  Perhaps it "roils"
Jump space where it enters so that another ship can\'t use that exact
entry area for a few days.  However, this change in drive technology
doesn\'t seem to have the same upper limit.  "You know what they say of
Vargr drives don\'t you?  You Barium! <laughter>  We all know that Barium
was only useful for Jump-1 drives, and had a lifetime of only a few
thousand Jumps.  It took the move to Lanthanum hull grids that allowed
us to move to Jump-2 and higher, and a lifetime in the tens of thousands
of Jumps (long enough for several generations of spacers to use a
particular hull).  We haven\'t changed from the Lanthanum grid in 2500
years, and I think this may be at least partly the cause of our Jump-6
limit.  We are going to try this new starship with a Europium grid and
this new synthesized crystal that has a much more specific set of
impurities than naturally occuring Zuchai crystals.  We also have hooked
up a new anti-matter power plant and retuned the Jump drive so the
hydrogen fuel is used at a speed an order of magnitude greater than any
tried before.  We think this will allow us to go further though it
promises to use a lot more fuel.  We\'ve plumbed this test ship for drop
tanks so we can get enough fuel, and we had to strip out the maneuver
drive to make room for another tank.  I\'ve also been listening with
great interest to Dr. Kagashima\'s theory on the background gravitational
effects and his ideas of Jumping along the Great Rift instead of across
them.  If this new setup we have on this ship looks like it is going to
work, I think I will offer to work with him and try to combine our
research."

Anyway, more wild Jump theories in the above paragraphs.  I hope you
enjoyed reading this as much as I did writing it.

Remember, this is MTU, not the OTU.  <g> Having said that, on to
your questions.

At *Electronics* Systems Tech Level (ESTL) 15 your supplier could
build a Jump-4 suite.

In theory, yes, you could have your J1 suite pulled, and a J4 suite
installed.  You would also have to expand the ship\'s fuel tankage
from 10% to 40% of ship volume and make sure the jump capacitors
have been beefed up to hold the increased charge.  I suspect this
would require pulling other systems from the ship to make room, and
on a warship that might mean either offensive or defensive weapons.

An expensive proposition, but doable. <g>

There is one more limitation I should mention.  The coil and grid
system have a max and min hull volume that can be built that varies
by JSTL (Jump Systems Tech Level).  The ESTL and the JSTL don\'t
always progress in lock step either.

MaxVolume = 7 * JSTL^4
MinVolume = 150 - (JSTL*4)

               DTon

  19    912,247      74
 
With this further limitation, it\'s usually a lot more cost effective
to build a new ship than to upgrade your TL9 warship, especially
with a 6 TL difference.  If the difference in TL is only 1 or 2 it
could be worth it.  

This situation might come up in various situations.  In a relic (TNE
like) environment it might be all you *can* do.  In a patchwork of
pocket empires of varying TL\'s, it would pay to buy advanced Jump
Suites if your JSTL exceeded the ESTL, ship them in and install them
in your larger hulls.  Where there are open frontiers bordering a
large empire older, less capable, ships might be refitted and sent
out after their useful operational life in the Wall of Battle is
over.

In my AKUS PBEM, the PC\'s ship, The Mae Lee, is an old J1+ ship that
has been upgraded to J2+, losing approx 100 dtons of cargo space in
the process.  This was done when the ship was converted from a cargo
ship to an exploratory trader.  The Mae Lee can\'t make money as a
simple cargo hauler anymore.  The new owners are going to have to
supplement their income with *other* activities:  speculative trade,
special cargo/passenger haulage, and/or OTHER...as in that career
type...things. <g>

So against an otherwise equivalent starfleet that puts J-4 fuel on the J-4 
ships, your fleet won\'t win as often (10% less hull available for armor, power,
and weapons), but your losses may be less expensive than his as you
can more often retreat.

Do you install J-5 tanks so you can J-2 to the Oort cloud, J-1 to the
inner system and still have J-2 to get home?

I often find, with average stellar densities, that J-4 is used for movement
to the front while J-2 with J-2 reserve is used for movement into injun
territory. An extra jump into the Oort cloud will add a week to your
fleet\'s transit time and use more fuel, I\'m not sure the extra jump is
worthwhile:

1) You obtain data that will be 1 week + C-lag old before you can use it
(the time it takes to jump the rest of the way to the system). If you\'d
sent a scout to the Oort cloud with J-6+ tanks, it could return to base
and you could then send your fleet into the inner system with data
only two weeks older. Either set of reconaissance data will be old enough
that you can\'t depend on it, and sending just the scout keeps your
battlewagons defending your base (or forward staging area) for the 
downtime instead of sitting in an Oort cloud.

2) Even if you jump directly into a well-defended system, it would be
unlikely that an enemy force would be able to intercept you before you
could jump again (assuming you had J-4 tanks and had performed a J-2).
You probably even have time to refuel from your tanker squadron before
major contact with enemy forces (40 minutes per ship in HG, YRMV*).

Still, I could see a force inspired by Hivers using this kind of tactic - 
they\'d probably send the Scout, wait for it to come back, analyze the data, 
and still jump to the Oort cloud.

The TL-9 AG units only fuction within a strong gravity field and their
performance is extremely poor past 10 planetary diameters.  The TL-11
Thruster units are the so-called "Thruster plates" and will work just about
anywhere.

Usually the AG is used for grav vehicles, little black grav vans, grav
tanks, g-carriers, etc.  The Thruster units are generally for small/large
craft, space ships and starships.

Hope this helps,

Actually, 12 rolls isn\'t that horrible.  The standard rules mean that there are
a _lot_ of hexes within 36 parsecs which can\'t be reached on a misjump, which
seems somewhat weird.

Um...they might be defined as a \'straight line\', but they don\'t necessarily

    IMTU, Thrusters are useable in deep space & Anti-Grav units are only
useable near a large gravity source.  Like a Planet.

Below are the only two entries my MT errata lists I have pertaining to
anti-grav and thruster drives. I can send you all that I have as a zipped
.RTF file, if you\'d like.

   Page 65, Step 5 (clarification): An anti-grav unit requires a gravity
well to push against, so an anti-grav maneuver drive is less efficient at
10 diameters and beyond. The effective maneuver number of the craft drops
by 50% at 10 diameters and beyond; for example, a maneuver-2 drive drops
to a maneuver-1, and a maneuver-1 drops to a maneuver-0.5. Thruster
units do not suffer these effects.

   Page 95, right column, Special Rules (addition): A space vessel with
an anti-grav based maneuver drive has its maneuver drive number halved
when 10 or more squares away from a massive astronomical body. A
thruster based maneuver drive does not suffer these effects.

It\'s hard to learn from your mistakes when the universe cleans up after
you so thoroughly. 

This gives me an idea for an encounter. The PC\'s have a misjump, and
send for a repair vessel. A Lab Ship shows up instead, with an
acclaimed Doctor of the Rhylanor Jumpspace Institute on board, 
Her and her team want to go over every millimeter of their ship to 
gather data on the higher levels of jumpspace, since it\'s cheaper to find
ships that have misjumped and survived than it is to deliberately cause
an expensive test ship to misjump and hope it survives. 

Every day spent with scientists poking at the wrecked jump drive is
another day away from getting it fixed and another day away from
getting back to trading. Having an acclaimed top-notch scientist think
well of you (and be a contact) can be very, very useful. Who knows,
if your ship brought enough data back from the Jump-20 level the
Imperial Navy might simply buy it from you outright...or try to confiscate
it...;)

If this is an absolute requirement for a ship to make the increased jum
distance, then how does that jump-1 ship with only 10% tankage manage to
jump up to 36 hexes in a misjump? Somehow, someway, you CAN access those
higher jump-levels using only the lower amount of fuel.

I would say that no matter what, a ship that misjumps suffers some kind of
damage - overload to the cpacitors, or similar damage. Of course, I do NOT
claim to be a gearhead. This would be for dramatic value, and to possibly
trap the characters on a primitive world for some time while they make
repairs  :)

True, but not in this case.  In the descriptions of such devices it says
that anti-grav units have their thrust halved if they are more than 10
diameters from a planet or star.  So, your 2G drives becomes a 1G drive
if you want to fly from Earth to Mars.  Thruster units do not have this
limit.

The referee\'s manual for MT tables for maneuver drives:

TL 9 Anti-grav unit 65mw, 13.5kl, 27 tons, MCr 0.5
TL 11 Thruster unit 70mw, 13.5kl, 35 tons, MCr 0.7

I was wondering if this is in error? I am curious why the higher TL
drive
uses more power, weighs more and costs more? Typically in these
tables,
higher TL causes less power consumption and less weight.

What would be the advantage of designing a ship with TL 11 maneuver
drives,
when the TL 9 drives are lighter, consume less power and cost less?

Anti-grav is only useful in a gravity well, and gets less effective the
farther away you are.  AG can get you to the 100d limit, but they get
quite a bit less efficient once you are out of a standard orbit. 
Thrusters (T-plates) are not limited to gravity wells, and you can use
them as easily half-way to the Oort cloud as you can in low Earth
orbit.

AFAIK, heat pumps are only effective when they operate between environments
that are only a few degrees apart.  So in a warm climate, they are useful
for raising the temperature a little, but they aren\'t too good in really
cold weather.  

That\'s why they are popular for household heating in Florida, but not up
here (NY).

When the astrogator looks into his "tank" he is using specialized
sensors to "see" masses at multi-parsec ranges.  He has to be able
to precisely locate them and by adjusting controls lock onto the
right one with that "gravitic hook" I mentioned yesterday.  At
higher TL\'s (and I break TL\'s down into technology subgroups) better
sensors and controls can be built allowing longer jumps to be made.

This is MTU, of course, but I think it adds a lot of flavor.

I am a bit worried about the "gravitic hook" idea, since it implies
that you can only Jump to a large mass, and not to empty space.  It
seemed clear to me from the things the Marc has said on this list that
you can Jump to empty places that are nowhere near the 100d limit of
anything.  Perhaps I am misunderstanding what you mean by a "gravitic
hook" though.  Your ideas do add quite a bit of flavor, I just feel
uncomfortable about the hook idea.

Yep, and this is _exactly_ the kind of question that makes Jumpspace
physicists have such a high rate of substance abuse...;-)

These sorts of events make it clear that JS is very poorly understood,
and significant, orders of magnitude improvements are possible...if they
could just figure out why some misjumps go 1 parsec, some go 36, some go
boom, some pop up 300 years in the future, some just never re-appear,
and some do, only they\'re spread out as a fine free-quark mist from here

Oh, Eris is the Archetype Heretic, one of the 4 Horsemen of the TML, so
_nothing_ in his TU necessarily coincides with the OTU, and any such
coincidence is just that...<insert X-Files theme here>...a coincidence 

This does, beg the question i the OTU, just what, exactly, does the
astrogator _look_ for, if you can aim at an empty point in space.

137, 138 are stable).  If this is the isotope of Barium used by early
Vargr drives, it would make a lot of sense for the drives/hulls to be
buried after the end of their useful life (after about 10 years).  They
would have lost too much of the Barium to be useful as a Jump drive
component.
On the other hand, Lanthanum 137 has a half-life of 6000 years (La-139
is stable).  This is plenty of time for useful ships that last many
generations.
More thoughts for the wild Jump drive theory brigade.

I thought about that -- it *is* a nice pattern. But a random walk only
increases sqrt(2)/2 x as fast as a straight projection. Your average
distance, instead of 6 * 3.5 = 21pc, would be 6 * 3.5 * 0.8 = 17pc. If this
doesn\'t bother you, have at it. Otherwise, use the base throw (range and
bearing) for the 60 degree arc that the jump lands in, then randomly pick
the exact hex along the arc (the number of choices is equal to the range).

Yeah, but you die in the Matrix, your body dies "because the body cannot 
survive without the mind," remember?  And if \'unawakened\' die in the Matrix 
(or take the red pill or whatever), they get disconnected by the robot.  
Anyone thinking they were Superman or a prophet or something would be visited

Yeah.  I would think that a body who\'s mind died would go comatose or 
something... and should probably be eventually be recoverable, should medical 
attention be there, or something like that.  I\'m not a doctor, though...  
what could medically happen there?  Like the old saying that if you dream

Actually, a true random-walk increases as the square root of the number of
steps, and thus averages 8 or 9.  This is slightly lower than the average of

I did stress that this was MTU not the OTU.

Yes, I require you jump to a large mass, and not empty space.  Of
course, some of those empty hexes have "dark masses" that don\'t
appear on the jump maps.  Finding them is an important task of the
Scouts, IMTU.  Exploratory Traders love to "open routes" this way,
too.

If jumping to empty space is the OTU way, and I\'m not *sure* it is,
then you can substitute something else for the "gravitic hook" that
anchors the other end of the "artificial wormhole" at that location.
I\'ll leave that to the imagination of the readers. ;->

Since I\'m sending Steven this errata, I thought I might as well post it to
the list.

I have a copy of Striker Book 1 (3rd printing), Book 2, and Book 3 (both
4th printings). You can tell which version you have (of any Trav book) by
looking at the back of the title page. Halfway down the page is a string of
numbers. The first printing starts at number 1; subsequent reprints begin
at a later number, which is the print version, eg.:
      3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12
means you have version 3.

of paper.

STRIKER ERRATA

     The following errata have been found in the second printing of
_Striker_.

The _Design Sequence Tables_:

     On the notes to the CPR gun table, the tech level modifiers for HE
penetration are wrong. Count down one row for each _two_ tech levels above
6, as stated in Book 3.

     The tac missile propellant table has been changed, as shown at right
[now below]. Increase the weight multiplier by .1 for every km of range
over 4.

     PROPELLANT TABLE
     Range     Weight Multiplier
     1         x1
     1.5       x1.5
     2         x2
     2.5       x2.25
     3         x2.5
     3.5       x2.75
     4         x3

_Book 2_:

     In Rule 75, Naval Vessels, the _Striker_ armour rating corresponding
to a _High Guard_ armour rating of zero should be 40, not 60.

_Book 3_:

     Grav generators are available starting at tech level 8.

     In Design Sequence 2, CPR Guns, it should be stated that the effects
of illum and chaff rounds last for two turns.

     In Design Sequence 9, Tac Missiles, it should be stated that all tac
misslies have a signature DM of +2.

     The characteristics of grav modules as given in Design Sequence 10,
Drone Missiles and Vehicles, are wrong. Each kilogram of grav module costs
Cr50, has a volume of .0005 cubic metres, and produces 25 kilograms of
thrust.

     In Design Sequence 11, Aircraft, the agility formula should be
altered. Instead of the term MS/100, substitute the direct fire hit DM
(from the combat tables) corresponding to the aircraft\'s maximum speed.

     Note that aircraft agility in _Striker_ is not the same as agility in
_High Guard_. To find a spacecraft\'s _Striker_ agility, determine its
maximum speed by checking its _High Guard_ agility against the grav speed
table; then use the aircraft agility formula.

You may be interested to note that the last errata above gives an agility 6
starship a frighteningly high turn of speed (the _Striker_ table is the
same as the speed table in the MT Ref\'s Manual, FWIW) - from memory about
3000+ kph.

>From an examination given by the Duke of Regina\'s Preparatory Academy,
in the course Fundamentals of Starship Operations (usually taken in the
year before graduation):

The astrogator is looking into a tank in preparation for jump.  Pick the
answer that most accurately describes what he looking for:

(a) He is looking for his blind spot and will note its coordinates in
the tank\'s coordinate system.

(b) He is looking for certain geometric shapes that cannot exist in
normal space and will direct the ship through the appropriate one.

(c) He won\'t be able to see anything unless he\'s been eating melange.

(d) He is looking for several numbers.  He, the captain, and the other
starmen will each perform a complex calculation with those numbers,
using only pen and paper, and compare their results.  If all agree, they
will jump.

Work accurately and as quickly as you can.  If you finish before the end
of the test, look over your answers.

But Antigrav differs from T Plates - it\'s a contragrav like system, and is

Why can\'t you misjump7? I thought you rolled 1D to see how many dice to

The MT combat rules are not at all clear. That\'s why I really appreciated
Joe\'s explanation. Just wish he had broken down rapid fire into a fuller
explanation like the others!

I agree with your analysis. The rule states that they empty the mag *in
that round* and must spend the next turn reloading. This is a mechanical
thing. Just like AD&D, where you can\'t use a wand twice in one round even
when Hasted. ;-)

Anyway even if a player argued that they should be able to conduct rapid
fire AND reload in 6 seconds, for game balance I would say NO. However, I
would say that they can reload _and conduct normal fire_ during the next
round - you just need to impose a suitable initiative penalty.

Actually, if you sit down and do some calculations, you\'ll find that
this is wrong. 

First thing, the "distance" is not fixed, but in terms of planetary
*diameter*. Therefore, the limit must depend on *something* that varies
with the *size* of the planet. 

The default Traveller planet, be it size 1 or size A has the same
density as Earth. So, since they have uniform density, it turns out
that their mass depends on their diameter.

Size    dia     mass

1       1/7     (1/7)^3
2       2/7     (2/7)^3 
3       3/7     (3/7)^3
4       4/7     (4/7)^3
5       5/7     (6/7)^3
6       6/7     (6/7)^3 
7       1       1
8       8/7     (8/7)^3
9       9/7     (9/7)^3
A       10/7    (10/7)^3

So the mass goes up as the cube of the diameter. But we need something
that goes up *linearly* with diameter.

Acceleration due to gravity goes as mass (thus 3rd power), but also
*drops* as the square root of distance (1/2 power). Thus acceleration
varies as the 3/2 power of diameter of a fixed density body. So that\'s
no good.

The rate at which acceleration changes (aka tidal force, aka gravity
gradient, aka curvature of space) varies as the *third* root of
distance. and directly as mass. So that gives a variance of 3/3 or 1
with respect to diameter of a fixed density body. That matches.

Please could you explain this in a little more detail? 

What calculations should I do?

I suspect you are right but I am having trouble following the argument.

Why is the jump limit for a 3 solar mass black hole different from a 3 solar
mass star, using your method?

The answer is, of course, both (b) and (c), for the following reasons:

The astrogator is looking for Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds (hereafter
abbreviated LSD).  Since LSD cannot exist for long in normal space, this
ties in with answer (b).  Further, since seeing LSD (and related
phenomena) is often directly related to eating unusual substances, (c)
is also part of the answer, although whether the substance in question
is melange is dependent on the biochemistry and culture of the
astrogator in question.

Using his method, it isn\'t.  Using the standard method, it is dramatically
different (and forces arguments about what an \'object\' actually is; is a blob
of plasma an object?  Presumably it is, a star is a blob of plasma.  Of course,
an interstellar gas cloud is also basically an extremely low density blob of
plasma...and might be dozens of lightyears across).

The anti-grav drives only work at 100 percent inside a gravity well. Once
outside 10 diameters, efficiency drops to 10 percent of rated thrust.

Thrusters, on the other hand, always work - although there a few on the
list who use a house rule that has thrusters dropping off in efficiency at
some far distance from a gravity well (1 AU?). They have Pluto supplied by
fusion rocket, and when in empty hexes thrusters are only useful for
station-keeping.

Don\'t do it, Shawn! "Must... control... gauss... rifle... of... death..."

Seriously, for game balance I would say no. For a character reason, I would
argue that the recoil in rapid fire prevents you from aiming properly, even
if you are using slow drug.

BTW, you may also consider inflicting the PC with some sort of drug
dependancy if they are going to use this as a constant tactic. ;-)

Anthony asked:
>What method do people use to determine what system a misjump lands you in?

 Well, for me personally, it is a plot device to get the PC\'s somewhere you
want them to be. If you truly calculate misjumps as per the rules, 50-60
percent of the time you\'ll wind up in an empty hex with no fuel. The
remaining 40 percent of the time the PC\'s will wind up where you don\'t want
them to go, probably derailing your plot line. Do you really want to do
this to your campaign?

If the answer is yes, then it is _still_ a plot device.

If no, then just pretend to roll randomly (it should be a ref\'s roll or a
confrontation task anyway, since the PC\'s don\'t know if jump was successful
until they emerge) and place the ship where you want it to be.

Certainly, you can use random rolls as a guide, but don\'t be a slave to
them (or any other rolls, for that matter).

        I do 1d random direction, followed by 1d for number of distance
dice, and then throw that many dice for the distance misjumped.  I always
terminate the jump in a gravity well, even if it means "cutting short" or
"running out" the misjump by a few parsecs.  IOW, the misjump *always* comes
out in a star system.  
        I then roll 6d-6 x10 for number of AU from the star....  Every once
in a while you get some poor schmuck who survives a 40-parsec misjump only
to come out one the edge of the photosphere of a star...

Yeah, but remember, this is Hivers.  If the odds are even against capital

The astrogator is basically a really large Everglades Alligator.  So large
as to be of astronomic proportions, in fact.

The collapse of the Vilani Empire was in no small part caused by this
horrible creature, which was consuming entire Vilani fleets on their way to
combat the Vargr corsairs.  After having eaten enough, the Astrogator went
into a 300 year hibernation, but was awakened in time to give birth to a
large number of smaller children (lower-case astrogators) just before the
collapse of the Rule of Man empire.  The central bank at Hub/Ershur refused
to recognize a bank draft from a regional bank not becuase of economic
weakness, but becuase the accompanying letter of credit (along with the
courier) had been consumed by a young astrogator who had somehow made its
way onto an Imperial courier ship.

The sharp downturn in space traffic that accompanied the Long Night made
for a hungry time for the astrogators, and the species largely dies out.  A
few survived in Zhodani space, and some were living high on the hog in
Hiver space, devouring multi-tentacled yummies.  After about 1600 years,
the species was able to make a dramatic comeback, and were responsible for
the missing Imperial X-Boats carrying word of Strephon\'s survival in 1116,
which directly led to the very harsh (but astrogator-filling) Rebellion
period.

I could go on, but I have milked this about as far as my conscience will
allow....

I agree that rapid-fire rattles the gun a bit. That\'s why I think 2 normal
attacks or 1 rapid-fire attack is all the character gets. Besides, 2 normal
attacks will on average cause more damage then 1 rapid fire attack.

I was considering an alternative to the autofire/damage rules.

If the same target is "targetted" more then once, then only +1D is added to
the damage. Only 1 to-hit roll would be made. The loss of the rest of the
dice would result in the "spread of fire". I think this would help speed up
combat. I think it would tend to get too bogged down with having to roll
to-hit 4 times every round with a guass rifle. The character would have the
option of 1 target at 7D, 2 targets at 5D, 3 targets (1 at 4D, 1 at 5D) and
4 targets all at 4D.

I\'m asking a lot of rules questions lately, because I have been
out-of-the-game for a while (about the time TNE came out, I stopped playing
due to starting a business and getting married) Back then, I was a player,
but now I am trying to start a new game and so I need to be the ref. (which
I have no problem, I\'ve been DM\'ing D&D for a long time) but I\'m just trying
to recall how we handled things in the old games. The ref would allow us to
take "combat slow" drug before combat. Then we would rapid-fire/reload every
turn. I thought it was a bit extreme, but I was a player, so I didn\'t mind
that much. Reflecting on the ways that ref handled things, I think many
things didn\'t \'jive\'. From what I could tell, he didn\'t have any books, he b
ought MT, but never read it. Just used it for character generation. The
rules were basically what he remembered from CT. (So, now you can imagine a
bunch of guys in combat armor carry guass rifles (2 duct-taped together), on
combat-slow, conducting rapid-fire and reload every turn. Of course, with
the adventures he put us on, we kinda needed it. He would send "terminator"
style cyborgs on us that could withstand all kinds of damage.

As for the drug dependancy, our characters from those days didn\'t need to
worry about dependency, by the time any withdrawels would take effect, we
were either in combat or dead. One of my buddies would come to the game with
several characters already made (so he could jump right back into the
action) I remember one where his guy liked ARL\'s. Of course, that character
didn\'t last long. (If he had survived the time he took his ARL on a boarding
mission, we probably would have given him a long walk out the airlock)
(Again, we have to look back at that ref\'s tendency to not read anything,
and assume that an ARL actually fired big rockets and not 10mm rocket
propelled slugs.)

That\'s why I like this forum so much. Being able to draw on other people
expertise to answer scientific questions.

I think the OTU canonical reference to empty space jumping was jumping to
some location where Grandfather had pinched off a pocket universe.  I
still think that a pinched off pocket universe would have some sort of a
gravitic anomoly associated with it and thus the gravitic hook thing
still applies.

My theory about velocity in jumpspace being inversely proportional to the
gravity you\'re passing through does allow for empty space jumps, but
accuracy is incredibly difficult.  You would need incredibly accurate
timing and would have to kill the jump drives manually.  A couple seconds
off and you\'d be light years off course.  Jumping to a gravity body has
the combined benefit of slowing you down (for a better safety margin) as
well as automatically kicking you out of jumpspace near a gravity body.

Exactly. When you are writing an adventure set on Vanejen, you don\'t waste
space on a description of the passenger traffic between Rhylanor and Mora.

Sure, but there a natural limits. One is the amount of background information
you can write about a game universe. Isn\'t it equally odd that no description
of the politics of the Darrians mentions the Avalar Consulate, a large,
Zhodani-friendly multi-stellar society about as close to the Darrians as the
Imperium is? Or what about Strend? A TL 15 society with 2 billion inhabitants
lying less than 10 parsecs from Imperial space ought to be a major minor
player in the politics of the Marches, but what have we heard about it? Zip.
Does that work for me? On one level, no. Of course my PCs _ought_ to be able
to look up a hefty library data entry about Strend. On another level I accept
it, because I realize that no game company can put out enough material to
cover a fraction of a sliver of a smidgin of the information that OUGHT to
be available about a game universe.

That would IMO be the case with or without drop tanks, but that\'s another
debate.

>X-boats do become pointless.  

Actually, no. Drop tanks ships aren\'t cheaper than their normal counterparts.
They are more expensive. In GT quite a bit more expensive. They can just
carry a greater payload, so the cost per unit (passenger or ton of freight)
goes down.

I don\'t recall any cargoes in _TA_ that was carried that all far between any
worlds that I would consider suitable for drop tank freighters. How about
some examples?

>They should be just ferrying cargo to and from the smallest worlds, they
>can\'t compete.

They shouldn\'t be able to compete with large corporate ships either (large
ships are more economic than small ships by any Traveller rules). But they
can, because they exploit the cracks between the corporate structure.

So it should, always assuming that the PCs are in a place with drop liner
service and want to go to another place with drop liner service. So?

No, unfortunately you\'re right about that, because as anyone who has played
in a TCS campaign can tell you, jumping into a system with empty tanks is
a mark of a really stupid (or desperate) admiral. But drop tanks won\'t
affect that very much. Since you can only use drop tanks if you have them,
a fleet will either have to carry them along (in which case they don\'t
benefit from them) or use them, which gives them the benefit ONCE. I don\'t
say they won\'t affect doctrine, but they won\'t be so big a factor as you
believe.

But that was IYTU, wasn\'t it? Since there are no drop tanks IYTU, that\'s
not a problem, is it? What _canonical_ adventures do you know of where this
would have been a problem?

Give me an example of a canonical timeline datum that ought to have been
affected by the existence of drop tanks, and wasn\'t.

So it would appear that they are not being driven out of business by drop
tanks. That dosen\'t prove that drop tanks dosen\'t exist.

The Zhodani already has to protect all their territory. Laying out deep
space fuel depots is very expensive, but it is possible. So the Zhodani
has to guard against a deep strike at every major world. Because almost
the only thing valuable enough to warrant the expense of a deep raid is
the possibility of destroying a major industrial world.

>letting them jump in with full loads (the Imperials don\'t have to worry

>leasure or just jump back out,

They can do that ONCE. Then they either have to wait for their drop tanks
to be ferried into the system, or to go on without them. Drop tanks may
change the tactical picture (except for those of us who have used TCS
before), but they don\'t change it beyond recognition.

A jump-2 ship like the PCs had in TA is already at a disadvantage against
jump-3 ships when it comes to long-distance freight (By CT rules the per
parsec cost of long-distance freight is lowest for jump-3). For a jump-2
ship reduced to jump-1 like in TP, the disadvantage is even bigger. So
obviously the PCs are operating "between the cracks" of the established
freight service. Whether the competition is huge jump-3 and jump-4
freighters or smaller drop freighters wouldn\'t affect the adventure.

That\'s a fair assesment.

Well, we certainly risk getting there unless the subject is explored soon.

I said that drop tanks proved that all the fuel was used up before the
ship jumped. I also think that it is a bad idea to say that it is all
turned into power. I have a handwave for that which you consider hokey.
That\'s too bad, but it works for me.

There was also "The Battle of the Two Suns" where a major battle was
supposedly fought in "empty space between to systems"...I could dig
out the reference, but that\'s too much trouble.  ;-> Personally,
I\'ve always played it that there was a super-jovan or brown dwarf in
that empty hex and the battle was over control of the jump route.

I try to always include IMTU for posts like this, because I believe
there are about as many explanations for these things as there are
Traveller players.  ;-> My personal opinion is that official
supplements shouldn\'t explain things in *too* much detail so we can
all continue to add our own explanations.

It depends and it varies.  Because space is big, communication slow, and
the Imperium very diverse, you never know what you\'ll find.  (I\'ve
briefly addressed other human interstellar states at the end of this
post.)  (This is all, in response to Brannon\'s question, in my Traveller
universe.)

When you\'re in a  monocultural high-tech star system, you\'re likely to
find people dressing similarly all over because of the homogenizing
effect of telecommunications.  

The xboat system also helps spread images from Capital around the
Imperium, but because of the nature of the Imperium -- many independent
worlds with virtually complete local control -- many worlds don\'t adopt
Capital\'s styles very much.  There has been change over time on this
issue, of course.  During the Pacification Campaigns, adopting the
Imperial Calendar (and following some other laws) was the bare minimum
required to join the Imperium and get the Marines off your back.  There
was a fair amount of "Imperialization" (with a distinctly Solomani edge)
of former members of the Rule of Man, well beyond what was required by
law.  As a result, many worlds adopted Imperial fashion and aesthetics
just to show that they were getting with the program.  By the time of
Emperor Zhakirov (r. 666-688), however, new member states weren\'t
expected to do more than the legal requirements.  

Ship personnel, and to a large extent, passengers, tend to dress
pragmatically aboard ship.  Ship personnel often wear their practical
clothes, or dressy versions of them, into startown, but sometimes some
ship personnel go to extremes of color and cut when they can get out of
uniform/sensible clothes.  Of course, what they\'re wearing may be quite
normal on Efate but completely outre/risque/weird on Aramis -- and vice
versa.

What\'s pragmatic ship dress?  It tends to be comfortable (my starships
tend to run a little cold, like C.J. Cherryh\'s), with a lot of pockets,
and flexible enough that the wearer can easily bend and twist while
working on things.  I usually describe it as: form-fitting turtleneck of
cotton jersey-feeling synthetic material, usually with zipper neck;
maybe similar long underpants; loose fitting but not very baggy pants
similar to U.S. BDUs; shoes like leather sneakers, with laces or a press
closure and soft soles, possibly ankle high; a bomber-type jacket of
soft cloth, light weight but warm, with adjustable cuffs and lots of
pockets; a cap, style based on branch of service and worn aboard ship
only if it\'s really cold.  (Hmm ... sounds a lot like what I wear on
weekends, now that I write it down.)  Jacket and pants will be less
symmetrical if they are of Vilani-inspired design, more symmetrical if
the design leans more toward Solomani tradition.  Color and insignia and
specifics of cut vary depending whether they\'re government or civilian,
and which government branch or which shipping company.  

Tech level and finances permitting, some crews or some personnel wear TL
14 or 15 vacc suits all the time in space -- remember, you can never be
too close to a vacc suit, especially on a war ship, and at high tech
levels a vacc suit can be as comfortable as longjohns.  

I also have early Imperial fashion in particular and aesthetics in
general change over time, becoming more intricate, decorated,
embellished, and eventually rococco during the Civil War.  Art students
in the Imperium still revere Empress Arbellatra for returning some sense
of order and proportion to Imperial aesthetics.  The simple clean lines
of post-bellum naval and building architecture, and to Imperial uniforms
and palace dress, owe a lot to Arbellatra\'s preferences for clarity and
stability.  Arbellatra, of course, set this new aesthetic tone for
political reasons -- she wanted to distance herself and her regime (both
as regent and empress) from the chaos of the preceding eighteen years of
civil war.  (Jean-Claude Gaulthier and Jean Giraud have not designed
anything in my Imperium since about 622, though they may have many
customers in the Vargr extents.)

In the other interstellar human states, there may be more or less
variety than in the Imperium.  For example, the Zhodanis have maintained
a pretty homogenous interstellar culture for a long time and Zhodani
architecture, design, fashion, and public art tend to reflect a Zhodani
aesthetic.  The farther from Zhodane one travels, and especially in
occupied areas, the more other aesthetic influences will influence
Zhodani style.  

Solsec closely monitors fashion in the Solomani Confederation, as one
would expect.  Solomani clothing should be modest, practical, modest,
and reflective of the particular Solomani culture of the wearer.  Did we
mention that it should be modest?

Sometime we should have a discussion about Aslan, Hiver, and K\'kree
aesthetics, but I think that we\'ll need some Aslan, Hiver, and K\'kree
artists to post ideas on web sites first.  DGP made a start in this
direction, following GDW\'s lead.  

As to Vargr fashion, you know what they say:  Ask five Vargr fashion
consultants for advice, and you\'ll get twenty different, but
passionately defended, answers.

Oh, I agree, almost all misjumps also damage the ship.  The damage
isn\'t random either, it is carefully chosen for dramatic effect.
Same with *where* the ship ends up.  Random walk?  Ha!  Ha!  Yeah,
right! ;->

You know, in 20+ years of GMing Traveller I\'ve only had a handful of
misjumps.  My players have respected the idea that misjumps are
almost always more likely to kill you than whoever is chasing you,
so, they have been careful with their jump procedures.  Besides, a
misjump is much too good a dramatic device to leave *just* to
chance.  Guess that puts me in the dramatist camp, huh?

Um ... are you sure?  How big was the file you downloaded.  I just 
tested it and it worked fine.  Did you open the file after you 
downloaded it (I know ... stupid question.  Must be an old Tech

Anybody else having problems?

In my Traveller universe, all drugs have side effects (just like real
life).  I don\'t remember the drug rules, nor have I had to use them, but
it seems to me that each use of any Traveller drug (fast, slow, combat,
medical fast) must be recorded, because you may never get all of these
drugs out of your system.  Prior uses affect the negative DM on the
saving throw to avoid typical problems:  

dependency; 

inability to function normally without the drug (e.g., if the PC got two
actions with slow drug, without slow drug he/she would have only half an
action); 

interference/synergy with effects of other drugs (Medical Officer\'s
Report:  "Lance Corporal Paskapaa is in hospital today because he broke
bones and tore muscles in his arms and hands during cutlass practice. 
Apparently, the coffee he consumed at breakfast had a synergistic effect
with combat drug remaining in his system from last week\'s boarding of
the Vargr corsair, and when he slashed, he moved so hard and fast that
his muscles overpowered his bones and broke them.  He is expected to
recover over the next several weeks.");

other effects?

Actually, there are a number of canon references to deep space jumps. What
I can remember off-hand is where the Gyro Cadiz Task Force in _Adventure 3:
Twilight\'s Peak_ plotted two deep-space jumps in its flight plan (and
conducted one). The new _Behind the Claw_ refers to Norris\' fleet jumping
out of the Inthe Pocket into deep space, refuelling from all the tankers
and leaving them to drift, and jumping out again.

Seriously though, Harlan Ellison\'s "Soldier" episode of the Outer Limits was
about two futuristic super-soldiers who end up going back in time and
battling in Anytown U.S.A. It includes a scene of the bad soldier hitting up
a Gun Shop for weapons as well as scenes of the good soldier being observed
and questioned by police and psychiatrists. There are a number of other
similarities as well.

Blade Runner seems to be more in tune with Rossum\'s Universal Robots rather
than Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. The movie diverges a bit from
Dick\'s work, which dealt mostly with identity.

As I said, I\'d like to know which Dick story the Matrix was "stolen" from. I
have a bit more than passing familiarity with his works and I\'d be really
interested to know.

I haven\'t. I\'m simply an ardent fan and student of mythology and folklore.
My point is that all works are influenced by other works, some more heavily
than others. I note, however, that you deftly sidestepped my comment about
the originality of Traveller.

<shrug> I guess, if you say so. In the messages I\'ve read that you\'ve

make massive assumptions about the world of the Matrix.

No, that\'s not quite it from what I saw. Certain things obviously could only
be done from behind the scenes. For example only Operators could guide
around those who were jacked in. Operators apparently also were the ones
with the ability to feed information directly into the brains of the others.

I guess you would probably have to have a base skill minimum, e.g. Someone

something about handling automatics. Maybe level 0 in base skill to invest a

I have no solid proof, but I guess my mind works a little differently
because I spend all of my time playing video games ;^)

For some reason I got the distinct impression that there was something else
going on as well. That one guy coded the introduction to the agents program
(the one with the girl in the red dress), and I got the feeling that they
were somehow creating the links back to the real world (symbolized by the
ringing phones).

Yeah, I happened to read your posts after I responded to Bloo\'s, it sounds

Whatever works for you. It just seemed like Trinity specifically was very

It depends on the way that you\'re going to run the game, I guess. In a
highly cinematic game she\'d probably remember how to fly the helicopter. Of
course, you can rectify the problem with a two-pronged approach: a character
can have information uploaded into her short term memory very quickly, but
it goes away after a short time (basically adventure to adventure, if you
wanted to cut down on paperwork). On the other hand, skills can be uploaded
into the long term memory of a character, but that takes much longer and
it\'s very strenuous. This is supported by the fact that Neo, with Computer
Empathy, was able to learn things for a prolonged period while everyone
thought he would give up after a few hours...

That could work too.

As I said, there was a little more there. Computer Empathy can do that, but
in a roleplaying situation you might want to increment it. For example, Neo
could dodge bullets but he couldn\'t avoid death until he came to realize
that he was the One. Further, Computer Empathy allowed him (in game terms)
to pick up skills much faster and for prolonged periods (in GURPS terms it
would be something like Eidetic Memory, each Character Point spent is equal
to several).

On one of those crappy entertainment news shows I think, and then I read
some indicators on the web. You can check out the movie web site (if you
haven\'t already) they probably have something on it. Apparently, according
to this news show, the second movie got the green light as soon as the
opening gross came in.

My post tried to show the absurdity of defining something based on diamter
only. You argue that the milky way is not an object but empty space with
mass points here and there. The same could of course be said about stars:
mostly vacuum and here and there an electron or a nucleus. The problem my
analogy tried to showcase was basically that you couldn\'t base a physical
principle on size alone as size is not so much a physical quantity as a
sociological one. We consider galaxies to be empty space with stars but we
consider stars to be full of stuff mainly because qwe live INSIDE a galaxy
and we cannot live inside a star or planet. Cosmologists generally consider
galaxies or even groups of galaxies as objects.

<snip>

I agree with you about tidal forces being the answer that fits the original
100d rule best and has some scientific validity. Tidal force however drops
off so fast (1/r^3 compared to gravitys 1/r^2) that I cannot agree with you
about there being any appreciable differences between rifts and arms.
I have my own handwave about the tidal force importance that might affect
how Traveller is played:
There are IMHO two problems about jump that I find hard to accept/handwave
namely:

1: Will ships that jump have the same velocity upon jump exit? If that is
the case that would have to be taken into account by pilots as stars have
different velocities that have to be matched (this is more of a problem in
TNE where ships delta-V are reasonably restricted).

2: Potential energy: Ships that jump from one place to another would have
different potential energy before and after a jump which basically means
that you could get energy for free. A clear break with conservation laws
(but so is floorfields, gravthrust etc as well).

My solution/handwave to number 2 is: A ship is not a point mass but has a
certain size so the potential energy at the nose of a ship is different
than the rear if pointing away from a planet. The astrogators main job is
to precalculate the potential energy at the start and destination to be
able to account for the energy differeance with the jumpdrive. This is a
fairly difficult thing as mass objects contribution to potential energy
falls of at 1/r meaning that distant objects have a higher pot energy
influence than gravity influence. This fiddling/guessing/modelling about
potential energy (which cannot be directly measured) as mainly what the
astrogator does. The main impact this handwave would have on jumping is
that the larger the ship the harder it would be to jump or rather the
further from the planet/star one would need to go.

The only problem I have with that is that what systems you\'d end up
arriving in depends on the hexgrid which at least IMTU is an arbitrary
mapping thing.

Those TMLers that consider the hexmaps to be representation of jumpspace
itself (stating that the 2D nature of the maps comes from jump theory and
that the distances between stars on the maps only very roughly corresponds
to actual physical normal space distances) have an advantage here: Due to
jumpspace quantum nature or whatever the hex representation of systems make
certain nearby systems impossible to misjump to and this is an effect of
jump theory itself.

I\'m afraid I didn\'t completely follow your example, but I like the
idea.  Isn\'t this sort of what Skill Clusters are all about?
Expanding on that idea...

Take a cluster where you have put 2 points in Auto Pistol, the first
in any, the second specialized in the Glock, and all the
sibling-skills get one point lower giving them 0 levels.

 Handgun
   Auto Pistol-1
     9mm Glock-2
   Body Pistol-0
   Revolver-0
   Snub Pistol-0
    
Can\'t say I\'m too enamored of this though, if the costs on each
level are equal what\'s to stop you from just putting points in the
highest one you can (all in Auto Pistol, forex).  Frankly, I really
don\'t want to get into different point costs for different levels.

Nice idea if you can make it work, elegantly, though.

Twilights peak mention that Gyro Cadiz and friends made several jumps to
empty space (which IMO was phrased as something scary for the crew). I
think jumps to empty space is Canon but that there should be rules that
make jumping to/from empty space harder ie more likely to produce misjumps.
The main reason for this I think comes from the numerous mentions of
"mains". Why consider mains important if a J1 ship with extra fuel can
bridge a 2 paresc gap without problem?

Either disallow deepspace jumps (cool, nobody knows what\'s really out there
but sligthly non-canon) or make deepspace jumps harder.

Sure, all of us have I would think, as have Loren Wiseman and Marc
Miller.  Compare the skills in Book 1: Characters and Combat with those
of Book 4: Mercenary and Book 5: High Guard.  There is a much higher
level of specialization reflected in the later books.  

The issue is balance, of course.  Where does specialization become
atomization, at which point the skill required for a task is so specific
that no one will have it?  "I\'ll use the telephone."  "What\'s your skill
level in Communications, wire based, analog, TL 5-8?"  "Uh, I only have
Commo-3."  "OK, it\'s a formidable task."  

On the other hand, a skill can be read so broadly as to allow the
unreasonable to occur:  "Who\'s at the helm [of the 1,000,000 dt Ancient
vessel the PCs are stealing]?"  "Me!"  "What skills are you applying?" 
"Pilot-1."  "OK, it\'s a difficult task."  

I tend not to specialize skills any more than Megatraveller does for
PCs, unless they want to be in a specific campaign setting where it
would make sense and enhance the game.  For example, in a medical
campaign, the characters might all have med-3 or med-4, but then they
would have specializations in trauma, infectious diseases, etc.  If
they\'re faced with a problem outside their specialty, they can probably
figure it out, but it might take longer than the specialist, use
resources less efficiently, etc.  

I handle NPC skills as needed by the storyline.

Since I can\'t afford the high-quality graphics programs (nor do I have the
time to learn how to use them), currently I use Word. This makes it easy
for me to inlude the drawings into my adventure documents, and to edit them
as needed. When I need to convert them to a regular graphic file (GIF, JPG,
etc.), I copy the drawing into the clipboard and paste it into my \'cheapie\'
graphics progam (Paint Shop Pro). The drawings are a little crude,
sometimes, but they\'re effective enough for running my game.

I had attempted, once, on using AutoCAD, but it required I spend a lot of
time on setting up the drawing (i.e., line types). If I were an authentic
draftsman, I\'m sure I would be more effective. I plan to try again in the
future, though.

We got to see the results first-hand in The Traveller Adventure, when a
disastrous astrogation fumble took us into deep space. Fortunately we were
travelling prepared for a second jump (Bladders). But if we\'d not been...
pray for a comet within maneuver/life support distance.

The Battle of 2 Suns was fought over a Zhodani forward base in deep space -
it may or may not have been on an asteroid. But there are other references
to jumping to deep space. None are conclusive one way or the other.

I allow it. You? Whatever you like.

I\'m not sure how much more *can* be explained. I did an analysis
similar to the above and found that one thing that *did* vary at the
proper rate was tidal force. That is, the value at 100 diameters for
any size *Traveller* planet (but not GG or Star) was the same for all
sizes.

> What calculations should I do?

Basicly, you can calculate "tidal force" at a given distance with the
formula:

	X=GM/R^3

X= "tidal force"
G= Newton\'s gravitational constant
M= mass of planet
R= distance from center of planet

The limit for the black hole is the same distance in *meters* as the
limit for the star. But in *diameters* it\'s a lot different. The
*denser* the object, the more diameters. 

So the limit for planets works out t about 100 diameters. Gas giants
and normal stars are less dense than planets, so the limit is fewer
diameters. Black holes, white dwarfs, and even nickel/iron asteroids
are a lot *denser than tpical planets, so the limit for them is going
to be *more* than 100 diameters. 

I\'m falling asleep from the painkillers right now. I\'ll try to re-run
my old calculations again and give you formulas and numbers later. I
think two formulas will do. One for figuring the limit for a given
mass, the other for a given density and size.
