Which blueprint is "standard?"  The oldest Type A blueprint I\'ve seen is
the one used in the GDW game Snapshot.  
It didn\'t seem too big.

Good point. I shouldn\'t have used the word \'standard\'. I got the
blueprint from somebody\'s web site, but it was so long ago I don\'t
remember which site. I have the file as a GIF, if anyone\'s interested.

In DGP\'s Cats & Rats, there is a paragraph that mentions a series of
Solomani long-range explorations to the Perseus Arm to rimward of
the Solomani Confederation. I do not have my resource materials here
at work, so I was wondering how much distance was covered by the
explorations. If anyone has access to the book and could help me on
this one, I\'d appreciate it.

Also, what kind of stellar density would exist in the space between
spiral arms? I imagine I could duplicate it for mapping purposes
with a roll like either a natural 2 on 2d6 or 3 on 3d6, but wanted
to get some more informed opinion on the matter before I generated
any kind of starmap for such a journey. :)

Titan Games (http://www.titangames.com) has the Judges\' Guild deckplans for
$6 in their "Special Sales Items" catalog (direct URL
http://www.titangames.com/titansite/rpg_items/Sale.html)

If you haven\'t dealt with Titan Games, they\'re a great company; just a tad
bit slow sometimes (it can take a week before they respond to your order).

These were the first deckplans I found for Traveller, and I still love them.

 This sounds like the SOpM version, which was a rounded out rendition
of the original Snapshot version (aka "The Flying Iron"). I\'ll see if I can
quickly render the Judges Guild version into an electronic form over this
weekend. It won\'t be great, but it\'ll give you something to work with...

That\'d be great! Then I can make the modifications necessary to the
adventure on the electronic form, and send that out to my players.

Much appreciated!

Mine at least.. I picked up a couple at the International Terminal Sunday
morning, and picked up their accents.  The woman was sneezing constantly
without covering her nose or mouth.  I asked here to please do so, and she
asked why it was any of my business?  "Because I don\'t have an immune
system to start with, and I have to clean thios van up at the end of the day."

Sure enough, within eight hours symptoms started showing up.

Could you be more specific? Are you sitting confused with a copy of GT in
your lap, or are you curious as to what the differences from previous
versions may be (say, before you buy it)?

Assuming the latter, GT uses simplified versions of the rules for vehicle
design and combat from GURPS Vehicles, optimized for starships and space
combat. 

The design system uses packages of components in multiples of 1 dton (=500
cubic feet, using American units for compatibility with GURPS). These
packages are supposed to be modular, in that they can be swapped around
during the design process without recursive calculations. (The resulting
vessel is *not* modular, however.)

One significant drawback of the modular approach was that a "slice" of
power plant was included in each module to meet its power requirements.
This eliminates recursive power calculations, but the resulting designs are
over-powered (they can run *all* systems simultaneously, whether needed or
not), the size of the power plant is obscured (bad when you\'re trying to
create deck plans), and minor changes in the configuration (e.g., swapping
turret lasers for missile racks) actually cause the size of the power plant
to change as well. The modular design system in GURPS Space, 3d Edition, is
a refinement of that in GT. With separate power plants and power
requirements, it is much more elegant.

The combat system is hex-based, with 10,000-mile hexes and 20-minute turns,
and uses a vector movement system (very similar to TNE\'s Battle Rider
wargame). Multiple shots over the length of a turn are abstracted into a
single roll to hit; higher rates of fire result in bonuses to the to-hit
roll. Emphasis is on character skills -- good pilots, sensor operators, and
gunners are important to successful actions. Missiles are laser command
guided, primarily because sensors small enough to mount on them are
inadequate at the ranges involved in space combat.

The ship design and space combat rules for GT were intended to replicate
the "look and feel" of Classic Traveller under GURPS rules (which, being
generic, require many specific choices to make them applicable to a given
setting). All in all, they succeed more often than not.

They tend to let the courts decide, as with recent cases involving the
disposition of unused embryos (IVF requires the creation of more
embryos than are usually implanted) and whether or not a woman should be
allowed to impregnate herself with her dead husband\'s banked sperm.

Yup.  This is the problem with the interfertility between the minor human
races in my universe.  Conception is no big deal but there are problems
during the term of the pregnancy if a roll goes off.  You see, while the
basic A/B/AB/O blood types are *fairly* well distributed among human
racial groups there are a lot of antibodies, etc, that are not --
some are rare enough to be associated not just with certain ethnic
groups but with certain localities and groups of families.

That\'s why typing blood for blood transfusions is so important and why
it\'s not enough to just know the type, because people have antibodies in
their blood that can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions that can make
you very sick and even kill you dead.  Bone marrow matches are even
trickier which is why persons of Asian descent and/or mixed race are
always being recruited.

The Rh factor is a known problem in pregnancies-- if the baby has it and
the mother does not, big trouble in second or third pregnancies-- although
there\'s a treatment that fixes that one!  Imagine the difference in Vilani
and Solomani blood types given the isolation of the two groups from one
another and the different environments they have had to adapt to.  I
wouldn\'t want a transfusion from a Vilani unless I knew I was GOING TO DIE
without it!  The likelihood of an incompatible antibody on one side or the
other would be fairly high-- probably not worth it unless your Hgb was 8
or less. 

I would think that pregnancies across these lines would carry a
significantly greater risk than normal.   Probably one that Imperial
physicians know how to deal with efficiently by 1116-- maybe as easy to
handle as giving a shot of Rhogam after childbirth-- but still not
something to laugh at.  As for carrying a human/chimp hybrid to term-- I
think that would be very difficult.

Ick.  I\'m sorry to hear that.  Of all the non-Terran-derived aliens in
Traveller, the Aslan have always suffered from "samurai Klingons with
whiskers" syndrome, which only seems to get worse with each publication.
I\'d hoped SJG would take a firm stand on this, but from what I\'ve
skimmed... well, no offense to the author(s), but ick.

I will wait breathlessly for the first Traveller art to depict the

If you\'re dealing with 1x1x3.? m cubes, then it will be easiest to
use the TNE figures for calculations. Each sq is 1/4 dton.

So, 10 sq would be 2.5 dton and the other 1.5 could be in corridors
and common areas. That fits.

Hum, 6 squares would indicate a 1.5 dton air/raft, dimensions
something like 3x2x3.5 m, right?

Hee, so this Type A carries a smaller air/raft than one you\'d like.
You don\'t think there is only *one* air/raft size do you? <g>

Hiroshi and I have often bemoaned the fact that he thought America in
general, and I thought SF in particular, would be a place where we\'d have
much more exciting lives.  But until he conquers his cultural imperative
to overwork himself and place himself at the beck and call of co-workers,
and until I conquer my tendency to get depressed and weird in the
wintertime... it prolly won\'t happen.

The 21 days books for C++ and JBuilder are good.  The one for Java

Yes, all of these I\'ve seen are pretty good.  I especially liked the
C++.

Be on the lookout for books by Tom Swan.  He\'s written for Pascal,
Delphi and C++ and I have found his books uniformly excellent.

I don\'t work for any book company, nor do I sell them, but the

I was initially thinking of just lifting William\'s
idea as is, but now I\'m thinking a little more. 
Suppose Grandfather tried to uplift hyenas first, but
found that they were too indolent for his purposes, so
then he tried wolves, which proved too
anti-hierarchical, so finally he tried humans, which
were none too successful for their own reasons (not
lucky enough, I think).  So now we have say a 400,000
year old culture of uplifted hyenas that may or may
not have interstellar travel living probably somewhere
in the Spinward Marches - Gvurrdon area.  There are
all sorts of possibilities with that.

But wait, like the Ginsu knife, there\'s more.  Suppose
Solomani Genetic Research has been trying to duplicate
the uplift of wolves that led to the Vargr race with
the objective of eventually destroying the Vargr or
replacing it with a docile slave race.  OK, wait I
have to get back to work, but I\'m going to daydream on
these ideas during the day.

.JPG wasn\'t specifically conceived for scans; it was designed for any
purpose where 24-bit color was desired, but lossy compression was 
needed.

You\'re mistaken on several points. GIF palettes (and most 8-bit/256 
color palettes you\'ll encounter) select from a 24-bit gamut (2^24 = 
16 million colors), not a "32-bit palette". "Direct pixelpopping" is 
out of fashion, and today\'s computer game artists would laugh at you
if you said "256 colors will be more than sufficient". 256 colors 
is one byte; 32 bits is technically four bytes, not three, but the 
lossy compression used by JPEG means the actual space used per 
pixel can vary widely.

Incorrect. There is no difference between 32 and 24 bit displays 
(unless you want to talk about destination alpha buffers); the 
use of one or the other generally depends on whether the video
hardware in question prefers pixels to be aligned on 32-bit 
boundaries for hardware simplification (32 bits/pixel = 4 bytes = 
nice round binary numbers; 24 bits/pixel = 3 bytes = more logic 
needed to address a pixel).

To get back to the GIF-versus-PNG thing, let my throw in my Cr0.02.

Please, please, please use PNG for all your lossless web graphics. 
The reasons? The free Unixoid operating systems (Linux, *BSD) support 
it, it\'s supported by the major browsers in use today: Opera, IE 4.x, 
and Netscape 4.x, it\'s *more* flexible than GIF in that it supports 
lossless compression of 24-bit images, and isn\'t going to have its 
licensing terms changed every time Unisys sneezes.

That\'s not unreasonable, given the character
generation system that easily leads to characters
starting out in their late 30s to mid 40s, even
assuming that they\'ve kept in very good physical
condition.

I\'m sure that we\'ll be seeing potbellies, cellulite,
and facial wrinkles real soon now.

Well, yeah, the feeding the colts in front of you just might be a

But when I give a kill - like the one that you listed - you don\'t
know whether it\'s an \'honorary\' kill (no actual programming fluid
involved), what I call a \'technical\' kill (i.e., if I wasn\'t able
to suck it down, you\'d have gotten it), or a \'hard\' kill (where
there\'s really programming fluid all over the place).

As I view it, it\'s the semantic reaction that counts, rather than
the actual presence or spewage of fluid - a kill is a kill.
Otherwise, there would be people who you could never get a kill
from, because they don\'t, as a matter of policy (either personal
or company), partake when near the computer.

(In point of fact, the one that you recorded was a \'technical\'.)

I thought it came out in October in the UK?
It just hit the stores in the US the day or two before Christmas. Good
reading so far.
My only gripe is that the first two books were divided into paperbacks here.
i.e.... 4 books instead  2 huge Hardbacks. Now the 3rd has only been
released in Hardback.
Not much of a complaint, but I like the books enough to keep them on the
shelf, now
I have get the first two in Hardback too :)

A word of note. If you are a UK reader, visit Peter F. Hamilton\'s official
website to read a small section that was cut from your versions. Its in the
US version and he wanted everyone to get to read it.

As long as you are in this country, Hiroshi _must_ break those
cultural imperatives - if he doesn\'t, he will be taken advantage
of, and will _never_ have any time for himself - or you.  Make
him return the beeper and the cellphone to the company, and
change your home phone to an unpublished number - if they can\'t
find him, they can\'t impose.

As far as getting weird in the winter time, don\'t worry about it
- - you\'re in San Francisco, which is the epicenter of Granola
Country - the land of fruits, nuts, and flakes!  Weird is
_normal_ for out there.  And on top of that, you\'re in the second
most cultural city in the United States (behind only New York,
all the way on the other edge of the country).  Go out and get
some culture.  As far as depression goes, I can\'t offer any
_useful_ advice on that, but I believe that a four (it would be
four for that distance here - probably six out there due to
traffic) hour drive will get you to where even in winter, it
feels like summer.  That may help...

If we lived together, I would do exactly that.  And we have had this
conversation about 1000 times!  He seems to be getting it now.  You are so

I\'ll do that as soon as I can.  I\'m just feeling low because I hate
spending New Year\'s Day (Oshougatsu) in America.  I\'ll be hanging out in
Japantown this weekend and then I\'ll feel better!

Thanks for caring.  =)

	Skip both "EPS" and PDF, and just use straight PS. The GhostScript
viewer is, unless I\'m mistaken, available on *almost* every platform
with more than 3 users, it\'s readable by the widest variety of
programs, and can be simply dumped to a PostScript printer to provide
hardcopy.

If so, why were they (S\'s political connections) upset with
Norris? (Assuming that they had a different agenda from

Finally, after Santanocheev was sacked, he demanded a board of

He continued to demand an inquiry after he had retired

Yea. And as far as I know Sumerian has been studied here for quite a long time. Also I remember seeing a documentary about this singing professor, and seeing some promo/record piture of him dressed in a flowing toga. If I just could remember his name or the pseudonym he uses on his records (docto something???)...

	CT defined 1 disp ton to be the volume displaced by one metric ton
mass of liquid hydrogen, which is 14m^3 (+/-). MT kept the definition
but changed the volume to 13.5m^3 to make life easier for
anal-retentive deckplan artists who wanted an exact number of squares
per Dt (1.5m squares, 3m deck=6.75m^3=0.5 Dt[MT]). TNE went back to
14m^3, changed the squares to 2m and 3.5m decks (7m^3=0.5Dt[TNE]),
and reminded everybody of the "slop" rule in drawing deckplans ...
*I* always wanted a decent 3D CAD/modelling tool so I didn\'t have to
have square ships but could still get "accurate" ship layouts.

I think it\'s a Solomani name, a corruption and blend
of Spanish "Santa" or "Santana" with a Slavic "chev"
or "cheff".  

>Who were Santanocheev\'s "political and social

I\'ve assumed that he was well connected to the court
of the Matriarch of Mora.  Mora is the sector capital,
so the Matriarch (who also holds the Imperial title
Duchess of Mora) wields a lot of power in the sector.

>Were they pushing Santanocheev\'s promotions in an 
>attempt to replace Norris with someone more to their 
>liking?

No.  Norris\'s only position at the beginning of the
war was Duke of Regina; no one was trying to put
Santanocheev into that spot.  

Norris wasn\'t a serving naval officer at the beginning
of the war.  (During the war, Norris took over naval
operations in the sector pursuant to the Imperial
Warrant.)

>Finally, after Santanocheev was sacked, he demanded a

>board of inquiry into why he had been relieved (TNS 
>bulletin 010-1110)  He continued to demand an inquiry

>after he had retired (TNS bulletin 146-1110). What

Canon doesn\'t say.  

The board of inquiry would probably find that ONI was
established beyond Santanocheev\'s authority and
hampered the war effort, so Santanocheev would receive
some Imperial censure, possibly including a downgrade
in noble rank (I\'ve forgotten his noble status, if
any; is there an official UPP for Santanocheev?).  

Santanocheev would not be found guilty (nor even
charged with) any more serious offense like treason. 
He was just power-mongering, and may be able to
justify his actions based on review of intelligence
reports that were being provided to him.  

Santanocheev retired.  He might have been invited to
resign from the Navy, or he might simply have been
assigned to some job where he couldn\'t cause any harm
for the rest of his career, and decided that he\'d had
enough.  He might have just felt humiliated at his
treatment at Norris\'s hands after Norris got the
warrant.  He might have just gotten old and decided
that he didn\'t want to run any more wars, but would
rather tend his garden and enjoy his wife and
grandchildren.

Post-war Santanocheev might be an interesting factor
in a game.  The obvious possibilities are:

1) Santanocheev seeks revenge on Norris for Norris\'
exposing him as the incompetent he truly is.  The PCs
might be hired by Santanocheev to discredit Norris in
some way, or by Norris to protect him from
Santanocheev.

2) "When you get tired of checking your porridge for
broken glass, you are tired of being a sector duke." 
Norris, paranoid but not unreasonably so, plans to
whack Santanocheev.  The PCs are hired by one side or
the other.

3) Santanocheev is trying to clear his name (probably
during the board of inquiry), and hires the PCs to get
evidence, possibly in the form of testimony from
Zhodani operatives or naval personnel, or Zhodani
naval or governmental records.  This operation could
be overt, covert, or both.  The overt operation is to
hire a Zhodani lawyer to help get through the various
bureaucracies and get the Zhodani to care enough about
the problem.  The covert operation is obvious.  Both
can happen at once.

Let me let you in on a little secret among Traveller
referees.  We just make up the statistics and
histories of NPCs and pre-generated PCs.  We play with
the character generation systems enough to get a
feeling for them, sure, but when we need a character,
we just write down what we want.  (Don\'t tell anyone
else.)

The only computer program for character generation that I\'ve tried is
Stuart Ferris\'s program (for Win95).  I liked it.  You can download it
at:

http://www.bigbailey.com/vspace/stuart_ferris.htm

Note that it doesn\'t use Book 4+ rules, so you may want to "spice up"
the characters afterward.

Seriously:  anyone who spends a lot of time in space has a very good reason
to keep their weight constant.  Not being able to fit into your Vacc Suit
(tailored or otherwise) when the decompression alarm goes off is Bad(tm).

Consider also that most Traveller characters are, even now, ex-military.
They have experience with physical discipline and a tendency to maintain it
after they leave active service (that, or go completely to seed...)

If I hadn\'t done Engineering as a degree, I\'d have done Geography 
(probably with a meteorology flavour).

how to build realistic worlds and has recently been bought by my old

Interestingly the first German bombs on London in WW2 were accidental 
(dropped from a damaged aircraft).

Bomber Command responded with a light raid over Berlin and the rest, 
as they say, is history.

As an aside, I spent this afternoon with my Gran (83 years) who 
reminisced a little on the war. She lived in Liverpool, the UK port 
that was the focus of the Atlantic convoys. Liverpool suffered 
intensive bombing raids during 1941 which were hardly mentioned in 
the press as they did not want to release strategic information about 
the docks etc.

It begs the question would the Imperium routinely suppress such info 
- - I suspect they would!

Appleworks available for Win95 and MacOS and is currently badged as 
v5. It is due to be upgraded to v6 very soon (adding a presentation 
module). It also includes a paint module. ISTR that US price is $99?

Feel the same about the Atari TOS machines (ST/Falcon). Did the Amiga 
have the same rumours as Atari did about a PPC version when Commodore 
died?

To be honest, Acrobat PDF is the best format to ensure accuracy. 
Downside is that you need Illustrator or Photoshop(?) to edit the 
resulting file.

I prefer downloadable deckplans as Acrobat files.

The ability to do so was one of the design criteria for GIF. GIF has

Ahh! But the US patent office is letting companies patent plants and 
animals that have been around for years and obvious prior art (use by 
native peoples in this case) exists. ISTR one of the biotech 
companies trying this with common grain types?

IMO this is morally questionable and a slippery slope to patenting cheese.

Calling it OS/2 \'Warp\' made me laugh. Compared to Win3.1x it was slow 
and memory heavy.

Not that I objected to an attempt to crack the Wintel hegemony though.

Even after Commodore died in the US, I think either them or a German firm
was making Amigas in Europe.  Gateway purchased the whole facility or so I
was lead to believe.  The truth being that they probably wanted the
manufactoring capalities, but
had to get the Amiga to get the goods

Just another Amiga rumor  :)

Excuse me? If the original has more than 256 colors, then, yes GIF will
lose detail. But GIF is *not* limited (at least in any serious mannar)
as to image *size*. I have a couple of GIF files that were produced by
converting output from some CAD-like application. They are several
*thousand* pixels on a side. 

GIF will "waste" a bit of space if the number of colors isn\'t a
multiple of 2. But that\'s pretty trivial. It can handle anything from
mono to 256 colors.

PNG goes all the way to 32-bit color, so it doesn\'t even have *that*
limitation.

JPEGs seem to use a *lot* more CPU than GIFs. I base this on having
dealt with both on "underpowered" systems.

Argh! I *hate* that whole book! Just reading through it actually makes me
angry. Not angry because I paid money for it, or because it\'s not what I
hoped it would be, but because of the little snippets of \'flavour text\'
which I can\'t believe were edited by anyone at all (especially not by a
Traveller player - apologies if any of the authors are on this list). The
snippets which say things like;

"Gunnies are a unique breed, and Turret Gunnies are usually the toughest,
most fearless men on any ship (even though most of their crewmantes think
them insane). Enemy ships like to target the turret bubbles for practice and
the life expentancy of a turrret gun specialist, from the time his ship
engages the enemy until he dies in breathless agony, is about seven
minutes."

"If your scenario calls for large quantities of children, a deck dedicated
to play may be necessary. Playrooms should be designed with an eye toward
teaching survival skills to groups of different ages, and they must be fun."

And, of course, the infamous pneumatic spinal-mount control chair.
"Like the gunnies who man the turrets, it takes a unique person to sit in
the control chair for the spinal weapons. The job requires strength,
desterity and fast reaction time, as well as a highly developed sense of
motion and direction. The crewmen who sit at the side stations <the ones
monitoring his vital signs> are usually the next to occupy the weaponeer\'s
chair, and are trained to take over the firing position in an emergency."

Sadly, I\'m incapable of throwing anything away, so the book is still with
me.

This was done in the artwork accompanying a Martian Metals ad in the early

Jaquays, I believe, did the art. The figure was part of their line also.

From GURPS Traveller Second Edition:

	"The base weight, volume and the reactor core cost are included in the
engineering module that every vessel requires....(Power plant slices
actually within turrets and bays represent the necessary power conduit
connections.)"

As for being able to run **all** systems simultaneously, Star Trek
notwithstanding, as an old Navy man I can tell you no seaman would dream of
serving on a ship that didn\'t have excess power generation capability. I can
only assume that spacers would feel the same. Remember fusion power is
cheap. Fuel for jump is expensive (at least in terms of tankage and such).
But power itself is cheap. (A milieu 0 campaign might be different, but in
the Twelfth Century Imperial an undamaged ship should never want for power.)

=====================

WJP Looking For Actor/Actress In Houston Area:

I need a boisterous actor or actress to carry a corporate video project
we\'re doing for Merrill Lynch.

This is a rush project that we were handed last Thursday, and the
actress we had lined up has been called away for a shoot in LA.

Production runs through next week, January 3-7, although shooting time
is subject to change a bit due to an uncertain shooting environment.
We\'re looking for someone who is flexible, easy to work with, and
funny.  The project is an "over-the-top" mini-movie showcasing award
recipients.

The actor/actress cast in this production will be paid a flat fee.  The
role is not a hard one to pull off as long as the character is "zany".

We are willing to cast a non-professional looking to start a career.
Time is short, and I\'m looking to have this part filled by Monday,
January 3rd--earlier if possible.

Anyone interested is this role should contact me directly either by
e-mail or phone (listed below).  Production will take place in Houston.

Terry,

For a military ship I whole heartedly agree with you. However, I can see the
problem in this system for ship UPGRADES. Say a PC party has the money to
install a couple of lasers on their ship, why is it CERTAIN that they will
have the credits, room, appropriate peripheral equipment, etc. to upgrade
their Power Plant (not to mention remebering the fact that it\'s too small to
accomodate everything at once!).

Heck I played this on my old party, CT of course. They had the ship, made
enough to add some fire power and figured they could take on the Universe!
First time a pirate came along they decided to "burn \'em from the skies!".
Loaded the appropriate gunnery software, manned the turrets got ready to
fire! Then I asked them what systems they were going to shut down! I also
suggested that the drives were the single system that could be shut down
that would give them all of the power they needed. Of course there was a
time penalty to restart the drives, made longer for each round they fired.

I used some of the old FASA Star Trek rules for engineering and had them
sweating for a while, until their engineer managed to shut down enough
secondary system (including life support) and pulled a bit more than the
rated power out of the PP to let them get a couple of shots off AND keep the
drives running! As it worked out they had AMAZINGLY good rolls (wink, wink)
and crippled the raider. It was a long time before they got over the
humbling experience, they also save they cash to increase the PP, then they
found out how much of their cargo hold they would lose...

It was like that with every upgrade, once they caught one, always a
trade-off. With the G:T rules the trade-off is in space alone... if you
include the PP as a percentage of the module. I prefer the modified modules
(from somewhere on the \'Net) with out the PP percentage, and a seperate
number of PP modules sized as needed.

I\'d be interested also.

I\'ve got a program that will strip comments out of GIF files, but it
*destroys* animated GIFs (the output file only has the first image). It
also strip the "garbage" that tends to get tacked onto the end of GIF
files after being sent via things like xmodem.

Seems to work ok here. And unlike Win 3.1, when a Windows app crashed,
I could just close that window and open another one. Not even the
Current* version of Windows can do that (I know, I\'ve had to restart 5
times just today when apps hit things like "illegal opcode")

Most people don\'t know that California Code was actually
based upon the Common Law.  The very first "California
Code", the _California Codes of 1872_ is the largest and
most comprehensive codification of the Common Law ever
done.  It is also still binding law in the state of California.
While finding it in print is somewhat difficult, it is available
on diskette.  If anyone would like a copy contact me

I take it that Glen is an attorney at law.  One of the problems
that he faces is that he was trained in a "modern" law school.
I mean NO disrepect to Glen, it is not his fault that most law
schools no longer cover Common Law properly.  I understand
that many law schools no longer even offer a constitution law
class.

Believe it or not, the very topic of this thread can make for

Seeing as it\'s such a small file (30Kb)  I\'ve emailed an example DOS program
directly to Nick,
If anyone else would like to see it, mail me off list and I\'ll forward it to
you

Actually examining a few GIF\'s I fond most of the ones\'s I\'ve got don\'t have
any identification such as this anyway.

I can outline a scenario for how the experiment could be
carried out with virtually no cost.  Mr. Scholar, curious as to
the possibilities determines to do the experiment.  In his job
he has access to female chimps for other experimentation
(could be anything from psychological to pharmaceutical) and
can determine when one of them is in eusterous (sp.?) and
artificially inseminate her using his own seed.  All he has to
do is make sure that she has no contact with her own kind.

In CT, 1 std = 14 m^3 = 2 1.5 x 1.5 squares.

This is one I\'ve often considered.  The other alternative is that it\'s not
Santanocheev himself that is doing it, but one of his kids, or other
family.

Sigh.  Close, but no splort.

Anyway, IMTU I\'ve hypothesised that Santanocheev has a son, Captain
Roderick "Roddy" Santanocheev.  He\'s a good officer, whose career,
unfortunately has been heavily influenced by politics.  At first, his
father\'s influence worked in his favour, but later his father\'s downfall
damaged his career.  He\'s a little bit ticked off by this, and just might
do something silly if he thought he could get back at Norris.

As an example of the kind of damage that could have occurred to his career,
he could have been assigned to command a Kinunir class ship....

Excel sheets don\'t come across well if they are multiple sheet

p37 T4 - \'Expertise in a skill within a cluster does not give a 
character any ability in other skills under that heading\'.

p21 \'skills and training\' gives some guidance on selection of skills 
but personally, I\'d just pick the skill in the cluster.

Cascade skills give you the other skills in the group at higher skill-1

I\'d contact Marc Miller at FarFuture@aol.com and see if he is giving 
out copies of the T4.1/T5 playtest files still as they clarify a lot 
of points.

It\'s not a total disaster - I tend to use the designs as a source for chairs,

My main deckplan heresy is that I can\'t stand iris valves.

IMO they\'re the wrong shape and too complex. Plus Ive never understood why
by TL15 you can\'t design a sliding door that\'s airtight.

We\'re getting beyond my extremely limited knowledge of taxonomy, but I
would have thought that two species would HAVE to be of the same genus
in order to produce even sterile offspring. Isn\'t that sort of implied
by the taxonomic system? Certainly horses and donkeys belong to the same
genus. Are there any examples of hybrids between different genusses
(genii? ;-)

Um, Sorry, but you missed it. There are two rather portly dudes portaryed
in The Traveller Book. Alexander Lascelles Jaimison is rather stout. And
then there\'s the guy with the beard, who has what looks like a 10mm
AutoSnub. Both humans. Both with noticeable belly bulges. Both Male, and
probably both over 40.

Well, when I was Acting Peregrin, the rule was a divided field of equal (or
geometrically consistant) parts color and metal, for ex Checquies,
gyronies, etc, Per ___, Tierced per ___ were treated as a fur, and thus any
non-component color, tincture, or the opposing metal may be used atop
provided the charge crosses the borders. Mind you, that was AS24-25 era...
Otherwise, No color on color, no metal on metal, no color on a fur or vair
of which said color is a component, no metal on a fur or vair of which said
metal is a component. Tinctures (Purpure, Sanguine, Sky and Tenne) treated
as colors.

Since the field was chequy of 9 Gu and Ar, a non Gu, non ar item could be
placed  on it. Key point: A non-specified charge is assumed to be 1/3 of
the height and width, so in that blazon, according to what I was taught by
Mistress Flanna of Dunwalton and Her Excellency Ariana Silkenfire, chequy
of 9 WOULD need the "Overall" to guarantee the crossing of the boundaries
of the center Gu square of the chequy.

In service to the dream, I remain,

Ob Gaming in General: If you don\'t already know heraldrese (that wierd
hybrid of Norman French, Pre-norman English, and modern anglish used by the
Brittish Heralds and the SCA heralds), it can get very strange.... just
draw it out, and make certain it follows the basic rules... the Heradrese
can be overwhelming. My Pendragon players hate me, since I make them
attempt a blazon in heraldrese from the trick (the miniature drawing)...
then I correct the heraldrese, and have a DIFFERENT player trick it (draw
it) from the blazon. Then again, I also keep a Roll of Arms for my PD
games... Then again, they beg me to run more.

More ob Trav: If imperial heraldry exists, verbal distinction between Poni
and Pony would probably be made in Imperial Heraldrese... And for those
using language rules, Heraldrese should probably be a separate (In GT, M/A,
M/E if you know the base language) language, but defaulting to the higher
of (Root Language 2+ serves as Heraldrese 1) or (Heraldry -1). It took me
almost a year to learn to blazon, and I always have had to have the
dictionary  of heraldry handy.

Ob Trav: I don\'t bother with computer issues much IMTU, as I assume the
Imperial Virtual Machine, which is required for all starship computers to
use. Since it is standardized, and hardware emulated, it doesn\'t slow
things down TOO much. And it guarantees that you can buy SW on any planet
of sufficient TL. Getting it into the right media to be loaded, however,
may be tricky!

Light Therapy in a nutshell:
Get a 2\' two or 4 tube flourescent fixture, preferably UL approved.
Put the full complement of Full Spectrum Tubes into siad fixture.
Sit in front of it for 10 mins morning and afternoon with it turned on.

Light therapy is not FDA regulated, and the specialty boxes for it are just
such fixtures in an attractive case. I live in an area wher darness
prevails for up to 19 hours per day... SAD/Winter Blues are VERY common
here. Light therapy helps many people with the winter blues... but not all.

Ob Trav: Any human minor race adapted to other than about G1 to G4 is
probably going to need different lighting conditions to avoid the blues...
Someone from a  dim red is going to be adapted for that light, while
someone from a hot blue star will probably need at least 30 minutes a day
in BRIGHT lighting.

Hmmm, I just heard about this first a week or so ago.  Apparently it\'s
still being worked on, and will run some stuff.  Just wish I could remember
now where it\'s at...

MAE -- I think that\'s Mac Applications Environment, ran on Sun and a couple
others I believe.  I\'ve actually got a demo around here somewhere still I
think, but have never tried it.

A/UX was cool!  It was my first intro to my two favorite OS\'s.

BUT, Rhapsody isn\'t Vaporware, you can buy it\'s fruits today in the form of
"Mac OS X Server", and in a few months in the form of "Mac OS X".  Very,
very cool, BUT at this time is missing one very important piece.  It
doesn\'t have X-Windows, I really hope this is solved by the time the
consumer version ships!

Ah, the old, \'OK, I\'ve got it on 14" disk pack and can put it on 8" floppy,
but I need it on 1/2" tape or 5.25" floppy\' problem :^)  Networks tend to
solve that problem.

Thanks. I took a look at this design and it doesn\'t match the MT

Chimpanzees are _hard_ to get for medical purposes, and they\'re
_expensive_.  And they\'re monitored like crazy.  Once Mr. Scholar\'s female
chimp is pregnant, she\'d almost certainly be withdrawn from whatever study
she\'s actually supposed to be in.  Thus Mr. Scholar, MD-PhD, is going to
hurt another one of his projects, or one of his peers... who will
certainly be eager to find out who\'s been screwing with his work.

A/UX was Apple\'s UNIX implementation (or rather, impersonation), which was a
native UNIX which could also call the stuff in the Apple ROMs. It got dropped
in the early 90\'s in favour of AIX, which was in turn dropped shortly before
Jobs came back on board.

There was a product called (I think) Executor which ran on, among other things,
Linux. It required you to have an Apple ROM on hand though. I\'ve no idea what
became of it.

There was a software only emulator for Sun, HP and AIX called Macintosh
Application Services (MAS), around the time AIX 3.2 came out. But Apple started
playing silly games with the licensing (I think it was really a tease while
they were talking to various parties about being bought) that it was never
released, on AIX at least.

But there was an advert at the time showing an RS/6000 running Hypercard under
MAS alongside a bunch of Smartsuite stuff under WABI (emulating Win3.1), and
some GL and some other stuff. I set up the systems for the photoshoot and I can
tell you that it did actually work.

Alternatively, "Rod Santanocheev" could be a good, loyal officer who
would never think of "getting back" at Norris -- but his father\'s
political enemies don\'t necessarily think so, damaging his career.
Worse yet, now that the Sector Admiral has retired, he\'s taken a more
active role in the Moot.  Many officers automatically assume that Rod
has the same political opinions as his father, who has the knack of
coming up with frothing anti-Norris diatribes in the sector Moot at
the least opportune moments....

The players might be Roddy or part of his crew, or they could get caught
up in political shenanigans involving the Captain.  (Possibilities: he\'s
been targeted by one of his father\'s political enemies (INI?); he\'s a
convenient "fall guy" for an unrelated plot; one of his supporters wants
the players help to clear his reputation; etc.)

Not a bad way to make the players sweat.
My preference would be to go with a more reality based scenario. For example
if the upgrade was done at a reputable shipyard then a Naval Architect would
have had to do the designs (Cha-Ching). He would most certainly notify the
customer that the ship would be under powered, and require a bigger power
plant (Cha-Ching), resulting in loss of cargo space. Should the players
decide to go ahead with the design without the upgrade then there\'s no way
that the TAS and shipyard inspectors would pass the ships as safe for use in
Imperial space. Of course they might be amiable to convincing (Cha-Ching).
And of course, unauthorized and illegal modifications to a vessel still
under mortgage could cause the bank to determine that the loan was in
default and cause a skip agent or two to visit to reclaim the vessel. Then
play out the attack. The fact that they\'d been warned won\'t make them feel
any better, especially if the Architect is sufficiently vague about what
"underpowered" means.

LOL.

But he\'s right.  I am the one who fills out all the CAR (Committee on Animal
Research) paperwork for several PI\'s.  The monitoring requirements for mice
and rats are pretty staggering.  Chimps are HELLA expensive and are very
tightly monitored.  Scientists working with animals also have lab assistants
and other people who handle the animals.  After all, they really don\'t have
time to shovel shit and they\'re not veterinarians.

Certainly true. However the concept isn\'t bad. Children on shipboard will
definitely need to know survival skills not necessary for their planet bond
brethren.  What do they do on a loss of gravity? A loss of power? And what
do they do in the case of a vacuum leak? They better know. A child as young
as five better know how to climb into a Rescue Ball. A ten year old should
know how to use a vac suit (if they regularly live on a ship or on a world
without a breathable atmosphere.)  They should know how to operate an
airlock and when it\'s safe to go outside on a strange planet and when the
indicating lights on the airlock say it\'s not safe. They should know how to
operate the ship\'s communication system and the computer (which should have
guards to prevent them from doing anything that will endanger the ship.)
They should know where and the ship they aren\'t allowed to go (most likely
the engineering sections and possibly the bridge/control room.)  Really
young children will probably require constant attention (which they need
anyway) and be limited to a few rooms that have been "child safed". Older
children will probably have chores necessary to ship operation (very much
like farm children), especially on a working trader.

Well, I hadn\'t thought of this (which has now been snipped into my nasty GM
file!), but my way worked out OK in any rate. I tend to run "edge of
Imperium or beyond" games. I like the freedom of being able to ignore canon
historical events. Technology stays canon (with the occational intruder or
artifact thrown in), but I can always ignore canon history since the
information lag may have caused it to be only a small articals in local
papers. At the time the PCs were at one of the few starports in their area
of operation (and nearly as shady as an oak tree). Since tha law was a
thinly spread as everything else, the use of weapons by civilian ships was
more the rule than the exception, and documentation wasn\'t the imperative on
the frontier that it is in the Interior.

You\'re right that I\'m an attorney and went to a modern
law school.  I\'m not sure what you mean by "cover[ing]
Common Law properly."  Law schools teach the common
law and legal history to people who are going to be
practicing in the present day.  More academic legal
education can be obtained through graduate school
programs leading to LL.M. or LL.D. degrees, or a Ph.D.
in legal history.

I\'m sure that every law school offers constitutional
law, if only because that is a subject tested on the
bar exam, both the multi-state portion and every
individual state\'s portion.

Logic will encounter some difficulty, I suppose, when

I like this son of Santanocheev thread.  Here\'s how I
might handle it:

Imperial Navy Headquarters
Regina/Regina
037-1108
0745 hrs

"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming.  First
picture, please.  This is Captain Roderick
Santanocheev, Imperial Navy, commanding the INS
Stalking Cheetah, attached to 608 Squadron of the
193rd Fleet.  Yes, he is the oldest son of Admiral
Santanocheev.

"When the fleet ordered him to stand down upon
execution of the armistice agreement between the
Imperium and Outworld Coalition, Captain Santanocheev
refused, stating that the armistice was a sell-out of
the citizens of the Marches.  Next picture.  He jumped
with his ship and another cruiser of his squadron, the
Flying Jaguar.  This picture is the Cheetah.  

"Next picture.  Here is his last message to the fleet,
stating that he was taking the war back to the
Zhodanis, and concluding \'I shall return.\'

"The Zhodanis have advised us that their forces in the
Demilitarized Zone have recently been attacked by two
Imperial Navy cruisers that refused to acknowledge
transmission of the armistice agreement.  Zhodani
sensor records -- next picture please -- have allowed
us to identify these ships as the Cheetah and Jaguar.

"The Zhodanis have stated that they will resume a
state of war if these ships are not stopped.  We
believe that the Zhodanis intend to try to capture
Captain Santanocheev and use statements that he will
make as a justification for resumption of hostilities.

"Your mission is to get to Captain Santanocheev first
and terminate his command.  With extreme prejudice,
you understand?  We don\'t have the resources or,
frankly, the political will, to send a fleet after
him, and the Zhodanis may well believe that a fleet
incursion is actually an act of aggression against
them.  So your Emperor is relying on you to keep the
peace.  Good luck."

I haven\'t found any, but I\'ll take a stab at what his Soc
might be. Santanochev is regular IN; so he either enlists
and goes through OCS or he goes through the Naval
Academy. The enlist/OCS route implies to me that allot
of work ethic would be involved; not something that I
would think Santanocheev would be into. OTOH, getting
a commission through the Naval Academy looks good on
the resume. A pc needs SOC 8 to even try to get into
the Academy. His promotions from \'Rear Admiral\' to Sector
Admiral over two years would indicate to me at least 2
tours as a Naval Attach (+1 SOC, and promotion). Assuming
no other additions to SOC, the absolute minimum SOC for
Santanocheev would be 10.

Of course its hard to get into the Academy on SOC 8. In
addition, Santanocheev is going out of his way to move up
in the 3I, so figure at least an extra +1 SOC from moving
with his \'political and social connections\'. That\'s SOC A to
start, with +2 SOC (N Attach) and +1 SOC from
Command Duty(probably from a Shore Duty tour).
My guestimate: SOC D

An explanation for why the Oberlindes ship Bloodwell got destroyed?
Tukera\'s annoyance with Oberlindes causes them to complain to
Santanocheev to due something. Santanocheev goes overboard...
BOOM no more Bloodwell.

1107 (maybe even earlier than that) we have lots of political
and economic unrest  in the Regina subsector. Adv1 implies that
allot of this unrest comes from 3I nobles and bureaucracy.
Naturally, there were a few other problems (Efate\'s civil war,
Ine Givar, Zhodani influence, etc etc) but I\'m trying to
understand what the role of 3I nobles/bureaucracy had in
causing problems in the Regina area. My impression was
that Santanocheev and allies were causing most of the
problems. If Santanocheev had less of a role in those events,
then who was causing the problems? Was Norris facing
opposition from nobles and bureaucrats in his own subsector?

From the SOC discussion above, it seems probable that
Santanocheev served a couple times as a Naval Attach.
This led me to a wild thought:  what if Santanocheev had
served as an Attache at the 3I embassy on Chronor? The
Zho\'s co-opt, turn, or otherwise gain control over the man
to use as an agent. If the Imperial Ambassador managed to
catch wind of the plot, the Zhodani would, of course, have
to silence her. Hmm...did\'nt a ambassador get killed there?

Another thought:  how about Santanocheev\'s home world
being Porozlo? It would fit the slavic name. Also, being
from their might cause Santanocheev to think that the Zhos
would never be able to fight their way into the Rhylanor
triad because "our forces are so much more powerful than
they were during the 3FW". This attitude is actually echoed
by others in various TNS bulletins concerning the ability of
SW forces reaching Rhylanor. "So let the Zho\'s run to my
home world. They\'ll be cut to pieces by our new ships and
I\'ll break the sieges at Efate and Jewel."--Santanocheev

Finally, there is the inevitable Lucan/Santanocheev concept.
I didn\'t want to do this; it seemed a little to tidy and cheesy.
But I suppose one could connect the two. And for GT:Trav
people, Lucan and Santanocheev\'s son might create some
mischief. Not my IMTU; YMMV.

The mental image that leaps to mind is Ditzie aiming one of FS\' obscenities
at a pile of cowering chestnuts.

Ditzie, of course, would be wearing a Santa hat.

Jesse, Kiri and I have been thinking about doing t-shirts for the bayCon

Tying this thread to "the US is really big" thread...it\'s tough for us to
all get together.  Those that are west have a problem getting east and
vise versa.  Heck those of us southeast have a problem getting to the
upper midwest.

What we might want to do is pick out several regional cons for us
Traveller types to concentrate on?  As a suggestion BayCon on the west
coast, GenCon in the midwest, maybe DragonCon in the south and another ??
in the northeast.  That way we could be sure of having two or three good
Traveller games at a con we might be able to attend.

What do you think?

Eris,
    who has never been to a con, but might give it a try if he
    *knew* he\'d get a good game of Traveller out of it.

Suicide is painless (theme from M*A*S*H)

through early morning fog i see
visions of the things to be
the pains that are withheld for me
i realize and i can see

Chorus:that suicide is painless
it brings on many changes
and i can take or leave it if i please

the game of life is hard to play
i\'m gonna lose it anyway
the losing card i\'ll someday lay
so this is all i have to say
CHORUS
the sword of time will pierce our skin
it doesn\'t hurt when it begins
but as it works its way on in
the pain grows stronger watch it grin(?)
CHORUS
a brave man once requested me
to answer questions that are key
"is it to be or not to be"
and i replied, "oh why ask me?"

suicide is painless
it brings on many changes
and i can take or leave it if i please
and you can do the same thing if you please...

What "media"? You have a portable "storage box" that transfers data via
any of several standard Imperial data interfaces (SCSI, 10-base-100,
etc). You connect it up to the system at the point of sale, they
transfer your software to your box. They you return to your
business/ship and connect the box to the system and upload the
software. 

Actually, I\'d bet that the software is available on the local net. The
"dongle" that lets it know you are an authorized user is what you get
when you fork over the cash. Unlike now, there will be a dedicated set
of ports for the "dongles". You just stick it into an empty slot.

I expect that "cradles" and even "pappoose carriers" will double as
rescue balls. In fact, they\'ll probably be *sturdier* than rescue
balls. Hard shelled with a "cover that snaps down against a gasket at
the first pressure drop. A 15 minute oxy tank for an adult is about the
size of a baby. And isn\'t all *that* heavy. It should last a real baby
an hour or more (much more if the unit incorporates elementary
"re-breather" filtration).

Kids large enough to run around with minimal supervision (say bright
3-year olds on up) will probably be trained to *always* have with them
a small pack/satchel that contains a children\'s rescue ball. Smaller,
and again probably somewhat tougher (partly to withstand handling by
kids!).

Actually, going by *farm* life, kids as young as 8 will be operating
the simpler equipment. They may have "chores" that involve doing the
simpler tasks in the control room or enegineering. And they\'ll know
*quite* well what they are and aren\'t allowed to touch. 

They\'ll be *training* on stuff they aren\'t allowed to do on their own
yet. Many\'s the ship where in an accident, one of the kids used this
training to take care of something when there wasn\'t *time* (or
opportunity) for an adult to deal with it in time. 

A kid may not be certified to run the powerplant yet, but the *first*
thing he was taught was how to recognize the warning signals, and the
right way to do a shutdown for various problems. 

So if there are a couple of "junior cadets" in engineering, cleaning
and checking "safe" secondary systems, and something goes wrong and
takes out the engineer on duty, you can bet that one of them is
notifying control and tending to the injured man while the other is
trying to shut down whatever system has gone nuts.

Which, on shipboard, includes special filters on the air returns.
*Especially* if zero g is present any amount of the time. The last
thing you want to get into the air system are pieces of toys, "spit-up"
and worse. :-)

> (very much like farm children), especially on a working trader.

Yep. See above. 

Oh yeah, a duty that kids almost *always* draw... "dusting" the air
ducts. The ducts aren\'t all *that* long or complex on any reasonable
sized ship. But they *are* small enough that you have a choice between
an expensive robot, giving an adult galloping claustrophobia, and using
the kids. 

In port, kids barely old enough to read well may be helping the cargo
master check containers of cargo in and out. Sure, the automatics log
the stuff, but a manual backup (the cargo master and the "supercargo"
:-) never hurts.

Doug, this does not seem to follow the way Traveller was going.
As you\'ll see below, it is only supported by CT (but higher education
did not appear until Book 5 and Marines are in Book 4) and T4 (this
might be an error. ;-)

=====

In CT, Marines are in Book 4, which does not appear to have higher
education.

In MT, future Marines can go through OTC or Naval Academy (but not NOTC
or Military Academy)

In TNE, it is only the Naval Academy (Universities don\'t run OTC/NOTC)
bu this is the only system that specifically mentions running Marines
through flight School.

In T4, there is no option for Marines - the Army and avy options are
quite specific.

In T4.1 (draft) Naval Academy and NOTC graduates can choose Marines
instead of Navy.

Note:
OTC (Officer Training Corps) and NOTC (Naval Officer Training Corps)
are taken whilst at university.

Unless that MCr 4088 is before the .8 instead of after,
I get the ship making a loss at 80%

Yes, certainly in plants -- triticale (genus X Triticosecale) is a cross
of wheat and rye (genera Triticum and Secale).  I\'ve heard of examples
of rare but naturally-occuring "intergeneric hybrids" in some fish and
cetaceans.  Taxonomic classification is fuzzier around the edges than
one might hope....

Incidentally, all species in genus Canis interbreed; dogs and gray wolves
produce fertile offspring, and dog and coyote hybrids are frequently    
themselves fertile as well.

Keep in mind too that on most mid to high tech level worlds, there are
bound to be numerous, safe ways to prevent obesity. Very, very few people
would actually CHOOSE to be obese, or even chubby.  Maybe a beer belly

That REALLY sucks. Colt no longer deals to the public, only to military and
law enforcement. Their guidelines for such deals is horrendous according to
my gun dealer.
Which effectively means, H&K probably won\'t deal with the public.
Colt becomes and even bigger military arms dealer and one more good brand of
weapon is no longer out there four us gun nuts :(

My gun dealer is also a law enforcement officer and apparently Colt has
already passed the word about no more civilian sales.  He says that you need
letterhead stationary (not that hard to get) for a Order and there is some
sort of paperwork/follow-up involved about carrying the gun for a year
afterward.
Which means if you are a dealer and want to buy it, you gotta wear it which
drives the value of said commodity down if you want to later resale it.
Not sure how they plan to enforce it, but that is what colt has told
dealers.

Looks like its time to save and get that Glock :)

Actually, I would look at the downpayment as the original investment,
since the calculations assume that your major expense is paying off the
ship.  If you assume that the purchaser (a megacorp, or at least a
sector-wide shipping firm) pays cash for the ship, you get an annual
return of MCr 239 or so (again, assuming 80% capacity loads).  That
works out to 5.8% annual return.

The MCr 4088 includes the .8 cost multiplier for a standard (IMTU) ship.

I found the discrepancy:  fuel costs.  Since this ship has fuel refining
capability, the fuel cost should be about MCr 10.

Note also that I found and fixed a discrepancy in the G-comp formula
used in the Akins 3.2 spreadsheet.  (I notified Andrew Akins of this
discrepancy a while back, and he approved my fix.)

If you like, I can forward the Excel 5.0 spreadsheet to any of you,
zipped.

Forwards? I tend to agree. But *backwards* is a whole different story.
Being digigrade[1], rather than plantigrade[2], Vargr are likely to be
able to kick well *behind* themselves, and also do *nasty* "belly
rakes" to someone they\'ve grappled with.

[1] walking with only the toes and "toe pad" on the ground, and what
    would be the rest of the foot on a human bein a long set of bones
    leading up to a hock(?) which is the joint that\'s the heel & ankle
    on humans.

[2] Walking with those bones on the ground, and the hock(?) being an
    ankle.

Note. If you ever try to "walk digigrade" keep in mind that it is *not*
done like a human on tip-toe. Instead, both the ankle *and* the knee
are kept bent. This keeps the center of gravity over the ground contact
points, but results in a *very* different gait. Sort of a "glide". Even
without make-up, you look quite non-human.

It\'s a strain for humans to walk this way for long. I can\'t even do it
since I gained some weight. My ankles aren\'t up to it, and my knees
aren\'t real happy either.

Anyway, if you try, you\'ll probably *know* when you get it right
because all of a sudden it\'s *easier* to move than in any other posture
except our "normal" one.

See John Sayles\' movie The Brother From Another Planet.  Two human

That would be me. Honorary kills and near splorts shouldn\'t count
unless you create a separate category for them, because otherwise
you have to decide "what would have happened if...", and have
people wind up claiming a keyboard for every chuckle or groan.

   1) Geor went to the Merchant Academy, which was a hideous
mistake on someone\'s part. After wasting the best part of two
decades trying to turn a sow\'s ear into a silk purse, or rather
this foul-tempered, uscrupulous bully into a competent merchant
officer, his company finally dumped him. I have him working as a
bouncer for right now, but looking for other jobs like loan
sharking or bounty hunting.
   1a) If he starts into organized crime on his own, the mob will 
either recruit him or squash him flat before the police do. Does
organized crime have "standards" or "rules" for who works for
them? On a world with a high law level, what would those be, and
what kind of arrangements would let the mob exist?
   1b) Who is most likely to hire a bounty hunter, and why? What
kind of pay and expenses do they offer, and on what terms and
conditions?

     2) Marbet was developing a fine career as a character
actress when she encountered a run of bad luck and stopped
getting parts. She had been already been feeling limited, with
under-used abilities, when her long-time agent died. Earlier she
had fallen in love with the wrong man, divorced him when she
could no longer deny he was a crook, and now he\'s making threats.
She\'s looking for a new start offworld.
     2a) She has picked up enough skill and business sense that
she can arrange small parts on her own, but she can do better
with an agent. What possibilities between unemployed and megastar
are there, how much would they pay, and for how long?

     3) Sir Anton is a research specialist at a major university.
He is an extremely reclusive but brilliant and highly educated
genius in history and the social sciences, and an excellent
writer of elmentary textbooks and popular histories.  Although
his income is substantial, it is matched by his philanthropy. His
personal lifestyle and current uncommitted wealth at a given time
is no better than average middle class. 
     3a) Actually, Sir Anton doesn\'t have any questions for the
list, because if he doesn\'t already know the answers, he can
figure them out or find them out without ever having to talk to
anybody...But if he weren\'t quite so reclusive and held on to his
cash a bit longer, he\'d make somebody a fine patron.

Knowing Ditzie, the "open fire" was made by lighting a few bags of
gunpowder or the like that were past usage date (they really do
dispose of old powder by burning it). 

Picture her tossing on a new bag/box every so often, as well as "scrap"
explosives (ie trimmings of TNT, C4, etc). And maybe the occasional
magnesium or titanium scrap (pieces from designs that didn\'t work out).

Of course, this fire will have flames shooting up a few hundred
feet.... you roast things by extending them past the blast shield a
could of hundred meters from the *edge* of the
inferno^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hfire. Said fire being "only" 50 or so meters
across. 

I base this vision of hell on the results of having the "Senior Patrol"
in one Scout troop I was in being delegated to "watch the camp" during
a camporee (inter troop competition). 

They decided to build a bigger fire. When we got back for lunch, they
had dragged half a dozen downed *trees* together into a rough "teepee"
shape and ignited them. One scout cooked a TV dinner one the ground 10
feet from the fire!

So I just asked myself what those guys would have done given the
resources available to Ditzie. :-)

Naaaahhh. Ditzie does it _right_:


Take one 25 lb bag charcoal.

Soak with a couple liters LOX.

Drop match on it from a _distance_.

The charcoal will be gone in seconds...but what _glorious_ seconds they
are!

(NB: There was an engineering prof somewhere who\'s done this a number of
times. He\'s made Dave Barry\'s column, and was the killer of the INternet
once upon a time as everyone dl\'ed his mpeg of the events...I forget
where it is; it\'s probably still posted somewhere.)

Just back from a well deserved rest and catching up on the traffic.
Here are some of my takes on the tramp traders and truckers subject

There is no such thing as a "tramp trucker."  Being the son of
a trucker, there are:  long haul, short haul, double bottomed, 
triple bottomed, straight jobs and gypsies.  All of these are called
rigs in some form or fashion.  Also note that this is US trucker slang.
I don\'t know what a Canadian trucker or an Australian would call these.

long haul:  cross country,  extra fuel tanks slung under the rig with
    living arrangements attached

short haul:  limited to local or city routes, definitely not interstate

double bottomed:  dragging two trailers

triple bottomed:  dragging three trailers

straight job:  standard truck or lorry

gypsies:  truckers that "live" out of their rig and "own" their own rig

mixed rig:  a straight job dragging a trailer

rig:  the truck or lorry that actually drags the trailer

IMTU:  All my free traders that are not subsidized by the government
or other entity are called, yep, you got it, "gypsies."

Have a safe New Year.

367 days left in this millenium.

Jason is exactly right.

Continuous tone images (ie: photographs) should be jpegs. Line art
should be gif. In fact, for something like a deckplan it will just
about always look better in GIF unless you use minimum compression
on your jpeg.

3d rendered images can go both ways depending on how complext they
are (as they get more photo-real, they need jpeging). There are a
few sites online that will also optimize your gifs for you to minimize
file size--they are really cool:

that\'s the only one I have offhand... try it, it\'s cool!

computer games?  Either of them will produce legal characters for
use in the games.  I think they are basic MT (not the advanced), but
when I\'m in a hurry, I fire up MTII create a few characters and
print them out.

There\'s underpowered and then there\'s *really* underpowered.  <g> I
rate power requirements at three levels when I design ships.  First,
there\'s the power requirement with *every* system at full power,
ships sometimes carry a reactor this powerful.  Second, is the power
requirement will all systems that would be running similtaniously
(don\'t need power maneuver in jump space or jump drive/grid in
normal space, CG/AG doesn\'t have to run at full power at all times,
etc.), every ship should *exceed* this number.  Third, is minimum
power to keep the ship\'s life support and Jump Grid running for when
emergencies strike, many ships carry a secondary energy source rated
at, at least, this level.

When damage or malfunction reduces the power from the engines things
can get dicey for the PC\'s.  I, too, have had situations where the
PC\'s had to juggle power among various systems. <g>

Players would bring characters in any version they preferred (subject only
to approval by the other players), I would describe tasks in the BITS task
format (which is essentially the MT task format with translations for every
other Traveller version). Player equipment would be drawn from the version
they chose, I would draw from every version.)

One thing\'s for sure...No incarnation of the Enterprise had that "death
trap" like the Protector did. Unless of course you count the Jeffries Tubes.
Nevertheless, an interestign design for a starship.

One other pun in this movie you may or may not be aware of. I think I either
saw it on a promo poster OR on their web site...but there is a mention of
one other NSEA starship....the "Trojan."

NEVER GIVE UP...NEVER SURRENDER!

During the heat of the space race in the 1960\'s, the U.S.

needed a ball point pen to write in the zero gravity confines 
of its space capsules. 

After considerable research and development, the Astronaut 
Pen was developed at a cost of $1 million. 

The pen worked and also enjoyed some modest success as a 
novelty item back here on Earth. 

The Soviet Union, faced with the same problem of writing in

Someone probably hit the nail on the head when they said the most of the 
artists were men who didn\'t get out much.

Personally, I\'d be interested to see something about the sheer *propaganda
value* of the Astronaut Pen. Unfortunately, there\'s no easy way to measure
the effects of kids across the country opening up issues of Superboy,
Spider-Man and The House of Mystery and seeing the Astronaut Pen proudly
advertised, or the effects of wives across the country ordering it from
Lillian Vernon, Inc. as stocking stuffers for their husbands.

One million dollars for a way to bring an artifact of the space race home to
the people of America? That\'s awfully cheap.

Besides, the Soviet space program\'s cleaning bill was well over a million
dollars. After all, it\'s awfully *messy* to clean out a pencil sharpener in
zero-g! :)

Given the history of the Imperium, there are going to be laws that are
multiple *thousands* of years old, that have never been explicitly
repealed, but aren\'t enforced anymore either. If you are *careful* you
can take advantage of this. But it could backfire.

A couple of real world examples:

Back in Victorian times, a man who was likely going to lose a civil
suit noted that trial by combat was technically still legal. So he sent
proper notification to the court and the other party in the suit. 

He showed up, in armor, at the appointed place and time and
(apparently) so did an officer of the court. Since the other party had
declined the challenge, he won the case!

Parliment eliminated this "loophole" next session. 

More recently (in the last 5-10 years) a student at Oxford noted that
the rules of the College required the College to provide "ale and
cakes" for the "young gentlemen" sitting examinations. So, next exam
time, he requested the "ale and cakes" pointing to the regulation.
After a bit of discussing, it was decided that some burgers and a pint
(or some such) were an acceptable modern equivalent. And they presented
them to him, and he happily muched and sipped his way thru his exams. 

Alas, after completing them, he was presented with notice that he was
being fines 25 pounds for failing to wear his sword to the exams (also
in the old regulations). :-)

The moral is that when invoking old rules, be prepared to have other
old ones invoked against you.

Feel free to chose some current laws that might still be on the books
in 1100 Imp. 

Another thought is that back when planets were first contacted and
brought into the Imperium, some of the (then) low TL worlds may have
had some *very* odd legal systems. Ones that may have become "frozen"
when they joined. 

This leads to things like players having a legal dispute on such a
world and being asked if they intend to fight themselves or hire a
"Gladiator at Law". 

Yep, a world where trial by combat is still the rule, but where it\'s
also been "modernized". 


"You have the right to trail by ordeal. If you decline ordeal, you are
 subject to trial by combat. If you are not fit to fight and cannot
 afford a champion, one will be appointed for you..."

If any of you use that bit in a "miranda Warning", I want to hear
about the player\'s reaction!

Heck, anybody got a copy of the *real* Miranda warning? Let\'s see what
we can do with it!

Check your history books for other methods of of rendering judgement.

Eight????

Wish I\'d lived on that farm.

Try, (Yes, this is my experience only. So?)
5 years when dealing with corn...

I have memories I can\'t place that may well be younger.

Actually, best of all would require special hardware. 

I *really* miss my old Tektronics graphics terminal. *Vector* graphics.
*No* pixels. 1024x1024 "addressing". And it was just one of the crude
4010 equivalent units. Not one of the high end jobs that could rotate
the images in realtime.

Battlestar Galactica used a *ton* of Tek graphics gear. Which made tek
*really* POed when the stuff vanished from the sets at the end of the
series.

So, anyone used Flagg in a Traveller game ?

I always liked the somnambutol rounds

Pa - Pa     ooooooooooooooooo  Mow Mow!

Grimjack, of course, is a classic Shadowrun character.

BTW, I picked up several Flagg #1 and Sable #1 from our local comic shop
sale at about 50c each if anyone wants one, don\'t know why they had so many.

Got a few other as well if anyone\'s missing any.

Really, the question is what level of coercion is sanctioned by law when
interrogating a suspect...

The issue is whether the information is admissable in court, and the Miranda
warning is given to CYA before questioning a suspect.  Giving the warning
helps  prove that the confession/admission wasn\'t coerced from an
individual.  I think the specific warnings vary in wording from one
department to another slighty.

I don\'t have a copy of an actual Miranda Warning handy right now, but here
is some information from "Criminal Procedure for the Criminal Justice
Professional":

- ----
- -Coercive police activity is necessary for an admission or confession to be
found involuntary.
- -Satisfaction of Miranda requirements is a relative consideration in
determining the voluntariness of an admission or confession, but it is not
conclusive.
- -Only voluntary admissions or confessions that are obtained in compliance
with Miranda requirements will be admissable in court.
- ----
This is under US law.

Generally, the Miranda warnings are required when interrogating a subject in
custody.  Admissions to private citizens and some other circumstances
(public safety,undercover agents, a voluntary statement made before the
officer has a chance to give the warning, ect) aren\'t restricted.

Basically, the warning is that you have the right to get a lawyer, you have
the right to keep your mouth shut for your own good until you get a lawyer,
and that anything you say can be used against you in court.  There are some
other parts too, but I can\'t remember them all.

I\'m not sure how the Imperium would apply this concept, I think their goals
are to keep an Intersteller economy running as smoothly as possible, keep
lines of communication open, and provide defense for the subject worlds.  I
have a DGP Traveller Digest with an article on Imperial Law that I can look
at and send more info later.  Offhand, I think that the Imperium would be a
little more liberal in what sorts of confessions (methods used to obtain
them that is) would be admissable in court.

As far as the individual worlds who knows???

I am not a lawyer, so if any of this is inaccurate, I apologize.

Occassionally, when the locals suspect a translator may be needed, they add
"You have the right to have a translator present during questioning."

I wonder. Considering how long the Traveller societies have been in
space, this kind of caution may be considered akin to an American
suburbanite of the 1990\'s refusing to leave his home without survival
rations, a firearm and a first aid kit. Reasonable behaviour for a person
on a frontier, and some people do this, but the average person doesn\'t.

Aboard ships of a mature space-faring society, how common are life 
support failures? Hull breaches? For a surface to surface vessel 
(like a type-A Free Trader) that makes bi-weekly landings, spacewalks
may even be something that happen every couple of years or so, unless 
something very unusual happens.

This, of course, assumes that the ships in question are doing nice,
safe, ordinary things, which of course eliminates all those military ships,
scout ships, and ships with a player character anywhere near them.

Designer\'s notes:

I freely admit that this is a hideous example of conspicuous
consumption.  After all, even AuricTech Shipyard\'s ELECTRA II-class
yacht is only 1000 dtons, and costs merely MCr 1,166.19.  I mainly
designed this ship (as I\'m sure is quite obvious) as a play on the "Y2K"
term.  Few individual sophonts would ever spend the 2.5+ gigacredits to
purchase such a craft; OTOH, this yacht may be considered suitable for
heads of state and/or CEOs of Imperial megacorporations.  Some fleets
may wish to purchase the JUBILEE-class as C3 ships, or VIP transports,
hence the fiber-optic computers (with flight-computer backups) and
overall redundancy of power plant, commo gear, and sensors.

I kept the ship at TL-12, so that M:0 campaigns could use it. ("As
_if_!")  I figure that, with the exception of laser systems, few
potential owners would need the ship upgraded to a higher TL.  Potential
owners who prefer a higher-tech version of this ship may contact
AuricTech Shipyards at wombat@premier.net .

With four laser turrets mounted as two batteries, and four sandcaster
batteries, the JUBILEE-class yacht is reasonably well protected. 
Stealth and drive-masking (both thermal and neutrino) help keep the
JUBILEE-class yacht from prying enemy eyes.

Note that there are 64 Large staterooms, and 20 Small staterooms, for
only 70 sophonts normally carried.  While the customer can, of course,
order the ships with any custom combination of staterooms that will fit
in this space, the default configuration is as follows:

35 Large staterooms for crewbeings (each crewmember gets a Large
stateroom; the captain gets a two-stateroom suite [includes office
space]).  After all, the crewmembers quite possibly _live_ aboard this
ship, for six months or more at a time.

29 Large staterooms for the yacht\'s owner, and any guests, divided into
suites as follows:

Owner\'s suite (4 Large staterooms);
10 Guest suites (2 Large staterooms each);
5 Regular staterooms (1 Large stateroom each, for lesser guests).

20 Small staterooms for lackeys.

Most ship\'s facilities (emergency low berths, galleys, etc.) are
designed around each stateroom having single occupancy (assuming that
each stateroom in a suite has an occupant).  In other words, although
the ship\'s listed expected occupancy is 70 sophonts, the JUBILEE-class
yacht has sufficient food, emergency low berths, and other facilities to
support 84 human-sized beings without any hint of overcrowding.  Food
carried is sufficient to support 84 humans for up to 22 weeks, without
resort to emergency rations.

This yacht is definitely high-performance for TL-12 (J-3, 3 Gs
acceleration, 3 Gs compensated).

Collected in the Spinward Marches, 1090:

 "On Regina, there was this merchant, and he was really down on his luck.
His Beowulf had been reeped by the bank for non-payment and he had a couple
of crates of tripchins he needed to move off-world and he needed to do it
fast. So, he reads the newsfeed and up pops this for-sale ad for a puking
dog and the selling price is only 1 credit. He can\'t believe his eyes, and
he thinks it\'s got to be a typo. Still, he figures he\'s got nothing to lose,
and the address in the ad is within walking distance inside the starport. He
walks over there real quickly and ends up at the front door of what looks
like a small cartel. He almost turns \'round \'cause he can\'t think of any
reason this cartel would want to pawn off a puking dog for just one credit.
He rings the bell and this nice older woman answers. He says that he wants
to take a look at the ship, and she obliges him. The ship was in perfect
condition! As he\'s checking out the cargo hold the lady says to him, "You\'re
the only person who\'s come along since I put the ad in yesterday, I\'m
surprised." So he says to her, "Well, maybe nobody would believe the
misprint in the newsfeed." She just smiles at him at says, "Oh, it\'s no
misprint, I\'m really selling it for just a credit." The merchant can\'t
believe his own ears, he just about falls over. Finally, he asks what the
catch is, but she tells him there\'s no catch, so he asks why she\'s selling
it so cheap.

 "As it turns out, just before she put up the ad, she got an Xmail from her
husband, the guy who ran the cartel. It turns off he\'d run off with some
cute chippie and he wanted his wife to fire the crew of the puking dog, sell
it, and send him the money. So not only does this trader get this ship for
less than a soda, he also gets a line on a full jobless crew. This guy was a
friend of my wife\'s friend, and from what I understand his luck really
changed after that!"


Collected in Daibei, 1101:

 "Ugkfoung Akuedharrgh, that Vargr who plays Lucky in all of those Jetland
movies, was visiting Capital, and staying in this apartment his producer
owned in this real posh arco. Everyone knows that Ugk doesn\'t go anywhere
without the pet palgo that his friend Girur Duliirumar gave him. So, he\'s on
the elevator in this arco and these two old Impie ladies get on, they\'re
like 200 years old and both of them can probably trace their ancestry way
back to the Sirka and the Ramshackle Empire. So they see Ugkfoung, on the
elevator, and all Vargr look alike to them, and even if that wasn\'t the case
they wouldn\'t know who he was since they\'re like 200 years old and they\'re
on hoity-toity Capital and they\'ve probably never even *heard* of Tom
Jetland. So, they\'re real nervous and scared \'cause they\'re on the elevator
with this furry Vargr, and they\'ve never seen one before. Palgos can smell
fear, and they get all excited when they do, but these ladies don\'t even
realize that this palgo is moving toward them, they\'re so afraid of Ugk, but
he notices his palgo\'s getting all excited, and he orders it to sit. The
palgo sits, and so do the two old ladies. They thought this freaky Vargr was
ordering *them* to sit. Ha! I don\'t know what they were thinking!"

Speaking of palgos, here\'s another one, which was collected in the Spinward
Marches in 1098:

 "A belter I used to drink with told me this story, and it apparently
happened to his friend who was a steward or something with the crew that
this happened to. There was this free trader and they had a passenger who
had this palgo and she really wanted to keep this palgo in her stateroom
with her. The captain had his own set of regulations and rules, and he
didn\'t let her. I think it had something to do with insurance. The palgo was
to be kept in its cage in the cargo hold. Some cargo handler puts the palgo
in the hold, but there\'s a screw up with the cargo manifest and they vac the
hold for some reason.

 "So, a few weeks later, they get to the planet this passenger was going to,
and she keeps asking about her palgo. The captain realizes that they sucked
all the air out of the hold and the palgo can\'t possibly be alive, so he
tells her they\'ll deliver the critter to her place just as soon as they
unload it. She gets really mad, and she wants the palgo right away, but the
steward calms her down and she goes home. So, they\'re unloading the cargo,
and, sure enough, the palgo is dead. The captain sends his crew out to find
a palgo that looks the same and, as if by a miracle, they find one. They
cremate the dead palgo at the starport\'s fusion crematorium, and they put
the live palgo in the cage. The captain, feeling very badly, goes to deliver
it by hand.

 "So, he gets there and he hands the lady the cage, and her face goes red.
She gets really angry and she starts shrieking, " You thief, you liar! What
kind of business do you run!" The captain is really confused, the two palgos
looked *exactly* alike, he indignantly insists that it\'s her palgo. She gets
even madder and she screeches at him, "What do you take me for, a fool? I
know that even jumpspace cannot bring a dead palgo to life!"

 "It turns out that the palgo was her husband\'s, and the beast outlived him.
Her husband was very rich and left strict instructions in his will to bury
the critter at his feet when it finally died. She hated the little monster,
and she had to cut her vacation short to bring it all the way back home."

Porozlo is good.  I had considered Vilis, but it is a bit exposed to
attack.  I don\'t read Santanocheev as a traitor, BTW, just as an
incompetent and empire-builder.  He might go over the edge after his
downfall though, in an attempt to shaft his enemies.

We could assume that he was from Porozlo, and acquires estates on Vilis. 
This would give us an opportunity to bring him into the Tanoose/Garda-Vilis
question, where he could become a prominent hard-liner, demanding Imperial
intervention and the crushing of the Tanoose Freedom League.  This would be
a suitable way to use an ultra-conservative, "well-connected" Colonel Blimp
type - one of the possible ways to read this guy, particularly if we use
the reading of "Norris the liberal" that appears in MT Rebellion
sourcebook, and TNE Regency sourcebook, where Norris is the initiator of
the Representational Reforms.

Yes, it\'s cheesy, and yes, it\'s pretty obvious, and thus "inevitable".  It
is actually pretty likely that socially well-connected young riff-raff
would flock together, and toadying would become an artform.  See the
"Flashman" books by George Macdonald Fraser for more details!

The other GT option would be people toadying Varian.  We don\'t know much
about him, so he could well be as pointless a sleazebag as Lucan.

En Garde is, of course, a useful guide to Imperial high society IMTU.

Santanocheev propably does not have a seat in the Moot. He might, but I
doubt it. He was jumped from a rather junior rear admiral to sector admiral
so fast that the Admiralty at Capital could not possibly have confirmed it
before the war broke out. Thus he can only have been breveted (almost
certainly by Duchess Delphine). He may have been confirmed before he was
dismissed, but then it would have taken time for the Emperor to get around
to giving him a peerage. IIRC there were no mention of a noble title in the
last TNS newsbriefs about him (in 1112 or so?).

Ah, _sector_ Moot. That\'s assuming there IS a sector moot to begin with.
Even then he would only have a seat if he had a peerage, wouldn\'t he?

But Roddy Santanocheev is a good character with potential nontheless. Maybe
Santanocheev is a close relation of someone who DOES have a peerage (The
Duke of Trin, for example), which would work out the same way.

Reputedly there was an old Chinese legal recourse, trial by kite.  The
accused was strapped to the frame of a huge kite.  If he survived the
launch, subsequent flight of a set duration, and landing he was innocent.
This is of course a variation of trial by ordeal.  Perhaps this is the
source of the expression "go fly a kite".

There is the method of judgement and also of picking a punishment where in a
random passage from some holy book is selected and interpreted for guidance.

Regarding Punishment

While not a judgmental method in the strict sense there is the method by
which, in ancient times, an accused may avoid execution by finding an unwed
woman to marry him.  Watch the movie with Jack Nickelson "Going South".

There is also the ancient principal of punishment by example where by one of
the group of the accused, selected by lot, is punished for the entire group.
The rest are allowed to live presumably having learned from the example.

There is the ancient form of punishment where by all ignore the existence of
the guilty and render no assistance to him or them.  On certain worlds with
closed environments this could mean no doors open, no food, no medical
assistance... nothing works for the guilty.

How about the ancient practice of "outlawing" where by the accused is
declared an "outlaw", forfeits all his goods and is given a running start,
in extreme cases naked, before hunting season is declared.  "Be out of town
by sun up."

How about the old S/F chestnut of being sentenced to the organ banks.  In
minor cases this would involve loss of a body part in more extreme cases
vivisection.

Just a few historical and fictional models of judgement and punishment.

Colt\'s Manufacturing a "Megacorp"???

That almost killed a keyboard I was laughing so hard!

They\'ve lost most of the government contracts they used to have and only 
have the M-4 contract because of some smoke and mirrors 
legislation.  They\'ve steadily lost market share over the years, and the 
last time they ever were \'dominant\' in the way a Megacorp would be was back 
near the turn of the century.

Lockheed-Martin, General Electric, United Defense, now those are megacorps.

I won\'t even touch the gun control issue for fear of starting yet another 
round on that issue.

Cheaper and much higher quality in the case of the 1911 series.

No, no a thousand times no!! A/UX was Apple\'s Unix implementation, IIRC it
was a BSD-ish variant. AIX is IBM\'s rather twisted sick and throughly
weird implemntation of something that pretends to be unix. Only that
FrankenUnix known as HP-UX comes close to AIX in weirdness.

(You see, HP bought a little workstation company called Apollo. HP\'s
existing Unix was ATT based, Apollos was BSD based, and so they decided
"Hey, lets take the non-obvious course and _merge_ the two!"
Unfortunately, BSD and ATT  were quite different critters at the time,
meaning if you\'re trined in either major variant of Unix, you\'re never
_quite_ sure how things will work on a HP-UX box.)

("You are in a twisty maze of different Unices, all slightly different..."

Tha Mac emulator for Linux that was being referred to is, I believe,
SheepShaver, which allows _Macs_ running Linux or BeOS run Mac apps more
or less natively.

I also see electrical stimulus to keep a person fit and strong while they

station on the ship where you go and climb into a pod or something similar
to receive this "exercise". We already have something like this today for
paralization victims (if you can afford it) and it seems to work a little

Both of these operations could be running as part of the life support

do like it and am using it in a short story I\'m working on for BITS. More to

This is my answer as to why all the characters look like "Greek Gods". There
can even be settings for those cultures that like their specimens a little

United Defense? Perhaps you mean United Technologies. That\'s definitely a

corporate giants JUST merged), BP/Amoco?

Any input from the European and Asian sectors?

[snip]

A few years ago (probably areound 10-15 by now), trial by combat was
still technically legal in Maryland. A friend of mine was representing
the defendant in a criminal case. Said friend is also in the SCA.
It was agreed to have a trial by combat; the details were all set.
Unfortunately, the DA wussed out. Apparently, the offense was a minro
one and the judge had a great sense of humor (Vincent Femia, now retired).
*sigh* 

I think the state legislature may have taken the hint and "fixed" the
law.

Ummm, I\'m not sure where the thousand times no comes from. Apple stopped
selling A/UX and started selling their own RS/6000 implementations as servers.
There were a bunch of others doing similar - Hitachi, Motorola, Bull. Since the
hardware implementations (despite both the Mac and the RS using PowerPC) were
incompatible they had to run AIX as the OS. The Apple boxes were actually
pretty nice, but Apple had neglected to set up a channel capable of selling
them.

As for your opinion of AIX and for that matter HP/UX ... AIX is OK. I\'d prefer
it to HP/UX, sit it alongside Solaris and prefer Linux to all of them (though
for commercial use Linux still has a couple of things to sort out). I\'m amazed
that these statements about AIX still abound (probably from people who haven\'t
looked at it since 3.1). 

DomainOS was weird though, I\'ll grant you that.

Also, pencil leads smear; the result is powdered graphite.  Powdered
graphite is flammable.  The shuttle flew with a pure oxygen environment...

My NASA buff friend John Nowak also says that according to a National
Geographic article, the Soviets attempted to design space pens (and spent
the money on them) but failed.  They now buy pens from Fischer, who also
sells them to NASA ... at a slight loss, due to the terms of the early
agreement (they make up in profit by commercial sales).

IMTU, you need to run the FTL drive for a while (about 1 High Guard
combat round) before you actually leave normal space. If you\'re 
trying to jump out of a combat situation, it\'s nice to have power
for both the normal space drive and the FTL drive so you don\'t 
become a newtonian target drone (and shortly thereafter, dead)
in the meantime.

You can listen to what you hear on TV and call it the New Millennium.
Or, you can count the years yourself and realize that the New Millennium
actually doesn\'t start until the year 2001--because Year 0 never
happened.

You can move through New Year\'s Eve enjoying the grandest party you\'ve
ever been to, or you can sit at home, alone, with Dick Clark, like it is
just another day, and have just as good a time.

You can move into tomorrow with goals of loosing weight, working out,
stopping smoking, discovering your soul mate, finding a better job,
writing a novel, or even making a movie.  Or, you can go to work on
Monday with nothing more on you mind than what you had going to work on
Friday.

The point is, there are as many ways to look at the New Year as there
are pairs of eyes around to look at it.  Find out what is most important
to you, and live that.

Be that.

I refer to a couple of cliches:  The way others perceive you is not as
important as the way you perceive yourself.  You just can\'t please
everyone, so please yourself.

As 2000 approaches me here in Houston, Texas USA, I extend my warmest,
best wishes and hopes for the New Year to those who own my heart, my
family and closest friends, and to everyone reading this message.

Your dreams will come true if you make them.  May your dreams come true
in 2000.

I leave you this year with a note, copied below, found handwritten on
Mother Teresa\'s wall.  Her words inspire and touch me.

============================

People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered;
Forgive them anyway.

If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;
Be kind anyway.

If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true
enemies; Be successful anyway.

If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;
Be honest and frank anyway.

What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;
Build anyway.

If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;
Be happy anyway.

The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;
Do good anyway.

Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;
Give the world the best you\'ve got anyway.

You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God;
It never was between you and them anyway.

That\'s the point. If humans and chimps are interbreedable, then we\'ve
misclassified, and either Pan trogolydytes (IIRC) should be Homo Pan,
or we should be Pan sapiens. 

The book _The Third Chimpanzee_ by Jared Diamond is about exactly 
this. The second chimpanzee is, IIRC, the Bonobo, who along with
Aslan and man is remarkable (if not unique) for having developed
recreational homosexuality.

Hmm. before I implement this idea, I\'d like to poll the people in the Bay

1. Do you own firearms?

2. Are you skilled in the martial arts?

3. How fast can you run when enraged?

4. Would you hit a man with glasses?

There used to be (i can\'t find any sign of it now) a megacorp named
Beatrice.  For a time it appeared that either controlled or influenced
every single food corporation in North America.

That\'s a megacorp.  People in the 3I probably aren\'t going to buy a General

subsidiary of Heinman, LIC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of General

Not really..  The basic idea is that in the near future, an astronaut gets

While I appreciate this, I wasn\'t hired to transcribe CT.  I\'m remaining
faithful to what has gone before, while incorporating things from history
that in my opinion, make the Marines more interesting.

Before the age of communications, Marine Officers were mainly selected from
the NCOs who managed to survive a few engagements.  You can\'t have a
wet-behind-ears-newbie with a shiny academy degree leading a platoon when
he doesn\'t have any practical experience, and might be the *only* Marine
officer on the planet.

This is also based on my personal bias.. during my service, the best
officers were those who had been prior enlisted.

In my Traveller universe, organized crime exists at many levels
and in many permutations, so just about any answers could be
true.  Often, criminal organizations are composed of members of
an extended family, and it may be necessary to marry into the
family.  Standards for skill levels and whatever are usually not
terribly important.  As long as you\'re good people, you can be
employed by the family or organization.  If you prove yourself,
you can marry in and get a bigger piece of the action and of the
power.  

Although criminal organizations frequently specialize (e.g.,
assassins don\'t usually get involved in racketeering or drug
distribution, but may be hired by them; grifters and swindlers
don\'t usually get involved in violent crimes), most of them
usually have use for a foul-tempered, unscrupulous bully.

From the Diary of Warrant Officer 1st Class Sven Lindstrom, Gram
Army.

Saurus, 171-1109

After dropping the infantry in the LZ, we laagered the gcarriers
on bit of high flat ground and waited.  I had seen a village a
few hundred meters below, and decided to investigate it.  The
villagers had all fled.  I wandered on dirt alleys between huts
made from thick leaves and wood.  In a rather elaborate hut, I
found a small, low bench on which incense and flowers had been
arranged.  The bench was beautiful, a work of art, artfully
fitting four kinds of wood together in a tongue-and-groove
construction, by a society that was not able to smelt iron.  I
stole it.  

I brought my trophy back to the laager and showed it to my
comrades.  "Look how strong it is," I said, standing on it.
"They made it without nails."

"Stupid Sauros haven\'t invented nails," said Sergeant Kjellsen.

For a decent overview, read stories from C.J. Cherryh\'s Alliance/Union

An interesting subtopic - one I\'d like to see her explore - is the

The criminal procedure instructor in my bar review course told
us this much about Miranda:

"Miranda warnings will likely be on the bar exam.  You already
know everything you need to know about them.  If you think you
don\'t, just watch any cop show on tv tonight, and pay attention
when they arrest the bad guy."

He was right.  It goes like this:

"You are under arrest.  You have the right to remain silent.  If
you choose not to exercise that right, anything you say can and
will be used against you in a court of law.  You have the right
to have an attorney present during questioning.  If you cannot
afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you by the court. 
Do you understand the rights of which I have just advised you?"

Interesting concept Russell. Tell me do you have pre-Jump (last minute)
manuvers have an affet on Jump as well? Say increasing chance for mis-Jump,
or randomizing the exit vector, or other nasties? Humm, I can see some
possibilities in this! Modifying it according to astrogation and/or piloting
skills, engineering,etc!

However, my original argument still applies, I can see military vessels
being over powered, and even brand new commercial ships. However, an old,
"well modified" free trader is very likely (IMHO) to have to allocate power
according to priority, because the "extras" are more than the Power Plant
can handle at one time.

Yes, that\'s exactly correct.

If it\'s the article I\'m thinking of, it\'s useless.  It tries to

In my Traveller Universe, the Imperial criminal justice system
is accusatorial, not adversarial.  Finding the truth, not
fairness of result, is the goal.  Imperial judges (whose noble
rank is at least Baron) have wide powers to investigate Imperial
crimes.  

The rights of the accused depend in part on the accused\'s rank. 
A noble has the following rights

- -to be released on bond, including the word of another noble;

- -to challenge the prosecution before trial to show that the
prosecution is motivated by evidence linking the noble to the
crime, i.e., that the prosecution is not politically motivated;
the noble may present evidence in support of the challenge;

- -to a trial before a tribunal of judges of equal or higher noble
rank, which is a quasi-adversarial proceeding; 

- -to examine the evidence against him or her before trial; 

- -to engage an attorney and investigators; 

- -to make any statement of explanation or exculpation; and

- -to accuse others.

A commoner has the following rights:

- -to engage an attorney and investigators; 

- -to make any statement of explanation or exculpation; and

- -to accuse others.

>As far as the individual worlds who knows???

Anything goes.  Under the Imperial agreement with each world,
every world may enforce its own laws against anyone within its
territory except for the starport, Imperial facilities, and
officials from the Imperium with diplomatic credentials. 
Officials from other worlds, whether Imperial or not, are
normally given diplomatic immunity as well.

Second; I have been creating a spread sheet for creating a full sector at
a shot using the MT rules from the MT:Referee\'s Manual.

I have noted that there are worlds created that just do not work. The
problem has been that they are all Asteroid worlds but with a Tech level
that does not allow one to live on an Asteroid. The most extreme examples
are worlds 4 and 7. Worlds 2 & 3 could, if poorly, repair and sustain
life support systems.

Does anyone have any possible ideas as to how such a low tech could live
on an Asteroid without imported tech or being corrupped by the imports to
a higher tech?

Russell, I\'m a heretic, so don\'t preach High Guard to me...I don\'t
worship at that altar. <g> 

I rarely deal with military ships, but of course, on *military*, and
refitted paramilitary ship, someone has probably decided that there
should be enough pwer for the weapons *and* the drives, but on a
civilian ship...maybe not.  See, civilian ships aren\'t *supposed* to
be in combat situations.  Now, we both know if PC\'s are around them
they may well be, but that doesn\'t mean the ships should have been
designed for the situations *PC\'s* get involved in.  My philosophy
is that when things become non-routine PC\'s should have to work to
make the ship do everything they need it to do, when they need it to
do it.

IMTU, you have to charge up your accumulators before jumping.  While
you\'re doing that you don\'t have your jump grid running, the CG/AG\'s
don\'t have to be running at full power, the HEPlaR drive doesn\'t
*have* to be online, you can even "dim the lights" to conserve power
<g>, and if you want to fire weapons at the same time...then you
should have thought of that beforehand.

Well, the two kills I\'ve sustained over the years -- both at your hands,

Humans and Banoboes are the only species I\'ve heard of where promiscuous
sexual activity is common amongst adults, but where adults who engage in
sexual activity with undearage individuals are driven from the group.
(There was a journal article about this Ca 87 to 90, don\'t remember which
journal, though; assigned read for Intro to Anth). But all of the Pan genus
show the same Step-dad-infanticide/abuse pattern so common in humans (H
Sapiens). As for the aslan, there is no Canonical reference to Recreational
Homosexuality... But dominance homosexuality is common in dogs, so I expect
it to be common in Vargr.  Much the same way it was practiced in Greek
societies... (It\'s ok to be the penetrator... just not the penetratee...)
Thus every Vargr Male wants to be "Top Dog"!

Oh, BTW, Hyena Females use that False Penis in dominance behaviors. Wait a
minute: Aslan are Anchient Hyena-Lion Hybrids!!!!! <GDR>

Some of us disagree with the faithful part... But you the one with the deal
in place. Then again, you\'ve had to pick and choose from contradictory
source matierials... IMTU I\'ve made some VASTLY different choices. Choices
which don\'t seem to be anyhwere close to the direction GT is taking. (And
Doug, while I disagree with your choices, I respect that you\'ve been
consistant in your methods From what I\'ve seen, and respect that.)

I agree about the "rise through the ranks" officers generally being
better... But IMTU, the marines can use EITHER the Military Acadamy OR the
Naval Acadamy, but marine pilots have to have gone to the Naval Acadamy.
Then again, not all the marines IMTU have worn Battle Dress... They do get
VaccSuit-0, tho\'. And I\'m considering using the option on first Spl Duty to
allow Battle Suit-1 & Drop Ops -1, and then further SD\'s may choose either
one (In lieu of the normal rolls in Basic MT CGen).

Glenn, you forgot one other category which MUST be exempted to avoid suits
against the government: Imperial Military personell *_on duty_*. Including
the Scouts... otherwise, military personell on assignment off the facilty
(especially short term, like carrying a message to the local gov\'nor\'s
Guard Captain) need also to be protected... Especially the marine who
delivers the "Capitulate Now, or Else!" message to uncoperative worlds.

02) E000855-9 _ As Na Va _ 821 _ F9 V A1 V
03) E000473-9 _ As Ni Va _ 132 _ F4 V

Lessee, TL nine is pre-gravitic, but spacefaring. We\'re TL 8. So it is
rather simple there... They have the infrastucture capability.

04) X000213-1 _ As Lo Ni Va _ 820 _ M9 V

A 800 person corporate location. Sounds to me like they\'re probably rated
not on common tech but upon local production. They\'re able to work soft
metals.

As an adventure hook, I\'d say it\'s probably a heavily overbuilt station,
with natural processes for aircirc... a biosphere under 3m Glass. No, they
can\'t repair it. It was originally someone\'s prison colony, then they
formed a corporation rather than let it be shut down, affter the second
generation was born.

08) X000001-5 _ As Lo Ni Va _ 341 _ M7 IV

A hermit. He\'s got some manufacturing capability, and his high common is
probably 9, low common about 4... Oh, and his two kids live with him...
They can make vaccum tubes, but not semi-conductors... And he said "No
Nukes" to the Scout who asked him "What do you locals allow?"

TL represents Local Unsupported Capability. You don\'t count imports. You
don\'t count irreparable artifacts. Just what they can locally produce by
local means.

And don\'t forget, according to GURPS, in (checks watch) just under 2 1/2
hours, the Eastern Time Zone in the US will have access to technologies
such as "human cloning, powerful exoskeletal suits, pistol sized laser
weapons, and immensely powerful cyborgs."  [_Murphy\'s Rules_, 2d
edition, pg. 36]

Those of us here in the Central Time Zone have to wait _another hour_
for these technologies.  :-P

OTOH, one of the things that makes AuricTech ships a bit more costly is
that we here at AuricTech _do_ believe that an armed ship, military or
civilian, should have enough power to run all n-space systems
simultaneously.  After all, what\'s the point of arming a ship if _using_
the weapons makes the ship _more_ vulnerable?

Naturally, this approach costs more, but that\'s the AuricTech Way [tm]. 
(Which means, of course, that buying an AuricTech ship to avoid power
allocation worries means that the PCs have to work harder to make ends
meet. <g>)

Another possible explanation is that the world\'s infrastructure doesn\'t
support production of goods above the listed TL, nor are items above the
listed TL routinely imported _for consumer use_.  However, if, for
instance, the belt is a mining world, it may prove worthwhile (depending
on the substances mined) to import high-tech life support machinery. 
This would not necessarily reflect in the world\'s listed TL, since folks
going to that system can\'t expect to buy items of the higher TL, nor can
the get repairs on any of their high-tech equipment.

I\'m sorry, but I\'m a college student (which means I have no money), and
a US Army interrogator (which means I have no soul).  I wouldn\'t be able
to cover the charges.

Oh, boy! Oh, Boy! OH, BOY!
I\'m going to start warming the cloneing tube, break out the exoskeletal suit
stick a laser pistol in it\'s claw, and self implant some heavy duty
electronics! I\'ve been keeping them down here in the Y2K bunker for over a
year now, and I amost FORGOT that they\'d work in just under an hour and a
half! Wait until Armagodon falls, I\'ll be ready for it THIS time!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Ok, so it\'s not really the 3rd millennium for another year; however, =
here\'s what we at THUDDD have planned for the year 2000.  Of course, by =
the time you read this it will be probably be the year 2000.

Okay, enough confusion about the new millennium.  :-)

While we are waiting on Black ICE to get the Commerce Raider together, =
we will go ahead and do the Modular Cutter for THUDDD 11.  THUDDD 12 =
will be the Commerce Raider and THUDDD 13 will be skipped.  I am still =
looking for an Assistant Coordinator for THUDDD 14.

Confused?  So am I.  I really shouldn\'t write this stuff after starting =
the New Years Eve celebration (hey, at least this time, I didn\'t spell =
it with an \'s\').

Okay, here\'s the spec\'s for THUDDD 11 (the official release date for =
this is 1/3/00, but what the heck):

[From IN Press Release 0035-109-1009, Capital/Core]
      Lord Jonas Mac Finny, a representative of the Imperial Bureau of =
Transportation (IBoT), announced an IBoT initiative to upgrade current =
standards for small cargo transport, specifically a new standard for =
what is commonly referred to as a Modular Cutter. IBoT was prompted to =
announce this initiative by the constant complaints concerning the =
massive cost of current standard units.
      Lord Mac Finny provided spec\'s for the current standard units:
               Modular Cutter
            Tons 50
            Crew 2=20
            Cargo 15

            0 Fire Control Rating=20

            Passengers High/Medium 12
            Passengers Low 0
            Controls: Civilian Standard
            0 Jump Rating
            4 G Rating/Maneuver Drive
            4 Power Plant Rating
            13.5 Rating/Scoop/Refine
            0A 2P 0J Sensor Rating
            0 Armor  Cost: 28 MCr
             =20
            TL 9=20



            6 Structure=20
          =20

               Modular Cutter: Using a 50-ton hull, the cutter is =
capable of 4G, carries 2 tons of fuel, and has a crew of two. It has 30 =
tons committed to special detachable modules; the craft has 2.t tons =
excess space available for weaponry or ancillary items.=20

            Three interchangeable modules are routinely available for =
the modular cutter:
                  The ATV Module (which includes an operational ATV) is =
30 tons. It can land and retrieve an ATV on a world surface. The module =
can serve as an ATV storage location, if desired.
                  The fuel module, with 30 tons of fuel tankage, serves =
as a fuel skimming vehicle and storage tank.
                  The open module is a customizable frame with 30 tons =
of excess space, which can be allocated to passenger couches, fuel, =
cargo, cabin, or staterooms.
             =20

    =20
      Indicating that the new standard should meet or exceed the current =
standard for less money. Preferably much less. Lord Mac Finny was quick =
to assure this reporter that the winning design firm would be given a =
contract to produce an initial run of 2 dozen Modular Cutter and would =
be able to expect annual contracts to produce hundreds more after the =
completion of trials.

Due to concerns expressed by some, this competition will be closed to =
those who only design using GURPS.  We wouldn\'t want any of the THUDDD =
designs to influence anything produced for use in an actual Traveller =
source book, now would we?  ;-)

All kidding aside, we wish the developers of the Modular Cutter Source =
Book all the best in the world.

I\'m looking forward to seeing those Non GURPS designs.

You know, when I recently ran across a picture of Capt.
Jamison, I was reminded of a social studies teacher/coach I
had in high school.  Coach Haskins was built like Capt.
Jamison appears to be.  Very heavy.  When I first met him, I
thought he was fat.  The first day of try-outs for football,
Coach Haskins challenged us to knock him over.  Like
everyone else, I tried.  Like everyone else, I discovered that
the fat was only a few cm thick.  The rest of him was bone
and muscle.  Hitting him felt like hitting a padded brick wall.
Even if he had lost the few cm of fat, he would have still
looked like a young beardless St. Nick.

The reason I mentioned it was because someone I know is
enrolled in a local (Sacramento area) law school that does
not even offer one course on constitutional law.

Perhaps we should collaborate on developing some.  It

I\'m on the u.S. left coast, so we haven\'t passed the midnight
mark just yet; however, let me remind you that if those
"doomsayers" hadn\'t been screaming for the fix, there would
likely have been nothing done about it.  Could you imagine
what that would have been like?

Yes, but even that was an improvement over what happened
15 years before (1984).
