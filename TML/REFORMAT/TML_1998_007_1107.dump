Thank you for pointing that out.  I mentioned it previously in another

Of course, even without the jump bubble, sending a transmition a parsec

problem.

Is your concept of Jump taking place in normal space, with a jump bubble
bending laws of physics within it? Seems this would allow someone to
shut off the power and simply drop into normal space - allowing a 
jump-6 ship to accomplish a Jump-1 in a day, at least to the edge of 
a gravity well.

As for sending FTL communications a parsec taking "stupid amounts"
of energy - there are people who would pay to be six days ahead
of the competition, no matter how stupid the energy requirements
were. Besides, once you have fusion power, it takes one monstrous
energy requirement to qualify as "stupid".

I\'m hoping that GURPS Traveller doesn\'t use the ship design in GURPS
Space since it is incompatible with Vehicles.  I wouldn\'t mind seeing
a simplified ship design book geared towards GURPS Traveller come out
later, though.  (Or included in G:Traveller if they have the space).

For a sphere, mass increases as the cube of the diameter if density is
held constant.  Since rate of change varies as the cube of distance,
I think this means given two spherical objects of the same density but
different masses, the rate of change of the intensity of the gravity
field 100 diameters from either will be the same.  The intensity of
the gravity field itself will not be the same, but that apparently 
isn\'t the problem for jump drives (or the 100-diameter rule wouldn\'t
work).

So, given two starships with the same density as a typical planet, to
jump safely they\'ll need to be about 100 ship lengths apart.  For a
50-meter spherical ship of about 1500 displacement tons, this comes
out to about 5 km.  Less dense ships could manage somewhat closer,
but this works as an illustration.

The TNS articles on the drop tank ships imply that "long-storage"
capacitors were required.  Also, the Trimkhana-Brilliance didn\'t seem
to misjump, but was destroyed by capacitor discharge.  As I read it,
jump capacitors have to be discharged almost immediately from full
charge, or you get a spontaneous discharge that destroys the ship
just like a black globe overload.  On the other hand, the ship needs
to have enough time to get a safe distance between it and the drop
tanks to avoid misjump.

As I wrote for the descriptive text of my T4 Trimkhana-Brilliance
design, my guess is that improved military jump-capacitor technology
was developed for black globe equipped capital ships and drop tank
equipped ships like the Gazelles.  After the Fourth Frontier War,
the Imperium declassifies the technology, which allows Tukera to 
start using it on commercial drop tank equipped ships in the core.
The improved capacitor technology gives you only a little time more
before spontaneous discharge; enough to give a warship some more
breathing room or a liner to drop tanks, but not enough for the
Trimkhana-Brilliance to clear a defective drop tank that failed
to detach.  All this is conjecture, though.

6:1 is terrible for a rocket. That means that if I want 1.5 G acceleration 
for a decent lift-off, and have no payload, no mass for the structure or
fuel tanks, I still only get a mass ratio of 4:1, and can\'t make orbit
even with ISP of 800. Makes a good upper stage, though, since then you don\'t need
high acceleration.

Also, the reason the disaster happened is that the drop tanks di not
properly separate, hence the displacement of ship+drop tanks is greater
than the jump drives would handle. The reason they had the disastrous
capacitor overload is that they were trying to dump the drop tanks before
jump (which, given the displacement difference of theship vs. the ship
with attached drop tanks, would have resulted in a serious misjump)

The tanks don\'t mass enough to require the ship to be very far away, they
just can\'t be physically attached when the ship jumps.

Well, most GURPS gearheads have converted over to GURPS:Vehicles instead.  You
can do a reasonable job of building Traveller ships by making your vehicles TL
10 with TL 11 reactionless thrusters, plus requiring fuel consumption from your
FTL drives comparable to Traveller (assume 1 DT = 500 cf).  The resulting ships
are typically less dense and somewhat more effective than comparable Traveller
ships -- I haven\'t done a lot of conversions, but I went to the effort of
designing a far trader:
Volume: 100,000 cf (200 displacement tons)
Cost: $23 million (approx)
Performance: 1G, jump-2.  Fuel sufficient for Jump-2.
Crew: around 7 (3 engineering/mechanical crew required, other crew is pretty
much a matter of taste).  4 cabins
Passengers: 8 + 4 low.
Cargo Space: 50,000 cf, assumed to contain 500 (short) tons of cargo.
Weight: 405 tons empty, 1000 tons with full cargo and fuel load.

When I made up a scout ship (which I posted to the GURPSnet
archive.) the only new component I really had to have was
Traveller style jump drive.  I found that I could take the
stats from MegaTraveller, convert the units, and just use it
as a GURPS Vehicles component (not counting price, though some
people on the GURPS list who have played with it say the costs
are pretty comperable).  For a maneuver drive you can use a 
GURPS drive.  They don\'t use near as much fuel as a 
Traveller maneuver drive, but then it all pales compared to
jump fuel.  (Though if you want you can either simply
require a GURPS maneuver drive to use the same amount
of fuel a Traveller one does, or you can use the MegaTraveller
stats as a component for GURPS Vehicles).  The only other
issues was, if I remember, grav plates for artificial 
gravity, which Vehicles didn\'t have (though that may be
dated.  I think I actually made up the ship before
Vehilces 2 came out).

We\'ve hit the limit with analog modems. 33.6k. The 56k is using a
*digital* return path. And it\'s pretty much a limit also.

And we are within sight of the point where quantum effects start
screwing up chip designs.

Again, it depends on the *shape* of the field. That\'s why I specified a
*uniform* field. For example, the field from a flat plate is *constant*
until your distance from the plate starts to approach the distance from
the edge of the plate. An infinitely wide flat plate would have a
gravity field that was the same *regardless* of distance from the plate!

The inverse square law is nothing but *geometry*.

You should be able to use the Windows Terminal program. There\'s also a

Which is why I want to do some "ancient" ships that have been refitted
"just enough" to let them keep being used. The sort of thing a world
that has space flight might do after being contacted by the Imperium or
other star faring culture. 

Picture a Space Shuttle fitted with a small fusion generator, and maybe
a fusion or Helpar drive. As long as you don\'t land, you can keep using
the External tank and the *existing* plumbing for LH2. 

Or a fission powered spacecraft with a jump drive added.

However, if you can, get a copy of GURPS Vehicles 1st Edition. The design system
there *works* ... or, to be more accurate, works in a sequential fashion. Sure,
the powerplant numbers are wrong, so use the 2nd Edition ones. The problem with
2nd edition is the same thing with MTrav and FF&S, you cannot design things
sequentially ... you have to have figures from steps supposedly further down the
design sequence before you actually have them (i.e. "Step 3 ... plug in figures
from Step 27!").

I would personally recommend Greg\'s VDS (Vehicle Design System) which is both
comprehensive *and* usable ... and provides far more detail than you\'ll ever
need in a form that is easy to understand and use.

Personally, I have all three ... I\'ve used GV#1 extensively and VDS extensively,
but I wouldn\'t touch GV#2 with a 10\' bargepole (same for FF&S or MTRav, both of
which I have as well).

Well, my understanding is that Vehicles is the default system.
There are, in fact, conversion notes for "FP" (fire power)
and DF (defensive factor) into the more standard GURPS terms
used in Vehicles and I think they are somewhat compatible
in that you can start using Space and then switch to Vehicles
if you want to get more into it (or, conversely, design
a ship in Vehicles and then design a similar one in Space).

No, that doesn\'t work.  My theory postulates that for just under half a
week, you\'re still in your start system.  During the near zero time at the
halfway point, gravity drops low enough that your speed reaches nearly
infinity and thus catapults you a parsec (or six) in comparitively no time.
During the last half of the week, you fight your way through the gravity
well to your destination.  Thus if you drop out after one day, you\'re still
in your original system, not very far away from start either.  Now this does
make Jump-0 less than a week (but I\'m willing to make an exception for that
case as it is the rare event as opposed to standard procedure).

You also need to focus it.  Going back to my original post, one of the
postulations is that focusing tech drops off at TL 15 (which would limit
accurate jumping and comms) and I wouldn\'t be so sure that FTL comm is
beyond the capability of TL 21 (I think you can teleport a parsec by then).

By Stupid amounts of power, I mean look at a star.  Now try to get some sort
of meaningful information out of it.  You would get comparable data flow
from comparable power levels (i.e. stellar power levels, i.e. a fusion
reactor the size of a sun)

Just for kicks last night I was tracking down some info on Voyager to find
out how far out it actually is.  The page included some data on Neptune
(compared to Earth).  I ran the gravitational formula for 100 diameters on
both and they came out rather close to the same amount of gravity at that
distance, about .002 G\'s. That might have been a coincidence though.

No, if the plate is producing Black hole levels of gravity, then as your nose
approaches the plate, it will be accelerated faster than the tail of your ship
producing the same problem. The whole volume would have to accelerate at the same
rate to prevent this.

I really enjoyed that story. ;->  Part of the premise was that aerospace
technology went the route of microelectronics technology with lots of
private innovation and less government intervention/control. This
*supposedly* lead to breakthroughs that allowed inexpensive earth to orbit
vehicles that "garage mechanics" could build.

It was a pipe-dream, of course, but a very enjoyable one.

And it *does*. There\'s no drop in acceleration with distance. Thus,
there\'s no gravity differential to rip you apart *regardless* of the
field strength. The field strength depends on the density and thickness
of the plate, nothing else.

This isnt strictly true. See, you buy goods in local credits, but the
transport costs are in Imperial credits (or at least in the credits of
TL9-11 worlds).

Assume our TL2 Yurt costs Cr200 a liter (lots of nice embroidery). However,
the TL2 world it\'s on has a currency worth 0.05 of an Imperial credit.
Therefore, the Yurt costs ICr 10 per liter, and thus isnt really worth
shipping. Unless of course Joe Noble wants one, and is prepared to pay well
over the objective value for it, on account of it being a marvellous
example of pre-industrial craftmanship.

Raising shipping costs by fiat doesnt work. You have to raise the cost of
shipping, either by increasing interest rates, or cost of ship components,
or misjump chances.

Well, yes. A limiting factor is that offworld goods have to be maintained,
technicians shipped in etc. Striker suggests maintainence costs of 20% of

Agreed, although I suspect that long-distance (more than 12 parsecs or so)
trade is limited to very valuable goods.

 Dave it\'s the other way around, Vehicles give conversions to Space.
Which is useful if you are using the Space combat system.
BTW, this system is repeated in Compendium 2.

This will not be quite the right answer, but an additional:

There\'s a fish (don\'t know the zoological nor the english name), which
\'spits\' his prey (mostly insects) unconcious with water \'bullets\'.

If you try to shoot someone with water, this weapon will possibly create

The manufacturers will put several CPUs on each chip. This is already done
today with the multiple execution units in RISC chips. In 10 years the
standard CPU might run at a few GHz but perhaps 16-64 CPUs in it.

Leonard posits a flat plate of infinite dimension. While this is handy
for the rest of his argument, it does not yield a useful real-world result.

The response overlooks this peculiar condition, appearing to assume a finite
plate.

A finite plate of a size to have a meaningful gravitational field would also
have problems with avoiding self-collapse into a lower gravitational
energy state, namely an approximation of a sphere.

The inverse square law models reality. Geometric methods are handy for 
showing that it is an accurate model, but the relationship is real.

The author\'s familiarity with Traveller, as Marc pointed out, is a passing
one rather than a truly deep understanding including the implications of
near-c rocks and technologically elevated dictators.

I would say, however, that this type of publication is definitely the
vector for getting new traveller players on board.  The departures from a
sketchy form of canon are minor in terms of gameplay, and the attachments
to the Traveller background and scheme are solidly there.

This novel is worth picking up if you are in for a long car trip and want a
good yarn to keep you company, especially if you can get it at a discount
as I did (friends in low places you know).  It was a quick read, and the
story was easy to follow, full of action and intrigue, and the dialogue,
while not Hemingway, was just fine.  The Travelleresque aspects were alos
entertaining (when correct; which was most of the time IMHO).  Certainly,
it was as good or better than the David Drake novel I read just before it
("The Voyage") which I cannot recommend.

There are several pages (4-6) of basic Traveller character generation rules
apparently designed to sort of pull in someone completely unfamiliar with
the game.  It gives some excellent basic ideas of what characteristics
really mean in just a few pages.

The novel ends with the words "To be continued..." and the story is
somewhat incomplete at that point.  Hopefully the author already had the
other two novels in the series (or other seven for all I know) "in the can"
and we\'ll see them on the shelf soon.

One possible outcome; This novel may lead some of you to say "hey! I can
write this stuff!".  I think more Traveller novels is definitely the way to
go.

Distance from front of ship to plate = D
Distance from back of ship to plate = D+L

Acceleration on front of ship = G/D^2
Acceleration on back of ship = G/(D+L)^2

At extremely large G\'s and large L vs. D, the gravitational differencial will
rip a ship apart.  A plane will do this just as bad as a point source.  Unless
you can think of a source in which all points within the ship are equidistant
from it, you\'ll always have this problem.

As I read it, the drop tank failed to separate at all, making it impossible
for the ship to jump, whereupon the capacitors discharged and ripped open
the ship.

>As I read it, jump capacitors have to be discharged almost immediately from
>full charge, or you get a spontaneous discharge that destroys the ship

Right. Old Style capacitors must discharge so soon after reaching full
charge that there is not enough time to safely get rid of drop tanks.
The "long-storage" capacitors invented in the late 11th Century can keep
the charge for a few minutes, but no longer (If you believe what _SOM_
says about being able to keep capacitors charged for several hours, then
the drop tanks of 1105 a "first generation" of the new technology and
matures considerably between 1105 and 1115).

One thing: Since _High Guard_ does not mention a TL limitation on drop
tanks, these "long-term" capacitors would seem to represent a genuine
new invention, not possible at any TL before 1050 or so, but possible
at TL 9 once it has been invented.

>On the other hand, the ship needs to have enough time to get a safe
>distance between it and the drop tanks to avoid misjump.

Yeah, but the ship only needs to get a safe distance from the drop tanks,
which will be much less than the safe distance from a ship (since an
empty drop tank has so low a density). The whole explanation is very
"hand-wavy" (Not that I mind terribly, but I know there are others that do).

For anybody else testing, try reducing your window size to about 400x600
or smaller.  Maybe 320x200.  Then you should see the aforementioned
problem.  Which isn\'t a problem really, just that somebody is looking at

I was under the impression that this sort of charge was stored in an overloaded
HPG.  Although beyond its safe limits, it could maintain the charge for a short
period without flying apart.  Stronger materials can increase the safe load, but
you can still overload it a bit if you keep the charge short.

These last two seem to be accurate for a point source, but not a plane.  An
infinite flat plate has a constant force, and an infinite line falls off as
a log, IIRC.  For the real details, get a copy of Halliday and Resnick, and
take a look at the chapter on calculating the electric and gravitational
potential near objects of various shapes.  (I would give chapter and verse,
but I have not yet picked up the latest edition.)

As a way to determine this directly, integrate over the area of the plate,
noting that you are subject to a potential of -(G dM m)/r from each element
of mass dM, and you can find a function that gives you r in terms of x and
y, as well as dM in terms of dx and dy.

F = int(P).

From this, you can determine the result of a non infinite plane, and find
the size of a disk needed to produce a desired force without substantial
edge effects.  Charles Sheffeild used this in his MacAndrew Chronicles for
a balanced drive.

Not so.  As Leonard has pointed out, a plane is very different from a point
source.

This is quite germane, BTW, as Traveller has fields that are essentially
constant, else they would need to have the decks point in the direction of
thrust.  How they do it is not revealed, and it is not revealed whether the
fields drop to zero at the hull, making it a "gravity ground" as it were,
or whether they are symmetric.

I\'m assuming that the gravitational force is acting perpendicular to the plane and
that the front to back axis is in line with the  perpendicular.

Now if you\'re saying that the whole gravitational field is pulling, then you have
the situation where the gravity on either side of the ship pulling it apart
sideways, and I still think the nose will get ripped off.

I\'m affraid somebody else will have to do the integration to prove this (its been
a while for me)... let me see if I can figure out some of it.

G = Sum( gravity at various points)
      Gr = gravity at r radius from perpendicular intersection of plane (0 r =
point of impact on plane)
      Gr(D) = G/ (r^2 + D^2)  [from pythagorean theorum and newtonian graviation]
      Gr(D + L) = G/(r^2 + (D+L)^2)
     Sum r:0->Infinity Gr(D)
Without going through the integration, as r approaches infinity D and L become
less important.  As D approaches 0 L become more important.   If I\'m picturing
this right, a planar gravity body has even more effect on the gravitational
disparity than a point source.  L ends up reducing gravity a little bit over the
whole summation thus the gravity at the front of the ship ends up proportionally
greater.

They use contra grav to imitate this.  If your ship is flying like a boat in
water, acceleration is acting perpendicular to your ship\'s gravity ground.  To
compensate, they generate gravity opposite of this thrust to balance out the
vectors.  Then they add gravity on the otherwise zero G environment to give you a
gravitic ground.  Note that some ships accelerate in line with their gravitational
normal. I think the Mercenary cruiser is one.

+$3.95 shipping.  I just went and ordered it, expecting standard shipping
by US mail, for a small paper back would be a buck or so.  Even a priority
mail order would only be $3.  Ouch.  But hey, they will probably through in
the "comp shipping upgrade" to priority anyway.

Amazon.com is too dangerous.  Once click ordering.........

  I\'d have to check with a specialist to be sure, but I suspect the
analogy here is not relevent. Also, while the size of the transmitter
focussing array might be an issue, even if stationary, the receivers
can be truly huge, and largely replace the strategic aspect of the
X-Boat system by having links set up at major sector capitals and
Capital, for example. With all units set up "outside" stellar gravity
wells, the commo beams should be effectively instantaneous by the
model suggested.

  Actually, by my model jumping to an empty space would be nearly
impossible.  Without a gravity well to guide you or slow you down, stopping
at the right point becomes problematic.  Keep in mind that in an empty space
your moving at nearly infinity.  Now, if you\'re jumping from the outer limits
of a system to the outer limits of another system, then travel time would be
less.  But this can be accounted for since jumps take 6 to 8 days or 5 to 9
days with a "misjump".  The  variability occurs because you can\'t target a
planet until you\'re in the system, by that time you\'re moving relatively
slow.  So if your destination planet is on the far side of the system, your
trip will take longer. If you luck out and your destination is really close
to your system entry point, your trip would be quicker.

The concept is to mimic the rules with theory.  The rules do have some
variability in travel time. Misjumps involves being slightly off center,
targeting the star, which puts you entering the system at the edge.  At the
edge, you might be close to your planet, or you could target the wrong edge,
thus the +/- 2 days.  A aggravated misjump would miss the system entirely
where the impure fuel or gravitational proximity warps your targeting.  The
result could send you d6 x d6 parsecs away at "near infinite" speed.  At
which point, various systems that you\'ve passed near affect your trajectory
and either you stop inside a system, or in those few seconds that you\'re at
"ludicrous speed" you manage to drop the bubble (unlikely) or you run out of
jump fuel to  pull you through jumpspace. Since there\'s no inertia (by
assumption), you stop (then you drop your jump bubble)

My theory does allow for intentional aggravated catastrophic jumps, i.e. "I
don\'t aim for a star. Engage jump drive... let\'s see what happens."

Since you do have to make some decisions about which gravitational
perturbation to fall into, this also lends credence to the "All starships
must have a concious pilot" rule.

I did some checking last night.  Radio waves take about one millionth the power
that light waves take. So it would take a millionth the size of a sun for the
transmitter. Which is about planetary scale?

  I could argue the logistics of such a set up, but it does come down to non-jump
field lightspeed acceleration allowing for FTL comms.  Thus, I need to ammend my
theory to accelerate lightspeed within the jump bubble.  My desire for natural
acceleration comes from the history of development.  Somehow, someone would have
to discover the lightspeed acceleration in order to develop the jump field to
take advantage of it...

Or I could modify the intention of the jump field.  Perhaps by converting
inertial mass into gravitational mass.  The unexpected side effect being the
aforementioned lightspeed acceleration. Thus, jump technology spins off from the
attempt to create inertialess drives... like grav plates and thruster plates.

This still allows for FTL comms at high tech levels by way of jump projector
technology found at TL 21.

A kilowatt laser with a moderate launch aperture should be able to put 
1 photon/second/cm^2 onto a reciever a parsec away. With a 1-m reciever
this is probably sufficient for data rates of 100 bits per second.
With a megawatt laser with better launch aperture you could easily hit 
a megabit per second.

sensors and weapons systems were very different (in terms of ranges and

The game _Paranoia_ has an "ice gun" which uses slivers of

But a conversion presented one way can just be reversed to be used

Additionally, you don\'t need to waste energy broadcasting
all all directions and the the intensity we observe from
nearby stars is way more than you need to send a signal
(heck, even a faint star is enough to be picked up
by the naked eye).

Nope, that´s probable correct. Nobody ever said star-travel on un-maintained
spacebuckets is completely safe. jumping into empty hexes can happen quite often.
Although i usually rule that empty hexes are not necessarily empty, they just don´t have
useable planets.
Although i´d also think the percentage is a little high though.

I guess it depends on team skill set.  Blockade runner is always a favorite
of mine.  War Profiteer.  Enemy Commerce Raider.  If they\'re pirates, give
them a letter of marque.  put them on a planet, send them away from their
ship, and then have Zho jump-troops take the starport.  They have to
infiltrate the port and steal their ship back...

 (my new CT campaign starts just after the end of the 4th Frontier war),
with a group of Sword Worlders who just inherited a ship.

Speaking of wartime, is there any reason given anywhere for the Sword
Worlds _not_ joining the outworlds coalition in the 4th Frontier war?

Most flywheel energy storage systems operate between two resonances - as
stopping the unit puts wear on the bearings. Assuming that this isn\'t a
problem (true active mag or grav bearings) you could handwave that the HPGs
in a drop tank push the upper resonance limits using a damping technology
to get more energy into the system, thus allowing a faster discharge if you
slow the HPG down afixed rate of spin. Maintaining the high speed would
increase the risk of resonance and failure...

I also suspect that HPGs would have their mass reduced if higher strength
is achieveable - usually they\'ll be looking at a fixed amount of energy
like a battery, and higher strength = higher speed = less mass required for
same energy storage.

	This depends on the ship, a trader in wartime has a different

	the other side has Midu-Agasham to ask, even if the Midu is a
	ship from "the other side". There they will then unload
	the troops, to get caught on ground by the "home" force. 
	To talk the own ship back from friend who think that the

	If the ship has nuclear missiles and a good PEMS they are lucky.
	Launche 3 missiles, let the drift for some days, detornate them

The first reference I heard for water bullets was in the Dick Tracy comic
strip back in the sixty\'s.  The Egyptians also used water cannon\'s to knock
down the sand barricades put up by the Israeli\'s in the 72\' war (IIRC) along
the banks of the Suez canal.  They went through them in hours when the
defenders had postulated it would take a 3 - 6 days to dig through them.

  I happen to be less than thrilled with allowing accurate jumps to
interstellar space, and have some concerns about mechanisms that allow
the use of auxiliary or collapsible tanks. Regardless, you need to 
cover those things to conform maximally with any edition of Traveller.

  There\'s a technical term that translates as "it does not follow".

  Better tell the people who designed the SETI arrangement. I haven\'t
seen any of the astronomers on the list touch on this (you try Trav
- -tech, I suppose) but I suspect that using the "C approaches infinity
in microgravity" case without jump bubbles it will be provably (and
very) economic to assemble an FTL commo system over the longest ranges.

	Nope. See, you\'ve got the point directly under the ship at distance
D, that\'s pulling at G/D^2. Then you\'ve got the point infinitesimally
to the left of under the ship, pulling with G/(D+a smidgen)^2, only
it\'s not pulling straight down, it\'s pulling at a slight angle. So
you have a vertical and a horizontal component. And you\'ve got the
point infinitesimally to the RIGHT of under the ship, also pulling
with G/(D+a smidgen)^2, also pulling at a slight angle. But its
horizontal component is opposite the left point, so they cancel out.
So your nose still doesn\'t get pulled out. 

	Do the math, and remember GmM/R^2 is technically ONLY valid for
point masses. When you integrate over all points in an infinite
plate, you find out that Leonard was right. Or trust us ... we\'re
from the government and we\'re here to help you.

  Well, that\'s why I posted my theory. So that I can refine it to conform to
"canon".

For starters, I assume the standard jump is from one planet to another planet in
a different system.  My system conforms maximally to this standard, most common
occurance.

Problem 1: FTL Comm.  My original theory would allow for VERY Expensive FTL
comms.  By accelerating C within a jump bubble, I\'m able to sidestep this
issue.  An added benefit is the use of FTL comms when jump projection becomes
available, about the same time that tech allows for parsec teleportation. (TL
21)

Problem 2: Jumps to empty space.  Although tricky and inaccurate, it is possible
by my theory. This only takes half the time, but I don\'t know of any canon
specifically stating that jumping into an empty space takes a week. I think
somebody may have mentioned deep space instalations, but I\'d need to see the
specifics to revise my theory accurately.

Problem 3: Drop tanks.  I\'d again need the specifics on what is possible with
drop tanks.  These seem to be the exception rather than the rule.

I have trouble with trust... especially of government... especially on tax day

First of all you are correct that given an infinite plane, the front and rear
of the ship will accelerate at the same speed.  That acceleration would be
INFINITE!!! I\'d like to think that you all aren\'t seriously hypothesizing (sp?)
generating an infinite gravitational plane.  So assuming an arbitrarilly large
yet finite plane we can generate the following formulae...
Lateral acceleration components will cancel each other out. Which leaves the
forward component.
Each point is pulling on the ship with G/L^2 where G is some gravitational
constant and L is the length of the line connecting the ship to the point. L^2
= r^2 + D^2 where r is the radius on the plane to the point and D is the
perpendicular distance from the plane to the ship.
The forward component is: (D/L) * (G/L^2) which reduces to DG/L^3 which can be
expanded to DG/ (r^2 + D^2)^1.5
Since the power of D in the denominator is greater than the power of D in the
numerator, for any point r, gravitational acceleration DECREASES with the
increase of D.  Since EVERY point is pulling on D more than it is pulling on
D+ship length, the sum of all the points pulling on D will be greater than the
sum of all the points pulling on D+ship length.  Thus the front of your ship
will accelerate faster than the tail of your ship, once this acceleration
disparity exceeds structural limits, your nose gets ripped off.

There might be some field that will produce a uniform acceleration, but it
isn\'t a plane.  It might be a surface revolution of a parabola around the
centerline of the starship.  But I certainly don\'t know the formula for that...

  All normal jumps take close to a week; no jump can be under the
minimum assigned to the "one week" value range, IIRC.

They will be on the Imperial Side doing "official" and
semi-official things.  (They aren\'t yet, but some of them are
scouts that will get called up and I\'ll draft some of the
others.)

How would commerce raiding work.  Wouldn\'t it just be a bunch
of space combats?

Getting stranded behind lines is an idea....

Why bother with handwaves when we know that Jumpspace is something we
really can\'t wrap our brains around.  If you\'re having fun doing all this
handwaving, then far be it from me to complain though :^)

It just seems like you\'re over complicating something that we don\'t even
have a handle on.

I think most sources say that a jump of any length takes a week.  To me,
this would imply that if you have a crazy rule-bending jump-15 drive, it
would take a week to cover 15 parsecs.  If you only travel 1/2 a parsec, it
still takes a week.  That\'s been pretty clear in most sources I can think
of.

Let\'s see.  Adventures during wartime, off the top of my head? All sorts of
small unit operations (you\'ve got assassinations, spy work, sabotage, base
infiltrations, theft of important plans, etc.).  If you\'re feeling wacky or
zany, they can always be assigned to escort and protect a famous
personality sent to entertain the guys and gals on the front.  They could
be assigned to some sort of MASH unit, where you can really hammer home the
horrors of war if you so desire.  They can guard art treasures or other
tidbits (possibly even ancient artifacts) as they are removed from planets
on the front lines (and maybe accidentally "lose" some in the process). 
They could be assigned or hired to protect civilian news or documentary
makers (and help them get to places that they\'re not supposed to go, and
uncover stories they\'re not supposed to uncover).

Look at "Casablanca", it was an adventure during wartime film (and an
extremely effective one), but, none of the main characters were direct
combatants, but it was still amazingly colorful.  Cross Rick\'s with the Mos
Eisley cantina, and you could have a whole campaign built around a single
place hardly touched by combat.

I am, of course, keeping away from the direct military plots, because I\'m
sure you\'ll hear enough of them, and I probably wouldn\'t run them in my own
game.

But they are reasonably self-consistent, and consistent with the space
combat rules provided. Just be sure to optimize your weapons (lasers,
missiles, particle beams) for space combat, and don\'t forget that passive
thermographics, radar, and PESA get a x10 range bonus in vacuum. 

A TL 8, modular turret (1500 cf) laser has an effective range of 5000
miles, and a max range of 15000 miles.  I\'d suggest changing the hex scale
from 100 miles per hex to 1000 miles, if you want to retain more of the
Brilliant Lances/Battle Riders feel to your combat.  Then, with the
ten-minute turns they use, one G-turn moves a ship one hex and produces a
vector two hexes long.  

The two systems from Traveller that need work-ups in GURPS are nuclear
dampers and meson-anythings (comms, cannons, screens).  You could simply
transfer these systems whole, but that runs the risk of propagating the
differences in range and capabilities you mentioned before.  I\'d be
interested to see someone\'s house rule adaptations for these systems in VE2.

This is an interesting model...

On the other hand, as I understand canon, the jump process is fire-and-
forget. That is, the bulk of the jump drive is a specialized power plant
that burns up the jump fuel very quickly and stores the power in specialized
capacitors which are then fully discharged into the jump grid. 
That discharge "tosses" the ship into jumpspace with the right "spin" to
exit jumpspace in the target system. Once jumpspace has been entered, there
is nothing the crew can do to alter the outcome of the jump. 

Your model makes for less handwaving, though...

Not exactly. Those are Dismountable or Collapsible tanks. Drop Tanks
are mounted on the outside of a ship, increasing the ship\'s fuel capacity
while also increasing it\'s volume. They can either be carried through jump
space (with the ship performing at a lower jump number), or can be 
emptied and dropped just before jump (allowing the ship to use the
fuel to jump with, but not take the increased volume penalty).

I find it interesting that fuel from a Drop Tank can be used directly by the
jump drives, but fuel from Dismountable Tanks in the Cargo Bay must first
be pumped into the ship\'s regular fuel tanks to be used. This implies to
me that Drop Tanks have a very direct connection to the rest of the ship\'s
fuel supply. Considering how lightweight and exposed Drop Tanks are,
this could be a very bad thing - I wonder if Gazelle Close Escorts ever 
make like WWII escort fighters and release their Drop Tanks before
entering combat?

No, jump energy is stored in something called zuchai crystals, a naturally
occuring substance with some quite interesting properties (artificial
zuchai crystals can be manufactured, but they are inferior to natural
zuchai crystals in some undefined way. Since these zuchai crystals are
imaginary, they can have whatever characterisitcs and abilities the
author wants, as long as their existence don\'t screw up some other
well-established technology. (For instance, what happens if you fill
a crystal chock full of energy and then hit it with a hammer? Could one
use such crystals as the basis of a weapon?).

On the contrary, you\'ve understood something that the people at IG never
did, namely that you can\'t maintain an interstellar civilization like the
Imperium with jump drives that behave like that rule claims they do. Thus, the
rule runs counter to 20 years of canon and must be regarded as un-canonical.
This was pointed out to IG quite quickly, and someone there replied that it
wasn\'t a mistake, but trust me, it was (And if Marc Miller himself were to
claim that it wasn\'t a mistake, I\'d still think it was wrong).

Volker A. Greimann replies:

>Nope, that´s probable correct. Nobody ever said star-travel on un-maintained
>spacebuckets is completely safe.

Better read the rule again. That 1-in-36 chance of a misjump is the best
chance you get. It is for ships with fully maintained jump drives. In other
words, it is the chance of a completely unprovoked misjump. I can easily
imagine a universe where that was the case, but it would look nothing like
the Traveller Universe.

>Although i´d also think the percentage is a little high though.

You\'re SOOOO right ;-). Something like 1-in-216 might be reasonable, though
I\'m not completely sure of that.

Commo and sensors in GURPS Vehicles are not based on fact but are
Rule-of-thumbed to make decent vehicle systems. I\'d say go with FF&SII for
sensors and commo except hydrophones, MAD systems etc. There are also some
notes on sensor stuff at the SJ websites (noise from p-plants and
drivetrains etc).

I think what he is thinking of is the field that exists between parallel plates. As long
as you are not close to the edges of the plates, the field will be uniform. I remember 
using this type of setup to get a constant electrical field in Physics class.

I\'ve had a small postwar skirmish between Sword worlds and the Imperium
(local Glisten subsector forces) as a backdrop and have noted some things:
War is either deadly or boring to get involved with directly, let the
players gather intelligence, smuggle warstuff, receive letters of marque to
go legally pirating, getting blockaded etc but avoid having them as
soldiers or other jobs directly involved with the war (my PCs might be a
bit more cunical than most - they are the ones that introduced nuclear arms
to the Aramanxs conflict after all).

Also note that the more or less homogenous field experienced between two
plates in a capacitor is actually created from attracting pointsources with
1/r^2 drop off. If you agree that capacitors work the way the are supposed
to then the homogenous grav field will work too.

Actually moves the ship AND produces a vector 2 hexes long. Otherwise you
wind up with a totally weird movement system where speed and speed are two
different measures one twice as big as the other.

The long-defunct Pocket Empire Mailing List did a lot of work with Reavers\'
Deep in 1200 (and quite a bit of background history too) before we suffered
from collective burn-out. Some of it, including map UPPs for at least one
subsector was published in _The Traveller Chronicle_ #6 and #7. ASCII maps
and UPPS for three more subsectors exist as well as a lot of odds and ends.
We really should get it posted somewhere (I considered doing it for Jim\'s
Galactic, but I decided that I have enough work to last me in my project to
do a Galactic sector of the Spinward Marches for roughly each century from
Year 0 to 1100 (So far I\'m 75% finished with Year 55 and about 10% begun on
Year 125, so don\'t hold your breath waiting ;-). Besides, I don\'t have a
web page. But if someone else wnat to set it up, I\'d be happy to let him
have my files of Aoreriyya.)

Hmm. I just dug out the ASCII maps I made of the four subsectors. Here they
are (Note: Names were taken from Gamelords publications when we could find
them, but a number of them were made up by us):

With that i was referring to the chance of jumping into an empty hex, not of the
percentage chance of misjumping.

I´d say that 1/36th is too high as well. That way, fleets would loose 1/36th of their
strength after a jump! No long term-lond distance operation could be reasonable carried
out. Just imagine the Corridor-fleet transfer to the Dulinor-front in MT. The non-combat
losses would have been astronomical!

I´d say that 1/216th sounds better indeed (that is 1,1,1 on three d6, right?)
Then 1/1296 sounds even better and fitting to Traveller Canon to me! 
If we were to use that, the DM´s would have to be adjusted, though!

For the most part, jumps do take a week. But jump 0 and jumps to empty space are the

Aren\'t those just extra fuel containers or collapsible bladders?  I\'m talking about
something you\'d eject and thus reduce your volume.

I thought the same thing. But there was a recent flamewar about whether or not you
could make a jump torpedo. The notion was, if you can do all the calculations and
you\'re pretty much out of control during jump, then why have a pilot at all.  Then
I looked at the fuel consumption for a jump.  At the appropriate tech level, a
fusion reactor using up all that fuel in relatively zero time would be orders of
magnitude larger than the ship. That lead me to the the curious formula for
jumpdrive size and fuel. 1+Parsec capability. So I postulated that the 1 in the
formula was used to generate the jump field for a week, while the rest of the fuel
gets converted into subatomic particals stored in the jump field and in the
Lanthanum coil.  The coil then launches one charge which the opposite charge
(suspended in the field) is attracted to.  This drags the field and ship forward
(at zero inertia, this doesn\'t take much).

Let me see if I understand this right.  The ship without drop tanks doesn\'t have
enough fuel for its maximum jump?  No, I\'m looking at the TNE Gazelle right
now.  Its got enough internal fuel capacity for its Jump 5 without the tanks.
Maybe the Gazelle doesn\'t have standard tanks but it looks like the procedure
is:1) Fill tanks
2) Jump 3 with tanks (using internal fuel)
3) pump fuel from tanks to internal
4) drop the tanks
5) Jump 5 with the (now) internal fuel.

There\'s no reason to drop your tanks in a jump field.

But  then you aren\'t moving.  You\'ll be stationary inside the grav plates.  If

Which is 1 in 72 on a well maintained ship using good fuel and not taking
risks (assuming average stellar density).

To determine if this is a reasonable risk, we ought to look at shipping
losses in various historical periods.  Did 16th-17th century Spanish
merchants risk losing 1 in 72 ships crossing the atlantic?  If so, then the
model may work.  I don\'t have access to Spanish or Colonial records, so I
can\'t determine if it\'s a close match.

Misjump is a factor which doesn\'t seem to have been added into the shipping
costs debate that was going on earlier.  Can you still ship TL6 Cloth Armor
75 jumps economically when there is a 75 *(1 in 36) chance of a misjump and
a 75 * (1 in 72) chance of a deadly misjump.

How do you all handle this IYTUs?  "I\'m sorry, your ship jumped to an empty
hex.  Do you have enough food and fuel for 3.26 years to get to the nearest
star?  OK, roll new characters."  This seems harsh.

  Note that misjumps can result in a 5 day jump and normal jumps can be 6 days,
so there are exceptions.

It can be.  It could also take place on a world or a highport.  Chris
Seaman\'s mentions Casablanca, which is an excellent adventure seed
generator.  Many war movies will work well.  The Dirty Dozen.  The Great
Escape.  Bridge on the River Kwai.

There are also numerous JTAS articles on the subject: I read two last
night: One called "A Dagger At Efate" and another about a Regina University
expedition to rescue an seven person archaeology team stranded behind Zho
lines at a dig on a water world.

>Getting stranded behind lines is an idea....

One that can be played again and again.  Misjump them into a big Zho
staging area, then let them fight their way back to tell the Imps about the
invasion force.  Have lots of intrigue as they have to get fuel at each
neutral port in between.  Have Zhos overjump them and be waiting when they
get there.

Use the time lag of communiations against them.  They\'re on a routine
mission to a friendly star, but it was captured two weeks prior to their
arrival by Zhos.

They\'re tied up at the docks having yearly maintainance done when the Zho
Fleet appears in orbit.  Do they run or do they try to convince the Zhos
that they are merchants who don\'t care who\'s in charge?

For some good reading on the subject of space war in a merchant-dominated
star empire, I\'d recommend CJ Cherryh.  Downbelow Station, Heavy
Time/Hellburner, Tripoint, Rimrunners. (Esp Rimrunners).  Good feel of a
war or close to war situation.  Also has all the same communication lag
issues that make Traveller society what it is.

Nooo! Think submarine warfare!

*The* most spine-tingling adventures can be had by trying to
infiltrate an enemy system or convoy to attack merchant
shipping while _avoiding_ the escorts. You need the
Traveller-equivalent of a sub. In effect, a starship which is
extremely stealthy (i.e. small and slow-moving with a
difficult-to-detect maneuver drive) and has the best 
_passive_ sensors available as well as powerful weapons
which are difficult to trace back to the shooter (in other
words, PAWS or meson guns). Shortcomings in any of
these areas makes the job much more difficult.

Anybody can say what they want about Brilliant Lances but
one thing it allowed for is the use of stealth tactics, especially
when used in conjuction with Merrick\'s BL sensor rules
modifications.

The are two major downsides of such an adventure to keep
in mind:

1) it can take a *long* time in realtime to play out.
 
You need a way to find a worthwhile target. With the lack of
FTL commo, just gathering the info can be one heck of a
challenge. Then you need to actually get to the area your
target will be at by the time you get there.

2) any vessel caught on such a mission will have every
military ship in range dedicated to killing it. 

And I do mean _kill_.

No merchant escort will ever consider for even a moment
trying to take prisoners when a merchant they\'re responsible
for is under attack and others could be attacked. 

These are some of the problems pirates face which is why
some TMLers believe piracy is virtually impossible in space.
The real problem with commerce raiding that piracy doesn\'t
have is the simple fact that, in a war, the hostile side
*assumes* commerce raiding will occur and will automatically
take steps to protect against it. Assuming you find a convoy
route that can be raided, the escorts are already waiting for
you. At least piracy has the advantage of being unexpected.

I believe that most sinkings in WWII took place at some distance
from the various shipping ports. In Traveller, thanks to not being
able to track anything in Jumpspace, your commerce raider
is going to have to actually lurk *in* the ports at the 100diam limit
where the military will place most of its pickets/sensor platforms.
The easiest way to protect shipping is to limit their jump points
to a very few and then inundate those points with low-jump
destroyers, SDBs, etc. Jumpspace automatically protects any
ship in it from being detected so I\'d stick with SDB pickets at the
controlled jump points rather than escorts than accompany the
merchants into Jumpspace.

I, too, have finished this book. In summating my opinion I realized that
most of my comments were negative. But, I generally have high standards and
have negative opinions of most popular press SF out there. I was going to
try to moderate this review in light of comparison with comparable books.
However in discussing this with a member of the trade, he railed upon me to
tell it like it is. That there is too much crap out there as it is. People
should not tolerate it or we will always have crap out there. So, I\'m
bowing to his logic. If your tastes in reading material are not high, and
you are please with pure escapist material to kill time, then you will not
find this book as negative as I portray below. If you prefer literature
that challenges social, philosophical, or political issues, presents
intriguing microcosms of human (or alien) behavior, or just plain makes you
think, take it as read.
On to the review...

I have the feeling that they chose the author of this book based on two
criteria:
  a) He\'s published before (that great literary blockbuster "Countdown to
Chaos")
  b) He was cheap
His writing is pedestrian at best. His characters, at best, rise to two
dimensional. The names he chooses are more suited to children\'s fiction
(Mr. & Mrs. Blork, Floogle Berries, ...) The book is one long string of
clichés after another. That latter, in and of itself, isn\'t too bad, as
much of the "feel" of Traveller is 1950s battleships in space. The book is
populated with thick, heavyset bullies, balding, whining officials, and
scheming rogues. There is a police investigator at one point that bears
more than a passing familiarity to Kojack.
  The main character evoked no sympathy in me. I cared not if he lived,
died, became fabulously wealthy, or completely impoverished. He was either
so much more fabulously clever/more skilled than almost everyone he ran
into. If he wasn\'t then they were much more fabulously clever/more skilled
than he. Nothing in between The Problem-PC with the Problem-DM syndrome. I
am reminded of bad-trek fiction. You know the sort where a strong female
character rescues the Enterprise, has sex with Spock, and runs off at the
end fabulously wealthy. Where the author has blatantly inserted themselves
into the plot as the hero whom nothing can touch. I\'d have to review his
other books to be certain of this but I haven\'t that much time to waste.
  An enigma is presented, about two chapters late, that does give you a
slight interest in the story. But at no time was I unable to put the book
down. The plot twists that are presented are totally from left field. Good
authors will drop little clues so that when you hit the turn you think back
(often at a 2nd reading) and go "yeah, I should have seen that". Bad
authors will but up large road signs indicating clearly to all concerned
(except the characters) that the plot is about to twist. This author does
neither. He gives no clue and no warning. It is sort of like being a player
and having the referee suddenly announce "The bomb the Ine Givar planted on
your ship three months ago behind the jefreis tube in your secondary power
plant suddenly explodes."
  As the author relies so much on cliché, not much is spent on descriptive
narrative. As the dialog is canned as well we have to put up a lot with the
introspection of the main character who spends much of his time wistfully
wishing he was in the plot of the next novel (I\'m serious). Much is made of
how boring traveling between the stars (searching for adventure) is. Much
of this boredrum rubs off on the readers. At one point they are
transitioning an uninhabited system (or null point, I wasn\'t sure). Their
sole entertainment was to tune in to distended broadcasts from nearby
stars. They were several years out of date, but it was presented as better
than nothing. The obvious question was well why didn\'t they have recorded
entertainment (like, even an 8-track), or just read books? I guess, though,
that if the author assumes his standard of writing is prevalent in the Far
Future then tuning into radio-last-decade was a more realistic
entertainment option.

  So far I\'ve just talked of the book as a story. Let me discuss it as a
work of _Traveller_.
  There area  number of points where the author departs from established
canon. Some I can forgive under the logic that he wished to create dramatic
situations and so bent the rules. Others were just plain ignorance.
  Aliens. Well, I kind of liked his treatment of Aslan, particularly the
ones without speaking lines. I would have like to seen an Aslan female, and
the distinction between them, portrayed. Given the plot, though, it would
really have just been distracting. K\'kree are introduced as a plot device
sufficiently close to their canonical representation. Vilani (which they
spell at least 3 different ways) are sort of made out as camp fops, which
is a bit odd. One species, the Guy-troy, figures prominently. I _think_
they were covered in a Contact! article, but I\'m not sure. They are, for
the most part, pretty much in line with Traveller minor races.
  Ships. Well, the far trader has meson canons and meson screens. I guess
the author did that for drama. Odd how he readily adopts so many clichés
but can\'t accept laser turrets. He makes it a bit more cramped and grungier
than my floor plans indicate, but I guess he is going for more drama. There
are little "oops"es where they only pull 95% of a jump-2 so as not to
strain the engines, pop into system half a light year short and go the rest
of the way on maneuver drive. !!! My biggest beef, though, is that they
spend as much time worrying about refueling as they do changing the
lemon-scented hand-towels in the staterooms. Fuel, refueling, refined,
unrefined, scooping are such important parts of the Traveller universe that
they should not be left out like that. Sure, you want to move the plot
along, but they should be there as background.
  Setting. Hoo boy. Here we go.
  You could say that Gateway is _nominally_ Milieu-0. Sort of the feel
(insofar as there was ever any _feel_ to Milieu-0). But it could just as
easily be Milieu-1100 in, say, Gateway sector. With a little change to
references to _which_ Imperium they are in it could just as easily be 2nd
Imperium or post-TNE.
  There is no Emperor, no Moot. Just a Ruling Council. Sure, they were weak
emperors or ones that never really impinged on the populace much, and maybe
the author didn\'t like the term "Moot" (although since he was willing to
stoop to expletives such as "Farg" I\'m not sure why). [Hmm, call it post
TNE, the Reformation Coalition (RC) become the Ruling Council (RC).]
  The Imperial military consists solely of the Marines. No other branch is
ever mentioned.
  There is only one MegaCorporation, called a Combine, which is secretly
run by aliens (non-spoiler, it is revealed as soon as it is introduced).
  There is the "Guild" which is sort of like the Spacer\'s Union. Not a bad
addition. There is a system of certifications which is quite logical and
sensible. I had a similar system in my own campaign and you might say it is
implicit in the rules. It is good to make it explicit here as inspiration
for other GMs.
  They have "Universal ID"s, basically programmable ID cards. I\'ve seen
stats on these before but their use in the novel makes it much clearer for
DMs.
  The Traveller\'s Aid Society is never mentioned.
  The Ancients are specifically called Droyne and are extinct. But, I don\'t
have a great problem with this. I can accept the author preferred the name
"Droyne" to the, admittedly, cliched "Ancient". And, in Milieu-0, they
don\'t necessarily know that the Chirpers are related to the modern Droyne
and that either of them are related to the Ancients.

  I could discuss the business sense in releasing it now. What timing might
have been better and any number of could-have-beens that would have made
this a wonderful thing to promote Traveller. But as such has always fallen
on deaf ears before, I\'m not going to waste the bandwidth.

  All in all I found the novel rather hard to rationalise with the normal
Traveller background. But, after a few beers, I think I have found a way to
do so to my satisfaction.
  Gateway should not be considered to be a novel read by modern 20th
century humans portraying events in the Imperium that we know from the
games. Rather it should be seen as a game supplement. It is a near-Future
fiction novel, written in early Milieu-0 and read by our characters in
campaigns. From the perspective of someone living in Milieu-0 the Emporer
might be seen as a passing thing (It\'ll never catch on!), having just got
fusion+ and so forth, surely personal meson turrets and screens were _just_
around the corner, and it would explain all the fictionalised names.

  Cheers,

OK from what I\'ve heard about canon (note that I only have the TNE and MT
rule books) Jump machinery has 1/3 HPG and Zuchai Crystals and either
Lanthanum grids or Lanthanum coils. If Zuchai crystals can store massive
amounts of electricity, i.e. electrons, then that would be a reasonable
location to store the converted hydrogen electrons.

Err... umm... I think I must be out of the loop but TNE misjumps only affect your
time to target and maybe the distance.   Only an aggravated catastrophic failure
results in you ending up in the wrong system.

The usual use for drop tanks is to allow you to do two jumps without refueling,
AND without losing any of your interior cargo space. You don\'t actually drop
your tanks in the jump field, you drain them (charging the capacitors), drop
them, THEN activate the jump field.

So, the procedure for Drop Tanks would be:
1) Fill tanks
2) Burn fuel directly from tanks to jump capacitors
3) Drop the tanks
4) Jump
5) Jump again with internal fuel

The procedure you detailed above seems more akin to what you\'d do with internal
dismountable tanks or collapsible tanks.

Rather than having them actually involved in the war\'s prosecution, have
them get caught up in it.  Hauling refugees, being caught on the ground
when the Zhodani invade, even running the resistance on an occupied world.

Here are some ideas for a single scout ship:

1. Resupply of an advance listening post.  
2. Shadowing Zhodani Fleet movements.
3. Taking out an individual Zho Admiral.
4. Transporting a single, very importanr EPW.
5. Helping Norris recover that pesky Imperial Warrant.

Good point.  I hadn\'t considered the relative differences in the cost of
the ship to the cost of the cargo.  Anybody done any comparisons of the
numbers on this?  How far off of that model are traveller ships?

OTOH, we\'re assuming that the ship doesn\'t carry enough fuel to make two
jumps.  I\'d expect that larger ships would.  I don\'t know all the versions
of the rules.  Is this allowed under all of them?  This makes the odds of a
catastrophic misjump much higher.  Given that a ship which has just
misjumped has the capability of another Jump-1 and that the density of
stars is approx 1/2 per parsec, this gives us the odds that a ship cannot
get to a planet as something like 1 in 4608 jumps (1 in 36 to misjump, 1 in
128 that the target hex and all hexes within Jump-1 are unable to refuel
the ship).  A ship capable of a jump-2 after a misjump has a 1 in 1.2
*billion* chance of being unable to reach a star system 1 in (6^2 *2^25).
These odds make misjumps a problem only for ships which don\'t carry extra
fuel.  I\'d guess that along the mains, the big ships would be required to
do so.

Its the conversion of fuel into energy then dumping the tanks that bothers me. Pumping
the fuel into your tanks after emptying them seems perfectly logical. There is an
extrapolation you can make if you allow that.  i.e. You put a tether from your ship into
a tanker jump using its fuel. The tanker stays behind and you still have a full tank at
the other end.  In fact, you can greatly reduce the size of your ship by eliminating
jump fuel altogether.  Just a jump drive and a hose going to a tanker/tender.  To me,
that\'s a bad bad rule.

I\'ve heard of them but I wasn\'t here when they were discussed. I don\'t have a problem
with tanks, its the conversion/energy storage thing that isn\'t working for me.  Since
I\'m trying to model my jump theory as close to canon as possible, I need to figure out
how drop tanks fit in.

See previous message. Certainly the analogy to stars doesn\'t mean a whole
lot (stars are ludicrously bright compared to the signal you\'d need for
communication, and they\'re omnidirectional and broad-spectrum - very 
inefficient.) (I can\'t believe I\'m arguing about whether stars are
efficient communication devices...)

Anyway...as I  said in an earlier post, a 1-m telescope with a 1-kilowatt
laser can get moderate bandwidth (100 bits per second) at a few parsecs;
a system like that would cost about a million dollars with current
technology. If you put it in space you\'d pick up a factor of a hundred
in bandwidth. 

Radio is somewhat less efficient, but not impossible. I believe an 
Arecbo-sized dish beaming a directional signal can be seen by another
Arecbo out to ~10 parsecs. Arecebo can see the big military over-the-horizon
radars out to several parsecs too. Of course, that\'s somewhat bulky and
expensive, but the data rate could be pretty high.

Very economical indeed.

Another point on the "evidence that the speed of light is c in microgravity" -
when we look at the very distant universe (billions of parsecs) it\'s pretty
clear we\'re seeing a time that was very different than the current epoch - 
more quasars, less well-developed galaxies - indicating that the light took
billions of years to get here.

Crazy Egor\'s does mail order all over the planet, and will cheerfully
place out of print items on a want list for you if they don\'t have a copy;
they will then hunt at conventions, collection purchases, and auctions for
the item, and let you know if they are able to get a copy. I\'ve gotten
some *very* hard to find FASA Star Trek stuff that way, and some OoP
Traveller material as well.

(It helps that I used to work there... :-)

What\'s to prevent this:Freighter runs hose into tanker/tender.
Burns fuel out of tanker.
Withdraws hose.
Falls into jump point.

The Freighter in this instance can perform a jump 6 with NO fuel.  Eliminate
the need for jump fuel and you save 35% of the volume of your ship.

I\'m not saying this is impossible, I\'m saying this falls into the category
of Jump Projectors which arrive around TL 21

Update (my mail system has been off-line for almost a week, or I would
have responded sooner).

Paul has finalized the deal with the new owner of the site (which is now
Milennium Games and Hobbies), and has moved out his product. The new store
will be open as soon as is possible, and right now Paul is (or should be)
setting up for CapCon. Mail Order and Want List are still being handled
(AFAIK), although shipments are probably a *little* delayed.

NB, this force is directed along the line joining the mass element and the
test body.  By symmetry, we can ignore the horizontal component, and must
deal with the vertical one.

Determining the net force on an object a distance f from a disk thickness

  |\\
  | \\
  |o \\
f |   \\
  |    \\ R
  |     \\
  |      \\
  |_______\\
      r

The force on a particle at the top of this triangle caused by a small
particle of mass m on a particle at the top of mass M is

F = G M m/R^2.

or,

F = [integral over all mass] G M R^-2 dm

This force is directed along the line R.  To get the force in the y
direction, that is, along the line joining the object and the center of the
disk, we need to the component of the force along that axis.  This is

Fy = F cos(o).

and

Fy = [integral over all mass] G M R^-2 cos(o) dm

We now need just determine the mass of a small differential element on the
disc, and then integrate over the area of the disc.

To do this, we look at a small volume element.  It has density p, thickness
s, and size dx times dy, if we are in rectangular coordinates, thus

dm = s p dx dy.

Unfortunately, this is not convenient to integrate in.  Instead, we use
polar coordinates r and t.  On a circle, the differential area element is
dr times r dt.  (at a radius r, the distance swept out by a small change of
angle t is r times t, so if we move by dt, we trace out a length r dt.

We express dm in terms of r and theta:

dm = s p r dt dr

and thus

Fy = [integral over all mass] G M R^-2 cos(o) s p r dt dr

At this point, we note that we have cos(o), R, and r in the equation.  This
is a minor problem, as all three of these variables are related by two
identities.  If we take these two identities, we can get an integral with
real limits, instead of the rather unclear "over all mass."

1.  cos(o) = f/R  (Definition of cosine)

2.  R^2 = f^2 + r^2.  (Definition of distance)

Using the first of these:

Fy = [integral over all mass] G M R^-3 f s p r dt dr

Using the second:

Fy = [integral over all mass] G M (r^2 + f^2)^-3/2 f s p r dt dr


Lets pull out the constants: G, M, f, s, p:

Fy = G M f s p ([integral over all mass] r (r^2 + f^2)^-3/2 dt dr )

Noting number 2, we can make the following substitution:

Let u = f^2 + r^2.

du = 2 r dr

Note: r will go from 0 to L, thus u will go from f^2 to f^2 + L^2.

Substituting:

Fy = 0.5 G M f s p [integral over all mass] (u)^-3/2 dt du

Fy = 0.5 G M f s p *
	[Integral from f^2 to f^2+L^2]
		[integral from 0 to 2 Pi]
			u^-3/2 dt du

Do the theta integration which spins us around the disc:

Fy = Pi G M f s p *
	[Integral from f^2 to f^2+L^2]
		u^-3/2 dt

Do the r integral from the center to the edge:

Fy = - 2 Pi G M f s p ( u^-1/2 substituted at f^2+L^2 minus f^2)

or

Fy = - 2 Pi G M f s p ( (f^2+L^2)^-1/2 - (f^2)^-1/2)

or

Fy = 2 Pi G M f s p ( 1/f - f/(f^2+L^2))

or

Fy = 2 Pi G M s p (1 - 1/(f^2+L^2))

If we let L become arbitrarily large, it will send the /(f^2+L^2) term to
zero.

As a result, for an infinite disc, 

Fy = 2 Pi G M s p

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object we are
testing with, s is the thickness of the disc, and p is the density.

On a finite disc, let us put a person of height h at the center.  What is
the tidal force they feel?

deltaFy = F(0)-F(h)

deltaFy = 2 Pi G M s p [ (1 - 1/(L^2)) - (1 - 1/(h^2+L^2)) ]

deltaFy = 2 Pi G M s p [ 1 - 1/(L^2) - 1 + 1/(h^2+L^2) ]

deltaFy = 2 Pi G M s p [ 1/(h^2+L^2) - 1/(L^2) ]

deltaFy = 2 Pi G M s p [ L^2/L^2(h^2+L^2) - (h^2+L^2)/(h^2+L^2)(L^2) ]

deltaFy = 2 Pi G M s p [ (L^2-(h^2+L^2))/(L^2 h^2+L^4) ]

deltaFy = 2 Pi G M s p [ -h^2/(L^2 h^2+L^4) ]

So, L is going to almost certainly dominate h, and thus the tidal force is
proportional roughly to the h^2/L^4, so any L even remotely large w.r.t h
is going to cause the tidal forces to be insignificant, compared to the
rather large constant force you will be feeling form the disc.

As an example, assume we are standing on an iron disc 7000 kilometers
thick.  I am not quite 2m tall, and weight (mumble) kilos.  For the sake of
calculation, lets just use 1 kg.

G = 6.67e-11
p = 7.87 g/cc = 7870 kg/m^3.
s = 7e6

Plug in the numbers

Fy = 2 Pi 6.67e-11 1 7e6 7870 = 7.35 N.

This is pretty fierce.  This disc is producing on the order .7 gs.

And now the tides?

h = 2
L = 2 meters (on a 7000 km thick disc!)
deltaFy = 7.35 [ -h^2/(L^2 h^2+L^4) ]

If we assume our finite disc is, say, just 2 meters wide, so we are on top
of a very thin, very tall cylinder, we get:

deltaFy = 7.35 [ -2^2/(2^2 2^2+2^4) ]

deltaFy = 7.35 [ -4/(4*4+16) ]

deltaFy = 7.35 [ -4/(32) ]

deltaFy = 7.35 [ -.125 ] = .91875, or just under .1 gravs.

This looks noticeable, but notice that we are about as far into the edge
effect region as we can get.  Try this with a disc which is only as wide as
it is thick:

h = 2
L = 3.5e6 (Diameter = 7e6, and radius is half that.)
deltaFy = 7.35 [ -h^2/(L^2 h^2+L^4) ]

deltaFy = 7.35 [ -2^2/((3.5e6)^2 2^2+(3.5e6)^4) ]

deltaFy = 7.35 [ -4/(1.225e13 *4 + 1.5e26) ]

deltaFy = 29.4/1.5e26

deltaFy = 2e-25

Or totally insignificant.  That L^4 term means that edge effects die down
very, very quickly.  As a result, as soon as you let L get substantial
w.r.t h, you get a uniform field.  If h is large w.r.t l, then this looks
like a point source.

The question becomes what the conditions inside the vessel are if they use
AG in this way.

If, however, they are using uniform G fields to produce these effects, then
it is good to know how the tides behave inside your ship near the grav plates.

The above demonstrates that if the grav plates generate an even remotely
uniform field, edge effects can be ignored.  Especially if they can pinch
the field edges to minimize edge effects, or if they extend it a few meters
beyond the ship\'s hull.

How does this break canon?  HG v2 specifically stated that you could fit your 
ship with \'L-Hyd tanks\'.  Specifically, this is on Pg 27.  Cost was 10KCr & 
1Kcr/ton of fuel carried by the tanks.  The cost of the tankage & insulation 
per se, IMTU, was the 1Kcr cost, the 10KCr was the cost of the high speed one 
shot pumps, power connectors, etc.  Since the tanks had negligible \'gravity\' 
and density when sucked bone dry, you just needed to ditch them a few seconds 
from jump in order for the jump field to not bring the tanks or portions 
thereof along for the ride.

Weird thot:  Howbout a chance that the tanks aren\'t quite \'cleared\' when the 
field snaps up, bringing some of the tank along for the ride to smack into the 
back of the ship a week later when it starts decellerating to come to port.

Pumping the fuel into your tanks after emptying them seems perfectly logical. 
There is an extrapolation you can make if you allow that.  i.e. You put a tether 
from your ship into a tanker jump using its fuel. The tanker stays behind and 
you still have a full tank at the other end.  In fact, you can greatly reduce the 
size of your ship by eliminating jump fuel altogether.  Just a jump drive and a 
hose going to a tanker/tender.  To me, that\'s a bad bad rule.

IIRC, several of the people in the earlier discussion were using tanker & hose

in any jump, which struck many as nonsense (due to the conversion/storage problem
you mention above) but was, regardless, Canon.

Canon allows drop tanks. You can easily disallow them, especially if how jump drive
works IYTU makes them impossible. You\'re going to have to accept them if you want
your jump space theory to match canon.

Hmmmmmm, I hadn\'t considered that.  Interesting point.  This would seem
to make freighters more profitable, though it could leave you stranded. 
Ok, using the earlier comments by others about the presence of mass near
the jump point, if the mass near the jumping ship is more than negligable
(that is, more than that of an empty fuel tank) the jump point becomes
unstable, and will at best badly misjump the freighter, and at worst
destroy the freighter and the tanker.  The drop tanks must be no larger
than required for a single  jump, no more than half the maximum jump
capability of the vessel, or jump 1, whichever is more.  The tanks will
probably be burst by the stresses placed on them by the jump point\'s
opening and closing.  Now note, this still allows a ship to haul its jump
fuel in drop tanks, saving cargo space, but prevents large tankers and
re-fueling stations from being used this way.  This will make the
freighter\'s more profitable, while entering some risk in the process. 
Naval vessels, Free traders, player\'s ships, and lots of others will
still need to carry their own fuel, since they may not be able to get a
drop tank wherever their going.  As a side note, IIRC, in 2300 AD ships
that used MHD generators could also carry a fuel reconditioner (I can\'t
remember the actual term) that allowed spent fuel (i.e. O2 and H2 burned
into water) to be broken down, and re-used, with some losses.  The
reconditioning was usually run by solar panels.

Yup.  To a very specific point in interstellar space.  And the ship made a 
perfect jump, coming out to within a kilometer of the portal AIR.

Also, in The Traveller Adventure book, spare tankage was installed in the 
ship\'s cargo hold to allow it 2xJ1 in order to allow it to go off the Spinward 
Main, said jumps were made into interstellar space, the tanks were pumped into 
the main fuel tanks, the drive checks were made, and the ship jumped again.  
And during the tradewar segment of the adventure, a rendezvous point that 
Tukera Lines used was in deep space to avoid the nosey eyes of customs 
inspectors.

In one game I was in, we used a set of drop tanks to do something similar.  
The tanks were made for 2 jump-2\'s worth of fuel for the combined ship/tank 
configuration.  We jump-2\'ed to the spot, detatched the half-empty tanks, set 
a radio beacon on them, took some *VERY* careful position and vector readings 
(about a day\'s worth to get 15 decimal point accuracy), then jump-3\'d to the 
target system on full tanks.  Coming back, we revered the process.  Only took 
us 2 days to get to the tanks, and it saved us 4 weeks time.

Now plug in the numbers for the starship simulation. Density comparable to black
hole, Length = 51 meters (much longer for capital ships). Thickness of disk would
be a few meters (placing the gravity field "close" to the front of the ship.)

Arbitrarily strange... The big problem is that if you generate a gravity field,
that field decreases in strength inversely with the square of the distance.
However, at distance=0 the field strength approaches infinity, which would
collapse anything at the gravity source.  Which requires that you put your gravity
source sufficiently far away that the tidal forces aren\'t too noticable. This ends
up being outside the ship. Which would pull the ship as well, leaving you back in
zero G\'s.  Unless you put a balancing gravity field on the other side to keep the
ship stationary, while pulling on the crew closer to one of the fields. This puts
an even greater tidal pull on the ship, but the ship can arbitrarily take it. This
is in effect using the spin habitat theory with gravity instead of centrifugal
force.

Misjumps, in my traveller universe and yours, need not be
frequent nor fatal.

I assumed that jumps take between 5 and 9 days, with 7 being
at the center of the bell curve.  However, misjumps or 
dangerously out-of-tune drives can take 10, 11, and more
days.  The referee can use that as a warning also.  "You
emerged out of jump after 13 days."  "13 DAYS?  Sounds like
our jump drive is about to go kaput."

I always assumed (I\'m not sure why) that ships running with
refined fuel will not misjump unless the referee decides to
impose a misjump.

I then assumed that ships running on unrefined fuel had that
1 in 36 chance of misjump, but also a greater probability of
other things going wrong:

roll	event		action			cost
8	noise		systems check		none
9	noise		minor repairs		2d6 x Cr100   
10	jolt		minor replacements	2d6 x Cr1000   
11	fire		repair + replacement	2d6 x Cr10,000  
12	misjump		major repairs		2d6 x Cr100,000 

The Empty Hexes

Just suppose your crew jumps into an empty hex.  What will you
do?  The ship has no fuel; no fuel, no jump.  So something needs
to be tried.

The referee can expand this into a nail-biting scenario.  Jury-rig
system components to scan the hex for ice chunks, comets, whatever
possible to get a little bit of fuel.  Jumpstart the jump drive 
with less-than-enough fuel, use impossuble engineering feats to
get it to jump (or even misjump!) one more time, with the 
possibility of scrapping the drive system permanently.

60%.  10% per jump number, remember?  And you\'d *still* need a bit of fuel for 
the power plant even if it\'s just to keep the lights on so you don\'t stub your 
foot on something after dinner in jumpspace.  So, you wouldn\'t go *without* 
fuel, you just wouldn\'t take *all* of it with you.

There\'s also nothing in the Book 1/ High Guard / MegaTraveller rules that prohibit it, either.  Except, of course, you\'d be stuck in the new system unless there\'s a tanker or drop tanks to get you home again.  This makes the system practical *only* for designated routes and you\'d better love sex, cause if you misjump into deep space, yer screwed bigtime, comrade.

Here\'s a thought.  Fire up the manuever drives and put the crew into the
emergency low berths.  What happens when they arrive back in port after

FFS only says that drop tanks can be released once empty.  It made no mention of special gear

Drop tanks are fine.  Blowing your wad all at once bothers me. Thus I can accept the
canonical fact that drop tanks exist, but I\'m still not sure that the implementation is
kosher.

Ship adventures:

Run desparately needed supplies into a besieged system
Run commandos or resistance cadre into a system
Take wealthy refugees/nobles/merchants etc. away from the combat zone

Run critical supplies to industrial areas (sabateur aboard?)
Ship commandeered for humanitarian reasons (taking surplus of wounded back to
rear area hospitals?  poor refugees? etc...)
Ship commandeered for military reasons (taking POWs to holding areas, running
supplies, etc...)

ship arrives insystem when commerce raiders strike.
Ship is in system when Zho Battle force strikes

Character adventures:
Oops, wrong place at the wrong time.  Sky is full of Zhos.  Here\'s a gun,
there\'s a foxhole.
Characters stumble across a Zhodani sabatage plot.
Characters discover a Vargr advance scout - before it sends back critical data
on system defenses.
Characters discover a Noble who is making money on the black market - with
critical defense supplies (food, medicine, etc - the joy is in trying to accuse
a Noble before his peers...)

These are just bare plot lines, but that is usually what I take into a game with
me.  I tend to be very off the cuff, mostly because my players tend to surprise
me with the avenues of thought they develop!

Hope this helps!

I\'ve got a character on this basis.  Jumped into a system with no means of
refueling, the whole crew took to the low births powered by solar collectors.
A thousand years later she was rescued, hers was the only low birth that hadn\'t
failed.

Drop tanks are fine.  Blowing your wad all at once bothers me. Thus I can accept the

kosher.

Won\'t work. Power plant fuel (which is also maneuver drive fuel) lasts 30 days.
After that the low berths run out of power and everybody dies.

The only problem with this is that you then only need to use a tanker with
a (potentially disposable) fuel hose several hundred meters long. If the
fuel hose gets scragged, you\'re out a few 100 credits, a small price to
pay for the ability to carry *lots* more cargo. 

I honestly don\'t have any problem with ships being able to do this. PC
ships won\'t do this, because on the marginal trade routes you won\'t always
be able to guarantee there\'s a tanker on both ends.  Also, if you misjump
using this method, you die, since you can\'t refuel (though a good option
at that point it to have collapsible tanks stored in the cargo hold). 

Still, this is more an option for megaships going between A & B starports,
since D & E starports simply won\'t have such tankers, and many C class
ports won\'t either.  I\'ve always assumed trade between A & B class ports
was basically run only by megacorps anyway.  This basically turns
tanker-based fueling into local color with no direct effect on the PCs. 
Why not allow it? 

On another, equally important note, PCs will never rely on tanker
refueling because using it makes it impossible to flee the planet just
ahead of the authorities or during an emergency (when the tankers will all
be servicing more important ships). 

As for jump projectors, the descriptions of them said that they operate at
range.  The ship doesn\'t need a jump drive either (*dramatically* lowering
ship-building costs) and it can be jumped at up to several 1,000 km away
(which has no real trading use, but makes a powerful weapon). 

At TL 21 megaships become shells with maneuver drives and really big cargo
holds. 

Regarding misjumps, that\'s one of the most *seriously* broken and outright
*stupid* rules in T4.  According to CT and MT, misjumps were impossible if
the ship was beyond 100 diameters, was using refined fuel (or was refining
its own fuel) and was up on its maintenance.  Having a normal 1 in 36
misjump chance as a part of normal operation is just silly.

    'body' => 'Joe\'s post implies that you could have a ship that has only
a jump drive, but doesn\'t even need fuel, as long as you have
a launch platform with a fuel pump of some kind.  I have
some observations to make about this interesting point.

1. Drop tanks were experimental in the late 1000s, and were
   finally useful starting in the 1100s (or is that 1080s?).
   It took a couple decades or 3 before the innovation was
   marketed.

2. Fuelless designs would only be used between safe, well-
   built-up star systems -- say, some of the mains in the
   established sectors of the Imperium.  Noone would dare
   use them in the Spinward Marches... it\'s just too backwater,
   IMTU.

3. "Modern" Xboat systems, or rennovated systems, could take
   full advantage of this "feature" eventually, greatly
   increasing carrying capacity and perhaps starting up some
   kind of UPS service.  It would probably be a couple decades 
   after the innovation takes root commercially that this would be
   tried.  So, say the core Xboat system would start renovating
   itself around the year 1130... in the GURPS Imperium, of
   course.

4. Fuel prices for this pump-and-jump innovation (refined only)
   would be high.  Let\'s set it at Cr1000 per ton, a mere factor
   of 2.  Or we could use the same factor as that between 
   unrefined and refined fuel, i.e.

	fuel			Cr/ton
	unrefined		 100
	refined			 500
	refined pump-and-jump	2500

   Ouch!  Corporations would have company platforms, of course.

The 30 day rating is at normal consumption.  Since low berths are
designed for emergency situations, it makes sense that they could
operate in a low-power mode.

<Puzzled look>
The TNE Gazelle can jump-5 (sans tanks) with 1260 kL of fuel.  It can store 1450 kL
internally.  Did they REALLY change the rules that much?

I don\'t know about the new rules, but I wouldn\'t take the Gazelle as
a pointer to earlier design rules.  If memory serves it carries a
particle accelerator barbette, and High Guard rules didn\'t allow
barbettes on ships of less than 1000 tons...

- ----
IMPROVED TASK SYSTEM FOR TRAVELLER
- ----

1:  STATS are added to the task roll at full value.
     STATS are modifiers that improve the task roll.

     EX:  If you have a 7 Dex, then you add 7 points to your roll.  If
     you are wounded, and your
     Dex is lowered to 5, then you only add 5 points to the roll.


2:  SKILLS give you DICE to roll on a task.

     EX:  If you have Pistol-2, you add 2 six siders to the roll.


3:  DIFFICULTY is a set of numbers as used in MT.

     EX:         Difficulty          Difficulty Numbers
                    ----
                    Very Easy                        5
                    Easy                                10
                    Average                          15
                    Difficult                          20
                    Formidable                     30
                    Staggering                       31+


       *difficulty numbers and difficulty categories are for illustration
purposes only.
         I have done no number crunching to support these values.
         I am only trying to explain the concept.



HERE\'S AN EXAMPLE OF PLAY:

       Billy the Gunfighter
       DEX 7
       Pistol-2

Billy wants to fire his weapon at a bad guy.  He gets to roll 3D6+7.
Range to the target will determine difficulty.

Range to the target is medium for the weapon.  Let\'s say that works out
to be a average roll (again, these numbers and difficulties are for
illustration only.  I\'m selling concept here, not a finished task
system).

Billy needs to roll 16+ to hit his target (he needs to beat the 15
target number).

He rolls 3D6+7.  He gets 1 D6 die because even the unskilled have a shot
at something.  He gets 2 D6 from his skill level.  And, he gets the 7
point modifier because of his Dex.

He rolls.  If he rolls over 15, he hits the target.  If he rolls below
the target number, he misses.



HERE\'S HOW OTHER TASK CONCEPTS WILL FIT INTO THIS SYSTEM:
(all numbers below are for illustration only)

SPECTACULAR SUCCESS:  If Bill rolls 10 points over the target number, he
achieves SS.

SPECTACULAR FAILURE:  If Bill rolls 10 points below the target number,
he rolls a SF.

FATE DIE:  The first die Bill gets (not the 2 dice from his skill) is a
fate die.  This should be a different color from the rest.  If a 6 is
rolled on this die, he gets to roll the die again, adding to his total,
making it easier for him to roll SS.  If a 1 is rolled on this die, the
highest die from his roll is subtracted from the total, making it easier
for him roll SF.



WHAT DOES THIS TASK SYSTEM DO FOR TRAVELLER?

1.  It\'s very easy to learn and explain, as I have shown here.

2.  It works well within the Traveller genre.  People can see exactly
what their character\'s skills and attributes bring to the table.

3.  It resolves the STAT vs. SKILL debate with the T4 rules.

4.  It makes that pesky half die a thing of the past.  It is a moot
point now.

5.  It only uses 6 sided die--a prerequisite for Traveller in my book.

6.  It fits flawlessly into the existing Traveller character generation
system.

7.  All T4 rules will be an easy conversion to this system for a new
rule book.

8.  There is no multiplication or division (the KISS system, Keep It
Simple Stupid).

9.  Since STATS are added to the roll as modifiers, it is not a problem
to adjust a roll because the character is wounded.

10.  It would be easy to convert all of the work you have done with T4.1
to this system, and I believe that this system is superior to the one
currently used in T4.1.

So this is allowed because its a "rare event" but my jump theory doesn\'t
because it\'s time discrepancies in "rare events" (InSystem jumps and jumps to
empty space) aren\'t a week?  Hmm... I\'m feeling a double standard here...

I didn\'t know the jump projectors only worked out to thousand km... I thought
they sent you off to another system. I only saw a vague reference to them in
the MT rules, never saw the specifics.

I will add that TNE misjumps still put you in the right system (except for
aggravated catastrophic failures) They just screw up the timing and possibly
put you outside the 100 diameter limit. MT misjumps do a similar thing, but
there\'s a chance for ship destroyed.

Did T4 REALLY change the rules THAT much?

One approach would be to require the jump fuel to be consumed in a very,
very, very short time (making it difficult to work with a hose of any length),
and to introduce a significant chance that if anything is within a few hundred
meters of a ship going into jump Bad Things happen to the object (though
not to the ship) a small percentage of the time - tolerable Bad Things for a 
drop tank, but not for an (expensive, manned) tanker.

Also, operationally, especially for moderate-jump traffic it\'s not clear that
the tanker approach really would save you money, since it adds considerable
time and fiddling to rendezvous with the tanker, synchronize everything, etc. 
For comparison - one could save a considerable amount of weight (5-10%)
in modern airliners if they took off with nearly-empty fuel tanks and then
used mid-air refuelling to top up (you save landing gear weight and engine
lifetime.) However, it\'s hardly worth the extra complexity. Similarly, although
multi-stage rockets have enormous mass fraction advantages, it\'s generally
thought that even a huge, inefficient single-stage-to-orbit vehicle will be
much cheaper in the long run because you don\'t have to reassemble it after
every trip. These will probably restrict drop tanks to specialized long-haul
applications. (They\'re great for military use, though.)

These days (TNE and T4) power plants generally have about a years worth of
fuel onboard. Since the low berths take very little power compared to everything
else, this generally means that they can be run for thousands of years. 
You can\'t run the maneuver drive this long, of course...though (also T4) 
maneuver drives don\'t work well in free space/empty hexes. Best bet is to 
use the laser comm (or a laser turret) to send a signal to a nearby system
and then climb in the low berths. IMTU (if I had a TU, which I don\'t) 
a major duty for the ISS is running automatic monitor stations in every
system, which look for laser comm signals and record them for when they
get checked by a passing scout (including detached-duty scouts), which can
then go perform a rescue or find a bigger ship for a rescue. 

I still agree that T4\'s 1-in-36 per normal jump misjump rate is a mistake,
though.

Only corporations would run the fuelless ships, although they might
sublet their fuel.  But if the corporation ships unrefined fuel (water
or skimmed gas) to the refueling platform, then refines it there, they
could easilly get by with a marginal increase in price.  They\'re
already  getting free fuel or a multiple of 5 if they buy it.  I\'d maybe
charge for the severed hose. X5 is prohibitively expensive.

Here\'s another possibility and gross abortion of the drop  tank theory.
If you can convert that much matter that fast, what\'s to prevent people
from using it as a weapon. Situation: Ship drops tube into gas giant,
sucks off the atmosphere converting it into energy which is then focused
at enemy. Yes, it is unrefined, but you\'re not jumping so there\'s no
chance for a misjump. Now all that raw power gets directed into a planet
busting weapon.

yeah, but the question was regarding the rule in the T4 rulebook, which is
BROKEN.

Misjumps _used_ to mostly be(in increasing rarity) anywhere from extra or
fewer days in jumpspace, followed by jump drives being
damaged, to jump drives being destroyed, to popping off 1d6*6 random
hexes, to simply vanishing forever.

Agreed, the level of failure as stated in the rulebook is unusably high.

That does make sense. However, I find it difficult to believe that a low-power mode
would enable the low berths to be operationals for the many decades it would take to
reach a solar system.

It has long been a favorite tactic of some TMLers (myself included) to
rapidly cycle a ship\'s gravity from zero to maximum Gs when dealing
with unwanted boarders/stowaways. The higher the G-comp rating of
the ship the more dangerous for intruders this becomes. Of course,
getting out the dents can be a bit of work.

For those campaigns in which the grav generators can\'t do this or
would be damaged, a more acceptable way would be to turn the
G-comp off for the "compromised" area(s) and let the ship\'s pilot
indulge himself for about 5 minutes.

Nope. The field from the plate doesn\'t *have* an inverse square
component. That\'s what I\'ve been trying to tell you! Until you get far
enough away that edge effects start to interfere, the gravity is
*constant* regardless of distance.

No it won\'t. And infinite plane (so we can ignore edge effects), has a
field of the form:

	A=k*G*Density*thickness

Note that there is *no* factor for the distance from the plane. From
the surface to infinity the acceleration due to gravity is the same.

Nope. Work it out, you have to sum the contribution of each point in
the plane, and when you do, it turns out that the contributions add up
to the same amount regardless of distance!

I don\'t recall enough calculus to run through the problem, but it\'s a
first year calculus problem, just like showing that the net attraction
inside a hollow sphere is zero, and that the attraction inside a solid
sphere drops off linearly with the distance from the surface as you
approach the center.

With an infinite plane, there *aren\'t* any tidal forces.

Again, only from a *point* source. By using multiple sources in the
proper arrangement, you can arbitrarily reduce tidal forces (check Dr.
Robert Forward\'s article on antigravity in his book "Indistinguishable
From Magic" for several design of tidal compensators)

Six point sources arranged properly will cancel tidal forces
*completely* over a volume.

If it\'s braced well (say with diamond) you would be able to get a
*very* noticeable field, and it would be uniform over a reasonable
volume. 

The inverse square law applies to *point* sources. Calculus shows that
a sphere of uniform density can be treated as if all its mass was
concentrated at the center. So can a sphere composed of spherical
shells of differing but uniform density. 

But with multiple sources, it\'s possible to achieve an aribtrarily
uniform field over an arbitary volume of space. 

The example of an infinite plane is merely the easiest case to
calculate.

Of course you could try desparate measures.  You start
the ship on a vector that will get you to the nearest
habitated system.  You then get the computer to, after
all are in the low berths, to open the ship to turn cool
the whole ship with liquid hydrogen as you turn the reactor
off.  You then hope the cold of space keeps you
frozen and some very good doctors to revive you if and
when you are arrive at the system and are found.

Traveller ships have most of their costs locked up in the hull. Historical
16th/17th ships had crew costs as a much higher percentage of operating
revenue than Traveller ships do (ref Andrews \'Elizabethan Privateering\').

The question is it cheaper to tie up 10-20% of your cargo space up as
reserve tankage, or to make money freighting cargo in that space and buy
misjump insurance ?

Finally, to get on one of my favorite soapboxes, I believe the Long Night
was caused by a rise in misjump chances. This blew the financial system out
of whack, as far more ships and cargos were lost than the insurers could
cover. The higher misjumps led to interstellar trade, transport and travel
becoming less popular, and the Long NIght took hold.

Once misjump chances went back to normal, everyone realised that star
travel was profitable again, and went back to building starships.

I don\'t know about most, but a distribution map I saw last month (can\'t
remember where) showed the largest clusters along the Eastern Seaboard.
The run from Texas around Florida was particularly dangerous. German
U-Boats used to wait for ships to be siloetted against against a city\'s
lights and sink them, then vanish before the Navy could respond. (The
British Admiralty was aghast that American never enforced coastal
blackouts when it was costing them ships - at one time more ships were
being lost off the coast than in the middle of the Atlantic!) Also,
coastal convoys weren\'t implemented for quite a while, and not completely
at all.

As in Traveller, there are many routes a convoy could take across the
ocean, but relatively few in the more restricted coastal waters. Add in
nice spotting conditions, and it was good hunting.

So you\'re saying that this plane will accelerate the universe towards it?  If
gravity doesn\'t drop off, then you\'ve just accelerated the universe... that seems
slightly less than possible.

Actually I did. I can\'t give you the exact formula but since all points yielded
higher gravity at D than at D+L then the sum would be greater.  However as the
plane reaches infinity, that sum approaches infinite.  Since both sums would
approach infinity then (technically) both D and D+L would accelerate to the plane
at infinite speed. I don\'t think this was the intention.  I think the intention was
to generate a finite acceleration on point D which would be equal to the finite
acceleration on point D+L.

First off, let me STRESS that this new task system I\'ve proposed for
Traveller is not finalized.  I based it on the Star Wars D6 system, and I do
think it will work well with Traveller.

BUT, (and this is a BIG BUT), I haven\'t done any play testing with the
system and I haven\'t done any analysis on the target numbers.  I just took
these from Star Wars.

What needs to be done to finish the system?

The target numbers for the difficulties need to be looked at for Traveller.
This task system is a combination of Traveller ideals and the D6 system
(which borrows heavily from Traveller too--so it\'s a two-way relationship).

If you get the target numbers worked out, I think this task system will be
perfect for T4.1.

I took it from Star Wars\' Wild Die.  It adds a lot to the game--mainly
making it possible for SS and SF to be thrown.  The way it stands, it is
very hard to throw these.

Take it out if you don\'t like it, and just throw straight dice (but if you
do that, you may want to adjust the SS/SF rules).

in its jump drive, and can completely burn its fuel

then jettisoned. The decrease in tonnage for the ship
results in greater efficiency, and the ship can jump
farther (J-6). Additional fuel tankage within the ship
allows maneuver, but the tanks must be replaced before
the ship can again jump."

At a high enough intensity (several Tesla) even water is affected by
magnetic fields. That\'s how they did the "levitating frog" bit that

This is a mathematical construct and would be impossible to build for
a number of reasons... this being one of them.  Actually, what it would
do is accelerate everything toward it and it would accelerate toward
everything.  Momentum would still be conserved.  I\'m not sure, though,
how something with infinite mass would exist much less move.  Anyway,
these theoretical constructs aren\'t useful if taken literally.  What\'s
more useful is how it approximates a real life situation.  I have no
idea where this started, but the infinite plate model is useful anytime
you have a sheet of something and you are concerned with how the sheet\'s
gravity affects objects which are a) much smaller than the sheet and
b) much closer to the sheet itself than the edges.  In these cases,
the gravitational field will be essentially uniform.  As you get
closer to the edges or you get further away, the sheet will act more
like a point mass.

If you did not get a uniform gravity field for an infinite sheet, then
you did the math wrong.  This is a well known example and the result isn\'t
really in question.  An infinite sheet doesn\'t have infinite gravity, it
has a gravity as expressed above.

Noted.  I think 640x400 (EGA res) should work OK, and there are
reports that 80x25 (text-only <g>) is acceptable.  Smaller than
640x400 is likely to be problematical.

This is a mathematical construct and would be impossible to build for
a number of reasons... this being one of them.  Actually, what it would
do is accelerate everything toward it and it would accelerate toward
everything.  Momentum would still be conserved.  I\'m not sure, though,
how something with infinite mass would exist much less move.  Anyway,
these theoretical constructs aren\'t useful if taken literally.  What\'s
more useful is how it approximates a real life situation.  I have no
idea where this started, but the infinite plate model is useful anytime
you have a sheet of something and you are concerned with how the sheet\'s
gravity affects objects which are a) much smaller than the sheet and
b) much closer to the sheet itself than the edges.  In these cases,
the gravitational field will be essentially uniform.  As you get
closer to the edges or you get further away, the sheet will act more
like a point mass.

Well, you did the math wrong.  An infinite plate generates a uniform
gravitational field.  The easiest proof to find is to look up the
electric field for a plate of uniform charge.  Since both fields vary
inversely as the square of the distance the result will be the same.
Most college physics texts will have the solution to the plane charge
though they don\'t usually discuss gravity of plane masses.

I think I see what the problem is... At a given distance from a plate, all points
will have the same (uniform) charge/gravity.  But I\'m talking about two points at
different distances.

The gravitational field is constant at all points, no matter where they
are located with respect to the plane.  The ship would experience no
tidal forces because all parts of it would be in the same field.  The
distance from the plate is not a factor...  It\'s a counterintuitive
result, but it\'s true.

Assume we need to travel 1 parsec to get to a launch spot.
That\'s 3.08* 10^16m
Our 1G drive acceleration is 10m/s^2
The time formula isT=2(sqrt(D/A))
If we could accelerate constantly, we would accelerate halfway there and
then slow down.  We can\'t due to fuel restrictions and lightspeed
restrictions, so we\'ll look at a different approach.  We accelerate for 15
days, put everything into emergency shutdown mode except one sensor and the
low berths, which are in an extremely low power consumption mode.  16 light
minutes from the destination, breaking initiates.  Using Newtonian physics
(there may be some advantage to going a mesurable fraction of lightspeed),
you should arrive 754 years after departure.  Knowing that this is a bad
idea, you may choose to acclerate for 30 days and hope they can slow you
down when you get there, 377 years later.

If you pull 6Gs for 30 days, you can get there in under 63 years.

I\'m back to saying that the added expense or emergency fuel is not
unreasonable in all except the smallest of ships.  Insurance is all well
and good for shippers, but the crew isn\'t going to fly them if they expect
to die in them.

Now here\'s a thought: If the chance of misjump is as high as stated and
there are many ships travelling in an area, it might be worthwhile for
individuals to start a career as a salvage crew.  If a ship is more than 2
months late, listed as missing, presumed misjumped, go looking in all the
empty hexes for it.  Carry fuel for three jumps and a prize crew. Check
each hex and take home ships.

If any jump has a 1 in 36 chance of misjump, and any hex within 6 has a 1
in 36 chance of being the destination of a misjump, then one in 1296 jumps
from starting point \'A\' will be to a particular empty hex.  If a starport
has one launch a week for the past 100 years, there will be 4 derelics

Not rare at all, I\'d expect their use to be *very* common between large,
well travelled Class A ports.  However, I don\'t see their use having much
of an impact on PC ships (other than reinforceing the fact that small
trading vessels have no hope of making a living trading between large
Class A & B ports).  However, out on the fringes among the Class C & D
ports I\'d expect jump tankers to be a rare sight indeed.

In MT there were TL 21 ship to ship weapons, you used them to force an
enemy ship to jump, or even misjump.  I\'d expect jump projectors which
worked at much shorter range (like <100 meters) and with a longer warm-up
time (ie not useful as weapons to be several TL lower. 

MT jump dampers either protected you from these things, or even prevented
enemy ships from jumping (again at considerable range).

IIRC, gravplates in CT/MT could go fro zero to 2G\'s.  And a smart engineer. 
with a bit of tinkering, could probably make them reverse polarity.  Thus, you 
could concieveably get a \'pingpong\' effect:  2G slam into the ceiling, 
followed by a 2G slam into the floor, repeat as necessary.  Now you know why 
everybody heads for Engineering first, and THEN to the bridge when they board.

And speaking from experience, bones won\'t dent metal plates unless they\'re 
tissue-paper thin.  The problem won\'t be getting the dents out, it\'ll be 
cleaning up the debris and *maybe* repainting a bit.

Everybody\'s in a low berth, so you don\'t *need* power to life support, the 
gravity plates, ad nauseum.  That extends your power plant fuel to start with. 
 How much energy does running just the low berths in idle mode cost, 
especially when they\'re not having to fight against room temp?  I\'d bet, not 
much at all.  A 10% energy comsumption rate with everything powered down 
except the low berths would extend the 30 days\' fuel to 300 days, which is in 
the realm of reason, and I\'m guessing that even 10% needed power is a bit high.

Now, if you accellerate toward the target system for a day or 2, you\'ll dome 
up with a reasonably decent delta vee.  Don\'t want it *TOO* high, but you 
don\'t want to just stand still.  And if your ship has fuel scoops, and your 
engineer\'s good enough, you can *concieveably* refuel the ship by scooping up 
all those lone hydrogen atoms in interstellar space.  IIRC, there\'s something 
on the order of *one* hydrogen atom in every cubic centimeter in interstellar 
space, and ramscoop speeds are on the order of 1000 km/sec.  It\'s concieveable 
that, given a couple of *YEARS* at this speed, you can get enough fuel into 
your tanks to do a microjump that would put you that much closer to the target 
system.

You\'re coming up with a design that will burn *TRILLIONS* of tons of hydrogen 
at once?  It\'d be cheaper to just drop 1 MT tactical nukes at 1 km intervals 
across the surface of the planet.

*AND* you\'d get a nifty light show to boot...

Which makes perfect sense, since it seems the best way for a PC ship to make 
any *REAL* money would be to work the fringes.

The rules also state that the ship doing the jump projecting has to burn the 
fuel or otherwise get the energy to make the target jump, perhaps by absorbing 
fire in its black globes.  This makes jump projectors, IMNSFBHO, a \'one-shot\' 
desperation weapon.  Why make somebody just \'disappear\' when you can just go 
for the kill and be done with it once and for all?  Since you have to carry 
the fuel, you lose out on any other weapons that you *COULD* be carrying, 
since you no longer have the space for them.  And if you use *YOUR* internal 
jump fuel, you\'re *STUCK* there until you either win or get destroyed.  Not 
exactly sane tactics, again, IMNSFBHO.  In any case, *SOMEBODY* has to \'pay\' 
for the jump.  TANSTAAFL is preserved.

Jump dampers I can see, in a tactical sense.  Why let the enemy escape to come back and kick yer ass another day?  But still, do the weight and cost of these puppies outweigh their usefulness?  I think so.  Personally, I\'ll spend my money on conventional weapons and screens.

There\'s a diagram *and* explanation in Forward\'s book. The technique is
already in use for work in space that needs *real* zero g, not merely
the "microgravity" that\'s what you normally get over a finite volume in
orbit.

I\'m not about to try reproducing the drawings with ASCII graphics.

Well, since a infinite plane is impossible, this is merely a example of
what would happemn if you could do it. But finite planes have the same

If that\'s the result you got, you made a mistake.

Nope. It\'s a converging series. For example, try summing the series 1,
1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, .... 2^-n. It sums to *2*, not to infinity, even
though there are an infinite number of values.

This is wrong *because* your previous assumption is wrong. The sums add
to a *finite* value.

EGA is 640x350 (I know because I\'m in the process of setting up a
couple of old EGA systems). 640x400 is "base" VGA resolution. 640x480
is SuperVGA. 

Of course, that 640x400 is only with 16 colors! That\'s the best VGA can
do. You want 256 colors, you drop to 320x200 (or the weird 360x240 mode).
Everything else is SuperVGA.

I have already ran that campaign on a slightly different note....  I had my
PC crews go into the war sectors immediatly after battles in the FFW and
start salvage operations.  They were under contract from the Imperial Navy
though and only got to claim 10% of the value as their bounty.  I\'ll post
more on that some other time.  Made for some interesting encounters to say
the least (and they seemed to be able to upgrade a number of things on their
ship that they couldn\'t really afford.)

I think that too much is being read into the 1 in 36 chance of a mis-jump.
The bulk of the mus-jumps will only effect the number of days you are in
jump space.  Another large percentage will be where you come out in the hex
you were jumping to.  I would dare say that it is the 1-1-1 on the 3 d6 that
give you  a REAL mis-jump or a 1 in 216 (I think) of this happening.  Just
my tenth of a credit\'s worth of input.

   This is a consequence of going to a reaction-fuel model for 
maneuver drives in TNE and the drop in jump fuel requirements from 
MT.  Especially on military ships (where running out of maneuver fuel 
equals death) maneuver fuel can easily be more than the jump fuel 
tankage.

On a side note, the Redwood City (Ca) Police Department is experimenting
with a city wide net of sensors that would detect gunshots, the triangulate
the shooter\'s location and dispatch police.  Early on, the system was prone
to count any large noise as a gunshot (a traffic jam on Woodside Rd
evidently gave the computer a nervous breakdown), but they are expecting to
have the system running by next New Years Eve.  This is important because
of the lovely habit of many people of firing guns in the air at midnight,
forgetting that those bullets have to land somewhere...

What?  You need more?  *grumble*

These two programs are DOS-based universe and world building tools.
Astrologicus (AL) starts with an entire galaxy, filled with clusters done
in 3-D.  Pick a cluster, and it shows the local stars, pick a star, and it
gives you a map of the system.  At each level you can name, modify, and
note relevant detail about the cluster/system in question.

Some nice touches include the Auto search feature that goes through a
cluster and identifies all the systems with habitable worlds.  At the
system level, you can zoom in on a planet and get details on its resources,
weather, atmosphere, ecological zones, etc..

The program takes up an astoundingly small amount of space for such a
useful product.  since each galaxy has up to one thousand clusters, and
each cluster can have hundreds of stars, you see the potential.

Terralogicus (TL) is the companion piece.  A world mapper, it can be
accessed by selecting a world in AL then zooming in closer.  The maps are
Travelleresque polygons.  You can zoom in until the scale is about 1m/hex.
While demonstrating this program for Kirsten the other night, we started at
the galaxy level and by zooming in at random ended up looking down at a
Quonset hut type building that was about 70m long.  All this information
can be saved for later use.

As with AL, you can alter the parameters for the planet you are mapping.
The program takes each change into account as you make it, so the maps are
very dynamic.

System requirements?  Gee.. pretty steep.  You have to have an 8088
processor, with 640k, DOS 3.3 or better.  They do recommend a 386 for those
of us on the cutting edge :)

Logicrucible is at:

http://www.logicrucible.com/index.html

Right now, they don\'t take orders over the web, so you\'ll have to phone
them or send them a check.  But they were very helpful and sent me my order
by US Priority Mail.

I really can\'t say enough about these two utilities.  Go to the web site
and give them a look.

While I intend to play it with a differing chance of misjump, that\'s not
how it is written in CT or T4.  In CT, the chance is 13+, with modifiers.
This meant that you couldn\'t misjump unless you did something risky.  In
T4, it\'s 2-, with modifiers, which is where the 1 in 36 chance at best
comes in.

I\'m thinking of a house rule that rolls an additional die after a misjump:
1-3 standard misjump, 4-5 insystem misjump, 6 time misjump (1D weeks).

This makes the odds of a jump to an empty hex 1 in 144.  This is probably
acceptable to freelance shippers, but not to megacorps.  It also makes the
wait in port for a missing ship more suspenseful, because it may be a lot
longer than expected for what ought to be a simple run...

I was wondering why a bank would mortgage a ship for 480 months when the
life expectancy was 36 months.  Do they require insurance?  If so, aren\'t
the premiums exhorbitant?

Although the Gazelle is a TL-14 design, implicitly (and maybe
explicitly) fairly old by 1100; I wonder if it was originally
designed at jump-3 or so and refitted to use drop tanks?

This is the same reason I have never used drop tanks in my campaign. They
give large corporations and governments a huge advantage over individuals.

So just use more hoses. Drop tanks already channel all their fuel through a
limited channel, hoses can use the same connection.

If you can jettison a huge drop tank large enough to store all the jump
fuel at once, why can\'t you jettison a simple hose that only has to carry a
fraction of the fuel volume at a time?

Why even use a hose at all? Just squirt the fuel into a big funnel outside
the ship connected to the engines. You don\'t need a physical connection
between the ship and tanker at all. If the "tanker" is outside the
100-diameter limit, you don\'t even need maneuver drives, the tanker can
dock with your ship.

I beg to differ. It eliminates all the "time and fiddling" of refuelling
for starships entirely. A single large tanker can do all the scooping,
refining, and whatever for several ships. Compare the hours it takes to
scoop and refine fuel to the minutes it would take to get refuelled by a
tanker. Getting refuelled from a tanker would take no longer than loading
already-refined fuel normally does. You already have to "rendevous" with a
port now to get refuelled, it would be even quicker to get this without
having to dock. Plus all the volume-wasting fuel tanks, scoops, and
refining machinery stays on the tanker where you don\'t have to maintain it
or carry it around. Instead, you get to carry more cargo.

I hardly think this is a valid comparison. Airlines have to use their fuel
incrementally as they travel. A more valid analogy would be allowing the
airport to burn all the fuel required for a flight before the plane even
takes off. The airliner doesn\'t need fuel tanks or refuelling en route at
all. This would revolutionize air travel.

The only drawback to using tankers is that you have to jump to a place that
also has them. This would not make them great for the military.
Logistically and economically, drop tanks and fuel tankers are nearly
identical. I can\'t understand why someone who allows drop tanks would balk
at using fuel tankers.

Depends on what system you use.  I think I\'ve made ships under FF&S and
FF&S2 that had more than 30 days worth of power with all systems running.

Could somebody post the jump rules that you guys are talking about? Because,
I\'ve only got MT and TNE, and none of this makes sense.  Obviously there\'s been

The problem I see with trying to pull 6Gs for 30 days is fuel.  A Thrust
Plate drive loses most of it\'s efficiency out of a gravity well (Operates
at 10% of efficiency ??)  Without checking I don\'t think you could pull
over .6 Gs with a 6G ship.  A non-thrustplate ship should run out of
reaction mass LONG before you hit 30 days. ( And if they have THAT much
reaction mass, they should jump home anyway... <g>) It would still add up
in the long run.

Agreed.  The point of the excercise in creating excel spreadsheets was for
me to determine how long the a ship would need to travel if it couldn\'t
jump and it had to take a normal space journey.  While 60 years seems like
a possibility for a slow return, 754 seems like it would be too long, at
least for humans.

Aside from the salvage crew idea mentioned, another possibility hit me,
which is scout missions to periodically check empty sectors for misjumped
ships.  Normal procedure if you expect to be rescued within a year is to
mothball all except the low births and hope the scouts arrive before your
systems fail.

Here\'s another thought about how to return: look at the contents of your
ship and ask "what can be converted to water/hydrogen?"  Well, the ship is
full of air, that\'ll get us some, although we\'ll have to jump in Vacc suits
(or low berths).  Can we do anything clever with our cargo?  How about our
weapons?  Our supplies?

Heh.  Maybe I\'ll stick my crew on a mission, misjump them, and have the
things they need to make fuel in their ship, but they don\'t know it.  Let\'s
see if they figure it out...

Another question: How compressable is hydrogen?  Can we put enough of it as
"compressed emergency fuel" aboard the ship to do us any good?

Too bloody expensive.  Why screw around with Zochai crystal bombs when you get 
more bang for the buck from nukes?  Jesus, Joe, do the math already.

Speed is accelleration times the square of the time.  Once you know the speed, 
and know the distance you need to fly, you can figure out the time needed.  60 
years is a good ballpark figure.

How often would they check?  A mission is a costly thing, who\'d pay for it?

Low berths or medical fast drug.  Group I was playing with one time stuffed a 
bunch of refugees in the cargo hold knocked out with med slow & stacked like 
cordwood.

If they\'re doing medical fast, let them climb in a rescue ball rigged up with 
a full day\'s air & their suit.  They knock themselves out for the month, wake 
up, button up their suit, run the air in the bubble thru a recycler to scrub 
out the CO2. recharge the bottles, then climb back into the bubble, unseal the 
suit and take another hit.  12 doses make you last a year, only using 12 days 
worth of life support.  Figure they\'d need 720 doses to make it that 60 year 
sublight flight, and 2 years life support for 1 person.  Life support for 20 
people for a month will give one person life support for 560 days.  Now figure 
a way to get that 60 year flight down to 50 and you have something that\'s 
*barely* do-able.  You\'d *want* that one person on med fast while the rest are 
in the low berths because you don\'t have to unthaw them to do cursory checks 
to make sure everything is going smoothly, or as smoothly as can be expected.

Like, they just *happen* to be transporting an old antique fully loaded 
fission reactor someplace, that should be good for about 100 years at x% of 
rated power?  It\'s one of those things that make you go "Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..."

> Another question: How compressable is hydrogen?  Can we put enough of it as

It\'s compressable, but it takes up the least amount of space as liquid.  Sure 
you can get it as a solid, too, but you better be able to maintain 
temperatures of 1 or 2 degrees Kelvin.  Not really worth it for the little 
amount of space you\'d save.

But isn\'t that the point of being a mega corporation or government? That\'s

Which brings up my idea for a Mega Mover -- in addition to the above, if
you believe in the wide spread use of automation like was discussed on
the list in the recent past, you can conceive of gi-normous multi million
ton Mega Movers that consist of little more than a shell to hold the cargo
and a jump drive. No crew, no wasteful fuel space, just load it up with the
Titanic, the Statue of Liberty, and the Eiffel Tower (all neatly packed in
standardized cargo containers of course <g>), close the clamshells, 
send the programmed jump information, and hit the button that pumps
over the fuel and fires up the engines.... *WHOOOSH* it\'s on its way...
Shouldn\'t be much more difficult than an automated xboat; hell, you 
might be able to load up *all* the automated xboats in it and deliver them
to their stations <g>.

While I tend to be ambivalent about automation in Traveller and tend 
to play more along the lines of the "1977 with jump drives" school,
the idea of these ENORMOUS robotic Andromeda Class Mega
Movers REALLY appeals to my sense of wonder.... I can certainly
image standing in an observation port of one of my Guppy ships and
being dumbstruck while watching one of these monsters enter from
jump space... Better get out the spreadsheet, I think Pan-Imperia 
just opened up a WHOLE new assembly line <g>.

	Nope, those are dismountable tanks. Drop tanks mount outside the
ship thereby increasing the overall displacement of the ship, and
hence reducing possible acceleration; the fuel they carry is used to
initiate jump, but before actually entering jump the now-empty tanks
are discarded, reducing the overall displacement of the ship. Hence a
100Td ship designed for Jump-3 can carry 30Td of drop tanks, and when
it jumps using those tanks, it can still make J3. However, if you
don\'t drop the tanks, your displacement is obviously 130Td.

	Technically, you can carry any amount of fuel you desire within drop
tanks. If it\'s less than you need for jump, you have to make up the
difference with internal tankage.

	Doesn\'t matter. Two points at different distances wille have exactly
the same charge/gravity ... at *ANY* point anywhere in the fictional
universe, the gravity will be exactly identical. There\'s _no_ height
dependence in the equation:

	A=k*G*Density*thickness

As you can see, under editions prior to T4, misjump can only occur if
you DON\'T take care of your ship properly. Under Mega and TNE, Misjumps
poutting you outside the target system are not common. Under MT, the
occur 1/36 x 1/12, or 1/432, somewhere around 0.22%, assuming you have
something wrong with the drive.

Due to MT and TNE\'s safe jump notes, most commerce will have failure
rates on the order of nil, assuming the crew is competent, and doesn\'t
do anything stupid, and they are not cheapskates.


IMTU, I treat a safe jump fumble as a 1d+2 mishap; thus the high number
of minor relativity errors.... and almost no real misjumps unless the
ship is damaged or doing something stupid. Alas, however, stupidity is a
hall mark of the group I run for, at least as regards ship operations.
Dangerous jumps, unrefined fuels, jumping with damaged engines, souping
up the drives, etc.

[At this point Wil reaaly should mention that the Traveller group
normally uses dangerous jumps and jumping with dammaged engines are
normally only attempted when the alternative [instant death from the
pursing ships] is worse. - Peter Newman]

Well, that is the question.  It would depend, a lot, on how low you
can run a powerplant on wether a low berth does more than keep
things cold.  To me, surviving a misjump should be more than inconvenient,
though I think PCs should have _some_ chance.

Actually, I was assuming you would use 3/4 of your remaining fuel to
accelarate before you all went to "sleep".  However, as another poster
noted, it might be better to just send a message for help.  It will
get there at the speed of light.

No chance, you couldn\'t even built up enough pressure to push the
hydrogen into the tank.  (Actually, I have heard it claimed that
the concept is fundamentally flawed because the drag the hydrogen
causes would be more than the thrust you get out of it.

They are also a lot bigger than the fuel scoops you use for a gas
giant and don\'t rely on pressure to force the hydrogen into a tank.

I think you\'re using the wrong formula.
For  a point source:
F=GMm/d^2
F= Force of gravity
G= Universal gravity constant
M= Mass 1
m= mass 2
d= distance from point source

Since we\'re dealing with a nonvarying gravity body and the ship isn\'t losing
mass, GMm will be constant (we\'ll use K to represent this):
F=K/d^2

Now, applying Pythagorean theorum:
d^2= h^2 + r^2
d= distance from point source
h= height from plane
r= radius from intersection point

Now, we can assume a plane to consist of an arbitrarilly large set of point
sources.
Since the lateral components of these point sources balance out, only the
vertical component counts.
Fvertical at point = (h/d)(K/d^2) = hK(h^2 + r^2)^(-3/2)
If you sweep that around in a circle aligned with the axis of motion, the volume
underneath is the net vertical component gravity acting on a point at height h.
Fvertical combined = integral (r from 0 to infinity)
pi h K((h^2 + (R + dR)^2)^(-3/2) - (h^2 + R^2)^(-3/2))

I ran a rather large plane (large enough to see the convergence) through my
spreadsheet (since I have less than no idea how to integrate that)
With one square meter of plane producing 1m/s^2 acceleration, at 1 meter height,
gravity is 2 pi m/sec^2

However, It produced a very interesting skewed bell curve. At height less than
one meter, gravity dropped off (at h=0, gravity= 0) at larger heights, it also
drops off.

OK, now lets extrapolate a little here... lets say you\'ve got this moon orbiting a
gas giant at 101 diameters... ah hell, lets take a chance... 11 diameters... now
you pump fuel from the gas giant, filtering it on the way, to the injection

OK forget for a moment the probabilities of misjumping.  There are three possible results of
a misjump: Ship is destroyed, you fly off to d6*d6 parsecs, or you arrive in your targetted
system with a temporal hiccup.  Destroying your ship and flying off to oblivion don\'t seem to
be possible unless you really try for it, i.e. jump at 10 diameters and use unrefined fuel.

So, this whole business about routinely jumping into an empty system seems impossible to me.

Now here\'s a thought: If the chance of misjump is as high as stated and
there are many ships travelling in an area, it might be worthwhile for
individuals to start a career as a salvage crew.  If a ship is more than 2
months late, listed as missing, presumed misjumped, go looking in all the
empty hexes for it.  Carry fuel for three jumps and a prize crew. Check
each hex and take home ships.

If any jump has a 1 in 36 chance of misjump, and any hex within 6 has a 1
in 36 chance of being the destination of a misjump, then one in 1296 jumps
from starting point \'A\' will be to a particular empty hex.  If a starport
has one launch a week for the past 100 years, there will be 4 derelics
there.  If it has had 14 launches a week for 500 years, then the dead fleet
will be 140 ships large.

Hey, there\'s a way to escape a misjump!  Get the dregs of fuel from all the
dead ships!  Creepily entering the 1000 year old ship whose crew died here
in dispair, you find that this one too, has no fuel.  It does however have
a guardian robot...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Even with the odds of jumping to an empty square miscalculation 
(delt with by others), there is a problem with this: Space is mind-numbingly
BIG. The stars aren\'t in the center of the hexes, nor do misjumps put
you dead center in an empty hex. A misjumped ship could be anywhere in
(at least) a one parsec volume of your jump to the center for salvage ops.

Still, it might work - make a jump, fold out a real big antennae and listen,
jump to another location and do the same - look for a distress beacon.
Considering what a salvaged vessel could be worth, I can see some 
salvage crews trying deep space jump & scans - the odds would be more
like those of a prospector looking for a wildcat strike than a sure thing,
though.

Come to think of it, the Seeker (modified scout ship) rigged with the fuel
packs for Jump-2 might be just the ship to do this kind of work. An old,
clunky ship with an owner that\'s looking for a big score anyway - it\'d
jump in, take a scan, mark a signal, jump back for fuel, then jump for the 
signal, investigate, mark what\'s found for salvage and sell the location 
to someone who can do something about it.

Scenario Idea: The heroes are on a misjumped ship, with time running
out. A prospector on such a deep salvage scan, half space-happy already,
shows up and is grumpy to find the crew still alive. He promises to go
for help - or is he going away to wait for all to die, so he can come back
for a multimillion credit salvage? But if the heroes try to take his battered
Seeker, it might be destroyed in the fight...

plug-in for ships in GURPS Traveller.  It uses 1 dton = 500 cf.  

The laser is optimized for space combat, at the expense of performance in
ground or air combat; in particular, the energy bank is sufficient for only
one shot, and at the listed power takes 10 minutes (one space combat turn)
to recharge. Stabilization for the laser is also not included, as it has no
effect on space combat.  

Ranges in hexes and AESA ranges in vacuum follow the errata for VE2.  The
AESA has a range equal to 2x the 1/2D of the laser, thus its range in
low-res radar or ladar mode equals the 1/2D range.  The radar/laser
detectors are primarily for directing anti-missile fire.  

The materials used are standard, and only DR 10.  This is the closest
simple fit I could find to Traveller materials, both lb/sf and $/lb.  I
assume the hull DR of the ship still protects the ship\'s interior, and that
the volume of the socket has been included in environmental systems
calculations (life support, artificial gravity, grav compensation).  I also
use power slugs in lieu of power cells, per an earlier analysis of laser
rifle powerpacks in both games.

This is intended to establish a standard configuration for these turrets,
which serves two purposes.  I will post a list of standard designs at a
later date, with weight, cost, power consumption, and weapons statistics,
on the theory that you are already familiar with this design and that the
other turrets\' features are analogous to this one.  As the simplest
starship weapon one can expect to encounter in a GURPS Traveller campaign,
this also serves as a basis for comparison - for hull armor, weapons and
sensor ranges, systems capabilities, etc.

Ideally you come out of jump 100 diamters from target planet, right?
To do this, you would need to have calculated the period of the planet\'s orbit and the
diameter of the planet, and then predict where it will be.
So, this calculation would be an astrogation task.
But what if the target planet is occluded by other objects in that target system (a gas
giant, a star, an asteroid belt, etc.).  Could you then rely on library data after synching
up the predicted positions by observation (i.e., observe target system, since planets X and Y
are in relationship Z, jump to point A to arrive within 100 diamters of planet B).

Here\'s a good one:  say you want to target a small planet that is with 100 diameters of a
huge gas giant, or will be at the time jump is completed.  Jump wouldn\'t be possible then
would it?

Don\'t forget your passengers.  Humans are 90%+ water.  One ninth of
water is hydrogen.  Therefore one tenth of the weight of each passenger
is hydrogen.  In CT humans cannoically weighed 75 kg (AM 1 Aslan IIRC),
therfore each passenger should have 7.5 kg of hydrogen in them.  1000kg
in a ton (mass & displacement for hydrogen) / 7.5 kg = 133.333
passengers whom you need to murder & throw in the fuel purifier to get
an extra ton of fuel for the jump drive.

Noter that given the high numbers of people you need to get the fuel
this is slightly impractical on most ships.  It may work better in a
Hard Times era MT campaign.  If your ship is stranded in a system
without any jump fuel you can blow the colony domes on any low tech
Failing or Doomed world & collect the dead bodies after they all die of
air loss.  Most planets with populations of 5+ should provide sufficinet
fuel for most small ships, it will however take a bit of time to process
this much fuel.

Everybody seems to be assuming that an "empty hex" is *totally empty*, and
IMTU that\'s not usually the case. There should be lots of dark matter
floating around in even the emptyest hexes...and if you can find a chunk
you should be able to refine hydrogen out of it.  Instead of starting a 700
year journey and diving into low berths, the ship\'s crew should spend a few
days searching for a nice big snowball. 

Let\'s say it\'s a Staggering Task (8hr) of Sensor Skill to detect a chunk of
matter, so your crew has 3 chances a day to find something. (I\'m not
completely happy with the sensor rules, they don\'t really cover this
situation, but at a point like this you\'re talking GM-plot point anyway.)
Once they find something, it might be 50-50 that it will be a useful chunk.
If it is, great, if it\'s not they keep looking. Eventually, they hit
"paydirt" and have to mine/refine and ready for another shot at jumping.  

A misjump into an "empty hex" shouldn\'t be deadly or lead to "time out of
time" adventures *every* time.  Many times it will delay the ship for weeks
while they search for a iceball, throwing timetables off and disrupting
schedules, but that\'s all.

Star Wars
Rebel Assault II--The Hidden Empire

CDROM (2 CDROMS included)
Price:  $10.00

Great game!  You follow along a Star Wars story, jumping in and playing
at appropriate times.
After the destruction of the Death Star, Darth Vader is pretty P-Oed.
He\'s got a new weapon under his sleeve,  though, and it\'s up to you to
do something about it.

The graphics are incredible, with full-motion video in places.  Sound is
awesome, and the game is fun as heck (trust me, heck is pretty fun).



Privateer 2:  The Darkening

CDROM  (3 CDROMS included)
Price:  $15.00

This game has the feel of the Aliens movies--the actors are British and
it is a dark future.  This game stars Christopher Walkin, John Hurt,
Jurgen Prochnow, David Warner, Amanda Pays, Brian Blessed, and David
McCallum among others.

The graphics are great, and you take up the story of man who has lost
his memory--and he\'s trying to figure out who\'s trying to kill him.  You
follow along a story, but the meat of this game is the space-fighter
combat simulation.  You can customize your own ship kick some butt with
the pirates.



Battleground:  Ardennes
Battle of the Bulge

CDROM
Price:  $5.00

If you like wargames, this is a cool one.  Unlike most, it is very easy
to learn.  You can print out situation reports to study the battlefield
if you are playing a friend.  This also includes the "Battleview"
function, where you can turn the map into a 3D representation.  You can
actually see the height of the terrain and figure line of sight this
way.  Cool wargame.



Star Trek
Judment Rites

3.5 Floppy
Price:  $5.00

Captain\'s Log, stardate 6238.4.  There is no doubt we\'re being
watched....  Follow along with Kirk & Co. while you go along various
episodes modeled after the original series.  I really enjoyed this game
and played it, all the way through, three times, but then again, I\'m a
Trekkie.



Star Trek
Judment Rites
Movie & Sound Pack
Cluebook

3.5 Floppy
Price:  $5.00  (for both)

The movie and sound pack adds many cinematic scenes to the story you
play in the game listed above.  The cluebook keeps you from dialing
Interplay\'s 900 number when you get stuck.

An example:

Year 0    Age 30
Invest all assets in Zhunastu Industries Stock (and low berth maintenance).
Enter low berth.

Year 50  Age 30 (and a day or so)
Exit Low Berth
Sell Stock,
Invest in real estate on Sylea.
Have fun for a year.

Year 51   Age  31
Enter low berth.

Year 100 Age 31
Exit low berth.
Sell real estate on Sylea.
Buy a Countship or Baronry.
Try to spend all the money before you die.



Of course the real reason is I want to use this to move my players forward
through time periodically.

But in general, if this process is allowable, it only makes sense that people
would pay for the service, and if someone will pay for it, someone will sell
it.  And if someone will sell it, someone will tax it.  You could have
companies in which a majority of the shareholders were in low berth.  That
creates huge problems wrt management of resources, etc.  How do you
discourage people from doing this?  After all, you need some basic level of
labor to keep everything functioning.  And especially to expand an empire.

Vernor Vinge has written about this kind of idea in his Across Realtime
novelas.

I dearly love MT, the task system is my favorite, the stuff Digest Group
did with it is wonderful, and I even think the Rebellion/Hard Times era
has wonderful possibilities, *but* the fuel consumption for Fusion plants
was *really silly*.  I worked out the efficiency of those things once and
it turned out to be around 0.001% (ie 1/1000 of the energy being produced
was being converted to electricity.  The easiest thing to due is either to
adopt FF&S2 for MT or (even easier) reduce Fusion fuel consumption by a
factor of 100.  To compensate, change jump fuel consumption to 10% of
volume/parsec jumped. Do this and my suspension of disbelief is much less
troubled, and every ship would likely carry fuel for the power plant for a
year or so.

Found the Traveller novel in the Waldenbooks near work. There were about a
half dozen copies, I picked up one and will see how many are still there the
next time I go.

Overall, I\'m enjoying the books. Oh yes, the typos irriate me. The incorrect
references to the Droyne really irritate me. But, it\'s the spawn of Imperium
Games, so I guess those two things are to be expected, along with the other
occasional canon-busting blooper.

I like the small details the most. For example, finding passengers and cargo
in the local starport bar. How many times have we played that scene ourselves?
I also like the occasional bit like "Droyne Droppings". Although the name is
misplaced for the era, it\'s a great reference!

On the last page or so I notice a reference to "the story will continue". I
would buy the next volume. I like it better than the New Era novels (which
were fun, but I hated the "Hi, my name is Joe, codename Hatcheck" character
reference bullhockey. Writing is about the same, characterizations are about
the same, plot is about the same.  Not quite at the Swycaffer level (but those
were definately not "canon"), but loads of fun!

Yes. Both, actually. According to the excellent article \'Suspended Animation\' in the Travellers\' Digest #21, there are two types of low berths: Chill Berths and Cold berths. Chill Berths lower metabolic rates to minimal levels, making a \'ten-day trip in hibernation [...] effectively the same as four hours\' sleep\'.

Cold Berths completely freezes the occupant, stopping metabolic processes altogether. No aging occurs.

Excactly. Such people normally seek membership with a Timer Club, where all members lay frozen and are usually simultaneously revived at regular intervals. In this way, Timers have acquaintances they can share their experiences with in each new time they emerge into. After a while, they go back into cold sleep again for another cycle.

Passenger : "Have we landed yet?"
Steward :" Yes, we have, now if you would take your things and step into the airlock,

Absolutely, they get *SOME* chance.  I just wouldn\'t hand it to them on a

2.  That\'s where the \'good enough engineer\' comes in.  If he can rig up a 200 
km+ wide ramscoop (or a magnetic field 200km wide, that is!!), I don\'t see why 
the ship couldn\'t get a *trickle* of hydrogen into the tanks.

Why not pick up a map of someplace like the Spinward marches & toss some dice 
already?

According to CT, & the exact reference escapes me at the moment, you come out 
about 100 diameters automatically.  It\'s like, your car stops at the curb of 
the street instead of on your front porch or inside your living room.

Optional \'brown pants rule\':  If you khest your calculations, you can pop up 
*anywhere* inside the system, but it wrecks your powerplant and drives if you 
come in too close.

This would already be part of your navigation program\'s database, yes?  Or at 
least, a position and vector notation for a standardised date should be.  The 
computer then calculates the position where the target planet will be from 
that.  And you\'d update the database at yearly maintanance as a matter of 
course.

Shouldn\'t be a problem, barring the occaisional rogue comet...

Since you can\'t come out within 100 diameters of the nearest \'large\' object 
(and by large, I mean, on the order of a kilometer or more), the computer 
would probably refuse the endpoint solution and put you 100 diameters away 
from the gas giant.  And if you told the computer to ignore the gas giant 
anyways, the drive would bring you out someplace beyond the 100 diameter limit.

This was the basis for at least one unpublished GDW MegaTraveller adventure.
The advertisement meantioned something about them receiving some type of
radiation poisioning and using suspended animation to "travel" forward in
time through the Long Night and early periods of the 3I in search of a cure.
I also remember this being used in Survival Margin to move one NPC from the
onslaught of Virus into the RC. The major drawback with doing it in the
number of hops you mention is the infamous "Low Berth Lottery" rules. Since
I don\'t use Low Berth very often in my campaigns I don\'t remember the exact
numbers but it\'s fairly stiff, even in Millieu: 1100 (one of the reasons my
players avoid it! ) and I would think it should be even higher in the M:0.
The more frequent your hops forward the more likely you are to loose at the
"Lottery" and wind up dead! All in all, I\'d rather use analgesics than go to
sleep in a little tube knowing there was a good chance of not waking up! Low
Berth has always been a Last Resort IMTU.

What I\'m saying is there is only one way to end up in a nontargetted system, and that\'s the d6 * d6
misjump.  If you do get that one, you\'re surely screwed.  But that Misjump requires that you
actively mistreat your jumpdrive. Thus common travel will always put you in your target system and
thus within radio distance of help.

After you finish the game you can settle down and just become a merchant and
"jump" around doing trades, take adventures off the adventure board and a
whole host of Traveler like things.  Gabs of fun and you can upgrade your
ship, buy new ships, upgrade them, hire cargo carriers and perform escort
duty, add cargo pods to your own ship to do your own trading, etc.  Before
the end of the game it gets pretty hot for just trading in number of the
"Navigation" points.  It really does get down to a little fighting and
trading when you win the campaign.

LOVED THE GAME!

*IF* you\'re in a reasonably civilised area, like the Core worlds ca 1100.  On 
the frontier, in just about *ANY* era, you could be in some serious trouble, 
unless you do some seriously inventive stuff.

Now, I\'ve taken out characters that have done some totally *STOOPID* stuff in 
my time, but I try to *ALWAYS* give the characters a half a chance to get out 
of just about anything.  This includes misjumps into empty hexes...

What about the low berths running off of solar panels (for recharge).  The
low berths are already battery powered and you can get a couple of blankets
of solar panels (take up less space) and unroll them on the surface of the
ship.  You then need to run the power leads down to sickbay and tie them in.
At higher tech levels that may mean only a couple of square feet of solar
panels and they are cheap.  That\'s the ticket, problem solved.  That\'s what
I\'m going to do IMTU.

This is exactly right.  All positioning data is in the nav program already.
I like to think that its like the companies on the Internet, updates are
posted on their web site for your version of their software.  You dock at a
class A - C starport and download the updates automatically.  Same goes for
commodity pricing and any relevant news for the area.  This could actually
be done once a datalink is established with the starport and occurring in
the background while your computer is bringing the ship in.  Transactions
with agents could be conducted automatically and your cargo sold and the new
load already contracted by the time you dock.  This is all part of your
docking fee so there isn\'t any money to change hands.  You could even have
programmed in criteria and prioritized any speculative cargo so that it
could be purchased automatically too.

100% correct!  These are built in protections and Marc has commented on the
100 diameter region previously.  You should be perfectly safe unless you
have a catastrophic roll of the die and even then there are still some
protections in place.  You would have to blow two or more rolls to wind up
in the center of the gas giant.  If that should happen have a bronze
memorial plate made up and put in orbit around the gas giant to show your
respect.

IIRC the limit was on *bays* not barbettes?

There were MT designs which allowed 1 bay per 1000 dT or part of.

>err.. umm... did you just agree or disagree? :-|

Err. (sometimes I embarrass myself - I shouldn\'t post that late at night).

What I was trying to say was:

1) I agree that the stronger materials will allow faster rotation and thus
(for the same diameter wheel, similar density) a higher energy density.

2) I disagree that there will be much spare capacity in a HPG for the
following reasons:

a) It is likely that the designs are modular so they can be supplied to the
J-Drive OEMs. In most cases the manufacturer will probably look at building
a smaller, faster unit for the same energy to reduce their costs (remember
that the higher strength material will probably cost significantly more so
you\'d look to use less of it).

b) HPGs will operate up to a certain point where a resonance will cause
failure by contact of the rotating element or destruction of the bearings.
There is unlikely to be much spare capacity to go higher than the rated
speed, else you aren\'t using the material or the performance of the
rotating element particularly efficiently.

3) Based on the work I\'ve been involved in in flywheel energy systems, I
would propose one way to get an extra charge out of a unit. Most
flywheel/HPG systems I\'ve seen don\'t discharge totally. This is because of
two reasons -

(a) bearing wear induced by the start/stop from rest
and
(b) potential for damage to the bearing/rotor from low end resonances just
before stopping.

Thus you could suggest that the HPGs in a Jumpdrive never fully discharge,
allowing a special case option where they do discharge fully, releasing
extra energy. For example, in any HPG/FESS you can obtain 75% of the energy
(gross - ignoring transfer losses) in the rotor if you cycle it between
100% design speed and 50% design speed. Slowing to rest would boost
available energy by 25%, at the risk of damaging the HPG.

Hey, the grav plates are part of the security system on our ship.

Guy making trouble ?

Hit him with 6G. Then -6G.

And when the physical limit of silicon is reached, we move into
the era of quantum computing, which has no such limits.

The first quantum computers have already been built,
(by IBM) and several models are already patented, such as the
design that has made RSA encryption obsolete and unsafe.

I support that, one of the best games I\'ve played in involved
us spend several gaming sessions modifying a light cruiser
(the _only_ starship in system ) to carry refugees from a star system
in which the planet\'s biosphere was rapidly falling apart due to enemy
biologics.

We had the full support of the local government, 
but it was still a major effort to maintain security
get the raw materials for the mods,the modifications done, the
chosen on board, the ship safely into orbit, and clear 

It was a very moving moment when we farewelled the local military
commander who was protecting the starfield, the classic salute, and
"Carry on, Major", both of us knowing full well that he and his
troops were going to die as we launched.

Dodging panicked SDBS, and incoming hostiles on the way out, and then we
had a week in jump with an overloaded ship full of refugees, not all of
whom were acting that grateful for their rescue.

As someone else said, C.J. Cherryh\'s Downbelow Station is
perfect to capture the feel of this sort of situation.

Well, all our hiver-provided "universal translators"

Basically, Hiver was a very useful battle language
for those of us that "spoke" it.
 
Still, there is a dance club in the galaxy where
sophonts do "the hand jive", but where any

This is also the basis for Steve Miller\'s IG adventure "The Sleepers" in T4
book 9, Anomalies.   The players find a long-term cryochamber from the end
of the Rule of Man.

I would think the odds of dying in coldsleep would be the big deterrant to

OK, presumption 1.
The enemy ship has grappled yours to enable boarders to actually get into your ship.
Implication, you aren\'t capable of warding off said ship.
Implication, Maneuver drive is down, power plant probably down, etc.
Question: How do you have artificial gravity without power?

Presumption 2.
Boarding procedure would require a means of crossing the space between ships.
Typically, this implements grav belts.
Grav belts would negate  the ping pong effect

Presumption 3.
Resistance is futile.
If you attack the boarders, the enemy ship is likely to cut their losses and vaporize
your ship.  Who\'s got the last laugh now?

	*Sigh* nope. Do the integration, or look up the recent message where
someone did it for you. For an infinite plane, that is the correct

If you come out in the center of a gas giant, I\'d think there\'d be a helluva explosion.  And who\'d know you did if you come out in said gas giant?  No survivors to tell anyone, and who\'d be *looking* to see?

Holdovers from CT, which specifies 1 HP per 100 displacement tons *OR* 1
weapons bay per 1000.

Couple design errors in Adventure Class Ships Vol 1 had weapons bays AND
hardpoints in an illegal mix, then claimed the ship could whip anything in its
size class.  Kinda like bringing an Ingram to a kung fu match...

Several reasons:

 1. Anagathics are not without serious drawbacks.
     a) hard to find
     b) long term usage effects on the body (reactions)
     c) you are still awake awaiting investments to roll in
         which means you have more expenses (probably)

 2. While you sleep in "chill storage" 10 days you only age 4 hours.
     several long hauls (a year +) could allow your investments to mature.

 3. The odds of problems in "chill storage" versus "cold storage" are
      relatively miniscule so that makes it significantly safer.

All of this of course hinges on the Game Master\'s approval and should
percentage wise turn out more in your favor if lets say you had to leave the
game for a while.  You make some investments (with his/her approval) and
just jump into "chill storage" for the duration that you are out of the
game.  You
return, collect your investments and arrange (hopefully preplanned) to meet
your fellow Travellers at the appointed place and time.

I\'ve done this for a number of my PC\'s in the past.

This is something of an overstatement - the closest to a quantum
computer currently tested is something that can do a four-element
search (find one item out of a list of four) in half the operations 
that a conventional computer could. Not (as yet) particularly
useful.

Analgesics? And yet another use for that miracle drug called aspirin is

Yeah, but someone who really plays the market probably wouldn\'t go for
something like this.  When he wakes up, Zhunastu might have gone belly-up.

Again, real-estate values can change drastically in 5 or 10 years, let
alone 50+ years.

I\'m not trying to merely be contrary here, although it may look that way
:^)  Seriously, I think anagathics would be the way to go for someone who\'s
serious about making large quantities of money.

Well if that\'s the reason, it should work (there are a couple of examples

You have to look at it the other way.  If you go into "storage" for 50
years, the world will be completely different when you come out.  Imagine
somebody going into low berth in 1948 and then waking up in 1998...  A
very, very different world, and all of the money in the world isn\'t going
to make that any easier.  Anagathics, on the other hand, can allow you to
live for a very, very long time, and it gives you the flexibility of
adjustment to changing times and politics, and the chance to make more
money by keeping an eye on the stock market, keeping an eye on real estate
values, etc.

Doug, do you know if text files can be linked to worlds
and star systems? In other words, can we attach our own
notes files ala Galactic 2.3? Also, is it possible to
add symbols in a planetary hex, such as ASCII characters?

(See what you get for doing a review? :-) )

I guess this is a difference in playing styles.  I don\'t think that they\'d
be as hard to find as old school Traveller seemed to think (since I think
they\'ll be synthesized, and not the juice from a gland in a tree kraken,
available on only one world in the Spinward Marches and the like).

Never having seen "chill storage" and "cold storage" before an earlier

Why piracy?
He isn´t proposing selling copies, he´s just selling his own copy.
He paid for it and it´s his to sell! Why shouldn´t you be able to sell 
software like you would a used car or old sofa? As long as you don´t keep a copy on you
hard drive...

I am assuming you mean comets thrown out of stellar orbit and stuff
and not "Dark Matter" as in speculative matter postulated to exlain
current astronomical observations and theories.

I agree they should search.  I all depends on luck and GM kindness.
Space if pretty empty and the odds of something being in sensor range
are _very_ small.  OTOH, it could be the basis for GM indulgence.

I would roll something like 1% (I\'m being generous is you want to
be realistic, though if not you could up that) to see if there is
anything there for them to find.  Then I would roll a difficult task
for them to find it (once per day perhaps).

IIRC, less than a fraction of a light-year.  Additionally, you
could be in the middle of it and still have a very low chance of
having one in detector range.

There are comets and stuff thrown out of stars all the time and
they will occure in interstellar space.  However, the density is
_very_ low.  Similarly, I don\'t know if the theory of stellar
system formation prohibits this, but the possibility exists of
a failed stellar system that was too low in mass.  (It collapsed
into a gas giant surrounded by a few moons rather than into
a star).  But these would be _very_ rare also.

The point is that if you are scooping in significant amouns of
hydrogen you are getting significants amount of drag.  Your
ship will effentually slow down to match the mean velocity
of the matter in the area.

Aside from the drag, I doubt a starship has the materials for this.

Because the software agreement clearly states that you have bought the

Well if M:0 is anything like similar periods of expansion in our history
there will be a fairly high bankruptcy rate, and many swindles, get rich
quick schemes, and so on. This means that you could reasonably enforce a
reasonably high chance that when they come out of the cold their
investments aren\'t as healthy as expected. There\'s also a chance that the
low berth providers quietly take their money and never wake them up, or are
swindlers, etc. Likewise whoevers managing their estate while they\'re
\'asleep\'. 

Somw worlds might do like Larry Niven did in _World Out of Time_ and say
that anyone in a low berth for more than, say, 20 years is legally dead, or
at least loses title to their possesions. I imagine that the heirs to the
estate would be all for that. 

I don\'t see this as being common, as TNE articles in the late 1120s mention
long sleep clubs as becoming popular. This being news-worthy implies that
they normally weren\'t common or popular. Another reason it can\'t be common
in the canon universe is that it would\'ve put a huge brake on the
Imperium\'s development, because the \'sleepers\' would be giving very
conservative investment instructions to their investors. This would explain
some of the 3I\'s poor decsions, but if ti was significant historians
would\'ve noted it as a cause - mind you the significance of fusion+ somehow
also escaped their notice :(.

Yes, I mean things like comets..although chunks strike me as a better term
for them..as well as miscellanious pieces of condensed matter. Although,
the cometary belts might not extend across intersteller space I think it is
more likely than not that various dark objects are floating around
throughout space.  The "Dark Matter" of cosmology is something else
entirely. ;->

That depends on sensor sensitivity, ranges and the amount of space
searched, obviously.  Bruce\'s rules look like you could scan pretty huge
volumes.  The *big* problem would be getting to whatever you found..T4\'s
version of TPlate thrusters are next to worthless in deep space, and
reaction engines need reaction mass...the very thing you are short of.

Well, as I said...in my TU. ;-> Obviously, intersteller space is somewhat
less empty in mine than yours..probably less than RW too, but that\'s still
an open question.

There is some debate about just how far out it extends, but I think current
thought is that it only extends out a few light months. Yes, it would have
a goodly number of snowballs, still thinly spread...but there.

Beyond the Oort Cloud, in open intersteller space, there are still probably
swarms of snowballs, chunks of primortial matter, as well as matter spun
off from  star systems, and who knows what all.  Very thin, but still out
there and whether it\'s thick enough to find anything or not is pretty much
up to the GM..IMTU, and IMO. ;->

If he bought the media, then he can legally sell the media.  Copyright
is only the right to copy.  You can not put a license on a physical
object.  I talked at great length with an intellectual property lawyer
about this.  This is the same as if you buy a book you can resell the
book even though you don\'t own the copyright.  They can not restrict
your rights with regards to the book itself.  In the Fifth Circuit
(including Texas, Louisiana, and several other states), those licenses
which you "agree" to by opening the package have been found to not be
binding.  When you buy software, you are bound by the local, state, and
federal laws regarding copyrighted software, *not* whatever they
happen to put on the shrinkwrap.  Now, you might be able to argue that
the second person who buys the software doesn\'t have any right to make
a copy on their hard drive to run the program, but if the first person
really does delete the software and sells it to a second person and
the second person behaves as though bound by copyright law covering
software, then I don\'t see the problem.  I really doubt a court would
find that this was harming the company nor that it was a violation of
the copyright.  I seriously doubt Logicrucible would have a problem
with someone reselling their software as long as the sellor doesn\'t
keep a copy for his own use.

This is a strictly artificial limit, exceeded at will by any area
that has started installing xDSL services (which of course vary in
speed and other aspects).  Speeds in excess of 8Mega bits per second
are achievable.  My local phone company will start selling the
service to home users as soon as some type of standard emerges.

Yeah, but now the chip designers are starting to utilize those 
effects to transfer data along signal paths.  The wave like 
characteristics of electrons allows much smaller data paths.
Quantum well diodes, and single electron transistors are 
beginning to see the light of day. 

Researchers are even looking to building chips that have 
optical interconnects, enabling a single optical conductor 
on a chip to pass hundreds of different signals at the 
same time.

Limits aren\'t really limits if there is a way to go around them.

Researchers have come up with the fastest transistor on the planet.  They
_think_ it has a max switching speed of 10 Tera Hertz.  There isn\'t any 
test equipment fast enough to time it.  It works off only a few microvolts
and only pulls a few pico amps.  Can you say 1THz CPU that only needs half
a volt for operation?  That would be cool.

Hmm, I just saw a note in EETimes about a military test firing a 7.36kW 
beam through 6 feet of 900uM diameter fiber (That was 7.36kW emmitted
power, doesn\'t say what the input was).  The beam then went on to cut 
through .5 inches of stainless steel plate.

Really?  I just heard a really good one.  In EETimes there is an article
about space based laser weapons.  Clinton is planning on putting up a
constellation of them for protection against ballistic missiles.  Who woulda

If you sell your copy, are you not relinquishing your right and
transferring that right to the buyer?  I\'ve looked a a number of (game)
licenses and none of them seem to restrict transferring that right.  The
point seems to me to be that SOMEbody has the right to place ONE copy on
ONE computer.  If you transfer/sell that right, how do you violate the
license agreement?  Of course, I write this without having looked at
LogiCrucible\'s licensing agreement...

Of course, risk is always a factor (and why you\'d have to prepay).  You could
have the security of your investments tracked while you\'re in coldsleep.  A
good mutual fund type arrangement will give you good odds that your investments
will substantially increase, of course assuming relatively stable market over
the long term.

I gave that example because real estate rarely depreciates.  And real estate on

Not different enough, IMHO.  And for a government like the Imperium especially.
Sure, some of the players change sides, and new players come and old players
go, but the system is by and large the same.  For example, the modern map of
Europe is extremely similar to the one during the Treaty of Westphalia in the
16th century.  And think about Vilani culture.  Talk about a long-view culture
with an incredible stability.

Assuming you can afford them in the first place, maybe.  But who wants to add
on to the years towards the end of life?  Low berths are much mroe readily
available.

Your emergency auxilary power supply - 14m3 of 1 hour release batteries

Far as I can see, contragravity (used for grav belts) needs a local gravity
well to \'push\' against. Artificial gravity seems to create a uniform field
between the floor and ceiling playes by the Grand Unified Handwave Theory.

If this is true, they probably used reaction packs of one sort or another
to cross.

This is actually a doctrinal issue - in the age of sail, ships routinely
surrendered, somtimes changing hands 2 or three times during their useful
life. Once the ironclads came, ships were scuttled rather than risk capture.

Strategically, I can see it to be in the interests of the Navy as a whole
to have crews die rather than surrender their ship. OTOH, this isnt in the
interest of their crews.

Actually, I can see a compromise, somewhat similar to the way some of the
sieges went historically ... "If we can take and board you on the first 2
attempts, you become prisoners of war and we keep the ship. If you beat off
2 attempts at boarding, we let you either self-repair or scuttle, and we
will provide you with an honour guard to your nearest friendly base
together with the Imperial Portrait and your ship\'s battle honours."

Can\'t figure out who it is, but the middle post here has got it basically
right.
The First Sale Doctrine allows you to sell a copy that you have already
legally purchased.
Its important to note that "copy," in copyright terms, doesn\'t imply that you
have perfomed the act of copying something.

"\'Copies\' are material objects, other than phonrecords, in which a work is
fixed by any method . . .and from which the work can be perceived, reporduced,
or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine."  17
U.S.C. Sec. 101.

The First Sale Doctrine is codifeid at 17 U.S.C Sec. 109:
"(a)  . . . [T]he owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made . .
. is entitled, without authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise
dispose of the posession of that copy or phonorecord."

So, what does that mean?  You can sell or give away your copy of a computer
program, BUT, you may not keep a reproduction of that work for yourself if you
do so.  If you do that, you\'ve made an unauthorized reproduction, and you\'ve
infringed the copyright.  If that program was worth more than $1500, even
doing this once subjects you to criminal copyright infringement.  Thats right,
Criminal!

In the end, it is not piracy if you do not keep a reproduction for yourself.

Yes.  This is the First Sale Doctrine.  (See my other post).

I wouldn\'t go quite that far.  They are \'not necessarily\' binding.  They \'may\'
be.  There is a whole host of issues involved in that determination.  Shrinkwrap
licenses in general, lean to the non-binding side of the equation because they
are non-negotiatied boiler plate that might have effected the decision to
purchase and/or the value of the product (because presumably software without a
license is more desirable; likewise, you\'d pay less for a complicated license on
a product).

Circuits vary.  And they can change their own mind about an issue.  If you\'re
going to rely on circuit opinions on this kind of issue, you should probably
look to those heavily involved with computer industry: 9th (California) and the
1st (Massachusetts).

This is essentially correct.  (see my other post).

There *is* a debate about what "the right to place one copy on one
computer" means, personally, I come down on the same side as Bill on this
one. 

IAC, bullet three of the Logicrucible License Agreement reads, in part,
"You may not rent, lease, or give away the SOFTWARE, but you may transfer
your rights to the SOFTWARE and accompanying materials, on a permanent
basis, provided (a) the recipient agrees to the terms of this agreement,
and (b) you retain no copies of the Software or accompanying materials."
So, selling it is perfectly OK.

Oh, about Astrologicus and Teralogicus...yes, they are very interesting,
but frankly, I haven\'t gotten much utility out of either for Traveller
games. I\'ve ended up using Galactic much more.

Sorry, but other posts have gone thru the *calculus* involved and come

You just made your first mistake. 

A=GM/D^2 for a *point* source. The mass of the ship doesn\'t enter into it.

When figuring the field of a *non*-point source, you have to figure for
each and every point *seperately*, which means that you figure the
attraction based *only* on the mass at that point.

Next, the attracting mass *does* vary with distance. That\'s why you
got the wrong answer. At height H above the plane, only an ifinitesmal
amount of mass is at distance H, that\'s the point directly under the
ship. A radius r from that point, you have "rings" of attracting mass,
and as r increases, the mass involved goes up as the *square* of the
radius. 

Since your calculations ignore this, there\'s no point going on. Check
the post that did the correct calculations.

Slight problem. Misjumps can be as much as *36* parsecs. That screws up
this plan, but good.

Try that with liquid hydrogen and you\'ll get a flow rate of *zero*.
It\'ll evaporate into the vacuum. And even if it *stayed* liquid, you
can\'t get a high enough flow rate under those circumstances. 

For one, this being zero g, the fuel will seperate into balls, and
since you are in a vacuum, there\'s no "suction" at the funnel to pull
the balls f fuel in. 

For the sort of flow rate jump drives seem to need, you have to *pump*
fuel at *high* pressure. So only a *pipe* will do.

Well, the most likely looking reference given in the article is:

It\'s one of Forward\'s articles. :-)

This describes Massachusetts quite well. Except they don\'t shoot at each

   ghost-shotguns... or set the parameters so that cars backfiring,
   fireworks, children\'s cap guns (those few left... water guns are, I
   suppose, safer), or even sound effects on TV or the local drive-in, set
   if off).

2; some intrepid freelancer socialists use some of the US Army\'s wonderful
   little distraction gadgets (the ones PsyOps made up that sound like
   gunfire) to overload the police system by tying up a bunch of patrol
   cars on bogus gunfire reports generated by the computer, then hitting a
   bank or three during the "crisis"

   gunfire reporets that the cops get to the point where they don\'t trust
   the damn thing anymore (this is best mixed with number one, as that

Slight problem. Solar panels output depends *directly* on the amount of
light shining on them. If you\'ve jumped into an "empty" hex, that light
is too feeble to power much of anything. You\'re a parsec from the
nearest star. A parsec is a bit over 200,000 AU. At one AU from a star
like Sol, you have about 1 kW per square meter of solar energy
available, but the panels can\'t get all of that. 80% efficiennt would
be damn good.

Now, at 200,000 AU the energy is 1/40,000,000,000th as strong. So you\'d
have 25 *nano*watts per square meter. (25e-9). So to get 1 kW, you\'d
need a 200 km square array of solar cells at 100% efficiency.

That\'s why probes going out past Mars don\'t use solar cells, but rely
on RTGs instead.

Well, you\'d have to come out at the 100 diameter of the gas giant and
then use manuever drive from there. 

But keep in mind how *big* planetary systems are. 100 Diameters from
even a huge gas giant isn\'t likely to come anywhere *near* another
planet. 

Jupiter is about 140,000 km in diameter. So 100 diameters is about 14
million km. But 1 AU is 150,000,000 km. So the 100 diameter limit is
less than a tenth of an AU. And planets don\'t get that close to each
other.

It\'s only "artificial" in the sense that they are using *normal* phone
lines, which have a limited bandwidth to avoid interference between
lines, and to be able to work with all the other gear out there.

XDSL is *digital*, not analog, and it requires that a number of things
be done to the lines. You can\'t just install it on a normal phone line
without doing a lot of work.

The analog limit is set by Shannon\'s Law. And we *have* hit it. The
digital limits also have to deal with Shannon\'s Law too. It\'s just that
you figure bandwidth rather differently.

Remember the <100 diameter DM *and* the <10 diameter DM *both* apply

Maybe Bruce or one of the other astronomy types can give us an estimate
for the average distance between 1 km, 100 meter, 10 meter, and 1 meter
snowballs in "free" space. Given that, we could come up with a table
for refs to use.

And heck, if you get lucky and find something a km or bigger, if it\'s
in an empty hex between a couple of "good trade" systems, if you can
chart the position well enough, you can establish a new "main". 

This would make misjump more survivable. Still, 1 in 36 *is* too high.

There\'s the Kuiper Belt, which is a ways beyond Pluto. The Oort Cloud

They must have *really* changed the mis-jump rules. In the Traveller
Book, these are the rules:

Throw one die to determine the number of dice thrown (1-6); throw that
number of dice to determine the distance of the misjump in hexes. Then
throw one die to determine the direction of the misjump (one of the six
directions possible on the hex grid). Finally, throw one die to
determine the number of weeks spent in jump space before the ship
re-emerges at its new location.

I hate that sort of idiot. Whenever I or anyone I know has used guns as

we\'ll find old slugs. :-)

Again, he\'s not talking about piracy. He\'s talking about transferring
the software *and* docs, and not keeping a copy. Not only is that
legal, there is legal opinion saying that it\'s not legal for a
"shrinkwrap contract" to forbid it, as it\'d be contrary to the intent
of the copyright act.

I\'m not an "astromer" but my info says the Kuiper Belt is vaguely
defined as 35 AU to 45 AU.  True, Pluto is at an average distance
of 34.9 AU but the first  two  Kuiper  Belt  objects  found  were
Chiron (at 13.5 AU) and Pholus (at 20.4 AU).  That puts a  Kuiper
Belt object between Saturn and Uranus.  Some "astromers" consider
Pluto to be realy just a Kuiper Belt object!  This may seem  like
nit-picking but you have to be careful when you  say  the  Kuiper
Belt is "a ways beyond Pluto", the Kuiper Belt\'s  boundaries  are
_very_ fuzzy.  People have pointed  out  the  falasy  of  densely
packed asteroid belts portrayed by Hollywood, but another  falasy
is the emptyness of interplanetary space.  An  asteroid  belt  is
just a region where you are more likely to encounter an asteroid,
but you can find them anywhere ... and the distinction between an
asteroid, a moon, and a planet is not as clear cut and tidy as it
used to be.

(Just a bit  of  trivia,  I  don\'t  know  what  that  says  about
interstellar space.)

You\'re right. Acceleration = K/d^2.  Sorry I mislabeled it.

Since the integration was rather complicated, I instead generated a large field of
point sources and summed the results.  This gave me a general idea of what the
gravitational acceleration looks like... it wasn\'t uniform with respect to h.

F = mAIts the mass of the ship accelerating differentially that will pull it

My calculations DID include this.  You didn\'t get to the part where I said "do a
surface revolution about the axis of acceleration." (which was conciderably more
complicated than k/r^2)

For the sort of flow rate jump drives need, drop tanks would rupture at the
seals, pipe OR hose.  If you presuppose that drop tanks work in the manner
described (as opposed to the more reasonable, refill your internals/eject/jump
method) then sufficient hoses can reduce the individual flow rates to the point
that they can hold the pressure.

If you include the shooting, this is Oakland, California.  Delete the
shooting but add numerous 20-30 degree hills and you\'ve got San Francisco.

Since I have yo loive here, I think I\'ll let the cops do what they can to

I had to drive into some very scary areas in the very early morning hours

I think I\'ll keep the drop tank concept, IMTU most of the fuel is heated
to plasma, rather than fused, and blown through (very very special)
superconducting coils to create the jump point.  Pumping the fuel through
a long hose and then into the drive would be, I think rather difficult at
the rates needed.  Still, I like the idea of using drop tanks on the big
freighters, it seems reasonable.  The corporations would probably
maintain platforms outside the jump limits of a world, and keep a large
stock of custom tanks for their ships.  They could skim gas giants for
free, and probably provide such tanks for other customers (at a nominal
fee, or course ;)  ).  I like it!

Actually, I\'ve always treated emergency low berths as having a small RTG
(radio-thermal generator) just powerful enough to maintain the berth.  Of
course, the ship is going to die in the intervening time, but hey, its
better than dying out-right yourself!!!!

They did not, I made an error.  After seeing this referenced, I looked it
up and the rule for how far you misjump has never changed and is as listed
below.  The main concern is for the 2- to misjump on any given jump, which
replaces the CT 13+ to misjump.  The fact that a misjump throws you 1-36
hexes reduces the possiblity of a rescue/salvage mission to close to nil.
They have too large an area to search.

Yes but it is done when the scooping occurs and the purification plants pump

Hhhhmmm, GOOD point Leonard.  I actually agree with you but I would like to
make this point; your numbers are the result you get at TL 7/8.  What would
it be at TL 11/12 or better yet TL 15?  It would seem to me by TL 10+ we
would have extremely efficient solar batteries and possibly even a solar
sail type array to produce reasonable amounts of power, possibly even enough
to power some _low_ power COLD storage units.  The units could even get a
boost from the cold of space to augment their requirements.  I believe if a
PC put it to me with some thought involved (depending on his character stats
he might get a GM assist, after all he is still thinking with a year
1990/2000 mentality) I would find my way clear to save the party, if it were
at all possible.  This is after all "Traveler" the role playing game and a
lot of players work very hard to get their characters up to speed.  Why
should I kill them off because of 2 or 3 bad die rolls when its just as easy
to think a problem through and come up with a reasonable hypothesis for a
time 5000 years in the future.  I believe I can do it and stay within cannon
and physics for the most part.  On the other hand if they got here because
they were stupid and thought I would just let them off the hook then they
better break out new character sheets.

Why not burn the fuel in an external jump drive and transfer the energy
through an electrical cable to the ship\'s capacitors? If the fuel really
is used only to generate energy, I don\'t see anything that would preclude
this. The energy has to be conveyed from the drive to the capacitors anyway.
Whether the energy goes through a few hundred meters of cable more or less
seems unlikely to be of consequence.

It\'s this possibility that makes me advocate changing canon slightly to
where most of the fuel is used to facilitate the ship\'s crossover to jump
space.


>If you presuppose that drop tanks work in the manner described (as opposed

Why is that more reasonable? You either use the fuel directly from the drop
tanks (And why it should matter to the jump drive whether its fuel comes
from a drop tank or an internal tank is beyond me, especially since the
drop tanks become internal tanks the moment the captain decides to retain
them for this particular jump) or you use the fuel from the internal tanks
and then delay proceedings for some minutes while you transfer fuel from
the drop tanks to the internal tanks. So the second method requires the
capacitors to store the energy for longer than the first. That makes it
less reasonable IMO.

Someone else mentioned demountable and collapsible tanks. Demountable tanks
function in all ways as ordinary internal tanks as long as the are mounted.
The difference is that demountable tanks can be demounted (;-). Thus fuel
in demountable tanks can be used directly for jumps. Fuel from collapsible
tanks cannot. Apparently the difference lies between rigid and soft tanks.
(Just WHY that should make any difference at all is quite beyond me).

Actually Leonard you are quoting the portion of the actual write-up in the
MT version that deals with misjumps. I will repost portions of a post by
Peter Newman so every one can read it.  Again I spoke too quickly and lucky
you, you caught it.  I tend to think of "Jump Mishaps" when dealing with
misjumps, sorry.  I believe you can see why I might think of them all in one
lump as a misjump , they are after all in the same table (15) and  you have
to get some bad rolls to get there.

By reading this I ass-u-me-d all Jump anomalies fell into the category of
misjump, instead they fall into the category "Jump Mishap".  I see now that
it specifically spells out misjump as a different kind of "Jump Relativity
Error".  My mistake, sorry.

That all depends on the conventions in force at the time and in the place
in question. At some point in a space battle one ship is sufficiently
shot up that the opponent has the unquestioned ability to destroy it. In
some cultures he will also want to. If that is the case, there\'s no problem.
Or the defeated crew may want to blow themselves up rather than surrender,
in which case there\'s no problem either. Or the defeated may be unable to
resist at all, in which case there\'s still no problem. The problem comes
when the winner has the ability to destroy but not to capture and prefers
to capture. That\'s when conduct ceases to be strictly utilitarian and to
move into the realm of convention. Certainly the victim may have the
ability to blow up himself and his attacker if they grabble, but what if
the attacker knows (or thinks he knows) that the defender won\'t go to
such extremes under any circumstances?

IMTU Under the rules of war used by the Imperium and it\'s major neighbors a
helpless ship surrenders the moment it is helpless and under the guns of an
enemy ship. Other conventions may require the attacker to board by force
but require the defenders not to fiddle with the gravity. Or the attackers
may be able to counteract that trick by destroying the deck plates or the
control interfaces or something. But one thing I\'m sure of: If the defenders
of an otherwise helpless ship is able to make it impossible for an attacker
to capture it in the face of opposition, the defending ship will either be
forced to refrain from offering opposition or it will be destroyed. I can\'t
see the victor allowing the loser to just go its merry way.

Jump machinery has a factor of Jump+1 (either percentage or jump units depending
on system you\'re using).  I\'d propose that the +1 portion is burned initially to
form/maintain the jump point/jump tunnel/jump bubble for the trip. The rest of
the fuel is injection mass (or whatever you want to call it).  The injection
mass is what needs to be pure H2, the other portion of the fuel can be
unrefined, as it is only generating energy.

Because *IF* you burn the fuel internally, then you don\'t have to assume that
ALL the fuel is burned at once. Thus you don\'t need the unbelievably high
capacity capacitors. You don\'t run into the question about why they haven\'t been
implemented as weapons. You don\'t have the question of why its so important for
the fuel pure hydrogen... Basically, it eliminates a whole bunch of handwaves.

Losses through the fibre are probably small. Losses getting into the 
fiber might be more substantial but only a few percent. Still, peak power 
through a fibre probably only scales linearly with fiber diameter - and
Traveller weapons lasers have peak power in the 100 gigawatt level,
so you\'d need a fiber ten meters in diameter

"Planning" is probably too strong a word; "vaguely considering based on

That sounds more plausible. 

If recall correctly, in addition to tidal effects, a big deviation from
true zero-gravity in the planned space station is actually drag, since 
it has so much surface area...

If I could do that, I\'d publish it in "Nature", not on the Traveller
mailing list. I can\'t even give you an estimate of how many 60-jupiter-mass
brown dwarfs there are in free space that I trust to better than a factor of
four. Nor can I even say what the density of 1-km objects in our own Kuipter
belt (let alone the Oort cloud) is, though there\'s a very nice LLNL project
that\'s going to look for Kuipter objects via occultations starting up soon. 

What I can do are numbers for the signature (on my sensor scale) of such
objects in free space is - I\'ll work on that sometime next weekend. Then we
can make up convienient densities. IMTU, though, such "free-space" ice
bodies would be pretty rare - rare enough that a random misjump won\'t find
them - otherwise there would be jump refuelling/"calibration point" stations
in every empty hex on the map.

Not quite 100% correct. The "built-in protections" are aspects of the
physical laws of the Traveller Universe. There\'s no need to build
fail-safes into your astrogation computer. You can aim for a point inside
a jump limit, but you get kicked out of jump space somewhere right at the
jump limit if you try  (either at the point directly in line between your
starting jump point and your target point or at a random point around the
gravity source, according to you favorite theory).

This will only work in a stable society and only if not too many people do
it. Otherwise you run the risk that those who are awake and actually
creating the wealth that you expect a chunk of when you wake will change the
rules on you and refuse to play along.

Also, you will be cutting yourself off from all your social connections. How
many people will be willing to do that?

=================================================
1 Most ship do NOT have an extra J1 jumpfuel.
2 There\'s no tendency for ships to exit jumpspace close to stars.
3 There\'s no way to do wilderness refuelling in deep space ie rogue comets
and their ilk are so far apart that sensors cannot pick them up, even if
integrating for long times.
4 There\'s no added skillbonus for Astrogation skill to the 2- roll.

1: My ships generally have and extra J1 but canon ones don\'t so lets say
they haven\'t got that extra life insurance.
2: I don\'t think canon says anything about this but IMTU for a ship to
misjump into interstellar space it has to randomize out into a hex that is
compleately surrounded by other deep space hexes. If there\'s one or more
system hexes adjacent to the misjump one the ship will randimly exit in one
of the system hexes, close to the star.
3: Comets in deep space will be close to 3 Kelvin and therefore hard to
detect on IR. Background starlight might help though. I think that you\'d
have to get really lucky to come within detection distance from a comet
unless a version of point 2 above is working on low masspoints as well ie
even in deepspace you tend to exit near comets, rogue planets and whatnot
(cool adventure possibilities there).
4: My system has MUCH lower propabilities for misjumps if the ship is well
maintained and the astrogator knows what he\'s doing but that is not canon.

Point 2 above will solve the problem and also make gulfs/abysses etc more
dangerous, it also increases the likelihood that PC/NPC may show up systems
they never intended to visit more often which leads to adventure
possibilities.

Are you shure about these figures? I\'m no expert (skill level 0 at best ;-)

Trust me, it\'s not piracy.  It\'s registered, paid for in full, blah, blah,

I don\'t worry with misjumps, except to create adventure situations.  If
the players do misjump, I\'ll have some sort of out, but they\'ll have to
work for it.

Yes, it does, but you are missing information and making snippy remarks
based on it.  I do not have a copy of Terralogicus installed anywhere.  I
removed it from my hard drive.  The only place Terralogicus exists in my
house is on its original disk in its original envelope with its original
documentation, all in a drawer.

Simple enough.  Both styles of tanks are mounted inside the cargo bay.  Collapsable tanks take up less availiable cargo space when they\'re empty.  Dismountable tanks take the same amount of space whether they\'re full or empty. And where does it say you can\'t directly use collapsible tanks directly for jumps?

<snip>

No matter how good your tech is, its hard to see how you can  get
more than  100%  efficiency.  Leonard\'s  "25 nanowatts per square
meter" number is at 100% efficiency (he  quotes  TL  7/8  at  80%
efficiency).

On the subject of "low power  cold  storage  units":  First,  the
energy requirements stated in  the rules  already  take  TL  into
account.  Second, according to a DGP article I read years ago ...
the key to the low berth process is cooling the victim  (sorry, I
mean \'subject\') in such a way that ice crystals  don\'t  form  and
cause massive widespread cell damage (especially to brain cells).
This is achieved by manipulating the atomic forces  in  much  the
same way as nuclear damper  technology  works.  While  \'cold\'  is
often defined as the absence  of  atomic  and  molecular  kinetic
energy, and reducing this kinetic energy is what low  berths  do,
the low berth is perhaps more properly thought of as a  partially
successful stasis device.  If \'natural\'  cold  is  used  ...  ice
crystals ... cells become slush ... subject dies.

(Appologies if I\'ve mis-remembered the DGP article, I don\'t  have
it with me at the moment.)

I agree completely.  I\'m working on a 2300AD\'esque near future game (w/ TNE
rules, of course)...  instead of Galactic, i\'m using the equally excellent
Starmap, also by Jim V.  If you\'re used to Galactic, but want 3D, the

Astrologicus and Terralogicus.  They\'re neat, but I just haven\'t used em much.
I made several suggestions for features, like being able to insert objects (as
is, black holes, neutron stars, etc are all random), but for various reasons
they told me it wasn\'t gonna happen. (They didn\'t want to do a DOS extender,
for example).

    'body' => 'There\'s a thread going on about artificial gravity, and using it to
defend the ship.


From a GMing perspective I believe rapid alterations in gravity are
bad:

Oscillating gravity is a pain in the neck to run.  If the PCs get
detected, anywhere there are grav plates, the first thing NPCs are
going to do is oscillate gravity semi-randomly.  Ditto for PCs
discovering NPCs.  In fact, oscillating gravity is a very good way to
mess people up... so let\'s just put grav plates in other sensitive
installations, even on-planet.

Oh, and someone mentioned dents.  Sure, bones won\'t dent the
bulkheads.  But anything _else_ (including your cargo, if it\'s somehow
gotten loose) will, and you\'re stressing all sorts of things.

So the first thing anyone would do, upon discovering grav plates, is
destroy them, their controls, or the power source, ensuring major (and
expensive) damage.  Yuck.  In fact, even on your _own_ ship you would
want to make sure that the enemy couldn\'t get hold of the controls to
your section....

Then you also have to deal with "how big an area can you oscillate?"

On top of that, everyone ends up needing a high ability in zero-G
maneuvering (because people disable the artificial gravity, rather
than having it used against them).  There\'s no longer anything special
about that skill, everybody gets it/wants it.  

Zero-G is also a hard situation for players and GMs to visualize.



My solution, IMTU (I know enough physics that I\'m not even going to
try and give it a logical explaination):

1. Grav plates are a field effect which occur between pairs of plates,
usually built into the top and bottom of the ship (floor/ceiling).
This effect includes both gravity and compensation for accelleration.

2. When first turned on, plates take time (a few days) to "charge" up
to a certain gravity level.  During this time gravity and compensation
ability very slowly increases.

3. Once charged, they still need power to stay at the same level.

4. If you turn the power off, gravity and compensation slowly
declines, again over a few days, until the plates are no longer having
an effect.  You can\'t get the "charge" out of the plates any other
way.

5. The only way to _rapidly_ change gravity is to damage the plates
(and this can only move gravity towards zero-g).  Minor damage (since
these plates run the length of the ship\'s top & bottom, this includes
making a hole) will have negligible effect - perhaps a slight decrease
in gravity/compensation.  Severely damaging one of a pair, or moving
it away from the other, causes both of them to die in a pretty
semi-melting fashion (no big explosions, or we\'d have a new type of
weapon), resulting in no artificial gravity between them.


Result:
Most ships in use have gravity within them.
Most derilicts don\'t.
No rapid gravity changes (anywhere).

Actually, if we apply Traveller (TNE FFS) tech to it we get an enormous
problem... short range is determined by focal diameter. It maxes at 10(6D(in
meters))^2*TL range factor based on wavelength of light.  At TL 12 its actually
10(5D)^2*100 km for a Far UV laser.  That 1M laser telescope would have a short
range of 25,000 km.  Which makes the Parsecs away distant receiver unreachable.

Due to the differing ways in which FF&S and GURPS Vehicles handle volumes for
turrets, this is not clearly correct (1 dT of turret volume is probably only
250 cf -- turrets in FF&S aren\'t separate subassemblies, they just cause
objects within them to take up extra space).  Given that Vehicles does not give
armor or frame materials volume, in general calling 1 dT 500 cf is probably
incorrect.

There is no evidence for Traveller turrets containing any of these things. 
Also, having multiple AESAs sending out signals will just confuse matters.  Any
TL 8+ radar can track multiple objects simultaneously, just assume that the
main sensor suite on the starship is feeding targeting data to the lasers.

It is not clear if the crewstations for a traveller turret are within the
turret, this seems fairly unlikely (not to mention stupid).  The crewstation
should be within the vehicle itself.

Actually, even power slugs are a bit excessive in traveller terms.  However, a
typical laser turret requires a power plant/1, which at the density of Vehicles
TL10 fusion power plants (assuming access space for a long-occupancy vehicle)
is about 40 MW (it is about 250 MW in T4),

Why would anybody in their right minds want to use a jump engine as a weapon?  
They\'re just too damned expensive to waste in that manner.  Nukes are *MUCH* 
cheaper to use.  According to High Guard rules, jump engines are 4MCr/ton, 
tonnage requirements are Jn+1.  Thus, a Jump 2 ship displacing 500 tons needs 
15 tons of jump engines at a cost of 60MCr.  And the resulting explosion of an 
overloaded set of jump capacitors is *NOT*, repeat, *NOT* a nuclear explosion. 
 It may be enough to vaporise a ship, but that doesn\'t make it nuclear.

Navies have budgets.  That means they don\'t get to buy all the toys they want. 
 Knowing this, which are you going to buy for your 60MCr, one jump drive, or a 
couple dozen nukes?

You miss the point *AGAIN*.

You *CANNOT* form the jump point *UNTIL* you burn the fuel.  That\'s what gives 
you the energy to form it.  That\'s what gets stored in the Zochai crystals.  
If you could form it *WITHOUT* burning the fuel, then why bother burning the 
fuel?

I was thinking about something similar ... what about a dead star
(red dwarf star that faded out) capturing some loose  snow  balls
and forming a dark matter system.  Unfortunatly, this would still
have been detected by interstellar densitometer  scan.  So  there
couldn\'t be a dark system within the Imperium ... not unless some
scout working on the IGS got sloppy ;-).

It was a back-of-the-envelope (based on the fact that I remember once
calculating that the kilowatt laser we used at LLNL for laser guide
star tests would be detectable at Alpha Centauri). As I redo it, I discover
that my memory was wrong and the scaling needs work...it\'s more like a
bit per minute.

A 1 arcsecond beam at 1 parsec is 1 AU across, so the energy density for a
1 kilowatt beam is 4.5*10^-20 watts/m2. (For reference, a zero-magnitude
star is 1.1*10^-12 watts/m2 angstrom, so this is a 21st magnitude star through
a 10-angstrom filter, detectable from the ground with a 1-m telescope in 
about 5 minutes under normal conditions.)
 
Alternatively, at 1 micron wavelengths, a photon has about 1*10^-19 joules
of energy, so this is 0.5 photons per second. A hundred photons per bit
would give you acceptable error rates so this is about 50 seconds per bit,
or 1 bit per minute. (This is higher than the previous paragraph would
imply because we can neglect background light, since the laser is 
monochromatic; although from the ground, scattered light from the target
star is a potential issue.) 

However, if we put the 1-m launch telescope in space, the beam is only 0.2
arcseconds across, so the density goes up to 12.5 photons per second, or 
about 8 seconds per bit. Crank the laser up to 10 kW and you get 1 second
per bit. Make the launch and reciever 2-m telescopes and we\'re up to 1000
photons per second, or 10 bits per second. (At Traveller tech levels it\'s
probably better to add more laser power, though.) About the same as
Galileo back to Earth.

Pursuant to another debate (what happens when you misjump), I\'ll note that
a typical (~10 MW) T4 turret laser is about a tenth magnitude star through a
1-angstrom filter at 1 parsec, easily detectable by an automated all-sky
monitoring system. Old-fashioned High Guard beam lasers (250 MW) are
eighth magnitude, and are naked-eye visible at about a third of a parsec.

Because its reusable.  I\'m not talking about using the jump engine, I\'m talking about
using the energy conversion process that a jump engine uses. If you use the same
process on a weapon you could get an astronomical pulse.

Duh! I\'m arguing that the sheer power generated by the instantaneous conversion of so
much hydrogen is far greater than any reasonable capacitor could hold (reasonable =
less than 7400 times the size of the ship).  If Zuchai crystals are this effective at
storing energy, why aren\'t they used for weapons?

It is nonetheless 100% true for an infinite plate.  It is less true for a
finite plate.  See my previous derivation for a finite one, but you might
well be surprised at just how well a disc of radius r pretends to be an
infinite plate, to the extent needed.  In essence, as long as the radius of
the plate is on the order at least as big as the object in question\'s
length and distance from the disc, and the object does not get too close to
the edge, a flat plate\'s gravity is essentially uniform.

If you get far enough from such a plate, it looks like a point source, as
does ANY object once you get far enough away.

You might wish to get the exact formula.  Reasoning by analogy is not
always reliable.  Halliday and Resnick give a very detailed explanation of
how to derive the gravitational effect of a few surfaces, and a flat plate
is an easy generalization, assuming you do not believe my math.

The key is that D+L, your angle on to the plate is larger than at D, so
even though you are substantially closer to the points at the center of
your disc at D, the contribution in the vertical direction from points near
the horizon is small, and because they exactly balance, even though you are
farther away from any given plate bit, more plate bits are pulling you in
as you get farther away.  This breaks down as soon as edge effects become
important, but that happens surprisingly late, even for a relatively small
plate.  Shefflied, for example, used a disc that produced ~ 50Gs at the
center, and which was only a few hundred meters across for a series of
stories.

At the same time as the amount of mass seen is approaching infinity, the
pull that is in the "towards the center of the disc" (which I have been
calling vertical) direction is dropping to zero.  As a result, exactly what
happens depends on geometry.  For a plane, they exactly cancel, while an
infinite wire falls off as a log.

It does, and you can work out the math fairly easily as long as you
remember that any pull which is cancelled by another pull does not matter,
and any pull that is not towards the plate vanishes via symmetry.

That\'s right.

In *military* situations, mine works much the same way. All the local
powers have a convention of taking prisoners and treating them
*reasonably* well.  While a crew (the officers naturally) think they can
repair and escape or continue fighting they will, but with the choice of
certain destruction and capture will opt to "save lives" and surrender. 
Of course, *some* officers might be the type to take their ship down
with them and won\'t surrender for any reason, their ships would be
destroyed if defeated. It might even be a situation where the defeated
ship is called on to surrender, its Captain refuses, abandons ship and
destroys it himself.  A trick like accepting surrender terms then
exploding your ship when the opponent grapples, or destroying yourself
without warning while grappled could very well be a capital war crime
and survivors of such acts would be treated like criminals not captured
sailors.

If it\'s a private attacker, ie pirates, things aren\'t quite so
civilized. Pirates want to capture ships and their cargos, the parts of
the ship not destroyed are valuable even if they can\'t repair and use
the captured ship, after all. Because they really don\'t want the ship
destroyed they are going to be more willing to board a disabled ship
than just stand off and blow it up.  Merchants are going to be more
willing to surrender (or at least not destroy their ship) if they expect
a fate better than death for doing so, too.

I can\'t either. A gallant crew that fights a good fight, then surrenders
might be taken to a friendly (or neutral port) rather than a POW camp,
but they won\'t keep their ship. They might be offered a place in the
crew/navy that captured them, who knows if the same kind of loyalty
toward nation states exists in the 35th century! 
All this depends on the accepted rules of war for the time and place of
your campaign. They don\'t have to be late 20th century rules, they can
be whatever rules you want them to be.

Not to get too deep into the piracy morass, but, those sorts of blanket
\'Oops you looked at it, you can use it but you don\'t own this copy\' sorts
of licenses have _never_ held up in court. You are allowed to sell your
copy of the program to one other person, provided you destroy all copies
in your posession _or_ transfer them to the new owner.

Some software companies have tried to shut down some used software shops
on that basis, and the courts slapped \'em down. Same thing was tried with
records, videos and CD\'s with the same results...if you pay money for a
recording (sofware, video or music) the courts (at least in the US) have
consistently held that you own that copy and can sell it as you wish, just
so long as you don\'t retain a copy. 

_Renting_ it, on the other hand, that\'s a different kettle of fish.

That was sarcasm.
A TL 12  Fusion reactor consumes .15 kL per MW  power in one year
A 100 DT Jump 1 vessel uses up 140 kL fuel (double that for CT I think)
That amounts to  29,030,400,000 Mj
The jump drive takes up 2% of the tonnage or 28 kL
Assuming zuchai crystals make up 100% of the drive, they can store a TRILLION Mj per
kL.
A TL 21 (twenty one) HPG can only store 200 Mj per kL.
So if zuchai crystals are THAT much more efficient at converting/storing energy, why
aren\'t they used for weapons?

Cost?  Lets see...
TL 12 Zuchai Crystal/jump drive: .3Mcr per KL for a Trillion Mj = .0003 cr/Mj
TL 21 HPG: .01 Mcr per KL for 200 MJ = 50 cr/Mj
No, not cost...

Storage time?
Zuchai crystals have to be discharged quickly while HPG\'s can hold their charge for a
long time... But so what, you\'re storing your energy as H2 which will store
indefinitely.
No, not Storage time...

I\'m doing this from memory, and might be wrong, but Kuiper Belt 20 to

Its not totally converted to energy IMTU.  Only a small fraction of the
hydrogen is fused by the engine, and this power is used to generate a
high temperature plasma, which is blown through superconducting rings
(Zuchai crystals?) to create the jump point.  The rings are a very
particular mix of ceramics and metals, very hard to produce, and the only
result of charging them (via the magnetic fields of the plasma) is the
opening of a jump point.  Useless as a weapon.  The use of hydrogen
plasma to do this is required because the plasma, at a particular
temperature, resonates the rings to open jump space.  Any other element
won\'t do it, and impurities in the hydrogen can result in unstable points
opening.  So, if you don\'t mind the breeze my hands are making, thats how
jump drives work IMTU.

Ooh ooh. I can answer this one.

Even TL advances shouldn\'t ignore the basic laws of physics. The highest
efficiency a high-tech solar array could get would be slightly less than
100%. The problem is not technological capability but rather just the
amount of available energy per unit area. That far out, there just isn\'t a
lot to be had.

the target doesn\'t need to be at short range (or even extreme range);
those are just convienient markers at which the intensity has dropped to 
1/1 - 1/4 - 1/16 - 1/64 of full intensity. Since we only need to get 
10^-20 or so of input intensity on the target to communicate, you can
communicate well past short range. (And, since the beam spreads quite a bit,
hitting the target is actually quite easy.)

L is NOT the length of the ship in my post.  L is the disc radius.  The
largest difference will happen when the nose of the ship is touching the
plate, and the back is at height h, so your tidal effects are revealed in
the deltaFy formula.

To requote my final results:

In other words, as long as the radius of the disc is larger than the length
of the ship in any meaningful way, you will have no real tide problem.

Very well.  I am going to use densities far smaller than a black hole.  Use
material with a density of 10e11 Kg/M^3.  (A million times denser than
iron.)  For sake of argument, lets use a 2 meter thick disc a hundred
meters across.

> Fy = 2 Pi G M s p (1 - 1/(f^2+L^2))

Let us first see what force we would feel standing at the center.

= 2 Pi 6.67e-11 1 2 10e11 (1 - 1/100^2))

= 84 N, or about 8 gravs.

Now, how big is the tidal force.  Remember, this disc is only twice as
large in radius, more or less as your 51 meter ship, so we are talking a
physical object or magical field not much bigger than the ship\'s near space.

> deltaFy = 2 Pi G M s p [ -h^2/(L^2 h^2+L^4) ]

h = 51, L = 100

deltaFy = 2 Pi G M s p [ - 51^2/( 51^2 * 100^2 + 100^4)]
deltaFy = 84 * [2601 /(2601*10,000 + 100,000,000)]
deltaFy = 84 * [2601 /(2601 + 10,000)]
deltaFy = 84 * 0.2064

or about 1.7 gravs.  Uncomfortable?  Yes, but this is for a situation where
h is pretty near to L.  Let L be something reasonable, and you can get
whatever small tides you care about.  I, personally, would want to make
sure that my design had L at least four or five times h.

Let me emphasize that - this is a ridiculous configuration if you care
about tidal stress, and you _still_ do not get unreasonable tides.

>The big problem is that if you generate a gravity field,
>that field decreases in strength inversely with the square of the distance.

Only if you limit yourself to point sources without geometry.  Put those
sources in an arrangement, and you can get virtually any field
configuration you like.

You cannot work this way, unless you are also willing to account for the
component of the force that is radial.  You might want to just look up the
appropriate integration technique, since getting numerical integration to
work is exciting at the best of times, and it is not always obvious how to
best approximate a continuous world with a discrete simulation.

YES!  Very important point.

Then your general idea is not accurate.  (NB - we know this by doing the
integral, and seeing what the correct answer is.  If an approximation does
not simplify to the known good results in the infinite cases, then it is
likely giving you unusual answers for the finite case we care about.)

Much of that complication, though, came about as a result of the coordinate
system.  Use polar coordinates, and the distance of an element of mass dm
becomes easier.  Then, once you make sure that you count only the radial
effects, not the transverse ones, you should be OK.  In your surface of
revolution, you did not, IIRC, take the directional nature of the force
into account.

       y

x1         x2

Only the vertical component of the forces exerted by x1 and x2 matter, so
you do need that angle.  The horizontal components cancel, and I seem to
recall that your surface of revolution produced a difficult integral, which
a coordinate change would fix, and did not include only the proper component.

This is very close to 19th-century naval ettiqute; ships that have been
battered into helplessness - or are just massively overmatched - would
"strike their colours" and surrender. Captured crews would be treated 
reasonably well - officers that have "given their parole" would be 
probably be given moderate freedom to move around the capturing ship. 
In some cases captured officers who had given their parole would be allowed
to go back to a friendly port, as long as they agreed not to perform 
actual military service until such a time as they were "exchanged" for an
equivalent psedo-prisoner. 

Since Traveller starships will tend not to explode but just get mission-killed
(like a wooden sailing ship tends not to sink but just get crippled) this
behaviour will probably be fairly common in Traveller universes...or at least
IMTU.

Oh, no...having driven in all three, I can DEFINITELY state that Bahston
drivers are in a class of their very own. NOWHERE on the planet have I
seen such anarchy on the roads. Green means go, yellow means go faster,
and red means floor it, you might still make it through. At least SF and
Oakland have stoplights.  You\'ve never driven insanely till you\'ve hit a
Boston traffic circle.

Wait... let me get this straight...
Your ship is flying parallel to this disk?
At a given height above said disk gravity will be uniform?

MY ship is flying PERPENDICULAR to this plane, i.e. falling nose first into the
gravitational plane.

I think we\'ve been arguing two entirely different things.  Yes my formula was
wrong, because I was not flying parrallel but perpedicularly to the ship.  Yes, at
a given height above an infinite plane, gravity will be uniform.

But that isn\'t my argument... If you fly AT a gravitational plane, your nose will
accelerate faster than your tail.  At sufficient gravities, heights and ship
lengths, this tidal force will rip the nose off your ship. THAT is my argument.

Thats 100% efficiency for what we make them out of today.  Who\'s to
say what they will be made from 5000 years from now.  To assume that
the ability to get more from less doesn\'t exist in the future is like assuming
that there isn\'t any other planets in the entire universe with intelligent life on
them.  Thanks, I\'d rather not if you don\'t mind.  Maybe my imagination is a
little off skew here but I just find it very hard to believe that we will still be
using silicon for CPU\'s in 5000 years.  Based on that what will solar batteries
be made of.  Hell I don\'t know but then again I don\'t believe you do either. I
know its difficult for you to make that quantum leap here out of the year 1998
but I bet you can do it if you just try.  Don\'t throw todays physics at me either,
I don\'t think all todays rules will be in effect then.  They have made HUGE
leaps in physics in just the last 35 years so I think there will be a few more
surprises over the next 5000, what do you think....

Lets see, your already frozen and gone thru the manipulation to be
"cryo-suspended".  I\'ll bet there is a chance that a little space cold
which is somewhere around -3 k won\'t have any effect what so ever
since you\'ve already gone well past the ice crystal stage.  Does that
theory have any merit what so ever.  I say theory because as far as I
know its never been tested to see if in fact there is some little dreg of
fluid left in your that didn\'t get frozen so that it might become a crystal.
Another thing about this is, only the cells that get ice crystals die, not
the whole body.

If I seem a little testy its because this is a game and as game masters
and players we should be doing things that help our fellow PC\'s to stay
alive.  Our job isn\'t to kill them off willy nilly, its to let them and us
have

Like I said in another reply, what if solar panels were made from something

entirely and then you have another complete set of characteristics to get to

Do you think computer CPU\'s are going to be made out of silicon in the

That doesn\'t change the fact that its still have a computer now does it?

No it\'s not.  If the results of a misjump is \'ship destroyed\', *THE SHIP IS 
DESTROYED*.  What part of this *DON\'T* you understand?  The \'energy conversion 
process\' *NEEDS* that expensive equipment to *PRODUCE* the jump effect.  If it

equipment?  If the ship is *destroyed*, what\'s left to re-use?  Which parts of 
this are you having problems understanding?

And what the hell is \'an astronomical pulse\'?

Who says it\'s instantaneous?  Where did you read this?  Under the CT Book 2 
rules, you declared you were going to jump, then you jumped on the next turn, 
20 minutes later.  In the Starship Operator\'s Manual, part of the jump drive 
equipment is \'a small high-energy fusion reactor\', which burns the jump fuel 
*fast*.  Fast is not instant.  And considering that a high speed burn would be 
rougher on a reactor than a normal burn, it gives a canonical reason for the 
annual maintanance fees because you\'re relining the inside of your jump drive 
reactor, among other things.

And which ruleset gives you the figures that the Zochai crystal bank is 
1/7400th of the size of the ship?  *PLEASE* don\'t tell me it\'s GURPS.

It seems to me that the fuel in whatever extra storage you carry could
be transferred to the main tank (limited only by capacity) at the same
time as the jump routine was being initiated. This would avoid any major
time requirements for dumping or ejecting useless baggage before jump.
My reading of the rules does not infer that going to jump is a major
undertaking requiring total dedication by all the crew and power
supplies, and multitasking must be commonplace by this time.

	now lets think they have some short range KKMs left on board,
	they just want to fight some time (for repair) or they are
	playing an other bad tricky thing. For this reason the "winning"
	party want to be sure, and has to act with caution. Typical they
	ask that the surrenderer is taking a stable orbit, or that they
	have to drift and to power down. A vessel that announce to surrender
	during a larger battle, could be counted as a win even if they manage
	to repair and jump out without being boarded. For this reason a
	surrender is often prevendet by fleet command. A ship has to show
	flags up, just to stay a target for the enemy and to prevent the
	opponent to concentrate fire on more potent vessels. Small ships
	like the Gazelle has seperations of crew and officiers to prevent
	mutiny in such situations.

	After the battle is done, the surrendered will be asked for a body
	swap. They have to send some officiers (not all) out by thuster
	packs, and have to accept a prise (sp?) crew (german:Priesenbesatzung).
	By just sending 1-3 officers (depending on size of the ship) as
	bodyswap to arrange the surrender over a long distance (sometimes
	8 light seconds, as most captains wont even risk a shipsboat ;-)
	the risk, that the surrender is a bad trick is reduced.

> Captured crews would be treated reasonably well

	if the enemy is known to kill PoW\'s or to sell them to slavery
	a surrender is less likely. Last times my players had to surrender,
	they found theirselfs on board of the DD-Midu. Now they have a

As someone said, inner Kuiper belt objects have been found at around 20 AU.
No-one really knows where the outer edge is; the Kuipter belt is a largely
theoretical constracut, based on arguments about solar system formation
(the apparent density of the protosolar disk seems pretty smooth out to 
Neptune, so there could well be lots of mass past Neptune\'s orbit) and 
comets (the Kuiper belt is a "resevoir" for medium-short period comets. 
You\'d expect it to trail off by 100 AU, but that\'s a fuzzy number.

The Oort cloud is even more hypothetical - no object out in the Oort cloud
has ever been detected, nor is one likely to be in the near future - but
again is based on comet statistics, as a "resevoir" for long-period comets.
No-one knows what the edge of it is, though there are lots of comets
with periods of several million years => Oort cloud at least 40000 AU out.
Probably much past 40-100,000 AU it gets disrupted by other stars.
So, on the whole, a given star\'s Kuiper belt is fairly tightly associated
with the star, and the Oort cloud does extend past the edge of the star\'s
hex (=bad news for misjumped people.)

Another misjump note: most people seem to assume that when you come out of
misjump in an occupied hex you\'re suitably close to the the star in that
hex to reach it easily - which (if true) implies some tendancy for misjumps
to "seek out" gravity wells.

And one copy it will remain, only on a different computer. He is not copying the
product, he is just selling something he isn´t using. Otherwise, everybody selling any
used software-product would be pirating it. That however sets the limit too high. When
you buy the product, you can also later sell it. Otherwise the purchaser of a software
product would be at a severe disadvantage to the buyer of any other product.
Piracy is copying and distribution software to others, not selling your olny, legally
bought copy (as long as you don´t keep a copy on your drive)

Postulate whatever tech you like, but if you want to use any kind of solar
cells, then you cannot get more power out of them than there is solar power
to retrieve.

In an empty hex, there is very little sunlight.  Even if we captured every
possible erg of energy, we cannot get more power than the surrounding stars
radiate.  Leonard figured out 25 nanowatts, and I am willing to believe the
number since he rarely screws up data like that, but if you do not, it is
not that hard to discover the total energy radiated by the sun, and then
work out what it would look like from a parsec away.

If there are only 25 nanowatts out there, then no matter what you make your
solar cells from, you cannot get more than that out.  For more than that,
you need to either bring your own power, or postulate a magic energy
machine which produces power from nothing.  Sheffield has made such a
machine the basis of a number of stores, but it leads to very different
results from Traveller.

No.  The disc is slapped on the front of the ship, since that gives you the

Yes, at

Above an infinite plane, gravity is uniform.  It does not involve distance
from the plate.  Even above a finite plane, the results is still very close
to uniform.  Your formula does not seem to take direction into account, but
I have not completely analyzed it.

>But that isn\'t my argument... If you fly AT a gravitational plane, your

argument.

At sufficient gravities, but at those gravities, you are already
experiencing extreme gees of plain old non tidal acceleration.  For
rational levels, you will see very little tide.  My example was a 50 meter
long ship with the nose touching the center of a disc a hundred meters in
radius.  In this case, it is accelerating at 10G towards the plate (just
before it slams into it) and is experiencing a net tidal acceleration of 2
gees.  Even this worst case is likely not going to be able to shred the
vessel.

If the vessel is more reasonable, like a 10 meter vessel, then the field is
uniform to all practical purposes.

Well, see, 100% efficiency isn\'t likely -- the laws of thermodynamics allow
such a reversible system (I think), but it\'s doubtful that it would ever be
achieved in the real physical universe. Of course, this is science fiction,
sooo...

...Even if you *could* get 100% efficiency, I think the point was that
there is so little energy available to be harnessed by solar arrays that
far out that it wouldn\'t matter. If there is only a few hundred nanowatts
(oh heck, let\'s say a few tens of thousands of nanowatts :-) of energy
available, that\'s not enough to do anything with, even if you harness all
of \'em.

Surely you are not proposing a power plant with a greater than 100%
efficiency (a la perpetual motion machine). 8^O

The part where you assume that I\'m using the jump energy to jump rather than as a weapon
like I said in the first place.

Umm... the ship isn\'t destroyed.  You never jump. You use the same technology that creates
the energy pulse for the jump to generate a pulse for a weapon. In fact, there may not even
be a ship.

The part where you think I\'m talking about turning a ship into a bomb rather than using the
technology inherent to generating that power as a powersource for a weapon.

Instantaneous in the sense that you have a few  seconds to fire it off after clearing the
drop tanks.

I read it here on this list, where everyone (well, not everyone) is saying  that drop tanks
work that way.

Using some math involving reactor power production, fuel consumption, etc. The Fusion
Reactor would have to be 7400 times the size of the ship to use up that much fuel in 10
seconds.  Divide that by 120 to get a 20 minute charge and you\'d need a reactor 62 times
the size of the ship. That\'s just for jump 1.

Mathematics. TL 12 fusion reactors burn .15 kl fuel per MW in a YEAR
A jump 1 100dT ship burns 140 kl (x2 in CT I think)
That would be 140 kL/ .15 kL/MW-year * 360 days/year *24 hours/day * 3 turns/hour =
24,192,000 MW fusion Reactor. At TL 12 a kL reactor produces 2 MW of power, thus the
reactor would have to be  12,096,000 kL or  864,000 dTons or 8640 times the size of our
100dT ship.

Man, you said.  I live at Packard\'s Corner and have had 2 near-death experiences
from hostile drivers.  Recently, One guy drove down the area where you wait for
the T.  He was almost on the tracks!  If I hadn\'t seen the reflected sunlight,
there is no way I could have gotten out of the way in time.  I was seeing the
whole life flash thing.  Its a good thing my favorite pub was only 20 yards away.

I love the absence of stop signs in residential neighborhoods.  You take your life
in your hands.   Especially  since all the corners are blind, no visibility.  So,
of course, no one wants to risk being slow at the wrong time, so floor it!

With all due respect - you have not seen insane until you\'ve stepped on the
streets of Naples, Italy. Parking lights are the rule at night, you are rude if
you use headlights with oncoming traffic.  Traffic lights are advisory, not
mandatory.  I never did figure out the rules for right of way, I think it has
something to do with speed, value of car, size of bumper, and throw weight of
your cojones (or the female hormone equivalant).

Fortunately, they seem to have some fairly bloodthirsty laws regarding
pedestrians, you could always tell who was a tourist - they looked before
stepping out into the streets.

I\'ll bow to Leonard and your explanations and I DO UNDERSTAND what your
saying about not able to harvest what don\'t exist.  Maybe I hand waved to
the unknowing but the heart was in the right place.  Having admitted my lack
of caring whether or not there were enough erg\'s to save up lets move into
my original direction.  I didn\'t want to leave my PC\'s stranded in total
desolation with nothing to look forward to but death.  How would we get out
of this predicament if we found ourselves in it.  I felt that the simplest
solution would be to find a quick and dirty answer to keep the game moving.
Since everyone insists this isn\'t possible, can I do something with the
normal trappings of a starship.  Would un-rolling a thin metal cable to drag
behind the ship about three kilometers long, produce enough electricity to
charge the batteries.  Can _small_  fusion power plants run (intermittently)
off of the maneuver fuel for a couple of years to charge the batteries?
Would sails (ala generation ships) produce power?  Help me here please.
There certainly must be a way to survive the experience and I would like
several options if possible.  I am asking too much?

	Then your "general idea" is completely wrong. Sorry, but either do
the integration, review the integration that was already done for you
in a previous post, pick up a college physics textbook, or accept
what the professionals on this list are trying to tell you. For an
infinite plate, the gravitational attraction does NOT depend on the
distance from the plate. Period. Dot. Physics and mathematics don\'t
give a flying leap what your spreadsheet tells you--if you have an
approximation and an exact solution, and the approximation gives
results 180 degrees away from what the exact solution says, the
approximation isn\'t valid.

	This will be my last post on this subject, as I can beat my head
against brick walls at work just as well, and at least be doing my
job.

If what Trisen, and Leonard, were refering to was technology I\'d agree with
you, but I think they are refering to the photon density at those ranges.
No matter how good the technology is it is going to be *very* hard to get
more energy out of a photovoltic cell than 100% of the energy actually
hitting the cell. ;->

Why don\'t you postulate some way of pulling energy from the vacuum? Some
theories predict terajoules of energy lurk in every cc of space...pulling
*any* of it out is probably a *looooog* shot, but a cosmic energy source is
interesting to think about.

The volume of 1 dton is only relevant to the size of the modular socket: 3
dtons in the last two versions of Traveller.  The configuration of the
turret beyond this point conforms to VE2, as the various versions of
Traveller do not agree on the specifics.

This is an attempt to model the (much-debated) "beam pointer" from TNE in a
fashion that makes sense under VE2.  Although one could just as easily
assume that the ship to which the turret must be attached will provide the
sensors necessary, I intended it to be as self-contained as possible.  It
is not clear that a standard ship design without weapons (but with sockets)
would include the expense of sensors with the necessary range.

TNE, p. 348:
"Each [turret or barbette] weapon includes a fire control workstation for a
gunner and may either be fired from the turret/barbette workstation or
patched into a master fire director (if the ship has such a device." 

The illustration of a "Laser Socket" on p. 349 also clearly shows the
"Gunner\'s Station".

The point is again modularity - one doesn\'t have to install a gunner\'s
station on a ship that doesn\'t have (yet) have weapons.  On warships, the
station still serves as a backup if the central fire control system goes
off-line.

The specifics of the GURPS space combat system dictate a rate of fire of
only one shot (possibly of multiple pulses) per 10-minute combat turn, so
higher power levels are not necessary.  A GURPS power slug is a reasonably
good model (and one that has been discussed before on GURPSnet) for the
energy storage density of a TNE laser rifle\'s backpack HPG.  I intended to
avoid lengthy debates on the relative differences between energy storage
technologies in GURPS and the various Travellers.

   The Original Fire, Fusion, and Steel said that the "jump fuel" was used
partially as coolant, partially as fuel (presumably for a reactor of some
kind), and partially as displacement mass.  What\'s wrong w/ everyone getting a

   Besides, we know that HPGs are only 35% of the jump drive.  The zuchai

that the zuchai crystals are not the whole thing.

It\'s a tough call.  Some people don\'t like anyone using the TML to sell
stuff, others have no problems with it.  I don\'t have a problem with it,
but I can see how others could find it annoying.

My own opinion? If you\'re just selling stuff straight, post a message with
the stuff you\'re selling, and do the rest by personal e-mail. If you\'re
auctioning, I would say post the announcement and then the final bids a
little bit later and that\'s it.  If it\'s overly long, and you\'re selling
huge heaping gobs of stuff, then announce it and set up a simple web page,
or post to the rpg marketplace newsgroup.

This is probably one of the better places to pawn off old Traveller stuff,
for obvious reasons. Just don\'t annoy people with too many posts.

Well, if you don\'t want to have it be possible to find a snowball, then you
*do* have a couple of possibilities.

1. If lowberths are *cold* sleep, then once the corpusicles have chilled,
it should be possible to lower the temperature down to nearly 3k..seeing as
you are in deep space..and maintain it with only occasional checks and
tweaks from the program running the lowberth.  With an RTG built into each
berth you could drift for centuries...if you want to say you can. 

2. Don\'t allow jumps to *dead* space, even misjumps. Just say you can only
jump to the vicinity of a gravity source. Jumps into "empty" hexes are
really within a few AU of a rouge black or brown dwarf, or buned out
cinder. Does this mean you could build refueling stations in "empty"
hexes...yes, and that does affect the game. Then again, some "empty" hexes
*are* empty and no ship can jump into that hex, period.

Just a couple of ideas.

I read these last summer and discussed them on the list a little bit.  I very
much liked them.  Very useful for a Traveller Campaign.  The sequels are
supposed to comeout this month.

That bitek, polyp stuff definitely bears investigation.  I also like the
ancient hulk of a space city, whatever it was called.

This is the prototype for my effort to do this with every career, so
criticism and comments are welcome.  If it seems to work alright, it
shouldn\'t take long to post the rest.  (And, yes, I did come up with a
way to do advanced year-by-year chargen for the non-military careers.)

Please take a look at

http://portcaddo.com/bloo/traveller/highgard.htm

[Note:  some references may be obscure to those without T4.1 beta stuff,

but it should be reasonably clear.]

Although much of it is taken directly from High Guard, I\'ve made some
compromises and changes.

For simplicity\'s sake, as well as consistency, I\'ve collapsed the number

of branches to five, combining Battle and Strike.  Assignments are
likewise limited to 6 in number.  This 5 branches, 6 assignment setup is
consistent thoughout all of the careers.

And I\'ve added an Intelligence branch.  It has a strong emphasis on
Military Intelligence, as opposed to James Bond (Its more M.I.5 than
M.I.6.), but that option is available.

I\'ve combined Technical Services and Engineering Branches.  While I
understand the distinction between them, since T4 created the Technical
Cluster, I see little reason to have distinct chargen purposes.  Also,
the T4.1 beta material envisions some cross-over application of
Engineering and Technical skills.

I\'ve eliminated the roll to see if a skill is obtained.  CT was quite
stingy in giving out skills.  Mercenary and High Guard were much more
generous, especially in the Special Duty Schools.  I believe Marc has
stated that characters should average 1.25 skills per year in Chargen.
Certainly this is true in T4 and T4.1.

It isnt quite as good news for Free Trader crews, because if the Free
Trader is built for low cost, it isnt likely to have many more than 2Gs of
grav compensation (more probably one gee worth).

It\'s the military boys who get the really serious grav plates ...

Over the late summer Auckland (our biggest city) was without power in it\'s
Central Buisiness District for a number of weeks. All four (I think) of the
main power cables died in the unusually hot whether we had, and it took out
six weeks to rig an emergency replacement. The CBD was basically closed by
this.

There has been a lot of fuss over this, as the electricity suppliers were
privatised a few years ago, and many people have blamed greed and poor
maintenence practices for the blackout. Apparntly the lines were old and
should\'ve been replaced, but the company, Mercury Energy, was gambling they
would hold out until other improvements and developments come online in the
next few years. Having lost that gamble they are currently trying to avoid
paying compensation to the various buisinesses that were damaged or went
under as a result of the CBD closing.

Preperation is the most obvious solution.

Let us assume that misjumps are fairly frequent, and they tend to strand
you in deep space.

First solution is misjump insurance. It\'s a risk, it\'s quantifiable, so you
can pay someone else to take it.

Let us assume our friends at Lloyd\'s (a coffee shop frequented by scouts,
merchant bankers and other such lowlifes) get the report of a ship that
didnt report in to where it should. This means one of the merchant bankers
is about to give someone a *lot* of money, unless he can find the ship.

Now, our banker friend turns to his scout friends and says "Ship x went
missing jumping from Y. There is cold million in cash to whoever finds them".

Now the sneaky bit ... merchant baker writes out the cheque to the ships
owners. Over the next three or so years, his scout friends do what they do
well.

Then they stop partying and hunting ardalopes, and the search goes out for
the lost ship, in all the empty hexes that the ship could be in.

Lets rewind three years ... ship crew realises they have misjumped and
turns off the fusion plant, and turns on the crude, effective, reliable TL8
1 MW fission plant. It has fuel for 20 years (2m3 worth), but is 10m3 size.

The crew of 8 bail into 2 emergency low berths (56m3), and turn on the 1000
AU radio transmitter.

Now, the fission plant keeps running for the next 20 years, transmitting a
radio signal (how powerful is 200 kilowatts, anyway ?).

Scout ship jumps into the empty hex 3 years later, and picks up the signal,
then goes home and comes back with a tanker.

Now, the new owner of the ship (the merchant banker) then finds someone to
sell it to ...

No, I really don\'t have a good idea on this one.  Some people theorise that
the effects seen in cold fusion experiments are somehow extractions of a
little of this zero-point energy.  Most people don\'t acknowledge that cold
fusion experiments have *any* positive results, but that\'s beside the
point.

I\'d *love* to see a handwave for this from somebody.

I\'ll give you a handwave after I ingest huge quantities of the
hallucinogenic strain of \'drug drug\' and read through the collected works
of Jack Kirby, specifically the stuff that _he_ actually wrote in the late
60s and early 70s.







(For those of you who don\'t get this joke. The late, great Jack Kirby is
one of the most beloved comic book artists of all time. He created a number
of unique characters, and illustrated many more. He\'s famous for his blocky
high contrast work, specifically on stuff like the Silver Surfer. At any
rate, when he was allowed to write stuff, look out. His words, as
nonsensical as they seem to be, have an amazing and wonderful poetry to
them. "Cosmic power" was one of his favorite subjects, with technogods
drawing on it to fight each other)

See my previous messages. Run the fusion plant on low (it\'ll last for
decades or centuries at TNE/T4 fuel consumption levels.) Use a 
weapons or comm laser to signal for help to nearest system. Wait for
help to arrive and hope it\'s the ISS, not local pirates.

Or, if you\'re an exceptionally kind GM, or wedded to CT/MT fuel
consumption, let them find a "snowball" before their fuel goes out. For
added nastiness, make it a pirate or smuggler base.

It actually seemed like a fairly travelleresque milleu - loose 
interstellar government, shady independent traders/smugglers/mercs making a
living with their small ships in the shadows of the big navies and
corporations, etc. More like CT before HG in that small trader ships
could be combat-significant...Of course, there\'s more sex and magic
than most Traveller campaigns have.

The descriptions of ships hiding from each other were a influence on my
Definitive Sensor Rules.

And I\'ve been thinking about FFS2 rules for the Voidhawks (biological
starships...)

in a climate controlled building), I see gated communities, a lot a razor
wire, and a lot of private security guards.  Hmmm...I saw the same thing in
LA too...

  Or, combat armour and a GL with HEAP grenades w/o frag casings. One
section of plate = one grenade. High energy weapons work better.

  Of course, given the potential for organized resistance to prepare
a death trap with emplaced or prepped weapons, I\'d simply blast the

  Obviously the cultural factor will be predominant, but another possibility
is that warship crews will be expected to continue to operate to the ships
limits until they abandon/scuttle or catastrophically disassemble. While a
ship unable to repair offensive ability might be restricted to using PD fire
near it (or doing rescue work) only a ship unable to fight but able to flee
would escape without drawing too much fire.

  It might be that maneuver damage would be the most lethal (particularly
if fighting while effectively unable to Jump); using realistic targetting
solutions such a ship is wearing a "kick me" sign of astronomic proportions,
and if using vector map displays an immobilized ship would be easy to cut
out, isolate, and destroy in detail.

Make sure that your TL 6 planet used to be a TL 3 planet so you can be
sure their roads are laid out over old cow paths.

I should note that I have not had any problems driving in Boston as long
as I do so between 2:30 AM and 6 AM, maybe you could try an early

Actually I just sent this post in for Wil Hostman, a TMLer who can\'t

made a similar post if he had not done so.

I prefer the MT and TNe misjup systems because they make most jumps
safe.  I believe most jumps _need_ to be safe for us to get the levels
of interstellar travel we see.  When starships cost tens of millions of
credits they need to be pretty reliable for tvravel to be economically
justifiable.

If you want to arrange amisjump just have them chased by faster hostile
forces that outgun the players about ten to one & who are not likely to
accept surrender.  Most sensible players will engage the jump drive no
matter how far out they are - after all they have a better chance of
surviving it.

Well actually I think that this idea is far more horrifying if _people_
are commiting genocide for jump fuel than if Virus is doing it.  The
really scarry part about it is that this might be the done by people who
were not monsters if, for example, they had vital parts necessary for
repairing the reactor on their home planet, a failing world with
millions of people on it.  Do you kill thousands you do not know or let
millions, including everyone you love, die ?

I don\'t know but it is Traveller canon that they do.  In world
generation for some major alien races you are instructed that if the
world is vaccum and the TL is 7 or less that you should change the
population to 0 and the starport to E.  You do not have to do this in
the Imperium, obviously due to the superiority of human beings who
apparently do not require water to live on in the 57th century. <ducks
rapidly>

In Hard Times planets with low tech levels and bad biosperes are
destined to end up unpopulated.  The logical inferance is that these
planets could support themselves without a local biospere as long as
their tech level was high enough & interstellar trade & commerce was
common.  In Hard Times neither of those conditions may be true anymore.

This one took me some time, but here it is.
First, thank you for giving your help. To complete my TNS Helpfile i need
the articles from Challenge 63, 65, 67, as all other I\'ve got via internet
or own CHellenge issues. Also helpful would be a list of which article was
published in which issue of JTAS and Challenge, so I can update the index
of the articles. I\'ll include also TNS articles from adventures published
in those magazines, but with the addition that it comes from one. (So even
a 990\'s article came with this ...)

I wonder what\'s the best way to get those articles. Plain ASCII would help
much, as I only have to transfer it into the .rtf file which contains the
other ones. Hardcopys would also go, it only will take some time for me
to type them in or make an OCR and proofreading.

I also thought about collecting the CInet news form the New Era, but there
are more missing issues, so this will have to wait.

I remember a JTAS Amber Zone, \'Thought Waves\' in which the PCs have to
fetch some scientists out of Zhodani occupied space. They got a problem by
themselves, as the Zhos are tortured by occasional brainache no one has an
explanation for. The unconcealment of this reasons for getting the
scientists out fits into the 5th frontier war scenario it was designed
for.

I played with the idea of using the \'Critical Vector\' JTAS szenario and

Hey! How bout this?  I live in Tennessee, you know, we just had a nice
line of tornadoes in the last few days.  Your PCs are on a planet, when a
tornado drops on the starport!!  Hmmmm, wonder if a Type S scout could be
picked up? At the very least, their ship could be damaged from flying
debris (Golly gee cap\'n, I\'d get the hatch open if that shuttle wasn\'t

Yes, so long as the offers made and then  all negotiations taken

taking up list space and time.

Most solar cells today convert only a narrow spectrum of the energy produced by the sun to energy.
If you could make a cell that could convert a broader range of the spectrum (x-rays to radio waves, 
not just a narrow range of visible light), you could get a lot more energy from the cells. Does anyone 
know what the total energy output of the sun is, across the whole range of the spectrum and not just the
visible light range?

Ok, while you\'re flipping, catlike, to land on your feet, the

Even if you can handle the sudden changes without bouncing off the walls,

According to what I understand, the EMP effect of nuclear weapons is caused
by gamma ray interaction with the earth\'s atmosphere. However, this effect
is most noticible at very low (less than 4,000 m) or very high (greater
than 30,000 m) altitudes, and that at other altitudes it is negligible. (My
source is the document "Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions" by
Carey Sublette, found at http://www.milnet.com/milnet/nukeweap).

I reason this out to mean that there is no EMP effect generated in deep
space, away from planetary atmospheres. Is this a correct assumption?

If so, then if you have a spacecraft near enough to the explosion that it
gets a good dose of gamma rays, (say a TL 8 civilian spacecraft) would the
craft\'s internal atmosphere serve to propagate the EMP effect?

I suppose more importantly, would it matter? Or would the vessel have to be
so close to the epicenter of the explosion that other effects would be more
important than an electro-magnetic pulse?

What I am envisioning is an explosion (like a detonation laser missile)
that is not directed at you and is too far off to do direct damage from the
blast (i.e. thermal effects).

Actually a general explaination of what effects a space-detonated nuclear
warhead would have would be much appreciated. If not on the TML, just sent
to me personally or in the form of "Here, look at this website and stop
bothering us, idiot."

Oh, and does anyone know why sfx people in hollywood seem to always depict
really big explosions in deep space as mostly *plane* effects, rather than
spheres?

That would be the Chameleon Class Q-Ship.  Originally intended as
anti-pirate, obviously acquired by pirates for their own use soon after
introduction.

It had four Particle Accellerator turrets and one 100 ton missile bay.
Quite a monster.

I redesigned it with four laser turrets two missile, two sandcasters, and a
factor 6 computer, and it did pretty well (but lost) against a (Player
controlled) Close Escort, Patrol Cruiser, and assorted (relatively useless)
other craft.  The battle seemed to turn on a bevy of missiles launched from
external racks on a nearby station and from the Close Escort (replaced the
drop tanks with missile launch tubes) and the computer level of the close
escort.

Jo Grant had an even nastier design.  I don\'t recall the specs though.

(combat under megatraveller rules btw).

That 800 ton ship, as designed, required hardpoints equal to 1400 ton
vessels,  not quite twice its size.  Someone wasn\'t paying attention at
FASA.

Tenalphi/Lunion (1826) is  a lovely world.  Perfect atmosphere, nice water
percentage, lots of resources, type A starport.

Nobody lives there.  Why?

Tenalphi has a moon in a decaying orbit.  It is just brushing the Roche
limit.  Estimates of breakup range from tomorrow to two hundred years.
Numerous research teams are frantically trying to catalog the world\'s life
before the extinction event occurs.

With a decent sized satellite that close, seismic activity is on the rise.
Tides become very important.  The scenario has the players going to pick up
a team that is threatened by increasing seismic events, and being caught up
in a flood basalt.  (A massive volcanic event that literally floods
hundreds of sq. km with lava in seconds.  A flood basalt is why eastern
Washington looks the was it does.)

We teach new drivers at SuperShuttle San Francisco a very important rule:

Never make eye contact with an eldery Chinese waiting to cross the street
in Chinatown.  If you see them, they think that you are going to stop since
they are the elder.  I\'m serious.  I\'ve nearly wrecked the van because some
idiot thought that he could cross against the light because we had had
looked at each other.

My (overly-quick) resposne to your offer of the Logicrucible stuff was
based on a mistaken assumption.. that you were going to *copy* the program
over, not sell the entire set and not keep it on your computer.

As penance for my mistake, I\'m going to go let Leroy lecture me about the
RoM for eight hours.

As for auctioning Traveller stuff, as long as the you don\'t flood the list
with updates, go for it.  The best way would be to do a quicky webpage with
all the details and run the auction from there.

An analogy I\'ve always used for misjumps is a car out of control.  If
nothing gets in it\'s way, it will roll to a stop somewhere, but if an
obstacle is in it\'s path, odds are it\'s going to stop at the obstacle.

A ship that has misjumped while probably exit jumpspace if it hits a steep
enough gravity well.  If not, it just crises at the level of j-pace it has
entered until it leaves naturally.

...And when you find a friendly (sort of) local willing to give directions,
use older route numbers (route 1 was changed to route 99 in the 70s: many
still refer to it as Route 1 or "old Route 1", or out of date references
(Turn right where that big candy factory used to be...and get off where the
big coca cola sign used to be [excerted from *real* directions I was
given!]).

Signage: non-existent or deceptive.
Traffic rules: Generally non-obvious.
Local Customs: Thrown in to make things interesting (At some intersections,
left turning traffic is customarily allowed to turn before the oncoming
cars cross the intersection.  This can be interesting if unfamiliar withthe
custom especially when (1) you are the oncoming car or (2) the left turner
is placed somewhere else.)
Other Drivers: driven half mad by all of the above and have a "devil may
care" attitude.
And for god\'s sake whatever you do don\'t slow down or stop.

One up on LA: At least we haven\'t seen any highway shooting incidents (to
my suprise!).

More obtrav: hmmm...aircab drivers with Boston accents make great \'color\'.

Unfortunately the author shows a great lack of understanding Traveller
basics. For example he converts displacement tons to kilograms at one
point, assumes that .1% maintenence is paid _every jump_, etc.

Cool.  I\'m working on the Reaver\'s Deep sector.  Need more info on it tho... 
(hint hint)

My projected timelines will be 1100 & 1200 IY (CT/MT & TNE).  I hope to have 
map gifs & everything.  No projected completion dates, tho...

Running campaigns.  After any dry years, I finally have (again) a regular
campaign night with regular players and highly irregular characters to
knock about some.

Very little difference; the sun\'s output is quite sharply peaked in the

Be it that they fire in the visible part of the spectrum that is.
I\'ve been fiddling around with an adventure idea for some time but never
get the chance to use it (my group are currently trying to save known space
from baddies from the core that built hyperspace - after the PCs killed
Yaskoydroy!).
Anyways, what if someone knows some vital information and is doomed in his
ship (no thrust but full power). He sends the info with the weapon lasers
(morse code or whatever) at a nearby starsystem he knows about. He then
leave enough clues to his friends and kills himself before the enemy gets
to him. Then his message will travel for years as the friends fail to grasp
the message. Finally today we have some gangsters who got the clues and
hijacks a large jump capable mobile telescope/ship to read the message and
the PCs are there to investigate this or that.
The basic idea is the cool idea of storing information in pulsed beamlaser
shots that will be there for years.

Well, we have the zero point energy fluctuation devices...
(personally I think those are fools gold as they seem to work analogous to
rubber bands: if you stretch them you can actually get energy from them by
releasing them but try building a power plant out of that)

A bit expensive, but with Comp-9 and a DefDM of +16, it can kick ass. I\'m
trying to come up with some comparative measure for escorts or fighting
ships to assess the "profitability" of their design. Any ideas?
I\'ll be experimenting in future designs with micro-batteries. It appears
that since penetrating a defensive batters is a Difficult task, it is
rather difficult to penetrate if you have _any_ defensive. So as a factor-4
sand may only differ by +2 from a factor-2 sand, it may be much better
having three factor-2 batteries than one factor-4 battery. Ditto for lasers
dedicated to point defense.

The least handwavy solution might be postulating that ships tend to
exitj-space near massive bodies as this seems to be the case when
misjumping to a system hex. Then you could give the players a rogue planet,
fuzzy comet, asteroid, alien base, huge cache of filled up drop tanks from
some since forgotten invasion plan.

The original IMTU code is posted (with permission) on my web site.  I have not
added any of the custom codes (including my own piracy addition), but I\'ll get
around to it if there seems to be interest.

I\'ve used 1/r^2 IMTU with the baseline of detecting a shipmass (whatever
that is) at somewhat less than the ranges for passives. Bruce (?) pointed
out however that the densitometers probably drop off at 1/^3 as they
measure tidal forces and then they wouldn\'t be of much use at interstellar
distances.

Yeah.  Vampire ships were the consideration but u could always have some

That would be the easiest route; however, I do not have the facilities to
generate a web page of my very own.  Maybe I could post a general list to
TML once a week, and update people who have actually made bids privately &
daily.

You can calculate the AEMS signature of a snowball yourself using its
surface area and my sensor rules or FFS2. AEMS is actually competetive
with the nuke flashlight approach - running an AEMS for a month puts out
10^13 joules, after all, nicely formatted at narrow bands your AEMS can
pick out easily.

Snowballs will still have some passive signature - they\'ll equilibriate with
diffuse starlight to about 11 K, and reflect some of that diffuse
starlight as well. Somewhere on my project list is doing passive signature
calculations for such objects - maybe I should move it up the project list
(currently headed by finishing the beta version of my Military Starship
Combat System...)

Me too, me too.

When I first picked up a Newton 110, I was convinced that the handcomp had
arrived.  (Of course, it understood my handwriting out of the box.  Others
were not so fortunate.)

What distressed me so much was that the technology sure looked like a
winner, and yet it is most likely that wince boxes are going to end up as
the market victors, without providing me with the functionality I wanted.

Sigh.

Why "must" there be a way to survive misjump?  There are a lot of things
over which you have no control, and some of them will sometimes kill you
and there\'s not a thing you can do about it.  Misjump is one of them.

An analogy I\'ve always used for misjumps is a car out of control.  If
nothing gets in it\'s way, it will roll to a stop somewhere, but if an
obstacle is in it\'s path, odds are it\'s going to stop at the obstacle.

A ship that has misjumped while probably exit jumpspace if it hits a
steep enough gravity well.  If not, it just cruises at the level of
j-pace it has entered until it leaves naturally.

For the same reason that accidents during character creation should not be
fatal.  It\'s not fun to play.  We\'re not attempting to simulate real life
here, we\'re trying to tell stories.  Can you imagine if at some point
during an  SF novel the author jumped the characters, hope, dreams and
goals unfulfilled, into an empty region of space and killed them?  I\'d feel
dissatisfied...

Dead characters without *SOME* options for survival leads to pissed off 
players.  Pissed off players leads to dead campaigns.  IMNSFBHO, give \'em a 
*CHANCE* to survive, but make \'em *WORK* for it.

FWIW, I have *NO* problems killing off characters doing blatantly *STOOPID* 
things, like, trying to swim in full fuel tanks (according to the rules, 
anybody who enters a full fuel tank enters an environment that\'s within 2 or 3 
degrees of absolute zero.  And if they\'re not a Helium II-based lifeform that 
would consider such temperatures home, they *DIE*.  Instant ice cubes.  Same 
thing with somebody thinking they can stop a nuke from going off by jumping on 
top of it, or stopping a steamroller by standing in front of it.  Stoopid 
stunts DESERVE death.  They\'ve been previously warned...

    Well, I am...when I can.  For details use the URL in the sig, and
follow the Space Vermin RPG Assoc. links.  My current job is making our
sessions a bit choppy.  I\'ve been on the road a lot.  Currently I\'m in the
midst of a whirlwind, two week, three country tour.  
    Take a look at the Space Vermin stuff and then drop a line to me or the
Caffinator.  We are currently scattered about the Metro-Boston area, but
usually play in the Waltham/Newton area.

We\'ll you don\'t have to do this. All the borders nead is magnetic
grappling boots or some gadget that has this effect to avoid this effect.
On military ships add a gravbelt to counter the 6Gs that the crew will use
to make you to heavy to move.

quake was 6.3 Richter in strength, and boy am I glad it wasn\'t shallower.

I was just thinking while it jolted and rolled past how \'exciting\' it would
be to be in your ship having just moved your reactor down to warm when an
earthquake strikes. I bet you\'d be really happy to be in a squat little

Actually you might not even notice if the internal gravity was still on

If the energy density is high enough they\'ll make good batteries, though.
If it\'s really high they could make a power plant, too. After all a power
plant and fuel are basically just like a battery.

Assuming you\'re talking about the d6 d6\'s misjump, you could bypass that rule
and just roll directions until they intersect another system.  That makes
misjumps in the mains very safe and short (one parsec) while misjumps out in
the boonies could be very far indeed. Either way, they\'d end up in a system.
This system may not have a means of refueling though...

AFAIK, it´s ok to post the original auction offer and list to the TML, but better to
keep the updates offlist. That way, interested people can bid while others get less

It should be noted that these were given as options (throught the use
of the word "or") since FF&S was applicable outside of Traveller cannon.

I don\'t like "displacement mass", but we have had the flame war already.

As far as drop tanks, they do open up a bad precident (no matter what
your theory is).  They introduce the idea that you don\'t have to 
carry your fuel with you, and so are only a quarter step away from
"jump gates" or "jump stations", which would be a big change in the
background.

Thank you.  That\'s just what I was saying. Canon is all about precident. Somebody
asked at some point why I bothered working out the specifics of jump travel. As I
see it, if you to put out specifics like that, you\'ll get bad precident.

The idea is to keep the game going if at all possible.  If the PC\'s got here
through extremely unfortunate circumstances I don\'t want them to die.  If on
the other hand they got here thru stupidity then they will surely roll up
new characters.  Killing off the PC\'s at random intervals is a sure way to
disillusion them to your game.  If that game happens to be Traveller I don\'t
believe that we can afford to just drop the PC\'s into a hole and forget
about them because we will lose them to Star Wars or some other misbegotten
RPG (no specific slam at Star Wars intended, just used generically).  They
are playing for the fun of it and what\'s the fun of dieing. I have
occasionally killed a PC, I didn\'t want to but in almost every case it was
person sacrificing their life for the good of the others.  When I do, I try
to make it heroic so that ballads will be sung about him/her and drinks
taken at their favorite tavern in remembrance of his/her great deed/s.

I want to keep them alive, I want to stay within the laws of physics and I
want to stay within cannon.  I don\'t necessarily know how to do all of this,
hence this discussion.

Bloo,
    The officer ranks go to O-10.  Your list is good thru O-7, Commodore but
the next rank should be O-8, Rear Admiral.  By adding that you will keep it
in line with the other branches of service which also have four flag ranks
(Brigadier General, Major General, Lieutenant General and General).  I\'m
still looking at the rest of it but it looks REALLY GOOD.

Here\'s a little trivia for you:

    The Navy used to reserve the rank of Commodore for war time only.  A
single star carried the title "Rear Admiral, Lower" and two stars was "Rear
Admiral, Upper".  Its been a while but I think that it changed to Commodore
full time back a few years ago.  Any Navy/Marines out there care to comment?
    When the U.S. authorized a fifth star to certain officers toward the end
of WWII the titles were "General of the Armies" and "Admiral of the Fleets".
There were five Army and three Navy.  Marines had none because they were
after all only a Corps (normally a three star position) in size.  The Air
Force was part of the Army, "The Army Air Corps" until 1947 so they didn\'t
have one either.

    Sorry for the band width, I\'m off now.....

Good eye, but I used the T4.1 beta materials for the ranks.  Its my goal to have
it be compatible with the next iteration.  Feel free to amend as necessary.
IMHO, its the number and not the name that is important.

Thanks for the comment.

  I checked Rule:4 - Combat in our clubs copy of I:E on Sunday and it
treats the TL of surface units exactly the way FFW did (IIRC) - each
TL difference between opposing units is a _column shift_ on the CRT.
Thus, a TL 14 unit vs an inferior TL enemy gets a (14-TL) advantageous
shift on the CRT; a TL 15 unit would get an additional column shift.

  Presumably Mr. Guatney\'s I:E copy is an earlier edition with more
primitive rules.

  This might be the best explanation for the "anti-matter batteries" in
A:3 - Twilights Peak. They produce a certain amount of power more or less
indefinitely (300,000 years or so) and they don\'t blow up very much no
matter what you do them - including hitting one with a PGMP, presumably.

That\'s what I thought. I don\'t think densitometers would be much help
detecting anything smaller than a planet beyond a million km or so. I
haven\'t tried to figure it, though, just "rule of thumbing."

That is the way I played it in my early CT campaigns (1980-ish).  I have 
since decided that the grav plates hold a "charge" that takes time to build 
up and change.

This lets me have gravity slowly coming back when the PCs bring up the power 
plant on an abandoned ship (an ever-popular situation); allows people time 
to strap into their chairs when power is lost and so on.  I generally a 
vague "several minutes" as the time scale to change the grav plates.

One interesting side effect of the rule is the rate at which a ship can 
change its acceleration ... if everyone is strapped in, then 2 or 3 g\'s 
change should not cause serious problems, but passenger liners (and 
merchant ships) are forced to "lumber along", changing accleration only 
slowly - which makes them easier to hit in combat.

Thats why you also give your boarders a gravbelt or other similat utility
to counter the high Gs, the boots are simply there to give the boarders a
flat surface to walk on so that the changes in gravity dosn\'t distract
them in a potensial firefight. For every measure there is an effective
countermeasure, its just a question of imagination.

You would be right about drop tanks not fitting into the rest of the
Traveller Universe if it wasn\'t for several facts: 1) It turns out that
you need a fairly high turnover in fuel before it is economic to use
drop tanks. 2) You need specially constructed ships (ie. ships with
no interior fuel tanks apart from the power plant fuel tankage) to take
advantage of drop tanks (for the purpose of saving money, that is). And
3) Drop tanks are a relatively new invention. Point 1 means the number
of routes where drop tanks can be used commercially is limited; point 2
means it takes time to build up the infrastructure needed to take advantage
of drop tanks; and point 3 means that there haven\'t been very long time
for that to happen.

The recent discussion did make me have a look at the economics of drop
tank use, and David is right in believing that they will change the
economic possibilities quite a lot, though.

THE ECONOMICS OF DROP TANKS
===========================

I decided to see how much it would add to the price of jump fuel if a
company bought unrefined fuel at the starport, ferried it to a fuel
station at the jump limit and kept a bunch of drop tanks there
permanently. I made a number of assumptions: 1) That drop tanks are
reusable; 2) That the station could sell 240 T of refined fuel per
day on the average; 3) That one 50 T shuttle could move 240 T of fuel
from the surface to the jump limit once per day; and 4) That one 50 T
shuttle was enough to handle the retrieval of all used drop tanks.

The station I designed using QSDS 1.5 was a 1000 T dispersed structure
with 0.1 G maneuver drive, a crew of 6, room for the crew of both
shuttles in addition to the station crew and 10 large staterooms on
top of that, one spacious hangar for a 50 T shuttle, a grapple for
another 50 T shuttle, a vehicle shop, a sick bay, a fuel purifier plant
and 600 T of fuel tankage. The whole thing cost MCr91 (with the 25%
QSDS discount). The two shuttles I put at MCr 28 apiece (taken from the
T4 rulebook).

All in all it turns out that the total yearly expenses, including a
6.25% return on the investment and a double crew, but NOT the cost
of the unrefined fuel, comes to MCr 10,814,400. In that time the
outfit moves 87,600 T of fuel for a per T cost of Cr124. If the
unrefined fuel costs Cr100/T then the company can get their refined
fuel for Cr225/T. But remember, this price assumes that the company
sells almost 90,000 T of fuel each year, which would require, f.ex.
eighty 600 T jump-1 freighters jumping back and forth to the system. 

Anyway, whatever the company pays for fuel on the ground, fuel in
drop tanks cost Cr125/T more, provided that drop tanks are reusable.
(If they are not, the cost is slightly more than Cr1000/T more). If
the freight rate is more than Cr125/T then using drop tank fuel
instead of internal fuel is worthwhile (provided you can fill your
hold with the extra freight, of course).

In the freight costs I worked out some time ago I assumed a cost of Cr300
per T for refined fuel, because that\'s roughly the price where it becomes
better for a visiting freighter to carry an onboard fuel purifier plant
and buy unrefined fuel and refine it himself. This dosen\'t apply in the
case of drop tank fuel, because the visitor dosen\'t have the alternative
of buying unrefined fuel and refining it himself, so you could propably
sell drop tank fuel for somewhat more than the extra Cr125/T (At least if
you have a monopoly). However, if for the sake of simplicity we assume that
the drop tank company also sells its fuel for Cr300/T, we get the following
per T cost for moving freight:

REGULAR FREIGHTER TRAVELLING FROM SURFACE TO SURFACE (35 jumps per year):

          Using internal fuel    Using drop tanks
           1 dT of  1 dT per	1 dT of   1 dt per
           freight   parsec*    freight    parsec*
Jump-1:       840      840        740        740 
Jump-2:     1,170      585        890        495
Jump-3:     1,660      555	1,050        350
Jump-4:     2,400      600      1,220        305
Jump-5:     3,660      735      1,380        280
Jump-6:     6,370    1,065      1,550        260

*Assuming the route never requires a ship to jump short.

[Remember that my basic assumptions don\'t quite match the official rules;
my freight rates are therefore a bit higher than those you\'d get using
the official rules].

Now a Jump-6 ship becomes the cheapest as well as the fastest way of
moving freight long distance.

Also note that even if drop tanks are one use only, they will be worthwhile
for anything higher than jump-1, although the savings for jump-2 traffic
may be too low to be thought worth the initial investment risk.

Makes sense. One thing is for sure, anyway. The fact that the defenders are
able to muck about with the gravity is not going to come as a surprise to
any professional attacker. I might let my players get away with such a ploy
if their opponents are over-optimistic amateurs, but professionals will
anticipate it and have _some_ plan with a decent chance of success of how
to counteract it.

Now, if my players were to secretly install grav plates in a planetside
building they were defending, then I\'d let them have their fun. But in
a spaceship? I think not.

As an idea for use in a game, it\'s something of a hoot. As a practical

Seems like an awful lot of hose connections...

No. Efficiency has *nothing* to do with how a device is made. It\'s a
measure of the ration between the energy that is *potentially*
available, and the energy you actually *get*. 

100% efficiency means that they would be converting *all* the avialable
energy to electricity. That\'s all there is. Period. Anything better
would be *creating* energy out of *nothing*. That\'s not allowed.  Not
even 5000 years from now.

Mile after mile of scrub growing on top of columnar basalt and other
basalt formations. Pretty flat overall, but anyplace the *thin*
covering of dirt has been eroded away, the underlying rock (hundreds of
feet thick) shows.

Anyplace with *thick* soil is either a sandbar from when the mile deep
lake in Canada broke thru the glacier that was confining it at the end
of the last ice age (Spokane, where I grew up, is built on some of those
sandbars. They are *hundreds* of feet tall!) or else had more recent
wind or water activity deposit it.

Some of Hal Clement\'s short stories can give you interesting Ideas. I\'m
re-reading an old collection ("Space Lash" also released as "Small
Changes") and one story "Uncommon Sense" struck me as a lovly Traveller
type adventure. Alas, most players wouldn\'t figure out the puzzle.
Others have decent adventure ideas or backgrounds for adventures.

I said it\'d take a 200 km square to produce 1 kW at *100% efficiency*.
That\'s not TL 7-8, or even TL 15. That\'s the absolute maximum amount
*possible*. Remember, all a solar panel does is convert the light
falling upon it into energy. There\'s damn little light a parsec from a
normal star.

Sorry, but physics says that you *can\'t* do it by using solar power,
because there\'s just plain *not* enough light. It\'s darker than the
darkest night you\'ve ever seen.

No, its more like making energy out of air pressure. They\'ve made two
plates measureably approach each other thus generating a force that could
be converted into energy but they\'ve failed to account for the extra energy
required to put them into the original position. Sort of like creating
energy out of rubber bands.

All (nearly) systems have means of refuelling. Oort cloud, comets etc. It
is hard to generate a starsystem without any planet/moon that has water or
ice.

As in all cases regarding weird vehicle designs I refer to GURPS Vehicles

The actual title was General of the Army, and Gen Omar Bradley was the last
man to hold the rank.  When he donated his field lacket to the Infantry
museum at Ft. Benning, there was a small stir when somebody realized that
the rank was missing.  Gen Bradley removed the rank from his own uniform
and pinned them to the jacket, remarking that anybody who couldn\'t figure
who he was should be discharged anyway.

The IM is a neat place.. among otherthings, they have Sgt. York\'s M-1903
Springfield and Medal of Honor.

For anyone who wants to figure flow rate, I believe the formula is:

        Amount of fuel moved = pi * r^2 * Fuel Flow Speed

Fuel Flow Speed is dependent on the output of the pump(s) moving
the fuel.

Anyone running PCs through the Secret of the Ancients adventure
may need this formula soon afterwards if your players are really
thoughtful. Heh heh. My GM at the time did (the poor sap).

I agree on the physics part of course but don\'t depict deep space as
especially dark. It is as dark as your average compleately cloudless nights
far from citylights. The stars are shining in deep space as well.
Does anybody have a figure about the amount of light (relative to the sun
at 1AU) you\'ll get from starlight?

In fact, it\'s probably better.  Unfortunately, the average distance to said
snowball is probably several AU, and given that active sensors are reduced by
the fourth power of range, a scout ship at 1 light-second and a snowball the
size of pluto at one AU are roughly equally bright...

Of course you would.  That\'s exactly why the player characters should be
careful not to get into situations in which they misjump -- because
there is a significant and real danger that the campaign will end right
then (or in the next few sessions as their life support gets used up and
they have to decide who gets to keep breathing).  I think that it makes
for more satisfying interactive story telling if the player characters
have to weigh the odds just like they would in real life -- and if they
know that if they\'re wrong, it\'s over.  

There are big differences between role playing games and a novels.  A
novel is executed by one person (usually) and presented to an audience
as a completed thing.  A role-playing game is performed by several
people (at least two) for themselves as audience.  An RPG is not a
completed thing; it\'s ongoing for as long as everyone wants it to
continue.  

These differences mean that satisfaction is reached differently by the
participants.  The audience of a novel is satisfied if the characters
have conflicts and reach resolution of them.  (I leave to published
authors to say what satisfied them.)  The participants in an RPG are
satisfied, in part, by taking real risks that would not be presented to
them in normal life.

There are all sorts of possibilities.  They (possibly with their ship)
could be pressed into service by the wrong side, for example.  They
could smuggle rationed items from the Imperial interior to the civilian
populations in the war zone (this lets you exercise your imagination
about what things will run out and be desireable -- what\'s the 56th
Century equivalent of cigarettes?).  They could be journalists covering
the war behind enemy lines but being solicited to provide coverage
favorable to that side (like the CNN guys in Iraq during the Gulf War).  

They could be mercenaries hired to do dirty jobs under cover of war --
like whacking Oberlindes sr. at the behest of Tukera lines.  Tukera
wouldn\'t dare do that during peacetime (even in a registered trade war;
see The Traveller Adventure (or is it The Traveller Book?), but if
looked like the Vargr did it as they swept through the coreward part of
Regina subsector, who wouldn\'t accept it at face value?

No, Swedish drivers are much worse.  They\'re much faster, less

On the other hand, the streets are generally much easier to navigate in

Keep in mind, though ,that this is a game, not real life, and so the risks
aren\'t "real."  The point of the game is to have fun and if having the whole
party die off because of a misjump isn\'t fun, then the GM shouldn\'t
let it happen.

Right... and if everyone wants it to continue in spite of a misjump, then
it should continue.  The GM can take the opportunity to change the direction
of the game and/or make other things happen as a result of the misjump,
but if the whole party would be upset if the crew died, then the GM risks
spoiling everyone\'s fun and losing his players.  Of course, the GM should
make it clear how much of a hard ass he is at the outset so the players
understand what the results of this kind of thing will be.  The one GM
I\'ve played with who was a real stickler for "what happens happens" isn\'t
in my gaming group anymore... everyone else is somewhat flexible.

This may be what satisfies *you* but isn\'t necessarily what satisfies
everyone.  This does show how important it is that everyone in the group
know how the game is going to be played and what everyone is trying to
get out of it.  If most of the group prefers that whatever the dice show
is final, then someone who prefers not to have characters get killed
ordinarily, might not want to play with this group.

You HAVE been reading the Hamilton books.

Just finished the fourth, of six, as I understand it, and am now waiting
impatiently for the final volume.  I am VERY curious about how he is going
to end this gracefully.

FWIW, this has become a good source of TravGrist for me.  The ships at
least feel somewhat Travellerish, and the space battles are comprehensible,
if a bit short ranged.

Please - do not post about your auction AFTER it has begun.  I have no

In point of fact, I like to see the opening posts, since they may contain

I personally don\'t think a WEEKLY posting is terribly
"repetitious"--especially if it is of limited duration (2 or three weeks).
Also, if I only posted once, people who join the list later, or who somehow
missed the first posting, will miss out.

Besides, there\'s always that little "Delete" key . . . God knows I\'ve used
it enough with this interminable "Misjump: Can a GM actually SAVE the
characters?" thread.

\'Tis a moot point, anyway: I have decided not to sell at this time.  It\'s
taken me YEARS to assemble what I\'ve got, and I\'m holding out for GURPS

I should say so...there is no need for a dedicated appearance though.  If
you feel that you are able, there\'s always the possibility of jumping in
for two - three weeks and play either an NPC who is a regular, or an NPC
critical to the plot of an adventure specific to that series of sessions.

I\'d need a couple of weeks to set it up, and we pretty reliably play every
Thursday night.  Let me know.

FFS2 is quite explict and states that hydrogen is used from a surge tank in
the jumpdrive to sustain the jump bubble, in addition to being burned for
fuel/power.

I have been enjoying the \'Mageworlds\' series by Debra Doyle and James McDonald. 
If you take the \'magic\' and consider it as \'Psionics\' - it\'s actually fairly
Travellereque...well, kinda!  :)

Good story tho\'...

I have zero experience with FFS2.  All mine is with CT/HG & *limited* exposure to MT.  How do they figure out that the hydrogen from the surge tank helps keep the bubble open, and what happens if the bubble collapses?

Personally, I *like* the \'burn all the fuel\' model.

Maybe the simplest way for your PCs to survive is to not be a slave
to the dice roll. I have had groups that misjump out into deep space
but only as part of an adventure that I was creating. Never have I 
allowed a roll on a table to dictate that I have to screw over my players,
and they have appreciated that. Referee\'s fiat is always the best
guard against the excesses of rules systems. There is always so
many other things that can happen in a misjump that stranding them
out in the vast deadly unknown does not have to be part of it.

Now then again, I have also had a couple of these happen (once
by sabotage and once by sloppiness on the part of my players) so
that if needed I could probably wing a situation to a degree, but I
still feel that these are "campaign altering" events (at least to the
players\' viewpoint <g>) and should not be left to random chance.
It would be like having a random chart to roll up yearly events in the
3I and having entries like "3) The Emperor\'s Clone is killed and
everyone thinks that it is him," or "7) A silicon-based lifeform gets
loose and destroys civilization as we know it." Not the kind of 
things I want left to random chance.

Now, my players also know that if they abuse my  feelings about
random chance they die. The one time that they decided to do
a jump from slightly above the lowport in order to escape from 
customs they were given a choice: rewind the tape and recon-
sider their actions, or roll \'em up new ones <g>.

    Nice box the Newton, never hear me knock it.  I people who have stopped
carrying laptops because the Newt did everything they wanted & needed in a
smaller package.  It\'s a different animal than the PalmPilot.  The Palm was
designed to be minimalist and fit in a shirt pocket.  It doesn\'t replace my
laptop, it just does some of the functions in a package size I can carry
around.  In game terms, encumbrance 0.  Expect in a couple of years, same
size and wireless.  With anyluck, some third party will come out with Newt
support products.  Limited market though, there was only about 200,000 sold
in five years.
   For portable systems IMTU (palmtops, forearm mounts, etc), I have them
with wireless comm and part of a layered computer system.  If your forearm
system doesn\'t have the data, it queries up stream (to the system mounted
in the g-carrier, to the ship, etc.)

   Have you collected the Pocket Empires groupdata yet?  There was a lot of
interesting data that didn\'t make the Traveller Chronicle either.  Mitch

Pocket Empires doesn\'t really discuss it in detail - it simply
says that you can do it, and it will cost some amount X and take
some amount of time Y.  But at the lower tech levels, you can
have a pretty wide range of technologies, and in fact you aren\'t
necessarily at the same technology in all areas.  Not to mention
that there are possibilities for technologies that just weren\'t
developed or pursued, because something else turned out to be
more efficient, or more politically acceptable, or ... - but the
undeveloped technology could still have been viable, and in
another context, may have been more of a success.

So, let\'s open a new thread:  You\'ve just landed your free trader
on a planet with a \'native\' human race - you\'re the first
starship they\'ve ever seen (you got here because of a misjump).
Your cargo hold is half-full of all sorts of high-tech chachkes -
the sort of thing that goes through phases of popularity, and
then becomes "<giggle> you _bought_ one of those?" two years
later.  The rest of your cargo is ... a chunk of the AAB
Technical Library.  Don\'t ask how you got it; it\'s a rather
embarrassing story, and maybe it\'s just as well that you
misjumped.

The planet seems to be close to Terran/Sylean norms, and is
biologically compatible with humanity - no need for shugilii
here!  It\'s balkanized, but not as fragmented as it might have
been; there are only a few small countries, and several large
empires - including a couple that follow the British/Dutch model,
and a couple that follow the Spanish model.  You\'ve been
fortunate enough to land in a British/Dutch empire, and with a
little help from a Hiver TL16 translating computer coupled with
your ship\'s computer, you\'ve managed to establish communication
with the locals.  They\'re very insistent that you will help them,
to whatever extent you can, to build starships of their own - and
they understand that it will take years - even decades, possibly
many of them, to be able to do it.  Right now, they\'re at about
the same TL as the US and England were in 1750.

It\'s your move...

I think it should be spectrally fairly distinctive; observations at multiple
wavelengths will give you the object\'s temperature, and you can look for
water ice and dust bands, too.

General Bradley\'s title was General of the Army because he was the "Chairman
of the Joint Chief\'s of Staff".  The reason he was promoted was because when
he was appointed to chairman Gen. MacArhur was still on active duty in Japan
and under orders to go to Korea (1950).  They couldn\'t have a four star
General in charge of a five star and considering Bradley\'s record from WWII
it seemed the reasonable thing to do.  The ranks came about because of the
British rank of Field Marshal.  When the U.K decided to promote Monty to FM
then the U.S. jumped in and promoted Generals Marshall, Smith, Eisenhower
and MacArthur.  This was begun in Jan 1945.  Marshall was the Chairman JCOS
at the time and Eisenhower and Smith were in England.  MacArthur was in
Australia running the Pacific campaign.  Admirals Nimitz, King and Halsey
were the navies top dogs.

You\'re talking \'bootstrapping\', not \'uplifting\'.

This will make a helluva great thread I think...

TNE\'s World Tamer\'s Handbook says that densitometers are used for detecting
planets within a system. If we assume that detecting Pluto from the other
side of the solar system is good enough we can say that 1 Pluto mass
(5x10^23 kg according to my _old_ science data book) can be detected at
about 1.2x10^13 m. A ship would be detected at (Ms/Mp)^1/3 x 1.2x10^13 m,
assuming that we are detecting tidal forces. For a mass of 1x10^6 kg (about
a Scout\'s mass) this is about 1.5x10^7 m or 15,000 km, half a BL/BR
starship combat hex. For 1x10^9 kg mass (about 100,000 DT) the range is
about 150,000 km or 3 hexes.

BTW in 2300AD gravitic scanners, which sound like densitometers can detect
stutter warps, and IMO they should be able to detect ships entering or
leaving Jump Space. Would be detecting tidal forces, or would it be
reasonable to say they are detecting the actual attreaction, which would
give them a range proportional to 1/R^2? If so we could detect a Scout
jumping at 5.9x10^10 m or 59,000,000 km, which is nearly 2000 hexes (0.4
AU) and a 100,000 DT ship at 1.9x10^12 m or 6000 LS (about 12 AU). This
would make densitometers very useful for detecting invasion fleets.

What I\'m saying is that if this can store enough energy per unit volume you
could use it instead of a power plant. You\'d just charge it up at the
starport instead of refueling (aside from jump feul, if you use
displacement). That\'s why I\'m saying you could use it as a power plant. A 1
m^3 TL-12 fusion reactor + 0.2 m^3 of fuel produces 2 MW-years of power. If
2.2 m^3 of  TL-12 zero-point energy battery can store a similar amount for
a comparable price and is no less safe, then it\'s a descent power supply,
and prbably has a very small minimum size. Of course it would be even more
uncanon than Fusion+.

I\'m curious as to this fourth power thing. I always thought that active
sensors were affected by: 2 x R^2

You can\'t directly link text in the programs, but the screens can be
captured and used in other applications (like I\'m doing.. converting the

There is a mark feature for naming items.

Speaking of that, If y\'all could wander over to:

The geologist whose brain I picked over the concept put it this way
(warning:  REALLY gross description ahed!) If a volcano is like a zit, a
flood basalt event would be your entire chin exploding and resculpting your
nose.  By some estimates, the event that happened in the Pacific Northwest
carried enough heat to flash the entire Columbia river to steam.

This is only going to work if the grav belts put out a field at some
distance. If they just push against the current ruling gravity field, then
our Marine is going to sill have to wear the blood rushing from his head
etc, plus his grav belt harness pushing up at a subjective 60 m/s.

	I\'d be a bit careful about quoting FF&S2--it was never run by Marc
for his blessing, and he\'s already commented about one possible
interpretation in another with which he disagrees ...

	If I recall correctly, several months ago Marc posted an email
stating that T4.1 wouldn\'t define either way what "jump fuel" was
used for, or how jumpspace worked--basically "Ya gotta dump this much
hydrogen in, ya see, and then push that button, OK, and then you
ain\'t here no more, no, and then seven days later you\'re there ...
unless you messed it up, a\'course."

	Not quite. Your sensor transmits a signal; the signal that reaches
the target has been reduced 1/R^2; it\'s reflected, and then has to
travel *back* to your sensor--that\'s another 1/R^2. So 1/R^2 x 1/R^2
comes out to be 1/R^4

	S  = Original Signal
	S\' = Signal at Target
	   = S/R^2
	S\'\'= Signal received back at sensor
	   = S\'/R^2
	   = (S/R^2) / R^2
	   = S / R^4

	Of course, this neglects the reflectivity of the target, but that\'s
just a constant factor. So active sensors degrade as the fourth power
of the distance to the target.

Hmm... Ignore the man behind the curtain...

Here\'s the problem with not defining something so prevalent in a game system:
You can\'t use it as a plot device.  You can\'t have a "New Experimental" jump
technology without risking setting a bad precident. You can\'t do anything but
the most general case with it. It squashes the richness of something that is
inherent to the game.

Another problem with this approach is that it makes you completely
incapable of jury-rigging something using the jump drive.  What happens
when the players crash on a planet and want to know what they can make
from the jump drive...  Surely you could do something with it given
a source of fuel.  What parts does it break down into?  Having access to
incredibly energy-dense capacitors could be very useful, if that\'s what
is there...

Story has it that the title was originally to be Field Marshal, but Marshall

Hmmm. This sounds like an excellent opportunity for someone to make a fast
buck by offering tourist packages to the event, especially if someone has
the inside running via the geology team on exactly when the glacier is
going to crack.

Fairbanks, Alaska, also runs a betting pool come meltdown on when a statue
on a tyre is going to fall through the ice on the river ... it usually has
over a hundred thousand in it, with betting at 15 second intervals. You
could fix that real good with a meson gun ...

This is part of the reason some of us like the "jump ballast" theory - if
there are incredible-efficiency capacitors or a higher-efficiency power

IMTU, the Zochai crystal was the power storage behind high energy ship\'s

Well, once you open up to the idea that ships don\'t have to
use their own jump fuel, you have a number of problems.  I don\'t know
how the game economics work out (it doesn\'t take an overnight trip to
get out to most jump points and back so I don\'t see the need for
staterooms, etc., nor why you have to haul a shuttle back and forth,
but I haven\'t gotten into the analysis) but it just doesn\'t make sense
that having to haul though jump space all that equipment you used to
move the fuel to the jump space and then the fuel itself would be
cheaper.  Also, you have to mandate that nobody ever comes up with a
cheaper way to do it (just us a mass driver from the surface, or just
use shuttles to get it to orbit and then just boost them in a trajectory
that gets them to the refueling point, or you take a huge icy body an
move it in, etc.)  Also, as your own ananlysis points out, higher jump
ships would benefit.  Xboats wouldn\'t use the system.  So would travel
between specific systems that do a lot of trade (unless they happen to
be right next to each other).  It just opens a can of worms.

Now you can invoke them as a new discovery without changing the
background history, but then you have to go through and have your
setting playout all the ramifications that would spin out from it.
And then you have to decide you like the changes in the feel of the
setting that will result.  I wouldn\'t say this is for the faint of
heart.

There are also *huge* networks of lava tubes in some areas. Craters of
the Moon National Park is best known, but there are others. For example
some folks here in Oregon are using some near Klamath Falls in southern
Oregon to experiment with the possibilities of building a lunar base
inside such tubes if we ever find any on the moon (a not *too* unlikely
possibility). 

For a factual view of such things, check the index to National
Geographic as they did a feature on the park sometime in the last 30 or
so years. For an interesting fictional treatment, try finding a copy of
Andre Norton\'s "Dark Piper". Lava tubes feature prominently in the
story.

The thing is, even in the middle of the night, at low latitudes, you
get a significant amount of light from "skyglow". The air fluoreces
slightly from radiation, and there\'s also stuff like the gegenschien
which is light scattered from dust in the solar system. 

So between the stars it *will* be noticeably darker.

There\'s also a story about a discussion over what to call the new rank

he\'d be damned if he\'d have people calling him "Marshall Marshall". So
they made it a General...

They\'ll be most ready for certain types of chemical and metalurgical
engineering projects. Better gunpowder and explosives, early chemical
synthesis, and better steel. Side items would be some electrical
generating capability. 

This allow production of aluminum in medium quantities, suitable for
creating thermite shells for their navy (which ensures the defeat of
any enemy ships in short order. Assuming coal/oil type raw materials
are available, some synthetic fibers are the next step, givng tougher
lighter sails and rigging. 

This also leads into steam engines, internal combustion engines, and
dirigibles. 

BTW, unless forced, by circumstances, we\'ll skip teaching them how to
produce chemical warfare agents (phosgene and mustard gas are quite
producible at that tech level). 

And so it goes...

No, you see the signal going out is reduced by the inverse square law.
And then *that* signal is again reduced by inverse square. Which gives
you 1/r^2 * 1/r^2 = 1/r^4.

It doesn\'t *add* it *multiplies*.

Actually, it\'s:

	Fuel moved = pipe area * velocity
 except that there are a bunch of corrections for things like
frictional drag with the wals of the pipe, viscous drag from the fuel
flowing past itself, etc. For small pipes/hoses the drag is a *major*
factor.

I can\'t express just how much I disagree with this opinion. IMO players
should be careful not to let their characters get into situations where
they misjump, all right, but not because the campaign may end. Rather,
because it\'s something their character wouldn\'t do. That is, because it
would be bad role-playing. If their characters happened to be stupid or
driven by some great need to take great risks, then they should be free
to behave stupidly or be driven to take risks without having to worry
about meta-concerns.

Many players like to portray people who are more heroic than themselves.
But it\'s hard to be a hero without taking risks. There\'s really only two
kinds of heroes: One is the real-life heroes who took a lot of chances and
happened to survive  --  only, we seldom think of the hundreds of others
who took the same chances and lost. Real life heroes are usually after-the-
fact. The other kind is the fictional hero who gets away with taking
one-chance-in-a-hundred chances because he has the author on his side.
If you try running a role-playing hero like his real-life counterpart, all
you get is a high turnover in would-be heroes.

Of course, you can\'t run a RP hero just like a fictional hero either, because
half the fun for a player (half the fun for me, I suppose I should say) lies
in the gaming aspect, that is, in trying to affect the odds in your own
favor. If your character is going to survive anything, or is going to have
the same chance of surviving no matter what he does, a lot of the fun
vanishes. So the style I favor is something in between, but definitely
leaning towards the fictional hero model. I like at least 9 out of 10
chances of surviving my 1 in a 100 chances ;-)

OK, for less than fatal disasters I do favor using more realistic odds...

Really? Even though they don\'t survive them very often? I and the players
I know of are satisfied by surviving risks that we would not want to run
in normal life.

This dosen\'t solve a thing. In fact, it propably makes matters worse. The
amount of fuel you can store in a surge tank in the jump drive is minuscule
compared to the total amount and also takes away space that could be use for
those pesky high-capacity energy storage thingies. And the big problem with
the "all-the-fuel-is-burned-up" model is that the energy density in the
capacitors would have to be so unbelievably high. Halving  the size of the
capacitors in order to keep 1/10th of the fuel for use during the jump isn\'t
going to help a whole lot with that, now is it? So long as you accept drop
tanks as part of the canonical background technology, _almost all the
hydrogen must be expended one way or the other before the ship enters jump
space_. Any explanation that fails to take that into account isn\'t worth a
bent nickel.

True, but then if the players know that they can\'t die then the game also
loses something.

I used to play D&D with a friend who wouldn\'t kill a player, no matter how
stupid the mistake. It rather took the challenge out. I mean, why bother
to be clever when being stupid gets you the same result in the end?

I suspect that this is a matter of local taste.

We have a number of ramifications. If those ramifications lead to a
contradiction in the game background, then we have a problem. We seem
to agree about the ramifications (drop tanks will revolutionize star
travel), but not that those ramifications constitute a problem. Hey,
whaddya know, we finally got us a disagreement that I agree is just
a matter of opinion! Yay! ;-)

You may well be right. I just wanted a ballpark figure. I did consider just
letting the planetside shuttle accelerate the fuel towards the jump station
and have the station shuttle catch them, but I was up against a lot of
undefined factors (how much time does it take the station shuttle to retrieve
a set of dropped drop tanks? Is the station shuttle also involved in fitting
the drop tanks onto the customers? How much time does that take? Will the
shuttles need downtime for maintenance?) In the end I allowed one shuttle for
handling an average of 8 30 T drop tanks per day without any downtime and
another to ferry 240 T of fuel from ground to jump limit per day, also
without any downtime (Well, not if its a size A planet, anyway. For smaller
planets there will be some time on the ground). Anyway, I could as easily
make a case for three or four shuttles being necessary. As for the fuel
station, it gets a 25% discount for being a standard design. I therefore
gave it a few features that would allow it to serve as a between systems
fuel station too. The staterooms are really the least of its cost.

It dosen\'t really matter all that much. By my analysis the added cost of
drop tank fuel is +125 credits. You may be able to figure out ways to get
that down to +100 or +75 or even just +10. It won\'t make that much difference.

Absolutely. I agree. I just don\'t think it is a problem.

What worms? As long as we don\'t have to retrofit it into a background where
it ought to be but isn\'t, what\'s the problem? For future post-1100 adventures
we just need to keep in mind that this sort of alternative exists in some
places and include it where appropiate.

Why is this different from having to decide if you like the Rebellion or

Absolutely.  I generally allow players to die under very certain
conditions.  One is the blatantly stoooopid move, especially after I\'ve
given several warnings as to the danger involved.  The other is when a
player does something truly, but fatally, heroic, such as re-setting the
reactor control rods _By_Hand_ to allow the rest of the group to escape. 
He knows he\'s gonna get vaporized when the reactor finally blows, but it
the kind of end players like (and myself as well).

     I was working the other day at redesigning the standard MT ships at
TL12 instead of TL15 (since there are only two planets that are TL15 in the
Spinward Marches it seemed a bit daft to assume that that was standard).
Designing a ship at a lower tech level has the added advantage in that it
is inherantly cheaper (5% per TL) because of currency devaluation.
     Now this got me thinking along other lines. In MT ship design, crew
requirements are, pretty much, directly related to the cost of the
subsystem you are crewing. So, for example, the number of engineers is
equal to the cost of the Power and Locomotion subsystems, divided by the
computer multiple, divided by 400. Of course this is assuming an invariant
credit. Would it make sense to apply exchange rate to this?
     For example, a Laser Turret is, basically, the same at TL13 and TL15.
If the above was used then it would be saying that the TL13 version of the
laser required less people/computers to operate than the TL15 version. This
kind of fits in with other assumptions in the system. For example, the
number of control points you need to cover is _multiplied_ by the TL,
indicating that higher tech devices need more computer controls. But, that
might also be an argument saying this is already accounted for.

I have to disagree with you on this one, Loren.

When a GM ran my buds and me through Secrets of the Ancients
back in college, we eventually figured how to use the Portals to
build a ship that stored everything but the powerplant, M-drive,
J-drive, ship controls, and weapons in the attached pocket
universe, resulting in a small ship that could blow a hole through
a 5000dton Midu. The ref didn\'t have much detail on *exactly* how
the portals worked or what the star system in the pocket universe
was like so he forced us to work it out.

We had a *great* time over about 3 months figuring out the details
that should have been provided on the portals andwe really
enjoyed developing the planet and...uh...we had a blast deciding
how the portals could affect the ship design...um....er..

Hmmm...

Never mind.

I try to avoid killing players, as the bodies are difficult to dispose of,

I agree completely. Its a simple fact that since this is a science _fiction_
game, there are some high-tech items that we simply can\'t explain. Jump
Drive. Anti Grav. Black Globes.  etc.

Every attempt that I\'ve seen to quantify these items turns into a debate,
becuase everyone has their own feelings on the matter. So rather than
pissing people off, the game itself such just take these items for granted.
Much less painful that way.

Now on the TML, these things can (and should) be discussed for individuals
to use in their own Traveller universe. But it should not be game canon.

If you can get close to the ship, you\'ll want to use some kind of
laser or plasma cutter and a small pressurized envorinment bubble
sealed over the hole so the plug you cut out won\'t blow out.  You
might want to remove the bubble after you make the hole, though...
Depends on how you want to take the ship.

I didn\'t say that the players shouldn\'t ever be killed off... just that it
shouldn\'t be arbitrary and wiping out the whole group is a bit extreme.
Characters should generally die when trying something really stupid or
really heroic against all odds.

Just because the players don\'t die doesn\'t mean they get teh same result.
I certainly wouldn\'t allow players who screw up to get as much or as far
as players who succeed brilliantly.  If I had a group screw up and misjump,
I\'d make it hard for them to get back and it would cost... they\'d be back,
but behind where they were.

Gaming style is almost by definition a matter of taste...  there is
no right and wrong, only what\'s fun for everyone.

Hmmm... You could do that if you wanted too but it would complicate the
buying of starships if you applied exchange rates, but would just be
greater level of *detail*. If you feel you need the greater level of
*detail* go for it. <G>

Yes from what I seen the greater the TL the greater number of *controls*
are needed, but the higher TL\'s computers CP multiplier you can actually
get by with fewer *controls*.

One note, at TL 10-12 if you try and design a *large*(greater than
100,000dt) ship for use as a cold berth colonizer the computer that you can
have at those TL\'s. I have experimented with building some colonizers for
just before the Long Night? of the Imperium. I was unable to so it by the
MT rules.

>(5x10^23 kg according to my _old_ science data book)
A very old book; pluto\'s actual mass is close to 1.1x10^22 kg. (The old
number was before we knew about Charon - people thought pluto was much
bigger before we realized that some of the light was coming from a moon and
it wasn\'t a point souce - and possibly from assuming a mostly-rock rather 
than mostly-ice composition. The new number is from pluto/charon\'s orbit
around each other and is pretty definite.)

FFS2 errata (see the usual web pages) includes rules for grav sensors/
densitometers. The main use is detecting thruster-powered ships, on the
assumption that thruster plates make gravitational radiation (which hence
goes down as 1/R^2); they can detect a scoutship
type target at ranges of a few hundred km. (Deliberately made weak so that (in
the case of big ships) they wouldn\'t make stealth/hiding impossible.) 
They should have a secondary capability to detect static masses; I haven\'t
really worked out what that would be like - I\'m not sure if I should try and
scale from real-world densitometers or game balance.

>IMO they should be able to detect ships entering or

They\'d be detecting the gravity wave coming from the objects emergence,
which is again a 1/R^2 phenomenon. How strong this signal is isn\'t clear to
me - "what happens if mass appears out of nowhere" isn\'t actually a question
general relativity lets you answer.
For game balance, I would probably tweak them so they work around 30 hexes
or so - we don\'t want to be able to detect every jump emergence out to 
the edge of the solar system; it would make spying and smuggling and similar
PC activiies too hard.

Not to resurrect the argument, but my feeling was that the big death missiles
like Bubba were so expensive that one doesn\'t have to deal with very many
of them, which makes conventional laser turrets - or anti-missile kkm\'s - 
a good alternative; a conventional laser turret only gets one shot at a
fast missile, but the one shot always hits, and laser turrets are much
cheaper than big death missiles. The counter is to put lots of ECM on the
big death missile; the argument never really settled it (with perhaps some
agreement that if the ECM didn\'t work, you could certainly hit and damage
the thing - at least its vulnerable sensors and probably its weak side armour.)

I have Sinister Ideas in the back of my mind about how I\'d design an even
nastier missile...

Yes, my densitometers are used to detect the gravity wave from
incoming/outgoing jumpships pretty much everywhere inthe inner system and
the Navy have stations in a system to pick everything up within the system.
This helps me accepting the notion from 5th frontier war and other Canon
sources that fleets will detect each other if in the same starsystem. Of
course when you know where they entered they they might not be there when
you arrive within PEMS range.

My densitometers can measure the ships aproximate mass and used jumpnumber
if spectacular success/good enough signal but never from/to where the
target jumped.

Ripp, Screech, sound of grave side being opened from within.<G>

Let it be resurrected again!

"Hello Boys, I\'m back!"<G>

In a combat where big armored super fast missiles are being used(Bubba
being an extreme example), the PD laser will have to engage at a range
prior to the missiles deploying its payload. The missile will be trying to
deploy it\'s payload prior to *effective* engagement range of the target\'s
PD lasers. Reason most KKM and Prox nuke missiles will have mass multitudes
of Magic BB\'s or Nuke warheads for the PD laser to *effectively* deal with
within the time envelope of the engagement. If too many multiple warhead
payloads get deployed it will cause *overload* of the target\'s PD lasers.

Remember that "Bubba" was a reusable missile, essentially a robot fighter,
not for use as a KKM missile itself.

If the PD laser cannot penetrate the armor on the facing it then external
features can be affected like sensor arrays, but it the missile has
multiple sensor antenna arrays or uses a similar system to the SPY-1A,
taking out one array antenna will not seriously impair sensor performance.
So the PD laser will have to get multiple hits on external features to
impair sensor performance. But it the target ship is *rolling* and the
missile is *rolling* this could get most interesting.

As for anti-missile defences they will have to be *layered* to have a
chance in multiple ship/missile combat. Example could be a Long Range
Anti-Missile Missiles, then Medium Range High Power PD Lasers, then
Extremely High ROF (but lower power than the Medium PD lasers)PD Lasers for
the short range.

One thing in starship combat with the *new* sensor rules, that has been
largely overlooked is a KKM missile designed to take out the large sensor
arrays. Kinda like a "good poke in the eye" so to speak. 

Under FF&S1 I once designed a extremely large Focal Array Laser(10-100km)
just to engage ships that had just jumped in to a solar system. It could
not pen the target ship\'s armor but was great at removing all exterior
features of the targeted ship that were not as armored as the hull.

Ship combat using missiles will have to be a *mix* of Nuke Det Lasers, KKM,
and Prox Nukes. If a mix is not used then the defenders can have a better
chance at 100% *effective* PD Laser design.

As for the EW/ECM I would put EW/ECM on the missile just to keep the PD
Laser defense on it\'s toes. You go for the PD Lasers Beam Pointer to be
jammed, that way the PD Laser will have to  install ECM on its Beam
Pointer. Again rising costs for both the missiles and PD Lasers.

Not really.  Considering that \'fuelless jumps\' would be probably restricted to 
either highly civilised areas or dedicated routes due to the fact that a Class 
C or worse port isn\'t likely to *HAVE* spare drop tanks around, I don\'t see 
how game balance is torqued.  And considering that military and pc ships would 
*NEED* to carry their own jump fuel, since they\'re mostly used to get to and 
from frontier (read "non-A/B starport") areas, this doesn\'t affect them at all 
unless they\'re jumping into a \'dry\' system.  You go in without the return 
fuel, you *AIN\'T* comin\' back.

The \'equipment used to move that fuel\' has a technical term.  We call them 
\'starships\' around here.

And this of course in *NO* way gets the pcs off the hook for carrying their 
powerplant fuel.  They still gotta take it.  Otherwise, they have NO power in 
their ship.  Ever try breathing vacuum for a week?  No power *also* means no 
life support.

I still don\'t see how this would affect much of anything in a frontier setting. The main users of this technique would be massive freighters run by megacorps.  Bulk carriers and such, the guys who are the *backbone* of interstellar trade.  Unless the pcs have enough money to throw down on a bulk freighter, their boats will *still* carry their own jump fuel.  And even if they *did*, the ancillary support costs will restrict the bulk freighter to \'milk runs\' away from the frontier.  So how does this affect game balance?

Way I always handled it was, calculate everything per TL15 Imperial credits, 
then apply the currency exchange rate.  Unruh\'s Rule #4:  Keep the PC\'s 
itching for cash.  (grin)  This has the effect of making ships *more* 
expensive at lower tech levels, thus factoring in the increased cost of 
importing higher tech components to keep the boat reasonably standard.  (grin)

I was under the impression that the number of engineers was directly related 
to how *much* stuff you had on the boat, but that\'s CT.  I\'ll have to do some 
bashing to figure out my way thru the MT tables again.  Pass the Advil...

Hmmmmmmmmmmm...

Howbout, the higher tech stuff has more mature technology in it?  So, a TL15 
laser would have improved control and aiming circuitry, be made of more 
advanced materials that are now, due to TL, easier to deal with.

Whatcha think?

It also gives any empire with higher jump technology a new decided
advantage in warfare due to improved logistics.  A TL 15 Imperium
would be better able to leverage its size, and get bullets and bombs

At the cost of giving up the freighters.  If there\'s nothing in the target 
system to refuel the freighters, they\'re stuck there.  And multibillion credit 
freighters don\'t grow on trees.

So keep the drop-tank freighters back from the front, where things are
stable and you can depend on drop tanks being available.  Use smaller
freighters with included tanks nearer the front-lines.  This would
also be a good way to put all the ships built with internal tankage to
work without rying to refit them to work with drop-tanks.

(For reference, a scoutship is around +0.) The smallest neutrino sensor
in FFS2 has a sensitivity of 8. (This sensor costs MCr 25 at TL14; 
possibly I should introduce cheaper/smaller sensors, though I wanted 
neutrino sensors to have a minimum size to account for the fancy
nuclear-damper-type shielding they need.) Hence it can see the brown dwarf
at ranges of about +16, which is 300 AU. 

Deuterium burning is a pretty steep function of mass, though; a 10 jupiter
mass object at the same age is about a hundred times dimmer in neutrinos,
for a signature of +7 and detection range of 30 AO. A 40 jupiter mass
brown dwarf has burned all its deuterium by the time it\'s only 10 million
years old.

In all cases, the objects are probably a lot easier to detect via thermal
emission; the 10 jupiter mass brown dwarf still has a surface temperature 
of 300 K at an age of 2 billion years
I need to do detailed models (warm targets like planets are harder to 
see than hot targets like starship radiators) but to first order 
the 10 jupiter mass brown dwarf would have a passive/IR signature of 
+8; a decent starship sensor (PEMS-13) can see this out to a hundred
parsecs(!). Of course, I\'m not sure how you skim fuel from even a 10 jupiter
mass objet. A 1 jupiter mass 5 billion year old free-floater would have
a signature of around +4 to +6 (it\'s sufficiently cold - 100 K - that the
starship signature chart is pretty meaningless and I need to really run
a detailed model) - which would imply detectability out to about 3000 AU. 
(A big science/military sensor - like the one I put on my March THUDD
design - could see these things out to 100000AU; it could basically chart
all the "free jupiters" in a hex in a couple of weeks and a couple of jumps.

A sub-message is that free jupiters therefore have to be pretty rare, 
otherwise everyone would use them during wartime - most likely the
handful of "calibration points" in the Regency represent almost all the
free jupiters. 

Calculations for rock planets and iceballs/free comets will take a 
while longer.

This method would actually *lower* the price of the ship, depending on the
scenario.  Observe;

Free Trader X costs 100 Mcr.  The exchange rate from a TL 15 World to a
TL14 World would be .95 When the ship is bought on a TL14 world with TL15
credits it actually costs 95 (TL14) Mcr.  When bought on a TL15 world with
TL14 Credits the cost would be (100 credits *divided by* .95 =) 105.27
credits.  Jo is saying if the same ship is built on a TL14 world it is
cheaper since all the component costs are cheaper (although the buying
power of the less valued credit is effectively the same).

The wider implications are that any vessel or component of a vessel that
could be built at a lower tech level than the local one will be produced
off world and shipped here due to the cost differential.  This is
consistent with economics in our current time; finished items, like cars,
are assembled in the U.S. and some (generally high tech) parts are
manufactured here, but those parts whose costs are more proportional to the
cost of labor are made in other places, like Mexico or Indonesia, where
labor is cheaper (and standard of living is lower and - this may be a jump
- - commonly available technology level is lower).

I would say for simplifications sake and also to lessen the impact of the
"import drag" that the use of cost in those equations is intended to be a
measure of the support needed, not the actual *cost* of the control system
related to TL.

In fact, I would expect the number of control points (to do the same task)
would be *lower* at higher tech levels (which Keven is saying below).  I
know that this is taken into account by the computer multiple in one way,
and I do not think any additional calculations are needed, but I think that
the cost figures used should not be subjected to exchange rates before
being converted to control points.

I would guess (or even rule) that where there is an industrial TL13 world
within 6-12 parsecs of a major TL15 shipyard (Glisten, Mora), most or all
of the turrets assembled into ships there are being imported from that TL13
world.  Of course, the cost differential is being partly eaten up with
shipping costs, and the sticker price is no lower.

I would guess that the TL15 version of the same turret, while more
expensive than the TL13 version in "constant" dollars, will have if
anything *fewer* required control points rather than more, by virtue of
being higher tech (and therefore a more mature product, with fewer bugs,
tighter tolerances, etc.).  This is not enough o a defference in game terms
and therefore is no different from the TL13 model.

I also feel that this is generally moot since that TL15 ship you just drove
off the lot actually has a TL13 turret installed in it, the part having
been imported.

Well, back to bashing through my own MT spreadsheet...

I like the vagueness in the rules her as well. It lets me play around with the jump drives and not have to 
worry about having the way jump works IMTU different than that in the published literature. I have some ship
designs that use the antimatter rules from MT that don\'t use any hydrogen as displacement mass.

Um, I *think* you got that reversed.  A TL15 credit would be worth more than 
the TL14 credit, therefore you\'d *divide* by .95 to get the TL14 credit and 
*multiply* by .95 to get the TL15 credit.  IE, 100 TL14 credits = 95 TL15\'s & 
100 TL15\'s = 105.27 TL14\'s.

And the higher tech stuff exported to lower tech areas would cost *more*, 
which sounds right.  It\'ll make the locals want to maintain their high tech 
stuff better so that it lasts longer because it can\'t be easily replaced, kidn 
of like American cars in Cuba these days.

Sounds something like the real-world Soviet practice of producing 2 versions 
of their weapons systems:  a \'high tech\' version for internal useage, and a 
\'monkey-copy\' version for exporting to low tech places.  The high-tech version 
of a low-tech device would be sturdier, harder to khest up, and easier to fix, 
perfect for putting in the hands of untrained indigs...

Well, first of all the radiation the object emits won\'t be consistent with a
temperature of 11K anyway, given the albedo of ice it will be more consistent
with starlight filtered through water absorbtion bands (which, unfortunately,
is also going to be the signature of quite a lot of stars), as it will reflect
more than it emits.  Hm..I might have underestimated the number of objects you
need to filter, if we assume our snowball is 10 km across and 2 AU away it
would have a visual magnitude of around +10 at 1 AU from a star, it actually is
being hit by roughly 3e-6 times as much (assuming 11K is legit, I didn\'t check
the math on that, I think it\'s actually a bit high), giving it a visual
magnitude of around +24.  There\'s probably at least 10^12 objects with a visual
magnitude of +24 or higher....

>err.. umm... did you just agree or disagree? :-|

Err. (sometimes I embarrass myself - I shouldn\'t post that late at night).

What I was trying to say was:

1) I agree that the stronger materials will allow faster rotation and thus
(for the same diameter wheel, similar density) a higher energy density.

2) I disagree that there will be much spare capacity in a HPG for the
following reasons:

a) It is likely that the designs are modular so they can be supplied to the
J-Drive OEMs. In most cases the manufacturer will probably look at building
a smaller, faster unit for the same energy to reduce their costs (remember
that the higher strength material will probably cost significantly more so
you\'d look to use less of it).

b) HPGs will operate up to a certain point where a resonance will cause
failure by contact of the rotating element or destruction of the bearings.
There is unlikely to be much spare capacity to go higher than the rated
speed, else you aren\'t using the material or the performance of the
rotating element particularly efficiently.

3) Based on the work I\'ve been involved in in flywheel energy systems, I
would propose one way to get an extra charge out of a unit. Most
flywheel/HPG systems I\'ve seen don\'t discharge totally. This is because of
two reasons -

(a) bearing wear induced by the start/stop from rest
and
(b) potential for damage to the bearing/rotor from low end resonances just
before stopping.

Thus you could suggest that the HPGs in a Jumpdrive never fully discharge,
allowing a special case option where they do discharge fully, releasing
extra energy. For example, in any HPG/FESS you can obtain 75% of the energy
(gross - ignoring transfer losses) in the rotor if you cycle it between
100% design speed and 50% design speed. Slowing to rest would boost
available energy by 25%, at the risk of damaging the HPG.

I actually agree. I posted the comment on FFS2 when someone was launching
into that famous number \'If a jump drive burns all the energy that qickly
why can\'t it be used for a weapon system\'.

Personally, I find the desire to explain everything in detail irritating
because (1) it\'s a game and (2) how on earth are we (TL8...) meant to
explain something as wonderous as a jump drive, which breaks physical laws
as we know them... But then, I happily use ships from all four editions...
if you\'ve got the acceleration, the jump number and a couple of other
figures what else do you need?

IIRC Jump drive works using the scientific principle of \'necessary plot
device\' to move players between the stars....

Hmm. Perhaps drop tanks are effectively external \'combustion chambers\' for
the jumpdrive; the capacitors manage the burnt fuel\'s discharge into the
jump grid. Or are we just going to have a magic handwave in turning that
fuel into energy...?

Maybe they\'re the jump drive equivalent of a solid rocket.

If they are combustion chambers it makes the T-B explosion even more
understandable to me.

Got it. I sat down with a pencil and paper and did some diagrams, and it

Just as a matter of trivia, does anyone know why the rank was
called "General of the Army" instead of "Field Marshal" as is
done in almost every other armed force?

(It\'s because of the name of the first American to be appointed
to that rank: The Powers That Be didn\'t like the idea of speaking
to or about "Marshal Marshall".)

Also, there _was_ a rank of "General of the Armies" (one rank
higher than the five-star rank of "General of the Army"); only
two people have ever held it: George Washington (Honorary, 1799),
and John J. Pershing (1976).  Pershing was authorized to
designate his own insignia for the rank, but never wore more than
four stars.

I seem to remember that in CT, the drop tanks were specially made for each class of
ship.  A fueling port would need to have *lots* of different types of drop tanks on hand to
be able to refuel *any* passing ship. For most corporate fueling starports would have tanks
that were designed for their ships. The odds are that any spare tanks that they do have 
would not fit your ship.

You\'re assuming that you can get the dtf\'s close enough to the front to do 
some serious good.  If the \'bad guys\' know you have them, they can always 
sucker you into a \'dry\' system and chop you into chutney, resupplying from the 
remains of your freighters.  Then *their* tankers move up, refuel your J4 
tanked fleet, and start their next offensive.

Or, seed a few gas giants with 400-600 dt SDB\'s to deny any possible 
wilderness refueling by the enemy.  Assuming the dtf\'s will take with them a 
tanker/tender to make them fuel for the next jump, deny it the GG & you\'ve 
just stopped the resupply and advance.  I don\'t see heavily armed tankers as 
something a naval architect would come up with...

Find a nation situated like the US (access to ocean trade, abundant natural

Introduce steam power for ships and land railways. Industry, steel making,

 I was working on a excel spreadsheet to do HG designs, but the crew

I\'d assume any off the shelf drop tanks would be at corporate yards someplace, 
to fit the 2 or 3 classes of ships the corporados use in that particular area, 
with some variences in size for say, a jump1 set, a jump2 set, etc.

I\'d also expect the local corporados to have, or have contracted for, a 
recovery tug to bring the empties back.

It\'ll reflect more than it emits at visible wavelengths...but by the time
you get into the far IR, it\'ll be emitting much more than it reflects.
The incoming starlight has essentially no energy out in the far-thermal-IR,
so all the far-thermal-IR will be the blackbody radiation from the iceball.
(Similar to the zodiacal dust, which has a "double-humped" spectrum - reflected
sunlight with a 6000 K blackbody shape, and thermal re-emission with a 300 K
blackbody shape.

>assuming 11K is legit, I didn\'t check
>the math on that, I think it\'s actually a bit high
That\'s sort of the canonical density these days for the "temperature of 
interstellar space" - ie the temperature a blackbody in interstellar space
will equilibriate to. (3 K for the cosmic background, the rest of the 
energy is diffuse starlight.) I might be off by a couple of degrees; it\'s
not a well-known number.

Note also that just because it\'s ice doesn\'t mean it\'s shiny and white; the
handful of Kuiper belt objects we have so far are fairly low albedo. No-one
knows what a bare comet nucleus looks like (though there were hints that
Halley was also quite dark.) The ice is dirty and also is affected by
exposure to cosmic rays and solar UV.

>giving it a visual
>magnitude of around +24.  There\'s probably at least 10^12 objects with a visual

Fortunately, you\'re trying to pick it out in the far thermal IR, where it\'s
much brighter than +24. In addition, you can use parallax to distinguish 
the iceball from background objects. (It\'s implicit in the Traveller sensor
model that sensor computers are capable of doing this; it\'s not an unimagineable
computational feat.)

I can\'t find a price for missiles in HG, and I can\'t find my copy of

Odds are we shouldn\'t bore the audience; anyone who\'s deeply curious can 
dig out the archives. Big Missiles certainly complicate life - whether they
dominate or not is hard to settle; Sam never reposted the designs, so 
we couldn\'t do a cost/benifit analysis.

We are NOT in disagreement on this. I just feel that its rarer than the odds
that have been posted when dealing with a misjump.  I stated in another post
that I have had PC\'s to die, it\'s the nature of the beast.  To kill the
whole party and to preface it with "I don\'t care what you do, you;re gonna
die" is a bit more than I want to chew on.  I would go so far as to save two
or three and sacrifice two or three to be able to keep the game going.
Maybe only using a coupla of the low births to conserve power.  BTW, if they
got into this position because they did something really stupid then (I said
this before too) they\'re rolling new characters.  One thing I don\'t put up
with is stupidity (read that as arrogance on the part of some PC\'s).  I had
a PC who got tired of his character.  Instead of retiring him he decided
that he would kill him off and bring in his "brother" to inherit his items
and money.  He never discussed this with me and when we got into it over
WHAT he did and he then told me why,  I decided that the medic got to him in
the nick of time and saved his life.  He was slightly crippled and horribly
scarred, bad limp, etc.  I made him play the PC for several more sessions
before I allowed him to retire.  When the time came to do that he changed
his mind because the character now had some CHARACTER and he liked him.  Go
figure....

Hahaha, I believe that (considering Marshall\'s known ego [not as big as
MacArthur\'s though]).  It turns out the only U.S. General to hold the rank
of Field Marshal was General MacArthur.  When he retired from the U.S. Army
in 1932/3 he went to the Philippines and took over their Army.  His rank in
the Filipino Army was Field Marshal.  It was a rank he held until his death
bed in 1964 (at age 84).

Inasmuch as our nervous systems are just continuous electrochemical
reactions, it\'s surprising that we don\'t see more electrical devices
affected by our presences.  I\'m sure that copy machines, to give a
well-noted example, really do jam more frequently when the user is

This is a part of psionics that will be well documented and understood

I was able to dig up the following from Special Supplement 3, 
Missiles In:

"Standard missiles must be able to fit into a standardized 
shipping/launch container. The launch container is fitted directly 
to the launch rack and the missile is fired from it. The container 
includes integral test circuitry, provides protection from extremes 
of temperature and weather, and is isolated from the corrosive 
effects of atmosphere and moisture."
"The standard container is a cylinder with interior dimensions of one 
meter long and 15 centimeters in diameter."

<snip>

"A standard container will hold any missile of 50 kilograms or less; 
missiles in excess of 50 kilograms are unable to fit in standard 
missile containers, and thus in standard missile launch racks."

The rules go on to say, however, that missiles greater than 50kg can 
be launched from launch bays, but not turrets.

There\'s a whole system in this supplement that allows one to "grow 
their own" missiles component by component. The only example given of 
a "typical" missile is below:

5G5 Limited burn, radio sensing, proximity detonator, HE warhead 
missile. According to the rules, this missile would mass 50kg, and 
cost Cr15960 at TL9. It gets considerable cheaper at higher tech 
levels - I\'ll see if I can work out the numbers tomorrow (I\'m too 
tired to work it out tonight).

I hope this helps a little. I can set up a spreadsheet using this 
system, if anyone is interested.

	The problem depends on the inventiveness, deviousness, and just
plain pervertedness of many players. It kind of helps to deal with
some of their strange ideas and solutions to problems you weren\'t
even aware existed, if you\'ve got more of a handwave than "it\'s gotta
be liquid hydrogen, see, I don\'t care if you CAN get more hydrogen
atoms into a displacement ton of plain old water, it\'s gotta be pure
H2! And no, you cannot rewire the zuchai grid into the spinal mount!
And no, you cannot jump with just power, you\'ve got to have the
hydrogen. I said pure $%&&@# hydrogen, $^%@ it!"

	No, not every gaming group needs or cares about it. But then,
neither does every gaming group really care about having a consistent
design. Some only care about cool deckplans. For others, you have to
have consistent design rules to guide and harness their ... urges.
("No, you cannot mount a 6G maneuver drive, J6, and 50% cargo volume
all in the same ship--it doesn\'t fit!")

	On the other hand, you have to be fairly careful about a handwave to
make sure it doesn\'t have ... unintended ... complications. HDrive
used to be fairly simple. Pour in refined fuel, push the button. Then
HG said you needed power as well, and told you you could store power
absorbed by black globes in part of the jump drive. Oh, and High
Guard also says that all the jump fuel is used at the beginning,
because if it\'s in a drop tank, you use it and then leave the drop
tank before entering jump.  Finally, along comes DGP, and now you\'re
fusing incredible amounts of hydrogen in extremely short time,
storing the energy, and then dumping it all out again quickly.

	Oh, and having some kind of explanation just adds to the color of
the game, and increases enjoyment.

I did a quick calculation a while back, and unless I was out in my maths
there\'s no practical beam weapon that would overload even a relatively
small jump drive\'s HPG\'s, and just about any ship can easily consume the
power that\'s stored. After working this out I came to the conclusion that
TL15 warships would all have Black Globes, and who cares if nobody at Tl-15
really knows how they work. Even a 40% flicker rate is pretty good,
especially given their stealth applications.

The thing is, drop tanks exist *now* for aircraft, and for vehicles
like the Space Shuttle. It\'s not *reasonable* to assume that the idea
will just be forgotten. So people will be trying drop tanks for
carrying *extra* fuel almost from the start.

If we go with the huge consumption rate for the J-drive, it\'s not
especially practical to feed the J-drive from the drop tanks. But it
*is* practical to pump fuel at a high (but not high enough to feed the
J-drive) rate from the drop tanks to the ship\'s tanks. You\'ll be
lagging behind the fuel consumption, but if (as I recall) you can delay
jump for long enough to finish emptying the drop tanks, then you can
jettison them and jump with full tanks. 

They are also useful *if* you can jump with them attached, as then they
let you cross an area where you can\'t refuel. Say you are a J3 ship and
can only make j2 with the tanks attached. That *still* lets you cover a
4 or 5 parsec "gap" without refueling.

Frankly, I don\'t think that using drop tanks *instead* of internal
tankage is all that great an idea. It makes the ship *too* specialized.

  These are all key elements but one big boost to overall productivity will come
from increasing your population base.  Cheap and abundant food, medical care,
etc.  Not only do you extend the working life of laborers, you create more
laborers.

Have you all see the new toys that can let you effectively use your mind as
a joystick for a computer game?  You put a finger in a little device, and
the computer will react to your thoughts.  I tried this on a demo that
involved a snoe skiing game.  To move left, you think "left," and "right"
for right, of course.  The materials said to repeat or stress the thoat for
more dramatic turning.  I was quite suprised to see that it really did
work.  I was skeptical so I placed my hand and the finger with the reader on
a flat surface, and even had my brother hold my hand down.  Still worked.
Then I tried steering in the wrong direction.  Still worked.  Makes me think
that Psionic Flick controls should be available to a much wider range of
people than those whose potential has been activated.  Unless, of course,
we\'re all willing to assume I\'ve already awakened my psionic potential?  ;-)

  I don\'t see an incompatibility here. You\'ve rightly pointed out the
hassles with the ramifications of drop tanks that refs might not want
to face. Ians option merely allows so-called "drop-tanks" to function
like demountable tanks, except that being external they increase the
L-Hyd needed for each Jump number.

  EG - a 400 ton ship with J-2 tankage internally, and other integral
spaces full wants to cross a 3 parsec gulf with no possible refuelling
points. Rather than charter a mini-tanker to go J-1 with it, they buy
off the rack tank shells to add the needed tankage - about 60 Dt (?).
At the other end they presumably recover some of the tanks costs (rent
a drop-tank franchises?).

  Thus no real free ride is achieved (particularly as the ship will
suffer drive performance reductions (to J-1 or J-1.7?).

  Depends. In HG you can build a heavy armed tanker really easily.
Hardpoints are free, maxing out all turrets only takes up 1% of the
ship, and having no use for Agility you have at least available EP\'s
equal to 1% of the ships tonnage (actually, J#% x mass). You might
as well buy a huge computer, anyway - the cost is nil compared to
the drives themselves.

  So it probably turns out that the canonical sub-1000 Dt SDB\'s can
_only_ hurt a tanker when it\'s skimming (which we don\'t yet have the
special rules on, IIRC).

  OTOH, the logical (and not uncanonical) battle-rider sized SDB\'s
can gut such a tanker effortlessly unless faced with a n escorting
battlesquadron.

The main reason Zuccai crystals wont be used elsewhere is simple: discharge
rate is an exact multiple of charge rate.... so if you have a rate over
time (sequence of hex following) 111333aaa222fff235cc9 as input energies,
you get out 13a2f3b at triple the output, assuming a digitalized recording
and a three to one compression ratio. [Starship operators manual.] Combine
that with short (<1 hour till they get damaged &/or explode), and you have
a dangerous, limited application devise that isn\'t even particularly good
for lasers.

I have always used the Burn it all school of thought. How do I justify
this? 10% efficiency of the JD burning, with the rate being some 1000 times
more fuel, plus the need for sudden spikes to put your tumbles in right,
and to get things going ... also explains the need for fairly pure h2...
other stuff will have its energy spikes transmitted to the Zuccai Crystals,
multiplied (I use a x1000 watts, time /1000 factor for ZC\'s, and 3g3\'s dv
conversion for damage from exploding ZC\'s....) and fed to the  drive. risky
jumping (damaged drives or insufficient prep time) involves taking the
power rectifiers off line, so you have just fuel flow to work with in
setting up the correct pulse stream to the crystals. The crystals, oncce
charged (for good or bad) hold the jump course as well. Connect the grid
and fire!

  One related thing that bothers me is how badly does the military
history of the background match up with the ability to effortlessly
establish deep space supply depots wherever you like?

  If every hex on the friendly side of the border can have cannisters
of reloads and LHyd, then the issue may very well arise of building
your SDB\'s as J-1 starships - they can exfiltrate/infiltrate at will
during the strategic time frame. Also, your own Intruders can rip the
hell out of enemy supply lines at will - build it so it always has
the fuel to Jump away to a cache if it meets an escorting CruRon;
this actually could explain why the Solomani Rim War was so hard for
the 3I, although it doesn\'t supply a technical explanation of why the
Imperial Azhanti\'s (et al) didn\'t stop the original Solomani advance
just across the start line.

  Forget Nemesis (?) Intruders, how the heck did the Zho\'s get past
CP-based FI\'s in the FFW?

  And while we\'re at it, this allows any patient party (including
potentially hostile fleetss, and Vampire ships) to stage cache
construction across "borders", rifts, or whatever. Not a very
stable situation, as it seems to be a classic model of a first
strike scenario.

  IIRC, the last (interminable) debate on Trav-Tech indicated that the
dispersion of pellets at economically survivable (forget "safe") ranges
meant that even a big slow cow of a ship would take a very reasonable
number of hits, and even then the system only works courtesy of the
magic bus thruster system. Can this work at all well with HePLAR?

>Remember that "Bubba" was a reusable missile, essentially a robot fighter,

  As you indicated, a layered defense will help. The simple inclusion
of an escort (or fighter) with an anti-ship laser should kill the drone
before it can dump on a capital ship. Also, a counter-KKM of much smaller
proportions would require escorts for the drones.

  Effectively all cases of this debate have centered around "lone capital
ship with no drones/fighters/escorts/consorts/pets", which seems counter-
intuitive to building an effective defense array.

  As soon as someone starts running through the targetting solutions
again could this subject be Turned successfully and banished to Trav-Tech?

There are two kinds of people:
1 Those that think about an item in terms of what it does.
2 Those that think about an item in terms of how it does it.
Me and my players suffer from being in group two and therefore have to
know/handwave lots of stuff in Traveller in order to suspend disbelief.

Yes a slow big ship could take several hits and still be functional but
would any external features of the hull in use still be effective?

Well I remember someone did design some Helplar missiles of a crudely
similar performance, fast, small, and alot cheaper than the Bubba. But no

Well some of the debates have taken into account multiple ship/missile

Increasing poopulation base by itself does practically nothing (ie, China).
Measured increases coupled with improved standards of living, enough food,
medical care, and a puritan work ethic is a great support oof increasing

Yes, and that is something to keep in mind. Just because the PCs is at a
system where, say, Tukera maintains a drop tank fuel station for its own
ships it dosen\'t follow that the station will have drop tanks that fits
the PCs\' ship. Nor does it follow that they will sell them the fuel at a
discount. Nor will the PCs be able to take full advantage of drop tanks,
because they woun\'t be able to use their fuel tanks for cargo space even
if they are empty.

OTOH, if the PCs\' ship is one of the standard designs they could well be
in luck. The cost of a set of drop tanks can be recouped if the company
sells just a few loads per year.

Drop tanks would be used only by ships that regularily visit the system
(and provided the ship\'s route dosen\'t include any system where drop tanks
are not available).

This has an arbitrary feel. I think it would be best just to accept them
as part of the Traveller background as they have always been.

All very true, but this is true anyway. The Traveller background is full
of bits and pieces that don\'t seem to fit. The trick is then to come up
with an explanation why they fit after all. I know you think that such
after-the-fact explanations seems contrived, and that you dislike them. I
can\'t say that I agree with you 100%. In many cases I find that IF you can
come up with a resonable explanation, then it serves to _increase_ the
versimilitude of the background. Still, I wouldn\'t have minded if Marc
Miller had spent a few million man-hours working out a perfectly designed
and fully logical game universe before he published the first Traveller
books. However, the fact is that he didn\'t. So we are left to cope as best
we can.

You advocate erasing drop tanks from the game universe retroactively. This
is potentially just as disrupting to other people\'s backgrounds as keeping
them. Suddenly something that has been possible for the whole campaign is
no longer possible. Now you have players asking "Why can\'t our Gazelle use
drop tanks like we did when we cunningly escaped from the Islands Cluster?"
"I\'m sorry, it turns out that drop tanks don\'t work, so you never escaped."

>Unless you are willing to spend considerable time thinking about how as

>social ramifications) I wouldn\'t recommend it.

Or you could set your campaign in an area where drop tanks either have not
yet had time to become an intregral part of the commercial network or has
been unable to function due to unsettled conditions. Let me reccommend the
Spinward Marches in the Classic Era or everywhere except the Safes in the 
Rebellion Era or almost everywhere during Hard Times or everywhere except
the Regency in the New Era or everywhere in every milieu prior to year 1000.

>More importantly for some, is it where you want to go with your campaign?
>Do you want spend so much of your energies exploring the ramifications of

No, I\'d prefer someone else doing it for me. The whole point of trying to
maintain a canon (to me, that is) is that it increases the chance that I
can use stuff produced by other people in my own campaigns. Say for
example that you produce and publish a humdinger of an adventure.
Unfortunately the bulk of the plot hinges on the fact that the PCs have to
cross a particular stretch of empty space, so they absolutely have to get
the location of a deep space fuel cache from an NPC who use that to make
them perform some service for him, etc. If I tried to use that on my PCs,
they would just go down to the spaceport and order a set of drop tanks.
End of adventure... And if I publish an adventure that deals with, say,
a company war touched off by this underdog company trying to set up a
drop tank operation and undercut the established freight companies in
this medium-pop system, you won\'t be able to use it, however much you
like it.

It\'s true that in many cases I can extract bits and pieces from such
an adventure, but the further the adventure is from my background, the
more work it is for me. Work that I would much prefer spending on
detailing parts of the background that no one else has touched upon.

>Additionally, you would change the feel of the background which
>many people like...

How would it change the feel? I think I have demonstrated that using
drop tanks to cut the cost of freight and passage will only be feasable
for regular, established freighters and liners. So drop tanks makes it
difficult for tramp ships to compete along major trade routes. Just as
it has always been assumed that it was and just as it would be even
without drop tanks. What other major ramifications can you think of?

ROTFL!

I think you\'ve let your argumentative enthusiasm run away with you here.
You can\'t possibly mean that seriously. Or, if you do, you will have to
come up with some examples of how drop tanks will change Traveller society
more than a full-fledged Imperium-spanning war will.

David, what evidence do you have that the major trade routes haven\'t already
changed over? Not the economic system, because that is already completely
broken. In fact, I could argue that drop tanks make the uniform freight and
passenger rates somewhat more plausible (without drop tanks the cost of a
jump-6 is a factor 8 or 9 more than a jump-1; with drop tanks the difference
is only a factor 2 or so). Most of the freight and passenger ships with
internal fuel tanks that we\'ve seen haveen working routes with systems too
small to support drop tank operations. It\'s true that we\'ve never seen a ship
without internal tankage (though some has been mentioned in TNS), but that is
merely negative evidence.

Maybe they will. Or maybe they will prefer to change over slowly so that they
can get full use of the fleet of ships with internal tankage that they already
have. After all, you can\'t sell drop tanks to ships who can\'t take advantage
of the added cargo space.

That one I didn\'t get. What do you mean?

You mean, like the fundamental change of making drop tanks not work? >;)

Seriously, when you explore ramifications that the original authors failed
to explore for themselves, you will often run into changes in your
perception of how the background works. Is that a reason to change the
original concept? Sometimes, yes. I\'d certainly like to change quite a
lot of the economic system, for example. But you should change an original
concept only when absolutely necessary. And I don\'t think that applies in
this case.

And completely irrelevant in any case, since the standard PC ship is not
going to be in a position to use drop tank fuel in most cases, anyway.

Steam tractors and crop rotation, along with disease-resistant grains.  
That\'ll give you your population boost and allow the landlocked people to 
migrte to your cities to work in the new factories.

I\'d like to add that people in group one should stay out of this argu... err...
discussion, as they are already happy. I\'d likewise suggest that an entire
group of type ones should stay off ships.  i.e. if the adventure takes them off
planet, they should book some rooms on a liner and then POOF, they appear on
the next planet.

Hmm..look up the TL at which ship-mountedmeson guns can reach close
orbit range while doing decent amounts of damage. At this TL or the one
_before_, they become militarily viable enough for planetary defense.

Keep in mind that a PD meson battery can be less efficient than a
ship-mounted one and still be effective because the engineers have
so much more room to play with.

To account for their lack in I:E, I\'ve always assumed that they were
taken out *previous* to the time of the actual game. For the game or
*any* planetary invasion to even be considered, all PD meson batteries
_must_ be neutralized first.

The argument isn\'t whether or not Drop Tanks exist. Its burning all the fuel
immediately that is the issue.  In the example of the space shuttle, the drop
tank feeds  the shuttle\'s engine and stays with the shuttle during most of the
lift phase.  The analogy to jump drop tanks would be dumping them at about half
a parsec out or more.

Internal or drop tanks, that consumption rate is outrageous: TRILLIONS of Mj per
100 dTons of ship.  More for greater than jump 1.

The problem, though, is that TL15 black globes built by the Imperium
have a *10%* flicker rate (see High Guard, the Kinunir adventure, and
MT\'s Referee\'s Manual).

The 40% devices you mention are Ancient artifacts which are limited in
number to 100 or so and are tightly controlled/guarded by the IN.
Only some of them are actually installed in ships at the time of
Twilight\'s Peak (early 1100\'s) and these, IMO, are on selected
battlewagons and command ships...and the vessels guarding the
Ancient site in which they were discovered (also probably BBs).

The fact that thrusters only work at a very very low level in free space
complicates things somewhat; even maneuvering from a typical 30,000km
jump error to the station may take a day or so. Such stations - and the ships
using them - are incredibly vulnerable to kinetic energy attack, because 
they can\'t evade. (Run your ship up to several thousand km/s inside a 
system, jump to the target station so that your vector is point at it, and
release a swarm of missiles with reaction drives for final targeting.)
As an added bonus, since interstellar space is so dark (no passive/visible
signature), anything that isn\'t powered up is effectively undetectable until
it gets in active sensor range - and if the station is using active sensors,
it\'s given away its position to anyone within a parsec. HEPlaR-powered 
warships could also carve such a station and the attendent fleet to pieces,
since the HEPlaR ship can hit the stationary station at extremely long 
ranges while evading all return fire. The defender can give their main
fleet auxilliary HEPlaR engines - but that wastes space and fuel, making
them less combat-capable when they get in system.

Basically, free-space calibration points are only of use if they used
completely by surprise.

One (very minor) tweak we could add to make them less useful is to increas
the size of jump errors when you come out of jump in empty space - make it
a few hundred thousand or even million km, and it\'ll take weeks for a ship
to refuel. (That makes the stations harder to attack, though.) Or make
thrusters completely useless rather than partially useless under
these conditions, and make HEPlaR engines bulkier so there\'s a significant
penalty to carrying an aux engine.

Calibration points based on free-floating gas giants will be immune to most
of these problems - which is fine, as long as we make free-floating gas
giants rare.

(Personally I believe free-floating jupiters are about as common as normal
in-system jupiters (ejected during the early history of planet formation)
but I\'m willing to pretend otherwise.)

In order for any significant debris (significant = anything big enough to
worry about) the comet would need to, if I remember correctly, somewhere
near 1/4 or 1/3 the diameter of the moon, in order to knock off material
with enough velocity to escape the moon\'s gravity

<snippage of addit\'l points>

All good points, IMO, folks. My take on drop tank all these years is
there are two kinds:
1) those that you refueled your internal tanks from after charging up
    your zuchai crystals/jump grid for the initial jump. You then blew
    the tanks which were picked up for later use.
2) those that accompanied the ship into Jumpspace to a empty hex
    to be used to refill the internal tanks for another jump and were
    left behind. Basically, these were written off resulting in an
    incredibly costly loss over time. If you use the "jump grid" theory,
    they\'re even more costly, either by having to include their own
    jump grid or by forcing the carrying starship to overstress its
    own grid by extending its jump field.

In either case, only Leonard has said one of the magic words...
*delay*!
Delays cost merchants _money_ which must be made up for so
that the use of drop tanks is worth it. This is an example of what
US businesspeople call "soft dollars".

And this brings up the other magic word...*soft dollar* (or CrImps).

It\'s not just the delay of transferring fuel and blowing the tanks I\'m
talking about. How about the delay and cost of recovering the tanks,
assuming it\'s being done? And *who* is performing the recovery?
How much are they charging to cover the costs of the equipment
and ships *they* have to use? How much does refurbishment of
the drop tanks cost (wouldn\'t most use explosive bolts to force
the tanks away from the ship\'s vector)?

There are alot of "soft" CrImps associated with using drop tanks
that are hitting someone\'s bottom line. That someone is going to
want those CrImps offset somehow.

her up so bad that she crashed into the gas giant. It also said that the ship
had to "skim with all turrets and sensor arrays retracted". This could infer
that certain systems are not functional when skimming (especially for a
partially streamlined ship like an Ahzanti High Lightning class ship). I would
guess also that there would be certain modifiers for the target ship not
"jinking" (effective agility 0) while making the skim run. I think that it
mentioned that a fuel shuttle run took 3 hours, so if the mother ship took
that long (which I doubt, because a mother ship skim is an emergency procedure
and that the mother ship risked damage when doing so); it would be helpless.
The SDB\'s could dart out, and blast away at a convienent range, and not have
to be worried about return fire from the retracted turrets. Maybe this is why
there are so many partly, and fully streamlined fighters in the Imperium, to
escort skimming ships?

  Unless it\'s a commando raid, ordering a drop onto Terra would
be murder/suicide, depending on whether you\'re accompanying your
troops. The Solomani pig-dogs will be all over you in quantity in
a couple of hours, and there are a lot of them, and they have Grav
Armor (not that those little paper counters should be good for much
against sturdy cardboard-stock lift infantry).

  OTOH, there could very well be a drop assumed in all landings;
I don\'t have I:E even remotely close to hand.

  Mechanized agriculture is hardly needed in most pre-industrial
economies, may not help productivity per hectare, and will cost a
whole lot of resources that might be better spent as capital to
re-invest.

Haven\'t seen that research. Can you provide a reference?

I think the biggest boost you would get would be pre-natal and early
childhood care.  Free vitamin pills, diet supplements, immunizations,
clean water, and stimulating kindergartens would be easy, and cheap like
borscht. Check out the UNICEF data on the cost to provide clean water and
immunizations to one child. Compare it to the cost of a daily frappachino
at Starbucks.

Besides, think of the fun you could have with a player bootstrap team,
running a cross between the Peace Corps and Kindergarten Cop :-)

  Both SDB\'s and Fleet Intruders should have HePLAR under a revised CT
regime, even if only as afterburners (the alternative of _not_ outrunning
a squadron of bushwhackers doesn\'t bear contemplation). But the defence
of the supply points becomes their expendability - as there seems to be no
limit to their number or placement, they could be numerous enough to allow
effectively unlimited (J-1) "SDB" refuellings either singly or in squadron
groupings - the natural fuel can format becomes the appropriate drop tank
size to allow 2x J-1 to such a ship (IN, OUT).

  The drive tweakings I won\'t address, but you could make Jump accuracy
somewhat related to the mass of the body involved. This means that sites
based on comets, etc., would be of quite limited use, whereas a flat space
fuel can would be useless - you might never even find the damn thing within
your operational time constraints (forget combined missions). Presumably
this would make brown dwarfs more valuable, but luckily they could be real
rare in the Traveller universe.

Yeah, you could *if* you could afford it. What you\'re talking about
could very well wind up cost tens of *trillions* (if not more) to be
effective.

Keep in mind that each hex is one parsec or 3.26 light *years*.
What\'s the cost of having enough sensors waiting around for (worst
case scenario) over 3 years to get information back regarding ship
movements within this empty space (assuming the ships/installations
aren\'t "stealthed")? Now multipy that cost by every empty hex just
along the Imperial border in the Spinward Marches.

Even assuming you had enough sensors to cover each light year,
that\'s still one *year* for the info to just get back to the sensor.
Given the manufacturing capabilities inherent at TL13+, alot can
happen one year from a sensor and you are one year behind
your enemy\'s activities. I won\'t even discuss the lag time caused
by the lack of FTL commo and the time needed to compile/analyse
the info.

Well, that *is* the idea. You didn\'t think they were *really*

Well they\'re so hard to find, and pretty well impregnable anyways... put a
gigantic meson screen in there... If I was the Solomani, guarding the
homeworld, I\'d have about a 9 or 10 deep sites, as well as at least one on
luna.  The only answer is to send a meteoric assault to try and get the
targetting array, assuming u find it.  You can\'t land the tubs that carry your
forces if the sites are up.  They\'ll get blown away on approach.  You can pull
in BBs and try to smash the targeting arrays, but getting nailed yourself by
multiple deep sites.  The meteoric assault would be crucial... otherwise no
landings can happen on any hi pop planet defended by multiple deep sites.

Confused about your second remark. I\'m a Type 1 GM, only sometimes
meandering to type 2 (when it\'s needed). Not sure what you mean by type 1s
should stay off of ships.

I meant to drop them from use in jumping, where there utility can easily
be problematic.

This is a spurious argument... of course we have no idea how technology
that we don\'t have yet would work.  As far as we know now, FTL travel is
impossible.  Traveller defines some aspects of jump travel, though, such
as the one week travel time and the hydrogen fuel use.  Defining more
detai about how it works is no sillier than making up what has already
been made up.  Most good science fiction has a plausible handwave for
new technology that doesn\'t violate existing knowledge and which minimizes
the made up parts.  Obviously Traveller jump drives require making up
some part of how they work but the rest should logically follow and
be in keeping with current knowledge.

I have always disliked the idea of having a big black box on ships
that somehow takes hydrogen and makes the ship go.  You can have a
character with high levels of jump engineering who can build a jump
drive from scratch but you can\'t tell him what it\'s made out of and
what he could take it apart and make out of it.  This isn\'t an issue
of lack of detail... there\'s no clue what\'s in jump drives and yet
they are obviously made up of several parts (energy conversion,
storage, and jump generator).

All the talk of drop tanks is missing the point.  Carrying extra
fuel around isn\'t controversial.  The fact that drop tanks can be
dropped before jumping means that the entire amount of fuel is used
at once *before* the jump.  This completely eliminates any possibility
that jump fuel is used during the jump.  Without drop tanks, then one
could postulate that the hydrogen was somehow used to maintain the
"jump bubble" during jump.  This isn\'t necessarily a problem, but is
another restriction on jump drive explanations.

My feeling is that, given the pivotal role of space ships and FTL
travel in Traveller, the various ship\'s systems should be explained.
Anyone who doesn\'t could ignore the explanations while those who wish
to play a more detailed or gritty game could use them.  Not having
explanations for how any of it works makes it hard for the GM or the
players to predict or play any situation which pushes the limits without
resorting to arbitrary explanations.

"Demountable tanks" (ie tanks that you have to take with

The problem is this just doesn\'t make sense.  Why should they be so
picky?  They just need a connection to the hull and the charges
to blow them away.  It isn\'t even clear why you should need a 
right next to the ship at all.  Just have a tube that you eject.

High-Gravity Star Measured 

United Press International
C O L U M B U S,   Ohio,   April 20 - Scientists say a
relatively small star is producing the strongest
gravitational field ever measured in the universe,
and is curving space around it in a way never seen
before. 
     They say the neutron star with as much mass as the Sun,
but that is only 10 miles across has a pull 100 billion times
stronger than the Earth. The gravity curves space itself,
making nearby matter behave in ways not seen elsewhere but
predicted by Einstein\'s theory of general relativity.

Spacesuit Wouldn\'t Help 
A human being on the surface of the neutron star "would be
crushed into a molecular layer," Astrophysicist Fred Lamb 
of the University of Illinois said. 
     The neutron star orbits a normal star as part of a so-called
"binary" star system. But the neutron star is a cannibal - its
intense gravity is stripping hot gas from the surface of its
companion...

Well, this is odd from someone who has show such a recence to just
accept canon as it is.  Additionally, you are missing the point.  I\'m
talking about when a background feel hokey because explinations are
piled up to force something to fit and arbitrary preconception rather
than allowing them the follow from a few basic premises.  Changing the
background could be inconsistent, but not arbitrary in that sense.

For me, when it comes down to either simply ignoring a poorly
thought out addition that never go a lot of attention, or keeping
at and then piling up arbitrary rules for why it shouldn\'t change
the entire face of space travel, I go for the former.

Yeah, nothings perfect. OTOH, the fewer the better.  And this is one
that dropping would have almost no effect on the history.

No, I advocate simply ignoring them.  People that have them already can
keep using them, but since they won\'t be mentioned again, new people
won\'t be encourged to introduce the problems the represent.

Fine, until you want to introduce elements from more advanced areas,
or you want to advance the timeline, or players decide they are neat
enought to want to go ge them, or a number of ways this can break down.
And even if it doesn\'t, when you explain the background you then 
have either refuse to explore how space travel occurs in more advanced
areas of the Imperium, or you have go throught all the ramifications 
anyway.

Well, if a game company wanted to do keep drop tanks and work out
all the ramification, but through not needing jump fuel on ships, 
it could work.  However, you would essentially have a new setting in
which the entire basis for the interactions of worlds is different.
It then comes down to which background people prefer.  

> >Additionally, you would change the feel of the background which

> How would it change the feel?

The idea that you need big exensive ships to do higher jumps is a
big part of the background.  The idea there will not be things
like the jump gates in Babylon 5 where ships arrive and depart
from is another big change.  That is just off the top of my head.

Laugh all you want.  This is part of self deceiving conceit of politics,
that their actions are the most important part of how society develops.
It can be argued that in the long run, it mostly just changes
who gets written down in the history books.

All the rebellion ever really changed was who fought whom and who
was in charge.  It didn\'t do anything about the fundamental workings
of society.

> I think you\'ve let your argumentative enthusiasm run away with you here.
> You can\'t possibly mean that seriously.

And I think you are binded by the obsession we have for what passes
for "history".  It the self decepton that leads to history books
making children memorize dates of wars that did little more than 
change who was top dog while giving only passing attention the
technologies, social attitudes, etc. that fundamentally change 
society.

You need fuel to get back?  You room for one person and a jump field
generator on a tanks and use the jump station to provide the fuel
to send it to them.

a) My players have a low gearheadedness, so the following has satisfied
them. Your milage may vary...
b) Jump drives need H2 for opening the jump rift - it is not fused or
burned, but it is required becase <handwave> - thus hydrogen is the only
element that does the job (due to some property of h2 that we don\'t
understand yet...)
c) Drop tanks exist. They must be fitted to a ship exactly, so as to not
interfere with the forming jump bubble, and so that they can dump their fuel
ASAP. No hoses will do - these are high velocity pumps and pipes.
d) You cannot use an external fuel station to power a jump because the act
of jumping is hazardous to ships/stations in the immediate area of the
jumping craft. Note that this is a departure from canon, I don\'t belive that
it has ever been said that being near a jumping ship is bad. IMTU, near is
defined as several hundred miles.
e) If a craft is designed from the start to use drop tanks, there are no
penalties. If drop tanks are retrofitted, the chance of misjump is increased
by 1 when the tanks are used.

For those who are curious, the effects of being too near a jumping ship IMTU
is nausea for sophonts, electrical resetting minor structural damage for
ships and objects. Thus you can\'t use the jump drive as a weapon (or at
least, not a good one).

Just my views...

Ah, but you have to know the supply point is going to be there on your 
way in...

Imagine how unhappy you\'ll be if you jump to the location of a substation
that\'s been destroyed; you\'ll never be able to get to the next one. 

FFW (and canonical war) did have tanker squadrons; I\'m not actually sure
free-space refuelling ports are a better bargain than spending the same
amount of money on tankers, since you can put the tanker anywhere you want -
you need a lot more refuelling stations than you do tankers (and you still
need a big jump-capable carrier to place the stations, too.) 

It\'d be interesting to try this in FFW or IS. If you could trade a tanker
squadron for four fixed refuelling platforms of the same capability, would
you do it? I\'d probably trade one tanker and put the counters at the really
crucial locations, but not more. (Of course both lack rules for commerce
raiding and anti-infrastructure strikes, which would be the main benificiery
of such units...)


To take a real-world example: modern naval vessels - especially at full speed -
and the airgroup of a carrier burn fuel at rates that are actually pretty
close to Traveller - most ships only have enough fuel for a few days or a
week at maximum speed (much longer at reduced speeds, of course), and the 
carrier only has enough jet fuel and ammo for a similar short period of 
actual fighting. It would be easy for the USN to establish fixed floating 
refuelling platforms - but they don\'t; instead, they invest in tankers and
replenishment vessels.

If you don\'t care how a ship works, don\'t give the characters a ship.  Just put
them on liners and ignore the whole time on board.

Players: "We need to get to MacGuffin system to continue the adventure."
GM: "OK, 10 days later you arive in MacGuffin system sans 10Kcreds each."

Then you get to get on with your oh so important mission without worrying the
least bit about how jump drives work, or anything else having to do with
advanced technology.

I\'ve been trying to get a handle on the WBH. This looks a lot like
the stuff in Grand Census. Am I correct in inferring that WBH is

Health:  Weak at first, but now in full swing!
Predominant rules system:  T4, drawing heavily from the ISBA setting.
Campaign location:  Planet X, a Starport in an \'empty\' hex.

Synopsis:  Planet X was an idea I had from the start of T4.  I wanted a   
location that would not change with the UPP\'s and maps.  (i.e. the Core

links the Zimiin and Sylean Mains and is a center of heavy trade and   
commerce.  Planet X is the home of X-TEK Industries, LIC.  Themes vary

If you don\'t store the energy in the capacitors, where do you store it?  If the
energy is immediately expended, what keeps you in jump space for the week? If you
don\'t burn the fuel the most efficiently possible for the tech level, then you
could use less fuel and just burn it efficiently.

You\'re right in essence.  I guess what I was trying to say that population
increase will enable the high production of the technology developed.  Its the
application of the technology that requires populations.  Especially when you\'re
building railroads, liberty ships, etc.

I would ordinarily quibble with the China example, since so much of their
population is involved in farming, but I think you get my point.

<HANDWAVE>
The fuel gets consumed, but what says that it has to be "burned". 
Perhaps the process is less efficient than possible in order to
get the desired output flux. That is, run the mixture way rich in 
order to keep the reactor from slagging down at the extreme power
levels it is producing? Perhaps the capacitors or zuchai crystals
don\'t completely discharge with the initial spin, but provide a
residual level of power to maintain the bubble. 

One can posit a minimal level of internal fuel required for 
maintenance of the bubble, for some value of "minimal". If I
recall correctly, the designs that feature drop tanks also have
internal tankage that provides a reduced level of jump after the
drop tanks have been expended. I\'d think that a design that 
relied on drop tanks for all jump fuel would be a Bad Idea except
under very controlled conditions (such as one might find in stable
regions where an infrastructure can be established for routine useage).

I guess I am not terribly worked up over the really minor details.
IMTU, drop tanks are not practical for the typical player operated
ship anyway.

Actually a 6g manuver takes 17% of the ships volume, a Jump6 drive takes
7% so you have more than enough room left over for 50% cargo as long as
you leave out nonessentials like fuel & crew.  You will have a full 26%
of the ship left for everything else. :)

I\'ve never seen any problem with buying more riders than carriers, and
using the surplus as SDBs. This also means that you have a pool of riders
availible to replace combat losses.

OK a Scout has a TL-15 J-2 drive, vol = 100 x 0.03 x 14 = 42 m^3. According
to FF&S 35% is HPGs: 14.7 m^3. This gives a storage capacity of 420MJ, so
you are correct for a scout. However if we look at a Midu (3,000 DT, TL-15,
J-4) we find that it\'s Jump Drive can store 60,000 MJ - a reasonably
descent spinal PAW\'s output (even a very skinny ship would need to be
15,000 DT+ to mount it). 60,000 MJ over 30 minutes is 33.333 MW, so there\'s
going to be very little problem with getting rid of the energy in the HPG\'s.

Both MT and FF&S say that flicker rates of up to 40% are TL-15, and 1 GCr
and 150 MW for a BB\'s protection seems like a bargain to me.

I prefer that its colorless and featureless, however you do see the anihilation of
positrons and electrons on the jump bubble which make the appearance of a swirling
crackling mass akin to being inside a nuclear reactor core.

	exactly. DSCP are either a vulnerable assert, or a short time

	between the Regency and the Islands. The problem with DSCP\'s
	is that they are not secrete, if the opponent has a shortbow.
	A DSCP one light year away from enemies border is only save
	for one year. For that reason my JumpPort idea.

	e.g. Rurevayn has a TF:11 upgraded to 750.000 dt. 250.000dt is
	a good hangar space for a port. The best thing: If you fill the
	colapsible tanks with water and not with LHy, you are to heavy

	3 month to reduce the risk of detection by a large PEMS or shortbow.

	But cilivilan vessels dont have tankers on high see, they tank

I\'ve downloaded and decompressed some of the old TMLs that were .bun 
files compressed in the UNIX ".Z" compression format. The .bun files 
themselves were readable by Wordpad without additional processing. 
IIRC though, none of the digest archive files, .bun or otherwise, 
seem to be in "vanilla text" format - you need MS Word or MS Wordpad 
(which comes with Win 95) to read them. My guess is that .bun refers 
to whatever batch process they use to combine files, since all of the 
.bun files that I\'ve seen there are compilations of nine or ten 
digests. 

Hope this helps,

So what do you propose then exactly? Instead give them a ship and then have
them micromanage the entire ship\'s voyage? I\'ve run a Traveller game now
since September, the party has not once needed (or requested) to know the
specifics behind Jump. All they know about Jump is: 

1.) The ship needs a Jump Drive in order to engage in Jump.
2.) Jumps of any length take about a week.
3.) Jump is travel through an alternate dimension.

That\'s all they\'ve ever needed to know.

Okay. I get it now! Gearheadedness is now a measuring of GMing and playing
ability! I\'m sorry I didn\'t get it sooner. I\'ll pack up my books and sell
them. Anyone want a bunch of Traveller stuff? CT, MT, TNE, T4, all versions
represented!
<SARCASM OFF>

My players have a ship, and I prefer not to spend late nights figuring out
how J-Drive works! 

HA! So there.

Big deal. There\'s no reason to say that people who prefer not to think long
and hard about this stuff have no right to play a certain way. That\'s just
stupid, and it seems to border  on trolling.

I don\'t care to think overly long and hard about J-Drive, so sue me. It\'s
no big deal. In the future, kindly refrain from telling me how to play my
game, and I\'ll refrain from telling you how to play yours. Pretty simple.

So? I also don\'t know what somebody who sports a high level knowledge of
gravitics could make with a ship\'s Thruster Plates or the Grav Plates on an
air/raft. I don\'t know what these plates are even made of. That\'s where
make-believe and creativity come in.

But, any explanation of the way a Jump Drive works will be an arbitrary
explanation. A canonized version won\'t help. My vision of Jump Space is
completely different than Joe Petit\'s, for example. If Joe Petit\'s version
were canon, it would not satisfy me at all. I\'d still be in the same boat
as now, making up my own version. I don\'t use the DGP and FF&S2 version of
Jump Drives either (with the Hydrogen bubble and all that). I also don\'t
use Zochai crystals.

But it\'s not a matter of my version, or Mr. Petit\'s version. Everyone has
their own ideas about how Jump Space works specifically, and that\'s
something I would like to continue to see in Traveller. The more stuff that
is explained in the Traveller universe, the fewer the chances of someone
coming up with their own ideas when they\'re playing.  Traveller becomes
less and less flexible with the evergrowing morass of "canonized"
technology.

  If AFV\'s with meson communicators exist, then this doesn\'t work either.
And if AFV\'s can\'t spot for meson weapons, then those "artillery" support
meson designs are non-functional.

  While a drop raid might nail a soft facility, it is hard to see how
even a few dozen PD fire con AFV\'s could be exterminated, particularly
as the number of valid targets might be vastly larger than that.

  Clearly I\'ve missed something here. What do sensors have to do with
it? All I want is to quietly place my fuel cans in peacetime, and raise
hell behind the lines in wartime. No sensor net seems needed, and as

  If accurate jumps to deep space are of trivial difficulty, then
why has such a policy not been in place since the post-Nth IW
period (for reasons discussed elsewhere I assume that this capability
is an "invention" like the HG rules drop-tank that did not exist in
2100 AD.

Who says you aren\'t buring it the most efficient way possible?

low throughput.

  If that occurred, then you\'d be using your low berths and lying a
bit lower than you\'d intended :)

  But seriously, if accurate jumps to a _very large_ number of single
(or low #) use sites (for the given ship type) are easy, then not
only does the J-1 SDB (with external demountable tanks) become very
attractive, but Fleet Intruders using their own system of single use
tank depots (collapsible tanks would be portable, yes?) become hell
on wheels.

  I don\'t want to get into that real-world analogy or replacing
tankers. A big station is a bad investment, IMO, compared to a
tanker or a planetary starport. But a 90 Dt external tank for an
800 Dt warship will only cost 100 KCr (0.1 MCr), for a ship that
could easily run 800+ MCr.

  This also leads to each grouping of J-1 SDB\'s having their own
milch-kow tanker, which could spend its peacetime deployment in
the placement, maintenance, and "race-track" shuttling of fuel
sites. For a squadron of 800 Dt J-1 "SDB\'s", each boat would have
a series of pre-placed sites (consisting of an 80 Dt collapsible
tank and a 90 Dt drop tank), and the whole supported by one or two
small tankers to establish new sites using the same materials or
others as available. A couple of military scouts or couriers
might be organic rather than auxiliary for security purposes.

  The latter is one hell of a good point. Although there may not be

  The brief diatribe above seems to apply more to normal politics
than to an armed civil war, in which social attitudes seem to get
substantially modified along with the liquidation of various
portions of that society. The 3I was a coherent if fragile society.
After the Rebellion gets rolling there is no real chance of a unified
Imperium emerging, even if a single nominal master could be established
with massive military force.

  There might be a point to what\'s being discussed, but describing
the Rebellion as unimportant seems both untenable and slightly
ridiculous.

It\'s stored in the jump field. Just like pumping energy into an
induction coil, except for the magnetic field, the power seems to be
going "nowhere". And if you suddenly *stop* dumping energy into the
field, you\'ll get one hell of a power spike back *out*.

> If the energy is immediately expended, what keeps you in jump
> space for the week?

Well, carrying on with the above analogy, When the field reaches a
certain "strength" you pop into jumpspace. 

We can go several directions after that. The field keeps you there, and
it decays until it reaches a level where it\'s not strong enough to
*keep* you in jump space. There are lots of real world situations
where the energy required to *start* something is a lot higher than the
energy required to keep it going once it starts. 

Or, the field could be "consumed" by your entry into jumpspace an some
other feature of the drive "keeps" you in jumpspace. 

Either way, this works *very* well with the bit about having to build
power in a short period and not being able to stop in the middle. The
stresses in the coils/grid/whatever from building up to the required
entry field strength can only be maintained for so long (like the
tendency of a strong magnetic field to make the coil explode). Once you
get into jump, the srtresses are gone (either because the field is
gone, or because j-space itself compensates).

If it was in the Dinosaur Killer range, we\'d get some interesting
meteor showers. For example, look up tektites. They are thought to be
rock kicked up by a *large* impact on the moon, and which then got
swept up by the earth. 

We\'d see a comet coming in. And it\'d make a fair sized crater on the
moon. It might even give the moon a trace of atmosphere for a while.

BTW, if you want some fun, postulate a terraforming project by a minor
race humaniti that became extinct (say due to a war) after finishing
it. It\'s *possible* (though not terribly *practical*) to give a body
the size of the moon a breathable atmosphere. It takes a *lot of "soft
impacts" from comets. And it\'ll start getting kinda thin in 10k to 100k
years (thus you can\'t have it be left over from the Ancients, unless
you come up with an excuse why the atmsphere stuck around). 

But picture the look on the faces of the "how does it work" type
players when they find a world that small with a "normal" atmosphere.

First thing is that you need connections (both fuel pipe and monuting
hardware) that match. 

Second, the tanks have to be of a size that holds enough fuel, without
holding too much. If they are too small, you won\'t have enough fuel for
that extra jump. If they are too big, you\'ll have fuel sloshing around
(*bad*!) AND you will be lugging around extra weight/volume.

If jump drives didn\'t use fuel in "chunks", then sizing wouldn\'t be as
important. 

Anyway, tanks will be sized according to the fuel needed for jump by a
given size ship. Nothing else makes sense from either an economic *or*
engineering point of view.

It\'s worse than you think. The highlighted bit means that the star is
gaining mass. This may result in a nova when enough hydrogen
accumulates. Or, if the accumulation is fast enough, you\'ll get a
*supernova*, which will destroy the star and make life interesting for
anybody within 50-100 parsecs.

I\'m not sure if anything "interesting" will happen if it can accumulate
enough mass to collapse into a black hole *without* detonating first.

Annihilating positron/electron pairs radiate gamma rays. Nothing visible.
And the core of a nuclear reactor doesn\'t really look all that special.
Water cooled reactors may have a slight bluish glow in the water due to
Cerenkov radiation as particles go thru the water faster than the speed
of light in waater (but still below the speed of light in a vacuum). 

Air in the presence of *extremely* radioactive materials can glow from
ionization. But if you see this as anything other than a small bit of
material in a container a few meters away, you are dead, you just don\'t
know it yet. 

Which reminds me. Part II of the article on space medecine in Analog
had some lovely stuff about radiation hazards in space, and the effects
of exposure to radiation. 

I\'m willing to accept that a "superdense" hull provides enough
shielding if there\'s a solar flare, but that could *really* cramp your
style if there\'s a flare going on and you *have* to do repairs on the
outside of the hull. 

In other words, who is going to pick a slow and nasty way of committing
suicide so the ship can get the hell out of there?

Advanced medical stuff will help, but in the cases of the ultrahigh
doses involved, the most serious damage is to the cells in the brain
and central nervous system. You may be able to replace the cells, but
that\'s like a partial brain transplant. Would you be "you" anymore?

Of course I will, how could one refuse such a polite person? Besides I was
wrong about how small a ship could be and still rely on its Jump Drive HPGs

                         or
          WHY ENGINEERS ARE THE WAY THEY ARE...
          =====================================

Our subject today is lighting charcoal grills.  One of our favorite
charcoal grill lighters is a guy named George Goble (really!!), a computer
person in the Purdue University engineering department.

Each year, Goble and a bunch of other engineers hold a picnic in West
Lafayette, Indiana, at which they cook hamburgers on a big grill. Being
engineers, they began looking for practical ways to speed up the
charcoal-lighting process. "We started by blowing the charcoal with a hair
dryer," Goble told me in a telephone interview.  "Then we figured out that
it would light faster if we used a vacuum cleaner." If you know anything
about (1) engineers and (2) guys in general, you know what happened: The
purpose of the charcoal-lighting shifted from cooking hamburgers to seeing
how fast they could light the charcoal.

From the vacuum cleaner, they escalated to using a propane torch, then an
acetylene torch.  Then Goble started using compressed pure oxygen, which
caused the charcoal to burn much faster, because as you recall from
chemistry class, fire is essentially the rapid combination of oxygen with
a reducing agent (the charcoal).   We discovered that a long time ago,
somewhere in the valley between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (or
something along those lines).

By this point, Goble was getting pretty good times.  But in the world of
competitive charcoal-lighting, "pretty good" does not cut the mustard.
Thus, Goble hit upon the idea of using - get ready - liquid oxygen.  This
is the form of oxygen used in rocket engines; it\'s 295 degrees below zero
and 600 times as dense as regular oxygen.  In terms of releasing energy,
pouring liquid oxygen on charcoal is the equivalent of throwing a live
squirrel into a room containing 50 million Labrador retrievers.

On Gobel\'s Web page (the address is http://ghg.ecn.purdue.edu/), you can
see actual photographs and a video of Goble using a bucket attached to a
10-foot-long wooden handle to dump 3 gallons of liquid oxygen (not sold in
stores) onto a grill containing 60 pounds of charcoal and a lit cigarette
for ignition.  What  follows is the most impressive charcoal-lighting I
have ever seen, featuring a large fireball that according to Goble, reached
10,000  degrees Fahrenheit. The charcoal was ready for cooking in - this
has to be a world record - 3 seconds.

There\'s also a photo of what happened when Goble used the same technique on
a flimsy $2.88 discount-store grill. All that\'s left is a circle of charcoal
with a few shreds of metal in it.  "Basically, the grill vaporized," said
Goble.  "We were thinking of returning it to the store for a refund."

Looking at Goble\'s video and photos, I became, as an American, all choked up
with gratitude at the fact that I do not live anywhere near the engineers\'
picnic site.  But also, I was proud of my country for producing guys who
can be ready to barbecue in less time than it takes for guys in less-advanced
nations, to spit.

Will the 3-second barrier ever be broken?  Will engineers come up with a
new, more powerful charcoal-lighting technology?  It\'s something for all of
us to ponder this summer as we sit outside, chewing our hamburgers, every
now and then glancing in the direction of West Lafayette, Indiana, looking
for a mushroom cloud.

Engineers are like that."

.bun = digest _bun_dle (a wild-ass guess, I admit)

Actually, they\'re in Unix \'vanilla text\' format which ends lines with
newline characters only instead of DOS\'es (and windows) Newline/Carriage
return pair (0D 0A for those of you who read hex, speaks the verteran of
having to bcp data from DOS text files into Unix dataabse servers) which
is why Notepad shows them with little black boxes instead of carriage
returns.

Both Word and WordPad do the conversions automatically, and I wish that
those _oh-so-talented_ software engineers at MicroSloth would simply fix
Notepad so that it could deal with both common types of ascii files, as it
would make life easier for those of us who have to deal with them all the
time.

To convert them from vanilla Unix to vanilla DOS text save them as \'Text
Only with Line Breaks\' from Word or Word Pad.

Let me remind people of the conditions:  You do not have any
advanced artifacts that will be useful; you simply have a massive
database of technical information.  So, if you want to introduce
nuclear power plants, you must already have in place the
infrastructure to support them.  This is something that is
seemingly being overlooked: if you want nutritional supplements,
you need a pharmaceutical/chemical infrastructure; if you want
advanced fertilizers, ditto.  Rather than trying to mimic Terran
development for a given period, look at what the key social
changes were that were created by various inventions, and if
necessary, come up with a new way to provide the same kind of
stimulus - for example, if you feel that the railroad was a key
because it made it possible to move larger numbers of people at
lower cost, try to come up with another way to do it - or even to
improve the cost/benefit ratio - for example, can you "do" a
"railroad" that operates more efficiently because the power plant
doesn\'t get hauled along from one end of the line to the other,
along with tonnes of fuel for the plant?  (It\'s possible!)  Air
travel (LTA vehicles) for long distances, even if travel time is
measured in days?  How do you get helium or hydrogen - or is
there another alternative?  Better water distribution and better
sanitation?  What alternatives to lead pipes do you have at the
indicated TL?  Can you make batteries?  At what TL?  What
improvements, if any, can immediately be made in firearms?  Is it
necessary to do so to achieve the goal?  What social and economic
changes are necessary?  Do you promote free trade?  Centralized
economic planning? Nationalization of industry?  High tariffs on
goods not produced locally?  Every empire for itself?
International forums for problem resolution? Exploitative labor
practices?

Many of you are fans of alternate-history science fiction
stories.  You are essentially in the same position as Corporal
Calvin Morrison, late of the Pennsylvania State Police - except
that you have the Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, instead
of a headful of Terran history.

One problem I\'ve always had with Traveller (I played CT) is that I had
to make everything up.  I like to have someone else write the background
and the rules and all that... that\'s why I buy gaming materials.

Good point.  Those should be more defined, too.  CT was pretty bad about
leaving the maneuver drives totally unexplained as well.  It\'d be nice
to have some explanation for grav plates, too.

A canon explanation for how jump drives work would help every player and
GM who doesn\'t care to make up his own explanation.  None of these people
would have to make up an explanation.  It would also give them some basis
for making up modifications and such as well as new technologies.  Those
who don\'t care for the canon explanation would still be just as free to
make up their own explanations.  Having an "official" explanation is
totally non-binding.  Many people on this list have shown that they have
no problem tossing whatever bits of canon they don\'t like.  Having a
canon explanation would also help Marc (and anyone else) come up with
internally consistent rules and advances to jump drives.  We\'ve alread
seen what not having this does... we get all kinds of seemingly
inconsistent jump drive behaviors.

No one is ever going to enforce canon.  Having a basic, "official"
explanation limits no one and helps those who don\'t care to develop
their own.  Again, I buy gaming materials so that I don\'t have to make
up my own rules and background.  I\'ll modify what I buy, but I like to
have a complete game and then choose what to modify not have gaping holes
that I have no choice but to fill.

Well, it\'s easier to get than the Azanti High Lighting deckplans, though it
doesn\'t have as complete a set of plans.  Plus the module makes a good read.

No, but at most hotels the operator will connect you with any registered guest
by name, provided you are calling from a house phone. At the better places,
you can program the phone for voice mail, etc., but in the mid-to-late 70s,
these services were not available. I don\'t know how Marc dealt with it, but he
and Frank used to get hit 10 times worse than I ever did. Frank solved the
problem by being GAMA president, so the room was not reserved in his name
(since GAMA paid for it).

I learned to unplug the phone. I also learned why the SF authors I approached
at SF-Cons had that "oh gawd, here we go again" look. I also began to get a
faint glimmer of what _real_ celebrity must be like.

Thanx anyways... I\'ve gotten several lines on Supp 5.  Am I to take it that
High Lightnings *only* have 13 decks?  How thick are each of the decks?  Also,
I thought most ships had their gravity perpendicular to the axis of thrust and
not opposite...  That threw me off at first... Would there be any effects to
that kind of design? Also for perpendicular designs?

I never felt the urgent need to talk to my favorite authors, probably cause I was
fairlly young when I went to Cons.  But that sword cuts both ways.  After seeing
one of my favorite authors, who shall remain nameless but is affiliated with a
sci-fi alien race similar to the Aslan  <g>, acting like a spaz bouncing up and
down on a bed in the Con suite, pipe in mouth all the while, well, the
demystification was too much.

Chalk it up to differences in playing styles, I guess. I would be extremely
disappointed if I bought a supplement that had many pages about J-Drives,
what they are, what they\'re made of, what you can make from them and so on.

Leave J-Space and antigrav to the realm of individual GMs. I don\'t want to
see pages and pages of Star Trek style quasi-scientific gibberish.

Apparently Marc doesn\'t agree with that. According to something I read on
this list the other day, he\'s not going to explain the workings of J-Drives
in T4.1.  Other than that, it\'s a moot point. Any new invention based on
J-Drives will be shot down in short order as it will violate canon in some
way or another, or will require 16 gazillion handwaves to explain why
K\'Kree Corn Husker Class ships use the technology, but no one else does...

And I prefer not to have my gaming materials filled with pages and pages of
quasi-scientific gibberish concerning J-Drives and Antigravity.

So, they know the jump procedure table... That\'s fine. Have they ever had
problems with their jump drive?  Did they ever have an adventure focusing on
their jump drive? If not, then yes, that\'s all they\'ve ever needed to know.
As soon as they need a little detail on their jump drive, that jump procedure
table can be tossed right out the airlock.

No, that\'s perfectly fine.  Again, my suggestion is that if you don\'t care,
stay out of it. If details of jump drives become sufficiently unimportant in
your (or anyone else\'s) game, you might as well avoid the issue entirely and
just remove the players from ship ops entirely.

THIS is why I post here.  People know more than me...OK, how about this...
What happens when a gamma ray collides with a neutron?  And while I\'m asking

You mean like a wormhole? Like, you form a wormhole that spans the distance between
the two systems and it takes a week to fly through it?  That kind of jumping? Or
do you mean that fuel is used to shift you into jumpspace?  In either case, you\'ve
just used up all your fuel.  How do you get from one point (either an end of a
wormhole, or motion through jump space)  to the other?  How do you control a 28
Trillion Mj explosion?  Finally, going back to the original point of contention,
drop tanks require the use of some sort of capacitor to hold the energy long enough
to eject the drop tank, which pretty much says it doesn\'t go right into jumping.

Nobody, but at TL 11- you definitely can\'t put a fusion reactor on any reasonably
sized jump drive (i.e. PC ship) because the minimum size is too  big.

How do you now get out of jump space?  How do you account for temporal
variations (6-8 days for a normal jump) and misjumps (5-10 days) or
catastrophic misjumps (which keep you in jump space for weeks)?

Remember that accepting drop tanks (as described) means that you\'ve front
loaded your power consumption.  If you don\'t use it right away (like a nuke),
you\'ve got to store it for use during the week long trip.  If you\'re able to
store the power of a nuclear blast, make sure that you account for the other
ramifications.

Okay. I see your point now. I will print up 50 page manuals on the jump
drive for my players tomorrow!

I don\'t think I complained. I did say, "Why bother?" about a week or so
ago. In fact, the way this thread went just before I got involved was:

Somebody said something along the lines of: There are two types of people,
those who are interested in the workings of every minor things, and those
who aren\'t. You then replied that those who aren\'t interested in
micromanagement of Jump Drives shouldn\'t allow their players to have ships.
I asked what you meant, because that seemed silly, and you made your point
clear.

On the other hand, I don\'t know what every single part and every single
wire does in a car...  Yet I can drive one. Go figure!

My suggestion is this: don\'t make broad, sweeping generalizations about the
way people on this list SHOULD play their games. That\'s what I responded
to. 

> Err... that wasn\'t directed at you.  That was general advise to anybody that
> doesn\'t want to deal ship operations.

I don\'t think you\'re understanding a basic idea here:

J-Drives are complete and utter fantasy based on Science-Fiction
literature, specifically (it would seem) the Foundation series. It is
nothing more than a means of simulating FTL travel by side-stepping the
rules of science.

With that being said, whether the players have 50 pages of quasi-scientific
babble or not, the operations of a ship will still be the same as if they
knew nothing. An ex-girlfriend of mine\'s head would swim anytime anything
remotely scientific or math-related came up. She knew nothing about the
innards of her car. Yet, she was an excellent driver.

What that means is: If I choose to not give a damn about the way a Jump
Drive works, I can still give my PCs a ship, and they can still operate
one. It\'s that simple. Your smarmy holier-than-thou attitude concerning how
people should or should not play their games is completely without warrant,
and at least from me, unappreciated.

Which was not my point.  My point is that it is not a fundamental
change to the background like changing the entire basis for
movement and communications.  Sure the Rebellion changed a lot
of things that were important to a lot of people.  But the
basics of life are the same.  In fact, for PC\'s, the big change
would seem to be mostly who the bad guys are.

I should also be noted that the idea that history is unduly
obsessed by wars and politics is not new to me.  I has been
the contention by various people who have studied the issue
in the past.

I\'m not sure what you mean.  You leave the tanks behind, the extra
fuel won\'t be a problem.  Even if it was true, you would have
tanks for each size of ship, not for each _type_ of ship.

I like the explination; "Close your eyes.  That is what it looks

space looking like nothing you ever seen before (and in fact like
_nothing_, at least that _you_ can sense) and give is greater sense

  Eighty-odd decks using the geomorphic maps provided; many of the

off the deckplans and into the spaces of the tail.

  I can see where "quasi-scientific gibberish" could be a problem,
although GDW had a fairly good load of real physics in there. The
real problem to me is the difference between technical handwaving
(anti-grav, Jump) and the intelligent, well-managed exploration of
the ramifications.

Hmmm...  My point isn\'t getting across as completely as I\'d like it to.  I
need to rethink my approach :^).

Although I will shake my fist at what I see to be Traveller\'s dated view of
science-fiction (and I don\'t want to get into a discussion of that again.
We all have our own opinions on that, and I\'m fine with it), I do _not_
want to see Traveller get bogged down with pages and pages of largely
irrelevant facts.

I don\'t want to have to become a J-Drive technician in order to run
J-Drives in my campaign. I don\'t _want_ to go deeper than the charts and
tables in the rulebooks for several reasons, the first of which is what
we\'ll call the law of the munchkin, which is:

Any time that something is sufficiently detailed and explained, there will
always be some loophole or some angle that you\'ve missed that your PCs
_will_ exploit to their fullest advantage.

This doesn\'t just happen with munchkins, this happens with all thinking
players the world over. There will be some loophole in there, somewhere,
that will knock you on your ass when you least expect it.

Furthermore, as the rules stand now (several different versions of J-Space
travel, some contradictory) it\'s great. Everyone has to make up their own
rules. If everything gets codified into one, it becomes more difficult for
a GM to say, "this is how it works in MY Traveller universe", because
several of the players have books that describe exactly how J-Space works.

The final point, it should be a mystery. All of the answers about J-Space
should be left up to the GMs and their campaigns. Is J-Space an artifact
left by the ancients? Is it natural? What are J-Space\'s effects on
psionics? etc...  All of these things should be left up to the GM, and not
left out for players to stumble upon accidentally.

>This is where you get differences between Trek and Traveller.

What we shouldn\'t forget is that Traveller is a role playing game, not a TV
series. There is not one editorial staff who makes up the plots and decides
how the characters will interact. There are at the very least a few hundred
GMs out there, each with differing ideas and opinions on how Traveller
works, and how each piece of technology in the Traveller universe should
act.

And in my opinion, that\'s one of the good things about Traveller.

The Droyne prefer a dense atmosphere, will this make any difference ?

I thought I had seen a terraforming book state that an atmosphere would
last about 50,000 years on a moon sized object but for every 1,000 miles
or so of increased diameter it would last ten times longer.  If this
claim was correct then an atmosphere on a size 3 world should last
500,000 years & any planets terraformed by the ancients should still
have an atmosphere, albeit one about 1 atmospheric type thinner.

Who is to say that Ancient Terraforming projects are not still going on,
perhaps in the form of Ancient Bioengineered lichens that can live in a
near vacuum and work to put oxygen in the atmosphere.  The beauty of
this theory is that the players will never know unless the lichens
genetic squences are analyzed. (Of course the Imperium has probably
already done that in many cases.)

But the players should be used to finding smaller than moon sized
objects with standard atmospheres.  One out of every 36 _very_ small
(size 1) planets in the habitable zone will have a standard atmosphere. 
(Atmosphere is 2d6 - 7 + Size - so a roll of 12 - 7 +1 = 6 or standard
atmosphere)  One out of every twelve moon sized planets will have a
standard density atmosphere although 1/3 of those will be tainted.

However World Builders Handbook does leave out one of the more important
rules from Grand Census, the Intelligent Native Life Determination.

Grand Census says (page 28)

As of 1113 Imperial there are 426 minor races in the Imperium, about 40
of which are minor human races.

To determine if a world with native life is the homeworld of a minor
race roll 3d6 for 17+ with a DM of +3 if the worlds population is 6+. 
If this roll is successful a further 3d6 roll of 15+ indicates a minor
human race.  

When I generate an area of space, or when I detail a precreated sector
one of the first things I do is determine for each planet if it has
native life.  I then check for native races.

I list this data at the very end of the planetary data string, as the
following example lists.  This example is a TNE dual 1201 & 1117 data
listing for part of the Verge Combine a TNE pocket empire.  (note that
the 1117 data gives some stars as type M D but the the 1201 data lists
those stars as M V this represents my use of Harold Hales suggestion for
correccting star types in raveller)

Some of the Everything you know about articles are quite excellent.

Musings:
- ----

At the Dudley Bug Ball (a con in the UK last weekend), when I got a few
moments from running a demo for BITS (basically a playtest scenario set in
M0 involving the players in politics and nobility) I had a look at one of
the game stands and picked up \'Bayern\' and \'Ranger\' for 2300 at a
reasonable price. The former looks great (and could even be run as a sequel
to 2010 if you wanted to play fast and loose with the background). I\'m not
sure how easy it would be to run an extended campaign with it though...
The latter (Ranger) is a great source on the Eber and the Texas Rangers.
Unfortunately it seems to be a little xenophobic towards the Arabs, but
otherwise okay.

Anyway, this set me thinking (and this is the Traveller bit). Andy\'s page
describes running Traveller with 2300 rules (and gives conversion tips) -
but has anyone tried running it the other way?

I always liked the 2300 background, but I much prefer the T4.1 style rules
that Traveller has. It loks like you could look at equivalent tasks,
convert the weapons (maybe generate vehicles with Infini-V) and use the
starships rules from 2300 as they are. If anyone has tried this, it would
be interesting to hear about.

I\'m talking about)

Remember, this stuff is at the very least "quick release". More likely
it uses "explosive bolts". Which means that you *don\'t* just go

If there actually *is* extra fuel, having it spraying out (why put
check valves in a drop tank?) could cause problems. If you just filled
the tank part way, you get the fuel shifting around. And either way,
you\'ve got a *heavier* tank than your ship was intended to use.

Short answer: they bounce off each other

Long answer, the gamma ray may be absorbed and then re-emitted at a
slightly different wavelength, so as to make up for momentum transfer.

A particle that is *damn* hard to detect. Of the "normal" particle
properties, all it has are spin and momentum. A neutron is composed of
an electron, a proton, and an anti-neutrino. An anti-neutron is
composed of a positron, an anti-proton, and a neutrino. (and if you
want to get complicated, the proton and anti-proton are composed of
3 quarks each).

That\'s why fission and fusion reactions give off neutrinos or
anti-neutrinos. The protons being converted into neutrons (or vice
versa) release them.

That\'s why you need to be insulated from it. Increasing the value of c
does *nasty* things to matter (in fact *most* physical constants need
to be pretty close to what we measure them at, or we wouldn\'t be here
to measure them).

What about "universal fittings"?  The Gazelle has set the precedent now all
other ships should match the setup that already exists.  Kinda like the
unleaded gas nozzle at all pumps around the world.  The U.S. has universal
fittings that match a constant in NATO for all war planes.

You have fuel sloshing around in your ship all the time when maneuvering
through a system.  The would need to grapple the tank when retrieving it and
sure that like todays river boat pilots (who deal with half empty fuel
barges all the time) they would get the training needed to deal with
compensation for fuel that\'s left over.

I think you need to add a third group: Those that think about an item in
terms of what it does and like to discuss REASONABLY how it does it.  Just
because your first look at an item gives you thirty new ways to add flavor
to your game DOES NOT mean that you don\'t enjoy the gear headedness to a
certain point.  I think myself and a few others fall into this category and
it kind of gauls me that people think you don\'t have anything to add if you
happen to like items for what they do.  I personally love playing a
Scout/Pilot but I do accept the fact that I don\'t have clue one how a jump
drive works.  Smoke and mirrors comes to mind.  Give me the rich detail of
Star Ship operations anytime over ground pounding.  Maybe that comes from
being the Army for so long. Hehehehe

The problem is, you seem to think that just because a person isn\'t stumbling
all over themselves trying figure something out that doesn\'t exist you can
tell them to stay out of any discussions concerning it and their input is
useless and a waste of time.  On top of that your feelings are those people
can\'t be involved in day to day operations of a star ship and they should
just jump on a liner and AUTOMAGICALLY arrive 163 hours later.  What
freaking arrogance.  Lets hear your explanation of jump drive  Mr. Traveller
Engineer, Ph.d. and we\'ll make it canon. NOT!  Ideas are what are being
pushed here and good (I hope, because I believe our experts when they post)
physics, astro physics, mechanical engineering, structural engineering,
math, biology, chemistry and on and on.  Everyone has some input, not always
good and hopefully not always bad.  Even your input was appreciated for this
letter, I now know I wouldn\'t want to play in one of your games.

When doing repairs on the outside under such conditions, just stay in the shadow of the hull. If the hull is rotating, it might prolong the time it takes to make repairs, but most of the time, this simple trick will solve the problem.

From: "Chris Seamans" <semo@pil.net>
Subject: Re: Jump details

Joe Pettit jpettit@ix.netcom.com and Chris Seamans (Semo@pil.net) have been
duking it out over how much detail to give the players about the Jump drive.

I like the quote from a few months ago:

Players:  How does J-drive work?
GM:  It\'s pretty complicated, you\'d need an Intelligence of F to understand it
Players:  Okay, Bob here has an Intelligence of F, he explains it to us.
GM:  Well, he understands it, but the rest of you can\'t understand his
explanation.

If you players really want to understand Traveller\'s Jump Drive, copy the
page from the CT/MT rulebook and hand it to them.  If they ask for more
detail, go out, buy Dr. Micho Kaku\'s book "Hyperspace" and Dr. Kip Thorne\'s
book "Black Holes and Time Warps," tell them to read these and then declare
"but all of this is as primitive as the concepts of aether, thunder gods and
particle physics."

Or during a game have them bump into a group of J-Space experts at a bar.  A
character will undoubtedly as \'how does Jump Drive/Jump Space work?\'  One
expert will then spout off equations (7D task vs. Intelligence + Jump Drive
Physics to understand).  To act this out, grab ol\' Albert\'s book on
relativity and find a page loaded with equations, and display it, looking
quite proud.  When the characters give him (you) a thoroughly blank look,
have the expert give them the ol\' \'space is a rubber sheet\' analogy.

Then we have the fun begin, another \'expert\' jumps up and say\'s "That\'s
Bollocks![1]" and procedes to characters an long equation.  Again, the 7D
roll and another page of "Relativity[2]."  Again, the PC\'s will be caught
like deer in a bulk frieghter\'s landing strobes and the expert will resort
to a different, possibly more Monty Pythonish analogy.

Well, if you have ever met many opinionated experts, you can see what is
coming...
It\'s the standard Traveller BAR FIGHT!  With really SMART PEOPLE!

The PC\'s may join in or seek cover as the theorists get wiped up by the
experimenter crowd.  However in the back, still nursing a warm bheer,
ignoring his fellow \'experts\' and scribbling on a napkin is Jhonahz Qatrii,
the Imperium\'s 3rd greatest Jump Space/Jump Drive expert.  Int G (smarter
than you can ever dream of being), Edu H, and the entire  Science Cluster 5
w/ Jump Physics 10.  This is the Richard Feynman of Jump Space.

For the trouble of a few moments of quiet, civil conversation (no
excitement, please) he\'ll give your players the scoop:

Nobody, but nobody knows exactly how Jump Drive works.  Every third \'expert\'
has some different opinion on what the drive does, where is the place you go
through, why it works, when it was discovered by who.

He sighs sorrowfully and says "You see, we have all of these questions and
so little actual research in to the phenomena has been done.  Many years ago
I was involved in the H.J.D. project, or Hyper Jump Drive.  We were going
answer a lot of those questions, but the Moot/Senate/Emperor pulled all of
our funds before we got started.  Something about feeding starving K\'Nrorks
on Huulkeooeor or some drivel."

The give them the best explaination of all:  The Jump Drive is a commercial
device, like a transistor or internal combustion engine and has been for
thousands of years.  To build a device capable of researching jumpspace
you\'d have to spend many gigacredits to make a new discovery.

If your players protest, tell them it\'s really too bad the Superconducting
Super Collider was canceled in the mid-80\'s too, but that\'s the breaks.



[1] or what ever epithet serves you best
[2] - If you have the original in German (for most of you American GM\'s) so
much the better.

But until you\'ve been to one of Niven\'s Irish Coffee parties, you ain\'t

I like seeing the authors on a more human scale.  Learning Tai Chi from
Steven Barnes, discussing fusion torch ships with Ben Bova and Dr. robert
Forward..  the only SF writer I ever saw who met the stereotype of the

Hmm... could you (theoretically) keep bouncing the gamma rays off neutrons until
the gamma rays have lost enough momentum/power that they become "relatively"
harmless and perhaps fall into the visible spectrum? Then could you collect
these neutrons and extract this momentum transfer?  Perhaps causing some sort of
chain reaction?

I thought that a neutron was a proton that lost its positron, where a positron
is the charged "massless" partical that makes up a proton. That  leaves a massed
chargeless partical. Of course, I could be completely off base here.

Yea, I\'m working on my theory with the jump bubble, only its a misnomer,
actually its an N-space bubble that you ride in. So while we\'re on changing the
nature of the universe in jump space, what would be the effects of no inertia on
life?

I downloaded your rules and was planning on a backwards application of them

I was planning on keeping 2300\'s starship rules (BTW was there ever any
errata produced for the Naval Architects Manual in StarCruiser, beyond the
material in a TD/MTJ) and world generation etc. It\'s just the
character/task/combat stuff I\'d like to substitute..

  Sorry, what I meant was much closer to what you\'re saying. Detail is not
inherently good or bad; I have nothing wrong with the somewhat minimalist
treatments of most tech in CT (said treatment presupposing that in the
Traveller universe the failure to use Jump drives as weapons systems
power supplies has a perfectly valid reason, such that effectively you
can\'t or won\'t do so, for example).

  The difference between Trav and Trek (a somewhar inflamatory comparison,
but there you go) isn\'t in the handwaving, it\'s in the follow-through. If
GDW or any other company really wanted to do a game where Trek transporters
and replicators were thoughtfully, and _fully_, applied, I might buy it.
It\'s the half-way measures of "well, you aren\'t supposed to _do_ _that_..."
that discourage me from wasting my money.

  Actually, it seemed to be communicated as being your point.
With the clarification there appears to be a differentiation
between "fundamental change to the background" such that all
Traveller milieus are affected, and a change to the "fundamental
workings of society", which might be an event of relevance to
other (later) periods only for its historical effects. If so,
that seems quite reasonable.

  FWIW, the Rebellion sounds like it\'s being described as a
mere change in government, not the mass destruction it did
in fact entail.

  Social (and economic) history are valuable, and the historical
tendency for military/political/diplomatic history to dominate
has been unfortunate IMO (although understandable).

The current Treks are particularly *BAD* when it comes to dealing with
technology.  Seems like every time you turn around, they\'re bashin
something with Yet Another Undiscoverd Particle Beam.

<sigh>

I prefer the original series.  At least Scotty would occaisionally say
something like "Cap\'n, ye canna change the laws of physics!"  And it\'s
*that* mentality I see in Traveller.

Yes, the deckplan arrangement in AHL through me off at first too.  It\'s
best to sit the ship up on it\'s tail, and starting from the top, begin
creating decks.  No, they have more then 13 decks, many areas are just
repeat decks.  There are a maximum of 84 decks, divided into 15

A little on the safe side for pirates isn\'t it?  What with all the boarding and

Questionable concepts for Pirates.  Most pirate captains were actually elected
by their crews.  A Vargr Charisma stat might be more appropriate.  Of course,
if you\'re using privateers with Letters of Marque, I would just copy the Naval
Ranks short of Flag Rank, completely.  Gunnery-Mate for an 02 sounds one step
up from Cabin Boy. ("These pipes are clean!").

Not sure I see the reasoning for either of these.  Of course, they can\'t all be
perfectly suited.  ;-)You\'ve got Gunnery 3 times.  A bit much I think.  Also
Vac Suit twice on the same table is overdoing it, IMHO.  And I should think
you\'d want Trader in there since they\'ve got to fence the stuff.

> Table of Ranks:

As much a I love ranks and all, I\'m not sure how well they translate into
Pirate crews.BTW, I think no one after the First Mate should be called Mate,
and Bo\'sun and Quartermaster are definitely non-commissioned ranks.

I should think that Streetwise or Spacecraft were more integral for all
pirates.Perhaps Trader.

I think you can make this much or more in the Navy.

Hardly a benefit, I should think.

IIRC, someone had a T4 pirate career up somewhere. You might want to compare
with.

I\'m considering putting up a full-text searchable archive of the TML. 
Some questions:-

1) Is this legal? Would I be infringing a copyright held by MPGN 
(where I have downloaded the archives from?)

2) Format. I\'m proposing to convert all the files to HTML for easy 
loading by browsers. Obviously I don\'t want to have to convert all 
the many thousands of posts to HTML by hand, so I\'m automating the 
process (SED and AWK are wonderful tools, really!) However, just how 
much \'conversion\' does everybody want to see? Shall I just put every 
post up as a line-for-line copy of the extract from the digest, or 
should I try to convert the posts to take advantage of HTML 
formatting? If I do, how should I handle \'>>\' quoted material?

Awaiting some ideas

Not likely. Just having the gamma ray *hit* a neutron is doing pretty
good. Getting it to bounce off at a specific angle isn\'t gonna happen.
The uncertainty principle will see to that. 

If you have something with lots of nuclei packed tightly, it\'ll turn
gamma rays to heat (except for the ones that make it through).

No. A positron is an anti-electron. Same mass, opposite charge, spin
and lepton number. Both electrons and positrons are "fundamental"
particles. That is, other than reacting with their anti-particles,
there\'s no way to get rid of them. They are "leptons".

A proton is a baryon (composed of three quarks, mesons are composed of
pairs of quarks). A neutron consists of an electron, a proton, and an
anti-neutrino. Both are *quite* massive (around 1830 times the mass of
an electron).

Neutrinos and photons are leptons. They both have a rest mass of zero.
They have different spins. As I recall, a photon has a spin of 0, and a
neutrino has a spin of 1/2. Neither has any charge.

You can get a proton to turn into a neutron by giving the proton enough
energy to *create* both an electron/positron pair and a
neutrino/anti-neutrino pair. The electron and the anti-neutrino bind
with the proton forming a neutron, while the positron and neutrino are
emitted.

Zero rest mass, spin of +/- 1/2, variable momentum depending on energy.

If I could answer that I\'d have a Nobel prize. The real problem is that
except for a few fringe ideas, mass (aka inertia) seems to be a
fundamental property of matter. 

Not that all known "massless" (ie rest mass of zero) particles travel
at c. And given the Lorentz/Fitzgerald equations, it\'s pretty unlikely
that they *can* travel at any other speed. So that could get ugly.

But just consider that the mass of atoms plays a big part in chemical
reactions. Mess those up even a tiny bit, and you die...

Can you imagine what the discovery of the biological effects of
kironide[1] would do to a society? In Traveller, it\'d be either all over
the place (making everybody who could afford it a major league psi) or
it\'d be suppressed with a *huge* black market.

In Trek they used it to beat the bad guys and promptly *forgot* about it.

Frankly, I find the "normal" orientation *highly* suspect. The
"perpendicular" style decks are usable with the g-comp knocked out. The
"parallel" type are death traps if that happens.

Remember, without g-comp "down" means "opposite of the direction the

If the hull is rotating at any rate worth mentioning, you are going to
get fried because it won\'t take that long to get you on the wrong side.
Also, "shadow" shielding is a problem because the solar magnetic field
extends *way* out, and can warp the paths of the particles
significantly. So you may not be safe on the dark side of the ship, and
even if you are, the "safe" direction won\'t stay the same. 

That\'s why shielding designs tend to *surround* the safe area with
shielding rather than just use the shadow of a partial shield. 

Also, how many locks does the ship have? It\'s going to take some
*careful* co-ordination if there isn\'t a lock on the same side of the
hull as the damage.

Nothing except the rules which state that you don\'t jump right away (By CT
rules you delay the jump at least long enough to get rid of any drop tanks
you may have; by MT rules you can delay the jump several hours).

Agreed. That\'s just the way the physics of jumpspace works.

Well, if you could explain the other problems away, I\'d be inclined to
swallow the concept of a special kind of fusion reactor that is introduced
at TL 9 and dosen\'t improve one little bit over the next 7 TLs despite the
fact that it\'s cousins improve all the time, but I tell you, it smacks
mightily of a contrieved, after-the-fact handwave...

You\'re not talking about the jump field that builds up around the ship and
maintain a small bubble of real space around it while it is in jumpspace,
are you? Because that one is formed when the capacitors discharge and
propel the ship into jumpspace. Which takes place up to minutes or even
hours after the jump fuel has been completely used up.

Hmm... you may be onto something here. How about this: The jump operates in
two stages: First you use up a huge amount of energy, derived from burning
up oodles of jump fuel in a special, very fast fusion reactor (which is, when
invented at TL 9, already at its peak efficiency and cannot be improved upon).
This builds up the strength of the jump field _almost_ to the threshold and
must, for some reason, be done very fast (in order to overcome some sort of
resistance, perhaps?). If you stop there, nothing more happens (except that
the field presumably dissipates fairly rapidly). Secondly you "fine-tune" the
last burst of energy to carry you over the threshhold in a carefully
controlled way. This second energy burst determines your jumpspace vector
and is what you use the capacitors for.

Do remember that according to _Starship Operator\'s Manual_ you can, indeed,
stop in the middle and pause for up to several hours.

Another indication, IMO, of the reliability of ship\'s gravity and g-comp

Well, if you really need my attitude explained one more time then here you
are: IMO canon should be adhered to so long as it makes sense. If it does
not make sense, making up some decent explanation that makes it make sense
is preferrable to just changing it. And, finally, if no decent explanation
springs to mind, changing it is better than to keep the nonsensical bit.

No, I got the point all right. What you don\'t seem to grasp is that the
point where the few basic premises should have been established was when
the rules were first made up. We\'re beyond that point now and have been
for 20 years. Furthermore, because you can\'t expect a game designer to use
several lifetimes exploring all the raminfications of his rules before
publishing, and because you can\'t expect a game designer to make it all up
before the first book is published, it is silly not to expect to see some
discrepancies arise as more and more material is written. Those who control
the developement should try to minimize such, of course, but it is
unreasonable to expect them to be 100% successful. Therefore, retroactive
adjustments and rationalizations are something we have to live with.

I might agree with you if it were a matter of \'piling up arbitrary rules
for why it shouldn\'t change the entire face of space travel\', but it isn\'t.
The one thing it affects is the economics of freight and passenger traffic
between high-volume star systems, and guess what: that is _already_ broken.
Further it makes not the tiniest particle of difference to the background as
it has been developed today, because very little has been written about long-
distance passenger traffic between high-volume star systems. I grant you
that it makes a bit of a difference to the future developement of the post-CT
milieux, but not a very big one. Future PCs may be able to get a ticket on a
jump-6 liner for Cr10,000 instead of for Cr35,000, but so what? Certainly the
economy of a tramp spaceship is practically unaffected by the existence or
absence of drop tanks.

And why? Because drop tanks have had little effect on history. And why?
Because they haven\'t been around for most of Traveller history. So it
is equally true that retaining them won\'t affect the history.

Again, I might be more inclined to agree with you if I was able to see any
of those big problems.

I see that you ignore the possibility of playing in an era where they
haven\'t been invented yet. As for these terrible ramifications, they
concern areas of the background about which very little has been published
yet. So what is the problem? If you wan\'t to deal with those ramifications
you either have to explore them yourself anyway, or wait until someone
else explores them for you. In either case the presense or absence of drop
tanks make no difference to your workload.

Just as the Rebellion presented a new setting in which the entire basis for
the interactions of worlds were different (You put that rather neatly).

Yes? You still need big expensive ships to do high jumps with drop tanks.

>ships arrive and depart from is another big change.

Are you talking about fuel stations at the 100 diameter limit? Because if
you are, I must point out to you that the economics of jump travel even
without drop tanks makes it profitable for ships to jump back and forth
between jump limits and leave it to intra-system shuttles to convey the
freight and passengers between surface and jump limit.

Try digging a little deeper.

Yes, but if I\'m running a CT campaign in 1116 then it\'s the short term
changes that interest me. Suddenly half my PCs should by rights be called
under arms again. Suddenly I can no longer send my characters on a trip
to Capital. Suddenly my NPC nobles have a whole new set of imperatives
driving them. Suddenly travel across borders become subject to new
procedures. And that\'s assuming I\'m running a campaign in Spinward Marches.
If I were running a campaign in Solomani Rim I\'d _really_ have some
fundamental changes in the way worlds interacted!

>All the rebellion ever really changed was who fought whom and who

Excuse me? Isn\'t that a pretty extensive change?

>It didn\'t do anything about the fundamental workings of society.

Neither do drop tanks. so they make long-distance travel cheaper. So what?
How many adventures can you think of where that made any difference at all?

I\'m sorry, I can\'t parse that sentence.

Hasn\'t this subject been added to the FAQ yet along with near-c rocks and
Technologically Elevated Dictators as \'done to death\'?

The primary reason for sticking with decks perpendicular to the axis of
thrust is simple; all my deckplans are already drawn that way...you think I
wanna draw all *new* deckplans?!?

Perpendicular to the axis is convenient when you land. If its a spacebound
ship, its more efficient to run inline. Thus tramp freighter (PC ships) and
airframes are best designed with a gravity well in mind, while mega freighters,
capitol ships, x-boats and other spacebound ships should be designed around the
primary gravitational force, their thrusters.

I was catching up on the posts from the past weekend and Hans Rancke-Madsen
and several other members have been carrying on a discussion concerning drop
tanks and the ability to change the back ground of the Traveller game.  

Well, IMTU, I expect the PCs to develop their Traveller Universe background
by solving problems.  IIRC, drop tanks came about as a cost saving measure
during a CT session.  The PCs IMTU took this one step further and developed
a "Fuel Bladder" system to be installed in their cargo hold.  When Jump
capacitors came about, they started saving up credits to get a big enough
capacitor to save Jump 1 energy for emergency jumps.  Then they worked on
how much jump distance they could glean out of a stripped ship. Then...you
see where I\'m going.

This development train of thought worked out the need for gravitational
compensators for high g manuvers...my wife was a med tech in the USAF and
remembered some research in the g-sled studies concerning the need for suits
and other compensatory measures..."So why not an on-board "mechanical"
gravitational system?"...and she is not a gear-head.

So let\'s take some guidance from the heretics on the list and say,
"Remember, IMTU..."

They\'re O-10\'s placed in a position of command.  If we\'re both Generals,
but I\'m in command of III Corps, and you\'re in command of 7th Army, you are
incharge no matter what is on our collars.

In the US Army, there are three seperate rank positions held a the pay

the Army.

This is somewhat misleading. It\'s not like inside a neutron there is an
electron and a anti-neutrino bouncing around; a neutron is also just composed
of three quarks. A neutron is an up quark (charge +2/3) and two down 
quarks (charge -1/3.) When a neutron decays, one of the down quarks changes
into an up quark; in the process it emits a electron. This is legal since
electrons (like all leptons) can be created out of nothing, as long as
charge+mass+momentum all balence - which they do, if a neutrino is created
at the same time going in the opposite direction. (It\'s technically an
anti neutrino for mildly complicated reasons.)

We\'ve heard bits and pieces of what various authors had planned.. but

Ah.  T4, or Marc Miller\'s Traveller was an attempt to redo Classic in the
light of twenty years experience.  The setting was the dawn of the
Imperium, the year 0.  Unfortunately, Imperium Games, the company producing
the game, quickly earned a reputation for extraordinarily shoddy products.
Marc is working on a revision (T4.1).  Some of the supplements are worth
picking up.

Central Supply Catalog, Psionics Institute, Pocket Empires, Emperor\'s
Arsenal, Alien Achieve, and Milieu:0 Campaign are all worth a look.  Avoid
at all cost any of the adventures, except maybe The Long Way Home/Gateway.
Do not look upon Starships or First Survey, lest thine eyes fry from horror.

If the vehicle is capable of reaching escape velocity, it should reach
orbit.. of course, contragrav drives have horrendous fall-offs in
effectiveness away from gravity wells.

Um... if you\'re going to explain physics, get it all the way right.  Leptons
can\'t be created from nothing any more than baryons can, you need to preserve
lepton number (mesons _can_ be created from energy, as can bosons).  The
conservation laws you need to pay attention to in particle physics are:
conservation of mass/energy
conservation of momentum
conservation of charge.
conservation of spin (possessed by a variety of particles)
conservation of baryon number (+1/3 per quark, -1/3 per antiquark.  Baryons
consist of 3 quarks, and thus have a baryon number of +1 or -1.  Mesons are
composed of a quark and an antiquark, and have baryon number 0).
conservation of lepton number (electron, muon, tau, and the three corresponding
neutrino types all have +1; corresponding antiparticles have -1).

Due to the difference in mass between a neutron and a proton, the only way it
can preserve both mass and charge is by creating an electron -- it then also
has to create an electron antineutrino in order to preserve lepton number (and
spin).  If there is a significant mass bonus it could instead create pions
(probably two, I don\'t recall if pions have spin).

In more detail, here are signatures on the FFS2 scale for all these

Rocky asteroids are greyish (albedo 0.2 - 0.3). 
C-type asteroids are dark asteroids (albedo 0.05) mostly consisting of 
carbon compounds.
Comet nucleii and Kuipter belt objects roll 1d6; on 3- use the rocky
asteroid values, on 4+ use the C-type values.

These values assume a 1-m radius asteroid. For larger or smaller asteroids
use the following modifiers:

Asteroid Size modifiers:

Detection can be calculated using the Definitive Sensor Rules (available
on the web or via email.) In essence, one adds the sensor sensitivity
(from FFS2 or the conversion notes in the DSR) to the target signature
and subtracts the range to calculate the "signal":

Signal = Sensitivity + Signature - Range + modifiers

and then compares to the following chart:
SIGNAL  active detection        passive detection
        task                    task
<0      (target cannot be detected under any circumstances)
0       Impossible              Impossible
0.5     Average                 Staggering (TNE: Formidable)
1.0     (automatic detection)   Average
1.5                             Easy
2.0                             (automatic detection.)

Ranges are taken from the following chart:

100000 AU (1/2 parsec)						18.5
1 parsec							19
3 parsec							19.5
10 parsec							20.0

So, for example, a typical scout (Sensitivity=13.0) scanning for a 
rocky asteroid (passive (vis) signature = 0.5) at a range of 1 AU would
have a signal of (13.0) + (0.5) - 13.5 = 0.0, for an 
Impossible task to detect the asteroid.

A labship with a science-grade PEMS-14 looking for old gas giants in an
empty hex would have a signal of 14.0 (sensor) + 0.5 (empty hex science bonus) 
+ 4.5 (signature with science bonus) - 19 (range) = 0.5, a Staggering
task.

Remember the following modifiers to sensor sensitivity (taken from
the most recent version of the DSR) based on sensor location:

Sensor Location		Passive/Vis	Passive/IR	Active
Inner zone		-0.5		-0.5		 0.0
Habitable zone		 0.0		 0.0		 0.0
Outer zone		+0.5		+0.0		 0.0
Oort cloud/empty hex    +1.0            +0.0 (normal)	 0.0
					+0.5 (sci-grade)

(The full DSR also includes modifiers for long scans (1 day) and for
scanning only a single arc, which if combined allow a +1.0 for taking
2 weeks to do a scan.)

Actually, the other discussion about partical physics would seem to do bad things

Canon Traveller physics, the Grav vehicles need a Gravity source to work

velocity just as the Grav drives craps out due to the Grav drive reaching
minimal resistance from the planet). I don\'t buy interplanetary travel
however. I would presume that you would need a starship or non starship\'s
manuever drive. A good example of this concept is in the FASA games
Intercepter-Renagade Legion-Leviathan series. There are two seperate drives.
There is a vacuum manuever drive for fighters (they can also work in an
atmosphere) and a anti-grav drive for Grav Tanks. The books even describe an
orbital assault. The spaceships kick the Grav tanks out at a velocity that
will not maintain orbit (ie reentry). The Grav tanks make a controlled
meteroric reentry until the grav drives kick in. This gives incentive for
designing Striker and FFS Grav tanks and APC\'s with cabin pressure. I asume
that is what the G carrier (which is mentioned all over the LBB\'s) does.
Striker also implies that an Air/Raft has a Grav drive of .1G, so I asume that
this is the minimum to acheve orbit.

     I\'ll dig it up what I have after I dig my way out of the backlog
caused by two weeks on the road.  A fair chunk of it was published in two
issues of the Traveller Chronicle.  The actual archives of the discussion
group may or may not still be on line.
    I\'m in the process of putting my various gearhead designs from that
project on line.  Use the URL in the sig, and follow it to the Traveller

Actually, it\'s far, far worse...Imagine a subspace linked computer bank
that tied in with a comm-badge, constantly updating the bank with the
person\'s physio-mental image, so that if they died, a transporter could
replicate the person back to life.

See Stephen Golding\'s book, "The Eternity Brigade" for details on this.

Depends what you mean by "like".  I mean like a wormhole in that the
process takes a lot of energy to set up..  Otherwise I would say
that there are significant differenes.

Well, this isn\'t fully explained, and in no way contrains how energy is
applied to a jump.  One reasonable suggestion is that you don\'t move
through jumps space (perhaps it is even meaningless of talking about
moving through jump space).  You just don\'t enter it and leave it
from the same points in real space.

> How do you control a 28
> Trillion Mj explosion?

Well, you don\'t do an explosion.  However, one of my pet theories (its
not necessary for energy use without capacitors, but I do think it ties
up a few loose ends) is that that act of jumping is what allows you to
run a reactor at such high throughputs.  The initial stages of jumping
anchors the grid partially in jump space, giving you an energy sink to
pour energy into.

Well, if you want to invoke the idea that you don\'t need to be 100
diameters
away from other objects until you _finish_ jumping (which I don\'t care
for,
but its not constained by anything in the background that I know about),
you
can make drop tanks work without capacitors for both energy and
displacement
mass theories.  The energy, mass, or whatever gets used up early in the
jump, the
tanks are ejected, and then jump is completed with minimal need for
additional
energy.  However, I think drop tanks are mistake (they open the door for
radical changes in what ships need to jump) and should be forgotten
about
and ignored as much as possible.

Depends on how it works.  Maybe you allow the energy to disapate.  Maybe
you naturally pop out after a week or so.  Etc.  It really says nothing
about who energy needs to be applied.

I don\'t know if you are refering to me.  I did point that out and
I saw a reply that claimed there was a problem there.  As a mentioned
in my reply, I didn\'t see a problem.

I\'m sorry, I don\'t see your point.

And why don\'t you just have a check valve?  Or why don\'t you just
not fill it all the way?

So you design the ship to use heavier tanks.  Or just only put
as much fuel in them as you need.  Makes more sense
than require specially designed tanks for each model.

Well, in fact that rules are inconsistent here.  You need explosive
bolts
to hurl drop tanks away, but you can delay jumping several hours.  The
bottom
line is that these don\'t appear to be consistently thought out and
nothing really depends on them.  You can assume jumping is right away
with vitually no change to the background (and in some cases it is
already implied that you do jump right away).  In any case, even if
can delay, that only means that you can keep some link to jump
space open for a while, not that the energy doesn\'t have to go into
jumping.

Well, in fact you don\'t assume it doesn\'t "improve one little bit"
at all.  You assume it doesn\'t improve enough to give a significant
change in game mechanics (which don\'t reflect every small change
in efficiency).  Nor is this inconsitent with a technology that 
is up against a fundamental limit.

(However, I personally go with a different theory, the dump it
right into jump space theory, but that is neither here nor there).

I actually agree with that statement.  But I guess I feel it is better
to
drop out ill considered additions (such as not having jump torps or drop
tanks) that screw up the fundamental basis fo the setting and it is
better
to use alternative explinations that are as close as possible to the
original (such as simply changing how energy is used for jump rather
than trying to come up with a whole new theory and fit it to the
characteristics of the old one).  I also sometimes think that there is
tendency to try and find, or even create, situations that don\'t make
sense
(such as the whole pircay thing where a lot of the objects rested on
making assumptions that are not canon) (the latter may be so common
becuase it gives people and chance to play with the background.)

However, I don\'t agree that it is ever to late to remember that
a believable background follows as naturally as possible from basic
principals and use that to guide your actions.  Changes should
be as true to the basic principals, not patches that seem to 
fix what is immediately apparent.

And that is part of what I keep pointing out to people that claim that
have dealt with all the ramification of changing jump drives to
displacement
mass theory, or introducing jump torps, or allowing drop tanks (and why
these are so ill considered).  You simply can\'t know all the
ramifications
and you are simply introduces a source of yet more ramifications that
will need their own "patches" in the future, making the background 
more and more a hokey patchwork of things that all just happen to
work a certain way.

And that doesn\'t, to me, in anyway make changing the fundmentals of
space travel OK.  That will only create a whole new cascade of
ramifications that need to be dealt with.

Well, I have already agreed that any change that could reasonably
be introduced as a "new" technology, can be introduced as something
new without invalidating the existing history.  OTOH, that is the
choice of someone who isn\'t fixing the existing background, but
replacing it (keeping only the historical part of the setting) and
is clearly a direction that not everyone will want to go in.

Well, I happen to think that eliminating the need for ships to carry
jump fuel is a big change.  But I guess we will have to let other
make up their own minds as we aren\'t going to convince each other.

Shrug, or those who like them can play an alternate time line.
One can always propose that active support be directly primarily
at the setting you want and those that don\'t agree have to adapt
their campaigns around that.

Well, no.  The rebellion presented a setting in which the _motivations_
for interaction are different.  The basis for interaction is the same
as wars, trade, communications, etc. are all still conducted in exactly
the same way.

Even if I agreed (I haven\'t seen the basis for this, and its not like
I haven\'t diagreed with you on things like this before), we should then
introduce new technologies that make even more problems for the existing
background?  I thought you agreed that we wanted to be true to the

I you don\'t need to carry jump fuel when you jump, that makes sending
fuel (as cargo) easier.  So if you want to go someplace without
a jump station, you just jump in both the ship and the fuel to
send it back.

I agree. Most "early" tech deckplans will display a perpendicular style such
as the AZH, as would many warships, IMHO. If the G-comp blows it\'s a better
postion to have \'down\' be opposite the direction of thrust! I see the
so-called \'normal\' orientation as being used mostly on small vessels,
intended for airplane style landings. This is more of a convenience, so that
passengers and crew can enter/exit the ship without having to re-orient, it
alos means that the internal gravity doesn\'t have to be left running.

Now let\'s have some ideas on mechanisms to allow spin sections to compensate
for thrust. Those B-5 ships look neat, with large spin sections rotating,
but once under thrust (if you have any thing above fractional g) and all of
that hull space becomes mostly useless. I\'ve been working on such a design
for weeks and can\'t come up with an answer I really like. Anyone else have
some ideas?

Well, rotating hull designs are a realistic or semi-realistic option, and under
those circumstances you will probably either be using a short burst drive (for
which period the hull gets locked down), or be using an extremely low thrust
drive (.01 Gs or lower).  Another flaw of rotating hulls is that they act like
immense gyroscopes, you better not want to turn while using rotational gravity.

Use habitat balls. Free floating modules that rotate such that down is the
greatest force acting on it.  Like those "monster eyes" Taco Bell puts out
around Halloween. They could be implemented with eccentric axial pivots.
Transfer between habitat balls would be problematic though.

I suppose you could pull a stunt like that with something like the classic lab
ship.  Connect each module with a universal joint with a umbilical connecting
it.  Then you spin the modules for standard centrifugal force, but twist your
ring enough to compensate for the forward thrust.  When landing, the modules
would be rotated so that down is towards the planet and then stop the spinning.

Then the large uncompensated volume in the middle can be used for fuel or other
non-fragile cargo.

drop tanks and jump drives and jump fuel work and whether drop tanks let you
have external tankers/jump stations, etc.)
(I\'m curious as to what TTL heretics think of this approach.)
One quick note on the subject (which I will then go back to avoiding): much
of the heat would be removed from this argument if jump drive mass and fuel
consumption scaled as the ship\'s mass rather than volume. The savings for
drop tanks (or magic tankers) is large becuase a large fraction of a Traveller
high-jump ship\'s volume is fuel tankage, and jump drive size/fuel requirements
scale as volume - so hauling J-5 fuel tanks around doubles (roughly) the 
size of your ship, and there\'s a big advantage to tankers or drop tanks.

If jump drive and fuel size dependend on a ship\'s mass, however, this
advantage almost completely disappears for most civilian ships; since fuel
is so light, a jump-5 freighter is less than 7% jump fuel by mass - so
putting that fuel in drop tanks and dropping it (or getting it from a tanker)
only saves you about 7% of the cost of the ship - not enough to be worth the
hassle. If we make jump drive scale as the ship\'s mass not including fuel
then the math gets painful for designing ships but the advantage goes away
almost completely - all you save is the mass of the hull shell holding the fuel,
which is negligible for medium-sized civilian ships. For military ships,
there\'s more of an advantage since mil ships usually have heavily armoured 
hulls that account for a large fraction of their mass - but military ships
are unlikely to embrace the jump tanker/drop tank approach, at least for 
all their fuel, for other (obvious) reasons, and could get almost all the
advantage by putting the jump fuel in lightly-armoured demountable tanks
anyway.

Making jump performance depend on mass would have two other big advantages.
First, it removes the weaselly "carry jump fuel as water or methane" 
approach some people favour (you can cram more hydrogen atoms into a given
volume if you carry them as water - at the cost of a tremendous weight
penalty, of course.) Second, since ship maneuver performance mostly depends
on mass (in realistic design systems), we could design ships completely
around mass rather than volume - creating a "one-pass" design system that
people like Philip favour, where you specify the ship mass, add components
until you get close to that mass (including a maneuver drive whose performance
you can completely specify, as opposed to having to iterate like you do in
FFS2), then figure out the volume needed and wrap hull and armour around it.
On this basis I could turn FFS2 into something (almost) as simple as High 
Guard.

  What if you have counter rotating sections? Wouldn\'t that cancel out the

It will make it more practical to turn the ship, but the connection between the
counter-rotating segments will have to be extremely strong or the ship will rip
itself apart when you turn, and in any case _being_ in any rotating section
while it is turning will be exceedingly unpleasant (if you aren\'t going to have
people strapped in, for a 100m radius ring a turning rate of 1 degree per
second will be serious lurching of the deck, 5-10 degrees will be bouncing
people off the walls).

Yes, Neptune/Uranus are "small" gas giants. Book (p. 39) defines the size ranges
to be 20,000 km to 60,000 km radius for small, 60,000 to about 120,000 km radius
for large.

According to the WBH, SGGs run from a UWP size of 20 to 100, LGGs 110 to

Ya know, being the Evil Genius that I am, I just thought of something. 

Play  this from the other side.  The TL 3 culture, in the midst of a
Renaissance type period, when all of a sudden these wizards or demons show
up, take over, and start upsetting the apple cart!  All sorts of call for
heroes!

Set it about thirty years along, and you could have natives trained in
"wizardry" working alongside the rebels...

I\'m putting together a campaign (Bowie, MD area) set in the

players has roled up a Noble who got a Yacht. Being a devious
sort, he has proposed a non-standard yacht, inspired by the
rock he found in THUDD. I\'m using MT rules mostly; I never
got into TNE and T4. I also plan to use some of the CT

This doesn\'t imply an uplift for the local populace, merely a long time
getting the required raw ingredients together. If, for instance, they
needed a lot of lanthanum; \'all\' they needed to do was locate supplies of
lanthanum ore, mine and refine enough of it to do what they needed, If
they had to explore on foot, and do most of the mining at TL-3, 38 years
seems a lot more likely a time frame.

Not surprising if they needed to conserve fuel and/or materials for the
various repairs. For the local populace, they might have merely been this
really strange tribe that appeared, showed wondrous things, and a peculiar
penchant for living at local levels of technology, and then one day
vanished back into the sky whence they came.

I like this a lot.  The "fill the box" system is a lot less enjoyable than
the "here is the stuff.  How much other stuff do I need to add to make a
real ship?" system.  I have been working at something like this for a
while, but have not had a lot of time for it.

Anyone who did this would likely get a guest spot in a game as a victim :-).

I can\'t say that I\'ve done much system converting, and T4 is not my
Traveller of preference, but one of my current Traveller campaigns is set
in a background very similar to 2300\'s.

I use Gleise\'s Near Star Catalog for my campaign "map" (the 2300 map is
useful, but they put the in-game names of inhabited systems on it, instead
of the catalog name/number - difficult, if you aren\'t using *precisely*
that background).  I set the tech level to TL 10:  high enough to be
interesting, but limited to Jump-1.  This is key.

Rather than the usual Traveller assumption of one parsec per jump, I set
the jump range to 7.73 ly - the maximum range for stutterwarp ships in 2300
- - and insist that all jumps originate and end in stellar-sized gravity
wells.  This gives a pretty fair "grid" of possible jump routes. The
drawback is that I never figured out just what "Jump-2" would really mean,
other than bridging the gaps that were too great for Jump-1.  The search
for the "Quantum 2 Jumpdrive" is the Holy Grail of the campaign.

I assumed a preceding period of interstellar colonization by STL ships,
which gave some worlds a decent popluation before jump drive was invented,
and a modicum of political independence from the juggernaut of United
Earth.  That puts the timeframe of the campaign around AD 2450, with jump
drive less than 50 years old.  The campaign map I made flat by depicting
only the most important routes connecting the inhabited worlds, with a
symbol to tell the players whether a given route is the only possible
connection between the worlds shown, or whether there are bypasses.  The
Solar System is also fully colonized, and in fact sees as much adventuring
traffic as the outworlds.

The rest of the campaign I run with pretty straight-forward TNE rules.

White Star had three sister ships, all named -ic:
Titanic, Olympic, and Brittanic
Cunard used the -ia naming convention:
Lusitania, Mauretania, and Aquetania
The Germans and Italians did not follow these anglo naming rules:
Vaterland was a German ship & I don\'t remember any of the others nor the
Italian competitor for the Transatlantic Blue Riband (the award for fastest
atlantic crossing)
>i know of the Olympia, and the Vaterland...  i just cant rember the fourth
>ship...

Interesting Tidbit re Cunard:
Cunard officials had decided to name their latest & greatest liner The
Queen Victoria, evoking the majesty and luxury of that by-gone era and
sticking with their particular naming convention. However, they were
concerned that the crown might not be pleased with their choice.  If the
King did not want a multi-hundred ton steel bathtub named after his
grandmother, then it was back to the drawing board.  They approached George
V and said "We would like to name our new liner after England\'s greatest
Queen."  Geordie said "My wife will be very pleased."  Cunard bowed to the
inevitable and named the liner "The Queen Mary."

ObTraveller: It would not be unreasonable to expect a shipping line to
follow a particular naming convention, banking on the reputation of the
"Rose of Sylea" for luxury to help them sell passage on the "Rose of
Regina" and the "Rose of Terra".

My THUDD design was based on a expert system that does just that.  You specify a
few things, like maneuver G\'s, jump capability, etc.  Then declare your statics,
like cargo space and passenger staterooms.  The expert system then figures out
your minimum ship volume.

Yup. And another Traveller gone. I don\'t think it was too successful.  Still
more, there\'s GURPS: Traveller on the way. And there\'s T"4.1" coming too.

  Rather than having a ring, have independent ring segments attached
by struts to an adjustable collar of some sort. This might be best as
a warship configuration, as it means that the ring won\'t be totally
disabled when part of it takes battle damage. The collar/hub would
adjust to balance remaining segments when next spinning under those
conditions.

  Preparing for combat would entail folding the segments down against 
the hull for protection (and reduced profile, I guess). They could be
rigged so that the folded position was perpendicular to the thrust
axis.

While it\'s true the early deckplans have such an orientation, it is not
more of a convenience. Even on airframe configuration spacecraft that make
airplane style landings, the engines can be built into the belly of the
craft so it doesn\'t have to re-orient itself. More likely, airframe
spacecraft will land by gliding or with grav compensators and not their
main engines. And of course streamlined spacecraft will have to have ship\'s
\'down\' the opposide of the direction of thrust in order to land at all.
IMHO the perpendicular style deckplans are the result of game designers
thinking starships are a kind of ocean vessel.

I have seen a few designs for this kind of thing in a NASA publication and
on the Lunar Institute of Technology web site. The basic idea is that the
spin section pivots along an axis 90 degrees to the spin axis. In one
design, the spin section rotates at the end of a boom, like the Salt \'n
Pepper Shaker amusement park ride. In another, a group of sections in a
torus-like configuration rotate inward, like rolling a stocking. In all
cases these work for accelerations only up to 1 G. At zero G, the boom or
torus spins normally and the inhabited section is pivoted so \'down\' is away
from the axis of rotation. As the ship accelerates, the spin is reduced and
the inhabited section pivots toward the thrust end of the ship until, at 1
G thrust, it does not spin and is pointed toward the nose of the ship. A
comfortable 1 G is maintained in the cabin at all times.

Nope, but if (like my parents once did) your car breaks down on a mountain

parents\' car had, and still has a complete set of tools in the boot).

A fortnight ago my AD&D game almost died a horrible death because one of
the players admitted to liking TNG, DD9 and Voyager, and refused to admit
that they have nothing resembling internal consistency. He also maintained
that the technology made sense, though he did retract that after four of us
all pointed out neat weapon systems that would be doable with ST style
anti-matter, none of which TNG, etc use.

And what\'s more it\'s dead easy to get all the ship crew you need. All you

Another reason for perpendicular decks on small ships is that you\'ll need
fewer decks, and in a small ship the elevators and/or stairwells comsume a
reasonable proportion of your availible volume, so having only a few decks
would help cut down this sort of wastage.

2300AD often has contra-rotating pair of hull sections. Would this mean
that the gyroscopic effects would cancel, or do you get some other effect?

Elevators, stairwells, etc. are comparable to the volume taken up by long
hallways.  Architecturally speaking, its wasted space.

I thought of this, based in part on a 2300 ship (name eludes me at the
moment) design. I like the idea a lot, however the "joint" for the strutt is
a real b*#$h. I ran several cad models but couldn\'t come up with a design
that would allow access when the strutt was folded, or it was entirely to
massive to be practical. It would probably be ok for a VERY large ship, but
not for the early exploration vehicle I\'m looking for.

I also thought of having "hamock" style floor sections in multiple
comartmentsbut movement between the sections looks like it will be too
complicated. Not to mention a LOT of wasted space and mass.

The multiple joint ring that some one else mentioned looked good at first,
but that many joint seals looks like a disaster waiting to happen.

I\'ve come to 2 conclusions...

1) I see why I don\'t work for NASA

2) A pure zero-g ship (no grav section at all) is probably the best option,
but somewhat uncompfortable for long voyages. Spin grav will probably be a
practical solution for a "stationary" habitat, but ships that need to
manuver will be largely zero-g, until artificial grav and compensators come
into play.

I intended to do just that.  Using Jim V\'s Starmap, i created a near future

Have you seen Jim V\'s Starmap?  Excellent program.  Uses the Gliese\'s 3rd
Catalog, the most update, i think.  He put in some random filler too (where
there appear to be "gaps").  You can create your own completely fresh galaxies
or use the Gliese 3rd Catalog data.

FTL hasn\'t been discovered yet in mine.  I\'m going to allow 2 to 4 types of
FTL, i think.  Wormhole\'s.  Subspace (and keyhole drives ala B5). and am
considering stutterwarp and J-drives (i used to not like em much, but they\'ve
been growing on me).

Interesting.  I\'ve envisioned much the same.  Mars, the asteroid belt, but not
much beyond that (primarily military).

High Guard ignored mass, effectivly. FFS doesnt ... mass, length, surface
area, volume and cost are your effective constraints when designing
something (length is important for the range of meson guns and particle
weapons ... if you want an x range PAW at tl Y, your craft will need to be
z meters long to fit it in).

Grav plates are much more efficient than thrusters and combat at planetary
ranges tends not to have speed-of-light lag as a factor in combat, so
combat vehicles can both be more massive and need to be more massive (you
can\'t dodge a laser beam at 10 km).

IIRC it\'s the Suffren class of French cruisers. They solved the problem by
having airlocks that mated to locks on the hull when the spin capsules lie
flat.

What makes you believe that the crew of the Lienquiets taught the worlds
natives enough to bring them to TL A ?  When I read this bit I
interpreted it as it took the crew of the ship 38 years, using their
machine shop, to build the toolt, to build the tools, to mine the ore,
to process the ore, to fabricate the part, etc for its jump drive.

I love Star Trek dearly, but as far as actual tech goes, they are way
around the bend.  The transporter itself is a direct impossibility,
which they neatly side-stepped in one show by claiming it had
"Heisenburg Compensaters" in it.  Gee that\'s neat.  :)

Yes, they tend to discover more particles and beam types then anything
else too.  This last Voyager with the "Omega" particles was laughable. 
The entire Federation scared stiff over something slightly more potent
then an anti-matter bomb.  I felt it was overplayed.  They should have
had the Omega Molecule be something that destroyed parts of the
universe, in order to make it a real gut-wrenching threat.

  Actually, they did acknowledge it. IIRC, the APC in the Kinunir at
14 Dt is almost certainly the 168m^3 several hundred metric ton brick
listed in Striker Book: 3. Clearly, the hull alone of the Kinunir must
weigh some multiple thousands of tons; therefore it follows that assumed
relative density of ship structures should be on the order of 10-20 metric
tons per displacement tons.

  FWIW, that TL: 15 Marine APC has more firepower than Terra of 1945.
It really does point up a Kinunir\'s ability to function as a low-tech
colonial policeman.

  That\'s a heck of a good point. The genius Solomani, having gone from 
TL 9 to 15 in a couple centuries, then never develop anything else, with
the possible exception of a few TL 18-21 genetics, terraforming, and 
robotics technologies; you know, stuff. Nothing you\'d notice.

  This ignores how the Solomani had J-6 or so yet couldn\'t maintain
interstellar trade.

  It doesn\'t explain why almost everyone else lost TL\'s over the
Long Night. Nor does it explain why TL 15 Terra didn\'t dominate
(or resist - successfully - Imperial encroachment).

   It certainly doesn\'t explain why the Sword Worlders (Terrans who
left around -420 [AM6, p.12]) weren\'t giggling at the primitive
Imperials whom they would have butchered in the Frontier Wars; why
the Sword Worlders would lose their TL 15 heritage would otherwise
need to be explained.

>>   It is entirely consistent for Terra to be early TL 15 in 1000, TL 11

  This encapsulates what I\'ve concluded. I\'ve yet to see a GDW product
that contradicts this explicitly, and would appreciate being informed
of any such reference.

 Remember, the third time might get you the real thing :)

Didn\'t the sword worlder\'s feudal type of society lend to the break-down
of their tech levels?  As more and more sword worlders left the sword
worlds, this would drain valuable people and techs would it not? 
Eventually those who were left would be less and less able to fix things
as they broke, and unable to create new things?

That dosen\'t have to mean that the host society was boosted to TL 9+ in
that time, merely that the ship, with all its workshops, still needed
38 years to manufacture one single component. It is often possible to
hand-manufacture things long before it becomes economically feasible to
mass-manufacture them (revolvers were made almost a century before
Samuel Colt started manufacturing them, various clockwork mechanisms
were made during the reinaissance, etc.). Plus, as I said, the ship
would have had the use of its workshops to speed up the manufacture.

Actually, the "airplane style" decks are *parallel* to the thrust,
while AZH type decks are perpendicular to it. Other than that, you\'ve
got a point.

I just had a *nasty* thought. Have kironide discovered. First bit is
too see if any of the players recognize the name. If they do, you\'ll
shortly know just how good they are at role playing as they have to
struggle to keep what *they* know and what their *character* knows

Then comes the fun when the effects get accidentally discovered. The
ship that has the ore, and knows where it came from is going to have
*everyone* after it if the word leaks out.

The usual solutions prposed for when the ship will spend most of it\'s
time coasting are either a *long* ship that spins "end over end" (which
means that the "upper" decks are only usable during zero g and spin,
but the "lower" decks are always usable) or else seperating the ship
into two segments attached by long cables and spinning that.

Depends on the constant. I recall some of the effects of various
changes, but not which constant was being changed:

Matter more complex than hydrogen can\'t form

Stars don\'t last long enough for life to develop

*Matter* can\'t form

And one subtle one. Water boils at around -100 C. (has to do with the
van der waals force which is a consequence of some quantum effect)

I\'ve once been to Turkey on a holiday, and my father drove the car.
Although he\'s european, he had no problems driving there, as he soon
recognized the way you drive there - hoot once: I\' m coming, hoot twice:
I\'m getting over, hoot thrice: Thank you. (Or so...)

When my father has been to Russia, this time as a pedestrian, he told us
later how you get over the streets: look left, look right, hear left, hear
right, and when you\'re really sure no one\'s coming, cross the street ...

We\'ve also travelled England with a german car, there\'s no problem in it
until you get an unclear situation and have to evade - to the OTHER side!

I believe a higher vehicle skill will compensate for these problems, but
it\'s getting interesting for everyone.

A chinese curse: Will you live in interesting times!

Not if the change is to a simpler concept. Besides, I\'m not (in this case)
advocating a change but the retention of an already-existing feature.

Not if the change is to a simpler concept. Besides, drop tanks does not
change the fundamentals of space travel. Turning it into a warp drive or
making jumps instantaneous, now _that_ would be a fundamental change.

Eliminating the need for all ships everywhere to carry their own fuel would
be a fairly big change, I suppose (though not nearly as big as, say,
requiring them to travel in convoy in order to protect them from enemy
raiders), but that is not the case. It only works for ships whose route
never touches a star system without drop tank facilities. Which happens
to be a class of ships that has not for any practical purposes been
touched upon by any Traveller publication so far.

Tell you what. Give me a few examples of features in some published Traveller
material that is invalidated by the logical ramifications of the existence of
drop tanks. That would convince me to re-evaluate my stance on drop tanks.

Wow! That one deserves to be nominated for the World Hairsplitting

In the rebellion the entire basis for the interaction of worlds were
different from the Classic Era.

Exactly as big and expensive as before. The cost of cargo space is the same
as the cost of fuel tankage. Indeed, the fuel cost is increased with drop
tanks (Quite significantly increased, in fact, if you go by the true costs);
it\'s only the per item (freight and passengers) cost that drops because each
ship can carry enough more to compensate for the increased fuel costs.

What new technologies? Drop tanks are already a part of the existing
background. It\'s you who want to eliminate them. OK, I\'m not opposed to
eliminating troublesome bits of canon, if there is a real need to do so.
(I can\'t very well be, since there are several parts of the background
I would like to change). But IMO the proper basic assumption is that
canon should be changed as little as possible and that the burden of
proof lies on the person who propose the change. You can talk all you
like about how likely it is that keeping drop tanks will mess up
something else some time in the future, but until you actually point
to a genuine contradiction or a major problem  --  in a well-reasoned
argument rather than a vague allusion  --  drop tanks must IMO be
presumed innocent.

I notice that you ignored the small list of fundamental changes the

Yes, but does it affect anything that has _already_ been established about
the Traveller background? I fully admit that the day someone tries to set
up an extensive economic model for a high-population system close to other
such systems, then the existence/non-existence of drop tanks will make a
difference. But no one has done anything like that so far, so what\'s the
big problem?

Ah, I see. Yes, that\'s true. Again, so what? Or, to repeat the question I
posed above, can you give me a few examples of features in some published
Traveller material that is invalidated by the fact that laying out fuel
dumps would be easier? (Note that it just becomes easier; it has been
possible to lay out fuel depots since the first jump-1 ship was built).

Ah... you need explosive bolts for the 1105 version of drop tanks; you can
wait several hours with the Rebellion Era version. This could be no more
than the \'discrepancy\' between a Sinclair and a Pentium. Of course, in
that case I have to abandon the "access mass" explanation. Oh well...
back to the drawing board... 

>The bottom line is that these don\'t appear to be consistently thought out

Any more than a lot of the rest of the Traveller background, but you don\'t
seem inclined to throw that away. Getting rid of something should be a
last resort.

>and nothing really depends on them.

That\'s not the point when it comes to already-established elements. The
question in that case is, do they conflict with anything else. So far
you\'ve failed to come up with anything.

>You can assume jumping is right away with vitually no change to the

I think I have to change my mind and agree with you. If you can delay jump
for several hours after the fuel has been expended, then some sort of link
to jumpspace must exist, and it must be able to remain linked to the ship
while it moves in real space. That sounds more like an energy field than
a bubble of hydrogen. OK. What I propose now is that the fuel is burnt,
but that the energy from that is not stored in the capacitors. Rather, it
is dumped directly into jumpspace and builds up a field _almost_ to the
threshold. Then the capacitors discharge a final (comparatively small)
burst of carefully controlled energy and puts the ship over the threshold.
If the final discharge is not made, the jump field slowly dissipates over
time. How\'s that?

Which means it improves less than 2% over those 7 TLs (Otherwise it would
affect the fuel needed for jump-6 ships). Compare that to the improvement
in the related field of ordinary fusion reactors and you will see that
you\'re splitting hairs again.

This works also the other way round. One of my players does his characters
the \'nevermind\' way, i.e. he calculates them to die in some accident soon.
The problem is that he seems not to be interested in fleshing out his
characters, he always uses them as dummies for the fight. Not the way I\'d
like to play either.

That would cancel out the gyroscopic effects.  All the other problems of

My take on this is to have individual sections, that all, one the ship is
under drive, are able to rotate slightly rearward.  The result of this is
to have the forward thrust and rotational acceleration add vectors, and
the section\'s rotation puts its floors perpendicular to that vector. 
This requires additional equipment, and its a pain.  It also creates a
problem if some section jams in one position or another.  A better method
is just to use the spin sections for something not required during major
maneuvers, like crew quarters.  Anyone in those sections during
acceleration would have webbing on the walls to help them move about, or
to relax in during said maneuvers.  Frankly, I dont think spin habs will
see much use on military ships, they get in the way.

The one problem with this is, as these take damage, their center of
gravity changes.  Even at low rotation rates, if the mass of the spin
habs is considerable, and I think its safe to assume they would, the
altered cg will start to put additional stress on the ship\'s structure. 
It wouldn\'t take long for cyclic fatigue to set in, and suddenly large
pieces start to come off...................

Not really useful if you have little time prior to combat.  Also, you
need a fly-wheel system to take up the rotational energy, stopping spin
habs is not easy, and takes time.  If you keep them rotating during fold
in, the rotation rate will also increase, putting additional stress  on
the structure.

Elevators, stairwells, etc. are comparable to the volume taken up by long
hallways.  Architecturally speaking, its wasted space.

One thing I see on some small ship designs (a Solomani Patrol Corvette
from FASA\'s Adventure Class Ships, a Vargr Raider from one of the
later JTAS(?)) is a restriction on hallways. The Solomani ship doesn\'t
really have hallways at all - they hook things together with crew quarters
and maintenance spaces. The Vargr ship even uses one of the Airlocks
as an access route to another deck.

If it weren\'t for the two ungodly-long access corridors in the Empress 
Marava Far Trader, it would also be almost corridor-less - and considering 
how you almost have to go through the cargo bay to get from the crew
quarters to the bridge anyway, I think they could have done without those
corridors - like the Beowulf Free Trader.

That\'s the kind of action another player of my group did short ago. As a

group \'civilians\' by stepping in its way. I left him badly injured, but
alive, as this was his first heroic action. We both at first didn\'t know
if he would survive, when he came with that idea.

OK, so those two ranks were not separate ranks and did not have their own
distinctions?

OK, so you\'re saying that O1 to O10 are just pay scales and that General of
the Armies and General of the Army were both the same pay scale as General?  

BTW. does Sergeant-Majors, Command Sergeant-Majors and Sergeant-Major of
the Army have different distinctions?

Ah, I see. Yes, that\'s true. Again, so what? Or, to repeat the question I
posed above, can you give me a few examples of features in some published
Traveller material that is invalidated by the fact that laying out fuel
dumps would be easier? (Note that it just becomes easier; it has been
possible to lay out fuel depots since the first jump-1 ship was built).

The nearest stars to Terra are farther than Jump-1. Earth explorers used 
Jump-1 for intra-system jumps for a while, then made it to the nearest
star (and the Vilani mining station there) by using fuel depots.

PRESS RELEASE

With little fanfare, the first Iikasukhi free trader slipped out of
construction yard 76b earlier today. Designed for the independent trader,
the Iikasukhi is Udararuukin\'s newest trading ship. Low cost, reliability,
and excellent profit potential make the Iikasukhi the perfect choice for
free traders. Economic analysis shows that even without performing
speculative trading, the Iikasukhi can perform admirably. In the hands of an
experienced crew, devoting some or all of the large cargo bay to more
lucrative cargos, a tidy profit can be achieved.

While capable of carrying six passengers in second-class accomodations, and
another six in low berths, the Iikasukhi is a cargo vessel, with fifty
percent of its displacement devoted to a single large cargo bay. Gravtic
loading equipment is provided near the loading door, in the aft section of
the ship.

Crew accomodations are comfortable, with three small staterooms and a larger
suite stateroom. The suite can be used for the owner aboard, the captain, or
it can be split into a stateroom and office, to handle business matters. The
crew are separated from the passengers by a solid bulkhead, and a crew mess
is separate from the passenger galley. This improves anti-hijacking
security. For errands, a single air/raft is provided.

The ship carries a pair of RN-64b thruster plate assemblies, capable of
driving the ship at a solid 1G acceleration while fully loaded (2.2Gs
unloaded). A single Tvorak FarLeap II jump drive is connected to a custom
built fusion plant to provide jumpspace translation ability of one parsec.
The ship is streamlined, and mounts standard contra-gravitic systems to
facilitate atmospheric operations. The internal gravity compensators provide
upto 3Gs of inteneral gravity, while compensating upto 2Gs of acceleration.
The Iikasukhi is well suited to operations in the frontier, as it carries
its own fuel purification system to process unrefined fuel. Fuel scoops and
water intake valves are standard.

For defence, the ship mounts a single dorsal turret, capable of mounting any
standard 3ton weapon system. Available power is only .75MW, but in combat
situations the purifcation plant can be taken off line, freeing another
1.2MW of power.

The Iikasukhi can be comfortably operated by three individuals (pilot,
navigator, and engineer), with a medic recommended for passengers. In a
pinch, the ship can be flown by a single individual, altough such operation
is against Imperial regulations.

This is what I had in mind - that the search would be done locally at

Two things:

Thanks. The free-floating planet/brown dwarf models I have access to only
go down to Saturn mass, so I guess I\'ll have to do some interpolation.
(Especially because, as I think of it, small gas giants will be much more
likely to be ejected from a new solar system than big ones and hence will be
much more common.)

  Well, rotating hull designs are a realistic or semi-realistic option, and under
  those circumstances you will probably either be using a short burst drive (for
  which period the hull gets locked down), or be using an extremely low thrust
  drive (.01 Gs or lower).  Another flaw of rotating hulls is that they act like
  immense gyroscopes, you better not want to turn while using rotational gravity.

It gets worse.  (oh, no, not the deadman\'s tumble again....)

If you build your rotating section wrong, it is unstable.  For an
object with three different moments of inertia, rotation about the
middle axis is unstable.

Example: Take a normal paperback book.  Put a rubber band around it,
to hold it closed.  Hold it with the spine in your left hand, and the
open side in your right.  Toss it in the air, spinning so that the
axis of rotation goes through the spine and the center of the book.
If it rotates more than a couple times, you\'ll probably catch it with
the spine in your _right_ hand, as the instability flips it over.


Now, this might be an interesting trick for a ship which needs to
reorient itself quickly, but I wouldn\'t want to try it (the contents
of the ship will get thrown around pretty badly).

	- Robert Ringrose
	  ringrose@ascent.com

On top of that, I always have headaches thinking about the interface
between the rotating and nonrotating sections, unless the rotating and
nonrotating sections are largely independant.  Try bringing water in
_and_ out of a rotating module.  Now add power.  Air.  All going
through this rotational interface.  That\'s a disaster waiting to
happen.

I recently lost a long time Champions character, Gadget.  He had to act as
a living conduit, holding the ends of a severed power line for the machine
that was going to shut off the dimensional rift that was being used to
invade Earth.  We saved civilization, but Gadget died.  I\'d played this
character off and on for nearly fifteen years, and the GM offered to give
me an out (he vanished in a flash of energy, nobody saw the body, one of
the Prime Movers intervenes and cures me, etc.,) but I decided that it was
a good heroic death.  The funeral is at this week\'s session.  Of course,
now I get to design a new hero.. heheheh..

That\'s why they kicked our butts.  Sheridan only defeated the Blackstar by

General of the Army wore five stars arranged in a pentagon.  Generals were

A Sergeant-Major is a senior NCO in an administrative position.  A Command
Sergeant Major is the senior NCO of a unit from battalion size on up the
Army level.  He is also your personal God.  Do not walk on the CSM\'s grass.
 CSMs run the Army.  They have over twenty years of service, and no
everyone and everything.

There is one Sergeant-Major of the Army (SMA).  He is the senior enlisted
man of the whole shebang, advising the Chief of Staff (the commander of the
US Army) on the needs of the enlisted men.  We recently had quite a scandal
when SMA gene McKinney was accused and court-martialed on sexual,
harassment charges (he was found guilty of one minor charge, and allowed to
retire.)

A Sergeant-Major wears three stripes, three rockers, with a star in the
middle.  A CSM wears the same, but with a wreath around the star.  The CSM
uses two stars.

Futuristic Medicine Now:  Heads Up For Transplants

By John McKenzie
ABCNEWS.com

   Transplanting organs from one body to another has become routine.
The liver, the kidney, the heart. Multiple transplants are more daring,
but they too are becoming more common.

    But what about getting it all? The complete package. Someone
else\'s whole body-attached to your head. 
    "A total body transplant," is how Dr. Robert White of Case
Western Reserve University describes it. "All of the organs, all
of extremities and so forth, brought in the form of a transplant." 
    It sounds like science fiction, but it isn\'t. The idea is to take
the functioning body of someone whose brain is dead and attach it
to the head of someone whose body is dying, someone experiencing
multiple organ failure. 
    "I\'m talking about a procedure that could actually be done with
appropriate practice and the safeguards," says White, "I don\'t want to
say tomorrow, but certainly within the year." 

Monkeys First 
    In fact, doctors have already performed total body transplants on
monkeys. A team of neurosurgeons at Case Western in Cleveland
developed the elaborate procedure.

<snippage of procedure details>

     While total body transplants show just how far surgeons have
come in manipulating the body, they have yet to figure out how to
reconnect the spinal cord. So for now, patients undergoing this
operation would not be able to move their new bodies. But with
spinal chord research developing so rapidly, many scientists
expect that problem can be overcome.

Meteroids Threaten Satellites

By Jane E. Allen
The Associated Press
M A N H A T T A N   B E A C H, Calif., April 27 - In
November, the Earth\'s atmosphere will be hit with
the most severe meteor shower in 33 years, a
bombardment of debris that could damage or
destroy some of the nearly 500 satellites that
provide worldwide communications, navigation and
weather-watching. 
    The debris consists only of particles-some thinner than a
hair and most no larger than a grain of sand-but they are
hurtling through space so fast that they can have the
destructive power of a .22-caliber bullet. 
    As a result, about 200 commercial and military satellite
operators, insurers and scientists began brainstorming here
today about what they can do to prepare, such as turn off
spacecraft or turn them away from the stream of particles.

There are a set of cargo hooks/plots in BITS 101 Cargos (2nd Edition) that

	-added small gas giants
	-removed radar signature for gas giants (gas giants absorb radar)
	-added rules for minerology/"prospecting"

Executive summary: 
Detection ranges in an empty hex for a "typical"
sensor (PEMS-13, AEMS-11) are as follows:

Object                  Passive Range           Active Range 
200-m iceball           50,000 km               500,000 km
Small Gas Giant         100 AU                  ----
        (1 billion years old)
Small Gas Giant         3 AU                    ----   
        (5 billion years old)
Large Gas Giant         3000 AU                 ----
        (1 billion years old)
Large Gas Giant         300 AU                  ----
        (5 billion years old)

Small military sensors (PEMS-13.5) multiply ranges by x3; big military
or science sensors multiply range by x10. These imply that almost all
large gas giants will have been charted by the Imperium but that small
gas giants will often have escaped detection.




In more detail, here are signatures on the FFS2 scale for all these
objects:

Object                  Passive/Vis     Passive/IR      Active
Rocky asteroid          +0.5            +0.0            +0.5 
        (habitable zone)
Rocky asteroid          +1.0            +1.5            +0.5 
        (inner zone)
Rocky asteroid          -0.5            -2.0 *          +0.5 
        (outer zone)
Rocky asteroid          -2.5            -5.5 *          +0.5 
        (Oort cloud or empty hex)

C-type asteroid         +0.0            +0.0            +0.5
        (habitable zone)
C-type asteroid         +0.5            +1.5            +0.5
        (inner zone)
C-type asteroid         -1.0            -2.0 *          +0.5
        (outer zone)
C-type asteroid         -3.0            -5.5 *          +0.5
        (Oort cloud or empty hex)

* indicates that science-grade sensors get an additional +0.5 to 
detect these objects using passive/IR.

Rocky asteroids are greyish (albedo 0.2 - 0.3). 
C-type asteroids are dark asteroids (albedo 0.05) mostly consisting of 
carbon compounds.
Comet nucleii and Kuipter belt objects roll 1d6; on 1 use the rocky
asteroid values, on 2-4 use the C-type values, on 5-6 use c-type with an
additional -1 to visible signature. (Ice exposed to cosmic rays becomes
extremely dark.) 


These values assume a 1-m radius asteroid. For larger or smaller asteroids
use the following modifiers:

Asteroid Size modifiers:
Asteroid Radius         Passive/Vis     Passive/IR      Active
1 m                     -2.0            -2.0            -1.0
10 m                    -1.0            -1.0            -0.5
100 m                    0.0             0.0            +0.0
1 km                    +1.0            +1.0            +0.5    
10 km                   +2.0            +2.0            +1.0
100 km                  +3.0            +3.0            +1.5


For people who want to do prospecting, a detailed mineralogical scan 
requires a second roll at the original detection difficulty, +2 
difficulty levels for a non-science sensor, and 1 full 30-minute turn
in which the sensor looks only at the target.

(In more precise DSR terms, scanning for minerals 
reduces the signature by 2 points and requires a roll on the usual 
detection table, at +2 difficulty levels for a non-science sensor. 
Note that the reduction of 2 points is usually offset by the 
tracking-already-detected target modifier (+1.5) and the scanning-a-single-
arc modifier (+1.0))



Gas giants in empty hexes or Oort clouds use the following chart:

Object                  Passive/Vis     Passive/IR      Active
Small Gas Giant         +2.0            +3.5 *          **
        (0.05 jupiter mass, 1 billion years old, empty hex)
Small Gas Giant         +2.0            +2.0 *          **
        (0.05 jupiter mass, 1 billion years old, empty hex)
Large Gas Giant         +3.0            +5.0 *          **
        (1 jupiter mass, 1 billion years old, empty hex)
Large Gas Giant         +3.0            +4.0 *          **
        (1 jupiter mass, 5 billion years old, empty hex)
Very Large Gas Giant    +3.0            +6.0            **
        (5 jupiter mass, 1 billion years old, empty hex)
Very Large Gas Giant    +3.0            +5.0 *          **
        (5 jupiter mass, 5 billion years old, empty hex)
Brown Dwarf             +3.0            +8.0            **
        (40 jupiter mass, 1 billion years old, empty hex)
Brown Dwarf             +3.0            +7.5            **
        (40 jupiter mass, 5 billion years old, empty hex)

* indicates that science-grade sensors get an additional +0.5 to 
detect these objects using Passive/IR.

** gas giant planets and brown dwarfs have radar signature sufficiently
low that they have not yet been measured from the Earth, and I\'m not sure
how to calculate them; in all practical circumstances the target would be
detected visually or in the infra-red first. Some gas giants may have
moons or rings (active signature +0.5 to +4.0) that will be detectable
instead. (Roll 11+ on 2d6 to have reatined a moon, +1 for large gas
giants and +2 for very large; roll 1d6/2 for the moon\'s active signature.) 

Small gas giant numbers are extrapolations due to the lack of evolutionary
tracks for objects below Saturn\'s mass.



Detection can be calculated using the Definitive Sensor Rules (available
on the web or via email.) In essence, one adds the sensor sensitivity
(from FFS2 or the conversion notes in the DSR) to the target signature
and subtracts the range to calculate the "signal":

Signal = Sensitivity + Signature - Range + modifiers

and then compares to the following chart:
SIGNAL  active detection        passive detection
        task                    task
<0      (target cannot be detected under any circumstances)
0       Impossible              Impossible
0.5     Average                 Staggering (TNE: Formidable)
1.0     (automatic detection)   Average
1.5                             Easy
2.0                             (automatic detection.)

Ranges are taken from the following chart:

Range:                                                          RANGE

3 parsec                                                        19.5

So, for example, a typical scout (Sensitivity=13.0) scanning for a 
rocky asteroid (passive (vis) signature = 0.5) at a range of 1 AU would
have a signal of (13.0) + (0.5) - 13.5 = 0.0, for an 
Impossible task to detect the asteroid.

A labship with a science-grade PEMS-14 looking for old gas giants in an
empty hex would have a signal of 14.0 (sensor) + 0.5 (empty hex science bonus) 
+ 4.5 (signature with science bonus) - 19 (range) = 0.5, a Staggering
task.

Remember the following modifiers to sensor sensitivity (taken from
the most recent version of the DSR) based on sensor location:

Sensor Location         Passive/Vis     Passive/IR      Active
Inner zone              -0.5            -0.5             0.0
Habitable zone           0.0             0.0             0.0
Outer zone              +0.5            +0.0             0.0
Oort cloud/empty hex    +1.0            +0.0 (normal)    0.0
                                        +0.5 (sci-grade)

(The full DSR also includes modifiers for long scans (1 day) and for
scanning only a single arc, which if combined allow a +1.0 for taking
2 weeks to do a scan.)

All VLGGs will have been charted (but are generally hard to refuel from.) 
All Large Gas Giants will be charted inside a well-established civilized

Small Gas Giants will only be charted in well-surveyed areas on a roll of 10+

It\'s three up, FOUR down w/ the appropriate doohickey in the middle (it\'s an
Eagle,Globe and Anchor for the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, a bursting
bomb for Master Gunnery Sgt, and a star for a Sergeant Major). All are E-9,
but I\'ve heard something about a "billet bonus."  I\'m sure that the Commandant
of the Marine Corps gets more than a \'regular\' four star. Commandant of the
Marine Corps is a four star general.  There\'s a badge worn on the left breast
that is the insignia of Commandant.  I\'d suspect the same thing for Chairman
of the JCS, etc.

The most complicated we get is three stripes and a crown for a Staff
Sergeant. After that they have wrist bands that are bothersomely difficult
to see if the wearer is moving or behind a desk, etc.

  I\'ve seen the 2300 AD artwork, and probably copied it from there. IIRC,
a similar arrangement might be used on some small centrifuges; I could
be thinking of something else, though.

No, but in the star trek thing, I\'m sure there is another way to travel
FTL without Warp.  In the various episodes, we have seen other types of
propulsion that are more efficient then warp.  Heck, if I was the
federation, I\'d develope the new FTL tech then shoot off a bunch of
Omega Bombs in BORG space.  :)

Well, maybe.  Except if the ramifications to the background are
complex, then it isn\'t simple.  Besides, I don\'t see any of the
changes that I have opposed as being simpler (or even as simple)
as the original.

> Besides, I\'m not (in this case)

Well, lets be clear, they are, in fact, a later addition.  And
they also are some thing where you either have to arbitrarily limit
their consequences or introduce greater changes than simply removing
them.

>Besides, drop tanks does not
>change the fundamentals of space travel.

Well, I couldn\'t disagree more, but I\'ve already said why.  I will just
note the your arguements that it won\'t change the fundamentals also
runs up against the point you yourself have argued, that you can
never know all the ramifications when you first write something.

Much bigger.

Which there would be great incentive to put along all significant
trades routes (which would tend to group travel into certain
routes which would be a big change, in and of itself).

I have.  The need to carry jump fuel.  I have also said at some length
why I think this is a big change.

Its only splitting hairs if you assume that you view is the right one.  
It has been argued im historical fields that it is a mistake to focus 
on things like political (and often petty) motivations and who is \'in
charge\' when these are often just symptoms of more fundamental changes
(or the lack thereof).  Yet all I\'ve gotten from you on this is attempts
to ridicule my points.  In the end this is peripheral point and I 
see no reason to keep having to deal with this.

Which is exactly the point.  I find the idea that "ships aren\'t smaller,
the just can do what it took bigger ships to do" to be truly splitting
hairs.

They are a late, poorly integrated and poorly thought out additions

Hogwash.  I pointed out the fundamental disagreement that was

I wouldn\'t agree at all.  They were poorly throught out when they
were introduced and the reason nothing depends on them is that
thy have gotten no development in the background afte the initial
introduction.  They have been mostly ignored and I suggest we
keep that up until they are forgotten.

Well, from my point of view you have failed to show how they can
do anything but cause conflicts.  However, perhaps the best way
to discuss things is not simply dismiss points of view we don\'t
agree with.

Well, I was mostly pointing out that this is one possible intrepretation

Well, fine except for the issue of drop tanks and being able to jump
from
external fuel which I feel represents a major change to the background.
One would also have either figure the field needs to go up all at once
or wonder why people don\'t by smaller reactors and just take a few
hours to jump (since you are going to be at it a week anyway).

Hardly.  As I pointed out in text you deleted, it is not unusual for
technologies to be fundamentally limited (especially ones that involve
some trick like a high throughput device might).  I may be that the
Imperium
is going to better high throughput reactors by the most reasonable
route available, improving ordinary reactors until the day comes that
they can take over from them.

Classic Book 1/2/3 rank would be 6; Book 4/MT/TNE/T4 rank would be O11 for

Dear Steven,

Please could you point me in the direction of Harold and Leroy and the TL
of the RoM debate. I, and fellow members of the Historic TML flamewar
re-enactment society wish to join in this most classic of exchanges.
Following the casting of our runes, and using the magical psionic items
discovered when we played \'the Annililik Run\', we believe that we have
important new information that will decisively solve the debate one way or
the other.

Yours faithfully,

Hmm. Maybe you could get the French to build it and call it the \'Suffren\'. :-)

Actually, one of the things about B5 that irritates me is the way that the

and goes out of balance catastrophically. If you watch the CGI none of them
do that...

Thats an interesting work around.  Although, wouldn\'t it be easier to use
the weapon as a modifier to a default skill roll for Intimidation?
Otherwise, it looks like a weapon could modify other Social Standing derived
skills; it just looks wrong.  Also, what about the guy who doesn\'t carry a
gun but has his henchmen point theirs?  Taken together, I would use
Intimidation as a default skill modified by total number of henchmen (or
difference in number between two groups) + total modifiers for weapons (or
difference in those totals for each group, if the guns aren\'t out yet).

I\'m not sure what you\'re talking about, to be honest, but there\'s a new book out

Would your really need hypersonic streamlining for a 1-G freighter? 
IMHO, it would be a better bet to save money, volume and surface 
area and go for transonic instead? Otherwise, I think it looks fine.

Actually Life Support also includes all the storage/dumping/recycling of
wastes, food, drink, heating, cooling, removing CO2 and other undesirable
gases from the atmosphere, keeping the ship from smelling like an old
sneaker, etc etc. Oxygen is actually a _small_ part of the total.

You are in a _completely_ closed system, particularly during those weeks
you spend in Jumpspace...think submarine without being able to vent out to
the sea.

Well Steve, I have proof that the RoM was definately at or above TL25 at the
time of the Night Fall. The only reason that the RoM fell at all was that
the Terra Suoerbrains were flat out bored with playing with the "lesser
beings".

What? What proof you say... Well, I really can\'t tell you it\'s from
something (insert name-drop-of-your choice) told me in confidence. However,
you can take my word for it.... Really!

My opinion is that the open Air raft could indeed make it to orbit, if the
driver had a vacc suit and didn\'t care much about the obvious dangers.

A relevant analogy: The WWII ampibious vehicle know as the Seep (sea  jeep)
was perfectly capable of crossing the Atlantic. Two GIs drove one across as a
publicity stunt after the war was over. With perfect conditions and real ship
to follow along behind with spare gasoline cans, it was doable. It is not a
good thing to try at home...

I don\'t know if anyone ever tried the same trick with the seaborne 2.5-ton
truck (the DUKW), but that sucker could have carried enough fuel in barrels in
the back to make it across without help -- and it would still have been a bad
idea.

	Interesting alleged historical oddity. Pershing was jacked up in rank, because
	the American Expeditionary Force was under the operational umbrella
	of the French Army and Marshal Foch as Front Commander. Given
	certain French practices, like using field artillery on your own troops to "encourage"
	them and decimation punishment, Pershing was given rank comparable to
	a Marshal, so he could better "decline" an order from Foch,
	if he thought the order was not in the interest of the U.S. or its army.

	Added to the fact that Pershing and Foch "DISLIKED" each other from
	first contact, and it was probably a good thing for keeping the Amercan troops
	from becoming expendable cannon fodder for the french.

	So in Traveller canon, does the Vegan Automonous Region have to jack up
	its Admirals\' ranks when manuevering with all those Imperial Grand Admirals in
	the Rebellion?

  Yes, but only a surprise attack at close range will matter given Traveller
ship combat time and distance scales. It beats decalcification.

  It\'s actually $15 US for an annual subscription to SJG\'s
Pyramid (on-Line) magazine, covering a wide variety of RPG
and game industry subjects. Subscription includes access to
all available playtester files (i.e., G: Discworld as well
as G:T), and access to the Pyramid archives, which appears to
cover issues #1 on.

  It seems a far better value than Starships was.

  It also allows observers to make informed decisions as to 
their views about potential problems while the game is still
in development, rather than being told to buy the reprint, or
to wait until they get all the "features" out of the product.

  It\'s a shame that a revived JTAS couldn\'t be published on-
line like that. I don\'t know how that would modify the numbers
re: advertising revenue versus publishing costs, but I\'d happily
pay for such a service. And yes, I\'d pay another $15 US/year, to
FFE, SJG, or any other reputable company. (OK, not IG and some
others...)

You\'re right, except that in FF&S2 hypersonic streamlining is required
for gas giant refueling...which I wanted this ship to be capable of.

If I didn\'t want frontier refueling (for use in established systems) I\'d
cut the streamlining down to subsonic, lose the scoops, and remove the
purification plant...it would free up maybe 15 or more displacement
tons.

If you have a couple coaxial counter rotating gyros at the centerline of
the ship, the rotational acceleration balances out and you can "push"
off one gyro to rotate the other, thus your ship doesn\'t roll (or it
does roll by accelerating one gyro more than the other).  Now if you
shift these gyros perpendicular to their axes, the rotational
accelerations (Flemming\'s left hand law ?) appear to go opposite
directions at opposite sides of the center of gravity for the ship.
Would this be enough to yaw your ship around?  It seems like an
excellent method of maneuvering your ship without orientation rockets. I
suspect however that there needs to be an actual acceleration to for the
gyros to act on.  If that\'s the case, you can use your main thrusters
and gyros to orient your ship in any direction.

keep the plant, you need it for C- starports (which don\'t offer refined

Because fluorine is a gas, a standard airlock will not fully flush the gas

This is the old "slow scooping" vs "fast scooping" argument.  If the ship
has a grav drive that allows it to float in the Gas Giant\'s upper
atmosphere, then it should be able to refuel with a subsonic
streamlining..albit more slowly. That\'s the way I build merchant ships,
IMTU. Hypersonic streamlining is something military ships and shuttles
often need, but not chuggers like a Free Trader.

Of course they where introduced later. They were a new invention that came
along in the late Imperium. Are you saying that you want a static
non-changing universe to play in, where all things are defined and there
is nothing to suprise you?

The ramifications never had a chance to play themself out, as the Imperium
collapsed before drop tanks had a chance to change anything. When new
technologies come along it will of course change the fundamentals of
certain areas. just think about when the jump engine was discovered. That
really changed the fundamentals of space travel, but no one is bitching
about that. I wonder why?

But that would also make space travel much more vounerable. Drop tanks are
only usable in the large, well defined systems. Fuel has to plentiful,
tools, mechanics, engineers, stable economies has to present. I don\'t want
to jump to a system to find out that the only mechanic my firm had in
employment has died, and that because of a small malfunction I have to
wait a couple of weeks before the drop tanks can be transported out to my
ship.

It is a change, minor or major, nig deal. The fact is that it was
introduced as a new technology to make interstellar travel easier. Of
course that is going to impact on how space travel happens, just like the
jump drive change thing when it was introduced.

Well I might be hopping into an argument, but this I disagree with. They
were introduced as a new technology and I beleave that had the Imperium
not collapsed, it would surely have changed, and to me that is an
important part of the game. Introduction of new ideas, play it along and
see where it leads.

  This should be self-evident. No streamlining, cargo handling is
zero-G (by station professionals), 1G drives (or less!) are perfectly
adequate, and regularly scheduled vessels get 8-day turnarounds easily.
Any airline (trucking, shipping, etc.) scheduling person can tell you
how much getting 45 trips a year matters compared to 25 or so.

  And an obvious business case can be made to show how such a station
would _not_ eat up much of the differential.

  An asteroid trans-shipping point at 100d isn\'t a new technology of
course, simply an obvious application of pre-existing hardware and
methodologies. After all, even at 100 d it is still an orbiting 
high port.

  Seeings as there\'ve been no more requests for RoM TL retrospectives,
can I take that as an invitation to re-clarify the various patrolling
and security issues as they relate to the piracy thread?

  I don\'t feel a need to play with the background, but I\'m fairly
certain that I\'m capable of running the numbers on canon or reasonable
economics, picking out discrepancies, and interpreting the results.

  No, but you can certainly explore the ramifications to a large
extent, and I think it\'s fair to say that to the extent that the
various Traveller-related lists (and I\'d never even heard of the
obviously somewhat secretive Historic TML Flamewar Re-Enactment
Society) have a lot of people with various experiences, knowledge,
and skill sets (and spare time to kill, obviously), that most of
these things can be refined about as well as GDW or DGP did in
their efforts to meet dead-lines and bank payments.

  Having occasional drop-ins by Great Old Ones doesn\'t hurt, either.

The book I\'d go for is Andrews\' "Elizabethan Privateering". Apart from
anything else, it has a nice long list of ships, captains, home ports and
captured cargoes (including by value). It also has some good stuff on the
economics of piracy.

Cross reference with Postumus\' History of Prices in Holland for even more
accurate numbers on costs etc.

My short answer is that a zero was accidentally added to the costs of
running a Type III life support system (ie a normal ship life support
system), so you should cut the cost down to Cr250 per person per fortnight
for recycling the oxygen, changing the air filters, restocking the wet bars
etc.

This change means you need to cut passenger charges by Cr 1750 or so to
keep balanced.

Other theories include the Cr2000 is mostly compulsory insurance, or that
it includes the cost of routine maintainence above and beyond the normal
annual maintainence.

None of those other means (other than the Bajoran Wormhole) have proven
stable or reliable; the Soliton wave is uncontrollable, subspace
transporters are dangerous (and the Omega effect likely ruins them also),
Transwarp conduits are Borg technology, and quite possibly rely on
subspace, Transwarp doesn\'t work, etc.

Basically, barring supertech/superpsi (ie, Borg, Traveler, Q, Cth...err
Yaskoydray), if you want to travel FTL, you use Warp drive in Trek, just
as you use a Jump drive in Traveller. 

There\'s also the fact that most of these technologies are;

a; new developments (i.e., within the timeframe of the last decade or
so... since TNG started showing) and thus postdate the Omega Directives

and

b; not available to Voyager when it\'s stuck forty zillion light years from
the Federation.

Well, I just found myself a bit miffed, because the lead-up to it was
very exciting..

Like that time they had the chase all over the galaxy for that message
in the DNA that turned out to be a glorified "Hi, howya doing"?  That
left a bad taste in my mouth.  Treknology is just too \'pat\' at times. 
Like with what you mentioned, the Transporter Miracle of the

thing with Wesley "The Boy" Crusher..Suddenly he\'s homo-superior when he

They *did* do that. Not only did it blow things up, it did *something*
to "subspace" that made warp drives unusable in the area of effect.

So the threat was eliminating *all* ftl travel and communication over
most of the galaxy. That\'s quite a threat to a star faring civilization.

How do you think the major races in Traveller would react to something
that could make jump drive unusable over whole subsectors, much less
sectors or quadrants? It\'d be *too* powerful to use even as a doomsday
weapon.

A 1g ship trying to scoop Jupiter had *better* be moving *well* above
hypersonic. Or it\'ll never get out again. 

"Slow" scooping has a lot of problems. Mostly because you have to go so
deep in the atmosphere that you become subject to "weather" which, on a
gas giant, is *not* fun.

The main things you need to worry about are "meteor showers" like this,
and solar flares. Flares require observation of the star to detect, but
luckily the particles that do the damage are moving somewhat slower
than light, so that you\'ll have minutes to hours of warning. 

Flares tend to depend on sunspot cycles, which require that you have
observed the star for decades to get the cycles figured out.

Meteor showers tend to occur when crossing the orbit of old comets. The
density depends on what part of the orbit you cross (relative to the
position of the comet). 

These too require decades or even *centuries* of observations to be
able to predict. 

So a "newly settled" system is apt to learn about major flares, or
major meteor showers the hard way. Settled systems will know in advance
when such things are likely.

Also, younger systems will tend to have more "junk" floating around.

And could one of the astronomers tell us about what it\'d be like being
near things like T-Tauri stars (which as I recall have *monster*
stellar winds).

I almost hope that there\'s some damage. Enough to make them consider
the idea of permanent manned installations in geosynch orbit. Then you
can "armor" the place a bit, and be able to maintain the
transmitters/cameras far more easily.

Supposedly, they are all "related" to warp. Sort of like warp is "Jump
1". and the others are higher numbers. Clobbering subspace (the way the
Omega stuff was supposed to) would therefore affect *all* of them.

This is the point I refer to the most. Much SF critics sometimes overlook
this too - everything not expainable in SF is needed to get it consistent
with today known physics - as \'good\' SF never contradicts it. Even
\'better\' SF does not rely upon pseudotech, it relies upon the persons,
which are living in this world. Tech always should give the background.

So, if we could explain how jump drives work, why aren\'t we still able to
build them? In fact, \'jump space\' is the explanation to "why can we travel
faster than light?", not more.

I know from my own campaign, in which mostly scientists play, that the
ones with no knowledge about physics get along best with the universe as
it is. The disturbances mostly come from a scientist asking "how does this
work", or even more "why doesn\'t this work?" when they thought they found
a way to trick. I could explain this to them, being myself a scientist,
but I really don\'t want to. That\'s a problem, but I don\'t think it\'s mine.

At least I want to say, that there still is a difference between game
mechanics and technology, as space travel is needed for a SF game, but no
one knows how it really would work. If the players want to know about it,
they may ask. Better they don\'t. If they only ask to find a way to trick,
say their characters do not know, so there\'s no need to explain.

(A point still missed in the discussion: If most of today\'s car drivers
don\'t know how the car works, why should everyone in the future know about
ship drives? We are NOT in the Star Trek Universe in which this seems to
be true ...)

I for myself like the idea of travelling through ether in the Space: 1889
scenario, although this is proven unreal. But it makes for fun.
And what\'s the most important bit of playing?

There are two books from Albert available - I\'ve got them. But my players

Inertia is a property of the mass - gravity being the other.
Asimov wrote a little SF crime story, I think you know: The Billard Ball.
This shows, what could happen if a body loses its mass: it accelarates to
light velocity.

Missing inertia would make problems with the pulse, as p = m * v gets zero
with missing m. You could throw any body way too far no matter how big it
is. But, on the other hand, each gas molecule hitting your ship in space
would throw it away. The crew on board would not gat injured, as they
don\'t have inertia, too, but navigating could get a little worse ...

Only a few ideas,

For startes, with an "insidious" atmosphere, the oceans are unlikely to
be water. They may *contain water, but it\'d have a *lot* of something
else in it. Consider nice things like acids, or other really weird
chemical crud.

One "nice" thing about Fluorine is that a couple of relatively "common"
and "cheap" metals react with it the way aluminum does with oxygen.
That is, they form a fluride layer on the surface and said layer is
reasonably strong and protects the underlying metal. The metals in
question are copper and nickel. 

So instead of trying to figure out how to coat everything with teflon,
in a lot of cases you can just copper or nickel plate exposed metal,
and then ignore it.

Oxygen isn\'t much of a problem, as they noticed. Atmospheric life
support requires the following, pretty much in order of importance.

1. Oxygen at a percentage of the atmosphere that amounts to 3 psi.
2. "Inert" components that bring pressure up to around 15 psi total
   (+/- 5 psi?)
3. removal of carbon dioxide. People produce CO2 from reacting food
   with oxygen: CxH2xOx + x O2 -> x CO2 + x H2O.
4. maintenance of humidity at reasonable level (too dry, you get
   various sorts of respiratory troubles, too much it gets muggy and
   water condenses all over the place. AS noted in 3, people *produce*
   water. 
5. Keeping the air (and the rest of the ship) at a reasonable
   temperature. In space, due to the vacuum surrounding the ship,
   getting *rid* of heat is a major problem.
6. removal of the zillions of "trace" molecules that people and their
   belongings produce. For example, formaldehyde. These "trace" amounts
   can build up to *lethal* levels, and many are dangerous long before
   they are strong enough to smell.

CO2 removal can be done various ways. Anything from chemicals that
react with it to using various tricks to "seperate" it from the rest of
the air and then using heat or electricity to "crack" it into carbon
and oxygen.

Water removal is probably done as part of the cooling process for the
air. Water condensed from the air can be fed into the drinking water
supply, or if necessary, broken down into hydrogen and oxygen.

Trace elements can be handled by filters (the space shuttle uses
activated charcoal) or they can be "cracked" or "burned" by various
thermal or electrical means.

There\'s also the matter of dealing with water and waste water/sewage on
board ship. That\'s life support too. A simple holding tank just won\'t
cut it for a typical ship. The amount of sewage and "dirty" water that
showers, washing dishes/clothes, etc will produce in a week is pretty
amazing. 

At the very least, the water has to be seperated and purified. The
remaining solids then take up a small enough volume to be stored
easily. The purified water can be reused.

While I doubt that such problems will exist by the time life support
has been around that long, it\'s possible to set things up a bit
differently for the squeamish. You have *two* water systems. Drinking
water doesn\'t get recycled, except for water condensed from the air
being added. Used "wash" water gets used for flushing toilets, and is
where purified water from "sewage" winds up.

And of course, food is part of the life support costs.

a better way to handle this is stating that vacuum consists of lots of
electrons with negative energy, which can be elevated to positive energies
- - to go round the effect of creating mass out of nothing.
This is one of the descriptions used for the pair formation of electrons
and positrons from seemingly nothing but gamma rays.

I remember I discussed that item with a commilitone, and used the word
\'Heisenberg Compensator\' even before the episode had been shown. Now think
of what I felt when I saw this one.

The Star Trek tech always seems some \'transcendental\' to me, as even the
thoughts sometimes have effects on the universe ... but, as they have to
make a story, they sometimes have to use some kind of danger. That\'s the
same problem with the alien races - in classic the enemies were the
klingons and romulans, in tng they tried out the Ferengi - too silly, than
the Borg - too powerful, than the dominion - too well known by now, the
Kazon - ok, that was it, the new species in delta quadrant ....

Sometimes it gets bothersome, yes. But I liked the shows, until a german
TV station decided to put them out on a daily scheme - even the new
episodes.

??? Oh, you mean that they were not in the original 3 black books? Well,
I can see that argument. I don\'t agree with it, I think that Book 5 and
the first year\'s JTASes are pretty close to original, but I can see it.
Of course, to be consistent you\'d then have to be a warm advocate of
jump torpedoes, because they were mentioned in the first edition of the
original 3 black books and were subsequently dropped (causing a lot of
underserved abuse to be heaped on the heads of the authors of _Leviathan_
over the years.

Greater changes to future products, yes. But to compensate you wouldn\'t
have to invalidate all the products published in the last 20 years where
they are mentioned, nor the I-don\'t-know-how-many regular and TCS campaigns
that people have run in the last 20 years where they have been used.

You\'ve repeatedly made a vague, unsupported claim that the fact that some
ships, in some limited cases, will be able to carry more cargo for the
same (well, slightly increased) cost is a fundamental change in the way
space travel works. But you\'ve failed to come up with a single concrete
example of a significant change that would cause. Not one single solitary
example, just a vague generalization. If those dreadful ramifications are
so nebulous that you can\'t even come up with a few examples, they aren\'t
worth losing sleep over.

Actually, I\'ve conceeded that you can never be sure that some unforseen
ramification won\'t raise it\'s ugly head and bite you on the ass, in the
same way that you can never _prove_ a negative. But I can consider the
possible ramifications for a while, and if neither I, nor the opponents
of the idea are able to come up with anything more concrete than a vague
apprehension that "You can never be sure!", then I can consider the idea
innocent until proven guilty.

Economic analysis shows that under the present Traveller rules running
regularily scheduled ships back and forth between two systems reduce
the cost of freight and passenger traffic significantly, provided the
systems can provide enough traffic to keep the ships filled all the time.
Thus travel already tend to move along certain routes. What is more, this
is just the way things seem to work in the (admittedly scanty) background
information we have about traffic in the Traveller Universe. So it accords
with both rules and background material. Drop tanks will simply increase
this tendency. And they will do it in _future_ publications, not
retroactively, the way dropping them will.

Try reading what I\'m asking. I\'m challinging you to provide concrete
examples, something you seem remarkably reluctant to do.

No, you\'ve repeated the same assertation several times. Drop tanks will
change the need to carry jump fuel. No argument there. You _think_ that
this is a big deal. No argument there, either. But your opinions don\'t
carry much weight unless you can back them with something a little
more concrete. Evidence, please. Examples, logical arguments, etc. Not
just repeating the same basic axiom ad nauseam.

You\'re saying that if the conduct of a campaign changes because the
motivations of the vast majority of the NPCs shift (in casu, from
peacetime to wartime mentality) then it\'s no big deal, but if a
slice of the society (a slice which many PCs has very little to do
with) changes because of a technological innovation, then its a major
deal.

BTW. so far you\'ve done preciously little to convince anyone that your
view has any validity. You\'ve stated an axiom, dismissed counter-arguments
out of hand by repeating that axiom and refused to provide any support of
your own for it.

>It has been argued im historical fields that it is a mistake to focus 
>on things like political (and often petty) motivations and who is \'in

And if I were trying to write a historical text that argument might even
have had something to do with the case in hand. But since I\'m arguing
about the features of a shared world universe, it hasen\'t.

>Yet all I\'ve gotten from you on this is attempts to ridicule my points.

I\'m not trying to ridicule your points. Arguing a case by repeating your
axioms is ridiculous in the first place. Try addressing my points or at
least provide some of your own instead of repeating your basic premise and
youmight get something more.

Touche. Yes, I hadn\'t looked at it that way. Of course, that only applies
to transport ships, but then, transport ships are the only one that are
significantly affected by drop tanks. OK, you\'re right, drop tanks will
effectively allow smaller ships for the same job. Now give me a few
examples of Traveller publications that will be invalidated by this fact.

They are an addition to the original three books, yes, but to the
existing background? They appear in JTAS#1. I don\'t recall if _Kinunir_
came out before or after that, but cartainly drop tanks have been part
the background (as opposed to the rules) almost from the start.

BTW. are you advocating dropping fast drug or slow berths? Both are part
of the original rules and they are also poorly intergrated (fast drugs
makes for a cheaper and safer way to travel than slow berths).

I deleted it because I had already conceded that I\'d accept it if the
other problems could be explained away. I still wouldn\'t consider them
very plausible, but since they are concievable, I didn\'t see any
reason to continue discussing them.

That was the point I was trying to make. I\'ve long been of the opinion that
a multi-sector interstellar state needs more ranks than a single country
on a balkanized planet and that the historical instances of ranks higher
than four-star generals was an argument in my favor. Unfortunately Douglas
rather thorughly spiked my guns with the examples and clarifications he
provided (But IMTU the Imperial Grand Admirals are still O14).

Also working: a pingpong racket, marked on on side and thrown up to rotate

Because any old air/raft will have fuel tanks explode, suffer severe
material degradation and have their occupants suffocating/dying of bends
etc when they are subjected to vacuum. Building something that is supposed
to stand vacuum cost a bundle.

I think the blanket statement in various CT stuff that all air/rafts are
capable of reaching orbit without trouble is an oversimplification.

In my design system vehicle designs cost about 1000 Cr extra per m2 surface
area if vacuum proofed.

Wellcome to the list, James! (You are relatively new, aren\'t you? ;-) 
This is one of the fairly frequently raised issues (Last time a couple of
months ago; you may want to browse through the archives and see what you
can find). Basically, some of us believe the Traveller economic system is
broken and that this figure is one manifestation of that. IMO Cr2000 is
far too much compared to the cost of food, oxygen, etc. (Others disagree).
I also think that passengers (who only spen 8-9 days aboard the ship per
jump should only cost 2/3rds of what a crewmember costs. My own figures
(Non-canon warning!) comes to Cr300 for Economy passengers (I have a two-
to-a-stateroom passenger class), Cr400 for crew and Mid passengers and
Cr500 for High passengers. This is for a 10 day period. Crew accounts for
three \'units\' per month, passengers for one unit per jump.

Bruce Johnson replies:
>Actually Life Support also includes all the storage/dumping/recycling of
>wastes,

Propably not. Life support cost are directly proportional to the number
of passengers. I doubt that waste disposal for 20 is twice as expensive
as waste disposal for 10. But I could be wrong.

>food, drink,

Definitely. That acconts for several 100 credits...

No. That\'s part of the ship\'s functions.

Yes. Another few 10s of credits.

The problem is that everything combined seems to be such a small part of
the total ;-)

Not only metals, but also glasses are affected by fluorine. I remember in
a starter lesson of chemistry the lecturer showed a flask half filled with
fluorine acid only to wait until the liquid found its way out - part of
the flask was away. The protecting layer only exists on certain materials.

If you search for something that\'s able to solve anything but a problem -
fluorine is quite near to it.

Be careful with different metals put on each other. In much cases the not
so noble metal rusts away even faster than without the other.

Oh-oh. It looks like I\'ve got some ships that need redesigning! :)

If you don\'t mind me asking, what are some of the other FF&S 
minimum/maximum parameters for starship designs? If IG wasn\'t already 
dead and buried (and my local game vendors weren\'t so "inventory 
challenged"), I\'d just go ahead and buy the book. I love the FF&S 
spreadsheet that Andy designed (especially the latest version with 
the "light text" load/save), but w/o this kind of info it\'s useless 
to anyone that doesn\'t have the book.

Actually, they were foiled by an unanticipated side effect of their latest
scheme. The last transmission heard from Terra at this time was enigmatic,
indicative of their ongoing drive to rule:

My version of the Empress Wave (that I call the black curtain) is that
something Yaskoydroy + children did to hyperspae 300 000 years ago upset
something. Sublight detection drones (built by Baddies from the core) was
sent off towards galactic core and then the baddies went out to stip the
disturbance. the roundtrip took about 300 000 so here they are. They go
about their business by disabling jump on a hex by hex basis along the
wave. Then they sanitize any planet that might harbour jump using life with
antimatter deep burrower bombs.
Why do they do this? They were built millions of years ago as caretakers
for the hyperspace construction that extends from galactic core and out to
the rim. This is the reason why the galaxy isn\'t teeming with
civilizations; only those in this narrow band can go FTL (a side effect of
jumpspace, its real use is unknown. IMTU.

Well, what if you detonated them in a screen formation?  This would prevent
those pesky border  crossings, except through patrolled chokepoints.  FTL
Comms would have to pass through these chokepoints as well, which makes them
great as listening posts.  You cut off a sector and you control it.

1) SJG has always been good about letting people see what the future 
releases will be like, practically every GURPS book gets this sort of 
treatment. 

2) It\'s not JUST to be a playtester. It also gives access to web 
based discussion areas (Pyramid News), weekly updates on Pyramid 
Online (The web-based gaming magazine that replaces Pyramid after  
issue 30), Online chat with designers. Consider. A subscription to 
the Paper Pyramid alone would have cost you more. Pyramid Online will 
have GURPS Traveller articles from the word go.  The playtest files 
for all supplements will be available as they are completed. I\'m sure 
we\'ll see online chates with Loren on GURPS Traveller, and I wouldn\'t 
be surprised if Marc Miller didn\'t show up for one or two.

In short, it\'s worth it.

Hm, Well the \'"meta-stable" magnetic field\' (MSMF) is such a massive
handwave...

I would say that the field must resist some pretty huge forces already in
battlefield use and an EM pulse from a laser wouldnot provide enough excess
energy in the required form to disrupt the plasma bolt.  Hydrogen Plasma
will basically fly apart unless somehow contained, in fact it must be
contained in order to form (at least small quatities in atmosphere do).
Once formed there is nothing holding the plasma together except this "meta
stable" magnetic field (MSMF).

All I can imagine is thatt there must be a magnetic field technology which
allows the field to be \'projected\' from the PG\'s muzzle outwards along the
path to the target.  This has scary implications.

Older rules seemed to assume inertia would hold the plasma together for the
travel time to the target and this is the interpretation that I favor...the
projectable magnetic field or MSMF just has too many implications (see
discussion titled "To Tech or not to Tech").

>Doesn\'t a powerful laser pulse generate an EM field in an atmosphere,
>if so would a PD laser,such as those in Emperor\'s Arsenal, be adequate?

A laser emits light, which is a form of electromagnetic (EM) radiation.
Any one kind of EM radiation may or may not react to any other form,
generally not.

>could this field rupture the magnetic bottle causing the bolt to
>dissipate prematurely?

I don\'t think so, but perhaps a custom made weapon of similar design to the
PG but without the plasma bolt could disrupt the MSMF.  Certainly an
ElectroMagnetic Pulse (EMP) probably would, but who wants to try since the
only way I know to create such a pulse is a nearby Nuclear Detonation.

Of copurse, at TL15 who\'s to say an EMP \'Gun\' couldn\'t exist?

>How about a hail of superdense gauss slugs?

The plasma involved is at a guess not particularly dense.  Slugs would
probably go right through it without seriously affecting the damage
potential.

But does that require hypersonic *streamlining?*  I have FFS2, but confess
I\'ve never used it (nor thoroughly read through it).  Fuel skimming doesn\'t
have to go very low does it?  To require the streamlining on the hull?
Couldn\'t an original FFS "streamlined" Contra Grav ship moving at G velocities
not have to worry bout it?

Reminds me of some skimming rules i use.(and revised upon getting Supplement
5).

Roll for # of atmospheric buffeting incidents.  Requires one task roll for the
"basic" skimming operation and one for each buffeting incident.  Buffeting
incidents are  one diff mod higher (average becomes difficult, difficult
becomes formidable, etc etc)

AF w/ CG is an easy task of Pilot:Interface/Grav
AF w/o CG and SL w/ CG is an Average task
SL w/o CG and USL w/ CG is a Difficult task (no ocean refueling).  
USL w/o CG is Formidable [hasn\'t come up yet, and haven\'t considered the full
ramifications... I\'m thinking "success" means basic failure, failure means
Catastrophic failure and Catastrophic failure means ship destroyed.]

Brilliant Lances (for size S craft).  
Basic Failure: a) Grappled craft can be torn free (10+ on 2D6);  b)Ship takes
1D6 major hits to the fuel tanks. (lose D20 m3 of fuel each);
c) Takes 1 minor hit to the manuever drive.

Catastrophic Failure: a) Grapple craft torn free on 6+ ; b) Ship takes 3D6
major hits to the fuel tanks (lose D20 m3 of fuel each); c) takes 2 minor hits
to the manuever drive.

Obviously I\'ve adapted the buffetting and detailed effects from Supplement 5.
Before I just used the variable difficulties w/ the standard TNE skimming
rules.  Any thoughts?  Was anything like this done that I haven\'t seen?

Inhabited systems would probably have observatories and sensors aimed that way
then, no?  Wouldn\'t that be part of a scout survey too?  There\'s no way other
than a decade long observation to figure out the cycles?  For example, scout
ship enters the system and begins a survey.  AEMS or PEMS won\'t be able to
tell at all if a flare is imminent?  What about a spot study of the star
(looks at the sunspots).

Couldn\'t they be detected by "seeing" them coming in?  On sensors, too?  I\'m
sure most hi-pop systems will have a pretty mean sensors array as well as a
small network of probes and bases, no?

So wouldn\'t "newly settled" systems have a heavier scout and probe presence,
especially for the meteors?

What would stellar winds do to a ship?  "Blow" it off course? Cause damage?

  We know that warships won\'t be significantly affected directly by the
adoption of drop tanks elsewhere in the economy, except insomuch as the
commerce raiding of a d-tank dependent economy becomes more attractive.

  Scouts wouldn\'t be scouts if they were travelling along only the most
heavily used trade routes.

  And Subsidized cargo/liner vessels wouldn\'t be needed to maintain
communications between worlds with enough traffic to justify a profitable
d-tank servicing capability (or tanker station/jump point).

This is certainly true - it\'d be more fair to say that flares occur when
there are lots of sunspots, so by counting current sunspots on the star you
can have a reasonable idea what the flare probabilities are - especially
since the Imperium has a huge database of millenia of observations of 
hundreds or thousands of stars. Even now we can make predictions about the 
short-term likelihood of major flares and issue "flare alerts" based on
detailed solar observations (I believe there\'s one in effect right now.)

Again, you\'re right - you can just "see" the stream by imaging with good
sensors (ideally from above the plane of the stellar system in question)
looking for a dust excess and/or for the few larger objects  present in the
stream. 
Time-consuming, but it won\'t take centuries.

Stellar winds are just diffuse gas - no effect on a ship, except for reducing
sensor range by a point or two.

T-Tauri systems and other young stars most likely have a protoplanetary/
accretion disk orbiting around them, though, which is somewhat nastier;
it\'d have a fairly high dust concentration - to the point where you might
take significant dust hits on exposed surface fixtures (sensors and deployed
weapons) every hour or two when travelling at any significant velocity. 
There would also be a fair amount of planetersimals/meteoroids/asteroids/
protocomets - junk on its way to planethood in increasing sizes; collisions
would be rare but not impossible, although sensors should generally be able
to see junk coming in time to avoid it (unless all your sensors have been
scoured off by the dust...) 

Some young stars will also experience very massive flares when the 
accretion disk suddenly dumps a load of material onto the star - massive 
enough and bright enough in X-rays that they could represent a hazard to
unarmoured ships, unprotected crew, and non-fib computers.

MAJOR ENERGETIC EVENT SUMMARY:

              ( All times are valid for the UT day of 29 Apr )

Flare Size: Class M6.89/3B at 16:37 UTC
  Location: S17E21 (Region 8210)
  Tenflare: 100 sfu at 17:10 UTC. Duration: 7 minutes
    Sweeps: Unknown (too early)
 SEC Start: 1606 UTC, SEC Max: 16:37 UTC, SEC End: 16:39 UTC

STD-Derived Flare Statistics:

NOTES:
     The derived flare end-times above are not based on the half-power point
     system. For major M and X-class events, the ending time is determined
     when x-rays first drop below M-class levels.  Integrated flux values
     shown are computed from the indicated beginning time to the listed
     ending time. SWF (Short Wave Fadeout) durations are based on the time
     x-rays spend above M-class levels and do not account for potential
     lingering ionospheric effects.

SYNOPSIS:

     A major class M6.89 flare (large optical flare estimated as a 3B) was
observed at 16:37 UTC.  The optical counterpart is still in-progress.  This
ribbon flare spanned the predominantly north-south inversion line along the
west side of the main spot.  Fairly extensive post-flare loops were visible
in off-band H-alpha imagery.  A strong short wave fadeout was observed in
conjunction with this event, affecting frequencies in up to about 15 MHz and
lasting approximately 1 hour on frequencies near 10 MHz.  Residual post-flare
fading is in-progress.

     This event was associated with a large halo coronal mass ejection.  More
details will become available over the next few hours.

Of course not.  Nothing in what I posted said I did.  What I don\'t want

That is hard to accept.  The implications are straightforward and
if the factions had time to research new AI Viruses they could have
explored such a fundamental advantage.  In fact, the implications of
drop tanks would have been obvious in the decade or two that passed
between when they introduced and and the rebellion and they would have
been of much greater interest than they were presented as having.

Well all systems are "well defined" and they will also be available in
systems
along routes between large systems.  As to their vulnerablility, the
fact
that military strategy is affected by shipping that is less scattered
but goes along well defined routes is going give even more ramifacations
(and even more changes to the background) for both offense and defense.

Hogwash.  You are presenting the straw man that the only alternatives
are a large system or an instalation with one person and no ability
to repair anything that breaks down.

Hurrah! This is SF, not the effect itself, but the implications, emotions,
and life stories of those affected.

The success of that episode with Picard living another\'s life was set
firmly on the shoulders of his excellent acting ability.  If anyone caught
his "Captain Ahab" in the recent remake of Moby Dick you would know what I
mean.  Or perhaps you may have seen him and several other TNG stars in
"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour" where both he and Brent Spiner Shone (this
was several years ago).

I find myself attempting to create situations for the characters in my
little troupe (of Players) to react to.  I want the characters (and
players) to be moved, shaken and suprised.  I want them to *behave* like
people in the situation as given.  I want to be a narrator for a story
which they play out; tragedy or comedy.

I also find myself getting tired of the "problem to solve" scenarios.  I
think some no win situations might be needed or desired to break up the
idea that every challenge can be overcome.

Random thoughts spew after a day of dissecting a massive spreadsheet cell
by cell so it can be \'fixed\'.

Well, I don\'t recall any of your analyses, but my view is that
in general they can serve to point up questions, but unless
the issue simple, they are always based on enough assumptions
that they server to quantitate one point of view rather than
prove it.

It can be explored to _some_ extent.  But if you look at the
track history of even professional writers of backgrounds
and other groups full of knowledgable and diverse people,
then you have to come the conclusion that you are fooling
yourself if you think you can be sure of catching even 
all of the major ramifications.  It is very difficult 
to see them all because of how they ripple out.

I would find a country in the same condition as colonial America or Great
Britain and open a company.
I would then use my advanced technical knowledge to produce products that
can be produced that TL and
turn a profit. Within that company estabilsh a R&D facility (like a 18th
century version of Edision\'s Lab) to work on
advanced tech product using the database as a guide to avoid deadends. Then
over the years encourage people with good
ideas to leave the company to found their own startups producing goods. Do
this putting out venture capital reap some profits and then
turn it over to the people starting it.

The reason for this is that you have a small starship crew and that means
there a limited amount of viewpoints to figure how to apply
the tech you know to this world. What you want is to have a large amount of
people you can working indepently working on advance so that
a few blind alleys doesn\'t stall the overall effort. The main company hold
the tech database like a patent but does not use as a basis to estabilsh a
monopoly. Instead you want to say something "Hey, George, you doing some
fine work in refining, how about you take that bauxite idea of yours and
form a company in exchange say for 5% of the gross. You will want to look at
this (handing him some papers on aluminin) and work with Harold\'s electric
company on this. I can probably bring them in for another 2%.

You keep doing this and do not go with exclusive lisence or anything that
will build a monopoly in the begining and you will have a wildfire of
technological growth started.

I am selling/auctioning off my entire Traveller collection! Some items
may be uncommon, so jump in. I have quoted MINIMUM prices on all items
and will sell at those prices, BUT reserve the right to sell at a
HIGHER price if someone really wants something and is prepared to make
a higher offer to secure the sale, and i also reserve the right to
withdraw all items from sale if sufficient interest is not shown in
the sale as a whole.

******IMPORTANT NOTES ON PRICES AND PAYMENT******
I am in AUSTRALIA, but because most potential buyers will be from the
USA, prices quoted below are in US DOLLARS, AND SHIPPING CHARGES WILL
BE ADDITIONAL TO THE ADVERTISED PRICE.

BUT (BUT!!!), I will require final payment by International Money
Order in AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, so as to avoid conversion fees at my end.
FOR EXAMPLE, something advertised at $10 US will convert to about
$15.50 AUS, plus shipping (air or sea, your choice)

CONDITION OF ITEMS
Unless otherwise stated, all books are at least VGC to Mint, most are
VGC to Excellent (I used to play with p\'copies to avoid wear on the
originals), but boxes will show some scuff wear.

OFFERS
Offers are to be made by e-mail to me at witepapr@access.net.au no
later than 14 May 1998, clearly stating your offer for the item and
its correct description, if you want to pay for AIR or SEA mail
shipping rates, plus your e-mail address so I may respond - NOTE I may
NOT be able to acknowledge each and every e-mail bid; just assume if
it is not bounced back to you that I received it!
I will contact the successful bidders asap after 14 May 1998 with
final cost including shipping rates.

I find this hard to believe.  I have a very early version they don\'t
appear in.  Even if they were, it only shows the utility of dropping
bad ideas before they cause to much trouble.

Hardly.  Those products that even mention drop tanks are hardly unusable.
As to people\'s campaigns, you just leave them as an optional rule with
a warning about the implications.

[more of the same.]

And from where I sit, you have made a dubious assumptions to come up with
a simplistic analysis and even that showed fundamental changes to the costs
of the basis for all shiping  and hence for the entire economy and the basis
for politcal and social interaction.  You have also based this on the unsupportable
(by your own admission) that you will be able to see all the ramifications.
Your claims have done nothing to address the fundamental point that a
change of the magnitude to the basis for economy and social and politcal
interaction can\'t help but fundamentally change society.

See, isn\'t it easier to make sweeping generalizations about the other
person\'s position rather than post real arguements?  Now you are certainly
going to be all outraged that you didn\'t say any such things and that
this is totally inaccurate.  How do you think others feel when you post
things like this?  Even if the points have been hashed over (and they have),
I\'m content to let others who have been reading what we post decide for
themselves who has been more persuasive rather than have to make these sort
of attacks.

This isn\'t trial.  The fact is that ramification won\'t come up and
screw up your background on the ass if you a careful to not make
fundamental changes.  Conversely, if you look at setting that have
introduced such changes, they almost always had such problems.  To
me, that is a good lesson that such changes are to be avoided unless
you have a good reason.  I don\'t see a good reason here.

You are being hypocritical.  Read why I am responding to.  You simply
asserst that it is a big change but not as big as other changes that
have been discussed.  I simply asserted that is was bigger.

Hogwash.  I have provided examples and responded to your analysis.  You
want me to reiterate my arguements so you can attack them with the
same old counter arguements and keep beating a dead horse.  I have
a life and don\'t have time for these games.  If you really want
to be able to claim victory because I won\'t go around in circles
(yet again in yet another thread) then be my guest.

I\'m willing to stand on what I\'ve writting.  I\'m even willing to do it
without making slams against the other person.  You appear to be
unwilling to do this.

[More of the same....]

When it comes to the point on wether political changes are really the 
most fundamental, all you have _ever_ don\'t is call it ridiculous
and splitting hairs.

Well, I figured if you were going to do it....

Then don\'t attack my possition as if the point didn\'t exist.

Universal and coordinatred universal time. For all practcical purposes 
they mean "Greenwhich mean time". UT (more properly, UT1) is defined from
the rotation of the earth and positions of stars; UTC is defined from
atomic clocks and is the one that periodically has leap seconds added to it.

(Don\'t even ask me about TDT, TAI, ET, UT0, TCG, and TCB...Although basic
timekeeping in the Imperium is probably straightforward, and there are 
astronomical markers that can be used to synchronize clocks, nonetheless
memorizing all the different acronyms for Imperial time systems must give
young astronomers major headaches.)

I suspected as much, but I\'d never struck this UTC thing before. The
military still use GMT, though they have alphanumeric names for the
different time zones (GMT is Zulu, I think).

Why did they change?

    This is exactly how it social status in Prison was explaned to me by a
college buddy (who was back in college because of a stint as a Corrections
Officer in a NYS Maximum Security Prison).

If you had the .38 revolver, the population still called you [censored].
If you had a AR-15, your were "Mr. [censored]."
If you had the 12 gauge pump shotgun loaded with double-O buckshot, you
were "Mr. [censored], SIR!"
