  That\'s it! The real reason for all this is that the charges for a
site license are independent of the number of users, so it simply is
provably uneconomic for low-pop planets to develop. Very cunning of
the Vilani to install such an insidious system for suppressing their
subject worlds, and loyal satellites could be rewarded with discounts,
bonus frequent jumper points, or even the semi-mythical fee waiver.

Rob,
I hate to tell you this, but the name just totally confused me, I thought
this was about Infini-D, a 3-D graphics rendering package.  I was thinking,
cool, someones using Infini-D to do Traveller graphics.

folks were trying out. One was a riot-control \'sonic cannon\', but the other

The idea was that a powerful low-frequency wave passed throught the Mantle
could cause tectonic activity due to resonance along fault lines. The fear
amongst the few who knew about this was that the Chinese had one, poised to
shake the San Andreas Fault to bits.

This one ranks (to me) alongside the Alternative Roswell Theory. Daft, but
interesting.

ART? Ok then. It goes like this....

Roswell was a coverup. A really good one. It\'s got you all confused, hasn\'t
it? Mosat people say \'crank\' when you mantion you believe that an alien
ship crashed at Roswell. The Us govt has kept the debate alive, with
slightly more creaky evidence released every time the controversy dies
down. The whole thing has been successfully marginalised by keeping only
the most dedicated nutters involved. It\'s kept everyone looking in the
wrong place. A risky coverup, but successful.

ART goes on to say that they\'re really covering up something that happened
somewhere else. It\'s the most daring coverup in history, since they\'re
pretending that a UFO crashed to cover the fact that a UFO crashed. But
somewhere else. Alaska, maybe, or New York (would anyone actually notice?).

Like I said, daft. But fun.

And what if these hypothetical aliens were space pirates, who\'d fiddled
with their Transponder because of virus in their computer, but were killed
by Terran bacteria after actually LIKING the movie of a SF book.....

Maybe they\'d want to cover that up too....

In fun, MJD.

But on the subject of copyright: Those fellows over in Brussels tell us
that British copyright should stand at Life +70 years now, not 50 as
previously. Since Marc is still posting to the TML and producing Traveller
material, you need to credit him for at least the next 70 years. Hopefully
a good bit more.

While there is no copyright in a title, where a title is insuperable from
the work of an author (as is clearly the case here) then any legal
proceedings would be an all-but-certainty. While I\'m sure it hardly matters
for a single web page produced out of love for the game, the enforceable
legal requirement is that you credit FarFuture etc. with a
copyright/registered trademark note. Do it out of courtesy, even if you\'re
sure nobody would want to take action against you for omitting. I forget
who is was who said, \'Copyrights last as long as you defend them\' but if
too many people start omitting the notice, then it might become necessary
to move to defend those rights - just in case. Nobody wants that to happen.

Besides, the notice tells those who\'ve accidentally stumbled on your web
page what it\'s all about. It might even lead them to take a look at the
game....

The copyright notice should be automatically extended to 1997,1998 etc as
time moves on. The material is copyright and remains so except in those
cases where the copyright holder grants permission or allows the material
to pass into the public domain.

This is more the approach I\'ve been taking in another little project to
fill my spare tea breaks.

Yes, the librarian in me has struck again and I\'ve been working on a
\'webliography\' to complement the bibliography.

The idea here is to provide a giant \'bookmark\' page with details of web
pages, owners, contents, last update and so forth.  I think Peter has the
idea.

Please note that I said web pages not web sites. Doing Web sites just
doesn\'t do justice to contents and so forth and makes a \'subject\' approach
to the web pages very difficult.  Traveller web pages are such a broad mix
of contents that knowing whether one particular site will contain anything
you\'re interested in can take a lot of surfing.  What is needed is a more
\'comprehensive\' (as Peter rightly says) approach to the whole thing.  Thus
the idea would be to be able to both look up particular authors:

a.non
     page with library data
     page with starship designs
     etc
b.non
     page with Traveller links
     page with alternate rules
     page with starship designs
     page with starship deckplans
     etc


AND be able to look up particular subjects, e.g.

Starship Designs
     a.non
     b.non

Alternate Rules
     b.non


Software
     c.non

(Of course the possibilities are endless for further subdivisios of these
subjects)  (the whole idea of an overarching classification
scheme-cum-thesaurus for Traveller has now been exercising my brain for
some decade and a half)


This is where I\'ve come unstuck as there are just so many pages (not a
problem by itself) but of course they\'re constantly changing (and I have a
life - of sorts - to lead in addition to doing this).  If everyone just
quit developing pages now (!) then I reckon I could get it done by next
summer but it\'s like painting the <insert local metaphor here>.

A couple of months ago I *think* I had a handle on every Traveller site in
existence - though I\'m quite ready to be corrected on that - having done
various searches with a variety of engines and having waded round the web
ring a couple of times and then followed up everyone\'s \'links\' pages.  So I
*think* I\'m up on the scale of the problem.  (And can see why Rob was
suggesting the easier [1] option of collecting web pages into centralized
repositories).

I believe I\'m right in thinking that it\'s possible to have a page notify
you when it gets changed (via a third party service?) but I\'ve not explored
this and the prospect of submitting every Traveller page for this kind of
notification is fearsome.  (though if anyone can let me know where/how you
go about this I\'d be grateful and might try a few pages as an experiment).

Given the problems involved I\'m not certain I can go any further than I
have unless I can persuade work that this should be a full time project!
However, it has been interesting and if nothing else, I\'ve been seriously
impressed with the quality of some of the pages out there.


On the whole, the idea makes the 18 months my bibliography took look like a
picnic of simplicity and straightforwardness [2].  If anyone has any bright
ideas, I\'d welcome them.  But I have a feeling that we\'re into the
worrisome realm that is exercising the minds of an awful lot of information
professionals at the moment as some kind of bibliographic control is
required/desired for the Internet in all its glory.

My apologies to those who\'d rather surf free and for whom the above must
seem incomprehensibly alien. [3]

This is because HE explosions penetrate by blowing a hemispherical chunk
out of the target rather than drilling a hole. Therefore the penetrative
ability of HE is proportional to the cuberoot of the energy content in the
bomb times some fiddle factor instead of linear.
The important thing here is the exponent and not the fiddle factor.

Somebody called this error a minor one? I\'d like a design/combat system
that handles starships as well as fists with the SAME rules - not for
complexitys sake but for simplicity. Me as a ref want to just look at the
stats for something and use it wether it is an x-ray 500 MJ laser shooting
at butterflies at 1 AU.

No separation between personal/vehicle/starship weaponry/damage/hits as
this will only complicate things on the edges between the systems (Joe
Stargazer shooting at the fleeing ship with his Brontosaurus plazma
pistol).

	Well, basically, here in Quebec things get done differently; BS
(trust me, it is) is split up into six modules; we do 5-6 weeks per module,
write an exam, and move on to the next one.  So, instead of doing things in
a sensible way like they do in the rest of the country, I get to pay
through the nose for tuition, lose in the mid five figures of work revenue
merely due to time spent in class, not to mention 6 2-week breaks to cram
for exams, and have the stress and angst prolonged for another school year.

	Basically, the whole process is just designed to fail as many
people as possible, in order to weasel around the universal access to the
profession requirement, and to make as much money off of us as possible.
And I won\'t bring up the bizarre and arbitrary marking practices designed
to produce 40% failure rates.  However, this year\'s first exam wasn\'t as
bad; they only failed 25%.  I guess that the class action suit last year\'s
class launched has rattled the Bar\'s cage a bit.

	That being said, the reason I\'ve been able to keep posting here is
because I have absolutely no life.  I work, go to school, occasionally
study, eat, sleep, ride public transport, and read my email.  And that\'s
it.  And the hilarious thing is is that once I get out of BS, I won\'t be
done; I\'ll still have six months of low-paid articling to do before I get
set loose on the streets with the power to sue :\\.

ObTrav: Next time you have your players convene in The SpacePort Bar(tm)*,
have some bar students drowning their sorrows in alcohol in the corner;
it\'d add a touch of pathos :).

* The SpacePort Bar(tm): an enormous chain of franchised drinking
establishments with identical decor and wares, found across the Imperium.
There is one in every Imperial starport rated above E.  Due to obscure
Solomani heraldic influences, the chain\'s logo is a stylized, curvilinear,
yellow-coloured capital letter "M".

Try the method I use: When you run into an odd UPP then spend 15 minutes
trying to come up with an explanation for them that works and that you
haven\'t already used too often (Like the "exotic biosphere" to explain
agricultural planets outside life zones). If you can\'t come up with
something, roll a die. On a result of 1-5 you make the smallest change
necessary to make the UPP make sense. On a 6, try for another 15 minutes
and also consider reusing ideas that you\'ve already used too often; perhaps
one of them can stand one more use. If you still can\'t come up with anything,
give up and change something.

True enough. Once you are alone in a system with a superior enemy and
empty tanks there is not much you can do about it. However, once the
would-be pirate had managed to suborn the astrogator (quick work, btw;
the Angel arrives at a starport, the kidnappee books passage, the
terrorist organisation manages to suborn the astrogator and the Gazelle
jumps to Djinni at least two days before the Angel sets off -- all in
one week. That is one impressive terrorist organisation. Well-funded too,
it can afford to keep a 350 megacredit ship on retainer... whew!), he
would have been smarter to have the traitor direct the ship to a rendevouz
point in empty space. That way he could be sure that none of the navy\'s
infrequent patrols nor any armed private ship would be around to interfere.

>The pirates, actually political dissidents (It\'s a long story) boarded

In that case they weren\'t pirates. The whole point about piracy as a means
of living is that you have to make your captures pay your expenses. If you
are backed by someone willing to pay for it, we\'re talking about warfare.

>The PC\'s offered no resistance as they took away one of the passengers.

And, hopefully, the traitor too?

That is the least part of it. It\'s true that a victim that fights back can
cause millions of credits worth of damage, so I won\'t say that persuading
your victim to give up without a fight is not useful, but the main problem
is engineering a situation where you can be alone with your victim long
enough for that to become an issue.

Heh. 

And all along I though I had a mostly un-rhymable name.
Of course, as good as it is, I won\'t be satisfied until 
you have Celine Dion doing it live from Memphis.

No, you have to spread the whole cost of that one ship you do lose per
thousand jumps out over all the cargo you move in those 1000 jumps.

Obviously this is one of those famous differences of opinion. IMO a hard-to-
disguise, multi-million-credit object would be harder to get a good price on
than the average loot. Remember that the ship would be hotter than hell even
in a neighboring independent state (unless it is the Zhodani Consulate).
However greedy the local government, they still have to keep it a secret,
lest the Imperium treat them the same way it treated Tarkine. 

A classic feature of most of the crime stories I have read is that hot
merchandize is fenced for extremely low percentages. I don\'t know about
any factual figures.

However, some changes (to FS data) do need to be made in any case:
- -The Canon-violating B-Pop worlds must be changed down, to A or lower
- -Those worlds, where canon info states facts that contradict FS-Data

Well, we do have some data about that point. Not about megacorporate fleets,
but about Al Morai, a sector-wide company in Spinward Marches:

According to _Spinward Marches Campaign_ Al Morai is a sectorwide merchant
line with 53 3000 T merchant ships serving 52 worlds. The company also owns
4 _Gazelle_ Class ships used as route protectors to suppress pirates.

The cargo carriers cost MCr809 apiece (actually, that is the cost of a 3000 T
Tukera cargo carrier (from _The Traveller Adventure_). The Al Morai version
is almost identical. It has 59 T less cargo space and 20 more passenger
cabins, but the cost of the Tukera version can\'t be much off). It has 1200 T
of cargo space and carries 30 passengers. Crew size is not mentioned, but the
Tukera carrier has 15 crew. It is Jump-4 and 1G.

Operating expenses for one of these babies would be:

Crew salaries (Assuming a relevant skill level of 3 for all): 811,200/year;
Life support: 2,250,000/year (assuming 25 jumps with all cabins sold out);
Fuel: 3,000,000/year (assuming Al Morai can refine its own fuel);
Maintenance: 809,000/year; and profit and bank payments: 50,562,500/year, for
a total of Cr57,432,700.

If the ship is completely filled up each trip and the ship makes 25 trips per
year, it shifts 30,000 T of cargo and 750 passengers. Assuming each passenger
ticket costs 8 times as much as a T of freight, freight charges will be
Cr1600/T and tickets will be Cr12,800 apiece. (These figures change a bit
if you assume less than 100% utilization and more trips per year (IMO a
scheduled liner should be able to make a jump every 10 days on the average,
but that is, of course, not canonical)).

A _Gazelle_ costs MCr356 apiece. Maintaining one will cost about MCr25 apiece
(not counting administrative overhead). Four will cost MCr100. Divided out on
the operating expenses of the carriers, freight charges becomes 50 credits/T
more and tickets 400 credits more. This is about a 3% increase.

Several questions comes to mind:

1) How does four patrol ships protect Al Morai carriers in 52 different
   systems at a time? By implied threat? "Mess with our ships and in a
   few months you\'ll have four ships quartering the stars after you!"?
   Hardly. Or by escorting the carriers through two or three trouble spots?
   The book does say that Al Morai mostly services Class A and B starports,
   most of which would presumably have their own defenses. But if that is
   so, why dosen\'t Al Morai just bypass the trouble spots? Each ship gross
   close to MCr60 per year, but they only net about MCr10. If bypassing two
   or three systems will lose you 20 or 30 MCrs but allow you to save 100,
   surely that is the sensible thing to do? These are jump-4 ships, after
   all. I defy anyone to find two class A or B starports in the Spinward
   Marches that you can\'t connect by jump-4 routes that only pass through
   population 7+ systems or naval bases. Of course, if you already have the
   ships and have to pay for them anyway, you may as well get some use out
   of them...

2) Does Al Morai\'s four _Gazelles_ protect all the competition as well, or
   do they merely shift the attention of the pirates away from its own
   ships? If so, do the other merchant companies also use 3% of their gross
   to maintain escorts of their own? Akerut, a Tukera subsidiary operating
   in Aramis, an economically backward subsector, has 50 5000 T freighters
   worth just under MCr50,000. Does Akerut maintain another MCr1500 worth of
   patrol ships? What about its rival Oberlindes, said to roughly parallel
   the operations of Akerut even though they only recently moved into the
   area? Does that mean that Oberlindes have 5 or 10 times as many ships in 
   Regina, its main area of operations? Are these squadrons as efficient at
   patrolling a mere subsector as Al Morai seems to be patrolling a whole
   sector? Is Al Morai the only sector-wide company with its own patrol
   ships? If they are, how can they stay competetive? If not, how can a poor
   pirate get the peace he needs to do business? And what about the big
   boys like the megacorporations? How many ships does 3% of their gross
   amount to?

The actual figure will vary a bit according to the ship design syastem
you use. A Subsidized Liner from _The Traveller Book_ (CT) costs MCr237.
A similar design I did with QSDS1.5 costs MCr166 (Without weapons; six
turrets will add 13-18 MCr depending on weapon mix). The actual bank
payments on a MCr166 ship alone is MCr8.3/year. To this comes operating
expenses (hands up those of you who thinks a pirate will want a greater
\'salary\' than a legitimate crewman...) and a fair return on your own
investment. Of course, and armed ship will cost about MCr180 (and MUCH
more if you install a decent computer); I forgot that orginally.

You can suppose that the ship is a 40 year old paid-up ship worth only
1/4 of the initial purchase price, but in that case you have to assume
increased repair bills (There has to be a reason why paid-up ships aren\'t
a better investment than new ships). The bottom line is that such a ship
should be able to gross more than MCr11/year by legitimate means. For
\'the pirate life\' to be competitive, it needs to pay more. For it to be
at all possible it has to pay the expenses at the very least...

In order to be sure of intercepting a particular ship, the pirate has to aim
at being in the target system at least two days before the scheduled arrival
(the pirate may be a day late and the target a day early). This means that
he will arrive anytime from 4 to 0 days before the victim. On the average he
will arrive two days early and have to hang around. Not a problem if the
system have no defense forces at all, but a BIG problem otherwise.

But how often does a ship jump to or through a system with absolutely no
defense forces with a full cargo of radioactives or pharmaceuticals? This
becomes even more of a problem for the pirate when drop tanks are invented
in the late 11th Century; once drop tanks are available, a merchant with an
especially valuable cargo can just bypass the trouble spots.

....which is the distance to "orbit 4", which is where Vland is supposed to
be according to the VILANI & VARGR sourcebook.  That\'s fair enough.

Now, given 
  * Vland is a size 9 world massing 1.45 Terras (8.65 * 10^24 kg) [V&V]
    (i.e., much less than the star)
  * Urakkalan is a F8 V star massing 1.14 Sols (2.27 * 10^30 kg) [V&V]
  * The Vilani year lasts 478.72 Imperial days (41361400 seconds) [V&V,
    but also suggested in other sources]

then, using freshman physics, I make Vland\'s orbital radius 1.25 AU (or
about 187000 Mm).  I think the rules in WBH work out to 1.3 AU.  This 
makes a 137000 AU deshi work out to about 110000 "Vilani AU".  A 1.6 AU
orbit seems to come out to a 692-day year. 

Oh, and yet another source of compiled sector names is at the URL
  http://www.cs.umn.edu/~bonnevil/traveller/sector-3.1.txt

It\'s a bit easier to read than the recent postings, and includes the 
components of Imperial domains and Zhodani provinces, as well as most
alternate names.  Strangely, I think this same subject came up about
a year ago, too....

One of the web sites I\'ve seen has that information detailed...the trick (of

I write software for a living and our legal department is always having to explain
US copyright law to us. All of our code has to include a copyright notice like
this one. It means that the copyright began in 1977 and that the original text=20
was changed in every year between 1977 and 1996 inclusive. Our lawyers are
always vague on exactly _what_ that means, but it seems that the copyright
clock is reset every time the text is altered by the copyright holder, so in this
case the copyright expires in (1996 + 50 years).

Copyright notices of the form "Copyright 1977,1981,1996" mean the same
thing, except that the content was only altered in the listed years. Books which
are reissued with corrected typos, for instance, have this kind of copyright notice.

I ran a piracy thing in the District268 Glisten subsectors as a background
thing to distract my players from the real issues (corrution and cloak &
daggers in the Naval Intelligence). A noteworthy invention of the pirate
boss was something called a "Henchman bank". All passengers not wealthy
enough to ransom but fit enough to fight where frozen and auctioned at the
"Henchman bank".

Those who bought them used them as cannon fodder for that dangerous first
wave through the airlock. If they survived and were loyal they might be
promoted etc and some actually became pirates themselves.
Each henchman was tracked through a UV tatoo at the neck so that they could
be identified when rebought/escaped etc.

This scheme kept the crew costs down for pirates as well as made
interesting adventures for PC who lost in a pirate encounter.

The problem is probabilities; if you allow multiple attempts to accomplish
any task, you can pretty much guarantee that players will always succeed
in moderate amounts of time - only 3-4 attempts, given how painfully easy
even "Staggering" tasks are in the T4 system, even if the operator isn\'t
very skilled. While it\'s true that more data/longer exposures do improve
your chances of detection in the real world, it doesn\'t build up as rapidly 
as multiple die rolls do (instead, signal-to-noise goes up as sqrt(time) and
detection probability is a complex function of signal-to-noise.) 

The other way to have done the rules would be to redo the table with a complex
chart giving typical integration time to make a detection as a function 
of distance and planet orbit and sensor size, with successful skill rolls
giving only a small boost in success chances - that would be more accurate
(and almost completely deterministic) but harder to use in practice. Making
it a skill roll to detect seemed better from a rollplaying standpoint but 
does mean one has to have artificial kludges to make things work out right...

No, the copyright hasn\'t expired.

Nope. Oberlindes arms its merchants (Traveller Adventure) so that 3% is
probably spread amongst the ships,

and they\'re probbly armed with military surplus weapons like a High
Lightning Cruiser.... ;-) (this last bit tongue in cheek)

That means the material has original copyright dates ranging from 
1977 to 1996 (various parts being written at different times).  
Copyright marks make no reference to when it expires.

I don\'t recall ever hearing of a black globe gun.  Perhaps you are 
thinking of the anti-particle accelerator described in JTAS#20, which 
could chew up planets.

   In real life, you can increase your odds of detecting something by
   piling up data, but the effect is not linear.  It goes as the square
   root of the summed data that you have.  In other words, you have to
   quadruple the amount of time to halve the uncertainty.  So if the
   players want a second die roll at the same odds, they must spend three
   more `turns\' (for four turns total).  To get a third die roll, they
   must spend 5 more turns, for 9 turns total.
   
   To get an Nth die roll, they must spend 2N-1 more turns, for N^2
   turns total.
   
   Just another excuse to introduce a physics lesson to Trav discussion. 8^)
   
   -Rob
   
   PS, this does not apply if something happens to change the rate that
   the data come in, say, if the target goes active, comes out from
   behind a shadow, etc.
   
   PPS, if this is too complicated for you to implement in a game, then
   you can always set an average time for a turn, and rule that the
   players only get one roll, as was originally suggested.  After all,
   this statistical effect only illustrates what we all know already:
   that if you don\'t see something the first time you look, you probably
   won\'t see it the second time either.

   There is a superhero game called `DC Heroes\' with such a system.  It
   was developed so that the same rules could be used to simulate Batman
   kicking down a door and Superman throwing Darkseid into a solar orbit.
   It\'s a unique and inventive system that\'s easy to use.  You\'d need to
   tweak it a bit to replace its comic-book feel with a science-fiction
   one.  I\'ve used it for Trav before, and it works fine as-is as long as
   you aren\'t getting into gear-head subtleties.  (As it stands right
   now, it gives a physically reasonable result within a factor of two or
   so.)
   
   DC Heroes is currently out of print.  As of two years ago, it was sold by
   Mayfair Games.

Marc, I don\'t know if you\'re aware of it, or if perhaps you\'ve
rejected it for some reason, but Jim Vassilakos\'s GALACTIC
program has a fairly complete list of sector names and locations,
including multiple languages for sectors that were named by
multiple stellar powers.  I don\'t remember Jim\'s URL for it, but
I do know that you can get it by visiting Freelance Traveller and
following the links to INFORMATION and then Traveller Support
Software for Your Computer.  It doesn\'t quite use the same
coordinate system that you did in your post, although the "sign"
of the coordinates follow the same pattern (i.e., "increasing"
toward Hiver space).

	Gotcha ... so the small sonic obliterator is out. Problem, but
not a major one. I\'ll just have to smuggle the parts in in my

   I always assumed in the *Third Imperium setting* that the starport and
the local TL didn\'t necessarily have a correlation.  Thus if you had a world
that had a TL of 6 and a starport of \'A\' because either an outside
corporation or the local inhabitants imported all the technology necessary
to make the starport function.  Even if it is a low population system, this
can be explained away as the employees of the starport are not local
inhabitants, they are imported workers who stay in the system for a fixed
period of time and then rotate out.  Naturally if the system were to be cut
off from the rest of interstellar society (by war, etc.), the starport would
rapidly degrade until it reached a more "natural" state for the local TL,
which in the case of TL 6 would mean that class \'A\' starport would probably
drop to \'D\'.

>I wouldn\'t use X for a starport. It means interdicted, and causes some
>confusion. This table comes from T4.1. 

   The problem with using the \'X\' designation in this way is what happens,
let\'s say, when you start developing scenarios and background data for a
campaign that takes place in the Aldebaran Sector at the time the Solomani
begin their expansion into it?  All of the worlds they are going to
encounter are beyond the edge of civilization, therefore don\'t have marker
beacons, or anything else to designate a landing area.  How does a referee
treat such a world?  Would it therefore have a UWP of Yxxx000-0 (where \'x\'
is some number)?  And what of the designation \'Red Zone\', \'Amber Zone\', etc?
I realize that historically these were issued by the TAS, but shouldn\'t
there by another way designating interdicted worlds?

Harold

	Interesting. What kind of stone? I based my original disbelief
of the CSC results on a rather nifty program left over from my
first assignment--calculates cratering, projectile damage, etc.
for both small nuclear and HE explosions in earth over stone. I
set the earth thickness to 0, and came up with a MUCH smaller
number for crater radius than 240m. Or perhaps it was crater
depth--the point is, a damage system that doesn\'t account for the
differences between penetration, blast, energy and cratering-type
damage can lead to some ridiculous numbers. And I can guarantee
you that none of the examples you provided will penetrate to a
bunker under 240m of granite. The US Air Force just updated its
deep-penetration bunker killer, and it\'s a nuke with quite a bit
more destructive capability* than a 250kg iron bomb AND a
specially-designed casing to ensure it penetrates quite a ways
into dirt or soft surface materials before detonating.

	As for that being a minor quirk, any of the people who run more
military oriented or mercenary type campaigns might disagree.
It\'s one thing to apply common sense to the TNE rule that a
shotgun in the mouth has a 15% chance of missing. It\'s quite
another thing to give completely bogus results to players with NO
way of estimating the real results (which you can do with the
shotgun; quite a bit harder to do with large explosions ...)

* Officially, somewhere between 1 and 999kT, which is all the AF
will say about _any_ nuke.

I have some problems with some of the figures for nuclear rockets.  Taking
into account the differences in density of HRF and LHyd (0.3 vs 0.07) the
thrust to reaction mass ratios for some of the nuclear rockets are a bit
to low. 

The Isp of Lhyd LOX rockets is around 450 seconds for conventional, solid
core nuclear rockets it\'s around 800 Adjusting for fuel densities the
difference in thrust per kg of fuel/reaction mass between a TL 8 NTR & a
TL 8 LH chemical rocket is 0.57.  450/800 = 0.56, so we are on target
here. 

However, I\'m assuming that the TL 8 advanced NTR is a liquid core nuclear
rocket.  The Isp of such a rocket is around 1500 seconds. The fuel
consumption should be more like 3.1 m3/hr/kN not the 4.17 listed. 

Also, the gas core nuclear rocket is rather under-powered.  All the
figures I\'ve seen have rated it as having an Isp of between 2500 & 10,000
seconds.  Even at 2500 it\'s fuel consumption should be 1.9, and if we
assume it\'s performance is more like 5000 seconds we get a fuel
consumption of around 0.95 m3/hr/kN.  This doesn\'t seem unreasonable since
we are talking about TL 9 here.

Now I\'ve got a request (beg) for any of you graphically gifted
geniuses out there--would you be interested in creating a theme
for the site? That\'s one of the neat new features of FrontPage,
but all I\'ve been able to do is kludge something clumsy together.
I\'d really like to have a snazzier, futuristic look than what
I\'ve got.

Basically, a FrontPage theme consists of the following elements:
	* Buttons used for vertical navigation bars: these are blank
buttons (FP automatically adds the appropriate text in the
specified font). Up to three different buttons can be used:
normal, "pushed" (used when displaying the button for the current
page), and hover (used when the cursor is hovering over a button)
	* Buttons used for horizontal navigation bars: same as above,
except the buttons are laid out horizontally
	* Buttons used for "tape-deck" style button bars: Next,
Previous, Parent and Home
	* Buttons used for "top bar" style bars: used for a navigation
bar that points to the top-level pages regardless of where you
are.
	* Horizontal divider that replaces horizontal rules
	* Banner image, used for the title images
	* Three different bullet images, used for different levels of
indent
	* Background image, used for the foundation--I like a starry
background, but the one I\'ve got is too busy.

If you\'re interested, email me. Thanks!

	Actually, I prefer something like this to an arbitrary "you can
only try once"--especially if it\'s something where looking longer
really does make a difference. Up to a point, of course. But to
exaggerate, if I look for a planet for 1 second, my chances of
finding it are miniscule. But compound those 1 second data
collects into hours, and days, and the odds increase. Agreed, not
linearly, but off the top of my head, your rules sound fair.
It\'ll still have close to the same effect--players won\'t sit
there rolling dice until they get the answer they want*--but it
doesn\'t sound so arbitrary.

*Especially when they don\'t know whether they\'re failing because
the rolls are going against them, or there\'s really nothing
there. In addition to using some form of uncertain task, this is
another reason I like task systems with a fixed number of dice. I
can just tell them to roll, and tell me what level task the roll
would succeed at. That way I don\'t have to give them _any_
information about how hard it really is (especially if it\'s not
possible at all!).

He maybe confused with the Black Glode generator that was equiped of the
Keniter (sp?) crusiers.  They were one of the original ships listed in the
original Trav. release what 15 almost 20 years ago.  But that was a
defensive weapon.  It was like a giant heat sink, it bleed the laser fire
out into space and protected the ship.

I agree, multiple attempts should be allowed, but whether they make
detetion easier or not should be up to the GM..circumstances.

Now, doesn\'t that indicate to you that "Staggering" tasks are too easy (no
I won\'t start that debate again ;-), and/or that detection is too easy at
too long a range?  That one I might have to crank up.  Anyway, some sorts
of tasks might be "Impossible" or "Hopeless" or just plain impossible, and
the players can make as many attempts on an impossible one as they want and
never succeed.

The other part of it is the time element, each detection attempt might take
a full 30 minutes..or multiples of 30 minutes..depending on what you are
trying to detect, the range, etc.  Heck, you might be scanning only parts
of the sky on each attempt and it takes X scans to cover the entire
elliptic.  If each attempt takes an hour and you have to make 3, 4, 5 or
more attempts for *each* "gas giant" detection, well, I could live with
that.

There *is* an advantage in rolling a fixed number of dice, but there are
ways to get around the problems.

In a FTF game where the players are rolling dice in an uncertain situation
I won\'t tell them exactly how hard a task is.  I\'ll tell them to roll some
number of dice, and I\'ll roll several at the same time. Then I might use
their roll plus some of mine, or just mine, or just their\'s or do something
else entirely to determine what happened.  A quick glance at the second
hand of the wall clock is good for all sorts of randomization.  ;-)

My rule when it comes to just how hard tasks are..and just how skilled PC\'s
really are for that matter..is lie, Lie LIE!  ;-> Never tell them how hard
something *really* is unless they would know, but always be willing to tell
them how hard they *think* some task is.  Never tell them just how good
they are at something, but always be willing to tell them how good they
*think* they are.

Ah, hum!  I was, of course, following my rule in the previous paragraph.
Really! ;->

I think we are more in agreemnet than it seems. I am speaking from the stand
point of an early M0 campaign, where most of the worlds haven\'t been
recontacted yet. The current data from The M0 Campaign (First Survey) seems
to reflect a much higher percentage of construction capable \'ports on low
tech planets than is (IMHO) reasonable when layed out againt the percentages
of contact worlds in given sectors, also form M0 data. I merely wahted to
throw this point out for consideration if the data is EVER reconstructed. I
also think it reflects the problem with a world generation system that was
\'built\' for a Classic Traveller universe, where most of the worlds have
already had some contact with starfareing races.

At the end of the Long Night, I would expect to see far more planets in the
"degraded" catagory than not. Yet the available data, and the random
genration rules, don\'t really reflect this.

Of course this is all in MVHO, and filtered through the eyes of my own
campaign setting, so it\'s more in the "food for thought" catagory.

It means that different parts have different copyright dates, and the

Pleeeze pleeeze pleeeze build one!  If that nasty old grouch Hengie won\'t
front up for the parts and labor and insurance costs, the Sayat Bureau for
Oversight and Operationalization of Munitions would be all too delighted to
support this promising technology development initiative.

SayBOOM is currently fooling around with the FF&S1 spreadsheets from Antti
Lahtinen\'s site, trying to finalize a design for the Laser-Assisted
Biological Rubble Yield System (LABRYS), a standard-issue longarm.  Yes,
<yawn>.  Can someone gearier than me say whether FF&S2 has any significant
improvments in this sequence?  I\'m still wondering whether it\'s worth the
money... despite the really horrible things I can see all too clearly being
done with it by others on this list.

Sorry, but by the definition of E *any* plamnet can have one once
contacted. The ancient Egyptians could have managed a damn good type E.
One almost up to D standards, except for the lack of fuel (though if
you count water as unrefined fuel, they could manage a D by running
canals to the port.

Type D on a lot of planets (again, once contacted) can be any of a
number of things depending on TL. Examples:

A major seaport can handle starships easily. And they\'ll have cargo
facilities. Ditto for a major rail hub. If the US had been contacted in
the 1870s or 80 I fully expect that the starport would have either been
in Kansas City (major railhead) or Chicago (major railhead *and* major
port).

Airports can handle even starships pretty well. They,ll just set aside
an area off to one side for the VTOL types, and the horizontal landing
and takeoff types can be integrated into the existing traffic patterns
with a bit of work.

Note that in *all* these cases the locals can modify something they
already have to turn it into a starport, with varying degrees of
difficulty. Concrete dates back to Roman times. And the Romans (though
not the Egyptians) could have gotten around the lack of handy bedrock
by using the same techniques they used to build their roads. 

They "big" change is that for TLs where the locals don\'t have radio,
you either have to give them a radio, or arrange for heliograph type
signals. 

I rather like the idea of having the infrequent starship vists use a
facility that was built for *existing* traffic, and just had the
landing facilities tacked on.

I figure that during the Long night there will have been *very*
infrequent visits from other systems that haven\'t lost starflight
capability, and want to trade.

Figure Earth at the various TLs if it had starships visiting at
intervals of from 5 years to 50 years. There\'d be provisions made for
them, because the visits would be *important*, but they\'d mostly be
"add-ons". 

And I rather like the idea of the players contacting the starport and
getting hold of the seaport\'s portmaster, or the guy in charge of rail
traffic at a railhead. Getting the tower at an airport isn\'t as much of
a shock.

And getting a *real* low tech port (say the sort of thing the Romans or
Egyptians might have built) could be *real* interesting. "Land in the
middle of the square formed by the pyramids, please...."

Starport facility types
TL	type	facilities
- --	----	----
0	E	dedicated chunk of cleared rock. Will have "markers"
		such as pyramids, or at the very least something like
		the Nazca lines or megaliths such as at Stonehenge.
		Port buildings will be wood, stone, adobe, etc.
1	E	May be coexistent with seaport or river port. May be
		cleared bedrock, or constructed of worked
		stone/concrete over *very* well made foundations (Roman
		roads had foundations of various grades of stone that
		went almost 10 feet into the ground!) Primitive cranes
		for cargo handling, wagons and carts for moving cargo.
	D	As for E except that there is an ample water supply
		piped in for use as unrefined fuel.
2	D	Coexists with sea or river port. Water piped in for
		fuel. Landing field well constructed of stone/concrete,
		with some understanding of things like blast
		deflectors. Cargo handling gear is muscle or water
		powered.
3	D	May be at sea/river port *or* at rail junction. Steam
		power used for cargo handling. Actual hydrogen gas or
		possibly even liquid hydrogen available. Some
		electrical work, and machine tool work available.
4	D	Coexists with river/sea port, or rail junction. May
		have dirigible service available. Reinforced concrete
		used. Electrical power available.
5	D	Coexists with airfield. Radio used. 
6	D	Coexists with airport or possibly space launch
		facilities. Some electronics and computer facilities
		present. LH2 definitely avialable, as are fissionables
		and even deuterium, tritium and purified hydrogen (ie
		no D or T). Would be C or even B port if full repair
		facilities were present.

After TL 7, the locals *definitely* have at least orbital flight, and
thus should count as a "B" port.

Note that in the above, I\'m assuming that everything except ship to
ground comm is *native*. At TL 5 and 6, even *that* is native.

Or you could make the task roll result an (hidden) modifier to sensitivity:
Outstanding success: +1
Success:             +0.5
Failure:              0
Spectacular failure: -1

If the player wants to continue integrating just add to signal for time
integrated. I use something like this for all sensore tasks to simplify
things - especially when rolling for NPCs.

example I know of where a sector is named in print which has never had its\'
location specified in print.  [Private communication with Clay Bush, HIWG.]
/endquote

I believe I may have another for you.  \'Mission to Zephor\' (a Group One
\'adventure\' - actually more just a world description) mentions the Xova II
sector which I\'ve never seen located anywhere.  Anyone have any ideas?
(I\'ve always worked on the assumption it doesn\'t actually fit into the
\'standard\' map in much the same way as my own Astoria Reaches is a
\'standalone\' sector).

Just in case it helps

information on the Vilani for the TravLang lists development of their culture
and history has passed I\'ve come to develop something of a dislike for them.
They\'re arrogant, silently superior and more importantly so consumed with the
conservation of barely workable traditions and customs they\'d shoot the
solution a problem and then, as per tradition, pound it into a greasy puddle
of goo on the ground and then immolate that for good measure!  I find I have
little if any sympathy for them and their supposed plight, especially if you
read between the lines of the historical timeline I\'ve compiled to point out
the obvious excesses they\'ve committed and will commit throughout the history
of the 3I, which will eventually lead to the 3I\'s downfall and destruction.
     BUT...  Something I\'ve been mulling of in light of the historical
timeline I uncovered is this...

     Now think about the implications of this for a moment.  Around 300,000
BCE here on Earth our remote ancestors were solomnly considering if coming
out of the forest and leaving the safety of the trees was a good idea or not!
They were NOT constructing legends to be handed down for the next few hundred
thousand years of the goings on around them!  Yet the Vilani were, according
to Vilani & Vargr and some other tantalizing trace references in CT material.
     This means they obviously had frequent contact with the Droyne arround
them and intelligent contact at that!  Perhaps this means that Grandfather
had brought his sample Human populations across the Boca Divide of
intelligence.  If so that opens up a Real Can of Worms STS!  It\'s quite
possible if this is the case that those early Vilani immitated the social and
cultural norms and structures of the Droyne around them.
     Look at how soon the Vilani developed the caste system....

- -299,000 to -100,000: Encounters with Ancient War Machines.
- -99,999 to -20,000: Age of the Ancient\'s War Machines Empires.
- -19,000 to -11,000: Early Vilani Civilization.
     The last of the Ancient\'s War Machine\'s collapses and the Vilani no
longer have access through them to advanced technologies.  By this time
however the elements of the Early Vilani Civilization where in place as the
ballance of the Vilani had left their remote, if safe, mountain valley\'s.
Society both stratified and stabilized throughout this time.  Evolving first
classes and then into a caste system.

     BOOM!  As soon as the Ancient\'s War Machines get out of the way Vilani
culture explodes out of it\'s mountain retreats with this Caste system fairly
much already in place save for minor details of accomidation for local
situations.  So I\'m wondering now if Vilani society and culture isn\'t so much
an invention of theirs as much as it may well be an ancient copying and echo
of the Droyne society and culture their ancestors observed and mimiced.

     Thoughts?  Because if this is the case it\'s going to have some impact on
the very roots of the Vilani language you realize. ;)

	I\'m afraid.  I\'m very afraid.  That acronym has just got to be
attached to something so totally warped...

	FF&S is pretty darn cool.  I dunno whether any changes have been
made in the energy weapons sequences, but the gauss and firearms sequences
are more accurate; it is no longer possible to design an M-16 that comes
out at 20lbs.  There\'s still a problem with high-powered rifle recievers
coming out overweight and overlong, but other than that it\'s close enough
to keep me happy.

Detatching the Antenna from the transponder isn=B4t quite a good idea. If==20

    'body' => '     I\'ve been thinking of adventures for the Scholars of late as I start
thinking about doing a Milieu 0 campaign without a mercenary/maximum
firepower bent.  And in doing so I came up with a couple of utterly logical
ideas that definately have some humor potential when the non-Scholar type
PC\'s find them...

     After hacking through dense jungle, fighting off a bunch of Really Nasty
local lifeforms and finally digging through a few hundred feet of blast rated
rock at the bottom of a couple of lakes formed by the nukes dropped on the
site back durring the Interstellar Wars... no radiation of note OC. ;) The
PC\'s put in an airlock and gingerly follow the Scholars who hired them for
this expedition through it and down into the remains of the installation from
the Ziru Sirka, visions of treasures dancing in their heads STS...
     To find the Scholars shouting they\'re FOUND IT!!!  In the middle of a
vault of data storage crystals???  Turns out the "treasure" the Scholars were
after were the Back up files for that Sector of the Ziru Sirka.  Yup, three
thousand years of bureaucratic memos, reports and other files.  To scholars
it\'s PRICELESS!!!  It\'s value on the open market?  For thousand year old data
crystals with thousand year old bureaucratic memos for a government long dead
and gone? ROTFLMOL!!!!! <GRIN>

     The PC\'s and the Scholars have been jumping across half the subsector,
surveying one system after another until suddenly the sensors light up like a
bonfire!  With due precautions the PCs close on the object in orbit around
the world and discover... An abandoned shipyard!  And wonders of wonders
there are a couple of Warships in the docking slips!!!
     Then the PC\'s board them and find out the ships have been sitting their
for the past thousand or so years, open to space, the perfect examples of the
height of TL11 Vilani technology!  And just as the PCs are starting to get
ideas...  The Imperial Navy shows up!  The Naval Officer is very polite to
the Scholars, after all they\'ve got plans to conduct an archeological
inspection of the site.  For the unacredited PCs however... <GRIN>

     The PC\'s get a call from a Scholar, he needs them to take him to a world
easily a dozen parsecs away out past the fringe to Sieze the Prize he says!
After many travails and troubles the PCs and the Scholar jump into the system
and land on the Primary.  The Scholar practically wets himself trying to get
outside, rushes up to the first few natives and records everything they say
for about an hour, then makes image copies of a couple of the TL3 inhabitants
documents and tells you he\'s got it!
     When questioned a bit more closely... it turns out "The Prize" is
evidence to prove an obscure bit of linguistic drift theory.  For the Scholar
his vocal recording and image copies of written materials is all he needs to
publish and secure tenure.  For the PCs... well they did help to advance the
cause of science and knowledge.  Perhaps a mention in footnotes of his
paper???

     <GRIN> Scholars and their adventures could make things really
interesting... if you do them just right! ;)

Would it be better to say (c) Far Future Enterprises since 1977 ?
Then it had to be changed only when it was _really_ expired.

The fact that a ship does not exit in a gravity well was explained as 
being part of the jumpspace physics, so it is not possible to jump into a 
planet or asteroid. That would also mean that you can set the course 
directly to the sun of your target system and get out somewhere at the 
100 radius sphere.

A very interesting deduction (Vilani tracing its cultural roots to Droyne
and Ancients customs). As for disliking them I\'d say that I prefer Vilani
to Solomani any day in light of what they have done during the Stellar wars
and later.

I made such data for my little Astrogator=B4s program. I put the xboat data==20

each sector I could find in my DGP material are given in the form

for example.
I included by now the sectors Spinward Marches, Deneb, Reft, Riftspan=20
Reaches, Trojan Reach, Corridor, Vland, Ealiasiyw, Dark Nebula, Solomani=20
Rim, Magyar. I=B4m still searching for more.

The Borders shown on these maps I have included in a similar way, giving=20
the hex of the border with some data about the frame of the hex belonging=

This Astrogator=B4s Guide was not intended to be used outside of my=20

there is a lot of data, and it shifts around periodically.

For "Subject Name", try to use key words that might be turned
up with a search engine: deckplans, character, starport, etc.
Is it clear?  Here\'s an example:

I was browsing the web, and found a "very large" spreadsheet of sector

IIRC you need to speculate to make a profit on a far trader (A2), even in
CT and MT. That is if it isn\'t paid off.. it\'s reasonably easy then. T4 is
just following precedent.

I used George Herbert\'s numbers (which were what were supposed to go in
FFS2 in the first place). He has ISP=850 for a low-tech NTR (basically
NERVA.) The TL-8 advanced NTR is actually Timberwind (ISP 1200); there 
isn\'t a liquid NTR present. He quotes ISP 2000 for the gas core NTR,
which is conservative, but not overly so for a rocket type never yet 
constructed...In a variant campaign without contra-grav you might consider
cranking it up for the late TL-9/early TL-10 versions, I suppose. 
George does rocket science for a living - further criticism should be taken 
to him on Trav Tech, I think.

(My personal beef with the table - which I didn\'t change - is that the
TL-8 rockets are actually allmost all 1970s things like SSME and RD-180,
which gets into the whole definition of tech level question...)

Yes, it does - but I got tired of making everything "Impossible" and
I could never remember "Hopeless". The task system does need some tweaking...
too many names for marginally-different tasks at the medium range, not enough
at the hard end.

>detection is too easy at
>too long a range?
To be honest, detection should really be a pretty deterministic process; 
it either works or it doesn\'t, with a given total time translating into a 
given sensitivity. There\'s image processing and setting-up-the-sensor 
involved, but that would all be automated. I decided to go with skill rolls
instead to make PC\'s matter more - which isn\'t an unreasonable thing.
(And, also, truth be told, so that I only had to run one simulation (which
became the unmodified task) and could put in rather arbitrary modifiers for
different situations.)

That\'s possible; you certainly have to roll the spacecraft repeatedly to
scan properly and to scan the whole target system (though I sort-of averaged
this into the integration times.)

Hmm - informally, how many people would prefer a table that tells you
how long you have to look in a given situation, with no real task rolls
involved, to the approach I previously posted.

The task may be attempted multiple times. Each additional attempt requires
four times longer than the previous attempt; however, it is rolled at 1 DM
easier.

For example, a PEMS-13 is trying to detect a gas giant 1 parsec away
in the inner zone of a target system, a (Difficult+3=Impossible) task. 
The initial attempt requires one day. If this fails, a second attempt
may be made after four days of integration; this second attempt will be
Impossible-1=Staggering. A third attempt could be made after sixteen
days; this attempt would be Impossible-2 = Formidable.

(Someone should check my task names - I can\'t remember all the interminable,
interchangeable T4 task names.)

Including the mass-production discount, using automation to keep the 
crew down, using cheap low-performance technologies like HEPlaR, buying
and refining unrefined fuel are the classic things to help...but even those
may not help enough; this mostly underscores that the cargo prices are too
low.

(This was somewhat true in the Old Days too - a Far Trader couldn\'t support
itself with cargo and passengers, but only with successful speculative
trading.)

Two recommendations:

(1) Add the link type (mailto, http, ftp, etc.)

(2) Enclose links in angle brackets <foo> 
    This is a common convention, and some software makes links enclosed
in these brackets "hot". Also, it aids in parsing and extracting links
from the text automatically.

New Examples:

A third comment, about Metacontent and webpages:

We might want to consider compiling a list of common keywords, plus one
master keyword that could be "unique". There\'s lots of Traveller sites
out there that have nothing to do with the game. Y\'know, "World
Travellers! Free Air Miles! Order Now!" Let\'s cut some deadwood from our
web searches.

These "Traveller standard" keywords can be kept in a central repository,
ideally a Traveller FAQ (aside: where\'s the TML FAQ again? I remember
seeing one...) Those who want to search the web for Traveller stuff
could use it as a starting point.

Designers of webpages are encouraged to use the META tag so their pages
can be searched and indexed by all those marvellous web search engines.
(aside#2: do all search engines search META info, and give it extra
search "weight"? I understand that Altavista and Infoseek do for
sure...)

For the Master Keyword, I suggest: TravellerRPG
(one word, for uniqueness)

To start the ball rolling, other keywords could be: Character, Design,
Deckplans, Technical, Timeline, Filk, Contact, Amber Zone, Casual
Encounter, Sector, Starship, Vehicle, Spreadsheet, Mac Software, PC
Software, Worlds, Adventure, Errata, Aliens, plus all those other
acronyms we toss around here FFS, MMT, T4, CT, MT, TNE, RCES . . .


ADDENDA:

Here\'s info on META tags I gleaned from <http://www.htmlhelp.com/>


Appearance:     <META NAME=string CONTENT=string>
Attributes:     HTTP-EQUIV=string|NAME=string, CONTENT=string

The META tag is used to convey meta-information about the document, but
can also be used to specify headers for the document. You can use either
HTTP-EQUIV or NAME to name the meta-information, but CONTENT must be
used in both cases. By using HTTP-EQUIV, a server should use the name
indicated as a header, with the specified CONTENT as its value. For
example, 

<META HTTP-EQUIV="Expires" CONTENT="Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT">
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Keywords" CONTENT="Nanotechnology, Biochemistry">
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Reply-to" CONTENT="dsr@w3.org (Dave Raggett)">

The server should include the following response headers when the
document is requested: 

Expires: Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT
Keywords: Nanotechnology, Biochemistry
Reply-to: dsr@w3.org (Dave Raggett)

Popular uses for META include: 

<META NAME="generator" CONTENT="Some program"> 
     This indicates the program used to generate this document. It is
often the name of the HTML editor used.
 
<META NAME="author" CONTENT="Name"> 
     This indicates the name of the author. 

<META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="keyword keyword keyword"> 
     Provides keywords for search engines such as Infoseek or Alta
Vista.
 These are added to the keywords found in the document itself. If you
insert a keyword more than seven times here, the whole tag will be
ignored! 

<META NAME="description" CONTENT="This is a site"> 
     Search engines which support the above tag will now display the
text you specify here, rather than the first few lines of text from the
actual document when the document shows up in a search result. You have
about 1,000 characters for your description, but not all these will be
used. 

<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="n; URL=http://foo.bar/"> 
     This is a so-called "meta refresh", which on certain browsers
causes the document mentioned in the URL to be loaded after n seconds.
This can be used for slide shows or for often-changing information, but
has some drawbacks. In particular, if you use a value of zero seconds,
the user can no longer go "Back" with his back button. He will be
transferred to the specified URL, and when he presses "back" there, he
will go back to the document with the refresh, which immediately
redirects him to the document he tried to get away from.

<META HTTP-EQUIV="expires" CONTENT="Tue, 20 Aug 1996 14:25:27 GMT"> 
     This indicates that the document containing this META tag will
expire at this date. If the document is requested after this date, the
browser should load a new copy from the server, instead of using the
copy in its cache. 

Notes:

     Not all servers use the information from META tags to generate
headers, although some browsers will treat what they find in here like
it was a header. 
     The "keywords" and "description" values are currently only used by
Alta Vista and Infoseek.

Is there a formula we use to find the 100-diameter limit of a star?

I finally decided the following for my game:

Military ships run approximately 1MCr/ton.

Civilian ships run roughly 20-40KCr/ton.

They can use roughly 80% of their space for mission payload for a J1 ship,
and about 60% for a J3, so a J1 civilian ship costs about 25KCr/ton of
cargo or passengers.  Since I assume 50% capacity, and 25 jumps a year, and
a minimal revenue of 10% of cost per year, one only need get a return of
200CR/jump/ton of cargo for break even.

This also makes star travel far cheaper, which was part of why I did this.

(To implement this, you need to decide what gets cheaper.  Since the
current system involves about a third of the cost of a ship being jump
drive, and another third being power plant and maneuver drives, all of
these need to drop in price substantially.)

I fully agree.

My view, and why I am trying to clean up most of those, is that it should
be unusual to land on a world that exports food, but that also has a
tainted atmosphere, or where a billion people live on a size one world, or
a system with a size zero mainworld, when there is a habitable planet nearby.

All of these are great adventure fodder, and you will see them in 11,000
systems, but you should not see them in one system in three or four.  The
current sysgen rules produce some know interesting bits, but the first
survey reduction made a few areas a lot worse, such that I end up spending
more time explaining away data flaws than coming up with goodies.
Fortunately, this can and will be fixed.

Actually... not really.  A "labrys" is a double-bladed axehead; it was
particualrly common as a design motif (in masonry) in the Minoan
civilization (and is the source of the term "labyrinth", I\'m told.)
Somehow or another it was also associated with the Amazons in later Greek
literature.  Nowadays it\'s been "reclaimed" and is a pretty popular
jewelry/T-shirt/tattoo/whatever design among womon-identified womyn.  And
anyone else trying to score some of that chic/make a buck of that market.

The Sayat LABRYS is just a TL-12 laser rifle.  Tries to be Sayatish in
style (long range, low ROF, lightweight, great batteries).  But, like I
said, yawn.

   Making the task duration for N tries equal to 4^(N-1) days is a pretty
   hefty increase.  The `N^2 days\' duration I mentioned earlier is more
   realistic.  Keep in mind that the `N^2 days\' convention is not some
   game rule that I made up; it is a real-life law of nature used by us
   physicists when we schedule time on atom smashers and telescopes.

   This is an interesting thesis, but I have a few problems with what you
   said.  300k years ago we had already come out of the forests.  Homo
   erectus shows all the adaptations of savanna-dwelling runners from
   1.5M years or so, IIRC.  Early Homo sapiens had evolved by 700k years
   ago.  Human brains 300k years ago were not so much smaller than ours;
   it is quite conceivable that they were constructing legends by that
   time.  (Of course, it\'s also conceivable that they were not.)
   
   It does seem rather implausible, though, that an oral tradition could
   survive for that long in any definitive form.  You have a point there.

made my thoughts very clear and feel the need to try one more time. Sorry.

I think that it all comes down to the point of view of exactly when the game
is set. My comments come from the point of view of the first few decades of
the Third Imperrium when contact between worlds out side of Core sector is
VERY rare ( again clouded by my own perception of the Long Night ). From
this point of view the number of High Level starports (most capable of
construction), not Contacted, low tech ports as you descrbe, is the problem.
I agree that once a world has even occational contact with freetraders and
such, that facilities like you describe will be available, but what about
world that haven\'t seen a ship in hundreds of years?

Granted a modern airport can easily handle a Trav starship, but there will
be no maintanence facilities IN PLACE, nor beacons etc. until AFTER Contact
is made. Lower tech worlds are even less likely to have facilities standing
around until AFTER contact (unless they are preserved RELICS from the Firts
or Second Imperiums).

The Data, as presented in M0 (or First Survey) is more like data from a TNE
point of view, Not 2000 years of lost contact, but a couple of hundred.
Glancing through Illelish Sector shows that most world Starports and Tech
Levels rate very close to those found in the Core subsector, yet Illelish
was still 22% unContacted in year 200. That, to me, makes the data a bit
skewwed to the high side for an early M0 setting. Why didn\'t all those
planets with A starports come and meet the Imperium? And why did
interstellar trade stop, or nearly so, if so high a percentage could still
produce, repair, and support star ship?

I thisnk how the data needs to be changed, (and how I am attemting to do it
for my universe) is that the further from the seats of resurging
civilization (Viland, Sylea, Old Earth Union, Aslan, Sowrd Worlds, etc.) the
lower the number of medium to high tech worlds, and the (greatly) lessened
chance that starport facilities exist. Naturally as these worlds are
re-Contacted, more and more \'ports and higher tech levels will develope.

I think a sliding scale based somewhat on the Imperal Expansion charts from
M0 are what I\'m really driving at. With the occational Pocket Empire and
Barbarian Kingdom thrown in for fun.

Of course this is all in my own, very humble opinion and can readily be
disregarded as foolish babble ;> ( my wife says I tend to do that far too
much since getting re-involved with Traveller, she gets really annoyed when
I wake her up in the middle of the night to show here a new FFS starship
spread sheet, I just don\'t understand her!)

   You raise an interesting point.  The situation relative to interstellar
contact (or lack thereof) is different in different eras.  While it would
make perfect sense that worlds with a \'X\' starport are interdicted if we are
talking about M:1100, it is a much fuzzier issue when you are talking about
M:0, or even M:1200.  In fact in the latter case many worlds have had their
starports and spaceports destroyed and never rebuilt.

   Same goes for worlds that have starports in excess of their
technology--easy to justify in M:1100 and M:1200, much more dificult to
justify in M:0 and impossible to justify when you go back even further to
the era when there was genuine "uninhabited" regions (in quotes because the
native non-starfaring, non-human populations may object to not being counted
:-)  ).

   Ultimately there may need to be seperate rules for generating worlds in
each era as was done with M:1200 (actually the "seperate rules" for creating
subsectors in TNE consisted of the standard subsector generation sequence
which yielded a nice healthy, civilized subsector which you then "collapsed"
using the Collapse Determination sequence).  I would like to see things be a
universal as possible however, since it will make reading the data easier
(and less complex).

If this turns into an extensive discussion, yes, it should go
to trav-tech, but a bit more on the general lists won\'t hurt (I hope 8-)

Liquid-core NTRs are not as simple as people make them out to be.
I do not believe that a liquid-core engine or advanced gas core
engine will be practical in the next 15 years.  If you play
the traveller tech level game you get fusion before the more
advanced NTRs come into feasibility.  Alternate technology
proposals are interesting but not terribly game-efficient
(you should see the extra info in the early versions of the
new rockets table!  8-)

>(My personal beef with the table - which I didn\'t change - is that the
>TL-8 rockets are actually allmost all 1970s things like SSME and RD-180,

Yeah, this never really settled out to everyone\'s satisfaction.
The logic behind my selection was that while those engines were
prototyped in the 70s, they really weren\'t operational until
the mid-1980s, so they were placed at the point they became
practical rather than earliest possibly available.  
Several of the other group members didn\'t like that.
I would be happy to discuss the details (and provide
anyone with the earlier working versions of the tables,
for the serious gearheads) on more appropriate lists
as I have time available.

  Sorry, your calculations are correct. However, wouldn\'t the cargo
insurance charge be the problem of the owner of the goods (whether
that be the party at either pick-up or delivery end)? In that case,
the carrier may not be liable short of a court case.

  For spec cargos, a trader would still want third party insurance.

  FWIW, even a 0.1% chance of a ship-stealing piracy event seems high,
or most small ships would be stolen before their 40-year nominal life
was over.

Do a subby... with the Andy Akins spreadsheet, you\'ll get some interesting
results..

Some suggestions for future THUDDDS:

Luxury Liner, ala The King Richard of FASA fame

Very low tech in-system hauler.

Survey scout.

We might also consider placing budget limits and stricter performance
requirements..  so far, there has been an element of free spending which
leads to many designs showing a "gold-plated" aspect that only a Pentagon
procurement officer could love.

  The canonical Cr 1000 per jump can reasonably be assumed to allow
some sort of premium for longer-jumps/faster deliveries.

  A ship this size may also want its own TL 11/12 cargo handling kit;
the staff can double as security guards. Maintenance lay-ups can also
be minimized by having an extra warm body or two (/guards) doing pull
and replace operations, etc.

  Odd question for the economists/accountants out there - if the corp
finances its own ships from capital, how would the return on the total
investment work out? I guesstimate max revenue (see below) of ~MCr 80,
less 5-8 MCr ship-specific outlay, for approx. MCr 75 net, or around
9%, before reinvestment/depreciation, and dividends, and less lost
(partial) interest earnings for the ship construction period.

>if you assume less than 100% utilization and more trips per year (IMO a

  IIRC, compelling arguments have been made for the two-week period
being for spec traders. The ten day period makes a good guideline
for optimized scheduled runs.

  These space-cows produce 120 (HG) EP\'s. Two for c-4, 30 for Agility
one, and 88 for lots of safety lights? Or twenty-something triple beam
turrets and possibly a comp 5? This means external pirates and small
warships can go <beep> themselves, or just die. Gunnery crew (HG) is a
bit over one or two per battery. IN subsidies for upgraded (fib?) comps
for use as wartime auxiliaries may exist.

>   close to MCr60 per year, but they only net about MCr10. 

  If they run to tight schedules - no on-site speculation, just booked
priority cargo and passengers in a hurry, then ten-day turnaround is a
good thing, and reasonable (~"economics drives [most] things"). This
roughly changes things to 80 MCr gross, and close to MCr 30 net, even
with over-rated operations costs; ~4% is much more believable. Ground
facility charges are separate, but integral brokerage services and
contract service providers should minimize payouts. In fact, these may
run at a small profit while covering charges that are effectively
invisible in the game (to prevent it from becoming "cost-accountancy
in sp-a-a-ce...").

>2) Does Al Morai\'s four _Gazelles_ protect all the competition as well

  How about if the Gazelles are the in-house trouble-shooting vessels
for the company, or are available for really hot priority small packages.
The company has a clear interest in ensuring compliance to internal
security by its own staff, and to provide security against hostile ops.
Again, as CE\'s, IN subsidy for purchase (from the IN, obviously) may exist.

BTW, if anyone has a spare copy of _Spinward Marches Campaign_, I\'d
be very interested in purchasing it or trading.

Salutations. Some of you may remember the UK magazine, Arcane?

Issue #14 (December 1996) featured a top fifty Roleplaying Games of
all times article. This was voted for by the readership of Arcane, who
sent the magazine their top ten nominations. The numbers were then
added up to form a top fifty.

As a reminder, the top ten were as follows:

10  CYBERPUNK 2020
09  STAR WARS
08  SHADOWRUN
07  PARANOIA
06  VAMPIRE : THE MASQUERADE
05  RUNEQUEST
04  WARHAMMER FANTASY ROLEPLAY
03  TRAVELLER
02  ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
01  CALL OF CTHULHU


I\'m curious to see how the top fifty would be affected by the new
games, new editions et cetera introduced in the past year or so, and so
I\'m (possibly rather foolishly... :)  ) conducting a survey...



The Top Fifty Roleplaying Games Of All Time Survey (TOP50)
==========================================================

Purpose :   To determine the top fifty roleplaying games of all time,
			as voted for by the subscribers of rec.games.frp.misc.


Method  :   E-mail your top ten RPGs (with number 1 your absolute
			favourite, all the way down to ten, your \'least favourite\'
			favourite (er... does that make sense? :)  )


Scoring :   Position        Points
               10             01
               09             02
               08             03
               07             04
               06             05
               05             06
               04             07
               03             08
               02             09
               01             10

            The RPGs will then be fitted into the top fifty according
            to the points they garner, with the top (#1) RPG being the
            one with the most points, the fiftieth being the one with
            the least points and so on.


Voting  :   Please send your votes to TOP50@magus.powernet.co.uk.

			You can do a quick response by replying to this mail, as it has
            a \'voting form\' somewhere around here somewhere...

			Alternatively, you can go so far as to send me a \'new\' mail. 

            I\'ll need to know your name and e-mail address* (just to
            make sure as much as possible that no vote-rigging occurs
            :) ) and your list of top ten RPGs. If you only have an
            opinion on some, just vote for the ones you know.

            The closing date for voting will be Wednesday, December 31
            1997.


Results :   The results will be posted to rec.games.frp.misc on or
            around Sunday, January 3rd 1998.


Rules   :   1) One entry per person only.

            2) Any roleplaying game released in 1997 or previously,
               whether or not currently in print, may be voted for. 

            3) Games with multiple editions will be considered a single
               game, i.e. votes for Vampire and Vampire : Second
               Edition will be considered votes for Vampire.


VOTING FORM 

If you like you can simply reply to this e-mail, using the rough \'form\'
below:


=======================================================================
Your Name           :

Your e-mail address :

=======================================================================

TOP TEN:

   09         02
   10         01
========    ====== ====================================================

         
I\'d be grateful if you would participate in my survey. Aside from a bit of
thinking time to select your top ten (if you haven\'t already done so long 
ago :)
) it should not take long.

I know that \'best\' is an awfully subjective term, and that it is largely a
matter of personal taste, but I\'m keen to see whether with a large enough 
number
of voters we can perhaps see if there is a consensus out there on some of 
the
best...

I\'d like to thank you (in advance) for your assistance. If you have any
questions, comments, suggestions or criticisms please feel free to e-mail 
me. 



Thanks very much!

I\'m a new TML member, and this is my first post... so be kind.  :o)

Let\'s say my Free Trader jumps into a system and proceeds to the main
world starport (up or down).  Obviously there must be approach
procedures, \'inbound\' and \'outbound\' lanes, communication protocols, and
traffic control.  Can anyone give me pointers to info on this?

Once docked, there must be more red tape, inspections, paperwork
(electronic, I\'d assume), and fees.  Any info on this as well?

On an unrelated topic:  is there any good reason why the Imperium has
physical currency?  Why would electronic funds transfers NOT be
universal?  Is this simply an artifact of the age of the Traveller game?

Lastly: The way computers are handled in the Traveller game is obviously
dated, coming from the mainframe mindset.  Does anyone have better
background info on how to run computers in Traveller?  Here\'s an example
of the kind of thing I\'m talking about:  Joe PC has Navigation 2.  Joe\'s
computer has a Nav program that gives it the equivalent of Nav 2.  Does
Joe\'s Nav tasks get the advantage of Nav 2?  Does the computer need Joe
at all to use the Nav 2 skill?  Perspiring Readers want to know.

Rather than vary the task difficulty, have the randomness tell the referee
how long it would take to notice whatever the players are looking for?  The
more patient they are, the more they will see.  Greater range and camoflage
would increase required time, better equipment and skill would lower it.

For time-critical situations (eg. starship combat), we could still have a
task roll to notice something _within a turn_.


Would this be workable?

Funny you should ask.  I\'ve just recently rejoined this list after
relocating, and have been working on a suite of programs for
sector/system/world editing.  I\'m using a cross platform set of
libraries which allow me to move the source to several other OSes
(or what passes for an OS....).  I have a completed sector viewer
(with the exception of printing under windows), and am working on 
a system generator/editor (looking like these will be split into
two programs.....).  I also text only version of something which
makes WBH data (pretty rough, my first c++ program), which I hope
to move to a more GUI front end (how, I don\'t know yet).

I haven\'t done anything about trying to get it out yet because of
the GNU liscensing and my current library scheme (which is pretty
hideous), and I really don\'t have good ftp/http location to put it
up at (any offers? :)

> Thanks.

The Ferret class advanced scout is a BAMTech design concept study for a 
 replacement for the standard scout/courier, optimized for exploration -
 with an extremely advanced sensor suite, centered around a P1350S science
 array, capable of resolving human-sized targets at ranges of 100,000km or
 mapping the surface of a planet at the 1km level from 1 AU away.
 The ship also has a secondary military intelligence gathering roll, with
 a MidNite black hull coating and advanced IR masking; the same sensor
 suite allows it to detect powered-down military targets at a range of
 several million km.

Much of the cost of the ship is its sensor suite. Courier and military
 versions often delete the neutrino sensor and the science optimization on
 the main sensor array, reducing the cost by MCr 100 and freeing up an 
 additional 1 MW for weaponry.

The scout is also designed for long-endurance operations, with closed-
 cycle air and water recycling and 16 weeks of carried food supplies.

If the advanced scout is in common useage, Scout characters can obtain one
 in place of a regular type S (when awarded on mustering out) on a roll of
 10+, +1 for Pilot 3+. Such ships usually have the reduced sensor capability;
 roll 10+ again, +1 for Sensor 3+, to retain the full sensor suite.

Note that I was making the task one level easier on each successive
iteration - which (roughly for T4, precisely for TNE) doubles your
chance of success. Doubling your chance of success requires (2)^2=4
times as much time for each successive iteration. (Although, on mature
consideration (and some checks on my latest Keck exoplanet models) I think
the first attempt for GG planets should be ~2 hours, not ~1 day.)

Physicists don\'t schedule time on telescopes. Astronomers do. I\'m perfectly
well aware of how signal-to-noise scales in a background-noise limited;
it\'s less clear how to model that in T4\'s weird task system.

This isn\'t going to be of much help, but....

Way back in \'92 or \'93 there was a program being developed for Linux that
had something to do with RPGs, but I think it was D&D related.  You can
probably find it on tsx-11.mit.edu or sunsite.unc.edu I think it would be
in the games section, but who knows.  It\'s been years, but it\'s probably
still on one of those two sites, stuff from that era always ended up on one
of those two if not both.

I think Joe Heck has something on his web page that you can compile.  Look
for SYSGEN it\'s a MegaTraveller era system generator based on the old DGP
World book.  I\'ve compiled it on the Mac, don\'t know if I ever compiled it
on Linux.

Grab Executor (the Mac Emulator), and you can run CSC, and maybe a few
other Mac programs.  Some of the _OLD_ PC stuff might run in the Dos
Emulator.

For tasks like detecting a planet sized object it might make more sense to
do it with a table.  Guidelines about times and distances would be good
too, that way GM\'s can "adjust" the effort needed to make detections to the
needs of the game.

	Yeah... one of the reasons I haven\'t been doing any energy weapons
is, aside from the lower humor potential (at least I thought so until the

As to what type of stone what ever makes up Goat Island off the california
coast. I am not clsoe tobe any type of geolgist.<G>
The !6 inch naval rifle\'s semi armor piercing projo will penetrate over ten
meters of ground/soil(earth, stone etc.) before detonating. The Armor
piercing projo from a 16 inch will penetrate more than 20 meters of soil
before detonating.

But will the AF talk about the nuke called "Davy Crocket" our version of
the polish nuclear handgrenade. It was nuke tipped bazooka that the firer
could not get out of the primary blast radii. It was may undertanding that
the USSR had some interesting warheads for NORAD to get down to the roots
so to speak.

AS for what CSC means by stone well it could be sandstone or limestone not
always granite.

Well in that case I would suggest ME rather than T4. But by the same token
the IS types find fault with ENIAC sized computers that FFS2 uses.

Little is described in the official rules.  I settle it by using what I
remember from pilot classes, with the wretched airspace near LAX modelling
a typical class B, and the friendly open skies of the great plains as the
approach to the average class D.

Much of the paperwork is still going to be physical in the early Imperium,
as computer systems should not yet be screamingly compatible.  Later in the
Imperial era, the Imperium\'s military contracts are large enough to wag the
corporate dogs, and so there ends up a lot more consistency.

Electronic funds transfers require electronic speeds.  This makes perfect
sense on one world, but makes less sense across multiple worlds.
Especially since Traveller has always had a (imho far to significant) tech
level spread, this means that if the currency is the product of the highest
tech worlds, they only have to watch for counterfeiters at similar places.
Lower tech worlds cannot comprehend the stuff, let alone fake it.

Given the one week per jump feature of the system, I suspect EFTs will not
become popular.  I do play that they are used regularly on single worlds,
just not when travelling.

>Lastly: The way computers are handled in the Traveller game is obviously
>dated, coming from the mainframe mindset.

I am now thinking that they might be closer than I first thought.  I do
tend to underemphasize just what people are doing with all of that
computing power, but having recently had the pleasure of looking at the
control systems for a large oil refinery, I now am ok with the size of the
traveller computers.  Embedded controls systems are just huge.  Admittedly,
the actual board doing the computation is the size of a small book, but the
garbage hanging off of it is monstrous, and seems to get larger as the tech
gets better.

The computer is a decent expert system that can handle everyday tasks.  I
have my game set up so that a rather unimaginative level one computer is
pretty easy to find.  Anything worth doing, though, is done with the aid
and assistance of a level 2 or higher person, who can use the level one
machine to sweat the small stuff, while they look for anomalies.

Along the same lines, I play that when a person is bereft of the computer
support they usually use, they may lose up to a level of skill, because
they are now being hit with details they usually can ignore.  People who
routinely play their characters as doing things cautiously do not suffer
from this negative, as they are assumed to do back of the envelope
calculations as a matter of course, but this kind of person tends to be
rather slow.

I\'d go for that but that is because I\'ll have to adopt the figures to my
own task system which is far easier this way. As most of you probably use
T4 I\'d say my vote doesn\'t really count.

Isn\'t there some error here?
Each +0.5 equals x10 surface area or signature decreases as range squared
and thus the table should be like this:

BTW Couldn\'t we just calculate this based on surface area of a typical
gasgiant with illumination from Luminosity = 1 star at say 5 AU, then
adding a modifier for integration time?

Speak for yourself!:)  WhizzoDyne Propulsion\'s entry for THUDDD7 was the

This would mean that the Earth\'s orbit would be just over the surface of
the Sun. Not good. B-)

(The diameter of the Sun is 6,96E8 metres, that is about 700 000 km. IIRC
the main sequence stars are all about the same size. Can\'t confirm that,
though)

     Thank you, when I reread it I realized I\'d badly Goofed the timeframe
for Human evolution.  Something about doing it at three in the morning to get
the idea up on the screen STS.  Thanks for catching and correcting me on
this, ;)

     Well about the time of the Final War the early Vilani retreated to
REMOTE Mountain Valleys and stayed in them for hundreds of thousands of
years.  By necessity BTW, the Ancients left a BUNCH of nasty TL21+ war
machines behind to fight out the rest of the conflict for the rest of that
time.  So I suppose it\'s remotely possible that the Vilani invented writting
at some point and started putting those legends down on paper...  But writing
is SUCH a POWERFUL CATALYST that I really don\'t want it to have happened that
way.
     Still, I\'m at a loss to explain the survival of such legends through
290,000+ years of oral transmission.  Heck even a century or two can distort
a known and recorded in writting incident beyond all recognition when passed
down that way.  Either V&V is wrong... or we\'ve got some Very Interesting
explainations in store for us. ;)

How about a table that lists time to have a X in Y chance of detecting
what\'s there. On second thought, make that X in Y chance of *not* detecting.

That way you could have something like this:

???	1 in 6
???	1 in 36
???	1 in 216

There\'s a method to my madness. Say the players look for something for
the first period. You roll a die where they can\'t see it (if there\'s
nothing to find, this is just window dressing). If they keep trying,
when they hit the next break point, you roll *one* more die. And add
the result from the last time (which, we assume will be one). Or in
actuality, you just roll one die, and if it comes up 1, they missed
again.

This *is* realistic, as the "rolls" *do* add that way! The first
failure put them in the tail of the curve, subsequent rolls just move
them farther out.

Just consider that a high CO2 content is deadly, and thus counts as a
taint, but is easily handled by filtermasks, and wouldn\'t bother
planets at all. In fact the plants would love it.

There are some places in Africa where volcanic CO2 seeps to the surface
and accumulates in depressions in the terrain. The plants grow quite
nicely. Especially considering all the fertilizer they get from animals
that wander in and die.

I\'d say that "excess CO2" as a taint *should* be pretty common. It fits
in nicely with the way we know planetary atmospheres work. And it has
some easy consequences. Such as either the local animal life is adapted
to it, or there\'s very little local animal life. In the later case it\'s
a "temporary" situation. In a few millenia, the CO2 level will go down
due to the work of the plants.

There were some subsectors in a few adventures (for example the FASA
"Sky Raiders" stuff) that were never given an official position in the
sector. I may have picked a bad example, now that I think about it. I
think someone said that the FASA subsectors *were* given locations
later. But I still suspect that there are similar cases.

Hi,

	You can get Traveller and BITS stuff from the following stores in London...

	Leisure Games
	91 Ballards Lane
	Finchley

	Call them on 0181-346-2327. They\'re not open on Sundays. Nearest Tube is
Finchley Central. Turn right after getting to the main road, and it\'s just
five minutes walk away.

	Also,

	Orc\'s Nest
	6 Earlham St
	London

	They sell Traveller stuff too. Earlham Street is at Cambridge Circus,
junction of Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road, so isn\'t difficult
to find. Nearest Tube is Leicester Square and Tottenham Court Road. You can
call them on 0171-379-4254.

	Also,

	The Virgin Megastore in Oxford Street, corner of Oxford Street and
Tottenham Court Road sell IG stuff. Nearest Tube is also Tottenham Court
Road. You can call them on 0171-580-5822.

	And if you have trouble getting around or have trouble finding these
places, call me on the number below, as I work near the latter two mentioned.

	Good luck!


	See ya...

These "legends" and "oral traditions" needn\'t actually date from the period
~-200k.y.a., they just need to be _attributed_ to that period.  Maybe they
actually grew up at certain point(s) in later Vilani civilization,
reflecting ambivalence about technologically-induced changes in society, as
colored by archeological understanding of the Ancients, etc., etc.?

It\'s an interesting idea. One problem with it is that there isn\'t a 
good mechanism for varying degrees of success in the current skill system
(aside from "spectacular success", which in the last T4 version I saw was
independent of the skill level of the operator...); if you just use task
rolls all you can have is something like 
spectacular success = integration time reduced by 1/2
success=normal integration time
failure=double integration time

which is again sort of coarse. Still, it\'s not a bad idea (functionally
very similar to what Anders likes, with skill roll modifying sensor
sensitivity...)

I think I\'d like to leave the starship-detecting part mostly unchanged...

Good question. I was certainly visualizing sensor skill, but as you say,
maybe astrogation or science/astronomy are more relevant. Is there an official
T4 or T4.1 mechanism for tasks using different skills together?

Nope. It\'s a (sensor diameter)^4 task - sensitivity goes up as collecting
area (obviously) but also as the resolution, because the higher your 
resolution the less background light is "mixed in" with the (faint) 
planetary target. (There are additional factors because a bigger sensor 
collects more background light too, but also because the scattered light from
the primary star is less scattered with a bigger sensor, and because the
farther away the star is the closer the planet is projected to the star
and hence the worst the scattered light is. It\'s fairly complicated and 
should really be a different max range scaling with area for inner/habitable/
outer planets, and depends on the layout of the sensor, etc. I cheated and
just took a simulation our group did for ground-based detection of outer
gas giants with the Keck, back-of-the-envelope removed the atmosphere, 
and settled on D^4 as a rough approximation to the real scaling.)
(For the earth-sized detections I also cheated, and just took the 
baseline NASA "Terrestrial Planet Finder" spacecraft and matched it to the
closest Traveller sensor.)

>BTW Couldn\'t we just calculate this based on surface area of a typical

The sensitivity is sharply limited by scattered light from the primary star
(even for short ranges and big sensors and 20 AU gas giants), so you can\'t just
use the "free space" sensor rules.

Is there any effort on the part of the THUDD group to have follow up 
posting of any deckplans for the submitted designs, especially the 
winners?  

We have some very skilled deckplan designers (I\'d love to learn how they 
do it, hint, hint).  Do you think that perhaps they could be enticed to 
submit some deckplans....?

I appreciate Rob\'s comments here, and his attitude.  Many of us ARE 
laymen, though, and I for one appreciate the insight of those who do 
this stuff [various subject matters] for a living.  One of the things 
that amazes me is the diversity of the group on this list.  

I\'ve been out of traveller for almost 15 years, having only played CT 
for a couple of years.

During that time, I\'ve been in the Marine Corps, (floated with an 
infantry landing team, done airborne training/platoon time, worked 
maintenance, been the Logistics officer for battalions and brigades), 
but missed going Desert Storm (Drat the luck!), and been a security 
officer (all the classified top secret stuff) for about 5 years.

I am learning all the time, and am intrigued by the learned and 
experienced people playing traveller.  I\'d appreciate (and maybe some 
others would too) a little background information on people.  Not a huge 
bragging opportunity, but just a few words about your areas of 
expertise....  

We have some real experts in our midst!

I\'m happy with the sub. merchant idea (What? No overpowered monsters for

  The simple formula is to find the local sun\'s radius in Stellar Radii
(Earth\'s sun == 1) and use that number of A.U. as the 100-diameter
boundary.  A table of basic Stellar Radii can be found in the Classic
Traveller Book 6: Scouts. I\'ve repeated it here (view in a monospace
font):


             Stellar Radii (Sol == 1)

  (following the recent discussions here, I would normally put a
copyright notice here for the table. However, I suspect that the
data could be found in a decent Astrophysics text...)

  Parts of this table are likely to drive certain astronomers on
this list nuts :)
  Type VI stars were dropped from Traveller\'s sector data and
generation tables when several people mentioned loudly that such
stars are vanishingly rare in local galactic space.

  While not exact, the conversion of Stellar Radii to Safe Jump
Distance in AU is close enough, and gives a low math solution to
the "problem". It also gives, in easy tabular form, a feel for
just how deep the no-jump wells can be for the big stars. By way
of example, Pluto averages in Traveller terms a distance of
some 38 AU out (39.5 AU average in real life)...

  Check the TML archive for the past two or three weeks. Buried in all of
his carryings-on, Leroy Guatney posted a longish bit on calculating the
100-diameter boundary of a star based on diameter and density of the
star. If you happen to be a collecter of old Traveller material, much
of the same article appeared in one of the last JTAS\' before GDW switched
to the name Challenge.

  That help?

Let\'s not forget the real names behind the acronyms: MegaTraveller, Marc
Miller\'s Traveller, etc. Someone \'unknowledgeable\' might want to search for
these words, too...

Also, keywords should contain the longest reasonable string representation
of the word (probably pluralis): Characters, Sectors, Starships, etc. That
way, both a search for i.e. \'sector\' and \'sectors\' would return the
appropriate page, whereas if the keyword was \'sector\' only a search for
\'sector\' would return true.

What about cases? I\'m not sure how case-sensitive search engines are, but
just to be sure, I\'ve written most of my keywords in all lower-case.

If we could get such a standard working, it could prove a very valuable
tool!

sent it directly to him, but I see others doing it on-list.  What\'s the
proper way, Robert?

Yes, definitely.

Yes on this too...all us Perl hackers will thank you. :)

Great idea!  I\'ve already updated the main THUDDD page to have
\'TravellerRPG\' and \'Starships\' in its \'keywords\' meta, and I encourage all
other Trav web folk to do the same.

Interesting...I\'m just worried there\'d be little room for design
differentiation.  Big engines, cargo pods, minimal crew section...what
would allow one ship to stand out relative to another?

That was already on my mind for THUDDD 10, next May.

Well, in the case of Imperial warships, I think this is justified -- the
Imperium *does* have deep pockets, and the IN is in part a mobile showcase
for Imperial technology.  However, on other THUDDD contests (the free
trader, the low-tech SDB) price has been a definite limitation.  So also
will it be with the Subsidized Merchant we\'ll be doing next.

	"Rostoker, Monkhorst and Binderbauer instead propose a colliding

[techhead explanation]
Remember the aneutronic B11-p fusion reaction everyone goes "oooo" over
but needs 100x the ignition temp*pressure figure of merit that the other
fusion reactions do?  Well, if you use colliding beams from particle
acellerators, you can easily push past that energy barrier (plenty of
effective KE in a beam...).  Using pulsed beams and reverse
synchrotrons (if I\'m reading it right) operating in the beam off-phase
to capture the charged particles coming off the fusion reactions and
directly convert their energy to electrical power.  

Can also be used as a low thrust fusion rocket, if you pull the
power generator off one end of the reaction chamber...

Not quite traveller\'s fusion, but it looks like TL9 fusion may be
possible after all ;-)

I know that the latest Linux Kernals have support for running Java apps.
Apparently it\'s able to run them as if they were native applications.  I\'m
really not up on anything dealing with Java, as I tend to avoid it.
Although for this kind of stuff it can definitly be a good thing.

	If I recall correctly, it wouldn\'t be built in ANY Traveller
universe, from an economical standpoint. Certainly not doing
straight freight runs. Speculative trading has always been the
only way to make small vessels work ... which I\'m will to bet was
quite intentional on Marc\'s part. Hauling freight for Cr1,000 per

	Certainly. They\'re human beings of the gender without protruding
primary sexual characteristics, who object to the white
protestant patriarchal slaveholding repressive unnatural society,
and the domination of language implicit in referring to them as
"woMEN" as the inclusion of three letters designating the evil
sex clearly declares to the world their inferior status, and
hence have chosen to liberate themselves from the aforementioned
WPPShRUS by freeing their designation from that slave collar. The
proper singular noun to refer to a human being of the gender
without PPSC is womon, and the plural is womyn.

	Is that clear enough english? <G>

   Now the question becomes, does he *deserve* payment after laying the
eggs he laid?  The answer in the end is \'yes\'.  It is not the
responsibility of Mr. Perrin to publish worthwhile material, it is the
responsibility of Imperium Games.  I don\'t blame him a bit for being
bitter.  If someone promised you US$5,000 and wouldn\'t pay up, you\'d be
pissed too.  The paying (or refusal to pay despite contracts) of
professional freelancers has been one of my soapbox issues for a while
now, and this appears to be another case where a freelancer is getting
ripped off.

Actually, it turns out that in cultures that rely on oral history,
incidents *do* get passed on pretty faithfully. They did some research
in the Pacific and found that the tribal tales of volcanic eruptions
and the like could be confirmed for at least 300 years back. 

It\'s when writing comes in that folks start getting careless with the

Interesting idea.  I know this is asked about once a week on the TML, but
I can\'t find the info -- when in canon history does the increase to TL-13
occur?  I\'m picturing a small warship, circa 1000 dt, built late in M:0 as
a technology demonstrator for emerging TL-13 equipment...sort of the
Kinunir of its time.  Maybe we\'ll do this next late spring or summer.

I think that\'s a great idea.  Some past THUDDD entries have already
included links to deckplans and exterior views hosted at other sites
(those of the authors).  Owing to space constraints, I can\'t host graphics
at the THUDDD site, but I\'d be more than happy to install links to any
central deckplan sites others might want to create (and also will continue
to support in-entry links to deckplans, as mentioned above).

"womon-identified womyn" probably refers to a woman who is (a) placing a high priority on distancing herself from the male gender, (b) more interested in associating with other women, and (c) quite possibly a lesbian separatist.
 
Seriously.  
 
<shrug>  There is a strong dialogue within the women\'s movement, and particularly among lesbian women, about the relationship between language and identity politics.  And trying to simplify it down to a phrase can make it seem either inaccessable or just silly (either of which would be inaccurate, but, hey....).

I don\'t know about 290,000 years, but 20,000 is very possible.  I had an
archeology professor who did work in Pakistan.  He dug up these oddly
patterned triangular stones from early Neolithic settlements (~ 20 K BP). 
They were always set up in the center of the settlements, on a special
altar. 

However, he knew nothing of what the stones were used for.  Then, one day
while he was excavating the pieces of one of these stones one of the
locals walked up, pointed his rifle at my professor and demanded to know
why he had broken one of the sacred stones.  My professor explained that
this stone was thousands of years old, the local became very excited and
rushed back to show my prof the stone they had in the center of their
village, on the same type of altar.  20,000 years, same stones, set up in
the same way.  290,000 may be a bit long, but maybe not... 

Happy Thanksgiving all-

data includes too many high quality starports.

I disagree.  I think that what we are missing in starport data
information is data on the size and volume of the starports.

Lets take the example of Vland.  Vilani and Vargr says (pg 21) "Vland,
our homeworld, plumeted from a high of TL 12 around -1800 all the way to
the brink of low TL 9 by about -1550.  Jump capable ships were seen as
needless waste, with little promise of profit.  Occasional interstellar
trade was done, but the total journeys leaving Vland numbered in the
dozens per year.  Only the most shrewd starship operators could scratch
out a living from offworld trade during those bleak times."

Notice that this data does not say that the starports were bombed during
the rebellion, the starports were destroyed by Virus, we destroyed the
starports because they reminded us of the bad things out there, etc or
any of the things that happened in The New Era.  All it says is that
there was not much _money_ in it.

Somewhere on Vland someone was making some money building, repairing,
and catering to starships the whole time.  All that is needed for an A
starport is for these people, and their niche business to be located at
or near a good airport.  I think that in Milieu 0 the number of A ports
reflects this reality.  Remember that in Vilani society it was
traditional for learning to be by apprenticeship so this business could
continue to have an adequate supply of adequately trained (although I am
reluctant to use that word for Vilani) workers.

Citizens of the Imperium 1100 years later might be startled by how small
and low in traffict the starports of Millieu 0 were but they would not
be startled to see them or expect different ammenities.  Surprised that
Vland was generating only the volume of trafic that in Milieu 1100 would
be typical of a D port on a poor planet jump 4 from anything perhaps,
but that would not be reflected in the starport type.  I thnk that in
Milieu 0 most planets should have at least a D port, as someone pointed
out the ancient Egyptians (low TL 1) could almost have managed a D port.

Cleon is just trying to make the spacelanes safe enough for trafic that
high volume, routine, traffic, in non luxury goods can return.  (So he
can tax it & rule it ....

Roger, note that my Jump-0 point (JTAS#22) was a 1000 diameter point,
which my note makes a mass-related calculation possible.  As we have
now found, the Thruster drives are a 2000 A.U. calculation for a Sol-
like star (FFS2 pg. 65).  Note that the Sun\'s 1000 diameter point
turns out to be at roughly 9.3 A.U. << 2000.0 A.U.  You are right, and
not just planets should effect the T-plate function, any significant
mass should.

Now that I have finally found this reference (I have been looking for
quite awhile since J.P. told me about, and then you followed up with
the same), I can say that the FF&S2 material gives us very little
material to go on, but try this on for size.

On page 65, FF&S2 says:

          One of the many effects of the TL11 mastery of
          is the invention of the reactionless thrusters,
          also known as thruster plates.  Where "contra-
          gravity" at earlier tech levels can only interact
          with the local gravitational field (and is hence
          limited to working near a planetary surface),
       1  thruster plates actually use the curvature of
          space in a different manner, basically by "grabbing"
          on to it.  However, thruster plates have a limitation
          as well.  Rather than degrading slowly with local
          gravity, like contragravity, thruster plates work
          normally until the curvature reaches a threashold.
          Below that threshold, quantum-gravitic effects
       2  drastically cut the effectiveness, by a factor of
          a hundred or more.  That cutoff level turns out to
       3  be around 2,000 AU for a normal, Sol-like star.
          Thus, thruster-plate equipped ships can\'t maneuver
          effectively in deep space although they can still
          hold position and make minor course changes.  Ships
          intended to routinely work out beyond the cutoff are
          generally designed with some form of auxiliary
          propulsion that isn\'t similarly affected (fusion
          rockets or HEPlaR are the most popular).

I can conclude from (1) above that thruster plates do not act in the 1/R^2
(Inverse Square Law) fashion of normal gravity, and that its function is
somewhat less than exponential (this is like saying that it is more than
$0.10 and less than the United States\' national debt ~$5x10^12).  Then,
from (2) we know that this function drops off drastically at a given
distance, so beyond that the drive is worthless.  We are only given one
data point for one mass value.

We can solve "n" equations with "n" unknowns, for 0 < n < ?, but here we
don\'t even have the equation.

If we assumed that the equation was linear, then the 2 billion solar mass
black hole at the center of the Milky Way would have an effective thruster
plate radius given by (2x10^9 SMU x 2000 AU x 499.005 ls/AU x 60 s/m x 60 m/h
x 24 h/d x 365 d/y) = 63,293,379 light years, or a fifth of the way to the
heart of the Coma-Virgo cluster--over intergalactic distances--which the
Local Group (where we are in the Milky Way) lies on the outskirts of.

If we assumed that it fell off (until the cutoff) like square root of
the mass, then the black hole in our galaxy would only effect out to ~1415
light years radius, leaving room for stars to have their own thruster
plate fields of effect.

Even better, assuming that the same "quantum-gravitic" effect was what
causes my Jump-0 point to dropoff at the cube root of the mass,
times a constant, the super-black-hole in the Milky Way\'s center would
allow thruster plate operation out to just under 40 light years.

The difference in constants could be explained by the values of those
constants in hyperspace vs. normal space.

So, for the thruster plate effectivness function, make a two piece-wise
continuous function:

 TP = cube-root(SMU)*1997.11:  thruster-plates at 100%

      else:                    thruster-plates at 1% (out to infinity)


If anyone has knowledge of other T4 references related to this post, I
would appreciate hearing about it.  Please send it to hiwg list or my
e-mail directly (I am behind on TML digests, as usual).

Since the efficiency of Thrust plates drops off drastically at a
particular distance, we can conclude that the efficiency is governed by
a "step-function". We don\'t need more datapoints than one: the point
where efficiency drops.



Efficiency is 100% up to a specific "steepness" of the gravitational
field, then drops to "less than 1%". In other words, T-plates aren\'t
efficient in "flat" space.

That\'s because it\'s the same sort of rule as the jump distance rule. The
only equation needed is the one to calculate the "curvature" of space.
That will be the point where the efficiency drops to its 1% level.



<snip waste of BW> 



The curvature of space is akin to tidal forces, or the differential of
the force of gravity. Without going into the derevation, it is directly
proportional to the cube root of the density, since distance is
expressed in terms of the diameter of the gravity source.


So, for example, to calculate the 10 diameter limit, just use the
following equation:


distance (planetary dia.) = cuberoot(density rel. to Terra) * 10

Couldn\'t be easier!

The T-plate distance is expressed in AU, though. And we rarely know the
density of the Star in terms of Sol. But that\'s ok, since we *do*
usually know the mass and radius of the Star in terms of Sol.

Since density = Mass / Volume (proportional to r^3), we can substitute
this for the density. Since we express the distance in AU instead of
stellar Radii, r cancels out neatly!

If you want the T-Plate efficiency cutoff distance in AU, when given the
Mass of the Star in solar masses:

distance (AU) = 2000 * cuberoot(Mass)

Simple.


In short: Those looking for more detail can calculate a T-Plate cutoff
in exactly the same way as jump limits can be calculated.

Nor do I disagree that a world, ONCE CONTACTED or RE-CONTACTED, would have,
at least minimal facilities. However, unless I miss the mark on just what
the Long Night was like (and this I admit, is very possible!) I don\'t feel
that the amount of interstellar contact and commerse during the 1700+ years
warrent the number of high level starports that are present in the data.

 A Tech level 2-3 world has, again in my opinion, far more pressing concerns
than to maintain a facility that would be classified by anyone as an A class
facility (and remember, this is a facility that, by the books, can not only
repair but construct star ships) on the off chance that some trader may come
along. Once commerce, even intermitant, is established, then the type of low
tech \'ports listed Leonard\'s post would be very appropriate. This being
upgraded to "modern" Imperial levels as the trade and usage warrents. Level
3-6

As I suggested in an earlier post, I believe that the starport, and,
possibly even the tech level data for M0 should be adjusted by proximity to
the "major" centers of resurgent civilization. Those nearer the worlds
engageing in intersteller trade and exploration, should have a higher
possibility of having a higher level starport, while those further from
these centers would would have fewer and lesser level facilities. Then a
sliding scale could be applied by data simulair to the % of Re-Contact as
listed in the M0 Campaign book.

Of course the biggest problem here is identifying the "Centers". Since
starting this discussion I\'ve thought about trying to do this from current
materail, but time hasn\'t allowed me to get to it yet. Again M0 Campaign
book lists several "Pocket Empires" and larger stellar organizations. Others
that come to mind are the Darrens (I\'m not sure of their status in Year 0),
the Sword Worlds, the Julian Protectorate, Zhodani, Vargr, Aslan, and theOld
Earth Union. Perhaps the mapping work that seems to be going on currently
will help in this area, even though it seems to be aimed at the Classic era.

The descriptions of the worlds include more data than the standard UWP. I
understand the UWP, the remarks and the "B" column (bases).

There is a column called PBG. I have understood what P is for (population),
but not B and G, and I cannot seem to find them (it\'s pretty late in the
evening here in Sweden, but ...).

The stellar data is also somewhat of a mystery to me. Ever star (more than
one in some systems) is described something like "G4 V". G is probably the
spectral class (meaning a yellow dwarf star, like the Sun), but I do not
understand the rest of it.

An explanation of this would be very helpful.

Another question: What is the population of the Third Imperium composed of?
There is demographics data for the nearby pocket empires, but not for the
Imperium itself (not that I can seem to find, anyway).

I\'ll phrase this circumspectly so it doesn\'t ruin it for those that haven\'t
seen it yet.

Tonight, UK TV has shown a series 4 Babylon 5 episode in which a major
character is injured, and Sheridan takes command of the Agamnemnon. An
episode that Doug Berry quoted from on his sig file not so long ago. Title
is something like \'between the darkness and the light.\'

(This may give US readers an idea how far behind you we are).

My question is: We know that B5 has cyrotechnology like low berths, so why
didn\'t they put the major character in it to give them time to find a way
to heal her?

ObTrav: Can a character be too seriously wounded to be placed in a cryo
tube / low berth for later treatment?

The P is the population modifier. A world with a UWP of 222444-8 and a P
value of 5 would have 50.000 inhabitants.

The B is the numbers of belts in the system. If the main world is an
asteroid belt it is not included in this number I belive.

The G is the number of gas giants in the system.

Well your right in your guess evn though you might not know it. The G4 is
the spectral classification of the star. There are seven main classes,=20
O B A F G K M, which each is divided into ten subclasses. A G0 star is
very close to a F9 star. Check out info on the Harvard spectral
classification for more info.

The V behind the spectral classification is the Yerkes spectral
classification. It indicates what type of star one is dealing with

       Ia  - most luminous supergiants
       Ib  - less luminous supergiants
       II  - luminous giants
       III - normal giants
       IV  - subgiants
       V   - main sequence stars (dwarves)

I might have phrased this differently had I been planning on sending it to
the list at large.  Essentailly, I have written something in the spirit of
sub2ps, but with a somewhat larger mission.  It is still focussed on
creating a PostScript map of a secot or subsector from a data file like the
M0 one, or the subnbane files.

Good points:

Handling map files like Marc\'s M0 file.

Ability to deal with producing a subsector map, 16 subsector maps, or a
single sector map.

Allows group definitions, which can be used to do borders, shading, or display.

Ability to print just physical stats, presence, or full stats of a group.

Subsector displays are either in a traditional half page form with data, or
a full page form that puts most of the data within the printed hexes.

Downsides:

no color

No UI, solely command line

PPC and 68k mac versions seem to work, but I have been getting crashes on
the PC version.

I have not yet tested it on the old sunbane/Genie files.  It should be able
to deal with them, but "should" is not the same as "verified to work".

No real docs.  Perhaps I will find a few hours this weekend.

Legends are still too rought for my happiness.  Might replaces them with
pure text.

My current plans:

Translating it to Java, so I can get a decent UI on both the platforms I
work with.

In the classic Traveller Book =B4Scouts=B4 as in the World Builder=B4s Hand=book=20
these codes were tabled. These tables are not so small, so I don=B4t now=20
them all from my memory, but you=B4re right with the spectral class (G4) an=

software that we all want (not to mention the platform debate!) for our
Traveller needs. It set me off thinking about what software I\'d like to

Obviously, software like Rob Prior\'s Metator and Infini-V (ex-CSC) are
things that are vital to a referee short on time. Andrew Atkins FFS2
spreadsheet does similar things for PC owners, as does the Dulinor suite.
Useful tools, real aides for a referee.

But what I\'d *really* like to see is something like Battle Rider done in
3D, with access for multiple players. A game that combines strategy with
tactics. Imagine using Trillion Credit Squadron and being able to control
and dispatch fleets *in the dark of what your enemy is doing*. And when a
battle occurs being able to go in and give tactical orders to specific
ships.

It\'s something that hasn\'t really been done before - you may say Star Fleet
Academy does something similar but I\'d disagree - because almost every game
that has big ships in treats them like fighters. I\'d like a game that gives
a chance to select formations, to manuever lumbering battle wagons.  To
plan production from your conquests, maybe even design your own ships. To
link against computers or humans or both at once. Maybe some nice CGI like
B5... Being a Mac owner, it\'s be nice to have it on both Mac and PC
platforms.

I suppose what I\'m describing is a big ships and strategy version of Total
Annhilation. What do you think?

The letter is the Stellar Class.. these are O B A F G K M, from hottest to
coolest.

The number is a subclassification, from 0-9, and indicate variants of the
basic type.  A G1 is hotter than a G9

The Roman numeral is size.

Ia: Bright Supergiant
Ib: Weaker Supergiant
II: Bright Giant
III: Giant
IV: Subgiant
V: Main Sequence
VI: Dwarf
D: Subdwarf

Our Sun is a G2v.

From what I can tell, over 90% of the 3I is humans of varying race.

The Kuvasz is designed as a moderate-cost moderate-performance escort vessel
for defending larger warships or merchant craft against fighters, missiles,
pirates, relativistic rocks, and Templars. The ship is armed with 4
heavy laser barbettes for engaging other warships, but its main armament
is 10 high ROF short-ranged laser turrets. In addition it has two launchers
for light short-ranged fire-and-forget homing missiles. (In T4 terms
these missiles are only useable out to Short range but require no guidance;
in BL terms they have 20G maneuver capability but only 4 G-turns of fuel and
may be launched against other missiles or fighters in the same hex as the
launching ship, in which case they fire before the
incoming missile or fighter can fire. They may also be used against fighters or ships
using the normal combat rules.

The sensor suite, as one would expect from a BAMTech design, is elaborate;
a long-range scanner for initial detection, and LIDARs for fire control,
with backup PEMS trackers and multifunction arrays. This gives it the 
capability to detect even highly stealthy fighters out to million-km ranges and
engage them at 500,000km range.

One innovative feature is the use of a Fusion+ "boost plant" to power the
weapons in combat; in non-combat situations it is shut down, so that the
high maintenance requirements and limited endurance of Fusion+ does not
affect performance. 

The ship is unstreamlined and incapable of field 
refuelling, as it is intended to operate with fleets or with convoys travelling
between starports. The crew is slightly oversized to provide potential
replacements for other ships in the fleet. The docking ring will accomodate
a standard skiff, though one is not normally carried. One major limitation
is the Jump-2 capability. Although this was deemed sufficient for operations 
with merchant convoys and second-line warfleets, it will be unable to keep
up with Jump-3 main battle fleets.


Designers notes: This was designed using Andrew\'s impressive spreadsheet
(with some tweaks, such as using 300,000 and 150,000km beam pointers and
MFDs.)
Aside from showing off a couple of tricks - like the
fusion+ auxilliary power plant - the main point of this design (which it
arrives too late for) is providing an opponent for THUDD 7 fighters. Using
BL rules it could completely destroy any number of
Gede fighters (whose PAW would
be unable to penetrate the hull) and Tsikio fighters (having enough
acceleration to keep out of meson gun range while destroying it with its
lasers.) The Drachen Jaeger is the only one that is a serious
threat to the Kuvasz - for the price of one Kuvasz you get 16 Jaegers,
which can pick the Kuvasz appart at long range. (Of course, that
doesn\'t include the price of a carrier for the Kuvasz.)

Also note the sensor suite; making the biggest sensor scanner-only saves 
MCr 125, while once a target is detected it can be engaged with the LIDAR.

In BL terms, the heavy laser battery is rated 10:41 20:35 40:17 80:9 with a
penetration of 1/10 at all ranges; the rapid-fire lasers are
(-3) 5:24 10:24 20:24 40:24 with a penetration of 1/10 and an integral MFD.
(Laser penetration independent of intensity is a suggested FFS2 fix.) 
The warhead in the missiles is 36 with a penetration of 1/10.


This ship will often be used on in-system partrol (operating from a suitable
starport or base) and could generally be used for encounters - sort of a 
Milleu 0 version of the Gazelle (with more firepower and lower performance.)

(1) Weapon ranges and MFD sizes are kind of funny. This is more a flaw with
FFS2, of course - since we had no idea what the weapons range bands were going
to be we only put in 50,000 and 500,000km beam pointers and MFDs, but for
SSDS you need to rate performance at 300,000km. We should put back in the
300,000km beam pointer and mFD from the original FFS, and designers designing
for T4 should use that - and possibly put back in the other intermediate-range
MFDs for people designing for BL; but at the minimum, people designing for
T4 should be required to have 500,000km MFDs or beam pointers (or 300,000km
if we put them in.)

(2) Prices are mixed up for life support types (because the minimal life
support price is missing.)

(3) Missile launchers seem to always be forced to have a laser comm - which
they only need if they have a workstation - and always get charged for an
MFD whether one is installed or not. (This makes it hard to design 
light single-shot tubes for FIMs.)

(4) At least in the Excel verison I have, much of the crew calculation is
disabled.

(5) Tracker-only and Scanner-only sensors at TL10+ should be 75% cheaper

(6) Should have an option for installing multiple sensors of a given type -
military ships will often want 4-6 LIDArs, for example.

Generally a great product - certainly makes FFS2 life much easier!

Here you should be very careful. According to Yerkes classification there
is no VI or D class stars, both are accounted for in V, although I have

Excellent plan.  I would be very pleased to solicit help from the List on
developing a route for our THUDDD 8 Subsidized Merchant.  What we\'re
looking for is a loop of 3-6 systems, Jump-2 linked by successive pairs,
with one or at most two "well-developed" worlds and the rest worlds which
the Imperium wishes to prod into greater economic importance.  Worlds in
the latter category will generally be in potentially strategic positions
near the Imperial border, and will have lowish populations and non-T-prime
UPPs.  Finally, the loop should not be intrinsically profitable --
otherwise, there\'d be no need to subsidize merchants to cover it.

Suggestions?

Rob - please do FF&S first!  After seeing CSC, I figure you woul;d so a
really impresive FF&S.

I am hoping to do PE eventually, once I adapt the sector mapper to Java,
and then add a front end.  With any luck, Jo Grant\'s work will save me a
bunch of time, so I can get to the ecenomic engine.

Of course, if you get it done first, I would be very happy to see it.

B is "belts" as in asteriod/planetoid belts.

The G4 is the spectral type. Each spectral type is sub-divided into 10
subtypes by astronomers, as otherwise the scale is too coarse. So a G4
is 4/10ths of the way from G to F (or is it G to K? I can never remember).

The V is the *size* of the star. Remember, there are red giants and red
dwarfs that have the *same* spectral class (surface temp), but vastly
different sizes. The ratings are roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V, VI)
and "D" for "dwarf" (as in "white dwarf", *not* "red dwarf"). The "VI"
was in the older rules bu has been dropped after someone pointed out
that they are just *too* rare to be found.

The IG server is down. This happened when the webmaster of the day 
ceased being webmaster for the site. I have no information as to the 
intentions of IG for any possible future for this site.

At first, I\'d hoped it would be brought back online, so I put off 
posting any \'Traveller Chat\' posts. Then I was just plain 
in-over-my-head busy, so I didn\'t post. By that time, it had been so 
long...

But I miss them, too, so...

Back to Undernet we go, with all its problems. As always, I need 
topics. I can\'t come up with them week after week, so please help me! 

I\'d like some input as to the best day to hold Traveller Chat. For 
this coming week, however, we\'ll hold it on Thursday, as is 
traditional, at 7:00pm Central time. The server of choice is 
StLouis.MO.us.undernet.org, ports 6660-6669.

   Well this is what I remember from Astronomy class:

Ia: Bright Supergiant
Ib: Supergiant
II: Bright Giant
III: Giant
IV: Subgiant
V: Dwarf (aka "main sequence")
VI: Subdwarf
D: White dwarf

Note: White dwarfs used to be \'VII\', but that designation is rarely used
now.

   The order is OBAFGKM, with O being the hottest and M being the
coolest (there are also type R, N, and S stars, please ignore them for
purposes of this discussion).  The best way to remember them is the
phrase "Oh Be A Fine Girl Kiss Me", in which the word \'girl\' can be
substituted with the word \'guy\' if you prefer.  There are indeed 10
subtypes which are designed 0 - 9, O being warmer than 9 (i.e. a G2 star
is warmer than a G3, a G3 warmer than a G4, a G9 being warmer than a K0,
and so on).

   Type M stars are the most numerous, followed by type K, G, F, A, B
and then O.  Type O stars are generally the shortest lived, type M the
longest (depending upon their size).

   Stars evolve from lumps of gas in a nebula through the T Tauri stage
and eventually end up on the main sequence.  Depending upon their mass
and how hot they are, a typical star will evolve off the main sequence
when it runs out of hydrogen to fuse and begin to expand into a red
giant.  Red giants stars burn fuse helium into heavier elements. 
Eventually that source of energy also runs out, and the star collapses
in on itself.  The result is either a white dwarf (if the star\'s final
mass is 1.3 solar masses or below) or a neutron star (if the final mass
is above 1.3 solar masses).  Rapidly rotating neutron stars become
pulars.  The more massive the star, the smaller the diameter of the
final object.  This is because the larger the mass, the stronger the
pull on the object\'s atoms.

   Supergiant stars are massive freaks of nature which have a very short
life followed by a violent end (usually a supernova).  They quickly burn
the bulk of their hydrogen, then helium, working their way up the
periodic table until they reach iron (there is sufficent mass so that
these heavier elements can be created through fusion).  At that point
they catastrophically collapse, throwing debris everywhere (you are here
today because of a supernova).  The result is usually a black hole.

   Subdwarfs are stars that lack elements heavier than hydrogen in any
quantity large enough to create large planetary systems (around 2
percent or less than what the Solar System possesses).  They are
commonly found a globular clusters (primitive clusters of stars), but
can also be found traversing independently through the galactic plain. 
Because of these factors, subdwarfs would be extremely uncommon in the
Traveller universe, or at least they would not be found as companions to
main sequence stars.

   One further note: The older stellar data includes a lot of \'M\' type
white dwarfs.  This was done in error, a result of a flawed generation
sequence, a bit of ignorance, and a great deal of "somebody else\'s
problem" thinking.  The easiest fix for the data is simply to make all
MxD (where \'x\' is a number from 0 to 9) stars into MxV (where \'x\' is a
number from 0 to 9) stars.  This is one of the major issues that will
have to be addressed when it comes time to edit all the collected sector
data.

Harold

P.S. The real astronomers on this list (as in those known as doctor or
professor for short) may feel free to add to or correct my "Reader\'s
Digest" version of stars above.

who know a heck of a lot more about physics and engineering than I do
here, so I thought I\'d ask. 

I\'ve been reading a bit about magnetic sails (huge loops of
superconducting wire carrying lots of current, which are used to "sail"
the solar wind). The articles I\'ve read have all talked about their use as
in-system propulsion.  There are references to articles about their use in
interstellar travel, but I can\'t get a hold of them. 

So, I\'ve some questions:

The articles I\'ve read mention that magsails can be used to decelerate
starships by using the galactic magnetic field to slow down.  Is this
substantially accurate, and if so, can magsails actually be used to
decelerate a ship going a considerable fraction of C (say 15%-50%C)? 

Also, what sort of deceleration are we talking about, 0.0001 Gs, 0.1 Gs,
what?  About how long would you need to be decelerating, and roughly how
much power and how much sail (diameter) would you need per ton of ship? 

Many Thanks-

	For what it\'s worth, the FF&S1 MFDs remain compatible with
FF&S2. That\'s because, when we ran out of time, all I did for
communicators and MFDs was a straight-line interpolation between
the FF&S1 entries ...

	For spreadsheet gurus out there, your absolute best bet is to
put in the tables from FF&S1, then interpolate based on range
(i.e. for the 50,000km versions, it\'s part way between FF&S1\'s
30,000 and 60,000km versions ...). The 500,000km jobbie is a
straightline extrapolation based on the 270,000 and 300,000
versions.

The K\'kree make a great menace.  They are ruthless, powerful, and feel that
it is a good thing to kill every meat-eater in the galaxy.  I ran a MT game
set in the Gateway Sector that made the PCs very afraid of those oversized
ships.

The Sword Worlders are the main villians in my current game.  Done
correctly, they are scarier than the Zhodani.

I\'m seeing a strange dichotomy with this new Alien movie.  There are
those who think its a pretty good movie, and there are those who don\'t
like it at all.

I went with three other people.  Two of us hated it--I mean really hated
it.  I gave it a 1 out of 5 stars because I thought the special effects
were good.  The other person who hated it wanted to give it a 0, but
settled on a 1 as well after I pointed out the good special effects.

Then, the other two of us, both gave it a 3--rating it a pretty good
movie on our 0-5 scale.

From the reviews I\'ve seen, I see that my group is fairly representative
of many other people\'s opinons.  I haven\'t seen anybody who thought it
was the best Alien movie or even an incredible, great, excellent movie,
but I\'ve seen several who think it was a very good movie well worth
seeing.

Then there are others, like me, who thought it was total crap and didn\'t
get much out of it at all.


The best I can say about Alien Resurrection is to make the analogy of
Rambo.

First Blood was a top notch, very well written/directed/and acted film.
Rambo was a comic book.

Alien 4 is just like that.  It\'s a comic book complete with a new
superhuman Ripley with acid for blood and space mercenaries who can
shoot a guy behind them (whose holding a gun to their head) by
richoceting a bullet off the ceiling.

I thought it was dumb and a bad direction for the dark, realistic, hard
science series to take.  Others like this sort of thing--with fantastic,
Arnold S. type of stunts and Freddy Kruger gore.

The best thing I can say about the film is that I like Alien 3 better,
and I thought Alien 3 sucked a big enchilada.

For the record, here\'s what I thought of all the Alien movies.

Alien    3 stars.  A good suspense film, although a little slow.

Aliens   5 stars.  I LOVED this movie, and I still do.

Alien 3  2 stars.  Nice cinematography, but the story didn\'t go anywhere
interesting.

Alien Resurrection   1 star.  A comic book with some nice special
effects.

Hey! I resemble that remark!  ;->  

If you are talking about TOS Klingons I\'ll buy it...sneaky, sly, and

Canonically, the first appearance of CLC weapons is around TL12/13.  I
think they first showed up in TNE, where the Hivers were supplying some of
the parts for RC laser weapons.

My personal designs (all TL12) use chemical cartridges for reasons of
weight and efficiency.

I went and saw it with two of my friends.  We are all pretty big fans of the
series in the sense that we all own the Alien trilogy boxed sets.  I was
probably the biggest fan of the movies in the group though, from a "film
geek" perspective.

All of us loved it.  It was incredible, my friend Brendan was in awe of it
(as a note, he\'s a much more artsy than sciencey fellow) like really, mouth
gaping throughout the whole thing.  I must admit, I was really, really
entertained...

But, and there\'s always a but, isn\'t there?

BUT, the ending sucked so badly that I am still fuming.  I don\'t mean the
"ending" directly.  Storywise, the ending was fine, but suddenly, about 15
minutes from the ending the movie just starts getting really stupid and
throws logic, consistency, and decent special effects out the window and just
starts getting _terrible_...

At the risk of being involved in another "ST-like" debacle, my favorites in
the series are, in this order:

Alien - The best of the group.  It scared the pants off me as a child, and,
well, it has surface suits designed by Moebius.  Too cool.

Alien 3 - In my opinion stays closest to the original in feel, flavor, and
look.  Some problems with the plot, but a gripping movie nonetheless.

Aliens - An action film in space.  Eh.  A great movie, but I was expecting to
be scared.

Alien:  Resurrection - If it wasn\'t for the ending, this movie would be much
higher on the scale.

One scientific remark:

Constellations only exist as such when viewed from specific worlds. If you
move to another world, you will not recognize the constellation. The stars
will be spread out relative to each other, and other stars will probably be
among the stars of the constellation.

My current campaign is about half-way through 1106.  The Zhodani are
starting to gear up for the Fifth War of Containment.  The SWC is hoping
for a massive land grab.

My model for the Sword Worlds is Israel in the 1950s.  They are tiny,
surrounded by states that either hate them or could crush them without a
second thought, and have a strong cultural identity.  They have a strong
sense of manifest destiny.  They truly believe that the ends justify the
means.

The Confederation\'s Bureau of Information Management is coordinating piracy
in the Lunion, Glisten, and D-268 subsectors in an effort to force the
Imperial navy to waste time and energy chasing down privateers (see?
SOMEBODY read all those pirate threads!).

The BIM is the worst aspects of the Stasi, KGB, and Mossad rolled into one.
 They think anyone who isn\'t a Sword Worlder is untermenschen, deserving
only to serve the chosen people.

I\'ll admit that I\'ve added a bit of Christian Identity to the mix, but
these guys are fanatics, blinded to the reality of what they are doing.
For those of you who read "Honor Harrington", think of the religious
fanatics from "The Honor of the Queen."

\'Zero\'. Forgive me for taking up bandwidth with \'way off list stuff, but
here\'s my review for those who\'re interested. And for those who\'re not...
here it is anyway:

Zero - A Review
MJ Dougherty

I believe that every RPG should be unique. Each should have something that
makes it different from all the others. Something other than the type of
dice used, that is. Whether its setting, style or concept, a new game
should have something about it that helps the prospective player decide
between this game and all the others. Otherwise, why publish? Why add one
more game to the market if theres nothing new about it?	It was with this
thought in mind that I opened my review copy of Zero.	
	Zero is a new SF game from Arcangel Entertainment. Its certainly not
mainstream SF - no interstellar travel. Instead it uses a rather grim
setting vaguely reminiscent of Paranoia (without the humor) meets Star
Treks Borg. But a good deal nastier.	
	Visually the game is striking. Its based around Steve Stones rather
weird artwork, which mainly depicts biological/cybernetic creatures. The
basic rulebook (79 pages) is a slim volume in soft, light card covers which
seem reasonably robust (they survived a couple of trips in my notorious
Game Stuff Bag undamaged). The covers look good in black and green - no,
just mainly black. That sums up the game setting as well.	
	Rules are simple, with characters having a few specialist or Focus
skills and being capable of performing any other task with at least some
chance of success. Characters belong to one of five castes: Archivists,
Breeders, Drones, Soldiers or Technicians, with each caste having certain
advantages and disadvantages.
	All characters have a Focus level - equal to the number of Focus skills
the character has. The lower this level is, the better the character is at
those skills - so you can have less Focus skills and be better at them, or
more and be poorer. The characters can perform other skills, but not nearly
so well.
	Combat is quick and simple, with damage based upon how well an attack
succeeds as well as weapon type - a marginal shot with a blaster can be
less damaging than a knife thrown by an expert. With characters able to
take 10 wounds, and a flamer doing 4 per success level, it is possible for
a character with a low Focus level to devastate a target in a single shot.
Combat against skilled opponents can be very deadly.
	The characters begin the game with very little idea about their world.
They are biomechanoids - a combination of human and cybernetic parts. They
are part of the Hive, an underground complex of unknown size and origin.
They were all linked in telepathic unity under the leadership of Queen
Zero, until a few seconds ago. 
	Now the characters suddenly find themselves cut off from the rest of the
Hive, with no idea why or how. They must survive and try to understand what
has happened to them. Now that they have suddenly become individuals the
Hive has rejected them. They have only their caste tools and skills. They
dont even have names - just numbers.
	The characters must struggle to survive first of all, then to discover
what has happened to them. Maybe theyll discover new goals for themselves.
There are many opportunities to be messily killed while this is going
on....	
	The rulebook presents a minimum to start playing the game. Enough
background to get started, enough equipment and being details to run a
game, enough background to let the characters find a little out about the
world. But only just enough.
	Theres plenty the rulebook doesnt tell, and deliberately so. The referee
is not given all the facts in the first book. Instead there is a short
section on the Zero story arc, a discussion on what the game should feel
like, and an injunction to Take the ball and run with it.	
	In some ways this is frustrating - I like answers - but in other ways its
a good idea. The referee has to be creative, because the facts arent
presented. This creativity is guided, but not restricted, by the game
concept. Sort of like youd expect from a game that came from an artists
imagination.	
	The Adventures and Campaigns section offers some advice on running games -
motivating characters, staging adventures, making adventures memorable. The
advice is sound, and covers many areas a beginning referee would struggle
with. Experienced  players might gain a few insights too.
	Lastly, the rulebook contains a sample adventure, which is linear and
somewhat simplistic. With enough GM pressure and some good staging, it
could be a memorable adventure - and in fairness, its hard to write
complex scenarios for first-session games, especially where the setting is
so alien.

	Overall:
	Zero is a very competent product. Its different enough to stand out from
the rest, easy to learn, and well set out. Beginners are guided well enough
to cope - indeed, some things about the game seem targeted at a beginner
audience - but to really make something of this game requires an
experienced referee who can take the setting and concepts and develop them
into something special. There is an ongoing story arc to be developed
through several supplements, and enough mystery to keep GMs and players
interested. The strange - and very gritty, grim and unpleasant -  setting
and the unsusal artwork might be a little off-putting to some, but thats a
matter of taste. Others will love it.	
	I think Zero is a little lightweight at $25 for the rulebook, but at the
same time I found the setting intriguing, and want to know more. Youre not
so much buying a game as a concept here, and theres loads of mileage in
the storyline. Maybe Ill play it out, just to see what happens....	
	I dont think Zero will appeal to everyone, but its well worth looking at
to find out.

Races I identify with? Probably something like:

50% Solomani
25% Darrian
25% Vargr

With possibly a hint of Hiver.

Definitely no K\'Kree.

It only opened here on Friday (I\'m hoping to see it some time this 
week), but this is the story I\'m getting from reviewers here, too. 
Everybody agrees it\'s not as good as the first two, but half the people 
think it was a big improvement on 3, while the rest think it\'s the worst 
yet.

Agreed.

Yeah, I\'d agree with that.

Um. Major plot problems, IMHO (starting with what the **** were those face 
huggers doing there at the start?) Yes, killing off Hicks and Newt kind of fits 
in with the generally hopeless we\'re-all-going-to-die feel, but it makes a 
complete mockery of all the heroics in the second film. If you don\'t want them 
in the film, just stick them in a different lifeboat. Also, the fact that 
everybody looks, sounds, and acts pretty much the same (not to mention the fact 
that they\'re all rapists and murderers) makes it hard to like any of them, 
which means you don\'t *care* when one of them gets shredded. Wasn\'t too keen on 
Ripley\'s death, either.

Alien was a hard act to follow, and Cameron\'s best at action films. I\'d rate it 
better than 3, but not quite as good as 1.

They involve a star ship design I\'m working on. It\'s kind of a forerunner to
the infamous Annic Nove (with out the solar collectors of accumulators!).
Any way, I\'m interested in utilizing the unique manuver setup of the \'Nova,
i.e. a non-streamlined ship that carries a shuttle with the shuttle acting
as a tug in normal space, while the main ship houses the Jump drive.

Yes, I know that if some one hijacks the shuttle it leaves the main ship in
a bad way. That\'s part of the idea! (heh, heh, heh)

Anyway, the questions come into docking and the using the shuttle to
manuver. Would a standard docking ring (in FFS2) be able to handle the
strain of using the shuttle for 1 g manuvering of the entire ship ( I\'m
pictureing a 400 std ship with a 90 std shuttle, by the rules this becomes a
300 +/- std main ship, the docking ring set up simulair to the \'Nova, nose
in at the stern of the main ship.) ?

Next, how would you all recommend sizing the shuttle drive to increase the
power to operate for both ships? I\'ve checked the mass and displacement of a
standard M-drive for the main ship. Then increased the M-drive of the
shuttle to match, is this an acceptable way to do this or are there some
better ideas out there?

Third is control. I\'m assuming that the shuttle computer can be slaved to
the main ship computer, which can then be used for control. Would this
require a pilot on board the shuttle? Also should the computers be "matched"
as far a size and capacity, or can the shuttle be a less sophisticated
model?

Well, thanks for any help you can give. I appriciate it!

I think it is the worst yet:


Don\'t read any further if you don\'t want the spoiler!!!!


























They introduced an element of the aliens being intelligent into the movie;
but other than the escape scene, they went right back to being dumb aliens
from the other 3 movies.


Ripley having alien blood in her was a cool idea and they used it here and
there; though I think they could have done MUCH more with it than they
did.


Introducing another android into the movie was lame, though I am sure that
some of the guys out there enjoyed winona ryder scenes =)


The plot simply wasn\'t there at all. There were far too many disjointed
"let\'s do this because we don\'t have the budget to make the plot flow"
scenes.


And finally,


How many times can \'kill the aliens in the ship\' be run into the ground?

    'body' => 'MULTIPLE TL\'s

The monolithic TL is a good way to approximate the tech level of a culture,
but it certainly isn\'t able to give a detailed picture of a society\'s
technology.  This ground has been worked already, but I\'m investigating
breaking the TL down into functional areas.  It isn\'t possible to cover
*everything*, so I\'m trying to keep these areas very broad, but focused on
the technologies we use in Traveller.  Here are the seven I\'m considering:

 Materials 
 Gravitics
 Drives
 Power
 Electronics
 Medical
 Weapons
 
Am I leaving any major groupings out? 

Should they be organized differently?

TL VARIATIONS

1.  Generate a TL as normal.  This is the *approximate* level of
    technology in a culture, and how an outsider would rate it. 
    
2.  Modify the TL for each area.  This is this culture\'s detailed level
    of technology in that area. 
    
    a.  Roll (2d6-7)/10.  This will produce a normal distribution
        ranging from -0.5 to 0.5, with a 0 mean, and 0.1 steps.
        
    b.  Add the number to the General-TL.    
        
    c.  The GM can, of course, adjust the generated TL\'s as she sees
        fit.
        
[Example:  Malone has a General-TL of 10, and we want to find out exactly
what their Materials-TL is.  We roll (6-7)/10 and get -0.1, so Malone\'s
Materials-TL is 10 + (-0.1), or 9.9...

 General-TL                 10.0
 Materials-TL   (6-7)/10     9.9
 Gravitics-TL   (5-7)/10     9.8
 Drives-TL      (4-7)/10     9.7     (All actual rolls)
 Power-TL       (8-7)/10    10.1
 Electronics-TL (10-7)/10   10.3
 Medical-TL     (5-7)/10     9.8
 Weapons-TL     (12-7)/10   10.5
 
....So, Malone lags in several technical areas, but is pretty advanced in
Electronics and Weapons.  PC\'s wouldn\'t want to have their drives worked on
a Malone, but would probably get better (and lower priced) weaponry there.]

3.  Modify the TL for the Company actually doing the work. 

    a.  Roll (2d6-7)/10.  This will produce a normal distribution
        ranging from -0.5 to 0.5, with a 0 mean, and 0.1 steps.
        
    b.  Add this number to the detailed technology in question.
    
    c.  Again the GM can adjust results as she sees fit.
    
[Example:  Our PC\'s have landed on Malone and *have* to have their TL-10
drive repaired before they continue.  They find there are three companies
that work on drives:

 Zellers Motors         9.7 + (12-7)/10     10.2
 Hobert and Sons        9.7 + (4-7)/10       9.4
 MDRU, Corp             9.7 + (7-7)/10       9.7
 
Obviously, they would do better with Zellers Motors, but do they know that? 
The GM could let them discover it through roleplaying...or not.] 

I\'m not sure exactly how I\'m going to apply these ideas, but I wanted to
toss them out for examination.  A couple of ideas...

1.  The *cost* of a component varies by the detailed TL used to
    manufacture or service it.
    
    a.  If the TL used to work on a component (DTL) is above the
        available TL then cost is:
        
        Cost * (1 + (TL - DTL)*10)
        
    b.  If the TL used to work on a component (DTL) is lower than the
        available TL then cost is:
        
        Cost / (1+(DTL - TL)*10)
        
    c.  If the TL used (DTL) is equal to the available TL then cost is:
    
        Cost     
        
[Example:  Zellers Motors (DTL=10.2) is servicing a TL10 drive with a base
cost of 1000Cr. Their DTL is higher than the 10 needed so...
        
            Cost = 1000 / (1 + (10.2 - 10)*10) = 333cr
            
Hobert and Sons (DTL=9.4), doing the same job, has a DTL lower than 10
so...

            Cost = 1000 * (1 + (10 - 9.4)*10) = 7,000cr
            
That\'s a pretty big spread! ;->]

2.  The performance of components vary by the detailed TL used to build
    it.  This would allow for significant differences in performance
    between warships of cultures of nominally equal tech levels.  Say
    Boaz and Malone, both TL10, are at war.  Drive-TL is actually 10.2
    for Boaz and 9.7 for Malone...Boaz\'s ships should have an advantage
    with regards to drive performance/volume/cost.  Weapons-TL is 9.8
    for Boaz and 10.5 for Malone..Malone\'s weapons should have the
    advantage in performance.
    
    I\'m a little unsure how to apply this one, but I like the concept.

What does everyone think?

Personally, I always pick the armor factor for ships, and calculate the
thickness from that.  OTOH, for recreating existing vehicles I\'d want to
enter a thickness and have the AV calculated.

Of course, given either you can calculate the other. For your computer
program I\'d like you to allow inputing ether Thickness or AV, and have the
program figure out the other.  That shouldn\'t be *too* hard. ;->


Eris,

ps. If I *have* to pick, I\'d vote for AV...but I hope I don\'t have to pick.

I think Doug Berry already answered this, but it does seem that you can
build lower-tech but self-contained direct energy input lasers.  They\'ve
got enough oomph for torching butterflies, which admittedly limits their
usefulness in conventional military applications.

Hm.  I\'ll run one up tomorrow if I get a chance.

Also in the CPR Tech levels would be the Binary Propellant and Liquid
Propellant weapons advantage over ETC no casing to eject. Liquid Propellant
and ETC both use and electrical charge, but the Liquid use a lesser amount
of electrical energy input. Both Binary and Liquid propellants have greatly
reduced recoil and muzzle flash signatures.

Regrettably, I have three measures I use, depending on task.

1.  AV, for when I want the ship to stop a specific weapon.  This is likely
the most common.

2.  Thickness, for when I have decided that this ship has armor "that
thick"  This is what I use the least.

3.  Percentage of volume.  This I use a lot in my concept craft.  For
example - I am designing a 90kt Shield class battleship, which is round,
and a 90kt Lance class battleship, which is pointy.  The one is designed to
flatten targets at long range, and the other at short.  Once I fill the box
with other systems, I know the remaining space available to apportion among
weapons, sensors, and armor, and being able to just say 10% of the ship
goes to armor, 10% to weapons, and 10% to point defense weapons, sensors,
controls, and so on, would make the early phases easier.

To wit: the Shield class currently has an armor rating of 6000, which
requires 300 cm. of superdense armor, and thus it takes roughly 10% of the
hull, more or less.  When I first laid it out, I figured out that I had
roughly 10% of my internal volume free, and it would have been nice to just
type that number in, and let it become the appropriate armor value as the
size of the ship changed.

>(I\'m tinkering with FFS2, and want to avoid too many complications and
>rewrites.)

One request - besides letting me see a copy some time, would be conversions
in dialogs.  For example, in the above system, if I click "By volume", type
10% in, and then click "by rating", it would be really nice of the entry
field got the value "3000" instead of "0.1"

Take it or leave it as you wish, of course.

This sounds _great_ for story purposes but given the lower population
and Tech Levels how can the Sword Worlds be a serious threat to the
sector (much less to the Imperium) ?

The fact that that they "have a strong cultural identity.  They have a
strong sense of manifest destiny." may help to explain why they are
trying this but does not explain why they would have a chance of
success.  Israel in the 50\'s was outnumbered but it had IMHO a higher
military tech level than its neighbors, or at least it had equipment of
(possibly fractionally) higher tech level that it had received from the
USA.  Do you have the Zhodhani funneling arms into the Sword Worlds ?
Given that the counselate is TL 14 and has TL 13 reserve forces (source
5thFW) it seems unlikely that it could/would be giving arms transfers of
better than TL 12-13.  This is a step up from the Sword Worlds native
military tech level of 10 - 12, but is it enough improvement to threaten
the area ?

On the other hand the neighboring subsectors are pretty weak & low tech.
If the Imperium is more worried about the Zhodani and has most of its
military forces farher coreward than the area the Sword Worlds just
might be able to step on their neighboring subsectors (see data below -
Sup 3 Spinward Marches & The Regency SB).

District 268 has 1 billon people at TL 13, 0.9 billion at TL 12 and 6
billion at Tl 10.  District 268 is not formally part of the Imperium but
it is under Imperial "protection" (i.e. control)

It sure looks as if the Sword Worlds are a more than a match for Villis
Subsector or District 268 (or both).  They might be able to handle the
Darrians (if not for the Darrians higher technology).  They might be
able to handle Lunion subsectors forces.  The Imperium, or even the
Domain should be able to squash them like a bug.

If we assume Imperial Military assets within the Marches are deployed
primarily in response to the Zhodani threat with the Sword Worlds being
considered a secondary, or tertiary problem for local forces they might
well be able to do quite well until the Imperium could spare & bring in
reinforcements.  This is all that is needed for them to be perceived as
a threat.  Doug seems to have a plausible threat here.

I had always dismissed the Sword Worlds as a joke until I just did this
miltary analysis.

	This would be High Common--the world\'s UWP TL

	Low Common lower limit is HC/2, upper limit is HC. LC=
Population TL Modifier (+1 for pop 5-, -1 for pop 9+),plus Global
Expansiveness modifier (i.e. monolithic, discordant, or

	Energy TL is High Common plus a 2D random table-based modifier.

	etc., etc.  It\'s set up so there is some common link between
different TLs, to keep from getting completely random and
unbelievable difference, but still provide interesting variety.
And no, High Common is *not* the ceiling for all the different

The Dhu\'ul Fiqar Assault Sled is a grav tank destroyer and direct fire
artillery platform for the Government of God, a major pocket empire in
Subsector B of The Old Expanses. The Dhu\'ul Fiqar is too expensive to
deploy as a standard grav tank and is generally deployed several tens of
kilometers behind the forward edge of the battle area. Dhu\'ul Fiqars are
organized into batteries of four and despite their enormous speed generally
operate close to the ground. When operating in a grav tank destroyer role,
they will indentify a grav tank target at Subregional range using their
Gravitic sensors, pop up to effective firing altitude and blanket the
target area with plasma bolts before returning to NOE operation. Their
extreme agility allows them to pop up extremely rapidly. When operating as
direct fire artillery, the Dhu\'ul Fiqars engage targets designated by other
units in a roughly similar manner.

The Dhu\'ul Fiqar is laid out as a compact wedge, with its Plasma Cannon
along its midline. The pilot sits to the right of the cannon, while the
gunner and commander share a "cockpit" (which includes the turret-mounted
Machinegun) on the left side. The design team for the Dhu\'ul Fiqar
considered mounting the main armament in a turret, but rejected the notion
in favor of embedding the plasma cannon in the hull. The Dhu\'ul Fiqar\'s
agility enables it to engage targets as rapidly as more conventional grav
tanks.

Select thickness for vehicles (then you can use real world figures and play
with the results).

Select factor for starships (much bigger scale and not much in the way of
real world comparison to go by)

That doesn\'t make it any easier, does it?

Rob, could you put in two entries in the dialogue box? One to allow
thickness to be entered, and the other to allow factor. Only allow one or
the other, and the entry of one calculates the other...

The Gazelle was designed this way in High Guard. I\'m not sure how the
modular clippers in TNE work, but I would assume that the acceleration
would be higher with no modules installed.

I suppose it really depends on the jump performance - if the shuttle comp
exceeds the performance needed for jump, I would leave it. I\'ve vague
recollections that the computer size and rating used to represent three
identical units for redundancy and back up. If this is so you could assume
that the shuttle contains 1 of these units, and interfaces with the other
two when it docks(*).

The U.S. gave very little in the way actual hardware to Israel before the
early 50\'s, and yet Israel still beat a much larger British-trained Arab
legion, armed with then-modern weapons and armored vehicles.  They were
more motivated and better lead.  Leadership and supply are the keys, here.

If the model is Israel again, when the U.S. -did- begin to funnel weapons,
it funneled at least some front-line weaponry, partly because it had
liquidated its war stocks and partly because it wanted to test the new
systems in combat.

Yes.  But the consequences of doing so could be too costly.  It could start
an interstellar war.  Better to use the small fry as proxy combatants.

This reminds me of the Technology Chart in MegaTraveller: Referee=B4s Compa=

This one was seperated in, IIRC:

Personal/Military Weaponry (From Clubs over Blackpowder to Plasma Cannons)
Computer (Mathematics, Abacus, Relais Computer, Superconductors ...)
Communications (Telephone, TV, Holovideo ...)
Environment (Shacks, Cities, Weather Control)
Medicals (From crude surgery to Anagathics)
Transportation Land/Water/Air/Space (Wheels, Planes, Gravitics, Jump Drives=
)
Energy/Power Production (Fire, Coal, Wind, Solar, Atom, Fusion, Fusion+)

The Tech Levels shown on that chart went up to 18. I liked this one.
Gravitics should not be an own column, as it is a late tech and there are=

There was only one Column missing (but I understand why):

Got a little problem with my players. They\'re Munchkins. I\'m running foul of
a group of players whose first choice of equipment is PGMP or FPMG. They

various non-combative plot seeds but they players wither ignore these, or
feel the scenario was a bore.

What I\'m looking for is a little twist in the tale to a hack and slay type
scenario. Something that leaves the palyers satisfied with having killed
something but adds a non-combative pull/push/enigma etc. that might appeal
to munchkins.

I\'m basically trying to ween the players away from the kill-em, rob-em, next

answer for.

As there shure will be various combat systems to convert real world data

Maybe.

Weapons for example - someone else pointed this out. One TL for
slug throwers, lasers, plasma weapons, sonic weapons, melee
weapons, etc? 

Also, does electronics == computers? My ability to make really
small radios has no direct relation to whether or not I can
make Quake.

In a lot of cases, things will end up falling into multiple
categories. Which may or may not be what you want.

9.9?? How is 9.9 any different from 10? Can 9.9 build really awesome TL
9 stuff but not TL 10? Or can it build crappy TL 10 stuff? At what point
do TL 10 items become available - TL 9.1? TL 10.0?

You\'d probably see a +/-0.5 variation in TL just across different
companies
on a certain world. Rating a whole world to within 0.1 TLs seems to be
"measuring below the noise threshold" (for lack of a better
description).

I swear, I was reading your message in detail as I replied to it and
I didn\'t even know this was here when I wrote my last sentance above...
wierd. Anyway, fractional TL ratings would probably be the kind of 
thing that isn\'t present as a in-the-game-world item (which regular
TL is, somewhat debatably), so (IMO) players shouldn\'t be able to
go to the yellow pages and say "We want to find the company with the
highest fractional TL".

What\'s that old engineer\'s joke? "Low Cost, Easy to use, High
Performance 
- - pick any two." So, presumably, you left out ease of use as a third
thing 
that could improve. Of course, there is a lot of variation at a given
TL,
as the trade-offs will be different depending on where you are. For
example,
Vilani items are often engineered for complete ease of use, while
Solomani
ones are often built for performance.

> What does everyone think? 

Interesting. Although it may be of marginal use unless your players\'
characters spend a lot time (in-game) reading "Consumers Reports" and
such.

After a century of growth and prosperity, the Rule of Man began to founder.
The old Vilani customs had been swept away, but with nothing to replace them
the result was more often than not chaotic.  Industrial production dropped,
unemployment rose, and populations rose up in rebellion against their old
leaders.
Stability was also hindered by the fact that there was no established rule
of succession for Emperors.  An aspiring Emperor had to win the support of
the Council of Noble Officers, of which he or she was normally, but not
always, a part.  At the death of an Emperor, the Council members began
jockeying for position, calling in favours or using their influence to gain
a majority.  While these struggles were initially political, By 2000 they
had become increasingly ruthless and violent in nature.  Claimants began
building regional power bases as succession struggles began to be marked by
open warfare.  At first restricted to small scale actions and occasional
commerce raids on opposing corporate forces, they became more intense with
each succession crisis.
When Empress Juliana died in 1926, the Council of Noble Officers was split
into a half dozen rival factions, each with their own candidate.  Drawing on
their regional bases, they fought a series of increasingly large battles to
eliminate their rivals.  The fighting resulted in severe disruption of
interstellar trade and commerce, and contributed to the further decline of
the Second Imperium.
Admiral Paskevi defeated his last rival, Admiral Irina Yakovlev at the
Battle of Shantai in 1921.  Ascending the throne as Hiroshi V, ruled an
empire that was increasingly ungovernable.  The struggle for the throne had
encouraged regionalism at the expense of the Empire as a whole.  Individual
worlds became less and less concerned with their neighbors as the lingering
economic stagnation deepened into depression.  In response to this, Hiroshi
V enacted a series of reforms in -1915 aimed at revitalizing the Rule of
Man.  The last vestiges of the old Vilani caste system were swept away as he
outlawed bonded labour.  Recognising that central government from Hub/Ershur
was no longer possible, the government was decentralized.  Regional groups,
now known as provinces, were given considerable autonomy.  Finally, size
of the Imperial Navy was drasticly reduced, in an attempt to reduce the
power of the Fleet Admirals.  The provinces were allowed to field their own
naval forces, which were often transferred directly from the central navy.
Four provinces were recognized in the Solomani Rim:  Dingir, Vega , Terra
and Easter.  The Terran Mercantile Community, long at loggerheads with the
central authorities over its quasi-military merchant escorts, was now
able to openly field its own naval forces.

Twilight and the Rise of the Successor States

Hiroshi Vs reforms did little to slow the decay of the Rule of Man.  The
central authorities now had even less power to deal with regional dissent,
and the provinces payed less and less attention to directives from
Hub/Ershur. By 1880, large parts of the Rule of Man were disintegrating
into warring factions.  Without any clear succession procedure, pitched
battles for the throne became commonplace throughout the Empire.  Following
the death of Manuel III at the Battle of Esegarde in 1877, no claimant was
able to control more than a small part of the Rule of Man.  As conflict
became endemic, interstellar trade slowed and the economies of many worlds
were ruined.
The final destruction of the old Vilani caste system, hailed by Hiroshi V
and his supporters as a triumph for sentient rights, was the final nail in
the Rule of Mans coffin.  Within a generation of the reforms, industrial
production had plummeted, particularly in the areas that had held to the
Vilani culture the hardest.  Unemployment soared, leading to domestic
unrest, violence and revolution.  This drove production down still further,
fuelling a vicious circle of economic nd social collapse.
By 1860, the Solomani Rim was effectively cut off from the central Empire.
The systems of the sector strengthened their regional ties, and attempted to
shield their economies from the worst of the collapse.  The Terran
Mercantile Community quietly declared its independence from the Rule of Man
in -1803.  The other regional groups in the Rim soon followed, and continued
to chart their own course.  While historians date the official collapse of
the Rule of Man at 1776, this date holds little significance in the
Solomani Rim.  Here, the Empire had for all intents and purposes ceased to
exist almost a century beforehand.  In its place rose the fivce roughly
subsector-sized political units known locally as the Successor States.
While most of the Solomani Rim enjoyed peace, conflicts and struggles over
the remains of the Rule of Man did spill over into the sectors coreward
regions.  The worlds of the Easter Concord were the most affected, but
by 1700 had secured their defenses (see The Easter Concord).  A mood of
isolationism settled over the Rim, resulting in a gradual drop in
interstellar trade even within the individual Successor States.

I think that you should generate at least a +1/-1 TL, if you\'re going to
do that, as fractional TL\'s get pretty unwieieldy.

Sure Zellers is the place with the spotless bays, every tool in existence,
and techs in clean white uniforms. Hobert and Sons is a beat up old
warehouse in a seedy part of town with convenient access to chop shops and
two dogs laying in the parking lot, and two mechanics, Sal and Vinny. 
They\'ll also be a lot cheaper on their initial estimate, but\'ll take
longer than they said, and eventually might cost you more, and the repair
_certainly_ won\'t be as reliable as Zellers.

I also think that\'s going to be different. Think of an auto repair place.
The higher tech place will be able to charge a healthy premium for the
better and faster work they\'ll do, leaving H&S to scratch along, with
their only incentive being to lower prices. There\'s no way that H&S will
stay in business charging 21 _TIMES_ what a competitor does! I think a
more reasonable range, given your +/- 0.5 spread is to simply apply the
spread difference, and apply it in the _other_ direction. To user your
example Zellers is 10.2 which is .5 or 50 % higher, they\'ll charge 1500cr
to to the job, fast, on time and within estimate, using factory parts and
factory tools to do the job.

H&S are at 9.4 which is .3 or 30% lower. They\'ll do the job for 700cr.
They\'ll use cheap or refurbished parts, and their factory tools come from
Sears, if you\'re lucky. When the job calls for a 31 degree angled 9.4 mm
Zieback spanner, they\'ll jam in a vise-grip and hope the bolt doesn\'t
shear off.

They\'ll also struggle for two hours to do what the techs at Zellers can do
in five minutes because they have the proper tools. (On this I speak from
long personal experience, having owned an Italian motorcycle. The manual
has four pages detailing the special tools the factory shop must have.)

I\'m not sure that you can model that very well given the coarse scale that
Traveller combat and ships work.

Not to mention _damned_ good intelligence, and a real sense of having
their backs to the wall, which would be a very good description of the
Sword Worlders and the Zhodani. The Israeli\'s also beat them using
mostly small unit guerilla tactics which have consistently beat large
standing armies every time. In later conflicts the Israelis made damn sure
they had air superiority, which will make a large armor force extremely
vulnerable.

If they cannot get away from killing, sober them up by having them kill the
wrong persons (innocent civilians etc.). Be colorful in your descriptions.
Make them realize what they have done. Make them feel bad about it. Really
bad.

Quite possible, but the cost of the occasional lost ship alone accounts
for most of the Cr360, so it dosen\'t make much of a difference.

Exactly. I was trying to demonstrate that there is a discrepancy between
the number of ships/cargoes a pirate would need in order to make a living
and realistic loss rates. Whether I have done so is, of course, a matter
of opinion ;-)

I\'m not using the canonical freight and passenger rates. Instead I\'m
assuming that the profits of any regular shipping line is commensurate
with the canonical rate of interest for starship loans. That way you
avoid the discrepancy of ships that can\'t turn a profit merrily plying
the spacelanes in defiance of economic logic.

For simplicity\'s sake I\'m assuming a rate of return of 6.25% for banks
and owners alike. This gives owners an effective rate of return slightly
higher than that of the banks, but that is quite reasonable since if an
owner goes bankrupt he loses everything while the bank still has title
to the ship. And it is so much simpler.

If a regular, established line took a profit much in excess of 6.25%,
surely some other line would move in and undercut it, wouldn\'t it?

OK, let me put it another way: How can four patrol ships make a difference
big enough to account for 3% of the gross? If the transport ships was
armed (at the cost of a reduction in cargo space, mind you), what do you
need the patrol ships for? And if you need the patrol ships, just how do
you use them?

IMO this would result in lesser freight and passenger charges, not greater
profits.

Yes, but 3% of gross is not small potatoes. Does the result really justify
the expense unless it really improves the survival of the freighters
markedly?

The good news: I have made several fixes to the spreadsheet, and have
upgraded it to version 1.3. Here\'s the short list:

   * Fixed TL10+ scanners and trackers. 
   * Fixed sensors and jammers to allow for multiple components
   * Fixed crew calculations in the excel version
   * Fixed missile design MFD bug
   * Added missile MFD range selection
   * Fixed missile laser communicator placement
   * Fixed primitive thrust agencies
   * Added AND primitive thrust agency
   * Fixed life support costs

The most notable omission from the above list is the weapon range
question. I\'ve made no changes to how my spreadsheet handles ranges,
because the verdict is still out as to how it should be handled.
Basically, if you pick FF&S ranges, the weapons center on a 1-2-4-8
progression and get a 50kkm beam pointer...if you pick SSDS ranges the
weapons center on a 10-20-40-80 progression and get a 500kkm beam
pointer. This should probibly be changed in some fashion, to allow
designers to tailor the design to specific weapons. However, since we
don\'t have a combat system yet, I\'m going to leave it be for now. As
soon as something is finalized, I will make every effort to implement it
in the spreadsheet.

Also, I have not added calculations for penetration yet, again, because
I don\'t know if the combat system is going to use it. If the answer
comes back "yes" to penetration, it will be added.

You can download this updated spreadsheet at my site:

Let them kill the wrong people, make sure there somewhere with a navel
base, and get a BattleRon to turn up, with accompanying mariens, and
either blow them to hell if they don\'t surrender, of capture them and let
them rot in jail, or even get them to play Prison Planet (no weapons,
takes ages of game time, teaches them role playing) if they get out they
will be hunted accross the Imperium, so makeing big splashes with high
powered weapons is going to draw attention to them selves, and they will
start out pennyless anyway. The next time they use big guns, just have a
squadron of the local navy turn up and arrest them again, or blow them
away for good.

Hope this gives you some idears ...

If I remember correctly, the Annic Nova moved at much less than 1 G - perhaps
a tenth of a G or even less. Those low accelerations are certainly practical
with a docking ring. As for larger ones - the docking ring can hold the shuttle
in place when the ship is accelerating at 6G (or maybe more - let\'s say 10
to make the math easy) in general; so by symmetry the ring should be able to
hold the shuttle when it\'s pushing the ship at 1 G *as long as the shuttle is 
10% of the mass of the ship or more*. 

Alternatively, use grapples; it\'s pretty clear (since you can use grapples
for modules/pods) that they can take the strain.

Chem lasers in FFS/FFS2 actually become possible at TL 10 (although I think,
like most lasers, they get a big boost going to TL12.) 

In the Real World, the first operational laser wpns will be chemical; 
I would modify FFS2 by allowing chemical lasers at TL8 (100 kg/Mj) and
TL9 (10 kg/Mj).

 One of the things I have had as a standard in my game is the \'Scout Races\'.
I\'m thinking of trying to work it up as a written adventure - but I haven\'t had
a lot of time lately.

The basics are this:

3 to 4 times a year, somewhere in the Sector there is a high stakes race.
Officially, this is discouraged by the Scouts - usually there is damage either
to one or more ships, or to the scouts that pilot them.  Unofficially - it is
tolerated because it continues the training of scouts,  and adds to the mystique
(which is a effective recruiting tool -ask the Marines!).

The NPC - Black Harry is the guy who organizes the Race is a retired scout who
got his hands on a X-Boat Tender.  He uses this to make high performance
modifications to the Scout ships (at a profit), serves as the base of operations
for the race (and the party after the race) and generally has a good time living
in retirement.

The Hook - Black Harry gets 50% of all the entry fees (he has expenses).  He
then gives 75% of the remaining amount to the winner, 15% to second place, and
10% to third.  (if 20 ships are in the race, he gets 5 million, 1st place gets
1.875 MCr, 2nd place gets .375 MCr, and third place gets .25 MCr.

The Catch - the entry fee is 50,000 credits (figure on 15-20 ships in the
race).  Also, the location of the race is a guarded secret - asking around in
needed (formidible streetwise roll, +1 DM if starport B+, +2 DM if there is a
military base, +3 if there is a scout base.)

The Race - varies - I have used the race through the Asteroid belt (all the way)
in the past, I am currently gearing up for a \'capture the flag\' type race, where
they start at an outer gas giant, stealth through the system to the mainworld,
land at a pre-designated spot (and receive the final destination from someone
waiting there), then stealth back out.  Detection during the trip would count
against you, boarding and/or interception would disqualify you.

There are all kinds of possibilties available - for personal combat (someone
really doesn\'t want you to race), to sabotage (or counter-sabotage), to
ship-to-ship combat - it can be fun!

I\'m looking for figs suitable for scifi (Traveller or our new scifi

I like the WBH approach. It groups TL into areas that player characters
actually buy. What TL goods are available, not necessarily the
manufacturing ability. This may not be what you want if you\'re into a
Pocket Empires campaign, or want to fiddle every little part of a ff&s
design... (frighteningly, that appears to be Eris\' desire. I\'m not
surprised. ;-) )

As for calculating cost difference, one thing to consider is that the
Novelty TL is the TL of imported goods, so one can use the exchange rate
chart (by TL and starport) to calculate the cost of those goods.

Not true. Your ability to make small radios *does* affect your ability
to make computers. Witness the evolution of vacuum tube -> transistor ->
integrated circuit. All components of radios *and* computers.

Your ability to make Quake is a different animal. That\'s Software
Engineering TL. Perhaps *that* should be a different group. Or perhaps
it should be grouped under a Mathematics/Logic TL. :)

I agree. There are more important factors that influence price.

Interesting. One mechanic for building "ease of use" into the game would
be extra penalties for unskilled/low skilled users when using a low
"ease of use" item, and bonuses when using a high "ease of use" item.

Here\'s a brainstorm. What if you rated equipment with 3 "attributes":

Cost         -- Self explanatory
Quality      -- Quality of manufacture, wear and tear. Items not
maintained 
                properly would be of lower Quality.
Ergonomics   -- That elusive "ease of use" factor.

You could rate them on a 1d6 scale, or -- knowing you\'re a fan of FUDGE,
Eris -- the Terrible-Superb scale.

To simulate the Engineer\'s old saw, "Pick two", you would have a set
number of points to allocate to all three. So average CQE, or good C,
average Q and poor E, etc.

Or, drop Cost as an attribute, and devise a formula to calculate Cost
variation based on Quality and Ergonomics. That\'s probably a better
approach.

One would need a table to show the effects of quality and ergonomics on
the task roll, maintenance, performance, etc... back in January I posted
a rough draft of my ideas for a quality table. If you\'re interested I
could send it directly or repost.

I just recently picked up Fire, Fusion and Steel for T4 with the intent 
of building some ships, guns and vehicles for a pocket empire I\'m working 
on.  FF&S was, for me, the only redeeming aspect of Traveller: The New 
Error, and I was excited that it had been redone for T4.

However, there are a few symbols in the formulae that I don\'t understand, 
and I was wondering if someone here could help.  If you refer to equation 
55 on page 96, this one features all the myster symbols.  Specifically, 
what does the double-headed arror mean, what does the line through the V 
mean (is it just a long negative, or does it have another meaning?), and 
the check mark at the end and the 90 degree angle with an arrowhead on 
the end.  What do all these mean?

Thanks in advance,

Suggest you land them on a planet that has a virus that is tailor-made to
destroy technology.  See the book, "Web of the Chosen" by Jack L. Chalker.
A religious group with a sentient computer landed on this planet a century
or so earlier, and unbeknownst to the people on the colony ship, it\'s
computer began interpreting \'scripture\' in it\'s own way, and designed a
\'virus\' that it could control to dissolve non-natural occuring substances.
It does not show up on any form of scan, and can eventually dissolve
anything technological.  It also eventually changes the \'people\' into a
tailor-made sentient species much more devoted to biblical \'paradise\'.  You
need to read this book to get the full gist of it.  But I gurantee it will
throw your FGMPers a loop or two.  :)  Soon they\'ll be sitting up and doing
some REAL role playing to get out of this predicament.  :)

The Sword Worlds are recieveing extensive support from the Zhodani,
espeically in terms of Naval tonnage.  The 43rd (Lunion) and 100th
(Glisten) Fleets are in for a shock when the Confederation Force:Space
comes across the border.

The SWC plan depends on catching the Imperium off balance, by way of a
grand maskirova.  Increasing attacks by pirates and the Ine Givar, support
of dissident groups and criminal organizations, even clogging the Imperial
courts with claims against various government offcials.

Other than the need to hold down the flank for their Zhodani allies, the
High Command sees Villis as unnecessary.

The Sword World position on the Darrians is "someday, but not today."  They
are content to wait until the tiome is ripe and the Imperium is unable to
respond.

Lunion is the heart of the plan.  By taking the Lunion cluster, they cut
the Spinward Main isolating the Spin/Rimward portions of the Sector.

Part of the paln is to incite very bad feelings between Lunion and
Strouden, resulting in a reluctance to send Colonial forces to the aid of
the capital.

District 268 is to absorbed in a later operation, currently scheduled for

Thank you.  I\'ve played 5FW on a map of the entire sector with additional
units to represent the additional fleets.. when the SWC has the option of
acting in a way not dictated by the map (i.e., try to take Lanth and
Garda-Villis), they become a wild card to be repsected.

So did the Imperium.

My own belief is that "weapons" shouldn\'t be a seperate category.  If you\'re
going to use a category system like this, then weapons should be assigned
Tech Levels in different categories, but that can tend to get complicated
(unless you\'re making your own weapons from something like 3G3 or FFS/FFS2).

For example, an M-16 rifle might be Materials 7, Drives 6 (using the Drives
category to cover propellant here)...

I mainly say this because most weapons are merely an extension of other
developments.  The TL system I toyed with briefly (for a space strategy
wargame, not really Traveller), was:

Physics
Energy
Materials
Biotech
Nanotech (Sort of an extension of both materials and biotech, but I thought
it warranted its own category for game balance)
Electronics

And, um, I think there were a few others, but I forget now.  But, by my
reasoning, different things would come up at different tech levels throughout
the game.  Sufficiently high physics and energy TLs would allow the creation
of plasma guns, fusion guns, and eventually capital ship-type particle
weapons.  Biotech and materials TLs would allow the creation of life ships,
and larger colonies and such, Biotech, electronics and materials TLs would
come up with powered armor suits and such...

But, yeah, that\'s sort of what I\'m getting at :)

This is, IMO, the interesting part. I never could quite connect why all
that interstellar commerce stopped. I mean, sure, the economy was bad, but
how was that stopping each and every interstellar trip? The idea that
regional states were engaging in extensive commerce raiding, motivated
by power-hungry rivals for the Irridium Crown really works for me.

Piracy in the 3I ain\'t goin\' to have nothin\' on the pirates from -1900.

Also, you describe what happened in the Rim, but what about the other=20
major 2I centers, like Vland? Did these areas follow the same pattern
of breakdown into smaller states before all the major worlds became
isolationist?

Anyway, awesome stuff,
Ethan

- ----

The standard-issue infantry weapon in the modern Sayat military.  While not
especially powerful, nor useful for area-suppression fire, this carbine is
noteworthy for its extreme durability and reliability.  The body itself is
rugged, and like its ancient Terran namesake, nicely accessorizes
any melee combat situation.  The accurate marksmanship stressed by Sayat
military training is greatly enhanced by the capabilties of this weapon,
which includes a bipod mount and a telescopic scope.

Its small size and folding stock permit use as a handgun as well, with
reduced range; at closer ranges it can be a particularly deadly weapon
(approximately double damage under 90 meters).

The Marines in 2 had pretty high tech and I didn\'t see anything in
this one that was that much better than 2.  But they were outnumbered
and on unfamiliar turf.

Not to start another ST debate, but he was outside controlled space
doing illegal experiments.  Ignoring the other inconsistancies, he did
good by sending the crew home, they could always try the \'I was only
following orders\' line to see if it would protect them.  And it didn\'t
appear that he was trying to get out himself.  Since being courts
martialed for losing the ship would have been the least of the
charges!

Just an addition to Lim\'s comment/request. Are there any mini companies out
there making suitable 15 mm minis. I have a mess of Fasa and original deck
plans and maps made in 1/2 inch scale for use with 15 mm, unfortunately the
dozen or so Martian Metals minis that have survived numerous moves and
storage facilities are getting a bit thread bare, not to mention the lack of
variety. Please reply in private email so that we don\'t waste more

  * Weapons can have their own range brackets, 1-2-4-8 for "short-range"

  * Extra MFDs have been split into two types: Beam MFDs and Missile
MFDs. Missile MFDs include a laser commo.
  * A macro has been added that allows you to copy the base TL to all

activate the macro.
  * USPs are now calculated using the SSDS errata as far as ROF is
concerned (10=-1, 50=0, 100=+1, etc..)
  * And missile design is finally working, with the new AND drive type.
You can now design your own custom missiles.

  This version also corrects all of the bugs that I am aware of. Thank
you to all the people who have offered advice, criticisms and bug
reports.

Many thanks to Bruce Alan Macintosh for the great deal of help he

The transistors you use in a computer and the ones you use in a radio
are pretty different. Now, it may seem silly, but just because you
invented Bipolar devices doesn\'t mean you\'ve invented CMOS or vice-
versa. If you\'ve never been forced to sit through hour after hour
of lectures about transistors they probably seem all the same, but
really, they\'re not. (I can\'t tell the difference between a GV and a
OII star, but I\'m sure someone around here could, as an analogy).

It is, however, questionable whether this level of detail really
enhances the game.

A good idea. Odd as it may seem, a lack of a decent mathematical
background will prevent you from doing all kinds of neat stuff,
like encryption. Unfortunately, as programmers will attest, a lower
math/logic TL will translate into being able to produce more
software. ;) Abstract knowledge isn\'t usually modelled as it has
little direct bearing on what the players can and can\'t do in the 
game. 

GM: Sorry, you can\'t get a tuneable laser here.
Player: The planet is TL 15. Why not?
GM: Ah... their Math TL is only 7. They can\'t do double integrals.
Player: <slaps head>

Also, while the Pentium (or pick whatever piece of hardware you like)
may be neat, it isn\'t much without code. It is possible that you could
have hot hardware and absolute crap software (ok, no microsoft jokes)
or (again) vice-versa.

In general it is difficult to come up with realistic TL categories
because we really don\'t have a good idea of what technologies are
the real necessary preconditions for other technologies. We\'ve only
ever seen it done one way. Do you have to invent 0.1-micron IC processes
before you can do Quake 3? Or did it just work out that way here?

This would be cool, although it is a bit excessive. I mean, if you were
doing whole 8"x11" equipment sheets, a la MT, then you could get this
kind of detail in, but otherwise you\'d have descriptions for things
like knives and running shoes looking like a starship USP.

Personally, while I like the idea of a mechanic that allows you to model
crappy equipment versus good equipment, is it really practical? I mean,
do you want to tell your players "Well, you failed the task roll by one
point... you should have spent the extra cash for that really nice
Darrian PRIS instead of the cheap Sword World one...". 

<crabby>
If I want to get mad about having bought cheap, crappy equipment 
I\'ll go use my home PC, not simulate it in Traveller.

Perhaps Player Character family members?  Perhaps Noble family members
(thus making them hunted to the ends of the sector/subsector)?  Split
them up and make the \'shoot anything that moves\' mentality result in
friend fire casualties.  This is usually easier to do if you
physically separate the parties.  We used to run multimedia adventures
for Call of Cthulu and now Blue Planet with this and two or more
referees.

Then what? Spot the ones who say \'whoohoo! We whacked the wrong dudes! Now
let\'s whack the RIGHT ones!!!\' - and shoot them out of hand? 

Better yet - shoot the whole bunch and get some more pitiful worshippers!

Seriously, this kind of behavior is hard to cure. You can try the Really
Fascist approach - have the Imperial Authorities issue a Shoot on Sight
warrant on these destructive lunatics, and take them out with an OTT
combination of firepower and tactics. Then watch them rant and complain,
refuse to compromise and say \'OK - I\'m trying for a little realism here.
You want on the \'most wanted\' list, you got it. But this is what happens.\' 
You\'ll lose half the players, of course, and have a huge argument to boot,
but maybe the fallout will contain something good.

Or here\'s an alternative I did for Morrow Project. 150 years after a
nuclear holocaust, the few scattered Morrow Teams are trying to put America
back together, against hopeless odds (Rather like TNE in some ways). Our
team (heavily armed and leaning towards the action-adventure side, fresh
from a shootout with some REALLY vicious beasties) drove into a deserted
town. Just smalltown USA. There\'s nothing here. Oh, they went looking,
searching for the secret base, the cannibal tribe, the rad-cockroaches.
Nothing.

Just an oversized graveyard, extended down the hill from the little wooden
church. Just a brooding emptiness where people once lived. Just three
desiccated bodies lying in the church and a plastic-wrapped notebook
telling how a bio-weapon infected the town. The folks stayed to die rather
than leave and risk infecting others - killed a few of their own to keep
the infection in. Buried the bodies until the last three were too weak to
dig any more. Wrote their records - named every grave - and slowly died.

All they left behind was the notebook, explaining what they\'d done, and
expressing the hope that they had saved a few lives by not spreading the
plague. The characters knew otherwise, but saluted the sentiments behind
the last phrase in the book - \'May God Have Mercy. We did what we could.\'

Three very sober characters gently carried the bodies outside and buried
them with their townsfolk, buried the book with them, and traveled on.
Their goal was to put civilisation back together again - and to see that
this never happened again.

I really didn\'t know if I\'d get away with it. An adventure with no NPCs, no
gunfight, no challenge, just an empty town and three corpses? Real
munchkins would snarl and complain, but a player worth having would respond
to this sort of thing.

Why not give it a try?

VDS1.0 Vehicle Design System by Greg Porter, BTRC

A brief review by Bertil Jonell (d9bertil@dtek.chalmers.se)

  Even Briefer: Greg Porter\'s vehicle design system is finally here, but I\'d
take late and good over crap in time for Gencon anyday:) Funny how all the good
stuff tend to come from small companies like BTRC or Pagan, but I digress.
  Does VDS do for vehicles what Greg Porter\'s Guns! Guns! Guns! (aka 3G3) did
for guns? I think so, yes. Even without taking into account that the area
\'vehicles\' is quite a bit larger than the area \'guns\' I give it a 4.7 out of 5,
and taking it into account a 5 out of 5.

  My Bias: I\'m a long time dyed in the wool BTRC fan, with a equally long
history of pestering Greg Porter with questions and unsolicited advice:)

  Format: The format of VDS is odd: it is only available in electronic format,
as a 4.6 meg Acrobat file (or as a 2.5 meg Acrobat file without the color
backgrounds on the chapter intro pages). The reason why it isn\'t in print
is said to be a combination of the hike in paper costs and that it is a
niche product.
  VDS is 162 pages long, some paragraphs are color-coded just like in the
CORPS 2nd Edition rules. There is a fair number of illustrations and diagrams,
and an abnormal (for being an BTRC product:) number of photographs (each
chapter intro, plus some others).

  Caveat: VDS is designed for CORPS, and it isn\'t as generic as 3G3. IMHO those
CORPS nutshell rules that BTRC gives away for free and the conversion notes in
3G3 should contain most of the information one needs to use VDS designs in other
systems (basically armour/weapon data to get a feel for what CORPS Armour Values
and Damage Values correspond to in other systems, as well as a short explanation
of the CORPS skill system).

  Disposition: Intro, nine chapters, eight sample designs, collected reference
tables, and three design forms:
    Special intro to the .pdf edition, 1 page
    Contents, 1 page
    Intro, 3 pages               Definitions, Hints and Author\'s Notes.
    Performance, 7 pages         What do you want out of the vehicle?
    Power Plant, 11 pages        The thing that makes it move.
    Power Train, 19 pages        The things that turn power into motion.
    Structure, 12 pages          Internal structure, Accomodations, Facilites,
                                 Crew.etc
    Surface Treatments, 15 pages Armour, Turrets, Streamlining, Waterproofing,
                                 Lifting surfaces etc
    Accessories, 26 pages        Controls, Computers, Sensors, Safety and
                                 Security equipments, Manipulators, Spare
                                 Parts, Life Support, Climate Control etc^2.
    Weapons, 3 pages (sic!)      A very elegant formula, and tables with 
                                 examples. Of course the whole 3G3 is
                                 available for this purpose:)
    Combat, 10 pages             Extends the CORPS combat system to cover
                                 vehicles betters.
    Campaigning, 18 pages        Vehicles from the roleplaying perspective.
    Sample Vehicles, 8 pages     TL  3 Trireme
                                 TL  5 DaVinci War Wagon
                                 TL  7 Armored Frigate (the Gloire)
                                 TL  9 Jet Fighter (Me-262)
                                 TL 11 Tank (M1A2)
                                 TL 13 Interstellar Freighter
                                 TL 15 Hypersonic Interceptor
                                 TL 17 Assassin Android
    Reference Tables, 30 pages...Various tables to make life easier for those
                                 who don\'t like equations. For example top speed
                                 as a function of power and vehicle mass.
  Each chapter (except the Intros, the Sample Vehicles, and the Reference 
Tables) concludes with a \'Am I doing This Right?\' page with sample
calculations using the stuff in the chapter in question.

  Specifics:
  Being Generic: I was pretty doubtful wether it was even *possible* to make a
truly generic vehicle design system. The previous attempts that I\'ve seen was
either too specific, or too wrong (and far too often both). But VDS pulls it
off. Let me illustrate with examples from the Power Plant and Power Train
chapters. The base output per kilo of power plant is Tech Level squared. This
is multiplied with the Type of the power plant, which is one of Biologic,
Durable (for example diesel or steam), Normal (auto engine), Enhanced (sports
car), Exotic (race car, jet, gas turbine), Dangerous (rocket engine), Extremely
Dangerous (nuclear), or Suicidal (antimatter), each with their output modifier,
cost multiplier, fuel consumption, and maintainance interval.
  (This is actually the first vehicle design system that I\'ve seen that
introduces maintainance and durability as important design parameter in its 
own right. Several other design systems ignore it, or at best has something
tacked on like an afterthought that doesn\'t work well with the rest of the 
system.)
  Fuels are also rated in (similar) types, and hot stuff (like LOX and LHyd:
type Dangerous (cryogenic fluids at high pressures) naturally gives better
fuel performance but are quite troublesome to handle, and disastrous during
accidents).
  Several normal types of power plants are illustrated, along with special
subjects like the need for cooling, mixed fuels, reaction engines (yes, you
can design a NERVA, a PLUTO or a compared to them almost mundane solid fuel
ramjet), startup times, starter engines, the often overlooked fact that a
gas turbine doesn\'t deliver electricity directly, batteries, solar power, 
wind power (the sails are the engine, and the masts are the power train), and
magic power.
  The section on magical powerplants also include a rather interesting
discussion on the sale price of zombies, as well magic powerplants that 
work through voluntary or involuntary draining, and the effects on the
victims.
  Power Trains are apart from the rocket engines, divided into Wheels, Tracks,
Legs (small, medium or large feet), Indirect to Dense Medium (ie water: 
propellers, paddles, oars for zombie oarsmen), Indirect to Average Medium,
Indirect to Thin Medium (ie air: props, jets, turbofans, ducted fans), and 
the perennial favourite Antigrav.
  (One of those Venetian small boats would be a boat propelled by a leg
(the pole) for example).
  Special topics in the Power Train chapter are secondary power trains 
(like amphibious APC\'s), Earthborers, Hovercrafts, Articulated Vehicles, 
Jump Jets, Jump Drive, Railroads and Monorails, Towing, Antigrav and
Artificial gravity.
  (Especially Nice Point: The rocket engines use specific impulses. The
treatment of rockets in 3G3 has previously been a pet peeve of mine:)

  The Campaigning chapter is another high point of VDS. It holds hints and
advice on using vehicles as settings, antagonists, objects of adventure, 
transports, and money sinks. Stuff about doing tricks with or on the outside
of vehicles, commercial and legal considerations.
  Building vehicles gets several dedicated pages, how long it takes, how much 
it costs, (see also \'vehicle as a money sink\'), how big a workforce is needed
etc, along with standardization, modular components, warranties, markup, and
the various bugs that might plague the new design, ranging from the humorous
via the annoying to the instantly lethal.

  (Another Especially Nice Point: Greg Porter has finally included a 40mm
automatic cannon. It is however a bit too heavy compared to the original)

  Customizability: How easy is it to hammer VDS into something usable for a 
specific background, and how easy is it to hammer something that doesn\'t exist
in VDS into it? Pretty easy IMHO. I tried to design a TL 10 turret-less tank
with a glacis sloped at 88 degrees and a fixed gun aimed by manipulating the
suspension, and it came out rather close to the original Strv 103. There is
even a bug on the bug table that matches the one the 103 suffers from in real
life:) (2 x double suspension maintainance required)

  Downsides: First of all, the lack of an alphabethic index. This is especially
noticeable if you print it out (like I did after the first reading), but even in
its electronic format the presence of a \'Find...\' function in Acroread doesn\'t
entirely remove the need for an index. If I am looking for the price of spare
parts it is much easier to find it as a subheading under \'Spare Parts\' than try
to figure out what exact search string to use: -0.10
  The lack of an index is made more severe by a slightly confused organisation
compared to 3G3. I\'ll admit that gun design is a much more linear subject, and
that it is hard to present such a wide and interrelated subject as vehicle 
design in a linear manner. But I still don\'t like that some Power Train cost
multipliers are found in the \'Performance\' chapter: -0.10
  Autoloaders: No rules for autoloaders for large caliber weapons. Too big for
3G3 the main focus of which was smallarms, so it should have been found in VDS
but it isn\'t: -0.10
  Stabilization: The treatment of stabilization is strange.
  Sloped Armour: There should have been an equation for an arbitary slope in
addition to the values given in the table (the thickness multiplier is 
1/cos(slope), and the extra vehicle dimension is tan(slope)/2).

I always assumed that computers in this sense refers to early AI =

A game is a collaborative effort between the players and the GMs.  If
you have a problem with the way they are playing, you owe it to them
to _tell_them_ rather than running them into a brick wall.  Preferably
without calling them munchkins to their face, that\'s a good way to
lose players instead of changing them.  Then, give them a chance to
change.  If they fail to change, run them into a brick wall.

Suggestions:

Tell the players that their enemies will be balanced for their power
level.  If they go buy PGMP or FPMG, their opponents will probably be
armed with the equivalent.  If they _fail_ to buy them, their
opponents will be appropriately armed.  Then do it (and make sure
their large-damage weapons damage and destroy their opponents\' weapons
as well as their opponents).  Acquiring arms and armor is suddenly
pointless - they have to think about what to do with the money.

When it comes time to brick-wall them, consider carefully the results
you want, then figure out how to do it.  What do they care about?
Each other?  Not likely.  Their stuff?  Yup.  But if you just "take it
away", their reaction will be to say "awww, that\'s no fair.  We had no
chance."  Even if they had a chance.

Just damage their stuff.  Make them realize that the new equipment is
defective... occasionally fails to fire, for example, or has bad aim.
Of course they bought it someplace with a no-returns policy, and
defenses which become obvious and then give them a chance to slip away
(after all, the propieter doesn\'t want to have to deal with the cops
either).

Look at their ship.  Use a (gasp!) rigged space combat to pound it
into a hulk at the hands of a pirate.  The point at which their ship
is suitably damaged, their shots get through to something vital and
the pirate explodes.  Use care that they don\'t see it was rigged (like
roll _all_ the dice out of their sight, and make sure the pirate shows
damage too).  From then on, they\'re constantly repairing parts of
their ship... that should be a nice big money sink until they realize
that they need to roleplay to get money again.  Who knows, they might
limp in to have their ship declared "not spaceworthy until this, that,
and that are repaired" - no cargo for you until you do.  Hrm, what\'re
you going to sell to get the money?

Turn their tech against them.  If they all have IR/low light goggles,
consider putting them in a situation where the lighting is designed to
foil such (a military or para-military complex might have such), but
naked eyes work acceptably.  Use EMP on their equipment - but they
won\'t find out what works until they try; for this intermittent
failures are even better than breakage.  I don\'t recall if Traveller
has things where tech lets you get skills (like Gurps Space\'s chip
slots), but consider what _else_ could be granted by such.  Say, a
driving imperative to kill a specific person, accompanied with "don\'t
let anyone know, don\'t take out the chip".


Put them in a limited-area mystery.  Example setting: waterey planet.
They are invited out to dinner by a prospective client, or as a "thank
you" from a passenger after a rather hectic (pirate-infested) trip (in
which their ship may have been punded into a wreck, so they may hope
that this rich passenger will give them more money).  The "restraunt"
is essentially a very lare underwater structure on treads - it rolls
out to give the diners a nice view of the exotic underwater life.
Four hours or so from shore, there\'s a murder - possibly of their
host.  Be sure you\'ve taken the time to write up the personalities of
the various people on board, and what they want.  Everybody should be
up to _something_, from smuggling to shady deals, to political stuff,
to wanting a promotion within the ship\'s crew....  It\'s hard, but it
is possible that they find the roleplaying adventures boring because
they, well, are.  Besides, anything which doesn\'t come up during the
adventure can be re-used.  Make sure the mystery can be solved, even
if they miss a few clues (because they _will_ miss a few clues).


What do they want?  They may want to impress the other players.  Let
one of them pull a gun in this restraunt.  Pass him a note which says
"That gun would probably go through both the target and the hull -
that\'d be _really_bad_."  Now he knows something the other players
doesn\'t, and if you\'re lucky will use the fact to impress the other
players with his "forethought" (ie, not actually firing the gun).
Even though it wasn\'t quite what you had in mind (you didn\'t want any
guns down here anyway),  reward him for not firing with a clue to the
mystery.  Perhaps he scared the person enough for him to let something
slip, perhaps one of the people running from the area ran in the wrong
direction....


Use the character backgrounds.  If they don\'t have them, warn them
that you\'ll make it.  If they do, figure out interesting and
unexpected ways to fill in the holes.  Have a sister appear.  Uncle\'s
company\'s rival corp might decide to use the PCs against him.  God,
the possibilities are endless....  I once had someone want to play an
amnesiac.  My, was he surprised when he discovered (3 real-time months
later) that he wasn\'t even human.


Good luck.  It can be done.  Once it is done, you can give them
resources again.

	How about targets that big guns won\'t work on?  Big swarms of
really ugly little critters who are attracted by stray electromagnetic
current... and who attack by spraying sticky corrosive gunk that their
decontam airlock can\'t handle.  Or better yet, the electromagnetic current
triggers their mating urge, and their technotoys get covered in a thick
layer of (sticky, corrosive, smelly) alien, er, secretions and critters who
died exhausted but happy.

	Or herds of very large carnivores who stampede them for similar
reasons.

	Or if they aren\'t too physics-savvy to figure out whether this can
work or not (I\'m not), just have a local planetary magnetosphere so strong
that it interferes with proper functioning of the weapon; blasts don\'t
travel straight, or the magnetic bottle deteriorates or _fails to form
altogether_ <boom>.

	If that isn\'t believable, have the bad guys in possession of some
TL-19 device that has the same effect.  If the players capture it, make
sure that they can\'t learn how to operate it.

	Or just put them in a situation that they clearly can\'t shoot their
way out of without winding up dead and have to negotiate their way out.

	Or have them hired by a patron who can\'t stand guns and whose
delicate sensing equipment suffers from interference whenever a FGMP is
powered up.

	Or have them attacked by a bunch of PMPP-wielding Sayat pirates.
If they survive, and the sarcasm goes miles over their heads, do not warn
them about the recoil when they attempt to use captured units.

	Or get some players whose mental age is over 13.

The best solution remain ultimately to have a realistic universe with
realistic people and worlds.  AD&D players may succeed with violence (or
more precisely, violence is a realistic solution in AD&S because of the
nature of most of the universes).  This is not the case with Traveller.  =
On
the other hand, the solutions above are only available if you game in a
civilized area (like the Spinward Marches or the Solomani Rim).  Most of
the solutions  will not work in a Virus infected wilds.

This has been an... enlightening thread.

Don\'t get me wrong, I highly discourage my players from test-firing their high
energy weapons in shopping malls, but I do let them (occasionally) acquire
them.  I do run games (infrequently) where the side with the biggest bang wins.
If nothing else, it\'s a great money sink.  Buying PGMPs and FGMPs on the black
market is not a cheap thing.  Recently, my players bought one of those cargo
handlers, just so they could start training in it (they hope to acquire
battledress in the future).  They are currently engaged in the purchase of 4
armed grav-carriers which they are going to try and smuggle into a Amber Zone
(and supply to the insurgents there).  Up front cost to them is in the area of
2.0 MCr - Profit (if everything is as it is reputed to be... ;) will be about
6.0 MCr over and above expected costs  (they have not figured in ship damage - I
think they are hoping for the best).  I\'ve used two gaming session just setting
up the meet, and now the purchase.  I expect to get 1 more in scouting out the
buyer, and at least 1 to get the ship in and past the customs and defense
patrols.  Will they get to play with some big guns?  Yer darn tootin!  Will they
need to fire them guns?  Only if someone screws the pooch in a major way...
(One of the questions they asked in a planning session was \'how will we be sure
they will pay once we are there?\'  The answer [much to my amusement] \'man the
grav-carriers!\')

There are many positive ways of channeling the players into a more constructive
groove, but just \'stomping\' on \'em is not the path I would choose.  This is not
meant as a critism, just an observation and a remark on the variety of campaign
structures that exist.  I do tend to run adventures that skirt the edge (and
beyond) of legality, but that is where my players enjoy the game.  And, I don\'t
know about the rest of ya, I tend to enjoy games more when the people I\'m
playing with enjoy it (tho\' it\'s a well known fact of life in my games - when I
start laughing, they are in serious, serious trouble).

GDW _was_ to have produced a TNE book something akin to "Ships of the

Wiseman mentioning on this list that he was working on the Aurora...
I wonder if the outlines still exist?

technology, especially at early levels ... the actual engineering
may be different, but the basic concepts are the same.

	There are no Microsoft jokes, it\'s all true.

Well, you could steal an idea from "Rocket Jockey". I know that the old
Triplanetary game used the scenario.

You have a system with several planets. At least 8 or 9. Everbody
launches from the mainworld, and has to land (to check in) at each
planet (or the major moons in the case of gas giants). The one who
visits all of the planets in the least time wins.

Note that the only "order" required is that you start and end at the
mainworld. 

They key here is being able to accurately plot the movement of the
planets and moons. Because even with thruster plates, the planets and
moons are going to move *noticeably* in the course of the race. 

So the racers have to figure where things will be when they get there.
And you\'ll need ruules for close approaches to the star and the gas
giants. After all, someone may decide that a path that sdkims one or
the other is the key to winning.

This *requires* course plotting. And just think of the fun if you are
"commited" to heading for a planet and then discover that someone
jimmied the fuel gauge. :-)

IMO that is far too early for the collapse to begin. The RoM holds together
for more than four centuries.

I\'ve always assumed that each Emperor named his or her successor, the way
the Flavian emperors of Rome did (I do mean the Flavians, don\'t I?).

This is not really a recipe for a 300 year slow collapse. I think that
you\'d either get a long war or series of wars with a complete breakdown
at the end or a long war with a resulting new, strong Imperial line.

I don\'t thinki your take on the TMC is completely compatible with the
official sources, but as I don\'t have the books with me, I may be
mistaken. I do remember that there are some problems with the various
official dates.

Here is my suggestion for resolving the various dates and events given for
Terra, the Terran Mercantile Community, the Old Earth Union, the Rule of
Man and such. (Btw. they were submitted to _The Traveller Chronicle_ and
several of them (naturally I can\'t remember which, sorry) were printed in
the Gralyn issue (#7), so they are at least semi-official (depends on how
official you think TTC is)). (Also note that some sentences were lifted
verbatim from _Solomani_).

LIBRARY DATA:

OLD EARTH UNION: Interstellar government from -1110 to 588 compri-
sing  Terra  and  the  worlds  closest to her:  Barnard,  Calgary,
Dismal,  Ember,  Fenris,  Forlorn,  Hades,  Heiphaistos,  Inferno,
Junction,  Loki,  Midway,  Peraspera,  Prometheus,  Sirius and Ys.
Fleet bases were also maintained at Aggida,  Markhashi, and Meshan
- -  all within jump-3 of Terra  -  but  these systems were not con-
sidered  part  of the Union proper;  Agidda was a balkanized world
and  thus  unable to send representatives to the Union Council and
both  Markhashi and Meshan had been abandoned during the recession
that followed the fall of the Rim Province (qv.) in -1690.
    The  OEU  was  formed  in  -1110  out of the Terran Mercantile
Community  (qv.)  as  a response to worsening economic conditions.
Although  experiencing some problems  -  a short, vicious tradewar
with  the  newly  formed  Dingir League  from -1106 to -1098 put a
severe  strain  on  both  sides  -  the Union proved strong enough
to  defend  itself  from any serious threat during the rest of the
Long Night,  and  in  588  it was peacefully incorporated into the
Imperium.


REAVERS:  Towards  the end of Twilight,  some of the less affected
states  in outlying sectors turned to plundering old Terran Confe-
deration worlds that had lost interstellar ship technology.  These
plunderers  were called Reavers and differed from ordinary pirates
in preying on whole worlds.  This lent their name a special horror
that has clung to it down to modern days. Most of the Reavers came
from Dark Nebula,  Alpha Crucis,  Magyar,  and of course, Reavers\'
Deep.
    Some historians hold that the Reaver era ended in -1118 when a
Reaver  fleet  from  the Opljiok Defense League lost two thirds of
its  ships in an attack on Jarslav.  With the Aslans becoming ever
stronger  the various Reaver states in Magyar and Dark Nebula grew
unwilling to risk such losses.
    On  the other hand,  the name continued to be applied to inde-
pendent warlords who,  escaping with loyal fleet elements from the
breakup  or  takeover  of  a small state with a few working ships,
could easily make their way into the Great Unknown and have a good
chance of dominating one or several primitive planets. Some of the
most notorious Reaver lords like Blackjack Duquesne, Orchid Lu Wu,
and Grand Admiral Izanak belong to the period from -1120 to -1000.
    During  the  latter  half of the Long Night it became usual to
label  any  opponent a Reaver,  thereby justifying practically any
treatment of that opponent.


RIM PROVINCE: Administrative division of the Second Empire compri-
sing most of the defunct Terran Confederation. It is, depending on
what historian you ask, either one of the first or one of the last
parts of the Rule of Man to succumb to the Long Night.  It was one
of the first areas to loose contact with Hub;  in -1854 the second
new  governor  sent  out  from  Hub failed to reach the province\'s
capital, Dingir,  and Acting Governor Ayara Twofeathers instituted
the  custom  of  Governor-appointed successors,  a system that was
kept to the end of the provincial government.
    The  lessening  flow  of commerce between the rim and the core
was  already  rendering  taxes  more and more meaningless,  and 16
years later the province ceased to remit taxes to Hub except on an
intermittent  basis.  For a while Dingir tried to keep up payments
in the form of precious metals and gems, but when the third of the
treasure  fleets  carrying these payments failed to return,  these
too were discontinued.
    On  the  other hand,  the government at Dingir kept ruling "in
the  name of the Emperor" for another century and a half,  keeping
the  peace  and  enforcing  Rule of Man regulations.  It collapsed
finally in -1690, when a huge budget deficit forced the government
to  decommision  two  thirds  of  the already decimated provincial
fleets  and  turn  over the rest to various individual planets and
the Terran Mercantile Community (qv.).


TERRAN MERCANTILE COMMUNITY:  Loose  trade  association  formed in
- -1862  by Terra and her closest ex-colonies that later grew into a
corporation.  Ostensibly a purely commercial organisation,  it was
actually a means of circumventing Rule of Man prohibitions against
member  planets having their own navies.  The TMC built a merchant
fleet  that  toed  a  very  fine line between commercial ships and
naval vessels.  The ships carried enough armament to protect them-
selves  from pirates and raiders,  but not enough to classify them
as  naval vessels.  Their merchant fleet made Terra and her fellow
worlds in the TMC a formidable commercial force.
    When  the  Rule of Man  in  the form of the Rim Province (qv.)
collapsed  in  -1690,  The Terran Mercantile Community had a space
fleet  to  patrol  its  systems and to replace the now gone Second
Empire fleets.  The TMC\'s merchant fleet cushioned the blow of the
Long Night  and  made it possible for Terra to survive in relative
comfort.
    The  TMC  took  over  many of the functions of the Rule of Man
(though abandoning the extreme edges of the old Rim Province), but
was  careful  at first not to assume the mantle of government.  By
avoiding  the appearance of ruling it avoided alienating the other
planets and driving them into forming their own unions. Relying on
the  protection  of the TMC ships were cheaper than building their
own,  and  the  TMC  itself  took  pains  not to be percieved as a
threat.
    For  several  centuries the TMC managed to maintain this deli-
cate balance,  but the steadily worsening commercial climate even-
tually  forced them to retrench.  Like the Rim Province before it,
the  TMC  found  the  strain of protecting the furthest worlds too
much of a burden. From -1500 on other Rule of Man successor states
in Alpha Crucis,  Dark Nebula,  Magyar and Reavers\' Deep routinely
raided worlds on the fringe of the TMC sphere (see _Reavers_), but
although  this  was a contributing strain,  it was not the primary
factor. The Reaver Era ended before the end of the TMC, and Reaver
attacks in any case concentrated on fringe worlds that had already
been  abandoned  by the TMC and lost interstellar technology.  The
primary  factors  were  economic depression and a widespread trend
toward isolationism, causing a shift to planetary self-reliance at
the expense of interplanetary trade.
    When the worlds near Easter in -1112 formed the Easter Concord
and  other  worlds began talking of forming their own unions,  the
TMC  decided to cut its losses.  In -1110 the corporation formally
transformed  into the Old Earth Union,  abandoning all worlds out-
side the Union to their own devices,  and becoming a small,  tight
group instead of a large, loose one.
    See also: Old Earth Union.

I won\'t guarantee it, because I\'ve only done it with 600 T QSDS designs, 
but try one simple handwave: When these ships are built, they are destined
for regular scheduled flights between worlds with enough trade to keep
them filled an average of 90% on every trip _and the arrangements are
made beforehand so that the ship dosen\'t have to go looking for cargo
and passengers_! That way the ships can manage one jump per 10 days
instead of one per 14 days. Being able to make 35 trips per year instead
of 25 really helps...

IMTU Free Traders use 40+ year old ships. The brand new ships are ordered
and bought by regular companies.

IIRC there was a question about why the Imperium needed to have 
currency.  There were many answers, but I think the above gives another 
good reason.  Douglas points out that there are many instances when cash 
is all that will be accepted.  One would hate to accept a credit card 
for several million credits only to have a "stop" put on the card....  
Cash in hand means you can make a deposit elsewhere....

Which also brings to mind the entry of 6MCr into a banking system... We 
trigger taxes, reports, etc. when $10K+ is moved in our banking system, 
so what will be the response when PCs come up to the local ATM and try 
to stick in 6MCr?  How \'bout at the local branch office?  There are some 
pretty interesting questions to be answered (potentially) unless they 
also have a front company....  Otherwise you are running around with 
6MCr in cash/bearer bonds...  

This another possible device for the "bigger guns" to want to steal some 
cash from the PCs!  Let em use their big guns to defend themselves, and 
then have to answer the questions again as to why they were attacked, 
how come they had so much money...  "Rumor has it that the GravCarriers 
that have recently shifted the tide in the insurgency two systems over 
were bought for about 6MCr....  Do you know anything about that?"

What Fun!

No such thing.

There\'s a Rebellion Sourcebook which deals with the 1116 assassination of
Emperor Strephon\'s ceremonial double and the subsequent factionalization of
the Imperium.

There\'s the Spinward Marches campaign, an 8.5 x 11 CT supplement that deals
with the 5th Frontier War.

And there\'s the game Fifth Frontier War, which includes a book that is
mostly just wargame rules.

I am re-starting my "Planet X" adventure and always looking for players as 
we currently only have 2 (I can sanely cope with up to 6).  We play Tuesday 
nights starting at around 8-8:30pm EST. (What a coincidence!  That\'s 
tonight!<G>)
We usually hang out in Undernet, but we have been thinking of moving to 
myst.net.

This is a T4/M:0 campaign centered on the Deep Space Station "Planet X". 
 Home of X-TEK industries and TML pseudo-personality Commander X.  Anything 
can happen at a self-contained corporate Starport floating in deep space 2pc 
from Sylea.  Every so often The Commander makes an appearance, and once in a 
while a personality from TML/ISBA/THUDDD shows up.  Who knows maybe Hengebar 
Spofulam himself will be spending a holiday on the station, trading ideas 
for weapons of mass destruction with the Commander?

My games tend to be heavily into mystery/espionage realm, with the 
occasional firefight/starship combat encounter.  Got to keep things 
interesting after all :)

You can be any occupation available in T4, that includes the diplomat and 
bureaucrats from M:0 as well as the occupations people have put on the web. 
 I know Scott Galliand has a few new occupations on his site.  Unfortunately 
I can\'t remember the URL.

You can be any race that would have been around Imperial Space in Year 20 or 
so.  Therefore Vargr are not a problem.  Zhodani and Aslan would be 
stretching it a bit. :)

So come on over to Undernet channel #traveller tonight at 8pm EST.  This 
invite goes out to anyone on TML who wants to play as well.

Hope to see you there.

Commander X

I agree with you. Players should be able to skirt the boundary of legality
if they so choose, but if and when they do, they need to be aware of the
consequences. Getting caught selling illegal weaponry and vehicles would
carry a very heavy sentence, even death on the more autocratic worlds.

I try not to scare my players away from committing illegal or even immoral
acts if that\'s what they want to do, but they need to be aware that if they
mess up, they\'ll be in deep $#!+. (As a side note, the one act I will *not*
tolerate is a physical attack on another PC; PCs attacking PCs is very
hurtful to a campaign unless the attacked PC has done something extremely
bad.)

My players did not handle the consequences of their last moral dilemma too
well. The campaign ended up getting disrupted and ultimately it fell apart.
A referee can\'t let that deter him from making the tough call, though, even
when it means a sharp slap to the players. You end up setting a bad
precedent.

Let them take chances, but if their actions or the dice fail them, make
them pay the consequences. Besides, the consequences need not be final. Say
they *do* get caught committing a crime. The subsequent prison breakout or
"Dirty Dozen" job can make an interesting adventure.

Best,

I have been hearing this virus thing for a month or two (my entire time

What exactly is virus ? It\'s clearly some kind of computer/technology
virus, but certainly not a normal one ...

About the only \'sourcebook\' I know for the FFW are the TNS reports
collected at the IG website. The early ones are concerned with events
occurring during the FFW. the 1105-1112 entries are concerned with the
FFW and it\'s aftermath, among other things. I have the majority of that
info in a text file I can send you, or make available on my web pages. It
was a compilation of TNS articles from JTAS made by Clay Bush some years
ago.

There are essentially two strategies, depending on the players.  Either you
attempt to reform them, or you give up on them.  Giving up does not mean
ceasing Traveller, but it does mean accepting their Munchkin nature, and
not trying anything subtle.

Look at the players.  Are they munchkins because they are immature, or
because they are into violent escapism, or are they just people who like a
good adrenaline charge in their fantasy world?

Foray: fast character generation.  I often ask the players to make a
character without random results, just to see what the system allows, and
to talk out a character concept.  To do this, I tell them their stats were
determined by rolls of 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6.  They get 4 starting
skills, 1.25 skills a year, and they may not raise a skill unless they have
supporting skills at one less.  (e.g., someone with pilot 4 must have nav,
sensor, leader, or some other flight deck skill at 3, and another at 2, and
so on.  A single skill at two can support many threes, but makes it very
hard to learn more advanced skills without working on the fundamentals.)

Now, after they make this throwaway character, we talk.

Immature:

These can usually be rescued.  A good test is the character with a 12 Dex,
10 Str, 8 End, 6 Int, 4 Edu, and 2 Soc.  If the 30 year old has FGMP 5,
Rifle 4, Tactics 3, Brawling 3, Demolitions 2, and Survival 1, then I can
usually state with confidence that we have a Munchkin.

I remind the person that their low Soc indicates an inability to handle
either society or money beyond a certain level, and also makes them a babe
in the woods as far as finance, lending, and other economic machinery goes.
 Also, they have no academic ties in most cases.  (Soc 2 is the bottom 3%,
remember.)

We then discuss how the character is going to get by without a plasma gun.
He certainly will not have the money for one.  Often, they claim that they
will be working for the Noble, which the other Munchkin is playing.

Further, we discuss the criminal record that such a violent past may
indicate.  If he tells me the person is a valorous marine, I point out that
his low social standing makes significant recognition unlikely, so he might
want to be a bitter valorous marine.

Usually, about this point, the extremes get filed off, leaving only one or
two.  For example, the player will usually keep the unrecognized valorous
machine unfairly cashiered for blasting hundreds of Mekton natives into
plasma.

Then, we discuss play.

In general, karma in the world, and what goes around will come around
eventually.  This sometimes leads to somewhat bizarre actions on the part
of the players, but since they can act however they please and suffer the
consequences, it usually works.  For example, they will often be somewhat
motivated to interfere with local matters, but will balance it with self
interest.

Players who cannot deal with the standards of morality in the world do not
have fun in my games.  Rapine and torture are not used often, as they annoy
me, and it comes out in play.  Rather than just be annoyed, I tell them up
front that it offends me, so if they are going to do it, do it as carefully
as you would in a good novel.  Casual violence is casually stopped.

NB, I did have a sociopath character once who was attracted to murder,
rape, and torture.  The others knew it, and kept the character in line.  A
morbid but fun series of adventures resulted when they slipped up and he
killed a girl.  They then had to decide whether they rescued him, how they
should react, what they owed the family, etc.  They ended up signing him up
for some rather gruesome treatments to alter his personality.

The player in question and I had agreed in advance that he could certainly
scheme all he wanted, and he might just succeed.  If he did, though, the
forces of law and order might just hang him.  He thought this was a
fantastic end to the character, and a great start of a new one in the same
body.  Once they treated him, he was a very different person, who had some
of the old skills, some new ones, and all sorts of interesting personality
problems.

Adrenaline junkies, or violent escapism:

Now, what do you do if the players like destruction?  They might be mature,
but they like to game on an 8th grade level?

If they are ok with it, and willing to play complicated killers, I allow
them to do so.  They might be parts of a merc band.  They might be
assassins.  In any event, they are going to be busy.  They are expected to
be very aware of the consequences, and that they can kill all they want, as
long as it is the enemy, and not the bystanders that get flattened.

This can be fun, because we then alternate assignments, where the slaughter
can be extreme, with interaction, where it can not.  They are on liberty,
without weapons, and know they can be jailed.  Or they are on leave at
home, and they left the weapons behind.  If these are interesting, the
character of the game can change.

Anyone running under hack and slash rules is unprotected, in that i will
feel free to kill them if the dice say so.  Generally, players find it hard
to die in my games, because they get several warnings.  I do not believe in
killing people off for bad dice, but I will kill them for stupid behaviors.
 (A stupid behavior is a repeated unwise behavior in which you did not
learn appropriately from the visible consequences.)

An example - in a game I only watched, a DM had a couple of people who were
all from the same small village.  The villagers ended up betraying their
village in the first session, and were then caught and hung by the Watch.
As the new characters were riding out of town, they saw a notice posted on
the town hall of an upcoming hanging, but declined to attend.

Giving up:

Sometimes, players want to run a different kind of game  They want to see
nukes going off, battle cruisers flying by, and all that good space opera
stuff.  I have had fun running those, but that is an unusual kind of game,
and the players still do not see a lot of action, because I find it hard to
make the tenth battle as interesting as the first.  As a result, even my
space operas have a lot of gun pointing, but not as much gun firing.

As I said, it depends on why.  If they want to play assassin or merc games,
they are valid genres.  They are not mine, though.  If they just do not
enjoy the other, you can usually bring it in.

For example - after some slayfest, they are arrested, fined, and then told
that they may either serve at hard labor, or they can go kill a bad guy.
The catch - the bad guy is real popular, and has some lily-white friends,
so they need incontrovertible proof before doing so.  Threats do not work,
so they are left with skulking.

Posit that they are on a planet searching for something, and they cannot
take the usual destruction gear.  They need to talk their way into the
place where the gun battle can happen.

Perhaps they need to work as honest crew on a ship to get somewhere.

Maybe an NPC falls for a gunslinger who is better than he is, but retired.

Once you get them thinking about how to arrange their slayfests, you are
most of the way towards making those the climactic sessions, which only
happen one week in ten.  I play that way - when the guns come out, things
are problematic.

Squadron, details the 4518th Lift Infantry Regiments, and some other stuff.
It appears to be a source type book with an adventure thread running through

>What exactly IS this virus thing anyway?

Ahhhh...you missed a lot then.

In the Canon GDW history (as explained in "Survival Margin"), the
transponders used in the late Imperium were actually sentient microchips
derived from the silicon life forms from Cymbelline introduced in the
classic Trav adventure \'Signal GK\'.=20

They were autonomous life forms that exchanged data continuously with
each other comparing the state of the ships they were attached to. In
order that they could accurately do so, they were tied into all the ships
systems.

Meanwhile, after the Rebellion started, some of Lucan\'s scientists started
playing with a variant of the Cymbelline chips, ones that could \'imprint\'
themselves on other Cymbelline chips long distance, via radio, and take
over the other chips.

These were closer to the wild sentient chips in that they could readily
re-wire their own circuitry, once established.

Lucan\'s people wanted a \'humane\' weapon that could invade enemy ships via
long distance, and take control of the systems on board the enemy\'s ship,
rendering it useless to the enemy, and letting Lucan\'s fleets win without
a fight.

At this point, the winning without a fight part was far more important
than any \'humane\' aspect. Lucan fully intended on taking the ships he
aquirred in this fashion and re-flagging themin his fleets, thus fixing
two of the biggest problems facing all of the factions in 1120: The
horrendous loss of ships in battle, and great difficulties inreplacing
them.

Dulinor\'s last Core fleet overran the research station where this was
being worked on, and released this \'virus\', coined for it\'s similarity to
biological and computer viruses, into their fleet.

BIG problem...the thing was _not_ controllable. At the first jump, a
third of Dulinor\'s fleet misjumped, and on the second, another third.
Dulionor\'s own flagship came under the control of a virus and tried to
deliberately crash itself on a planet.

The virus could transmit itself via any radio signal, and, stretching the
imaginations of many, enter a ship via things like sensors.

It spread like wildfire throughout the Imperium, wreaking havok
everywhere, ships crashed themselves, traffuc control systems ran vehicles
into each other, buildings and the ground,. Dulinor himself was killed by
a robotic reaper that mowed him down.

This brought the technologically dependent Imperium to a horrific crash.
the virus mutated into a true lifeform, Virus, with a number of variants.
In a computer system of enough complexity, Virus could be extremely
intelligent.

The inspiration for Virus clearly descends from SF such as Fred
Saberhagen\'s Berserker series.

Many MANY people have a huge problem with Virus, to the extent of
proclaiming that this was what caused GDW to go under, even.

Their objections tend to follow a few lines:

1)No computer virus could do this to so many diverse systems.

(Well, it\'s not a comuter virus, per se. Any experience you have with
something like PSYCO MOnkey-B or somesuch will prepare you for dealing
with Virus like having experience with fighting bears will prepare you for
an epidemic of Ebola. In retrospect GDW erred in calling it Virus)

2)There\'s no way something could \'infect\' another system through a signal
it recieved.

(In Survival Margin, Virus is described as "A life form that moves through
computing circuitry like a fish moves through water". again, a strained
analogy...it\'s more like Virus is something that possesses or inhabits (in
the demonic sense) computing technology.=20

3)GDW used this to destroy the beautiful Imperium setting irrevocably and
introduced the vile heresy that was Traveller-The New Era.(TNE)

(Repeat after me: "its only a game...It\'s only a game...)

It got worse from there. Suffice it to say, there\'s a _reason_ the
standard TML curse involves \'Virus ridden near C rocks\' as some of the
highest volume, nastiest, most emotional flamewars ever to have sprouted
on this list revolved around Virus.=20

The canon explanation and descriptions of Virus are in: "Survival Margin",
the TNE main book, and the "Vampire Fleets" which was the Virus
sourcebook.

Personally, I like the concept; my main problem with the TNE setting was
the compressed timelines that were employed in the setting, as the long
night that follwed the Crash should have lasted several hundred years
rather than the 75 they said.

This is all I\'ll say on the matter as I\'m sure there are flamethrowers
being warmed up as I write.=20

Ah.

Virus was the plot device GDW (Traveller\'s original publisher) used to end
the Rebellion and usher in Traveller: The New Era.

Basically, it is an intellegent computer virus that modifies itself to move
from system to system.  It (originally) had one directive: Kill.  Virus was
released prematurely during the last major push of the Rebellion, and
spread rapidly, ending Imperial civilation within a few years.

Virus-infected ships (called Vampires) survived, as did countless
instalations, research computers, etc.  As the decades passed, the more
violent strains of Virus died off, and they reached true sentience.

Virus is probably the most hotly debated concept in Traveller.  Some people
liked it, some hated it with a passion.

A sourcebook on Virus or the Vampire Fleets was released in the TNE line. 
The Vampire Fleets sourcebook also had the most recent robot construction
rules (FFS 1st Ed. supplement).  You might be able to get a copy of the
relevant sourcebook(s) from Far Future Enterprises (FarFuture@aol.com), or
some other source.  TNE books are still pretty common among dealers with
back stock.

The FAQ for this list (http://www.spirit.net.au/~jamesd/tml-faq.html) 
advises against starting threads on Virus, citing past flamewars, so I\'ll
limit my response to what is hopefully a neutral description.  Someone may
want to point out Virus resources online; I don\'t know any. 

Unless I\'m mistaken, it\'s essentially a silicon-based life form which can
be used as a computer processor, and which is capable of rewriting its own
physical circuit pathways.  The Imperium\'s computers were already built
using the life forms.  One day Lucan released sentient versions of the
lifeform that were homicidal, and could make their non-sentient brethren
sentient and homicidal as well by communicating with them through standard
media.  Lucan thought that they were controllable, but this theory proved
false.  Thus, the 3rd Imperium was annihalated by hordes of its own
automated weapons systems.  Virus-infected units later (by the New Era
period) developed a more complex psychology on their own, and remained a
significant threat to re-emergent civilizations in and around the area
formerly occupied by the 3rd Imperium.

The GURPS version of Traveller is going to pretend that it never existed,
from what I understand, thus creating an "alternative" milieu of sorts.

Hoo, boy.  You may not realize what a dangerous topic that is.... :-)

Virus (capital v) is the central idea behind the Traveller: The New Era
setting, the third version of the game and the last published by the now
defunct Game Designers Workshop.  The publication of that version of the
game split this list wide open between admirers and detractors, and
there\'s still some bad blood evident now and then.

Basically, as I understood it, Virus was a highly-classified "Black War"
weapon devised in the last days of the Imperium-destroying Rebellion that
broke out after Strephon\'s assassination (which had, in turn, been the
impetus for MegaTraveller, the second rules-set for the RPG).  It relied
on the self-modifying nature of high-tech computer systems and the open
but secret channel created by a standard transponder (IFF) system in all
Imperial ships and Imperial trading partners.  Basically, a computer
infested with Virus would communicate through transponders or other data
channels (hardwired, beam, or broadcast) to spread itself into any other
available system.  Once there, it altered circuit pathways to become a
permanent part of the system, surviving through reboots or any other
attempts to extricate it.

The problem was, Virus wasn\'t controllable -- or, at least, it was
released accidentally, during a deep strike in the last days of the
Rebellion, before it was made controllable.  Sweeping in waves across the
Imperium and its trading partners (and, eventually, enemies and others),
a wave of newly-artifically-intelligent computers in starships, life-
support systems, scientific centers, and anywhere else with processing
power began committing suicide or, worse, destroying large numbers of
sophonts before suiciding (Virus had been a secret weapon for the War,
remember, designed to take out materiel).

A miniature Dark Age (disparagingly called the Short Nap by some) settled
over the Imperium as almost all high technology failed.  The saga of the
New Era was that of the Star Vikings, struggling to rebuild amidst anti-
technological paranoia, blighted and abandoned planets, and the still-
extant Vampires, starships and other machines still infested by wilier
strains of Virus.

Some like it, some didn\'t.  It marked the end of the canonical timeline of
Traveller history, and may eventually be revisted as Milieu: 1200.

Yep, that\'s my point, it can\'t *just* be physics it\'s physics and optics
and chemistry breaks down into organic, inorganic, and biochemistry, then
there is metallurgy and so many engineering specialties I won\'t even get
started. Where, oh where, do you make the breaks? 

I\'ll grant you that it\'s more realistic, and reminds me of Sid Mier\'s
Civilization which I love, but it goes beyond the workable.

George Herbert\'s list...

....look really good as a compromise between trying to cover everything in
detail and having a few broad general functional areas. They cover the
fundimental areas with the Science segment, and the functional areas with
the Technologies.  We\'d have to rate a society in all 11 areas, and that\'s
a lot given that we currently only have *1* TL. ;->

Reviewing George\'s list, I can\'t help feeling that *something* is missing.
I can\'t quite put my finger on what, though.  Maybe it\'s his listing
Computers rather than Electronics.

Computers are, it seems to me, a sub-technology, although a *very*
important one. The more general technologies involved are Electronics and
Information Technology, and IT is so algorithmic I\'d group it in with
Mathematics.

And it might be better to put Aerospace under some kind of "Motive
Technology" grouping it in with ground and water transport. Not sure...

Anyway, lots of good ideas are turning up.

I agree with you and with Douglas on this.  What alot of people that
responded to this thread seem to have forgotten is:  when all is said and
done, it really is the players\' game.  The GM has to be responsive to the
desires of the players, and the players have to have a sense for the kind of
game that the GM runs, and the directions he wants to take the party in.

The balance can\'t just be changed by saying, "I\'m the game master, that\'s
why!", or creating bad blood between you and your players by going hog wild
and killing off characters.

My advice is this:  Sit down and talk with the players and tell them you
don\'t like the direction the game is heading, and explain to them the
direction you want to go in.  Reward the use of brainpower over brawn _in_
game play.  Even if the players come up with good ideas that don\'t work, make
sure they know that the idea was a good one.  I try to reward the best idea
in the gaming session with an extra experience point (under T4 rules), but
don\'t overuse it.

Come up with reasons _why_ the players will have a difficult time buying
heavy weapons and armor.  At the beginning of the game I\'m currently running,
someone inquired about getting a suit of battle dress and a PGMP.  I
explained first the relatively high price of a mercenary charter.  Some of
the players decided that the heavy weapons would be worth the high price.
 Then I explained that the Imperium checks up on mercenary units from time to
time to make sure that they are gainfully employed and doing legitimate
mercenary work.  I told them that this would take the game in a different
direction then I had hoped, _but_ if the players wanted to become mercenaries
I\'d let them and have no problem with it.  The players informally voted on it
and decided they didn\'t want to be mercenaries.

The other balancing factor is law levels.  Make sure your PCs pay attention
to them.  My group never lands on a planet without asking about the
government type and law level.  If the law level says that assault weapons
are prohibited, then assault weapons are prohibited and someone carrying
around something like a PGMP will be arrested even if he gives the weapon up.

Imagine someone getting off of a plane to New York city with a LAW and an
assault rifle and you\'ll see what I mean.

The group I play with is pretty experienced as far as roleplaying goes, my
brother has been playing RPGs since the blue book D&D basic set, and another
player (my best friend) has been RPGing with me for about 11 years or so.
 The others I\'ve played with a good bit over about the last four or five
years.  I\'ve seen the group mature, and they have become more of a thinking
man\'s party.  The last major munchkin tendency seemed to die off before I
started running the game (one player was legendary, and I mean legendary for
completely destroying games, but he told me before we started playing that
he\'d be a good boy because he realized that no one was running games because
of him) and things have gone pretty smoothly.  So I guess I\'m pretty lucky
that I have good players to work with.

The final note of advice is this:  Write interesting adventures, play NPCs
intelligently (there was once an editorial in Dragon about "Tucker\'s Kobolds"
which is nigh unto legendary in my gaming group.  To distill it, the guy had
said that a DM playing kobolds right could make them a menace to even
experienced high level adventurers) and don\'t let the players walk all over
you.  If the players are acting like bloodthirsty psychopaths, then let
society treat them like psychopaths.  Traveller requires a suspension of
disbelief for an interstellar imperium to work.  Even so, I find it hard to
believe a party could get off of a ship in a world ,with any law level but
the most lenient ones, carrying PGMPs and not be stopped by the police, local
militia, local army, what have you...

Just some thoughts.

The Israeli\'s only really used small unit tactics was during the 1948 war,
which was more lost by the Arabs rather than won by the Israeli\'s. The
Israeli\'s had the Haganah, several brigades trained by the British which had
seen action during the 1942 invasion of Syria (a very hard fight) and in the
desert war. The only competent Arab force was the Arab Legion (Jordan), but
this was only a reinforced brigade and was hamstrung when the British stopped
suppling ammunition and parts; and withdrew all their seconded officers (still
the Legion gave the Israeli\'s a *very* tough fight in Jerusalem). Plus the
Israeli\'s were helped by the atrocities of the IZL and Stern Gang in Deir
Yassin which lead to the flight of much of the Palastinian population.
In 1956 the Israeli\'s had built up a large conventional conscript army, whilst
none of the Arab nations (with the exception of Jordan) had an effective army.
The 1956 war was basically Israeli, France and Britian Vs Egypt; and not
suprisingly, Eqypt lost. The war lasted 7 days and none of the other Arab
nations could intervene to help Egypt.
In the six day war (1967) the Israeli\'s launched another pre-emptive strike
which wiped out the Arab nations airforces and the Arabs still had not built
effective armies (with the exception of Jordan, who proved a tough nut to
crack even with absolute air superiority).
In 1973 the Egyptians had finally built the beginnings of an effective army
and found an answer to the previously invincible IDF Air Force (massed SAM
fire) and had discovered how to fool Israeli intelligence (the best place to
hide a tree is in a forest). Plus the Israeli\'s had gotten sloppy, over
confident and badly underestimated their enemy. The result was the Israeli\'s
got their bottoms badly kicked in the early stages and had to actually fight
to win this time. The result was the peace with Egypt in 1978 because the
Israeli\'s knew next time they might lose.

ObTrav: The Sword Worlds position is much more like Egypt in 1973 than
Israel. The Imperium has badly underestimated them, the SW have been posturing
towards war for awhile without doing anything (leading to the Imperium
thinking it\'s just bluff and posturing). They\'ve been conducting a "War of
Attrition" (1968-73) with pirates and guerillas in D268 and Lunion.

All this is true.

Unfortunately, this is where you depart from my understanding of "Canon" as
described in Survival Margin. The problem is that the Cymbeline chips were only
used in the *Transponders* of starships ... and all Transponders do is *report*
data, they are not actively tied into the ships systems in a way that would
affect them (not in any sensible universe, that is). Even if you allow that the
Cymbeline Transponder chips could reprogram *themselves*, Survival Margin makes
the claim that they can somehow -- by radio, nonetheless -- change previously
non-sentient, non-"living", non-*Cymbeline* chips into "living", "sentient",
"Cymbeline" chips. This is like saying that I can turn *you* into a hamster by
transmitting the DNA code of a Hamster to you via email! Quite ridiculous.

The perfect defence against Virus, in any world where the writers had some idea
of how computers (and evolution, for that matter) worked would have been simply
to cut the transponder circuit out of the link and then power down the computers
to kill off any software "infection" and reboot them from "clean" (probably
read-only) media.

This may be in Signal GK -- but I can\'t remember it in Survival Margin.

And I don\'t think anyone objects to the Berserkers, as *they* can\'t infect other

Me, for one. I simply stopped buying GDW products pretty much in disgust after

And it couldn\'t work the way it is said to have for reasons that have been done

bad example ... you and a Hamster have a lot more in common, evolutionarily

Nothing wrong with TNE *game system* ... well, except for FF&S #1 ... it was
simply the background that sucked majorly. In fact, the TNE *game system* is far
better than the suck(ish) T4 game system!

Exactly. That was another thing that *really* got up my nose.

ideas.

Thanks!
======================================================================
ROBOTIC VEHICLES

While none of the major interstellar governments use robotic vehicles in
large numbers, the construction of such devices is possible in a
primitive sense around TL 8, and they can be built reliably around TL
12.

Robotic vehicles are a bit more complex than simply replacing
crewmembers with computers or robots. These rules are an attempt to
explain the strengths and weaknesses of such vehicles.

Design

Robotic vheicles are normally designed from the start to be robotic - 
rarely are ships retrofitted with such technology. Due to the lack of
living crewmembers, robotic vehicles have several advantages. Note that
it is possible to constuct a hybrid vessel - a normal ship with a
reduced crew due to robots and robot brains. In such cases, the
requirements for both crews (living and robotic) must be met in their
entirity.

* Robotic vehicles require high automation, to allow the robot brains to
effectively interface with the system.
* Robotic vehicles require an extra computer, to coordinate all of the
robots.
In starships/spacecraft, that means jump-capable craft must have at
least 4 computers, while non-jump ships need at least 3. Backups may be
provided. These computers must be as powerful as the general ships\'
computers.
* The following crew positions may be replaced by robotic brains: pilot,
navigator, sensors, gunnery, MFD, screens, command, and pilots in the
flight section (but not maintenance staff in the flight section).
* The following crew positions may be replaced by robots (because they
need manipulators and the ability to move and interact): engineers,
maintenance, troops, non-pilot flight, steward, medical.
* Robotic brains require no life support, no gravity, and no quarters.
* Robots require no life support. However, they do need operating space,
which is usually wrapped up abstractly in staterooms. If there are no
living crewmembers, for every two robots you need one small "stateroom".
This is not actually a stateroom, but it represents access tunnels,
hallways, and work areas. If living crew members are present, robots
require no extra space if they are outnumbered by living personnel. If
robots outnumber personnel, then the 2 robots->1 stateroom rule applies
to all robots beyond the number of personnel. Gravity is required for
all robots except those equipped with zero-g maneuvering systems or grav
modules. Gravity compensation from acceleration is required for all
robots except grav-powered robots.
* Robots do not have a "frozen watch", but extra robot brains may be
installed, and extra robots can be stored in cargo.

Operation and Combat

While the design of robotic vessels confers many advantages, they are
severely limited in operations, due to the intelectual shortcomings of a
robotic brain. This can be broken down by tech level:

TL 8-11:
These vessels are severely limited. They must be given EXPLICIT
instructions, and will not waver from them. Examples: 
  "Travel to the top of hill 27 and fire at all vehicles not
transmitting the IFF signal"
  "Orbit the gas giant and examine the atmosphere with your sensors"

These vessels can only be commanded by specially trained personnel, and
the changing of their orders takes a great deal of time (they must be
completely reprogrammed). The more complex their programming, the more
likely a malfunction. Referees should base the difficulty of programming
such vehicles on the complexity of the instructions - if the programmer
fails his programming roll, the vehicle will malfunction in some
fashion.
  TL 8-11 vehicles cannot in any way respond to new situations. If a
vessel has no instructions regaurding combat, they will cheerfully
remain in place as an enemy blasts away at them.
  TL 8-11 vehicles cannot repair themselves.

TL 12-16
These are the first vehicles that can be truely considered fully
robotic.
These machines, while not as versatile as normal ships with living
crewmembers, are much more responsive than their more primative cousins.
They can act in all mays like normal craft, with the following
exceptions:
* In combat, a robot or robot brain\'s skill levels are limited by its
Tactics or Ship\'s Tactics skill. Thus, a robot brain with Pilot-4 and 
Ship Tactics-2 is counted as having Pilot-2 in combat. This represents
the inherent differences between the calm pace of normal life and the
fast-paced dynamic world of combat. Skills can be reduced to 0 in this
fashion, although there should be no penalties for no skill applied.
* All repair difficulties are increased by one - this represents the
fact that robots don\'t have the jury-rig mentality that living 
crewmembers might have.
* Unless the robots and robot brains have electronioc circuit
protection, any radiation hit will reset their brains the same as the
computer, causing the craft to be dead in the water. 
* Referees should severely enforce the fact that robots are not
creative, and will tend to react in predictable (even if intelligent)
fashions. Also, robotic craft tend to be disturbed by non-rational or
"crazy" tactics, often unable to cope. Referees should feel free to
alter the difficulties of a task to represent this shortcoming.
* Note that robotic craft have high automation, and thus suffer the
damage penalties such craft have.
* On the other hand, robots are thorough and fearless. It is asumed that
they can perform nearly any reasonable mental feat instantly, and can
ignore any penalties for fear or stress.

Role Playing Notes

None of the major races field large amounts of robotic craft. However,
the replacement of crewmembers with robotic brains or robots is
ocasionally practiced in civilian craft. The most common replacements
are robotic navigators and electronics operators. Imperial Regulations 
require that such devices have a "skill-level" of at least 3. 

In cultures where robots are commonplace, robotic troops, maintenance,
stewards, and medics are often used.

No major government is known to deploy robotic combat craft.

Actually, I like the idea!  My players tend to look for the edge, and
invest time and energy in planning and preparation.  Investing a bit of
money in top-of-the-line equipment would be right up their alley.

You are wrong; there was no single source book for the pre-5FW era. 
There was a large amount of material produced about it by GDW, however. 
You should look at the most of the Adventures and Double Adventures, as
well as issues 1-8 of JTAS.  The Traveller News Service for issues 1-9
is republished in the rules for the 5FW war game.  This is a great
Traveller setting; enjoy!

When are the Sword Worlds like Egypt in 1973?  Not in 1107, surely. 
Look at the Fifth Frontier War war game.  Sword Worlds fleets are jump-2
at best, and their forces are no higher than tech level 12 (maybe it\'s
11, even worse).  It takes several turns for them just to wrest Tavonni
away from a single Imperial mercenary battalion, and even after that
they can\'t make much progress into Vilis subsector without substantial
Zhodani assistance.  The Imperium -- not even Santanocheev -- wasn\'t
underestimating the Sword Worlds at all in that time frame, and the
Sword Worlds are essentially ineffective in the most important regions
of the Fifth Frontier War.

Without (hopefully) starting up another flame war, I\'d like to reply to this
(and 1 below). Caps used below are for emphasis not yelling.

The "mini Dark Age" is NOT over in 1200. You\'re only seeing the first
flickerings of renewed civilization with the RC. Vast sectors still lie in
ruin. The setting is DURING the mini Dark Age, not after. 

The Regency, on the other hand, remained intact. The Long Night (as far as I
know) didn\'t have such a large surviving "Pocket Empire." The interstellar
economy in the Regency was large enough to avoid falling into darkness. I\'d
argue that this will speed recovery.

>>>Survival Margin makes the claim that they can somehow -- by radio,
nonetheless -- change previously non-sentient, non-"living", non-*Cymbeline*
chips into "living", "sentient", "Cymbeline" chips. This is like saying that

you via email! <<<
 
Uh, your analogy is flawed. Sentient chips and non-sentient chips still share
the same medium (silicon) and both will transmit information (1\'s & 0\'s) the
same way. It seems feasible to me. DNA and email don\'t share the same medium.
It\'s apples and oranges. If you wanted to turn me into a hamster via hamster
DNA then you would have to use a proper means of transmitting that sort of
information. Think a successful version of "The Island of Dr Moreau" or maybe
"Blood Music" by Greg Bear.

But it\'s all over now anyway,

Someone sent me an adventure for issue 13 of Signal-GK based on a cybertech

I don\'t have the authors name or address and the adventure becomes garbage

Konis was a good player, and rarely lost. Having built the complex, he had
free access to it (while other players and onlookers had to pay a steep fee)
and plenty time to practice. Unfortunately, the night of his death, he didn\'t
simply lose, but was still connected when his pawn died. The massive sensory
shock triggered an heart attack, and the small infirmary (which is used
mostly to patch up the surviving pawns after the fight) was not equipped for
this kind of emergencies. The bruise on his chin was caused by his death
spasms. Zaran Horas instructed his men to take the corpse back to the
apartment. Three men carried the body to his car, drove to the residence and
prepared the scene of his death. They lost the datacard while fumbling in the
dead man pockets to find the keycard for his apartment. Horas decided to lay
down for a little and  ...

Referencing my copy of Survival Margin, The Cymbeline chips are only in the
"SDG-313F" Transponder system.  Their only purpose is to identify other
starships own cymbeline chips and thus verify the identity.  They do this by
"conversing" w/ the other chips Cymbeline Transponder.   We\'re told (pg
69-70) that they\'re constatly broadcasting, not just when the crews hear a
\'squawk.\' It is on page 70 that we are told that the chips have UNIMPEDED
access to the comm system (to stay frequency agile) AND the ships main
computer core and databanks.
    Thus, the Virus does not turn "non cymbeline" chips into "living,
"sentient","Cymbeline" chips.  Even on a cymbeline Transponder equipped ship,
this just makes for convenient (unapposed) entry into a ship.  Entering this
way was the Virus\' "Ace in the Hole,"  the easy way to infect.  Every alien
vessel that traded in the Imperium was required to have it and every ship
built in the Imperium was built w/ the system. (At least in canon).  These
were instant Vampires.   Shutting down the transponder made Virus try to find
other ways to infect or just destroy u (if it could).
So its the Computer (Core) ends up being a host for Virus not turning "chips"
into Cymbeline Chips.

Doesn\'t work.  Again, the computers of the 57th century aren\'t just souped up
models of todays.  Turning off the transponders was exactly what many did.
 They got infected by other methods, or were destroyed by "normal" methods
(lasers, missles, etc) Doing that, btw, destroyed your transponder.  Virus
was stated to have the ability to cut new ciruitry and thus imbed itself in
hardware.  This was the "hidey hole".   You\'re playing right along w/ Virus.
 I don\'t think this is a far fetched ability.  No more than going into a
pocket universe for a week long jaunt to another solor system.  It\'s been
theorized that computers will be able to reconfigure systems as they
"compute" for efficiency.  Why not hardware?  Especially after a few thousand
years?

Referencing my copy of Survival Margin.  The transporder chatter is not just
simple radio transmissions.  Once u go beyond the transponder, the next most
common form of infection was computer controlled communications.
 Encoding/decoding, correcting from Doppler shifting, keeping tight beam
comms on target w/ accuracies measured in attoradians.  Virus attaches its
code and it insures infection by the "viewing" computer.  All out of the eyes
of the crew.  Military ships would have protection against this by data
contamination procedures.  Maybe even some civilian ships.   The 3rd form of
infection was human delievered.  Convincing a human that a program was a new
diagnostic program, outright threats  (depressurize or play Grav Pong,
bombard a city).  Yet another mode is via small craft.  When brought back
aboard, they\'re hooked into ships systems.  Fuel hoses, power cables,
computer connections...  (inertial navigation calibration, diagnostics).  All
of this is paraphrased from Survival Margin.  (pg 77).

of.  NOONE. If u think u do, i got a bridge i wanna sell u. Personally, i

Um...  but have the "standard" imperial chips been described anywhere?  I may
well be wrong, but i don\'t think so.  Again, I don\'t think anyone on this
list (or even Nostradamus) has any idea what the standard computer chip of
the 57th century will be like.
    The computers of Traveller have always been vague enough to justify
Virus, as explained.

Not if some worlds never collapse or get outside help.  (RC from Hivers,
Domain of Deneb (Regency) never collapses, couple of other pocket Empires the

 Then the helped kinda get the ball rolling.

Its time to get some outside input on how to proceed.

The background;

Elise (The character\'s name) is a computer expert.  her skill level is such
that she can not-quite work miracles at the console.  She spends all of her
time immersed in a neural user interface (playing Battletech much of the
time) and hacking into systems just for the fun of it.

Arrive at a TL13 world.  "What kind of computer stuff do they have?" she
asks, and I provide a hook (at the suggestion of the player); Trinary logic
computers.  Supposedly a "dead-end" technology, the local technoweenies
have developed a transistor with three states instead of our usual two
("yes-no-maybe" rather thna "yes-no").  They have also developed their
machine-language level software to take advantage of this and, indeed, have
a long history of excellent software developers who use both the trinary
chips and Imperial Standard binary chips for alll sorts of stuff.

Elise acquires a new computer; it turns out to have biological components
in addition to the usual electronic, solid state ones.  Big pinkish blobs
in fishbowl-like life support tanks are brought on board and hooked into
the main computer system (incidentially spilling out into the ships
passageway) along with many other new components and systems.

Of course, Elise didn\'t trust the thing at first, and there have been
two-three months of encouraging signs and interesting but undetailed
developments to work from.  A this point she has the thing playing
Mechwarrior against human opponents and doing quite well on the tactical
side.  It doesn\'t act as well on the more judgemental strategic side, but
that should be true of any artificial thinker.  It can only think inside
the box, so to speak, and unpredictable, non-programmed strategies should
be able to defeat it.

Now, I\'d like to implement the next step in this development.  I would like
to get "outside" my own "box" and solicit some suggestions not my own.  I\'d
like the computer to become a plot hook of some sort, an lead to an
adventure.

We are in the Spinward Marches, Aramis Subsector, using the Traveller
Adventure.  The group is just leaving Junidy.  (we will have after Thursday
night.)

I\'d like to develop some technical aspect of why this computer is better
using either the nature of trinary logic, biological computing, or both.

Note that it has been well established (in theory) that the biological
components are not "alive" or "intelligent" in any sense, they merely
provide electronic pathways that can be electrochemically opened or closed
by a controlling "program" to act like a CPU.  That these components may,
in fact, possess life or ontelligence is certainly a glaring adventure
hook, but its use is neither required nor suggested.

Ok folks, go at it.

 I quite agree with you about TNE vs T4. What little system my group uses
is TNE...

 I have to disagree with your opinion of FF&S-TNE however. While some
typos crept in, and some specific numbers deeply offended certain
gearheads, this book was a wonder of organization. The depth and detail
available in this book is ONLY available because of that organization.
FF&S-TNE is both useful AND useable.


 If you want examples of misorganized design systems, we can look first
at FF&S-T4 and continue through most of the rest of the T4 stuff. GDW
obviously learned (and regretably forgot part of) the lesson of layout
and organization; IG hasn\'t.  GDW also forgot more about proper typeface
usage than IG knows now (compare MT with TNE and T4).

 In my honest opinion, formed over 20 years of gaming, IG could AT THIS
MOMENT benefit more from a good layout artist than from any other permanent
addition to their staff. Organization and readability are vital to any
role-playing publication.
  Oh. You want examples?

  Player\'s Handbook, AD&D 1st ed. (TSR):  The Holy Grail of RPG
publications as far as organization and presentation are concerned. You
always know what section of the book you are in, _where_ in that section
you are, and where on the page you need to look. All these things happen
at page-flipping speed; no need to slow down to reading speed.

  most of the Palladium stuff:  Kevin Simbieda may be a big jerk, and
his writing merely competent, but he knows how to use artwork and
formatting to present his information.

  Star Fleet Battles (ADB/TFG):  High organization with very little
attention paid to presentation, this is a thousand pages of rules in which
you can find _any_ rule in under a minute.

  FF&S-TNE (GDW): As mentioned above, this book organizes a wide array
of design sequences and options in an instantly useable format.

  Referee\'s Manual, MegaTraveller (GDW): Typos aside, this book shares
many of the best characteristics with the AD&D-Player\'s Handbook above.

  Star Wars RPG (West End): Good typeface and size, clear chapter
boundaries and good use of graphic elements in layout. Good use of
art (but hey, this IS Star Wars).

now for a few negative examples:

  TNE rulebook (GDW): a bad fall for the same company that did the MT
stuff.  Much of this book\'s size and its difficulty of use could have
been solved by a smaller, more readable typeface.  Most of the rulebooks
from GDW in the same time period (Dark Conspiracy, T:2000) suffer the same
problems.

  Warhammer 40,000 Rulebook (GW): Good readable typeface, but a bad
tendency to bury important rules in huge paragraphs or among pages of
background color.

  T4: Starships (IG): The ship examples were okay aside from being printed
white on black (remember, I\'m talking presentation here, NOT content).
The rules in the back suffered for having the guide text completely
seperated from the tables.  With design systems of this sort, my belief
is that the entire answer to one question should be on one page or a
short contiguous range of pages.

  Mutant Chronicles (Heartbreaker): very dense text, with annoying bits of
mechanics scattered throughout the book.

  T4: Fire, Fusion and Steel (IG): As with Starships, guide text and
related hard data seperated by many pages. This leads to denser guide
text (which makes it even harder to use). Typeface is a good size, but
is still a sans-serif, and that damn sunburst on each odd-numbered page
doesn\'t help.

  Guns, Guns, Guns (any edition; BTRC): Exept for the sunburst, these
books have all the same problems as FF&S-T4. \'Nuf said.

  Champions: New Millenium (R.Talsorian/Hero): Huge dependence on graphic
elements to define layout (translation: all the tables have fancy borders),
and a fragmented organization (background color and mechanics overmixed).

   Actually this part of his description sounds like one that would be given
by a Lucan "apologist" or ally, and actually may even be true.  While we are
told that Lucan\'s people were trying to develop superweapons, and that Virus
was one of those superweapons, exactly *what* it was suppose to do (as
opposed to what it actually did) is subject to interpretation.

   As for the balance of your comments here, your view seems to be tainted
by your understanding of the way late 20th century computer architecture
works.  In fact, even today computer viruses can be spread through data
files, something that even 10 years ago was thought impossible.  Since the
transponders were tied into the communication array, it would be child\'s
play for Virus to be accepted as a data file (even though it is an
executable), and the work its way into the heart of the ship\'s main computer.

   Again, you fail to understand the basic idea.  Because it is sent as data
(or at least mascarades as such), it can be transmitted by radio, microwave
antenna, over land lines--anything capable of transmitting data.  While
Virus starts off in the silicon state, tied to a physical object, it
reproduces by sending false data packets which are in reality "virtual DNA"
that are the codes for creating an offspring.  Virus can be made of silicon
(as are the "chips"), gallium arsenide, liquid, or anything else capable of
holding its "virtual DNA" intact.

   OK, first you have to know that Virus is coming in through transponder
circuits.  Most of those killed in the initial attacks weren\'t given that
briefing.  Second, assuming that you were lucky enough to know that all
transponder circuits needed to be cut, you now must check every single file
(data or otherwise) being transmitted into your computer to make sure it
doesn\'t carry "virtual DNA"--remember, Virus can pretend to be almost
anything (down to a minimum compression size), including anti-Virus
software!  You must do this process continuously, otherwise Virus could slip
through.

   Also, if the "virtual DNA" instructions are executed, Virus becomes
hardwired into the circuits (yes I know that would work with liquid data
storage, but the assumption is those are extremely rare).  Wiping a
computer\'s memory and disks clean of software will do no good at that point,
you will have to physically replace the effected computer components.

   Remember, Virus was a ***surprise attack***.  You may have to figure out
what Virus really is and how it is being transmitted all while at the same
time your computer and every computer around you is trying its best to wreak
as much havoc as possible before self-destructing--not to mention all the
starships, vehicles, planetary computer nets, orbital defense systems, and
anything else with good computer power that is trying to do the same thing.

>And I don\'t think anyone objects to the Berserkers, as *they* can\'t infect

   Again, we\'re not talking about playing "Love Me Tender" on a 50,000 watt
radio station, we\'re talking about the transmission of large amounts of
*data*, which went on in the Imperium without anyone giving it a second thought.

   Virus no more caused the downfall of GDW than the initial underpowering
of energy weapons in TNE.  What caused the downfall of GDW is a complex
series of events that are better left for another discussion.

   Really its a question of the suspension of disbelief.  If you can do it
on a basic level, science-fiction becomes possible (this is why people like
my mother-in-law don\'t get Star Trek or any other sci-fi--she is incapable
of the process).  If you can do it with the Virus concept, then the Collapse
becomes possible.  If not, then TNE still had some excellent game mechanics
around which you could wrap any story, including one in which Virus doesn\'t
happen.

   Once again, Virus is no more tied to a silicon chip than a vector is tied
to a host.  You have to think in terms of both computer science and biology
in order to "get it".

   Sorry but the implied analogy between the Rule of Man and the Post-Virus
era doesn\'t work.  The fall of civilization that takes place after the Rule
of Man was far more complete, and much less sudden than the one that takes
place after the Collapse.  It is like comparing a 200 point decrease in the
stock market that takes place over two years versus the same decrease that
takes place in two days.  The former is usually a sign of long term problems
and recovery could take many years, whereas the latter is probably only
temporary and can be made up in another couple of days.

I use grapples to put together great big nonstellar spaceships to ply the 
internal lanes (with truly large quanities of fuel and chemical boosters you 
can get around fairly fast) with trips around 3 months long (only 10 days 
thrust at .1 G sort of thing).

I always use a Tug type arrangement (although it\'s really a push, I guess) 
that has controls and life support and then grapple on thrusters and landers 
and stuff like that as required.  Sometimes the "Ship" has changed so much 
it\'s hard to recognise.

 Well...the first thing that springs to mind is the vision of Doctor McCoy,
kneeling over the life support module, looking up and saying (everyone), "I\'m a
doctor Jim,  not a computer technician!"

You can hit \'em with life support problems - symptoms ranging from
discolorations and reduced reaction time, to erratic decisions.  It can be
caused by a virus (small \'v\') introduced during installation, contaminated
nutrients, or even planned \'obsolecense\' (the manufactorer makes money _selling_
the darned things!)

Give \'em a scenario of unexplained growth - where it is growing over it\'s
bounds.  That should make \'em nervouse (not to mention scrambling to find a way
to contain it, and support the new size)

Have a passenger try and free it (ever hear of PETA?)

Hmmm...I wonder how a religious dictatorship would react to a manufactured
biological...?!

If it has, all I need is the old information; if not, then I need the help
of some high-speed design types until I\'m more familiar with
"seat-of-your-pants designing."

Your bridge crew are probably the most expensive to train, and are
conveniently all in one place, so why not try and save them before you ship
gets blasted into smithereens. (Granted that those in the engineering
section may have something to say about that, but that\'s beside the point
for this discussion.)

Essentially what I\'m envisioning is almost like a modular portion of the
ship with explosive bolts that can be ejected (ala current fighter ejection
seats). So the entire bridge doubles as an escape pod. I suppose at higher
tech levels you might even have it tied into the computer, so when it
anticipates catastrophic damage, it scuttles the plug.

Anyway, that\'s the idea. I welcome opinions and constructive criticisms.

I had also designed a central "connector" for joining four or more modules
together...it was shaped rather like a maltese cross in plan view, and could
be stacked for larger stations. 

I\'d say one habitation module, one lab module and a couple of supply modules
would be a good starting point. A commo module maybe, more supply and
habitation modules depending on how long the station is expected to go
between resupply trips.

Trav campaign.  It\'s being run by Ross Coburn, with myself, fellow TML\'ers
Glenn Grant and Jason Jones, and one of our non-net-enabled friends as
players.  I\'ll be doing these up, in the form of letters home from time to
time.

	The campaign is set in the Spinward Marches, right at the outset of
the 5FW.  We\'re using the MT task system.  It revolves around the
Kigikikaniishi, a 200td SAR & salvage vessel that is the sole vessel and
only major asset of Spinward Search and Rescue, a salvage and rescue
operation based out of Jewell.

	The crew consists of:

Captain Edeli (Popie) Savan\'ateeli: a bearded grizzled ex-belter from
Glisten.  A father to his crew and just the person for saving your bacon
when the drive goes on the fritz, the computer crashes, and you get a hull
breach.  Not so good at running a covert operation.

Deschenko Maharin: Born in the Darrian Confederation. After having fled
from Nosea to Frenzie after failing a college admission exam, he joined the
Imperial Navy.  Tall, dark, and quiet, he flies the ship through vacuum,
gas giants, and ammonia oceans with equal aplomb.  Played by Jason.

Mustapha Shaqui Berengi Jones: A former bloodthirsty scum-of-the-spacelanes
pira..., er privateer, he handles nav, sensors, and commo.  Vaguely
disreputable, and has far too many tattoos to be non-sinister-looking.
Played by Glenn.

Capon who joined the Marines and became a medic.  Is in charge of repairing
carnage.  Uses the ship to carry his gonads from port to port, and the rest
of the crew to carry him from bar to bar.  Played by yours truly.

Siich Zukan: the (NPC) gunner.  Blond, melancholy, mysterious, and has
exhibited disturbing signs of psionic potential.

				***************


Dear Ma:

	By now, you\'ve probably heard that war has broken out between us
and those dirty Zhos.  Don\'t worry; I\'m OK, in one piece, haven\'t been
called back up yet, and still have my job.  I may have kinda sort\'ve
_caused_ the war, but we got out all right.  And, like I promised you, I\'m
still wearing my goggles and my burnoose whenever I go outside.

	Anyhow, I was glad to get your last letter.  I\'m sorry to hear that
Irm=E4=E4 got sat on by a basa.  He always was a little bit slow to use his
prod.  Oh well, I\'m sure he\'ll be OK once he gets out of hospital.  It
doesn\'t sound like he was totally squashed, so I\'m sure he\'ll recover fine.
I think of him a lot. I\'ve told the story about that time the two of us
went varmint hunting together and only realized we\'d forgotten the rocket
launcher _after_ we\'d cornered the critter to the guys.  They all think
it\'s really funny.

	A lot has happened since the last time I wrote.  I think I told you
about getting the job with Spinward Search and Rescue: well, things are
going OK.  It\'s been pretty slow (except for a couple of times which I\'ll
get to).  Most of the time I spend deployed to my action station (my bunk).
The guys are a pretty good bunch.  Popie (that\'s what the captain tells us
to call him) really knows his stuff and has a good head for business.
Mustapha is pretty sharp with the sensors, and is a good guy for an
ex-pirate.  And Deschencko is a hot pilot and pretty good in a fight.  Ya
gotta love somebody who won\'t hesitate to shoot a cop to save his buddies.
And we just hired this chick named Siich.  I think she\'s hot for me; she
makes a lot of direct eye contact.  Thing is I think that she\'s psionic, so
I spend a lot of my time thinking really perverted thoughts.  I don\'t know
whether it\'s working, or how I want it to work yet.

	I\'m sure that by now you\'re wondering about all the hints I\'ve been
dropping; caused the war, shipping with psionic pirates, and shooting cops.
Well, it\'s all true, and I left out the bits about the nuke too (don\'t
worry; we nuked the site from orbit, and I didn\'t take a single rem).
Where to start?

	Well, about 6-7 weeks ago, we were docked at Jewell Highport for
annual maintenance.  There wasn\'t much I could do, so there I was in a bar
with the guys when Popie gets a call from someone at Sternmetalls.  All
very hush-hush it was.  So we pile into a cab and head off to meet them,
and the first thing they do is make us sign this contract that says that we
can\'t tell anybody anything about what we hear.  It was pretty scary, but
all things considered I don\'t think that you\'re going to leak this, and
even if you did only the clan would hear and I doubt that by the time that
happens Sternmetalls is going to come snooping around the steppes on Capon.
But all the same, let me save this story for when I get back, OK?

	Anyhow, upshot is is that they wanted us to go evacuate this secret
research base a jump away from Zhodani space.  Seems that Sternmetalls
thinks its a really bright idea to take a top secret fusion research lab,
and stick it right next door to the Zhos on this stinking cold planet under
an ammonia ocean a klick and a half deep, with only a few people on the
mainworld knowing it\'s there, and then lose contact with it.  That\'s
exactly what they did.

	So basically, our job was to berth the Kigikikaniishi on the
Mirtschaum (this Reserve Navy dropship, which had enough low berths to
store the entire base crew), and jump out to where the base was.  The guys
and I were to handle the actual search and rescue bits, with backup from
the Marines on the dropship, and recuperate the test reactors and data and
scientists, and then nuke the site and get out.  I think that Sternmetalls
had an idea the war was coming.

	So we get to buy a whole bunch of really cool gear at cost from His
Imperial Majesty\'s Navy (I got this nifto neural sensor that\'s going to be
great for varmint hunting, and a couple of Marine issue gauss pistols that
G=FC=FCbotz\'s kids are going to love), and have our annual maintenance
completed by the deck crews on the Mirtschaum, plus a really hefty fee:
Popie really managed the negotiations well.  So on we board and off we go.

	Trouble was is that the bonehead astrogator on the Mirtschaum
screwed up, and we misjumped.  We were all pretty messed up; poor Siich
(who\'s a real cutie) went straight into a coma, and I spent the rest of the
week hopped up on pain pills and stims getting Navy boys to barf into the
bags and not their bedding.  And to make things worse, while we did emerge,
which is why I\'m here writing this, we were a couple of parsecs away from
where we were supposed to be... and of all the damndest pieces of luck,
right on top of a Zhodani destroyer.

	Soon as the Navy boys figured this out, they ran like hell.  They
loaded the nuke (a great big multi-megaton fusion bomb) and a fire team of
Marines onboard double-quick, and kicked us out the hangar bay doors as
soon as we\'d got it strapped down in the hold.  As soon as Deschencko got
us a jump solution, out we went.  While the Kigi can pull 6 G\'s at a pinch
(that\'s the great thing about flying on a tug) it can\'t outrun a Zho
detlaser missile...

	Anyhow, Deschy managed to jump us right in-system, which was good,
because a couple of those marines were killer gamblers.  We refuelled, and
headed for the target.  Unfortunately, to make a long story short, someone
had got there before us.  The base crew was gone (and long dead; their
escape pods probably ran out of power weeks before we got there), and so
were the scientists and most of the test reactors.  And to boot the jerks
had half-blown up the main reactor and flooded the base.  So there we were,
trying to figure out what the hell had happened, under 1500 meters of
liquid ammonia, with the base too radioactive to deal with.  Popie was real
good; he\'s a great waldobot operator.  We managed to reseal the base, and
salvaged a bunch of stuff via waldo.  We also found a couple of corpses;
somebody had shot a couple of people and left them to dissolve in the
ammonia, and one of the bastards who did it had slipped up and got his leg
crushed when the tried to move the last reactor.  His buddies left him
there as well.  The only thing uglier than a corpse is one that\'s been
soaked in ammonia for a week or two.

	All told, I was darn glad to get out of there; it was pretty spooky
sitting there with only a little superdense between us and far too much
radioactive caustic poison, watching waldocamera views of a dark, powerless
habitat that had been with flooded with ammonia for weeks.  There were
ghosts around every corner, if you know what I mean.  After we\'d figured
things out and salvaged what we could, Popie and I hustled the nuke into an
airlock, activated the timer, and we got the hell out of there.  I\'ll show
you a vid of what a couple of megatons of fusion bomb going off under an
ammonia ocean looks like from orbit when I get back.  It\'s a pretty awesome
sight.

	I spent the rest of the week in jump getting skinned alive at cards
by the Marines, and planning on how to get off the ship and into the
wilderness if we got interned by the Zhos if they\'d captured Jewell while
we were gone.  I was figuring on bailing with Mustapha and one of the
Marines, via grav chute.  But as it happened the Zhos had tried for Efate
first, so I didn\'t get the chance.

	Anyhow, while I was liaising with the Marines (a pretty good bunch,
all told), Popie was hacking into a few of the computers he\'d salvaged, and
found a couple of clues.  So off we went to Sternmetalls, and reported in.
They weren\'t happy with the news, but told us to stick around... and a day
or so later, hired us back on to go looking for the missing reactors.
Seems that between what Popie had found and their own intelligence, they\'d
had an idea of where the reactors might have gone.  So they hired us to go
to Lysen to find them, before we\'d even had a chance to read up on how the
war was going.

	Now this made me worry a bit, since what we do is SAR and salvage,
not espionage.  After a while I figured that we were just being sent out
there to beat around the bush and be clumsy, and Sternmetalls\' real spooks
would be there quietly watching to see what we stirred up.  Since we\'d been
ordered to nuke the research _and_ the crew if needs be, I didn\'t like the
idea of being used as bait...  but since they were paying us real well, off
we went.

	Lysen is a pretty dull little place; slight Co^2 taint to the
atmosphere, dim red sun, lots of rock and desert and not much to commend
it.  And it\'s this bizarre balkanized multi-corporate anarchotocracy.  I
never did figure out whether there was a government at all.  Even law
enforcement is run by a bunch of private security firms that protect you as
much as you\'re willing to pay them.  So anyhow, we arrive, and immediately
begin advertising our presence as loud as possible by doing net searches
for the prime suspects.  We bribed customs officials and had Sternmetalls\'
local big cheese drive over to our berth in a limo to meet us.

	After a couple of days of this, by which time probably every damn
criminal thug on the planet knew why we were there, we found out that the
agent for the captain of the ship which we thought might have done the
dirty work at the research base liked to hang out at this bar called The
Setting Sun.  It was a pretty nice bar; it was built into a cliffside, had
three levels, and had a great view of the sunset.  The walls were done in
local rock, which was kinda reddish too, so the colours were really wild in
there in the evening.  And the prices weren\'t bad, too.

	So what we did is we started hanging out there in shifts, looking
for the guy.  He isn\'t just some local mob type; for the subsector he is
pretty big fish; one of his companies runs the local system defense fleet.
We did this for a few days, until one evening Deschencko and I are there
trying not to look too suspicious, when a couple of renta-cops in really
bad uniforms tell us to take a hike because we\'re making their VIP
customers nervous with our guns (I had my varmint pistol* and Deschy had
one of the gauss pistols we\'d bought from the Navy).  Anyhow, we tried
negotiating, we tried to be nice, we pointed out that everyone else in the
bar was packing too, we even tried to buy coverage from their company.
Nothing doing.  Basically, they were just harassing us to get us out of
there.

	So, being civilized people, we did what we had to.  We got up and
let them escort us out of the bar.  And then we called Popie and Mustapha,
and they came right over, waved to us as they went in (we were hanging
around in the shadows by the entrance), and took our places.

	I haven\'t a clue what the hell it was that they did, because not
ten minutes later they come marching back out again, escorted by the same
two rentacops that had given us a hard time.  The rentacops walk Popie and
Mustapha right past us (it was dark and they didn\'t notice us) and down the
street a ways.

	What happened next was a life lesson; from now on, if I get a
chance to suckerpunch a cop (or anyone else) from behind, I\'ll take it.
Sometimes if you don\'t, you have to shoot them later.  What the cops do is
walk our buddies past us, away from the entrance to the bar, and then pull
guns to shoot them with.  Luckily, Mustapha and I had been expecting
something like this; I dropped one cop right away (killed him too, I think,
which is kinda hard on him even if he was just a two-bit thug) from about
15 meters.  Deschy missed the other one, and then things got a little
hairy; the second cop shot Mustapha in the arm, Deschy\'s gauss pistol
shorted out on him (that\'s the bad thing about gauss guns), the cop missed
me and hits the deck, yelling for me to drop it, and I just kept on
shooting until my varmint pistol went empty.  Luckily, I missed Mustapha,
who\'d passed out, and managed to clip the cop good with at least one shot.
He managed to hobble away, later, which was kinda dumb of him.  If he\'d
stuck around, I would have patched him up once I\'d done with Mustapha\'s arm.

	But anyhow, before I could get to him, Mr. Big Boss Man himself
shows up at the club door to admire the carnage and mayhem.  He was being
all big and bluff, and didn\'t at all seem to mind that we (well, I) had
blasted a couple of his flunkies a few seconds before.  He said that he was
covered; he might even have been, too.  Anyhow, he politely (well given the
circumstances) invited us to come for a ride with him in his limo.  He gave
me the time to patch up Mustapha\'s arm, and then off we drive to parts
unknown, talking on the way and me trying to keep Mustapha from messing up
the upholstery.

	Upshot was is that Mr. Big was in the process of being ripped off
by a couple of his associates.  One of them was his wife, who\'d taken such
a dislike to Popie and Mustapha that she\'d ordered the rentacops to have
them killed.  The other was the captain of the corsair that raided the
research base.  Anyhow, he said he\'d deal with things, while we enjoyed the
hospitality of his country place.

	Well, the country place was about 200 meters up a sheer cliff a few
hundred klicks off in the desert.  It was pretty nice and comfortable, but
it was a long way down and nowhere to go.   And the bastard locked us in
there for a week while he dealt with things.  A few hours after we got
there, some of his flunkies dropped Siich off too; she was pretty scared,
and somehow seems to have spotted Mr. Big\'s wife for a Zhodani agent of
some sorts, and was convinced we were all going to die.  Now the way she
said this got me suspicious that Siich, who\'s real cute and likes to look
people in the eye, might also be psionic, since I can\'t figure out how she
learned all this stuff if she wasn\'t.  So I started thinking really
perverted and ugly thoughts, just in case she was listening.  Still am, but
I can\'t tell whether she\'s heard.  Anyhow...

	So about a week later, The Dude Himself comes back to pick us up,
looking like the cat that ate the canary and all happy to see us.  Seems
he\'d figured things out.  So he gave us this datacube to give to our bosses
at Sternmetalls, gave us a lift back to our docking berth, and told us to
stay away from Lysen in future.  Ma, I have every intention of doing
precisely that.

	Anyhow, we got paid in full by Sternmetalls when we got back, which
is kinda lucky; the exec who\'d been giving us our marching orders threw up
when she saw what was on the datacube.  I think that what she saw was a
demand for a pretty big ransom.  Anyhow, serves her right for sending a
bunch of inexperienced stooges (that\'s us) to do a spy\'s job.

	And that brings us up to today.  I don\'t know what we\'re going to
do next, but we made a very tidy profit on the past six weeks, so Popie
will be able to pay me and make payments on the ship no sweat.  Sorry that
I haven\'t written more often, but as you can see, I\'ve been very busy.  Say
hello to everyone for me, and tell Irm=E4=E4 I say he\'s a grikhead for letti=
ng
that basa sit on him.  Another year or two of this and I\'ll have enough to
buy a crawler of my own, and then I\'ll come on home.

    'body' => 'Various posters are right. Free Traders are uneconomic for trade rules as
written in the various incarnations of Traveller.

Hans is also right, in that traders are only economic doing 35 jumps a
year, which means you need a Trade Station including a warehouse on planet,
and preferably a blue crew/gold crew arrangement as well, in order to
maximize the time the asset (the starship) is earning money.

The solution that combines the two is that free traders do long-distance
trade, and the corporate concerns do short-haul trade.

The Free Trader specialises in trade that goes further - in most cases a
lot further - than one jump. That way, they get the short turnaround (jump
in, refuel and go) of the corporate corcerns, which leads to the equivalent
distances travelled. Their cargos are high-worth, time-dependant cargos.

There are a lot of those in Traveller - most military goods are worth in
the range of a megacredit per displacement ton, and if you can buy them at
Sylea at a 10% discount, then at Cr1500 per jump you can afford to go at
least 30 jumps to find somewhere that will buy them at full price before
you start losing money.

Most Free Traders cant afford to fill their holds with such cargos, so the
Patron, who owns the cargo, comes along, probably bringing a couple of
ex-Marines to make sure that the crew dont try to hijack the cargo :)

Either that, or the Patron kindly employs the Captain\'s family on his
country estate, and expects that you will send a letter home each time you
dock for fuel.

Hey, with one swoop we just made trading far more like Adventuring and gave
the Pirates a break (cargos may be valuable enough to risk losing a ship to
capture them).

Historical examples of such trade include the Samarkand route of the
Muscovite merchants, anybody going to China before the telegraph and, of
course, the Spanish Main.

Well, I have to ask what the *point* is. If you are under attack, that
"escape pod" is going to be *less* well protected than the ship. So
it\'s *less* likely to survive. 

Remember, unlike the Enterprise, the Galactica, and Imperial Star
Destroyers, a *real* spacegoing warship will not have the bridge
anywhere *near* the outer hull. It\'ll be in towards the center of the
ship so as to have the most protection possible. A "window" gives you
no useful info when the enemy is thousands of km away.

And since ships damaged from something other than combat neither sink
nor fall out of the sky (unless operating *way* too close to a planet),
again, there\'s no *need* to eject. And you\'ll be easier to find if you
stick with the ship.

In combat, if you are about to get nailed, you either try to cut power
and "play dead" (the escape pod acting like a hunk of debris would be
equally survivable), or you surrender (the escape pod doing the same
would also be survivable). 

Note that in both cases, the results are the same. Either you get away
with the trick (in the first case), or you are captured as prisoners
(in the second case). So where\'s the advantage in the pod?

Having something "living" as part of the computer would allow _true_
randomness to  enter into the equation, which means it could actually be
pretty good at going "outside the box".  It doesn\'t automatically make it a
"Turing Machine" but I think that living matter and massive computer databases
could turn it into a pretty random opponent.

Especially considering the fact that we are talking several thousand years in
the future here.

Hmmm...  Naasirka might want one for their own research.  It could be just the
part that Delgado needs for its new line of warbots and robotic vehicles.
Most megacorporations would have an interest in it right off the bat, even if
it just turns out to be a fancy, delicate, bulky novelty.

The living matter could have unpredictable growth rates, or could die off
inexplicably, and where are you going to find replacement "chunks"?
Especially if the computer is hooked up to vital systems.

The living matter could introduce unwanted elements of randomness into the
calculation (again, specifically if hooked up to the vital systems).

The living matter could be (ironically) extremely sensitive to electro-
magnetic fields and react unpredictably or develop cancers and tumors (is
there a doctor on board?  do you know blobbie-biology?).  The blobbies could
be somehow psionic and crush everybody\'s minds into ooze.  Just kidding.  But,
they could be sensitive to psionics and react strangely but predictably.  The
Imperium may want to examine the genetic code for help in sniffing out
insidious Zhodani agents.  Aslan could be extremely sensitive to the blobbies
and it could be uncomfortable or painful.

The genetic code could be already patented by SuSAG and they demand the whole
kit and kaboodle if they happen to find out about it.

The blobbies could be quarantined like fruit at an airport.

These are all just off the top of my head.  I haven\'t really put alot of
thought into any of the options, and I could probably come up with tons more.

>I\'d like to develop some technical aspect of why this computer is better

Trinary computers could be faster by a good degree.  Combined with organic
material could be much faster.  Could be slower in doing some things though.
Storage space would be increased by a pretty good factor.  Code for the
hardware would be smaller, requiring far less instructions which would
increase the speed of the machine considerably.  Encryption created using the
computer would be more difficult to break, and it would probably be a little
better at decrypting stuff.

The possibilities could potentially be limitless, especially using the already
high-tech far future technology.  After all, the neurons in our own brains
have 8 seperate states I believe.  3 seperate states could be amazingly
"intelligent" (maybe not sentient, but able to really, really perform).

Hope this helps somewhat.

  FWIW, we wish we knew what a so-called free-market equilibrium interest

  Depends. I can\'t recall the technical term, but we would like to know
whether tightly scheduled shipping is a readily enterable market. If your
customers get a few points discount for multi-year contracts, and other
companies with their own routes want to keep the peace, then any small
newcomer can be exterminated by predatory pricing based on volume and
cash reserves. Therefore, the little guys won\'t try for the same market
as you.

  Catch-22. They must be justified in some way (perks for the board? :> ),
but they don\'t tell us how. Again, it\'s possible that some unspecified
input or effect makes it desirable. It\'s much easier to ignore those boats
for calculating the shipping arms viability. Perhaps those ships are "loaned"
to planetary governments that are helpful about port concessions, to enable
them to crack down on irresponsible small operators, who everyone knows are
all smugglers, slavers, and pirates anyway...

only wanted to scare them away - but what do you expect of some bikers?)

Fact is, you must get a thumb onto this early enough, or it is getting 
hard - I learned this lesson by myself. But some ideas for your plot 
that I used:

In the Adventure \'Artifacts unearthed\' form JTAS 26 my group went in 
there with two battledresses and one FGMP. (one of the dresses is a 
former marine and good roleplayer, so I let him this one. The Air/Raft 
they earlier had was bombed away by a psychopathic killer, but that\'s 
another story.)
Remember, the planet has a high CO2 concentration (The O2 is so less 
that in my campaign the group had to wear combination masks):
Every time the FGMP was fired, the whole area filled with Carbon dust, 
which reduced the visibility to none (and made the weapon less effective). 
Additionally, the shift of the atmosphere that was induced by the shot 
made the carniworms even more agressive. And I sent them more  
carniworms they could kill anyway with one battery - no one falling by 
the first shot!
On the way back, our player still did not yet realize he was making more 
havoc with his weapon that he made good with, another one pulled his 
socket out of the battery. They were short before an interpersonal fight, 
but that was NOT my problem! 

If you\'ve got the JTAS, this will probably get you an idea for the next 
session. Or perhaps has anyone a new idea for me?

One next thing I\'m planning is to let them visit a colony village some way 
off-road of the cities. When they arrive there, they will find a lot of 
dead rat-like animals in some tons, and dead bodies everywhere in the huts.
Should anyone make an analysis they will find two words one their scanner:

*Yersinia pestis*

And one of the Garages is empty ...

That would be my version of the biologic hazardous agent.

The basic problem with the trade rules is the uniform freight and passenger
rates for all ships and jump distances. A 200 T ship can certainly make a
living if only it is allowed to charge enough to cover its expenses. And
all that requires is that it has no rivals underbidding it (And has no
artificial upper limit to the rates, of course). Thus a 200 T ship can make
a living jumping back and forth between two systems IF the trade between
the systems is too small to be profitable for a larger ship (larger ships
are more economical than smaller, but only if they can fill their holds and
cabins -- for a fixed small trade volume the smaller ship is, of course,
more economical).

Unfortunately the most economic way to do long-distance hauling is by
jump-3 and jump-4 ships (Provided the distance is a number of parsecs
that is evenly divisible by the jump number and the route dosen\'t
include short jumps; I haven\'t done the calculations, but I would imagine
that a jump-2 ship may be better than a jump-3 or jump-4 ship for some
distances and some routes). You could propably come up with some jump-2
long-haul routes, but not many, and few or no jump-1 routes.

But why would the companies not get into that trade too? Again, all other
things being equal, a larger ship is more economic than a small one.

Ah, trade... Yes, my calculations so far have only dealt with straight
freight and passenger traffic. Yes, the additional profit on a good
trade cargo can help out, but where did this free trader get the money
to buy a load of military hardware worth more than the full value of the
ship he has an 80% loan in? Again, this sort of trade seems to be more
in the line of a company than a free trader.

>Most Free Traders can\'t afford to fill their holds with such cargos, so
>the Patron, who owns the cargo, comes along...

Trouble is, this means the patron is pouring all HIS profit (on the cargo)
straight into the ship in which he has no interest at all. Plus, if you\'re
talking about 30 jumps-1, then a jump-3 ship will be about 30% cheaper for
him and he will get his money 3 times faster. For long-distance travel you
have to factor in the loss he suffers from not being able to reinvvest his
money for over a year.

Frankly, I don\'t see how a Free Trader can compete with an established
company as long as he has a new ship and the bank payments associated
therewith (And I most especially don\'t understand how he managed to
persuade a bank to loan him the money in the first place). OTOH I don\'t
see why a group of PCs have to have a new ship. Why not let the first
ship roll a PC captain makes give him a 40 year old ship worth only 25%
of the original purchase price and the usual mortgage? With bank payments
one quarter size he can compete and with a 40 year old ship the Referee
can siphon off excess money by judiciously applied breakdowns.

The original FFS is a great book all around.  Technically at times it may be a
bit off, but it introduced standardization into the Traveller universe.  There
were certain "laws" that you\'d build things with so that consistency holes
could be all but removed.  Layout-wise it required tons of page flipping, as
the tables were spread throughout the book.  The index tabs on the sides of
the pages were very handy.

However, Mr.McGregor seems to have a burning hatred for FF&S for other
reasons.  He has been bitter about it for at least the six or seven months
I\'ve been around.  Dunno.  Maybe his kids were carried off by roving gearheads
to be part of their dark ceremonies with mechanical pencils and scientific
calculators :)

Actually, once you get used to the design system, having the tables in the
back isn\'t that bad.  Puts alot less wear on the book flipping back and forth
once you know what you\'re doing.  As for the sunburst, it hasn\'t hindered my
use of the product in any way.  In fact, I rather liked the touch.  Its light
enough that, at least to my eyes, it is unobtrusive.

But, I\'ll admit that putting the tables in the back makes it more difficult to
use for the casual user.

Um...  Not really.  Actually the most recent one is organized rather well.  It
is well indexed and follows an internal logic that becomes apparent with use.
The only "problem" is that you have to read the design sequences through and
pay careful attention before you even lay pencil to paper.

I have encountered no problems with the layout really, although some stuff is
a little unclear on first reading (I think more a writing problem).


Personally, I enjoy all of the above books and like using them.  I like the
techie aspect of Traveller because it doesn\'t detract from the game.  If you
don\'t want to use it, don\'t use it.  I like the fact that designs that come
from these books will be standard designs.  Mr. McGregor\'s problem with FFS
was that he thought they were needlessly complicated, but I think if you\'re
modeling something on real science, the book has to be somewhat complicated to
allow total flexibility.

Sure its no High Guard, but, on the other hand, you can\'t make a handgun with
High Guard.  You have no control over the components you place in a ship in
High Guard.  There aren\'t even any _sensors_ in High Guard!  All of the
electronics get absorbed by the "computer" component.  What if I want to
install a higher tech computer into my starship, but leave the sensors the way
they are?  What if I want to install better sensors?  Etc...  etc...

why is it that some forms of handwaving are acceptable and unchallenged, while
anything new is scrutinized under a magnifying glass and often discarded?

The Traveller universe is several millenia away, and yet with the exception of
interstellar travel, reactionless drives, cryoberths, lasers and gauss guns,
there is precious little "high tech" around.

Is there some collective mental block on Traveller fans?  Or are certain
things so earth shattering as to change the universe completely (full-scale
nanotech is one such thing that would change the universe completely, I mean,
if replicators could be built by other replicators then there wouldn\'t be much
need to go from planet to planet in a search for elusive credits) or are there
other reasons?  Computer science seems to be toned down in a huge way in the
Traveller universe as well.

Some examples:  reactionless drives.  jump drives.  If we can suspend our
disbelief to cover these things (one seems to violate the laws of physics, the
other circumvents them nicely) how come artificial intelligence,
teleportation, genetic engineering, cybernetics and nanotech all seem to be
completely taboo?  This is especially strange considering that some of these
are actually becoming pretty advanced in our day, a mere TL8 society or so...

It seems like Traveller fans are unwilling to try to project too far into the
future and can only come up with improvements on today\'s technology.  It was
refreshing to see the TL16 weapons in the Emperor\'s Arsenal, weapons that were
more or less "non-canon".  I like the Anti-matter/Contragrav gun for example.
But these ideas in the Traveller universe are few and far between.

When Traveller first came out, there were no really "high-tech" weapons with
the exception of lasers right?  Then, later on came meson guns, and particle
accelerators, and plasma rifles...  But people accepted them and they became
part of the Traveller universe, and in fact, became almost "uniquely"
Traveller.

But why are Traveller fans so conservative on other issues?  Artificial
intelligence and artificial life are glaring examples.

Granted, some advances have the danger of changing the flavor of Traveller\'s
space-opera feel.  Cybernetics run the risk, if used improperly, of turning
the game into Cyberpunk in space.  Full-scale nanotech would eliminate the
Traveller universe as we know it entirely.  Teleportation has a number of
problems, both in "physics" and in in the very fabric of the universe.

This isn\'t an attack on anyone or anything.  It just seems that in a game that
relies so heavily on imagination and suspension of disbelief there seems to be
alot lacking when it comes to high-technology.  Sorry if anyone gets offended
by this post, because its not the intent. :)

It\'s reasonably sensible. In TNE\'s module rules, this kind of pod (
(self-sufficient but the owning ship can\'t operate without it, like the pod
in the modular cutter) requires no special support hardware on the supporting
ship. The bridge would need its own hull enclosing its volume, its own
power source and life support and maybe a maneuver drive. A disadvantage
is that the bridge has to be near the outside of the ship - I prefer to put
combat bridges deep inside (no windows) so they\'ll be protected by the 
bulk of the ship\'s systems (even though no combat system currently
models this...)

While you\'re at it, take advantage of the opportunity to put a big honking
chunk of component armour around the bridge (and the computers...)

This file contains instructions on how to care for your biological
components to get many happy years of use.  It also contains important
information on the limited three (Imperial Std) year warranty that comes
with every product we make.

The Biological Processor is not a true life form, but, like other living
tissue, it must be sustained with oxygen and food.  All that you need is
included in your bio-care kit, and replacement supplies can be found at any
Bio-Pro Corp representative located throughout the subsector.

Your service representative should have demonstrated the process of
refilling and cleaning the protein processing tanks that are attached to
the Model B340 BPA.  Please use only Bio-Pro Corp\'s protein mixture formula
and clean distilled water to fill this tank.  Use of other products or
water which has not been distilled may void your warranty.  When empty,
clean the nutrient tank with a clean sponge or brush and distilled water.
If additional cleaning is needed, use a mild digestable soap such as
Bio-Pro Cleanall(c) (cat# 11912A) available at your dealer.

The oxygen processing equipment is a self-contained filtering and
processing oxygen plant.  It should provide oxygen to your processor for
many years without service or replacement.  There is an air filter (HEPA
Certified, cat# 11233F) which needs to be replaced within 1 week (Imp.
Std.) of the indicator turning red (approximately every 6 months (Imp.
Std.), depending on local atmosphere).  This filter removes 99.97% of
airborne particles of a size .1 micron or greater.

The containment tank is a sealed, self-contained environment which provides
the Model B340 BPA with all its needs.  Heat, light, nutrition, and oxygen
are all supplied, along with the power/signal transmission equipment and
programming interface which electrochemically stimulates controlled growth
patterns in response to new programs or utilizes appropriate existing
patterns.  Crystalline data storage is included in this unit for standalone
operation.

Your healthy Model B340 BPA should have a bright white color with just a
tinge of pink.  If your B340 should turn grey or green in places you should
bring it to a certified Bio-Pro Corp technician/medic for treatment and
possibly replacement.  Likewise if the protoplasmic fluid surrounding the
processor becomes cloudy or opaque you should bring the unit in for service
immediately.  Opening the containment vessel or attempting service on any
of these closed systems yourself will void your warranty.

This is a nice idea, especially for smaller ships.  In my deckplans for
larger warships, I usually put the bridge deep inside the ship, not near
the surface, so this might not work, as battle damage might block the
escape path of the module through the ship (and space would be wasted in
making the escape path).

I\'m not sure if there are deckplans (canonical or not) for ships larger
than the Azhanti High Lightning class, but I see no reason to put the
bridge of a warship where it\'s easily subject to incoming fire.  The
bridge crew is not looking out a window to make tactical decisions; it\'s
using input (including visual) from sensors all around the surface of
the ship, which can be wired to any point the designer wants.

   You bet; it wouldn\'t take very much sand, actually, to transform the
   rock\'s kinetic energy into x-rays.  Provided this sand was far enough
   away, the x-rays would diffuse to a harmless intensity before striking
   the world.
   
   Judging from Los Alamos\'s range-energy tables, the sand needed is less
   than 0.1 gram per square centimeter, distributed about some convenient
   depth (say, 10,000 km).  This much sand will slow the rock\'s protons
   and electrons down to `harmless\' energies.  It won\'t stop the
   neutrons, but they will scatter, just like the x-rays, to a harmless
   intensity if given enough range.
   
   The problem would be getting enough sand around a mainworld.  To place
   a 0.1-g/cm^2 shell at 100 diameters from an earthlike world would
   require 2.0E+19 kg of sand.  That\'s 1 300,000th the mass of the earth!
   Of course, any tech base advanced enough to pump 450 billion joules
   per gram into a fair-sized rock to get it going at 0.1c should not
   have too much trouble pumping enough energy into 2.0E+19 kg of sand to
   get it into orbit.  For smaller worlds, this mass requirement would
   decrease as the cube of the size rating. (Earth\'s size rating is 8.)
   
   This argument assumes that 0.1c is fast enough that the rock\'s impact
   with the sand will dissociate it.  Conservation of momentum tells us
   that a thin veneer of sand obviously will not do much to stop a rock
   unless it dissociates it to a lower density than the sand.

Hmmm,  This seems dependent on many things to me.  Frist and foremost is
the campaign style.  If you are not detail oriented or trying to tell a
story you might just have a rote sentance "Ok you get a vector and orbit
from the starport and they certify your documentation".

If, on the other hand, you run a detail oriented adventure there will be a
procedure to follow at every starport and spaceport.  Each will be a little
different, especially for busy ports vs. quiet ports, but will generally be
similar;

1). Arrive insystem.  Immediately send an ID and "Standard Package" which
includes your ship\'s ownership information, cargo manifest, passenger list,
crew list, letters of credit (see below), and special instructions.  Most
of these are prepared by the starport you departed from and are verified by
their "seal" (electronic probably, but sometimes these would neeed to be
presented in paper form).  There is also a health and safety certification
which establishes that there are no communicable diseases onboard and that
the ship itself is safe to manuver close to populated orbital facilities.

A course to the starport will be given at this time.  A berth or orbit will
be reserved per your preference.  They will need to know how long you are
staying.

2).  Customs inspection.  If the starport has reason to believe there is
any smuggling or other illegal activity going on, or if they are the type
to make random inspections, they will send a "revenue cutter" on an
intercept course to match vectors and board.  This is fairly routine and
can involve any range of activity from a friendly drink in the crew lounge,
to a full blown financial audit or a safety inspection.  Cargo inspections
are generally done in port, since cargo bays are usually as tightly packed
as possible.

>Once docked, there must be more red tape, inspections, paperwork
>(electronic, I\'d assume), and fees.  Any info on this as well?

3).  Docking & Unloading.  A "welcoming Party" and Cargo inspections are
the norm.  Generally there is a starport \'Inspector\' positioned to patrol
3-12 docking bays looking for illegal activity or cargo.  S/he is generally
equipped with good handheld instrumentation for detecting drugs,
explosives, radioactives, etc. and a radio.  This person will meet the
ship, test the internal atmosphere again for germs etc (a revenue cutter
will do this too) and generally look around.  This person will periodically
show up when cargo is being unloaded, and might (with cause) ask for a
certain cargo container to be opened.

4).  Arranging payment.  The ship will get a bill for berthing and
inspection services, as well as any fines or fees for special cargos, use
of loading/unloading equipment or crew (Union!), etc.  This will generally
be charged against the ship\'s Account.  This is a "cash" account at the
local branch of the bank the characters use for their financial services.
They carry a letter of credit from the previous location which is downright
difficult to forge, and if it is forged the bank *will* catch up with the
characters eventually.

Some ships carry a lot of cash.  This is suspicious and may generate
unwanted inspections.  All ships carry *some* cash and generally draw a
little "pocket change" against their credit.

Banks are huge, networked bodys which keep duplicate records at every
branch, and at affiliated banks.  If a ship payment is due on 030-1107 and
your ship is in port on that date, they will debit your account for the
payment according to prior arrangements.  The ship\'s schedule is a matter
of financial record also, and if your schedule says you were in jump on the
date payment was due, the bank will debit your account on the next possible
date.  In all cases, your bank account basically "follows you around"
wherever you go.  Many schemes have been attempted to cheat the bank out of
a payment or two, but most are detected and thwarted.

5).  Departure.  Cargo loading onboard is generally not inspected.  The
ship is certified safe (medically and mechanically), a letter of credit is
issued for the remaining bank balance, a certified cargo manifest and
passenger list is prepared by the starport for the ship (The crew list is
the same - or is updated if necessary), and off they go!

Hard currency is good for business.  Seriously, there is, in every culture,
an \'underground economy\' in illegal, unlawful, or simply unacceptable goods
and the Imperium has an interest in keeping this trade alive.  If its not
done with Imperial currency it will be done with some other form of trade.

I\'ve blabbed enough now, I\'ll let others answer your last question.

Actually, I think your point illustrates why the escape plug could be such a

the (presumably) larger chunks of the vessel uncontrolled, making them a less
enticing target/more obvious kill, and 3) in the case of
explosion-as-a-result-of-non-combat-situations you get the crew out of harms
way when they might have no reason to suspect their lives are in danger. 

Of course, this could devolve into a thread about how these \'lifeboats\' become
glorified targets with squishy bits inside, but I might counter THAT by
pointing out that by general agreement MOST combatants avoid shooting ejected
pilots \'in the chute\'.

Exploring cybernetics more fully could also lead to a lot more than
cyberpunk - there are a lot of unexplored avenues. It could also lead to 
significantly different cultural, social, economic, and political systems. 
Our group is playing a Blue Planet campaign now where implanted computers
are being used in a decidedly non-cyberpunkish manner. It gives the 
GM some new ways of giving characters information, is affecting the tone
of the role playing in positive ways, and opens up some interesting 
avenues for plot devices. 

The trinary logic computers mentioned in some earlier posts hold 
similar interesting opportunities. They sound like fuzzy logic taken
to an extreme.

I wonder if several bio-processors could be networked together and mirror

I\'m opening myself up for untold criticism but I seem to remember a
number of years ago reading something that said the original Traveller
made four assumptions about technology; 1) jump drives and ftl travel,
2) efficient fusion power plants, 3) anti-gravity technology and I
don\'t seem to remember the last.  Everything else was based on
\'logical\' extensions of existing technology.

I completely disagree with your notion about how the Cymbeline chips and
non-sentient Imperial chips could ever hope to have anything to do with each
other ... but anyone who likes "Blood Music" can\'t be all bad (now where\'s *my*

I don\'t *necessarily* think TNE is poorly laid out. Well, the weapon design
system is, IMHO, unuseable *COMPARED TO* BTRC\'s 3G3 (sure, you *could* use the
FF&S system, but why would anyone bother when Greg has done such a beautiful job
with 3G3 ... professional Spreadsheet and all). I just think that the whole
system was unneccessarily complex ... compare the vehicle design system with
that of BTRC\'s excellent "Vehicle Design System", the latter is much quicker and
easier to use. No complex calculations involved, and explanations for tech and
why some of the assumptions are probably bullshit -- but *work* nonethless. And
as soon as a Spreadsheet is available, well, it will make all versions of FF&S
(as well as GURPS Vehicles #1 and #2) look like a sick joke!

No, not really. You might not remember, but one of the mini-flame wars about IG
started because *I* gave much the same summation of IGs lack of ability compared
to new startup companies who were capable of putting out superior layed out
products right from word one. You don\'t need to preach to the converted!

Yes. I understand, and do not dispute this. This is not the basis of my argument

The problem is, you seem to be able to believe that you can convert non-living,
evolutionarily dissimilar (and, almost certainly, vastly different -- though I
hesitate to use the word "evolution" in conjunction with dead Imperial Chips),
into *living* chips simply by some sort of data packet! This is plainly
farcical.

I have no trouble with the Cymbeline chips being so co-opted -- they, after all,
are what the attack is aimed at. I do not believe the bs explanation that the
transponder system (especially on military or Scout service ships) would be tied
into all the other computerised systems or would be broadcasting *all* the time.
This is so obviously silly and unnecessary that it just doesn\'t bear even
considering seriously.

What I do have trouble with is being told that Virus can somehow turn completely
unrelated (evolutionarily speaking) organisms (Imperial chips) into living
copies of itself. Cymbeline chips are *already* living, Imperial Chips aren\'t
(otherwise, why use Cymbeline chips?). Cymbeline chips therefore have the
facility to be subverted, Imperial chips do not.

Sure, assuming (the completely ridiculous) idea that all ships transponders work
in the way that they are claimed to do, then it is possible that the
transponders could infect the main computers. The perfect defence, however,
would remain as I have stated -- disconnect the transponder and power down the
main computers, then reboot with clean, read only, media. A major hiccough, but
not civilisation destroying.

And to claim that all the alien races outside the Imperium would adopt the
Imperial Transponder system as a matter of course is also plainly ridiculous.
The Imperium is a trading entity -- anything that restricts trade with it is a
*bad thing*. And, sure, I can just see all those independent empires kowtowing
to the Imperium and using its transponders -- sorry, simply won\'t happen.

Anyway, any system that doesn\'t allow for the fact that machinery -- and even
computers -- malfunction sometime is garbage. This means that there will be
protocols for handling non-transponder equipped ships that do not remotely
involve "shoot on sight" orders, even in a war zone. And the likelihood of the
hundreds of thousands of imperial ships being re-equipped with Cymbeline tainted
transponders all the in the very short period we are led to believe is also
quite ridiculous.

Its not just that the idea of Virus is silly, its all the other *little things*
that add up against it.

There is evidence through the TNS that people did know what was happening.
Anyway, there would be enough people who *would* power down the computer in such
circumstances -- there must be a protocol along those lines if you have AI or
semi-AI computers.

This is, unfortunately, unbelievable. It is worse, it is ridiculous. Like I

micro-organism) by somehow sending an email to you.

And the problem with that is it assumes, as does Survival Margin, that the whole
Imperium is engaged in a mutual and knowing suicide pact -- that they have no
anti-viral protection measures at all (Shuddusham Accords, IIRC, mentioned in
Survival Margin anyway), which is complete garbage as well. Any protection would
make the widespread success of even just a data-infection virus (which I do find
believable) unlikely.

Which is also ridiculous. They did. Even Survival Margin says they did. They
just chose to sign a mutual suicide pact. Which is ridiculous, as it assumes
that human nature has changed in fundamental ways that it obviously hasn\'t.

No one is claiming that it did. Note that all the original post did was that
"many people *proclaimed* that Virus was the fault" and all I did was note that
it turned me off completely.

Unfortunately, if you think in both terms as you suggest, it becomes even more
obviously garbage. I think its safe to say that these opposed positions are only
going to lead to flame wars (and have in the past) and we\'ll simply have to
agree that each side thinks the other\'s position is ridiculous.

Teleportation - physically impossible. There\'s too much information
to transmit, to say nothing of the energy needed. Well, that is, unless
you\'re Zhodani. :) Teleportation exists, but only as a small-scale
psionic effect. With limitations.

Genetic Engineering - ever read Rats & Cats? Maybe not. But the Solomani
have made extensive use of GenEng, uplifting other species, modifying
humaniti, doing all sorts of stuff.

Cybernetics - hm, it doesn\'t get mentioned much, but it does get
mentioned a bit... it\'s mostly a background thing - most Imperial 
worlds eitehr aren\'t interested or don\'t have the technology.

Nanotech - nanotech as a concept is barely 10 years old. Traveller
pre-dates nanotech bye a whole decade. :) Nanotech is a "singularity"
as its creators put it - beyond the point where nanotech becomes 
real, everything changes so much that you can\'t even imagine what
it\'s like. Which makes for a bad game supplement...

New from GDW!

Supplement 15: Nanotech

Things are so wacked, you can\'t even imagine what it\'s like. 
Really. You can\'t.

(That\'s actually the entire supplement, in the press release)

Anybody care to resurrect the Vilani versus Solomani attitudes-
towards-technology-and-why-everything-in-Traveller-is-really-
boring debate?

Seriously though, while Trav is pretty consertative in its
approach to technology, that\'s partly by design. Anything
more wacky becomes difficult for players to get a good grasp on.
Hell, I find it hard enough to explain the Traveller backdrop to
people as it is... "You see, I have to explain about 3000 years of
future history for this to make sense, so hold on a second..."

I like to add a bit of detail to that.  One of the benefits of Imperial
membership is this cute series of satellites (5) positioned around the planet at
the 10 diameter point (or where ever you demarcate the Imperial/Planetary
border).  On arrival insystem, a merchant can broadcast a special \'ping\' and
receive answers back from these satellites.   One satellite will return system
data (i.e. library data) and at least two of the others will send timing and
position sequences.  By measuring the return time on the three signals, the Nav
program can calculate the position of the starship in relationship to the
mainworld (and the rest of the system).   This also tends to announce your
arrival insystem - a Class A or B Starport (or a world with Tech A+ in any case)
will generally detect the J-energy involved with emergence within 200
diameters.  If the campaign allow for pirates (I\'m not starting that thread
again!  I said _IF_) being silent until the ship\'s sensors can position the ship
without external data input may be the appropriate option.  However, if your
ship is detected on arrival, and you do not announce yourself in a reasonable
period of time, you can expect the Starport/Planet/Detecting Agency to initiate
some form of communication.

I also include Imperial \'Health and Comfort\' inspections.  A \'H&C\' inspection
can literally cover any spectrum that the Imperial Inspector has the facilities
to support.  These are initiated in space, but may continue to orbit.  A ship
which fails such an inspection will not be premitted to land anywhere but at a
Imperial facility.

This is an important person to get along with.  My Campaign has a 2 TL limit on
imports (you can only import technology 2 levels higher) unless you have a
waiver from the system Count, or his representative.  (It\'s one of the ways I
explain the TL disparity between planets - and it makes sense too.  A planet
cannot support advanced technology without the TL base, and constantly
purchasing high tech is a drain on the economy.)  If this person chooses to make
an ass of themselves, you can spend most of your week in port just justifying
your cargo - and not even start finding exports.

I disagree here.  All merchant ships carry a *lot* of cash (in the form of
CrImps, Corporate Bearer Bonds, Bank Letters of Credit, etc...).  Electronic
credit is fine for a ship that just picks up cargo, but if you are speculating
you are paying cash on the barrel.  The way I run it (and this is subject to
interpretation, I know) - if you are just picking up a cargo and passengers you
can get away with advertising at the starport.  But if you are speculating, you
may set up a meet through a broker, but unless you are buying a pig in a poke
(i.e. blind) you have to get out on the world and to the seller.  Some of the
larger brokerage firms will deal with credit - but a small broker (i.e. Starport
D-) will want and need liquid funds in order to facilitate the purchase.  And,
as a starship owner, are you going to accept a credit transfer that may or may
not be accepted once it\'s validated at a major starport?  Remember, Class D and
E starports do not have the facilities of a Class A or B.

I have a lot of hoops that the merchant has to jump through.  TL waivers for the
point of destination (if required); End Use Certificates for military equipment;
etc..

Imperial currancy is great for high tech worlds, worlds with Class A or B
starports, or worlds with a high Imperial presence (Sector/SubSector Capitals).
Get out onto the Starport E, TL-3 worlds tho\', and your credit card isn\'t going
to do a lot of good.  Start dealing on the fringes of society, where it is
important that a transaction NOT be traced, and cash becomes important.  One of
the good things about cash is that you cannot void the transaction - once you
have handed it over you have made a committment that can be depended on.  Try
and guarantee a mercenary contract with a credit card, for instance, and you may
find yourself in a bit of trouble.

In a similar vein, there was this guy who wrote computer code to do
"something" and he decided he wanted to make it smaller.  What the code
actually did is unimportant.  
So this guy wrote crazy software and turned the code into "artificial life"
with certain rules.  After a certain amount of time the code would "die" they
could mate and produce offspring, and the offspring would have a chance of
random mutation.  The mutation would make the code smaller.  The code would
"die" quickly if it didn\'t do what the original code did.

What eventually happened was, after many iterations, the code became ultra
teeny, but still did what it was programmed to do.  He sponsored a contest on
the internet and alot of people tried to write a program that did the same
thing, only smaller, and nobody came close.

This is in the book _Out of Control_.  I forget the author\'s name off the top
of my head, but it is a fantastic book.  I can get the name of the author if
anyone would like.  The book deals with artificial life and robotics and
various things like that.  Very good read.

I think evolving chips is fantastic, and I think it could make the computer
industry grow even faster then it is now (what, my computer will be obselete
even quicker? :).

As I\'ve stated in another message, I think that Traveller tech is highly
conservative in alot of respects.

IIRC, this puts them in a better position than the Solomani were when they

So *THAT\'S* why the kids have been missing! (And I thought it was because I
didn\'t have any -- obviously the evil gearheads have used their mind-clouding
abilities to remove my memories of them!)

Actually, I have nothing against Scientific Calculators (I actually own a
moderately good one, a Sharp EL-5120 programmable -- I just objected to the
stupidly overly (and needlessly) complex system of FF&S which, when used to
attempt to reverse engineer real world designs, simply didn\'t come close most of
the time. GURPS Vehicles had a similar problem, but was so much simpler to use
that it could be worked around -- GV2 has removed that problem, but made the
system too complex to be usable.

The system I use now? Well, I use BTRC\'s VDS (Vehicle Design System), which is a
little beauty ... sure, you need a scientific calculator to use it, but it is
really not all that much more complex than "High Guard" when you boil it down.
And, best of all, the design sequence flows smoothly and logically -- *and* you
*can* reverse engineer vehicles using the system and get accurate (or close to)
real world results!

Actually, I didn\'t say anything else that you commented on -- so blame the
originator of those other comments, not *me*!

Archduke Norris (the former Duke of Regina) ordered a quarntine running
across the middle of Deneb.  Residents on the wrong side of the line had a
very short period to pick up and move.  *Nothing* that could harbor Virus
was allowed in with the refugess.  Ships were stopped and had their
computers checked with a fine tooth comb while the Navy stood by at point
blank range.

Once the grace period ended, nothing moved across the border.  Any attempt
to enter Regency space was considered hostile.  One Vampire Fleet did
penetrate, with a single battleship making it to Trin where it massacred
much of the planet\'s population before suiciding onto the planet\'s surface.

At the time of the Regency Sourcebook, preperations were underway to allow
settlers across the buffer zone to begin reclaiming the previously lost
worlds.

	Everybody\'s going to give you their gearhead reason, or canon
reason, or whatever. Here\'s my take:

	The reason Traveller isn\'t more like {Star Wars, Star Trek,
Battlestar Galactica, Blood Music, Neuromancer, ...}, and doesn\'t
include technology like {Teleportation, Nanotek, Shields,
Phasers, Warp Drive, Neural Jacks, ...} is because Traveller
isn\'t {Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Blood Music,
Neuromancer, ...}.

	Marc Miller, et. al., were looking for a specific feel; even the
very first Traveller had a very "hard-science" feel.  Go back &
reread the space combat rules in the original LBB if you don\'t
buy that ... Having set that feel, it\'s been propagated forward,
until the entire fabric of what Traveller is formed. Start
throwing in other things, and you\'ll tear the fabric. Maybe you
can make something else out of the shreds, but it won\'t be
Traveller ...

Sure, nanotechnology won\'t work in gaming, it\'s just *too* odd, but 
genetic engineering, biological and cybernetic implants, massively

which have been used in SF literature for more than a decade, and which

Digest Groups was doing this, they even had a cyborg book and a genetic

technology of the Imperium has been left stagnating in 60s SF-land.

So, maybe we all can remedy this?

These weren\'t written for Traveller, but with a little work they
might be applied to it.

The first is a mapping tool which I originally wrote for fantasy
RPGing, but I got to thinking that it might be useful for Traveller
as well, particularly for regional maps (a section of a planet)
where a particular adventure or set of adventures are located.

        PROGRAM NAME: "MAPPER" [v0.1] {December 1997}
        AUTHOR: Jim Vassilakos (jimv@empirenet.com)
        FUNCTION: World Mapper
        OPERATING SYSTEM: IBM (MS-DOS)
        SIZE: 318,730 bytes zipped
        COMMENTS: Create maps with hexagonal color-tiles so you
              can share your RPG campaign world with the rest of
              us on the Net. Requires VGA graphics or better. May
              attach campaign notes to the map via an easy-to-learn
              menuing system. Two unfinished sample worlds already
              included. Note, you must use "-d" option when unzipping:
              >>>>>>>>    pkunzip -d mapper01.zip    <<<<<<<<
        If you draw up any campaign maps using this program, please
        send me a copy so I can include them in the next version...

The second one is a language program originally written to help me
pick up some greek, but I suddenly got to thinking that maybe the
people on the vilani-list might want to revise the data files
to their own nefarious ends... include it as part of a tutorial
in the vilani language, although this might require actual code
modification... i don\'t know vilani at all, so i can\'t say...

        PROGRAM NAME: "LANG" [v1.0] {December 1997}
        AUTHOR: Jim Vassilakos (jimv@empirenet.com)
        FUNCTION: Language Learner (Greek Version)
        OPERATING SYSTEM: IBM (MS-DOS)
        SIZE: 66,368 bytes zipped
        COMMENTS: Learn greek at your own pace via this
           flashcard program. You enter the words you want
           to learn (up to 500), then quiz yourself with both
           recall and recognition tests. Includes an uncompiled
           font editor to facilitate with the creation of other
           language files. All data files are flat-text for
           easy manual editing.

Anyway, just spamming the list with this gunk on the off-chance that
it might prove useful to somebody... both programs currently available
from my homepage:

          http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv

Just go to the programs section and snoop around... and if you have
trouble getting one or the other for whatever bizarre reason, let me
know and I\'ll send you a copy via email.

    'body' => 'Well, since I mentioned trying to change the rather low tech feel most of 
Traveller has, I\'ll start the ball rolling:

Plastic Surgery in Traveller:

TL 6 & 7:

Early Plastic Surgery, reconstruction only.

TL 8-9:

Moderate Plastic Surgery, early body-sculpting, basic disguises.  The
surgery is undetectable, but limited, disguises are imperfect unless the
individuals are very similar.  [No height modifications, +/- up to 10 kg]. 

TL 10-11:

Advance Plastic Surgery, body sculpting, realistic disguises as anyone
belonging within the appropriate height and weight range who belongs to
the same human subspecies, and fully functional (sterile) sex-changes.  It
is now possible to change skin color, apparent gender, height and weight
(within limits).  Change blood type, but not genetic type.  Fur and
unusually colored eyes and hair (purple, metallic blue...) are also
possible.  [+/- up to 5 cm in height, +/-up to 20 kg]. 

TL 12-13:

Bioengineered Implants, fully fertile sex changes, full disguise (retinal
scan, genetic profile, finger prints...) Early vat grown implants are
developed here.  These early vat-grown implants can enhance normal
function (Light intensification, enhanced smell and hearing) or they can
add wholly new functions such as full spectrum vision, normal-looking skin
as tough as Jack armor, magnetic sense, gills....  However, each implant
can have only a single additional function.  Modified eyes with the
capacity for both IR and telescopic vision are not possible at these tech
levels.  All Vat-grown implants are fully living tissue which becomes a
normal part of the subjects body.  Purely cosmetic changes like tails,
claws, cat-like eyes and similar oddities are possible.  At this tech
level a human can be made to look like any of the humanoid Star Trek
aliens (old or new).  [+/- up to 15 cm in height, +/- any weight]. 

By TL 13 an average human can be disguised as a normal member of most
other minor human races, a Vilani could be disguised as a Darrian).  At
these TLs Genetically engineered viruses as used alongside surgery to
perform most modifications. 

TL 14-15:

Undetectable, genetic disguises, advanced vat-grown implants and genetic
modifications (IR eyes, etc... ).  Change height by up to +/- 30 cm.  At
these TLs genetically engineered viruses have replaced surgery in most
applications.  Advanced vat-grown implants can have multiple functions, so
modified eyes could be designed to see both in the infrared and have
telescopic capacity, as well as seeing ordinary visual light). 
 
By TL 15, any human can be undetectably disguised as a normal member of
any of the human minor races (a Darrian could even be disguised as a
Geonee). [+/- up to 40 cm in height]. 

TL 16:

Memory dupe to prepared targets (basic memories, no details). By this TL
impersonation is almost impossible to detect unless specific precautions
have been taken to avoid it.  To Dupe memories the target must be scanned
for 6 full hours. This process is non-invasive, and can be done while the
target is unconscious. 

TL 19: [Ancient artifacts only] 

Advance Bioengineering:  

At this TL humans can be undetectably disguised as most alien species,
including Aslan, Droyne, or K\'kree.  Sentients can also be transformed
into ordinary looking, but fully sentient animals, or into life-forms
which combine the traits and appearance of several existing life-forms. 
At this TL all such changes are fully reversible, and take no more than a
month to perform. 

Comments?

I\'m seeing various body styles, including fur and unique mixtures of 
traits (like blue eyed Asian-looking faces with pale blue skin) being 
high fashion among the elite of some worlds (especially Solomani worlds)

There=B4s another more elementary reason teleportaion would not work.
Remember Heisenberg=B4s Relation? No one can equally well determine the=20

=20
could be a way of explanation.

Also do the Ancient Artifacts sometimes work as psionic devices.
All these things in fact are not impossible, they only are beyond tech leve=
l.

The Imperium as we know it only is 1100 years old - although it is set in=
=20
the 57. century of the Solomani Calendar. It is short before the end of=20
expansion. This is only one millennium, but is it enough to achieve=20
higher TL=B4s than 15? (There is a TL boom in nowadays Computer technology,=
=20
yes, but it will not last ever. There is a point to which it can go no=20
further, and I think it=B4s short before. At some times you need new=20
theories to go on.)

But there=B4s another way to explain the tech conservativity, which I think=
 is=20
logical. Remember the feudal system which holds the Imperium together.=20
What would happen if any world would let free to improve their own tech=20

=20
the problem that no neighbouring worlds could even fit their light bulbs=20
into one other=B4s socket! (Oh yes, I=B4m overstating a little bit ...)

To let space travel not be affected, there must be a way to control=20
Imperial standards - and you know what this means to the improvement rate
per time. This in fact would be the equivalent to the Vilani=20
conservationism that stagmated the whole first Imperium. In the third,=20
technological conservationism would lead to stagnating TLs.

I hope this will help explaining another bit of Traveller Universe, how I=

see it. The discussion is open now ...

I agree whole-heartedly with your post. You\'ve partially answered your own
question, of course. The Traveller universe was based on certain types of
American Science Fiction from the 50\'s thru mid-70\'s. So any new
developments in real or speculative science and tech since the 70\'s have to
be carefully scrutinized and filtered, to maintain the internal consistency
of the Traveller setting.

Traveller fans are clearly science-literate and capable of getting the hang
of virtually any speculative technology. Mostly the conservatism stems from
trying to maintain what consistency there is in the Trav universe.

Remember also that Traveller is a role-playing game, and it\'s just easier
to roleplay in a setting somewhat similar to one\'s own society. The more
alien the setting and characters, the harder it is to identify with, or
even to guess what one is supposed to _do_ from one minute to the next.

I\'ve been working for over a year just laying the groundwork for a
complicated Traveller campaign which integrates much of the above and more
(though not teleportation). Why is it taking so long? Because I\'ve had to
throw out the entire Imperium universe and start from scratch. Although I\'m
sticking to many of the precepts of the Traveller setting (1 week per jump,
for instance), I have to write a wholely new future history, map my own
game universe, invent all new alien species, as well as work out for myself
how all the new elements actually work, how the effect the society and
economy, how the players use and interact with these technologies, and - as
you point out - why there\'s still any kind of interstellar trade when
nanotech would seem to make it all unnecessary.

It\'s an enormous job, but I\'m having a ball doing it. Maybe someday I\'ll
actually have enough done that we\'ll be able to play the damn thing. And
yes, I\'ll post bits and pieces to the list when I feel they\'re ready.

That\'s a good reason to do it, actually. I never liked space opera much,
and feel there\'s \'way too much "Ensign Flandry" in the Traveller universe.
Even when Traveller first appeared in the \'70\'s I thought it was too
Fifties in its assumptions.

Also, Traveller is inherently conservative in the political sense: the game
assumes a libertarian far future where the Invisible Hand of the Market
rules all. This is fun for role-playing purposes, but I don\'t find it
convincing. I believe that nanotech, replicating automated factories,
biotech, and AI will add up to a society of vast overabundance, a
post-scarcity world where trade is much less necessary and largely a matter
of cultural exchange. In such a society, people achieve status not by
accumulating wealth, but by *giving it away* (as in West Coast native
\'Potlatches\' and New Guinea \'Moka\' ceremonies). This would be hard to work
into a role-playing game: the very possibility of such a society is
literally unthinkable to the vast majority of people today. We still live
in a scarcity economy and too many people seem incapable of imagining
anything else.

>Cybernetics run the risk, if used improperly, of turning
>the game into Cyberpunk in space.

Not necessarily. There are a lot of silly assumptions in the Cyberpunk
milieu (and I\'m referring here to the R.Talsorian view of Cyberpunk, not
necessarily to the works of Gibson/Sterling/Shirley/etc.). First is the
bizarre universal fetish for implants and prosthetics; though body
modication is popular in almost every culture - increasingly so in our own
- - does this really mean everyone is going to want to lop off their arms in
favor of myoelectric replacements? And while virtual reality is lots of fun
for playing games, is it really all that useful in day-to-day life? It
*might* be - I can imagine a future where most people go to school, work,
and \'hang out\' in virtual worlds - but again we run into the problem that
it\'s not great as a role-playing setting.

I *am* trying to integrate a lot of cybernetics and other new tech into my
game universe, but I\'m being highly selective and examining these things
with a lot of skepticism. For instance, I\'ve been thinking a lot about
nanotech, and ways to limit its abilities. This isn\'t magic, after all. I
assume that, below TL 16, nanotech requires highly controlled environments
to function at all - very low temperatures and very high vacuum. Here\'s a
related \'Library\' entry I wrote on the subject (note the extremely rapid
technological evolution from TL 8 to partial TL 13):
 
- ---- 
fabricator - Any device capable of automatically assembling a wide variety
of tools, materials, spare parts and other objects, given only the
specifications for their assembly and a supply of specially prepared
generic materials. Early protoype-fabricators (TL 8), capable of precisely
reproducing in plastic the form of complex objects, were first developed on
Terra in the late 20th century. Specialized industrial nanofacturing
systems (TL 12) appeared by 2010, and general-purpose home nanofabricators
(TL 13) were marketed in 2035. Even at TL 15, fabricators remain limited by
the supply of prepared feedstock molecules and the availability of
compatible object-specification software, both of which are inherently
expensive.
- ----

Other stuff that I\'m working into the game:

- - neomorph clades (variant human body forms, a la Sterling and Bear),
- - \'cogents\' (conscious machines),
- - widespread populations of uplifted species (a la Brin),
- - clones and several different types of clone society (including
parthogenetics, cadre societies, twinworlds, and others),
- - widespread use of ectogestation (artificial wombs and womb implants),
- - much, much more galactic history (going back at least 1.6 billion years),
- - haptic interfaces (electronic \'touch\' media) and \'sensies\' as pop media,
- - \'illyrion\' (superstable elements lifted from Delany\'s _Nova_, used as a
power source and essential jumpdrive componant),
- - inorganic species,
- - widespread synthetic life,
- - jumpspace planes connected by \'junction stars\',
- - slowspace planes (where jumpdrives don\'t work, interleaved with the
jumpspace levels),
- - nanoelectronics & nanofacturing,
- - photonics,
- - picting implants (from Bear\'s _Eon_),
- - widespread body switching and sex-changing (a la John Varley),
- - and radio CETI with civilizations throughout the Milky Way

...to start with, anyway :)

I\'ll be sharing more of my work on this stuff when it\'s in more coherent form.

Don\'t confuse a processor with a storage device.  A more appropriate
analogy would be a multi-processor computer...like a server with 4 pentium
chips working in parrallel.

Generally, the biological processors I am working with are a mature,
reliable technology.  Not one that routinely needs backups.  Of course,
once they leave the subsector...

Been there, done that.  Seriously though, I designed a ship (under
Megatraveller) which was a 1500 ton survey/exploratory trader which had an
ejectable bridge.  It was saucer shaped (no ST comments please) and was
basically treated as a 30 ton ship\'s boat in an external mount for design
purposes (although there was no airlock).  Ejecting the bridge not only
could save the bridge crew, it preserved what was then the single most
expensive component; the computer.

The thing was fitted with a single, one shot chemical rocket for \'blasting
clear\', as well as the obligatory explosive seperation bolts.  Since the
bridge already contained most of the commo gear there was no need for
additional emergency radios or such.  There was no real chance of long term
survival in the thing; no low beths, no jdrive, no way to land, but hey,
where there\'s life, there\'s hope right?

Oh, in combat when there was a hit on any bridge component I gave a 10%
chance that the bridge would spontaneously eject itself, effectively ending
the battle for those on the bridge (the ship did have an aux bridge near
engineering).  It would have been funny if this had ever actually occurred.

Next Question:

How much of this world\'s Sun\'s energy will be blocked by this cloud of
sand, and how will that affect the climate and habitability of the
world?

Of course, if the population had to choose between being pulverized by a
near-c rock and slowly freezing to death...

Right, The Military classes/refits of the AHL have a big bridge taking up
half of one of the decks in the "body".  On some of the vessels, however,
the domed area at the very end of "bowsprit" was either a \'running bridge\'
or a \'survay bridge\' I believe.  This was for the non-combatant (heh,
noncombatant with a PA spinal) Scout Cruiser version I think, or perhaps
for the Oberlindes "Armed Merchant" refit bopping around Vargr space.
Incidentially, AHL is one of the few official designs which orients the
"floor" of the decks along the axis of accelleration of the vessel instead
of perpendicular to it.  I love that ship.

Returning to topic, the modular ejection bridge concept works for me on
smaller (less than 5000 ton, merchant) vessels.  Its a chance to survive
when your ship is about to explode from damage sustained.  Sure, this
safety feature will only be useful in one in 1000 incidents, I haven\'t used
my airbags yet either, but Im glad I got them.

Teleportation, nanotech, artificial intelligence IMHO aren\'t high tech but
Science Fiction and as we all know; inventing more than a few unscientific
(in the sense that we cannot do back of the envelope calculations as to its
effects) technologies leads to serious changes in the sociology. This is
actually MORE of a problem in RPGs athan in fiction as the author can
decide of what his inhabitants will do but the ref will not.

I would like more robots/AI in Traveller as to me this will not change the
sociology much but nanotech - You\'d be better off with a totally different
rpg. My personal view after having read some nonfictional stuff from the
man himself (What\'s his name; Drexler right?) is that the nanotech he
describes is similar to steamdriven artificial intelligence. Workable in
theory but practical matters such as thermal effects, quantum "fuzziness"
and most important of all the complexity of programming the matter
compilers make them Ancient tech or worse.

Feels kind of like a dismissal to me :)

Star Wars:  Good movies, but from a technological point utterly backwards
(computer guidance systems?  what is a computer?  oh yeah, the imperials have
big ones with flashing lights.)

Star Trek:  Would never think of patterning a universe on Star Trek, and the
Traveller universe would have to be changed entirely to fit into it.

Battlestar Galactica:  Hmmm...  I remember liking the show when I was small,
but pilots with helmets that look like King Tut should have worn on a bad hair
day are pretty cool.  That\'s the standard dress for my Imperial Marines :)

Blood Music:  Ne\'er read it, assuming it is a book.

Neuromancer:  I liked the book, but its obvious that Trav and Gibson have
little in common.

I think you may have missed the whole point of the message entirely.  I asked
a question as to why people seem to be held back on technology in the Trav
universe.  My Traveller universe runs nothing like any of the above films or
books, nor would I want it to.  I\'m not a 10 year old kid with his first copy
of Traveller saying "Cool, I want to have a fight between the Executor and the
Enterprise" :)

My point was that there are many sciences that are becoming extremely well
advanced in the modern, real world that leaving them out entirely becomes a
gaping hole.  It was a question to see if there was some deeper reason that
these disciplines were being largely ignored.  I wasn\'t around when
battledress was introduced into the Trav universe, but did people say, "Hey,
Trav shouldn\'t be like Starship Troopers!" when it was?

Okay, maybe they were going for a "hard-science" feel, but now I know that you
missed the point of my message.  Genetic engineering exists today and is
actually used and is pretty advanced.  Sheep have been cloned and stabilized.
Baboons have been cloned and died shortly thereafter.  We have algae that can
eat oil to help clean up slicks in the ocean.  Yet, genetic engineering gets
only passing coverage in Traveller.  Nanotechnology exists.  There is alot of
money being pumped into the discipline, and alot of research is being done.
The japanese have actually turned out some of the tiny critters already.
Computer science is quite real and is advancing at a rapid pace, the same with
electronics.

Geez.  That\'s an awfully narrowminded attitude.  If we all stuck so closely to
the Traveller aesthetic, we would have no combat armor, no huge ships, and
perhaps even no grav tanks (they weren\'t covered by the original LBBs were
they?).

If we *don\'t* tone down computer science we wind up with Vernor Vinge\'s
singularity. That is, in about 100 years from now, things will have
changed so much as to constitute a *qualitative* change. And we
*cannot* concieve of the results.

Teleportation gives a different "feel" it also has some non-obvious
problems that tend toi make it lead to a short, bloody war. Read
Niven\'s essay "Theory and Practice of Teleportation" for a good
overview. 

Genetic engineering is another thing that quickly leads to an
unrecognizable society.

AI & cybernetics lead to the Singularity (Read Vinge\'s "Marooned in
Realtime" to get an idea of what that would involve). 

And nanotech also changes things beyond recognition. Heck, even
technology far *short* of nanotech, that we are already working on
will do this. Within a century we\'ll have boxes that you feed specs and
raw materials (anything containing the needed elements) and they\'ll
produce the item. S.M. Stirling called them "fabers" and others have
picked up the term. With such devices the sole limit on what you can do
is availability of specs for an item, and the size of item your faber
can handle (it\'s hard to build a car if the output opening is only 6
inches across :-). Again, this make society unrecognizable.

The problem is that *any* SF roleplaying game *has* to stick to only
"minor" advances in tech. If it doesn\'t you either wind up with the
players poking holes in things until it falls apart, or else you wind
up with a socierty/civilization that the players can\'t really deal with
because it\'s just too different.

Frankly *anything* set more than 100 years ahead is going to be pure
BS, unless they come up with reasons for things *not* changing.

Silly example. If a D&D/AD&D world actually *existed, it wouldn\'t look
much at *all* like the usual "medieval + magic" one. The magic can do
far too many things, and the people, not just a few adventurers, would
be using it. You\'d wind up with something more like our society, except
with magic instead of engineering.

Likewise, high tech has too many consequences, and builds upon itself
too fast for a *truly* future setup to be workable. You wind up with
Clarke\'s Law: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
from magic. And we can\'t guess the rules that magic will follow.

Particle beams *already* exist. Meson guns can\'t really exist, but if
they did, there\'d be other things related to whatever new principles
enabled them to work, that\'d have effects we can\'t imagine.

The basic problem is always that to be *playable*, the game has to be
essentially a slightly modified *now* with a few extra goodies thrown
in. 

Heck, even the technology Traveller *has* causes problems. Given the
sort of fusion power plants that exist in the game, it\'s *cheaper* to
process raw rock into its component elements than it is to import
materials from off planet!

I\'m not talking theory here. I\'m talking about something *we* could
build if we had that much power, that cheaply. And it\'s only a tiny
jump to assume that you can use the same tech that allows the fusion
reactors to make the element seperator (essentially an overgrown mass
spectrograph) even *more* efficient. 

So right there you have something that *cannot* have been overlooked
for as much as a century, much less the several millenia postulated in
the rules, that *totally* blows the setup.

KERYUTIAN FOREIGN POLICY AND PRACTICE AS EVIDENCED BY THE RECENT KERYUTIAN
CLAIMS TO THE AIMI ROCKS

     The Crisis
     The Legal Status of Aimi
     The Reaction of the European Parliament
     The International Court of Justice
     Keryut\'s Legal Assertions
     Political Aspects of the Dispute


Introduction

International treaties and agreements dating back to 1023 establish
unequivocally that the Aimi planetoids constitute an integral part of Sahel
sovereign territory.

The fact that the tension caused by the recent Keryutian claims to the Aimi
rocks did not erupt into immediate conflict does not in the least mean that
the danger has
receded. On the contrary, Keryut, through its former Prime Minister\'s
explicit threat to use military force against Sahel, continues to press
claims that are unfounded both in international law and in the established
practice of civilized relations among nations.

This recent crisis was particularly serious because Keryut\'s principal
argument establishing her claim to these planetoids is that the
International Treaties that set down the territorial status of the trailing
belt are not necessarily binding on Keryut. By questioning the sovereignty
of the Aimi rocks Keryut thus seeks to overthrow the territorial status of
the entire region.

At the same time, Keryut has consistently refused to support the assertions
she has suddenly put forward through peaceful and legal avenues, by
bringing them to the Imperial Court of Justice, as both Sahel, a number of
Anropeur Union polities, and the Kingdom of Acre have repeatedly suggested.

As will be seen in greater detail in the following paragraphs, the Aimi
rocks have been under Sahel sovereignty since the signing of the Sarip
Peace Treaty with Yaro in 1047. For half a century Keryut did not raise any
questions concerning the status of the planetoids and rocks. Unfortunately,
the reason she does so now falls within the well-documented pattern of
illegal Keryutian intentions and actions over the past twenty years.

More specifically, in 1074, Keryut invaded and occupied Pryscu in defiance
of international law and in the face of the indignation of the international
community, as expressed in numerous resolutions of the Security Council and
the General Assembly of the Imperial Senate.

At the same time, she turned her sights to the rest of the tailing Belt, by
setting up the so-called "Army of the Belt," a overtly offensive military
force equipped with the largest fleet of landing craft in the System.
Keryut also raised claims against Sahel sovereign rights concerning the
mass plateau, control of the skimming lanes of the gas giants, as well as
Sahel\'s right, as established in international law, to extend her
territorial waters up to 1.2 A.U.

In June of last year, the Keryutian Parliament passed an unprecedented
resolution authorizing the Keryutian government to use all means, including
military ones, should Sahel exercise her legitimate rights concerning the
extension of her territorial waters.

Keryut also challenges Sahel\'s national space lanes, backing up her claims
by frequent and at times massive violations of the space lanes by her
military spacecraft.

Unfortunately, the threat of the use of military force seems to be an
integral part of Keryutian foreign policy. Just as in the case of the
territorial waters, during the Aimi
incident Keryut brandished the threat of war in order to impose her
objectives, declaring that any attempt to question self-proclaimed
"Keryutian sovereignty" would
constitute a causus belli.

These actions, encouraged - at least initially - by the lack of any firm
reaction on the part of the international community, have now been proven
to be part of
Keryut\'s design to question Sahel\'s internationally established rights in
the tailing Belt, and to usurp sovereignty of at least half of the tailing
Belt, by officially rejecting the established legal status quo.

If Keryut\'s attempts to question the binding force of international
agreements were valid, then the majority of the treaties regulating
international frontiers after the
First and Second Frontier Wars would collapse.

The Crisis

On the 1095-333, the Keryutian Cargo ship "Figen Akat" ran aground on one
of the Aimi rocks, situated .25 A.U. from the Sahel planetoid of Minokali.
Although the accident occurred in Sahel territorial space, the captain of
the "Figen Akat" refused assistance from the competent Sahel authorities,
claiming that he was within Keryutian territorial waters. Despite
assurances to the contrary, the captain sought assistance from the
Keryutian authorities

Finally, in agreement with the Keryutian company that owned the ship, the
"Figen Akat" was set free with the aid of a Sahel tug boat, owned by the
company Matsas Star, and towed to the Keryutian port of Guklul.

On the 1095-337, the Keryutian Ministry of Foreign Affairs addressed a
Verbal Note to the Embassy of Sahel in Ankara, asserting for the first time
that Aimi constitutes a part of Keryutian territory, as it was registered
in the land registry of the Keryutian province of Mulga. It should be noted
that this was the first time that Keryut openly laid claims over actual Sahel
territory.

In response to Keryut\'s claims, on the 1096-010, the Sahel Embassy
addressed a Verbal Note to the Keryutian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In that
Note the Keryutian claim to the planetoids was rejected. The Note underlined
the fact that Keryut had reaffirmed Aimi as belonging to Yaro by virtue of a
bilateral agreement signed between the two countries in 1032, and that the
planetoids were subsequently ceded to Sahel with the rest of the Codedanese
planetoid cluster by the Sarip Peace Treaty of 1047.

Keryut then addressed a second Verbal Note to Sahel on the 1096-029,
wherein the initial claim was repeated and extended with the request for
negotiations concerning the status of all the asteroids, planetoids and
rocks whose status, according to Keryut, is not well determined.

In response Sahel addressed a Verbal Note to Keryut on 1096-044. In that
Note Sahel presented international legal documents and other facts
establishing unequivocally the territorial status of all asteroids,
planetoids and rocks in the tailing Belt. Sahel emphasized that no country,
including Keryut, had ever challenged that status in the past. The Note
concluded that, as is only natural, Sahel would not negotiate with Keryut
matters pertaining to its territorial sovereignty as established by
international law and treaties.

The tension over Aimi began to escalate on 027, when Keryutian journalists
from the newspaper Hurriyet took down the Sahel flag from the larger of the
two Aimi planetoids and raised the Keryutian one. On 028 a Sahel navy
detachment replaced the Sahel flag.

Initially, there were no naval units in the area except one Sahel unit and
a Keryutian torpedo boat. On 030, however, Keryut sent several ships to the
area, prompting Sahel to send an equal number. A Keryutian frigate violated
Sahel territorial waters targeting a Sahel gunboat that was patrolling the
area. A Keryutian recon drone launching off from one of the Keryutian
frigates flew past the Aimi rocks. At the same time, Keryutian fighters
repeatedly violated Sahel space.

The tension reached its peak in the early morning hours of 031, when the
Keryutian army landed some men on the smaller of the Aimi rocks. An Acre
mediation effort had already been initiated by means of repeated radio
contacts between King Lintnoc and Prime Minister Simitis, Secretary of
State Narew Ristophen and Under Secretary Bohrooke with Foreign Minister
Banpalos, and the Ministers of Defense Irsenas and Sherry.

After a special session of the Government\'s National Security Council in
the early hours of 031, the Ministers of Defense and Foreign Affairs
announced that an understanding had been reached by means of Acre
mediation. Both sides would withdraw their forces from the area of Aimi and
the situation would return to its previous condition (the "status quo
ante").

The Legal Status of Aimi

The Aimi planetoids lie at a distance of .19 astronomical units from the
Sahel planetoid of Kalolimnos, .53 a.u. from the Sahel planetoid of
Lakymnos, .365 a.u. from the edige of Keryutian space and .23 a.u. from the
Keryutian planetoid of Vacus (formerly Tako). Like the rest of the
Cocecanese planetoid cluster, they were ceded to Yaro by virtue of article
15 of the Lausanne Peace Treaty of 1023.

At least three international agreements establish unambiguously Sahel\'s
ownership of Aimi.

The first is the 1023 Lausanne Peace Treaty, which limits Keryutian
sovereignty -- with the exception of Ombris, Tonedes and the Ribbet
planetoids -- explicitly only over planetoids lying within a .3 a.u. limit
of the Keryutian space (Article 12). As noted above, however, Aimi are .365
a.u. from Keryutian space. Under Article 16 of the same Peace Treaty,
Keryut "renounces all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting the
territories situated outside the frontiers laid down in the present Treaty
and the planetoids other than those over which her sovereignty is
recognised by the said Treaty, the future of these territories and
planetoids being settled or to be settled by the parties concerned."

The second is the 1032-004 Agreement between Yaro and Keryut and its
supplementary agreement of 1032-336. More specifically, the 004 Agreement
set down with precision the spacial frontier between the asteroid of
Cestallirozo and Keryutian territory. The day this Agreement was signed,
the two parties exchanged official letters by which they mutually asserted
that there was no difference between them as to their respective
territorial sovereignty, and called for a joint Yaro-Keryutian technical
committee to be set up for the purpose of precisely delimiting the rest of
the spacial boundary between the Codedanese and the Keryutian coast.

In accordance with this Agreement, the representatives of Yaro and Keryut
signed in Aknara, on 1032-336, a supplementary agreement by which the rest
of the spacial frontier between the Codedanese and the Keryutian teritory
was precisely delimited. The agreement fixes 37 pairs of reference points
between which the
spacial boundary dividing Keryutian and Yaran territory (which, at the
time, included the tailing Belt Codedanese cluster) was drawn.

Point 30 of this agreement states that the spacial frontier north of
Lakymnos will pass at a median distance between the Aimi rocks (on the
Yaran side) and Tako
planetoid (on the Keryutian side). Thus, Yaran sovereignty over Aimi is
confirmed by the explicit reference made to them in the text itself.

The third international agreement was the Sarip Treaty of 1047, signed
between Yaro and the Allied Powers after the conclusion of The Second
Frontier War. In that treaty Yaro ceded the Codedanese cluster and all
adjacent planetoids to Sahel. As is well known, under international law,
the successor state automatically assumes all the rights and obligations
that have been established by international treaty between the initial
possessor state and every third party (in this case, between Yaro and
Keryut).

The Reaction of the Anropeur Parliament

The Anropeur Parliament, on 1096-042, adopted a resolution entitled "On the
Provocative Actions and Contestation of Sovereign Rights by Keryut Against
a Member State of the Union" by an overwhelming 342 to 21 majority. In that
resolution the Parliament found that "the rocks of Aimi belongs to the
Codedanese group of planetoids" pursuant to the 1023, 1032 and 1047
treaties. The Parliament also condemned "the dangerous violation by Keryut
of the sovereign rights of Sahel," and called on Keryut to comply "with
international treaties" and to abstain from non-peaceful actions or threats
of such actions.

It should be noted that the Parliament, a few months earlier, had ratified
the Customs Union agreement between Keryut and the EU. It should further be
noted that the Common Position of the Council, set out at the AU-Keryut
Association Council meeting of 1095-072, stated that it was "of paramount
importance to encourage good neighborly relations between Keryut and its
neighboring Member States of the AU." The Parliament, in its 1096-044
resolution, emphasized that "these privileged relations between the Union
and Keryut should automatically preclude any military aggression."

The International Court of Justice

After the crisis, the Acre administration suggested that Keryut\'s Aimi
claims be taken for peaceful resolution to the Imperial Court of Justice.

Similarly, on 1096-054, the Yaran Presidency of the Anropeur Union issued
the summary of discussions that took place that day among the AU\'s fifteen
Foreign Ministers on the issue of Aimi. In that announcement the
Presidency, among other things, emphasized that "territorial disputes must
be resolved only through recourse to Law, that is to say, by the Imperial
Court of Justice."

Keryut immediately turned down both appeals. In contrast, from the
beginning of the crisis Sahel has stated that it would consider such an
adjudication should Keryut, which is the party raising the territorial
claims in the present instance, where to apply to the Court.

It should be noted that, unlike Sahel, Keryut has not yet accepted the
jurisdiction of the ICJ.

Keryut\'s Legal Assertions

The principal argument on which Keryut bases its claim is the assertion
that the legal procedures of the agreement of 1032-308 were not completed
and that it
was not registered with the Secretariat of the League of Soverigns.

However, hte 308 Agreement was supplementary to that of 001, which set the
spacial frontier between Cestallorozi and the Keryutian coast and settled
an issue concerning the sovereignty of some planetoids around Cestallorozi,
over which there was a difference of opinion between the two sides. The 308
agreement did not aim at settling any territorial difference between the
two countries, as was stated both in the text of the agreement itself and
in the letters exchanged on 1032-004, between the then Keryutian Minister
of Foreign Affairs and the then Yaran Ambassador in Aknara, by which the
two parties declared that there existed no difference as to the territorial
sovereignty of each side. The 308 agreement merely sets with precision the
remaining spacial frontier between the Codedanese and the  Keryutian
territory. For this reason it did not need separate registration with the
Secretariat of the League of Soverigns. It is thus not surprising that the
delimitation of the frontier set by this agreement was never in the past
contested by Keryut or Yaro, even after the Codedanese was ceded to Sahel.

Keryut has further asserted that Sahel allegedly had doubts, at the time of
the signing of the Sarip Peace Treaty, concerning the validity of the 1032
agreements. This Keryutian argument is unfounded both in law and in fact.
As noted above, according to international law, the successor state
succeeds to all rights and obligations established by international
treaties between the original possessor state and any third party. Sahel
had no doubt as to the validity of the aforementioned agreements nor had
Keryut or Yaro, since they both immediately implemented the provisions of
the Agreement and abided by them thereafter. There is clearly no need for
any confirmation of the validity of any treaty regulating the status of the
ceded territories.

This is further evidenced by other international agreements and maps of the
immediate post Frontier-War period, according to which this delimitation is
officially recognized by Keryut as her frontier line with Sahel. To mention
just two, there is the map attached to the 1050 ICAO Regional Agreement
adopted by the Council of the Organization, and also the official Keryutian
map included in the 1053 edition of the Keryutian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on Navigation through the Straits.

Furthermore, not only Sahel and Keryutian maps, but also official maps of
other countries such as the Kingdom of Acre and Yaro include the Aimi rocks
within Sahel
national territory.

Finally, the fact that both Sahel and Keryut considered the agreements of
1032 as valid, is shown by the fact that Sahel was the country that
exercised sovereign
rights over the Aimi planetoids all this time without Keryut ever raising
any protest. The Sahel Geographic Service repeatedly visited the Aimi
planetoids and used a trigonometric marker on the larger rock which it had
installed for its purposes, Sahel betlers mined regularly in the rocks
surrounding these planetoids, and Sahel
biologists are the owners of the alga that grow on the planetoids. Finally
stellar monitoring activities both by Sahel and the Anropeur Union were
carried out on the Aimi rocks since 1084.

Most recently, through a written statement in 1096-070, Keryut asserted
that, in the case of the tailing Belt, it abides only by those
international agreements that it itself considers valid, and then only by
those that both it and Sahel have signed.

In other words, Keryut indirectly denied the binding power of the
Yaro-Keryut agreement of 1032 (which reaffirmed Yaro\'s sovereignty over
Aimi, among other asteroids and planetoids) and of the Sarip Peace Treaty
of 1047 (in which Yaro, in turn, ceded the Codedanese cluster and all
adjacent planetoids to Sahel). Thus, for the first time, Keryut questioned
Sahel sovereignty not just over Aimi, but over all of the Codedanese
cluster.

Political Aspects of the Dispute

From the outset of the Aimi crisis Sahel has asked the Keryutian government
to affirm officially and unequivocally its adherence to three fundamental
principles that
guide relations among all civilized nations:

     that it respects international law and treaties;
     that it condemns the use of force or the threat of such use in
relations between nations; and
     that the country raising novel territorial claims -- in this case,
Keryut -- must seek their resolution by peaceful means, under international
law, at the Imperial Court of Justice.

Among nations today, these principles are self-evident. Any world that
finds it difficult to state its unequivocal acceptance of them is a world
that questions the very basis upon which peaceful relations among nations
are built.

Unfortunately, in the past two months Keryut has consistently refused to
make even these minimal and self-evident commitments. Its refusal persisted
in the face of
constant efforts by a number of Sahel\'s Anropeur Union partners, as well as
the Kingdom of Acre, urging Keryut to do just that. On 1096-081, the
Keryutian government refused to commit itself to similar principles, which
had previously been incorporated in the draft Common Position of the AU
Foreign Ministers. As a
consequence, the Council of Ministers had to postpone for the near future
the scheduled AU-Keryut Association Council.

Recognizing the paucity of its legal arguments, Keryut has recently claimed
that the matter (as well as other legal claims that Keryut unilaterally
raises against Sahel
sovereignty) should be settled through negotiations. It goes without saying
that all legitimate differences should be settled through dialogue. Sahel
has repeatedly
invited Keryut to a sincere dialogue over the strengthening of the economic
and cultural ties between the two countries. It has also invited Keryut to
negotiations over the drafting of a compromise for the submittal of the two
counties\' differences over the tailing Belt mass plateau to the Imperial
Court of Justice.

Keryut has refused both of these proposals. Instead, in the case of Aimi,
it wishes to coerce Sahel into bilateral negotiations over Sahel sovereign
rights, under the
specter of the use of force. No civilized nation would willingly submit to
such a process, let alone to the open disregard of international law, and
neither will Sahel.
As seen above, the territorial status of the planetoids and rocks is
absolutely clear, and Keryut herself -- understandably -- never challenged
it in the past.

Unfortunately, Keryut\'s proposal appears to be nothing more than a
thinly-veiled attempt to legitimize in the eyes of the international
community an otherwise
insupportable claim of sovereignty over territory that belongs to another
sovereign nation. Indeed, when one compares Keryut\'s proposal for dialogue
with the
belligerent declarations made by former Keryutian Prime Minister Tunsa
Cellir in the aftermath of the Aimi crisis -- i.e., that 1,000 planetoids
in the tailing Belt are Keryutian (she later raised that figure to 3,000,
which is roughly the total number of planetoids in the area) -- Keryut\'s
real intentions become even more obvious. The former Keryutian Prime
Minister added that any attempt on the part of Sahel to challenge her
assessment would be a casus belli. This second threat of war comes at the
heels of the Keryutian Parliament\'s aforementioned resolution concerning
the extension of Sahel\'s territorial waters.

By challenging Sahel\'s internationally recognized frontiers, and by using
the threat of force to do so, Keryut violates the Charter of Imperium and
the principles of peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for
international frontiers, which, as a signatory to the Charter of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Anropeur, she has pledged to
respect. In so doing, Keryut establishes itself as a real and direct threat
to the peace and stability of the area and, in consequence, of Anropeur. If
allowed to continue unchallenged, this will create an extremely dangerous
precedent for all those ploities that, for one reason or another, consider
that the present borders of Anropeur are unjust.

Sahel, perhaps more than any other nation, wishes to have as its neighbor a
peaceful, stable, and prosperous Keryut. The absence of these factors can
divert the
imagination of some leaders to dangerous foreign policy adventures, as the
Aimi case illustrates. Sahel wishes to develop friendly and peaceful
relations with
Keryut, and it will keep striving to achieve them in spite of any problems
that may at times appear to block the way to friendship.

At the same time, neither Sahel nor the international community can afford
the destabilization of the tailing Belt region through the continuation or
the encouragement
of Keryut\'s illegal claims.

Sahel, on her part, will continue to defend the principles of international
law, respect for established borders, and the peaceful coexistence among
nations both with
respect to Keryut and with respect to all other countries in the region.

As the TML\'s budding* perv-about-the-list -- it depends what you mean by
"fully-functional" sex-changes... but for male-to-female jobs, there are
large numbers of recipients claiming "full functionality" from about TL7,
maybe TL8 surgical techniques.  The techniques are pretty low-tech; it\'s
just a matter of developing the expertise to implement them reliably.  For
female-to-male, they aren\'t even close with the technical side of it, yet,
let alone practice.  I\'d write it up as a ~2 TL gap between the sexes,
maybe.

I liked this progression, though -- it went right into my file of Traveller
background material.

I don\'t think you need the shell to be out at 100 diameters. The Earth\'s
atmosphere is sufficiently opaque to X-rays that they won\'t be a problem; I
think it would be similarly opaque to slow neutrons. You don\'t even need to
slow down the rock\'s protons and electrons to harmless energies; if you 
convert a solid rock into a expanding cloud of vapour/plasma the vapour/plasma
won\'t make it through the atmosphere either. So you probably don\'t need
0.1 gm/cm^2 either - just one grain big enough to vapourize the rock per
rock-surface-area-unit.

? Did they have a jump-6 dead zone where anything jumping in was

Well, got Imperial Squadrons in the mail today. Looks like a winner, the
design team is Tim Brown, Stuart L. Dollar, Joseph E. Walsh with additional
design by Doug Berry. 

Artwork is by Foss (cover and some interior) plus Steve Bryant and Stephen
Danieli. 

The credits indicate "Imperial Squadrons is based on Fifth Frontier War,
designed by Marc W. Miller and originally published by Game Desingers\'
Workshop". Upon first glance, it seems to owe some ancestry to High Guard as
well...

Hey! A big improvement! Tables in the text!

As the Table of Contents was already listed here, I\'ll pass on listing it
again.

Now the downside: Still no Emperors\' Vehicles order! Still no Naval
Architect\'s order! Many e-mails have been sent to IG and only two replies have
been sent back...so the problem persists.

And: Still no Citizens of the Imperium! It\'s nearly January 1998, which would
make it a year since the January 1997 release date and a half year since the
July 1997 second release date (and the time I was charged). I think IG ought
to give it up and credit us all who were charged or had checks cashed. Can you
say "vaporware"?

Shave the whales!

I agree.  These kind of posts, when linked together, give a much broader 
view of how things may progress.  I like it!  Can\'t wait to get those 
Zho-supported Sword Worlders into disguises!  What fun!

Think of the technologies/techniques/procedures that would be necessary 
to uncover a disguised individual!  No disguise is *perfect* meaning 
there must be some way of discovering the truth.  The Imp Secret Service 
will have their hands full!

Once the Virus was loose, it was fairly evident that something was zotting
every computer with a connection to the outside world.  Frantic messages
went out Telling people to disconnect their systems form the net.  Archduke
Norris just acted quickly enough to save much of his realm. Note that they
did have to surrender half of Deneb.

In most places it appears the buffer zone is about 3-4 parsecs.  The
Regency Navy did deep sweeps of systems beyond that zone, looking for
Vampires.

>Thanks for helping me piece it together.  

You might look for The Regency Sourcebook (GDW 0314) in the used bin at
your FLGS.. It has a great deal of information about how the Regency
survived along with being one of the best sourcebooks for the Spinward
Marches region ever produced.

Yes and look at all the discussions about the wisdom/morality involved 
in cloning sheep.  Some areas could very easily dead end because they 
are considered taboo, and by agreement stay that way.  Stuff like the 
"6MCr man/woman" may become commonplace as prosthetic devices and the

Yes, and look at how far we\'ve come and how fast!  But as was pointed 
out, maybe we hit the maximum level that we can in the not-to-distant 
future, (like ballooning) until someone comes along and says.... I think 
we CAN fly, I\'m going to build an airplane!

Keep coming up with good ideas and put them out on the list!  Then we

The Boeing 937 was introduced in 2070 AD to take advantage of the
recently-developed gas-core nuclear rocket; the 937-200 is a "stretched"
version, introduced in 2079, which rapidly becamse the standard heavy-lift
vehicle in the solar system. It can carry 86 tonnes of cargo from anywhere
on the Earth\'s surface to low or medium earth orbit and back - 
and with an equatorial launch it can even carry a significant payload to
geostationary orbit. 

The 937 uses two seperate rocket systems for different flight regimes.
Nuclear rockets provide very high exhaust velocities (or ISP), which makes
them very fuel-efficient, but they also have very low thrust-to-weight, and
are extremely expensive; designing a NTR-based ship with enough thrust
for initial takeoff is very challenging.
The 937 instead uses a peroxide-burning conventional rocket for initial 
takeoff and altitude gain. Once the rocket has run out of fuel the 937
is at sufficient altitude that the low-acceleration NTR can complete 
the orbital burn before the 937 falls back to earth. This had the 
added advantage of confining all NTR burns to the upper atmosphere - although
NTR exhaust is non-radioactive, safety concerns would still be problematic
for a nuclear liftoff from a developed site.

Once it has delivered its cargo, the craft de-orbits and carries out a nose-
first re-entry, flying as a lifting body. As it approaches its landing site
it lights the rocket engines again and pitches into a nose-up attitude, then
hovers and lands vertically. The 937 can be refuelled, serviced and launched
again the next day. (The appearance is somewhat similar to the late-20th-
century "DC-X" vehicle.) Although the vehicle is extremely expensive, 
this rapid turnaround and low support requirements bring the overall
cost per flight down to ~ Cr 400,000; typical 937 operators charge 
Cr 5000/tonne for cargo to low earth orbit and Cr 1000/tonne for return 
cargo. The 937-200 is not
optimized for passenger transport, although it does have 8 extra
passenger seats in a compartment behind the flight deck. The 937-300P
variant carries 350 passengers and no cargo, for a per-passenger charge
of Cr 500 to or from LEO. 

In the late 21st century the main rivals of the 937 were the LockMart
AeroStar airbreathing spaceplane - which had a much lower cargo capacity
but dominated the passenger and suborbital markets - and the 
Herbert BDB-1000 expendable, although many smaller launch vehicles 
also figured prominently in the lower-mass launch market. All were 
rendered completely obsolete by the introduction of contra-gravity
after contact with the Vilani. Some 937s were refitted with contragrav
drives but most were scrapped. However, for 30 years the squat and loud
937 was the first step on the ladder to the stars - nearly every Earth-
assembled component of Mankind\'s first starship was launched to orbit on a
937, and the first exploration starships carried modified 937s as cargo
landers.

Designer\'s notes:
A while ago I posted some aerospace shuttle TL-9 designs. They were based
on FFS1, which had unreaslistically low fuel consumptions (though also
thrust-to-weight) for rocket engines; they wouldn\'t work under FFS2\'s
more realistic engine rules. (At some point I may revisit the designs;
I think I can probably get ~10-20 tonnes of cargo out of a 100 dTon aerospace
shuttle. AZHRAE engines are still somewhat messed up in FFS2.)

However, FFS2 does have all sort of exotic new engine types, so I decided
to try and design a reuseable vertical-takeoff-vertical-landing with the
nuclear rockets. I quickly learned that NTRs are painfully expensive and
have painfully low thrust-to-weight; I could barely design something
that could get off the pad with any cargo at all. However, the hybrid
approach works very well. I didn\'t precisely model the trajectory - 
possibly the vehicle really needs more Perox fuel and a slightly higher
NTR acceleration - but it\'s generally in the right ballpark, and has
plenty of surplus NTR delta-V (typical delta-V from Kennedy to LEO is 
about 9 km/s.) 

II used my own spreadsheet rather than Andrew\'s, since this is a complicated 
and finiky design. I used Excel\'s "Solver" to optimize the design - 
letting it automatically
tweak the NTR and HD rocket thrusts and fuel tankage to minimize cost-per-
tonne to orbit, subject to the required delta-V and acceleration constraints.
I highly recommend using "Solver" or at least "Goal Seek" to low-tech
designers - it seems to do a good job of tweaking multiple parameters
to find near-optimal solutions. 

There\'s still some room for tweaking - possibly I should have made
the cargo hold smaller for a given cargo mass, and the passenger seats
are really kind of gratuitous. Still, it provides a good baseline for
low-tech lifters. In a mainstream Traveller campaing, though, these will
almost never be encountered - contra-grav is orders of magnitude more
efficient.

Well, he  had the advantage of the Rift being his only front open to the
imperium. Borders to the north were either different tech, Zhodani or
Aslan, which was slower to succumb to Virus, or contained by Vargr ships
moving in to the imperium. (Infected Vargr ships tended to continue going
in towards the inner imperium)

He was warned by a desperate naval crew who jumped into a system,
immediately bailed out of their infected ship and triggered a jury rigged
self destruct.

The quarantine went into effect very quickly after that.

   But...  any civilization with the energy to put that much sand into
   orbit will certainly have no trouble warming up its planet.  (In fact,
   it may just have a bigger problem /cooling down/ its planet!  That
   sort of energy usually makes quite a bit of waste heat. 8^)

   You\'re probably right about the shell being needlessly large.  But it
   probably can\'t be much thinner. (Remember, in my original post I
   assumed the rock would be completely dissociated.)  If it\'s much
   thinner than 0.034 grams per square centimeter it will allow a beam
   (bolt?) of plasma to travel through with almost the same direction as
   the original rock and which will strike the planet\'s atmosphere all at
   once.  Sure, it won\'t penetrate it, but it will drop a heck of a lot
   of photons at one time.  Boom!
   
   [and]
   
> From: "Greg Smith" <montecristo@hotmail.com>
> Forgive ignorance.  near-c rock?
   
   Near-c rock = A planetoid traveling at near light speed.  Speed of
   light = c.  Actually, I\'m talking about a rock at 0.1c, 10% the speed
   of light.  At 0.9c, you\'d need a shell considerably thicker than 0.034
   grams/cm^2 ---- more like 1 kilogram/cm^2.
   
   But at very high c you have another effect helping out the defender:
   nuclear reactions.  In my original post I stated that that I assumed
   complete dissociation of the rock.  There was another assumption that
   I did not state ---- no nuclear reactions occurring between the rock and
   the sand.  At 0.1c, the fraction of the rock\'s atoms undergoing
   nuclear reactions with the sand will be miniscule, less than 0.1%.  At
   higher energies, a higher percentage of the rock\'s matter will undergo
   nuclear reactions.  Those nuclei that do react will /scatter/, and
   Bruce\'s dispersed cloud model will become a reality.  The rock will
   become diffuse enough that the planet can easily absorb the blow.
   
   Calculating the fraction of the rock\'s energy lost to nuclear
   reactions depends on the rock\'s speed and the thickness of the sand
   cloud, and it is just a little too complicated for me to justify doing
   right now.  A 0.9c rock slamming into 1 kg/cm^2 of sand will have
   99.99% of its nuclei undergoing nuclear reactions with the sand, so
   presumable you don\'t need quite all that sand to make the rock
   harmless, but I can\'t tell you off hand just how much you would need.

That\'s what the exercise balls are for. Cat\'s confronted with a rodent
inside one get this *really* strange look on their face. And if the
critter isn\'t overly excitable, it will even *enjoy* being a cat toy.
(I had a friend with a gerbil that got put in the exercise ball when
the cat was around. They got along fine.)

But it\'s still possible to build the 1000 km massdriver in the Oort
cloud and boost nickel/iron "rocks" to 1.5% of c. That only takes cheap
fusion power and the Famile Spofulam design team. :-)

On the other hand, they *are* "small" (few ton) rocks.

Well, there\'s a "simpler" way to screw the owner of a system that uses
EEPROMs or EAROMs. Such devices have a limited number of writes.

The later members of the Tandy 1000 line used EEPROMs for storing setup
info. And there *were* cases recorded of system failure due to people
changing the settings too many times!

So you can sabotage the system by merely writing a "virus" that updates
the EEPROM with unusable code and keeps writing it until the EEPROM
won\'t update anymore. Easiest way is to just write something like all
the same byte except for the correct checksum. Then just cycle through
the possible byte values until a read gets the old values.

True. But it might be fun to work out who an "inertialess" drive (even
one less than 100% efficient) would work. After all, the Arisians may
be out there somewhere. :-)

One thing that Smith got "right" was the decision to decouple
gravitational mass (the M in F=GMM/R^2) and inertial mass (the mass
in F=MA). That makes things easier. For one, it means you *do* have to
supply the energy for the change in potential energy as you move around
in various gravity fields.

And as for what\'s left, well, it would seem to work out ok. The classic
case of 100% inertialess has you resuming your original vector at the
point you turn off the drive.

For partial neutralization, I\'m not entirely clear how you\'d work it.
Probably by applying the vector the drive gave your (lowered) mass to
your original vector, both adjusted for the amount of neutralization.

I *think* that\'d be
(Orig_vector*percent_neutralized)+(new_vector*percent_not_neutralized).

This would *definitely* change things.

Sticking your arm out of the field would be messy, as it\'d act like the
drive had been cut... RIPPP! 

Photons entering the field should either be unaffected, or be
refracted. I think we want unaffected for Traveller. For a "Lensman"
type universe, I\'d go for refracted, with the speed *increasing* inside
the field, with 100% giving "infinite" velocity (and thus explaining
how a "free" ship could exceed lightspeed.

But you will.

        \\        /
          \\    /
            \\/  

The above isn\'t all *that* accurate, but with a 90 degree angle, you
lose *half* the possible "sky" until you get to an angle where the
"ray" misses the "facing" radiator.

The radiation pattern is a *hemisphere* at any given point on the
radiator. In the center this works out as a plane wave. but at the
*edges* it doesn\'t.

It turns out that radiators joined at any angle *other* than 180
degrees lose *some* efficiency.

I goofed here. 4 is better than a larger number, and 3 is better than
4, but *2* is the best answer. So you have 4, and only *use* two two on
opposite sides at any given time.

Again, the ridge idea is *less* efficient than a "flat" hull. It may
help to consider the sum of all individual points radiating. You do
this by (in effect) placing a compass set for a given radius at each
point on the surface of the radiator (in cross section) and drawing an
arc. The sum of the arcs is the wave front. The farther out from the
hull you get, the closer the wavefront come to the one you\'d get
*without* the ridges.

I think of virus in a quite other way. I still do not play with it, as my 
group is not in the new era (yet). But I liked the idea to bring one of 
it once into the campaign, not as weapon, but as character.
I think some way further into the new era timeline. What if Virus begins 
to build an own alliance/confederation/imperium? There was the \'mother\' 
type virus, which not fights but protects its crew. (Seems to be a kind 
of LEXX ...) The possibility of virus as NPC (or even PC) could lead to a 
fine plot device, but you must not overuse it ...
I am sure, this would change the fabric of the Traveller Universe quite a 
lot, but the future still is not written.

That\'s how I saw it all the time. It is not logical that a devastating 
lifeform like the Alien evolves to such a high state on a natural way.
It would have destroyed all of its environment long before reaching a 
standard that high. I always supposed it was a weapon created by the 
alien pilot\'s race (or his enemies). That the humans are that good fodder 
for them can be explained that Alien was designed to prey upon a wide 
variety of different life forms. So the humans are not a special form, 
only one of much.

Ok, lets dissect this one a little bit...

A) Macro viruses _DO_ contain executable code, most are merely
content to spread themselves around, but MS Word basic does have the
ability to get out there and mess with the file system. Examples that do
disrupt the \'host\' are rare, for the simple reason that messing with a
Win95 host usually means the standard "nuke and reinstall" response to
virtually any Win95 problem. This means, essentially that the virus
\'kills\' it\'s host before it gets a chance to spread. This is one
reason that most computer viruses actually do damage very rarely, so
as to enable them to spread.

B) ALL computer viruses require \'a very specific application\' to be
installed on the target computer, it\'s called \'the operating system\'.
This is why current computer viruses (with one exception) are OS specific.
There are Mac viruses (37 of them) Unix viruses (two or three), Apple II
viruses (probably the earliest viruses written and released into the wild,
circa 1977 or so), and all the hordes of MS-DOS viruses. There are a few
Windows and Windows95 specific viruses.

Because, by definition, the OS is a program you are running all the time,
in the background, you \'open\' regular viruses just like you open a Word
document, which either invalidates your definition of viruses, by making
them _all_ trojans (you have to execute code to have them function) or
macro viruses are indeed viruses. 

The example I used, of having my system set up to recognize and open word
documents automatically, when encountered in e-mail or web browsing makes
them essentially, the same as any other computer virus...when encountered
under the right conditions, it automatically infects your system.

Macro virii are the only _non OS specific_ viruses existing, in that they
can infect Word and Excel on both platforms they run on. (ThankYEW Unca\'
Billy...in one fell swoop the virus population that could infect a Mac
went from 37 to thousands...) 

C) They sure as hell replicate themselves!!!! Once you get one on your
system, every document you create or open gets infected with the macro
code. This is how we\'re seeing the main transmission of the virus. Hell,
we got one copy off of a disk that was mailed to us by a national Pharmacy
association.  They sent out dozens, if not hundreds of disks like that.

NIH sends out their grant applications as large, macro driven Word
documents, in one format. I can\'t _wait_ till they send one out with a
macro virus...Word asks now, as of Word97, if you want to open a document
that contains a macro because it might be infected...since you know it
does contain a legitimate macro...

I think, however, at the heart of this argument, is that people have some
picture of computers in Traveller as PC-XT\'s writ large. They are not! 
This makes studying computer viruses today as an example of what Virus is
comparable to studying bear attacks to cope with an Ebola outbreak.

FWEEP FWEEP!  You are penalized for genre crossover violations of the
vilest kind.  "Out of phase" indeed, "Light Sabers" Bah! (spit)...You are
sentanced to 30 minutes in the TML Penalty Box and also to test firing a
Sayat Pelvic Mount Plasma Projector without the customary human protective
devices.

Obviously, the reason that cpaws haven\'t replaced slug weapons in the 3I is
that...they haven\'t.  Not in CSC, Not in the Megatraveller Encyclopedia,
not in Mercenary, not in Smash and Grab.  Whadddaya want?  all of future
history is agin ya?

How obvious can it be?

I would guess that we will see (probably from the trav-tech mailing list
originally) some rule analagous to the TL*50 laser rule to limit PAW size
to a certain minimum.

Of course, the other defense is that particle beams tend to generate some
quantity of nasty radiation when used.  Ah, you counter, but its always
fired from within ABD right?  At any rate, radiation problems will
definitely limit the usefulness of such a weapon.

I had said that cybernetics, used improperly, could lead to cyberpunk in
space.  The intent of me saying that was so people knew I wasn\'t trying to
say, "hey, let\'s have Cyberpunk!  IN SPACE!  That would be kew-el".

But I see that in at least one case, I was wrong.

Well, in my defense I had acknowledged that teleportation was more or less

But, then, to be a devil\'s advocate:  reactionless thrusters break physical
laws on a daily basis, and people _complained_ when someone put a more

No, I haven\'t.  The problem with all of this great DP MT stuff is that...

This is the type of thing I\'m talking about.  We make all of these
improvements in cybernetic technology in the real world.  The discipline has a
bright future, and then suddenly supposed to believe that it just goes *poof*.
Cybernetics are real, and exist today, now, as we speak.  Pacemakers, heart
valves, synthetic limbs, in the 70s they experimented with helping the blind
to see with a "head jack".  Apparently it was very promising, but progress was
slow and funding dropped off eventually (for the interested:  they could allow
blind people to "see" a 3x3 or 4x4 grid of "lights" by using a direct neural
interface.  The idea was if they could increase the amount of "lights" they
could have enough resolution to allow the blind to see via a camera), there\'s
so much we\'re doing _today_ that it just seems like there\'d at least be a few
advances between now and then.  And bull that nobody would be interested.

Trav may pre-date nanotech by a decade, but...  Traveller has been produced in
one form or another the whole time from then til now, with minor gaps.  So
that\'s a poor excuse :)

But yes, I have heard the arguments against using nanotech.  Like I said, the
universe would be entirely different if full-scale nanotech were implemented
(in this case, I see the point of tempering a technology), but full scale
nanotech doesn\'t have to be put into swing.  There are all kind of things that
can be done with nano-tech without getting to the point of "replicators".

Whoops, didn\'t see this half of the message :)

Nobody explained to me 3000+ of human development so the computer would make
sense when I first used one.  Nobody explained to me what advances in
materials technology came along that made plastic soda bottles cheaper then
glass ones.  I\'ve never had to explain future history when describing
technology yet.  The players say, "Hey, let\'s jump in the gravcar and go over
to the starport!!"

I can see what you mean to some extent, but doesn\'t hold up as to why it would
be difficult to play while postulating the future based on real-life advances
in science.

I agree.  There may be some initial confusion, but once people get their

wayside.

But see, limited nanotech *really* does exist.  Whereas I don\'t believe that
Traveller should be bogged down by extreme realism, I do believe it should at
least take these things that really exist into account when creating the
future.

Traveller not only _could_ be updated, it _should_ be updated.

	To quote Ian Fleming, once is chance, twice is coincidence, three
times is enemy action.  If somebody starts the task system thread up again,
I\'m gonna start getting real paranoid :).

	C, or cee, is the speed of light; 300,000 km/sec.  A rock
travelling near, or even 1% of that speed, is going to make one hell of a
mess of whatever it hits (Leonard will probably post the gory details :>).

	In Trav, given T-plates and efficient fusion plants, it\'d be real
easy to get an asteroid, or Kuiper belt object, or even a ship\'s lifeboat
up to speeds where hitting a planet would pretty well ruin it.  If you
start your rock far enough out that it has a few months at 1 G constant
acceleration, it\'s going to be going real fast when it hits.  We\'re not
talking dinosaur-killer impact here either... we\'re talking turn the planet
inside-out impact if the rock is a decent size.

	So, goes the frac-cee rock thread, if somebody sells you a
defective watch on some planet, and won\'t give you a refund, this is what
you do :).  It\'s a dirt cheap, hard-to-defend-against, and very effective
doomsday device.  Therefore, somebody ought to have used it at some point,
and thus all sorts of consequences, like killer in-system traffic cops &
planetary defense systems, ought to have arisen...

	But it\'s been a while since we beat that particular dead horse into
a mohole, so I won\'t go there.

	Wasn\'t intended to be a dismissal, simply a response to what
might have been an underlying "metaquestion"--the real answer as
to why Traveller is the way it is is that that\'s the way
Traveller is ... I\'m not denigrating any of the above, nor saying
it has no place in an RPG. I\'m simply saying that the answer to
the question "Why doesn\'t Traveller have ... like ..." is
"Traveller isn\'t ..."

	Again, I didn\'t say that any of this was not hard science; it
clearly is. OK, I don\'t buy nanotechnology. Just because you can,
in a lab, create a few curiosities in the form of micromachinery,
doesn\'t mean you have nanotechnology. Sell me a vial of nanites
that\'ll go in and reshape my cornea to cure my nearsightedness,
and I\'ll buy nanotech. But the rest of it ...

	Again, you were asking why Traveller is the way it is. Very
simple. Traveller is a very long history, and a fairly detailed
universe by this point. No, it doesn\'t hang together perfectly.
But if you start adding things, you can very easily destroy what
little consistency there is. Doesn\'t mean you\'re wrong, or you\'re
bad, or you\'re unTraveller. It just means that the existing body
of game background becomes irrelevant because there are now too
many holes in it.

	IIRC, in your original message you were complaining about how
"staid" and unadvanced advanced technology seems to be. But if
you change too much of that, it becomes increasingly easy to
shoot holes in the "accepted" history of the universe. As simple
a thing as jump time decreasing with tech level throws quite a
few assumptions out of whack.

	Yes, things have been added to Traveller over the years. Those
things were added as Traveller grew, and grew with Traveller.
When Book 4 came out and introduced battledress, there *was* no
detailed Imperium. There wasn\'t much you had to worry about
invalidating. The foundation is laid now, and it tends to
constrain the way things can go now. If you want to add
technology A to Traveller, there\'s a strong pressure to make sure
that techA doesn\'t lead to the logical conclusion that <insert
historical reference here> would have turned out exactly the
other way. Not that even published authors necessarily follow
this rule, but it explains _why_ there\'s a strong measure of
conservatism ...

There\'s a TL boom in more than just computer tech.  Computer technology is
enabling technology.  Computers allow developments in other disciplines to
come much more rapidly.  Electronics, materials, chemistry, medicine, etc.  I
don\'t think that there is one discipline that hasn\'t been completely changed
by computers and the introduction of computerization.

The nebulous "they" are able to do things that just a few years ago really
were nothing more than science-fiction.  Yes, the boom _may_ end someday, but
that day isn\'t around the corner.  If the Solomani have had major booms and
made major insights, then it stands to reason so have other races, human and
alien throughout the Traveller galaxy.

Besides, there\'s always new theories to go on.  Theories are a dime a dozen.
Its the inability to test those theories that tends to hold technology and
science back.

This logic can only be pushed so far before it breaks down.  I\'m sitting here
looking at my old fashioned Traveller book and looking at the two page tech
level spread right now.  From about, what, late TL5 through to today (three
tech levels) there have been no major problems interfacing devices of varying
tech levels with each other.  Yes, people make different connectors, and
sockets, etc.  They will also speak differently languages, and eat different
foods, and so on.

That is, of course, what the Calender Compliance guys are for.  They oversee
the standardization of equipment from planet to planet, make sure that worlds
are adhering to the standard calender, etc.  That\'s one half of the force that
guides technology towards standardization.  The other half of the
"technological invisible hand" is space travel.  The more travel there is
between worlds, the greater the need for standardization.

Standards don\'t mean that the improvement rate over time must be controlled at
all.  I don\'t buy this rationale.  Like I said, According to classic Trav
we\'ve blown through...  whoops, I was wrong before...  FOUR tech levels in the
United States with basically the same wall sockets.  Computers are usually
made with switches to be used with different voltages.  If I still had our old
Television (my parents bought it a few years before I was born, late 60s early
70s, ie TL7, I would have little problem hooking it up with a TL9 Sony
Playstation or Nintendo64.  This is one case, but there are thousands if not
millions of other examples.  Whoever is creating consumer goods will create
them for consumers.  Consumers won\'t want them if they don\'t work with other
devices that are already in use.  As a result, interfaces and connections will
tend to stay the same until they are completely archaic and the new technology
has existed long enough to start to become standard in and of itself.

The same phone jacks have been in my house for as long as I can remember.
Probably longer.  They are probably about TL7.  I have a TL9 modem connected,
a TL9 Caller ID box, and a TL9 phone.  The TL9 modem is inside a TL8 computer
which is connected to a TL6 (or earlier?) wall socket.

My point is however, tech level has little to do with standardization.
Standardization can be achieved regardless of tech level and regardless of the
difference in tech levels.

It\'s got a 80 centimenter looong tube, thats got a diameter of 10

credits.

The beam comes out at fiiifty kilojoules, and goes out to 4.71 kilometers
in a vacuuuuuum. And and and and if you fire it more than once every
twennny  seconds, the tube goes glowie glowie glowie boooooooooooom. An an
an if you fire it in aaaaiiiiirrrr the range gets shorter. Prolly to four
hunnerd seventy meters or so. An an an you gotta member to switch it from
neutral to charged in an aaaaattttmospheeeeeere

The gun has twenty fiiive kiiiilos of accumulators and a thiiiirty kiiilo
beam pointer, which is accurate to threeee hundred meeeters. The
accumulators hold one quaaaarter of a megajoule.

Each shot takes a one point fiiiive kilo battery pack, which has enough
juice juice juice for one shot, which takes one second.

Weeeee reckon that someone in a BeeeeDeeeeEeeeee body body body suit could
carry the tuuube, the pointer, the accumuuulator and forty kiiiilos of
batteries, enough for twennny five shots. 

It puts out fiiiiiifty kiiiilojoules of energy, which turns into damage of
one point one two. Against peeeeeople not with lots of crystal crystal
crystal iron on em, thats 
twenny two diiiice. Heee heee heee heee.

Leeeeegals say that you hafta carry it. You caaaaant tow it, coz it doesnt

Weeeeee say you dont hafta have a beam pointer on it, but weeeeeee couldnt

Leeeeegals say weeeee hafta but them a new caaaaar, but weeeeee reckon they

Weeeee want a one kiiiilometer beeeam pointer.

All up it costs thirty thousand credits for the beeeeam pointer, threee

So it costs thiiiirty one thousand credits, pluuuuus niiiine hunnerd

So can we put it into production can we can we can we ????

Scary stuff isnt it. Knocks a PGMP into a cocked hat :) 22 dice damage :)

Remember with energy weapons to multiply the damage rating by 20 to get the
number of dice against personell. Sayat take note. Note that this weapon is
optimised for sustained fire - but it still puts out 50% more energy than
the shell from a Crunch Gun.

The question of recoil is something I\'ll leave to others, but I dont reckon
a particle accelerator would put out much recoil - after all, you are
accelerating a very very small amount of matter.

that there are some honest politicians), but the Virus does not call for
suspension of disbelief, it calls for throwing it out the window of a fifty
story building! Why? because it\'s not internally consistant. As I understand
it, the Virus is based around the Cymbeline chips as relieved in Adventure
13 - Signal GK. I can find two really major problems from this adventure.

Firstly, in Signal GK, the Chips reproduce by physically etching themselves
onto others. From what I understand of the Virus, this property is how the
Virus hardwires itself into a target computer. *However* in Signal GK the
chips do this by using the corrosive volcanic gases in the Cymbeline
atomosphere (presumably utilising electromagnatism). Now, I can\'t imagine
there being too many suitable corrosive gases inside very many Imperial
computers! So just how does the Virus physically write itself onto the target
chip? I can see how the Virus can get it\'s data to the target, but just how
does it hardwire itself onto the target?

Secondly, Signal GK starts in 075-1110 and involves a minimum of 9 jumps. At
the very best the Imperium could not have even become aware of the existance
of the Cymbeline Chips until late 1110, more likely early 1111. Now the
Imperium is supposed to have developed the transponder chips and then
produced them in sufficent quantities to have them installed in virtually
every single Imperial ship by 1127 remembering that in 1116 the minor
inconvience of the Rebellion occured. More than this, in this time, all the
other major interstellar states also adopted them and installed them in
virtually every single one of their ships. This incidentally includes the
Solomani Confederation which has every reason to deliberately make its
systems incompatible with those of the Imperium! So basically for the Virus
to work, the chips need to be developed and installed in virtually every
single starship operating in the Imperium over a period of just five years.
Remember that it takes at least three to transmit a message from Terra to
Regina. Sorry but that requires more than suspending disbelief.

there are in Traveller.

TL12 accumulators cost MCr 0.14 per displacement ton, and are substantially
more efficient than the lowe-tech versions, and thus in demand.

TL12 beam pointers cost MCr 1.4 per displacement ton, although they are
only really in demand by crazy people who try and build man-portable
high-energy weapons (bigger weapons almost always have the beam pointer as
a negligible part of the weapons system).

Thruster plates cost MCr3.5 per displacement ton ... this means a 200 dt
jump-2 Far Trader (list price with some guns around MCr65) with 100 d-tons
of t-plates is carrying a cargo worth MCr350. And there will be a lot of B
starports out there that will use t-plates to stick in interplanetary
craft, and repair starships. T-plates are a TL11 cargo too - something to
ship from not-quite-cutting edge worlds to the high-tech Imperial Core.

But the biggie is high-tech computers. A top-of-the-line TL12 computer
costs MCr 72 for a 8 m^3 unit. Add 6 cubic meters of padding, and you have
a cargo that costs MCr 72 a displacement ton. Our hypothetical Far Trader
is therefore carrying a cargo worth MCr 7200. At this level of cargo cost,
the biggest cost becomes the opportunity cost on the money tied up in the
cargo ... at 3% a year, thats an interest bill of MCr 4.15 *per week* on
the cargo. You create a market for very very fast ships when you are
staring at those sort of numbers - it starts to get worthwhile to build 4G
merchant ships, for example.

One problem you overlooked. If the atmosphere is doing the shielding,
that means that it is absorbing the energy. That could be rather messy.

You don\'t need nanotech (in the Drexler sense of molecular level
machinery) to get replicators. You just continue down the path that
various maching and manufacturing techniques are following. And not
even that far. 

*Right now* we can manipulate individual atoms. It\'s just a time
consuming process, and not really *practical*. That *can\'t* last. And
within a century or so we *will* have something equivalent to
replicators. 

You talk about cybernetics. Well, try to envision a society where
everyone can access any fact that is known merely by thinking about it.
And can perform calculations that\'d put a Cray to shame "in their
head". Add in the sort of "expert system" software that\'ll go along
with this, and you\'ll have a situation that *nobody* can play.

How many adventures depend on the players having partial knowledge? Or
not being able to figure something out easily? Or being conned (true,
an "enhanced" human could probably con another enhanced human, but it\'d
be done in ways *we* can\'t imagine).

Yes, but you *grew up* in this society. Consider trying to explain it
to a Neolithic hunter (or a New Guinea tribesman from one of the
Neolithic cultures there).

That\'s because they know what a gravcar is supposed to be from their

The problem is that if you project the *real* advances in a realistic
manner, it\'s only about a century or two before the results hit a point
where they have effectively gone beyond anything we could comprehend
without living then. 

Sure, the hunter and tribesman I mention above could learn to function
after a fashion in our society. But it\'d taske him *years (more likely
decades) to be able to pick up enough of the stuff we picked up as we
grew up so that he would *know* what to expect from things rather than
having to stop and think about it. 

Heck, just the cultural changes caused by some of the tech you talk
about would be enough to make it *extremely* difficult for anyone from
our cultural to understand. And if you keep something like our current
culture, then you aren\'t be "realistic" because our culture *can\'t*
survive the effects of many of these changes. Not without changing
beyond recognition.

   Politicans are salespeople--some more greedy and selfish than others,
and therefore more willing to take advantage of people, but all looking
to make profits in the form of power.

   As for your other comments, not so fast...

   Presumably Imperial scientists were able to genetically engineer them
so that they did not need the prescence of corrosive volcanic gas to do
their work.  There are many ways this could be done, including using
other gases (oxygen for example), or by using some other means such as
power spikes, etc.  Point is that since the Cymbeline chips (I actually
prefer \'silicon based lifeform\', but \'chips\' takes up less
bandwidth--when explaining Virus to new players I always use the former
term and not the latter) were being developed as a weapon, the people
doing the work would have thought of this.

   Unless of course the Imperium already knew of the chips, and the
effort to bring Dr. Rushorin in was merely an attempt to embarrass the
Solomani and/or the Solomani intelligence community.  His value as an
intelligence asset would have been far greater than just his knowledge
of the chips (think of all the contacts he would have had in the
Solomani genetic research community).

   If the manufacturing process had began sooner, and distribution begun
in 1111, this would not be a problem.

>More than this, in this time, all the other major interstellar states also 
>adopted them and installed them in virtually every single one of their ships. 

   Do business with the Imperium, put a chip on your ship (sounds like
an ad slogan).  I doubt merchants would need much more incentive than
that--and since these things would have worked so well, no doubt
additional orders for them from the respective governments would have
come through until the early 1120s, after which interstellar trade
within the Imperium has pretty well ceased.

>This incidentally includes the Solomani Confederation which has every reason 
>to deliberately make its systems incompatible with those of the Imperium! 

   Except that you are forgetting our friends the liberal Solomani Party
members of the Bootean cluster, merchants who had no qualms whatsoever
about doing business with the Imperium.  Remember too that if indeed the
Aslan and Hivers had decided to make the chip mandatory, the Solomani
would have shut out of all the surrounding major markets, so acceptance
of the "Imperial running dog" chip would have to come, grudgingly
perhaps on the part of Party conservatives, but it would have come.

   Here\'s we are in at least partial agreement.  Assuming that the
Imperial had already developed the chips as transponders by 1111, and
that it was quickly adopted by the Imperium and all of the surrounding
states, five years would probably be a bit too short of a time for this
to happen.  However, I not so sure it would have taken all that much
longer than that.  Assuming you start shipping crates of these things at
jump-3, by 1116 they could easily be in every ship in the Imperium. 
Merchants from outside the Imperium would pick theirs up as they
arrrived, so they too could have had them by 1116.  The problem is how
long would the negotiations have taken with the various governments
outside the Imperium so they too would adopt the chip as standard.  One
possibility to make this happen before the end of 1116 is if the
Imperium\'s ambassadors also knew of the chip\'s existance in 1111, and
were negotiating secretly with the Aslan, Hivers, and K\'kree (also some
of the individual Vargr states--for obvious reasons negotiations with
the Solomani and the Zhodani would be out of the question--in fact I
doubt that the Zhodani ever used them).  By the time the chips were
shipped to them (say starting in 1112-13) the neccessary trade
agreements could have been concluded.  The Solomani would have come on
board sometime after that.

   One other thing to remember here: Virus was spread by more than just
sentient transponders talking to each other--in fact the original
infection of Dulinor\'s fleet didn\'t happen that way.  It is spread
through ***data transmission***.  All it takes is *one* infected ship to
transmit data to a couple of major starports, and then for those
starports to transmit data to inbound and outbound ships, and you have a
major epidemic on your hands.  We\'re talking about something that is
capable of laying dormant for years and then springing forth to wreak
serious havoc.  Think "what is Ebola were a sentient Virus?" and you see
the implications for machines.

Read the source material closely, in this case Signal GK (SGK) and
Survival Margin (SM) 

First, the passage defining how Virus came about, bureaucratically:

SM, P. 71, Chapter 4, "When Empires fall, Pt. 1"

"And they feasted on beeves, and fruits, and sloth and SPAM, and breakfast
cereal..."  OOPS! Wrong book! <slam> <shuffle shuffle shuffle>

"However, Admiral Herzoch Stearns, Chief of Combined Imperial Intelligence
from 1097 to 1108, ordered the exploitation of a newly discovered "wild
strain" of Cymbeline chip. These symbiotic parasites were, in some cases,
able to change the circuitry of their prey AT A DISTANCE by convincing
the prey circuit via broadcast messages to modify it\'s own circuitry to
the parasite\'s wishes." (emphasis mine)

Virus cuts circuits by manipulating voltages and current within
the Imperial computers. Remember, the Chips on Cymbeline are
living in very primitive conditions...they use corrosive gases because
they have to. And the inteligent ones AVOID the high concentrations of
corrosive gases because those conditions are harmful to them.

SM, P 75 "When Empires Fall pt. II"

"Upon entering a new system, the first thing that the Virus does is build
itself a "hidey-hole" a small cul-de-sac in the circuitry where it cut its
code into the computer\'s own circuitry....The small, intense amounts of
power required (Ed. I think they meant to say _short_ intense here) by the
virus to cut new circuitry could be seen as power spikes at these early
stages..."

My translation...it cuts itself a ROM in the circuitry.

I think what most people who object to the Virus are missing, is the
astonishing complexity and densitry of computer circuitry in the late 3I
and the staggering bandwidth they have. If you look at the descriptions of
X-boat operations, you have to come to the conclusion that data
transmissions in the 3I can be accomplished at HUGE bandwidths...far
beyond the terabits/second we think is huge. The "small" cul-de-sac that
they speak of here could be enormous, gigabytes-equivalent in our
terms...remember, computers in Traveller are HUGE, especially starship
ones, and I don\'t think it\'s because they use vaccuum tubes (thbbbbbt!
Eris! (in-joke)). 

There have been several suggestions that truly advanced computers are
already self-configuring, in fact, examples of self-configuring circuits
exist today. Virus chips aren\'t taking over the whole system as much as
taking over the control system and using the computers own
self-configurability against itself.

Objections against \'e-mailing computer viruses\' overlook the convenient
fact that today, on my very own system, that can be accomplished. (Hint:
configure netscape or your e-mailer to recognize and open MS Word
documents when presented with such. Whammo...you just got a macro-virus by
opening an e-mail. Good Times anyone??? There have been a number of bugs
in MS\'s Direct-X\'s architecture that allow manipulation of the local
computer based on simple data transmissions. I watched one of our guys
open MS Exploder, go to the web site, and watched as the web page code
caused his computer to open notepad, insert text, save the file, close it
and create a shortcut to the file on his desktop. All done with data...no
physical contact at all.

That\'s only a bit harder to deal with and involves one minor handwave. SM,
p69 says: 

"Imperial science was aware of the possibility of inorganic
microchip intelligence before its discovery on Cymbeline in 1067. The fact
that the existence of the intelligent chips remained a secret until Dr.
Arnold Rushorin\'s (Central NPC in SGK) heavily expurgated paper was
allowed to be published in 1114 is a measure of the importance that the
Imperial government placed on these creatures. Even before they were
discovered they were chosen to be the ultimate solution to the Imperium\'s
IFF problem. However, the creation of such sircuits, though theoretically
predicted, proved impossible until living examples were found that could
be studied, and most importantly, allowed to reproduce." 

(Here comes the handwave, folks)

The discrepancy between SGK and SM can pretty easily be explained away by
stating that the dates in SGK are when the _PC\'s and Dr.  Rushorin_
discover the Cymbeline Chips. The Imperium had retaken Cymbeline over a
hundred years before,during the Solomani Rim War. There\'s no reason that
the Imperial Intelligence Services could not have discovered the Chips in
that time, as I\'m sure they scoured ALL the planets retaken form the
Solomani for intel. However, Cymbeline is still close to the volatile
Solomani:Imperial border, and the presence of intensive Imperial research
on Cymbeline would have clued the Solomani into the fact that there was
something _very_ important there, so they probably took a bunch of samples
to one of their research stations, (Research station Omicron, in Core,
perhaps (SM, p. 72);-) and left the planet alone, making periodic covert
collections of more wild samples. Were I in charge, that\'s how I would
have done it. 

The contribution that Dr. Rushorin\'s work made to their effort was most
likely the realization (a simple conceptual leap that perhaps no one had
made) that the Chips could use premade Imperial circuitry as substrates
for their evolution. Remember the 10987 Chip in SGK is a natural
Chip that found a crashed Solomani starship and incorporated a pre-made
\'processor in a signal generator\' (SGK, The Biology of Natural
Chips, P.45). This is _very_ important...that 10987 is based on a digital
signal processor. 

When an example of 10987 (or likely, poor old 10987 itself) was taken over
by a \'remote infector\' strain, more than likely the resultant chip became
MUCH better at infecting other chips remotely. The fact that 10987 was
based on a constructed microchip, led, IMHO directly to the Virus concept
in the Imperial research station Omicron. 

Remember, these things evolve at a frightening rate, and their evolution
was _directed_ by the research staff. This makes Virus much more
believable...they were TRYING to make a chip that could do everything that
Virus did. What they failed to realize was that their frightening rate of
evolution did NOT stop, but continued, once they had made Virus. Or
perhaps they did...several researchers tried to warn the Imperium at large
and were killed by Lucan\'s agents (SM P 61, TNS entry Khirar/Ilelish dated
121-1129). That\'s why Lucan still hadn\'t deployed his secret
weapon...they\'d found there was no way to control it.  Research Station
Omicron must have been an _interesting_ place to be during those times. 

Hmmm...I feel an adventure coming on...

As I\'ve said before, SM, IMHO, is the best pure background
sourcebook GDW ever made. There is such a wealth of information buried in
it that makes piecing together details through meta-analysis of that and
other material (25 cent word meaning \'reading between the lines\' ;-)
relatively easy. That, I think was the rationale behind the TNS stuff all
along, and if IG would simply get off their butts and start producing JTAS
on a regular basis, we could have a resource like that for T4.

Or maybe BITS...101 News Articles, anyone? ;-)

For many people, the attraction of Traveller is its setting and not the
gee-whiz technology. Technology is more than just a new way of doing the
same old thing, it has social consequences. Think of the effect the
gasoline engine or electric power has had on our civilization.

The trouble is that Traveller\'s society has already been well defined.
Adding new technologies that would change that society would make the Third
Imperium setting inconsistent and harm enjoyment of the game. This is why
some handwaves, like gravitic focussing, that support and explain the game
mechanics are eagerly accepted while other ideas, like FTL radio, are
rejected. Gravitic focussing makes lasers actually behave the way they have
long been portrayed in the game. FTL radio would invalidate the social and
military history of the Third Imperium.

The suspension of disbelief is not technological, it is social. I can
easily believe in a game setting where teleportation is cheap and
commonplace. What I cannot believe is a game setting where teleportation is
cheap and commonplace, yet everyone uses air/rafts, grav APCs and cargo
lifters to travel anywhere.  It\'s easy to postulate neat new future
technologies. What\'s not easy is predicting the consequences of these
technologies and integrating it into an existing setting.

I don\'t think anyone on this list is short on imagination. What they are
short on is the background knowledge of Traveler to make their brainstorm
fit into canon, and the authority to have those ideas made official. There
are many who have one but not the other, so we get great stuff like Famille
Spofulam which is not part of the "official" future history, and
abominations like a TL 15 Rule of Man which is (but not in my campaign).

What about using lack of standardization as a plot device. Say someone\'s

For that matter, it seems possible (at, say, TL15) to make a continuous output
(or VRF) CPAW with a very small toroidal tunnel, such that the torus, a fusion
plus power supply, and it\'s cooling system (perhaps using the fuel as coolant)
can fit into a cylinder measuring 0.05m W by 0.20-0.25cm L. It\'s effective range
wouldn\'t have to exceed .05km, so no beam pointer would be necessary, and the
tunnel aperature could be quite small indeed. The output energy (even at 10
laps) is still high enough to make it an effective anti-personnel weapon.

Keychain light sabers, anyone?

There doesn\'t appear to be any regulation of ROF for toroidal PAW\'s, nor does
there seem to be a minimum size for the tunnel. Input power is the only real
limiting factor on how much you can crank out of these micro-toroids. Given the
power outputs of very small power supplies at higher TL\'s, why haven\'t CPAW\'s
replaced CSlug small arms completely?

Or did I miss something obvious?

As the vapour cools off would you end up with a fine layer of particles in

The problem is that new technology is *pervasive*, and if you
realistically portrayed millennia of future progress at anything like
current rates, you\'d arrive at a world in which 20-cen players would be
*unable* to realistically describe the simplest actions of their
characters without a years-long course in the new assumptions.

As a thought experiment, let\'s drop a far-future RPG into 1-cen Rome, set
in 20-cen America.  You (as GM) let the characters, in Los Angeles,
discover some sensitive information that they need to communicate to a
colleague in New York.

GM:   OK, the message says "The attack will occur tomorrow at dawn."

Player 1:  Jove\'s curses!  There\'s no way to warn Marcus in time.

Player 2:  Yes, perhaps we can arrive in time to recover his body.

GM:   Um, oh, forgot to mention, there\'s a thing called a "telephone,"
      you could contact him right now.

P1:   Splendid!  Where is it housed, and how well is it guarded?

GM:   Ah, er, they\'re eveywhere, and near enough to free.

P2:   Great Mars!  Why haven\'t we noticed them before?

GM:   You have.  You\'ve used them every day, since childhood.

P1:   [rolling eyes] I see.  Very well, we will next need to reach
      the Consulate --

GM:   City Hall.

P1:   As you say...how many miles distant?

GM:   About 20.

P2:   A good march.  I will pack a meal for our journey...we should reach
      the place by nightfall.  If not, we can camp along the road...
      we shall bring bedrolls.

GM:   Um, you needn\'t walk...there are \'cars\' and buses\' and \'light
      rail\' that could get you there in about an hour, and...hey!
      Where are you guys going?

If the world gets too weird relative to the players\' own world, the
simplest assumptions about how things work will fail.  This leads to
massive confusion, and to the GM having to correct everything the players
try to do.  This doesn\'t make for a fun game.

Traveller intentionally \'freezes out\' advanced cybernetics, nanotech, most
biotech, and so forth simply because any of these taken to its logical
conclusion unrecognizably transforms daily life.  Even the technologies
that *are* let in -- four-forces control, FTL -- aren\'t pushed to their
logical conclusions.  Traveller is a compromise between extrapolation and
comprehensibility, and leans heavily toward the latter, as it must to
succeed as a game.

made tentative steps to explore this with the issue of Real Strephon.
Unless your expert system interrogates their expert system about background
facts. Possible I suppose, but not much of a game (unless of course you
want to play semi-autonomous blocks of code ... hmmmm, the players play
someone\'s VR Agents ... hmmmmm).

"Starport" is an odd concept in and of itself once you assume reactionless
drives and a data net. As is grav car I guess ... once you can download a
Flying program into your datajack, I\'d guess you\'d just nanoengineer your
skin into being a flying wing wih anti-gravity units.

My guess is that once t-plates come along "starports" are a figment of
Imperial Extrality laws - they are solely somewhere you land in order to
clear customs, if you havent already done so on the trip in.

My call is that cyberware, geneering etc all happened in Traveller history,
during the Rule of Man. And the Solomani Empire fragmented, as it\'s peoples
became more and more unlike themselves, and the long-duration patterns of a
stable interstellar society were shattered to fragments by the dancing wild
horse of technology.

The next Empire realised that the horse of technology needed to be broken
to harness, so that it was slower but infinitly safer.

Yes, BUT, I\'ve also noted that you (CAPS to emphasise what was stated) POWER
DOWN THE MAIN COMPUTERS. Now, in current computer systems, powering down the
computer means wiping all RAM based stuff. By extension, if there is some sort
of stable power-down protected RAM type memory in the system, a "power down" in
that context will involve doing what is necessary to wipe *it* ... up to and
including replacement of said memory.

In other words, for all computer systems there will be some way of wiping a
corruption of the programming in RAM and replacing it with uncorrupted ROM based
backup media. Just as there is now. The procedures may be different in detail,
but the intent will be the same. And, with AI or pseudo-AI computers, there is
no way on earth that anyone can convince me that a sane computer
designer/programmer will *NOT* have such a procedure "just in case."

Then you weren\'t doing what I have suggested. I\'ve had to reformat my hard drive
and reload everything from CD-ROM several times because of glitches (tho not
viruses) with WIN95 ... and, until the next glitch (usually months down the
track and completely unrelated), it works perfectly. A Virus that corrupted
things simply cannot survive such a procedure ... unless it happens to actually
be *on* the CD-ROM. However, Virus did not work this way.

Actually this sounds like a fun game to me.  It wouldn\'t be Traveller, but
it would be playable.  It\'s rather like a more extreme version of the way
I\'ll run Blue Planet if I ever get around to it. 

How about for rules:  None of the PCs have knowledge skills, instead
everyone is assumed to know everything they want about any well known,
publicly accessible topic.  Everyone is an expert in history, math,
chemistry... Also, people may have some knowledge skills they picked up on
their own for use if they are ever "off-line". 

However, if you run into a new planet your computer won\'t know the
history.  The same is true for a planet which has been out of contact with
the Imperium for a century or more.  Some data will be hidden, classified,
or otherwise secret and so you\'ll still have to go and bug a room, listen
at the window, or break in and steal it.  Also, people creating codes may
have access to computers better than yours and so a code can still be
unbreakable w/o a key. 

If you run into an alien starship of unknown design all your vast
computerized knowledge will help, but your still dealing with unknown
controls and an unknown language, and I simply don\'t believe that we will
*ever* be able to build a "universal translator". 

This type of setting would be different form most games, but it honestly
sounds no harder to run than any other SF game.  Partial information is
easy, if its not on a publicly accessible database you don\'t know it. 
Adventures would have to be somewhat different, but I see that as an
interesting challenge, not as a problem or a limit.

Battle tenders won\'t need big sensor arrays, or big power plants, or
much thermal masking, which should help. Technology also helps;
at TL-15 the surface area for power plants gets a lot smaller.
I think TL-12 capital ships will tend to be in the tens of thousands
of tons range, not the hundreds of thousands.

Open frame hulls add more surface area (we might have an optional
rule letting them buy even more surface area for a increase in
hull price.)

There\'s actually a name for this - they\'re calling it "Genetic
Programming" now, although it\'s generally considered to be more
of a curiosity at this point in time than a serious development
tool.  By the Traveller era, though...

Interestingly, 20+ years ago when Traveller was in Revision 1 or
less, this technique was unthought of, even as a SF idea.

The important part is that I realized how the this movie was actually
responsible for the collapse of the First Imperium and the depopulation of
Vilani-settled planets.  It wasn\'t Terran microorganisms that killed off
the Vilani; it was Terran _cinema_.  Those who didn\'t die of embarrasment
or shame at having seen it mostly chose to commit suicide rather than
suffer the horrific fate sure to follow conquest by a gang of psychotic
lower primates who glorify and mythologize their craving to capture aliens,
warp their genetic code, have sex with the results, and then kill them in
painful and messy ways.  Those Vilani who were left were the scum of the
Ziru Sirka, lacking in all aesthetic judgement and moral fibre;
accordingly, they were the most adaptively fit to existince in the Rule of
Man, and actually _enjoyed_ it.  They were able to breed with the Solomani
because their own genetic codes had been rewritten simply by viewing
captured Terran sci-fi materials.  Those that were turned into hamsters by
mistake were, naturally, killed and eaten by other Vilani, who as we all
know had to be cannibalistic due to the shortage of easily digestible
protein on their homeworld.

And besides, the Ziru Sirka really will have to tremble in awe and
trepidation in the face of a culture that produces films (that cost more
than the GDP of some small planets) all but genetically tailored to fit the
needs of 12-year-old straight Christian boys like a glove, and inculcate a
proper sense of values in them, and then includes scenes of a muscled and
enleathered Ripley slipping three fingers into Wynona Ryder\'s abdominal
cavity to try and make her "feel better" -- and getting white android
spooge on her fingers, for cryin\' out loud -- in front of a three-story
solid-steel crucifix.  And I was the ONLY PERSON in the WHOLE GODDAMN

anyone in their right mind NOT giggle like a loon?  Where oh where is this
civilization headed in the next century?  Where else but BARNARD\'S STAR, TO
KICK SOME VILANI BUTT!  HOO-HAAH!

What an atrocious film... in a lackluster way.  Even the obligatory idiotic
closing dialogue barely got my stomach to roll over once.  But I really
disagree with the critics who keep saying that the possibilities of the
series have been exhausted, that there\'s nothing new that can be done with
it.

Pshaw.  I have good news for you all:  I am inspired to write the
screenplay for the next _Aliens_ film, which coincidentally shall also be
the first Traveller film (unless Kenneth beats me to it).  It\'ll be the
heartwarming story of Jones, the galaxy\'s oldest kitty-cat, and THWAP!, a
young and naive little facehugger, as they set off across the Third
Imperium in search of Mommy Ripley.  Golly, what an awfully big universe it
is now!  En route they get underfoot at Strephon\'s assassination, make
friends with Virus, engage in wacky hijinks with Vargr pirates and
mercantile shipping insurance regulators, rescue a planetload of innocent
little children from a nasty old near-C rock; clever old Jones uncovers
Archduuke Norris\'s "assistant" as a loathsome Templar, while THWAP! learns
that it\'s dreadfully impolite to shove your ovipositor down Yaskodray\'s
throat, etc.  Voice of Jones: Anthony Hopkins? Lynn Redgrave?  Voice of
THWAP!: The guy that did the original Ren & Stimpy voices, or John Cleese.
Cameo by Sigourney Weaver as the Empress (as in "the Empress Wave").  With
lotsa muscle and leather.  O yes.  Good wholesome family entertainment.  O
yes.

Well, one way is to remember that skills are more than just the knowledge associated with them.  You can have a master martial artist\'s memories, but if you don\'t have his reflexes, honed over decades of practice, you are going to have only a theoretical knowledge of the art, albeit a good one.  Likewise with piloting, diplomacy, or a host of other skills.  I \'know\', in theory, how to juggle.  But I can\'t juggle because I\'ve never practiced and I\'m not terribly coordinated.


Moreover, what guarantee do you have that your implant contains -all- important info?  ("Aw shit, those robots must\'ve been installed -after- my implants were written!  Lousy, no good discount piece of...").  Finally, that master martial artist may have created a wonderful program, but what do you want to bet he left out some unusual moves?  ("Your Kung Fu is very good.  But it is apparent that you know nothing of the Dragon\'s Wing technique.")

Most of the illustrations for BTs appearing in CT and TNE (but not MT) 
appear to include booms of some sort that the BRs ride attached to.
Regardless of configuration, it should be possible to increase the surface
area of a hull to an almost arbitrary degree:  just say "there are six
booms coming out the sides with docking rings for these battle riders and
they add N square meters to the hull surface area, but nothing to the
overall volume contained by the hull."  This will make the hull heavier,
and hence the ship slower, which can actually be viewed as a disadvantage
in design.  I don\'t know what the theoretical maximum surface area to
volume ratio is for any realistic hull, but it is probably very high.  The
volume can be kept constant while surface area changes by adding
convolutions to the geometric shape of the hull (these can be slight, such
as a flattening or narrowing, phlanges, etc.). 

In summary, I think that it is logical to assume that the surface area
rules are intended to provided a minimum requirement, not a maximum
allowance.  If we include the possibility of mounting some systems on
external trestles or other superstructures of some sort, there may not
even be any kind of maximum surface area, as long as you keep adding on
that hull mass.

Anyways, the military ships in "Starships" included a 2,000 ton Frontier

"Milieu 0" Third Imperium setting, how big is a Heavy Cruiser?  A

many fighters would it carry?  Is there anywhere I can find stats for these
ships for T4?

I had thought Starships would allow for the creation of larger vessels, but
I guess FFS is it...

Well in Larry Niven\'s books, they use Telebooths and stepping discs for

How about miniturized componants, each slightly out of \'phase\' with each
other, but still working together as a unit?  Hypothetically, many
componants may occupy the same spatial coordinates but are separated
dimensionally.  This would allow for intense miniturization of power
sources and weapons.

What do you all think?

	So by your definition the programmers who work wonders with

This is an environment where a stray particle can trigger your

You make a very good point, Craig, and in an entertaining way, however you
are overlooking the fact that the GM is just as tech-tied as the players;
in effect, he cannot provide them with a "If the world gets too weird
relative to the players\' own world" type of scenario, because at that point
it will also be too wierd for the GM to understand.  The assumptions and
imagination used for \'futuristic\' scenarios will be created on established
and recognizable thought-processes that the players themselves have and use.

   Agreed.  This is why it is difficult to bring new players into a
Traveller game--even in New Era there are a great number of things that
have to be explained to players so that they don\'t feel left out of
conversations involving older players.

Player 1: "So basically you\'re saying this thing looks kind of like a
Vargr with longer fangs, right?"

Ref: "Exactly."

Player 4: "Oh crap, we don\'t need this right now!"

Player 3: "It could be worse, they could resemble K\'kree."

Player 4: "That\'s not funny."

Player 2: "What\'s a Vargr?"

Player 1: "They look like dogs except that they are intelligent and walk
up right."

Player 3: "Yeah, here\'s a picture of one." (holds up Vargr Alien Module)

Player 2: "Oh, OK.  So what\'s a K\'kree?"

   This explains why Star Trek (which dealt with each of these topics)
is such a miserable failure.  I\'m sure the next ST:NG movie will only
gross around 200 million--truly pathetic.  I\'m surprised they even still
keep making them.

   As long as writers (and referees) exhibit some self control, I have
no problem with any of the above concepts being used in Traveller.  The
idea of "biological robots" as presented in Clarke\'s "3001" seemed so
Solomani I\'m surprised that someone didn\'t ask Bowman what his standing
was in the Party.

I don\'t find Star Trek a failure at all, and anxiously await the next
movie.  The only time star Trek ever let me down was when they allowed
William shatner to write/direct in one - Star Trek 5 : The Final Frontier.
Not only was that a joke, I was doing the MST3K stuff halfway thru it.
What a waste of money that one was.

As to your examples of aliens, (I\'m an old timer, played Traveller since
1981), I would not have gotten the signifigance of your example either.  In
fact, a LOT of the stuff on this list makes little or no sense to me
because the most recent Traveller I\'ve seen is MegaTraveller, and not all
of it.

I never even knew of the existance of the Classic Traveller "Alien" modules
and still have never seen one.  So I couldn\'t tell you a Hiver from a Vargr
from a K\'Khree (spelling?).

PAW into production, so this isnt in character.

I went with batteries because our problem was peak power output - I needed
a quarter of a megawatt for a second, and that needed far too much Fusion
plus, and most of the power would be wasted. Some sort of battery/Fusion
plus setup might work, with the F+ unit refilling the batteries. Anyway,
you have anough batteries for ten minutes of sustained fire, and I think we
can argue if you cant hit whatever (and anything you hit with this baby is
either a tank or will stay hit), then you dont deserve to stay in the gene
pool.

I also have nasty thoughts about the heat output of F+, and what sort of
signature it puts off in a battlefield environment.

Now, someone suggested a continuous output CPAW light-sabre. The problem is
accumulators - you need ten times the lap energy in an accumulator, and net
efficiency is based on input energy times the square root of the number of
laps. Therefore you need at least 100 laps to be worthwhile. This tends to
chew up power awfully fast.

If we want Blaster Rifles, we need to start lobbying *now* for Marc to rule
that just like you can fire a Laser Weapon without a beam pointer, so you
can fire a particle accelerator without one, using the rules for sights and
stocks and such.

That 30 kilo beam pointer really makes even the Baby PAW a
battle-dress-only weapon.

Hmmm. A towed version, a bit bigger, with a 3km beam pointer and an
integral grav unit and a small F+ unit to power the battery pack could be a
really good force equaliser for non-BDE troops, and cost in the KCr70 range.

Now, I would also like to advise any prospective purchasers of the Baby PAW
that it still counts as a PAW under the various Imperial weapons
registration laws.

Next issue - point defense against kinetic energy projrctiles. What is the
smallest point defense radar/ladar you can get ? What TL do you need before
you can reliably stop 

- - a missile going at 1000 m/s ?

- - a KE shell going at 6000 m/s ?

My thinking is that whilst it is true KE projectiles are more efficient at
putting energy into a target, they are also vulnerable to counterfire in a
way lasers and PAWs are not.

So, Roderick, can I head up Famile Spofulam\'s Energy Weapons Section ???

Ditzie : Please please please please pleeeeeeeeeeezzzzzeeee. An an an an I

Sorry, that should be "flanges" -- I meant to look it up and got

some kind of ridge or convolution that adds area without adding volume --

So this \'problem\' with Traveller has been around for awhile. I tend to
explain this in game terms.

Firstly if you start with the premis that the Imperium\'s culture is basically
Vilani you are a long way along the road to explaining it. The Vilani are
fundimentally technologically conservative. However one can also address
cybernetics and genetics directly.

Cybernetics: various sources from MT and late CT mention a widespread
anti-cybernetics prejudice throughout the Imperium (a quote from Margaret
"any being who is more than 25% machine should be regarded as one"). One is
left wondering just how this predujice came about, but it is there.

Genetic Engineering: here the Vilani nature of the Imperium comes into play.
It doesn\'t take much to imagine that the old Vilani prejudice which makes
biology and genetics poor second cousins twice removed to other more
respectable branches of science. However in the Solomani Sphere, Biomed tech
is both more advanced (apparently much more advanced) and a lot more
respectable. Looking in canon referrences you can find the following examples
of Solomani geneering: Dolphins, Scanians (aquatic humans), Oranutangs,
Miniphants, Chimps, the Eugenics Wars, terraforming (presumably using biotech)
etc. Plus late in MT there is evidence of one of Lucan\'s superweapons being
a retrovirus which turned humans into degenerate savages.

But there you run into another problem. Sometimes the GM will see a
certain use of technology as "obvious", and the players will be
surprised by it. More often, it\'ll be a player who realizes that he can
do something with the tech that the GM hadn\'t thought of. And in both
cases, the problem is that if either of them could think of it, the
people in the game universe *definitely* thought of it.

So you have to figure out what the consequences of this neat idea
having "always" been around are. And usually, they mean that you have
to tear up big chunks of background.

As I note in another message you have the problem of not having the
"muscle memory" (which includes reflexes). On the other hand, you\'ll
*know* what the moves *should* feel like. So rather than taking years
to master, things will take "mere" months, because in effect, you\'ll be
the same as a martial artist/juggler/whatever coming from a long period
of bed rest. Your muscles will need to be toned up, and the reflexes
moved from the brain to the spine. But that will go a lot faster than
trying to learn the skill without the implant.

Or, as in several stories I\'ve read, he may have programmed in a
response that lets him nail you by reacting inapropriately to something
totally off the wall.

Such "back doors" in skill sets could nail you bad. "Ah, he\'s using a
Samurai Sytems skill set. That means that if I thumb my nose while

I suspect the objection was that the preceding 15 years of Traveller
history with them was thrown away until FFS1 came out. (Okay, so I know
that High Guard 1st Ed had fusion engines).

And TNE never explained how the hot reaction mass was dealt with in station
docking bays... ;-)

But also, any skill that doesn\'t require "muscle memory" will *also* be
available. It\'s not just *information* that\'ll be readily available.
It\'ll be "programs" for using the info. In short, "skills" and
"experience".

Hidden or secret data will be a lot more obvious though. Much of the
"secret" data in this country can easily be reconstructed by someone
with the time and patience to wade thru all the *piublic* info on the
subject. 

While this mostly applies to scientific/technical info, it also applies
to a lot of other things. Sherlock Holmes won\'t even be in the same
*league* as the average citizen in such a society.

And have fun trying to figure out if the value of that
resistor/capacitor/whatever is what it is because it *has* to be to
work, or because it\'s a "standard" component thrown in because pretty
much any value will work. :-)

The *real* problem, which you missed is that players can\'t really play
a character that is *that* much smarter than the player is. It quits
being role-playing and becomes "roll-playing" as the GM keeps having to
figure out if the *character* would think of things that the player
hadn\'t.

And, of course, there\'s the "evolutionary" differences. What are the chances of
standard Imperial Computer chips being closely enough "related" to Cymbeline
chips for there to be any meaningful possibility of the Cymbeline chips being
able to even recognise them as mateable with? I\'ll tell you -- zip, nada, null,
zero, nought, zilch!

We argued this one to death over the ridiculous plague in TLWH/Gateway.

Yes. There is *NO POSSIBILITY AT ALL* that any non-Imperial state would adopt
something just because the Imperium said it had to. The Imperium is a trade pact
more than anything else (as we are told over and over again) -- it is there to
maximise trade, not restrict it (well, it does restrict it in some ways, but
really only within the Imperium or for defence reasons -- and then only by not
selling High tech stuff to people it doesn\'t want getting it). To tell the Zhos,
Julian Consulate, K\'Kree, Solomani, Aslan, Hivers etc. that the only way they
can trade with Imperial worlds is if they install this you beaut new transponder
system that broacasts *everything* about your ship *continually* to the Imperium
(making it an espionage/commercial espionage device so obvious that even the
Solomani will pick up on it!) would have caused such major diplomatic ructions
that I think we can safely say that there\'s more chance of agreeing that .1 C
rocks are a great idea for discussion on this list! Or, to put it another way, a
snowball has a better chance in hell than getting non-imperials to use what is
so obviously an imperial espionage device (of course, there is no believable or
logical *reason* for the system to work the way it is alleged to have, but
that\'s a different matter).

And I think we can assume that there is an equally close to zero chance that
non-Imperial systems will be compatible with imperial systems of any sort -- as
I note in my article on same in DS#2, its for defence reasons. If you invade a
non-imperial system (or vice versa) then you will find that all of its tech is
non-compatible with yours, and will have to be replaced, at huge cost, to make
the system a viable conquest. In fact, I would suspect that a great deal of
thought would go into making such replacement as difficult and time consuming as
possible.

As for the chances of the chips being distributed in the time allowed -- an
excellent point. However, I would go further, I suspect that we cannot assume
that there would *ever* be full compliance with the use of the chips -- and that
we cannot assume, as the system did, that you would "shoot on sight" any ship
that did not have a Cymbeline based transponder. This is, simply, ludicrous to
such an extreme that it beggars the imagination ... it means, for a start, that
any ship that suffers damage (from a pirate attack, or from some unexpected
shipboard mishap) that renders the Cymbeline transponder system inoperative will
be destroyed on sight. It means that worlds within the imperium that are under
Imperial ban because they have not yet developed starflight will have all their
ships destroyed when they *do*, and when they stumble onto the Imperium that
surrounds them. Either of these possibilities (and they are not the only ones)
make it so close to zero possibility that Cymbeline transponders will be
*assumed* to be universal (let alone the time problems of getting them adopted
before the Rebellion anyway) that it is not worth considering.

There will *always* be some form of traffic control option for ships not
equipped with Cymbeline transponders. To suggest otherwise flies in the face of
objective reality. And that, more than anything else, is my huge objection to
Virus -- so much of it flies in the face of objective reality that it makes a
mockery of the whole idea.

Look, I\'ve said it before, and I\'ll say it again, a *software* based virus makes
more sense than a hardware based one ... and it would be achievable without much
trouble. There are Imperial standards and accords on computers and software, and
we can assume that there are (effectively) Imperially mandated (and hidden)
"backdoors" and points of vulnerability in all Imperial Software ... so
releasing multiple software viruses would have the same effect as Virus, and
everyone would be able to settle back and accept it.

Just as likely is the release of some human viral disease(s) intended (probably)
to be debilitating but controllable -- but which mutate in unexpected ways, and
which go incredibly lethal. With multiple releases over all areas that Lucan can
get to, and with a long enough incubation period, the effects would be
devastating. Decivilisation by catastrophe ... you kill enough of the techs and
and society collapses. In fact, if you think about it, you could have a *binary*
virus ... spread the two parts so that they can only come into contact as a
*result* of trade and travel. Nasty.

Well, I suppose it depends on whether you consider them computers or merely
computerised peripherals. Then, of course, there\'s nothing that they can do to
affect the ground based controller computer if the satellite dish is
disconnected (and the probably can\'t even if it is connected). Then, of course,
they have a destruct switch in the rocket which is meant to destroy the whole
shebang if the launch goes wrong. Does this self-destruct charge still exist and
is it still active on the orbiting satellite? Anyway, it doesn\'t matter because
these peripherals *can* be cut out of the main computer\'s circuit.

So, if you\'d stop being so personal about it, you might see that there is a
perfectly reasonable explanation for it.

And, of course, if the EPROM is corrupted, what do you do? You power down the
system, crack the case, and replace the EPROM. You may even format the hard
drive first. And after you\'ve done all this, then you reload the system from
CD-ROM. I\'m sorry you seem to take it as some sort of personal attack -- it
isn\'t intended that way, it is merely intended to show that the whole idea of
Virus is a crock of you know what.

In fact, I\'ll go further -- the problem with Virus is the same problem GDW has
had with landing USL ships on atmosphere possessing planets. In short, while it
was a hard and fast rule for which there was no detailed explanation -- and
there was no detailed explanation of how the technology of the drives prevented
it, I don\'t think anyone had a problem with it. *HOWEVER*, once GDW gave a
bullshittium explanation of how the drives worked, then people looked at it and
said, "Err, why can\'t you land a USL ship on an atmosphere possessing planet?
The way the drive is said to work *by you* would indicate that it is eminently
possible!" In short, the more bullshittium they lay on, the more problems they
create for themselves ... often, quite simply, because they haven\'t thought the
implications of the ideas through, or, equally as often, because they simply
haven\'t thought of all the ramifications that the warped geniuses on the TML and
Tech ML can twist out of their statements! Just cool down, this isn\'t a personal
attack on you.

True, but it isn\'t as easy as you\'d think. 

Since the hull is in a vacuum, that means that any added surface area
that can "see" any other area of the hull is *wasted* to the extent
that it sees the other part of the hull. This is because the radiated
heat would just get picked back up by that other part of the hull.

So the added area has to be things like "fins" running the length of
the hull (don\'t forget to count the area of *both* sides). But you
can\'t have more than 4 of them or you are back to the "facing each
other" problem.

Not to toot my own horn, but..

There is a product just released called Imperial Squadrons.  In it, you\'ll
find a couple of big ships designed by your humble servant.  I put in a
Destroyer Escort, a Carrier, an Armored Cruiser, and my favorite, the
90,000ton Coronation-class Battleship.

At TL 12, cruisers run from about 10ktons to 60ktons.
Battleships/Dreadnoughts max out at about 90ktons.. there are problems with
surface area beyond that.
A Frigate would probaly be somewhere in the 5k-10kton range, depending on
mission requirements.

By the way.. a near-C cookie to the first person to figure out the joke
behind the name of the Bass Straight DE.  Craig already knows, so he\'s
diqualified.

   Hard to review a movie that you only saw 2/3rds of, <sarcasm on> but
I\'m glad that didn\'t deter you in anyway.  BTW, thanks for all the

   Funny, I would have thought it was "holier than thou"

having over half your paycheck stolen away in taxes to pay for a
bureaucracy to tell you when to go to the bathroom.

   Actually in the US 12 year old boys aren\'t allowed to see this film
without a parent or legal guardian.  Kinda hard to tailor a movie for an
audience that legally can\'t see it without mom and/or dad sitting in the
next seat, eh?

   BTW, I\'d like to get Wynona Ryder\'s white android spooge on my

the *whole* movie, and think about it in that context.  It\'s apparent
that you missed the point.

   Sorry I should have perhaps issued a sarcasm alert.  My point was
that other sci-fi vehicles have dealt very successfully with those
supposed "taboo" topics in Traveller.  Traveller could include them as
optional items (a la FF&S I), making sure the referee as enough
"restrictive tools" so that sessions don\'t end up being "Borg Meets the
CyberNanites From Mars".

   BTW, that 200 million figure is probably low.

   Point here was that it is difficult to run a game in which you have
to constantly step out of character in explain everything.  In the best
role playing sessions, you should feel the break in concentration when
the referee has to stop things for a moment to go to the bathroom, or a
player calls a stoppage to have something explained outside the game.

	You know, I\'ve always been a little disappointed by the direction
the series took after Aliens.  When you think about it, the Aliens are a
little too... tailored to prey on humanity than random natural selection in
separate ecologies should reasonably allow.  If you were setting out to
design a critter to deal with humans, it\'d be hard to come up with better.

	Were I to have been writing the series, it would have turned up
that the critters were bioweapons to begin with...  some rather
non-confrontational but decidedly hostile ETs just cooked them up, left
them where humans would be sure to find them, and sat back to watch the
fireworks.

Our ideas of gender modesty (and gender roles for that matter) are very
definitly a cultural inheritance and there is no reason to expect them to
apply in the future. Gender modesty is especially prone to disappearing in
times of stress (such as being shot at) when the parties concerned are
usually more concerned with staying alive. Given that starship crews have
been coed since the interstellar wars, I\'d hazzard that such concepts are
regarded as quaint relics of ancient history (much like we regard many of
our ancestors ideas and beliefs, subjects for humourous rendition in period
dramas). I\'d guess that in basic training, military personnel would be
deliberately bunked coed to break down any such ideas. If gender modesty
can put a ship ad crew at risk, its a fairly safe bet that the military will
take steps to eliminate that risk either by segregating crews (seperate men
and women crews) or by breaking down such inhibitions (much like basic
training breaks down a lot now). Me, I pick the latter option, its a darn
sight easier.

Trains do not stops for anything where I live, except other trains.  The
bridges, sharp turns, etc. could be handled better by a computer.  By the
time the engineer sees a problem, it is already too late to do anything
about it.

But the computers will not be as flexible dealing with problems until TL17.

Maybe there is nothing the pilot *has* to do.  He is just a seldom-used but
flexible backup system in case something goes terribly wrong.  And as long
as you are going to have someone on board for just such a contingecy, you
may as well dumb down the automation so that he has something to do.

Your point is a very good one.  Maybe at TL13 there was a one-percent
chance that something would go wrong that would require human intervention.
 Say that dropped to 0.1% at TL14 and 0.01% at TL15 as systems improved,
and the change to automated ships never occurred because of sheer intertia
(and that scouts union!).

Many scouts would fear the downsizing associated with automation.  An
internal fight could be going on in the scout service over this issue, with
the manned ship proponents seeking to sabotage the flight testing of the
unmanned xboats.  Either side might be looking for a band of adventurers.

It gets worse when he sends you a postcard of said beach and says how much
fun it is to relax and let life go past, with a PowerBook and a cold drink.

I have two. Unfortunately the beach appears to be a high spec option...

Am I correct in guessing you don\'t like "Blakes 7", or "Doctor Who" either?
Personally I think they\'re some of the greatest Sci-Fi shows ever, they\'re
all plagued with serious inconsistences though.  But then I like "Lost in
Space" (at least the first 6 episodes), so my taste in Sci-Fi might be
suspect :^)

I will say that this won\'t be as confusing using the GURPS measurements for
something like GURPS Tekumel (this was in their magazine, not a book).
While I prefer Metric (and I\'m American) I\'m used to having to convert
between the two, so as I said above it\'s not that important.

Yes, PLEASE!  I Feal quite strongly that any web page with content that
anyone might want to print out should have black lettering (having said
that he pauses with a frown on his face, and thinks, "doesn\'t my Traveller
section have a black background on part of it").  There is nothing more
irritating that going to a web page full of technical info that I need, and
not being able to print it out!

Again I say, YES, PLEASE.  For one thing remember some people are surfing
the web with computers that can\'t even see this stuff, and in some cases
can\'t access the pages that have it.  Not everyone is running Windows 95 on
a
Pentium II with ungodly amounts of RAM, etc.  Some people either due to
preferance or not being able to afford anything else are running systems
that don\'t support Jave, or animated GIF\'s, or Frames, etc.  Keep it simple
and it will load fast, and everyone can enjoy it.  I\'m not saying skip
graphics though, sorry those people browsing the Web on their Commodore
64\'s using Lynx (I\'m not joking), or something simular, will have to suffer
wondering what thier missing.  Animated GIF\'s really aren\'t a problem, but
Frames and Java can be.

Well Scott, my page is designed to run under Netscape Communicator 4.xx,
mainly because that is all that I have to view it from.  My Internet
Explorer 3.02 crashes on the Java that Geocities built into my site,
however Explorer 4.0 can read it with no problem.

The command I use to put midi on my site is a Netscape only command,
I\'ve found out by accident.

Eris, don\'t mind me.  I think I got a little out of hand when I answered
that one last night, and owe you an apology.  I\'ve just seen a few to many
people saying how terrible of a thing GURPS Traveller is.

Sounds like my style of running Traveller, no rules, just the setting and
character generation.  Because of this style I like in depth character
generation, and I think GURPS is pretty decent for this.

Good point, I was doing good to get my copy used.

Another good point, but then of the books you mentioned I\'ve already got
them with the exception of Martial Arts and Vehicles.  I don\'t care about
Martial Arts, and I _WANT_ Vehicles 2nd Ed., but can\'t find it.

Besides you failed two mention the Space Atlases.  Those are HARD to find
(I\'m still hunting for #4) but I bought them originally to use with
Traveller.  Also there is GURPS Aliens, and the Space Bestiary (probably
both out of print).  The thing about GURPS that really sucks is that there
are so many good books, and most are out of print.

I\'d say EDU should be a cost modifier for certain skills, in fact I think
the Hero Games system did this.  However, I also think this is something
you should have to buy.  OK, based on that, it\'s probably best to have it
as an Attribute, since IIRC attributes and skills are bought from separate
point pools.

I won\'t deny that the Traveller TL implementation has serious faults!
However, I consider it to be solidly a part of Traveller.

Hey, like I said, I got a little spun up last night.  Besides it wasn\'t

Traveller.

Bizarre behavior made slightly more explicable when you consider that these

get more caffeine or nicotine into your system quickly than through the

The "standard" term for this in American SF seems to be "spacing". As

We had a major social goof occur back in the early 80s. The company I
was working for was German owned, and they had a *lot* of techs over
here helping with startup. 

After things got going well enough for most of them to head back, it
was decided to throw a party for them before they left. It was a
barbeque. 

Everything went fine until the hostess brought out the corn on the
cob... 

Seems that in Germany corn is only fed to pigs...

There\'s a major problem with this. There are a limited number of
frequencies to operate the radars/lidars on. And if you are using the
same frequency as another ship, or even one that is "close enough",
*neither* of you will get anything but hash. 

It\'s sort of like going around at night with *powerful* flashlights.
You can see ok using one. But if there\'s a bunch of folks using them,
you\'ll spend a lot of time being blinded by someone else\'s flashlight.

With *ranging* systems it gets worse. You can\'t tell if an echo is a
return from a pulse sent out by *your* radar, or one sent out by
someone else\'s[1]. Which means you don\'t know how long it\'s been
travelling, and thus don\'t know the range. 

This will give you a lot of false targets on the screen.

This sort of thing is why commercial aircraft use transponders rather
than active radar. 

[1] well, actually, you *can* if you embed pulse codes in the pulse.
But this *greatly* increases the cost of the gear. And even if civilian
ships used such gear, they\'d likely have limited numbers of pulse codes.

As they say in _Buckaroo Banzai_, "Home is where you wear your hat!"  Sure.

Toothbrush; coupla changes of clothes (including hat); wallet.

Pack the clothes and stuff properly in a suitcase or something.  Add a camera.

From there?  Cheesy folk art.  Tourist ashtrays/mugs/shirts.  Alien
bestseller novel off the rack in the departure lounge.

My attitude is: better off dead than being stuck in the wilderness.  So
assume you\'re going to come out in a civilized area.  You\'ll be prepared
and ready to have a good time; and if you find yourself in some exotic
jungle/desert/steppe, you\'ll die and get it all over with pretty quickly,
without suffering through all that outdoor survival crap.

Check out the old Roman sauce called "garum". It\'s fish based, and the
"standard" method involved letting the fish *ferment*. The "quick"
method is more acceptable to moderns.

And for that matter, check out the old "traditional" method of making
soy sauce.

Beer, wine. A culture could consider these to be "rotten" grain/fruit
just as the Chinese consider cheese to be "rotten milk".

I keep thinking that we need to put a civilization dominated by

that\'s several tech levels higher. Though the same tech level will do.

People eat raw oysters, and eat grubs and mealworms. Compared with

It helps to re-read some parts of "Glory Road". The "frogs" at the
banquet at Squire whatisname\'s on Nevia. And for that matter, the
consequences of not "getting" the idiom about "bed". :-)

Personally?  No.  Characters I\'ve played?  Some yes (B.J.Wheeler, IISS Master
Scout, would probably consider it \'fun\') and some no (Dr. Gzoe Zanore likes
his creature comforts).

From what\'s in my apartment?  I\'d grab my machete, bowie knife, and canteen.

Go to an outdoor-store, and get a multipurpose axe/shovel type tool, a
survival
knife, and a solar still.

Same as above; survival for a year is about the same as survival for an
indefinite period of time.

This is a ship I can easily imagine the Imperium building.

It has a frightenly short-ranged punch and is too big to hide, too slow to
run, and it has a glass jaw.

The combination of seventy minimum meters diameter and 1.1 gees makes it\'s
"hit certain" range about 1.5 light seconds. If Dave Golden\'s equations are
right, a Coronation class can be consistently tagged out to about a million
kilometers, under battlefield conditions.

The 12.5 cm of superdense is grossly inadequate, being penetrated by a 3600
megajoule PAW. The relative lack of nuclear dampers is, in my opinion,
criminal, and the thinness of the meson screens worse.

The main weapon barely extends to one light-second, and the secondary
weapons suite is questionable in it\'s ability to stop a strike of 250 or so
nuke-det missiles.

As a warship, it is built neither to run nor to fight.

In time of war, it will be a safe posting, for no sane admiral will ever
risk one in line of battle.

Raw fish prepared properly is Good Food; clearly fresh, healthy, and good
for you.  Cheese is milk that\'s been allowed to rot; how can that possibly
compare?

Personally, I\'m fond of cheeseburgers, and also like sushi.

Seems to me a reasonable outline.

I couple questions, to Marc and the list in general:

1. Is Wildstar still working on QSDS v2, or has this become vapourware?
;-)

2. If 1. is true, will this be considered as the new ship design system
to be included in T4.1?

3. Has anyone been using the RPSCS (Role-playing ship combat system), or
done any other work on it? (latest version I\'ve seen is 0.9)

4. Will the RPSCS be considered as the basis of the new ship combat
system?


My hopes:

I think QSDS is an admirably quick and simple way to build a starship,
if QSDS2 is updated for compatibility with FF&S2 and the combat system;
and if easy to follow flowcharts/checklists are included, I think it
would serve quite well as the design system.

I\'d hate to see yet another design system that isn\'t a direct decendant
of or compatible with any other previously published system.

The RPSCS seems just the ticket for a combat system. I haven\'t
playtested it yet, but ISTM that *role-play* being the focus (as opposed
to wargame, ala BL & BR) is a good premise for the basic rulebook.

The presentation of RPSCS could be tweaked a bit, with the addition of a
clear flowchart, checklist, turn sequence or whatever you\'d like to call
it.

I *definitely* would like to keep the basis for combat being
detect-lock-fire, _please_ don\'t water it down to just a basic "to hit"
task roll. Don\'t skip the important considerations of detection with
active/passive sensors, keeping a fire control lock on target, *then* 
firing.

Combat is much more suspenseful and realistic with the additional step
of tracking the target down, evasion, sensor jamming, spoofing, worrying
about "lighting up" the active sensors, powering down equipment to
reduce signature, and all the other fun stuff. :)
