  Well, it\'s good to see that they\'re staying true to Travellers\' roots* -
and the price looks pretty reasonable for a 96 to 128 page 8.5x11" book.

Good numbers work. You took some reasonably complex mathematics
and turned them into a set of tables that can be used by any Traveller
group. They\'re a nice bit of chrome for spreading out the traffic a bit,
and you even took the trouble of adding GURPs rules to it. That\'s the
kind of idea work I love to see on TML.

If the assumptions behind the numbers are reasonable, and the math
is correct, I\'d say your table belongs in a Traveller supplement - perhaps
in T5\'s answer to  _Scouts_ or _Merchant Prince_?

I don\'t disagree about submarines.  I was limiting my comments to
surface ships.  

Others disagree even about surface raiders, siting the damage done
by CSA ships and the collateral effect of tying down ships in convoy
and covering duties.  Perhaps, they are correct, but I\'m not sure
surface raiding had much effect on the eventual outcome of the
various conflicts.

    'body' => 'Heyo,

I\'ve been pretty quiet throughout the piracy debates this time around, but 
something that has been bothering me for a long time finally tickled me 
enough to enable me putting a finger on it exactly.

To recap, however...one of the primary sticking points over the possibility 
of piracy or no is the ability of a given system to defend out to 100d.  No 
further defense is necessary, because that is all the space that starships 
will ever travel.

This has always bothered me.  I\'ve pointed out in the past that 
intra-system travel is likely to be as heavy as intersystem travel, but the 
common idea is that micro-jumps are perfectly satisfactory for intra- as 
for inter-system.  (I don\'t necessarily agree with that...)  Then there is 
the fact that even tho\' the skill of astrogation/navigation exists, it 
doesn\'t affect the outcome of a jump.  Largely, if you point your ship at a 
system several light years away, you pop out at the 100d point of the 
mainworld everytime (excepting major mis-jumps).  I started wondering about 
that - that\'s awfully precise navigation, especially when you begin 
thinking that the stellar gravity well (100d) would be a much easier point 
to aim for.  I would have to say the task roll for a 100 planetary diameter 
propagation of the jump would not be \'routine\', tho\' perhaps a 100 stellar 
diameter propagation would be...

This evening it began to jell...gravity *does* affect the j-field.  That 
has been canon since the LBBs.  So, if you are configuring a jump between 
two systems (using the hex grid) it looks roughly like this:

   1     2               1     2
3    o ---- 4 ---- 3 ----o    4
   5     6               5     6

origin system   destination system

I used \'o\' to represent the sun\'s in each system (asterisks were 
off-center).  Roughly speaking, if the origin planet is in position 4 and 
the destination planet is in position 3, then there is no problem - no 
interfering gravity well.  BUT if the origin planet is in position 3, the 
stellar mass of the system blocks the jump to your intended destination 
system.  Essentially, the j-field will collapse before it fully forms when 
you reach 100 stellar diameters.  And if the destination planet is in 
position 4, your jump will propagate at 100 stellar diameters as well - on 
the wrong side of the system.  I could make an argument for masking if the 
origin position was 1 or 3 and the destination position was 4 or 6 as well, 
at least enough to require a starship to maneuver clear of the gravity 
well\'s interference.

This does not account for the planetary orbits you are crossing either - 
the case could easily be made for a starship having to travel far beyond 
the 100d point in order to unmask the destination system before being able 
to jump...or for the jump to end prematurely because of an intervening 
gravity well.  And while the Traveller economic system is geared to 25 
jumps per year, I\'m no longer sure that is really feasible.

I\'m aware that I have only incorporated 2D into my description - I\'m still 
working on all of the ramifications.  But the stellar masking of star 
systems is just as valid for the 3D model as the 2D model.  This is a new 
idea I\'m working through, and would like to hear some comments.  :)

    'body' => 'Assessment and Management of Trauma Victims
A. Triage (Fr., roughly, "to sort")
The effective use of limited resources in a battlefield or other
disaster situation requires medical personnel to rapidly assess
casualties and prioritise them.

General priorities :-
Support life
Control haemorrhage
Prevent brainstem compression or spinal cord damage
Diagnose and treat all other injuries

B. The Primary Survey
Identify and treat the immediately life-threatening problems.
(=resuscitation or Immediate Action)

OR : Keep the patient alive until someone can provide definitive
treatment.
How?
This is best summarised by the first aid mnemonic :-
A - Airway : ensure that it is patent.
    Manoeuvres range from chin lift or jaw thrust (or pulling the
    middle third of someone\'s face back into place?!)
    to passing an airway tube (naso- or oropharyngeal, laryngeal
    mask, endotracheal tube [ the gold standard ]) to creating a
    surgical airway (cricothyroid puncture, tracheostomy)

* Always, always, assume the cervical spine (neck) is unstable
until proven otherwise! Avoid undue extension ; immobilise
(collars/braces) or provide longitudinal stabilisation if you must move
it (to protect the airway, say).

B - Breathing : supply oxygen, treat pain
   *Give high-flow oxygen through a mask or down a tube if one is
    placed.
   *Give analgesics to reduce pain (especially) from rib or sternum
    fractures, so it doesn\'t hurt to breathe.
   *Drain collections of air or blood in the chest or stomach that
    may be preventing lung inflation.
   *Assisted ventilation is the ultimate measure (expired air or
    \'bagging\' with ventilator).
C - Circulation : maintain a blood pressure sufficient to perfuse
                  vital organs (brain, heart/lungs, kidneys)
   *Shock occurs when cardiac output cannot meet the metabolic
    demands of the rest of the body. It is usually due to a low
    (falling?!) blood volume (hypovolaemic shock) in the context
    of trauma, but can be due to injury to the heart (cardiogenic
    shock).
   *Control obvious external bleeding with direct pressure.
   *Establish reliable venous access, with at least one big
    cannula.
   *Aggressive fluid resuscitation will be required with
    significant blood loss (20% of circulating volume or more for
    an otherwise fit individual). An adult can lose a litre of
    blood into their thigh from a fractured femur without it being
    clinically apparent (apart from a sharp drop in blood pressure
    and fast, thready pulse).
   *In extreme situations, draining collections of blood or air
    from the chest or the sac covering the heart may be
    life-saving, as is external or direct cardiac massage...

**Rules :-
Resuscitation/Immediate Action
    1. Assess injury severity (overview)

    Average, Medical/First Aid, Edu, uncertain

    Difficult if internal injuries are present (unless med scanner
    available, which makes task Average).

    No characteristics at zero : Superficial
    One char. at zero          : Minor
    Two char. at zero          : Major
    Three char. at zero        : Destroyed
    Varying amounts of truth change the estimate up or down levels
(ref\'s choice).

    Maintaining consciousness is a Difficult, End task - also see below.

    Patients with Major level damage or greater will show signs of shock
i.e. altered level of consciousness (decreased or delirious), impaired
breathing (A, B, or C causes?), decreased blood pressure and usually an
increased pulse (hypotension and tachycardia).
    For simplicity, Major and Minor damage levels become one level
worse after an hour without treatment.
    Destroyed level damage requires resuscitation within five minutes to
permit brain salvage.

    2. Airway manoeuvres :-
    *Chin lift/jaw thrust :- Easy, Medical/First Aid, Dex

    *Reducing facial fracture :- Difficult, Medical, Dex.
    First Aid can be used at half skill level.

    *Introducing airway :- variable, Medical, Dex/Edu. TL 4+
       oropharyngeal : Easy, First Aid OK
       nasopharyngeal : Average, First Aid OK.
       laryngeal mask or endotracheal tube : Average. Requires
       unconscious patient or general anaesthetic. Awake + local
       (becomes Difficult). First Aid can be used at half skill
       level.
       Surgical airways : Difficult. (local + tools). Becomes
       Average with general anaesthetic and appropriate tools.
       +1 difficulty level for impromptu tools and/or inadequate
       anaesthesia.

* All airway manoeuvres have a risk of mishap : disrupting the cervical
spine, base of skull (making existing injuries worse) or putting an
endotracheal tube into the oesophagus (unrecognised, this is a lethal
error) instead of the trachea readily spring to mind.

    3. Breathing :-
    * Placing a chest drain : Average, Med, Dex/Edu. Requires
    local anaesthetic and tools.

    *Placing a gastric tube to decompress the stomach :
    Average, Med, Dex. TL 4+

    *Ventilation : Average, Med/First Aid, Dex/Edu. Easy if
    \'bagging\' (manual TL 4+, mechanical ventilator TL 5+)

* Inserting drainage tubes can make things worse. Hearts have been
perforated by personnel inserting chest drains. Stomachs have been
perforated inserting gastric tubes. Never, never introduce a gastric or
airway tube through the nose of someone who may have a base of skull
fracture ; it may end up poking into the brain...

    4. Circulation :-
    * Applying a pressure bandage : Easy or no task, Med/First Aid

    *Inserting an IV cannula : Average, Med/First Aid, Dex
    +1 difficulty level for Serious wounds (2 chars to zero).

    * Volume resuscitation : (wound difficulty), Med/First Aid, victim\'s
End (co-operative)

    Wound        Difficulty
    Superficial  Easy (usually not required)
    Minor        Average
    Major        Difficult
    Destroyed    Formidable

    Success restores consciousness if not anaesthetised/sedated or
    Destroyed level damage (clinically dead!). A safe blood
    pressure is maintained in the presence of a patent airway and
    adequate oxygenation.

    Volume resuscitation :- blood, blood products (eg. clotting
    factors), colloids (protein or starch solutions), crystalloids
    (salt solutions) - TL 4+
    Crystalloids or colloids can be used until blood is available.
    Blood and blood products should be used only when bleeding is
    controlled (except for very dire circumstances).

    *Aspirating the pericardial sac : Difficult, Medical, Dex

    *Opening the chest to perform direct cardiac massage :-
    Difficult, Med, Dex (assumes appropriate tools present, +1
    difficulty if not).

* These last two tasks imply Major or Destroyed damage. Mishaps
could be disastrous. By this stage though it might not matter too
much...

     5. Stabilised or not?
Further volume checks can be made every ten minutes or so or at
important points (transfer onto or off a vehicle, or for dramatic
effect...)

C. The Secondary Survey
Evaluate injury by region and treat accordingly.
i. Evaluation.
Clinical examination can be supplemented by :-
* Laboratory investigations (TL 4+) : blood haemoglobin the most
important value. Arterial blood oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, and
measures of clotting times, may also be useful.
* X-rays (TL4+) : cervical spine (neck) and chest views are the most
important ones to take!
Other obvious fractures should be evaluated once the patient is stable,
so that the Orthopaedic surgeon can sort them out.
* Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (TL5+) : a small incision is made into
the abdomen and sterile saline instilled. If the aspirated fluid
contains blood, significant internal injury is likely and surgery is
necessary.
* Angiography (TL 5+) : Contrast media (X-ray/MR/nuclear scan) can be
injected to delineate bleeding sites. Bleeders can be made to stop by
injecting procoagulants or placing obstructing objects (TL 7+) -
embolisation. Sometimes this works.
* Ultrasound (TL6+) : identification of organ injuries from blunt trauma
are more readily spotted this way (air, blood or fluid has a different
echotexture to tissue). This supercedes peritoneal lavage.
* CT scanning (TL 7+) : the investigation of choice in the initial
evaluation of head injury at this TL, as it permits detailed brain
imaging.
* MR scanning (TL 8+) : like CT, but good for other tissues ; higher
resolution. Some logistic and clinical problems arise because of the
intense magnetic field (shifting bullets, shrapnel...)
* Antiproton CT (TL 10+) : better resolution than MR, no magnetic
problems....
* Gravisonic modulator (TL 11+) : gravisonic imaging enables high
resolution (not as good as antiproton CT) radiation free imaging.
* Meson scanner (TL 11+) : comparable to antiproton CT, not reliant upon
expensive antimatter (meson decay serves as gamma source).
(Thanks Bruce Mac!)

**Rules :

         *Diagnosis of injury : Average, Medical, Edu, uncertain

         This task can be co-operative (either with sophont
         physicians or expert systems). The practical upper limit
         is three medics.

         Higher technology level investigations reduce
         uncertainty:
         TL 4-5         +1 DM on uncertainty roll
            6-8         +3 DM "
            9-11        +4 DM "
            11+         +5 DM "

         *To perform a successful embolisation : Difficult,
         Medical, Dex, uncertain. Equipment is required to attempt
         this task.

At lower tech levels, more surgery is performed.
At higher tech levels, more sophisticated tests are performed.

Stability (volume) checks should be made during the evaluation process.

"So how bad is it, Doc?"
The abbreviated injury score (AIS) is a Real World system used to
evaluate the management of trauma victims.
It was initially devised to develop standards of care for road accident
casualties, but the scope of its use has increased.

The body is divided into regions :-
head, neck and face, thorax, abdomen, pelvis and extremities, external
(skin!). Random localisation on 1D, or previously determined (eg. aimed
shots, other situational modifiers).

Injuries are rated on the following scale :-
0 no injury
1 minor
2 moderate
3 serious, not life threatening
4 severe, survival probable
5 critical, survival uncertain
6 unsurvivable

This scale readily lends itself to Traveller application.
0 to 1 : superficial
2 to 3 : minor (one characteristic at zero)
4 to 5 : serious (two characteristics at zero)
6 : destroyed (all chars at zero)

ii. Treatment
a. Superficial injuries :-
eg. Shallow lacerations or cuts, abrasions (scrapes), simple fractures
or dislocations (closed, (non)reduced, not hand, femur, spine or
depressed skull), corneal abrasions or foreign bodies.

Suturing (TL 2+), bandaging and dressing (TL 1+), immobilisation in
plaster cast or splinting (TL 1+), pain relief (TL 1+).

Suturing a wound, or reducing a fracture/dislocation requires either
local anaesthesia (TL 5+) or reliable sedation up to and including
general anaesthetic (TL 4+).

b. Minor
eg. deep lacerations (skin traversed), multiple simple limb or facial or
individual compound fractures (bone through skin) of same, simple
pneumothoraces (collections of air in the chest outside the lungs),
superficial foreign bodies (bullets/shrapnel), penetrating eye injuries.

Exploration and suturing of wounds (local or general anaesthesia
required, so TL 4+) or placement of a chest drain (TL 4+).
Complicated fractures (eg. hand/wrist, femur, depressed skull) and eye
injuries require surgery (general anaesthetic, TL 4+). All require
analgesia.

c. Major
eg. Head injuries with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage or compound
fracture, pelvic ring fractures, multiple rib or sternum fractures (if
three or more adjacent ribs are fractured, a so called flail segment is
produced. Ventilating the lung becomes difficult.), blunt or penetrating
cardiac or chest injury, blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma, multiple
compound fractures, limb crush injuries or (near-)amputations.

Surgical intervention after resuscitation is mandatory, if only to
control bleeding and remove dead tissue. Resuscitation and placement
into low berth is an alternative if technology permits.

d. Destroyed
eg. combinations of injuries in (c), above, with the additional
complication of cardiac arrest (actual or imminent).
Resuscitation is required within five minutes of cardiac standstill to
permit brain salvage (in the absence of mitigating protective factors
like severe hypothermia or some drugs).

Placement in a low berth and transport to a TL 13+ medical
facility offers the best chance for long-term survival, in the absence
of prompt heroic medical and surgical intervention.

**Rules
      The following task covers any area not previously specified.

      To treat injuries :- variable, Medical/First Aid, Edu/Dex
      Severity      Difficulty
      Superficial   Easy ; First Aid OK
      Minor         Average ; First Aid OK
      Major         Difficult
      Destroyed     Formidable

      This is a co-operative task ; the surgeon\'s first assistant
      provides half their skill.
      Optionally, up to two surgical teams (surgeon+first
      assistant) can operate at the same time on different parts
      of the patient.
      Surgery requiring general anaesthetic, or resuscitation for
      Destroyed injuries requires an  endotracheal tube to control
      the airway.
      +1 difficulty level for impromptu/inadequate tools
      (eg. suturing without local anaesthetic) and/or setting (in
            the field vs operating theatre).
    **The usual outcome for this task is to enable healing. On a
      Spectacular Success, 1D damage points are \'rolled back\'.
      Spectacular Failure inflicts 1D damage.

Aftercare and Outcomes
Survival depends primarily on two factors :-
- - the rapidity and appropriateness of resuscitation
  The concept of \'the golden hour\' is well established. People
  tend to survive if definitive treatment after resuscitation
  has started within the first hour after injury.
- - the severity of head injury sustained.
  There are three mortality peaks :
  immediate (massive injuries)
  hours later (decompensated shock, usually in the emergency room
  or operating theatre)
  days to weeks later (from head injury complications or
  multi-organ failure, usually in the wards or ICU).

**Rules : Costs of Treatment and Aftercare
1. Superficial Damage :
Healing is complete within four to six weeks for fractures or two weeks
for cuts and scrapes without further treatment. Bone stimulation (TL 9+)
and wound glue (TL 9+) reduce this period to two weeks for fractures or
one week for wounds.
Point losses are recovered over the course of a week (one point or more
in all affected characteristics per day), or three days with advanced
treatments.

Costs : 3D Cr for bandages, analgesics, etc.
        General anaesthetic (theatre) : 500Cr (day surgery implied)

Complications : Infection occurs on a Spectacular Failure on a Average,
End task (roll a natural 2). Healing stops until the infection is
treated.

2. Minor :-
Fractures are amenable to bone stimulation after orthopaedic correction
(usually operative).
Point losses are restored at the rate of one point per day in all
affected characteristics.
Costs :- supplies 10 X 2D Cr ; theatre 500 X 1D Cr ; hospital inpatient
200Cr per day if surgery required (usual admission lasts a week) ;
outpatient (home/ED) care 50Cr per day until recovery complete.

Complications : Infection occurs on a Spectacular Failure on a
Difficult, Med (attending doctor), End task. This check is made on the
third day after treatment. Healing stops until the infection is treated.

3. Major :-
Hospitalisation can be prolonged, despite the best care available.
Characteristics recover at one point per day in any one characteristic.
Medical slow drug can dramatically hasten this (10:1) ; ICU level care
is required.

To thaw from low berth : Difficult, Med, Edu

Costs :- Theatre 1000 X 1D ; hospital 500Cr per day (ICU) until stable,
then 200Cr per day thereafter. Low berth 1000/week.
Discharge from hospital once characteristics are 50% of their original
value or better ; home care cost as above.

Progress and Complications :-
Unconsciousness/coma : after surgery, consciousness checks are made
daily (Difficult, End). While comatose and/or at least one
characteristic at zero, must stay in ICU.
Recovery of points or waking up -> discharge to ward.

Infection and other catastrophes : Difficult, Med (attending doctor),
End tasks are checked every second day, or daily if on slow drug.
Spectacular Failure leads to the development of some problem. 1D damage
is applied promptly.

Effects :-
All characteristics to zero :- cardiac arrest, any cause
Two characteristics to zero :- eg. severe infection, bleeding, pulmonary
embolism (blood clot to lungs), heart attack (myocardial infarction).
One characteristic to zero :- minor infection or wound breakdown.

4. Destroyed :-
Successful resuscitation and surgery (if required) will permit healing
at the rate of one point in one characteristic per week.
Slow drug can be used.
Deferred definitive treatment requires low berthing, or in extreme
situations, fast drug.

Reanimation is a Formidable Medical, Edu task (co-operative OK).
+1 difficulty level if fast drug used instead of low berthing.

Progress and Complications :-
Consciousness checks are made twice a week (Difficult, End).
Catastrophe checks are made daily.
Once 50% of baseline points in one characteristic are recovered, regard
as major wound.
Discharge from ICU is not possible until this stage.

Costs :-
Reanimation 150KCr. Other costs as listed above.

Good work, Douglas!  

I was thinking about the 100 diameter limit too.  Here\'s another way to
handle the situation.  Make the position at jump exit a function of how
well the astrogator makes his skill roll.  If the astrogator just make
his roll, place the ship well outside the 100diam limit.  On critical
success, place the ship at the limit.

    'body' => 'The Luriani Voyaging Caravans

One of the central facets of the Luriani culture has always been their 
“Voyaging” ships. The first Voyagers were the huge vessels which traversed 
Daramm’s oceans during the Luriani’s early prehistory. Each of these early 
vessels was virtually a floating town, with hundreds of inhabitants, trading with 
the various island settlements.. It was these early voyagers that were the 
catalyst that lead to the rise of civilisation of Daramm and subsequently 
provided the glue that bound it together.

When the Luriani first reached towards the stars it was natural that these 
voyagers would be amongst the first to do so. Rather than constructing huge 
ships in imitation of their oceangoing vessels, these Voyagers chose to 
produce fleets of small asteroid ships which travelled as caravans and 
wandered between the Luriani worlds carrying goods and passengers as 
demanded. Each voyaging ship carried a complete set backup machinery and 
controls so that when a new ship was required, it was a simple matter to hollow 
out a new asteroid and fit it out from the parent ship. Both ships then gradually 
replaced their backups and thus the number of voyaging ships slowly 
increased. With the end of the Luriani Consolidation War in –4547, the Vilani 
banned the caravans but some had managed to escape the final defeat and 
continued their wanderings far beyond the borders of the Ziru Sirka. These 
wanderers founded the scattered Luriani worlds that can now be found far from 
Daramm (two such caravans are recorded as having reached the Zhodani 
Consulate in -4085). However a few of these escapees chose to remain 
relatively close to the former Luriani worlds and occasionally returned, 
sometimes conducting clandestine trading, sometimes encouraging an 
uprising, but mostly just looking to see if they could come home. It was these 
handful of Voyagers that would reestablish the voyaging culture during the First 
Protectorate.

The Voyagers were never as important (or common) during the First 
Protectorate as previously, but they continued to provide limited contact even 
after the Protectorate had succumbed to the Long Night. With the rise of the 
Second Protectorate steps were taken to ensure that the Voyagers were 
preserved and they flourished under official patronage. When the Second 
Protectorate was incorporated into the Imperium the Treaty of Daramm 
established the Voyagers as a protected culture, subsidised and exempted 
from many commercial regulations (including the right to carry their own unique 
transponders, identifying them as Voyagers). And they continued to survive 
throughout the Imperium.

Sendmail\'s so complicated that it\'s not just a program, it\'s a *religion*.  
However, once you get it set up, there\'s no difference between using it as an 
enterprise level mail server and a personal mail server.  The bitch is, 
getting it set up.  On the plus side, it tends to bounce stuff right back to 
you instead of making things dissappear into hyperspace when it\'s screwed up.

This is the basis I use for that strange irregularity in jump times.  A
"successful" jump can still vary by a whole day.  Time dilations errors can
reduce jump times (indicating no intervening gravity wells) and can extend it
to 10(?) days (indicating maneuvering around two or more gravity wells).

Your point is well taken, but it seems to me that if there is piracy (which
this document is trying to say), and if a world has a "significant"
economy, it is, in fact, defending its space to 100d at least, because
otherwise there is not enough trade or commerce to sustain that economy,
and there is a significant vulnerability which, sooner or later, will lead
to the downfall of that economy or the establishment of defenses like the
ones we are discussing.

In addition to trade consideration, a planet must defend it\'s region of
space to prevent one shabby TL12 free trader from holding the planet
hostage with its orbital bombardment capability (one lousy beam laser can
do significant damage to, say, the White House).  They will do this using
SDBs/fighters/orbital defenses built locally (if technologically capable)
or purchased from offworld with funds gained from interstellar trade.  This
will, at least incidentially, provide defense out to the 100d limit.

Borrowing the future from history is a fine tradition of Science Fiction in
general.  I snagged the image of Nobility from "Cheeves and Wooster"
recently with quite interesting effects (I\'ve never felt so close to having
a player actually punch me while roleplaying).  I\'m thinking next about
patterning a few events/people on characters from "The Man Who Would be
King" and Victorian India.  But that\'s in the future, so to speak.

This may be nit picking, but an anathesiologist OR a nurse anaesthetist are required, and
the later is not a doctor (while the former is).

I know this because my father is a nurse anaesthetist, has been for 30 years. And he does
just about as much as anathesiologists (in fact, he often teaches them).

Doctor in Traveller implies medical-3, right? Based on my fathers own training, medical-2
seems more appropriate - he did not have to attend med school.

I apologize if I\'m just nit-picking (since the point is that _someone_ who knows
anaethesia is present). I also apologixe for my spelling.

One of the ideas I\'m playing with is to make the Star System the focus of
the \'routine\' jump.  And, I\'m beginning to think that letting the 100d limit
strip you out of J-Space may not be a particularly healthy thing for the
J-Drive (extra wear?  Perhaps counting it in as a jump when figuring the
time between maintenance).  So a weak Astrogator (Skill 1 or 2) would aim
for the Primary Stellar System as the destination, and try to pop out short
of the limit.  A really skilled Astrogator (Skill 3+) would be able to set
up a jump for the Mainworld (Formidible Skill Roll?), but also try and come
short of the limit.  An exceptional success would indicate that the ship
precipitates from jump just short of the limit, a success roll would
indicate that it precipitates a short distance away (1d6 hours away,
assuming 1-G?) from the 100d limit.  Hmmm...maybye 1d6 per hex jumped (so a
jump-2 would be 2d6) to allow for the longer distance...  A failure of the
roll would indicate hitting the 100d point, and an exceptional failure would
me missing the system altogether (1d6 days away ?)


This would give some meaning to being a good Navigator...

There\'s training, and there\'s experience. A Traveller character can have
Medic-3 (and a doctor\'s license) right out of medical school, how does
that compare to the medical skill of a Nurse-Anesthesiologist with
a couple decades of experience? 

For MTU I put some rough labels on what to expect from levels of
medical skill - and what medical skill to expect certain people to have.

Medic-0 : Basic First Aid (Boy Scout, CPR class)
Medic-1 : Trained First Aid (Fireman, Battlefield Lifesaver Training,
               experienced Lifeguard or Police Officer), Nurse
Medic-2 : Paramedic or Surgical Assistant/Nurse Specialist
Medic-3+ : Doctor (with Dex 8+, Surgeon)

With the -2 skill LEVEL (not task) modifier for alien physiology, it takes
Medic-5 for Xeno-Medicine. ("Dammit Jim, I\'m a Doctor, not
a Vetrinarian!!")

Andy\'s father\'s _position_ would require Medic-2. His experience
and training may not have taken him above Medic-2, as there are
medical techniques he probably doesn\'t know (or at least has never
had a chance to practice). However, his experience and training have 
probably increased his Education (and perhaps his Intelligence) stat.

Let\'s say that during an operation the patient\'s body temperature
suddenly skyrockets and he starts crashing.

A Doctor, with his Medic-3, might be able to try some emergency
procedures to save the patient.

A Nurse-Anesthesiologist with a good education score would probably
recognize Malignant Hyperthermia and know exactly what to do about
it, even with "only" Medic-2. The N-A probably has the knowledge
to prevent it from becoming a problem in the first place - though the
N-A wouldn\'t consider himself qualified to do the operation.

Hmmm, nice to stumble on good examples of Skill + Stat situations...

I\'m not sure I can agree with that.  My interpretation of J-space and the
jump rules is no sensors work in J-space, and jumps tend to be straight
line.

But I\'ll think about it....

At the moment, I\'m kinda thinking that for any jump you make, roll 2 dice.
1 is for the current system, 1 is for the destination system.  If either
come up a \'1\', then that particular route is masked, and some realspace
navigation may be called for to clear the gravity well.

Have the starport supply a course.  The computer at the base should be able
to calculate the best possible course, then you just have to follow their

Oops.  I\'ve gotten so caught up in the basic idea, I forgot to tie it back
into piracy.

Assuming the destination hex is surrounded by occupied hexes (a rarity I
know, but it helps clarify what I am talking about), that would mean the the
primary solar system of the hex would have 6 distinct radials extending from
the source worlds surrounding it.

Each radial would be the \'default\' course supplied by the generate program,
unless a skilled Navigator were to alter it.  Each radial would have a
spherical are of approximately 116,640 km where one could normally expect
starships to propigate out of jumpspace - each widely separated from the
other.  And then there would be the real-space travel from the propigation
point to the mainworld.

There would also be radials coming in from the worlds J-2, J-3 ect...each
with a corresponding wider propigation point.

Additionally, for destinations that are masked by the current position of
the mainworld, there would be ships in realspace making for jump points
where they could enter J-space and not be affected by the gravity world of
the primary.

This, I think, makes the proposition of a single SDB in mainworld orbit
sufficient to prevent piracy a bit more difficult, no?

HMS Hood was overdue a docking (they built one at Rosyth - it\'ll take
two modern RN ships end-to-end); but she was still a good fast
battleship - better than; say, a Queen Elizabeth or a reworked WWI
battlecruiser for the job. PoW was new.

Well, if S & G had been handled aggressively they might have picked off
Renown - maybe without loss. Sure, they might have been damaged - but
getting a RN BC in home waters would have been a morale boost to the
Germans and a trough for the RN.

Can you provide a reference for this? Every time I\'ve seen a reference

No - it helps knock Russia out of the war. Probably more important.

Today, I can make you a reasonable armour for an APC our of aluminium;

I think I get to be embarrassed (referring to my own introduction to the
subject in the \'jump and piracy\' thread).

Can someone tell me which thread spawned this discussion so I can see just
how badly!  ;)

Maybe, but the route lead into the \'Black Curtain\' so it was never known
for sure where it went.

I think the more likely destination was Core/Core, though, since the
Doomslayer strain wanted to kill Lucan.

While I\'ve never found anything in canon to suggest this as IN policy if I
were in charge I would encourage systems to purchase standard IN BRs for
this reason. Another reason for this is that then you can \'borrow\' system
SDBs for your fleet without needing to worry about nedding special parts, etc.

I guess that depends on whether or not you count German and American

Oh yes. I find this especially irksome given the current trend (Diablo,

(compare to Ultima 7 or Ultima Underworld, for example).

A friend of mine recently commented thusly upon seeing my lunchtime
reading material (Trillion Credit Squadrons). 

" What!? Do people still do this stuff, with books and dice and
character sheets?  I figured everyone just played Quake."

I didn\'t know whether to get angry or sad. I tried to explain the social
aspect of a gaming group and how it beats shooting your coworkers into
meaty chunks via LAN QuakeII. The daily deathmatch is starting in about
45 minutes.

Unfortunately, I think most people are too lazy to make the effort to
create a character.

Oh, it\'s much more complicated that that. ;-> More below.  

As for a pre-generated flight plan, he\'s got the latest "Jump Bible",
but IMTU every jump has a hands-on component where the Astrogator has
got to use his skill to refine the lock onto the target right up to
the very last second. All a pre-generated flight plan will do for you
is put you *somewhere* at the star\'s jumplimit...unless it misses
completely. ;->

<spoiler warning for my players again...except for Craig who already
knows just how complicated this jump is>

















The ship is jumping into a binary system: Mark and Segui. They want to
jump as close to the mainworld around Mark as possible to limit travel
time (delicate cargo, timed contract), but the mainworld is masked by
Mark. And Segui is just beginning to occlude Mark itself making things
even more difficult.  It looks something like this...they are at K and
want to jump to P, M is Mark, S is Segui and G is an gas giant
orbiting Mark... (best viewed with a monospaced font, and *not* to
scale)


           K



              S
              
             
        G   M
             P

The astrogator has three options. 

He can try the Formidable task of "threading the needle" past Segui\'s
jumplimit and hit Mark\'s jumplimit as near to the planet as possible.
If he makes it, the travel time will be minimized. If he fails badly
enough the ship could end up at Segui\'s jumplimit and have to refuel
there before jumping to Mark (lost time and money)...and he didn\'t do
to well on the last *Routine* jump. ;->

He can attempt a Routine Jump to Mark\'s jumplimit, avoiding a near
approach to Segui, with very little chance of failure, but the ship
will have to travel all the way around Mark to reach the planet. This
will take about two extra days, but is safest.

He can make a Routine jump to the inner jumplimit of gas giant G and
cut the time down to only an extra day, but there is a complication.
This gas giant is restricted by the Mark Navy (they have a base there)
and if he jumps *too* close the ship could be subject to fines and
will, unquestionably, be stopped and searched by a patrol ship. Does
the ship\'s Captain want to risk his ship being searched?

Folks, I\'ve always used the jump-masking idea and *never* like to
allow a ship to jump directly to with shooting range of an inner
system system planet. IMTU, that *can* happen, but only rarely.  The
situation is more often similar to this one. Well, I admit this one is
a little more complicated than most. ;->

First of all, I have to say that I haven\'t developed the Krraaang! in
detail yet, which is why I was asking the list about possiblities. :-)

To answer your first question, I considered Virus psionic because I had a
hard time believing in a real-world piece of software that had the
properties ascribed to Virus, even given the unusual nature of Cyberlime
chips. It is my impression that this was a *huge* flamewar subject on this
list at one time, and I don\'t want to get into that. Lets just say that
IMTU, it seemed to me the best answer. Virus is a psionic phenomena,
allowing infected systems to "possess" other electronic systems.

The reason I don\'t think the Krraaang! would be infected by Virus, assuming
its a physical phenomena, is the same as why I think it unlikely that a
human would be infected by a alien microbe. Or that a programmer could
crash the alien invader starship\'s computer with his Powerbook, for that
matter! :-) Different biologies, different technologies.

As for creation, I think I mentioned reading a short story once about the
end of the human race. They had reached the pinnacle of achievement, been
everywhere and done everything, got bored, and left the universe to their
artificial companions. I look them as being the children of another Ancient
race. IMTU, space outside of that known by the Imperium teems with life,
much of it spacefaring, and much of it older than Grandfather and his
children. (David Brin\'s Startide Rising was one of my favorite novels).

Very true. It is a shortcoming (a minor one, IMHO) of the skill system - the skills are
too broad. Now, I don\'t advocate more skills - for game purposes the number is just about
right.

I\'ve toyed with the idea of specialization in my campaigns. A given engineer might have
Jump Engineering-3 but Maneuver Engineering-1. Its done with weapons, of course. There
could certainly be other breakdowns. 

For example, I would definately place my father at Medical:Anethesia-3 or 4, he\'s been
doing it for quite some time, he lectures others on it, and is considered an expert by his
peers (actually, he\'s speaking at a conference on the subject this week). However, his
general medical/surgical knowledge is probibly rated a 2.

But this is probibly too much detail for the medical skill.

Without specialization, this would be a very good way of describing it, I suppose. 

My point to this whole thing was simply to note that I think Medical-3 is a level too high
for the anethesia requirement of trauma recovery. Especially considering your excellent
table above, I would say a Medical-2 anethetist is a Nurse Anth., while a Medical-3 would
be a anethesiologist. Both would be acceptable for surgery, and would excel for most
normal procedures. The doctor simply has more skill, and thus will be able to react better
to a crisis.

Again, sorry if this is being nit-picky. And I apologize for my spelling, even though my
father is one, I can never remember how to spell all of the anethesia terms/titles...

The notion of an "old and bold" pirate is unlikely (especially IMTU).
 I think pirates certainly exist, but (like the historical pirates)
tend to be either disbanded or destroyed fairly quickly (many on the
first or second prize they attempt).  If you take a look at US
criminals (ok, so they aren\'t exactly pirates) they tend to have a
lower IQ than the general population.  That\'s why there are so many
"dumb criminal" stories (at least enough for a 0.5 hr weekly show in
the US).  There are smart criminals, but they are few, and even they
tend to be caught eventually.  There are pirates currently (1998), but
the majority are in the Malay Archipelago.  Their mode of operation is
to zoom out of a coastal (island) hiding place in a speedboat and then
board ships passing through the narrow passages between islands.  This
only works because there are navigational bottlenecks (which require
slow speed maneuvering) they can prey on that have enough hiding
places and support from local population.  Anti-piracy operations in
that area are hindered by the many hiding places and people who don\'t
want to tell on thier family/friends/neighbors.  Many ships that pass
through that area have taken to carrying a certain amount of weaponry
in their ship\'s locker to repel such boarders (which gets put away
when going to major ports).
So anyway, IMTU there are people dumb enough to think they can get
away with piracy.  Some of them even manage to make a living at it for
a short while (there might be one pirate of the "Dread Pirate Roberts"
level in the whole 3I), but many are gone after the first or second
attempt at it.  Of course, there are a fair number of dumb people out
there...
I agree that the IN would use anti-piracy sweeps as a training
ground.  I also think that there would be basically zero purpose built
pirate vessels, with most being converted traders of one sort or
another, with a (very small) scattering of mutinied military ships.

There is some canonic uncertainty in the exit point.  I don\'t remember what
it is, but it isn\'t that big (a few tens of thousands of km) and, given
interstellar
distances, still represents pretty precise navigation.

I point I\'m made, which isn\'t canonical in itself but is derived from it,
is that there is a variation of about a day in when you come out.  There will
be some motion of the star system and of the planet in the orbit during
this period.  If we take 50 km/s as a typical value for all combined (IIRC
that is reasonable), you could end up 4 million km away form where
you intended...

Reading the star blocking the route to the planet.

I don\'t like the idea that you can be affected by mass on your route to your
exit point.  This implies that somehow jump space maps to regular
space and you do travel faster than the speed of light while you are there.

For me the point of jump space was to get around relativity in that you never
travel faster than the speed of light, you just stop out of the universe at
one point and step back in at another (And that is why it always takes a
week, it takes that long to transition to jumps space and back, otherwise,
why if you are travelling in a jump space that maps to regular space, why
wouldn\'t it take longer to travel further?)

Otherwise, the only other point is that the odds will be low that the star
will be in the way, but it could cause you to need to come out of jumps
space some distance away from the planet.

I would, too. However I\'m sure that with the offer of some of the work

the In, etc, etc the politicians who control the system defence

I\'m not sure drifting in is the tactical way to go.

Drifting in has the problem that if you are picked up, then you wont be
dodging when the incoming fire arrives.

Going in all full power, maneuvering and being lit up like a Christmas tree
might be a better idea. A battlecruiser with weapons that go out to 500
000km and no need to actually match velocities with targets to capture them
could do quite a bit of havoc while dancing away from planet-based
light-lagged fire at about 3 light seconds (gives 6 seconds evasion from
planet-based fire, which turns into a zone of uncertainty of about a
kilometer at 5 gees acceleration). 900 kkm out with 500 kkm range weapons
will cover a fair chunk of a 800 000 km sphere.

Approach tactics would be dictated by the expected opposition. If the
raider is deep enough behind enemy lines, then drifting into the convoy and
ambushing would likely be the tactic of choice. If opposition is expected,
and if the raiding force is large enough, then lighting up and charging in
would be most effective.

Prudent commanders using the low power tactics would have an idea of the
expected enemy strength in the area before they enter the area anyway. If
they didn\'t, then the whole endeavor is likely doomed anyway. Fortunate
commanders may even have some small craft to conduct scouting.

  It could be an oversight (it isn\'t that important, overall), it could be
leaving something to the individual refs discretion, or it could be policy
(c\'mon, rams were popular after Lissa, and it took everyone a long time to
realize that the "own goals" were getting out of hand - policy doesn\'t have

But it DOESN\'T take a week.  A successful jump is 6 to 8 days.  If you drop out
of the universe and pop back in and the physical universe has no affect on you in
jump space, there should be NO variation in time ESPECIALLY if you repeat the
process.

This is actually a smaller problem for system defense plotters than ships
randomly falling out along the surface of a 100 diameter limit mainworld
sphere.

Six small 100 000km spheres are easier to cover than one big 800 000km sphere.

Piaracy of ships going to and from the mainworld is made more difficult by
needing to match velocities with them after they have had a long time to
accelerate - a maerchant ship may not be able to stop in order to stand and
deliver ...

  Invincible & Inflexible detached from the Grand Fleet in late `14 to

  By Striker, composites are a higher TL replacement; aluminum is a fairly
special purpose alternative to other armour plate compositions, IIRC. The
issue of differing steels should be attributed to limitations in the TL
scaling system forced by playability considerations. Also, nothing yet has
offered an explanation for the increasing marginal cost of armour protection
given the representation of increased armour factors as increased quantity
of a given armour material.

Theory...

The jump you are performing is a method of traveling through 4 dimentional
space. You are not only traveling through physical space but also through
the temporal part of it as well. However, the physics of jump travel at TL
9 through x prevent accurate control of the 4th dimentional element, so one
jump takes around 7 days, give or take a day.

Perhaps at a tech level past x, accurate control of the 4th dimention in
jump will be possible, permitting limited forward and backward movement,
first by reducing the time in jump, then making them require no time, then
actually allowing for time travel.

Ian Ferguson emailed me about the CNO cycle in the mistaken belief that,
since I work at MIT\'s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, I kknow more than
squat about Fusion.

To set the record straight, I\'m an administrator with some healthy interest
in the science, but without the background or retention capability to
explain anything in more than vague terms.  So like any good \'netizen, I
referred the question to my friend Rob Nachtrieb, a Grad Student and
one-time Traveller player.

This is what he wrote, specifically giving permission to post it here.  I
thought it was a good idea.

- ----Begin Long Technical Fusion Process Discussion----

Hi Ian,

Peter Brenton forwarded your question to me, and I\'ll try to give a
lucid response.  Please feel free to post this to your Traveller\'s
list if you think it would be interesting.  Most of this information
is available in Krane, _Introductory Nuclear Physics_, Wiley, 1988,
pp. 534-538.

Yes, the CNO cycle for fusion is real.  Here\'s how it works.

First, some notation.  The element hydrogen is represented with the
symbol H, helium with He, lithium with Li, boron with B, berylium with
Be, carbon with C, nitrogen with N, oxygen with O, and so forth.
Isotopes of an element are labelled by their mass number, written
before the element symbol.  Hydrogen has three isotopes: 1H, 2H, 3H;
1H is called "protium", and is sometimes referred to with the label p;
2H is called "deuterium" and is sometimes referred to with the label
D; 3H is called "tritium and is sometimes referred to with the label
T.  An eV ("electron-volt") is a unit of energy; chemical reactions
release energy of order a few eV.  An MeV is a unit of energy equal to
a million eV; nuclear reactions release energy of order a few MeV.

Consider the situation when ordinary hydrogen, 1H, is the dominant
species present.  If the temperature of the hydrogen is high enough,
say around 15 million Kelvin, then the probability of thermonuclear
fusion reactions starts to become relatively high.  Specifically, the
following chain of reactions becomes possible:

(1)	1H + 1H --> 2H + positron + neutrino + 1.44 MeV,
(2)	2H + 1H --> 3He + gamma + 5.49 MeV,
(3)	3He + 3He --> 4He + 2 1H + gamma + 12.86 MeV,

which can be combined to form the net reaction

(4)	4 1H --> 4He + 2 positron + 2 neutrino + 26.7 MeV

Reaction (4) is known as the proton-proton cycle (p-p).

Some reactions are possible, but not likely if 1H is the dominant
species.  For instance, if the only source of deuterium is from
reaction (1), then while a 2H + 2H (or DD) reaction is possible it is
improbable.  Other reactions are just plain impossible, for instance
3He + 1H --> 4Li, since 4Li does not exist as a bound system and would
immediately split to form 3He and 1H.

For completeness it is worth mentioning that there are other ways one
could arrive at the p-p cycle, specifically,

	3He + 4He --> 7Be + gamma,
	7Be + electron --> 7Li + neutrino,
	7Li + 1H --> 2 4He,
or
	7Be + 1H --> 8B + gamma,
	8B --> 8Be + positron + neutrino,
	8Be --> 2 4He.

Which path is taken depends on the composition and temperature of the
fuel and the temperature.  In any case, the net reaction and energy
release is still described by (4).

Why is the p-p cycle important?  Because 1H is the most abundant
isotope in the universe, around 90%.  If one is travelling the
universe presumably one needs fuel to get around, and its a good bet
that 1H will be there for you.

The p-p cycle is also important because it is how heavier elements are
made in stars.

So what\'s wrong with the p-p cycle as described above?  Well, it\'s
slow.  The rate at which the full p-p reaction proceeds depends on the
rates of the individual reactions in the chain, and it turns out that
the deuterium reaction is slower than all the other reactions in the
chain.  The deuterium reaction is the "bottleneck."

If we now relax the condition above that 1H is the dominant species
and allow the presence of a significant amount of carbon, then the
following reactions are possible:

(5)	12C + 1H --> 13N + gamma,
(6)	13N --> 13C + positron + neutrino,
(7)	13C + 1H --> 14N + gamma,
(8)	14N + 1H --> 15O + gamma,
(9)	15O --> 15N + positron + neutrino,
(10)	15N + 1H --> 12C + 4He.

Reactions (5) through (10) together are known as the CNO cycle.  If
you add up the reactions in the CNO cycle you get (4) again.  You can
see that there is no net creation or destruction of 12C; the 12C acts
as a catalyst.  The CNO cycle takes protium (1H) and makes helium
(4He) and energy (26.7 MeV), but the net reaction proceeds much faster
than the p-p cycle since it bypasses the bottleneck deuterium reaction
(1).

In general the CNO cycle requires higher temperatures than the p-p
cycle, but you get more power per unit mass of fuel.  One may compare
the output power per unit fuel mass of the CNO and p-p cycles as a
function of temperature.  At about 15 million Kelvin they are about
the same at 1 milliwatt/kg of fuel (reactor mass not included).  But
at a relatively modest increase in temperature to 50 million Kelvin,
CNO puts out around 1 megawatt/kg of fuel while p-p puts out just 10
milliwatts/kg of fuel; CNO beats p-p by a factor of 10^8.  One can see
the advantage of the CNO cycle if 1H is your fuel.  To put this in
context, Earth\'s star puts out around 0.2 milliwatts/kg and has a core
temperature of around 15 million Kelvin.

Note that other reactions are possible that occur at much faster rates
than either the p-p cycle or the CNO cycle.  Specifically, if you had
plenty of deuterium and tritium and you had a way of heating it to
about 100 million Kelvin, then the reaction

(11)	2H + 3H --> 4He + neutron + 3.5 MeV

proceeds about 10^26 times faster than the p-p cycle (for the same
fuel temperature and density).  In fact this is the fusion reaction,
called DT, that we\'re trying to get going first on Earth, because
seawater contains plenty of deuterium and we can "breed" tritium via

	6Li + neutron --> 3H + 3He + 4.78 MeV.

If you only have deuterium, you\'re still in business because the
DD and D-3He reactions,

	2H + 2H --> 3He + neutron + 3.3 MeV,
	2H + 2H --> 3H + 1H + 4.0 MeV,
	2H + 3He --> 4He + 1H + 18.3 MeV,

all proceed only 10 times slower than DT at 100 million Kelvin and the
same fuel densities.

I hope this answers your question!

Rob Nachtrieb

Actually, surgery at TL 0 includes such things as trephining (would you
believe *brain* surgery!). You see, TL 0 cutting implements are
*inherently* sterile until they\'ve been used. And since they are also
*sharpest* when freshly made (freshly chipped from flint), they wind up
using sterile instruments "naturally". 

Weird but true.

AHL\'s are described as different because they are one of the few ships

A 60,000tn, spinal-mount equipped warship is _not_ considered a
capital ship, it\'s a fleet auxiliary (in this case, an intruder).

Could it be that AHL isn\'t a "capital" ship because of it\'s mission
(independent ops), rather than it\'s size or armament?

Or would this reading indicate that only Battlecruisers and above are
considered capital ships, and that cruisers are not?

Random Comment on Jump Space:  The reason that jumps take 6 to 8 days 
may not be due to the fact that the physical universe imparts some 
effect on the Jump Space sub-structure, but that the Jump Space 
sub-structure that Traveller vessels move through are not congruent 
temporally with our physical universe, and thus a new calculation 
must be made every time to plot through the variations in the 
universal sub-structure (and other pseudo-science techno-babble) to 
fold the ship into jump space and back out.  Such variations cause 
the differences in Jump Space between two points on a constant basis, 
and thus no two ships entering Jump Space under nearly identical 
conditions take the exact same time to travel to the same place.  
(This is how I justify the game mechanic IMTU.  Hope it helps.)

Thanks again for your time.

My solution would be to have the geneal skill and let the player pick a
specilization. They then either get a bonus in the specialty area, or have
a penalty outside it. The Babylon Project does it the first way, Space
1889 the second. Either works as long as you are consistent.

the light pollution was negligible....  

I was struck again at how vast the stars are, and how small we are.

How about some kind of formal \'debate\' (via e-mail or onlist whatever folk
want) that could then maybe be put up on a web site (how about Jeff\'s
Freelance Traveller for example?).  Newbies could read the main arguments;
those who wish to talk about finer points would have a base to refer to
etc.  Who knows, perhaps Andy Lilly could even be persuaded to publish it!

I haven\'t spent much time thinking about the \'rules\' but something along
the lines of the following (which could of course be changed if people
want):

You\'d need a formal proposal to \'debate\' along the lines of:
In the opinion of this mailing list piracy isn\'t economic in the Traveller
universe.

Someone (or a group of people with a nominated \'spokesman\') would argue FOR
the motion in not more than 1000 words with, say, two tables allowed to be
included.  Paragraphs to be numbered for ease of reference.  Citations of
books to be included within the 1000 words.

Someone (or a group of people with a nominated \'spokesman\') would argue
AGAINST the motion in not more than 1000 words with, say, two tables
allowed to be included.  Paragraphs to be numbered for ease of reference.
Citations of books to be included within the 1000 words.

A referee receives both documents and then mails them to everyone
interested (or the mailing list if the list\'s happy with that) for a second
round of rebuttals.  These would be again 1000 words maximum responding to
points made by the \'opponents\'.

A third round would give a final chance to respond to the rebuttals and
\'conclude\' and again be limited to, say, 1000 words.

The referee could edit the document for grammar/puncutation/spelling etc.
Thus we\'d end up with some 6000 words on the subject in, hopefully, a
fairly coherent form that would contain the main for and against arguments.


I\'m willing to referee unless someone else wants to.  So are there any
takers to take one side or the other?  (Interestingly enough, if groups of
people submit their contributions to their spokesman, there\'s no actual
reason why people couldn\'t argue on *both* sides of the debate!)

Anyone think this would work/be useful?

You misunderstood my meaning - it takes an experienced and talented
astrogator to plot a course direct to the mainworld.  The default radials
lead to the *stellar* 100d limit, the 6 would be scattered around the
diameter of the system *primary*, not the mainworld.

Additionally, those systems with a companion may very well interrupt one or
more of the radials leading to the mainworld...  hmmm...

There is a better way. PC compatable computers have a free running clock
that can be accessed using basic IO calls. I believe this clock can be
accessed at IO address 40h but if you need this address ask and I\'ll
confirm it.

By fetching a number from this clock at periodic intervals, you can in
essence grab more or less random numbers for use as a seed number. Either
grab a number at the beginning of the code segment that needs a random
sequence, or grab a seed each time you need a number.

Actually it isn\'t a singular request. I\'m working on converting my T4 game
into HERO right now.

My rough idea is to let the PCs have points in a skill equal to their
level under t4.  So a T4 character with Stealth-2, would get 2 points to
spend on Stealth skill under HERO (11-). Obviously there will be a fudge
factor, but this is my basic plan. Also I will give them a number of
points to spend on \'character skills\' - i.e. hobbies, knowledge skills,
area knowledges, and such skills that are devoted primarily to fleshing
out the character.

Let me know if you get any brilliant ideas!  :)

Gravity effects on J-Space have been around since the LBBs.  I\'m not sure
where (it\'s been a while since I\'ve cracked the basic 3), but I believe it
was originally in the subsector generation text, there was a paragraph about
placing black holes in empty hexes, and the fact that it would drag a ship
from J-Space.

Then, there is the effect of the 100d limit forcing a ship to revert to
realspace.

IMTU, only the strongest of gravity wells (i.e. blackhole) can drag a ship
out of J-space once the J-field stabilizes.  Only at the very beginning
(while the field is still stabilizing) and end (when it has attenuated to a
fraction of it\'s original strength) can gravity affect it.  Which is why
jumping from within a gravity well causes misjumps (distortion of the
J-Field) and why ships propogate out of jump at the 100d mark at the end of
their jump, but can essentially jump "over" systems using a higher rated
J-drive.

Of course, all this *is* IMTU rules...  ;^)

That\'s scary.

IMTU, the time variation is based on the individual J-drive, harmonics in
the J-field (set up by irregularities and damage to the Lanthanum grid) and
the specific gravity fields present when the jump is set up.  Because these
are *measurable* and, with a skilled enough engineer, to some extent
controllable (or compensatable), ships with the appropriate Generation
software can perform coordinated Jumps.

The best place I have ever seen for viewing the Milky Way is on the road
to Puerto Penasco in Mexico, in the middle of the ___ Pincante (sp)
Wilderness Area.  You\'re about 45 miles from _any_ civilization, the
humidity is very low (no haze) and once your eyes adapt to the dark
you\'re treated to a glorious multicolored light filled band across the
sky. Incredible!!!

We had trouble making out the common constellations because we could see
too _many_ stars...

Gives you a great appreciation for what our distant ancestors viewed in
the skies every night...

My favorite spot; Chebeague (pronounced She-big) Island Maine, on Casco
Bay, where there are maybe a dozen streetlights on the whole (4mi. x 1mi.)
island, the nearest "city" (Portland) is 12 miles down the coast, and the
residents tend to go to bed at 8pm.  Pollution is nonexistent, traffic
likewise.

It\'s especially nice in mid-February, when the air temp drops below 20F (-8
or so C I think) and the stillness is overwhelming.  I can remember once
noticing the *reflection* of starlight on a frozen snowfield, and moonlight
can be blinding.  Chilly, but quite moving.

Ah, memories.



By the way, visiting that place was just like visiting a world 2-3 tech
levels behind; all TL 4+ items were imported at considerable cost, were
purchased for their ease of local maintanence, and were maintained well
beyond their typical useful life.  My Uncle who lives there has a 30s era
tractor that he keeps re-reparing with scavenged and improvised parts.  You
as likely to see a 1950 International Scout as a 1995 Jeep Cherokee.

I saw a show on the Discovery channel where some ancient skulls showed
evidence of multiple (IIRC at least 3) surgeries where the patient survived
them all.  They were showing the cuts, mostly rectangular/square, and how
healing was apparent around the edges of the "holes", with some of the holes
"obviuously" (to them anyway) older than others.  Quite enlightening!!!!

Well, of course.  The point was that it doesn\'t correlate with distance.
If you do a microjump the average time is the same as if you do a jump
6.

Maybe, but the route lead into the \'Black Curtain\' so it was never known

for sure where it went.

I think the more likely destination was Core/Core, though, since the
Doomslayer strain wanted to kill Lucan.

I thought that that was just the "evangalcal Doomslayer " variant. Not
all Viruses were infected with this - the others just had a sort of
vague feeling that they\'d like to kill him - not a compulsion.

Maybe the "Evangalcal Doomslayers" continue on from Celetron to Capital
and the others just can\'t be bothered? ( a sort of  Vampire Bypass?? )

\'conclude\' and again be limited to, say, 1000 words.

The referee could edit the document for grammar/puncutation/spelling etc.
Thus we\'d end up with some 6000 words on the subject in, hopefully, a
fairly coherent form that would contain the main for and against arguments.


I\'m willing to referee unless someone else wants to.  So are there any
takers to take one side or the other?  (Interestingly enough, if groups of
people submit their contributions to their spokesman, there\'s no actual
reason why people couldn\'t argue on *both* sides of the debate!)

Sounds like a good suggestion to me. A really "sound" idea. (Slight pun

advocacy FOR Piracy if there are no other brave souls ready to jump on it.

I just dug out ALL my Traveller books (GDW, Fasa, GDP, Judges Guild, IG,
Seeker, SoK, etc.) which is roughly 90%+/- of all PUBLISHED canon material.
I got my engine running and I\'m ready to start researching now.

Actually, there is room for both theorem, just increases the number of
variables involved in making a jump. Even more scary.

The point isn\'t that Gravity affects Jump Space.  The point is
that a Jump isn\'t traveller through a space where you can draw
a corresponding line in normal space to show your course.  (In
fact, my interpretation is that you don\'t "travel" through jump
space at all).

This doesn\'t mean you can\'t misjump (or whatever) if you try and
jump (or come out of jump) too close to a body.

Stars condense out of framgents inside dense molecular clouds of cold
gas. The process is poorly understood, but takes a long time (roughly,
the steps are 
(1) Cloud of gas breaking apart into gragments
(2) Fragments begin to collapse
(3) Collapsed framgents heat up and become protostars
(4) Collapsing material concentrates in an accretion disk; object becoms
a T Tauri star
(5) gas flows *out* from the poles of the star while continuing to flow *in*
from the disk
(6) Gas outflow blows away the rest of the fragment, halting inflow of gas
except for the little bit left in the disk
(7) Planets form in the disk.

The nearest big star forming region is the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud, about
100-150 pc from Earth. With a little distortion, you could assume that
Dark Nebula sector represents this... Does anyone have any other suggestions?
The nerest heavy-duty big-star region (Orion) is outside of Charted Space.
There will also be quite a few isolated youngish stars that stillr etain
their disks inside Imperial space, too. (Great places for pirates to hide -
the dense dust in the disk really cuts down sensor ranges. Possibly full of
interesting interstellar organics, exotic leftover post-supernova elements,
etc...)

Sorry for the length, I\'ve only just worked out how to get mail onto the
list - your _source address_ has to be subscribed! (as opposed to forwarded
to another location - doh!).

Most of these are replies to old threads, that never made it to the TML.

1. Medicine in Traveller 2: Trauma

Andy Akins said:

>I\'ve toyed with the idea of specialization in my campaigns. A given
engineer might have
>Jump Engineering-3 but Maneuver Engineering-1. Its done with weapons, of
course. There
>could certainly be other breakdowns.

Interestingly, there was a JTAS article on the Imperial Academy of Science
and Medicine that addressed this topic, creating a specialisation breakdown
of the Medical and other Science skills.

For example, I created a guy called Ivan Brunel, a starport designer with
skill-4 (sorry, I can\'t remember the exact skill name; Macro Engineering or
something), to be the designer of Beowulf Down.

"Hokay, comradski, just vere do you vant dat Scout base again?" ;-)

2. Deckplans (old thread)

Marc has stated (in various places, including JTAS#25) that he always
spreads accomodation areas around the rest of the ship, for things such as
circulation space, kitchens, etc. His staterooms are not necessarily
*exactly* 4 tons, and his bridges are not generally the HG size either.
However, the *total* area should be within 10-20% for the floorplan to be
considered OK.

BTW, the "Empress Marava"-class in "Traders & Gunboats" is NO-WHERE near
this 10-20% rule-of-thumb. The deckplans show the ship to be DOUBLE the
size it is supposed to be.

3. Metric vs Imperial

Just to add my Cr0.02 to the debate, I have to agree (partly) with Phil. I
still think in feet/inches and stones/pounds for *people*. My wife doesn\'t,
 being brought up under metric - but even she compares the weights of
babies in pounds. I think it comes down to what you have as a comparison -
I converted to km\'s for distance once I realised that 130 mi
Bathurst-Sydney was 200km. That gave me a comparative measure. For example,
 Bathurst-Canberra is 270km (although took the same 3 hrs to drive; that\'s
Sydney traffic for you!)

On a different measurement problem - *boy* was it a pain when my
organisation changed its cheque stationery! We had to use imperial units
for the cheques (since they are printed on printers made in the USA) while
still conforming to Australia Post\'s metric requirements for the position
of the address on envelopes, then make sure the window-face of the
manufactured window-face envelopes was positioned correctly. Finally, after
we decided to make the cheques two print-lines longer, we found out that
the drums that printed the older continuous blank cheque stationery were
exactly 3" around. Since the next size up actually made the cheques FOUR
lines longer, we had to modify our program again to allow for the extra
length...

Suffice it to say, I *really* appreciated Phil\'s article in "Dark Star #1"
about equipment incompatabilities.  ;-)

4. Disturbing Anti-Democratic Trends in Traveller...

Walter said:
>I saw Weber\'s take on the scariest thing that can happen to a
>democracy: what happens when the mob realizes they can get more
>bread and circuses just by voting for it.

Correct. This is why (forex) the Australian federal system has two Houses;
the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House or
House of Review). The Prime Minister, BTW, is the leader of the majority
party in the House of Reps. Bills have to pass two Readings in each House
(with amendments made as part of the process) before they can be sent to
the Governor-General (for ratification) and become law.

ObTravRef: Tavonni\'s Constitution was _roughly_ modelled along these lines
- - with the Count replacing the G-G!  ;-)

The whole idea of the two Houses is to SLOW DOWN the business of
government. While (as Phil pointed out) technology may make participative
democracy possible, is is not necessarily *desirable*. The average citizen
(including me) is not sufficiently informed enough to come to a decision on
ALL matters of law - for that matter, neither are many politicians, but at
least the law-making process is slowed down to allow many people time to
review, lobby, and amend the law.

Unless properly controlled, participative democracy *is* known as "mob
rule".

Aerron said:
>why compulsory voting?  you don\'t even have
>the freedom to *not* vote...how is that more \'democratic\'?

Actually, if you don\'t want to pick someone, you can cast an "informal"
vote - put in a blank voting form, or draw a box marked "None of the above"
and tick it, etc, etc.

As for the "donkey vote" (1-2-3-4-5 down the page), if you look at how the
voting actually went (http://www.aec.gov.au/), you can see that people here
generally make more of a rational choice than that. BTW, there are options
to even out the donkey vote, such as Robson\'s Rotation used in the ACT
(Canberra) and Tasmanian elections: randomly print the candidates names on
the ballot papers. The only drawbacks are (1) that it makes it hard for
parties to draw up "How To Vote" cards - not that they are allowed with
100m of a Robson\'s Rotation polling place anyway - and (2) that it makes
the counting more difficult.

I\'m afraid I\'m a fan of compulsory voting in the Real World, because I
believe that non-comp voting makes it easier to stack a result - witness
the 1968 (?) UK election...

ObTravRef: ...which is why the Count insisted on non-compulsory elections
on Tavonni (come and read about it in full, but basically the military are
allowed leave to vote, and are presented with a targetted campaign and "How
To Vote" cards as they go... ;-).



Now all THAT\'S off my chest, I\'ll go back to sleep again... zzzzz. Oh! now
I have to get back on the \'net and update my Jump Points page... and the
Library Data... and re-write Tavonni for G:T... a ref\'s work is never
done...

Yes.  I just picked up a copy (at Dream Wizards in Rockville, Md).  
At first I was skeptical.  But now that I\'ve had some time to look it
over I\'ve found an abundance of fascinating story lines.  My favorite
thus far, on page 126 under Droyne of Andor, "a new \'leader of leaders\'
named Muodray (Little Father) has appeared."  There\'s more about him,
but I don\'t want to spoil your fun.  ;)

My compliments to the authors!  A bang-up job if ever there was one!

 the best places I have viewed the stars are approx. 15 N by 180 W  and
McDonnald Observatory in West Texas.  although I would like to see a

Why should you be surprised by this?  MTG has a *ton* of young followers in the
demographics that ESPN is shooting for.  Add that to the mass marketting
campaign they were running earlier this year and you have an instant audience
to sell advertising time for.

My best spot to see the Milky Way:  The middle of the Nebraska prairie
in late December.  The Milky Way comes up after midnight.

I was going to add some technical stuff for the original thread of
how many stars are forming in the Milky Way and the 3I, but I think
Bruce Macintosh\'s email covered it pretty well.

The thing I don\'t get here is why everyone seems so mad about it. Big deal,
there\'s Magic tournaments and Magic is covered in Sports Illustrated.

Obviously, at least to some extent people are interested in it, which is not
a bad thing at all.

In my direct area, there are two comic book stores that double as RPG
suppliers. One of them, although well intentioned, never has anything in but
AD&D stuff (and very little of that), Vampire stuff and sometimes a few
other odd items, recently some Deadlands products and mech type stuff,
previously Call of Cthulhu. This place makes almost all of its money on
comics though, and has never really had a really good stock of games.

The other place has always tried to keep a good amount of RPGs in stock, and
has always tried to be cool with people coming in and reading. Before CCGs
came around they had little, but they tried. Mostly, what turned over a
decent profit for them was Warhammer stuff. Anyway, to make a long story
short, CCGs allowed them to bankroll a wider stock of RPGs. They even were
able to carry T4, even after other RPG places gave up on it. Nowadays, they
have a much wider stock of GURPS stuff, new RPGs, hard to find RPGs, all
kinds of RPGs.

More business for the gaming shops is never a bad thing.

The problem with the whole Piracy debate is that to solve it, you need to
peel back the assumptions that the rules dont state, and in some cases dont
even imply. Which specific rules you use is also important in some cases
(eg Bruce Macintosh\'s Definitive Senosr Rules make life easier in many ways
for system defense planners  ... \'We\'re being attacked by a relic from a
previous rules system\'), as is your views on how much IN is there, where do
they hang out and what do they do when they arent beating on the Zhodani,
Solomani et al.

Things like \'How much interstellar trade does a world create, and whats it
worth ?\' arent in canon, and some of the stuff that is (eg starship
maintainence costs for civilian shipping) leads to ahhh interesting results.

We also dont have a lot of data on what fixed planetary defenses there are,
and how effective they are.

The point of the Sunbeard Declaration was to get things resolved in a way
that would keep everyone happy, and allow piracy. 

Does anyone actually disagree with anything in it ?

Another good book to get, for _all_ sorts of useful physical and
chemical trivia is any edition of the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics,
by the Chemical Rubber Corporation. Dunno what it sells for new anymore,
but you can often find it in used bookstores, particularly technical
ones or university bookstores.

Much of the information is geared toward chemists, but there are
sections, for instance, on planetary composition: For instance Terra is,
as Douglas wrote, 5.52 gm/cc. Venus is close, at 5.16, Mars is
considerably lighter at 3.95, while Saturn is the least dense in the
solar system at 0.69 g/cc. My treasured 42nd Edition, pub 1960-61 also
has a host of useful recipes in it, for things like high vaccum grease,
mirrors, photographic reagents, adhesives and the like.

Sadly, this section was dropped sometime between that edition and the
one I got in College, the 61st, but that one has vastly more planetary
information.

I do know that I got my 61st ed. as a special deal for students for
something like $19 (but this was in 1980).

Besides, it looks really impressive on your bookshelf, and makes for the
near-c book o\' doom if you drop it on a bug. ;-)

Subject: Dumb Gurps Traveller question

  So, my question is this:  With GURPS TRAVELLER turns representing 20
minute turns, is there any reason we can\'t couple a Scan 43 ASEA with a
Complexity 11 Expert program, that grants a +9 to the operator\'s skill
with Sensors?  Granted, it costs 1.28 MCr to have, not including the cost
of the computer itself, but a +9 to effect Scan rating is nothing to be
unhappy with...
  Comments?
*************
no problem with it, just remember that if the modifiers + scan (before the
computer) are -10 or less there is no chance to detect. this means that a
skill 12 operator with that program will have a 12 or less to detect if he
can detect at all.

I really have no problem with it, but I would say that yuou have to be in
the system for an hour for each +1 so it can build a database to filter out
background noise.

Six \'other\' crew members?

I do appreciate that Mr Glenn deserves this trip in the latest model

have even been run. I salute all the aviators wishing to climb to those

I just think that the astronauts should all be acknowledged for their

I think it was a general enough framework to go with, pretty much

I think one reason we keep seeing the piracy debate is because of the
assumptions Ian mentioned. IMO, few of the "continuous debates"
cause referees to think about the basic assumptions of their own
campaign environment like the Piracy Debate. 

Some examples of the kind of questions every ref may need to answer,
that the piracy debate works on (directly or indirectly):

1> How can my PC\'s sneak into a star system?

2> What ships are in a star system to chase my PC\'s out of it?

3> If my PC\'s do something illegal with their starship, how likely are
     they to be tracked down later?

4> How can my PC\'s steal a starship?

5> How can my PC\'s sell illegal/smuggled goods?

6> How dangerous to my PC\'s are different parts of a star system?

7> What different parts of a star system will my PC\'s jump to or from,
     and why?

8> What are the alternatives to regular stops at a starport for resupply
     and maintenance for my PC\'s?

I could go on a lot longer - sensors, valuables carried by star travellers,
how big fleets are, etc, etc...but I think the point is made.

\'tis in the discussion such things are worked out. Formalized debate
would be interesting, but I don\'t think the subject can be once-and-for-all
settled this way.

I remember stopping by the side of the road on the island of Cyprus, in
the Mediterranean Sea.  We were driving from Nicosia to Larnaca (pre \'74
invasion) and just were overwhelmed.  There was nothing in that 50 mile
stretch of road, and the cities at either end were not much as far
cities go (much has changed since then).  We were looking for Khouhotek
(sp?) but never saw it.  Stars and "shooting stars" were imprinted in my
mind.

Repeat of questions:  How long does it take a star to form, and are any
forming in the 3I?  And what impact would that have if any?

Pete, this makes me think of a colony world almost, where development
continues, but people hold on to what they have.  New stuff is there but
prohibitively expensive.  Another interesting thing about Cyprus was the
old women, hunched over, wearing black, walking through the villages on
the dirt streets with 2-litre bottles of Coke in their hands. 
Definitely a step back in TL....  One or two phones per village, and a
very slow pace of life.

obtrav:  What is the pace of life like IYTU?  I\'d imagine that on some
worlds there would be the "traditional" shutting down of the stores and
all the men (or all the women) gathering in the coffee shops to talk... 
Or there would be the super fast paced life of the metropolitan cities
of say, Washington, DC today.  And the two would often collide... 
Trader from backwater comes to high tech world for first visit, and
misses the entire auction because he\'s on his pace, and vice versa.... 
High speed trader goes to backwater and goes nuts trying to get anything
done cause he wants to sign now and get outa sphere whereas his local
counterparts are still thinking they are begining negotiations....  Does
this happen to your players\' characters?

Bruce, what about the Rho Ophiuchi dark cloud?  The last distance estimate
I\'d heard for that puts it at about 500 ly from Earth, along line-of-sight
toward Antares. 

(That part of the sky makes for colorful photographs.  See the URL
 http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/twn/ant.html.  The bright yellow
 region in the upper left contains Antares.  The blue region on the
 right is Rho Ophiuchi and its emission nebula; the white area near
 the center of the frame is apparently an associated star formation
 region.  The sodium-light colored "star" immediately below Antares
 to the left is actually the globular cluster M4, in the distant
 background.)

you\'ve picked an impossible design by reiterating unto a divide by
zero that "sticks" the spreadsheet, you\'ve got to give it a temporary fixed 
tonnage number instead of one pulled off a circular formula to get it working 
again.

Anyway, I was analyzing results from a test case - a TL12 light cruiser,
bay weapons, jump-3, 20000tns. Then I looked at the crew, it fit the
HG book well for rank breakdowns - 242 crewmen, 16% officers,
21% petty officers, 63% ratings.

Then I tried a 5000tn Torpedo Frigate - TL12, a couple of 100tn missile
bays and laser batteries. Now the crew breakdown started to skew,
out of 86 crewmen you had 28% officers, 22% petty officers and
only 50% ratings. This is because while most crew recommendations
for rank are based on percentage of complement, there are certain
positions that are mandated: ship commander, section chiefs and small
craft pilots are all officers, and there should (must) be at least one
gunnery petty officer for each type of armament on board. Add these
to the usual 10% officers per department...

This leads to a creeping increase in the percentage of officers on board
as ship sizes drop, which doesn\'t feel right to me. Is this the case in
real world navies? Are there more officers per man on a frigate than there
are on a cruiser? A battleship?

If this shouldn\'t be the case, I\'ll need to come up with some ideas for
modifying mandated officer positions based on crew size. At some
point as ships get smaller the section chief for some ship departments
will be petty (warrant?) officers instead of commissioned officers.

Any real world navy types on the list want to give me a hand? Some
ballpark figures for how many men a petty officer or warrant officer is
usually in charge of would help, as I could use a number like that in
a ship department\'s complement to indicate whether the officer in
charge should have a smaller rank. 

Maybe I shouldn\'t round up the usual 10% figure for officers in a 
department. Rounding up means that even if I only have two engineers
in addition to my chief engineer, one of the two will be another officer.
Perhaps that will give some nicer figures - but it still doesn\'t address
the level at which a department head would be a petty or warrant
officer instead of a commissioned officer.

Rafm didn\'t make Regency Marines. They _do_ make Reformation Coalition
troops, which I have, and some Aslan, but no Vargr that I know of.

You can still order from them.

>HG armour factor and Striker armour are *different*.  There\'s a conversion
factor in one of the old JTAS\'s, but I don\'t remember offhand which one it
is, & since I\'ve been up for about 44 hours now, I think I\'ll pass on
looking for it today.  <grin>  And no, HG does *NOT* differentiate between
armour *material* type in ship calculation, it merely makes you use up more
space for armour at lower tech levels.  The material differences are
*implied* not *stated*.  My take on it is the \'+1" would be the \'tabs\' and
such needed to put the armour on the ship.  Mounting flanges & such.  Ask me
when I\'m awake & I might have a better explanation...

  HG & Striker armours (although not the scaling system, even with the
conversion chart in S/B:2) are theoretically comparable. It seems very
likely that the "volume" requirements for HG armour go down as superior
materials are used at higher TL\'s (see the parallel to the Striker charts)
rather than them merely compacting the styrofoam more tightly.

  The fixed base % ("+1" at TL 14-15, varies by TL) must be structural
engineering (tabs & slots); a reasonable explanation for the increasing
marginal explicit cost of armour at all TLs is still lacking.

Yes, you\'re both quite right.  I appreciate the whole issue isn\'t as
\'simple\' as perhaps I\'ve outlined it (I\'m happy if the participants wish to
define the \'rules\' more stringently).  I certainly don\'t think that it will
settle the issue \'once and for all\'.  (Nice idea but I suspect that as long
as people are playing Traveller it will be an issue.)  No, I merely thought
that a good \'general\' debate around the main issues (raising topics like
those Ian mentioned) would give beginners a starting point on the debate
and give those who\'ve been around longer a framework to discuss.  (Perhaps
like a slightly longer Sunbeard Declaration).  As for the latter, I thought
it was great.  I just think that there\'s enough energy on the list/in the
discussion to create a more substantial document.




"John Macek" <pyra_c@hotmail.com> went on to say:


>Sure.  I\'d join in on a traveller piracy mail list.


I hadn\'t envisioned a whole new list - or if I had - a very time specific
one - i.e. for the duration of the \'debate\'.  If people want a separate
mailing list for the subject, I\'d have to bow out of organising that.  A
limited duration \'discussion\' along the lines of what I\'ve suggested I
could manage.

Yeah, and I can see why it\'s free...I dl\'ed it, and all it does is sit

which program created it :-P

For further clarification...it\'s a Windows program. Platform information
is always nice on software refs...

I mean I could tell you to go to ftp.Amug.org in the Newton 1.0 section
and dl Convert! (no relation) which _is_ something you could use
regularly while gaming, but not a lot of people are going to be able to
use it. I suppose there\'s some sort of PalmPilot version somewhere, too.

Those _are_ useful gaming aids. I have all sorts of useful info and
notes on them...one time I even considered trying to make a Newton Book
of QSDS, but it ended up being huge, and the tables were a bear to read.
On a Netwon 2.0 system, where you can change the layout to landscape, it
probably would have worked better.

I won\'t, though... at least, not again. You can draw your own
conclusions.

US Buyer beware, I bought over the phone by credit card and was charged
1 to 1 exchange rate for US dollars to Canadian. I was quoted US$40 and
saw US$60 show up on my credit card. There was no "misunderstanding", I
was very clear when asking for prices.

Calling them up only had them put me on hold for 15+ minutes before I
was told they could not help me with this matter.

Add to this the fact that my starship miniatures were missing things
like TURRETS and you can color me a very dissatified customer. Again I
got no help from RAFM, except another 15+ minutes on hold. (30+ minutes
to Canada made me glad I found their 800 number)

The bad thing was I told them this was a trial order and that if I was
happy I wanted "one of everything". Still, they couldn\'t get it right. 

Another thing is that these minis are being sold without an Traveller
license. They show up in other RAFM product lines as well. 

BTW, my credit card company refused to back me up without a faxed
statement of the terms of purchase. So the moral of the story is get it
on paper!

It is a shame, really. I preferred them over Ral Partha\'s minis. The
geohex site offers some nice character minis, but the vehicles aren\'t
really to my taste, YMMV. The Full Thrust starship minis look very
promising.

McDonald is generally acknowledged to be the darkest major observatory in 
the entire northern hemisphere (darker even than Mauna Kea on many nights.)

It\'s also the only major observatory with a bullet hole in its primary mirror - 
which, in Texas, somehow doesn\'t surprise me.

Taurus is a hair closer than Rho Oph, but mostly I didn\'t mention it 
because I\'m an irrationally prejudiced northern-hemisphere astronomer.
(Read: much of my work is done at Lick Observatory (38 N), the only time
I\'ve tried to observe Ophiucus (20 S) it was not, on the whole, a success.
(= we didn\'t *quite* break any cables on the adaptive optics system.) 
Wheras I\'m planning observations of some TTauri stars even as we speak...
Ophiucus is pretty comparable to Taurus overall - mostly moderate-mass
stars.

They prolly mistook it for an armadillo after a dozen too many Lone Stars.

I\'d say, those officers are *part* of the 10% per department.  And small craft 
pilots *can* be warrant officers instead of line officers.  Besides, small 
craft pilots & gunners aren\'t counted against the ship\'s \'real\' crew, they 
\'deadhead\' until they\'re needed.

A petty officer isn\'t a warrant officer.  PO\'s are the Navy version of 
sergeants.  Warrant officers are outside the chain of command; in effect, 
they\'re almost like consultants in uniform.

In the military of Commonwealth nations such as New Zealand and
England for instance, a _Chief_ Petty Officer is the _equivalent_ of
a Warrant Officer (and they also hold warrants from the Queen)

Often they do fulfil roles that do not fit directly into the
"reporting"
hierarchy, usualy as unit disciplnarians but their position in the
real chain of command is  very solid.

For instance, a base Warrant Officer (a position, not a rank)
usually
reports directly  to the base commander, rather than through an
intervening officer but as far as chain of command is concerned,
he\'s effectively God. bar the officer he reports to (and even the
base conmmander might not be able to easily contradict him )

An 04 or higher _might_ get away with not following
a "suggestion" from a WO/CPO,   but it\'s a brave 01
that would even consider standing up to a WO/CPO

However the formalities of rank need to followed
This leads to the sort of situatuion ( that I\'ve seen myself )
where you hear, out the back of the Officer\'s  Mess on a Friday
night, something like :

"You are a complete disgrace to the uniform, you horrible
 little bag of shite. Now drag that misbegotten carcass
back inside and clean your putrid excresences off the
Mess floor,  Sir ! "

Of course, I\'ve removed the obligatory obscenities from
the above example.

Depends on your definition of officer. In the real US Navy, you have your
department heads and division officers. These are officer "positions",
however, the particular rank of the individual does not nescessarily need
to be a commisioned officer.

When I served onboard USS Blue Ridge, I worked for one of the flag
departments under Commander, Seventh Fleet. Our department was headed by a
Commander (later to be replaced by a Lt. Commander), but my particular
division was headed by a Master Chief Petty Officer (later relieved by a
Senior Chief). This was typical of the smaller divisions onboard, but most
of the larger divisions, particularly engineering and maintenance (this was
an LCC, based on an Iwo Jima class helo carrier hull) were headed by
Ensigns and Junior grade Lieutenants.

So, to answer your question, there will be fewer crewmen on board smaller
ships, but the number of officer positions will remain relatively constant
since the breakdown of departments are uniform throughout the fleet. There
will always be an engineering, deck/weapons, security, etc. department
regardless of the ship size.

Or Perry\'s Chemical Engineers\' Handbook. Similar in many respects, also
includes some wonderful formulae, like strength of piping, and
viscosity/flow formulae. My dad gave me his 1961 ed when he (Finally)
upgraded to the 90 edition. It also makes a wonderful player control

Mine is being at the railroad camp near Talkeetna, Alaska. Only a handful

mountains and miles. The sky is Grey with stars.... and the constellationns

What?!? How?

BTW, the Aslan look very good, IMO. As good as the old
Grenadier Traveller figures. Another place which may
still carry some TNE starship minis is Bosco\'s in
Anchorage, Alaska. I can\'t remember their URL; just
search for "Bosco\'s".

Anybody know where I can get the minis for the
Merc Cruiser and the SDBs?

The US Navy has 10-15% officers on most ships, but the %\'s change if any
aircraft are onboard.  the %\'s of enlisted should be close to even for
petty officers and ratings. As for small craft pilots, anything less
than say 50dT and is a non-combatant could be commanded by a petty
officer or chief petty officer as the US Navy has enlisted command
boats.  Some non-combatant helos are commanded by Warrant officers
(which don\'t show up in Traveller) But fighter pilots should still be
officers.

On some of the smaller ships "officer" positions may be held by (chief)
petty officers.

I only use the command crew (1 for every 6 required crew) as officers,
which gives 14%.  and medical crew does not require officers (Doctors)
as the Destroyer that I was on had 2 corpsmen as the medical department
(1 chief [e-7], and 1 rate [e-3])

Looking at the writeups in AHL, it would seem that warrants in the late 3i
may be like warrants in many european military organizations: the senior
enlisted.

I\'ve not seen other references to warrants in traveller.

US military warrants are often more than "Consultants in Uniform"... all
the warrants I\'ve known have either been specialists who needed to outrank
all enlisted, chopper pilots, LPN nurses (only one I\'ve known), or
Physician\'s assistants. I was sworn into the US army at MEPS by a Coast
Guard JAG/Legal warrant. All the warrants I\'ve known WERE in authority over
enlisted men. Most of them were former enlisted.

BTW: there was an old DOD poster showing correspondancies between nator and
warsaw pact military ranks and insignia... almost all european warrants
corresponded to US E7-E9 grades/ranks. US Warrants were the special case.
(A few european powers had some equivalent).

But I agree, many coxswains should exist (Coxswain - enlisted man in
command of a naval vessel, usually a small craft. Source: Naval Science
(NROTC/NJROTC) Textbook [can\'t remeber hether NS II or III])

IMTU, I don\'t have warrants in the Imperium, and the Zhodani warrants
follow the warsaw pact model of "Senior NCO\'s who get salutes". Also, IMTU,
fighter pilots are officers due to the restriction (again wholly my own bit
here) that only officers are allowed to engage on discretion.

It should not be the fact that mirror has a hole but only *one* hole just how
many shots did it take the shooter(s) to score that shot and at what range?<G>.

Why do you think the rural road signs here in Texas have the appearance of

That was the only warrant officer job I knew of, aircraft pilot (it\'s the

I\'d kind of assumed that "warrant officer" was a tag you put on anyone
who wasn\'t an officer, but was doing a job normally assigned to an
officer - so I figured that a Chief Engineer who was lower than an
Ensign would be a WO instead of a PO.

Thanks for the info on them.

Maybe you should come \'down\' here sometime. Those I\'ve talked to who have
been to the northern hemisphere have all commented on how few stars there
are up there.

I was there on a field trip with my astronomy class, they did not let us
see the main telescope.  but did a little star gazing through 16" and
smaller telescopes there.  But it was darker in the middle of the
pacific.

Some of the TNE spacecraft minis have been re-released as fighter craft
for the Iron Crown Enterprises minis game "Silent Death."  (I don\'t know
offhand which ones were re-released [although the only set of TNE minis
I had purchased before GDW went belly-up, the shuttle, was _not_
re-released], but check the Silent Death supplement "Universal Night
Watch" for ship silhouettes.)

worth the dough.  Kudos to all responsible.

Good features.. the detailed world and setting info.  the Current Events.  The
Corps and Aliens of the area... all well presented and summarized.  Rules
being absent.  

Sadly, one of the first things I noticed when flipping through was a typo.
Strephon himself is going to "Ilesh"...  maybe an outsiders way of saying
Ilelish? ; )  
Nits I have... the disjointed Sector map at the back... I\'d prefer a joined
sector map w/ a subsector key etc.  Also, I think each subsector description
should say what subsector it is... something along the lines of "Regina
Subsector (Subsector C)."  Other than that, it looks damned good...  Of
course, i\'d prefer UWPs, etc ala the Regency Sourcebook, but that\'s
understandable seeing this is for G:T.  Lastly... IMO, "Behind the Claw" as a
title would be more appropriate for a Domain of Deneb Sourcebook...  When do
we get Deneb Sector?  lol

What I really like is that it seems to be entirely Rules Absent and all
setting.  We have enough Traveller rules out there... I should hope T5 comes
in its hardback/softback rules whatever (which i probably won\'t get), but that
most of the setting supplements especially should be just like Behind the Claw
(in which case I most likely *will* get)... Of course a real Traveller version
would have UWPs... 

Hmm... it seems time to start adding to my Regency campaign... I\'ll bet those
incoming sublight ships got destroyed by the RQS...  the question is, what is
Muodray doing in 1202? : )

There are good mysteries and background in there... Andor, Candory and "Little
Father" (especially when coupled w/ the weird Droyne activity from 1110 to
1118).  Looks like "The Islands, part II" is en route, except these guys have
nothing to do but shoot up the neighborhood (and maybe carve themselves a
polity)... hmm, sound like Human ihatei.  heh.   I\'m wondering what Varian is
up to... is he messing w/ the Zhos?  One incident definately looks fishy
(smuggling? Zho agents?)... His activies aren\'t reminiscent (to me anyways) of
Cleon II... Then there\'s that timelost Solomani (shouldn\'t it be Terran
Confederation?) cruiser...
I am still doubtful of any large story arcs in G:T similar in scope to what
TNE would\'ve saw (and one day still may :::fingers crossed::::) but think I
can be satisfied w/ this for now. : )

First Aid skill can be used at half level.

* All airway manoeuvres have a risk of mishap : disrupting the cervical
spine, base of skull (making existing injuries worse) or putting an
endotracheal tube into the oesophagus (unrecognised, this is a lethal
error) instead of the trachea readily spring to mind.

Spectacular Failure : 1D further damage
Tasks may be repeated. You must secure an airway, else all other effort
will be wasted!

3. Breathing :- Difficulty, Medical/First Aid, Dex
Maneouvre      Indication     Base Difficulty   Bonus to C tasks
[Start oxygen  mandatory      no task                 0]
Ventilate      Major+ chest   Easy                    +1
               damage
Insert chest   Major+ chest   Average(1)              +1
drain          damage
Insert gastric Major+ chest   Average(2)              +1
tube           or abdo damage
               unconscious

Notes
(1) - requires tools + local anaesthetic (or unconscious/general)
(2) - requires tools

* Inserting drainage tubes can make things worse. Hearts have been
perforated by personnel inserting chest drains. Stomachs have been
perforated inserting gastric tubes. Never, never introduce a gastric or
airway tube through the nose of someone who may have a base of skull
fracture ; it may end up poking into the brain...

Spectacular failure : 1D damage

4. Circulation :- Difficulty, Medical/First Aid, Dex
Manoeuvre         Indication                Difficulty
Direct Pressure   control external bleeding Easy

Insert IV cannula permit volume resusc.     Average(1)

(1) Difficult if Major damage

* Volume resuscitation : (wound difficulty), Med/First Aid, victim\'s
End (co-operative), bonuses from previous steps

    Wound        Difficulty
    Superficial  Easy (usually not required)
    Minor        Average
    Major        Difficult
    Destroyed    Formidable

    Success restores consciousness if not anaesthetised/sedated or
    Destroyed level damage (nearly dead!). A safe blood
    pressure is maintained in the presence of a patent airway and
    adequate oxygenation.

    Failure : catastrophe check. Spectacular failure : catastrophe
    check +1D damage. Spectacular success : \'rolls back\' half dice
    of damage.

Pericard tap Major+chest  Difficult(1)
Cardiac      Destroyed    Average (external)
massage      damage       Difficult (open)(1)

(1) assumes appropriate tools, +1 for impromptu.

These tasks permit catastrophe checks and Spectacular failure
damage to be reversed or ignored.
Success leads to a restoration of normal heart rhythm with stable
blood pressure.
Failure causes 1D damage. Ventilation and cardiac
massage will need to be continued until definitive treatment can be
performed.

Notes :-
Volume resuscitation :- blood, blood products (eg. clotting
factors), colloids (protein or starch solutions), crystalloids
(salt solutions) - TL 4+
Crystalloids or colloids can be used until blood is available.
Blood and blood products should be used only when bleeding is
controlled (except for very dire circumstances).

5. Stabilised or not?
Further catastrophe checks can be made every ten minutes or so or at
important points (transfer onto or off a vehicle, or for dramatic
effect...)

C. The Secondary Survey
Evaluate injury by region and treat accordingly.
i. Evaluation.
Retain verbiage on investigations

*Diagnosis of injury : Average, Medical, Edu, uncertain

This task can be co-operative (either with sophont
physicians or expert systems). The practical upper limit
is three medics.

Higher technology level investigations reduce
uncertainty:
TL 4-5         +1 DM on uncertainty roll
   6-8         +3 DM "
   9-11        +4 DM "
   11+         +5 DM "

Total Truth : +2 to treatment tasks
Some Truth : baseline
Some Untruth : -1 to treatment tasks
Total Untruth : -2 to treatment tasks

*To perform a successful embolisation : Difficult,
Medical, Dex. Equipment is required to attempt
this task.

Indications :- Major+ abdominal damage.
Surgery is required if embolisation fails.

At lower tech levels, more surgery is performed.
At higher tech levels, more sophisticated tests are performed.

Catastrophe checks should be made during the evaluation process.

ii. Treatment.
The following task covers any area not previously specified.

To treat injuries :- variable, Medical/First Aid, Edu/Dex
+ evaluation mods, as above.

Severity      Difficulty
Superficial   Easy ; First Aid OK
Minor         Average ; First Aid OK
Major         Difficult
Destroyed     Formidable

This is a co-operative task ; the surgeon\'s first assistant
provides half their skill.
Optionally, up to two surgical teams (surgeon+first
assistant) can operate at the same time on different parts
of the patient. This permits wounds to be separated into different
tasks.

Regions (1 team per region) :-
Head
Arms/chest/abdo
Legs

Surgery requiring general anaesthetic, or resuscitation for
Destroyed injuries requires an endotracheal tube to control
the airway and an anaesthetist.

+1 difficulty level for impromptu/inadequate tools
(eg. suturing without local anaesthetic) and/or setting (in
the field vs operating theatre).

**The usual outcome for this task is to enable healing. On a
Spectacular Success, 1D damage points are \'rolled back\'.
Spectacular Failure inflicts 1D damage.

The anaesthetist can make a task roll as above to try and reverse
Spectacular Failure. He or she cannot improve on Spectacular Success.

Aftercare and Outcomes : retain verbiage

Severity    Supplies? Home Care? Ward? ICU? Theatre/Reanim?
Superficial  Y/3D      N          N     N    maybe, 500
Minor        N         Y/UR      100    N    maybe, 500 X 1D
Major        N         Y/UR      100   500   yes, 1000 X 1D
Destroyed    N         Y/UR      100   500   1000 X 1D/250K

Y, yes : N, no. Numbers or dice cost in Cr per day of hospitalisation
or occasion of service.
UR - until recovered.
Healing rates :-
Superficial  1 point, all affected chars, per day
Minor        1 point, all affected chars, per day
Major        1 point, one characteristic, per day
             ICU -> ward when one char recovered or conscious
             ward -> home when all chars 50% of original value
Destroyed    1 point, one characteristic, per week, until
             50% of points recovered - then treat as Major

Slow drug speeds this up by a factor of ten. Its use is confined to
ICU and Major+level damage.
For Superficial and Minor injuries :-
Enhanced wound healing doubles the rate of recovery at TL 9+
Triples it at TL 12+
(gentle growth quickening and tissue culture tech)

Progress and Complications
Severity     Check
Superficial  Infection check, 3 days after injury
Minor        Infection check, 3 days after injury
Major        Consciousness check, daily
             Catastrophe check, every second day (daily if slow drug)
Destroyed    Consciousness check twice a week
             Catastrophe check daily

Infection check : Infection occurs on a Spectacular Failure on a
Average,
End task (roll a natural 2). Healing stops until the infection is
treated.

If in hospital, task is Average Medical (attendant), End (patient).

Consciousness check : Difficult, End. Wake up if successful.

Catastrophe check : Difficult, Medical (attendant), End (patient)
Spectacular Failure leads to the development of some problem. 1D damage
is applied promptly.

Effects :-
All characteristics to zero :- cardiac arrest, any cause
Two characteristics to zero :- eg. severe infection, bleeding, pulmonary

embolism (blood clot to lungs), heart attack (myocardial infarction).
One characteristic to zero :- minor infection or wound breakdown.

Miscellany :-

To thaw from low berth :-

Difficult, Med, Edu.
Spectacular Failure leads to automatic Destroyed damage
(cardiac arrest).

Reanimation is a Formidable Medical, Edu task (co-operative OK).
+1 difficulty level if fast drug used instead of low berthing.

I am fairly impressed by the content, as it will be useful
to many Traveller games even those using a different region
or setting. eg Reavers Deep.  

I was hoping for a good map, which details the Spinward Marches
area.  However the map on P142 appears faint, and is missing a
few lines on the borders of sub sectors.  Does anyone know of a
program or PDF file which would enable this kind of map to be
printed on an A4 sheet of paper.  (is A4 metric ??)

The snippets of cultural information for each planet are good,
and will enable GMs to set the scene rather than "You land on
another Water World it is wet" (GM burnout - having to translate
another set of UWP after an exploratory trade mission)

Maybe I can help here at least as far as Warrant Officers are concerned and
then you can make your own choices.  First, I am a retired U.S. Army Chief
Warrant Officer. There are two types of warrant officers in the U.S.
Military.  They are the pilots (we called them rotor heads because they flew
helicopters) and technical warrants (leg warrant because they aren\'t
pilots.)  I was a technical warrant specializing in Electronic Intelligence
(ELINT) and Foreign Instrumentation Systems Intelligence (FISINT)

I came up through the enlisted ranks to Sergeant First Class (E-7) and made
a decision that I didn\'t want be an Non-Commissioned Officer In Charge
(NCOIC) of an S-3 (Operations/Training) or S-2 (Security) shop at Battalion
(Bn)/Brigade (Bde) or for that matter a First Sergeant (1SG or "First
Shirt") in the Company.  Because I was fairly senior in grade I had
opportunities to try out those jobs and didn\'t really care to be an
administrator or a baby sitter for the rest of my career.  Having been lucky
enough to be promoted early, to have been to numerous technical assignments
where I gathered an inordinate amount of expertise in my career field and
had been to 152 weeks of technical schools (40 hours a week, 8 hours a day)
plus had my share of salad dressing on my uniform I decided to apply for
warrant officer.  There were 36 slots in the entire U.S. Army for my career
field.  They could only fill 33 because we weren\'t at war and I competed
against 65 other people for the one open slot that year.  Needless to say it
gives you a certain amount of pride when you are the one selected.  You come
into the field as a recognized expert and you are supposed to be fully
qualified plus you already have numerous years in the military. In my chosen
world I was just above average when compared to my peers.  Having explained
how tough it was to get there might give you a better understanding of why
commissioned officers pretty much leave you to your own devices.  Now this
covers the technical warrants and from my experience the Navy and the Marine
Corps worked pretty much the same way.

Flight Warrants start out differently.  Usually they are enlisted men that
are attracted to the aviation career field but occassionally you get a
warrant officer into the program that just wasn\'t cutting it in his career
field or he just wanted to change to aviation for whatever reason.  This
means that anyone 18.5 years old (in the U.S. Army) can go to flight school
and if they graduate they are promoted to warrant officer.  This was very
prevalent in the 60\'s and 70\' (Vietnam era) and lot of young men lost their
lives as history tells us.  In almost every case they start out in
helicopters with less than 10% going on to fixed wing.  Now days the fixed
wing world is pretty much reserved for warrant officers at W-3 and up.

Ranks for Warrant Officers are as follows:
   WO-1  -  Warrant Officer
CWO-2  -  Chief Warrant Officer
CWO-3  -      "            "          "
CWO-4  -  Senior Warrant Officer
CWO-5  -  Master Warrant Officer

These ranks are between E-9 (Sergeant Major, Master CPO, etc..) and O-1 (2nd
Leuitenant, Ensign).  As far as I know, company grade officers still defer
to Warrant Officers (as long as you don\'t hurt their pride.) These are the
ranks up to Captain (Army/Marine Corps) and Leuitenant (Navy).  The first
real challenge to the warrant officer\'s authority comes from the Field Grade
Officers (Major, LtCdr up to COL and CPT [Navy]).  Don\'t get me wrong, I
never jumped an officer in front of the "men", I waited till I had them
behind closed to doors to "give him/her some training".  You can\'t have the
"men" losing respect for the officers just because they are ignorant.  I
only knew of one commissioned officer that was really stupid and couldn\'t be
trained and we got rid of him PDQ.

Other countries warrant officers often fell into the realm of "Super NCO"
and they weren\'t afforded the privileges of the "Officer Corps" as were the
American Warrants.  As an example I went to the deep sea survival course
presented by the RAF in Plymouth, England and they had a real hard time with
what we were.  Eventually it was determined that since our Armed Forces
recognized us as real live officers then they would too.  We stayed in the
Bachelor Officer Quarters and had our meals at the officers mess.  I was
duly impressed being served my meals by orderlies, beds made, shoes shined,
etc.  What a life!!!

A few years before I retired they offered Warrant Officers the chance to get
commissioned.  The only change in status was you could perform swearing in
ceremonies, administer disciplinary actions (in accordance with the UCMJ)
and be a commander.  That way the Army got more bang for its buck.  That was
what the warrant corps was all about from the beginning, an officer that
worked cheap and knew what he was doing.

An old saying:
When you warrant a product;
it\'s a guarantee  of satisfaction.
When you commission a product,
you hope it will work.

If you have further questions I have some of the history of the U.S. Army\'s
Warrant Officer Corps and would be happy to answer what I can.  Please use
my personal eMail address for those to keep the bandwidth down.

Alien Races I for GURPS Traveller
Five alien races described in detail: the psionic Zhodani, the canine
Vargr, and (seen for the first time) the tyrannosaurian Drakarans, the
arachnoid Clotho and the enigmatic Sheol. The book contains starship
deck plans and vehicle designs; typical weaponry; rules for creating
player characters, and lots of sample NPCs; up-to-date history and
cultural information for each race, and much more. A must for Traveller
fans!

GURPS Traveller: Star Mercs
Everything you need for a military-oriented campaign in the universe of
Traveller! This book covers combat (and a soldier\'s life) in the 57th
century; how to recruit, organize, and equip a mercenary unit; and the
Imperial rules of war. There are descriptions of how armies are
organized and equipped for Tech Levels from 5 to 12, discussions of
strategy and tactics, and a comprehensive rundown on weapons and the
other tools of the soldier\'s trade.

Star Mercs also includes templates for military and mercenary soldier
characters, sample missions, and a variety of units and NPC
personalities your mercenary group might encounter, including the famed
and feared Imperial Marines.

    'body' => 'Hi all,

I\'ve been lurking on and off, and now that the piracy question has finally
been settled I thought I\'d ask a question.

What do you do with a dead Vilani?

I\'ve been working on an archeology adventure and this just hit me.  Nothing
on Vland, or presumably the other planets they explored prior to meeting
Terrans, could get a Vilani sick.  The biochemistry is just too different.
That would have to work both way, nothing would find a Vilani edible.  Not
even the bacteria, fungi, insects and all the rest that decompose dead
tissue.

Dear departed uncle Eneri wouldn\'t decompose.  He would just lay on his
slab and dry out.  Just like a king sized Twinky.  Nothing in nature would
touch him.

Does this creepy scenario sound right?  While I know only a little biology,
if you take the one fact that the Vilani had no disease until meeting
Solomani, doesn\'t this make sense?

This would also explain some Vilani conservatism.  If you could point to
old, great great grandfather Eneri, dead this last century, that could go a
long way toward not changing the way thing were done in his day.  Ancestor
worship wouldn\'t be just a religious thing, it would be a civic duty!  You
just can\'t let your ancestors gather dust and get all raggedy now, or
expect someone else to tidy them up.  Besides, they are watching...

Of course, most of these bets are off when the Solomani arrive.  Another
explanation too.  The First Imperium fell to the Terrans so fast because of
1 - superior technology, 2 - rampant disease, and 3 - uncounted ranks of
carefully tended ancestors, the repository of tradition, the founders of
civilization, start rotting like so many old jack o lanterns.

There is something to picture.  The last Vilani emporer sitting on the
throne, hearing the latest reports of unstoppable weapons of the
barbarians.  Lingering death mowing down the populations ofentire worlds.
He decides to meditate in the grand Hall of Ancestors.  As he approches the
great doors, a stench lingers in the air.   Slowly he pushes the doors
open, the groan inprotest.  The smell is overpowering.  He turns on the
lights, they slowly  come on.  He looks to his great grandfather for
guiadance.  And screams in horror at what is staring back at him.

Happy Halloween.

Uncasted, not casteless, there\'s a subtle difference. Presumably
Chirpers of the right age, who undergo a Droyne casting ceremony would
mature into Droyne. G:T Encyclopedia section says they are genetically
identical, too, but not much else.

And grrr...my FLGS doesn\'t have BTC yet :-( They _do_ have a number of
other GURPS books, I saw both hard and softbound Basic rules and
Traveller, Compendium 1, Vehicles, Robots, UltraTech and a number of
others. No Space, though...

I don\'t think exclusively so. I figure pirates will work the lesser inner
worlds as well. Especially since the innersystems routes will put in-system
merchants on 4-5 day sub-light courses (assuming T-plates).

this assumes too much tracking of cargos for my taste, and too few

Again, I disagree here, as at least a few will be operating as purpose
built commerce raiders in local wars. I believe that pirates will be
treated much the same as mercs.

the entire German fleet sortied to intercept the Operation Torch convoys
that they had received intelligence about.  I only played out one game
which was an action against a convoy coming up from South Africa, with
the 2 Pocket Battleships and a Light Cruiser and a Wolf Pack (plus a
disguised Armed Merchant Cruiser) against a mixed escort of British and
Australian CAs/CLs and Long Range Escorts (I think 2/2/6 respectively

would play out the main force of Bismarck/Tirpitz/Scharnhorst/Gniesenau
and Graf Zepplin possibly with Prinz Eugen against convoys coming from
Canada/England and the USA as a campaign, but I never finished painting
the models although I believe that I have 50% of all the warships
available in the Atlantic at the time.  The idea being to split the
classes so that no more than 50% would ever be in the same group.

like this:

Radar tells you how far away an aircraft is and maybe its size.  It does
not tell you what the aircraft is or how high it is.  The SSR does that
by responding to the Radar pulse hitting the plane with information
about the plane, eg its Code (a number assigned to it) this is converted
to its Call Sign (eg KLM123 the number printed on your ticket) by
software before display on the Radar Tube.  It also provides the height
of the aircraft, and in some cases the air speed.  Note that the height
is the height that the aircraft instruments believe they are at.  This
depends on the air pressure and there is more than one setting. 
Aircraft departing from France use one setting and this needs to be
changed once the plane arrives in English airspace as we use a different
setting.  Otherwise the aircraft believes it is at a different level (I
believe that it thinks it is higher than it really is).  I have been
told that this was the cause of the plane crash that killed Graham Hill
the Formula 1 racing driver who was the father of the current F1 driver
Damon Hill.  The plane flew into a hill in  fog as the pressure settings
had not been changed.

If this concept is pushed forward into the Traveller environment, then I
guess that the equivalent would be that the distance and bearing within
the "galactic plane" could be measured by the sensors, but not the
height above or below the "galactic plane".  Somewhere in the Traveller
Docs that I have read recently (T4 or GURPS) there was a passage
describing the transponders stating that it was not possible to change
"who" you were, only where you were and your destination (route?).

appears to have been that the 11" Armour Piercing Shells went straight
through Exeter and out the other side without exploding.  One of the
German gunners apparently commented after the scuttling that if they had
not expended their 11" High Explosive rounds on merchant ships the
outcome may have been very different.  I believe Exeter took something
in the region of 75 hits with a similar number (mostly lighter shells)
on the CLs.

4x15" would probably have been even worse under these circumstances. 
More difficult to hit and even less likely to explode.  In Salvo firing
you usually need 4 shell splashes to determine when a ship has been
straddled or whether it is over or under.  With only 4 guns you are
firing half as fast and allowing the enemy to move further between each
shoot.  This is one of the reasons that the Royal Navy stuck to 4
turrets for so long (8 or 12 guns).  The KGVs were originally designed
with a twin X turret as well to give 12 guns but this was reduced as
they could not fit the design into 35000 tons and even the 10 gun
version didn\'t quite make it although it was a lot closer than any other
attempt to build within that limit.

Both these ships were to have given twin 15" turrets in place of their
triple 11", but the war intervened and the work was never done. If this
had
happened it would\'ve been somewhat different.

Germany as they did in the WW2.

The Americans did the same to the Japanese in the latter parts of WW2. 
The difference being that their main force (the Aircraft Carriers) were
destroyed having sortied in the expectation of causing the Americans a
crushing blow.  The Japanese call the Battle of Midway "the 15 minutes

Japanese had to be crushed before they would sue for surrender, but they

German ships (I believe Prinz Eugen) had Sound Ranging gear on board

miles out).  The recognised Hood from sound recordings made much
earlier, but were puzzled by the other ship - she was similar to KGV but
definitely not that ship, so they surmised that PoW must have been
completed and had sailed.  The Germans did _not_ know that PoW was
seaworthy when Bismarck sailed.  In fact she sailed with a large number
of dockhands onboard (I believe circa 145), finishing off some of the
work before the action, and were able to help repair the damage caused
by the action before she got back to port.

Note also that the War Office (the forerunner to the MoD) did not
believe that one KGV class could take on the Bismarck.  PoW was ordered
to break off the action, and KGV was ordered to wait until Rodney could
be diverted from Convoy Escort to assist her.

One other unsubstantiated bit of information that I have is that Vian\'s
Destroyer attack during the night was beaten off by such accurate
secondary fire that the commander concluded that the guns were radar
controlled and that the radar had somehow survived intact to that
point.  I would be more inclined to believe that it was the sound
ranging equipment helping to give the DD\'s position, but I don\'t know
how that would work with her own guns firing.

One suggestion made for the lack of information on the sound ranging
equipment is that this equipment formed the basis of the RN\'s post war
Sonar system.

The only other British Dreadnought Battleship lost during WW1 was HMS

She was towed towards Lough Swilly by the White Star Olympic (sister to

	Cute scenario, but I find it implausible, and nowhere near as
horrible as the _REAL_ truth.

	Consider the following: the Vilani survived the Ancients blowing
each other to kingdom come.  They were left to their own devices on a
planet where the vast majority of life forms were just plain incompatible
to humaniti.  Their struggle to find culinary adaptations that would enable
them to survive was such that it marked their culture for millennia; I give
you the Shugilli as an example.  For a long, long time, protein must have
been a rare commodity on Vland.

	No, when a Vilani died, they wouldn\'t keep him around to admire.
They\'d eat him on the spot.

	Happy Halloween...

	And Happy Halloween to all the TML veterans screaming in horror
over the  Great Vilanibalism Flame War come lurching back to life :).

An amendment \'on the unsafe parts of systems\' is acceptable to the mover :)

See, thats what I meant ... the \'outsystem\' is everything that isnt around
the mainworld. As rambling way of background, I used to live on King
Island, which is on the western end of Bass Strait between Australia and
Tasmania.

It\'s a small place, population between about 1500 and 5000 depending on how
well the scheelite mine is going, and has recently diversified into luxury
exports (damn fine cheese, butter and cream).

It has my defintion of a Class D starport - they send a bloke in a ute with
a shotgun to scare the seagulls off the landing strip so the small planes
can land, and you refuel from 44 gallon drums of avgas.

Now, King Islanders call Tasmania \'the mainland\', despite mainland
Australia being (a) closer and (b) a hell of a lot bigger.

So I can see the equivalent of Mercury being called \'the outsystem\' ...

I think the operative phrase is \'they know to be stolen\'. If they dont know
it\'s been nicked, then you dont have a problem selling it at wholesale.

There is the weasel word \'tend\' in there, and I was trying to keep to
piracy rather than lawful commerce raiding as part of an
Imperially-sanctioned conflict. Does anyone have the cite on the American
Civil War fight between the USN and CSN ships in the English Channel ? I
remember reading about it - I think the RN and French were completely cool
with everything, just as long as only combatant flagged ships got hurt.

I don\'t see any reason why you _both_ can\'t be right.  Suppose that the
hypothetical Vilanibals decided that aged dead Vilani tasted better than
fresh.  This could evolve into allowing particularly deserving Vilani to
age longer, thus becoming delicacies.  Later, as the Vilani were able to
find other sources of protein, they simply continued to let the dead
"age" (i.e., they stopped dining on their ancestors).

Be careful when comparing different texts. In many cases the same term is
used differently by different writers and other terms are synonymous with
one author and means different things with another. I think Marc gave a
definition of a capital ship a few weeks ago: A ship that can shoot up
any other ship that is not itself a capital ship. So, yes, cruisers are
not capital ships. But if you are thinking of the bit about each sector
theoretically having 1000 ships, then the text said \'combat vessels\', not
capital ships (a term that is itself open to misinterpretation, since
destroyers and other auxiliaries can perfectly well be regarded as combat
vessels too).

Which is why, IMTU, the Imperium encourages its member worlds to invest in

Because some people have no self control?

It is not limited to Texas: Every rural road sign in McLean county Illinois is
riddled with bulletholes. When I was 16 I was in a car that was fired upon by
some f***ing moron with a .22 (and I\'m _still_ trying to figure out who it
was, so I can find him and clog dance on his kidneys for a while).

In the late 70s, some dolt decided to empty 200 rounds from an M2 carbine into
the pipeline pumping station where my father worked. Fortunately, no one was
there, but several rounds almost hit a propane tank, which would have had some
interesting results had the stuff caught fire and set off the oil in the tank
farm. My dad estimated that if the tanks had caught fire, the heat would have
melted asphalt a mile away.

Some people give responsible gun owners a bad name...

Another point to conciter, some pirates may have formerly operated as
contract privateers, or may still be operating under contract. These
"pirates" may have managed to acquire or be outfited with small raider type
warships.

It may not give those kinds of errors, since most planetary sensors would
have an accurate bearing on a ship based at least on energy output, and if
the ship is emitting on a known radio frequency, then an accurate range
could be determined by dopplar shifting.

However, in border areas where other goverments interact with the Imperium,
transponder confusion could become quite a problem. Problems left to the
imagination of the referee.

One, this is just getting a seed. What they were talking about was the
ability to "save space" be just listing the starting "seed" for the
random number generator, because the subsequent values will *always* be
the same (it\'s inherent in the nature of the "random" number
algorithm). So your idea *won\'t* work for this.

Next, *never* EVER "periodically sample" any sort of "clock" to get
seeds. The results will be non-random. It\'s ok to sample such a "clock"
*once* when you start the program. But never do so with a program that
is automatically started at a given time. 

Getting a reasonable approach to "random" numbers is difficult even
when you do everything *right*. When you pull the periodic sampling
bit, you screw it up big time.

The need for transponders will be as ships are coming into port.
(That is really the only time there will be a significant chance of collision).
There you will need the same info as with planes.

 really should be coompared with, say three 500,000 DT BBs. Also how much
 does the whole setup cost?
  >>

1) I wouldn\'t use a rider batron on defense (well maybe her riders as LARGE
SDB\'s)
2) Tigress: 500,000 tons and about 453,000 MC\'s. TL15
3) tender ron: TL 15
4) Tender ron costs about 790,000 MCs (tender and 16 riders).

Thus an even (by MC) duel is 1 Tigress, her 300 50ton fighters, and 2 200,000
ton Kokirrik BB\'s verses the rider ron.

I dug out my old TCS, HG rules and skimmed through it using as much
statistical combat and averaged rolls as possible (it still was a knightmare).
I made several observations:

1) size matters. A bigger ship is much less vunerable to critical hits. You
basically can\'t get any extra criticals on the Tigress (you still have the
1/36 chance on the regular (radiation hit table) chart for a critical though).

2) Black Globes are AWSOME!. They act as an extra armor factor 8. Thus this
and the hull armor 15 on the riders basically make all weapons except Meson
guns skip right off the chart into "no effect land". This only lasts until the
capacitors are full (I had to use 500 tons of ship to install 500 capacitors.
No jump engine-no "free" capacitors). The 500 installed can keep the globe
running at 40% flicker for about 4-5 turns. After this; they get full, and the
globe shuts down (or the rider goes boom on the next hit). The tender by her
immense bulk (hmmn\'; maybe I should call her the brontosaurus class), has huge
junp drives and thus huge capacitor capacity. She can flicker forever, or go
opaque for quite a while, and absorb lots of hits (about 30 Meson T hits I
think).

3) fighters can really do a number on the tender, since a dispersed structure
ship has no armor. I had to use a rider as an escort, to shoot them down. To
do this I had to have agility 6 (a LARGE power plant), and organise my laser
turrets into 1 turret batteries instead of 10 turret batteries (making them
useless to stop ship missiles, but allowing me to shoot at 10 times the number
of fighters.

Results: (I gave the Tigress a Black Globe to even up the sides a bit and to
even up the money. The BB\'s were still short 500MC\'s.) Note: the HG rules were
unclear if fighters launched from the Battle line could raid the tender in the
reserve. I thought it was logical that they could scatter around the riders
and go for the tender.

Turn 1: The rider ron mission kills one Kokirrik (irradiates the crew, and
critical hits the jump drives). One rider escorts the tender and mission kills
115 of the first 120 fighters via multiple weapon and fuel hits. (the Tigress
can launch 120 a turn). The Bat ron mission kills one rider (a zillion weapon
hits cripple the meson gun), and the fighters scour the weapons off the tender
and kill her manuever drive. The tender turns her globe from flicker (the
globe saved her from worse damage) to opaque.

Turn 2: The rider ron mission kills the other Kokirrik (as above). The escort
rider mission kills another 115 fighters of 120 (second wave). These fighters
having no target ( their peashooters couldn\'t add much energy to the tender\'s
capacitors), shoot at the escort rider, but don\'t do much (that d--n black
globe). The Batron mission kills another rider.

Turn 3: Situation: 1 Tigress and 90 some odd fighters Vs 14 riders. As both
sides have lots of armor, and screens, and Black globes, it boils down to a
Meson gun attrition duel. I figure in about 4-5 turns a riders\' globe goes
down, and the Tigress can then use her 430 missile bays (ouch!) on it. The
Tigress has large jump drives, and thus large capacitors. Her globe isn\'t
going down any time soon. I figure that she\'ll mission kill a couple of riders
until she is overwhelmed by critical hits (each type T meson gun hit rolls 19
times on the radiation and interior explosion tables!). Sooner or later,
she\'ll lose a major system on the critical hit table (or even go boom!).

Conclusions: While this is hardly scientific (I took a lot of liberties to
save time: ex: I made the assumption that a 50 ton fighter with two weapons
out is mission killed); it does show that a lot of small riders with big meson
guns can overwhelm a large battleship. This is due to the construction rule
allowing only one spinal mount per ship. The defenses available can negate the
other weapons, and this is decisive, even though the large ship is a lot less
vunerable to extra critical hits. It is also vital to have Black Globes. If
the Kokirriks had them and/or the riders didn\'t (though this would have made
the riders 48000 MC\'s cheaper), things would have no doubt been different...

I never tried BR or BL so I don\'t know if this would still happen... I have
heard that they are broken, but then again a lot of people say HG is
simplistic AND broken...

If the Vilani can live in the biosphere, then bacteria can live on their
bodies.  Bacteria are superbe at biochemistry and if human can live on
local building blocks then bacterial can live on them.  (For example,
Vilani food _must_ contain amino acids for humans to live on it, but
amino acids are a very nice souce of food for bacteria).

Regarding other comments on Vilani eating each other for food.  The
fact is that canabalism can never make up for a societies lack of food.
(You can \'t get anything from eating a person that you could get from
the food he was eating.)

kabloey, and as far as I can tell it never saw the light of day
(everything else appeared a bizillion times, I never saw my own
post). If any of you already saw it, sorry for the waste of
bandwidth.

I was thinking about ways that piracy could work given a set of
initial conditions that includes:

Something like Bruce\'s DSR (ie: it\'s bloody hard to hide a starship)
Piracy will tend to happen in outlying worlds.

Here goes some of the ideas (I wish I remembered better :-)
The victim will be called the "target"--the pirates could be PCs or
it could be an encounter. 

- ----
A pirate ship bribes a sensor operator to cause a malfunction of an
outlying system\'s primary sensor array. By the time the distress
calls arrive (the operator obviously has to respond to this--a bribe
isn\'t worth _that_ much trouble) the pirates can board their target
and be off to a jump point. The malfucton might be well enough
planned that the operator might first vector defences the wrong
way.

- ----
A certain pirate has amazing computer skills. She manages to write a
virus that will reprogram the target\'s jump drive just as the
jumpspace entry sequence begins. There is a chance (very small) that
it will be noticed before, and a better chance it will be noticed at
the time of jump by the navigator, in the former case, it might be
avoided, in the latter at least the crew will know that they face a
problem on jump exit. The reprogrammed jump takes the target to a
distant point in-system--out where t-plates are ineffective. The
pirate ship has a reaction drive, and is waiting near the target
exit point. The target may have taken on a pirate or two as
passengers (probably the most likely way to infect the computer,
though they might have some access posing as ground crew of some
sort.

- ----
Some pirates basically don\'t *care* if they are detected. In fact, they
might broadcast a "heave to and prepare to be boarded" command to
the target--signed the Dred Pirate Roberts :-) The idea being that
they trash a few ships, and leave evidence of their ship to be found
so that word of their brutality is spread. They might get a merchant
to avoid the risk of death and abandon ship.

Some might carry (captured) small craft that they offer to the
target as lifeboats for cooperation. This would be to create a sense
in future victims that surrender is actually worth it.

- ----
On a related note, being detected has a few effects:
	1. The system defences are alerted (assuming they know you
	are a pirate simply by detecting you, or your vector)
	2. The system\'s flight controllers give a heads-up to
	potential targets.
	3. A would-be target might detect a ship on a closing
	vector. They are then alerted and can call for help/prepare
	for defensive action.

The pirate only cares if:
	1. He can\'t disable and board the target before help arrives.
	2. Known system defences are worth being afraid of.
	
So being detected might not prevent a pirate from trying in a
"normal" way. BTW, a pirate might assume a closing vector on the
world in question, and try to cripple a target leaving the world (or
the other way around).
- ----	

The (trite) false distress call. Pirate feigns distress. Usually
done with a pirate ship that is a merchant vessel. The good
samaritan gets shafted.
- ----

A cargo container is actually a kind of bomb. Knowing the specifics
of a common form of trading ship, a clever pirate has determined
that a directed attack from *within* the target can disable it.
Possibilities include: Massive fuel tank damage so that it can\'t
jump as planned, internal attack into engineering to cripple the
drives, or an attack on a critical control. It would have to be well
disguised, but an alert crew might well find it. The actual pirate ship
would be moving in such a way as to not attract attention, but would
happen to be close enough to the the first on the scene to render
"aid."
- ----

A pirate might be able to impersonate a system patrol ship in a
system that was enough of a backwater and get the target to actually
let them on board willingly!
- ----

The target\'s crew hears a rumor in a bar:
A "strange asteroid" that is in a highly inclined orbit. It\'s far 
enough away that it would usually be travelled as an in-system jump. 
Rumor has it that a local prospector determined that it is actually
a ship of some kind. Hints of ancient technology came out of the some
of his drunken drunken conversations. Unfortunately, the old prospector 
came back to resupply for the salvage, and was never seen again--a 
nearby merchant claimed that the jump flash was odd, so people assume 
a misjump. The problem is that there are a bunch of eccentric asteroids 
in this system and so far nobody has found it. 

The rumor was actually spread by a pirate. He had a belter ship work
the system for a while, then come back with images of this amazing
asteroid ship (Gateway, anyone :-). The old guy woouldn\'t tell anybody
*where* of course. The ship is sent out with a purposely damaged
drive so that it will misjump, with a characteristic jumpflash
(assuming you could tell this from a flash, but what the
heck--otherwise it just leaves the system, or meets the asteroid).
This all happens over several months, but this pirate is a good con
artist. He has gotten the locals to spread the rumor, and they all
claim firsthand knowlege of the guy!

The asteroid ship is real, but it\'s a pirate. Anybody who comes
looking will find it at some point. The powerplant is very well
masked, and the ship operates with minimal power--it is spinning
just fast enough for marginal "gravity" inside. Their victims are
expecting that it might even be powered from the rumors, and won\'t
be put off. They\'ll match courses, and leave themselves wide open.
- ----

That\'s all I can remember. It came from the piracy thread, and my
point was that DSR didn\'t kill piracy, it just forces pirates to be
more clever (they need to be regardless, IMHO).

  This has been commented on before; I believe Mr. Miller is aware of

Hmmmm....I don\'t know nothing about the Vilani, but i don\'t agree with
it. Vilani actually "should" be decomposed by some microorganisms, which
doesn\'t have anything to do with this feature of not getting sick.

As an almost biologist (biochemist last year student with hard biology
background) i think that Vilani, as any other self-aware species, has
evolved out of a huge number of species interacting between them,
changing to better fit their ecological "niches", and evolution
mechanisms (wich usually are blind and slow, except natural selection)
sure have found a way to get profit of a dead Vilani in the long history
of life in their homeworld (i suppose), sure there are microorganisms
that decompose other Vilani homeworld live beings that can decompose a
dead vilani.

I don\'t mean with this that, if a Vilani dies in another world than its
homeworld, could have been decomposed (sure it will, more or less fast,
but it will) as fast as a life-being native to that world, but sure a
vilani gets decomposed by, at least, second thermodinamics principle, as
an alive being is far away from equilibrium, only when they die they are
treated as any other thing : then the second principle "makes" its work,
that is, maximize the enthropy in that system. Microorganisms only
accelerate the process.

Comments well received.

Just for completeness - GURPS does it *both* ways (a bonus to the 
speciality and a penalty to everything else) for skills with optional 
specialisation, but skills like Engineering have mandatory 
specialisation and you get no benefit or penalty - they are effectively 
different skills.

	Interesting spin on things...  so when that last emperor was
screaming at the rot that had set in on his predecessors, it was more the
scream of anguish of someone finding mold in the fridge or beetles in his
cigars than of grief and horror over something disgusting happening to  a
beloved ancestor?  Chilling!

	I wonder how aging would affect taste in a decomposition-free
environment... hmmmmmm.

Just to add ...

As I understand it humans need much of the bacteria in their  GI-
tract to be healthy.  For example, when you  have  the  flu  (not
just a bad cold) you are weak and debilitated after  the  disease
is gone ... because you have flushed out  most  of  the  GI-tract
bacteria.  Eating yogurt speeds up recovery \'cos they  like  that
stuff even more than your body does.  Therefore, Vilani must have
a full compliment of internal bacteria.

Apparently if your bodies defenses failed suddenly  the  bacteria
in your GI-tract would consume you within 48  hours  (eating  you
from the inside out).  So, as your dead Vilani uncle  lies  there
on the slab his body defenses would start to  fail  and  his  GI-
tract would decompose his corpse.

There are things you can get  from  eating  people,  but  nothing
you\'d  want:  prion  diseases  (CJD,  BSE  or  "mad cow disease",
"laughing canibal", possibly Alzheimers, etc).  Of course you can
get these from other sources too, but recycling protein  includes
recycling bad protein (prion) as well.  The dangers of canibalism
preclude (IMHO) long-term wide-scale canibalism in a society  (as
opposed to ritual canibalism).

If there isn\'t a patrol vessel within response range, a distress signal

This won\'t work if there is a genuine patrol ship in the system and is

First of all, I don\'t think you are right, but I guess that reiterating all
those arguments would just be a tedious waste of time. But even if you had
been right, you\'ve still missed my point entirely. Two different world views
may be equally valid for two different universes, but they can\'t be valid at
the same time in the SAME universe. I don\'t need the approval of anybody to
use or not use anything in my game and I don\'t care much what other people do
in their universes, except that I\'d like to be allowed to copy anything that
I can use and put it into mine. But I do have an interest in making the OTU
as close to my liking as possible.

To me having a canon is a means to an end and not an end in itself. The end
that I desire is to have a game world where I can run the kind of adventures
I want to run and which supports the "willing suspension of disbelief"
necessary for me and my players to get into the spirit of things. Of the two,
the first is the most important, but the second is damn important to me too.

I therefore desire as much useful background material for my game universe
as possible. I have a limited amount of time for making up background and
adventures myself, so if I can get additional material from other people then
that is obviously a Good Thing. Provided I can use it, of course.

Now, there are three reasons why I may not be able to use outside material:
1) I have already established facts unique to my own TU that dosen\'t jibe
with the new material; 2) the new material does not fit with previously
published material which is now part of MTU; or, 3) the new material is
internally inconsistent.

In the first case I am, of course, just plain out of luck. Obviously I can\'t
expect total strangers to know (or care) what I\'ve established in my personal
TU. For instance, I needed information about the Trojan Reach and did a lot
of work based on the very scanty information I had at the time. Consequently
my Trojan Reach has a minor human race called the Troiani, a non-Aslan
Glorious Empire that is the remnant of a sector-spanning empire that
flourished two millenia ago, a Freedom League instead of a Florian League,
etc. etc. I have political maps of the Reach for every 30 years for almost a
millenium. I have maps of the Troiani and word generation tables for Troiani
languages. And a couple of months after I did all that work, the Travellers\'
Digest #20 brought the official Trojan Reach. Consequently I have to adapt
anything official set in the Trojan Reach to MTU, much to my dissatisfaction.
Despite that I wouldn\'t dream of suggesting that Marc scrapped the
information from TD#20 and substituted mine even though I do think my version
is better (Well, maybe not better, but just as good and far more detailed).

In the second case, however, I feel that I have a legitimate beef. IMO the
publisher of a game world has a moral obligation to keep it as consistent as
possible. Not a legal obligation, of course. I presume that Marc could
publish a fantasy RPG with a big empire, Zhodani sorcerer-kings, wolf-men
bandits, an elven tribe called the Darrians, etc., call it _Traveller 5_ and
be legally in the clear. But I for one would feel royally ripped off if he
did and I bought it, regardless of how good a FRPG it was. The same apply, to
a much lesser extent, of course, when something is published that dosen\'t
agree with previously published material.
        Mind you, I don\'t expect miracles. With scores of people working on a
shared universe for over 20 years, you can\'t expect every author to know of
every obscure piece of information. I\'m sure there are bits that even Marc
and Loren don\'t recall off-hand. But the fact that errors are unavoidable
dosen\'t mean that they shouldn\'t be corrected whenever they occur. On the
contrary, IMO it makes it all the more important that it is done. Remember
some of the adventures for T4 that was written by perfectly able RPG writers
whose grounding in the Traveller canon was less than might be desired? There
were several things that I couldn\'t use, not because they were bad in
themselves, but because they didn\'t correspond to reality in MTU. And if
those adventures are ever used as inspiration by some future writers, I won\'t
be able to use their adventures either. 

But if that\'s my attitude, why do I advocate changing SOME canonical facts?
That brings me to the third reason why I might not be able to use something:
If it dosen\'t make sense to me. I can\'t use a date for the discovery of a
planet in the Spinward Marches much later than 100, because I can\'t make
myself believe that the scouts could start exploring the Marches in 52 and
not do at least a flyby of each system as soon as possible. So it\'s no use
telling me that the Droyne of Andor weren\'t discovered until 802. I just
don\'t believe it. And I can\'t make myself believe that the Scouts could visit
the Sword Worlds in 53 and not visit the Darrians until 148 (The Sword
Worlders have known of the Darrians from the start; the Darrians are going to
be mentioned in hundreds of Sword World books and articles, not to mention
encyclopedias). Nor can I make myself believe in all those low pop systems
with Class A starports (That one is a bit tricky, because you might be able
to run a small shipyard with 60 people, provided you had an inordinate
degree of automation and imported all the subcomponents from another system.
But that just begs the question; why would anyone pay the extra expenses
that would entail? How does the shipyard compete at all? Such a shipyard
would require massive subsidies. So I might be able to justify any particular
such world, and maybe even two or three, by inventing some special political
circumstances. But I can\'t accept that there are so many of them).

It\'s not just a matter of wanting to get rid of the bits I don\'t like,
however. There are parts of the canon that I wish were different, but which
make sense to me. It\'s just not the way I would have done it. I wouldn\'t
dream of trying to get those changed.

So when I post something it is partly to let others benefit from my work (no
use duplicating effort; if someone can use something of mine, maybe he will
have time to work out something I can use), partly to get it checked for
logical and factual errors, and partly an attempt to influence future
Traveller writers to produce stuff I can use. Purely pragmatic. But it is not
for the purpose of forcing you or Gary or anybody else to play things my way.

    'body' => 'Here\'s an example of the kind of canon problems I talk about in a previous
post:

In _The Spinward Marches_ (1979) it is said that Winston, Entrope and
Anselhome are claimed by both the Darrians and the Sword Worlds. In _Library
Data (N-Z)_ (1982) it says that the Sword Worlders grabbed Terant 340,
Torment, Trifuge, and Cunnonic (which I\'ll call the Cunnonic worlds for short)
from the Darrians during the 1st Frontier War and lost them again in 788. No
mention of the Entropic worlds at all. In _Contact: The Sword Worlders_ from
JTAS#18 (1983) this is repeated and it is stated that this was the origin of
the tension between the Darrians and the Sword Worlders. Again, no mention of
the Entropic worlds at all.

But two years later, in _The Spinward Marches Campaign_ (1985) the historical
maps quite clearly show that the worlds fought over was the Entropic worlds
and that the Sword Worlds had lastly occupied them during the 4FW [*] and
that they had been recaptured by the Darrians during 5FW [**]. And two years
later, in _Darrians_ (1987), it was said that the Sword Worlds grabbed the
Entropic Worlds in 593  --  no mention of the Cunnonic worlds.

[*]  Text elsewhere in the same book says 3FW... Oops...
[**] UWPs in the same book show their allegiance code as Sw... Oops again...)

What happened? Did someone recall the old mention of rival claims to the
Entropic worlds and deliberately change the worlds in question from the
Cunnonic to the Entropic worlds? Or did someone just goof? I don\'t know. But
I do know that the Library Data from _LDNZ_ was copied verbatim to the MT
_Imperial Encyclopedia_ and again to _GURPS:Traveller_ while the version from
_SMC_ made it into the TNE _Regency Sourcebook_ and into _GURPS:Behind the
Claw_. So at the moment we have two alternate versions floating around. I
think that is a Bad Thing and I really think Marc and Loren should decide on
one version and stick to it forthwith.

[Because I like the historical maps and because of the early mention of rival
claims to the Entropic worlds my suggestion would be to say that the Entropic
Worlds (including Torment) were the four worlds lost by the Darrians in 593
and regained in 788. The Entropic Worlds (without Torment) were lost again
during the 4FW and regained during the 5FW. Any text that claims that it was
the Cunnonic worlds is in error. But I\'d also accept it if it was established
that is was the Cunnonic worlds and all talk of the Entropic worlds were
dropped. I\'d think it the poorer solution, but at least the crack would have
been patched over. The only thing I wouldn\'t accept would be to ignore it
(especially if accompanied by soothing words to the effect that I was free
to settle on one or the other in MY universe!)]

Just how well *is* the standard Free Trader armed IYTU, anyways?  Every LBB 
standard design I\'ve seen over 200 tons has half the allowable hardpoints.  
I.e., a 400 ton subbie has 2, a 600 ton liner has 3, etc.  A 400 ton Type P 
has 3 triple turrets.  Thus, ton for ton, it should be on par for merchant 
ships up to about 600 tons.  Perusal of HG & the MT rules suggest the same 
conditions.

I can see this happening in both cases.  Case A, the pirate ship simply sidles 
up toward the unsuspecting victim until it\'s within gun range, showing a 
\'local patrol\' or, even better, Imperial Navy transponder signal, then the 
victim gets hit.  I\'d lean toward the latter.  Now, it wouldn\'t be *necessary* 
for the pirate to slide deep insystem and thus within sensor range of the 
planet, which means, likely, it\'ll be able to pull this off.  Case B is 
similar, unless the ship *KNOWS* there\'s no regularly scheduled customs 
patrols in the area, in which case, there\'s liable to be intermittant patrols 
by the subsector navy, which the pirate can impersonate with a transponder.

Now, the 100 diameter limit on a Size 8 world is still a bit over 1.28 million 
klicks, if my math\'s correct (800,000 miles x 1.6 klicks/mile, right?).  
That\'s a radius.  This means any intercepting SDB is going to be at most, 2.5 
million klicks away if it cruises inside the 100 diameter limit.  2.5 million 
klicks is a good long way even at 6 G\'s.  Odds are, it\'ll be within the 1.28 
million klicks, but half the time, it\'ll be on the wrong vector to intercept.  
Assuming a standing start from orbit, it still takes a cruiser almost 3 hours 
to get to the 100 diameter limit.  Its top speed, assuming no turnaround for 
the midpoint, is on the order of 550 klicks/sec, unless I picked a decimal 
point wrong, meaning that its maximum engagement envelope would be half a 
million klicks radius at the outside, and engagement time of 90 minutes from 
target at best.  More likely times are 250,000 klicks and 60ish minutes for 
more accurate fire.  These times are times to close, not times from launch.  
This means, around a Size 8 planet, you should be able to get 2 hours to 
capture and loot a ship at the 100 diameter limit.  Odds are, the local ship 
will be under 1000 tons, thus, 10 turrets bearing.  2 hours should be enough 
time to board and possibly repair enough fire support on the target to help 
out in the upcoming fight.

I\'ve noticed the \'This isn\'t one of the ...\' response a lot.  What ever happened to the bit about \'These encounter tables are a suggestion until you get the chance to make your own\'?  Custom encounter tables do *not* contradict canon.

Any of these could be. You certainly don\'t show your players the
roll, right? Assuming they have any cargo or passengers, it could
always be retroactive (since by definition they don\'t know about a
hijacker/cargo bomb, whatever).

I realize some people might take the encounter tables literally, but
I was just throwing some ideas out there.

True enough in the first case. But in the latter case, it isn\'t
unnecessary, but it is _preferable_. A pirate wants his target
_intact_. More likely than not the ship is the most valuable asset
anyway. Engaging it in combat requires that you disable it. This
will make escaping with it difficult (possibly imposssible if you
trash the j-drive). It is aslo expensive since you\'ll have to fix
what you wreak.

Getting aboard your target without shooting is far and away a better
choice for any pirate.

As for the "not in the encounter table" comments, here is a
suggestion:

Come up with a range of plausable pirate scenarios for various
worlds (from high-pop centers of trade, to backwaters). Keep them in
your notebook. When you roll a pirate encounter on the ship
encounter table (which is obviously done in secret anyway) look at
the world where your players are, and say to yourself, "is a
straight pirate ship encounter actually likely/possible here?" If
not, grab one of your preplanned pirate scenarios that fits and use
that instead. Obviously some that I posted actually need a setup
before hand, but many do not. Make some more that don\'t if it\'s a
big worry. 

BTW, 4 of the 7 pirate encounters in B2 are pirates posing as patrol
ships. The best starport type to get a pirate encounter is C, and I
somehow doubt that the patrol ploy will work in many C-starport
systems (that is the only pirate encounter for a C starport). The
bottom line is that you need to customize the tables from time to
time.

	No FORMAL limit ... i.e. there\'s no rule that says "You can\'t build
ships any larger than X."  However, surface area imposes a practical
upper limit ... eventually you won\'t be able to fit everything that
must go on the surface, such as radiators, jump grid, weapons, etc ...

Even riskier if that SDB you missed on your last sensor sweep responds to
the distress call at full (6g) throttle and comes into sensor range just as
you open fire.

If a SDB shows up on my sensor sweep inbound at 6G, you bet your anatomy I\'m 
heading out to safe jump distance before he can close and shoot, unless his 
transponder says I\'ve got more guns at my command than he does.

Odds are, he\'s coming at me from the planet, since it\'s the most central point 
where piracy will be at.  AAMOF, I\'m crunching some numbers on most likely 
incidents under HG & LBB2, and the numbers are *VERY* interesting.  And 
methinks a pirate *can* escape at range from an inbound hostile, I\'m just not 
sure at what range the pirate can detect him at.  I\'ll post my math later when 
I get them in line.  Methinks some people might rethink their positions on 
things once they read the numbers and weep.

But they aren\'t the same universe.  We make great use of "IMTU" for In My
Traveller Universe, just because everyone is going to alter the canonical
setting their liking.  If we were arguing the current deployment of the
United states Navy, we could get hard facts.  But we are discussing a
fictional environment.  No matter how hard you try, there will always be
some room for disagreement.

Why?  I\'m pretty safe in assuming that my particular vision of the Third
Imperium is quite different from what you, or anyone else plays.  I\'m
perfectly satisfied to use the common background and information and graft
it onto my vision of a weak Imperium, where the Navy struggles to meet it\'s
obligations.  As written, the background can support this milieu; it also
supports the image of a powerful, omnipresent Navy and Imperial flags on
every flagpole.

To be honest, your image of the Imperium is pretty boring in my opinion.
That\'s just a matter of taste.  But some of your ideas would, for me and my
players make adapting the official material that much harder if adopted.

Agreed.  Yet you seem to be unable to understand that others want to run
adventures using the same setting, but from a different angle.

Agreed.  I\'m one of the many Greyhawk fans who are happy to see that the
latest version is making a valiant attempt to clean up the setting to make
it coherent throughout.

Here\'s where we take different routes.  Rather than refusing to accept the
date, I try to make a plot hook out of it.  *Why* didn\'t anybody find those
Droyne?  Hmmm..  Adventure 4 had a rumor about a scout in the Outrim
finding himself jumping for home with no memory of the previous two weeks.
Maybe the Droyne planted false memories in the Scouts, and sent them on
their way.  Maybe the weren\'t ready to be found..  what were they trying to
cover up?  Why does Five Sisters have so many Navy bases?  Why are Candor
and Andory interdicted?  Rather than a discrepancy, I see a great campaign!

As for things being discovered.. San Francisco Bay, one of the world\'s best
natural harbors, was sailed past numerous times by European explorers.
They just didn\'t see any point exploring what appeared to be a small inlet.
 It was finally discovered by land.

"What\'s beyond our borders?  Well, there\'s a terrible group of barbarians
to spin.  Horrible people.  They massacre prisoners, refuse all diplomatic
contact.  We can, of course provide relevant stellar cartography data for
you, but my advice is to avoid the area unless you have a lot more firepower."

Books and encyclopedias?  From what I had read and seen as a child and
teenager, I expected to see strutting soldiers the first time I went to
Germany.  Almost everything I had read focused on WWII, or on cultural
events that had little or no relation to everyday life.  Asking the Sword
Worlds about the Darriens would be like asking the Soviet Union about the
United States.

I have a quick fix.  I just assume that those worlds are a source of
lanthanum.  Since the planet has a ready supply, they meet the "starship
construction" criteria.

Another thing to consider is that you\'ll need a licence from Marc to start
publishing it.

And as someone said -  "The easisest way to make a small fortune in the

I took advantage of GZG selling starter packs (I don\'t know if Geohex do
this in the US). It cost 20 GBP and included FT rules, and two cruiser
based groups (9 figs each). They also do packs based on a carrier group
(with escorts) and a battlegroup (BB, BC, ECs etc). All about the same
number of figures and £15 GBP ea IIRC

I like their minis - the NAC (Anglo American)stuff is kind of \'Paramount
Famous Sci-Fi\' series enspired, the NSL (German) is kind of like the B5
Omegas and Novas, the ESU (French/Italian) is very like the Star Destroyers
in star wars. They\'re not bad, but some needed a little extra finishing.
The new Oceanic Union stuff is interesting too.... There are a couple of
other forces, but I don\'t use them as yet.

Nice - are you going to post the USP?

I went for a few big secondaries in mine, and no black globe as it\'s a Zho

I\'m sure the numbers will show that. However, being on both ends of such an
attempt (player and referee) you\'ve got to watch out for all those wild
hairs your referee gets. Likely, the SDB that responds the time you try it
will be one that\'s at full velocity already in transit retuning from or
outbound to another mission. Always assume your referee is going to add as
much spice to your life as possible.

It is an Imperial design. As for the globe\'s, they found 2000 of them on
Knorbes... I can always delete the globe if the referee and/or the scenario
mandates it. Otherwise I will delete it over my dead body...:-) . Seriously,
HG makes globes and capacitors so powerful that they are worth every
centicredit they cost (in this case 1000 MC\'s for the globe, and 2000MC\'s for
500 capacitors).

Per HG 2nd Ed, pg 31:

"Black globe generators are not available commercially; they are recovered 
artifacts installed on a makeshift basis or esperimental versions installed on 
tech level 15 Imperial warships.  The force field table shows the USP code, 
tech level, tonnage, and price required.  Black globes have no energy point 
cost.  Devices shown at tech level 15 are used by the Imperium; those at 
higher tech levels are shown for reference.

The aquisition of any black globe generator is probably the result of a lucky 
find on the part of a government, individual, or corporation."

Per \'Adventure 12: Secrets of the Ancients\', pg 14:

"Black Globes:  Rarely do excavations of Ancient sites produce working 
artifacts.  One site proved to be a treasure trove with more than 2,000 
operating black globe generators almost waiting to be installed on Imperial 
ships.  Black globes typify the incomprehensible artifacts of the Ancients: 
each of the devices found is a small metal device measuring about 300 cm on a 
side with a shiny metal finish.  Two minor discolorations on the surface are 
the on and off switches.

When the device is activated, it projects a black force field in a sphere 
around the device at a radius of about one meter.  In the first experiments 
with the device, a researcher was cut in half by the force field when he 
touched the switch; in the second, it was activated remotely by a rod.  Both 
of the black globes could not then be turned off because the off switch was 
inside the force field."

Now, the *only* way I can see a globe throwing a field of a bit less than a 
meter radius around a warship that is *WAY* over a meter long is if the device 
somehow can sense if something is mechanically and electrically connected to 
the generator.  Otherwise, there\'d be a pile of Imperial boats with 2 meter 
wide holes in them that can\'t be removed.

Personally, I wonder what would happen if somebody actually *TOUCHED* an 
active black globe.  Woudl it suck all the energy out of them and kill them 
instantly?

No doubt.  But the numbers so far say, at 6G\'s accelleration from a Size 8 
planet, running flat out to the 100 diameter limit, maximum engagement 
envelope is 15 minutes from the edge of the envelope at 500K klicks, where 
you\'ll be shooting at some SEVERE disadvantages, and only 7.5 minutes at 
merely long range, 250K klicks.  Your terminal velocity is 550 KPS, then you 
get to turn around, try and get a snapshot off in 15 mins at extreme range, 
and decellerate, coming to rest 1.28 million klicks out.  *THEN* you get to 
accellerate back for the 640K klicks to turn around, and *decellerate* again 
the remaining 640K klicks to finally come to rest relative to the disabled 
ship, 6.15 hours later.  I make it, 1 good shot at range heading out, and a 
couple good shots coming back, *IF* the bad guys are still there.

Now, the \'bad guys\' can get up to 2.3 hours to loot and scoot, *OR* do some field repairs to weapons systems and such to increase their offensive capabilities *OR* repair the drives enough to jump.  2.3 hours is 6.9 combat turns.  They\'ll be making the 7th repair attempt as the protector gets in range.  If the locals decide they want to be at rest relative to the target ship on the first pass so they can pound it to slag, you get on the order of 11 combat turns for repairs to the target.  A crew can attempt 1 repair per combat turn of 20 minutes.

Assuming the first case, a flyby at 550 kps, the bad guys get their 7 repair attempts max before being engaged, *then* get on the order of 18 *more* before they have to worry about the locals coming back to shoot them to dust.  All in all, I\'d call it a liveable chance.  Hey, if you\'re gonna make the big money, you gotta take the big chance.

As for ref specials thrown at you, the numbers don\'t support it.  If the SDB is already in motion, most likely it\'s heading in the wrong direction.  It\'s going to take *time* for it to stop and manuver back at you.  If it *is* heading your direction, it just closes faster.  But this means, it takes *LONGER* for it to get back to you, and they *still* get only 1 shot at you in passing.  Either way, all you have to do is live through *1* combat turn and you\'re home free.

Now what I want to see is, the odds of a ship coming in at high speed aquiring you when you pull *real* close to the crippled boat, say, on the order of 10 meters or less, and set your power plant for hot standby with enough charge in your lasers for the one shot *you\'ll* get when they pass.  If the crippled ship is the one throwing out all the neutrinos, odds are, *it\'s* the ship that\'ll be targetted and shot at.  I\'d give it a 50-50 chance, and I\'ll take either end of the bet.

Finally, the two most common ships that most likely would do the intercept would be either a Dragon-class SDB or a Gazelle-class Close Escort.  HG weapons factors vs a generic Type P corsair with either of these ships indicate no critical hits using the HG combat system.  Somehow, I *don\'t* see a Type P being chased by a Tigress-class battleship, if for no other reason than the Tigress would be abandoning its post to do the intercept.

All in all, the numbers suggest that hoisting the Jolly Roger could be highly profitable, if done correctly, but more on *THAT* in a future post.  <grin>

Hmmm... weapons surface area could be eliminated by using deep meson guns.
Some commo could be moved internal using meson comms. Reduce the PEMS and
AEMS arrays by using folding arrays. In theory, large enough bay doors
could have other surface features affixed.

So, techheads one and all, how much could we do with, oh, say 10MTd (assume
max jump matched to max G to avoid solving for two variables) ???

IIRC, the human body contains enough microfauna to make a pretty good
start at decomposing, and unless your Vilani colony was subsisting on
canned food they\'d have some form of farming going (even if it was protein
and yeast vats). Eating, on the other hand, makes perfect sense. Maybe not
directly, but after a short trip through the ecosystem...

Odd how the NRA never mentions incidents like these...


Was browsing the UN web site preparing background material for a class,
and noticed that the figures for "Intentional homicide" in the USA top
those of Canada, Jamaica, and Costa Rica (the four countries the kids are
working on). I knew that America was more violent than here, but I\'m
always hearing about how violent Jamaica is from Jamaican friends. I
wonder if the American public is just accustomed to the level of violence,
in the same way that they are to the level of traffic deaths?

ObTrav: I think this can relate to starship armament. Possibly Imperials
regard arms on merchants the same way most Americans regard handguns: as a
right and necessary protection. Sure, the IN could stamp out piracy if all
ships were disarmed, but that would be as unthinkable as disarming all
Americans. Thoughts?

Can\'t remember who owns it offhand, but the same chap owns (or owned) the
Martian Metals 15mm mini molds and the rights to the FASA Traveller
material. 

He was interested in selling them 9 years ago when we last talked. Don\'t

Yes we do. We are located at 		www.boscos.com

but the game minis are not listed on the web site so it might be more
effective to send an email to us at	mailorders@boscos.com

Inquiring about what we have.

IIRC all we have left are about 1 each of about 7 RAFM minis.  We ship

...and the above is why I have in the past, and will in the future
say "phooey to canon."  It\'s a game...and we all play in our own
TU\'s whether we follow published material to the letter, just keep
to the spirit, or go off completely on our own.  Keep official,
orthodox, canonical *fever* out of this!

But, some people will *always* try to make their vision of
"Traveller Universes" <intoning from on high> THE OFFICIAL TRAVELLER
UNIVERSE, and I don\'t like that.  Hey, I don\'t like it when Marc,
Dave, or Loren do it, how much less do you think I like it when
anybody else does?  

IMO, if you require too much detail *officially* you end up
straight-jacketing GMs, and I don\'t like that.  Keep *required*
details to a minimum, let each GM fit material into their universe
the way they see fit.

Don\'t take published material to be "revealed truth", it isn\'t.
Encounter tables are suggestions, not set in stone.  Library and
"historical" data should *always* be "subject to GM manipulation."
Published adventures, rumors, star charts and UWP\'s for planetary
systems should be "adventure seeds" to stimulate the GM and players
and help them create their own game universes through play.

And lack of time is NOT a valid excuse to force others to play in some
pre-generated, structured ficton.  If you don\'t have the time to do
the work of a GM, then...<sputter, sputter...I WON\'T say it!>...then
use someone else\'s work, but don\'t try to enshrine *their* work
because *you* didn\'t do it.

<arrgh!! ribble! rattle! skerrrt! pant...pant...pant!  Where are
those pills?>

But, hey!  Don\'t mind me, I\'m just making my obligatory, once every
six months, anti-canon declaration, so that I can remain...

Frankly, I think ancestor worship based on ritual cannibalism makes
sense for cultures like the Vilani.  They might reason that they
could preserve the wisdom, strength and knowledge of their ancestors
by ingesting their flesh.  Whether this custom would persist in
reality, or become symbolic is another question.

    'from' => 'jamstar@glasscity.net',
    'body' => 'OK, here\'s the numbers I promised earlier today.  First, assumptions.

1.  Target world is Size 8 (8000 mile diameter).  This puts the 100 diameter 
jump limit at 1,280,000 klicks.
2.  Target ship is intercepted and disabled right at the 100 diameter jump 
limit.
3.  Pirate ship is assumed to be a Type P as per Supplement 4: Citizens of the 
Imperium.  Refered to as \'intruder\'.  For purposes of this post, this boat is 
considered to be stock as per Supplement 4: Citizens of the Imperium, with the 
exception that all triple turrets have been fully utilised with beam lasers.  
Hey, it\'s only another 6 MCr.  If you\'ve got a 180 MCr boat, you\'ll spend the 
money.  Otherwise, you\'re wasting your time.
4.  Local patrol ship is either a 400 ton Dragon-class SDB or a 400 ton Close 
Escort of either Gazelle Class or the Fiery Class variant.  Refered to as 
\'defender\'.  For the purposes of this post, these boats are considered stock 
as per Supplement 6: Traders & Gunboats.
5.  System for determination is High Guard and LBB2 (Starships) from Classic 
Traveller.  Reasoning behind this is, I\'m most familiar with this ruleset.  
Not having the errata, I\'m still having major difficulty figuring out 
MegaTraveller\'s ship design and combat systems.  (How in the *HELL* can you 
figure out how much power you\'re going to need *until* you figure out what 
kind of weapons requirements and M-drive power consumption you\'ll be dealing 
with.  This one\'s got me baffled, kids...)
6.  Per LBB2, \'extreme range\' is 500,000 klicks and \'long\' range is 250,000 
klicks.
7.  Per both HG and LBB2, a combat turn is 20 minutes.  (Actually, it\'s closer 
to 16 minutes [1000 seconds])
8.  Defender starts in orbit around the planet.  Defender is also assumed to 
be rounding the planet and pointing at the intruder, thus rendering the orbit 
height and planet\'s radius irrelevant.
9.  All attacks are at the USP value of the battery firing, *not* the USP 
value of the boat at large.  While this isn\'t \'really\' covered by HG rules, 
this *does* make sense.  A ship with Factor 8 beam lasers has 10 full triple 
turrets.  If these turrets are being used as 1 battery, then yeah, I can see 
using the USP value.  However, if each turret is its own battery, this allows 
a +5 DM on each of the 10 attacks, which, IMNSFBHO, borders on munchkinism.  
The USP value of 1 triple beam missile turret is 3, *NOT* 8.  10 seperate 
attacks will *equal* 1 combined attack, not multiply it.  This repairs a minor 
\'break\'.

Intruder\'s ship is 400 tons (Size code 4), with Factor 4 beam lasers 
configured as 3 batteries of Factor 3.  It\'s one laser shy of Factor 5.  
Computer is a Model 2.  It has Factor 0 armour.

Defender A is the Dragon SDB, 400 tons (Size Code 4), Factor 4 beam lasers 
configured as 2 batteries of Factor 3 and Factor 3 missiles configured as 2 
batteries of Factor 2.  Computer is a Model 5.  The boat has Factor 9 armour.

Defender B is the Gazelle, 400 tons (Size 4), with Factor 4 beam lasers 
configured as 2 batteries of Factor 3 and Factor 2 particle accellerator 
barbettes configured as 2 batteries of Factor 1.  Computer is a Model 6.  The 
boat is armoured to Factor 3.

Now the math.  First the Dragon, approaching as in Assumption 8.

To get to safe jump distance from a Size 8 world at 6G\'s without a midpoint 
turnover takes 153 minutes, or 7.65 combat turns.  End velocity is 550 km/sec. 
 The defender enters the 500K klick extreme range envelope at 138 minutes and 
traverses it in 15 minutes.  It enters the 600K detection limit at 135 
minutes, if the intruder is powered up beyond \'quiet\' levels.  If the intruder 
is running at quiet levels, the defender is unable to lock on until it is 
within 300K klicks, leaving 9.1 minutes to lock solutions and fire at point 
blank range.  Once locked on, the defender can track up to 900K klicks, 
although past 250K klicks it will be shooting at extreme range and thus under 
extreme penalties.  This suggests that the SDB will take *one* shot at point 
blank range for each of 4 batteries.

With a midpoint turnover, the SDB arrives at rest with the intruder at 216 
minutes or 10.8 combat turns, a difference of 63 minutes, or 3 combat turns.  
It enters the 500K extreme range envelope with 96 minutes to rest, or 4.8 
combat turns.  It enters the 250K long range envelope at 68 minutes to rest, 
or 3.4 combat turns.  The second solution offers more immediate opportunities 
for fire and is likely to be the one used, as the flyby allows *1* shot only 
due to range constraints.  The \'slow solution\' allows the defender within 
range .2 combat turns earlier and allows 4 shots per battery during the 
closure.

At extreme or long range, the beam lasers have a -1 to hit.  Further 
modifications are:

+ relative computer size (5-2=3)
- - target agility rating (assumed to be 0)
+ target size modifier (Size 4 is a -1)

Thus, at long range, the lasers only have +2 to hit.  Factor 3 lasers hit on 7 
or better, with the DMs, these lasers hit on 5 or better on 2D6.  At close 
range, this drops to 4.  Once the lasers are considered to hit, we then roll 
for penetration.  Since defender has no sandcasters, any roll of 4 or better 
on two dice penetrates, with relative computer size as a DM.

Missiles use the same DMs to hit, except they\'re +0 at long range and -1 at 
short.  Versus Factor 3 lasers in point defense mode, the Factor 2 missiles 
need 4 or better to hit and 3 to penetrate.

For the Gazelle, the approach times to intercept are left to the student as an 
exercise.  Remember to calculate them at 4G\'s, not 6.  Its lasers hit on 4 or 
better and penetrate on 3 or better.  For the PA\'s, a hit is scored on 6 or 
more, and penetrate on 7 or better.

As far as damage goes, according to HG, it is *impossible* for any weapon 
under Factor 9 to score a critical hit or interior explosion due to the +6 DM 
added to the damage roll.  Since the lowest roll necessary for an interior 
explosion is a natural 5, this leaves only fuel, manuver, or weapon hits for 
the surface explosion tables and computer and weapon hits on the radiation 
damage for the Gazzelle PA\'s.  Weapon hits are inconsequential, as they can 
either be repaired while in jump space or at the next port of call.  Likewise, 
Fuel-x hits, since they only take out x% of your total fuel.  If you take say 
5% fuel loss, you can still jump out and find some place to refuel before your 
M-drive runs out of power.  You have a 1 in 6 chance of losing a point of 
M-drive.  Your power plant will be unaffected, as will your crew.  If you\'re 
attacked by a Gazelle, then you\'ll have to worry about computer hits.  If 
you\'re being attacked by a Dragon, you won\'t need to worry.

Recapping everything, the intruder should have no less than 2 hours to loot & 
scoot *OR* field repair the victim enough to move it out beyond the 100 
diameter limit and jump, based on the above assumptions.  All in all, I\'d say 
this means that piracy is viable after all, wouldn\'t you?

I can see this as a Good Thing.  If you make a ruling one way one time, the 
rule should apply the same manner the *next* time, too.  Consistency is the

The laser figures for either the Gazelle or the Dragon are also relevant for 
the Type P as well.  This means, the crippled ship is going to be missing some 
fuel or need M-drive repairs.  Its weapons will also be disabled.  This means 
that the prize crew most likely will opt to restore the M-drive, take the boat 
over the 100 diameter limit, and jump to a predetermined location to meet up 
with the Type P again.  It makes the most sense.  And they *do* have those 2 
hrs+ to do it in.  That\'s 6 attempts to field repair the M-drive.  However, 
the roll to repair the system doesn\'t take into account any Engineering 
skills.  Methinks it should.  Quickie \'instant rule\':  add all Engineering 
skills together, divide by the number of the prize crew.  Round to the nearest 
whole number.  That\'s the DM on the repair roll.  As is, a roll of 9+ repairs 
the system in question.

there, and I even recognised the thumbprint of Lance S. Winkel (LSW) on the
computer-rendered starships. Fantastic work on the layout and "feel" of the
book - this is wonderful!

Interesting to see that the subsectors are detailed in the same order as in
"Supp 3: The Spinward Marches" - was this the working model?  ;-)

As to the disjointed sector map at the back - an angled watermark across
the back of each subsector may have been better - but I DON\'T CARE! The
Marches are BACK! This is one of those "must have" items for ANY Traveller
campaigns - 5 stars!

The site looks good.  It is nice to see someone build a graphics lite site.

This is good!  I have a couple questions on the above material though...

Correct me if I\'m wrong, but I thought the factors as listed in the USP
were _only_ the factors of the weapons as they were organized into
batteries.  I\'ve never heard counting the total number of weapons and
figuring the USP factor from that.

If I was running a canonical campaign, logically only vital ships would be
lucky enough to have a globe. As an example, I would put a globe on the
tenders, since they can cover the riders while they are embarked. There
wouldn\'t be enough to go around to install on the riders however. I would also
put them on main combatants. I figure that there would be enough globes to arm
one battleship equipped batron per sector. In this case I would put them on
Tigress\'s. A half million ton ship with a globe...grrr... I would also
consider putting them on a couple of jump 5 and 6 heavy cruiser raiders if
there were enough extra globes. As an example in the Marches, I would have a
jump 4 tender and a jump 6 tender globe equipped. I would have a Tigress
Batron globe equipped (preferably the full 8 ship squadron mentioned in
supplement ), and the four AHL\'s in the Marches. This is 14 globes for one
sector.

That is correct.  It will be harder for the pirate to hit due to his computer. 
 Now, if he upgrades it to a Model 5 or 6, things begin to look up for him.

Of course, refs out to severely punish piratical players will quadruple up on SDB attacks, or else send multikiloton ships after them.  Hey, it\'s only numbers on a piece of paper, right?  It\'s not like this is the *real* world now, is it?

OK, look at the chart.  6 beam lasers are needed to get to Factor 4.  These 
are split up into 2 or more turrets.  If you\'ve got triple turrets, there\'d be 
3 lasers in each.  According to the chart, 3 lasers is Factor 3.  This is why 
I came up with the idea of each battery using the USP code of the number of 
weapons.  If both turrets were configured as 1 battery, it would attack as 
Factor 4.  Now, the rules as they stand say, if you break those 6 lasers down 
into 2 batteries, *each* battery can fire as Factor 4, even though there are 
only enough lasers in the battery to fire as Factor 3.  By the rules, if you 
have 6 lasers, overall you have Factor 4.  See?

Looks good so far.  I especially like the Feedback Submission Form (I\'m
using this forum instead, to get TML feedback on my feedback).  A couple
of minor changes you may want to make:

1.  <nit> Include GURPS Traveller in your home page\'s listing of
Traveller editions. </nit>

2.  IMHO, listing the titles by game version would be more helpful (and
readable).  That way, I don\'t have to wade through listings of versions
that don\'t relate to my game.

3.  As you develop the Game Background portion of the site, it would be
useful to cross-link to the game product that relates to the topic under
discussion.  That would steer the visitor to the source material
he/she/it would use for further details.

As someone else already posted, I like the graphics-light approach. 
However, since you aren\'t going for eye candy, you might want to add
your name to the Meta list, and otherwise emphasize that this is _your_
Traveller site.  To quote John Adams from the musical "1776", "After
all, man, you\'re the one who wrote it."

Even the stock ship encounter tables have pirates in them.  So they\'re there.  Has the world come to an end?  No.  Is it a bit trickier to run around with pirates out there?  Yup.  But like I said earlier today, if you wants the big money, you takes the big risks.  No free lunches.  <grin>

Best place I\'ve viewed the stars is about 50 to 60 knotical(?) miles off the
west coast off BC/Wash. State. (being in the Navy, I\'m out there 2 or 3 time
a month). The "Old Man" like to describe the view as diamonds on black

the best systems to engage in it can\'t be hit _too_ often, or the
Imperial Navy will get involved.

So the backwater system that rates a few SDBs and Gazelles might
find a destroyer or two hanging around if piracy becomes too
rampant.

Also, if the pirate can take the SDBs, it isn\'t always a good idea
to do so. Reducing system defences doesn\'t please the Navy.

I might expect pirates to have turfs because of this. If a new
pirate were to come in and take advantage of a system\'s weak
defences for too long, the regulars would suffer--I might expect
that pirates new to a territory might find themselves under harsher
attack from other pirates then the weak SDBs :-)

This also backs up the notion that more complicated scenarios need
to be played out since it looks better for the pirates if ships
disappear due to apparent malfunction rather than foul play.

The Vargr worlds are probably where a good deal of stolen ships are
sold (much like the fact that most 4x4s stolen here (in New
Mexico) end up south of the border).

Combine this with Shugilli secrecy and you get an interesting way of
presenting important banquets ("Why do they call this \'Kagiigu Soup\',
wasn\'t that the name of the old president?  I did know he could cook".
"Oh, he cooked up just fine.").
This also fits with the "they could preserve the wisdom, strength and
knowledge of their ancestors by ingesting their flesh" idea from Eris.  If
you only ate the best and the brightest you would minimize the down side of
cannibalism, transfer your ancestors\' powers to you, and get a tasty meal
(relative to what they are used to eating, I have no first hand knowledge
of long pork).

However, what I had really wanted to know was whether Vilani that had no
contact with Solomani would build tombs.  If their dead stuck around, well
preserved and such, then no.  No need to hide dear uncle Eneri.  But the
intestinal fauna eating through the abdomen is too much for me.  Tombs it
is, nobody is going to want to see uncle Eneri with that happening.

There is another way to get "easy" food for pre-Solomani Vilani.  Milk.
Female mammals who have given birth produce milk.  This production will
continue for as long as the milk is "taken."  This applies to humans.
What is the status of gender equity among traditional Vilani?  Would women
be looked down upon, or up to because they could produce the only food that
doesn\'t need a Shugilli to prepare?  Or is this a Shugilli secret too?
Would a whole class/cohort/section of women be used for milk production?
Of course, I think I\'d hold off on ordering a cheese sandwich until I got
back into Solomani territory.

   Argh!  Of course the US is going to have a higher incidence of gun
violence.  Then again let\'s look at the *real* reason why...

   Jamaica - Population: 2,615,582 (July 1997 est.)
   Canada - Population: 30,337,334 (July 1997 est.) 
   Costa Rica - Population: 3,534,174 (July 1997 est.) 
   United States - Population: 267,954,764 (July 1997 est.) 

   I would expect, knowing nothing else about the countries in question,
that the US would have over 86 percent more incidents of gun violence than
all of those countries *combined*.  Also, Canada and Costa Rica are famous
for their across the board below average crime rates--this is a cultural
phenomenon that has nothing whatsoever to do with the number of firearms
present in those countries.  As a rule however, lower crimes rates mean
less incidents of gun violence.  In the regions of the US where gun control
is the strictest, crime rates are higher, as are incidents of gun violence.
 In cities and states where laws against concealed carrying of firarms by
law abiding citizens have been relaxed, the crime rate (and the gun
violence rate) has gone down.  This is *not* just in one or two cities or
states, but in *every* city and state where it has been done.

   Gun control is a topic best left in the TML closet with near C-rocks,
Virus, and pirates in the heart of Imperial space c.1107.

ObTrav: The level of starship weaponry would depend upon the era of the
Imperium you are talking about.  My guess is that all ships are
manufactured with hardpoints (minimum 1 per 100 ton), but at the height of
the Imperium few commercial vessels would feel the need to install weapons
in them if they were strictly going to be trading in Core sector.  Ships
nearer the frontiers would have at least some rudimentary armament
(standard lasers), and ships operating as interface vessels with worlds
outside the Imperium and vessels engaging in the highly speculative cargo
trade (legal and illegal) would be armed to the teeth.  This would be
particularly true of vessels which routinely operated near Vargr space.

Why can\'t we say _both_ are correct ?

The three books that state the Cunnic worlds are those based on the
reportage
from Sworld Worlder\'s, and the other that from the Darrians.

In fact,  _both_ lots of swapping occurred, but because one lot
makes the Darrian\'s
look bad and vice versa, each side refuses to acknowledge one set of
exchanges

Frankly, I _like_ canon to be inconsistent, it makes it much more
realistic.

We can\'t get consistent "canonical" reportage on what happened in
the Gulf
two years and half a planet a way, how can you expect the Imperium
to get it right
over several planets, more years, and many parsecs away ?

Greg Stafford has purposely done this to the Glorantha "canon" for a
similar
reason.

   Oh it\'s much worse than that.  It is my understanding Rodger went around
to several former Traveller publishers obtaining rights to publish their
old material.  So far as I know he is still sitting on those rights today.

   It is my understand that Bryan Borich is working on a project to get the
old GDW CT material on CD, so you may want to check with him.

   It can be made to work and be profitable *if* you own the rights to what
you are publishing.  Otherwise, license fees will generally make it a break
even proposition.

   You aren\'t the problem.  Rodger is for holding out, and the current
system is because it does not foster entrepeneurs who want to publish but
can\'t justify the time/expense/aggravation when all they are going to do is
break even.

  If the victim has enough firepower to be a significant factor in a

  Given that these are the only possible damage results, how was the

No, there would be 2.1m diameter tubes cut through them if some way to
adjust the radius. IMTU, it\'s simply running a current propotional to the
diameter (.001amp per meter, 5v)... for a 1/10th second pulse... normal
static discharges can exceed that.... except in clean rooms or vacc suits.
Same pulse in reverse polarity turns it off.

Same thing that happens to missiles, MG slugs, and microasteroidal bodies:
convert subatomic bonding forces into electricity, which is fed back
through the contacts (hope you\'ve got some excellent diode systems!) to the
ship... once the onboard is full.

IIRC i heard that in an experiment, if newborn lab rats where given birth by caesarian in sterile conditions, and from now on where maintained in sterile conditions, they died early from intestinal problems as they were absolutely
sterile, devoid of ANY other lifeform in their intestine, their skin... Usually lactance provides not only milk from the mother, but also is a contact with microorganisms that will settle into their gastric system.

So i think that, at least lab rats, have coevolved long enough with these microorganisms to be absolutely dependant of them for their survival.

Yup. Incidentally, using Bruce\'s DSR, an EMM masked ship doing aggressive
baffling against the planet can probably lurk indefinitly at this distance
in a dusty system, assuming a vaguely reasonable planetary sensor array.

You design around capability - start with the concept \'I want a 4G
interceptor with 10cm of superdense mounting a 600 MJ laser\', and then
figure out size, power requirements and so on. Use rules of thumb for
surplus power (20 MW is a good round number for a small ship). Works for me

I have just assumed that if the Defender gets into decent gun range of the
Intruder, it\'s a draw or worse for the Intruder. It\'s harder to make money
as a Pirate when you are facing combat repair bills.

Where this falls apart is first you have to be close enough to your Target
to jump it.

Now, Targets either come out at a preplanned jump point, or they come out
somewhere along the edge of the 100 diameter sphere.

If Targets come out at a known jump point, the pirate is screwed, because
that is where the SDB is.

If they come out somewhere at the 100 diameter limit, the question then
becomes \'Can the Intruder get to and match velocities with the Target,
before the Defender can get into gun range\'.

Now, we will assume that the Target stops immediatly when ordered to by the
Intruder, so the Intruder\'s formula is di=0.5*ai*ti^2.

The Defender\'s formula is dd=0.5*ad*td^2.

DD is 1 280 000 km. AI is 0.03 (3 gees). AD is 0.04 (4 gees). For the
moment, I will ignore either the Defender or the Intruder having to slow
down their straight-line acceleration to dodge from fire from the other.

Let us assume the Pirate takes 30 minutes to close, board and loot or
refuel and jump out as appropriate. Therefore, if TP is 1800 less than TI,
then the Intrder wins.

Let us assume the Pirate starts 100 000km from the Target, so they get 50
000km to accelerate, then the slow down to match velocities at the at-rest
Target.

Therefore, 50 000 = 0.5 * 0.03 * ti^2, or TI = 1825s. Therefore, the Pirate
will take 30 minutes to accelerate, then 30 minutes to decelerate.

Now, lets see how far the Defender can go in 60 minutes.

DD=0.5*0.04*3600^2 ... DD=259 200 km. Not a problem for the Pirate.

Now, we have another 30 minutes to loot.

DD = 0.5*0.04*5400^2 ... DD = 583 200 km. Still not a problem.

Now, let us assume the Pirate starts 300 000km from the Target.

150 000 = 0.5 * 0.03 * TI^2 ... TI = 3162 s. Therefore the Pirate will take
52 minutes to accelerate, then 52 minutes to decelerate. Lets see how far
the Defender goes in 6200 seconds ...

DD therefore equals 0.5*0.04*6200^2, or 768 800km. This is approximatly
gunnery range, and the Pirates have not begun to board. At this point the
Defender is closing the range at about 250 km/s, so if the Pirate takes
it\'s 30 minutes to loot the target, then the Defender will be within about
75 000 km, assuming that it cuts the acceleration.

This is clearly bad news for the Pirate.

OK, lets assume the Pirate is 200 000km away from the Target. Turnover time
is therefore ...

100 000 = 0.5 * 0.03 * TI^2 ... TI = 2581s, so total time is 5160s, or 86
minutes.

Add 30 minutes looting time, and we have 116 minutes for the Defender.

DD = 0.5 * 0.04 * 6960^2, or DD = 968 832km, so at the end of looting time,
the Defender is within 250 000km, give or take a little.

Risky but doable. Cutting the looting time to 20 minutes should allow a
getaway.

Therefore, 200 000km is our range. If the Target gets brave and maneuvers
and shoots back, then things get riskier, because by accelerating away from
the Intruder it effectivly cuts the Intruder\'s effective gees, plus reduces
the chance of being captured in jumpable condition (at 200 000km, a running
target adds 20 minutes to the Pirate\'s pursuit time, which cuts the safe
looting time to effectivly zero). Of course, doing this will get you shot
up by the Intruder.

200 000km is also outside the range at which civilian sensors will tend to
spot EMM masked powered-down Intruders in dusty systems.

Now we get to the pointy bit of the debate ... what is the chance of a
Target precipitating out within 200 000km of our lurking Intruder ? Now, a
200 000 km radius circle is 1.25 * 10^11 km^2, so an Intruder can dominate
that sector of the Jump Sphere.

Now, given a 100 diameter limit, we have a ships precipitating out along
the surface of a 1.28 million km radius sphere.

The formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4 PI r^2, so there is 2.05
* 10^13 square kilometers of Jump Sphere (incidentally, patrol ships cant
sterilize squat of this in Dusty systems, assuming doing sweeps with
smallish military sensors. Another u-boat analogy ...).

The odds of our Intruder being within 200 000km of a Target when it
precipitates therefore appear to be about 200-1. 

Now, when you add to this that some targets will be too big and some will
be too small, then life isnt as healthy for pirates as one might have hoped.

A plug, of sorts:

If you\'ve got Campaign Cartographer 2 (for Windows), I have a utility 
which will generate very nice "old-style" sector & subsector maps from 
Galactic data.  I haven\'t got around to putting it on my web page yet, 
so mail me if this of any use.

I\'d rate the results it produces higher than IG\'s sector maps but not 
quite as good as GDW/DGP because of trade routes/subsector edges cutting 
across worlds & world names.  The best maps were presumably adjusted by 
hand to avoid that problem.

Fuel, manuver, & weapons hits are possible.  If a 1G manuver drive takes a 
hitunder HG, it goes down.  The target starts coasting.  Fuel hits only 
decrease fuel by a percent or 2, depending on how good the hits are.  Weapon 
hits reduce the affected weapon USP code by 1 or 2, depending on how good a 
hit you score.

But this doesn\'t explain how a system that uses no energy and has a base

I was using the assumption that Target screamed for help as the Intruder 
boarded.  And that the Target had manuvered *from* the planet, not *TO* the 
planet.  It\'s outbound.

My assumptions were that Target was outbound, which is why it and the Intruder 
were just *sitt8ng* there.

[good bit of interesting relavant math for inbound intercepts snipped]

My prefered technique is to have a paid ground informat radio potential 
targets\' manifests & flight plan to Intruder lurking at the 100 diameter 
limit.  If an intercept is possible, and it\'s worth going for (high value 
cargo, 800 ton or less ship, no armed escort), the mission would be *on*, 
otherwise, keep running silent and wait for something interesting to come 
their way from the ground informant.

Which is why the *smart* pirate would only tackle ships in outbound flight 
paths.  Morally challanged is not semantically equivilent to stupid.

You\'re assuming targets would be taken either inbound or outbound.  Taking an 
inbound target IMNSFBHO is too much of a risk.  You have no clues on its 
manifests, so you don\'t know if it\'s carrying grain at 300Cr/ton or gemstones 
at 1MCr/ton.  Best to wait for better information.

I like the low bandwidth nature of the site. I think it would be a good idea to 
note just who\'s site it is (I mean the authors site should be noted somehow). 
Things I woul like to see would be a TNS service for M:0 like the old JTAS or 
the G:T site. Maybe some excerpts from T5 for download (hey I\'d like to see a 
T5 lite, but thats just me). Given time it would make sense to me to have JTAS 
online here. Maybe some old JTAS articles would be nice too.

Actually, the number published by the UN are intentional homicides per
100,000 population, so the differing populations ARE taken into account.
From memory (because I can\'t access the web from here): Canada 1.8,
Jamaica 5.x, USA 9.9, can\'t remember others.

Gun control as gun control, agreed. I was trying to use it as an example
where there are arguments for and against controlling weaponry, but strong
cultural factors preclude control even if it is logical. I can see the
same debate over controlling starship weaponry happening in some imaginary
Traveller bar using exactly the same terms we use for the gun control
debate (except for the constitutional arguments).

You\'ve gotten some good responses on the warrant officers and such. 
From my time in the US Marine Corps:

A warrant officer is one who\'s billet requires an officer (usually one
who is junior in grade) but also requires a level of technical
excellence and military know how rarely if ever found in a brand new
second lieutenant.  Therefore you take sharp enlisted men, and turn them
into Warrant Officers.  In the Corps, they have the courtesy title
"Gunner", coming from an old rank in the infantry, but within the last 5
years or so that has been reinstated.  To be a WO, you usually must have
attained the rank of SSgt (E6 in the Corps) [to be a true Gunner, must
have been a Gunny (E7) in the infantry].

In the Corps, we had WO-1, CWO-2 through CWO-5 (used to only go to 4,
but now 5 to keep up with the Army), WO-1 being the most junior officers
in the Corps, and CWO-5 (Chief Warrant Officer) the most senior warrant
still "junior" to a 2nd Lt.  However, as others inferred, the CWOs are
considered "equal" to commissioned officer ranks for courtesy (CWO-4
could share a stateroom with a Major (O-4) or have one of his own,
seating arrangements, etc.).

The Corps used to have LDOs (Limited Duty Officers) which were what WOs
could grow into.  LDO\'s filled billets which required the technical
expertise of Warrants, but required higher rank for daily operations
(dealing with other commissioned officers).  So in highly technical
fields, LDO\'s could advance to LtCol (O-5), and as such carried more
weight than "just" a CWO-4 for instance.  They also remained on the list
of precedence and continued to be promoted in the CWO ranks, so if they
needed to "revert", they would do so at whatever their CWO rank would
be....  By the way, CWO ranks (2-5) have commissions, not just Warrants.

I know.  A lot of detail, but still, makes for all kinds of color for
local campaigns.

The USMC did not have any Warrants that were pilots, like the Army
does.  All USMC pilots were commissioned officers.

To your questions about numbers of officers on board ships:  I think you
got good scoop on that.  Certain smaller ships have lower ranked
commanding officers, meaning that all sections or divisions would have
lower ranking heads.  Would eventually lead to Warrant Officers and
Chief Petty Officers being assigned as section heads.

"flight school".  

Real World TM ship drivers don\'t go to "Flight School" as that trains
the fighter pilots (and others) to fly aircraft.  Ship drivers go to the
ship driver\'s school.  The two have nothing to do with each other.  In
the Traveller Universe (mine, yours, the official one), it seems to me
that flight school would be where ALL the pilots (ship drivers as well

this IYTU?  

Are there divisions in flight school for ship pilots and for fighter

Don\'t forget the honest PCs out there. They have a stake in this too! :-)

I think Walt\'s right about it never being settled once-and-for-all, simply
because there is no such thing in a setting that is intended to be
customized by individual referees.

Still, I personally appreciate the logic and/or numbers put forth by
different posters on the whole thing. When I finally do run a "realistic"
Traveller campaign (as opposed to the space opera Rebellion I normally
run), this kind of thing will be invaluable to me. Quite frankly, I\'m
simply a graphic artist with an interest in science and economics, and the
kind of analysis done by varios posters on shipping rates, legal issues,
and technological capabilities are normally beyond my own meger skills of
reasoning and research.

So, despite the tendency for these things to turn into sarcastic flamewars
(which, while moderately amusing, get quickly unproductive and boring), I
*like* piracy debates. I would find Tim\'s "modest proposal" useful, I
think. I\'ll contribute what I can.

That\'s where you\'re wrong. The OTU is one universe. Or at least, it ought to
be. When it isn\'t, I consider it a grave fault.

You just said it yourself. We do use IMTU because everone alters the canonical
setting to their liking. Let me repeat the significant words: "the canonical
setting". Singular. There should only be one. If you want to change YTU to
something only resembling the OTU vaguely, you\'re entitled  --  though if
that is the case I don\'t see just why you care about the OTU in the first
place  --  and if I want to keep MTU as close as possible to the OTU, I 
should be allowed to do that. Most especially the OTU shouldn\'t change from
under me just because some author didn\'t manage to take previous published
material into account. Deliberate changes for some good purpose... maybe
yes, maybe no, depends on the purpose.

So much the more reason to make the official material as close to hard facts
as possible. That\'s why I dislike the "everthing is viewpoint writing"
school so much. If everything is viewpoint writing, then there are no
hard facts and Traveller authors are free to produce stuff that I can\'t
use.

I thought I made that clear: In order to be able to use it with a minimum

I don\'t think you have a very good idea about my image of the Imperium.

That\'s just the problem. You don\'t just want to use the same setting from
a different angle. As far as I can see it you want a completely different
setting.

Doug, you\'re making the mistake of assuming that I start out refusing to
accept. I don\'t. I start out doing my damndest to get it to fit somehow.
Since I don\'t post much about the stuff I can get to fit, you have gotten
a completely false impression about my dealings with canon. Also you are
fastening on one specific example instead of the general principle. There
are several other worlds besides Andor and Candory that was supposedly not
discovered until long after First Survey.
 
>Maybe the Droyne planted false memories in the Scouts, and sent them on
>their way.

Do you really want the Droyne to have the ability to do that?

>Maybe the weren\'t ready to be found..  what were they trying to cover up?

That\'s what I\'d like to know. Five Sisters were visited before 100 (IMO much
earlier); every system was examined in connection with First Survey; Iderati
was settled during the 5th Century; Five Sisters was made a district in 610.
Do you really want the Droyne capable of preventing discovery until 802 and
if you do, what changed to make them allow discovery?

>Why does Five Sisters have so many Navy bases?

IMTU answer: Because the subsector governor that implemented the Psionic
Suppressions im Five Sisters was so heavy-handed that he drove the whole
sector (except for Iderati and a few other worlds) to revolt. The navy had
to move in and still have trouble with some of the planets. That\'s also the
reson for a lot of the Amber Zone ratings).

>Why are Candor and Andory interdicted?

IMTU answer: That\'s easy. It was well known that at least some Droyne were
psionic. So the choice really lay between interdicting the worlds or
sterilizing them.

>Rather than a discrepancy, I see a great campaign!

Well, while you\'re at it, perhaps you can explain how the Imperium managed
to lose Ruie? You know, the lost colony world of Ruie that was supposedly
discovered by the Scouts in 1074. According to _Spinward Marches Campaign_
Ruie was surveyed and settled at about the same time as Regina. True, it
declined to join the Imperium when invited i 235 and remained an independent
world until some time after 1117; but how can you lose a colony placed right
next to a thriving subsector capital? A clerical error, no doubt.

>As for things being discovered.. San Francisco Bay, one of the world\'s best
>natural harbors, was sailed past numerous times by European explorers.
>They just didn\'t see any point exploring what appeared to be a small inlet.

There\'s quite a difference between not exploring one uninteresting-looking
bit of seaboard out of many similar-looking bits of seaboard and not checking
out the life zone around a star you\'ve been sent to survey.

You could easily explain away a difference of a few years or even a few
decades. But 95 years? And, btw. according to _The Traveller Book_ the
whole of the Spinward Marches had been surveyed by Year 100. Also, the
Sword Worlds were first contacted in 53, 73, 147 and 148 depending on
what source you use.

Were you a professional explorer charged with surveying Germany, perhaps?
Otherwise the analogy dosen\'t really impress me.

I think you would have been able to find out a few factual statements about
Germany if you had really wanted to.

Why? They hadn\'t been involved in any wars at that time. Contact may not
have been extensive, but it\'s difficult for me to believe that there
wouldn\'t have been some. And, not completely irrelevantly, if I were ever
to run a campaign in the Sword Worlds ca. 100 (a very interesting time),
I\'d want some contact with the Darrians just for the dramatic possibilities.

You assume that a pile of lanthanum is all you need to be able to construct

No, I don\'t think so. As far as I am concerned, Gary\'s insults were mild

is able to take it as well as he can dish it out.

You are way off base here, Eris. There\'s no question of canon fever, at
least on my part. My reasons are almost entirely pragmatic; I thought I
explained them quite adequately, so I won\'t bother to restate them.

That\'s your prerogative. Mine is to want a well thought out, self-consistent
framework that ensures that future Traveller writers don\'t just make up
things out of thin air without thinking about it. The last bit is important.
I don\'t mind odd exceptions to the general picture. But when they appear,
I want them to appear for a well thought out reason, not just because a
bunch of dice said so or because someone forgot to check his sources.

IMO if you leave things to loose you allow writers to _unintentionally_

Here we go again. If you want things loose, you can just ignore anything
you don\'t like. If I want a moderately self-consistent universe, I don\'t
get it unless the authors make an effort to stay consistent.

It ought to be. If you want hard facts from the Real World, you can just
go get them. But the only possible source of hard facts for a RPG
universe is the publishers.

That remark really deserves some choice insult, but to please Doug I won\'t
provide it... Oh, what the heck... That really is the stupidest remark I\'ve
seen for a long time... propably ever. Not even a full-time referee would be
able to work out in a lifetime all the information that a character in an SF

in not having the time to do it all myself. And if you are so contemptuous of
"somebody else\'s work" why are you bothering with the official rules and
adventures at all?

If you don\'t want a canon, fine. Don\'t have a canon. But leave those of us
who wants one to wrangle over how it should be.

Wouldn\'t a smart traffic-control just assign vectors to leaving ships that
are within the SDB\'s area of coverage?

It doesn\'t seem to matter where you are on the 100-diameter limit when you
are jumping away from a system (you don\'t have to be pointing at your
destination in realspace), so the outbound jump point could be assigned and
thus "known," in which case:

"If Targets come out at a known jump point, the pirate is screwed, because
that is where the SDB is."

still holds true.

If there is so much traffic that you think you need multiple outbound jump
points so that you can handle lots of simultaneous jumps, then most likely
that system has enough traffic to justify SDBs for all of those outbound
points.

I for one don\'t accept that assumption. IMO the "scream" is when the pirate

>It\'s outbound.

If it is outbound, it has jump fuel. If it has jump fuel, it is capable of
jumping before reaching the 100 diameter limit. There would be some risk to
that, of course, but then again, there would be some risk to not jumping, no?

"If the intercept is possible". That\'s a very significant if. I presume
your pirate jumped into the system some way from the mainworld a "coasted"
in orbit at the 100 diameter limit (how long did that take him, btw.?).
The departing ship can choose any jump departure point he wants right?
Either that or system control can assing him any one they want. In any
case, the odds against choosing the spot where the pirate is lurking is
the same 200 to 1 that Ian calculated for incoming ships. And that\'s
assuming that the system dosen\'t have a specific jump _departure_ point
with an SDB stationed (because of the great pirate threat, no doubt).

Anybody who attacks a ship with jump fuel outside the 10 diameter limit

	What about the easiest explanation about all these discrepancies? 
Namely, that historical records do not match real history?

	1. The scouts visit the Sword Worlders in 53. They obtain records 
about the Darrians, including partial information and legends about 
their technological achievements.
	2. The Imperium (IISS, or Navy, or INI, or whatever) immediately 
classifies the information and sends secret scout missions to 
evaluate the power of a potentially technologically superior foe.
	3. The scouts start infiltrating the Darrian society to make sure 
that they become friendly allies of the Imperium and not enemies, and 
also to obtain any advanced technologies they have. This is, of 
course, a far-horizon plan. Let\'s say... 95 years?
	4. Meanwhile, it becomes more and more difficult for the imperial 
authorities responsible of the operation to maintain the Darrians an 
"imperial classified matter", since mroe and more merchants are 
venturing thorugh the marches. So, rumors spread, and different 
sources start talking of the Darrians. Some are suppressed, some are 
not. Different historical records reflect different rumors or 
nearly-suppressed informations.
	5. Finally, the operation is completed and the (slightly 
manipulated) Darrian society is contacted, and they become indeed 
friendly Imperial allies...

	I see an adventure coming.... Secret of the Darrians, where an 
archeologist wants to find the truth about the first contact with the 
Darrians... and starts being stalked by some Men In Black from an 
Imperial Office created to monitor the development of events after 
certain classified project a millennium ago...

	Speak of odd historical records, and conspiracy theories are sure to 
appear.

An encounter table dosen\'t prove that all pirates are like the ones in the
table. But it does prove that some pirates are (supposedly) like that. Don\'t
think I don\'t appreciate the suggestions, but they don\'t explain where THOSE
pirates come from and how they operate.

Well, sort of...

Actually you can purchase or create \'sterile\' rats and mice, it\'s a lot
of work, both to raise them and keep them sterile.

Mothers milk _is_ sterile, I think you\'re mistaking that for colostrum,
which is a compnent of mily for the first days or weeks after birth,
which is high in antibodies and other immune system proteins.

These help protect the baby until their own immune system kicks in.

_This_ is why raising these sterile animals is hard, as the young have
to be hand raised, and are extremely susceptible to infection.

Once you have a sterile grown pair, OTOH, all you have to do is make
sure they get sterilized food, water and envirionement and they\'ll
usually breed. How well they doo, is problematic, as this is how we
discovered that our gut flora produce all _sorts_ of micronutrients for
us, as well as a considerable amount of digestion aid and
detoxification.

In fact, with one compound I was studying, the metabolic profile was
completely different between sterile and non-sterile animals, and the
proportion of the compund metabolized to potential and proximate
carcinogens was much higher.

As I said, you can buy sterile animals, but they require special diest
and a heck of a lot of work to keep that way.

As I was mentioning about the Great Piracy Debate being an effective

Does a ship have to go in any particular realspace direction to go in
a particular jumpspace direction? Can I leave a planet heading
galactic spinward from the planet in realspace, even though my intended
jump vector is straight rimward?

Where does a ship come out of jumpspace? Right at the 100D limit?
Where on the 100D limit? In a straight realspace line towards where
it entered? Wherever the Navigator tells it to? Inside some random area
close to one of the previous two points? 

What difference can a good navigator make to where entering or where
leaving? Is it even up to the navigator?

IMO this particular flamewar has cooked up some useful discussions.

Probably _much_ more likely to spread. In fact, there are probably little
backwater planets that believe a whole slew of incorrect information.

I mean, look at the people in the hinterlands of the United States who take
the Sun, National Enquirer and Weekly World News as truth. They\'re not
_even_ as far off communications routes. Urban Legends spread widely across
the world _despite_ the major news sources already, and show no sign of
slowing down.

What is the point of publishing books detailing a setting, then, if they

Why is it "forcing others to play in some pre-generated, structured

play in? Is it harder to ignore the "official" setting and make up your own
stuff than it is to simply make up your own stuff?

Why is it a Bad Thing (tm) to have a self-consistant, "official" setting
for those who have more money than time to establish a background?

If I am looking to purchase a series of products describing a setting with
the intent of using them as-is, then having that setting well-detailed and
self-consistent is a good thing. I don\'t have to do any work, and
everything still makes sense in the framework as presented.

If I am looking to purchase a series of products describing a setting that
I intend to modify to my own insideous ends, then having that setting
well-detailed and self-consistent doesn\'t hurt, because I\'m just going to
ignore stuff I don\'t like. Nor does having a setting that is *not*
well-detailed or self-consistent help, because I\'m going to be doing the
work anyway. Such may even add *more* work, because now I have to figure
out details IMTU that I could have just hacked straight from the "official"

How do these dates correspond with known Sword Worlds history?
Were the Sword Worlds politically unified, at war with each other,
a band of vaguely-associated polities at these times? 

It\'s possible that some of those dates apply to reported contacts
(exploratory merchant cruisers?), some apply to contact with roving
Sword Worlder scout vessels, some apply to first scout visits and
others apply to opening of formal contact (a step just shy of diplomatic
relations?) with all or any of the Sword Worlds. All the dates are correct,
in the terms they are used for. We _knew_ of them by 53, we 
_encountered_ them in person in late 73, we were unable to open
formal contact with their capitol until late 147, it was reported back to
the local Imperial Representative in 148.

This data is a millenia old. Are the sources we\'re reading to be
interpreted as the grade-school encyclopedia version, with the
ambiguities rising from it\'s simplified version of quite complex events?

Adventure hooks aren\'t in the sunny places, they\'re in the dark cracks
where ambiguities hide...

I agree, for many of the same reasons. Traveller seems to be the one game
with the strictest and most rabid canon types. No other game\'s fans have
quite the opposition to change that most Traveller fans seem to have.

Exactly. I remember once when I mentioned the possibility that nanotech just
might be around by the peak of the 3I, even in limited form, I was
immediately told that I would not be playing Traveller.

Who has the right to tell me (or anybody else) whether or not I\'m playing
Traveller?

How soon we forget that this is the way that the game started out. One thing
I pointed out quite a while ago: Canon was written by folks like you and I
<proverbial "you and I" not Eris and I)  years ago. At the time, these
things were new additions to the system. Drastic changes. Just about
everything we know and love in canon had to break new ground at one point or
another. Thankfully, the Traveller fans back then were more open to new
ideas.

[snip of example "real" history]

As a referee, I would much rather my view of the setting not be cluttered
continuity problems labeled "historical innaccuracy." As a referee, I
should have the "real" history information. I want to be able to know more
about these mysteries than the players.

I would *much* rather have a "real" history (like you gave above) written
specifically in the material than just a simple inconsistency which smacks
of bad continuity control. I can then do the work and change it if I want
to for MTU, or I can leave it as is. A simple inconsistency makes me do the
work wheter I want to or not (assuming said inconsistency deals with
something that my players will contend with).

One contributing effect I see on this: the people in charge (governors,
business leaders, etc) were trained in an environment where incomplete
and out of date information was the norm. Would this act to
increase the spread and effects of rumors, or decrease it?

One of the Azhanti High Lightnings lost during the 4th Frontier War -
when war was declared, the captain went to the ship\'s safe and
opened his sealed orders - orders probably weeks or months old,
if not older. The rest of his raiding squadron met him at the redezvous
based on the same orders, and that may well have been the last time
the Captain recieved any information at all about the progress of the
war before his ship was lost. His independent command is probably
and extreme case, but not an uncommon one. I could imagine 
a particulary successful commerce raider penetrating deep enough
to outrun information on things like armistices, and continuing a war
for some time after the cease fire.

Imagine the security on Imperial Fleet Recall Codes, the ones
you give your enemy so he can convince your commerce raiders
that it\'s time to come home now.

I  have  no  problem  with  contradictions  and  inaccuracies  in
_player_ information ... but as the resident ghod  of  MTU  _I\'d_
like to know what\'s going on.

If I were to choose the Entropic worlds option (and it  became  a
significant fact of MTU), then someone prints an adventure  based
on the Cunnoic worlds option I would  either  have  to  bend  it,
alter reality IMTU, or not use it.  I don\'t always have the  time
for major bending.

Consider the number of urban legends _spread_ by major news sources, and
the problem looks even worse.

Take foex, two events: Pierre Salinger\'s dramatic announcement that a
missile had downed that TWA flight, and the persistent rumor that the US
had infiltrated virus-ridden ( no not THAT Virus!!!) printers to Saddam
Husseins HQ before the war. The first was because of the common computer
fallacy "I saw it on the computer so it _must_ be true", which is
nothing more than the old GIGO rule in action. The latter was an
_acknowledged_ April Fools prank by (IIRC) InfoWorld, yet it\'s _still_
being cited by respected authorities as an example of succesful waging
of \'info-war\'.

People are gullible, and willing to believe anything that sounds good,
particularly if it sounds too good to be true. (I saw a news segment the
other day concerning online securities fraud. One person contacted said
(on national teevee no less!) that "Well, I saw it on the internet, so I
thought it _had_ to be true!" My wife and I howled at that one. Still,
people are conned with low tech versions of that same scam every day;
cons that have been practiced for years, decades, centuries...probably
millenia. I\'m sure there was _some_ babylonian version of "The Spanish
Prisoner" :-/

How does this relate to Trav? Well, we have, in TTU, the worst of both
worlds: most worlds have high-speed pervasive information networks, yet
information travels only at the speed of transportation between worlds.
So when a "Make Money Fast" or "Beware the Good Times"  \'virus\' hits a
world, or a inaccurate TNS report comes through, it may spread like
lightning, mutate a dozen ways from Sunday, and bounce back and forth
for days or months before retractions, or correct informatin gets into
circulation.

Given the nature of most retractions: 

Blaring 128 pt headline day 1: "Smith a goat-loving, child eating
monster"

retraction, day 4, page 34, 6 pt: "What we actually meant was Mr. Smith
has hand raised three pet angora goats, and due to a recent digestive
ailment, is required to eat baby food. We apologize for any
misunderstanding") 

Much disinformation will get not only engrained, but codified...all it
takes is one history professor to get his sources wrong, and poor ol\'
Smith goes down in history as : "In 862, a hitherto popular
administrator was forced to resign from office and flee the planet when
allegations of sexual perversions and cannibalism surfaced (Kracknow
p65, J\'Aliew, p 789, ibid. p987)"

At this point history is \'set\'. Wrong, but it\'s set. Those "ibid\'s" are
the kiss of death...it takes considerable proof to change the ponderous
course of academia, and when academic publishing moves at the speed of
transport, things slow down even more...

 I for one don\'t accept that assumption. IMO the "scream" is when the pirate
 goes active and dosen\'t depend on the Target. >>
	
	What if the pirate gains a passive detection and uses LIDAR for the FC lock?
No screaming there.  This also brings up an important point...most merchant
vessels (at least the designed ships I have seen) do not routinely carry laser
or maser comms, so they cannot surreptiously warn the defender.

Wrangle, yes.  But you seem to be unable to accept that others have
differing views, and have become increasingly quick to resort to insults.
People should realize that discussing any aspect of the Third Imperium is
going to become a case of blind men describing an elephant.

Last time I checked, neither marc nor Loren were pulling our ideas
wholesale of the TML for inclusion in either T5 or G:T. (Although I do see
little bits and pieces that I recall from TML messages)  What we discuss
here is by definition unoffcial.

Congrats, Hans.  You\'ve managed what Leroy never did.  Welcome to my killfile.

If all the traveller players in the world were brought together to live in
one great colony immediately after the release of Supplement 3, we might
have one unified view of the TU.  But we didn\'t, so we don\'t.  Instead, we
have a framework for building our own visions of the Traveller milieu.
This means that sometimes we disagree on things.

Amazing.  That has to be one of the most arrogant statements I\'ve heard in
a while.  How *dare* anybody write something you can\'t use!  Marc, Loren..
be sure to get Hans\' approval on ALL further products.  Perhaps BITS should
do the same.  after all, we wouldn\'t want anyone to publish something you
can\'t use!

Of course, you could do what the rest of us do and not buy things that you
aren\'t going to use.

No, just a different set of assumptions on things like fleet size, likely
hood of piracy, and a conspiracy oriented campaign.

They hid the evidence of the Andor being the Droyne homeworld.  Also, they
finished studying humans, and decided to allow limited contact.  The Droyne
of Andor remember who they are, even if they don\'t know how to operate the
remnants of the Ancients left on their world.

Remember, I\'m the guy with the interstellar telepathic network, Templar
agents hiding in the shadows, and the strange beacon calling sophonts
towards the Five Sisters.  I\'m a conspiracy freak/Lovecraft fan, and it
shows in my game, and in my take on the Third Imperium.

IMTU answer: The Imperium has learned a little about the Droyne, and the
Templars weren\'t prepared for the Droyne to still be in the area.  They
truly fear what might come out of those two worlds.

Yet so many other Droyne worlds are uninterdicted.. Andor/Candory are
interdicted out of fear.. there is something very wrong there.

That one I\'ll have to give some thought to.. my first impression is that
I\'ll ignore it entirely and just say that after Ruie declined Imperial
membership, it was mostly ignored.

My take?  As the Imperium learned the size and scope of the Zhodani
Consulate, assets were reassigned to survey further to Core/Spin.

Hans, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of
America never went to war.  It didn\'t stop both sides form slandering the
other.  As a soldier I got to read (translated) Soviet schoolbooks about
America.  Evidently we are a slave-holding people where decadent
aristocrats lord over starving workers, who are all yearning for world
revolution to liberate them.

In Basic Training, we had a kid who had never seen a Jew.  When he learned
that his bunkmate was Jewish, it was like he had been assigned to sleep
next to a Martian.  Evidently, he assumed that all Jews would have huge
noses, never be out of the prayer shawl, and practically ooze slime.  This
is from an American teenager in 1984.  Across interstellar distances?

No, but building a shipyard close to the supply of lanthanum makes a
certain amount of sense.  Most of them don\'t even build ships, but instead
focus on yearly maintence.

  Fuel hits under HG were a loss from current stocks of "n" % of total
capacity, with a substitution of n = 10 dt where n% would be less; was
this changed under MT? For a 200 Dt Far Trader a Fuel-1 hit then becomes
a 20-100% loss per hit (assuming ~50 Dt L-Hyd capacity, and 10-50 carried
at the time).

  Each hit on a triple beam turret costs Cr 250,000 to repair; repair times
will involve up to a month at an A or B starport for minor damage.

  For more accurate combat systems (MCS?) how does zero DV available affect
the laser targeting solution at long range?

Correct, with the note that "breaking new ground" isn\'t the same thing as
"changing established background".

For example, when I wrote the equipment sheet for the cargo container I
made certain that it matched the cargo sizes used in the rulebook rather
than creating my own "standard" sizes. 

This is "keeping canon" in the positive sense. I have expanded the
Traveller universe, while _not_ invalidating previously published
material.

You\'re forgetting, of course, the obligatory UFO sightings.  You know, the

I used that assumption on the basis that it would give me consistent intercept 
numbers to work with.  A best case scenario, if you will.

Of course, *THE* best case is, when you can knock over a fully laded ship in a 
system that doesn\'t *have* any SDB\'s or gunships out there at all, and isn\'t 
gonna see them for a few more months.  And the cargo is rilly rilly RILLY high 
buck untraceable stuff...

I\'d assumed that the Intruder would hear the scream and know they\'re under time pressure.  For the purposes of my figures, whether they detected the scream or not is immaterial.

Why not?  After all, I can go to any number of stores today and purchase
a radar/laser detector for my vehicle.  I would expect that a starship
would have the same.  Once you\'re painted, you let loose with your cry
for help.

According to the description of commo packages in T4\'s QSDS (T4, pg 94),
the basic, improved, and enhanced packages all carry some sort of
1000AU-range tight-beam commo.  Earlier (and/or later) versions may
vary.

I\'m still studying MT\'s ship combat system.  Interesting.  And it started 
making sense a bit when I realised the tables are *reversed* from CT/HG due to 
the MT task system.  Very interesting.  And MT takes in gunner\'s skill, while 
CT Book 2 *does* but HG *doesn\'t*.  The more I look at it, the more it seems 
to be a \'better of two worlds\'.  It also defines ranges in kilometers, which 
CT did and HG *didn\'t*.  HG was a LOT more abstract, being based on the 
assumption that you\'d be using it to referee massive fleet actions or 
something.

Emergency repairs are based on undefined \'spare parts\' found on the ship in CT 
& HG.  Same thing for MT.  These emergency repairs take 1 combat turn and you 
get to roll to see if you can get them done.  This doesn\'t get the repaired 
system back to 100% showroom shape, it\'s more like the \'We got the bubble gum 
in place, we\'re replacing the access cover, just skip the 27 point realignment 
procedure and let\'s get the hell *OUTTA* here!\' variety.  HG & LBB2 both state 
that *permenant* repairs have to take place at a shipyard.

I did it to make the intercept times consistant as a best-case response time 
from the viewpoint of the Intruder.

Depends on how extensive the system\'s space presence is.  Somehow, I don\'t see 
a system with a C or worse starport is going to have 5 batrons & 10 crurons 
for system defense.

How could a course for an *outbound* ship affect an *inbound* intercept?  
Remember, the assumption for my post was, the Target was outbound, not 
inbound.  For the purposes of the post, who *CARES* what\'s inbound?  That\'s 
not where the most probable threat is going to come from.  It\'s going to come 
from the planet.

At MCr700+ per SDB, that can get expensive.

I\'d use the second, but with a minor difference - I\'d only begin the
turnaround after I\'d detected the intruder or got it into weapon range.
While I\'d overshoot a bit the \'at rest point\' will still be within short
range of the intruder and I\'d get into firing range a little sooner.

This is a 55/72 (76%) chance of a penetrating hit per turret. With two
turrets there is a 58% chance of two good hits, a 36% chance of one
penetrating hit, and a 6% chance of doing nothing.

This gives an 89% chance of a penetrating hit per turret.

But each weapon hit has probably cost you a MCr or so. A maneuver drive hit
would probably cost a couple of MCr to fix, and if you don\'t catching that
next victim will be that much harder. 

BTW what happens if the SDB uses a nuke? In MT it makes it reasonably
likely that the damage is in the 10+ MCr range. Also I see that a ship with
4 triple laser turret will (in MT) be able to get criticals on a 400 ton ship.

In CT there is a 1 in 36 chance of a critical from any hit, so a defender
that is getting 12 attacks per round is going to be quite a worry to a
pirate, especially as, in CT, repairs are very expensive.

In BL/BR/TNE the lasers (and the Gazelle\'s PAWs which become big lasers)
won\'t do criticals, but will cost the intruder a lot of money to fix, and
may well put something important off-line for a while. The missiles will do
criticals if they hit, and like MT (and HG, IIRC) a critical will pretty
much wreck a ship.

However the victim was probably not stationary when the pirate caught her
(unless she was totally surprised), but would have been moving towards the
planet at a velocity that would take an hour or so (for the prize, less for
the pirate) to lose, and a while longer to get back to the 100 diameter
limit. If the victim accelerated at 1G for 1000s and the pirate spent 90
minutes with her looting, etc it would take the pirate (at 3Gs) 2344s (39
minutes) to get out to the 100 diameter limit. It would take the prize
4578s (76 minutes) to do so (at 1G). This gives the defender trying to come
to rest at the pirate\'s location 10 minutes to shoot up the pirate and
pretty much ensures, IMO, that the prize won\'t get away. Unless the victim
was carrying a very worthwhile cargo the battle damage from even only a
couple of hits is going to make the pirate broke pretty quickly.

I that case it will quite possibly just make a dangerous jump from inside
the 100 dia limit and leave you with nothing but the SDB (or a risky jump
yourself) for your troubles.

But  it working under HG doesn\'t always mean it works under the LBBs. In
this case while under HG the pirate won\'t get his ship wrecked under the
LBBs it is quite possible.

The text in _FSSI_ says that a BatRon is "usually reinforced with large
numbers of auxillary ships, including refueling shuttles, escorts and
support cruisers. In addition, they are accompanied by a number of fleet
couriers with carry communications between squadrons." It does not make
clear whether or not these vessels are in addition to those shown on the
TO, or whether they are those on the chart.

Amen.  I don\'t at all mind a minimalist official setting; recall that I
started playing before there was *any* official setting for Traveller
beyond the vague implications of the LBBs.  However, I do insist that any
setting provided satisfy, to a large extent, two conditions: 

1) Plausibility.  All described events, economies, sociologies, and so
   forth should make sense as the (subjectively) rational actions of
   intelligent beings, taking into account the motivations of those
   beings.  The plausibility criterion is violated e.g. in the \'loss\'
   of Ruie and the absurdly long timeframe for discoveries in the Marches
   following the First Survey.

2) Internal consistency.  All sources should agree in broad terms on
   history, astrography, and other cogent information.  The internal
   consistency criterion is violated e.g. by describing the Kinunir
   as a battlecruiser (in the light of later data on ship displacements).

Underspecification is a good thing, conversely.  If no official source
ever says how big a battlecruiser is, then each GM can pick a value that
works in that campaign.  Having two answers differing by more than two
orders of magnitude, however, means that the GM will face great
difficulties making the campaign world consistent -- and consistency,
either from official sources or out of the GM\'s head, is the key to a good
game experience, IMHO.

Plausibility is the greatest weakness of the Traveller official
background, in my view.  Things like the ESA long-range expedition, the
delay before Earth-Vilani contact, the glacial pace of exploration, the
presence of unexplored worlds next to thriving ports for centuries...all
of these strain my ability to handwave explanations.  Unfortunately, it\'s
probably too late for wholesale canon repair.  But we can insist that
outright contradictions be mended, that major problems be patched as well
as possible, and that future Traveller products attempt to maintain
plausibility and internal consistency to the extent possible.

Non-maneuvering targets can be hit pretty easily at extreme range.
(Some people use a rule in BL - ignoring the -1 DR/3 hexes for non-maneuvering
targets - that has a similar effect.)

Got my copy Friday, and my first impressions were, VERY NICE!
Kudos to Loren and crew.

First, I did notice that the binding looked much stronger than in GT
(looks like there\'s more glue).
Cover art pretty cool.  A Beowulf vapeing an enemy starship (I will NOT
say the P word, lest the forces of darkness take me! <G>)

Opening the book, the first thing that caught my eye is the detailed
history of the marches in the sidebars, from 1098 to 1120.  Very nice!
This info is invaluable for figuring out the characters backgrounds.  What
war they were involved in, what type of nasty politics were (and still
are) going on in the characters homeworld, etc...

Flipping more pages, I saw that every polity and race was described in
detail!  Now I have played since the mid 80\'s, but my materials and
information from the classic era are rather "Swiss-cheezed".  This book
filled in all the holes!  Minor races in the marches I didn\'t even knew
existed, excellent!

Each world is detailed, with a background and a recent history.  Although
I will miss the UPP\'s, the GURPS stats give enough info that I can
practically visualize the UPP\'s.  

Now for some (rather minor) downers, gripes, etc...

I did notice that my most favorite world in the Marches, Efate, has gave
in to the MAN!
The law level has been "0" for over 20 years, allowing for some rather
interesting gaming on that world.
(High tech, No law world ruled by oligarchs--Bladerunner anyone?) In BTC
Efate is now listed as having a "control factor" of  4.  Going to the
charts that\'s about LL6 or 7.  A world where you could once freely buy and
carry a PGMP-13 in public, now will prosecute you for carrying anything
heavier than a shotgun.  Ah well, makes sense in a way, the siege is over
and the resistance to Zhodani occupation as well.

Being a major ship-head, I was a bit distressed at the mention of some new
ships, but not finding any stats!
In the sidebars, it mentions the Ulani class cruiser.  Not any hint of
what this ship can do is anywhere in the book.  Likewise for the Darrian
Barekdoldin class Patrol Cruiser.  Now the Barekdoldins are in Regency
handbook, which is ok, but the design is very FF&S and will smash a few GT
construction rules.  (That sucker has more than 5 turrets, 3 25ton missile
"mini-bays", and a manipulator beam to boot!)

Been considering building the Barekdoldins for GT, anyone wanna help?

I am sure that these ships may be subjects for a possible GT ships book.
I supposed that they will have to be considered FNORD for now ;-> 

Still, this is a great book.  As this is more background than rules heavy,
its a good read for CT fans as well.  MT and TNE may get additional info
as well, although it is set in the \'alternate\' timeline.

That\'s my review, now its back to work.....

The assumption is valid because I was showing best-case intercept times from 
planetary orbit to the Intruder right at the 100 diameter jump limit.  It was 
also *SPECIFIED* that the scream occurred as the Intruder\'s prize crew 
boarded. Didn\'t you read the assumptions I started the post with?

I have no clue how you handle prejump navigation IYTU, but in mine, it takes 
*time* to run the Generate & Jump programs.  Exit points are plotted as 
precisely as possible so that the ship will jump where it\'s supposed to.  Once 
the Jump solution is locked in, you\'re committed.  Aborting the Jump is 
possible, but you lose the Jump fuel you\'ve burned.  Attempting to trigger the 
Jump prematurely *guarantees* a misjump.  So does triggering it late.  
Triggering it while under attack just increases the odds of a misjump.  IMTU, 
of course.

Of course, the scenario I described in my original post is only good for 
something like 50% of the star systems IMTU in that a starship must also be 
clear of the 100 diameter limit of the star and/or gas giant the main world 
orbits.  IMTU, at least 2/3rds of the systems\' main worlds are inside the 
stellar jump limit.  Some of the travel times to a jump point can go as far as 
a couple hundred million klicks.  Things can get *interesting* in those dark 
quiet places...

Immaterial for the purpose of the post.  Also immaterial for the purpose of 
the post is the flight time of the Target to intercept, the flight time of the 
Intruder to intercept, the contents of the Target\'s hold, and the astrological 
significance of the position of the various crewbeing\'s hemeroids at the time 
of interception corrected for distance from Terra.  The post was quite plain, 
at least to me, that a hypothetical Incident *HAD OCCURRED*, and at the 
instant this Incident occurred, a Response was mounted from the most likely 
position of response.  My prefered technique of piracy *also* is immaterial 
for the purposes of the original post because it was assumed that the Incident 
had happened, and the how, why, and who was immaterial as well.

You\'re assuming the Intruder can\'t manuver to the Target.  Let\'s do some math.

The safe jump radius for a Size 8 world is 1,280,000 klicks.  Assuming the 
Target is attempting to jump within the same hemisphere as the Intruder, the 
Intruder thus has 1,280,000 klicks *OR LESS* to move to the intercept point.  
The Intruder will do this manuvering at 3G.  Target will manuver the full 
1,280,000 klicks at 1G.  If the Target ignores turnover, it hits the Jump 
point at 223.2 klicks per second, 372 minutes from departure from thw world.  
How difficult is hitting a jump point that\'s a couple meters bigger than the 
largest dimension of your ship and at a precise point in space when your ship 
is moving its own length (assuming a 25 meter lenght for this one) every 
0.000112 seconds?  The absolute safest entrance would be to have as close to 
*ZERO* velocity at the jump point, thus, the Target will accellorate for 
640,000 klicks, do a turnover, then decellerate for 640,000 klicks, taking 264 
minutes per leg, or 528 minutes total.  That\'s 8.8 hours.

Assume the Intruder has to go the entire 1.280 million klicks and wants to 
come to rest at the jump point, or within a couple thousand klicks thereof.  
The 640K klick legs take 153 minutes each, or 306 minutes total, or 5.1 hours. 
 This leaves the Intruder 3.7 hours, or 11 combat turns, to capture the 
Target.  How does the Intruder know *exactly* whre to go?  Two words:  *FLIGHT 
PLAN*, filed at the starport, radioed to the Intruder by a confederate on the 
ground.  What part of this mathematics don\'t you understand?

IYTU.  Not in mine.  I\'m beginning to believe in Doug\'s theory as well.

IIRC, these ships had *two*, count \'em, *two* hard points, with nothing on 
them, at time of purchase, and refitted with turrets and weapons as an 
afterthought.  Assuming triple beam lasers, a fully armed Type P still out 
guns them 1.5 to 1.  The Type P should be nervous?  We\'re talking about 
crewbeings that make their *LIVING* dishing out massive violence and death, 
remember?

OK, I\'ll bite.  Where *DO* they come from?  Or are pirates non-existant IYTU?

I believe there is an old Earth saying that covers this:
A short life, and a merry one.

Just out of curiousity, does anyone out there play up the difference in
Social Standing?  

IMTU, if Joe Spacer, working for below minimum wage and with a Soc of 1
is at the helm when the pirates give their order to "heave to," he\'s
gonna do it.  The cargo belongs to some rich guy back in the subsector
capitol, not to Joe, and Mr. Spacer knows that the cargo is insured.  If
he tries to fight, the pirates won\'t treat him nicely if they ever get
aboard.  One the other hand, if he makes it easy for the pirates, the
pirates will let him escape with his skin.  Or, they might even ask him
to join.

Piracy, it\'s not just economics, but socio-economics.

Which is why you take out the M-drive if you can.  As I pointed out earlier, dunno bout YTU, but IMTU, once you\'ve plotted the Jump point, you gotta live with it.  Sure, you can change it, but that\'s gonna take time, and once your M-drive is down and your weapons silenced, you can be boarded at will.

Even if the victim doesn\'t scream IMO the authorities will know something
is up pretty early on. The merchant will be in communication with traffic
control, and they\'ll want to know why she has stopped following their
instruction as to flight pattern (I very much doubt that it will have
included suddenly stopping your 1G acceleration well short of your expected
turn around). This would surely be an indication of possible piracy. BTW
unless the pirate gets close to the merchie before delivering its demands
it will be making a fair bit of noise with its broadcast radio, as the
victim can\'t hear tightbeam if they don\'t have a set of their own. If the
pirate just starts shooting to disable the merchie then said merchie may as
well start screaming, because the pirate has already shown that they aren\'t
too concerned about killing a few merchants along the way.

BTW in TNE/BL both the Free- and Far-Traders have 30,000km radios and
1000AU masers. The radios use 1MW and the Masers use 0.6MW, so it\'s pretty
easy to see why. This makes telling the merchies to stand and deliver
quieter, but it also lets them scream quietly.

I don\'t have BL, so I\'ll take your word on it.  My examples were using LBB2/HG.

Wait til you land on Drellesarr IMTU.  <grin>  It\'s a bit of a bitch to get to 
easily; IMTU, it\'s abit over 30 million klicks \'deep\' inside the star\'s 100 
diameter Jump limit, so you\'ll have a long cruise to get there.  And it\'s been 
a *known* freeport in *EVERY* sense of the word since pre-3I times.  In case 
you\'re looking for it, it\'s Reavers\' Deep 2029.

A Game of the Imperial Civil War, 580-630


BOARD: Each subsector is rated according to Technology (10-13?), 
Resources, Systems, and Culture...

Basically, the TL of a subsector is the TL of any fleets it produces
or any defenses in that subsector; in the scope of this game, a 
subsector\'s TL is fixed. Rated from 0 to +3.

Resources are the basic economic unit of the game; military or
economic actions can raise or lower the amount of resources produced
by a subsector.  Resources are used to build fleets or defenses,
maintain fleets, and create leaders; rated from -3 to +4.

Systems are a measure of how many victories are required to fully
conquer a subsector, and represents the number of high tech, high
population worlds in the subsector; can be as high as 4.

Culture represents the type of culture in the subsector - Sylean,
Solomani, Vilani, Vargr.  This effects the likelihood of unrest
and rebellion given the culture of the leader of the faction controlling
the subsector.


LEADERS: No action outside of defense or fleet maintenance can be done
unless a leader is present.  Leaders have four ratings: Tactics,
Strategy, Diplomacy and Loyalty.  Tactics affects how well the leader 
does in combat, Strategy effects taxation and unrest, Diplomacy affects
attempts by the leader to persuade subsectors and fleets to his cause,
and Loyalty represents a leader\'s dedication to his cause - leaders with
a low Loyalty might revolt.

All leader values are rated from 1 (low) to 9 (high).

COMBAT is basically a comparison of fleets and defenses on either side,
the average TL of those forces and the Tactics of any leaders present.

Think Empires of the Middle Ages...

You scream for help when they board ???

Surely, if you are going to scream for help (not guaranteed, if the
Intruder offers the Target\'s crew a substantial cut if you keep quiet),
then you do it when you detect them, not when they are coming thru the
airlock.

What stops an outbound target risking a jump from within 100 diameters ? It
is a risk, but if the choice is being boarded and looted, many Free Traders
would jump, and many Company Men may fear damage to their careers for not
trying to safeguard Company property, and those fearful of a pirate\'s mercy
may just take their chances in jumpspace.

You\'d overshoot by at least 80K klicks, which you\'ll have to backtrack in to 
board and make the arrests.  And it won\'t get you into firing range soon 
enough to really be worth it.

How much is a starship worth?  If you can get the whole boat to take with, you 
*do* it.  You can *always* find somebody to bribe to paperwhip it back to 
legality so you can sell the sucker.  Can you say, \'calculated risk\'?  I\'ve 
always assumed you\'ll take the boat too, unless you\'re pulling an insurance 
scam, in which case you\'ve already *made* your money, and any damage to the 
merchie is mere cosmetics.  You only have to take 1 or 2 a year to make out.  
And the cargos are your coffee & beer money for the year.

Nukes are the exclusive province of the Imperium.  And the Impies are 
notorious for getting really soggy & hard to light when non-Imps use them.  
Thus, I assumed non-nuke missiles.  And the standard loadout of both the 
Dragon and the Gazelle isn\'t 4 triple laser turrets, they\'re 2 & 2.  Thus, no 
critical hits due to USP overwhelms.  Anything bigger, of course, *WILL* dish 
out 1 critical hit per USP factor over 4.

Somehow I have problems seeing a single missile or a single beam laser making 
a critical hit, which is why I showed combat resolution under HG.

I\'ve never had BL/BR/TNE space combat books in my hands, so I specified what I

I don\'t see it.  Remember, you want to hit a VERY precise point in space to 
open the Jump point.  It\'s easier to do this slowly than quickly.  This tells 
me that the Victim *won\'t* be moving at ridiculous speeds, thus, that 
assumption.

I did not make my point clear. Since it doesn\'t matter where on the
100-diameter sphere a ship jumps out (at least as far as I can tell), then
it is simple to assign an outbound ship a course to a jump point that is
under the watchful eye of an SDB.

But this is irrelevant, because:

>As I pointed out earlier, dunno bout YTU, but IMTU,

Okay, now *I* ask this -- why is this a discussion any more?

Since this thread obviously has relevance to Kevin\'s Traveller Universe
only, there is absolutely nothing to be said that can mean anything except
for what he stipulates as meaningful. We are simply arguing apples and
oranges at this point.

Sheesh.

Just as a counterpoint...The Type P seems to armed with only one weapon per
hardpoint.  The example Free, Far, and Fat Traders seemed to have a mix of
a Beam Laser, Sand Caster, and Missile Rack in each turret.  Using this
model under High Guard gives them each six batteries, tow each of laser,
missile, and sand.  Since HG is uses an "all hit or all miss" for resolving
battery fire, the merchants actually have a greater chance to hit and score
damage than the pirate.  The merchants also have something the pirate does
not, a defence against incoming laser fire from the sand casters.

Finally, when it comes to taking damage the merchant can soak up twice as
many weapons hits before it has lost its weapons.

Finally, IIRC you will recieve one hit per point that your HG weapons
factor exceeds the hull code of the target.  Three fully maxed laser
turrets are IIRC 4.  Against a Free or Far trader each time you hit with a
full turret you have two chances of vaporizing your prey.

Perhaps the pirate would be better served by mixing his turrets too?

*confused look* Under FFS2 at least, Laser Comms at TL10 and up are the
only way to go for long distance communications (except using your AEMS to
send Morse code across most of the subsector, of course).

Under the DSR the thing that stuffs the Pirate\'s sensor profile is firing
up the engines to power movement, weapons etc - if it\'s using Heplar \'dash
packs\' (a high-gee limited fuel Heplar engine designed to deliver 4 gees
for 4 hours), then it\'s going to stand out like nobody\'s business.

As far as I can see, there are two basic sets of answers for the above -
those that make piracy difficult, and those that make piracy well nigh
impossible.

If ships retain realspace vectors, then ships coming out of jumpspace in a
different systems are going to be going fast - in some cases, very fast.
This means that \'hide and lurk\' doesnt work as well any more, because a
lurking pirate has to stay at rest relative to the planet (otherwise she
has to fire up the power plant to correct vectors, and that results in a
higher than desirable sensor profile).

If ships come out where they want, then planets assign known, patrolled
exit points.

If ships come out at a random point, then we are facing the 200-1 odds that
my earlier post indicated.

I think navigators should have some influence on where and when you come
out (I am kicking the idea that both Navigation and Gunnery are
\'impossible\' skills - a good Navigator can make a ship behave in ways not
predicted by jumpspace theory, and a good gunner can fire through the veil
of speed-of-light lag to hit a target far more often than they should).
Heck, I could even cope with a great Navigator being able to predict where
and when in realspace a ship will exit (there is a *reason* the Sayat are
so superstitious).

For the purposes of the post, yes.

*shrug*  I say again, that wasn\'t the intention of the post.  If my character 
was to try to take a prize, he\'d do it with the best information availiable, 
and hopefully, with inside help to prevent the jump from happening.  It\'s 
amazing what can happen if somebody pulls the fuses at a really significant 
moment, particularly if your goal is to make a living at piracy, not just get 
shot at all the time.  BTW, historically, IMTU, about 50% of all piracy 
incidents were discovered to be insurance scams and most of the rest had 
inside help.  The people that got caught simply didn\'t know how to do it right.

Let\'s face it, interstellar piracy is a *business*, just like everything else. 
 This implies there are going to be certain strategies that *will* pay off and 
others that *won\'t*.  My take is, a *lot* of pirates are amatuers who think 
they can pull off a couple quick scores and retire.  These are the ones that 
get caught.  Then there are the *pros*.  They don\'t get caught as often.  And 
they make money.

IMTU, kinda-sorta.  If you head directly away from the planet with the target 
system on the other side of the planet you just left, you\'ll misjump.  Jump 
drive IMTU works on the principle that there can be no significant 
gravitational fields between you and your target system.

IMTU, yeah.

On the 100 diameter jump limit sphere, in direct line-of-sight with the 
originating system, unless the Navigator programs the jump to \'come up short\' 
of the 100 diameter jump limit.

> What difference can a good navigator make to where entering or where

My take is, the skill of the Navigator has an effect on the possibility of 
misjumps, but even the most skilled one can\'t alter the laws of physics 
<ducking>.

It\'s not a flame war.  It\'s just that some people refuse to read what\'s in the

This assumes escort by the aforesaid SDB.  The original post (damn, I oguhta 
trademark that saying!) specified no such escort because that wasn\'t the 
intent of the post.  Without escort, the Target is out of range of the SDB 
after it leaves the 500K klick \'bubble of protection\' of said SDB.  In the 
aforementioned Original Post(tm), the Target can be up to 780K klicks from 
Jump point when it leaves the bubble.

Because I threw out some math and said \'What do you think?" and got back \'This 
can\'t happen in *MY* TU because I *SAY* it can\'t.  Then I rebutted.  Then they 
rebutted.  Ad nauseum.

Actually, every rebuttal so far has attempted to change the basic assumptions.  And I *purposely* made them as broad and relevant as possible, except where noted.  This makes the whole thread relevant.  Frankly, I didn\'t believe the numbers I got for the \'slow pass\' until I ran them 3 times and came up with the same answers.  I was under the distinct impression that the \'fast pass\' would allow the soonest response.  I was wrong.  I just didn\'t mention my built-in beliefs, I just posted the math.  I only started getting into specifics IMTU when asked about them.

And by the way, it\'s Kev*E*n.  My parents were *quite* specific about that.

IMNSFBHO, inbound intercepts are classed in what I tend to call \'almost good 
ideas\', since it *sounds* good at first, but when you look at the math, you 
find out differently fast.  An inbound intercept will take you *deeper* into 
the grav well, where you *don\'t* want to go.  Almost a good idea, since this 
also puts you closer to where the Defenders lurk.  This tells me, outbound 
intercepts are the way to go.

Now, I don\'t claim to have the first bloody *clue* how far a ship can be 
detected at, but the books that I have here in my possession say that that 
it\'s on the order of 600K klicks for a military craft.  Two light-seconds.  
Safe jump difference from a Size 8 planet is 1,280K klicks, over twice the 
detection limit by a military sensor suite.  That 1,280K klicks is written in 
stone.  This tells me a starship can throw the loudest block party they want 
at the 100 diameter \'curb\' of a Size 8 world and nobody\'ll know they\'re there.

If you assume even *minimal* brains of a professional pirate, you\'ll realise 
they\'ll take outbound prizes, not inbound ones.  Inbound ones are a good way 
to spend your formative years on a prison planet.

Under the HG ship combat system, gunnery is ignored as it\'s assumed to be 
factored for already.  <shrug>  Same thing with navigation; it\'s an abstract 
system.  IMNSFBHO, these skills should have *some* bearing, though not so much 
on the navigation part unless the navigator is recalculating an emergency jump 
while under attack, in which case, you want the best navigator you can get.

If you have two triple turrets grouped as one USP4 battery, the first hit
drops it to USP3 (and is a kill of 3x lasers at least 1.5Mcr, the next hit
reduces the remaining turret to USP2, then USP1 etc. So the ship can take 4
hits before the laser is down.

If they are grouped as two USP3 hits the progression is USP3 - hit 1 first
battery killed remaining USP 3 - hit 2 USP2 - hit 3 USP1 - hit 4 last
battery killed.

(of course, TL13+ Beam lasers are 1 USP factor higher).

Is there an advantage to keeping two batteries at a lower USP? I don\'t
think that there is after ther first hit.... However, until the first hit
you get two attack rolls.

But a USP 4 battery will automatically cause a critical on a 399 dT or less
ship. Against a Beowulf it will cause 2 criticals on the first hit, wereas
a USP3 will cause just the one.... this will kill the JDrive on a roll of
7.

So, does the chance of a critical (which on TL13 ships sould actually be
the chance of three criticals off one battery, or 4 criticals off two
batteries) outway the downgraded weapon USP?


One thing  that I was never sure of is if you reroll if the equipment is
not present on the ship when you roll damage (eg does a weapon hit become a
re-roll if the battery is gone?).

IIRC, (and I *DO*, since I have the Original Post(tm) handy) I specified that 
the Intruder\'s Type P had been upgraded to full triple laser turrets.  The 3 
single laser turrets are the \'original equipment\'.  And anybody who *DIDN\'T* 
upgrade those turrets FAST is gonna have a short career followed by a fast 
funeral.  If it was me, I\'d *seriously* look into upgrading the computer, too, 
as under HG and CT, the difference of the computers is a serious die mod.

Hmmm?  If the merchie has 4 weapons vs 3 batteries on the Type P, the merchie 
can only take 4 weapons hits and it\'s out of business.  The Type P can take 3 
hits per turret to take it out, or 9 weapon hits total.  Me thinks you got the 
two mixed up there...

OK, there\'s where I threw in the USP by battery \'fix\'.  Each battery on the P, 
having only 3 lasers, would have a USP of 3, not 4.  Under the standard 
assumption, you can take, for example, a 3KT boat and put 30 single laser 
turrets on it, each turret configured as its own battery.  The ship\'s USP 
value for the lasers is 8, unless they\'re TL13 or better lasers, in which 
case, they\'re Factor 9.  Now, each laser is its own battery.  Does each 
battery now attack as Factor 8, or does it attack as Factor 1?  Think very 
carefully about this now.

30 Factor 8 shots means your 3KT boat can outshoot a heavy cruiser.  Odd are, 
at least 15 of those shots will hit and penetrate.  On a 400 ton hull, they\'ll 
also inflict 4 critical hits for each hit, since if your weapons factor is 
greater than the USP hull size, you get the difference in criticals.  We\'re 
looking at 60 critical hits per combat round.  There\'s a 1 in 11 chance that 
the ship will be vaporised.  60 critical hits makes this a statistical 
certainty.  See what I mean?

Now, if those 30 lasers attack as Factor 1 lasers (the USP value of the 
battery), there are no critical hits, and 1 stray laser won\'t vaporise your 
ship.  You\'ll still get statistical hits every combat round.  You\'ll still do 
damage, but it\'ll be more of the \'scrape the turrets off the bad guy\' kind.  
Which do *YOU* want to see?  Which do you want used on *YOU*?

> Perhaps the pirate would be better served by mixing his turrets too?

It\'s a tossup, actually...

I think the "canon war" has resurfaced. Bit like the Fourth Frontier War,
no official announcement, we just fell into it. ;-)

OK, so here\'s my take:

1. Traveller is a *game*.

2. Traveller was written by a number of different people over the years,
and not all of them knew all of the background. This means there are going
to be areas that do not dovetail together very well.

3. Suggestion: if you find one of these glitches, share it with the TML and
ask for constructive solutions in a way that allows structured questions,
discussion, constructive criticisms, and (ESPECIALLY) game hooks. For
example:

CANON PROBLEM 1: How can we reconcile the statements that the Marches was
surveyed in \'52, and First Survey was completed in ????, but Andor and
Candory were not discovered until 802?
DISCUSSION POINT 1.1: for the *real* answer, see my point 2 above.
POSSIBLE SOLUTION 1.1: the planets were indeed discovered by the Scouts,
but the information was hidden from the general public until 802. Maybe the
Imperium was forced to reveal them in 802 because that was the time that
the first Droyne starship left the world?
     PROBLEMS WITH 1.1: But why? Psionics wasn\'t a problem in the early 3I.
     FIX FOR SOLUTION 1.1: There\'s something else there that the 3I wants
to keep hidden. <GAME HOOK - slip in and investigate the worlds on behalf
of a megacorp, etc>
POSSIBLE SOLUTION 1.2: the Droyne made the Scouts forget.
     PROBLEMS WITH 1.2: do you really want the Droyne to be able to do
that? I don\'t, since I have a Psi-15 Droyne PC I want to keep under control
- - but see the SJG G:T adventures in the Marches if you want to get
worried...
POSSIBLE SOLUTION 1.3: the Scouts *didn\'t* check out every world.
Remembering the reference that the 3I expanded through the Marches in a
root-and-branch fashion, maybe the Scouts were flat out surveying the

IISS passage to Darrian or deliberately misled them? <GAME HOOK - the U of

CANON PROBLEM 2: How did they lose Ruie?
DISCUSSION POINT 2.1: the *real* answer is that "Rescue on Ruie" was
written when only the Regina subsector had been detailed, not the entire
Marches along with its pseudo-history. When you only look at Regina, Ruie
is at the edge of the map and therefore could be seen to be "lost" outside
the border.
POSSIBLE SOLUTION 2.1: change the meaning of "lost" to mean simply "lost to
the Imperium" - go with the other canonical reference that says Ruie
declined to join the 3I. From the POV of the 3I (and Regina) the world is
"lost" to them - but would always be welcome back into the fold, much like
the Vulcan\'s view of Romulus... <GAME HOOK - have PC nobles/diplomats try
to get Ruie to return to the 3I!!>

(which, OK _is_ what Hans is trying to do ;-).

As a character, I\'d tend to pass on the really really REALLY big prizes no 
matter how juicy they look.  If I was in a properly decked out Type P, my 
targets would be Sub-R\'s & Sub-M\'s, with the occaisional Far, Free, or Fat 
trader thrown in.  Scout ships I might take, if only to strip out their sensor 
suites and scrap out the rest.  After I got my sensors maxxed out, I wouldn\'t 
bother with them.

As an employee of an official Microsoft OEM builder and a technical support
engineer, I will assure you that this is 99.99% likely to be a scam.

1) Text files (which is what you transmit via your email) will NOT erase
squat from your hard drive. Attatchments, on the other hand, be them .EXE
files or Macro\'s for certain programs can do harm to your machine, but
these must be decoded and run by the user and will not execute upon reading
the email.

2) Microsoft is not in the business of investigating malicious programs.
Semantec or Network Associates (the makers of Norton Anti-Virus and McCaffe
Anti-Virus respectively) would likely be the one\'s to announce such
malicious programs.

I have seen scads of scams like this over email and ICQ, and never have I
ever lost anything from my computer due to something someone sent me over
either media.

Actually, the thread started when someone postulated that the INTRUDER made
a fake scream fof help to draw a nearby merchant in close, and I noted that
any SDB\'s in the area would respond to such a call even before the intruder
opened fire. It somehow got out of hand after that, so I backed out. To
many numbers started flying and I didn\'t want to start a debate on rule
sets.

<shrug>  FFS is beyond my experience.  But I assumed that the Target could get 
a message out to the planet and thereby call up the Defender.  This was 
specified in the Original Post(tm), just not the mechanics of the Scream.

Again, I don\'t have or use the DSR, since I don\'t run an MT or \'newer\' campaign.  I still haven\'t had the time to sit down and do Serious Thinking(tm) on MT ship construction.

I think I was the person who used this particular phrase.

The reason I used it is that nanotech - self-replicating, tailored
micromachines - are such a radical development that it could not exist in
limited form - it would revolutionise the structures of Known Space.

As it is, we have a hard enough time assuming scarcity, given the
availiability of power and resources available to higher technology societies.

If you assume nanomachinery and nanofabrication, you get a very different
sort of universe - something a lot more akin to Moorcock\'s The Dancers at
the End of Time than to the universe of hard-scrabbling traders, down on
their luck veterans and disinherited nobles that Traveller reflects.

If you add cybertech that allows direct interface to information sources,
then you get happening to knowledge what nanofabrication did to the
material things.

It could be a great environment to roleplay in (John Hughes\' Rites of
Passage was set in such a world, and it\'s one of the best convention games
I\'ve played), but it wouldnt be Traveller.

It\'s like saying \'It\'s a society like Medieval Britain, but they have
maize\' - if you have maize, then your economic structure is so different
that you just wouldnt have medieval Britain any more.

Duh.  I was making a point of using canon examples of the ships in

No.  Thirty single lasers organized as thirty batteries would have a
battery factor based on only ONE beam or pulse weapon plus TL mods.  If
they were _ALL_ grouped together, that is, thirty turrets each w/ one
weapon, and fired as ONE battery, then and only then would you get the
higher factor.  Remember, the USP factor is for a _SINGLE_BATTERY_ of the
weapon type, not a factor based on the total number of weapons mounted on
the craft.

Based on the statement I made above, this is invalid.  Besides, to have
enough weapons mounts to have 30 factor 8 batteries will take a hull
somewhere around 30,000 tons.

If I was a pirate, and wanted my prize intact, I\'d have the weapons fire as
individual batteries.  I seem to recall (I\'m at work so I don\'t have the
book handy) that it stated if a turret was filled, and all the weapons were
the same, that they would then comprise a single battery firing at the
factor as shown on the chart.  They would not be firing individualy.

I follow you so far...

But you still have another battery of USP3, which is now down to USP2.  You\'d

Yeah.  Which means, first hit knocks the mirrors out of alignment?  Further 
hits do \'real\' damage?

Two batteries means two attack rolls.  I\'m asking if each battery fires on its 
own, why use the full ship\'s USP weapon factor for hit and damage 
determination?  30 lasers on a ship means USP8.  30 batteries of 1 laser each 
means 30 attack rolls.  Are these rolls resolved at USP8, or are they resolved 
at USP1?  It\'s only *1* laser hitting per hit, not all of them.

Disabled, not destroyed.  <grin>  But the whole Target is toast if you roll a 
2 and vaporise the damned thing.  Not Good.

That\'s the question, isn\'t it?  I\'m surprised this hasn\'t come up before.

Me either, and I\'ve seen it done both ways.  A thought:  If you wanna be RILLY nasty, take it on the weapon again.  Factor-0 means you replace the whole damned weapons system at cost.  Another hit & you\'re at USP -1, which means, the weapon is welded to the turret now.  You don\'t even get scrap value out of it.  Another hit and it\'s now USP -2 means the turret is now welded to the ship and replacing it is gonna be a REAL bitch in time and money.  <grin>

I haven\'t had the chance to seriously play with CC@.  It\'s one of those \'I\'m 
gonna play with this puppy one of these days\' things.  But Galactic does an 
iffy job of drawing a map, particularly if you play with the colorset a bit

Every play with Mick Bailey\'s Trav Tools?  I like it a lot.  It makes some nice
maps.

While everyone is free (and usually does) to alter the Official
Traveller Universe, published material should be consistant--or at
least say that it is, or is not canon to the internal workings of
the OTU.

Canon should be stuck to at least internally for writers of
traveller stuff, IMO. Variants are fine, too, but history can\'t be
too variant or it makes no sense.

Just my Cr2.

The reason I didn\'t upgun the Defenders is because they were already maxxed

<thwaping head>  It\'s been awhile since I looked that far forward in the book. 
 You\'re right.  I was figuring the ship\'s UWP as the total of *ALL* weapons of 
that type and \'fixing\' it as a battery. D\'oh.  Same result, in the end, I just 
look like I need more sleep on that point.

Mixed turrets are allowed on ships under 1KT.  A battery can be from 1 to 10 
turrets.

Fuel Treatment: On board fuel purification plant
Construction time: ?
Comments: This battle rider tender is designed for maximum flexibility using a
modular approach; the tender carriers her jump fuel in exterior demountable
fuel tanks. Each 4 tanks carried provides the fuel for a Jump 1. She can trade
Battle rider payload for Jump range. For an example, she can carry 24 fuel
tanks to take advantage of her Jump-6 capability; but this means she can only
carry 5 Battle riders. At Jump-4, she can carry a more respectable 13 Battle
riders. This design is in competition with a modular tender that mounts only
Jump-4 drives. The shorter ranged tender can carry more riders, as her engines
are smaller, but the Admiralty feels that the advantage of Jump-5 and 6
Batrons are useful too. The Admiralty will probably procure both designs, with
the Jump-4 tenders based in the fringes of the Imperium, and the Empress class
tenders based in the interior, as an emergency response force of the Strategic
Reserve. Both tender designs are intended to be used with the new Emperor
class Battle riders. The Admiralty was rumored to have been unhappy with the
long refueling times of the tender due to the small fuel tanks of the Emperor
class Battle riders, and ordered Buships to to add a 10,000 ton fuel tender
and a bay for it to be incorporated into the design. This space was supposed
to carry troops and/or fighters and their launch facilities, but buOps will
mission-task fighter and/or assault carriers (variants of the Emperors) into
the Batron organizations as needed. This tender can also be used as a fast
fleet Fuel tanker if needed.

Construction time: ?
Comments: This Battlerider tender is designed as a competitor to the Jump 6
capable Empress class. By reducing her drives to a fleet standard Jump 4, she
has gained another 3 Battlerider bays. This has saved 140,100 MC from her
cost, and she needs 400 fewer engineroom crew. She has also eliminated the
need for a refueling shuttle, as she would always have at least 16
Battleriders embarked as only 16 of the 32 bays have to be filled with jump
fuel tanks. She can be completely refueled in 8 trips by her riders. Her
critics point out however that her lack of jump 5 and 6 capability  is a flaw,
and the ability to move heavy fleet elements at these jumps are strategically
priceless.  Never the less, because of her lower cost, it is expected that the
Admiralty will order at least 3 to 4 Duchess’s for each Empress class tender.
The Admiralty will probably deploy a Duchess equipped Batron in every fourth
subsector (4 per sector), and an Empress Batron at the Sector Depot. In
addition, for every Empress Batron deployed at sector depots, one will be
deployed at the Core Depot  as part of the Imperial Strategic reserve.

comments: This Battle rider was designed to operate with Empress class tenders
(whose bay size was designed for this battle rider). This ship was designed to
be the smallest design that could carry: 1) the largest available Meson gun 2)
maximum defenses (screens and armor). She also has a big enough power plant to
maintain maximum agility with her weapons active, and the fastest, most
advanced computers available. A flagship variant is available that has a
second Bridge for an Admiral and his/her staff at the cost of 500 tons of
armor (2 factors).  The 25 person ship’s security troop detachment is landed
to provide staterooms for the flagstaff. A  fighter Carrier, and a troop
carrier variant are under consideration to give a Batron more flexibility, as
well as a fuel tender variant to allow the Battle rider tender to be refueled
quicker, or to operate as a Fleet tanker. A contraversial decision was made to
organise the caster and laser batteries into 1 turret batteries instead of 10
turret ones. This requires many more gunners and means that the turrets are
incapable of stopping a missile barrage from a ship’s weapon bay or from
ship’s turrets, but provides a much larger anti-fighter and anti-fighter
missile umbrella as 10 times the targets can be engaged.

Comments: An experimental fuel tender for the Empress class Battle rider
tender. This vessel ensures that even if the tender has no battle riders
embarked; she can be refueled. This vessel has staterooms for her crew, which
is unusual for a fuel tender for two reasons. The first reason is that the
tender was designed after the Empress class tender was (because of the Buships
decision to add a fuel tender). The second reason is that if this design
should prove successful, she can be adapted for other uses, and crew quarters
gives her the endurance that a small craft lacks.

2. Fire as close as they can get without being suspicious. If they
fire at long ranges, or if the target isn\'t evading, then they
should be able to get some kind of bonus on attack--at least the

I always thought this was the dark secret of Shugilis.
In olden times, the vast majority would be kept ignorant of the source
of their protein, and the complex cooking processes would disguise
the source of the food.

As the Vilani developed agriculture and settled other worlds, the need
need and practice of using the dear departed as dinner would be gone,
but the ritual and traditions of the Shugili would still be firmly in place.

So, I like the cannibalism as a dark secret of Vilani history.

I think this can exist along Joe Webb\'s ideas.  Not every dead Vilani would
be cannibalized.  And those who knew of the practice might put corpses on
display, in the manner suggested by Joe, to prevent the Shugili from processing
the deceased. I think this would be especially true for community and family
leaders.  Then, over time, the practice of ancestors on display might become
more popular, at the same time the need for quick and handy protein sources
diminishes.

So, the secret reason for ancestors on display is to prevent them from being
consumed.

Works for me.

  Specifically, a non-evading target means a long range that is limited only
by ones ability to achieve damaging energy densities at range. As an anti-
piracy measure one can amuse oneself by designing truly ludicrous weapons
(FS Weapons Div., anyone?) like the variant (deviant?) Com-Sat that some
commie sicko posted a ways back, and deploy them solely to slowly roast
targets that are matching ballistic trajectories out near the 100-D limit.

The USP is figured for the number of weapons IN THAT BATTERY. Not
the total number on the ship. If one laser is factor 1, then 30
batteries of 1 laser means 30 factor 1 attacks.

It was typical to have uniform Battery strengths, so a ship might
have a laser USP of 8, but iunderneath it would say "Batteries" and
Batteries Bearing."

(I don\'t remember where lasers are in the USP! :-)

		-XXXX8-
Batteries	     A
Batteries Bearing    9


This would mean the ship has 10 batteries of factor 8, and any 9
could fire at the same target.

Hope this helps.

Cremation is an alternative.  Many human cultures practiced this in antiquity
and continue to do so today.  Many American Indian tribes, especially
plains tribes, but by no means all of them.  Some, if not most Vikings,
used to put dead warriors on boats then set them afire.

Putting a dead body in the ground can be a real dumb idea depending on
the water table.

So, combine some of the ideas already mentioned.

Dead Vilani will be consumed by internal microfauna.
This process is not pretty, so the dead were cremated
after being ritualistically prepared, perhaps by a precursor
to the Shugili class; possibly cremated outside of view.
When necessary for survival, dead vilani would be harvested
by the Shugili.

Non-Shugili community leaders who view the practice as a
necessary evil choose not to participate and prefer to be
entombed.  Funereal processes remove the microfauna or
meutralize it.  (Perhaps these intestinal microfauna could
assist Shugili in preparing Vland-native foods for Vilani
consumption?).  Dead leader doesn\'t decompose and
remains available to be viewed and inspire the community
spirit.

As time goes by, and society advances: the Vilani diet becomes
unnecessary, entombment becomes more popular as a status
symbol with large tombs for families becoming the norm.
While cremation fades from common practice, except possibly
for emergences, deaths in space, in war, etc.  Although, cremation
would make a resurgence when Solomani illnesses and diseases
start to spread. It could even serve as a sort of cultural unity
focus.  A return to the ancient and traditional practice of cremation
in response to disease-ridden incursions of Solomani.

  As an aside to the intercept timing, wouldn\'t most pros retire after
taking (and selling, presumably?) one or two (call it "a few") ships?
This is pertinent to indicating that their behaviour pattern is rational
and helpful in indicating the equilibrium level of activity by properly
prepared pirates.

These sats at the 100 diameter \'curb\', they can be shot at, right?  And I thought energy weapons could only be used at close range.  Something about the ball of energy dissipating over distance...

Just to make clear.  What some of us are pointing out is that there
is no "need".  Canabalism can never make up for a lack of nutrition
in the environment.  Others have pointed out the problems with
systematic canabalism.  The Vilani would have no more reason
to engage in cannibalism than Terrans.

Nor do I think that the Shugili are going to be able to keep
using bodies for food in any systematic way a secret (I won\'t
take that long for someone to start wanting to know where
the bodies are ending up).  Nor do I see much motivation
for them to do so.

Ritual cannibalism does exist and one can invoke it for the Vilani
(though I see not reason why they would be more prone to it
than others).

Well, from me, I took your numbers, and showed under what conditions the
Intruder would be able to close and board and have enough time to loot and
get away.

Then we found another assumption, namely that jump courses are very
specific in the time and space you require.

Is this just civilian jump programs, or are military ships under the same
restrictions ? If they are, it is going to make escaping from battle quite
difficult.

We also found a second assumption, namely that the Target was exactly where
the Intruder wanted it to be.

Math can be made to show anything, if you fix the assumptions well enough.
In the end, it\'s the assumptions that count ...

>If you assume even *minimal* brains of a professional pirate, you\'ll realise 
>they\'ll take outbound prizes, not inbound ones.  Inbound ones are a good way 
>to spend your formative years on a prison planet.

Personally, I assume that minimally intelligent professional pirates will
take their ships somewhere far away, and either sell it, or rent themselves
out as mercenaries or commerce raiders. It\'s much safer, and closer to
profitable.

Taking outbound prizes is completely, totally reliant on your assumption
that jump courses cannot be calculated on the fly.

If you drop that assumption, then pirates can take neither inbound nor
outbound prizes.

Having outbound courses on Captain\'s Discretion beyond 10 diameter for
unescorted ships also badly hurts our lurking pirate.

As does having some escorts for rent at the starport (class C starports can
maintain non-jump craft, and an uparmed Type S Detatched Duty scout is well
suited for this role).

Or having the starport announce that \'The outgoing Convoy is at 1400 hours,
and will be escorted by HMS Ditzammer\'.

The point of my side of the whole Piracy debate is unless you make some
major changes to how Traveller technology works, or assume major stupidity
by the pirate chasers, or both, then you do not get piracy around
mainworlds in systems with signifigant trade or economies.

This does not mean you have no piracy. Not at all. It just happens, in
effect, to people who consent to take those risks - like the PCs who took
that profitable shipping contract to the worldlet 30 diameters out from a
gas giant, 15 AU from the mainworld\'s defenses ...

  There appears to be a glitch in B:2 (1981; 2nd ed?) on the Starship
Encounters chart, p.35: The +2 DM for "naval base in system" needed to
get a total over 13 can\'t happen using sysgen in B:3, p. 10 for port
types C & D, both of which go to 14+ on the B:2 chart.

  Is this an erratum?

Seriously though, higher levels of gunnery may express themselves as
better use of the equipment, better knowledge of what the equipment
can do, perhaps even hazing towards fields more often covered by
Sensor Ops and Ship Tactics - a better understanding of what the
data on the fire control scanner means, a better feel for what your
ship\'s captain is going to do next, a better guess at what the other
captain is going to do next. 

Maybe a really good gunner on lasers is tweaking the system to get
a higher effective ROF out of it? Gunnery does include the maintenance
of starship weapons. Perhaps a guy with Gunnery Zero is missing
firing opportunities, or simply has such a poorly maintained fire
control system that he\'s not going to hit anything but a luck shot anyway.

As for missile gunnery, the missile duels in the Honor Harrington books
were an entertaining example - missile fire control in a high-speed
strategy competition with point defense.

Navigation effects will depend so heavily on YTU that I won\'t touch \'em
here.

Depends on *why* they got into that line of work in the first place.  A lot of 
the Reavers in Reavers\' Deep were out to found their own colonies and 
interstellar nations.  That took money.  They also needed to defend these 
infant states.  That took ships.

FWIW, I\'d say my best WAG is that 90% of pirates are the amatuers.  The other 
10% are pros.  <shrug>  Of course, the amatuers would tend to get thinned out 
pretty quickly, thus increasing the overall intelligence of the gene pool...

  Hopefully the attacker doesn\'t have a telescope, or a sensor op as good
as one of Mr. Smiths pirate ships :)  Seriously though, being a truly
ballistic target is a bad idea against lasers - see the Striker rules for
PD fire versus artillery for inspiration.

>Finally, the two most common ships that most likely would do the intercept
would be either a Dragon-class SDB or a Gazelle-class Close Escort.  HG
weapons factors vs a generic Type P corsair with either of these ships
indicate no critical hits using the HG combat system.  Somehow, I *don\'t*
see a Type P being chased by a Tigress-class battleship, if for no other
reason than the Tigress would be abandoning its post to do the intercept.

  Why would the Gazelle be the most common ship for planetary patrols for which
it is extremely inefficient? Unless you\'re referring to Imperial patrols to any
worlds which might not be able to support their own assets efficiently? Also, a
Dragon is far from being a high end SDB - even restricting discussion to the
"light" units of 1000 Dt and under.

They haven\'t been arguing the math as much as they\'ve been arguing

create a special case that won\'t be found in "reality" often enough (or
even close to often enough) to be very relevant.

IMTU, a running jump is possible. Veteran crews (including experienced
Free Trader captains) will do one in preference to being shot up and
boarded. Less skilled crews (such as one will often find on a
subsidized merchant) may not be capable of making a running jump
safely and would probably heave to.

OK, there\'s where I threw in the USP by battery \'fix\'.  Each battery on the P, 
having only 3 lasers, would have a USP of 3, not 4.  Under the standard 
assumption, you can take, for example, a 3KT boat and put 30 single laser 
turrets on it, each turret configured as its own battery.  The ship\'s USP 
value for the lasers is 8, unless they\'re TL13 or better lasers, in which 
case, they\'re Factor 9.  Now, each laser is its own battery.  Does each 
battery now attack as Factor 8, or does it attack as Factor 1?  Think very 
carefully about this now.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
A 3ktn boat can put 30 triple laser turrets on itself. If it wants them to
be factor-8 (9 at TL13), it has to group them into 10-turret batteries
and will get three whopping big shots - though still not big enough
shots to do criticals on anything 1000tns or bigger.

If the 3ktn boat wants each turret to be a battery, each battery will only
be (IIRC) factor-3 - but you will indeed get thirty shots.

Battery factor ratings in High Guard are based on how many weapons
are in that battery (and the tech level modifier). I really don\'t understand
where the idea of a 3ktn boat with 30 factor-8 laser batteries on it comes
from, perhaps I\'m misreading something - it looks like Keven rated the
lasers based on how many lasers there were, then put all the lasers
into each and every turret.

You can only have each laser be it\'s own (factor-1) battery if you
have ten or fewer turrets. On a ship this small, the HG rules fudge
a bit to let you treat each weapon on _mixed weapon_ turrets as
it\'s own battery, to allow those Free Traders with mixed turrets a
place in the game.

One thing to note, though. A larger factor will cause critical hits on
ships under 1000tns, but once your target hits 1000tns or more
the only effect a higher factor has is to increase the chance of hitting
and overcoming sandcasters.

You are allowed to do just that!  The key to this is simplicity itself.  The
authors are busy trying to produce more material to make a living.  They
don\'t have the luxury of going back and correcting something that is 15 - 20
years old.  Especially if they no longer have the rights to certain pieces
of the material.  No matter how much bitching you do, you are the only one
that is so anally rententive that you believe that changes are still
necessary after 15+ years.

If you refuse to buy them then you set yourself up to be in this situation.

Hans I just can\'t figure you out here.  You make a good case for things
(Pirates Wars Included) but in the process you "talk" down to people like
they are just too dense to understand what you\'re saying.  Everyone
basically understands, we all seem to have an intelligence at least equal to
an egg plant. That should be enough to get us into the ball park of your
logic.  What almost everyone has been saying to you is....IT DON\'T
MATTER!!!....Sure we would all love to see all the little glitches fixed,
but is it going to take away from the FUN of the game. Its highly probable
that it is taking away from some of your FUN but you still play the game.
Yes it does detract from the game a bit but not the FUN!

Let\'s get back to the point I was making earlier in this message.  Loren,
Marc and others are trying to make a living off these stories. If for some
reason you have a problem with something (that they have no control over or
better yet, have no time to dedicate to these nits) then send them an eMail.
You know and I know that they wouldn\'t have the time to argue one way or the
other on the TML.  If they made a canonical solution on high (without
consulting the TML)  then that would P.O. a whole new group of people that
are now going to be using up bandwidth to voice their opinions. It\'s much
easier on them to just sit back and let the one maniacal rantor carry on.

That gets me back to this; talking down to your contemporaries isn\'t going
to get you their support.  You are turning people off with your attitude
which is a shame because you gave me pause with some of the things you
pointed out.  Your observation ability is excellent, you attention to detail
is extraordinary, your use of the English language is wonderful, however,
your ability to communicate your ideas in a positive way sucks!

If one ship taken makes you wealthy enough to quit, there will be some

The Corsair profession, if you survive it, gets you pretty much the best

For the purposes of the Original Post(tm), I don\'t see how jump courses were 
relevant.  We got into *that* argument on the fly.  The Original Premise was, 
the Intruder and Target were at the 100 diameter limit.  Intruder\'s prize crew 
boards as Target\'s crew calls for help.  Defender responds.  I was looking to 
define the parameters for an engagement of Defender and Intruder under those 
conditions, not Intruder and Target; that combat was already finished.

Under CT LBB2, the 5th step of every turn half is the Computer Programming 
step.  The new computer program cannot be used until the next turn.  That\'s 1 
combat turn.

A Computer-3 has 5 spaces for active programs.  Assuming the pilot has 
Manuver/Evade-1 loaded, he\'s now down to 4 spaces (M/E-1 takes 1 space).  
Target takes 1 space and is needed to fire turrets.  3 spaces left.  Assume 
they\'ll want to run Gunner Interact to allow the gunners\' skill to be brought 
online.  That\'s another space.  2 left.If you\'ve got missiles, you\'re going to 
want to use them.  That means Launch has to be loaded.  1 space left. Generate 
creates the jump path.  You need Navigation *AND* the appropriate jump program 
loaded as well.  Generate takes up a space.  Thus, in a combat situation on a 
standard Type R liner, you can generate your Jump data in 1 turn, but you\'ll 
have to reprogram so you can actually *DO* your jump the next turn.

No, according to the Original Post(tm), the Target and Intruder were 
willy-nilly placed at the 100 diameter limit for the purpose of determining 
intercept from orbit strategies.

*shrug*  Doesn\'t mean you get to throw the math out if it doesn\'t fit your pet 
theories.  It means you get to look at your theories a bit harder.  As I 
already mentioned in a Previous Post, I fully expected the fastest response to 
the Intruder to be with the \'Fast Pass\' model.  The math didn\'t support this, 
and I commented on it.  Now, if I wanted to \'prove\' my pet theory that the 
\'Fast Pass\' was the optimum intercept strategy, I would have massaged the math 
to show this.  I didn\'t do that.

*shrug*  Again, it depends on their motivations.  I\'ve seen a lot of \'this

encounter table is *OBVIOUSLY* wrong\'.  *shrug*  YTU.  Mine, I go with the

Taking outbound prizes is dependent on the fact that under the specified 
ruleset, the average merchie is going to be too busy trying to save his own 
life to reprogram his computer to calculate and execute a jump on the fly.  
His stock computer just won\'t handle doing 7 things at once.  *shrug*  YMMV.

If you drop the assumption that computers can be instantly programmed at will 
and whim regardless of effects to the ship, your ship just *might* survive to 
get to the 100 diameter jump point.  Under the original CT rules, you didn\'t 
need to run a Generate program if you used pregenerated course tapes.  These 
tapes specify one jump solution at a prescribed transition speed.  Anything 
happening to the ship to keep that solution from happening is going to either 
cancel the jump or make the ship misjump.  Generate costs 1MCr and does not 
necessarily come stock with your ship.  You\'re allowed (computer number) MCr 
worth of software with the computer when you buy it.  Anything else you gotta 
buy later or write yourself.  Your software library is going to be expensive, 
since if you\'re capable of making a Jump-3, you need the Jump-3 program for it 
as well as Jump-2 program for a Jump-2 and the Jump-1 program to do a Jump-1 
or microjump.  the Jump-3 program will not do a Jump-1.  The combo costs 
800KCr.  Other programs cost other costs.  Generate costs 1MCr.  Which do you 
get?
 
> Having outbound courses on Captain\'s Discretion beyond 10 diameter for
> unescorted ships also badly hurts our lurking pirate.

If you\'re running a pregenerated tape, there is no Captain\'s Disgretion.  If 
you\'re not, you still have to load and run the Generate, Navigate, and Jump-x 
programs to jump.  Your opponent will get another shot at you the next turn 
which may disable you to the point where you can\'t jump.

A Type S can be upgunned to 1 triple turret.  The merchie has whatever it has. 
 The Type P is running 3 triple turrets as per assumption in the Original 
Post(tm).  Any hit from any of his triple turrets will cause at least 1 if not 
2 critical hits on the Type S.  Three guesses who two of the batteries will be 
targetting while the other keeps the merchie honest.

> Or having the starport announce that \'The outgoing Convoy is at 1400 hours,
> and will be escorted by HMS Ditzammer\'.

Around the Size 8 planet specified in the Original Post(tm), sooner or later 
the merchie will leave the detection range of planetary sensors.  It\'s a long 
way to the jump point.  And if the Intruder does detect said Defender 
escorting the Target, the Intruder can always wave off and let them go.  
Nothing says the pirates have to be stupid.  I don\'t buy indirect fire from 
something not even in sensor range.

My studies shows this not to be the case.  Assume you have 10 merchies flying 
out per day.  You\'ll need 10 SDBs just for escort duty if they don\'t want to 
convoy.  What\'s guarding your planet from that Tigress inbound while your SDBs 
are chasing down that nickel dime pirate?  You might get the pirate.  Your 
planet will get creamed.  And your SDB\'s will cost you about 770MCr per.   10 
of them will cost you 7.7BCr.

My take is, it can happen anywhere, but a pirate would be a damned fool to take inbounds or try to intercept anywhere else but near the 100 diameter limit.  And once the Target has taken hits, it\'s going to want to be past the 100 diameter limit as well, to reduce strain on jerryrigged systems and keep from having them cause him a misjump.

Under the ruleset specified in the Original Post(tm), ROF of every battery is 
1 shot per.  If you\'re running the proper Gunner Interact program, you can add 
the gunner\'s skill to the shot.

OK, so you\'re gonna resolve a 30 meter target butted up against another 30 
meter object at 500K klicks while you\'re moving at high speed?  You\'re over 
1.5 light-seconds out, too.  Can you say \'ridiculously impossible task roll\'?

Because they\'re relatively cheap as warships go.  And they\'re both standard designs which makes them cheaper in quantity.  They\'re also pretty heavily armed for their size class as well as heavily armoured in comparison to civilian targets.

A potential point of misunderstanding is the sensor stuff. I know
what B2 says, but many people on the list use other systems (some
are even "canon" :-) DSR is a more realistic way to model traveller
sensors, and the bottom line is that you can see a ship radiating
hundreds of MWs of power from a *long* way away. 

A scout ship is a naked eye object from the planetary surface :-)

Two things, one, I doubt that you\'ll see any pirates around
mainworlds in busy systems. Two, the SDB would be toast from a
Tigress long before it even got close enough to shoot. Anything
below a few thousand tons in traveller only ever engages with
smaller ships (like PC ships or pirates) since they are useless for
anything else.

This is closer to reality, IMHO.

The occational act of piray might well happen elsewhere, but
precisely because it is such a dumb thing to do--no one expects it,
and defences get lax.

If you\'re on an intercept course, they *aren\'t* moving :-)

All that matters is if they move rapidly in angle on the sky.

I\'ll agree that there is a decent chance of hitting the merchie, but
depending on the typical modes of piracy, they might not care. If
pirates usually kill off the target\'s crew, then the SDBs might say
screw it and blast \'em. If not, as they get closer, they can resolve
the target from the prey. This is a point that would be useful to
figure out in DSR. For most combat resolution isn\'t all that
important, but it would be in this kind of a case.

Maneuver/Evade adds random movements to the ship\'s vector to

Exactly.  I was counting up all the lasers the boat was carrying & using 
*that* number for the USP factor instead of all the lasers per battery.  
However, I was using the USP factor of each battery to \'fix\' something that 
was broken.  This didn\'t invalidate the math or the discussion.

*nod*  Personally, I\'m more of the \'do unto others\' school when it comes to shipboard weaponry.  I\'d rather have something that can dish it out rather than something that can take it.  It helps make the bad guys fall down a bit faster and makes things a bit easier on you.

   This is what I\'m talking about.  I could go on now to point out that
Canada\'s incidents of gun violence have actually increased since the
institution of stricter gun control, and that the numbers for the US are
concentrated in urban areas with strict gun control.  Undoubtedly you can
throw some more numbers at me, and so and so on.  This accomplishes nothing.

   As long as starship weaponry is around, you will have armed commercial
starships.  Space is too big for the navy or system defense forces to be
everywhere all the time, and there are simply too many worlds producing
starship weapons (and selling them to whoever can pay) to try to enforce
any kind of overall ban.

That turn is 1000seconds long, remember? You may have fired the
laser a half-dozen times, higher Gunnery skill (with Gunner
Interact running) would have let you correct off each shot enough to
increase your chance of getting one effective shot to hit. You still only
roll damage once, but the feedback from the other shots really makes
a difference in hitting.

I can see them *getting* some nanites.  I can\'t see them learning how to program the little buggers very easily.  Fact is, I can see my players go "WTF is this?  Sand???  We fought our way here for SAND????" and throwing the canister away.  <GRIN>

Not only more crop per acre, but vastly more yield per corn sown. Wheat did
between 3.5 and 6 to every corn sown in medieval Europe (ref Braudel,
Structures of Everyday Life), while Maize will do 50-1, and with none of
that multiple ploughing and harrowing work, either. There is a *good*
reason Hon-Eel (the daughter of the Red Goddess who brought Maize from the
Otherworld) is such an important goddess in Glorantha ...

Basically, with maize you go from needing 90%+ of your population on the
land and having regular famines, to needing 50% of your population on the
land, and having consistent food surpluses.

I\'m not completely happy with it, becuase shouldnt this sort of thing be
covered with the ability of the maintainence crew ? I thought that on
merchant ships, the gunners were usually stewards pulling double duty,
which leave the Engineering crew doing the maintainence work.

Yeah. You have to be real careful that you dont allow, for example, a
Navigator-5 to allow a merchant ship 40 jumps a year rather than 35, which
translates into the value of a small world per year with a megatrader.

A.  Probably not.  AAMOF, according to the stock CT encounter tables, you 
won\'t find them in any system with Type A or B starports.

B.  Not necessarily the case.  A good case can be made for fighters shooting 
nuke missiles at capital ships.  Nuke missiles would help scrape the USP down, 
so eventually, the capital ship\'s counterbattery fire is eventually gonna gun 
for them.  Lots of fighters = lots of targets to keep the Tigress busy.

I\'m not saying piracy won\'t take place in transplanetary space, I\'m saying

When you\'re at least 108 minutes from detection range at best speed, what\'s so dumb about it?  You\'ve got 108 minutes at least to fade into the woodwork, probably closer to 120 minutes; I\'d do the math, but I\'ve been up for 20 hours & answering all these damned emails for 9, so I\'ll pass on it & leave it as an exercise for teh Students.  <grin>

I always took it as it took time to recharge the weapon, thus the comment

yesterday.

The Defender crews won\'t get many hero buttons that way.  I was under the 
assumption that Defender\'s mission was to attack the Intruder and disable it 
for capture rather than toast anything in sight.  YMMV, but I\'d put any SDB 
crew that pulled a stunt like that up on charges in a Mishun minute if I were 
their squadron CO.  Whacking out honest merchie traffic is not a Good Thing.

Wow, you\'re right, I never noticed it. My 2d printing version has it
as well. That chart just plain sucks when you look at it. Piracy
should get more likely with crappier facilities, and there shouldn\'t
be any on 14+ rolls IMO (a pirate dumb enough to strike a Naval Base

In order for this to work properly: All canon Traveller materials should be
available to all players. This has not happened and will not happen so this
can not work properly in all cases.

Who wants to detail a subsector with intricate political connections, trade
routes, and interesting cultures to find out it can\'t ever be considered as
canon because the same subsector was detailed in an old supplement that has
been out of print for 20 years. Maybe 5-10% of the entire Traveller
population may have that particular issue, but it stands, even if it\'s
inferior to the newer one that someone did...

Or even worse than that, if a supplement that came out 15 years ago says
sentient alien race "X" lives on a moon of a gas giant in Subsector "Z", and
now your subsector can\'t be canon because it
has no gas giant at that location, nor any mention of that sentient race.

My points are the following:

    Canon is only a good thing when it is an aid to creativity. The second
canon stifles creativity, canon goes out the window.

    Canon was decided by the people who wrote for magazines like the JTAS
and submitted supplements to GDW. Alot has happened in the 20 years since
the heyday of Traveller. Trends in science-fiction have changed, and science
itself has advanced. Traveller canon, at least as far as equipment and
weapons go, does not entirely jibe with the way history has really gone. If
it\'s a choice between insulting the sensibilities of my players by sticking
to canon, or tossing canon out the window in favor of making the game fun
for my players... Guess where canon\'s going.

    The fact that people are willing to tell others that what they\'re doing
isn\'t canon, and as a result "isn\'t Traveller" more or less drove me from
posting regularly on the list in the first place. It gets old and tired to
hear that "the Vilani were resistant to change, so this technology never got
developed". This is a common response when somebody proposes that certain
technologies should be more prominent in Traveller.

Genetic engineering? "The Vilani are resistant to change."
Computers? "The Vilani are resistant to change."
AI or any sort? "The Vilani are resistant to change."
Nanotech? "The Vilani are resistant to change."

Why play a sci-fi game at all if you\'re going to remove the chance to
extrapolate current trends in science into the far future? Anytime anyone
tries to tailor the Traveller universe in any significant way he\'s met with
a wall of hostility. What\'s worse is even if the new way makes more sense
and is thought out _at_ least as well people still scream and moan about it.

Do we want a consistent well thought out science-fiction universe, or do we
really want the 17th/18th century in space?

I ignored computer programs for the purpose of the Original Post(tm) because I 
wasn\'t showing actual combat, merely intercept strategies.  I don\'t have 
Mayday, either.  Under CT, M/E doesn\'t cost you that 1G, but also only defends 
against laser fire, not missile fire.  Presumably, this implies CT missiles 
are homers.  But it does make sense that M/E would screw up a jump attempt.

HG\'s more geared toward fleet encounters of a military nature, and thus HG 
doesn\'t go into computer reprogramming on the fly.  However, it does give a 
couple of paragraphs on breaking off and pursuit.  One would assume the jump 
is being prepared as the ship breaks off.

I see.  *VERY* interesting...

I\'m not completely happy with it, becuase shouldnt this sort of thing be
covered with the ability of the maintainence crew ? I thought that on
merchant ships, the gunners were usually stewards pulling double duty,
which leave the Engineering crew doing the maintainence work.

Just a theory below...

If your merchie gunner is a Steward pulling double duty, he\'ll be docked
a level of each while doing so. Gunny-Steward isn\'t carrying food trays
or checking cargo manifests during most ship combats, but he might
still be docked that level of Gunnery Skill when a combat comes up - 
because he didn\'t have the time to keep the lasers, fire control and
other doodads up to snuff. The Engineers have their own work to do
down on the drive deck (note that CT Engineering staff requirements
are entirely independent of how many turrets you have), their jobs
(and skill descriptions) don\'t include taking care of the laser cannons.

There is a reason those lucrative mail contracts require your ship to
have a crewman who is a gunner and nothing else, this might be it.

IYTU, what does a designated ship\'s gunner do during the 99% + of the
time the ship isn\'t under attack?

If you feel I insulted you, I apologize.  That *really* wasn\'t my
intention.  Consider it frustration that occasionally gets the better
of me.  This time it was the frustration of weeks of reading
arguments about how many pirates can dance on the head of a 100
diameter pin. ;->

I\'m not going to participate in a flame-fest, and I sincerely hope
no one else lets this turn into one.  However, my opinions on this
subject haven\'t changed.

Yes, I\'m in a distinct minority in my dislike for *strict* and
massive canon.  I might even be a minority of one, but that neither
bothers me nor should it bother you.  When I express my opinion, I\'m
expressing *my* opinion.  It\'s not like "the powers that be" are
hanging on my words.  ;->

You know, I really don\'t object to there *being* published material,
I\'m all for it.  ;-> That it be plausible and internally consistent
only makes sense.  As I said, it\'s when the weight of the material
becomes so heavy, and the details are so finely drawn that I have a
problem.

Tightly woven stories make for fine reading and interesting
discussion, but IMO, they don\'t make for fine roleplaying.  What
happens is that a GM becomes straight-jacketed into accepting the
*whole* story in order to make use a part, and *his* vision, his
creativity becomes subordinated to those of someone else.  You may
not agree, that\'s your prerogative, but hey, that\'s *my* opinion,
don\'t let it upset you.

Now then, you also talk about how much effort it is to fit less
detailed material into your campaign.  That\'s too bad, but you don\'t
seem to realize that the same difficulty arises when *I* try to work
an interesting piece out of a finely woven picture so I can use it
in my campaign.  It can cut both ways, Hans, and your concerns are
no more valid than are mine.  All *I* ask for is that the published
material keep things open and loose enough so as to be useful beyond
a single vision of the Traveller universe.  Isn\'t *that* fair?

As for my rant...well, if you want the bottom line reason it\'s
because your opinion is so dominate among the TML community that I
feel like I have to remind you that we\'re still here.  There *are*
people out here that don\'t agree with you, not just in the details,
but philosophically, and by you I mean each and every one of us...me
included.

What it boils down to is we *all* see things differently.  Some of
us play in a Traveller universe that hasn\'t followed "canon" since
1978, while others followed along with CT, some more...some less,
but never paid a bit of attention to the Rebellion.  Some are stuck
in some version of the Rebellion, while other play in TNE universes
that others of us consider rank heresy.  Some are royally POed that
GURPS Traveller "invalidated" both MT\'s and TNE\'s official
background.  Some of us stick to the rules in one set or another,
but most of us don\'t.  In one way or another, I\'d hazard a guess,
that every one of us is considered to be a heretic by *somebody*
on this list.  ;->

So, if you don\'t agree with me about the detrimental effects of
having massive amounts of "canon", then you disagree.  If you *do*
agree, but draw the line at some point different from me, that\'s
fine too.  IAC, you are perfectly free to ignore me.

Man, I was looking again at the B2 table, and it is a mess. Remember
that when it was written there weren\'t any bigger ships. None. HG
didn\'t exist yet.

Then the Tigress\' 300 fighters will fix them :-) You need a whole
hell of a lot of SDBs to even have a hope of seriously damaging a
Tigress (and by this I mean many hundreds, if not thousands).

I dunno about that. I also don\'t have many ships jumping in at 100D
from their target worlds. Many habitable worlds are within the 100D
limit of their star, so using planetary 100d might be too close (and
too easy to defend). I\'d expect pirates to look for systems that are
even harder to defend. I think that many people neglect the (large,
IMO) amount of in-system traffic that occurs in traveller. 

Capturing small craft isn\'t a bad business if you think about it.
You can throw them in your (large) hold, then Strip them while in
jump space--counterfit a new VIN, then sell them.

> When you\'re at least 108 minutes from detection range at best speed, what\'s so dumb about it?  You\'ve got 108 minutes at least to fade into the woodwork, probably closer to 120 minutes; I\'d do the math, but I\'ve been up for 20 hours & answering all these damned emails for 9, so I\'ll pass on it & leave it as an exercise for teh Students.  <grin>
 
A few things. 108 minutes was from the time of boarding, right? More
realistic would be 108 minutes from the time the target knows you
are a pirate (say your first shot at him). You have to disable
(totally kill the Mdrive) him, then board (killing all his weapons
would also be a good idea, and how do you know til you get very
close?). Then you have to either fix the Mdrive/Jdrive/whatever
needs fixing, or just loot the cargo. If you want to "do the math"
I\'d suggest starting at first shot, even if you are using HG. 

The first attack (say 3 factor 4 pulse laser turrets) would probably
result in 2 hits. That\'s 4 critical hits (I\'m assuming a range of
between 50-500kkm (I\'m using MT since I can\'t find my !$^&%$&$ copy
of HG). You will likely kill his maneuver and weapons, if you don\'t
blow him up. To be more safe (the target is valuable to you) you
might fire reduced factor attacks so you don\'t get criticals, but it
would take a few turns to disable him (at 20 minutes a turn). So
best case, 1 turn to disable him, 1 to match courses. That leaves
about an hour til the SDBs arrive. Using this attack you are likely
just taking some cargo and leaving since the PP and/or Jdrive is out
from all those critical hits. Using the lowered factor attacks it\'d
get you 6 attacks at factor 2--about 3 hits, probably 3-4 turns to
disarm and disable, 1 to board. That\'s 80-100 minutes. The SDB will
be shooting missiles by now I imagine.

You\'re moving straight at them. The are NOT moving on the sky (not
very much, anyway). In 3 space, yeah, but your distance is all that
is really changing much, and lasers are bore-sighted, so it doesn\'t
matter.

Unless pirates usually kill their targets\' crew. Then they are dead
anyway as soon as the two ships are attached, that was my point.
Otherwise they close until they can resolve the target.

It\'s a rules system thing.

In FFS and FFS2, lasers go out to virtually forever.

You could shoot back at the Telstar, but it\'s armour was pretty thick, on
the grounds it didnt run too well. Unless you were in a cruiser to start
with, you\'d probably come second.

The big limitation with lasers is they have an energy output limit -
basically, you cant punch the hull of a well-built ship with a laser. For
that, you need a nuke, a Particle Accelerator or a Meson Gun.

Incidentally, it isnt that hard, under FFS2, to build a PAW that will fire
out past 100 diameters. But I consider that an unsporting argument to use,
becuase it is too rules-system dependant.

[snip snip gobble munch burp]

It occurs to me that humans would be the only source of meat on Vland that
could be consumed *without* processing by a Shugili. Any other kind of food
has to be taken to the Shugili before you can eat it, and he of course
takes a cut. But if you\'re really hungry and there\'s no processed food
left, or you\'re in big trouble with the Shugili and you have to avoid him,
or you can\'t afford meat and you\'re having a Big Mac Attack, *and* you have
no morals at all, there\'s always the temptation to knock off your old Uncle
Eneri and making Eneriburgers...

Therefore, dead people would be consumed not by Shugili, but by
"untouchables," outcasts, or other desperate scum who can\'t make use of a
Shugili\'s services (someone being punished for breaking with some important
tradition, say). Or perhaps cannibalism would be a final recourse in dire
circumstances, such as the death of the local Shugilii in a natural
disaster. (Incidentally, it also occurs to me that early military conflicts
on Vland would focus on attempts to capture or kill the enemy\'s Shugilii --
without them, the enemy is helpless.)

So I think there *is* a real reason for Vilani to engage in cannibalism
more often than Terrans. But, rather than being a secret rite of the
Shugili caste, I think it more likely to be a last recourse in very lean
times, and also a highly illegal, subversive act, a direct attack on the
Shugili\'s power structure. To eat humans is to sidestep the authority of
the Shugili.

Alternatively (because Derroch\'s enthusiam for Vilannibalism is so
contagious), perhaps among certain Vilani cultures, ritual cannibalism
might evolve to counteract the subversive threat of unregulated
cannibalism. By socializing it as a solemn rite honoring the recently
deceased, the authorities might keep it under their control - just like
every other kind of food on the planet.

Best,

  I have some questions about the following assumptions:

>6.  Per LBB2, \'extreme range\' is 500,000 klicks and \'long\' range is 250,000 
>klicks.

  Isn\'t maximum range for a detected target 900,000 km, per B:2 p. 32? Fire
to 250 Kkm is +0, to 500 Kkm -2, and beyond that (to ?) is -5 per p. 30. OC,
the alternate hit DM\'s from HG can replace those mods, although B:5 doesn\'t
have any determinate range values listed.

>8.  Defender starts in orbit around the planet.  Defender is also assumed to 
>be rounding the planet and pointing at the intruder, thus rendering the orbit 
>height and planet\'s radius irrelevant.

  Since a warship can detect a silent running ship at 1 LS (p. 32) why
not have warships park at that orbital distance? Or a further such increment
out to allow overlap with the ranges of orbital facilities/craft?

>9.  All attacks are at the USP value of the battery firing, *not* the USP

  Irrelevant now, OC.

  The model appears to be heavily based on the rather odd assumption that
any security vessels will be down in as low an orbit as they can start
(in addition to the clarification of B:2 ranges). How would this model
function with the ships placed more appropriately at 300,000 and ~500,000 km
distances from the planet, and with the ranges from B:2 p.32 in effect?

Eris\' statements of why he\'s anti-canon are just the tip of the iceberg...
from his posts over the last couple fo years, I figure few of us would
recognize much of Eris\' game as traveller... a lot of house rules, etc.
He\'s tweaked the rules, the settings (wait, no thrown that out), and the
approaches of the game. He\'s rejected even some of the fundamental
assumptions of the game: he uses stutterwarp!

Hooray for Eris? yes and no. He\'s got (or made) the time to do a nearly
totally custom universe and severely tweak a set of rules.

<biting sarcasm>
	Much further, and he may as well not call it traveller anymore,
	find a cooperative publisher, and produce something more his
	liking....
</biting sarcasm>

HOWEVER, don\'t miss the point: While people like Eris can (and will) throw
out canon, many of us cannot due to lack of (choose from Imagination, Time,
Willpower, Understanding of Macroecon, understanding of sociodynamics,
understanding of physics).

To be useful to PLAYERS, canon must be consistant, and understandable, but
not fully revealed. This way a player can move from one group to another
without fear of having to restart the learning curve.

To be useful to GM\'s, canon must provide enough material to work from, but
not so much as to prevent adventuring oportunities nor prevent some
customization.

The complaints about Traveller canon is that is is NOT self consistant...
several bits contradict several other bits. In traveller, this seems to be
unintentional. (In Glorantha, it is intentional as it might be in WoD,
which is why I won\'t buy first-hand those products.)

More profound about traveller canon is that there are 5 different editions,
each with different starting asumptions. But, unlike GW-UK, Neither FFE nor
GDW ever said "New and Completely Revised" with regaurd to the
background... they just kept adding. (JFR, GW-UK basically approches
universe canon with the mindset of Canon starts over every edition....) So,
unless contradicted, canon must stand from CT on... Also, the tendancy (on
list, at least) is to take oldest canon is best canon (I do this too...),
and try to retrofit new canon to agree with old. I fear this may not be
possible, as new canon might be better thought out than old in many CT vs
everything esle cases (Adv 1-4).

Only mark can declare something non-canon, and he\'s probably not got the
time. So, people must allow for differences WITHOUT THE PERSONALITY
ASSASSINATION which has been creeping up lately. (No names to be issued.)

In short, I am asking for self-censorship on the grounds of "If you feel
personally insulted, don\'t respond at that level."

Try looking at it the other way, what\'s the _problem_ with
publishing books detailing a setting that are not self-consistent ?

The only problem I can see is that a few anal retentives will get
annoyed.

The entire comic book industry is based on settings and even
characters
that are not  internally consistent, and they survive fine, and
still give people
enjoyment.

I\'ve been tinkering with the High Guard Mechanics recently, and was
wondering if anyone knows the following which would be useful:

a) How many MW does an EP correlate to?

b) What is the average mass (tons) of a starship per displacement ton? I
need a crude figure so I can tinker with the MT Hard Times Figures. Would
non-Starships differ?

c) Is the TL9 Fusion rocket in Hard Times (p84) equivalent to HePLAR?

d) If that is the case (or if not) would it be a fair assumption that the
fuel consumption would drop in line with the drop in fusion power plant
fuel demands with TL rise described in MT?

I\'m using MT references (not FFS2 at the moment) as I believe the two
design sequences are closer. Is this a fair assumption?

e) Would a fair assumption be that you could calculate the typical surface
area of a ship in different configurations and then have slightly differing
hard point restrictions?

  Well, it does get rarer, until you add the bases :)

  A more detailed chart would be a nice thing for a supplement - say a
chart for various traffic levels, and some general notes on what system
types would qualify (all Hi-Pop or Naval use high effective security
traffic charts; X ports use "very low" chart); a customized set of three
or four smallish charts (identified as examples/ideas) in a book like
RSB or BTC might be a useful feature?

You assign the Approved Precipitation Points well ahead of time, and have
them published in the Commercial Shipping News, which is available at your
trading partners.

Something like \'Traffic leaving from Ruie should use point Alpha from day
114-119, then use point Beta from day 120-128. Points will be patrolled for
48 hours before and after the Jump Window\'.

Points would presumably be related to the optimum vectors given planetary
and system movement etc etc.

Use of these points may or may not be mandatory, but if I didnt want to get
mugged by a pirate, then I\'d certainly use them.

One reason I think Stewards pull double duty as gunners is that Gunnery
skill is a professional skill for the Purser\'s department in LBB 7. The
point about pulling double duty is well made, although I personally wouldnt
dock the skill level from the main job ... you could put the dedicated
Gunner in a Tux (maybe his old Navy uniform) to serve drinks during a big
social event, and it\'s only 3-5 hours. The Steward sitting in his
crewstation during precipitation is the equivalent - it may be the only
time he actually sits there each trip.

Makes sense to me. The other thing is the \'real\' gunner could handle the
point-defense lasers, while the Stewards, the medic and the Assistant Drive
Hand handle the sandcasters.

Trains the Stewards in gunnery techniques, and possibly does trick shooting
to impress the passengers ...

One line I was going to introduce was the idea of a sneaky pirate with a
mil-spec colour changing hull that did asteroid impressions in
badly-charted systems - radiating IR, coloured himself brown with a darker
spot that moved around the hull to imitate spin, etc etc.

An archetypical annoying eleven year old, nags and nags and nags his
parents, the crew, the cleaning staff and so on to try out the ship\'s guns.

Eventually, they agree, and let him take a pot shot at that rock over there

This is a point of debate, as to whether or not pirates will treat their

Steve, my copy of HG is long gone. Can you build me some cheap SDBs capable
of playing with a type P ? I can do em under FFS2 (the infanous Four Fours
Famile Spofulam SDB), but this debate appears to be in the paleolithic
^k^k^k^k^k^k focussed on CT.

If I had one ship, I\'d have it in close orbit when it wasnt escorting the
outbound convoy. If I had more of them, then I\'d be running deep orbits.

As spokesman for the Laser Communications Division of the
Postmark Design Bureau ("When your message must get through"),
I feel that I must interject here: The Telstar XII was in no way
a wepaons system - it is a peaceful device capable of focusing out
to 1 million km and sending messages even through severe interferrence
(eg 10cm of superdense and a couple of interior bulkheads).

Grav focused lasers can easily achieve spot sizes of 1cm at these
distances with a 10m mirror. Following a tip from someone of the list
about using batteries, the Telstar XIIb was even affordable.
The main problem is 600MJ lasers at ROF800 and 20% efficiency -
you just cannot dissipate the heat.

At TL13 you can use optically focused X-ray lasers that indicate
the the Telstar XIII would be similar in cost to a 1998 real
world telecommunication satellite. Especially if you considered it a
remote controlled turret with power and sensors and put the crew in
a space station or on the ground.

The Emerging Products Division of the Postmark Design Bureau
("Microwaving half baked ideas from acorss the galaxy") has done a
design study that indicates that grav focused x-ray lasers could ranges
of over 1 billion km - so they could be in Stellar orbit and protect
the Gas Giants (apart from minor problems of targetting and light lag).

The laser device assumes that you are not facing proper warships
(on these it could carve its name but little else). You could
use a particle accelerator but then the cost goes up and unless
your satellite has 3G, it would be a sitting duck when the enemy
shoots back.

I don\'t see the problem here unless you want Marc or Loren to publish it as
part of the OTU. It will fit perfectly into your own TU, because you wrote it,
so you have no trouble using it yourself. You can still get it published if
it is good, it will just have to be marked as a variant (Examples of this
are the Dynchia and IRIS). It\'s true that you won\'t be able to use the
official version should you ever get hold of the 20 year old book or should
it be republished, but you wouldn\'t be able to use a newly published book
about that subsector that didn\'t agree with the 20 year old book either, so
what\'s the difference?

It\'s one thing if the new product is written by someone who knows the old
stuff and deliberately change some things in order to make the OTU more
consistent, it\'s quite another if it is inconsistent because the writer
didn\'t know about it (unfortunate, but excusable if it was a small, obscure
product, inexcusable if it was one of the major products) or didn\'t care
(totally inexcusable).

As I said before, I don\'t expect miracles. If the author didn\'t know because
he had very little chance of finding out, it is unfortunate, but excusable.
If he didn\'t know because he didn\'t bother to find out, that\'s another thing
entirely.

Wnen two canonical statements contradict each other or when a canonical bit

stifled.

[*] I don\'t mind unlikely and I can usually handle very unlikely, but I draw
    the line at very, very unlikely ;-)

OTOH, the possibilities of getting help has increased enourmously. Post a

Here you\'re pressing quite a different button of mine. IMO the Traveller
Universe is not the Real Universe and dose not have to correspond 100%
to the Real Universe. I think it is a mistake to try to shoehorn the events
of the last 20 years developement in the Real World into the TU. Fix a date
(say, 1979) as the time the TU and the Real World started to part company
in earnest and don\'t try to update the TU to fit new RW inventions unless
the fit without much effort.

I see soc as being one of the factors in the behind the scenes causes of
piracy IMTU.

The following is from an aquintance who is pretty much an expert on 18th
century piracy.

If letters of marque were issued during the 4th or 5th FF, then there
may be an associated rise in piracy following each of these wars, due to
out of work privateers turning pirate.

With no established background, there is no direct canon. Indirectly, the
writer is obligated to look at the implications of an addition (which is
actually much harder), but this always applies.

Hm, Roger is sitting on the DGP stuff, but Marc has been remarkably
generous in giving permission for people to xerox out-of-print material
for other fans. Given that the list membership collectively has multiple
copies of everything ever published, I\'d say everything _is_ available.

On the other hand, who wants to have a campaign of 20 years overturned
because a writer decided to change everything? Especially as there\'s so

In your Traveller universe, sure. My personal universe doesn\'t follow
Traveller canon either. But when I write for publication I stick to canon,
so that other referees can use my material without change.

Look at Eris\' universe. A neat place, and possibly more creative than most
opf the published material, but it would take a lot of alteration for most
of us to use a supplement he produced if it was set there. We could mine
the ideas, but we would have to do a lot of fiddly work wrt the details.

Canon is, IMHO, a way of attempting to ensure consistency, SO THAT PEOPLE
CAN USE PUBLISHED MATERIAL WITH MINIMAL CHANGES. I can use stutterwarp in
my universe, but I know I will have to change all references to jump
drive. If I start publishing adventures with stutterwarp, you will have to
change all those references back to jump drive. If I chance anything I
like _without_ telling you, you have to carefully read everything I wrote
for consistency, making changes as necessary, while if my work followed
canon you would know in advance what needed changing to fit your universe.

Now, an easy way around this is for the writer to explicitly identify any
varient rules/background used.

Leaving aside the fact that some people scream and moan about anything?

Remember that you are free to do anything you like in your own game, as
are we all. However, every change to a common background means more work
for everyone using that background, so you should see why some people are
complaining.

3) No one is required to use canon.

4) Existing canon has contradictions. 

5) This is not a reason for introducing more contradictions.

That said, if everyone just states which parts of canon their material
changes, the rest of us will know _in advance_ what we might want to

For example, Doug comes up with a really neat adventure involving the
quest for a stutterwarp drive. Official canon doesn\'t include stutterwarp,
so anyone who didn\'t like the idea would know that they had to change the
drive.

For example, I wrote an adventure set on Macene, except my Macene was
orbiting a red giant. This is not canon, because that star is different in
the published Spinward Marches material. If my adventure ever gets
published, I would hope that the publisher puts a large VARIANT note at
eth beginning, explaining the difference. Soemone who had already set an
adventure on the \'official\' Macene would know that they had to either move
my system or change their game history.

Hmmm, I\'d go for the criticals - most of the time a few criticals will
disable your target quickly and they are at your mercy. Occasionally a
lucky shot destroys them.

Then you turn to your gunner, get out your Klingon phrase book, say
"I said target their engines!" and shoot them when they reply "lucky shot?"

Now, that, OTOH, while not insulting, is something I don\'t care much for.
If you think Gary, Steven, Walt, Keven, I et alii have been arguing about
something inexpressibly silly, then that\'s your prerogative. But please
have the courtesy to realize that none of us agree with you (if we did,
would we be spending our precious time arguing about it?). If you want to
spend your time convincing us that we are being silly, go ahead. But don\'t
berate us because you are tired of reading something we\'re not yet tried
arguing about. I routinely skip about 75% of each digest. Some of it
because I\'m not interested at all, more because although I\'m interested,
I\'m not interested enough. I suggest you do the same instead of reading
something you consider silly.

It seems to me that you\'re concerned about something that we not really
addressing at the moment. You appear to think that I want a canonical
universe defined right down to the finest details. That\'s not so. On the
contrary, what I want is a self-consistent framework with lots of room
in between to individualize. All I want is for that framework to be the
same all across the canon. I do admit that I want any detail that does
get fixed to stay fixed, but IMO it simply isn\'t possible to generate
details enough to "fill out" an entire universe  --  or even such a small
slice of a universe as Charted Space.

>Now then, you also talk about how much effort it is to fit less detailed
>material into your campaign. 

You misunderstood me, then. My problem isn\'t with "less detailed material"
it is with "material that contradicts facts that I have already established
IMTU".

>That\'s too bad, but you don\'t seem to realize that the same difficulty
>arises when *I* try to work an interesting piece out of a finely woven

As I said, I think you are blaming me for an attitude I don\'t have. But
perhaps I am mistaken. Could you elaborate at bit. Just what is it about
my attitude that would cause you trouble if they were implemented?

>It can cut both ways, Hans, and your concerns are no more valid than are
>mine.

No, but no less valid either, and I don\'t think you can blame me for
promoting my concerns instead of yours. I kind of expect you to do that.

>All *I* ask for is that the published material keep things open and loose
>enough so as to be useful beyond a single vision of the Traveller universe.
>Isn\'t *that* fair?

Yes of course, so long as being useful to you isn\'t mutually exclusive with
being useful to me. Trouble is, it seems to me that it is. But perhaps I am
mistaken. Could you give a few examples of things I promote that makes things
bad for you and explain why?

Eris, to my knowledge I\'ve never become exasperated with someone because
they disagreed with me philosophically, but only with fuzzy logic (The
third time I see an argument I (believe that I) have answered twice already,
I do tend to get testy, I admit). But I may of course be deluding myself,
and if anyone can show me otherwise, I\'ll be ready to apologize and try to
mend my ways.

Joseph and William have already raised my last point very eloquently. I
don\'t understand why you have a problem with a more self-consistent OTU.
Could you try to explain?

So am I using a wrong word here? If so, were you unable to understand my

the word I used? I genuinely want to know.

That is your opinion. I do not agree with you. With the amount of help it
is possible to get on the Internet nowadays, that excuse don\'t work anymore.
With the exception of really obscure sources, but I\'ve already stated that
several times.

And you are still not getting my point. A discrepancy may be condonable, but
it is still a discrepancy. Someone does have that 15 year old book and
unless the discrepancy is corrected, he will happily base HIS next book
on that information while another author will base his on the newer stuff.
That is IMO a Bad Thing. The Entropic/Cunnonic worlds discrepancy is an
example of this. So far it has led to the Cunnonic worlds getting into
GURPS:Traveller while the world writeups in GURPS:Behind the Claw are
based on the Entropic worlds version.

That seems to me to be an even more than usually good reason to get those
pieces excised from the canon.

Well, Thom, that is a fault, I confess. But as long as it is confined to
instances where I have already answered the same argument twice or more, I
think I can be excused. If you can provide me with instances where I\'ve
started out with that kind of talk, please do and I\'ll apologize.

Yes, Thom, that\'s what you and some other people have been telling me (not
everyone as you claim). But what you should have told me was that YOU don\'t
think it matters. That\'s your prerogative. But you have absolutely no right
to tell me that I am wrong to think it matters. And, for that matter, you

As you even say yourself, it does detract from my fun. Are you saying that
my fun is less important, on some objective scale, than your fun? (Of course
subjectively it is less important to you, just as yours subjectively is less
important to me).

I\'d be happy if Marc and Loren were to address these points. I don\'t blame
them for not doing so, having a perfect understanding of how Real Life tend
to interfere with ideal solutions, but that dosen\'t mean that I wouldn\'t
like them to. If they want to, I\'d be happy to help them. If they don\'t

something about, that\'s their business. That dosen\'t change how _I_ feel
about it. Maybe they never will agree with me. I can live with that and I\'d
still buy them a beer if they ever visited Copenhagen. But I do know that
if I don\'t post about these things, they won\'t even get a chance to agree
or disagree.

No screaming there.  This also brings up an important point...most merchant

Late-period CT sensor rules.  In addition, once detected a ship may be
tracked out to three light-seconds; the size-8 100-diameter limit is at
four and a quarter light-seconds.   

The loophole here is that CT military sensors are considered free with
military designs.  You could extend sensor coverage by buying a couple
of squadrons of cheap 10-ton _Iramda_ fighters and flying a rotating
patrol out at the three light-second line.  You can buy quite a few of
these sensor platforms for the same cost as one 400-ton SDB.  They can
then vector in heavier ships of the planetary navy on pirates, or onto
an invading enemy fleet.

In addition, the pirate would have a chance to pick and choose targets 
based on what they\'re loading in port, and could get a good idea of the
ship\'s departure time, armament, and course.  The pirate could also try
to suborn crew, or slip hijackers or saboteurs aboard as passengers.

I don\'t see why it requires an escort. Just post an anti-piracy SDB so that
it\'s 500 kkm sphere encompasses the designated jump point (between the
world and the jump point, say). Move it with the jump point. That way, the
pirate has to hit the target before it gets to within about 1,000 kkm of
the jump point on it\'s way through SDB\'s sphere of protection (assuming the
sphere is 500 kkm radius -- half that if it is a diameter, of course).

Like so:

Whew, I thought the boarding party leaders deserved high pay on the

stateroom on that Fat Trader, he\'s got a dangerous job ahead of him.
Easier if all the passengers are pirate agents, of course, but not a
heck of a lot easier. The only advantage the agents might have is
surprise, and then only against a naive crew or one that\'s gotten lax.
The crew has lots of advantages that they\'ll wipe out  the pirate agents 
with if the agents don\'t act swiftly.

IMTU Hijacking is difficult, requiring a pretty rare mix of skills (to take the
ship reasonably intact) and contacts (to safely sell the ship). If the only 
object of the agents aboard is to disable the ship\'s drives, sensors and/or 
commo at the right moment, that\'s a bit different. 

Explosives can be substituted for computer/electronics skill, for
example. Sufficient contacts to safely dispose of a hot starship
may not be needed. 

I\'ll leave coordination between pirate agents on the planet and 
the Corsair lurking somewhere in-system to intrepid criminal
masterminds among us. <G>

I understand all that.  As GMG suggests below, I\'m not thinking of
wholesale systemic cannibalism, but more of an emergency measure.
So, not all the dead would be consumed, just when there was an
especially pressing need.

Hmm.  I think that makes sense most of the time, but I would have
the Shugili\'s practicing cannibalism in extreme emergencies, when
local produce is unavailable, etc.  So then, IMTU, the dark secret
of the Shugili would be that even they had to resort to the practice
of cannibalism.

Thing is, I\'ve been on the net for *years*.  I only found out about the TML 
list about a year & a half ago.  I didn\'t even think to do a web search on 
Traveller because I haddn\'t seen any Traveller stuff around at all at my FLGS 
for a couple of years before GDW went out.  Thus, I figgered Traveller was a 
Lost Religion.  Why chase old dreams.

Point I\'m making is, the netizens of a Traveller-oriented mailing list are 
going to be a small percentage of the people who bought Traveller to begin 
with.  Sure, we\'ve got permission to clone limited numbers of copies of the 
GDW stuff, but what percentage of the old Traveller market is going to *need* 
these?  I don\'t see it as a problem for Marc cause he\'s not really losing a 
*LOT* of money.  If *everybody* that ever did Traveller was on the net and in 
these groups, I\'d expect the \'go ahead and clone them\' policy to stop.

Hell, I was one of the Lucky Hundred that has a copy of Letters of Marque, and 
I *ONLY* heard about it *here*!

I tend to stick to canon as much as possible as far as \'look & feel\' issues 
go.  However, if something makes sense to change, I change it IMTU.  I jsut 
don\'t go around demanding that everybody *else* change too.

Somebody said Eris uses stutterwarp.  I\'m *in* his PBEM & haven\'t seen it yet. 
 I *do* know the basic ruleset he uses is TNE  with some house rules.  How 
things \'work\' there is beyond my comprehension.  It\'s a custom setting as far 
as location and milieu go, set a LOOOOONG time downstream from the legendary 
days of \'Once there was this place called the Third Imperium\'.  Personally, I 
*like* it.  My PBEM is set in Reavers\' Deep, outside of the 3I, in the year 
1125.  Yeah, the Rebellion is going on.  My base ruleset is CT.  And I kinda 
like that milieu, too, or else I\'d base & place my PBEM someplace else.

There\'s some things I use IMTU that I don\'t talk about here since they\'re not 
canonical.  For instance, my star charts & UWPs for the Deep as a whole aren\'t 
canonical simply due to the fact that I didn\'t have canonical info to base 
them on outside of Drexilthar Subsector.  I used what I could find, and worked 
from there.  Also, I factor in the \'solar jump limit\' (100 solar diameters) in 
my game.  This means the main world of a system *MAY* be inside the solar jump 
limit, in which case, incoming ships will have a cruise to get to the main 
world.  The way Jump drives work IMTU, they exit at the 100 diameter \'curb\'.  
*Entering* jumpspace is another story; if you want to chance entering before 
reaching the curb, go for it, but don\'t say I didn\'t warn you that it\'s risky. 
 If asked to supply portions of my PBEM for publication, I would naturally 
remove any non-canon material not necessary to the story arc.  This means, I 
wouldn\'t talk about a solar jump limit.

Because, in order to make a playable, manageable game, you *have* to
(artificially) restrict the differences between the 57th century and
today.  As many others have commented, almost all the plot drivers in
Traveller arise from an economy of scarcity; people fight or bargain or
steal to obtain resources which are valuable because they are in limited
supply.  Interstellar trade happens because many products are expensive to
synthesize locally.  Introduce nanotech, or large-scale transmutation of
elements, or similar technologies, and the entire explanation for
Traveller history and adventures as written goes out the window.

Similarly, allow real AI and you get a world more like Ian Banks\' than
like Traveller-as-we-know-it -- the big AIs really call the shots, with
living sophonts mostly as pawns.

Such universes do offer rich opportunities for role-playing, but these
opportunities have little resemblance to Traveller-as-we-know-it.  And, if
you introduce \'limited\' nanotech or AI (or other canon-breaking tech), you
are left in just as bad a position explaining why they are limited as
ordinary canon faces explaining their absence. 

> Anytime anyone tries to tailor the Traveller universe in any significant
> way he\'s met with a wall of hostility. 

Not hostility so much as conservatism in its original sense.  We are
reluctant to make large changes in Traveller canon for fear of breaking
its (already fragile) internal consistency.  For each new tech you add,
you have to review the *entirety of Traveller pseudo-history* to make sure
that the new tech wouldn\'t result in a massively different outcome.  Tech,
in large measure, *defines* history by determining what can and cannot be
done at any given moment.

> _at_ least as well people still scream and moan about it. 

I have yet to see a canon-breaking tech proposal which is well enough
thought out to be incorporated into \'canon\' Traveller without fatal damage
to Traveller\'s stated history, sociology, and economics.

> Do we want a consistent well thought out science-fiction universe, or do we
> really want the 17th/18th century in space?

We want a blend of the two.  The \'future\' we create must be recognizeable
enough that players have some sense of what is possible, what their powers
are, and what is expected of them.  This alone constrains our created
\'future\' to be far closer to 20th century reality (or reality in a recent,
well-known century, for that matter) than is likely to be the case in the
real world, milennia from now.

If I want to use the setting without having to do a lot of work to make it
self-consistent, then this is a problem.

If my players want to play in a setting that is self-consistent, this is a
problem.

I am operating under the assumption that it is easier to ignore pieces of a
setting than it is to create, from scratch, pieces of a setting on your
own. It is easier for me, at any rate -- YMMV. I don\'t see any reason why
published material should be inconsistent, or lack continuity.

I simply don\'t understand the "straightjacketing creativity" argument. If I
buy into a setting, I would like it to be complete and consistent. If I see
something I don\'t like, I can ignore it or change it, if I am willing to do
the work. But if I buy into a setting that is inherently incomplete and/or
inconsistent, then I am forced to make up stuff that is not covered or to
account for the inconsistency, whether I want to or not.

YMMV, of course, but I purchase products for substance, not ideas. IMO,
ideas are cheap -- it\'s much more difficult to do something with them.

I\'d expect them to beef up patrols along the border, to at least a depth of 10 
parsecs or so, just to handle some of those nasty criminal Impies coming in to 
hoodwink good honest Zhodani merchants from their hardearned money.

I see the frontier areas of the Imperium to get pretty wild & wooly.  But you\'re right, during pre-Rebellion times, the Core Worlds would be pretty boring unless you were a bean counter out to vist strange new worlds, meet exotic natives, and take them for everything they\'ve got.

Methinks this is to make sure that somebody onboard the ship actually *DOES* 
know how to shoot the bloody thing.  Otherwise, the owner could just grab some 
kid off the street and say, "Yeah, here\'s my gunner, yeah, that\'s the ticket!"

Depends on what he\'s interested in.  During Jump, probably run lots and lots of simulations & drills to keep himself sharp.  Catch up on his technical journals.  Make sure the turret is working right and the guns themselves are ready to rock and roll.  Play a lotta cards in the passenger lounge.  Drink heavily.

Not true.  CT says military-grade sensors can pick up a drive at full function 
at 2 light secs, civilian sensors at half a lightsec.

Canonically speaking, the ships wouldn\'t come in at the solar jump point, but 
IMTU, I use the concept of a solar jump point, too.  <grin>  Makes things 
interesting.  Under CT, in-system traffic was pretty much ignored because most 
people were interested in the main world.  I just don\'t see in-system traffic 
as being as lucrative as main world traffic.  But then, I never did the math 
on it, either.

It\'s chicken stealing.  After awhile, those little boats start arming up and

108 minutes is how long it takes a ship to go 640K klicks at 6G.  We\'re 
assuming the ship is decellerating to get and stay in range.  A warship in 
orbit around a Size 8 world is 1.28 million klicks away from the 100 diameter 
curb.  Assume a low orbit, and I\'m spotting you 40K klicks range at turnover.

Still, I\'d like to see your sensors resolve and discriminate between two 30

Uhm, methinks the SDB crew\'s orders would be *save the victims*.  if the pirates kill them, that\'s one thing.  If the SDB crew kills them, that\'s a *WHOLE* \'nuther matter.

That the one that says space piracy is impossible and ridiculous on top of it? 
 In that case, no, I\'m not.  This does *NOT* mean I think there will be

I don\'t see a planet-bound PAW as being particularly effective at the 100 diameter curb.  The target is 4.25 light-seconds away.  You\'re going to be correcting for where the target was 8.5 seconds ago.  What difficulty rating would you give this task?

	I have noticed how the piracy flame-fest has started to re-ignite, so I will
offer an alternative topic in the hopes of heading off the fire (although it

	My question for consideration is this:  just what are the procedures and
protocols for nuclear weapons release w/in the Imperium?  Are nuke warheads
really left in the hands of some brand-new Lt(jg) commanding his first DE??
Who makes the decision to use nuclear warheads? What are the conditions
required to get a nuclear release option?
	A similar question might also be the use of kenetic-energy strikes on
planets.  Granted these are not nuclear weapons...but the short-term effects
are almost identical (even fallout can be reduced or eliminated by a high
enough airburst) and they seem to share many long-term effects as well (dust
in the atmosphere, etc.).
	And another thing to consider:  the effects of a nuclear detonation in space;
how will this effect sensors, starship controls etc (EMP).  Is there an effect
such as white-out, and what might that do to the detection solution as
discussed in the piracy debate?
	I am looking for any opinions or methods you have or use in your universes.

Maximum tracking range, once you find him in the first place, is 900K klicks.  
Outside that, you lose him.  Maximum detection range is 600K klicks for 
military sensors, 150K for civilian.

There\'s a base 50% chance Defender is on the same side of the planet as the Intruder.  Average distance modification in this case would be 1/2 the distance to orbit, you pick the orbit.  50% of the time, the distance modification would be, *add* 1/2 the orbital distance to the start point of Defender.  Thus, I took the median case and postulated Defender starts in orbit, along the baseline drawn through the planet\'s core, perpendicular to the line drawn from Intruder to the planet\'s core.  Statistically speaking, that\'s where Defender would most likely be.  I didn\'t bother documenting every case.

But still, even at Closest Approach of +500K klicks to the curb, you\'re still 780K clicks out, 120K klicks short of sensor range for a military ship.  At Furthest Aproach, Defender starts at 1.780K klicks, and besides, there\'s this pesky 8000 mile diameter planet in the way.

Now you know why I used the 1280K klick midpoint figure.

 I\'d assumed that the Intruder would hear the scream and know they\'re under
time pressure.  For the purposes of my figures, whether they detected the
scream or not is immaterial.

	 I would think that if you tight-beamed the target vessel and said "don\'t
even try to call for help or I\'ll blow you away", then most merchants would
just give over the cargo and not risk it...esp since the pirate would have
enough time to destroy the merchant if they violated the order.  And remember,
every turn that the SDB doesn\'t know whats going on (or spends trying to
figure it out) is another turn for the pirate to work.  It seems to me
everybody assumes that SDB crews are on a constant state of General Quarters,
and are thus instantly ready for immediate decisive action (this comes, no
doubt, from AD&D, where PC\'s routinely sleep in full plate armor, even after
having ridden in it all day! <G>).  Crews get complacent and sloppy, esp. in a
system where nothing much ever happens.

Which is why taking *outbound* prizes makes more sense than taking inbound ones.

 According to the description of commo packages in T4\'s QSDS (T4, pg 94),
 the basic, improved, and enhanced packages all carry some sort of
 1000AU-range tight-beam commo.  Earlier (and/or later) versions may
 vary.
  >>

	Thank you for reminding me of this...I use the HG/MT system, which made you
buy individual commo systems.  The basic sensor package from T4 doesn\'t have a
laser comm, the standard civilian package (standard for merchant vessels) has
only a 30000km maser comm...not much help if the SDB is on the far side of the
patrol area.

They\'re 400 ton boats designed for interdiction and customs duties.  The J5 
just lets them get around easier.  Can you say \'Colonial Fleet\'?

At 350ish MCr per, they\'re under half the cost of the Dragon.  And they\'re Jump-capable.  Like I say, an appropriate boat to run across in a backwater.

100-D limit.  Now, correct me if I am wrong about the following statements:

	1)  A starship can make a risky jump at 10-D, with a large chance of a
misjump.
	2)  A starship can make a safe jump at 100-D, with no effect on the
possiblilty of misjump (except for maintenance, etc.)
	3) NOWHERE in the rules does it say a ship MUST come out of jump only at the
100-D limit!!!

	Jumping as soon as you can safely makes perfect sense for merchants...after
all, time is money.  But who says you have to come out of jump at the 100-D
limit?  What if you don\'t intend to stay?  What if you are meeting a vessel?
Refueling and moving on?  One you head toward the mainworld, you get into the
main traffic pattern...how many of us have spent time in an airplane waiting
to land because either theirs too much traffic or the ATC comps are down

	IMTU, where you come out of jump (or go into it for that matter) is mainly

Counter-battery fire from the target\'s lasers.  Of course, this means they 
don\'t get to use them to fire for effect until the next turn...

	Since I make Gunnery skill a part of the combat equation, I tend to make a

Probably the local senior officer can give nuclear weapons release -- given
communications latency, if you aren\'t willing to give your captains authority
to fire nuclear weapons, just don\'t give them nuclear weapons.  There\'s
probably regulations on when they can be used, and lots of paperwork later if
you use them.

Weapons of mass-destruction against planets are generally banned.

I doubt EMP is a problem -- don\'t think its even a factor in full vacuum.  In
any case, you need to harden starships against enough radiation of various
kinds that EMP probably isn\'t that big of an issue.  However, they\'ll nicely
muck with starship sensors -- a nuclear weapon itself will be detected more or
less automatically by ships in the same system as the weapon, but it will
probably dazzle sensors looking near the weapon.  It doesn\'t have any real
relevance to the piracy debate (blinding someone with a nuclear weapon is
hardly stealth), though as an issue of general military tactics it\'s
interesting.

Lighten up, Hans.  You could discuss piracy in space until you\'re an
old man and never resolve the issue to everyone\'s complete
satisfaction. The same can be said for many other subjects, especially
ones that touch on the "c" word. Whether something is silly,
interesting or boring I\'m happy to leave to each reader.

Just expressed my opinion in favor of less "official" detail. Didn\'t
expect it to be popular. Do you think I should agree with all your
opinions? I certainly don\'t expect you to agree with all of mine.

Probably, but that would just extend a debate that doesn\'t need to be
taking place.  I mean were\'s the profit from that? You believe A, I
believe B, others believe C, and it\'s all still Traveller...IMO, and
there are people here that disagree even with that! ;->

IMHO (the question hasn\'t come up yet in our current Traveller
campaign):

1.  The procedures for nuclear release would vary, depending on the type
of nuke in question.  Release for det-laser nukes would likely be more
easily obtained than release for impact nukes in space, because of the
reduced chance of radioactive contamination of the target.  Nuclear
release for planetary bombardment likely would require sector ducal
permission (or even higher).

2.  Similarly, det-laser nukes would likely be routinely found on ships
down to the DD level (e.g., the MIDU AGASHAAM class ships).  Impact
nukes (either anti-ship or planetary bombardment) probably are found
routinely only on ships of cruiser size and larger.  (Of course, mission
requirements may change this in either direction.)

3.  Nuclear release, even of det-laser nukes, probably will not be
granted in the vicinity of friendly worlds without _very_ good reason,
due to the potential effects on the planet\'s magnetic field and/or "Van
Allen Belt."

What about the radiation effects of meson guns?  Would this be a

M-Drives in both HG and MT are dirt-cheap, relatively speaking...MCr.5 in HG,

  STL stutterwarp hardly seems terribly crucial, particularly if it\'s
very slow - thrusters have their own problems, sadly. OTOH, I think
allowing micro-jumps substantially under a week would cause problems...

  Heck, if Trav books are going to be contradicting themselves often enough

I\'ll just hang around the Alternity *Stardrive* web ring for scenarios -

  Presumably the 9+ assumes level-2, per HG. Further, repairs are stated to
require a full ships crew to attempt; this translates perhaps as "normal
damage control contingent for said ship must be available with the engineering
component averaging skill 2 to obtain a 9+ roll each turn"?

  Clarification - energy as in "laser beam density sufficient to inflict

It\'s a relatively simple task for a medium-sized military sensor (the
kind you\'d find on a 3000-dTon destroyer or so (PEMS-14.) 

of about 7m at this range. (It\'s a 30-m-diameter 50m2 area interferometric
array; costs about MCr 250 at TL15, making it a reasonably choice for a 
destroyer (or maybe a heavy destroyer.) A dinky little SDB will have more
trouble (although a LIDAR might be able to tell that there are two
targets there.) (A good SDB sensor - a PEMS-13.5 or so - woul dhave a resolution
of 20m at 500,000 km.)

	Why does everyone keep making this assumption???  Has anyone on the list ever

he crertainly convinced me that if I was, he\'d give it to me!!  Most merchant
crews don\'t care...give them what they want, let them leave, then scream for
help as soon as it\'s safe.  The insurance company pays off, and nobody
dies...probably including the pirates!
	BTW...I should mention that every time I was robbed, I was also armed:  for
the most part, it happened to quick to safely engage the criminal, since he
was already in the store.

No, its the one that says "Piracy is possible but limited to these specific
situations, and in these ways" and goes on to outline those situations in
sufficiently flexible terms that in Most Traveller universesthay can be
interpreted to be acceptable.

It is a good basis for ending the piracy debate, or at least getting to the
point where it is declared dead for the forseeable future (like, until
February or so).

This morning I deleted 100+ messages on the sole criterion that the word
"pirate" was in the header somewhere, in some form.  The signal to noise
ration (for me) improved significantly.

Maybe we should establish a "Pirate Debate" mailing list to get
this...stuff (that word edited several times) off the main TML.

You\'d probably be wrong about that, I think most of the list would
recognize my games as being traveller, but it wouldn\'t especially
bother me if they didn\'t. Interestingly, my use of stutterwarp came
about because I was trying to maintain what I consider the fundamental
assumptions of traveller. We might disagree on what those fundamental
assumptions are, of course, but there *is* a set that I *would*
recognize as required for a game to have the traveller feel.

Sheeze! Now you\'re insulting *everybody* except me!  Well, at least
you\'re equal opportunity about it. ;-> Wil, I use other people\'s
material when I can too. There\'s a middle ground between every piece
of published material fitting so tightly into a coherent whole that
you have to accept the total to get the part, and every piece of
published material being totally disjointed so you can\'t use it within
some "official storyline." All I\'m saying is don\'t nail the coffin lid
down, us oldtimers still need some air to breath. 

> -Wil
> (a heretic, but still a canonist)

As I\'ve said before many times before, I don\'t like the term "canon"
because of how it ends up being applied. It always seems to become
exclusionary.."don\'t follow the revealed word, then you aren\'t
\'legitment\' and you should be stoned!" ;-> Ok, for this kind of
conversation, being stoned might not be such a bad idea, but you know
what I mean. 

If you limit yourself to a small set of fundamental assumptions then I
could even be called by that "c" word myself, although I never would
admit it. ;->  But, because trying to identify that set of assumptions
would most likely set off another explosion, let\'s not. Personally,
I\'m happy to let each person define the assumptions that make
traveller...traveller for themselves. 


Eris,
  maybe I\'m a Traveller fundamentalist? 
  or maybe I\'m a Traveller Bhuddist?
  I\'m certainly still a heretic! ;->

Well, in the first place, unless things are really, REALLY bad, the Navy
doesn\'t let a jg command much of anything...much less a heavily armed
warship. I suppose, given the C&C structure of the Imperial Navy,
planetary bombardment authorizations would land on the highest ranking
officer in contact with the units involved, ie: if the DE is part of a
fleet in the same system as our hypothetical Lt. Greenhorn, the overall
fleet commander has the authority. This authority will trickle down the
ranks by seniority as the size of the local Naval contingent decreases.
So, under the right circumstances Lt Greenhorn _would_ be the one to
authorize the use of nuclear or kk force.

However, there has to be intensive indoctrination of Naval officers in
the appropriate use of force throughout the academy, as this is probably
the most important thing to learn as a command officer in a
decentralized force such as the IN. Lt Greenhorn will undoubtedly face a
board of inquiry if he comes back to base with the seals on the nuke and
kkm armory broken. He will have to show to the boards satisfaction that
the use of the nuke was unavoidable in the face of a greater threat.
That bar is very high when it comes to nuking civilian populations; if
the board doesn\'t like what he did, he can be cashiered, courtmartialed,
or turned over to Imperial courts for commiting genocide under the
Imperial Rules of War.

IMO this is one reason that the Black War during the Rebellion got so
black...so many experienced naval officers had been lost that
inexperienced, untrained, and often more than a little fanatical people
ended up commanding these ships.

I refer you to the Original Post(tm) where the assumption is that the Scream 
has taken place.  How is immaterial to the scenario.  When was assumed to be 
the moment of boarding.

Not to change threads or anything, but I have a request for 
assistance that I would like to make to the list.  I will soon be 
starting a campaign called StarRise, taking place during the 
Solomani\'s first steps into the world of interstellar contact, 
starting with Barnard\'s Star in 2094AD.  I would like to keep as much 
with OTU canon as I can, despite the fact that I am using HERO System 
Rules due to player psych lims.

I would appreciate any references that anyone might be able to give 
me regarding the worlds and the milieu of the Solomani Rim during 
that time period.  (I don\'t have access to my AM:Solomani, 
unfortunately, and I won\'t until the holidays.)  I have seen Mick 
Bailey\'s Milieu 0 work on the Solomani Rim, and will be taking a lot 
from there, as well as Harold Hale\'s work on the Vegans.  (Are there 
any other minor races in the sector besides the chips?  I haven\'t 
found any references on the web yet.)  If I have used the wrong names 
in giving credit for hard work done, then I apologize.

In addition, there are a number of timeline continuity issues that I 
have noticed.  Solomani discovers Jump Drives on various dates in the 
latter half of the 21st century.  Solomani encounter Vilani in either 
2094AD or 2096AD, depending on your source.  (GT sites both.)  The 
Terran Confederations starts on either 2120AD or 2220AD (GT sites 
both.)  I\'ve found on the net that it could have also been 2020AD.

One of the goals I have to build a reliable timeline from the present 
to the formation of the Terran Confederation and the beginning of the 
First Interstellar War.

All information that I compile for Project: StarRise will be made 
available via its website, which will be up by the end of November.  
(I\'ll post the URL once I\'ve got it up and going.)  Thank you all for 
your time and help in this.  My gamers and I appreciate it.

Solar limits ARE canonical.  In LBB 6, Scouts, it talks about stellar
radii:  

"Radius is used to determine if orbits are possible, or if they would be
inside a specific star.  Radius can also be used to determine minimum
jump distance from a star (misjumps are more probable inside 20 radii
and 200 radii from the star)."

LBB 6 page 42

 having only 3 lasers, would have a USP of 3, not 4.  Under the standard 
 assumption, you can take, for example, a 3KT boat and put 30 single laser 
 turrets on it, each turret configured as its own battery.  The ship\'s USP 
 value for the lasers is 8, unless they\'re TL13 or better lasers, in which 
 case, they\'re Factor 9.  Now, each laser is its own battery.  Does each 
 battery now attack as Factor 8, or does it attack as Factor 1?  Think very 
 carefully about this now.
 
 30 Factor 8 shots means your 3KT boat can outshoot a heavy cruiser.  Odd are,
 at least 15 of those shots will hit and penetrate.  On a 400 ton hull,
they\'ll 
 also inflict 4 critical hits for each hit, since if your weapons factor is 
 greater than the USP hull size, you get the difference in criticals.  We\'re 
 looking at 60 critical hits per combat round.  There\'s a 1 in 11 chance that 
 the ship will be vaporised.  60 critical hits makes this a statistical 
 certainty.  See what I mean? >>

	Now this is where I get confused by your "fix".  You can only get Factor 8 by
having 30 lasers firing AS one battery...other wise, you have 30 Factor 1
attacks which will not do Crits on the 400 ton ship.  The tables for HG list
the number of weapons needed to achieve the desired rating...but it makes no
difference how many weapons are in the turret, each turret weighs 1 ton.  If
you have 30 hardpoints, why only put in 1 laser (giving you 1Factor 8 attack)
when you can triple them up and get 3 factor 8 attacks??

	Using the lower numbers makes some tactical sense sometimes, at least in
larger ships.  Most lasers are only useful in a PD mode anyway (vs Capital
Ships,, I\'m talking about) and free damage hits...so which makes more sense:
100 factor 8 laser batteries (which takes 300 lasers) or 200 factor 6 laser
batteries (which also takes 300 lasers)  Granted, the chance of penetrating
the lower factor is higher...but in the end, I think the numbers (i.e. twice
the # of attempts to stop the attack) make it a better option in some cases.


PS:  You can ignore the first part of this post...the situation you described
finally gelled in my drug-addled brain.  I was confused by the question you
had asked WRT what rating they fired at.

Under CT, you misjump on 13+.  DM\'s are +5 for being inside the 100 diameter 
curb, +10 for jumping inside the 10 diameter curb.  These are not cumulative.
This says, there\'s about a 33% chance of misjump inside the 100 diameter curb. 
 If you\'re on a schedule, do you REALLY want to take the chance?

*shrug*  This just adds more fuel to the argument I make that a pirate would 
take *outbound* targets rather than *inbound*.

IMTU, you come out at the 100 diameter curb.  Rationalisation for this is, since it affects the *entrance* into jumpspace, it probably affects the *exit*, too.  But I *also* use the 100 diameter solar jump curb, too, and in detailed systems, the mainworld sometimes is inside this limit.  In a couple cases IMTU, *VERY* deep within it.  It adds a bit to the \'look & feel\' of the game, IMNSFBHO.  YMMV.

Two questions.  You use MT, yes?  And the \'golden BB\' effect applies equally

It\'s chicken stealing.  After awhile, those little boats start arming up and

I ran an economic analysis of piracy a couple weeks ago. If there is

No, it means the default Gunnery-2 skill is already factored into the tables

OK.  I was thinking you were saying fusion/plasma guns there.

But still, let\'s ignore sensor limits here for a second.  The Intruder is 1.28 million klicks away from the planet.  That\'s 4.25 light-seconds & change.  Ignore the change.  Where\'s the sat?  If it\'s more than 300K klicks out, there is lightspeed lag to and from the sat for tracking update purposes and command purposes.  Best-case shot is 9 seconds turnaround time between aquisition of the image of Intruder at the curb and firing a response beam.  We\'re totally ignoring processor time and decision to fire time here.

And I don\'t know about you, but I find the thought of somebody hitting a target at 1.28 million klicks to be ridiculous.  Space is deep, and targets at that range are gonna be *small*.

Interesting idea.  But what if we designate the prize crew is now \'the crew\' for the purposes of the repairs?  Nothing stopping us.

Forget just Gunners. What does EVERYONE do for the week in jump? You can
only \'check the panel\' so many times. The systems obviously do not require
constant attention, or else the scout pilot would be VERY sleep-deprived.

What are some of the ways that your PCs have found to pass the time in
jumpspace?

At least it doesn\'t address this in either LBB2 or T4.  I don\'t have MT

Alternately, an invasion force would want to jump closer than 100-D from
the target world, in order to achieve surprise (we actually did this in
our current campaign [my character is Colonel-in-command of an Imperial
Army Jump Infantry regiment {the 1199th}]).

How about assigning (in T4) difficult ratings, based on destination? 
F\'r instance:

a.  To exit jump _somewhere_ in a system (without regard as to location
in-system):  EASY (referee randomly places you _somewhere_
in-system....)

b.  To exit jump at the 100-d limit of a given celestial body within
that system:  AVERAGE (the default setting)(failure has results as a.,
above)

c.  To exit jump at a planned point outside the 100-d limit of any
celestial body:  DIFFICULT (fewer gravitic cues)(failure has results as
a., above)

d.  To exit jump within 50-d of a given celestial body:
FORMIDABLE (failure results in major damage to jump drives [8-] or
misjump [9+])

e.  To exit jump within 10-d of a givern celestial body:
STAGGERING (failure results in destruction of jump drives [8-] or
destruction of the ship [9+])

(All exit tasks assume that you made your roll to enter jumpspace, and
are based on Astrogation.  Damage, misjump, and destruction results can
be adjusted 1 pip in either direction for each level of Engineering
skill the Chief Engineer has.)

Of course, these are off the top of my head, so please comment.

...and this is actually used in the TARSUS boxed set, in which it turns
out Tarsus/District 268 is within the local stellar 100-diameter limit,
adding travel time.  I\'ll have to find the quote sometime.

I don\'t care what CT says in this regard. 150,000,000 Joules/second
is a huge amount of energy. If CT says 2 ls for that, it\'s wrong.
Period.

If a ship with reaction drive (CT doesn\'t specify that drives are
reactionless as far as I remember) were to be thrusting you\'d see it
if it was in orbit around jupiter.

100 diamters is 100 diameters. Even in CT, if the world was within
the 100d limit of the star you had to be outside it to jump safely.

If you can disarm and disable a multi-turreted trader right next to
the system\'s primary world, then loot it--all within the 2 hour
response time of SDBs, then armed cutters a few days from help
shouldn\'t be a problem.

You can also limit the trusted crew (of the pirate) since you don\'t
need to have a prize crew (and who knows if you\'ll ever see them
again once they jump--now *you\'ve* been robbed!).

<< ObTrav: I think this can relate to starship armament. Possibly Imperials
 regard arms on merchants the same way most Americans regard handguns: as a
 right and necessary protection. Sure, the IN could stamp out piracy if all
 ships were disarmed, but that would be as unthinkable as disarming all
 Americans. Thoughts?
 
 
  >>
To start with, I think that the carrying of weapons is cultural. In Europe
(and any European culturally influenced countries with the exception of the
United States), it is pretty much unacceptable for the general civilian
populace to carry weapons. The one exception seems to be hunting and sporting
weapons for the wealthy. This started with the Medieval concept of the only
the high born being allowed to carry weapons (as a badge of rank) and to hunt.
This was reinforced after firearms became commonly available. While an
arquebus was an inferior weapon to a longbow, it could be mastered in weeks
rather than in years. Thus the peasants and especially the new middle classes
could now have weapons that could defeat the noble and royal soldiers. This
was decicdedly NOT a good thing in the eyes of the ruling classes who promptly
banned the posession of firearms by private citizens (it is interesting to
note that the upper classes adopted them like they did edged weapons in the
pre-gunpowder days, and left us impresive museum exibits). Thus the tradition
in most of Europe (a pity in my yankee biased opinion) that firearms are only
to be used by the police and the armed forces. Thus the European anti-firearms
laws passed, starting at the beginning of the 20th. century. (I also found it
interesting that both the fascists and the communists promptly confiscated all
privately held weapons as soon as they came to power). This view is further
reinforced by the relative lack of violent crime (I say relative- an armed
robbery is still a violent crime if the perp has a knife instead of a gun) in
Europe, Japan, and the former British dominions.

	The United States on the other hand is influenced by an entirely different
set of parameters.... This country was frontier when settled. It was vital
that the settlers own firearms to survive (though doubtless the Native
Americans would have preferred that they didn\'t have them...). In addition
there was the little matter of the Revolution (or the rebellion as our
estranged cousins on the other side of the pond would call it..:-) ). This
ingrained the concept of the armed citizen to oppose government oppression
(real or imagined) as put in writing in the 2nd Ammendment of the US
Constitution (whose lawed grammar has fueled the arguments on both sides of
the US gun control arguement). Lastly the "settling of the west" further
reinforced this concept of the private citizen\'s right to self defense. Many
of the infamous gunfights (like the James-Younger, Minn. raid, and the Dalton
gang Coffeeville raid) were settled by the townspeople defending themselves
via shotguns in their places of businesses. These concepts of armed civilians
have been eroded by 20th. century asassinations, the "roaring twenties",
immigration by peoples from lands where firearms posession is a "no-no", and a
desire to seem as "civilised" as the rest of the world. This last one I doubt,
as when I am at my local range, it is usually crowded by Asian and European
tourists renting fully automatic submachine guns to shoot (legally owned by
the range-the have a hard to obtain Federal class III machine gun permit).
Never the less, the firearms issue is a big one in the US, with the cities in
the Northeast, the upper Mid west, and the west coast, being anti-gun (their
laws are as least as restrictive as Europe and Japan), and the "heartland"
being very permissive.

	These opposing mindsets make for interesting observations by each side. As a
firearm bearing American; I find it repulsive and very dangerous to live in a
country where the government has a monopoly on violence. Of course a European,
Japanese, Canadian, or Australian no doubt thinks that I am a paranoid,
homocidal maniac. These widely differing viewpoints make compromise or even
civil debate very difficult (see the US debate on firearms control. Most
people gravitate to one pole or the other and both demonize the other side and
COMBINE to ridicule anyone tries to offer a workable compromise).

OB. Traveller: 
Well....
For one thing the law level seems to be a workable solution to small arms
ownership (though what is the law level INSIDE the extra-territorial Imperial
starport?). The polarized real firearms views could be mimicked in the
Imperium, and it could be as virilent as the pro-anti Psionics-Zhodani debate.
As for starship weapons; it appears that I have seen canon that suggests that
the Imperium is very laisse faire towards interstellar trade. I would think
that they would take the view to allow whatever promotes trade, and to ban
whatever hinders trade. Thus I see the allowance of turret weapons (with the
exception of nuclear missiles, turret and barbette PAWs (radiation hazard?),
fusion guns (radiation hazard?). I could see a ban on spinal mounts, bays, and
all Meson and particle weapons (weapons of mass destruction and/or radiation
clause), and screens (keep it a government monopoly).

	I could also see that the ships would need papers and licenses to own
weapons, and many exceptions to where they can and cannot take them (ex. no
weapons in naval depots and in core sector). Lastly, I can see individual
worlds in the Imperium setting stricter (but not looser) controls on shipboard
weapons. These laws would only cover the space "owned" by the local
government, and I can see much conflict about when and where Imperial starship
weapons laws jurisdiction begins, and ends (hmm... an adventure nugget for
"paperwork" based PC\'s).

It would be for a large passive sensor. About 80m in diameter gives
to 5m pixels at 600kkm. Newer design systems have assumed (rightly,
IMO) that traveller sensors are arrays of small sensors spread out
over the hull, this isn\'t a bad number for even a smallish warship
to have. probably not a 400ton SDB, but the planetary sensors in
orbit shouldn\'t have any trouble.

My view of the Imperium tended towards the "punish the terrorists at
all costs." I see them as deciding that the rare loss of a merchie
crew to naval actions would be worth the deterrant effect of not
pulling any punches. They\'d close in and *not* damage the trader if
their computers tolds them they\'d arrive in time, mind you.

Compared to a Type M worth 237 MCr?  Chicken stealing.

I\'m assuming you don\'t have a copy of LoM.  There\'s only 100 of them out 
there.  Typical prize shares on a pirate would be on the order of:

8 for the captain
6 for each bridge officer or prize master
4 for each gunner & engineer
2 for medic or prize officer
1 for each \'ordinary spacer\'.

If the pirate is being \'backed\' by investors, the prize pool is split 50/50 
with the crew after ships\' expenses are taken out.  Standard crew is 9, but 
that *DOESN\'T* include prize crews or boarding parties.  Andy\'s Type NP Raider 
has a minimum crew of 4, with provisons for 16 more to be carried.  Figure, 3 
or 4 for the prize crew.  Pilot.  3 gunners.  Navigator.  Commo/comp officer.  
Prize master, 3 prize crew, 3 engineers, 17 general spacehands for boarding 
parties.  This means 67 shares.

I wouldn\'t expect the lifeboat to be in showroom condition, so you won\'t get 
book value for it.  AAMOF, IMO, you\'d be lucky to get 25% of book for it.  But 
let\'s be generous and say you get half value.  That\'s 7 million.  Pay the 
investors.  You have 3.5 million left.  Each share is thus worth 52238 
credits.  That\'s chicken stealing.

Assume the same crew takes a Type M.  They get the same 50% book price.  
That\'s 118.5 mil.  Repairs to the raider go 30 mil this cruise.  This leaves 
88.5 mil.  Half that is the crew\'s.  That leaves 44.25 mil.  Each of the 67 
shares is now worth 660,477 Cr.

Which crew do you want to be with?

This is wrong. You get a "free" critical hit for each value by which
the weapon exceeds the ship size USP. Many military ships in the
400+ size range can critical trader sized ships multiple times every
time they hit.

(they need to have all one type of weaponry in a big battery,
usually)

Well, first of all if a Shugili (by all acounts a member of society with a
lot of
pull) is going to try and starve you, the is going to make sure you don\'t have
access to any food.  Second have be unable to get any other food and be in
a position to have free access to significant numbers of recently deceased
(which is going to be rare) or you have to kill your own (which will be
vigorously opposed).  I really don\'t see this being any more common than
people on the Earth resorting to cannibalism when stuck in mountains
from an accident, etc.

Large numbers of people on the Earth have, and do, exsit with little
or no meat without resorting to cannibalism.

That\'s why you fire a bunch of shots at them. You mentioned in one
post "saving your ONE shot." I don\'t think anybody has assumed one
shot per 20 minute turn per weapon in a long time (if ever). The
assumption was that a ship fires many times, and has some chance of
one shot hitting in a turn. Newer combat systems define rates of
fire for lasers in hundreds of shots per hour. Probably a reasonable
figure.

The fact that you can engage targets at any significant range with
lasers that fit 3 to a CT-sized turret requires something like the
TNE concept of gravity focusing. Energy densities to burn through
metal are numbers that are actually known, so at the very least
those figures can be fairly accurate. Once you go to grav focus (the
only way to support the traveller feel of little lasers) then you
get weapons that can hit targets at several light seconds (or,
rather, they can do damage at that range if you hit).

Yes, they take damage, and are in fact fairly fragile as individual

pretty well, though (like having a few bad pixels on your monitor).

Values are quite a bit lower when you get craft designed by cheapskates
under FFS2 - for example, my TL13 armed Customs Cutter/Anti Shipping
Missile came in at about MCr 1.4. Boats using T-plates are going to cost at
least MCr 3 though, because the 10m3 minimum size for T-plates means they
cost at least MCr 2.5 per thruster plate unit.

But yeah, chicken stealing is the bread and butter of a pirate. Hanging
around mainworlds runs into convoys going out, patrols around the perimeter
and having to play with mainworld defenses if you do manage to find a target.

If you can keep the air filters clean with proceeds from chicken stealing,
then when that opportunity for One Big Score comes along, then you wont be
dead ...

  Being attacked by a pirate, with all the risks of death and destruction

More likely than not you\'ll be stealing ships doing business out in
the system. Cutters, shuttles, even specialty cargo ships that might
be trader sized, but without j-drives. 10s of millions would be more
like it.

You need to add in that it takes longer to set up for taking the
starship. That it is *far* more dangerous (we could do a PBeM using
HG with Mayday movement and try a couple, perhaps). You also need to
have a prize crew (a % of which will take off with the ship). You
say you\'ll get 50% for the type M. You will likely need a new
powerplant and or Mdrive, add that in (you *had* to destroy one of
them to board, by definition).

you can also take multiple small craft in your hold.

These would work for the "privacy doors" on the non-pressure tight
partition walls you\'ll find between bulkheads. Most passenger areas
will be on the other side of bulkheads from the vital stuff (reference
Fat Trader & Free Trader deckplans (CT Book 7 and DGP\'s SOMv1
respectively) and 6 of the 7 passenger staterooms on the Far Trader
in CT Book 7), the pass-throughs on these bulkheads are pretty
damn strong. Iris valves and pressure hatches need strong stuff to
get through quickly, and you might need to go around some stubborn
crewmen by making another door anyway.

They certainly do (I lost track of who\'s firing at the SDB at this point
in the scenario...) However, arrays have a fair amount of redundancy - each
element operates independently - so it takes a fair amount of damage to
knock one out completely.

IMTU, it would depend on where the boat was from.  The Carrillians (a.k.a. 
\'Carrots\' IMTU) would authorise them quicker than the Imperials.  The 
Caledonians would authorise them under the same circumstances as the 
Imperials.  The Harmonies would launch them as a matter of course, especially 
if there\'s an Aslan on the recieving end.  A Rintaran would pay somebody 
*else* to launch them.  <grin>

All missiles IMTU hit the target & go boom.  No laser heads.

Again, it would depend on who was doing the shooting.  Some of the polities in 
the astrographical area of my PBEM wouldn\'t care that somebody glows in the 
dark.  Others want to get along with their neighbors even if the intended 
response is to be left the hell alone.

I\'d figure that a military ship would be shielded against EMP as a matter of 
course.  So would a scout ship.  I\'ve never thought through the implications 
of it against civilian ships, since nukes tend to be the exclusive property of 
the military.

Shouldn\'t be too hard.  Knighted in recognition of services rendered to
the Imperium.  Most TL 15 planets will probably have more nobles than
you can shake a stick at.

There are a great many TL 15 planets.  Since you\'re not playing
in someone else\'s TU (Traveller Universe), just pick one.

  FWIW, second edition has the same para (p.6) say "_of a world_".

  Isn\'t there going to be a real problem with crews retiring after
one or two scores that big? And aren\'t such defectors going to be
real potential hassles in several respects?

Keven, mate.

The type M is a slow, undergunned, very fat trader.

Please explain what it is doing not in a convoy with a number of other
ships, escorted by a member of the local constabulary.

Costing MCr 237 should also mean that rounding error on the accounts allows
it to have a computer program suite including Generate.

If the system doesnt run regular convoys, then I personally cant see a type
M going there. Leave those sort of places to the devil may care ne\'er do
wells in the Type A2s.

If you like, give me a budget for a smallish world for piracy prevention,
and I\'ll see how I go. I\'ll use HG for ship designs.

That might be interesting.  Wish I had a copy of Mayday around here.

But the thing is, all you have to do is *disable* the M-drive or the power 
plant, not destroy it.

Also, if you took good care of your crew (paid them good, made sure they had 
medical attention when they needed it, got them good shore leave) and had a 
good track record of bringing in the prizes, it would cut down the chances 
they would skip out with the prize.

His Reavers\' Deep data is pretty sketchy.  I can\'t remember which of my

said \'go right ahead, I don\'t mind, I\'m just babysitting it."

Possible.  But the tales they\'ll tell while \'on the beach\' about their former 
skipper would likely influence possible recruits in a positive manner.

  That\'s what I implied; the 9+ target includes skill 2, of course, and the

in DC complement. OC, some of those boarders would be earning Cr 4000+ /month

Doing its job of making a specific trading route.  If there\'s no convoy 
availiable, there\'s no convoy availiable.  If they\'re behind schedule, they 
might take the risk.

There\'s still a 50/50 chance they\'ll go out to a point on the sphere in the 
same hemisphere as you are, thus, it\'s still possible to intercept them.

Type M\'s & Type R\'s are specifically designed to do dedicated routes for 
governments or others who want to see new trade routes developed.  It\'s in 
their contract to visit some otherwise unvisited worlds.

I\'ll take the crew that stays alive, thank you. And the crew with
a steady income, rather than the crew that keeps seeing
success slip through their fingers.

My analysis gave a 25% value to captured small craft and vehicles as
well. It also postulated a Traveller Universe where taking captured
ships with you was difficult and often unsuccessful, so you would often
have to survive on small craft, vehicles, vacc suits, spare parts, 
crew & passenger valuables and other things that were easily
plunderable. And it\'s trivially easy to make a starship impossible
to get away with, at least for the couple hour window you might get.

Consider that all your jump drive and maneuver drive repairs are
useless if the anti-hijack program running on the ship automatically
locked out all Generate/Jump programs for two hours after it detected
a piracy boarding situation, no matter what the crew did. I\'m talking
a lock like a time-lock on a safe - unless you have a computer hacker
extraordinaire on board, you\'re not leaving with that starship. 

Consider a Junior Purser with a submachinegun. He can whack the
main computers in seconds, at least enough to keep you from
taking the ship. It\'s well worth the couple MCr damage if it means you
get to keep the  the MCr180 starship. There will be plenty of Corporate 
Security Officers indoctrinated to do just that kind of thing, with such an
expensive asset to protect. There will be plenty of hard-nosed independent
Free Trader captains who will do that out of desperation - they worked
decades to get their own ship, they\'ll not see it jumped away from them.
Sure, you can kill the crew in retaliation. You wanted a reputation as
a bloodthirsty murderer, so all the local merchant crews would resist
your boarding ops to the death, right?

Let\'s see, I jump at 80D, I\'m OK on a 9 or less. I stay here, I\'m
at the mercy of a crew of desperate characters who will kill me
if I look at them funny, or if they\'re having a bad day. Pirate reputations
will matter a lot here, but I\'m not convinced that a pirate who hunts a
certain area long enough to get a reputation will survive the anti-piracy 
patrol his long-term presence will generate.

Consider the fuel situation. Did you bring enough fuel with you to
jump your ship away, _and_ a prize ship? Do you have enough time
to board, take control, EVA, rig hoses and transfer fuel? A problem 
if the target was inbound. Did the outbound target chicken out and 
not try a 11D to 99D jump? That\'s better, unless some crewman 
vented fuel before you boarded (our intrepid Junior Purser again) or 
you had to put some holes in the fuel tanks to catch him.

Would you like a copy of my earlier analysis of pirate economics?

Piracy requires that weapon be fired. Firing at a ship isn\'t armed
robbery, it\'s attempted murder. As far as I\'m concerned (this goes
for here and now, as well :-) attempted murder and murder are the
same thing. You shouldn\'t punish somebody less because they didn\'t
succeed in what they tried to do.

Piracy is attempted mass murder then, and pirates should be treated
as such.

The easiest thing to do is what my character did on a subsidized

(obviously this only works for hijacking). The door to engineering
is a *long* way down at 2gs :-)

Sounds like Dragonlance to me. Led by the nose the whole way...

IMTU, I have the 5FW starting in late 1105, just to keep the players
off-balance. Oh, and Regina has been subjugated - although the destruction
of the Zho 40th Fleet at Fulacin (!) will probably tip the balance back to
"normal" (ie. canon). Ah well, the PC\'s *will* insist on playing with those
newly-discovered Ancient weapons, won\'t they? ;-)

However, even though I change things IMTU, if I try writing something up
(like Tavonni) I modify things so that it fits into established canon as
well as possible. Official changes can be a pain - I have heard that
Glorithana (?) people call it being "Gregged".

I firmly belong to the "make the OTU stuff fit, but I will always change
things IMTU" group.

  As a ship designed (at TL 14) for fleet operations and later deployed to
"protect ships from the menace of pirate activity.. ..in convoys with armed
escorts", why would it be wasted in positional defense?

  Of course, their use as Imperial or \'Colonial Fleet\' ships on "routine
patrols in troubled areas in the hope of catching corsairs in the act"
would make the existence of such patrols quite explicable, in addition
to being canonical. :)

  Interestingly, even escorting J-2 (or 3?) ships they could use their
tanks to avoid having to refuel themselves to provide extra security at
particularly risky spots.

  Perhaps you and Mr. Pittsinger could debate combat systems for our
edification, as the Original Post (tm)* specified rules under which
what you\'re stating is not possible? Further, it would take non-trivial
time if it were possible except using special rules created for the
purpose. Finally, such an event happening with any regularity would
go a long way towards giving security elements carte blanche to kill
any confirmed target that wasn\'t docked to a liner or similar.

  Canada\'s incidence of violent crimes is decreasing slightly now, apparently
in connection with post-Boom demographics - thus it\'s just as erroneous to
attribute past increased shootings to gun control as it would now be to credit
ongoing tightening of registration with any further decreases. It would still
be unclear why our gun control laws would increase shootings, and yet your
_rate_ is so vastly greater with laxer regulations.

  It\'s probably a lot more accurate to say that gun related crimes are more
common in urban centers of any sort - North American, at least. The fact that
a difference in broad trends exists with Europe should alert us to something;
at a guess I\'d relate it to the highly disjointed social structures of NorAm
cities, especially away from the Eastern seaboard, where most of the population
is relatively recent immigrants or very mobile.

  A recent UK newspaper article more or less briefly explained the higher
percentages for the US as basically "just because".

  Well, you could, but then only pirates would have them :)  Seriously,

OK, contemporary military hardware is spec\'ed to within 1%.  At range, what is the availiable width of the target in degrees?  It\'s been awhile since I did any geometry.  Personally, I still think hitting a 30 meter target at range is gonna be difficult at best.  So, let\'s see your math.  Convince me.

A 600K+ score once a year translates down to 50K a month.  Since you only need 
1 score, you could concieveably do this part time.  Not bad for a part time 
gig, assuming 1 prize taken per year.  And I didn\'t factor in the cargo either.

That depends on social customs. If piracy is common and pirates have a 
reputation for (a) being very polite to people who surrender (putting them
on lifeboats), while (b) brutally killing anyone who fights (and a 
merchant with turrets and drive disabled can be completely totalled by a 
KKM), surrenders might be common - especially if there isn\'t much social
stigma attached (like in the 18th/19th century, when even warships would
surrender if outmatched.)

Gods, now we\'re getting intot he whole nature-of-combat debate...
In TNE/T4 (which is the baseline many of us are using), and in a
Reasonable Technical Extrapolation from the real world (see various missile
debates in the archives), point defence lasers can get good enough that
contact nuclear missile hits are essentially impossible; the dominant missile
is the detonation laser, with a small role for fragmentation kinetic-energy
weapons (for civilians), chemical laser warheads (also for civilians) and
really high-end kinetic impact weapons (depending on the exact assumptions
used.) Besides, sensor apertures/array elements can be at least as "hard" as
laser focal/launch arrays (since they\'re basically the same thing - mirrors
or lenses), so scrapign the sensor off is no easier than scraping a 
weapon off.

Fuel hits only take a couple percentage points of fuel out.  I don\'t see the 
Junior Purser dumping fuel to deny the jump; with luck, the Target can still 
make an emergency jump.  If the ship is captured before the jump, the pirates 
*might* let the crew & passengers live if a jump isn\'t denied to them.  I 
don\'t see them being that charitable if the Junior Purser dumps the fuel.

Of course, the Pirate could always carry spare fuel in bladders in its hold...

I see. So basically, what you\'re saying is that Traveller cannot change, and
as such can never be a viable and popular game unless there\'s a resurgance
in the popularity of older style sci-fi?

One possible scenario, just as the Third Imperium is but one possible result
of Interstellar travel. We accept the Imperium as our shared universe...
because it was created 20+ years ago?

Not quite. I was left with a hostile playing group that really wanted
nothing to do with Traveller\'s _technology_ the way it is. Even in limited
form they expected the science part of science-fiction.

You can only try to explain to your players that "the Vilani are resistant
to change" so long before you have to explain that it\'s not the Vilani, but
in fact the people who write the supplements and the game.

Then people are going to pick up T5, flip through it, say "Yeah, that might
happen," and pass right over it. I like the background of Traveller. It\'s a
fine background, in a very broad sense. The niggling over little details is
where it falls apart and that\'s the Achilles heel of Traveller.

I have yet to see a Traveller version of the future that isn\'t hopelessly
mired in the sci-fi of the past. Seeing as I wasn\'t weened on the sci-fi of
the past, nor were my players, it\'s impossible for me to use Traveller\'s
canon. Since Traveller\'s canon is so inflexible I can hardly use any but the
broadest of supplements in my own campaign. As such, if T5 came out tomorrow
I\'d likely buy very few of the books. This is the equivilant of several
customers lost, as the rest of my gaming group wouldn\'t be buying much
either...

It\'s an environment in which, according to canon very few types of
adventures can be created. The universe is tailored to mercenary adventures
and ill-suited to too much else. The Imperium can never change (as its
history past and future is broadly mapped out), so any sort of political
intrigue is nigh unto useless. The Traveller setting, like the Third
Imperium, is bounded by closed borders.

You can jump anywhere. I\'ve had players jump successfuly while inside an
atmosphere. Once a character dumped a cargo bay full of TDX onto a Zhodani
town and decided he didn\'t want to wait for the planetary defense system to
open up on him. I set the appropriate throw modifiers and he made the role
without incident.

I also don\'t see crews of corporation owned subbies fighting to the death for the Company when all they get is a paycheck, particularly if the aforementioned pirate crew has the \'A\' reputation.  Personally, I don\'t see the axiom of \'every pirate attack *MUST KILL ALL THE WITNESSES*\' as being very business-like or cost-effective in the long run.  Of course, if the Target\'s crew insists on continuing the fight long after the point where it\'s obvious they can\'t win, it\'s almost a no-brainer that the pirates *WILL* kill them.  However, this does *NOT* mean they\'ll kill the passengers, too.  Successful pirates are businessmen too.

  Comrade Vice-Chair! I started researching this last week or so (as
an off-shoot of the "Rabid Poodle" Multi-Role SDB & co. posts). HG is
limited somewhat, but the vast majority of hardware and assumptions are
contained in HG/Striker/TCS. Sadly, I don\'t speak FFS2-ish.

  BTW, it looks like the UK paid the Yanks around three million pounds
in 1871 as compensation for the damage done to Northern shipping by the
commerce raiders built in the UK. Significantly, the authorities became
aware of the ships construction (despite Confederate efforts to conceal
them, and the fact that they were civilian ship classes), but were unable
to stop their deployment to foreign ports (where armament was installed)
as then-current international law only addressed _warships_.

  A good example, perhaps, of what the Imperiums attitude might be towards
both internal construction of major security threats and foreign states
with a tendency to explore Imperial tolerance.

  Naw, you just allow more of them to have firearms. :>

  FWIW, military technology has so drastically changed since even the turn
of the century that all modern militaries in the OECD have an _effective_
monopoly on violence*, although it is highly dubious to try and contemplate
a situation in which the US military (for example) would turn en masse against
the civil order. OTOH, it happened in Argentina.

 * which probably isn\'t a bad basis for looking at the IN, given the 
economic data in Striker.

I disagree with this interpretation of HG :-/

It states  p49, 2nd ed, that _Weapon-n_ is _each hit destroys one battery
of weapons_ ....._if the ship has only one battery of a type [Dom - ie the
first hit killed your A battery] a hit reduces the USP by the indicated
amount_. So the first hit kills one triple turret, and it takes a further 3
hits to kill the remaining one turret (not that I necessarily think this is
realistic, just more playable).

I just assume they are more robust (Analogy -say a solid state device
compared to a valve - I\'ve dropped chips and valves on a floor, but the
valves broke more often).

My trite answer would be that it depends on the number of gunners - a
single gunner can fire a single turret  or a single battery of turrets....
I wouldn\'t allow more turret based batteries than the ship has turrets,
although I agree that this is not directly stated, probably because it
would outlaw mixed turrets. I don\'t normally allow mixed turrets on HG
designs, only on players ships (handwave, handwave from the rules for
ships<1kT). I would make 10 rolls at USP 3 or 1 roll at USP 8 (or if there
are 30 turrets 30 rolls at USP 1).

I also believe that the \'hit\' in high guard represents the improved chance
of damage by firing multiple laser shots. This may be a better statistical
chance for a hit, or multiple shots hitting.... A barrage will hit a wider
arc and put more energy ablating defenses like sandcasters, thus increasing
the chance of a hit, represented by the USP increase of a 30 laser battery.

I would personally go for the doube battery on the basis that I think it
would achieve more hits. Some people may want to do the math, but I\'m
running on intuition here. The single USP factor is a small diffence 7+ or
6+. Missiles have the same chance of hitting at USP 3 and USP4 (5+)....


Opening another can of worms, did you work in relative agility (and
emergency agility ) in your calc? It does effect the hit probability / to
roll value according to TCS.

No - canon is the structure within which the OTU is created and fleshed

No - I want the Traveller universe to remain consistent internally. I don\'t
want the great big universe shifting messes that things like TNE generated
with:

\'Thruster Plates are unrealistic so everything uses HePLAR and T plates are
forbidden\'
And jump drives and meson guns are realistic?

\'Lets handwave laser weapons with a grav pulse to fix them and at the same
time drop fusion/plasma weapons because they aren\'t realistic\'....
And the grav pulse handwave is...?

I want to play Traveller - for realistic Sci-Fi I sometimes play 2300.
Traveller *fundamentally* isn\'t a realistic 57th Century game. We *can\'t
predict* the future. So I object to people saying this and that isn\'t
realistic under todays\' knowledge. Yes, let\'s smooth it over if we can but
you aren\'t playing \'Traveller\' the setting if you assume that all modern
Sci-Fi is more appropriate. Fine - use the Traveller rules for your game,
but that is not the setting we know and love.

Canon is contradictory (by the very nature of multiple authors etc) but
needs to be homogenised as much as possible to make it work.

This isn\'t a rant at TNE - it is just the easiest rule set to point the
finger at for changing fundamentals of the background.

"sdm Inc. announces diversification programme:

Following the recent changes in military procurement procedures from the
HG5.2 specification to QSDS/SSDS regulations, Starlane Drive Manufacturers
has announced a diversification programme that seeks to build on existing
areas of expertise. The drive design subdivision has been combined with a
local Diasporan design house, Lavondyss Associates, in a joint stock
arrangement.

The arrangement will combine the best of military drive technologies to the
naval architectural requirements of the commercial sector. A spokesman for
the company stated that "Although this merger moves Starlane into the
commercial sector, away from a dependency on military contracts, the
company does not rule out bidding for Naval contracts."

The company has denied any intentions to join the Imperial Ship Builders
Association (ISBA). A speaker for the company stated that "the ISBA is an
incestuous relationship between the manufacturers of the new Imperium and
the Throne. It is part of the ongoing attempts of the Imperium to
economically support its expansionist policies. The relevance of the ISBA
to this region is negligible - links with the Old Earth Union are much more
important."

<End Transmission>

130 -0030 Suffren, Diaspora.

In a surprise move, sdm Inc announced the immediate availability of a new
system defense boat, specifically designed to be incorporated in layered
defense of Jovian bodies within the systems. The system is a fusion of
Class 2 standard commercial equipment with state of the art military
hardware to the HG5.2 specification. Due to modifications to production
facilities, the vessel is also available in a variant which supports the
Imperial QSDS/SSDS standard. When asked how this new class of ship affected
the commercial diversification programme announced almost two months
previously, the company\'s representative stated that the design was a
\'response to the requests of systems further coreward\' and that the
diversification programme would continue.

Pirana Class System Defense Boat  Mk1: Type SDB(M)

High Guard  Specification:

SDB(M) - 23033D1-000000-00009-0	200dt		MCr115.132		TL12

Passengers=0, Low berths=0, Emergency Low Berths=1, EP=6, Agility=2,
No vehicles or Ships Troops. Fuel Purification Plant, Fuel=30dt, Magazine
containing 500 Missiles (10 Battery rounds, 1 extra in bay, single battery
round (nuclear) costs 7.5MCr), approx 0.3dt cargo,Crew =4 (pilot, engineer,
gunner/medic, gunner), 4 large staterooms.
Architects fee = 1.152 MCr.
Design notes: The ship utilises a standard streamlined hull straight out of
CT Book 2, which limits the space available to drives to 15dt. The drives
selected are standard civilian units, and the most noticeable weakness is
the large volume of power plant fuel required compared to military systems.
Military drives would require a fifth of the volume dedicated in the
design. This has important military ramifications (it would permit the hull
to be armoured, for a start).

There are two areas of dubious interpretation of the CT rules in this
design. The first is the use of a 100dt bay in a sub-1000 dt hull. However,
the MT supplement COACC uses a similar missile bay in the Guardian Class
orbital satelite, so I have assumed this is legal in CT Book 5. The other
area is the installation of a fuel purification plant - this has had a
negligible effect on the cost, but has consumed a further 6dt. Book 2 is
unclear as to whether streamlining includes the ability to process fuel to
a refined state. As the drives are standard civilian units, I have
installed a HG purification plant to ensure operation. I have assumed that
the configuration is a cylinder as there is no price modifier in the HG
rules for this configuration.

The Pirana is designed to operate in packs, striking from deep within a gas
giant, co-ordinated with orbital sensor platforms and other defenders. The
weapons system is cheap in terms of power and cost, but of limited
duration. It is likely that Starlane will upgrade the ship to a full
military specification soon to boost performance and sales. However, the
design at present is quick to manufacture and uses primarily civilian
components.

T4 Specification (converted with Rob Flammang\'s excellent system v2):

Tons: 200 Cylinder/SL	Volume: 2800		Cost 115.132

The belt armour on the Bismarck was 12.6" which was not as good as
either of the British Ships, at that range the 14" on PoW should also
penetrate Bismarck\'s belt as well.

If it was a 15" that finished Hood, then I believe that it probably

Since no-one is taking me up on the "structured discussion" idea, I\'m going
to kick off one of my own. ;-)

- ----
CANON PROBLEM 3: The Kinunir Question

PROBLEM: How do we reconcile the differences in canon over the Kinunir? The
problem appears to be one of irreconcilable dates.

REF 3.1: _Adventure 1: The Kinunir_ states that the ship was lost in 1097
(from memory).
REF 3.2: _The Regency Sourcebook_ and now _Behind The Claw_ (the latter
presumably quoting the former) state that the ship was discovered at
Shionthy in 1105. The other ships of the class were then "fixed" (they
talked to the AI computers with a very large hammer ;-).
REF 3.3: The RSB and BTC also say that Norris obtained his Warrant from the
ship, and this appears to have occurred sometime in 1108.
REF 3.4: _Digest 9: Before the Iridium Throne_ says that Norris made his
plea to Strephon at the same time that the four "Grand Tourers" were at
Capital - that is, around 1104-5 (again from memory).
REF 3.5: In _Survival Margin_, while forging his Archducal patent, Norris
mentions that he had "done this before" with his 5FW Warrant.

POINT 3.1: I will re-check the dates tonight, so if I have mis-remembered
please just pat me on the head and tell me so.
POINT 3.2: If the Kinunir was lost before 1100, and Norris didn\'t even ask
Strephon for a Warrant until 1105, there is NO WAY that the Kinunir could
have been the ship that was delivering the Warrant.
POINT 3.3: The SM quote could be interpreted differently; that is, Norris
meant that he received the Warrant and *then* acted.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION 3.1: The references to the "Kinunir" as the ship that had
Norris\' Warrant on it are false. This was done in order to cover up the
truth, that he was unable to wait for word back from Strephon, and actually
forged his Warrant. The real thing came later, allowing him to justify his
actions, and then he had to create a cover story.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION 3.2: Norris did go off and retrieve his Warrant, but from
some other Red Zone. It was done in secret because Santanocheev had banned
all contact with Red Zone worlds in the Marches.
     PROBLEMS WITH 3.2: This sounds like a bad band-aid fix.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION 3.3: Solution 3.1 is correct, but Norris didn\'t forge the
Warrant, he had found it a few years before when he discovered the Kinunir
and hid it in his footlocker. ;-) I mean, kept it safe "just in case".
Plausible, since BTC says he was tooling around with the fleets in the
"Inthe Pocket", near Shionthy.

A 30-m target at 4 lightseconds is 2.5x10^-8 radians in size (1 millionth
of a degree for the old-fashioned among us, 0.005 arcseconds for the
astronomers.) 

Current military systems (which are probably a lot better than 1%) aren\'t
relevant here; we\'re not trying to aim Big Honking Hunks of Metal (good name for
an all-robot band...) but teeny-weeny little photons (a *lot* of teeny-weeny
photons, admittedly.) You do that by steering mirrors - in particular, by
aiming the main mirror of your laser (which looks like a big telescope) in
the right general direction (to within a few arcseconds) and doing fine
precision pointing with a smaller steering mirror. You control the smaller
steering mirror with a closed-loop system with a sensor looking "out" along
the same light path the laser will take. Such a closed-loop system 
using current technology (like the adaptive optics/tip-tilt system being
built for the Keck telescope) can hold a star still - even in the face of
the rapid, random jitter caused by the atmosphere - to within a few
thousandths of an arcsecond - which meets our requirements. All you have to 
do is boresight your laser with respect to the little sensor - not that 
hard to do - and your laser beam will always hit what the sensor is locked on.
(This is how (according to Aviation Week) the USAF\'s YAL-1, likely to be the
first operational laser weapon system, will work.)

Subtlties include issues of what to do with targets too dim for the boresight
sensor (offset from a nearby star) and what to do to correct for the 
constant velocity of the target - to do that you need a very precise range
to the target, whcih probably requires lighting it up with active sensors. 
(Or comparing observations from two ships to triangulate the target.) 
These are subtlties; basically, laser control systems can be made precise
enough even with modern technology to hit targets at million-km ranges.
This is Bruce\'s First Rule of space combat: Lasers Never Miss.
(Modifierd by the Second Rule: "...unless the target gets out of the way.")
A real hostile target will be devoting some effort to jinking and evading,
varying its velocity enough that -a syou point out - in the eight seconds
of delay there-and-back-again it won\'t be where the constant-velocity
assumption predicted. Evasion is very crucial to space combat. 
It does make life tough for people trying to hide - if you\'ve shut down your
power plant to avoid thermal signatures, you can\'t evade, and the first hint
you have that someone has detected you will be a LIDAR lighting up your hull
(if you\'re lucky) followed by a laser salvo.

This is also why impact or nuke missiles are of limited use. Evasion is more
useful the furhter away you are - at a thousand km, even a missile that
is dodging at 100 G can\'t get out of the way fast enough; a laser can take
down such missiles as fast as it can fire.

OK, I\'ve already mentioned I don\'t own a copy of T4 or TNE.  This means I don\'t have or use FFS.  So, I gotta ask about your point defense lasers a bit.

Are you using the stock ruleset or a variant?  I see a bit of \'we start with the rules and add this other stuff to them\' here...  If it\'s under the stock rules, I can see where what you say has relevance.  If it\'s a rules variant, I can\'t see it at all as it\'s just another way of making sure your ship combats are as lethal as possible.  But hey, that\'s *your* TU.  If you\'re using point defense accuracy from TML archives, then you\'re running a variant ruleset not availiable to anyone with no net access.  To them, the variant doesn\'t exist.

Second off, if you\'re going to use Real World Extrapolations, how do you defend against a stealth bomber, or a stealth fighter?  And in the above mentioned superlaser, what happens if your target *also* has that superlaser system?  Hey, if *you\'ve* got it, somebody else does too.

Generally, Piracy is much less than this.  Piracy isn\'t much more than
robbery on the high seas (or high space), in essence.  It was a
catch-all term for crimes in international waters, in which no state
can exercise its territorial jurisdiction to define and punish crime.

"The acts of robbery and depradation upon the high seas, which,
if committed on land, would have amounted to a felony.  Brigandage
committed on the sea or from the sea."  - Black\'s Law Dictionary.

In the US, this carries a penalty of life imprisonment.

IOW, armed robbery at sea = piracy.

A later refinement is "air piracy."
- -"Any seizure or exercise of of control, by force or violence or threat of
force or violence and with wrongful intent, of any aircraft in flight in air
commerce."  Title 49, United States Code Section 1472(i).

This one seems most applicable to the Traveller Universe, given the
Imperium\'s jurisdiction over interstellar commerce and things that
effect it.

For comparison:
Hijacking: "Robbery of goods while in transit, commonly from trucks.
May involve robbery of only goods, or of both vehicle and goods.
May also refer to commandeering an airplane." - Blacks Law Dictionary.

I buy this if they come up, fire a shot over the bow, and you give
up. If they capture you by shooting at you until your ship is dead
in the water then they have probably killed somebody anyway, and if
they didn\'t it was sheer luck (since any weapon that can cripple a
ship will certainly kill people).

As I understand it, piracy rarely took the form that it would have
to in traveller--that is you *must* disable the target by force.

besides, the legal definition of piracy only includes taking the
ship, etc. There is no reason you wouldn\'t also charge the pirates
with murder if they killed anybody while commiting this other
(lesser) crime. Or attempted murder, or assault. All in addition to
"piracy."

Umm, Keven, rapid fire point defense lasers have been around since Striker.
Point defense lasers hitting multiple targets can be extrapolated from HG,
because a single laser can sometimes stop an attack by multiple missile
turrets.

Well, things either start to get solidly built, or rely on getting the

Thanks, Seth, for a clear, well-rounded discussion outlining the basis of

Law level 1 when wandering around, but this doesn\'t apply to what\'s inside

  The authorities need some kind of ability to use their judgement,
otherwise they just encourage the more extreme sorts of loonie. OC,
with nobles holding various offices in the appeal chain (at least,
and probably in the MoJ prosecution process) then not only will the
pirates who didn\'t do much have a real hope of being treated fairly,
but cracking cases (and conspiracies) will be made easier by offering
deals to flunkies who want to get on with their lives.

It was lost in 1088.  As of 001-1105, it haddn\'t been found, according to Adv 
1.  The adventure seed was meant to allow PC\'s to do the actual finding, so 
the \'found\' date may vary if the adventure was used.  Otherwise, quien sabe?

I don\'t have these.

The Rebellion started in 1116.  I don\'t remember the dates of the 5FW off the 
top of my head, but methinks it\'s possible for the Kununir to get to Depot and 
back at least.

I was under the impression that Norris and Strephon never met in person.

He mentioned that he *USED* the warrant \'that Strephon gave me\' to remove 
Santanochev for gross misconduct in the 5FW.  He didn\'t say he *forged* it.

I can\'t remember when Norris was supposed to get the warrant delivered into 
his hand.  I *do* know he had it when he took over command for the 5FW.

> POINT 3.3: The SM quote could be interpreted differently; that is, Norris

I take it that he had the warrant in time to finish the 5FW.  Date is a bit 
fuzzy for me.

On Pg 22, the Captain\'s Cabin of the Kununir is noted to have an envelope with 
a signed Imperial Warrant in it.  This Warrant *could* be Norris\' and not 
delivered 17 years late.  The book doesn\'t specify who it\'s made out for.  
IIRC, I don\'t think Norris was even in power in 1088.

Very.

It\'s concievable, I guess, if you roll a natural 2 on 2D6, or you allowed DM\'s 
for Pilot, Nav, and Engineering skills.  Otherwise, the stock +10 to the roll 
comes into play and they misjump on 13+.  Between me thee & the door post, I 
would NOT wanna try *that*.

One of my players tried doing that in the game I was running about 16 years 
ago.  She didn\'t make the roll.  When they landed the ship again on the same 
planet they tried escaping from, they found out why they had to do a dead 
stick landing with no power.  Seems when they checked the power plant & Jump 
drive, all they found was open space.  All the various connectors were severed 
in a sphere, as was portions of the ship.  The edges were mirror-smooth.  
Finally, I broke down and told them that their jump drive and power plant were 
heading toward the edge of the Universe on a one-way trip.

My point was to make people think about where Traveller is, where it\'s been
and where it will end up heading to. Nothing more, nothing less :-)

With all honesty, I don\'t think that whoever first inserted Battle Dress (ie
Powered Armor) into Traveller thought about the implications or how much
sense it made. It was something that sci-fi fans of the time (familiar with
Starship Troopers) expected to be in there, so it was in there, just like
elves and wizards in D&D.

The Third Imperium seems to be deeply rooted in Asimov\'s "Foundation"
series. Somehow I don\'t think anybody _really_ thought about it too much, it
was just a good 60s/70s sci-fi background.

Where to start on getting the info? Does one write, hoping to not step on
anyone\'s  toes, and then seek approval? Or should someone get all Traveller
canon materials first and then write?

With all honesty, I\'ve found very little virgin territory. Most places

If many people play with certain variations anyway, then everything still
has to be tinkered with in order for them to use something, canon or not.

TNE\'s "Fire, Fusion and Steel" was a step in that direction. Despite its
flaws, it was a wonderful attempt. In reality it was a return to the
Traveller of old, before it was tied to a rigid and structured background.

Largely true. It could be argued I\'m doing that right now.

It seems like everyone already has one or more "variants" running at any
given point. It could be argued that\'s the way already.

Pardon me if I\'m reading incorrectly, but what you\'re saying then is that
canon really isn\'t that important? Or maybe there\'s a level of canon at
which discrepencies aren\'t important?

One of the "major products". What then _are_ the major products? There are
very few Traveller products still in print.

Where to draw the line on bothering to figure it out? I make an attempt to
buy Traveller stuff when I come across it at a reasonable price. Should I
make an open invitation to ask everyone to send me all of their canon
information? Is that reasonable to ask? It doesn\'t seem that way. If, like
me, the Traveller bug bit late I\'m completely out of luck on all fronts.

Many bits of canon are already self-contradicting. To many people, a
majority of the Traveller universe is very, very unlikely.

That\'s just it, of course. A consistent universe means if one part is "very,
very unlikely" then the whole thing goes down in flames.

If Traveller can\'t adapt to meet modern day science fiction then there will
be no new fans, no new blood... and Traveller will become as extinct as the

Not if you\'re postuiating \'one-shot kills\' from orbit to the jump curb.  If 
they can disable me from 1.280 million klicks away, I can do it up close and

You don\'t get it both ways.

I wanna see them justify their defense spending in backwater worlds.  The 
theory that subbies *won\'t* visit backwaters is totally against the purpose 
the subbies were built in the first place.

British citizens were still fairly well armed up to the 1920\'s.  The
government 
moved to disarm them due to fears of socialist uprising.  US civilians shipped
arms to the UK to arm the Home Guard during WWII.

Yup.  Now, what is the tolerance for said laser burst at that range?  Can you 
*aim* that accurately at range?

Remember, in a vacuum, a laser beam shows no flash, so there\'s no *WAY* you 
can tell if you\'ve hit or not unless the target is getting painted.  If the 
target moves as little as 30 meters in a random direction at range, your 
calculations are thrown off and you\'re now shooting blind again.  And in 8.5 
secs from rest, a 3G ship can move 255 meters.  Best spend the money for a 
supercomputer to aim that super laser.

How big is the *emitter* for this big honking laser that\'s cranking out all 
this power out the business end to the grav focus?  And how much does this all 
*cost*?

How bright is a 30 meter metal target at 1.28 million clicks?  Assume flat 
black paint.  You can\'t hit what you can\'t see.

> (Modifierd by the Second Rule: "...unless the target gets out of the way.")

Easy enough at range.  You only have to move 30 meters and at lightspeed lag, 
this translates to 3.529 meters per second, or well under 1/3 G.  Unless you 
declare this can\'t be done using manuvering thrusters...

Should be simple enough with manuvering thrusters.

At a thousand klicks, your lightspeed lag is .0033 secs one way.  We\'ll assume 
that the Laser projects a Beam visible from any angle, which doesn\'t happen in 
the real world as well.  Assuming zero response time, this doubles to .0066, 
as you see the results of your shot, correct, and shoot again.  Now, a missile 
evading at 100G is moving 1000 meters per second minimum.  In that .0066 
seconds, its position from rest changes 6.6 meters.  How bloody big *IS* this 
missile????????

Thanks for the compliment. Frankly; I thought that I would get badly flamed by
both sides of the gun debate, AND by all of the non Americans on the list.

I think that the most important aspect of the post, is that we all respect
differences, and don\'t interfer with how another country legislates its\'
domestic policy. I am a firm believer in the right to carry arms, but as much
as I disagree with Europe\'s and Asia\'s gn policy; I would never interfer with
their choice. I do demand the same of them however... (and all of your
tourist\'s wouldn\'t be able to play with machine guns here while on

Nations. Some UN legislation is seen to smack of anti American sovreignity.

POINT 3.5: Um, I don\'t understand this comment. Norris had the Warrant for

1105, it couldn\'t have travelled anywhere - it was sitting in the Shionthy
Belt all that time.

>I was under the impression that Norris and Strephon never met in person.

REF 3.6: In _Digest 9: Before the Iridium Throne_, Norris made his plea to
Strephon via pseudo-reality hologram. No, they have never met. In the OTU
(ie. MT/TNE) they never ever meet. Will they meet each other in G:T? Only
time (and Loren) will tell...

>  This Warrant *could* be Norris\' and not
>delivered 17 years late.  The book doesn\'t specify who it\'s made out for.
>IIRC, I don\'t think Norris was even in power in 1088.

POINT 3.6: The Warrant in the Kinunir couldn\'t be for Norris. See point
3.5.

REF 3.7: Imperial Warrants do not specify who they are for, except in the
case of "limited power" warrants issued for a specific purpose. They just
say "Assist the bearer with all the power you can bring to bear". See my
Library Data site for an example of such a Warrant.

     FIX TO SOLUTION 3.3: This is looking a likely solution. Add the idea
that Norris expected a reply by 1107, didn\'t get one and so used the
concealed Warrant, and then the real Warrant arrived later. I really will
have to check Digest 9 for the dates!

BTW, glad you realised I meant that Norris hid the WARRANT in his
footlocker, not the ship itself (poor grammatical construction, there! ;-).

Yep. If you are using FFS2, small PAWs (especially circular PAWs) have
similar functionality to plasma and fusion guns under HG - short range
nutcrackers that are sand-resistant.

IMO effective law level in Imperial territory (ie starports) is at His
Magesty\'s Pleasure i.e. it depends on exactly who is running the place. It
could be anything from \'I dont care if that *is* a Marine-surplus Fusion
Gun, just as long as you pay for any damage\' to \'No hawkers, no spitting,
and definitly no brawling\'.

*grin* may I suggest that intrepid mercenaries find some small world and
sign up as their regular army ... that way, the world can \'engage in
legitimate support of their offworld interests\' in exchange for, say, a 15%
cut of the starmerc contract.

No problem. Very long range fire can be dodged easily (d=0.5*a*t^2 and all
that), but if you are dodging, then you arent boarding an at-rest merchant
ship.

Incidentally, it does take a coupld of combat rounds to disable a merchant
ship under HG, especially if it is more than power-1, maneuver-1, jump-1
and has a couple of different weapons systems.

Maize, even the varities available a thousand years ago, would have
improved crop yields a *lot*, but only with a couple of big ifs.  

IF growth of maize by farmers and its consuption became widespread,
and that\'s no sure thing.  Farmers are notoriously conservative when
it comes to crop choices and it\'s unlikely they would have rushed to
plant this strange new plant that was so different from what they
were used to.  Even if the farmers did plant corn, would they..or
villagers..be interested in eating something that looked, cooked and
tasted so different.  

IF the climate in Britain during that period was warm and wet enough
for maize to grow and produce good yeilds.  Maybe I\'m wrong, but
wasn\'t the climate somewhat colder in those days?  Again I could be
wrong, but corn isn\'t really a cold climate crop is it?

Of course, IF it was accepted and could produce reasonable yeilds
then the growth of maize might have freed up a lot of labor for
other purposes.  Just what purposes those would have been and what
effects it would have had on culture I wont\' hazard to guess.

The planetary defenses are a hair larger than would fit in your
600dton pirate. The pirate could fly into the muzzle, probably.

> You don\'t get it both ways.
 
_You\'re_ trying to disable. The planetary defenses will happily
_Kill_ you. You have to pull punches as a pirate or you have 2 bad
problems:

1. No income.

2. A reputation as a needless killer--this will get the navy to not
wait around with SDBs, but to actively hunt you--and the crappy
destryers they can afford to send out will toast you in a heartbeat
:-)

It is a much different kind of combat to try and disable/disarm
without risking a kill. Large spinal weapons, or concentrated
turret weapons will kill a 600dton pirate in most combat systems.

Remember that a 600dton ship is virtually small craft to real naval
ships. BTW, the 400dton SDB is a cool ship (I\'ve always loved the
look of them), but "real" SDBs need to be big enough to be useful
units in a naval engagement (on _some_ level). To be useful, you
either need hundreds and hundreds of them (there is little
difference in naval terms between a 400dt SDB and a heavy fighter,
really) or they need to be bigger units. Either way pirates suffer
(patrol is easy if 10% of your SDBs patrol the 100d limit and that
is 100 ships).

My Striker ruleset is in a Striker box (with GDW on the side) under
my black box of LBBs. It has vehicle mounted lasers (and even
mentions grounded ships doesn\'t it?) hosing down hundreds of arty
rounds per turn.

Huh? the stealt fighter, or the sandcaster. The latter is in all the
rules, I bet you can make a stealth under Striker, and certainly
FFS.

I read someplace that the Law Level of the 3I was administered as if it were 
LL4.  I have no clue where I read this though, but it was within the last day 
or 2.

IMTU, it\'s pretty much the same, with enforcement variable with the owners of 
the port.  LL4 would tend to show, no military gear in the hands of civilians. 
 In my old game, there were a few times where the party was approached by the 
port authorities who looked at them and said "Got an end user certificate for 
that?"

I nevewr knew you needed a pilot to lead a boarding party.  I\'d always assumed 
the boarding party could just hop out the air lock on their pirate ship and 
use their suit thrusters to approach and board.  And while they\'re boarding, 
why can\'t the pirate *ship* be dodging?

Then you switch rulesets to FFS and take out the pirate with 1 shot from a Rabid Armoured Beachball From Hell?

Besides, all you need to do is render the target incapable of running and incapable of fighting you in space.  That means, you take down the weapons and either the M-drives *OR* the power plant.  If you get lucky and get the power plant, the ship can\'t jump until it\'s field repaired.

You haven\'t been on the bridge of a ship yet either. ;->

I don\'t think my technology is all that different from standard
Traveller and even where it is the effects are pretty much the same.

I use stutterwarp for slower than light travel, there are no
tplates, and for FTL, jump is still the only method.  Depending on
TL, and how much money a shipbuilder wants to put into things, a
ship\'s pseudo velocity can get up to a couple percent of c.  That\'s
fast, but ships routinely have to cover one to two hundred million
km to get out to and in from jump points so they need the speed.
Sensor ranges are relatively short due to lower power requirements
and the non-reaction nature of movement.  Combat ranges are
relatively short as well especially *effective* ranges (it\'s hard to
hit a stuttering ship).

Computers are large and power hungry in keeping with traditional
Traveller.  Rather than just saying they *are* because some book
said they are, I came up with a reason.  I postulate that gravity
based devices (the foundation of virtually all the advanced tech)
play merry heck with micro-electronics.  Cultures have a
choice..they can have advanced micro-electronics *or* gravity
control, they can\'t have both.  Just about everybody opts for gravity
control.  The practical effect is that devices are larger, heavier,
need more power, require increased shielding, have shorter MTBF, and
costs are higher, but that matches CT.  Nanotech would be barely
possible, but hasn\'t been made to work...as for as the PC\'s know
anyway.

I won\'t go on, but that\'s the sort of technological differences I\'m
using.  The details might be different, but not as much as some
folks seem to think.

Oh, it\'s more complicated than that.  ;-> I use bits and pieces from
all the versions of Traveller as well as a number of ideas from
FUDGE and GURPS.  I *do* use a d20 in task resolution, though, so
maybe that\'s where Keven gets the "TNE with some house rules."

Engineers and gunners are the maintenance crew and do minor repairs.
Stewards have to take care of passengers.
others take advantage of every mistake I have made in allowing them to
buy training equipment (out of date military training manuals, civilian
training programs, etc.), gambling, drinking (I would not let these
players fly me anywhere)

  Stealth aircraft are detectable, just harder. It\'s fairly similar to the

ships light themselves by applying thrust, modern aircraft (IIRC?) are more
likely to tip themselves by going offensive.

  In the same way that big lasers or PAWS are powerful, they\'re simply part

It has to match courses, thruster packs aren\'t gonna kill 10s of
km/s relative velocity--but a stripped down small craft might be the
order of the day for pirates.

the prate ship needs to be spending whole gs of accelration on
dodging to really be effective (less the farther away it is from the
shooter, obviously).

the problem seems to be that you either fire weapons with USPs that
won\'t critical the target (too many of them reduce your chances of
getting away with the prize, or of having one) and then it\'ll take a
few turns to hit all the right systems (to be fair the pirate
shouldn\'t know any of the damage results other than by watching to
see if the target maneuvers or returns fire, BTW). Otherwise you use
a big battery and take yer chances blowing the thing up. Again, you
start looking like a raider, and the navy gets amazingly pissed.

Playing practical jokes on each other

Roller-blading the corridors

Grav-surfing the corridors

(What you do is get the life suport computer programmed to
 create "waves" of gravity changes down the corridors with
 the grav-plates.)

Assaulting the engine room.
(gives the Marine\'s practice in defending it.)

Practicing and training your psionics
( just like Luke on the Decade Duck )

Chatting up passengers/crew so you can get laid.

Playing "Killer"

Stripping and rebuilding every single piece of equipment
that isn\'t currently being used. Especially if you\'ve
got fighters or grav tanks on board.

Watching "the Young & the Restless"

going slowly crazy, until somene snaps and murders all the rest
in their sleep.....

Yes you have, if you\'re monitoring the \'main party\' posts.  The _Venture_
is stutterwarping out from Kurzu to the jump point, and I\'d guess the
vessel you were on was a stutterwarper too; we don\'t mention it anymore
after more than a year of playing in Eris\'s weird yet wonderful TU.  And
yes, he has *both* stutterwarp for in-system work *and* more or less
Traveller-canonical jump drive.

One, we were specifically talking about a target that wasn\'t
evading. That means it isn\'t using any thrust. Two, your PC is a
supercomputer by CT standards, even at TL15 :-)

You could point the laser now, with a PC. predicting where a
drifting target will be in 8.5 seconds in a vaccuum could be done on
my HP calculator.

The simple solution in cases where the target is evading (by
definition not docking, so we needn\'t worry about hitting the
trader) is to raster your beam across the sky. If you can put enough
shots into a given area there is a *chance* you will hit. It turns
out that (I\'ll dig up the math, I actually did it and made a table)
it is so hard to miss out to a few light seconds (even assuming a 6g
evading target that doesn\'t evade at all in the laser-target
direction) that you could drop weapon ROF way way down from TNE
levels and always get 1 hit per turn.

  Theoretically then, fighters could come under the "military starship
sensor" heading, and SDB\'s must. To avoid munchkinism it might be best
to restrict B:2 era light fighters to "ordinary" sensors, and restrict
the best gear to small craft with bridges. Thus a 95 Dt "Slavering
Hamster" gunship with a MCr 0.475 mil-spec bridge would get the two LS
coverage while smaller units mostly wouldn\'t.

  MT required adding specific sensors during ship construction - how
would converting B:2/HG computer levels to sensor steps/mods work (and
a negative DM for lack of a bridge or dedicated sensor op) work?

    'body' => '1. Disorders of Temperature Regulation
Overview
Internal temperature is tightly controlled in humans and other
warm-blooded
animals by a series of feedback loops.
Sensors : warm and cold receptors in the skin, blood vessels and gut
(sparsely distributed in the last two).
Control centre : the anterior hypothalamus at the base of the brain in
humans.
Effectors : nerves to sweat glands, muscle and the higher centres of the

brain.(Sweating, shivering and moving around are good ways to modulate
temperature).

Normal core temperature is 37 +/- 0.5 degrees C (98.6 +/- 0.9 F).
The \'core\' is defined as the metabolically active organs (heart, lungs,
liver, kidneys, brain and the blood).

This may be increased by up to four degrees C with maximal exercise (eg.

marathon runners).

Metabolic rate : a specific activity scale
The physical activity ratio (PAR) is a way of expressing the energy cost
of
an activity in terms of basal metabolic rate.

PAR      Activity
1.0-1.4  Reading, writing, eating, standing at rest
1.5-1.8  General office work, washing dishes, ironing
1.9-2.4  Dusting, cooking.
2.5-3.3  Walking at 3-4km/h (1.9-2.5 miles/h), vacuum cleaning,
         making beds, operating machine tools, painting and
         decorating.
3.4-4.4  Walking at 4-6km/h (2.5-3.7 miles/h), gardening, window
         cleaning, mopping the floor, sailing, golf, bricklaying,
         carpentry, motor vehicle repairs.
4.5-5.9  Walking at 6-7km/h (3.7-4.4 miles/h), dancing, slow
         cycling, swimming, chopping wood or felling trees,
         labouring, hoeing, road construction.
6.0-7.9  Walking uphill with load or cross country ; climbing
         stairs, average jogging, cycling, football, energetic
         swimming, tennis, downhill skiing.
8.0+     Marathon running, biathlon, cross-country skiing.

At extremes of temperature, or in situations where the normal
compensatory
mechanisms can\'t work, serious injury can occur.

*Hypothermia : an abnormally low core temperature.
Severity Temp, C   Temp, F
Mild     32 to 35  89.6 to 95
Moderate 28 to 32  82.4 to 89.6
Severe   < 28      < 82.4

Mild hypothermia is most commonly encountered during general
anaesthesia.
Patients are unconscious and paralysed. Body cavities are open
permitting
evaporation. Theatres are often cooled to keep the surgical team
comfortable.

Controlled hypothermia is used in cardiac and neurosurgery to permit
longer
operating times. Core temperature averages 20 degrees C (68 F) on
cardio-pulmonary bypass.

Uncontrolled hypothermia is usually secondary to exposure, with
complicating
factors of extremes of age or other medical predispositions eg.
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).

Metabolic rate decreases by 6% for every degree fall in core temperature

(compound interest effect).
Unconsciousness occurs at 30 degrees C (86 F)
Muscle rigidity occurs at 25 degrees C (77 F)
Brain activity becomes undetectable at 20 degrees C (68 F)

It is therefore difficult to distinguish between someone who is very
cold
and a corpse.
Resuscitation continues until core temperature is normalised, at which
time
brain death can be confirmed or excluded.

The big problem with moderate to severe hypothermia is that heart muscle

becomes very irritable at low temperature. Death occurs because of
ventricular fibrillation (VF) - a rapid, dis-coordinated movement of the

heart muscle which is ineffective at pumping blood.

VF can be triggered by rough handling (a bumpy ambulance ride or a
sudden
jolt is sufficient).
Standard treatment for VF is DC electric countershock, which attempts to

\'reset\' the heart muscle. It is usually ineffective until core
temperature
exceeds 30 degrees C, however.
CPR is performed until cardio-pulmonary bypass is initiated, or the
victim
warms up enough.

Frostbite or frostnip may arise in extremities whose temperature drops
below
freezing.
At somewhat warmer temperatures immersion in cold water can lead to
similar
injuries from localised shunting of blood away from the cold part (eg.
trench foot).

Management
Mild : gentle external rewarming eg. heated blankets
Moderate : ABC - control airway, ensure breathing, give warmed IV
fluids,
consider internal rewarming (fluid-filled gastric tubes, etc.)
Severe : ABC - as above, internal rewarming advantageous.
Cardio-pulmonary
bypass optimal until gravisonic modulator available.

*Hyperthermia : core temperature greater than 38 C (100.4 F)
Heat production exceeds heat transfer rate.
Evaporation (sweat) and convection are the most effective mechanisms
under
usual circumstances.
Extremes of age or exercise, and some medical conditions are significant

predisposing factors to the development of hyperthermia.

Metabolic rate increases by 6% per degree increase in core temperature.
Cardiac output increases by 3L/min/degree C (normal resting adult value
70mL/kg/min) increase in temperature as heat transfer to the skin is
attempted.
Patients look very flushed and have a rapid, high volume pulse.

The highest reliably recorded core temperature was 44.4 degrees C
(112 F) in a woman who suffered an adverse reaction to a general
anaesthetic
(malignant hyperthermia).

Active organs literally cook themselves.
Brain - confusion -> coma -> seizures
Heart - haemorrhage or muscle death (infarction)
Muscle - dissolves : rhabdomyolysis
Liver - fails : internal haemorrhaging
Kidneys - will fail because of muscle proteins in blood
Blood - activation of clotting factors leads to random clotting with an
overall \'thinning\' of the blood : disseminated intravascular coagulation
or
DIC.

Treatment
Evaporative cooling (allow fluid to evaporate off skin).
Conductive cooling (second line, e.g. cold packs/ice baths)
IV hydration (aggressive)
ABC if unconscious or fitting (+anticonvulsants)
(Antidotes for provocative drugs, if available)

2. Burns
Radiant energy will cause surface damage. Tissue survival is unlikely
beyond
45 degrees C (113 F).

Burn severity depends on : the percentage of body surface area (BSA)
involved, the depth of  involved tissue, and the regions involved.

The "Rule of 9\'s" is used to calculate the %age BSA :-
Head and neck 9%
Anterior trunk     2 X 9 = 18%
Posterior trunk    2 X 9 = 18%
Upper limbs        9 each
Lower limbs        18 each
Genitalia/perineum 1
There are modifications of this rule for infants.

Superficial : (first degree) : skin (the epidermis or superficial layer)

becomes reddish (erythema) and very sensitive. Resolution in two weeks
without scarring is anticipated. Eg. sunburn.

Deep dermis : (second degree) : the dermis, or living layer of the skin,
is
partially involved.
Blistering of the skin is evident on inspection. Pain is common and
often
intense. Resolution over months is common, with scarring usually a
complication associated with infection. Eg. flash injuries.

Full thickness : (third degree) : The skin feels leathery. There is no
sensation as the nerves have been destroyed. Healing is by scarring and
may
take months with or without treatment. Plastic surgery is usually
required.
Eg. from burning clothing or house fire.

Burns of the face and neck are potentially life threatening. The intense

inflammatory response which occurs in response to thermal injury leads
to
gross swelling (oedema) which can cause airway
obstruction.

Inhalation of hot gases can injure the lungs and airway.
People that cough up blood stained or sooty material require close
attention.

Circumferential burns of limbs or trunk are dangerous in that scarring
(eschar) which develops over the days after the burn usually contracts,
embarrassing circulation or breathing.

Management
Burns induce an intense inflammatory reaction as the body attempts to
repair
itself. Metabolic rate can increase to more than eight times its resting

value (equivalent to calisthenics or cross-country skiing!).
Pain when present is intense.

Immediate Action
Remove patient and rescuer from dangerous situation, if possible.
Cool burned areas with water, give pain relief.

Determine areas involved as per trauma rules.
Use rule of 9\'s above to estimate %BSA.

Superficial and Minor : superficial burns
Major : deep dermis
Destroyed : full thickness

A : Airway - may need to create a surgical airway in those with severe
face and neck burns.
(Major+ damage, unconscious, failed catastrophe check)
B : High flow oxygen is mandatory. Ventilation is sometimes required,
especially with airway burns. (Major+ face or neck damage)
C : Aggressive fluid resuscitation is required for burns greater then
15-20%
BSA (up to 10L on day of burn IV). Burned surfaces rapidly lose fluid.
Fluid
requirements are greatly increased anyway because of metabolic rate.
Regimens vary from centre to centre. Large amounts of salt containing
fluid
IV is the first line treatment.

Definitive Treatment
Severe (>20% BSA), circumferential limb, hand, face and neck burns are
best
managed in specialised units.
Critically ill patients can be stabilised in ICU and transferred.

Generally, the inflammatory response begins to settle after 3 to 4 days.

Hydration requirements decrease (day 1,2 and 3 post burn roughly half
that
of initial day -> back to normal).

Infection is the major problem at this stage. Aggressive antibiotic
treatment combined with surgery to remove dead tissue is often required.

Plastic surgery and skin grafting
Skin substitutes : skin banks TL 7+, synthetics TL 7+, pseudobio TL 12+
Dressings        donor (living, dead, or another animal eg. pig)
                 synthetic material plus growth factors
Epidermal substitutes  }
Dermal substitutes     } grafts, cultured tissue, pseudobiological
Bilayer substitutes    } materials

Treatment task, progress and aftercare as per Trauma rules.

3. Electric Currents
Key variables : amount of current, duration, tissues traversed by
current
arc
Current       Source            Effects
10-100microA  Earth leakage     Microshock
30-400microA  Faulty equipment  Tingling (harmless)
> 1 mA              "           Pain (withdraw)
> 10 mA             "           Tetany (can\'t let go)
> 100 mA            "           Macroshock (VF)
> 1 A               "           Burns and tissue damage
> 1000A       High-tension line Severe burns, limb loss
> 12000A      Lightning         Coma, severe burns, limb loss

Microshock occurs when there is a small current leak which travels along
a
direct path to the heart eg. pacing wires or through IV lines. VF can
result.
Tetany refers to current induced muscle spasm. Alternating current is
much better than direct current at inducing this (automatic over 20-30
cycles per second. Domestic mains usually 50 Hz).
Burns occur at entry and exit points of current arc. Currents can also
be
induced in carried metal objects (tools, keys, cigarette lighters,
coins,
etc.) leading to distant burns.
Limb loss can arise from sustained muscle contraction (can shear muscle
from
bone, or cause fractures), congealing of blood and solid tissues or
calcining of bone (turns to ash).

**Rules :-
Laser weapons produce point burns. They can ignite clothing. Rigid
armours
are usually ceramic or metallic and will not burn, they will just have
holes
punched in them!
Plasma weapons act like a combination of fire and lightning. Damage dice
can
be divided up at the referee\'s discretion.

Current level     Damage
> 1mA             one point (stun) per ten seconds in circuit
> 10mA            one point per second in circuit
> 100mA           VF (if consciousness check fails, else 2D stun
                  and knocked down/back)
> 1A              as above + 2D burn damage
> 1000A           VF chance + 4D burn damage
> 10000A          VF chance + 6D burn damage.
                  Automatically unconscious

Microshock : catastrophe check when IV lines in place. VF on
Spectacular Failure.

  },
  {
    'body' => 'Radiation
Nuclear transformations and some electronic rearrangements can
yield highly energetic particles and photons.
Colloquially these are called \'radiation\'.

The damaging effects produced by radiation arise from molecular
disruption (direct effect) and energy transfer leading to the
production of charged species called free radicals (indirect
effect) which can bind to other molecules, impairing their
function.

There are dose-dependent (nonstochastic) effects which are an
inevitable consequence of a given dose, eg. skin burns.
Stochastic effects are those whose probability of occurrence is
related to dose, eg. leukaemia or thyroid cancer.

Dosage is the amount of energy absorbed per unit mass.
It is measured in rads (radiation absorbed dose) :
1 rad = 0.01J/kg
or grays (Gy) : 1 gray = 1J/kg

Biological effect is related to the amount of energy and the way in
which it is transferred along the trajectory of the particle
or photon.

Dose equivalent = absorbed dose X quality factor

The units of dose equivalent are the rem (one rad of radiation with
a quality factor of one) and the sievert (Sv - one gray of
radiation with a quality factor of one).

Radiation type        Quality factor  Comments
X-rays and gamma rays    1            High-energy photons
beta particles           1            Energy > 0.03MeV
                         1.7                 < 0.03MeV
alpha particles          10           helium nuclei
neutrons                 2            Energy to 1keV
                         2.5                 to 10keV
                         7.5                 to 100keV
                         11             500keV to 1MeV
                         10           Energy not specified

Alpha particles have 2 protons and two neutrons. They are therefore
quite large (large damage potential) and have poor penetrative
ability.
Beta particles are electrons or positrons. The slower they are the
more damage they can cause (more chance to form free radicals or
gamma rays in tissue).
Neutrons are uncharged and therefore have good penetrative ability.
Their damage potential is high because of this and their size.

The electron volt is an energy unit. An electron which moves across
a potential difference of one volt has a kinetic energy of one
electron volt. It is equal to 1.6 X 10^(-19)J.

Radiation Sources
We are continually bathed in low-level radiation. The discovery of
nuclear energy and electronics adds several new sources to the
mix.

i. Natural
There are two sources in this category, cosmic rays and terrestrial
radiation (originating from radioactive material in the planet and
in our bodies).

The origin of cosmic radiation is still not yet understood.
There is a background throughout known space of high energy protons
(~87%), alpha particles (~11%) and other nuclei and electrons.
Energy levels range between 10^8 and 10^20 eV, with the majority
between 10^8 and 10^11eV.
Baseline 2.7 rem per year (unprotected) - range 27 mrem to 7.3 rems
per year. (mrem = millirem or 1/1000 rem)
Radiation belts, particularly around gas giants, can have levels
up to a *thousand times* greater than this.

Standard atmospheres absorb most of the incident cosmic radiation.
Secondary particles are generated (neutrons, photons and pions).
The radiation flux varies with altitude and latitude.
At \'sea level\' (1 atmosphere pressure) :- 27 mrem per year.
This doubles with every 1600m increment in altitude.
Near the magnetic poles of a world, the exposure rate varies with
the strength of the local field.

Terrestrial radiation
Of the elements found on or in a given world, about a fifth are
radioactive.
Heavy core worlds usually have larger concentrations of
radioactives than are the average.
Gamma rays account for nearly all terrestrial radiation.
The range varies from 15 to 200mrem per year, depending on local
conditions.

Internal radioactivity arises from potassium 40 (which comprises
0.0118% of body potassium - some 0.0157g in a 70kg human), and
ingested environmental nuclides such as carbon 14 and radon 222.
The typical exposure is 28mrem per year.

ii. Artificial
Medical exposures : 3-300mrem per year
Building materials : 7mrem per year (brick and masonry)
Power plants : plant workers 400mrem per year
Air and space travel : 3 (passengers) to 400 (crew) mrem per year
Television and cathode-ray displays : 0.2 to 1.5mrem per year.

Occupational exposures should not exceed 400mrem per year.

For character generation :-
Base 100mrem per year (200 if heavy core world, 50 if icy body)
and 400mrem per year of service in any spacefaring or nuclear energy
related field. Exposure cannot be \'rolled back\' by conventional
means (but see below).

Weapons
Roughly 15% of the energy of a detonating nuclear weapon is high
energy radiation. \'Enhanced radiation weapons\' or neutron bombs are
designed to increase this fraction to nearly 50%.
This refers to detonations within an atmosphere ; in space, 90% of
the explosion\'s energy is dissipated in this manner.
Particle and meson beams also produce significant radiation effects
at their points of impact. Almost all of a meson beam\'s energy is
converted to gamma radiation when the mesons decay.

Exposure :
Nuclear weapons (instantaneous)
Total destruction radius (obliteration) : 6000rems
Primary destruction radius
(unreinforced buildings flattened) : 600rems
Secondary destruction radius (flash) : 60rems
Multiply by 3 for neutron weapon OR
Multiply by 6 for detonation in space

Weapons fallout : 1 rem per day (within blast area).
Induced radiation : (blast rems/20) per day for each zone above.
The half life for fallout is two hours.
The half life for induced radiation is one year.
Fallout activity is about half the radiation load of a
conventional nuke, 1/10 that of a neutron bomb.

Tables have been listed in FF&S(1 and 2?), Striker and JTAS 23 for
blast radii with yield.

Particle and meson weapons (instantaneous)
C-PAW or N-PAW : (10 X intensity)rems
meson gun : (intensity)rems

Radioactive material, power plants
Shielding failure
fission plant : (power output in MW)/10 rems per minute
fusion plant  : (power output in MW)/5 rems per minute
High level waste/material : 1-10 rems per hour
Medium level : 0.1 rem per hour
Low level : 1 mrem per hour

The values above assume that you\'re standing right next to the
source, unshielded.

High level : highly enriched fuel or weapons grade material.
Medium level : reactor grade fuel, \'tailings\' from reprocessing
plant, activated materials from within reactor vessel (eg. old
shielding, coolant).
Low level : reactor or mine worker\'s protective clothing. Ores.

Protection
Distance and shielding are the primary protection methods after
exposure minimisation.
Radiation intensity falls with the square of distance from the
source. (1/4 at 2m, 1/9 at 3m, etc..)

Shielding
Efficacy depends on material and its thickness.
The table below shows the thickness of material required to
reduce the intensity of gamma radiation by 50%.
Alpha particles travel 5-7cm in air, betas 2-8m.
Fast neutrons (energy > 500keV ) may have more penetration than
gamma rays.

Composites or plastics containing elements with good neutron
capture or absorption properties eg. boron, cadmium, silver,
indium, graphite, beryllium, and hydrogen will have better values
than plain composite laminate.
Alloys containing depleted uranium and similar heavy atoms will be
at a penalty due to induced radiation (eg. neutrons may cause
fission).
Crystaliron, superdense materials and electropolymorphic plastics
may have an extra advantage in protecting from cosmic radiation,
due to the presence of the stabilising current, or its magnetic
properties (crystaliron hulls are effectively a single magnetic
domain). A protective belt of charged particles may form around the
ship.

Radiation Effects
Whole body exposures are the most problematic. Doses which would be
lethal if applied to the entire body are routinely used in
radiotherapy.

Radiation most readily damages dividing cells. Those tissues which
turn over rapidly are the most radiosensitive eg. bone marrow,
gonads, gut lining, cornea of the eye, and skin.

Acute dose (rems) Probable effect on population
5 to 70           Headache, nausea and vomiting
                  for 6-12 hours in 10%.
70 to 150         Nausea and vomiting for 2-20 hours in 30%
150 to 300        Nausea, vomiting and fatigue in 20-70%,
                  onset 2 hrs to 2 days after exposure.
                  10-50% will require hospitalisation 3-5 weeks
                  after exposure. 10% will die.
300 to 530        Nausea, vomiting and fatigue in 50-90% after
                  2 hours to 3 days. Unable to perform complex

                  one day.
                  100% mortality rate within 24 hours.

Haemopoietic syndrome : 100 to 1000 rems
The bone marrow is suppressed or destroyed. There are few or no
functional white blood cells to fight infection.
Gastrointestinal syndrome : 1000 to 5000 rems
The cells lining the gut are suppressed or destroyed.
Diarrhoea results from inability to absorb and exaggerated
secretion of fluid. Infection is common as gut bacteria enter the
body.
Central nervous system syndrome : 5000+ rems
An acute inflammatory reaction takes place in the blood vessels of
the brain, as well as the brain itself. The brain suffocates as
oxygen can\'t diffuse across the inflamed vessel walls.

Treatment
Effective treatment of high levels of radiation exposure are not
available until TL 13.
Partial treatments are available at lower tech levels :-
TL 5+ : antibiotics, heavy metal binders (chelators)
TL 8+ : bone marrow transplantation
TL 9+ : low berth
TL 10+ : broad spectrum vaccines to protect against opportunistic
infections.

severity), End.
Failure leads to the detection of a malignancy.

500-600        permanent sterility in 75%
800            permanent sterility in 100%

Rolling back radiation damage :-
Cloned or regenerated parts, or reanimation will reduce total
exposure. For simplicity, replacement parts reduce exposure by 10%
per part.
Reanimation returns total exposure to the level before the lethal
dose. Cataract and malignancy checks are one level of difficulty
easier.

Constructive criticism is always welcome.

Prior to the advent of modern medical science, it had been observed
that survival from severe hypothermia was possible, if uncommon.

Many animals enter states of dormancy to conserve water and energy
during particularly adverse climatic conditions eg. dormice and
bears, lungfish and some desert toads on Terra.
However, there is a limit to how long dormancy can be maintained.
Metabolism continues, albeit at a greatly slowed rate.

Long term tissue preservation requires metabolic arrest. To effect
this, cell water must be locked in place to prevent cellular
proteins from working.
Water unfortunately expands on freezing (crystallisation), which
causes cell rupture and death.
It had been observed that rapid freezing limited the size of ice
crystals formed.
Immersion in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) was used to preserve
sperm, ova, embryos, seeds and pollen as early as Tech Level 6.

By Tech Level 8, it had been shown that animals such as frogs and
mice could be snap-frozen, thawed and revived. Survival rates were
predictably low.

The great breakthroughs which usher in the modern era of low
berthing take place at Tech Level 9.

Hibernation
\'Fast drug\' is a combination of cell signalling factors and
receptor blockers which are typically discovered in the course of
early research into metabolism and aging.

Its effect is to slow down metabolic rate a staggering sixty
times.
Unconsciousness ensues within two minutes of adminstration.
Body temperature attains ambient levels within four to six hours.

As a result, muscle rigidity is typical (below core temp 25
Celsius). It is difficult to distinguish between fast drug
administration, severe hypothermia or recent death.
TL 9+ blood testing will identify fast drug residues.

Fast drug induced dormancy is referred to as hibernation.
It can be augmented by cooling to cause further slowing of the
metabolism (chill berthing) or, with sufficient precautions, be
used as a sole agent (fast berthing). Intravenous hydration is
required.

Minimum monitoring for fast berthing : ECG/EKG.
Minimum monitoring for chill berthing : ECG/EKG, serum levels of fast
drug weekly, cooler system monitoring (tight control of temperature
required).
(ECG/EKG - electrocardiogram)

All facilities must have readily accessible resuscitation
equipment.
Chill berths above TL 12 usually have built-in automeds, or
provision for these to be installed.
Chill berthing operating temperature is usually 4 degrees Celsius
(39.2 F). Water is at its maximum density. Bacterial and fungal
growth is maximally inhibited.

Fast drug takes about two months or sixty days to be eliminated.
Agents which can safely reverse the effect before this time are not
developed until TL 12.

Freezing (Vitrification)
It is generally realised that the size of water crystals formed is
the main determinant of successful revival from freezing.
The development of compounds which depress the freezing point of
water without being toxic to an organism enables the first
successful revival from cryogenic freezing at about the same time
as the development of hibernation.

Cryogenic freezing technology becomes known as vitrification, as
tissue water is changed to a supercooled liquid and then a solid
with falling temperature.

Installing a patient into low berth in the early days was
equivalent to connecting them to life support. Infusion lines,
airways and monitoring devices needed to be surgically connected.
The procedure was expensive (low temperature high flow pumps,
etc.)
and hazardous. Failure rates of 5-10% were common.

The development of the gravisonic modulator at TL 11 greatly
simplifies the process. Based on inertial compensator technology,
this device enables cooling and warming at the cellular level.
No antifreeze agents are required and monitoring requirements are
greatly decreased.
Failure rates are greatly reduced due to the generation of biomaps
during the freezing process.

The emergency low berth is designed for use by unskilled
personnel.
At the earlier tech levels, prompt immersion in cryogenic fluid is
used. More advanced versions use gravisonic modulators and minimal
\'quick and dirty\' biomapping procedures.
Revival is somewhat more difficult under these circumstances.

Use of hibernation or vitrification technology.
Metabolic slowing or arrest is widely used in modern interstellar
society.
Critically ill patients can be stabilised and then placed in chill
or low berths to await definitive treatment.
Low berths enable cheap interstellar travel.
There are some associations of unusual individuals who use low or
chill berths to \'time travel\' into the future : \'timer clubs\'.
Some societies place criminals and dissidents \'on ice\', as do some
athletic and mercenary organisations to extend the useful lifespans
of their personnel.

**Rules
1. Hibernation

To install someone safely into a chill berth :-
Average, Medical, Edu

Fast berthing at -1 DM.
This includes establishing IV access.
Failure : catastrophe check
(Difficult, Medical/First Aid (attendant), End (patient) : 1D
damage if fails)
Spectacular Failure : VF during cooling. Resuscitation required as
per Trauma rules. Requires cardiac massage.
Spectacular Success : +2 DM to revival task

To safely revive someone from hibernation :-
Difficult, Medical, Edu

fast berthing : -1 DM
TL 12+ : +2 DM (fast drug antidote)
gravisonic modulator : +2 DM
Failure : roll catastrophe check - if fails, adverse reaction or
fast drug overdose apparent (1D damage). Task needs to be repeated.
Spectacular Failure : VF on warming. Resuscitation required as per
Trauma rules.

2. Vitrification

To install someone safely into a low berth :-
(difficulty), Medical, Edu

Difficult at TL 9-10
Average at TL 11+

Failure and success : as per chill berthing.

To revive someone safely from vitrification :-
Difficult, Medical, Edu

DM -2 if emergency low berth
DM +2 if gravisonic modulator
Failure : catastrophe check
Spectacular Failure : VF on warming, resuscitate

Long-term Considerations
1. Hibernation :-
Fast berthing 60:1 slowing of metabolism.
Chill berthing 600:1 slowing of metabolism.

Hydration is required to permit long-term hibernation.
The maximum safe period of time without fluid replacement is three
days (so 180 days with fast berthing or 1800 days with chill
berthing).
Beyond this, 2D damage per day (60 or 600 days) until treatment or
death ensues.

With hydration :-
Starvation : rapid weight loss (1kg/d for first ten days then
0.3kg/d thereafter).
- -1 from Str and Dex every two days until zero. Then -1 from End
every week until death or feeding ensues.
Multiply this by 60 or 600 depending on the hibernation type.

With IV (or gastric) feeding :-
Roll catastrophe check every year (infection at IV site?)

2. Vitrification
1 point of damage is sustained for every 25 continuous years spent
\'on ice\'.

Healing and recovery is as per trauma notes.

  {
    'body' => 'Over the years many medical treatments have arisen, ranging from
diet and exercise to nanomachine based \'drugs\'.

While some of the ailments have changed, the basic principles
remain the same. Improved technology generally yields more
efficacious treatments.

The Universal Drug Profile, v1.0
There are five basic categories of drugs :-
i. Anagathics : slow or stop the aging process.
ii. Anti-infectives : kill pathogenic agents, or limit their
growth.
iii. Depressants : reduce the activity of an organ system. Eg. a
sedative is a central nervous system depressant.
iv. Stimulants : increase the activity of an organ system.
v. Vaccines : bind to infective agents, toxins or rogue cells,
enabling their rapid neutralisation.

All agents have the following characteristics :-
Potency : the quantity of drug required to obtain desired effect.

Routes of administration : applied to skin? taken orally? injected?
inhaled? etc.

Systems affected : which organ systems are being intentionally
targeted? How marked are these effects? How long do they last?

Side effects : which organ systems are being unintentionally
targeted? Severity? Duration?

Abuse potential : is there any (a function of effect profile)?

Potency                      Routes of administration
1 micrograms                 1 IV infusion
2 tens of micrograms         2 IV injection
3 hundreds of micrograms     3 intramuscular or subcutaneous
4 milligrams                   injection (IM or SC)
5 tens of milligrams         4 oral (swallowed)
6 hundreds of milligrams     5 oral (under tongue)
7 grams                      6 inhaled
8 tens of grams              7 topical (applied to skin or
                             intended area of effect).

Typically agents that can be adminstered by multiple routes have
differing effective doses by each route.
Roughly :- IV X 10 = IM or SC ; IM or SC X 10 = oral (for those
drugs which can be absorbed orally). Drugs which can be applied
topically are either not meant to be absorbed or the dose
required approximates the oral one.

Systems Affected
1  Respiratory - includes ear, nose and throat
2  Cardiovascular
3  Gastrointestinal - liver, stomach, gut
4  Musculoskeletal
5  Peripheral Nervous - from spinal cord to sensory/motor endings
6  Central Nervous - brain and spinal cord, includes eyes
7  Genitourinary - kidney, ureters, bladder, accessory structures.
8  Haematological - bone marrow and blood components. Includes
                    immune system, clotting cascade.
9  Skin
10 Endocrine/metabolic - pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas,
                         gonads.

Anagathics, antibiotics and vaccines are regarded as generally acting
and have no stimulant or depressant effect, except perhaps as side
effects.

Interrelations between systems (important feedback loops) :-
Nervous system <-> cardiovascular (rate, blood pressure)
Cardiovascular <-> genitourinary (renal blood flow has an effect
                  on blood pressure)

Extent of Effect
Stimulation :-
3 Severe   eg. VF, hypertensive crisis, psychosis
2 Moderate eg. strong diuretic (increased urine flow)
1 Mild     eg. low dose caffeine\'s effect on the brain!
0 nil/baseline
Depression :-
- -1 Mild     eg. mild pain relief
- -2 Moderate eg. local anaesthesia, strong pain relief
- -3 Severe   eg. coma (general anaesthesia), cardiac standstill

Duration : the relationship between required dose and duration of
effect is complicated, to say the least. Here are some ballpark
values.
1 Minutes - circulation time is one minute which is the practical
            lower limit.
2 Hours
3 Days
4 Weeks
5 Months

Side effects are treated similarly. Typically they occur only on a
Spectacular Failure from a catastrophe check.

Safety margin : the ratio of dangerous to effective dose
1 5 or less
2 10
3 20 - most drugs
4 40
5 80
6 >160

If a dose exceeds the safety margin, the following check should be
made :-
(Extent of effect), Med/First Aid (attendant), End (patient)
Mild     Average          Failure : Minor damage
Moderate Difficult                  Major damage
Severe   Formidable                 Destroyed damage

Treat as per trauma rules (Resusc, etc. as required), plus see
Poisons, below.

Abuse potential : usually confined to drugs with central nervous
system effects (moderate or better stimulants or depressants).
Other substances eg. growth hormone (endocrine/metabolic, severe
stimulant) may be abused, given the right circumstances.

Effect   Abuse potential
Mild     low     (Easy)
Moderate average (Average)
Severe   high    (Difficult)

Dependency and withdrawal

To avoid dependence on a given drug :-
(abuse potential), (Int + End)/2

- -2 if peers abuse drug
- -1 if drug lasts for minutes
+1 if drug lasts days
+2 if drug lasts weeks
+4 if drug lasts months
Other situational modifiers at ref\'s discretion

To avoid withdrawal symptoms :-
Difficult, (Int + End)/2

Check every 4th multiple of the duration of effect after
discontinuation.
Failure :- all tasks at -1, reverse drug effects (e.g. if drug is a
mild gut depressant, withdrawal leads to mild gut stimulation -
diarrhoea).
Spectacular Failure :- all tasks at one difficulty level harder,
reverse drug effects are severe (using the previous example,
intractable nausea, vomitting and diarrhoea ensue).

Examples
1. A generic local anaesthetic
Potency is in tens of milligrams
It can be administered IV, by subcutaneous injection, topically
(special time release patch) or be inhaled (eg. spray the back of
the throat to permit passage of an airway).
Its primary effect is on peripheral nerve.
It is a moderate depressant of peripheral nerve activity.
Side effects are mainly central nervous (altered consciousness) and
cardiovascular (rhythm disturbances). A minor effect is increased
bleeding at the injection site.
Duration of effect is up to an hour.
Safety margin is 20.

and vomitting), respiratory (mild depressant) and gastrointestinal
(mild depressant, causes constipation).
Duration of effect is up to three hours.
Safety margin is 10.
Abuse potential is average.

3. Fast drug
Potency is in grams.
It can be given by injection or orally.
It is a severe depressant of metabolism.

**Poisons
Can be regarded as drugs which are deliberately given in doses much
larger than the safety margin.
Potencies are typically of the order of tens of milligrams or less
in acute poisonings ; grams may be required of heavy metals, etc.
Routes of administration as above.
Safety margins and abuse potential are not generally applicable.

Effect   Damage     Treat Task Difficulty
Mild     Minor      Average
Moderate Major      Difficult
Severe   Destroyed  Formidable

Immediate action :- as per trauma notes
Other manoeuvres include bandaging to trap venoms at bite site
(block lymph drainage), neutralising poison eg. vinegar for
stinging jellyfish, etc.

Treatment task :-

(difficulty), Medical, patient\'s End

but uncertain if substance or animal/plant unknown.

Treatment DMs :-
Specific antidote available : +4
Specific antidotes include antivenins (usually pooled human or
animal antibodies) or chelating agents (for heavy metal
poisonings).

However, most toxic substances have no specific antidote,
or are present in the blood in concentrations higher than
that which vaccines can safely neutralise (gram potencies or less).

In such cases, absorption needs to be limited (for ingested substances).

If this can\'t be done, blood needs to be filtered (dialysis).
Absorption limitation is an Average Medical task.

Methods include introducing activated charcoal (TL 6+), and bowel
lavage solution (polyethylene glycol, TL 7+).
Gastric lavage (washing the stomach out) is employed between TL\'s
4-8, but is potentially very dangerous (-2 to catastrophe rolls).

Successful resuscitation : +2

Assuming absorption is limited :-
TL 10+ broad spectrum vaccine : +3
TL 13+ broad spectrum vaccine : +4

If dialysis is required (TL 7+) : +3 to treatment task

Uncertainty DMs :-
Laboratory investigations can reduce uncertainty :-
TL   +DM to uncertainty roll
4-5  +1
6-8  +3
9-11 +4
11+  +5 - lab or medical scanner/computer (interchangeable)

Spectacular Success rolls back 2D of damage
Spectacular Failure causes 1D of damage
Failure : catastrophe check.

Recovery and aftercare as per trauma notes.

Examples
1. Generic snake venom
Potency is in milligrams
Primary actions : severe depressant of muscle activity (causes
muscle to dissolve) ; severe depressant of blood clotting
(haemorrhage!) ; severe depression of peripheral nervous system
(paralysis).
Route of administration : must be injected
Duration is three to four hours.

2. Cyanide
Potency is in milligrams
Primary action : severe depression of respiratory system (prevents
cells from using oxygen).
Side-effects : severe central nervous stimulation (fitting).
Routes of administration : oral, injected ; hydrogen cyanide can be
inhaled.
Duration is hours without treatment (very tightly bound).

Disease
This discussion will concentrate on infectious diseases. It is
assumed that aging crises constitute acute exacerbations in
degenerative processes.

The myriad of potential infectious diseases that could exist can
be described by a small number of parameters.

Agent type : general class of organism
Infectivity : how readily disease can spread from one individual to
another.
Routes of transmission : how transmission is effected.
Incubation period : the interval of time between infection and the
development of symptoms.
Systems affected : where does the bug act?
Severity : the disability or death rate.

The Infectious Disease Profile, v1.0
Agent type
1 prion
2 viral
3 \'incomplete\' bacteria
4 \'complete\' bacteria
5 amoeba or fungus (single celled)
6 parasite - multicellular plant, fungus or animal.

Prions are proteins which can transform host proteins into copies
of itself, leading to damage. Eg. spongiform encephalopathies.
Viruses require host cellular machinery to reproduce. These are the
most common (70+%) infectious agents encountered.
\'Incomplete\' bacteria require host cells for shelter or energy
supply eg. Chlamydia, Rickettsia species.
Most bacteria are \'complete\'.

Transmissibility/Infectivity
1 Very low (1% or less)
2 Low (5-20%)
3 Medium (20-40%)
4 High (40-75%)
5 Very High (75+%)

Routes of Transmission
1 Body contact
2 Respiratory droplets
3 Water supply, or food
4 Blood or infected body fluid - requires contact with a mucous
membrane or entry into bloodstream.
5 Requires vector eg. mosquito and malaria, host animal in soil or
water, etc.

To avoid infection, given appropriate exposure :-
Infectivity     Difficulty
Very Low        Easy, End
Low             Average, End
Medium          Difficult, End
High            Difficult, End-1
Very High       Formidable, End

Incubation period
1 Years  eg. BSE
2 Months eg. leprosy
3 Weeks eg. TB
4 Days - most organisms
5 Hours eg. plague

Systems affected
1  Respiratory - includes ear, nose and throat
2  Cardiovascular
3  Gastrointestinal - liver, stomach, gut
4  Musculoskeletal
5  Peripheral Nervous - from spinal cord to sensory/motor endings
6  Central Nervous - brain and spinal cord, includes eyes
7  Genitourinary - kidney, ureters, bladder, accessory structures.
8  Haematological - bone marrow and blood components. Includes
                    immune system, clotting cascade.
9  Skin
10 Endocrine/metabolic - pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas,
                         gonads.

Viral respiratory infections are the most commonly encountered (60+%).
Organisms transmitted by contaminated water or food typically dwell in
the gastrointestinal system.

Example Symptoms
Fever is usual, but may not occur in the elderly, or in some
infections.

Respiratory : running nose, earache, cough, sore throat, mouth ulcers,
gum bleeding, chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up mucus,
phlegm, pus, blood or oedema fluid (pinkish froth from near terminal
lung inflammation or heart failure).

Cardiovascular : unstable blood pressure (low or high) - dizziness,
headache. Chest pain, sensation of heart racing (palpitations),
shortness of breath (on mild exertion, on minimal exertion, at rest
in order of increasing severity).

Gastrointestinal : nausea, vomiting (food, fluid, blood), abdominal
pain, diarrhoea (fluid, mucus, blood), constipation, jaundice (skin
yellowing from liver dysfunction), bruising (liver dysfunction)

Musculoskeletal : joint aches and pains, joint swelling, muscle aches,
wasting, muscle breakdown (myolysis ; muscle attains leather or wooden
consistency).

Peripheral nervous : disturbed sensation (decreased or increased),
weakness without muscle wasting (early), instability of blood pressure,
loss of sweating or sphincter control. Regionalised, unlike central
problems, which are global.

Central nervous : headache, nausea, vomitting, altered state of
consciousness (decreased or delirious), fitting, disturbed perception
(eg. vertigo, blurred or double vision, ringing in the ears),
eye pain, tearing, and as per peripheral nervous system.

Genitourinary : flank or loin pain, frequency of urination, pain on
passing urine, blood or pus in urine. Hypertension, fatigue and marked
decrease in urine output with renal failure.

Haematological : fatigue, shortness of breath (anaemia), prominent
lymph nodes in neck, armpits and groins with most infections (if not
immunosuppressed), abdominal pain (?enlarged spleen), bruising or
bleeding (platelet or clotting dysfunction).

Skin : rashes, blisters, boils, peeling, hair loss, etc.

Endocrine/metabolic : blood pressure instability, pain (neck, headache,
abdominal) weight loss, dizziness (low blood sugar or low blood
pressure).

  While rapid mission kills are more likely under B:2 (something around 10%
per hit, although some of those will be criticals and thus largely counter-
productive) that works both ways; a corsair has a one in 36 chance of being
eliminated as a result of _each_ hit under B:2.

Norris became Duke in 1098 when his father died.  Prior to this point he
had a career in Naval Intelligence.  I assume that Norris & Strephon met
at this point when Norris had an assignment at Capitol/Core but this is
not a necessary assumption.

What if the signed Imperial Warrant in the Captains cabin of the Kinunir
is addressed to "The Duke of Regina"?

Imagine this scenario:  The Fourth Frontier War ends in 1084.  Strephon,
at Capitol, gets the news in 1085.  He is not too impressed with the
stalemate that ensued.  He is not really sure what to do about this so
he mulls it over for a year or two.  In 1086 or 1087, after hearing good
things about Norris\'s father, he decides to issue an Imperial Warrant to
the then Duke (Norris\'s father) and sends it off on the Kinunir.  The
Kinunir travels from Capitol/Core with the warrant. When the Kinunir is
only a few parsecs from Regina it has some problems & gets stranded in
the Shionthy Belt.  Strephon never knows that Norris father did not get
the warrent.  Nobody else knows either, possibly Strephon gave it to the
Kinunirs Captain in person or the courier who brought it to the Kinunirs
Captain is not in a position to check up on it.

Then in 1104 or 1105 so Strephon gets the message from Norris asking for
more power in case of a crisis.  Strephon responds "You can use the
Imperial Warrant I sent your father in 1087, it says "The Duke of
Regina" so you are entitled to use it."  Norris gets this message in
1105 or 1106.  He immediately says "_What_ Imperial Warrent?"  He then
checks all his fathers papers (which may take months to make _sure_ it
was not misplaced), confirms it never arrived and simultaneously has his
staff start looking for it.  [This is an excellent opportunity for the
PC\'s to meet Norris\'s psionic attache Branj, for him to confirm
psionically that they are honorable & to ask them to keep an eye out for
the warrent. If you want your Traveller universe to be a bit more
conspiratorial

Babylon 5 Season 4&5 SPOILER Warning

S
p
o
i
l
e
r

You can have Branj pull a Bester and have hidden psionic controls
implanted in one or more of the PC\'s.

Either he finds it, is behind the PC\'s who find it in Adventure 1, the
PC\'s find it on their own & give it to him (which I would like to think
is their patriotic duty), or he learns about the PC\'s and gets it back.
To keep canon consistent I would suggest that the PC\'s in Adventure 1
find it as suggested in the adventure at the same time that Norris has
discovered it is in the belt.  Norris\'s ship then jumps in & gets the
ship from the PC\'s when they leave the wreck of the Kinunir. (which is
also a cool way for them to meet him).  He then uses it, when needed, to
sack Santanocheev.  Note that the PC\'s will have commited a High Justice
crime by going on board the Kinunir in the first place so Norris now has
them where he wants them for any other future items he needs taken care
of (Unless your PC\'s don\'t mind being taken out and shot....) Which may
be useful in a campaign.

Note that in this scenario Strephon has been a bit sloppy with an
Imperial Warrant to not notice it was missing for _18_ years.  You can
either assume that this 1) is necessary for the scenario 2) is about all
the level of attention to detail that you can expect from any Emperor of
Trillions 3) is an indication that Strephon has some problems (further
indicated by MT\'s Rebellion) or 4) (my favorite) a bit of all of these.

I thought everyone knew that all important charecters in Traveller have
their own personal Ancient Artifact.  Norris has a footlocker with a
pocket dimension built into it (Sort of like a Bag of Holding in D&D) so
when he found the Kinunir in the Shionthy Belt he did indeed put it in
his footlocker.  Where do you think all those Ancient Artifacts that
PC\'s find in adventures _go_ when the MIB\'s take them away from the
PC\'s?  Remember Rank Hath Its Privlidges.   :)

  Please keep in mind that TL 12 designs are not SOTA (well, except in

        Fuel=204. EP=25. Agility=2. Troops=25.

  Here we have a so-called Colonial Cruiser (actually a police ship for the
local power to send around their tradeworlds to prop up friendly regimes in
typical gunboat routines) with a top of the line computer, decent Agility
and the ability to run emergency Agility at 3 or 4, and tough enough not to
take criticals from anything short of a capital ship spinal mount.

  As an exciting contrast for SDB crew and boarding troops, this ship does
go out and see a variety of interesting places and patrol/police/suppress
them. To reduce the number of volunteers for these slots to a reasonable
level the ship is a somewhat crowded, under-equipped hell-hole; after a
while, deck crew will enjoy reminiscing about pigboat duty.

  The crew is calculated per HG with some trimming of the command staff,
although it\'s still substantially larger than required by Book 2. The power
plant is a non-standard size; factor 4 rated, dropping fractions. Shutting
down the beam lasers adds one to Agility.

  There are two internal bays for 10 ton small craft; typically these are
troop landers/AFV\'s, but they could be fighters. Troops can be replaced by
low berths at a 4:1 ratio, which could provide some extra muscle for bad
situations, and beats storing disciplinary cases in a stockade :>

  The most cost-efective upgrade would be to install a TL 13 powerplant, 
and beef up the non troop strength related capabilities with the extra
24 Dt; the MCr 72 savings is a bonus. Easier for local construction would
be to import TL 13 or 14 weapons (if available) giving +1 factor to the
various offensive batteries - criticals on 400 Dt civvies!

  So the defenses are deliberately set up not to monitor the danger area? The
lowest possible orbit only makes sense if the defenders have only a single

  That\'s fairly credible, although the function still looks _really_
weird. Ignoring the fact that great big honking armour plates (which
eventually appear as ships get heavily armoured?) are almost certainly
fairly cheap to work with (although the capital to do so may not be -
similar to the problems with early iron plate armour), this is totally
at variance with Striker, and the turnover between that design system
and HG is over ten Dt, and quite possibly up to 100-200 Dt for heavy
orbital gunships.

  If such a factor exists in one of the other design systems (CSC, FFS
1 or 2) I\'d like to know about it, particularly if the system in question
scales fairly smoothly from AFV up to heavy gunboat size.

look up his crew papers to see if he\'s telling tall tales - and then bring
him in and question him if you think not. If he was a pirate you offer
clemency (time served if no murders?) and don\'t ask about his bank account,
in exchange for shopping the old crew.

Maybe not main trade routes, but at least far enough away from core society

Your right, it isn\'t. I was playing MT rulesset at the time.

The Telstar XII is specifically designed to engage pirates who are attempting
to dock with ships out near the planet\'s 100D jump limit.

By definition such ships are not evading (unless the merchant ship is -
I don\'t think that it is possible to dock with a ship that is still evading.)

So the problem is just one of pointing and energy density.

Hmmm,

If you assume that it takes 30 min to dock, unload (or capture) and undock
then with no manoeuvre, you know where the ship will be for the next 30 min
so the laser shot has 15 min to get there.

That\'s 270 million km

At  TL13, given top of the range sensors, lasers and pointing devices...

(1) I logically can\'t see the intelligent transponders being used
anymore, after what happened (Virus?) so we go back to what we had
before... and a "bad idea" (in some people\'s opinions) goes away.

(2) Why don\'t some of the gearheads (excludes me) develop a workable(?)
stealth suite or other Sci-Fic technology that would be used to make the
ranges of the DSR and grav-focused lasers much less?  I believe that we
have had increases in offensive weaponry and sensors, but little in the
way of defending against them.  That would be an area of intense
research, I\'d think.  Even to the degree of creating "shields" [ducking]
that are effective against lasers at extreme ranges....

The point I was trying to make was that a WRITER could get access to the
material. While I don\'t expect every writer to know about the TML, I would
expect them to make a decent effort to get old material, which _is_
available. 

Part of the fault/responsibility lies with the editors, who should be
pointing out to writers where they can get the material (seeing as all the
current Traveller publishers, ie. Loren and Marc, have access to the TML).
IG was particularly bad about this, in that they didn\'t bother doing any
consistency checking and hired writers who didn\'t bother either. (Leaving
aside their habit of not paying for things.)

	I guess I see the 100-D limit as the closest you can come out of jump to a
world...the gravity well then forces a starship out of jump.  There is no
requirement (as I see it) that you must come out exactly at that point.  As I
said in my original post...there may be reasons (both legit and shady) NOT to

If you will forgive me for not posting the reference (my books are at home),
I have another datum to add:

3.6: Somewhere (I _think_ it is in 5FW, but it could also be SMC) we\'re told
that the Norris\' warrant was on a courier ship that was forced to land on
Algine. No details about what caused it to do so. Norris\' dilemma was that
Algine was Interdicted and Santanocheev had specifically reinforced the
orders forbidding anyone from violating interdicts (pleny of scope for
conspiracy theories there, but no other hard facts). If the courier
contained his warrant, Norris could justify violating the interdict,
because he would then have the authority to overrule S. If it wasn\'t in
the courier, Norris would be in a LOT of trouble if he did. In the end
he did go down on Algine, retrieved the warrant, and went back and took
over from S.

My suggestion is to go back to this version. The warrant was never on the
Kinunir, so the discrepancy goes away.

	Actually, it does sometimes seem that those of Hispanic and African-American
descent tend to try to shoot it out w/ the cops...Seth will recall the Ron
Mortenson case here locally.  For those not familiar w/ it, an off-duty Metro
officer went out and did a drive-by w/ his partner and killed a Latino teen.
The driver of the vehicle (his partner) was NOT charged in the killing (Daddy
was a Metro detective).

	This line of discussion could actually get out of hand...the Police Dept.
here is made up of, for the most part, very fine individuals. They do a very
difficult job and generally do it well.  They deserve all our support.

Stock rules in that in TNE and its supporting games (like BL), the designers
assumed that impact-type missiles were so useless that they didn\'t even include
rules for them (and explicitly mentioned them in the designers notes.) 
So somebody playing "official" TNE can\'t use such missiles. This had lead to
various irritated people on the list designing variant KKMs and trying to 
produce rules for them, and various other people coming up with variant 
point defence rules to better reflect this kind of interaction...but since
you don\'t want variants, we\'ll stick with not having the missiles :-) 
(If you do want variants, the general consensus is that the lasers win 
except against highly specialized very expensive missiles.)

I\'m not sure what relevance this has... I wasn\'t worrying about whether you
could detect missiles (although a missile that\'s going to hit you is almost
certainly close enough to detect easily with active sensors.) In the real
world, it may well happen that both sides\' aircraft will have lasers (some day-
currently only the US has the technology.) In that case, air battles in the
twentieth century may turn into duels between armoured laser-carrying 747-sized
aircraft...

In Traveller, of course both sides have lasers - so neither side can hit 
the target with a impact-type missile.

possible):

a)  An evading ship isn\'t necessarily very accurate, there could be significant
problems with vibration-damping, and most high-resolution systems just don\'t
turn all that quickly.  Of course, making ships only able to fire while not
evading just turns combats into even more of a turkey-shoot (except at really
long ranges, it\'s probably better to shoot and not manuever than to manuever
and not shoot).

b)  All traveller rulesets I\'ve seen ignore the fact that hitting with meson
fire if you don\'t have _exact_ rangefinding (to within the length of the target
vessel, basically) is essentially impossible.  There\'s too much space before
and after the target.  As such, a meson weapon at a light-second either
involves two sensors which are themselves a good part of a light-second across
(and have good communications, which is a problem at that distance) or are
using an active rangefinding sensor.

c)  While less obvious, the same rules apply to lasers.  FF&S lasers are
described as being focused down to a single square centimeter (so they have
reasonable penetration).  In order to get that level of focus at one
light-second with an X-ray laser, you need roughly a 3 meter (grav-focused)
mirror.  This isn\'t all that challenging to do -- but it means that a beam
which was 3 meters wide at it\'s base is focused down to one centimeter wide at
a light-second.  A 1% error in computing the distance to the target moves you a
significant distance along the cone, increasing the area the beam is focused in
from one square centimeter to about 8.  1% accuracy in range-finding with
30-meter visible light telescopes requires a pair of sensors at least 500
meters apart.  This means that single warships must, again, use active
rangefinding to be effective against hostile warships.

d)  Active rangefinding is probably relatively easy to deceive ;)

As a minor note, there is enough scattering off typical levels of 
interplanetary dust for a decent sensor to see the laser beam. However, this
isn\'t particularly crucial; the closed-loop tracking systems described in
my post pretty much guarantee that the laser goes where you think you\'ve
pointed it, to about ten nanoradians or better. Yes, a ship can move out of
the way if it\'s accelerating randomly - but that\'s *not*the*case*we*were*talking
about (grumble, grumble); I was explicitly responding to a discussion of
non-evading targets and to Kevin imply that hitting a stationary 30-meter
target at 1 couple of lightseconds is difficult. It isn\'t. Evading targets,
yes - but I said that in my post.

I\'m not sure what you mean. The size of the laser and the price are defined
by your favourite rules set. In the real world, closed-loop fast steering
mirrors, sensors, and control systems are only $100K  for astronomical
applications.

I freely admit this; ships at several lightsecond range have a good chance
of evading fire. (The relevant acceleration at 4 lightseconds is 
given by (1/2)*(A)*(8sec)^2=30m for A=1 m/s^2 or one tenth
of a G. Of course, even one tenth of a G sustained for hours requires
a fair amount of power - you can\'t just sit there with your power plant
turned off...

In the closed-loop case, seeing the beam is irrelevant. If the missile is
stationary, you\'ll hit it. If it\'s accelerating and evading, in 0.0066 seconds
it\'ll move (0.5)*(1000m/s)*(0.0066)^2=0.02 meters from its projected position;
the missile is certainly smaller than that. (You\'ve used the wrong formula
for calculating how far something moves from rest or predicted course; it\'s
really (1/2)(acceleration)(time^2), which makes life really rough at short
ranges.

>How bright is a 30 meter metal target at 1.28 million clicks?  Assume flat 
>black paint.  You can\'t hit what you can\'t see.
This is a legitimate issue, though it\'s not what we\'re talking about; the
debate was about whether you can hit something at this range, not see it. I\'ve
done a *lot* of work on the question of whether you can see it - my sensor
rules are available on a couple of web sites, and I recommend you take a
look at them. A 99% black 100 ton ship has a visible-light signature
of about -1; 1.5 million km is a range factor of 11.5, so a PEMS-12.5
will barely detect it and a PEMS-13.5 (about the right sensor for a small
warship) has a good chance. A 99.99% black hull ("military ultrablack" is
significantly harder. Of course, if the ship has any working powered systems
its much easier to see in the IR. In either case, you\'d probably use a 
LIDAR for real fire control. The overall consensus in the interminable
pirate-hiding debate was that a clever pirate with an expensive ship can
hide from a moderate-to-low capability world\'s sensors, asssuming that
the world doesn\'t have 6-12 sensor stations or SDBs pre-deployed
around the hundred-D limit.

Tacking headers on is evil and unnecessary, any half-competent mail program can
recognize mail from the TML by scanning the headers for the address.  Also, it
takes up space in the message display window which would otherwise be available
for the subject of the message.

Given a choice between unreadable codes and readable subject lines, I\'ll take
the readable subject lines.  Given that people don\'t even change the subject
line when they\'re replying to digests (or when they\'re changing the subject), I
think it\'s safe to say expecting topic codes in messages is not going to
happen.

I always assumed these type of hits not only included the weapon system
itself, but also the power grid that supplied the weapons. This made it
marginally more believable for me.

BTW, I found a variant starship damage table for MT I came up with several
years ago, the biggest difference being that all hits were rated according
to the Superficial/Minor/Major/Destroyed system in the MT task system. It\'s
typewritten, and I though about scanning it in to make a digital copy.
Would anyone like to see it?

The problem I have with this thinking is that it assumes governments that
are willing to subsidize big fat merchant ships aren\'t willing to subsidize
protection for said big fat merchant ships.

I don\'t think a subsidized route means an unprotected route. It can mean
that it is potentially more dangerous or less profitable. If anything, I
would think that subsidized merchants could *expect* escort, in order to
protect the multi-megacredit investment the government in question is
making. As mentioned previously, one lost subsidized merchant (or a badly
shot up one) is a worth a lot of anti-piracy measures.

To start a somewhat different thread, what would a standard subsidized
merchant contract be like? What are the legal issues involved? The
economic? Why subsidize a merchant? Would you see it only with relatively
"smaller" ships like the type R, or would there be subsidized
megafreighters in the multi-ktn range? Would megacorps be in on the action,
or would they be excluded for anti-trust reasons (isn\'t a megacorp close to
a monopoly anyway?).

I hope I can get as clear a rundown on the issues on this thread as I have
on the piracy thread.

I second this motion. I have 4 other mailing lists that get sent to my
account, two of them do not have headers - TML and a small, but
extremely important list to me. Thus, I have to wade through TML posts
to find the important posts. It will also make mail filters easier to
configure for others.

Once within a group very from a town not so far away, we barely made a

Another interesting approach is a missile. The one case that even I - the
most rabid of anit-KKM people - will admit a KKM is useful for is against
stationary targets; an incoming fragmentation missile can detonate/deploy
submuntions 30,000 km out or so, far enough out to be relatively safe
from point defence fire. 
It takes about 80 G to get to
the 100-diameter limit from a standing start in 30 minutes. It should be
possible to design a TL13 or 14 HEPlaR missile that can do 80 G for
half an hour, with a warhead of (say) 1000 kg of BSD rods (maybe 100x10 kg
rods; they deploy 30 second before impact into a ~10m radius circle.)
That pretty much guarantees 1-2 rods hitting the target at about 1400 km/s,
with 10000 MJ of energy each - enough to cripple a typical target. 
(1000x1kg rods might be more efficient.) It\'ll be a big expensive missile,
of course, and you\'ll need to fire about 10 of them to make sure one gets
through.

The downside is: the merchant gets hit by several rods and probably gets
completely destroyed, but the merchant\'s family will be deeply consoled by
the knowledge that the pirates were caught to.

(Of course in practice, the pirate will see the missile coming and
run away at the last minute - it creates a race between the pirates
unloading cargo and the missile coming in.)

Advertising to sell this without merchants catching on would be tricky.
"Introducing the BAMTech BT-100 \'Ineluctable Doom\' Fast Rescue Launch...
delivering a tonne of vital metal supplies to distressed merchants within half
an hour or less." 

(Hopefully Kevin et al will realize that all this is heavily tounge-in-cheek.)

(Seriously, it\'s worth noting that a merchant with either no operational laser
or no operational drive is also incredibly vulnerable to kinetic weapons - 
vulnerable enough that a sensible merchant will pretty much surrender
immediately once its in that state; a pirate could otherwise pretty much
destroy the ship with only a couple of missiles.)

Actually, make it a mix of submunitions -- I\'m not certain of the performance
of TL 13 chemical rockets, but 20 seconds * 15 Gs is almost certainly viable
and sufficient to handle last-minute manuevering by most vehicles.  Deploy 20
seconds before impact, give five of the missiles sensors and short-range
moderately tight beam comms (mostly, the comm needs to not go towards the
target ship) and the remainder receivers (it may be viable to give all of the
missiles sensors, but picking up a ship at a hex might be tricky even though
you know where it is).  Unless all of the sensor missiles are killed, control
is sufficient that (even against an evading target) _all_ of the missiles will
hit -- ballistic systems in space easily match laser accuracy -- and you can
avoid hitting the merchant at all.

This is not to say that this is all that ideal a weapon system, it\'s probably
inferior to a xaser warhead, but it isn\'t unusable.

I used to use PINE extensively - but something at either my ISP or here at
work changed.  Now when I open PINE, it resets any mail that is sitting in
my mailbox to (as far as either Netscape Mail or Outlook Express is
concerned) \'new\'.  Since I have my work machine set up to download copies of
(but not remove from the server) my mail...well with the 100+ messages the
TML is generating per day (and the fact I only download/remove mail from
home every couple of days) it can get ugly.

I hate it when assumptions I made three years ago, creep up and bite me

be able to filter on two addresses (traveller@mpgn.com and

a phaser-showcase address as well.

Short is good, well - not evil any way.  And it does tend to tag a message
as to the source, which is also good.  Personal viewpoint I guess....

Looks like (according to my Votes mail box -- us pack rats don\'t throw anything
away) that we voted on it from 2/9/97 through 2/20/97 so it has been a couple
of years.  I think one of the big concerns was for the digest readers which
represent a majority of the subscribers to the list having all that extra [TML]
put in the subject listings of the digests.  It would be quite annoying there.

errors. My apologies to the rest of the list.

Repost begins:
- ----
I\'m working on the numbers at home, but I thought I\'d give a little
preview of the ideas I\'m working with. To wit: what a pirate gets
for his troubles.

Let\'s assume we\'re using a 400tn _Nishemani_ class corsair, the
classic example pirate ship - probably a refitted armed merchant
or paramilitary ship. It\'s got a 110tn cargo bay that can, among
other things, hold a 100tn ship. Like a type-S Scout, or a Seeker,
or an X-Boat, or any one of those small craft that are all over an
inhabited system. It also has twenty low berths, so you have
somewhere to put the crews of those craft.

Now, I\'ve got some assumptions about piracy that I\'d like to
reiterate, just so critics know my basis and can kibbitz properly.

1. Pirates need to clear out quickly; for most targets, the patrol
will be on the way.

This limits what you can take. Small craft (the big profits). Vehicles. 
Vac suits. Supplies. Passenger valuables. Select items from the 
cargo bay. The contents of the ship\'s safe. Missiles & sand canisters
(if the target hasn\'t "given" them to you already).

What you can\'t take: Ship components. Bulky cargo items. Fuel.
Starship weapons. Valuable things, but you simply don\'t have the
time to get them.

This will not apply if you\'ve hit the target in an unpatrolled system, and
that\'s good - you may well have taken a hit or two from a target well-
equipped enough to be in an unpatrolled system alone, you\'ll need all
the booty you can get.

2. It\'s very hard to jump away a starship you take.

If the target had fuel, it would have jumped away from you. It\'s almost
trivial for the crew of the target to lock out their computers long enough
for the patrol to catch up. And if you had to put a couple laser bolts into
their Engineering Compartment to convince them to give up, they\'re
not going anywhere anyway.

There will be exceptions to this, but I feel they will be rare enough that
we can ignore them for the purposes of this study. The captain who
succeeds at taking and selling a major starship has a right to be proud
of his unusual accomplishment.

3. You can use or sell what you take.

Here are my assumptions on value for items:

- ----

Starships: 10% of value. Starships are so well documented that it is
expensive to dispose of stolen ones. They may simply be used as
auxiliaries to the "pirate fleet". Few will be taken, as per #2 above.

Small Craft: 25% of value. They are more ubiquitous, and tend not to
be kept track of in interstellar databases as much. (note: one lifeboat
taken will pay all maintenance, life support and salary costs for a
400tn corsair for about three years).

Vehicles: 25% of value, for the same reasons as small craft.

Supplies: Spare parts, tools and life support essentials can be taken.
There is a bit of a handwave here, but I assume that the pirate can use
these to defray some costs of life support and to affect the price of his
annual maintenance. Total up what the target ship spent on life support
for the current trip, and credit the pirate 25% of that towards his life
support expenses only. As for annual maintenance, reduce the cost
to the standard .1% per year - the stolen parts and tools help make
up for the bribes and extra costs, even in a law level zero port, of
getting annual maintenance done on a less than legal starship.

Vac Suits: assume one per crew member of the target, plus two
spares. Each one worth Cr10,000, pirate recoups 25% of that.

Rescue Balls: Assume one per passenger including low berths, 
Cr600 each, pirate recoups 25% of that.

Passenger valuables: Assume, as a minimum average, cash and other
easily convertable valuables on hand equal to the price paid for passage.
These valuables are recouped with no reduction (or the reduction is
included in the average). High passenger Cr10,000, Low passenger
Cr1000, Middle passenger Cr8,000.

Ship\'s Safe: Ships need to carry cash, they can\'t remain on-planet
long enough for credit to clear in a crisis - whether it\'s a fine that needs
to be paid or an opportunity speculative cargo. Figure as an estimated
average, Cr25000 per 100tns of ship. Note that my only real source
for this is the Cr100,000 the _March Harrier_ had on hand at the start
of _The Traveller Adventure_, it may be much higher. This will be in
cash, recouped at 100% of value.

Ship\'s Locker: Ignored. Assume that items go to replenish equipment
stores on the pirate, the locker is really so varied from ship to ship
that it\'s hard to come up with an average. We can safely assume that
a pirate ship will run out of storage space, rather than run out of
miscellaneous equipment.

(However, a note: in the AD&D game, the most commonly overlooked
type of treasure is household goods. Those kobolds may have only
had a handful of pennies, but that big iron cookpot is worth a gold piece
or two.)

Cargo: The pirates will have to (very) quickly evaluate the cargo, and
guess what they have time to take. A zero-G cargo handler robot or
exoskeleton would be a very good thing here. Variation is too high
to allow a very useful average value of what can be taken, as one ship
may have two tons of gemstones while another may have nothing but
grain. I decided on allowing the pirates to recoup an average value of
Cr250 per cargo ton of the target (25% of Cr1000 per ton). This allows
some losses for travel, middlemen, and the other expenses of getting
even a valuable cargo to market.

(Note: In AD&D, the second most often ignored type of treasure was
trade goods. <G>)

Passengers: I decided to leave kidnapping for ransom or slavery out of
the equations. There will be exceptions, and I even have some ideas
(for later) that the slow communications time of the Imperium may make
kidnapping for ransom far easier than it is on Earth today, if you are 
patient or ruthless enough.

- ----

With the above numbers, I\'ve hit a tentative conclusion as to what a
pirate needs to do to keep going: 

A Far or Free Trader will get him about Cr100000. A Fat Trader will get
him about MCr3 and change. Small craft are worth several MCr each.

Not counting the value of the ship, the pirate needs to spend about
MCr1 a year in maintenance, salary and expenses. 

So:

One starship taken in the course of a corsair ship\'s career will pretty
much amortize the entire value of the pirate ship for five years or
more.

Each small craft taken and popped into the cargo bay will pay
expenses for at least two years, or pay part of the value of the
pirate vessel. 15 lifeboat/launches is all it takes to completely pay
off the current value of a 400tn Corsair, pinnaces and ship\'s boats are
worth even more.

Ten Free Traders taken in a year will pay all expenses except battle
damage.

One Fat Trader taken will pay all expenses for about three years except
battle damage.

Most battle damage will probably occur in an unpatrolled system,
as the stakes are higher and the target vessel is probably better armed.
Unpatrolled systems are the only systems where a pirate will want to
fight at all - the risks are too high compared to the rewards in a system
where patrol ships are en route to the fight.
Targets taken in unpatrolled systems can almost always be considered
valuable enough to cover cost of damage - unless the damage stops
the pirate from jumping back to base.

Therefore:

Even if a pirate has to hunt for an entire year to bag one Fat Trader,
he\'s still making reasonable money. I believe this answers some 
arguments that a pirate loses too much money by lying in wait for 
targets, or by having to transit several systems to get from a base 
to a good hunting area.

Income can be far, far higher than just expenses if the pirate hits a few
good targets. This allows there to be enough income potential to make
up for the really bad luck a pirate can have - one missile hit can cost
millions, even if it doesn\'t kill you. Piracy therefore becomes high-risk,
but very profitable if the risks pan out.

There may be more efficient uses for a starship than piracy, but there are
people who cannot do legal careers for various reasons and ships they\'d
not be able to use legally. Combine the two, and you get Corsairs.
 I believe my analyses show that a pirate can make money, if the setting
IYTU allows them to survive and travel.

Please take a look at my assumptions, especially those on the value
of the booty, and comment - these assumptions are critical to the
economic viability of the pirate career.

Well, lore and reality are two very different things. Actual accounts of
the settling of the US west show it to be a roung, hard, somewhat
dangerous, and rather staid way of life. There was effective law
enforcement, on the whole. People moved with sheriffs and judges as they
went.

In actuality, what is typically precieved as \'the American west\': the
shootout at the OK corral, Dodge City, Jesse James, Butch and Sundance,
etc, occured in the 1860\'s and 70s, long after the initial settlements,
and a well established justice system was in place.  One cause was the
displacement of vast numbers of trained, armed soldiers, mostly
Confederates after the civil war. (the James brothers, IIRC were members
Quantrells Raiders, a Confederate guerilla group...what would be called
specops forces nowadays.)In Traveller terms you see the same thing
occurring after the FFW, as Vargr combatants turn to raiding, (big
surprise there :-) or during the waning days of the Rebellion,
particularly in the conflict zone betwen Margaret\'s realm and the
Solomani. See Survival Margin for some examples.

The other cause was cowboys coming into town, getting paid three or four
months wages at once as the cattle they were driving were sold, and
hitting the entertainment spots in town, where the townsfolk cooperated
heartily in separating them from as much of that cash as possible. 

The other major areas of lawlessness were, as always, mining boom towns,
same cause as the cowboys. People come into town with a sudden
accumulation of wealth, alcohol flows feely, and that\'s a volatile mix.

Since the design rules are canon, if you want to be a nitpicker
about it it\'s canon if you can design it :-)

trade the two hours lost flight time for a greater chance of keeping
their very expensive ship.

If all the pirates in a sector know that Cadmo Shipping has all their
ship\'s computers set up this way, they\'ll know they\'ll not take a 
Cadmo ship with them and will attack other targets. How long before
other shipping companies follow suit?

The pirate crew can get around this, if they have a competent
computer hacker on their crew. I already said a competent computer
hacker would get them around this.

When you rob a convenience store, you\'re taking a day\'s profits and the

stealing someone\'s life, livelihood, home and world. The crew will take
some risk to prevent you from taking the ship with them, or will risk
a misjump if they have the fuel.

Keven, I realize that taking a ship - even a dinky Free Trader - is the BIG
SCORE  for a pirate. Realize what this big score costs other people.
These other people will take measures to reduce your chance of taking
a big score out of their pockets, even if it means a risk to those crewmen
they hired last month. The "chicken stealing" you\'re turning your nose
up at is livelihood of a pirate, it pays the bills and keeps the ship in the
game until all the luck comes up right and you get a shot at the big score.

How many employee\'s lives will an investment firm put at risk to reduce
the chance of losing a MCr300 asset, especially if taking those steps
regularly will reduce the chance (in the long run) that either employees
or asset will be put at risk?

There\'s no point in threatening to kill the crew if you can\'t steal the ship,
when you and the crew both know that things have been arranged so you 
can\'t steal the ship itself. All those threats will do is make your target 
scared and dangerous.

This one probably isn\'t much of a problem. The closed-loop fast-steering-mirror
system will take out vibrations as well as any other small, fast motions.
The tracking for big motions (like the rotation of the ship) can therefore
be much less precise - systems that track at 10 degrees/second should be 
fairly practical.

>b)  All traveller rulesets I\'ve seen ignore the fact that hitting with meson

I did actually put this into my MCS rules - evasion is more effective against
meson fire.

>c)  While less obvious, the same rules apply to lasers.
>[discussion of focussing meaning the beam spreads]
There\'s another reason you need accurate range: you can\'t figure out how
much to "
lead the target by unless you know how far away it is. This drives rangefinding
to be much more precise than a percent. Of course, as you fire multiple shots
you can "walk" them in...or a really good sensor operator could use the 
information from his own ship\'s acceleration to calculate range (like a passive
sonar getting range today from speed information), but accurate weapons fire
will require active sensors. (To simulate this, make laser fire one or two
difficulty levels higher unless
(a) the target is detected with active sensors
(b) two or more ships have a passive detection of the target
(c) the firing ship\'s sensor operator makes an Impossible sensor roll

>1% accuracy in range-finding with

I think this is not quite correct (probably dropped a couple of important
factors...) A 30-m telescope can measure a position to within 10^-10 radians...

From: Greg Smith <gsmith@helot.arl.mil>
Subject: Canon

I\'ve been reading the discussions on canon with interest.  I\'m curious
about a couple of things:

1.  What kind of transponders are used in TNE?
______________________________
We never used any, since most of the problems had come about do to their
use we determined that the RCES did not use them.  Any ship that entered
RCES space was challanged and fired upon if they did not respond ASAP.


2.  Why do we assume that the DSR don\'t have 57th century Stealth to
mitigate againsth them?
_______________________________
Not touching this one with a ten foot poll.



(1) I logically can\'t see the intelligent transponders being used
anymore, after what happened (Virus?) so we go back to what we had
before... and a "bad idea" (in some people\'s opinions) goes away.

(2) Why don\'t some of the gearheads (excludes me) develop a workable(?)
stealth suite or other Sci-Fic technology that would be used to make the
ranges of the DSR and grav-focused lasers much less?  I believe that we
have had increases in offensive weaponry and sensors, but little in the
way of defending against them.  That would be an area of intense
research, I\'d think.  Even to the degree of creating "shields" [ducking]
that are effective against lasers at extreme ranges....

This might be interesting for you.<

Thanks for the plug TV! Should have a map to go with it
sometime in the not too distant future...

Things for interested gearheads:

1. The map uses the Gliese data from 2300 AD, not the more recent
   Hipparcos stuff.
2. It hasn\'t been converted to galactic co-ordinates, which is
   what a proper canon Traveller map would use.
3. It only shows inhabited worlds on the 2300 AD \'mains\' as
   otherwise the map gets a wee bit crowded when you squash it
   into 2D.
4. If you\'re seriously into real starmaps, check out a website
   called "The Weird World of Winchell Chung" (can\'t remember the
   URL, but you shouldn\'t get too many hits for that title).
5. I\'m sure I came across an Earth Colonies Development League
   webpage with a similar approach using 10x8x9 subsectors and
   real stars. Damn, can\'t remember the author\'s name or the URL.
   Some cool aliens too.

Let\'s not forget Defense *CruRon* Regina mentioned in the _Rebellion
Sourcebook_ and _Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium_, as well as
other references to "monitors" in various sources. IIRC, the former was
listed as an example of a system squadron (and thus are non-jump capable
system defense boats).

I am under the impression (from the _Imperium_ boardgame) that BB sized
SDBs (i.e., monitors) are not uncommon in the Imperium.

Sure. Lets deal with a backwater world. 10 million population, TL8. Average
income is therefore Cr 8000 a head. Now I cant find my copy of Striker Book
2 right now, so I\'m going to assume their credit trades at 0.3 to a TL12,
Starport B credit.

This world spends 1% of GDP on System Defense, buying the excellent Pirahna
class SDBs (I\'d guess they\'d spend another 1% on their army, and kick 1% to
the IN). This is Cr 80 per head, or Cr 25 a head in the credits.

Assume that Piranha class costs 20% of sticker cost per year in
maintainence. We can therefore easily afford to keep a fleet of eight.

Two are getting repaired, three are in reserve, and three are ready to
escort outgoing convoys, including to any mining camps in the system. If we
have any change, we\'ll buy a couple of type S scouts, in order to have a
courier service. With three ships on convoy duty, we could run one every
two days.

Note this is entirely with local resources. I find it quite reasonable that
an Imperium that claims the space between the worlds will assist worlds
with defending themselves from raiders who come from the space between the
worlds.

Now, the issue of subsidised merchants visiting backwaters ... we need to
disengage the concepts of \'subsidised trade\' and \'subsidised trade only
happens in a specific class of vessel\'.

The above government may well want to subsidise trade with it\'s neighbours.
To do so, it would probably have a look at the specific routes, their risk
profile, and come to an appropriate deal. A better method of subsidy may be
to offer to cover all combat damage within your system, for example.

Personally, I believe that if your local Imperial authorities wish to
co-operate, then they can do a lot to secure trade. For example, IN
elements could supplement local forces in protecting a system, or could
offer to send (for example) a Gazelle or similar along with any trader that
wants to go from a world with a Naval base to an insecure developing world.

Finally, for worlds with micro-economies, I\'d advise you to have a look at
the bits of the Sunbeard declaration that deal with trade in insecure
areas. Also have a think of how much trade goes into these systems, and
thus to how long a pirate would need to wait until it found a target.

So ships that were already in RCES (can\'t remember what that stands for)
going from one system to another didn\'t have any automated beacon saying
who or what they were, and patrols could/would challenge all/some
ships?  That works.  Was the RCES a survivor of the Virus or were they
coming out of the mayhem of a collapsed society?

Yes, I can understand that.  I look at "canon" as growing.  The Deyo
chips were a logical progression that ultimately took its toll.  The
next generation might not even use transponders (as yours didn\'t) or
might use them just for traffic control...  So from 1130 say, you either
have no transponder or just the basic.  New "canon" should take that
into consideration when or if new canon is published following that
timeline.


For lasers, etc. I just think it would be a logical progression to
attempt to stealth your ships better.  Grav-focusing should appear at a
certain date.  So should the better sensors (give it a hand wave as to
why they weren\'t so good before).  Adventures etc from pre-that date
should use the CT style lasers/missiles/sensors...  After that date they
should use the next generation, then, if there are new stealthing
techniques, they should begin to be seen around another such date,
resulting in the change to combat, etc.

DSR has "stealth" for high TLs, it\'s called ultrablack, and reduces
the sig considerably. There are two fundemental problems with steath
in space. One, there isn\'t really a prefered direction, so if there are 
sensors spread out in space, you\'ll have trouble hiding from active
sensors since *somebody* will be bouncing a signal normal to your
hull surface. Two, as Bruce has shown, even assuming that 90% of the
energy that a ship radiates is cleverly pointed away from enemy
passive sensors, ships are really, really bright in the IR. Hard to
steath that much energy.

I could agree with this if there was a tech level differance, but there is
not.  A TL-12 laser from CT/MT is vastly different than a TL-12 Laser from
TNE/FFS1/FFS2.  

There are too many differances in the way the technology is presented, IMO,
for it to be a simple matter of "next generation."  If that was the case,
where are all the leftovers from when the Virus happened?  It also does not
take into consideration the relic ships that are found, not to mention the
Virus possessed ships, would they not have the earlier generation?

Not a flame, just an observation.

Nice try again, but I wasn\'t asking about where your variant ruleset came 
from.  Now when you want to play Traveller, let me know.

In the Traveller Book, the picture showing the basics of FTL travel specifically shows the ship coming out *beyond* the 100 diameter jump curb.

Now, what I\'m about to propose *ain\'t canon*, but I\'d *seriously* think about what kind of damage would be caused to jump engines if they *could* come out within 100 or 10 diameters.  Considering there\'s a chance for the to be damaged jumping out due to the gravity gradient, it seems to me that there should be some chance of damage for them jumping into a simular gravity gradient.

Otherwise, what\'s to stop somebody from jumping insystem about 4 klicks above the surface of the planet?

Hard to stealth that much energy NOW, in the confines of our tech.  A
challenge would be to come up with whatever new tech you would need to
be able to stealth better, even IR.  That\'s what I\'m saying.  A black
globe does it, so it can be done.  Maybe the first step to deciphering
the black globe, or at least developing capability similar to it, would
be to figure out how to mask IR.

IIRC frost resistant Wheat wasn\'t devloped until the late 1300\'s and
without that the crop failure in England runs at about 1 in 3, forcing you
to stick with Oats and Barley. Again IIRC Maize is somewhat more frost
resistant so it would be like having a modern high yield Wheat avialible.
Also at least some varities will grow in much worse soil than Wheat.

When using BL I allow shots to be made at specific hit locations as if you
were firing at a ship of one size smaller. Thus you need a targeting lock
at +1DM (harder) and then you fire at +1DM to hit. However I\'m considering
making this harder, as it has seemed too easy when it was last tried.
Perhaps +1DM for the lock, and when firing if you would\'ve hit at +1Dm you
hit a random location and if you would\'ve hit at +2DM (or maybe with an
outstanding hit, but that seems too hard) you hit where you wanted to.

You\'re assuming two things.

1.  The Pirate *must* remain at rest relative to the Target for as long as the 
boarding party is away.  This does not need to be.  All you need is to be 
relatively motionless to drop off boarders and retrieve them.  In the 
meantime, you can do whatever you want.

2.  You\'re assuming that at closing for boarding, velocities will be on the 
order of km/s.  More like, on the order of maybe 100s of meters per sec.  Big 
difference.

And I\'m *NOT* going to go into something published in a JTAS once that said a 
standard vacc suit could effect up to about 2 km/sec vectoring.

Not at range.  It merely needs to move 30 meters in 8.5 seconds or so.  About 
a third of a G.

And this gives the Navy permission to kill the victims in order to save them?  
I thought I\'d heard the last of *THAT* kind of nonsense 25 years ago.

How many Stealth planes were shot down in the Gulf?  Zero.  Before the Gulf 
War, Patriot missiles were claimed to be 98% accurate.  Latest figures show 
them to be on the close order of 50% accurate, with the caveat that some of 
the Patriots were attacking SCUD debris after the aforementioned SCUD 
exploded, whether on its own or a previous Patriot hit.

This describes where you emerge when the destination is world.  I don\'t read
it that the author intends to require you to come out 100 diams from a world.
Add to this the fact that such a restriction would make examples of using
jumps to set up deep fuel depots that appear in the Traveller history (the
Solomani getting the Barnard\'s start w/out jump 2, the Zhodani deep space
base, the Navy\'s secret route that cuts through the great rift)

A low tech planet with a C, D, or E star port, under a billion people, a

In the Traveller Book, the picture showing the basics of FTL travel specifically
shows the ship coming out *beyond* the 100 diameter jump curb.
     
Now, what I\'m about to propose *ain\'t canon*, but I\'d *seriously* think about 
what kind of damage would be caused to jump engines if they *could* come out 
within 100 or 10 diameters.  Considering there\'s a chance for the to be damaged 
jumping out due to the gravity gradient, it seems to me that there should be 
some chance of damage for them jumping into a simular gravity gradient.
     
Otherwise, what\'s to stop somebody from jumping insystem about 4 klicks above 
the surface of the planet?

There are stealth technologies - thermal masking, radar stealthing, milblack
hulls. They help, just not enough to let you hide at medium or short ranges
This is not necessarily a bad thing. It\'s worth noting that the *only* era
I can think of in which naval sensor ranges were shorter than naval weapon 
ranges is the twentieth century - submarines, carrier-aircraft (considered
as a weapon for the carrier rather than as distinct entities), and SSMs. 
For the previous four thousand years of naval warfare, sensor ranges (=eyeballs)
exceeded weapon ranges. The idea that starship combat would be sensor-dominated
with short sensor ranges seems to have originated with 2300AD (and not been
very well handled there...); I don\'t see any reason to expect it to be 
that way...

A couple of other points:

First, my sensor model started with what I thought could be made to work at
TL8-9 or so. At that TL, in space, IR sensors are way ahead of what can be done
in the way of stealthing. For higher TLs I assumed things stayed about the
same - no miraclulous advances in stealth/IR masking, no miracularous
advantages in sensors either[1]; the two stay about even. I should note that
I can\'t think of even an SF-ish way of getting rid of waste heat other
than radiating it, or making a ship\'s hull more than 99.99% black...and I
didn\'t want to introduce anything that fundamentally warped the laws of 
physics; Traveller has always paid at least lip service to physics.[2]

Bruce
[1] There is a fundamental advances in sensors at TL10, when sensors stop
being telescopes and start being visible-light phased-arrays. I may produce
someday a "conservative sensor rule" set that assumes this advance never
happens...
[2] Except for the law of conservation of angular momentum, of course. And
conservation of momentum. And conservation of energy. But aside from those
three minor laws, Traveller stays within physics :-)

POSITION COORDINATES (0101)
These coordinates are measured as absolute "latitude" and absolute
"longitude" from Normal, Illinois (IL).  The position is calculated as
follows:

First Digits
These display the relative location of the Traveller fan, and where
the UTUP is practiced.  These are determined as below:

this out.
01   You live and/or play in IL. 
02   You live and/or play in the Midwest.

Striker is Classic, dyed in the wool, traveller. Not a variant. What
planet are you on? Striker is pre-Mega Traveller. As such is is as
much in the canon as say Scouts, or Fifth Frontier War.

Striker is traveller, jeez. Anything published with "traveller" on
it (assuming it was at least licenced, and therefore legal) IS
traveller.

For a variety of reasons, the Gulf War was a very poor proving ground
for many technologies. It was mostly a clear demonstration that a large,
well coordinated Air/land/sea attack by well lead, professional forces,
with the best intel available, at least  one TL higher, can really
demolish a poorly lead, conscript army with worn out vehicles, no air
support, and near zero intelligence capabilities in a very short order.
It was sort of like the New York Yankees taking on the average Little
League team. When the Little League team is expecting the Joe\'s Pizzeria
team when they walk onto the field.

Iraq did not have a very highly advanced anti-aircraft radar network,
and even less of one after our radar-homing missiles got done with them.
The AA around Bahgdad was primarily real TL-6 stuff, mostly 20 and 40 mm
stuff (remember all those night-vision shots of all the tracers?), IIRC
they didn\'t have many SAMS and the ones they did have anymore were of
quite old design.

Not hard for a stealthy aircraft to get through all that, they came in
low, fast and hard to see, dropped their bombs and split. Not many
aircraft of _any_ type were shot down during the war.

As you said, the Patriots, on the other hand, were rather conclusively
proven not to work well. Again, not at all surprising, in retrospect.
The Patriot is an antiaircraft SAM pressed into service as an
antimissile weapon. We\'re _very_ fortunate that modifying short range
missiles into medium range higher payload weapons systems is (literally)
rocket science, and the Iraqis are quite short of rocket scientists.
Otherwise all those SCUDS would have not broken up on their own, and we
_would_ have immediately seen how poorly the Patriots were performing. I
have seen estimates that only one or two SCUDS actually performed as
they were supposed to, one of which was the one that hit the barracks in
Dahrain. The rest broke up before impact, causing a lot less damage than
they would have if they had actually worked.

The Patriots _psychological_ advantage, OTOH, helped dramatically,
primarily by keeping Israel from turning Bahgdad into a large puddle of
slag in the desert.

A BG doesn\'t actually do it. This raises an interesting problems
with BGs, actually. The entire radiated output of a ship with a BG
must be absorbed by the globe and there fore finds its way back into
the caps. The energy doesn\'t go away even with a real BG, you have
to use it in some way that gets rid of it.

So even a real, ancient BG doesn\'t stealth you, it just delays the
emission until you vent it (or blow up :-)

You still have to match velocities at some point to drop the guys
off (within whatever the delta-v of a jetpack is).

Then how does the pirate close the 10s of thousands of km (even
using a 50,000km attack range from CT) in time to reach the target
before help arrives. At 500m/s it\'d take 27 hours to close on your
trader from 50,000km.

Assuming the guy only fires once. If he shoots into an area defined
by how far a ship can junk in the time lag (anybody with a pc to
drive their laser would do this unless they were trying to miss) and
can get off a few shots then he will hit.

Huh? You just said the prate dropped off the boarders and went off
evading. He isn\'t close anymore, so I\'m not risking the trader.
Besides, I was suggesting that the PIRATE needs to be careful of
trashing his prize completely.

"Break Out From Jump Space: The ship has just emerged from jump space,

Yeah, but I\'ll fire a EMM Masked missile at the PAW station in stock

the PAW will be out of action ;-)

You try to write the design/combat rules so that things work the way
we\'d expect (expect in the traveller universe!). Ranges for sensors
and weapons can change from CT and it\'s still traveller as long as
big ships have (useful) spinal mounts, and the various hierarchys of
weapons stay the same (turret->bay->spinal).

I don\'t think balance per se is important in the sense that every
measure have an exact countermeasure. A TL15 Imperial ship is just
plain better than a TL13 Zhodani one. Period. That isn\'t balance.
the TL15 one might even be cheaper, that\'s OK, too. What it tells
you is that the lower tech guys then have to spend more money to
stay level since it\'ll take a couple of their ships to fight the
enemy\'s better one.

So ships that were already in RCES (can\'t remember what that stands for)
going from one system to another didn\'t have any automated beacon saying
who or what they were, and patrols could/would challenge all/some
ships?  That works.  Was the RCES a survivor of the Virus or were they

Chopper crew hit in eyes by laser; Training flights halted over Bosnia 

A U.S. Army helicopter crew suffered eye burns from a laser beam while
flying over Bosnia-Herzegovina, prompting a temporary halt in training
flights and new rules requiring eye protective gear for all flights,
the Pentagon said yesterday. 

*****

As a result of the laser use, the Army rushed new protective equipment
last week to all U.S. helicopter crews. "The equipment provides laser
protection during both day and night operations," the statement said. 

*****

Local police in Bosnia and soldiers of the international Stabilization
Force, or Sfor, searched the town of Zenica and confiscated a pen-type
laser device, he said.

Military officials said the helicopter crew reported seeing inside the
cockpit a red dot believed to be a laser, which tracked the aircraft
for several minutes. 

*****

The last laser incident occurred in April 1997 during a Canadian
helicopter surveillance mission of a Russian freighter suspected of
spying on U.S. nuclear missile submarines near Washington\'s Puget
Sound. 

Canadian Armed Forces Capt. Pat Barnes and U.S. Navy Lt. Jack Daly, an
intelligence liaison officer, suffered permanent eye damage after a
flight to photograph the Russian ship Kapitan Man. 

A Pentagon investigation later determined the two men were injured by
a laser but were unable to confirm that it was fired by someone on the
ship.

Inacurrate.

Most of the F-117\'s over Baghdad never went below 10,000ft.

One tactic often thought effective by attack aircraft disproved by the war
in Iraq was the low and fast ground attack. Most of the time standoff
missiles and LGB\'s were launched at medium altitide at mid - subsonic
speeds. Once the area early warning radars were knocked out, most of the
short range radars that had the balls to go active were ineffective anyway
and the target never knew the planes were in the area until the big boom.

Good. I cant find my copy of Striker Book 2 right now, so we\'ll use yours.

First of all, a TL8 world with a Type D starport and 80 million people.
Assume it\'s Imperial, and that it splits it\'s 70% of it\'s 4% defense budget
70/30 between Navy and Army/Wet Navy.

Personell in the Navy are Long Service Professionals, paid for with local
credits. Equipment is imported from a B starport TL12 world.

Secondly, a TL 5 world with 10 million population and a type E starport.
Pretty unimpressive, huh. On the other hand, their interstellar trade is
goanna be pretty low, too, as their GWP in Imperial Credits is even worse.

Finally, a TL6, E starport world with 700 million people. Defense budget is
the same as the first world mentioned.

Cases One and Three should be able to mash a 400 ton pirate fairly
adequatly, and if they cant, well, what is stopping The Man Who Would Be
King ?

In either case, you will have enough local navy to quite adequately escort
any traders out to the 100 diameter limit. I can even imagine an honour
guard ...

David,

Steven Hudson on the TML quite rightly says we need to
define what a "backwater" system is before we try to talk
about system defense in backwater systems.

I\'d say a backwater system can be defined purely by its
ability to defend itself -- just as a rule of thumb or benchmark.

Arbitrarily, then, a system which cannot afford the payments on
one new 400t system defense boat is "backwater".  So, fix the
defense budget of a backwater world at under MCr2 per year.

A system which cannot afford one grav fighter is "wild".
Could you pretty please post this?

  So the out of system trade of a world like modern Earth isn\'t
worth the sub-sector (or higher) authorities trouble to protect?

  Big Backwater         C-xxx9xx-8   (P=8)

  GNP of TCr 6.4 (Cr 6.4 x10^12), but trade sufficiently low as to
be non-existent? OK, so uber-Albania* here is also populated by real
fools, so they spend only 3% on defense - BCr 192, of which BCr 64
goes straight to the Imperium where it\'s spent on dancing boys and
wine to no real purpose. 40% of the remainder is wasted on the local
ground force militia, leaving only BCr 76.8 for system space defenses.

  Using standard exchange ratios (Striker, although that not being 
real Traveller we\'ll use the identical [?] chart in TCS) that\'s less
than 22 BCr of TL C starships - call it 21 after transaction costs
incurred in dealing with those tricky off-worlders.

  This will maintain only BCr 105 of TL C warships (Striker), so we\'ll
buy these wogs at least 30 "Leaping Chihuahua" SDV\'s at MCr 1516.37 per.
Why they need starships is unclear, and why they spend over 50% of their
naval budget on marching bands and gold piping can only be attributed to
cultural oddities - but tourism is booming.

  Hopefully the math checks out OK?

  The alternative is to make it mostly based on comps (in the same way 
that a lack of a small craft bridge reduces its\' effective comp level
by one, IIRC), in which case all but the weirder fighters (3I heavy from
S:9) will be around trader capabilities, and SDB\'s will routinely have
sensors far superior to any HG pirate (excluding what amount to purpose-
built commerce raiders or warships).

  It looks simply like the CT sensor rules are too old to be of much use
except to gearhead-phobe campaigns (which I might run) and in roughing
out debates like this one - where at least it\'s easier to agree on than
Striker/MT/TNE/T4/DSR/GURPS ground rules...

  So you do realize that it\'s an official Classic Trav product (as much

Nahh. You gotta be able to carry them around for them to be battle riders.
:-) IIRC, in _Imperium_ monitors are big bastards that pack more punch than
a heavy cruiser.

Okay, I just dug out the box. Monitors carry a higher weapon and screen
factor than any cruiser in the game. No mention of actual tonnage, although
...

... as an interesting note _Imperium_ breaks ship types down into five
categories:

Support Ships: Transports, Tankers
Small Combatants: Scouts, Destroyers
Cruisers: Light, Strike, Heavy, and Attack (the difference between
   Strike and Attack being the primary armament type -- beam or
   missile).
Capital Ships: Dreadnoughts, Improved Dreadnoughts, Battleships,
   and Monitors
Special Ships: Missile Boats, Fighters, Motherships
   (i.e., fighter carriers)

Note that only Dreadnoughts, Battleships, and Monitors are considered
Capital Ships -- the primary distinction seeming to be that such vessels can
carry troops and are capable of surviving fire from planetary defenses.

I used to love to play this game solo -- although it didn\'t come with enough
counters in my experience.

Hmm. Here\'s another thing I noticed in a quick lookover. It says here that
the First Interstellar War "began when a Vilani trade caravan ignored Terran
traffic control signals."

The Terrans considered ignoring traffic control around worlds enough of an
offense to start a war over. And some people thought the 3rd Imperium was
strict ...

Unfortunately, I am on the TML, I run a small mail list called TAS to
support my PE campaign, and the mail I send to and from individual members
of this list and my players.

All in all, I have a lot of mail coming in that has Traveller written all
over it.  The bulk of which, admittably, is TML - but that makes the non-TML
mail that much more important to sort out!  :)

I do automate a lot of it - I was just hoping that I\'d be able to apply the
same rules (look for the TML on the subject line) to the TML mail.  I am
not, however, going to hold my breath and jump up and down if I can\'t get my
way!  :p

IMHO:

	Best case scenario:

The major powers have formed some kind of international organization, to
which each contributes national forces (e.g., the UN Space Agency at the
beginning of the Interstellar Wars, or Jerry Pournelle\'s CoDominium). 
This may eventually lead to a unified world government, at which point
the UWP code changes.

	Second-best-case scenario:

The various nations contribute to a system defense fund, which provides
for Imperial system defense forces (viewing the Imperium as an "honest
broker").

	Most likely scenario:

The arms race described above, possibly leading to an intraplanetary
war.

Does anybody have any other major scenarios?

My opinion is that the Imperium abitrates this (via the subsector Duke) by
assessing the taxes for the whole planet, and each government has to pay an
agreed upon portion. The percentage could be based on each countries GNP
compared to planetary total GNP. This money would then be spent for the
planetary defenses. If the countries can\'t (or won\'t) cooperate on which
shipyards to build the SDB\'s (or whatever ship designs are chosen); then the
Duke could pick a yard somewhere else (how much do you want to guess where
he/she picks?). Lastly; if the ships want to fight each other instead of
intruders; then the Duke could place HIS/HER crews onboard. The down side to
this, is that it seems too "hands on" for the Imperium (though Dulinor might
like this...).

At the game scale involved, 100mm of acceleration is equivalent to
1G in one turn (1000seconds). The paragraph above does not say how
long it takes the vac suit to provide the 100mm vector change, only that
it can produce a total of 100mm. There may very well be advanced

capable of more thrust, but I\'d not want to spend much time using one.
Vac suit fabric is a lot less safe than starship hull at any speed.

Ditzie\'s PA here.

The concept was a craft with a 400 MJ laser, with 4cm of Superdense armour,
capable of 4 gees for 4 hours.

It was basically about a 50 dton sphere, with a single 600 MJ spinal laser,
10 cm of superdense and a HEPLAR drive that pushed it at 4Gs for 4 hours. I
think it had a minimum-size auxilary set of t-plates and a sandcaster.

It was technically illegal, having Heplar but no conventional fusion plant,
and it used TAKAFP, so I\'m going to redesign it.

The basic concept is sound, though. And it\'ll still come in at under MCr 30.

I\'d personally imagine that the major states would each have some sort of
flotilla-to-fleet. I think they\'d each claim, and thus need to protect,
bits of the outsystem.

This is technically spam, but I\'m proud of it, so I\'ll repost it.

It\'s an attempt to go low-end, into the cheap, low-capability, mass end of
the market.

It\'s a police/customs launch ...

It\'s actually a modified version of the FS standard TL13 anti-shipping
missile (\'We have three basic loadouts ... det laser, combustion laser, and
auditor\').

OK. Here goes. Missile first, then we demonstrate how to modify it into a
customs launch (\'Get one auditor. Dice finely. Jam into warhead space\').

*********************************************************************

Famile Spofulam TL13 Standard Anti-Shipping Missile

1.633 m3 Adv Comp Lam (17.963t, KCr 13)

500 kkm TL12 Laser Commo (0.028 m3, 0.056t, KCr 56)

3 MW Fusion Plant (1m3, 3t, KCr 400)

3 MW TL 13 batteries (1.5 m3, 3.55t, KCr 12 - 56 mins output)

1200 kN HEPLAR engine (0.6 m3, 0.6 t, KCr 6)

4 hrs Heplar Fuel (3.6 m3, 0.3t)

400 MJ X-ray Laser (0.472 m3, 0.472t, KCr 48)

TL12 50 kkm Beam Pointer (2.667 m3, 2.667t, KCr 267)

1 shot/min evacuator (0.092 m3, 0.092t, KCr 46)

300 kg one-shot cartridge (0.3 m3, 0.3t, KCr 15) (assumes laser cartriges
cost Cr 25/MJ)

The whole thing costs KCr 688, masses 30 ton, and turns into a nice 11.2
m3 sphere (0.7 dtons, 2.78 m diameter) and pulls 4.0 gees for 2 hours. It
has Armour Factor 87, and is completely reliant on targeting from the
mother ship, having no integral sensors.

**********************************************************

OK. So we need to turn this into a Customs Launch. We have, IMO, up to 30
tons of mass to play with, and plenty of armour.

Inflate the beach ball shape to be 6 dtons (84 m3). The armour falls from
AF 87 to AF 22 (dont get shot at) (*Cue Ditzie Stage Left with massive air
pump*). 72 m3 to play with, to go with the 30t.

Add a TL12 Sens 12.5 PEMS (0.1 m3, 0.1t, KCr 500) (*Sounds of hammering*).

Add 2 TL12 CM 0.8/CP 1.25 Computers (0.04 m3, 0.008t, KCr 2) (*Sounds of
high-pitched whining about not being able to doooooooo anything*)

2 Workstations (14m3, 0.4t, KCr 5)

2 Bunks (28 m3, 1 t, KCr 2) <Mass includes 1 auditor and 1 beefy Marine
type *Can Iiiiiiii take the Marine-weeeeeeeny home wiiiith me ????*>

4 G Compensation (0.5 m3,0.25 t, KCr 25) <*But the mariiiiiine doesnt want
to play graaaav pong*>

Type III LS (0.4 m3, 0.4 t, KCr 30)

Extra 16 hours HFuel (14 m3, 1.0 t)

Standard airlock (3 m3, 0.2 t, KCr 5)

Sanitary Facility (3.5 m3, 0.2, KCr 1)

Extra 1.5 MW power (0.5 m3, 1.5t, KCr 100)

Total mass is therefore 34.3 t, total cost is KCr 1358 - call it a round
KCr 1360 including some nice chairs and fuzzy dice. It is capable of 3.5
gees for 20 hours.

Under normal operations, the Cutter will pull 2 Gees, as the full 3.5 gees
requires use of battery power.

Note that the small size of fusion plants at TL13 allows the use of
cheaper Heplar, rather than expensive T-plates.

Whilst technically capable of up to 2 weeks life support, most trips will
be a lot shorter. The pilot and gunner usually share one bunk, with the
marine and auditor sharing the other.

You could build a cargo version by eliminating the 2 bunks, and having 28
m3 of cargo space.

It\'s a lot cheaper than ships boats under previous Traveller design rules ...
taking the laser out cuts the cost by KCr 350, if you are really cheap.

Do you _really_ think that the Emperor is in the practice of handing out
his Imperial Power to just anyone without some control over who this
anyone is?

It is true that the "canon" Imperial Warrant shown in the Library Data
does not have a name on it.  However this may be so that spys (who will
not necessarily be using their own name) can use them.  I think that
almost all Imperial Warrants come in _envelopes_ with the bearers name
on them.  I think the warrent Norris used was in an envelope (of
Imperial Stationary) saying "The Duke of Regina" on it.  It seems to me
that if anyone, especially a Noble, uses the Emperors power when they do
not have permission to do so that this is a flat out, no questions
asked, case of Treason.  This is the sort of thing that if you do it you
end up dead somewhere, the only question is if they do it legally to
make an example of you for others or if you just vanish.

The notion that you can just use an Imperial Warrent you happen to find
and not expect to be considered to be treasonasly usurping the Emperors
power is dangerously naive.  That is why I suggested that the Warrent
was origionally intended for his Father and said "The Duke of Regina" on
it.  I know that Norris\'s use of it was for the good of the Imperium but
I just do not see it as a good idea for the Emperor to let people
(especially Nobles who represent a greater threat of Civil War) use
their power uncontrollably.

If Norris had just picked up someone elses Imperial Warrent and used it
I would expect that Strephon would have had him killed in a way that
made it look like an accident.  I would also expect that this is more or
less what Norris would expect as well.

And how will the pirate know the Merchie has yelled, seeing as said merchie
has a tightbeam transeiver? Note that the victim will yell for help to the
homeworld, leaving the problem of finding the SDB to them.

The SDB doesn\'t need to be at GQ for a near instant response to a call.
When the call comes in the Officer of the Watch sets the course as he
informs the Captain. The CO says "go for them" and off they go. GQ can be
called as you go, as it\'s going to be at least an hour before the SDB is in
sensor or gun range.

Can I ask what, if anything, is wrong with the Type T Patrol Cruiser? At
MCr221.04 with two triple lasers and two triple missle turrets it seems
like a nice reasonably cheap patrol vessel. And for something a bit bigger
how about a Mercenary Cruiser? With guns etc they go at about MCr500, and
with eight turrets to play with they should be able to have pirate-critical
capable batteries installed.

I reckon that HG is at least a pretty close second - Ships can now be up to
200 times bigger than before and have armour. Jump distance is directly
limited by TL (in the LBBs computer size and drive size are limited by TL,
and they limit jump range, but TL12 allows you J6, IIRC). HG introduced
Thrusters, whereas the LLBs could be read either way. HG also introduced
agility as a concept and energy weapons PAWs, etc, all of which
dramatically changed the optimal way to design a ship.

Actually Striker made a fair mess, too. Before Striker it took a real
expert to penetrate Combat Armour with a laser.

This reminds me - Were battery power densities increased in FF&S2? I tried
to make a battery supplemented laser with FF&S! and rapidly found that
unless it only had to fire for a very short period a Fusion plant and fuel
was smaller than the battery and would power it for months. Of course the
battery was very cheap.

IIRC there has been a fair bit of research into diseases that cause very

How similar are these circular PAW rules to Merrick\'s? Using his I made a
very \'entertaining\' BB based on a spherical 500kDT hull with a circular PAW
wrapped around it. IMO anything like that really changes the PAW/Meson Gun
balance (unless MGs can be done like this too, of course).

The climate was rather warmer up until the end of the medieval period. The
century with the 100 years war and the plague (15th, I think) started with
three consecutive crop failures, and the climate got colder and wetter from
there. IIRC the coldest point was in the 1700s, when you could skate across
the Thames at London in winter.

I\'ve always assumed that there are some really big SDBs out there. For one
you need them if the invader has Tigeress\' or 25000DT \'riders. For another
how else does a system spend its defense budget?

There\'s your justification right there - the Type Ms that will be visiting
and their predators.

BTW a world with a UWP of D555555-5 (dead average for a type \'D\' starport)
will have a peacetime naval budget in TCS of: 500*0.95*500,000 (assuming a
pop multiplier of 5) = local MCr237.500. If they do their buying at a TL12
(pretty averge TL for a type "A" starport) world not too far away they\'ll
have TL12 MCr97.794. I belive it\'s normal to assume the Striker rule for
off-world equipment in these cases, so maintenence will run to 20% of the
ship\'s value per year, giving us a total fleet value of TL12 MCr488.971.
This should be enough for a couple of Patrol Cruisers, though I suppose in
HG these are TL13, seeing as they have J4. It certainly should buy a
cut-down patrol ship and a squadron of low-grade fighters suitable for
sensor sweeps along a 100d planetary boundary.

I once played a fair bit of Star Cruiser (2300AD\'s space combat system) and
found that in general with the middle period ships sensor ranges weren\'t
that short. Earlier on they were \'cause the sensors were crap, and later
because fast det-laser missiles were the main punch. However even then we
never found the sensor ranges to be too short, in actual fact we found the
playing area to be too small to allow attempts to flank a squadron without
getting locked up.

Mainland Europe may have, but I\'m fairly sure that England didn\'t until
after WWII. They had a big problem arming the Home Guard during the early
stages of WWII because the plans they had all assumed the populace would
have guns, but they\'d all been turned in and destroyed in the \'20s.

I\'m not entirely sure this is true. New Zealanders have a lot of guns,
there is a lot of wilderness and our military is small and very under
equipped. No tanks, not many artillery pieces and an Army of under 10,000
for a population of 3.5 million.

I reckon that HG is at least a pretty close second - Ships can now be up to
200 times bigger than before and have armour. Jump distance is directly
limited by TL (in the LBBs computer size and drive size are limited by TL,
and they limit jump range, but TL12 allows you J6, IIRC). HG introduced
Thrusters, whereas the LLBs could be read either way. HG also introduced
agility as a concept and energy weapons PAWs, etc, all of which
dramatically changed the optimal way to design a ship.

Actually Striker made a fair mess, too. Before Striker it took a real
expert to penetrate Combat Armour with a laser.

I read somewhere (I\'ll try an find it later) that most estimates of
fatalities (which are the same as what you have here) in the 150-300 rem
range are probably way too optimistic because they were taken from
populations that had reasonable medical care. The conclusion of this study
was that without medical care doses as low as 150-200 rems could well have
death rates of 50%.

Actually the blasted things are not the same. The Striker one is much
steeper and thus rather more punitive to low tech worlds than the TCS one.
I use the TCS table because it is repeated in TNE, whereas the Striker
doesn\'t (to the best of my knowledge) appear anywhere else.

I dont know if battery power density has increased, but it is kind of OK
under FFS2. The problem is the second hour of combat - generally, you only
have juice for short combat durations (although for vehicles, 5 minute
output batteries are great for powering honking big lasers. Accumulators
are the bitch, but you link the batteries to a small chemical or similar
power plant to recharge the batteries for the next 5 minutes of hell).

The big advantage of batteries is their low cost - about one tenth of the
cost of fusion. 

The Abomination Known As Fusion Plus completely out-competes Batteries, of
course. And fusion, for combat use.

Finally, I think you can build a completely battery-powered starship at
TL15, but it\'s very much \'mad scientist\' type stuff ...

  Well, long-term military budgets do go up to 15% from the 3% CT average,
and international tension is listed as a great cause.

  No idea, but in HG only the 36 EP/Dt Jump drive accumulators worked
worth a damn, and under Striker those were physically impossible. My
recommendation to a CT campaign would be to ignore the 36/t units and
try and handwave a weapon throughput of less than 252mw/sec for beam
lasers (which may mean addressing fusion plant outputs, which would at
least help reduce the "my ship is _melting_" problem).

I have to agree with this.

IMO, if you have a backwater planet and you want to increase trade,
the number one priority is to stop piracy within 100D of the mainworld
(and possibly in a known volume of space out to the 100D of the Star).

The subsidy cost of some Type Ms would almost certainly be better spent
on fighters or SDBs (depending on how many vessels were deemed necessary).

The dear old Type A can be quite economical on very low trade levels [1],
especially if it can put passengers in the gunner\'s bunks and isn\'t
paying off the cost of triple laser turrets or replenishing a dozen
missiles every trip.

[1] That means "very low trade levels for the planet".
You might well need 100% of the cargo hold full but that\'s only about 80dton.
80dton per fortnight per destination is not a lot of cargo.

That\'s up to you, of course, but I\'d like to point out that it isn\'t "just"
a band-aid fix made up by me. It relies on a canonical reference that you
just happen not to know of. I dug it up last night and here it is:

REF 3.6: _Spinward Marches Campaign_ p. 11 says: "Norris appealed directly
to the Emperor of the Imperial forces in the Marches [...] Although the
Emperor responded by issuing a warrant which put Norris in command, it was
lost en route; due to the distances and transit times involved, the very
existence of the document remained unknown." And on p. 16 it further says:
"Norris, with some slight evidence that his warrant from the Emperor was on
Algine (aboard a wrecked cruiser down on the planet), led a secret expedition
to that interdicted world to recover the document. The quandary that faced
Norris was that he was prohibited from going to the interdicted world of
Algine without the express permission of the Emperor. The warrant, if it was
there, would be permission to go there; if it wasn\'t there, he risked his
career." 

So you have two mutually exclusive versions of the story (the warrant can\'t
both be on the KINUNIR and the wrecked cruiser on Algine, right?) where one
version contains serious problems (as you pointed out) and the other not
only contains no contradictions but is also the original version. IMO I\'ve
seldom seen a clearer choice. YMMV.

Personally I think it extremely unlikely that the Emperor would make out
Imperial Warrants that weren\'t both personal (not just "The Duke of Regina"
but "Norris Xxxxxx Xxxxxx Aledon, 13th (or whatever number Norris\' dad had)
Duke of Regina" and time-limited in some way (though the limit could be
quite large given the transit times of the Imperium).

BTW. just to add a reference: _Travellers\' Digest_ #18 says that Emperor
strephon delegated war power to Duke Norris of Regina during the FOURTH
Frontier War, more than a decade before our Norris became duke. This can
be explained by assuming that Norris\' father was named Norris too. It fits
with Peter\'s "Norris retrieved his father\'s warrant" story, but it also
fits with the other story. It gives a reason why Norris might think that
the Emperor would give war powers to a junior duke (IMO the dukedoms of
Mora, Lunion, and Rhylanor are all senior to Regina); there was a
precedent (So why did Norris\' DAD get his war powers? Maybe he was a
Grand Admiral in his own right?) Anyway, it makes for a nice bit of
historical continuity.

Power, an energy point (EP) is equal to 250MW.

According to pg 13, MT Starship Operator\'s Manual, under Jumping 
Within A Gravity Well, starships can jump out of a gravity well, 
although it is extremely dangerous to do so within 10d, and difficult 
within 100d.  If a jump vector plots an emergence within 100d, the 
starship _violently_ emerges at the 100d limit.  Under Flight 
Controls, earlier in the book, Jump Vectors are plotted based on 
origin and destination point, relative velocities of the systems, 
velocity of the vessel and exact time of entry.  This implies the 
following, IMO:

1)  Navigators can determine a jump point outside the 100d limit of a 
gravity well.  Therefore starships don\'t have to emerge at 100d if 
the navigator wants to emerge further out.

2)  As the words "gravity well" imply, the source of the well doesn\'t 
have to be a planet.  It can be a star, a black hole, or a very large 
starship.  (Brings to mind the concept of an Ancient space-trap that 
protects a system by producing an intense gravity well, pulling 
starships out of jumpspace before they can get to the original 
Ancient base.  Trapped in a derelict space yard, hmmm, "The Bermuda 
Quadrant", hmmm.)

3)  While there is no direct corrollary between normal space and jump 
space, intense gravity wells do have some impact on the emergence 
point of a starship.  Apparently, if the emergence point is located 
within the gravity well, then jump space displaced the vessel into 
the nearest point in normal space at the 100d limit of a gravity 
well.  This relocation phenomenon may be what causes the violence of 
the eruption into normal space.  (This assumption allows referees to 
not worry about vectors of approach and whether there are three stars 
between the jump\'s origin and destination.  However, it doesn\'t quite 
deal with the black hole statement on empty hexes.  Further 
extrapolation in this area could imply that the intense gravity well 
is so strong that it not only warps normal space [blue event 
horizon], but that it also impacts jump space levels, too.)

Does this help?

  As far as the news agencies go, GIGO. I remember the military history
types around campus having a good laugh back then, as though a 120mm rifle
sniping off a stationary target at 4000m on a giant billiard table was in
some way relevant.

  And of course the quiet desperation of seeing yet another text doing
something moronic like referring to a fitters vehicle as a "tank".

In all actuality, I believe that Jump Range Limits _are_ based on 
Tech Level, according to the following progression:

TL  9 = Jump 1
TL  11 = Jump 2
TL  12 = Jump 3
TL  13 = Jump 4
TL  14 = Jump 5
TL  15 = Jump 6

That progression is taken from the drive TL limits in High Guard.
The original CT drive performance limits were a bit more complex.
Drives were assigned a letter code, A to Z. For each letter code,
the maneuver, jump and power plants had a certain cost and tonnage,
regardless of what ship you put them in. There was a table you used,
cross referencing ship tonnage with drive letter to get performance.
For example, a code-A jump drive would give you jump-2 in a 100dtn
hull, but only jump-1 in a 200dtn hull.

The tech level you could build the drives at was based on the letter code,
not the final performance. Thus a code-A jump drive, available at TL9,
could give you jump-2 performance if the ship was small enough.

Just to make things more interesting, High Guard gave you the option
of using the CT drives in your starships. In a game where ships range
upwards of 100,000dtns, the drives used in 5000tn and under starships
(5ktns was the hull size limit in CT) may not have mattered so much.
Still, this does allow a navy to build some small ships that perform
better than their large ones - especially nice when you want to build
some scouts or couriers.

In Trillion Credit Squadron, they provide squadron parameters - guidelines
for jump, maneuver, refueling needs and number of pilots so two players
can take the same budget and make comparable fleets. One of the
parameters calls for jump-6, maneuver-6 at TL15. Under strict High Guard,
such a ship is impossible - there\'s just no way to fit the computer and
crew spaces (forget about weapons and defenses) in the 2% of hull
space left after drives, bridge and fuel. With book-2 Code-X drives
(in a 1000dtn hull) and code-Z drives (in a 2000dtn hull) you can pull
it off - I even managed to fit a nuclear dampener and some armor
on an agility-1 1500dtn Battlecruiser that could meet this performace
criterion, and for less than a billion credits.

IMHO:

     Best case scenario:

The major powers have formed some kind of international organization, to
which each contributes national forces (e.g., the UN Space Agency at the
beginning of the Interstellar Wars, or Jerry Pournelle\'s CoDominium).
This may eventually lead to a unified world government, at which point
the UWP code changes.

     Second-best-case scenario:

The various nations contribute to a system defense fund, which provides
for Imperial system defense forces (viewing the Imperium as an "honest
broker").

     Most likely scenario:

The arms race described above, possibly leading to an intraplanetary
war.

Does anybody have any other major scenarios?

     Scenario Three

The Major powers of the world combine money and hire a mercenary unit to
patrol the system.  Great set-up for a campaign the party of PC\'s are
members of the Mercenary unit that has been hired to protect this planet
from pirate raiders.  Another thread could be the PC\'s are members of one
of the Major powers (Armed forces?) and have discovered that the Mercenary
unit hired by the planet are actually working with the pirate raiders.  How
can they stop the Mercenaries and raiders, while avoiding certain death
from more advanced weapons?  Lots of fun to be had by all.

I think a better term might be "gearhead-challenged" campaign.  I\'m not

Please recall that the first two days of Desert Sabre were fought in a
howling rain/sandstorm that cut visbibility down to less than 200m in
places.  Part of the reason we caught the Iraqis so off-guard was their
disbelief that anyone could operate in those conditions.  M1A1s were
picking off T-72s in prepared fighting positions before the enemy ever knew
they were there.

Good point, but I\'d argue that the shunting of all emissions to
capacitors is stealth.  If you can\'t see me (and unfortunately I can\'t
see you) I\'m stealthed.  If I\'m coming in on a running jump, and have
full BG protection upon exiting you won\'t see me until I drop my
globe....  Somehow they take all that energy and capture it...

Most of the allied aircraft that went down where the runway busters.  Planes
that were forced to fly straight level at a fairly low altitude over a
runway to drop
cluster munitions.  First cratering munitions, then anti-personnel mines to
keep 
people from fixing the craters.

These weren\'t A-10\'s, so they couldn\'t handle the level of ground fire.

There\'s another SPINWARD MARCHES CAMPAIGN reference in the map section
that claims that administration of Jewell subsector is done from Regina
due to Jewell\'s proximity to the border.  I agree that Mora and Rhylanor
are senior to Regina, and Lunion and Glisten might be.  But the Duke of
Regina is the highest point of nobility adjacent to the Zhodani border,
and is the reasonable leader on the spot who might need that much power 
and might be trusted to wield it.

The Imperial Warrant does have a few limits -- remember, the emperor is
watching, probably closely.  The consequences of abusing a Warrant are
potentially quite extreme.

_Striker_ is as much a mainstream Traveller (Classic edition) ruleset as

If you have a BG at no flicker, then you are indeed stealthy. A
flickering BG might have shielding advantages, but as I see it is
probably brighter during the times when the BG is off.

Perhaps BG ships need either a special set of radiators, or we need
to let them get rid of some amount of energy into jump space.  They
are really screwed up the more I think about it.

Yes, but one question.

When you write "mass of drive in dT", do you mean volume in dT? Or do you
intend to use the figure drive mass based on volume dT x 10T (civilian), dT
x 30T (military)?

This is unclear to my small brain.

IIRC, they were (mostly) Tornadoes (IMHO, the best ground attack aircraft
in the world). There may have been a Jaguar in there too, although I don\'t
remember and my resources are at home.

I don\'t think even A-10\'s would have handled the level of ground fire those
planes were asked to go through.

They\'re more or less the same. They needed some tweaking a I recall.
Like the stock FFS laser design rules, some limit on DE is probably
in order. The purpose was to allow bay and barbette PAWs to mimic
our old CT favorites. I wouldn\'t expect them to take damage very
well, however (trash part of the accelerator and the beam won\'t stay
in the cyclotron).

I had thought that since the energy requirements went up as laps^2
(from memory, I don\'t have it here) big ones would rapidly become
hard to power. Of course the simple benifits of adding to the tunnel
length with a couple laps doesn\'t seem unreasonable.

The trick is to make sure it has a trade off (easier to damage, in
this case).

Or perhaps that is one of the things that confounds the scientific
community of the late 3I in that they can\'t figure out what happens to
the energy...  "Damned Ancients... Why didn\'t they leave the Owner\'s

Seems everybody hates A10\'s cause they\'re not \'sexy\' enough to fly.

Tell that to the A10 drivers that returned to base unharmed with their planes

advantages.

The F117\'s doing attack runs *outside* of Baghdad were WAY under 10,000 feet.  
What do you think took out those Iraqi radars?  And the Iraqis never seen \'em

Hmm....maybe the Imperium has a policy of eventually getting the racalcitrant
(in the Imperium\'s eyes) countries to join up via carrot and/or stick. This
would seem to follow Cleon\'s Manifest Destiny. I can\'t see the Imperium
allowing non aligned nations to get  "freebee" system protection, unless the
world/system was vital enough that they had to protect the system with partial
taxes. This would also mean that the non Imperial world would have to have
enormous political juice, or the Imperium would no doubt try to replace the
current government with a more pliable one. All of these games would have to
be done very carefully; the Imperium has to balance between not being seen as
either weak (letting governments stand them off), or overbearing (getting
caught manipulating non Imperial countries)...

this political intrigue makes good adventure nuggets...

kinetic and electromagnetic energy, and shunts that energy into a 
capacitor.  If the capacitor(s) reach their maximum, then they 
explode, more than likely taking the ship with them.  During 
non-combat or emergency scenarios, it would be assumed that the 
energy from the capacitors would be "bled off" through heat sinks or 
some alternate form of radiator.

The effect on sensors:  ships with BGs would not register while the 
globe was on, although indirect means might be used to locate one.  
(It would be like looking for a "cold" spot instead of a "hot" spot.) 
 When the glode is off, the increase in energy storage would appear 
as an increase in the energy measured from the vessel (since it 
wasn\'t in the capacitors before the globe was activated), though the 
amount stored may not be significant in the overall energy matrix of 
the vessel.  (Although if it\'s going to destroy the vessel, it should 
be pretty noticable toward the end, if the globe is off at some point 
near the critical point.)

Assumably, the Ancients dealt with this through shunting the excess 
energy into either jump space (as suggested by others on the list), 
or into their anti-matter power system, somehow prolonging the life 
of their anti-matter power supply.  (I like this one better, but I 
don\'t know much about the physics of either jump space or anti-matter 
enough to guess which would be better.)

All of the above is based on memory, and I don\'t have any referential 
evidence to back it up at this time.  My apologies, if I 
misremembered any of the details.  Still, I hope it helps.

The other major advantage of circular PAWs is the fact that their
accumulator is based on lap energy*10.

This means raising the number of laps just slows down the rate of fire -
you can keep the same power input, and keep the unit at the same size.

Of course, output with a CPAW is the square root of the number of laps
times lap energy, and damage is a square-root funtion of the output, so it
goes exponential pretty fast.

Now, CPAWs do have shorter ranges than PAWs, but big PAWs have a
sufficiently obscene range to trade off and smile (you really dont need a
range of more than 5 light-seconds for most applications).

Some day soon, FS is going to come out with a CPAW module designed to fit
into the cargo bay of the Recollet ...

I\'m toying with GT and there seem to be some
inconsistencies with the skills, especially around
Mechanic/Engineering/Elec Ops.

I am not a heavy GURPS user (at least not yet,
although the GT line may tip me over the edge)
so I was wondering if anyone can tell me...

1. What specialisations are there for these skills?
   There seems to be a different set every place I
   look, maybe that\'s me not understanding how it
   hangs together.

2. What\'s the difference between Engineer (J-Drive)
   and Mechanic (J-Drive), apart from one has a
   default and the other doesn\'t?

   (The scoutship writeup has the crew needing both
   but the Scout template only gives you mechanic,
   I\'m assuming this is because they were written
   by different people?)

3. Why do you need Tactics to fly a Free Trader?

Andy, I have no idea about questions 1 and 2, but as for #3?  It\'s

Nah, it\'s not exactly consistent.  Use whatever breakdowns you prefer to annoy
your players with.  There\'s a list in Basic, however.

Engineer is the skill to _design_ jump drives, mechanic is the skill to repair
them.  GURPS isn\'t wildly consistent about this distinction, however.

You don\'t unless you want to fly it in combat.

Powerful argument for labelling the envelopes and/or Warrants. Not a bad
idea.

Alternatively, this could explain what Norris meant in SM when he said
Strephon was still around back then and could burn him if he screwed up
("abusing the Emperor\'s powers"). This means that the
"labelled-vs-unlabelled Warrant" could come down to "your choice" unless
Messieurs Dougherty or Miller "give us the goss" on the subject.

Hans said:

Thanks for the SM reference, I should have remembered that one (bang!).

Here\'s a thought on that subject: maybe Strephon trusts the Duke of Regina
more than the others? It could be that he met Norris\' father sometime (or
went through the U of Sylea together)? Or maybe the trust is based on the
old family connections noted in the RSB! The RSB says that Arbellatra left
the Duke of Regina - actually, he may have only been a Count at that stage
- - in charge of the Marches when she left to knock a few heads together in
the Imperial Core. Now I think about it, I seem to remember she elevated
him to Duke after becoming Regent. And he was of the Family Aledon...

Inaccurate -

The RAF Tornados flew very low and very fast when using the JP233 to take
out runways. Shame that the government (at the time) had discounted
building a standoff version as not cost effective.

Just because the USAF/USN/US Marines weren\'t doing it doesn\'t mean that it
wasn\'t being done.

You don\'t really get to understand low and fast until you see a Tornado go
down a valley below you.

IIRC the LBBs don\'t specify the TL you are building at in anyway means or

Fair point on Thrusters but it didn\'t really change the effect in the same
way that TNE did - you weren\'t fuel limited in the same way. I think that
the key is that the weapons etc are better because Bk2 is a civilian design
system and Bk5 is military. The existance of fusion drives or fusion guns
or PAs didn\'t change the universe fundamentally from what had gone before -
it opened it up. TNE did by eliminating weapons.

On the same basis that you are arguing you could say that Bk4 etc flawed
Traveller because it introduced weapons beyond lasers and TL8 style
slugthrowers.

Canon is not necessarily bad (I for example have no problem with HePLAR but
do have a problem with Thrusters being ruled out after more than ten years
in the game. T4\'s co-existance was better). However, changes to the game
like those made eliminating Thrusters change the feel of the game and
exclude chunks of what has gone before. Canon should be added to (by its
nature) and shouldn\'t suddenly be restricted arbitarily.

Tech level is not mentioned in the tables at all with respect to drives. (*)

Hence if it isn\'t specified you can\'t really state \'a code-A jump drive,
available at TL9\' because \'a code-A jump drive, unavailable at TL9\' is
equally valid. HG did not invalidate this.

Sorry - my brain drifted into engineer mode with respect to \'mass\' - I
meant volume ie the dT of the drive.

Hence -

Hence fuel required = (turns of operation wanted) x 0.0225 x (vol of drive
in dT)/13.5

EP output = 0.2 x (vol of drive in dT)

If it\'s of interest, I can take a look at the other drives (eg ion...)

I have to agree with you here. Being a red blooded American I am often booed
when I voice my frustration that we would build the f-15E when we could have
probably purchased Tornadoes.
Yeah, both are good planes, but the Tornado gets the job done very well.

    'body' => 'Heyo!

There has been a lot of discussion about the 100d limit, including some
discussion on jumps directly from a planet surface, and from inside an
atmosphere.

[shudder]

This is a BAD THING and should only be done in extreme emergency.  Like,
when the primary is going NOVA.  (not about to...it still might not.  You
should wait until the wave front has actually hit the side of the planet and
shows every sign of coming around to where you are - even then you might
have a better chance of surviving if you ride it out.)

OK, ok - there are no hard rules on the subject, other than saying automatic
misjump or giving a really nasty DM, but this is my interpretation...

Assumptions:
1) Lanthanum grids on the outside of the ship.  Canon has a distinctive glow
produced by these grids just prior to initiating a jump and while exiting a
jump.

2) Lots of power needed for a jump - one version of the rules even defines a
\'fast plant\' to feed the drive, but I think we all agree that the J-Drive
consumes a massive amount of power to (at least) cause a Jump.

3)  That a large percentage of the power required for the jump is actually
dumped on the grid to create the field.

So, what happens when we push a lot of power through a conductor?  To
simulate, I\'m going to take a known conductor (I don\'t happen to have any
Lanthanum laying around) - in this case a tungsten alloy, and, to simulate
space conditions, it will placed in an evacuated glass globe.  Power will be
supplied via conductors that are prepositioned in the metal cap -  the one I
have obtained has a screw-type connector to ensure a stable, secure
connection to my selected test bed.  Ideally, I would conduct this
experiment in 0-G, but my G-plates are not functioning today...

So, I power up my experiment.  Power flows through the filiment, and because
of the resistance and the wire gage, it generates heat and light (is my desk
lamp now going to jump???).

Anyway, let\'s simulate powering up the grid in an atmosphere, and put a
small hole at the base of the bulb and turn it on.  ...Well, that was a nice
flash!  Not much left of the gri... I mean filiment tho\'.

If this is a scenario that you agree with, it also helps explain the cost of
the annual maintenance - replating and restoring the grid.

For the sceptics (and those who can\'t agree with me when I say the sun rises
in the west ;) another possibility - Again assuming that the power of the
grid is sufficient to cause the metal to generate *lots* of light and heat
(I\'m assuming that the grid is well insulated from the ship, and thus does
not cause internal damage) - metal tends to soften when it\'s hot.  And while
activating the grid well outside a gravity well, or at least in
microgravity, will tend not to affect it, subjecting it to a full gravity
well and causing it to have to support it\'s own weight (at least on the
underside of the ship) while also making it ...ummmm... supple?  Well, that
may cause permanent distortion of the grid - and may require a shipyard
visit - assuming that the warpage of the J-field is not sufficient to cause
a misjump or a J-space hull breach.

And the final possibility I\'d like to offer - Heating up some metals can
cause them to become, I believe the word is promiscuous?  They bond to any
stray molecules that come their way.  Firing up the J-drive in an atmosphere
will allow your grid to come into contact with lots and lots of stray
molecules - and suddenly instead of a lanthanum grid, you have a lanthanum
*alloy* grid.

Now THAT should give an Astrogator grey hair!  :)

AH-1 Apachies and F-4G Weasles took out the radars. First night of the war,
the frontline radars were flooded with TALD packages then hit with HARM
missiles.

Love those anti-radiation missiles.

BTW, I do not recall any F-117\'s sent to targets anywhere other than
greater Bahgdad

Even without the sandstorm, M1A1\'s main armaments are around 3 miles VS the

Sounds like a great job for a cruise missile or for a remote piloted
drone. You crash the thing into the runway at the end of the run.

Weapon idea for mercs attacking lower tech enemies:

A package that is either part of a drone aircraft, or lobbed in via
ballistic missile. A chute or balloon deploys at *high* altitude. This
lets the package float down while your aircraft are making an attack.
It fires some sort of guided munition (steerable shell or rocket) at
any AA site that is observed.

It might even be possible to skip the ballon or chute and just use some
sort of MIRV setup. That is, a missile with a *lot* of AA-seeking
submunitions deployed from the bus at high altitude.

Sounds similar in principle, if not in execution, to the TACIT RAINBOW
project I read about in *unclassified* sources.  A loitering
anti-radiation missile.  _Deeply_ unpleasant!

Even better (from the attacker\'s point of view) would be a loitering
missile, carrying a deep-penetration warhead, with a seeker head
designed to pick up stray meson emissions from deep meson sites....

Neither skills or required specializations are a closed list.
The books have the ones that people saw the need for, but a
GM is free to add any they want.

I did think it would have been nice to have a list of all the ones that
a player needs to worry about in the GT setting.  What you can
do is look at all the ones in Basic and then add in any that don\'t
see the list as covering.

(There maybe a comprehensive list of the ones that have been
decided so far, since Basic was written, someplace.  I\'ll look.)

Mechanics fix them.  Engineers design/build them.

You don\'t.  It may appear in some template on the premise that
it would be nice to be able to have some idea what to do if someone
attacks or threatens you.

Actually, medieval farmers were quite innovative. Look at the husbandry
manuals written during the middle ages - you keep finding phrases that
basically say "try it and you\'ll see that I\'m right". Ploughing
techniques, fertilizers, crops...

Farming was _the_ industry during that period. Your average knight
probably knew as much about farming as he did about fighting (although he
had peasants to do the gruntwork and a steward to supervise, he was still
expected to know what was going on).

I could dig out references this weekend if you like, but not until the
weekend...

Precisely the change that makes an interesting alternate history. 
Possibly an earlier Rennaissance or Industrial Revolution? They had a lot
of technology waiting to \'explode\' - with more manpower something might
have happened. Alternately, that\'s a lot of men who can be full-time
soldiers. Imagine medieval conscript armies.

The difference goes back further than that.

The USA was founded on the principle of "life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness"(1).

Canada was founded on "peace, order, and good government".

That philosophical difference has shaped both countries.  Also remember
that for years the Loyalists were extremely influential in Canadian
politics. The stories of what happened to some of them after the rebellion
are chilling, and explain why they emphasized different values. 


(1) I\'ve always liked the cartoon that has Ben Franklin writing "pursuit

Hm? I was referring to stuff that Marc had the copyright for, such as the
GDW material. He requires that you include his copyright notice and the

to photocopy out-of-print sourcebooks.

Mind you, I\'m not advocating wholesale copying here. Simple courtesy (let

permission first.  I\'m just pointing out that he\'s a reasonable chap.

Without igniting a gun control debate (something I\'d like to avoid, as I
fall firmly in the "compromise" camp and have no desire to be attacked
from two sides), could we agree that the arming of civilian starships is
as much a cultural as a military phenomenon? 

After all, if _all_ starship weapons are illegal then finding pirates
becomes much easier, as they must hide their weapons, turret fittings,
fire control systems...

Considering two Traveller human cultures:

Zhodani: see no need for armed civilians, because the very existence of
armament means a deviant who gets a visit from the Thought Police -
possession of armament is thus tatamount to declaring your intent to pirate

Imperials: don\'t see why anyone would want to disarm a starship, because
space is dangerous (frontier cultural leftover from the Consolidation Wars)

Viewed this way, the right to arm a starship, while not necessarily
formally declared, is taken as a given by the Imperial culture. Even
owners who wouldn\'t actually arm a ship would want one with hardpoints, to
demonstrate that they _could_ if they wanted to. The level of pirate
activity (whatever it is) is accepted as "the way things are" and whether
or not eliminating armamnets would help is not seriously considered by
anyone important*.

*For one thing, once you have large quantities of arms out there,
de-arming a population is tricky unless you can provide very good
security, as the arms _will_ be needed for protection by the honest
citizens.


PS. I don\'t think you\'re a homicidal maniac, but I don\'t feel my
government has a monopoly on violence either. I\'m far _more_ worried about
Cretien signing the MAI than I am about him sending in the tanks - but
that\'s a separate debate.

Oddly enough, I\'ve run virtually every adventure type _except_ mercenary
adventures. 

- - tramp trader
- - merchant prince
- - trade pioneer
- - scouting unknown systems
- - recontact
- - first contact
- - espionage
- - crime spree
- - rock band tour
- - subsector-level diplomacy

While never adhering perfectly to canon, I stuck pretty close. Admittedly
the diplomatic campaign drifted away from official events, but that would
happen in any universe that _had_ official events.

If things aren\'t mapped out, then those of us with little free time have
to spend more time working on details (and less time writing Traveller
software, designing ships, and so forth).

Mind you, I really dislike the "lets create background without adventures"
school of Traveller writing. Remember the types who would roll up whole
sectors by hand, but couldn\'t/didn\'t write any descriptions beyond a name?
This is pointless detail. 

So what\'s good detail?

Check out one of the world articles from MegaTraveller Journal. A really
detailed system/mainworld, with a complete adventure set on the world and
scads of adventure seeds. Now THAT\'S the way to usefully expand Traveller
canon.

Check out any of the numerous ship design archives. Piles of ships,
designed using standard rules, ready to drop into anyone\'s campaign.
Again, useful canon. (Well, canon in the sense that as long as a ship is
designed according to canon rules the ship itself is a canon design.)

No one\'s stopping you from writing another universe, that incorporates
part of the Traveller background. Hell, I\'d like to see Eris\' universe
appear someday (possibly as a Pyramid article hint hint hint). There\'s no
reason we can\'t have many Traveller universe, as long as we keep clear
whoch one we\'re discussing.

Hm. The Paratime Theory of Traveller, anyone?

Write to Marc (or whoever the copyright holder is) and ask for permission,
then post a request here. I\'m certain you\'ll find someone willig to make

free, but if you want all of the MegaTraveller Imperial Encycopedia you\'ll
have to pay my Kinko bill and postage.)

There are (or were) some areas left basically untouched for referees. Mind
you, this means that there will _never_ be canon material there, so in one
sense it\'s the same as deciding to ignore canon in a region...

True. It\'s just that knowing what canon is means that you already know the
tinkering. Think of "canon" as a common language.

You\'re probably right. I\'m just arguing for a common language. 

I kud rite fonetikalee and u kud undirstand mee, but it\'s a lot less work
for you if I follow the generally accepted rules of English.  It\'s the
same thing for canon.

Once again, I\'ll reiterate that I LIKE hearing about variants. I\'d just
like to have all variants clearly labelled as such. I\'d also like all
"official" material to be self-consistent.

Well I was just responding to a previous post in that spirit.

Yes he did and it is a good thing that the Kinunir did not have its

There are also several chemical agents developed for riot control that
may be of interest.

An agent that lowers blood pressure. The effect is that you feel
light-headed and, if you don\'t sit down, you eventually pass out. And
after a while, the folks sitting down have to lie down or pass out. 
From then until it starts to wear off, you have to lie flat on your
back or pass out. And if you get overly excited, you pass out. 

An agent that affects the voluntary muscles. It works its way up the
spinal cord. So first your feet quit working (it\'s hard to balance when
your toes don\'t work). Next the ankles go, forcing a sort of squat.
Then you have to sit as the lower legs quit working. Then the trunk,
and arms go. Finally, you are again lying down, and unable to do
anything except lay there and maybe talk. 

Then we get to agents that don\'t do anything to people, but change the
environment. Smoke is the classic example. It denies visibility. 

"Liquid banana peel" is only of use on hard surfaced areas, but in
those, it makes walking *impossible* unless your footgear has been
treated with the neutralizing agent. It also occurs to me that booby
traps that spray this on a soldier will make life very difficult. He
wouldn\'t be able to *hold* his weapons. Firing a frictionless rifle
would be a pain, and don\'t even *think* about grenades!

Then there\'s the anti-riot "foam". This is essentially a huge mass of
something like soapsuds. Non-toxic, non-staining, but even IR can\'t see
thru it. And it absorbs sounds. Serious disorientation results, because
visibility drops to about an *inch*. It won\'t stop projectile weapons,
but it will stop lasers and at least blunt plasma weapon bursts.

I wonder if it\'d be possible to lace the foam with some "conductive"
material. That would make it radio and radar opaque. And make it a
*major* obstacle.

It\'d be harder to lay than smoke, but a lot more persistent. And you\'d
have no idea *what* was inside. Lousy terrain, buttoned up AFVs,
companies of troops in battle dress. 

And the radar opaque type would confuse the hell out of terrain
following missiles. You\'d effectively have changed the landscape,
making self-guided cruise missiles useless.

accurately can we aim the weapons, buit can we predict where the target
will be when that packet of energy arrives.

Assuming some significant time lag, and dozens of m/sec, firing solutions
can get interesting to figure.

Required shots to assure 1 hit: (Pi * ( (Tls + Tlw) * A)^2) / Acs
assumes continuous beams.
Tls = Time Lag (one way) in seconds, of sensor system
Tlw = time lag (one way) for weapon system.
A = mps accelleration maximum
Acs = Area, cross-sectional, in square meters (How much area, in m2, the
shillouette has, or rougly 1/6 the Surface Area) [Acs also has an upper
limit of longest dimension squared...]

Basically, a target\'s potential deviation from a known vector can always be
plotted as a ball centered on the end of said vector, given a fixed unit
time-frame. Looking at a ball, you get a circle as it\'s "2d" image, and all
unguided direct fire can be handled as a matter of time-delayed 2d
accuracy, assuming no significant gavitational interactions. If you can put
one simultaneous shot per unit of shillouette area within the
target-possibiliity circle, in an even grid, you assure at least 1 of those
beams will intersect with the shillouette. Actually, for slop factor, I\'d
round up and add 10% to the theoretical formula.

with even a 1/10 LS lag, the circle for 1G (assuming the 10m/s/s Traveller
G) is  2m radius. at 6G, it\'s a 12m radius circle. Add detection, using
active, and you get a PVD (possible vector deflection) of 50% more.

Taking a 1G Type A, at .1LS, it will be within a 3mradius of the vector
postulated at time of firing, assuming no lags for firing (I\'d add 1/10
second myself), thus upping the error to a 4m radius. You can assure a hit
with a single weapon, but you will probably NOT be able to assure a hit on
a particular feature of the hull. Your circle using pi~= 3.14 is roughly
28m^2, over a rough Acs of several dozens of m^2...

Lets take the range to 1/2 LS, using passives only:
10m per G rating of radius! at this range, you\'ll have roughly 314m^2 of
Acs to cover... fighters and missiles (incoming missile Acs = 1-2 m^2,
fighters probably about 9-20).

Shooting at an incoming 15G heplar missile with an Acs of 2m^2 fired from .1LS
	shots required 	= (3.14 * (2 * .1 * 150)^2) / 2

	with a time duration of 0.2 seconds for first saturation.
you can iteratively reduce the curve for each firing cylcle.

to find chance of hitting the target one or more times (assuming 100%
accuracy of putting the shots where you  want them)

	1-(( (Sr-Wf)/ Sr)^Tf)
where
	Sr = Shots required to saturate
	Wf = weapons actually fired during a saturation.
	Tf = total fires = duration of saturation/time from fire to
		refire of weapon.
so let us assume 20 mounts firing to saturate for 5 seconds against that
missile above, and use a 1 per second firing rate.
	POH 	= 1-(((1413-20)/1413)^5)
		= 1-((1393/1413)^5)
		= 1-(0.98584571833^5)
		= 1-0.93120387146
		= .06879612854
	or roughly 6.8 percent Probability of hit... you can figure that
this will actually be a lower limt, and yes, I know that the inbound
missile actually needs an iterative process accounting for decreasing
range, but I can\'t write that kind of math in a reasonable message. Why
will it be the lower limit of  chance of hit at range?

	unless you KNOW the target MUST accellerate in a particular
direction without choice, it is POSSIBLE that the target could be anywhere
within the accelleration limit. The reality is that most of the time, a
radius of 1/3 the formulaic one above will be sufficient in any long-term
situations.

They are now, but in the LBBs TL limits computer and drive size, not jump
range. Jump range is limited by the mark of your computer and the size of
your drive compared to the size of your ship on a table (which isn\'t
precisely linear, BTW). The computer jump limit gives us the following TL
limits:

TL  Computer
5   1
6   1 bis
7   2   
8   2 bis
9   3 
10  4 
11  5 
12  6  
13  7 

The chart also tells us that Jump Drives first become avialible at TL9, and
the books also tell us that J6 is the biggest range we can have. This gives
us the following TL to Jump table:

TL  Jump
9   3
10  4

I think you\'d want to be working for someone who didn\'t into civil rights
much before you used this one. If someone with already low BP or a weak
heart got hit they could die, and not everyone in a riot is always a rioter.

They also drop missiles that hang on parachutes - if the mission commander

term "Gas-Giant Gang" as a Traveller equivalent to the "Mile-High Club."

Don\'t get me wrong folks, I love the A-10. I\'ve seen the photos and vids of
shot up A-10s, and they are definitely tough. They simply didn\'t have to
make those harrowing airfield runs that Tornado pilots got stuck with. With
a combat speed of only about 700 kph, they weren\'t suited for it. Even an
A-10 has limits -- they *can* get shot up enough to go down. Otherwise all
ground attack aircraft would be A-10s! :-)

Hmm. This brings to my mind once again the question of ground attack
aircraft in the Traveller setting (i.e., those pesky grav tanks). I am
surprised that none of the grav tanks I have ever seen depicted have pop-up
weapon systems. I would think that a logical addition to a grav tank would
be an extendable tower for sensors and/or weapons systems.

One would think also that you would make an grav attack aircraft narrow
head-on, not unlike a AH-64 Apache or AH-1 HueyCobra without the main rotor.
Wings aren\'t an issue, except as weapons pylons. You could run a main
armament down the center of the vehicle (a spinal mount, like the GAU-8 on
the Thunderbolt II).

  Which is almost exactly how the 2300 AD scenario "Lone Wolf" can play
given the various players victory conditions - it\'s from a Challenge
(around #40?) and is up on a 2300 AD site somewhere. Fantastic work.

Some of these seem extremely difficult while staying within canon. Others,
such as "crime spree" and "espionage" I would tend to lump in with mercenary
adventures. Not just trying to be contrary, I was kind of taking a broad
view of the term "mercenary". I digress though.

My earliest experiences with Traveller were the "Traveller Book" (which
included "Shadows") and "Adventure 1: The Kinunir" when I was very young. It
seemed, at that time, the entire universe was open for exploration with
Ancient (and ancient) ruins on every other planet and sweeping frontiers in
need of gruff pioneers...

Reading "The Kinunir" was my first experience with Traveller, and I haven\'t
quite gotten the same "unlimited universe" feel ever since.

I\'m not sure I made myself clear though. I don\'t have a problem with canon,
I have a problem with every single thing needing to be mapped out, explained
and codified. A well thought out universe with sector and subsector in the
Imperium detailed basically ends up with the same problem as no game
universe at all: You still have to do a good deal of work to collect things
that other people have written. A science-fiction game with outdated science
requires a good deal of work for those players and GMs who have newer sci-fi
roots.

I\'d rather see exciting adventures, even if the inclusion of a spiffy spazzo
ray seems to invalidate a paragraph in an old DGP publication that I\'ve
never seen anyway (and most of the people buying the adventure haven\'t seen
and most likely will never see).

There\'s a level of canon that works, and then there\'s a level that becomes
stifling.

I\'d love to. MTJ was the DGP magazine, correct? If so, it\'s unlikely I\'ll

This type of deal is fine. I have no problem with this form of "canon".

But where? I set up my GMing stakes in the Daibei sector, since there was
little more than some odd library entries here and there as far as I could

encroaching.

My final thought in the message is this:

Even dictionaries get updated from time to time as new concepts come into
the language. :-)

Languages change.

I\'m not arguing that canon should be destroyed utterly and entirely, I\'d
just like to see some modern revisions. Much like those arguing for strict
canon, I don\'t have tons of free time. If it\'s a choice between having to
spend long weeks trying to fit modern sci-fi concepts into Traveller, or
have my players think that Traveller is stupid because of the technology
that never crawled out of 1968... I\'ll just end up not playing.

  One idea is to have part of the first volley over - preferably into
another, already spotted target? - include a good imaging package.

  In any case one of the first things any low-TL (8-) military will do
is procure anti-artillery PD, but eliminating that capability may not
do their morale one bit of good.

  Striker had design sequences for high (D+?) tech AG drone missiles,

It occurred to me that there must be an interstellar equivalent to the
"Mile-High Club."  (I trust that the connection is clear to most posters.)
Since ships spend a week or so in jumpspace per jump, I didn\'t think that
"Jumpspace Jazzer" would be appropriate.  I then figured that your average
starship spends maybe a couple of hours per jump skimming fuel from a gas
giant, and that the view might be, shall we say, _inspirational_.  Thus, I
offer the slang term "Gas-Giant Gang" as a Traveller equivalent to the
"Mile-High Club."

I wanted to introduce myself to the list in general and perhaps ask afew
quick questions before lurking and perhaps contributing to afew threads;
hopefully ones that my quick questions will start.


	However, before the barrage of questions, abit of history.  I\'ve
been roleplaying for a rather long time, though i\'m sure they\'ll be
people who\'ve played for longer than my own eight years.  Traveller
wasn\'t my first game, I was a AD&D junkie for a good long time. 
Eventually, however, I started to buy pretty much every gaming system on
the shelves.  It was one of these \'diversions\' that caused me to find
Traveller;  in this case, Traveller: the New Era.

	The book was abit hard to read, and I never worked up the courage to
actually run the game.  I didn\'t like the rules system,
parts of the book seemed sketchy, and all in all, I just didn\'t feel
comfortable with the game.  I did love the setting though, though I
didn\'t understand even half of it.  I never played the game, and it
quickly began to gather dust, but it did remain on my mind.  That\'s
what attracted my attention to GURPS: Travellers.

	I had played GURPS for awhile, and had gained something of
a liking for the system;  though many of the players are far too
inclined to rules lawyering.  I still liked the game, and many of the
books.  Thus, upon seeing a \'Traveller\' title on the book and the
catching title I promptly bought it and read the information.

	Or most of it.  I\'m up too chapter 4, equipment, and have
skimmed through the next few chapters.  All in all, very good, and I
find that I have a much better understanding of the game than I did
after reading New Era;  as well as a profound intrest in the setting,
and in running a game there.


	Now, the questions.  Here they are, two of them.  Hopefully
you veteran Traveller folk can provide me with afew answers.

	#1:  I\'m fairly sure as to who and what the Emperor is, and I
know that the Archduke\'s rule over the domains while the dukes rule over
the sectors.  What, however, do the other titles in the Third Imperial
government do;  what are their powers and responcibilitys?

	The ranks im talking about are those under the rank of
duke:  Marquis, Count, Baron, Knight.

	#2:  In the non-alternate version of Traveller, the
AI Virus is released some 10 years from the given campaign date
in the New Era.  Is it perhaps possible that the Imperium has
access to the virus??  Or atleast some testing and research, still
with alot of work left before its ready to be implemented.

	If the \'virus\' does exist, its more likely that it will
either never be used or will not be used anytime in the near future.
Afterall, the Imperium seems responcible enough to not unleash a
weapon that they don\'t fully understand--  the scattered shards of
the Third Imperium after the Rebellion that\'s never going to happen
now we\'re desperate and irresponcible enough to do so.

	Perhaps not all that important, but it could make an intresting
adventure thread or three.  Hmmm.

I believe that \'drop tanks\' are a parallel to the W.W.II technique of
attaching extra fuel tanks to the belly of aircraft on long flights to extend
range.  When the fuel from these tanks was expended, they could be jettisoned
for reduced weight and added maneuverability.

 Would close even an Iraqi runway for less than an hour tops.  Probably
 not more than 15 minutes.  Runway cratering munitions don\'t explode
 on the ground at impact.  The best (I\'m partial to the Durandal but
 I think US/UK are using something newer then and now) hang on a 
 parachute, stabilize, then fire themselves into the runway at a
 failry high speed.  Once they\'ve penetrated below the runway
 they explode, makeing a crate /below/ the tarmac and buckling
 the runway badly.

 The reason the Tornados had to go low is these munitions require
 a lot of precision, an error by as much as 15ft could mean that
 the runway wouldn\'t be closed.  Drop them to high, and they are
 fairly easy targets for AAA.  Drop them to low, they don\'t stabilize
 and will shoot off center, most likely missing all together.

 With every yokel with an AK and way to many AAA gun batteries, this
 was not a fun job.  The Tornadoes on runway denial missions had the
 highest loss rate in the entire air campaign.  A-10\'s might have had
 a higher survival rate, but would have been exposed to fire much
 longer due to their low top end speed, so its questionable wether
 they would have had a better success rate.

I\'m not sure where that comes from, but it sounds like it would probally
be in GURPS: Vehicles.  I personally don\'t have the book, do too not
having enough money to throw it away on a non-essential supplement that
goes over how to construct everything from a 57\' Chevy to a Spanish
Galleon in scruplous detail.  If you share this thriftyness, then it
wouldn\'t be that hard to make your own drop-tank rules.

Historically, Drop Tanks are basically disposable fuel tanks that are
gotten rid of once you\'ve used the fuel within.  They would, in my
mind, be useful for temporarily boost your range (ie.  allowing you to
carry more fuel, and thus, jump more before refueling.)  I would
imagine they would cost less than a full fledged fuel-tank, but would
probally require some kinda modification to the ship so that they
could accept the \'tanks\'.  The modification would be a one-time deal,
the drop-tanks would--naturally--have to be replaced.

Small merchant traders and the Imperial Scouts are the main groups I
can envision using Drop Tanks.

Drop tanks are normally seen on the Imperial Gazelle-class Close Escort.
While attached the ship had performance characteristics of 4G acceleration and
Jump-4.  The tanks could be drained and dropped to give a single Jump-5 (due
to reduced displacement).  Until new tanks are attached the Gazelle\'s
acceleration jumps to 5G but there is only sufficient internal fuel tankage
for Jump-2.

The type R subsidized merchant can also mount a 40-ton fuel module in it\'s
cargo bay to boost it to two Jump-1\'s (as was used by the March Harrier in The
Traveller Adventure campaign).  Similar mechanics are possible on other ships.

Actually, the formula is 
(Pi*(0.5 * (Tls+Tlw)^2)*A^2) / Acs
since distance travelled away from predicted positionis 
0.5 * A * T^2.

This reduces hit probabilities at long ranges but increases them at short

A discussion on the structure of the Imperial government and the duties and
obligations of the nobility can by found in Behind The Claw, the second GURPS:
Traveller book which covers the Spinward Marches.  In a nutshell, the Imperium
controls affairs "between the stars" and anything that "threatens teh security
of the Imperium" which is intentionally open to loose interpretation.  

As far as the nobility, some nobles serve as liaisons for the member worlds in
the Imperial Court.  Others are charged with various "fact-finding" missions
for the Emperor and to represent the Imperium abroad.  Others are sent to act
as "troubleshooters" and serve as the Imperium\'s eyes and hands on member
worlds that have suffered major setbacks/disasters.  While it is quite
possible for nobles to serve as no more then diletantes (and there are those),
others see it as obligation of their position to serve the citizens of the
Imperium however they can or are charged.

I imagine some Imperial Research Station is working on AI\'s.  That\'s really up
to you to decide for your campaign.  The main GURPS: Traveller book discusses
AI\'s in the sidebar on pg. 18.

Then again, the Virus was released by the "legitamate" Imperial government in
the Rebellion setting.  But it went further then they had intended it to.  And
nothing to say one of the many megacorps isn\'t dabbling with AI tech and it
gets out of hand. Plenty to inhabited worlds outside the Imperial sphere they
can do their research on.

Hi, I\'m Chris Seamans (semo@pil.net). I\'m a part time poster to the list,

Something of a veteran here...  Not a newbie at any rate :-)

Let\'s see if I can help you out. I think I might be able to. The following
information is paraphrased from "Classic" Traveller "Supplement 11: Library
Data (N-Z)". The same information is also located in the MegaTraveller
"Imperial Encyclopedia".

***Knight: Lowest of the noble ranks, awarded as an honorific rank in
recognition for achievement or service. There are many different orders of
knighthood, depending on the achievement or service attained or performed.
I\'m going to list a couple, but there are many more:

Order of the Emperor\'s Guard - General and common
Order of Starship and Crown - General and common
Order of Hlyuea - Aslan citizens
Order of Gvadakoung - Vargr citizens
Order of the Arrow - Interstellar explorers

Furthermore, each domain also has an order named after it (Order of Vland,
Order of Sol, Order of Antares, etc.). Titles are given out for these by the
Archduke of the domain. The Order of Sylea is administered by the Emperor
himself, the defacto Archduke of Sylea.

***Baronet: Intermediate between first and second levels of noble rank.
Created usually by archdukes, although the Emperor can create them if he so
desires.

***Baron: Lowest level of nobility accorded membership in the peerage. In
layman\'s terms, the lowest rank a noble can attain and be viewed as a noble
by other nobles. A person awarded the rank of baron usually gets a small
fief of land, not often greater than 100 square kilometers.

***Marquis: A marquis is associated with a single world (generally a large
or important one with a Class A or B Starport).

***Count: Associated with two or three worlds in a subsector.

***Duke: Normally associated with a subsector, although a duke may
eventually come to lead an entire sector. No special title is given to a
sector duke.

That should pretty much cover most of the bases, I think. Hope that helps.

If you want to believe it\'s so, it\'s so. I\'m not sure if GURPS: Traveller is
going to acknowledge any part of the TNE timeline. It\'s doubtful that Loren
& Co. will though. Don\'t quote me on that though :-)

Well, there isnt a single answer that applies everywhere and through the
whole history of the Imperium.

There are basically two themes - either that people are noble because they
are important, or people are important because they are noble.

Things get sticky becuase the Imperium claims to rule not worlds, but the
space between the worlds. Giving Imperial nobles land grants on member
worlds, or taxation rights on the same, intrudes on this IMO.

One compromise is that Imperial fiefs are on Imperial territory, like
starports (Marquis get A ports, Counts B ports, Barons C ports, and Knights
get a hundred pounds of TDX explosives, a navigation beam and, if they are
well-connected, someone to set the explosives to clear a space for a Class
E starport), or that Nobles are granted uninhabited territory to settle
(\'By my rights as Emperor, I Strephon grant you, Sir X of Y, and your heirs
of the body, a fief inalienable, being the third body orbiting the star
875-127 in District 268 of the Spinward Marches\').

The other option is nobility carries no power in and of itself - the fact
that Admiral Santanocheev is also a Marquis is less important than his job
as Fleet Grand Admiral. Of course, being related to the right people,
having gone to the right schools etc is a major career advantage in
Imperial Service.

Promoting your relatives is also a tradition for most noble families in
Civil Service.

As far as I remember, Mustard Gas was invented by Sir Humphrey Davey, and
was filed in the British Army\'s \'Too Horrible to Use\' files for 100 years
or so, so I find it quite credible that the military potential of Virus
would be filed under \'Probably wont work, and if it does, it is too
dangerous to use\'.

  Given TL 9+, remote sensors may just be an issue of getting handed off
info from other platforms - perhaps small, lightly armoured air-rafts
fitted out as RPV\'s? At TL 12 you can go the Zho-bot route.

I don\'t think so...

But every Sector would have one.  And, very likely, every Subsector would 
have one - so this office is duplicated to the SubSector Level.

According to G. Harry Stine\'s "Halfway to Anywhere", the club is called The
Three Dolphin Club ( a reference to the fact that dolphins always mate in
threes, one male, one female, one assisstant), and already has at least ten

Subject: GT: Seeking thoughts on skills...
Hi fellas -
I\'m toying with GT and there seem to be some
inconsistencies with the skills, especially around
Mechanic/Engineering/Elec Ops.
I am not a heavy GURPS user (at least not yet,
although the GT line may tip me over the edge)
so I was wondering if anyone can tell me...
1. What specialisations are there for these skills?
   There seems to be a different set every place I
   look, maybe that\'s me not understanding how it
   hangs together.
************
there is a list in Basic, from memory:
Sensors
Commo
Medical
and 3 or 4 others....
GT adds one: Force Shields (For Meson Screens)

2. What\'s the difference between Engineer (J-Drive)
   and Mechanic (J-Drive), apart from one has a
   default and the other doesn\'t?
   (The scoutship writeup has the crew needing both
   but the Scout template only gives you mechanic,
   I\'m assuming this is because they were written
   by different people?)
******************
The engineer can design the drives as well.

3. Why do you need Tactics to fly a Free Trader?
****************
Incase you want to turn Pirate?

seriously, a tactics in addition to being useful in combat can also help
you spot an ambush, as in:

it looks like that Fast Trader is setting us up for a fireing pass.

initial post in the Classic Traveller Resurgence

With it I\'m trying to explain why I hate and love
canon.  I\'ve used the milieu as a crutch, esp. for
running campaigns with one player, and I\'ve used it
to drive players beyond the boarders of known space.
It\'s long, so grab a cup of coffee.
===============================


When I first began playing the game in 1978, the 
GDW adventures and even JTAS were not yet 
published. The standards and assumptions of 
those books did not begin to become available to players until late in
that year. We had to invent
our own milieu, our own Traveller 
Universe. The young man who refereed my first 
games had one little subsector with twenty 
worlds only a few of which were fleshed out. 
Only one, Gateway, had it\'s own destinctive
"look and feel". Everything beyond that star 
system was a mystery to me.

Much of what we encountered was invented the
night before by our referee. Some times it 
didn\'t work, but most times it was a challenging
new world or adventure that we stepped out into.

So, as I bought my own little black box of little
black books (plus Book 4 and Supplement 1) a
short time later, I too created my own universe. 
I invested hundreds of hours into charting and 
NPC generation and storylines, creating an entire 
milieu from scratch over that next year. I honed 
and perfected after every gaming session to make 
it better for the next group to play.

During that year, 1979, Marc Miller began to
reveal his own carefully crafted milieu. At 
first it was just something to hang a scenario 
on, an optional background, in case the reader 
was so unimaginative as to have no universe of 
their own. I ignored it when it appeared in the 
JTAS. I skipped over that paragraph or two in 
The Kinunir. It began to build and become more 
integral to the materials, so I shunned it, 
banned it and scoffed at it.

But it was overpowering. It was too well laid
out. It swept over everything, like a well- 
planned mutiny. I struggled to make my universe 
compatible. I placed my worlds into a sector 
near the Spinward Marches. But there was no 
holding the milieu back. A dozen other 
publishers cranked out adventures and 
supplements. It snowballed larger and larger. 
My universe, one hundred worlds, was pushed 
aside. The last time I ran an adventure there 
was September of 1984. Only a handful of worlds 
exist today. Integrated with the Sword Worlds, 
several of them fell to the Imperium during the 
Fifth Frontier War.

That is why Milieu-1105 must not be abandonned!
It is the milieu that is so big, so well fleshed 
out, that nothing can stand up to it. Not the 
Rebelion, not the Virus, not even Grandfather! 
(sorry, Ravat). T4 draws it in, but doesn\'t 
build it up (though I believe IG and MM intended 
to.) T5 will probably ignore it. But it cannot 
be put down, it cannot be ignored, because the 
future of the games depends upon it. You see, 
there is going to be a RESURGENCE!, a return of 
the original players, coming back to the game. 
Call it nostalgia, call it recapturing your 
youth. Whatever the psycology behind it, the 
wave is coming. That wave might be able to carry 
the game to new heights, but only if the return- 
ing masses are comfortable with and can recognize 
the game that they once knew and loved.

I vote for republication of the old materials, 
and I loudly declare that new adventures must be 
published for the original milieu. I desire to 
be at the crest of the next wave, to ride high 
once again on the only RPG that has held onto me 
for more than a short season. There is quality 
and an ideal here that will carry Traveller to 
the top one more time. I can see it, I can feel 
it, can any of you?

===========================

One final thought: you need to build something up
so that it is real enough that, when it falls, it
will cause a real sense of loss.  I was excited and
renewed by the "assassination" plot, so much so that
I got back into playing at a time when I was 
drifting away.  I\'m still so peaved about the virus
idea that I can now understand why book burning has
been a recurring theme in our history!  I say that
it is the canon, or common history, that gives us
a common topic to talk about.  Love it or hate it,
it\'s 99% of our common Traveller knowledge.

No more than we have a "cruise ship club" or "hotel room club".

Star travellers in Traveller have their own cabins, live on the ship
for appreciable periods of time and have a modicum of privacy.
Very different from the titillating aspects of joining the "Mile High
Club".

Unless some people have a sensual reaction to the psychological
stress of being in jump space - some people have such a reaction
to dangerous situations.

Like the sensor "dome" on the AH64D Attack Helo or the newest Kiowa scout
Helo?  It doesn\'t have to be very big.  Maybe just an emitter/receiver on a
mast.

The thing is, in the Traveller style TL10+ battlefield, *any* emissions and
*any* radar target is vulnerable to attack.  It\'s almost more logical for
the atttack craft to have *no* active sensors and just act as a weapons
platform for "scouts" with the sensors that are out of reach (orbital),
undetectable, or expendable.

The narrow profile would be logical if it weren\'t for the massive armor
requirements implied in Traveller style military ground combat.  A vehicle
needs to be able to take a few hits before going down in order to be
effective.  This requires several centimeters of superdense.  The tank-like
shape is a more efficient shape for this, although some of the fanciful
designs in, for example, 101 Vehicles are not really that great (Some of
the tanks have serious "shell traps" between hull and turret fronts).  A
fixed main armament means you need to be travelling directly at the target
to fire on it.  That can be a disadvantage.

I think Rob Prior had my favorite grav tank configuration in a few of his
designs; one turret ventral and one dorsal, offset from one another, both
of equal size for a main battery, then two small (remote) turrets on port
and starboard with lighter point defense/multipurpose weapons.  The main
hull was an elongated egg shape I think.  It seemed immensely logical to me
since there is full 360 x 360 main & secondary armament coverage with this
configuration without reorienting the hull or changing direction of travel.
Note that the option exists to keep power plant size down by allowing only
one main weapon at a time to fire.

On the other hand, I once designed a light attack grav sled in precisely
the form you suggest (like an attack helo without the rotor, sans spinal
mount) complete with stubby winglike weapons pylons for carrying guided
missiles.  It worked well in a low-threat environment.

Note that Striker\'s main form of attack for grav vehicles was the "popup"
attack, quite similar to the way an attack helo works; a tank would pop up
suddenly and fire at its target, returning to NOE altitude quickly to avoid
counterfire.

While altering the established background makes work for the players who
have kept the game alive. A paradox?

Possibly we need a new universe. We have the Classic universe, with the
classic assumptions and SF feel. We then create a new, revised universe
that updated the SF while staying as close as possible to the older
universe. People with established campaigns could either stay in the old
universe or move to the new one, as the chose. Both would be "official",
and everyone would be happy. Careful writers would include conversion info
so that referees could run their adventures in either universe.

Judgement call here. Just because someone declares "spoz" the "worst drug
menace facing Imperial society" doesn\'t mean that all drug smuggling
adventures have to deal in spoz. After all, a lot that\'s written as "fact"
is more properly called "convention" or "opinion".

I\'ve got it, and DGP gave me permission to copy at no profit. Roger has
never actually revoked that permission, so as far as I know it still
stands. (And seeing as Roger ceased communicating with me as soon as I
inquired about the money DGP owes me, it\'s unlikely he\'ll revoke it.)

they didn\'t, I would figure that they own the copyright to their articles
(morally if not legally). I\'ll try to post an authors list this weekend so
you can contact them and get permission.

Bridge anyone?

Different campaign, different rulesset, I was actually a *player* for once,
our crew took up bridge (the card game) for the weeks-long transits between
planets.  Eventually we did the obvious; developed a short-hand code system
using bidding conventions as our code words.

"4 Clubs" = Prepare to get low to the ground.
"6 No Trump" = We hold all the cards/assets.
"1 Club" = I got something going on, combatwise.
  -Response of "1 No Trump" = I have nothing to help you with.

It was fun.

True. Also of note:

Under the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1906, axphyxiating gas was
specifically forbidden. The British discounted the warnings of chlorine
gas at Ypres because they believed that Germany wouldn\'t break the
convention.

If you could find out about it by asking for feedback on the TML but didn\'t,

You don\'t need that unless you have ambitions about adding to the OTU. If
you have, then, yes, I do think you ought to get yourself a "Doctorate in
Travellerology". Though a good editor with one may make that unneccesary.

I think you are mistaken. I believe that GURPS:Lensman was a huge succes, and
that universe assumed that the chip was never invented.

Actually, Virus got out accidentally, when Dulinor\'s forces raided the
research station where it was being worked on. Virus was clearly an
unfinished weapon. Working with it under cotrolled conditions surely
showed its flaws as a weapon. (All it was supposed to do was take over
ships, shut them down and wait for the Imperial forces to arrive. It was
intended to disable ships without destroying them, letting the other
side recover them and use them against the enemy.)

Since Virus is derived from the Cymbeline chip lifeforms, it _is_ canon
to GT as that was set, IIRC, much earlier, some years after the Solomani
Rim War, in fact.

What you do with _that_ however, is up to you. From later references, it
is very clear that the Imperium clamped down hard on knowledge of the
Cymbelne chips, but that some knowledge was out there, including one
starship, if the scenario is played out as in Adv.13. The PC\'s have a
ship with an AI computer after that.

Just to make it explicitly clear; The tanks are drained and dropped
*before* the ship enters jump.  The tanks can then be reclaimed at the
origin system if desired/planned for.

>The type R subsidized merchant can also mount a 40-ton fuel module in it\'s

Or, if designed as such, could have a jump-2 drive installed and use the
added internal tankage to jump-2.

This brings up a questions which was nibbled around the edges in last
night\'s session.

Assumptions; A Cargo Bay can be used as a bunkroom, with a few easily
stored accoutrements.  Crew and passenger staterooms can be tripled or even
quadrupled for short periods of time, say the amount of time to transit to
jump point (20-40 hours usually).  A collapsable tank fills a cargo bay
until that tank is empty, at which point it can be stored in roughly 1% of
the previously occupied space.

So I can bring quite a few steerage passengers or troops by converting my
cargo bay cum fuel bladders into a bunkroom just after entering jump.  This
capacity is limited only by how many people I can "cram" into the existing
passenger/crew spaces for the period leading up to jump, say about 4 times
the usual capacity (thats about 1 person per ton), and if I have other
\'auxiliary\' spaces (gymnasium, dinig salon) I can cram 1 more per ton into
those spaces for short periods.

Ok, could someone please poke holes in this logic?  I don\'t really think
players should be doing this.

Hmm ... maybe. Today they have hand-off systems (I\'m thinking of the AH-64
here), but there is still some utility to being able to see the target
yourself without making yourself vulnerable. I believe this is why the
AH-64 Longbow variant has its radar array on top of its main rotor, so that
it can paint a target with radar from behind a hill without exposing the
main body of the vehicle to fire.

IIRC, the American hovertank from 2300AD solved this problem with a
tethered sensor drone. I would imagine grav versions would be even more
versitile. A 1 kl sensor package with it\'s own propulsion unit, to look
over hills and find targets for smart missiles. You shoot the missile up,
and once its in the clear it aquires a target and heads on its way.

Of course, if even smart, small, and fast missiles can be shot down
routinely (with point defense laser systems), then I suppose high energy
weapons (HEWs) would come to dominate the battlefield. At this point, the
attack vehicle would have to expose itself to fire, since HEWs are big,
direct-fire weapons.

Nope. There was a rotary-wing gunship, but a conspicuous lack of grav
vehicles in COACC. To me, it was the biggest disappointment in what was
otherwise my favorite MT supplement. There were few examples of
stellar-tech COACC vehicles. I guess this was due to the assumption that
Trepidas and their ilk would take on the role of attack aircraft by this
time and strike aircraft would be replaced by smart missiles. However,
while floating tanks have a high kewlness factor, but I somewhat doubt they
would be the best configuration for a combat aircraft. The attack speeders
in DGP\'s 101 Vehicles would be closer to the mark IMO, although I would
have configured and loaded them out differently.

This brings up an interesting question.  If the Gazelle is basicly a 300
ton ship with 100 ton droptanks, then why does it have 4 hardpoints?
Following the logic, I could _design_ a ship to use droptanks for the extra
displacement, and thus, extra hardpoints.  Then, to keep the performance
where I want it, never use the tanks and benefit from the extra hardpoints.

One fringe benefit of the original CT (pre-HG) ship construction
rules was that, at least some of the time, larger ships would be
slower. Fewer G\'s, lower jump capability. You could make a
6G Jump-6 ship at 1000 or 2000 tons, but could only pull
4G/J4 at 4000tns, 2G/J2 at 5000tns (IIRC, my book is at home).

Therefore, in a universe where 5ktns was as big as jump-capable
ships got, you wouldn\'t see the biggest ships being as nimble as
the smallest fighters. You\'d see smaller cruisers and destroyers
jumping twice as far as the lumbering battleships - the line of
battle would take longer to move, both tactically and strategically,
than the screening elements and recon forces.

There\'s a feel there that I find appealing, and I\'ve seriously considered
a hybrid CT/HG ship construction system - I\'ve even got some handwave
ideas to explain it.

Hmm. What\'s the range on a densitometer? I wonder if these could be used to
provide targetting data. This would be a double-edged sword for pop-up
attackers, I suppose ...

Your right. Assuming orbital spotting were out (due to lack of superiority,
atmospheric obstruction, or whatever) expendable scouts would be the way to
go -- remote sensor drones and the like.

I do not understand why a tank-like shape is more efficient for putting on
several centimeters of superdense than a narrow-profile shape. I can see it
adding several centimeters to either side, but that\'s about it (unless you
were to angle the armor -- but then that would be a questionable idea on an
airborne vehicle.

Do you have some time to explain this to me?

Well, facing the target, anyway. I understand your point though. Assuming
pop-up attacks, this is not a big deal, but if it were an fast attack run
it could make a difference. However, I wonder how controllable a turreted
vehicle with a Big Honkin\' Barrel (tm) would be at speed in atmosphere if
it were pointed anywhere but in an aerodynamically efficient direction. The
Trepida\'s turret pointed to either side of the axis of travel would cause
an awful lot of drag.

Of course, Traveller being a game and all, it\'s probably goofy to worry
about this. The Trepida *looks* kewl. :-)

I had figured that (I hope to get a hold of a copy of Striker soon). What,
in your opinion, would be the point of a ventral main-armament (such as
that on Rob\'s design) in such a pop-up attack? You probably wouldn\'t use it
at all, unless you wanted to expose yourself fully to counterfire. I\'d
rather just pop up enough to fire over the obstruction with the turret. I
am assuming grav-tech NOE avionics would be capable of this type of
manuevering quite easily, of course.

Actually, in thinking about it, I wonder how useful a ventral main turret
would be overall. Assuming it\'s not a ball turret, you would have a limited
firing arc below you, and since you are sticking close to the ground anyway
you could probably just go low to hit such low-lying targets with your
dorsal main gun. Maybe you\'d have to tilt the vehicle a bit. I am also
thinking that you might be able to roll a grav vehicle quite easily (thus
making the dorsal turret a ventral turret). I\'d probably save the expense
(and mass/volume). I am interested in why you think a ventral turret would
be worth the trouble.

Actually, it\'s more on the lines of (Pi) * ((Tls+Tlw) * (Tvc) * (.5 A))^2 /
Acs, where terms are mostly as above, and Tvc is the length of time between
changes in vector of acceleration, assuming a random-walk evasion pattern, and
to be useful should probably not exceed Tls+Tlw/2 (if it exceeds Tls+Tlw
evasion is ineffective).
Thus, for a KKM with 20G (200 m/s) evasion (not really that difficult, I
managed to design a 50G HePLAR missile earlier for about $60k, though there\'s
large quantities of horribly vague and poorly edited rules in FF&S2 so I\'m not
sure how legal it is) and a cross-section of about 0.2 meters, assuming .1 ls
range, Tls=Tlw=Tvc=0.1, we get an area of 12.5 square meters and about 60 shots
required for a hit, though a hit is probable on a lesser number of shots. 
Unfortunately, once you actually get within the same hex as your target evasion
ceases to be relevant fairly quickly; at that point it\'s necessary to be able
to survive point defense fire for whatever length of time is required to cross
that distance.

I recently had my players do something creative. The ship was grounded on
a primitive planet, and for various reasons they couldn\'t take off right
then, but they wanted to get the tanks refuelled asap. So the engineer
takes his densitometer and starts checking for groundwater, rolls a
spectacular success, and along with the group archaeologist\'s knowledge of
geology, managed to find the water table. He then rigs up a drill and
proceeds to sink a well and pump assembly to fill the tanks without moving
the ship.

He joked that he had just upgraded the planet\'s starport from X to D
(unrefined fuel available)!

Well, no. A fuel bladder requires no special fittings, save for a hookup to
either the fuel tanks or the drives.

IMTU, cargo holds are routinely depressurized during jump, to cut costs. A
depressurized cargo hold requires no fresh air vents, no pest control, and no
sterilization procedures. In combat, the contents are not subject to explosive
decompression if the hold is hit.

In order to put live (i.e. non-low-berth) passengers in there, you need to
retrofit plumbing fixtures, air circulation, and other life support essentials.
This means that there are extra costs involved.

If my players wanted to do that, I\'d charge them based on the cost of a standard
stateroom. For example, if they wanted to put four middle passengers in the
hold, they\'d pay whatever two staterooms cost.

If they didn\'t pay that, and crammed people into hallways, I\'d start rolling for
life support failure.

I love assumptions.  I agree with the collapsable tank.  However, I think
that a High Passenger might be more than a tad put out that he/she is
sharing their quarters - for however short a period - with the riff-raff.
Additionally, who is building the quarters in the cargo bay?  Are you
carrying that many supercargo personnel or do you expect the steerage
passengers to do it?  Remember, even tho\' there are no duties specified
during jump, the engineering staff (usually the people with the mechanical
skill that would be required) should be quite busy during the first hours
after you enter Jump.

Do you really want people who are so desparate as to travel in this manner
to be left in your *cargo* bay for a week?  Don\'t you think the people who
are paying for the cargo to arrive *intact* may have something to say about
this?  How about the custom\'s inspectors when they start checking the cargo
seals?

IMTU a stateroom must be able to maintain pressure, separate from the rest
of the ship, for a period sufficient for a sophont to have a reasonable
chance at donning a pressure suit, should the ship\'s hull integrity be
breached.

IMTU, a merchant carrying passengers must be able to supply a method of
emergency egress (vacc suit, seat on a shuttle, life ball) for each sophont
carried as a passenger.

IMTU cargo bays may be supplied with such basics as power, light, heat and
pressure - but there are only limited points where water is available (for
cargo bay washdowns) and drainage (into the bilge) or normal air circulation
(live cargo is carried in cargo pods with life support modules).  By the
very size of the cargo bay, I would prefer to keep it evacuated in transit -
the ship\'s emergency air reserves (enough pressure to air the ship 1.5
times) does not include the cargo bay.  (hmmm...the pressure to fill the
cargo bay so that work can be preformed during jump *is* the emergency air
reserve??)

IMTU the only use of the cargo bay for sophont travel is by the use of
specially designed low berths - these are basically low berths built into a
cargo pod, require a power hookup but have a battery backup for transit
between storage points and the cargo bays, and allow for *long* trips to be
made.  If you crammed a load of passengers into your cargo bay, under any
conditions save emergencies, and were boarded for a INS \'health and welfare\'
inspection - you could expect to finish your cruise in the brig of a INS
destroyer!

poke, poke   :)


Having said all that, put your cargo bay into 0-G, rig a series of nets,
strap the steerage scum to the nets and pump \'em full of fast drug.

It was also a well established universe through novels, cartoons, and
indirectly through comic books based on it (Green Lantern and the Green
Lantern Corps). Here you\'ve got something that has an established fanbase
already that some people are already familiar with.

Basically, you\'re not going to have that same luxury with Traveller.

Two words: Life Support.

Life support for ships is based on a normal passenger complement, if you
seriously raise that number, you\'re gonna start running into serious
problems...what do you do when your air runs out ...and you\'re still in
Jump space...

Just to make it explicitly clear; The tanks are drained and dropped
*before* the ship enters jump.  The tanks can then be reclaimed at the
origin system if desired/planned for.
**************
AFAIK this was delebetatly left out of GT, as the Fuel needs to be used
during jump.  allowing the drop tanks to be used as presented on the
Gazelle opens up a whole bag of worms.

Also IIRC the Gazelle di\\esign itself is broken, it has 4 turrets and is
only 300 Dtons.

This brings up a questions which was nibbled around the edges in last
night\'s session.
Assumptions; A Cargo Bay can be used as a bunkroom,

So I can bring quite a few steerage passengers or troops by converting my
cargo bay cum fuel bladders into a bunkroom just after entering jump.  This
capacity is limited only by how many people I can "cram" into the existing
passenger/crew spaces for the period leading up to jump, say about 4 times
the usual capacity (thats about 1 person per ton), and if I have other
\'auxiliary\' spaces (gymnasium, dinig salon) I can cram 1 more per ton into
those spaces for short periods.
************
well if you are playing GT, there is only life support for two per
stateroom....sure you can fit them all aboard, but how long before they
kill each other for the last breath of oxy?

ISTR that the RAF used the Gulf to test out a parachute/loitering ARM? I
think it was parachute based, but it\'s a while since I read about it.

I believe that was the evolution planned for the JP233 - basically putting

piloted missile.

while over the next week. This is mainly an issue if you want access to Rob

Whilst my site is out of commission you may be able to get Rob\'s software
through http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/RPS.html directly as I will try and
leave this page up throughout.

Additionally, there may be some problems accessing BITS website which IIRC

Strictly GM\'s option, as is any TNE material when using GT , but FYI:
Survival Margin (PP. 69-70) mentions the SDG-313F pseudo-AI ship IFF 
system, based on the same Cymbeline silicon entities as the later virus.
The research for this system was completed in 1086imp., and became
mandatory equipment on all starships operating within the Imperial
boundaries, after the passage of the 12th Standard Data Systems Law in
1088imp.
 Since the these events happened well before the GT timeline starts
diverging from the older products, introducing the SDG-313F system should
be basically quite easy. What potential effect they would have on the
development of the imperium in long term is anybody\'s guess.
 Another thought in the same vein; What other uses, besides doomsday
weapons, might a peaceful society find for the Cymbeline entities?
Mega-scale AI research, anyone?

	I dont think that Virus would work very well as a weapon,
though.  It\'s not just a tool, a thing to be used.  It\'s a lifeform;
it\'s just as unpredictable as any other enslaved lifeform.

	I\'m running a game, here at home, on Terra, post Rim-war.  :)  A
political/espionage type game.  So I was thinking that I just might
plug it in around here, as some kind of adventure.  No way I\'d let it

adventure atleast.  ;)

It may be that for "off the shelf" drives and computers (at least within
the Imperium) Tech Level didn\'t matter as much. It takes a year or
three to build a starship, maybe during that time they can ship
in a standard Jump-X core from the next subsector over, even if the
local class-A Starport is only TL10.

_Kinunir_ (Adventure 1) had General Shipyards at Regina building
TL15 Battlecruisers (IIRC), Regina is only TL12 - so there may be
some canon support for this.

If you\'re an independent world, or working custom stuff, this probably
wouldn\'t apply.

As a matter of fact, Densiometers have a rating in penetration, not range.
Effectiveness in space combat is reduced by -1 for each 25,000km square, so
range, in terms of planetary scale combat, is not limited.

At TL15 a 1km Hipen densimeter takes up 7kl and costs 1.5Mcr (power and
weight are not excessive).  Not "expendable" in terms of cost, but
certainly very capable from far away (orbit) and it can be mounted in a
relatively small vehicle.  Also, it can \'see\' through up to 1km (less a
bit) of intervening matter I would suppose.

Ok, this is my opinion and you are, of course, welcome to disagree.  I am
no expert, just a self-educated interested amateur, but here goes;

Armor is more than a layer of material.  Armor is reflected in the entire
shape, size, and structural integrity of the vessel or vehicle and the
whole shape must be considered when designing armor.

A vehicle is designed to be attacked from a particular direction.
Inevitably, someone develops a way to attack vehicles from the most
vulnerable direction (top-down attack missiles like the Milan are prime
examples).  A vehicle is also designed to be most effective against the
most dangerous and likely form of attack.

Aircraft are not usually armored.  They are designed with redundant systems
for survivability, but armor is generally only around the pilot, engines,
etc.  Most aircraft components (wings, tail) need to be thinly covered or
uncovered to be effective.  Form is a matter of aerodynamic function, not
protection, although some compromises (esp. the AH-1\'s thin shape) are made.

Tanks are designed for protection first and foremost.  The angled hull
armor is effective not only for its thickness, but the ability to deflect
sabot rounds and place a greater profile of armor in its path.  Tanks today
are deigned to present one face to the most likely threat direction, but
with good protection elsewhere.

So, Next assumptions;

1. Energy weapons are reduced in effectiveness when hitting angled armor
plate - the energy is distributed over more square centimeters of armored
surface.

2. Grav Tanks and their kin travel at Nape-of-Earth, and attack from
distances greater than 5km.  So the majority of direct fire attacks will
impact the sides, front and rear of the vehicle, not the top or the bottom.

3. Point Defense weapons render most, but not all, missiles and chemically
propelled rounds ineffective.  Therefore the primary perceived threat to a
grav tank is a laser, plasma or fusion weapon.

4. The best defense against fusion weapons, aside from not being shot by
them, is armor, and lots of it.

Those are my principles.  Now for the theory.

The Helo shape you are talking about is basically a cigar shape with tall
\'sides\'.   Profile is very small from directly in front and in back, and
long and narrow from above and below.  From the sides, however, this shape
is most vulnerable.  For a fast-mover vs. slow movers this is perfect,
since you expect to be in and out quickly and the side-on shot will have to
be quick and have lots of \'lead\', while a head-on or tail-on shot needs to
be very precise.

For a vehicle that moves more slowly (NOE speed at TL15 is only 190kph)
there needs to be more side protection, and less top and bottom protection.
This craft is not making passing attacks (although it can), its going up
against other grav tanks in a game of hide-manuver-popup&shoot-hide again.
it is difficult to predict which face will take the hit - except that it is
unlikely to be attacked from above or below.  Since everyone will be
hugging the terrain it is pretty much a 2D battlespace.

So my preferred shape is a saucer shape.  Compromising to the need for
speed, it is a shape longer than it is wide.  The hull tapers to relatively
sharp angles where the top deck meets the bottom deck such that a side-on
hit will spread itself across many square centimeters of hull.  The turret
fairs into the deck closely for the same reason.  The profile is quite
short, but wide, from every cardinal direction, but from above and below it
is a big target.

It\'s not a fast attack craft.  Its a take your shot and give one back craft.

If the Trepida were in battle, according to my vision, it would not be
travelling at its Mach 7+ top speed.  It would be creeping along at its
190kph NOE speed.  The high speed is for transit to and from the
battlefield and/or orbit.

A trainable main gun means you can be accellerating towards cover while
firing.  In a battle of manuver, it provides more options.

Of course, that\'s the main reason.  It\'s nice to have a good argument to
back it up though.

I\'m not sure what I was thinking at the time other than it would look cool.
If you did have a second main weapon you could (if you had a full power
plant) engage multiple targets.  As you point out, though, you would be
fully exposed to counterfire.  Another advantege is that if one turret were
damaged you would not be out of the battle.  The obvious ability to attack
ground targets without "tilting" is not terribly significant.

I also couldn\'t find the vehicle just now when I went looking.  considering
how many vehicle designs have been made available on the web, in TMl posts,
and in other forms, I\'m not suprised, and it may not have been one of Rob\'s
at all.

I have always assumed that the turrets on Grav Vehicles can elevate and
depress fairly far; perhaps +45 to -5 - despite their appearance.

Dorsal and ventral turrets would allow you to engage targets which would
"outflank" a single turret craft when it is committed to a manuver.  If I
can tempt your vehicle into facing and tilting toward one direction, a
second vehicle of mine could get in an unreturned shot - perhaps even on
deck or belly armor.  A second weapon would discourage such a manuver,
although at the cost of weapon strength.

Point defense weapons need 360 x 360 coverage.  You never know where a
missile might pop up from, and you don;\'t always have the luxury of
"rolling" to bring your PD weapons to bear.

Infantry against tanks?  sure, all you need to do is be in the right place
- - directly below the grav tank, where the armor is thinnest and the angle
for your penetrator the best.  Oh, and its best to be within 50 meters so
the point defense doesnt have time to slew around and blow your anti-tank
missile up.  In other words, you need to shoot it down right on top of your
own position.  Preferably when you\'re not there.

Intresting.  I imagine there\'s alot more information in those book
than is located in the 62 pages of Library Data in Chapter 2 of GURPS:
Traveller.  Shame I can\'t get ahold of them;  they\'d no doubt be a
very intresting read and probally useful too.  No local book stores that

stuff thats not in print.

Thank you.  That\'s about what I was imaging.  They don\'t actually
govern land, its basically like the real knighthoods.  They\'ll get
abit more respect from the common folk, and abit more powers that
they\'re allowed to use for the Imperium.  In exchange, they\'re now
the vassals of their lord, and have the normal feudal responcibilitys
that they have to own up too..

Intresting fact about the Emperor being the defacto Archduke of Sylea.
Makes alot of sense too.  The Orders of the Domains are a nice touch
too, definatly going to have to remember that.

	So they are something of the between level.  Higher in terms

higher levels of authority.  Something like a \'Senior Knight\'.  I\'d
probally include them in the orders too;  they\'d just be the high-up
men in the various knightly orders.

	Would would that fief be, and where?  As I understood it,

only areas of intrest to the Imperium would have a baron.  Starports,
naval bases, depots, science research stations, and other small

certain limits??  I imagine, from the opinions of others on the list,

Perhaps I am unclear.  "Assembling Quarters" in this case means throwing
down a few rugs, putting some "Bunks, Metal, Standard Size" together,
moving the chemical toilet and portable washing sink into the corner
withsome breakdown partitions here and there fore privacy.

The cargo bay in question would be otherwise empty.  It just had a fuel

These aren\'t passengers, they are employees, and what keeps them from

This is not relevant.  One only needs a single source of water, the basics
can be rigged from standard field equipment.  IMTU you pay for life support
based on the whole volume of the vessel, therefore the whole volume is
supplied.

> By the

IMTU you pay for life support based on the whole volume of the vessel,
therefore the whole volume is supplied.  A "recharge" fee based on the
number of people onboard for that period is assessed to charge up the
system and provide replacement filters, etc, and this fee would apply.

Always an attractive option for the players, but how are they going to take

I believe what it comes down to is that AI isn\'t a tool.  It is, for
all purposes, an entirely diffrent and unique lifeform.  Remember,
like someone else said, Virus wasn\'t supposed to be a doomsday weapon-
it was supposed to be the ultimate bloodless weapon.  Disable someones
equipment, then move in and take over.

However, it didn\'t turn out like that.  AI is dangerous because it,
quite literally, has a mind of its own.

\'Twas exactly my point the last time we have a Virus flamewa^H^H^H^H
discussion around here a few months ago...that the biggest
misunderstanding that the imperials made regarding it was that it _was_
alive.

OTOH, we truly _don\'t_ know what they did and did not know about Virus.
There is one oblique entry in SM about a scientist escaping from
RSOmega, and getting killed before he could spread his warning. Some
sort of post mortem memory recovery (courtesy PlotHandwave Inc. ;-) got
some vague impression of a deadly virus; thus it was thought that what
they were working on was some super-bioweapon. There are other oblique
references to \'Lucan\'s mad superweapons\' in SM. The actuak release
occured after al the scientist at RSOmega were killed in the defense of
the station. A hasty examination of the data in situ did not indicate
the problem, and Virus was beamed to Dulinor\'s entire fleet for later
examination at leisure.

	I\'d imagine it was a mixture of the two.  People who are
important are more likly to be nobles and those who are nobles are
more likly to be important.

	From what i\'ve read, its more like the worlds are allowed to
do what they want--  within certain limits.  They have to pay taxxes
to the Imperium, follow certain \'High Laws\', and such forth.  Thus, it
could be said that every world has its own noble--  but those nobles
all rule their worlds diffrently.

Not playing GT.  Don\'t want to play GT.  But what keeps a GT player from
adding the LS capability in the form of portable life support
filters/equipment?  I\'m sure there is a vacuum shelter in the
Gurpsyclopedia somewhere which can provide atmosphere and heat for a week.

For that matter, does a Gurps Traveller character have to suit up to go to
the cargo bay?  If not, then there is pressure, and if there is pressure,
the task of recycling the existing atmosphere becomes even easier.

In Megatraveller (and some other versions IIRC) Life support is paid for
based on the number of passengers onboard for the time period.  I would
think that you just need to pay the additional fees and more of the same
\'stuff\' os brought on board to keep the life support apparatus operating
for the increased number of consumers.

Remember that in every design sequence (B3, HG, MT, FFS1&2) the volume of
the entire hull is used to calculate the life support requirements, not
just the stateroom/crew space volumes.  This implies that there is life
support service to the cargo bays, engineering spaces, even the fuel tanks,
and if there is service, people can be housed there.

Even if there were no life support, or inadequate life support, such
apparatus can be brought in, set up, and taken down afterwards.

In your original statement, you said "Crew and passenger staterooms can be

Are they not carrying high passengers?  How about Mid then?

The *entire* cargo bay is an auxilliary fuel tank?  You carry no cargo?

Again, in your original question you phrased it "So I can bring quite a few
steerage passengers or troops...."  Steerage passengers aren\'t employees,
altho\' the troopies may be.  And Vacc suits are expensive - generally if you
can afford to have one, you won\'t be travelling steerage.  So the ship must
provide.

There is more to life support than providing pressure.  Air supply and
exhaust, filtering, humidification (or de-humidification), gas testing,
heating or chilling spaces, compartmentalization (the ability to isolate
each compartment from the others in case of damage), etc....  Life support
equipment should be expensive, need maintenance, and (probably) not be
installed in areas not designed for habitation.  When you need to work in
areas not designed for life support (i.e. cargo bays, voids, fuel tanks,
etc), then there are procedures to follow in order to make \'em safe (or at
least keep you alive.)

While it\'s true that you pay for life support based on the volume of the
vehicle, in reality this is totally irrational -- life support requirements are
dependent on the # of people supported as well as the volume.  This can be
handled by assuming that the weight/cost of a stateroom includes some life
support.  However, given the amount of power available to your average
traveller ship, upgrading the life support to handle more people probably isn\'t
a big deal (might add a hundred kilos and a cubic meter per bunk for
indefinate-duration life support.  Oh no, you\'ll run out of space quickly!). 
Alternately, the life support can probably be run at higher throughput for at
least a while, though the air will start smelling sort of funny and eventually
you\'ll have breakdowns...

It might be reasonable to assume that once recharge fees exceeded a certain
value life support would start failing, however.

Not on a regular basis, but with the right preparation
and in special circumstances, it\'s a good idea.

The drawback for players will be the cost of repairing the
overloaded lfe support systems.

Your air _can\'t_ run out, it\'s got nowhere to go ! :-)

What can happen, though, is that your filtering mechanisms
and oxygen regenrators can become overloaded, resulting in
lowered oxygen densities, and high carbon-dioxide levels, etc.

This can happen in poorly-maintained ships even without
overloading, the ISS Scout is notorious for it\'s poor
scrubber systems, which leave a foul smell in the ship
unless the  filters are replaced reguuilalry

However, like all systems they can be boosted, patched,
and pushed.

I once captained a military ship which was pressed into
service as part of an attempted evacuation of a planet.

Our engineers performed a few customary miracles
and we got out to the nearest naval base with some
twenty times the normal ship\'s complement on board,
all cold berths full as well.

The ship stank and she needed an overhauil when
we offloaded, and there was the risk that the jury
rigged systems would fail, and we had a couple of
nasty incidents where we need to use maximum
force to maintain order, and for the last few hours
moving in-system the crew were using all the EVA,
drop-ship, lifeboat, and battle-armour life support
systems, with the refugees beginning to pass out
in the corridors and hangar bays but we made it.

I got an official reprimand for putting my ship in danger,
(there was no way we could have defended the ship
 had we been attacked ) but an unofficial "well done",
made some very influential freinds, and provided
a much needed boost in Navy public relations.

A GT player could fit 4 people per displacement ton, with bunks, life support,
and food, into the cargo hold, no problem (might be a pain to assemble). A
5-ton block of steerage would cost $17,000 and hold 20 people, with a single
20-person life support unit and power requirements which would be insignificant
as long as power didn\'t fail (about 10 kW per block); it would give each person
a bunk and 20 cf (700 liters) of cargo space, some of which would be occupied
by food, and would weigh around ten tons, which is less dense than typical
cargo.  This would be virtually impossible in any other version of traveller,
though it really isn\'t all that unrealistic.

The air recycling capabilities for a GT ship are fairly limited (so the air
would become stale with time) but the entire ship is pressurized.

It\'s worse than that. Gravitic sensors pick up contragrav.

I am seriously thinking of building a hi-tech rotary-winged aircraft,
because it may not be survivable to use contragrav in a high-threat

Exactly, that was one of the scenarios I considered, when I first heard
about the GT world background. (Just check out Dan Simmons´ Hyperion
cantos for a well thought out example of What _really_ big AIs running
rampant can do to a human society.) 
Of course SJG probably wouldn´t want to totally slag the big nice
universe they just went to so much trouble saving. Guess the Cymbeline
stuff is mostly out of official GT campaign.

I have implied it a few times.  Allow me to be explicit now.  They are not
carrying passengers.  I was literally referring to the *staterooms* not the
*passengers*.  A High Passenger gets their own stateroom for the entire
journey, as you said, that is the definition of a high passenger.

>The *entire* cargo bay is an auxilliary fuel tank?  You carry no cargo?

Maybe, Maybe not.  In this specific case there happen to be multiple bays
on different decks.  I fail to see the problem with \'mixing\' the two
(assuming the cargo is well secured).  Cargo containers are fairly robust
vs. tampering, and, if necessary, a temporary partition could be erected to
make the space feel less like a cargo bay and hide the cargo containers
from view.

Right,  sorry.  this specific example I\'m dealing with they are troops.
For passengers the question applies.  That still doesn\'t change my answer.
If you want to carry passengers, you need such things handy, what keeps
them from being handy?  Expense?  That\'s not really pertinent, a Standard
Vacc Suit runs Cr7000 new, and could probably be picked up used for half
that in the "cheap skate" scenario, but even at full price the expense is
paid for by the passenger tickets over a few trips - its a one time cost.

I am assuming that if it isn\'t potable, small, portable facilities can be

This is contradicted by the design sequences.  Again, the *full volume* of
the hull is used to figure out the amount of life support to be installed.
Therefore the *Full volume* of the hull is covered under life support.

As for expense, full life support, including heat, lights, atmosphere,
water, food, sealed environment and waste recycling in Megatraveller has
the following costs;

Volume; .013 kl per kl of hull
Cost;  cr510 per kl of hull
weight; .013 tons per kl of hull
power;  .004 MW per kl of hull.

So, assuming for the moment it did need to be installed, my 50 ton
bunkroom/cargo bay would require .65kl of equipment at a cost of Cr.25,500,
weighing .65 tons and consuming .02 Megawatts.  Not insignificant, but not
terribly significant either...oh, and (again, in MT) engineering crew is
based on the power plant and propulsion costs while maintanence crew is
based on total hull cost and volume.  There is not an increased burden on
either crew if environmental equipment is increased

Out looking for pirates (duck!) and outworld coalition members (Zhos,
Vargr, Sword Worlders).

Seriously, the Navy is not (IMO) the State Police, nor the Coast Guard.
They have more important missions than measuring toilets to make sure they
match regulation sizes.  There are certain "Imperial Crimes" which are
worthy of their attention IMTU, but they are fairly significant.  The
Navy\'s main job is to patrol for real threats and maintain a constant state
of readiness.

going to be convicted and spend several lifetimes in jail unless he 
testifies, and evidence is brought to the courts regarding the fiends 
that run the ring.  Seems the NPC\'s loved one is still in their grips 
and he\'s willing to die himself to save her life.

PCs can embark on attempts to infiltrate the situation, learn of the 
Imperial laws that are being infringed, get queasy over your vivid 
descriptions of the work-camp/sweat-shop/stack-em-like-cordwood 
scenes as they work their way through the adventure.  (Infiltration 
of crew, as a passenger, etc.  They all have possibilities.) Finally, 
end with the chase scene where they nearly get caught, or the freedom 
scene where they free the people working as slaves on some plantation 
on the southern continent, or whatever, and the PCs get a real good 
view of the seedy side of colonization.

I.e., show them the bad side, and make it personal.  Then you won\'t 
have to worry as much about it.  If the PCs start getting too much 
into it, hunt them down with Imperial Law and deal with it with no 
remorse.  Unless, of course, it turns out to be a game that you and 
everyone else enjoy!  :)  (Hope not, but different strokes for 
different folks.)

I tried to leave a lot to the imagination and not suggest too 
specific a course with this.  I can provide more solid suggestions, 
if they are desired.  But I hope this helps...

Also, this brings up another thought-provoking question.  What about 
slavery, indentured labor, immigration scenarios like the one above, 
and similar activities in the Traveller Universe?  Where in Charted 
Space is it practiced?  How is it handled?  How are the people 
protected?  What kind of adventures could be run, or have been run, 
around this kind of scenario?

In Service,
Jason

I think you mean "later _dissemination_ at leisure."  ;-)

And the moral of the story, children, is _never_ allow data of unknown
properties play in your main computer, directly or indirectly.  ("Put
those data down!  You don\'t know where they\'ve been!")

I suspect that this is in part because this doesn\'t make for a particularly

Damnation.... I knew I was missing something somewhere!

But you made a math error there two:

(Pi * (0.5 * (Tls + Tlw)^2 * A))/ Acs.

as 0.5AT^2 is 0.5 * A * A * T....order of operations PEMDAS... Gawds I hate

always show my steps!!!). THanks for catching the missing term.

Using striker, in 1986, I designed a (to borrow a term from Space Opera)
TurboGrav gunship. Worked out to be fairly light, using gav lift and some
thrust, with massive jet engines for thrust, aerodynamic lift available
(and the thrust could be added from the gravitics when going fast enough),
twin VRF Gauss GUn with multiple tac-missile rails dogfighter/ground
assault craft. Light on the armor, but it would do in excess of Mach 1, and
only cost a couple of million credits.... and could strafe like mad!

No turrets, tho...

Keep in mind that many of us assume ImpMarDiv\'s include the "Strike From
Space" mode: Grav tanks descend from orbit under their own power... the
paired dorsal/ventral turrets allow both fire-up and fire down, and allows
you to basically do a slightly higher popup one down to get TWO weapons on
a target, or one weapon on each of two targets during a popup.

IMTU, the ImpMar doesn\'t use ventral turrets so they can still do a "Belly
Landing" with some emergency vents from the PP...to pull the nose up after
a PP or Susp hit. Also, that way you can set down conviniently, without
landing gear.

Id be willing to consider tweaking rgrav sensor ranges so that they aren\'t

certain death for grav tanks. IO made up the numbers in the FFS2 addenda
to make them marginally useful for spacecraft (but not very useful.) We
could (for example) massively reduce their range in a grav field, or vs
contragrav (as opposed to thruster plates) on the grounds that t-plates
make bigger gravity waves, os something simiklar.

Also note that in any case grav sensors don\'t proviude precise enough cuing
to fire a direct fire weapon at someone (although I suppose that\'s moot
since you can always fire a missile or light target up with LIREAR.)

The game Renegade Legion: Prefect had rules for grav formations moving in
"high mode" i.e., up in the clear blue yonder, free of terrain

What about Mass Drivers?  IIRC, the Regency Combat Vehicle Sourcebook (or
whatever it was called) had a Trepeda variant armed with a big MD.  Better
penetration, more ammo, for the same weight and power.  While PD fire would
easily take care of (relatively) slow missiles and the vulnerable HEAP
warheads, a solid slug of bonded superdense moving like a bat out of hell
(figure upwards of 3000 mps) would provide more of a challenge.

I just a quick 3G3 design for a 6cm MD that does 19 Dam and weighs about 13
tons.  It\'s also 8m long...

Never underestimate the power of guided missiles.  I can easily imagine a
brilliant missile that will evaluate it\'s chances of hitting before
launching; refuses to engage anything it doesn\'t have a good chance of
successfully engaging.

Also, the primary ADA weapon is going to be a dedicated heavy laser,
designed exclusively to hit small, fast targets.

At last!  Someone else who sees this the way I do..  If there is one lesson
that we\'ve learned from modern warfare is that no matter how advanced the
technology, staying low and hiding is always a good idea.  One of the main
reasons for the US army switching to the 5.56mm standard was the
realization that most infantry encounters happen at less than 200m.  Having
a heavy rifle that was accurate out to 1km was a waste, when that weight
could be better used for additional ammo.

The same holds true for tankers.. except for desert warfare, most tanks
encounter each other at fairly short ranges.  This makes crew training and
morale the most important factor in any technologically-balanced force.  In
late 1944, the Russians had achieve parity with the Germans in tank
technology, but the Russian crews were experienced, whereas most of the
best German crews were dead.  Made a great deal of difference on the
Eastern Front.

I prefer the traditional box, since it does cut down on the visual cross
section from the front.  One thing all tankers know is to keep your front
armor towards the enemy, something that will still apply in the 57th Century.

Or, to paraphrase Patton: "its job is to fix and destroy the enemy by means
of fire, shock and maneuver."

And would probably require main gun lock-down, careful storage of all

One of the most valuable things we can accomplish is distracting the tread
(or grav)heads.  Even if a missile doesn\'t penetrate, that shock is doing
to scare the shit out of the crew, and all their attention is going to be
suddenly focused on finding that missileman.  Properly timed, and
anti-armor infantry ambush could cover for the start of a friendly armored
thrust.

Mostly for different reasons.

GURPS really isn\'t into "one" way of doing things and I don\'t think they
 would have a fundamental objection to persenting an alternate where
Virus (or something like it, occured).  However, I\'m guessing they would
see a Virus setting source book as something that wouldn\'t have enough
appeal (esp. since they aren\'t going to be able to develop it the way they
are developing GT) and wouldn\'t warrant pushing back some other GT
supplement (in addition to the question about rights, AFAIK Mark Miller
doesn\'t have rights to Virus).  The feeling I get from SJG is that they think
they need to have  a really well supported setting and they aren\'t
going to be interested in diluting that into two subsettings, each of which
has mediocre support.

Now that isn\'t to say that they wouldn\'t welcome a pyramid article on
(say :-) using GT and Reign of Steel/Robots to run a Virus compaign.
Nor is there anything to stop you from making one up yourself.

Except that Solomani ships never picked up on the "need" for jump
dimming.  As a Solomani myself, I prefer to design ships with _lots_ of
spare power.  Obviously, such ships don\'t _need_ to worry about jump
dimming to send every possible Watt to the jump drive.

I always figured that Solomani designs mirrored American attitudes, and
had power plants large enough to run everything at once (just as late
20th century American automobiles can generally cruise at 75+ mph, with
air conditioning, truly impressive stereo, headlights, off-road lights,
and whatever other options running _all at once_).

OTOH, the Vilani, having lived in a culture of scarcity (starting with
food), tend to design ships with the smallest power plant possible for
the ship\'s mission.  Jump dimming is one way of cutting energy corners
to save valuable resources.

One of the best SF modules for a traveller game IMHO is \'Bugs in the
system\'. It is situated on a gas giant mining platform and has the players
trying to get the station to work whilst the bugs are playing with it. It
kept my players amused for a couple of sessions :) Then I put them through
the \'Volturnus\' series, you know the one where they crash on a planet, It
was kind of tricky with them being Space Marines and all but I just through
in some Kafer (from 2300) and things worked out nicely. Also it was a good
way to give them psionics which they could not otherwise have gained (got
psionics from the squids).

Basically I would say that most of the SF modules can be used and are quite
fun to use with a bit of tweaking here and there.

	IMHO, deep meson sites are a real bitch to deal with.  A while back
I was pondering how best to deal with them... so I designed a mondo huge
even by FSA standards mass driver round, and with a bit of help with the
physics from Leonard, quickly realized that the best way to deal with a
deep meson site is either blind it completely, or zot it with another MG.

	Yes Ditzie, you can call the 4-4s the Rabid Impregnable Beach Ball

Superdense?  Admittedly, you will run into problems as all the exterior
sensors are vapourized, but you can always build backups a few cm into the
armour so that they\'ll be re-exposed as the superdense ablates.

	Go for a 30-cm thickness prototype.  Tell Finance I say so, tell
Auntie Fiiaraa in Dispensary to give you double the usual dosage of the
little yellow pills, and go to town.  I\'m sure Marketing will be able to

OK the effects of Heplar on my TRAVELLER players  was they never took
running jumps and thought most ships would do about 1g to jump points and
caculate on the way for transition to J-space. We also assumed that from
the space port to the j-point would be monitored by the starport. So we\'re
on the run from baron x because he wants his wife back. use laser comm to
tell him you got naked pics of her and dare him to fire on you. if he does
fire Radio out a GK and call him a pirate there had to be other ships
around. If a Running jump was needed they out ran the j-point to caculate a
point for jump and took the time to make the task more exact. out system
was all bad. Wilderness refueling was only done when A the planet orbited
the Gas Gaint B. At a water world. not like in the old days when you saved
those pennies on fuel.

<sarcasm>
You\'re not allowed to ask any of these questions as they would require defining
and explaining how jumpspace works.  Since "canon" doesn\'t explain this, any
definition would go against canon and thus you would start a huge flame war
(again) regarding jumpspace.
</sarcasm>

Seriously though, these are exactly the sort of questions that caused me to
abandon "canonical" jump drives.  Basically, just make up your own mind.

Personally, I think a  grav tank with side ball turrets
sort of  like the old WWI Mark I  would make sense.

Both turrets will be capable of firing up, down, front
and back. with each of them covering a side. The
top would be free for sensor arays or other
weaponry .

I doubt the reasoning behind top turrets in modern
tanks  ( being able to reduce overal height and firing
from hull-down positions ) will mean very much in
a grav-propelled, fusion-weaponed environment

I suspect the turrets would be "popped" for action
like the weapons pod of the F119, to reduce drag
and sensor signature during transit

Technically the Germans did not brake the Hague convention at Ypres. The 
Convention banned the use of toxic or asphyxiating _shells_. The Germans 
deployed the gas as a cloud from cylinders!

How do I pronounce it? It may differ from others, but this is how I
pronounce it:

INnie giveARE

Capitals are where the accents are. That\'s innie (as in Mini or Minnie
Driver), "give" as in "give me a break" and "are" as in "are we going out
tonight?".

Cthulhu does most of the work, really. Well, Cthulhu\'s pretty shiftless, and
has been accused of being a shiftless layabout with no shopping agenda...
Cthulhu can work if need be.

>5. Can you force an emergency exit from jumpspace?


If Cthulhu feels it\'s important enough Cthulhu might force an emergency
exit. When tea time comes, many ships have found themselves in deep space
while Cthulhu goes off to meet with Minnie Driver and throw back some Earl
Grey.

Seriously though, I\'ve seen no canon sources that say anything really
conclusive on these subjects. IMTU the jump drive forces the ship into
extradimensional "jump space". Jump space doesn\'t have a "look" per se, but
something stranger. Close your eyes tightly and press on your eyelids, not
long though, it might do damage. That\'s a rough approximation of what
J-Space is like. Finally, and emergency exit from J-Space _is_ possible.
However, due to the "unique topography" of Jump Space it\'s something like a
misjump, only much, much worse. Imagine cutting the J-Drive and finding
yourself in deep, deep space really, really far away from home.

The Three Dolphin club was invented by G. Harry Stine as a better name
thhan "Zero G club". The name is based on the factoid that due to the
low friction environment in water, it takes *three* dolphins to get it
on. He suggested that the same might be true in free fall.

Frankly, I don\'t think that there will be any sort of special club of
the sort you describe. After all, do we have "clubs" for folks who\'ve
gotten it on while on an ocean going vessel? Nope. And we haven\'t been
sailing as long as humans have been using spacecraft in the Third
Imperium.

Consider, they\'ve got 2000 years of jump drive just for the Solomani.
The Vilani have at least another thousand. Humans on Earth haven\'t deep
ocean vessels for much more than 1500 years. 

Space travel is *old* technology in Traveller. So old that we just
don\'t have the "feel" for it. 

Chemical rockets are a technology as old as *iron* tools are. Fusion
isn\'t a lot newer. Ditto for jump.

Fission power is likely to be regarded the way we regard water and wind
power. "Quaint" (even though there are "hi-tech" versions for
specialized uses).

Given that a typical X port is a "bare, flat chunk of bedrock" this
actually works nicely. We just assume that the bedrock is a nice thick
lava flow. Under it you have a layer of sandstone that goes up into the
hills. The result is *pressurized* water. Drill thru the cap rock and
you get an artesian well. 

This would make you poular with the natives (a nearby water source in
an otherwise dry area) *and* gives you a source of unrefined fuel. And
the natives can hardly object to you using water you produced by "magic".

BTW, that *is* an important point. In a lot of landing areas, the
natives will *not* be happy if you use up tons of the local water,
given that water will tend to be scarce in the sort of areas that are
safe to land a ship without constructing a port first.

I think that there\'s a limit on *how* far it can lower the pressure.
But frankly, the hazard is no worse than that of tear gas and a *lot*
better than firehoses or "rubber bullets".

Not sure about this one canonically, but IMTU, nope.

Nope.  If you spend more than a week in jumpspace, you can pretty much figure 
you\'ve misjumped.  This doesn\'t mean you can break out.  Personally, I go for 
the \'constant tunnel\' theory of how it works.

>Name: 	FSA OKA-SQ-18X62E(5) RTS (Riot Termination System).
>Damage: 	4 (12).
>TL: 		12.
>Range:	Medium.
>Shots:	4000 (ROF 2000 RPM).
>Mass:		76 Kg empty, 246.5 loaded.
>Reloads:	243 Kg (4000-round cassette)
>Cost:		27860 Cr (includes 1 full cassette; bare gun is 3450).
>Reload cost:	20960 Cr.
