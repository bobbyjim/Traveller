I suspected that was the case, but it\'s the kind of thing that the tabloid

I would suspect that the Imperium would reserve the right to try any
Imperial forces, if only to emphasise their jurisdiction. I suspect that
they may have a buried option to hand the forces over to civilian
(planetary) justice though in certain areas.

[justification of reasonableness]

The problem is that there are also a wide range of other values
for this (and related numbers) that are also reasonable.  One
of the problems here has been that people run through numbers
that are "reasonable" to prove the something in the background
has to be a certain way (piracy can exist, X-boats have to
be jump-6, etc.).  However, this only proves that is it "reasonable"
if things were that way (ie they "could" be that way).  Not that
another way is unreasonable.  Put a lot of faith in "analyses"
but most I\'ve seen very few that didn\'t rely on estimations of
numbers that couldn\'t give another conclusion with another
set of "reasonable" numbers.

I\'m not 100% clear on what you want to know but I\'ll give it a shot.
The book is (I think) $20.95.  It is the first book on Alien
Races for GURPS Traveller and it is by Steve Jackson Games
(who puts out GURPS Traveller, the Traveller background using
GURPS game mechanics).  It covers the Vargr and Zhodani and
three(?) minor alien races.

An interface shuttle is about 4 megacredits, once you start to use
contragravity.

I find it very hard to believe that any world that engages in interstellar
trade couldnt afford the equivalent of a couple of aluminium dingies to
take cargo from ship to shore.

Heck, for a different sort of campaign, pick some dirtball (Beck\'s World in
Regina subsector looks good), and have the PCs issued with a brand-shiny
new Imperial Warrant authorising them to take over the management of the
starport facility. Give em a slightly used, IN-surplus Gig, a collection of
sidearms, and one-way tickets to Becks World.

Great. So 300 blokes with shovels can build us a minimum starport, or you
park just outside a seaport.

Seaports are better, becuase they should already have warehouses, ferries,
tugs, rail links and so on.

Look, we figure 20 or 30 megacredits should be enough to bribe the
Subsector Admiral to issue the appropriate paperwork for the Baby PAW.
Leeeeeegals are working on how much it would cost to get a licence for a
full-sized PAW ... and Oberlindes have a more law abiding rep than FS does.

Thats better, in that it\'s KCr 4 net per 4 dtons of stateroom. If we
arrange for the dumping of the KCr 2 \'life support charge\' off a bridge in
Jersey, we can make interstellar travel even more affordable. As it should be.

This was considered, but the Decafreighter is assumed to have missile

Yep. Even better if you rip half the gig\'s t-plates and replace them with a

Well, if the boat is based on the ground, the ship gets to carry 18 dtons
more cargo, which means there is more potential profit on the route.

A lot of trust is needed, as the freighter captain is relying on the
groundpounders for her resupply of fuel.

Not a problem, comrade. Da, I land most anything, once.

But seriously, G:T needs partial streamlining. I dont have Gurps:Vehicles,
but the p155 sidebar in G:T states \'Streamlined hulls used the lifting body
and "very good" streamlining features\'. What happens if we dump the lifting
body, and take the streamlining features down to "poor" or "average" ?

Well, the real effect of streamlining in G:T is to prevent you from
disintegrating due to vibration while traveling in atmosphere at supersonic
speeds, and you need very good or better streamlining to do this -- thus, the
streamlining is sufficient for aerobraking or atmospheric skimming.  If you\'re
willing to come to a stop and float down you don\'t need _any_ streamlining.  Of
course, this is true in standard traveller as well, despite canon arguments to
the contrary.  There\'s absolutely no reason for most unstreamlined ships in
traveller to be unable to enter atmosphere, atmosphere just isn\'t all that
dangerous.  A vehicle with the minimum hull permitted on a traveller spaceship
(what, AV 20 isn\'t it?), of minimum size for a jump ship, with a density of,
say, 0.25 tons/m^3 (350 tons), in the middle of large tornado (250 mph winds)
is unlikely to be detectably damaged, and if landed, won\'t be moved (though if
poorly situated, it might be knocked over, and it will be a pain to fly, though
doable if it has enough thrust to pick itself up).  Your average traveller ship
is capable of withstanding midsized artillery -- streamlining really isn\'t all
that important.  The only things remotely subject to damage are any systems
located outside of armor (i.e. electronics and sensors), and atmospheric
hardening realistically should modify the cost and weight of your electronics,
_not_ your hull.

I don\'t doubt it. I\'m sure that there\'d be a market for it. Jump-6 ships
aren\'t all that much more expensive than Jump-4 ships. Extra fuel costs are
a joke. What this means is that the Xboat system would be slow to upgrade to
meet any competition.

Worlds along major population routes would most likely be visited by
independent Jump-6 couriers on a regular basis. I don\'t see these networks
being too large though...  A J-6 network would lose its speed advantage over
too great of a distance.

The advantages would shine in subsector or sectorwide traffic, however.

Well, not matter how they drink, they can hold the bowl
up to their mouths.  Nor do I know of any canon that
says their lips are that rigid (they can talk and speak
human languages after all).  I personally think that
treating Vargr as "intellegent dogs" is a mistake.

A number of us argued against this in playtest, but either
we didn\'t prevail or the art didn\'t reflect it.

Actually, most major real world corporations have a mixture of long term and
short term investments. Although the emphasis is on long term investments,
short term investments can really pay off.

In the Imperium, we\'re probably talking about stock trading on subsector
wide and sector wide levels. Every extra hour would count. As far as I know,
canon is silent on the stock markets of the Imperium.

For Delgado\'s stock traders, it could be very useful to find out that
Makhidkarun has announced a major new product line even just hours or days
before the news hits the local markets. That way, they can buy up 20
MegaShares of Makhidkarun stock while it\'s still cheap. On the flip side,
the same traders would be happy to find out that the product line has failed
even hours before the effects are felt in the market. This way, they could
unload the same 20 MegaShares before the market goes bananas.

Especially if that branch of Delgado needs capital for a new toy line and
needs it quickly...

Just because individual traders might not gain too much doesn\'t mean that
megacorporate traders wouldn\'t.  Most of the money traded on the stock
market would be megacorporate money, and they would stand to lose or gain
much more money and they\'d be able to finance internal networks. Since the
networks would already exist, selling space on their J-6 courier ships\'
databanks would be extra profit.

Keep in mind that I think traffic between say, Core and Daibei would go by
either Xboats or single couriers, but I think active networks would be
common on a smaller scale...

Just my 2 cents.

> Good Idea, Same ship, converted to GT.

> Purchase Price: 13.6MCr (with a 20% volume discount)

Note: the volume discount _does not apply_ to GURPS traveller, it is already
included in standard vehicles.  Vehicles which are not constructed in volume
are double cost.

Note 2: there are some sub-optimal parts to how GT does module design -- for
example, you have redundant power production (manuever and jump) and it\'s not
clear that you really _need_ vector thrust.  Also, realistically you probably
still want at least two crew (pilot/navigator and engineer/gunner, for
example).

If you want to be really efficient, break the power plant out from the drives,
and don\'t include enough power to run both simultaneously; this gives us:
2 units unpowered J-drive (6 tons, 1.5 spaces, 20 megawatts, 6 MCr)
8 units(400T) unpowered manuever drive (30 tons, 8 spaces, 40 MW, 1.2 MCr)
1 unit power plant (4 tons, 1 space, 40 MW output, .4 MCr).
This is 10.5 spaces, 40 tons and 7.6 MCr; the parts it replace were 12 spaces,
42 tons, and 7.8 MCr -- saving us .2 MCr, 2 tons, and giving an additional 1.5
spaces for cargo (total 44+3 in turret).  Total 16.75 MCr.

For the true cash-squeezers, CG is (including power) 3.5 tons, 1 space, .6 MCr
per 5,000 tons.  Thus, we can drop half our manuever drive and power plant
(saving 4.5 spaces, 17 tons and .8 MCr) and put in a 1,000 ton CG unit (.7
tons, .12 MCr, .2 spaces) -- rounding volumes up, we reduce cost by .68 MCr (to
16.07 MCr) and get 4 more spaces for cargo (48+3 in turret).  Half a G is
plenty for travelling out to the jump limit, and the CG unit actually increases
our load limit.

"Church of the Chosen Ones" is a Vargr sect that believes that GrandFather
will come back for them. There a sort of Superiorists sect who look at the
Unchosen as beneith them.

IMTU that I am finishing out, the Ancients weren\'t the first space farers
(haven\'t decided if they were second yet or not). They also weren\'t the
first to pull races from Terra, the "first ones" <***ducking to avoid
flames from B5 haters***> rescued a Trans Repto-Mamillian semi humanoid
species, the G\'Hal from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs and
transported them to a sector about 20 sectors from the Imperium. This race
does not worship this race, nor do they conciter them superior once they
themselves developed jump drive (in conjunction with the humans that were
later placed there by another group of ancient space farers (Droyns? I
haven\'t decided)). Neither the humans or the G\'Hal hold to any superior
"beings", just generally the greater power of the universe itself (I\'d
guess you conciter them somewhat agnostic).

IMHO, one advantage of avoiding modern religeons in campaigns, and in SF
writing of any kind, is the ability to look at modern issues outside the
religeous dogma that create them. (Note: My hat off to JMS for doing this
well)

Ian, and Bruce.

To answer your replies at the same time. I used the standard Hvy Laser and
Lt. Spinal mount from Andy Akin\'s spead sheet. If you have an unaltered
vesion of that then those are the number (V.3+). I\'m a small time gearhead,
I only build what I want for my games and really don\'t worry too much over
the weapons, since I\'ve never really played any of the Traveller ship to
ship combat systems. I\'ve played at them but they are usually to slow paced
to interject into a role-playing session, and we use a totally different
system for table top gaming, Star Fleet Wars, Star Fleet Battles (rarely),
and we\'re dabbling with Full Thrust. I design Traveller ships more with the
thought of having something to build deckplans around than from a point of
veiw of how the would stand up in TCS or Highguard, etc.

As I said on TWG recently, the only complaint I have with any of the
technical manuals (FFS, FFS2, etc.) is that they do not contain (nor does
any of the other books) a system to translate the "real world science" into
game terms, so I just plug in a suitable number of the stock weapons.

Perhaps you serious Grognard types could use the rules to generate a series
of GOOD weapons for those of us that really don\'t want to?!! Kind of use the
FFS books the way I think they were meant for? Say a group of weapons
suitable to be mounted on Free Traders, Lt. Mil. Ships, Hvy Mil Ships etc.
in a table type format?

Anyway, as for adding in more than one LIDAR, the thought really never
occured to me to do so, but I can see the logic once it\'s been pointed out.

I always just assumed there was one LIDAR and all of the weapons
workstations worked off of information fed to them by it! Say, there\'s
another area that could be explored, a monograph on "What
Constitutes GOOD Sensors" for various grade ships, civilian, Lt. Mil., etc?

I\'ve dl\'ed you sensor rules Bruce, and started to read them on a number of
occations but they are far more technical reading than I really like to do
outside of work, so I keep drifting away before I finish. I will try to get
through them, promise! But how about a simple set of tasks and modifier
tables to add to a role-playing situation.

All of this is not to sound un appriciative of your comments, in fact
exactly the opposite. You guys are among the top gearheads on the list and I
appriciate the comments! I\'d just like a primer to help those like me learn
to "plug and play" the RIGHT components.

That depends on afew things.  The problem with this idea is that you
need fuel to make the jumps, and most ships will only carry enough fuel
for one jump. After that one jump, you need to refuel if you expect to
get back in a reasonable amount of time.  That\'s the reason that Rifts
are such a deterrant to travel;  there\'s no gas giants there to mine
from, no imperial naval bases to purchase fuel from.  That leaves you
basically stranded.
 
If you *do* have a ship with enough fuel to make two jumps without
refueling, this enables you to get past the empty space that is soo much
of the univerise.  If there is a gas giant in the other system, that is.
You need some method to get back home, and a Gas Giant is the only way
that you have available;  if the system was explored and settled, you\'d
beable to get fuel there but it\'s not.  Without there being a gas
giant in the star system you were jumping too, you\'d need *four* units
of fuel if you wanted to get home.

Now, I imagine that most of the Vilani ships carried two fuel parsecs
worth of fuel, just so they could get back home if there wasn\'t a gas
giant in the system they arrived in.  Or hell, if there weren\'t
*planets* in the system they arrived in.  However, fuel for four parsecs
would be abit too much for a society that\'s just recently reached the
stars.  So, for most purposes, worlds off the mains were off limits.

You know I wonder that no-one said this before. I\'ve been toying with the
idea that Grandfather lied! I mean we have his word that he wiped out his
children after getting pissed that they were ignoreing him, then build his
pocket universe so that he could have a little privacy to do his research.

What if he lied?

- - What if the children were wiped out by "Someone or thing else" and
Grandfather build his hole and pulled it in after him to hide? Might explain
his quickness to destroy the ship that carried the humans into his PU.

- - Likewise, what if some of the kids did escape, and are licking their
wounds somewhere, waiting to find Granddaddy\'shiding spot?

- - Or are waiting for their "weapons", the Big Six, to mature enough to go
after him.

- - Or maybe, the Big Six are Granddaddy\'s defenses?

- - Or his weapons against "Someone or thing else"?

Hummm, who said that the Ancients lost their kick when their secret was
revealed way back?

        Now *THAT* is trolling...  I\'ll refer ou to a few of A.Eienstien\'s

Find a good book on the history of religion. There were philosophers who

        I didn\'t read that (nor do I think it should be read) as meaning
that a planetary mass HAS to be there to come out of jump.  Afterall, if
that was true then the Spinward Marches would have been Virus Bait in
the New Era. (the Domain of Deneb was warned by people using secret fuel
caches in the Great Rift.  I doubt the caches were planet sized)

        Rather, that means that you automatically come out of jump if
you get too close to a planet.  You don\'t HAVE to be too close to a
planet to come out of jump.

        Hi, Tommy!
        I personally don\'t think you could get a megacorp to exist the way
they are described in canon.  As described by Ian Whitchurch, the return
rates should be small in any TU on corporate earnings.  That makes risk
factors on off-world development even more "chasmic" for megacorps, because
there are a lot of things that could erode that margin.  Major corporations
only spend risk money on reasonably sure returns.  Or if the return is big
enough that one "good" job will pay for two "bad" and leave a margin.
        Further, how do you hold shareholder meetings?  It\'s all be proxy
vote.  System-wide companies, sure, that I believe.  Companies with
independant operations under the same name on several worlds, sure
(franchise model).  Centrally administered multi-sector conglomerates?  How?
        Again, I think the Roman Empire model is the most accurate....  The
local administrator is the local Power, and as long as the Taxes/ Profits/
what-have-you keep flowing back on a *yearly* basis to HQ/ Capital/ Head
Office then The Honchos don\'t send in some tactical Muscle to investigate.
The local administrator has got a goon squad/ security force/ garrison just
in case someone debates the power of his pen.
        The administrator gets directives back from The Honchoes on a *big
scale*.  "For the next year, this is what we need.  Over 3 years, we need to
see this.  In 5 years we will be positioning ourselves thusly.  In 10 years
we will be evaluating these areas."  He picks out the pieces important to
getting his next promotion and works on them.
        That\'s how I see it.  The comms lag is just too brutal, even with
Jp6 comms, to function well at any tigher level of management.

        Hi, Tommy!
        Really, you get into the Trek concept of a "Neutral Zone" or the
RealWorld(tm) concept of a DMZ.  When you lay down The Line on the star
chart that deliniates "Them/ Us", you base the NZ/DMZ width on maximum jump
for when it was drawn up.  So, in our FFW border, you\'d want a NZ/DMZ *at
least* 12 parsecs wide; ie, 2jp6.  Crossing that is a serious logistics
issue...  tanker support, etc.  Worlds in the DMZ/NZ are autonomous and
*loaded* with operatives from each side\'s espionage services, listening for
any hint of something *big* pulling in to port or the local Gas Giant.  And
these systems would be armed camps, anyway, a la Switzerland and Israel, to
keep from getting used as a doormat for someone\'s invasion fleet.

        A good rule of thumb is that an NZ/DMZ really needs to be 2.5x
maximum possible jump for the TL the NZ/DMZ is established.  15 parsecs even
rules out most accidental crossings of the NZ/DMZ by misjump.  This also
makes for situations where "old" borders are more vunerable/ incident prone,
since when the border was negotiated, mayber Max Jump was only *3* (NZ is ~7
parsecs), and now MJ is *6*.

        As to hunting down a marauder, you use the same concept of ops for
killing subs.  You say "I know he was HERE at TIME.  His maximum speed is
THIS.  I now have a circle that he must be inside;  what is most and next
most important in that circle.  Defend those HEAVILY.  Use all other assets
to search the rest of the circle to regain contact (establish a "datum"
point), so I can recenter my circle."

        The other thing you need is "Border Interceptors" capable of Max
Jump stationed at every world within Max Jump of the border.  Small
(1500dton), fast, ranged, and mean (a PAWs or a missle bay, big USP) with
lots of screens and armor.  Single function craft;  move out from a datum
point in all directions of other systems within range to tip off the local
forces that there is a marauder and to reestablish the datum.  Also, *harass
the shit* out of the marauder and slow them down.

        Lastly, you need for the Other Governments to understand that this
is the sort of thing that leads to you rolling across the NZ/DMZ with
everything you can forward deploy with the intention of scrapping every ship
repair facility and convoy you encounter.  "Eye for an eye, plus the head
for good measure."

Good. Blame it on too many grade ten essays - after a while even small
mistakes and ambiguities leap out at me. I don\'t think that there\'s any
quesion that the USA is the primary consumer base, especially for GT. (And
Loren has said that English versions won\'t be in metric, so I\'ll have to
brush up on my French...)

Why not order BITS work from Britain?  The postage is reasonably cheap if
you\'re buying a bunch, and International Money Orders can be purchased at
any bank or post office.

You should also look at Signal GK (a British fanzine - professional
writing, amateur art, xerox printing).  Phil MacGregor\'s Dark Star
electronic magazine is also very good.  Roger Myrhe did a lot of work on
the Vargr extents, but I\'m misplaced his address and can\'t find it this
week.

Some probably would. Some wouldn\'t care. 

Up here in the Great White, we tend to get a lot of ads aimed at the US
market, many for products that aren\'t available up here. Irritating when
the offer is only valid in the US (leading me to wonder why they advertise
the product in a Canadian edition of a magazine).  Imagine trying to buy a
101 book, and being told by Dom that BITS policy was not to sell overseas,
even when you were willing to pay extra...

Holidays could be another contentious issue. Try celebrating Canada Day in
Quebec City... or Remembrance Day in Japan.

I was thinking more of planetary years, although your point is well taken.

        You could even forgo the fighters and opt for something like the
Star Lance missile I posted;  how many hexes in G:T does 100g\'s cover?  Silo
based weapons with the kind of mean-streak I discussed about the Star Lance
are most likely better than fighters...  they can "get there" faster than
the fighter, for starters.

Fair enough.

*Thinks*

Lasers of 400 MJ and over are Phaser-1s. 250-400 MJ are P-2s, less than 250
P-3s.

Meson guns are Hellbores, obviously. PAWs are disrupters, CPAWs are Photon
Torpedos.

Missiles are drone racks.

Every 100 MW of power plant output gets you a engine box.

Yeah. The idea of \'Uncle Hengie\'s Catalog\' has been kicking around in my
head for a while. Build them as modules, for plugging into a QSDS/SSDS or
G:T type system.

Put in some rules about Imperial Regulations.

This has been debated a bit, and it is more than possible that there are in
fact rogue planet-sized bodies in the Rifts, and the secret trans-rift fuel
caches are based on this.

Alternativly, you use a big 2xjump-3 trader carrying a small jump-6 courier.

*grin* Once again, Michel, I disagree with almost everything you say :)

I believe that megacorporations would dominate precisely because of the
risk factors. Megacorps have functionally unlimited reserves ... as long as
they want to do it, they can.

Of course, this is not to say they would want to do everything, but they
could do almost anything they wished to do - they have the ability to pick
and choose from a platter of risks, in a way smaller corporations cannot.

Now, if something goes bad (say, twenty billion credits invested in the
re-industrialisation of Ruie), there are concequences. But it would take
many, many things going bad before a magacorp goes under. Far fewer things
than to send a company based on a single system under.

corruption trial of Warren Hastings in the House of Commons) ? How did the
Dutch East Indies Company work ?

Yup. The other thing to remember is that semi-autonomous branches of the
same company can quarrel. Dynamit-Nobel was cursed in the early 20th
century by vicious competition between their South African and South
American subsiduaries.

        Well, at least I am performing a useful function... =)
        I don\'t profess to have all the answers, just all the opinons... ;-)

        Thank-you.  You just cemented my whole problem with the Canon
arrangement right there...  How did they *get* to be Megacorps, if they only
things capable of "ignoring" the problems of operating on this scale *are*
megacorps?
        How brutally Darwinian is it?  At what TL, and thus jump and thus
comms rate, can you "grow" a Megacorp?
        Once you have the resources of a Megacorp to draw on, yes, only
Collosal bad luck or missmanagement will kill you.  In the meantime.....
And once the first Megacorp climbed the evolutionary ladder, why didn\'t it
EAT everything else threatening to become a Megacorp?
        Follow me now?  Or am I still missing something here?

        Massive independance.  The local shop heard from head office once a
quarter and the local administrator figured it out as they went along.  And
head office prided themselves on what a great job they were doing running
thier forward operations, having never seen  the place =)

  Well, a J-5 system is actually cheaper than a J-4 one. J-6 is subject
to design systems and much more tenuous economic assumptions.

  The economic equation is well put, although data density may make the
cargo capacity somewhat moot (i.e., if you have enough business to need
that much bulk storage then your economic problems are over).

  However, there are at least five effectively Imperium-wide lines (per B:7)
plus an assumed one sector-wide per sector. Each of these, in addition to all
of the other megacorps (and not even counting the various Imperial state
organs - IN/INI, Household, Army, Court, IMoJ, other bureaucracies) has more
than enough money to do so. That gives at least a half dozen good candidates
for establishing Imperium-wide sector capital-Capital links, and twenty-odd
for each individual sector in the absence of the larger version.

  In fact, _1%_ of the Imperial defense portion (1% of GDP) of the budget
of any of the Marches\' Big Four (Mora, Trin, Glisten, Rhylanor) could buy
the couriers to build a system to connect every March sub-sector capital
and Capital to that one world. Ship maintenance would then be no more than
BCr 2.0/p.a, or less than a Cr 0.25 per capita. If the inhabitants didn\'t
like that then they probably don\'t like anything outside their system.

  Not that there\'s anything wrong with being isolationist :)

I also use Andrew Akins\' Excel spreadsheet (version 3.2).  I did up a
replica of your design, and then optimized it as best I could.  Here are
some of my recommendations (if you like, I can e-mail you a .zip file
with my calculations):

BASIC STATISTICS

Carry your 20 troops as "extra troops", rather than as ship\'s troops. 
That saves you a couple of command positions (which saves you a couple
of bridge workstations).

ELECTRONICS

1.  Use the highest possible computer type.  That\'ll save you a couple
of crewmembers.

2.  Add a couple more laser comm units, another radio transceiver, and
boost the range of your radio to 1,000 AU (this will help you burn
through jamming, and enable you to talk to other planets in the system).

3.  Beef up the sensor suite.  As it stands, your PEMS has an effective
range of only 16,000,000 km, and your AEMS only 16,000 km.  To detect my
variant of your ship (advanced IR masking and a smaller power plant give
it a base IR signature of -0.5), you probably won\'t get a good detection
until about 5,000,000 km range.  OTOH, my variant, with a 14 rating
PEMS, can pick up a -0.5 IR sig ship at up to 50,000,000 km.  Lots more
room to maneuver.

4.  Add some ECM.  You can have a minimal ECM suite that takes up less
than 16 m^3.  You should be able to afford that much room.

5.  Add a level of stealth.  Make the enemy\'s AEMS work to find you.

6.  Use military or ultra black for your hull coating.  Costs more, but
it helps against those pesky LIDARs.

WEAPONRY

1.  Use the light laser turret, set for no buffer space, with X-ray
focal array, 68 discharge energy, ROF of 100, point defense ROF of 800,
and MFD present.  This gives you a smaller package, using less power,
with superior performance [(+5)1/2-2-2-2].  

2.  Reduce the default Light PAW to a tunnel length of 39.  This saves
you about 22 MW of power, with no USP degradation in performance.

PERFORMANCE

1.  Play around with the exact size of the drives.  I usually use three
digits after the decimal point.  Check your power needs often, and
reduce your power plant to fit.  You probably don\'t need more than 1g of
contra-grav performance (_big_ power drainer!).  Be willing to have a
couple of MW power shortfall.  Just check to ensure that you can run all
systems except fuel (or add batteries to make up the shortfall for a few
hours).

2.  Given the mission of this ship, I\'d go with extended life support,
and at least 12 weeks of food.  (Unless you\'re serving Excellent quality
meals, use an ordinary galley.)

3.  Add enough emergency low berths to accommodate the crew.  Helps
morale.

4.  Replace the meson and damper screens with a pair of sandcasters. 
You can\'t mount enough of a meson screen on a ship of this size to block
most meson gun shots, and damper screens are useless against det-laser
missiles.  By using the light lasers above, you can probably shoot down
missiles before they get to you.  Sandcasters are a better bet against
the class of ship this corvette should expect to face.

I\'ll admit that my variant cost a lot more (MCr 1,216.66), but I think
it\'s worth it.

  One possible explanation for the development of the mega-corps that I\'m
sure fits into Mr. Whitchurch\' model is that they developed in periods of
significant interstellar economic expansion. As such, the returns on such
investment would have made up for the increased risks, and only in an
environment where anything like explosive growth had stopped and "natural"
return rates been re-imposed would the resultant conglomerate accumulation
begin to look rather questionable.

  This has happened (roughly) before; IIRC it was more common during the `60\'s
and `70\'s, although we\'re seeing recurrent merger-mania nowadays (although now
it\'s mostly rationalizations instead of unrelated horizontal diversifications).

  How do they function? Poorly? It seems facetious, but there is the very
real possibility that many of the mega-corps are trying to do something
inappropriate
in the most efficient manner that they can devise. It certainly allows for a lot
of scenario possibilities without being impossible or even improbable. Gods know
it happens in the real world.

  If the thesis of the recent post "Economics of potential courier routes"
(re Al Morai and the "trivial" expense of building a Marches-wide J-5+
courier system) tends that way perhaps you could explain how?

  It may have that effect, but it only _costs_ as per the investment to
connect those few hundred systems; OTOH, it does access the revenue
potential of effectively 90%+ of the Imperium for world to world service.

  You do realize that having J-6 ships to "hang out" at predesignated
nexi waiting for a charter (at a premium, but that\'s what it really is)
is almost certainly the most expensive way of setting this up?

  Also, in a diverse society and economy there\'s going to be more than
just the annual budget or big contract announcements - there\'s going
to be _something_ most days that someone (probably many someones, but
certainly enough economic demand) wants to know ASAP, and the "one
courier per big piece of news" is a near useless approach to supplying
express courier service in that regime.

  There\'s two ways at least of doing roughly that. One is to offer
the discounted service under terms that don\'t guarantee delivery
by the scheduled date (re UPS) - this would be possible if the data
required on a given trip took more "cargo" capacity than the ship
had, although that seems unlikely given data storage density. Another
is to provide faster service over long (out of sector) distances by
sending it with the "larger-than-minimum-for-J-6" hull that a _parcel_
service might send every month to clean up backlogs, bumps, and discount
services. There might also be passengers* running steerage along with
the Marches to Ilelish Economy parcels.

  No and almost certainly yes, respectively. The economics are
being treated in detail elsewhere, but that involves calculations
using (questionable) GDW-provided figures.

Hello, everyone.  I\'m a long-time Traveller gamer who only recently 
joined the list.  I\'m not much of a talker, only commenting on things I 
haven\'t heard anyone respond to.  Nevertheless, I wanted to comment on a 
few things:

1. In Traveller-digest V1998 #1222, William F. Hostman included the 
following after his post.  Pardon me for being a Geek Code (and 
variants) novice, but could someone please explain it to me or refer me 
to a lexicon?  Thanks.

2. As far as the thread about higher jump xboat routes (and private 
sector courier service), I recall the first Traveller News Service 
segment I ever read was in JTAS issue 2, and it discussed the addition 
of L-Hyd drop tanks manufactured by (I believe) Tukera to expand the 
xboat routes to average jump-5.5.  Also, I remember a reference to the 
Imperiallines corporation and their fleet of jump-6 messanger ships.

3. In Traveller-digest V1998 #1223, I noticed this:
>From: Slick1483@aol.com
>Subject: Re: G:T Aliens Vol-1 is here!
>
>unsubscribe slick1483@aol.com
I\'ve seen the supplement and it isn\'t *that* bad!  Not enough to make me 
quit the Traveller list, anyway... ;)

Seriously, though, the new material from GURPS seems to be upholding the 
high quality standard that GDW established and Imperium Games maintained 
in the past.  This is encouraging for those of us who have played it for 
decades and weren\'t ready to see an excellent system fall to the 
wayside.

to offer some sort of bulk mail deal. For example, WidgetCo. (Glisten)

the packet launches they have a compact media packaged up for the major
centers that they communicate with. Priority messages are billed at a
higher rate but are beamed for immediate dissemination.

  Two Jumps later the packet hands off the CD equivalent while refuelling
at Trin, while arranging for the beaming of any urgent commo. A day or two
later the CD is downloaded onto the WidgetCo. (Trin) system, where messages

  A case that Cr 0.01 annual per person that matters (i.e., TL F) is
too high a transaction cost would be worth reading.

Michel,

The Star Lance missiles are probably illegal under all other Trav rules
systems, are meat for point defense weapons and, being nuclear tipped, are
vulnerable to nuke dampers. 

However, the general idea of using long-duration missiles as
rapid-deployment forces works.

Well, Makhadurin, Sharushiiid and Nasiirka have been around since before
the Ziru Sirkaa got set up.

The non-Vilani megacorps are more recent, but most of them got their start
during the Antebellum \'expansion\' period of the Third Imperium.

Notable is the \'missing megacorp\', Zhunatsu Corp, which was the personal
property of Cleon I, and a driving force behind the actual establishment of
the Imperium. There is no answer in Canon, but the guessing is it was
broken up during the replacement of Cleon the Mad, in exchange for Imperial
shares in all the other big corps.

One of the critical events in the early Imperium was the agreement by the
Vilani to a \'strategic partnership\' with the Syleans, which later turned
into integration of the Vilani cultural region into the 3I.

One thing I believe is that different companies structure themselves
differently. For example, LSP works on a Sector- and Subsector-based model,
while Delgado works by product lines ...

Now, let us assume that a friend of the PCs is having a problem with
Delgado, so they decide to go and have a quiet word with the local Delgado
VP. It\'d be unfortunate if the heavy mob went in against the Delgado
(Armaments) veep, rather than Delgado (Fine Foods and Wine) ...

*choke*

"high standard"  and "Imperium Games"  in the same sentence
without a negation  ?

Sorry, the universe just stood still for a nanosecond.

And while I like the _content_, the production of the GURPS stuff
leaves a lot to be desired.,  though that\'s a standard complaint of
GURPS stuff. For the premium prices they charge (over $20 ) you\'d
expect better.

Compare White Wolf or TSR productions,  full colour, better paper,
seem less likely to fall apart, generally better artwork, generally
cheaper....

I actually prefer the production on the old LBB\'s, better paper, and
the staple design lasts much better than the (is it "perfect-bound"
? ) GURPS style. My LBB\'s are still in good condition after twenty
years. I doubt "Behind the Claw" will  last two careful readings.

when a planet reaches them (eg does a world\'s resource score increase when 
it builds an A class starport?).

a couple of quick suggestions:

>## Life Suppport

suggests a problem with column widths or something.

Weapons with a factor of 2-0-0-0...(LR)

should consider being short ranged (or normal). The beam pointer/MFD is
cheaper and you aren\'t using the extra range anyway.

Alternatively give the laser a bigger mirror - At TL14, a grav focussed
X-ray laser with a 10m mirror ought to be able to sustain its damage
level out to a billion km or so. (This is the usual recomendation of the
Postmark Design Bureau, Laser Communications Division :-)

The turret now weighs more but needs less power (since the PD mode runs
off batteries) and is cheaper. It also needs less space, allowing it to
be fitted into a standard barbette.

Personally, I\'d move the crewstation and MFD out of the turret, go back
to 1 laser, give it a higher power and standard ROF so that it fits into
a standard turret (3std, 42m3) and then have batteries of the things for
greater flexibility.

IIRC the only way to leagally build a J6 ship at TL14 involves
using one of the LBB#2 drive/hull combinations.

\'Need\' is relative. The question the Vice-Admirals in charge of Procurement
Policy Planning will be asking is \'Will a Fleet of 7 main units, supporting
units and 6 Fleet Couriers be more effective than a Fleet of 6 main units,
supporting units and 6 + n Fleet Couriers\', where n is the relative cost of
a main unit and a Fleet Courier. It\'s a lot less painful if your Fleet
Couriers replace frigates, for example.
*************
Well using GT rules, a Jump 6, 6G 100 dt ship costs less than 43MCr while
the Zho Battle Cruiser I did for Aliens I (btw can anyone tell me what
ships made the cut there?) cost just over 14BCr each so you can trade in
one BC for 325 Couriers. I would say 20-40 per fleet.



>And how does this show the cost of the entire network would be "trivial"?


Now, Famile Spofulam has got at LSP\'s board and has convinced them for a
need of a series of Fast, jump-6 couriers connecting Mora, Trin, Glisten,
Rhylanor and Efate. The courier is the TL15 version of the Moonshine class
drug drug runner runner ^k^k^k^k^k^k^k^k^k^k Fast Extraction Vessel,
dropped to 5 gees using T-plates and taken up to jump-6 (FFS2 worksheet
available on application).
LSP(Spinward Marches) has therefore decides to commit 0.5% of annual
revenues to their Internal Communications Improvement project.
The ICI project thus has a projected budget of 20 billion credits. Per
annum. Plus anything they can earn by selling space on the side (one day
delay unless on the Emperor\'s Business, of course).
****************
assuming that these systems are all connected by jump 6.(no books at
work)and that you need 5 \'links\' then you will need 70 ships to have one
each way each day. call it 100 ships for backups, maintanance and special
runs to capitol.

cost: 4.3 BCr to buy the ships, 430MCr each year to keep the system
running.

Additional \'Links\' cost 860MCr each to set up and 86MCr a year to maintain.

Note: these numbers do not take into account any bulk or standard discounts
for the ships.

IMO Megacorps will do this, but they and the Imperium itself will pressure
smaller companies (and PCs) out of business.  Small fast packets tend to
attract \'Pirates\' if not owned by a megacorp :)

From: Andrew Akins <igor@truserve.com>
Subject: Khushdakaa class light freighter
Here\'s the newest (and perhaps final) version of my Kushdakaa class light
freighter. The goal here was to design a ship that with very little
creative trading (read, speculative) this thing can perhaps turn a profit.
It does this by:
  * Being small enough to be operated by one or two individuals -
independent types a-la Han Solo. such independents would no doubt dispense
with formal salaries - relying purely on the profit margin.
  * Class discount of 20%...this hearkens back to the CT days, but I like
it, so I still use it IMTU.
  * Smallest possible drives - drives are by far the most expensive item on
a ship.
  * A small power shortfall - requiring creative power management but
lowering power plant cost.
  * Fuel purification so unrefined can be bought. Scooping allowed for teh
adventurous captain.
Comments and slams are encouraged

Even better under GT.


Some small changes to the advert:  (only changes included)
The small size
also makes the Khushdakaa extremely affordable: with standard 20%
discounts (normal for mass produced designs) the ship costs less
than 14MCr.
Even though it is small and inexpensive, the Khushdakaa performs
admirably. Nearly forty-five percent of its volume is devoted to
cargo space (in the form of four 10.5 ton cargo bays and a single 0.5
ton luggage bay),

The single purification unit can purify the entire fuel supply
in under 2 hours.

Well, sort of.  The armor doesn\'t take up volume, but the manuever drives
required to support the armor do.  For a 170,000 sf ship, +100 DR is 850
tons.
Manuever drives to move this weight at 1 G are 21+ spaces and 3.4 MCr.  One
extra sandcaster is 1 space (plus 1/8 space manuever) and costs .27 MCr
including the extra manuever.  Unless you\'re expecting to defend against
10+
ships at once, the sandcasters are a better bargain.

Sandcasters can also be used in the point defense role vs missiles.

20dtons of cargo space earns KCr 40 revenue per month. This will support a
couple of megacredits in extra sticker cost. Plus you can have express
cargo already in the ship\'s boat, ready for the first trip down.
***************

Hrm
40 - 21 (Boat Bay for a gig) + 6 (Cargo in the Gig) - 3 (thrusters for the
gig and extra cargo) = 22 dtons = 44KCr month if running full.

the gig and thrusters run 5.97 MCr with a payment of 25KCr / month

Looks viable to me.





Smaller ships can and have competed with bigger ones on the same route,
*provided* they are prepared to load, up and go immediatly. None of this
one week stuffing around waiting for a cargo ... when the cargo shows up,
you *go*.
**************
Agreed




Personally, I believe that you should be able to load the LHyd equivalent
of 44 gallon drums of AvGas onto your gig at the downport, and then
transfer them back off the gig and into the tanks. It\'s a bitch of a job,
but it strikes me as doable (the airport at Currie on King Island used 44
gallon drums of avgas to refuel the light planes that landed on the
island).
************
But do they do that for the tramp freighters that dock at the port?  or a
better example, does the freighter send a launch in to pick up the drums
and take them out to refuel the freighter?



Now, according to p119 of G:T it takes 18 minutes to escape Earth\'s
gravitational field at 2 gees, so I\'d say that a one hour round trip is
reasonable.
***********
and an unstreamlined free trader with a gig will take 19 hours to do a full
load (it can unload at the same time though). it will either take a full
day or it wil  need 3 pilots for the shuttle.....hrm have to take another

I am perfectly happy with the level of streamlining on a modern surface
ship (ie it\'s a cow ... dont expect to play with grav fighters in the
atmosphere) being available, just as long as it costs less than 20% of the
volume of the ship.
Make \'partial streamlining\' cost 10% of ship volume, maximum 10 dtons, and
I\'ll come to the party. Stubby wings, minimal lift, blobs of plastic over
the sensor arrays ...
************
the unstreamlined ships have this already. what they don\'t have is landing
gear and they can not do a balistic reentry. so where another ship would
have a half hor or so trip it would have several hours and would have to
worry much more about atmospheric conditions.  When it reached the surface,
it would have to find some water to land in (most ships can float).

well actualy it does... engineering crew for the extra mauver drive.... it

Subject:  GT Docking costs

The standard docking fees are set at 100 Cr/dton per week.

how about adding some short term fees

say 25 Cr/dton per day

or 5 Cr/dton per hour

so a free trader pays:
20KCr/week
5KCr/Day
1KCr/hour

While a 20 ton Gig (like from Ian\'s unstreamlined trader) would pay a tenth
of that, but would need to rent warehouse space as well.

any thoughts on the cost of warehouse space?

This kind of ship is also whre the GT ships come out cheaper compared to
others. the undiscounted price is less than 25% of the HG _Discounted_
price.  For small civilian designs the systems match well

with the extra savings you could buy Total Compartmentalisation, Radical
Stealth and Radical EM the accel stays the same and the price is bumped up
to _only_ 264MCr.

The crew is a close match,  three of the six engineers are for the small

Orbital Sensor Platform for planets without a highport, This unit pfrovides
good scan coverage of the space around a planet.  It is capable of

to skill)


Manned Orbital Sensor Platform (TL 10)

Crew: Commander(Leadership), 6 Sensor Techs (Electronics

Note: while the sensors can detect a ship out to 1,000 hexes, its not
*likely*. no mods to detect on a free trader gives a range of 30 hexes. A
more stringent application (no mods vs standard scout) gives an effective
range of 3 hexes (15 hexes with a handoff or prior detection) and a max
possible range of 100 hexes (450 hexes with a handoff).

A Rampart Fighter would be -2 to detect in the same hex (+2 with a handoff
or prior detection), with a max possible range of 7 hexes (30 hexes. with a
handoff)


If you want to relate this to the piracy debate, a 400 dton TL 10 ship with
Basic stealth and EM:
no mods at 4 hexes, with a max detection possible at 150 hexes.

the jump limit for a standard planet is 80 hexes, at this range the
hypotheical pirate is -8 to detect.

if we assume an operator skill of 12 that is a 4 or less to detect. or
1.85% per turn this give a 49% chance of detection after 36 hours. not real
good for the pirate, but not impossible odds either.

a ship of the same size with military stealth would be impossible to detect
at this range. (unless you switch to higer TL sensors)

On of these, a pair of launches to service it and 16 light fighters cost
less than 100MCr.  If a world has any resonable population (say 10,000,000
cits with taxes of 1Cr year to maintain this) it should have at least this
much in the way of defenses.

more of a reality check, the docking fees in GT are based on real world
fees at air/sea ports.  The life support in GT is total life support
(provides food as well) and doesn\'t have any associated fees (other than
anual maintainence).




  As to wharehouse storage costs.  A friend of mine manages a U-store type
of place that charges something like $60 per month per 10x10 storage area.
This would equate to about 750 cubic feet of storage area.  So, in GURPS
TRAVELLER terminology, we\'d be looking at 1.5 Displacement tons at $60 per
month.  In traveller terms, using roughly $2 to the Imperial credit, we are
looking at roughly 20 credits per month.

Well, not ALL of Gene went into orbit. They only took a few ounces of his
cremains (ashes)... the rest had to be properly dealt with. Which, in most
states either means in an urn or in the ground.

The company has a very limited weight allowance. There are plans for doing
the same from the shuttle... the capsules of cremains are the size of a
lipstic tube, and the ashes are not scattered free, but encapsulated.

It is estimated that the capsules will orbit for 5 to 15 years, IIRC

There are differing viewpoints, but traveller seems to produce a much
higher number of habitable worlds than even the "more liberal" (higher
possibilities) applications of the Drake Equation would indicate.

As for multiple star systems, the Centauri system might be able to have
planets in the hab zone... but probably not. Proxima (the third) is a far
companion... far enough to get a separate entry in the catalogues, and have
an orbit time long enough that catalog entries are good for more than
several lifetimes. Proxima will be a bright star.

Alpha and Beta are much closer... but I don\'t recall HOW close. Combine the
gravitational sweeping of beta, the radiance flux on orbit, tidal stresses,
and the nature of system formation (IE, did they form at their distance, or
did beta fall in towards alpha), and you start to be able to figure whether
liquid water exists. Liquid water is a requisite for LIFE AS WE KNOW IT...
there may be other  forms, but who can tell till we encounter them?

No, they are not. The name comes from a mistranslation occuring during 1st

They are bipedal xenohominids, with males having 6 genetailia, and several
being over a meter long. [several episodes of B5]

IMTU, it is literally a Bond posted by the employer with a major bank. With
limitation of term and forfeiture clauses. The way it works is that the
bond certificate is actually a multi-part document carried by the soldier.
One part is the conditions upon hostiles: If, after surrender or capture,
the capturer fails to have treated humanely, and with appropriate measures,
those persons on repatriation bonds, including unneeded delays in shipping
them offworld, the issuing (usually megacorporate) bank does three things:
sieze all assets of the offending gov\'t they hold; request IMOJ Review;
Warn all mercs seeking bonds for that world. The bond specifies what
theater/war, duration of service, and repatriation location of preference.
The bond authorizes 2 mid passages, to be paid with the attached coupons,
upon safe repatriation. It authorizes 5 "Assistance tokens", also payable
upon safe repatriation. No "assistance token" hoarding is allowed... each
person\'s tokens may only be validated by signature of the certificate
holder, they are manufactured in the same manner as currency, and they are
all reviewed upon safe repatriation. They all show name, rank, serial
number, unit, issuing agency, date of issue, etc. A capturing gov\'t is able
to recover an assistance token for quick turn-over of a capture or
surrenderer to the issuing bank... and, if passage meets it, a passage
token....

IMTU, it is also possible for someone to sneak to a port, and directly deal
wityh skippers, for an assistance token and a passage token.

The KCr10 bond covers 2 mids, 5 assists, and each pays at KCr8 for a mid,
and KCr 1 for an assist. The banks Mercenary Bonding and Repatriation Loans
Board will review anyone taking both jumps, and issuing more than 2
assists... and spread the word (And refusse to pay off) if fraud is found.
IMTU, most bonds are good for "Not more than 1 year past cessation of
hostilities in the ___ matter."

Also, IMTU,. interstellar Mercs need a liscence to form a Merc Unit....
MCr1, 20 year issue, with KCr50 renewal for 10 years thereafter. The
liscence allows them to purchase military equipment, transport said
equipment, etc, on the up and up. It also makes them subject to
"Imperialization" during war or civil disruption. It also allows them to
get Imperial SUrplus. It doesn\'t prevent non-liscenced operators, but such
mercs also have no protection under imperial custom... they are officially
"Partisan Troops", subject to being treated under local laws for "Crimes"
in the line of duty, while liscenced ones may only be tried for war crimes
by the IMOJ, in Imperial Courts... word of not doing this can bring the
dreaded Imperial Intervention, not to mention IN Interdict, TAS Amber or
Red Zoning, and bad press.

Well in Fifth Frontier War I\'ve got counters for quite a few mercenary

Anyway, I was just pointing out that there are some differences between a

So, here is the question: suppose I have 1 medium laser, plus 2 point
defense lasers.  Target is at a range of 1 (max range for a point defense
laser by the way).  So, with a +9 RoF bonus to hit with those three lasers
combined... which one hits when you fire at a target?  The two point
defense lasers have a RoF of 2 x 20/60, which = 2/3.  The third laser has a
RoF of 4/60.  The combined total RoF is 44/60 = .73.  Problem is, the
combined RoF bonus for the Point Defense lasers alone is also +9.

A few people have wondered where partial streamlining is.
Answer: it\'s the default condition.
Take a look at old Traveller -- e.g., High Guard. What shape *isn\'t*
partial streamlined?
Dispersed structures, rocks, basically.
Both are special cases of the rules best built with options from
vehicles or the vehicles designer notes (open frame, modular, etc.)
The default is partial streamlining... the key is about DR 100 armored
hull...

I find it very hard to believe that any world that engages in interstellar
trade couldnt afford the equivalent of a couple of aluminium dingies to
take cargo from ship to shore.

nah the aluminum dingies are enclosed air rafts :)

Great. So 300 blokes with shovels can build us a minimum starport, or you
park just outside a seaport.
Seaports are better, becuase they should already have warehouses, ferries,
tugs, rail links and so on.
****************
yep, sounds like a class D starport to me, unrefined fuel available.






Well, if the boat is based on the ground, the ship gets to carry 18 dtons
more cargo, which means there is more potential profit on the route.
A lot of trust is needed, as the freighter captain is relying on the
groundpounders for her resupply of fuel.
***************
true, but I wouldn\'t count on that unless the port was C or better.




But seriously, G:T needs partial streamlining. I dont have Gurps:Vehicles,
but the p155 sidebar in G:T states \'Streamlined hulls used the lifting body
and "very good" streamlining features\'. What happens if we dump the lifting
body, and take the streamlining features down to "poor" or "average" ?

Additionally, according to the Gamlords supplement  "The Mountain
Environment" there is a mountain on Efate called  Mt Surimsi.  It
is uninhabited and can be climbed:

"... located in the hinterlands of Efate.  Air  pressure  at  sea
level is .65atm (a taint makes filter masks necessary  as  well).
Mt Surimsi\'s base  is  1.5km  above  sea  level,  where  the  air
pressure is .60atm.  A low mountain, only  6.5km  tall,  the  air
pressure  at  the  summit  is  .13atm,  a  Very  Thin  atmosphere
requiring artificial assistance.  In summer, Mt Surimsi enjoys  a
temperature of 30 degrees C  at  its  base;  at  the  summit  the
temperature is nearly 33 degrees cooler - a chilly -3 degrees  C.
The  \'timber line\'  is  7.4km  above  sea  level  (5.9km  up  the
mountainside); in summer, the \'snow line\' is at the same point."

Is this canon?  Who knows, but  it  adds  a  little  extra  local
colour.

Subject: GT: Space Combat Questions
I recently finished GM\'ing my first GT space battle, and I\'m sure I did
some
things incorrectly.  It was a battle between a 400 dton corsair and a
couple
of standard 100 dton scouts - so we just had the turret weapons (TL10
lasers
and missiles).  So here are my questions:
1 - The \'Gunner Skill Modifiers\' section on pg 173 doesn\'t say so, but I
assumed it applied only to _beam_ weapons.  Is this true?
*************
Applies to Sandcasters in PD mode as well, Missiles use Pilot(Missile).


2 - That same section says to count the firing hex when finding the range
modifier, so is this always at least 1?
*******************
no, always at least -39.


3 - At the 1/2D range for a 360MJ laser (2 hexes), the \'to-hit\' modifiers
are:
      -44 range (3 hexes, because you count the firing hex also)
      +8 size (firing at a 100 dton scout)
      +4 ROF bonus (standard)
      +2 Active sensor lock
      +7 Targetting bonus (basic bridge = complexity 7 computer, but 4
turrets means run at complexity 6)
which yields (before gunner skill + acc bonus) a total of -23 [ mmm... 23
8-) ]
This means my gunner needs a skill level of 17 to hit on an 11 or less (17
(skill) + 17 (acc) - 23 = 9).  Is this correct?
The skill levels need to be kind-of-high for my taste - the Naval Enlisted
template only gives their gunners a skill of 16.
************
- -43 (range, the firing hex counts as range 0), +8 size, +4 rof, +2 sensor
lock, +8 (you get 3 computers with a bridge) = -21
skill 14 need 7 or less to hit (remember to roll for each laser seperatly)
skill 15 need 9 or less to hit (remember to roll for each laser seperatly)
skill 16 need 11 or less to hit (remember to roll for each laser seperatly)


4 - Point defense against incoming missiles.
      -39 range (0 hex, because the point defense section says so)
      +0 size (firing at a missile)
      +4 ROF (standard)
      +2 Active sensor lock
      +7 Targetting bonus
      + 10 point defense bonus
yielding -16 before skill+acc or (same guy with 17 skill) a total to hit
roll of 18 or less.  Is this correct?
************8
- -15 before skill + acc.
so skill 14 will need 13 or less to hit.


Missile Questions - This is where I was very unsure about how the combat is
supposed to be run.
5 - Hitting a ship with missiles.  Why are the missiles guided by the
gunner?  GT tries hard to give that Traveller feel, but I don\'t remember
guided missiles in other versions, more like homing missiles (ie, get a
lock
and fire, if the missile can catch the target and the target can\'t break
the
lock, _boom_).  Is this just to give Gunner characters more to do?
****************
because in order to be homing you would need massive sensor heads on the
missiles, besides it gives missile gunners somthing to do.


6 - Do missile gunners have a range penalty?
************
no


Wouldn\'t time lag be a factor at 9 hexes or so (1 light-second round-trip
for that laser communicator)?
*************
it should be but it is ignored.


7 - Are the 3 seconds of thrust continuous?  If the missile is guided, I
would think the operator could thrust at will.
***************
that is 60 minutes of thrust, and it doesnt have to all be used at once,
you could launch then coast to the target and then make an attack run.

8 - Can the missile hit if it has no thrust left?  How does the gunner get
it to physically hit the target with no thrust left?
******************
no, not it the target can evade at all.

Finally, my 3 Oct GT errata does not mention the fact that the 400 dton
System Defense Boat (pg 144), and the 400 dton Laboratory Ship (pg 145) have
a size modifier of +9, but the 400 dton Subsidized Merchant (pg146) has a
size modifier of +8 (I am assuming it should also be +9).

correct.

Depends on what kind of nebula you\'re talking about.  _The Guide to the
Galaxy_ gives the average size of a molecular cloud* as about 120 ly (36.8
pc), but points out that there\'s a wide variation.  They can be smaller or
a *lot* bigger.  Other kinds of nebulae have different typical sizes.

I\'m not sure that there are any molecular clouds within the equivalent of
Charted Space in the "real universe."  No reason you can\'t have one wherever
is convenient IYTU, of course.

*A relatively dense, dark, cool cloud of dust and gas, containing an unusually
high concentration of complex molecules.  Typical "incubator" for new stars.
A canonical example is the Coal Sack.  Remember that the usual portrayal
of a "nebula" in SF is way wrong -- they\'re nowhere near as thick as you see
on Star Trek :-).  The center of even a dense molecular cloud is still the
next
best thing to a hard vacuum.

It should be pointed out that the early Dutch traders, Marco Polo, and
the other long range merchants of the era weren\'t depending on data
that we would call timely. Their usual procedure would be to take a
ship full of valuables, sail off to where luxury goods were available a 
year or so ago, find the current best trading center in the far east, and
come back some years after they left loaded down with silks, spices, and 
other goods. Their investors may have asked them to get certain high
value goods, but these couldn\'t be more than guidelines - if the saffron
crop in Banglore had failed that year, you wouldn\'t expect the captain
to hang around waiting for instructions. A Merchant Prince of that era 
wasn\'t sitting in a counting house in Brussels, he was on the caravel
headed for Malay - because there was literally no way for him to excercise
control over the trade expedition without being there.

Kind of like the speculative trading operations of TU Free Traders.

To me it is canon unless contradicted by another canonical source. And if

One of the posts from Tuesday, 12/01 (yesterday) caught my eyes, and 
brought up a great question about other star-faring races before or 
during the time of the Ancients.  I have to admit that it\'s kinda 
boring to me to have artifacts from "long lost civilizations" all 
belong to either a hyper-psionic mutant Droyne or one of his 400 
eugenically enhanced offspring circa -300,000.

Traveller sources have hinted at other races during or before that 
time period.

In IG\'s Alien Archives, one of the races (I\'m at work and can\'t 
remember the name:  I think it\'s the Providers, but I\'m not sure) 
were transplanted to their current homeworld in -500,000.  Their 
original world was about to be destroyed by natural phenomenon, so 
they sent sample of their lifeforms to other world using STL 
transport.

In GT: Behind the Claw, one of the minor races (again, memory lapse, 
but the name started with a T) was discovered to have been 
transplanted to their current homeworld from somewhere else in 
- -600,000.  Who did it?

Does anyone else have any references to other star-farers or elder 
races from canonical Traveller sources?

Did other elder races exist?  Did they have jumpdrives, or were they 
stuck to sublight speeds?  Did they cover one world/system, or did 
they have an extended stellar society?

What are your thoughts?

In Service,

That\'s because GT dosen\'t have any life support costs at all (AFAICS there\'s
not even any food costs, which IMO is going too far in the other direction
(more likely, I\'ve missed a reference to them. David? Can you clear that up?)
Anyway, the docking costs were worked out to give a Free Trader roughly the
same expenses per jump in GT as in other Traveller versions.

As others have pointed out, the change does make a difference even so. I
approve of the change, however, and really, really hope that Marc will
adopt it for T5  --  provided food costs and the occasional flushing of
air, water and sewage systems are included.

Part of it would be geography. If a megacorp is developing in Core,
it won\'t have the resources to prevent a megacorp from developing

each is too big for the other to readily devour. (The one developing in
Core may happily devour it\'s closer-placed competitors, though).

Another part would be specialization. An Imperium-wide banking
megacorp may not have any interest in owning shipbuilding concerns,
it would rather be a step back a finance them. Thus you have both
Hortalez et Cie and GSbAG (for example).

Then there is the political angle. A megacorp probably cannot prosper
without the existance of the Imperium, and the permission of the
Emperor. It seems to me the Emperor has no interest in all commercial
power in his empire becoming concentrated in one corporate entity.

I don\'t understand what you mean. Do you think the claim that all message

reasonable or that it is highly suspect?

Translating that into time that is the equivalent of the distance between
England and France in the 18th Century. IMTU crucial trade information
often originates at distances that is equivalent to that between England and
India and sometimes between England and China.

Several of you assume that I\'m talking about daily couriers. Nowhere have I
said anything like that. I\'m talking about something to compete with the
X-boat network, which IIRC uses weekly links. Comparing a daily service
with a weekly one is manifestly unfair. Try comparing the canonical distance
(in time) between Capital and Mora (about 1.5 years IIRC) with the 25-30
weeks that a rational jump-6 link can demonstrably provide and you will
see that a courier network does not need daily service to outperform the
X-boats. Heck, it could be monthly and it would still beat the pants off it.

For the record, I think a weekly service is the most reasonable.

That wasn\'t the point I was trying to make. What I meant was that some
cargoes are valuable enough that making a huge investment for the purpose
of getting there first with the cargo is worthwhile. In the example it
was clipper ships. A good, speedy information network is another example.

Up to a week if the courier service is weekly. Since the saving between 
Capital and Mora is about 50 weeks, that one week is hardly a backbreaker.

I\'d say a weekly service would be frequent enough to compete. Heck, between

Ah, but that\'s just my point. If you have to break canon anyway, why not go
the whole hog and change it for something plausible? I\'ll freely admit that
there are any number of different setups that would all be reasonable. Some
more so than other, but all of them IMO acceptable. 13 barebones networks
run by each Megacorporation, would be one. A collective "Merc-net" subscribed
to by all licenced interstellar corporations is another. A \'mongrel\' X-boat
network that was _mostly_ jump-4, but supplemented by the occasional jump-5
and jump-6 link is another. I\'m not saying that any particular version is
the One True Way. All I am really saying is that _all_ messages going by
X-boats is a bit much.

And as I have specifically stated several times I do assume that such a
system exists: The Imperial Navy. I have also said that it seems unlikely
to the point of breaking my willing suspension of disbelief that the
Admiralty would not want tight control over their fleets. If you
disagree about that, then we disagree about axioms, not logic and any
discussion where axioms are disputed is futile.

>That means frequent jump-6 service on all the places where you are saying
>it will replace jump-4 service.

I\'m not claiming that it will replace the jump-4 service. I do find it odd
that the X-boats have not been upgraded, but not "This just can\'t be true"
odd, merely "That\'s odd" odd.

To get a message from Capital to Mora requires about 1/3rd as many ships as
the X-boat network uses. I won\'t go into specifics unless we can agree on
which ship construction rules we use as a basis, because of the huge
differences in the costs for the different systems, but I\'d say that it is
highly debatable whether a jump-6 network would actually be more expensive
than the X-boats.

I have discovered that due to real life, I just do not have the time to
check everybody\'s ships and post them to the list, as I would need do
with "Ship of the Week".  It is for this reason I thought of the
Imperial Ship Architects Guild (ISAG).  

The idea is that on a given month we select a type of ship to build,
during that month people will post their designs to the GURPS and TML
lists.  Each person will be responsible for making sure their own
designs check out, as the others within the ISAG and those who will vote
on the best design will prolly check them as they vote on them. At the
end of the submission period will be a vote on the best design based on
mission specs, economics, most unusual design, most innovative, etc... 
The ship with the most points will be posted to the lists as the "ISAG
Ship of the Month" and receive a bag of iridium plated kudos. <G>

My job will be to correlate the emails for ship designs and voting
ballots.  Alas I do not have the ability to create a mailing list from
my ISP as the old ISBA had.  But if anyone joining ISAG would like to
give it a shot into producing one, go for it.

Ok then, the only thing we need to do is think of what type of ship to
build for Jan \'99.  I wont do anything for this month but get ISAG
members contact information and such.  Possibly put together a website
too.

The rest of your "short term" docking costs look reasonable to me though.

There is an article in AJ 1997 vol 113 number 4 p.1445-1450 by Wiegert & Holman
that is a numerical simulation of orbits in the Alpha Centauri system. 

The conclusion is that a single planet on a circular orbit is unstable over much
of the region around central Alpha Centauri binary. However, there are zones in
which such a planet could be stablw over million year time scales. These zones
are located both far from the binary (a>= 70AU) or near the binary or secondary
(a<=3AU). The semimajor axis between the two are 23AU. So there could most
defenitly be planets around the system.

So to carry it forward, what happens to the Megacorps when the Imperium
implodes?  

I\'d assume that the local (and that can be very very broad) officers
would continue operations, system, sub-sector, sector, even
multi-subsector if they could.  I envision a Subsector level
Director/VP/Pres anticipating being the BIG GUY, right up until the J-6
courier shows up from Sector HQ letting him know what the official
MegaCorp policy now is in the newly downsized Sector MegaCorp....and
then never hearing from them again when the Sector HQ gets trashed....

Ahhhh the possibilities.  Lots of room for Nobles to make themselves
felt again.  Political intrigue....  I love it.

        Hi, Ian!
        Actually, I had noticed that HE missles have better odds of hitting
than do NE.  If you *do* use the SS3 rules, then you are better off putting
a monster engine on it and generating the extra damage by direct impact. Of
course, since the idea I understood about the MOS that was posted was to
keep track of potential piracy situations, any pirate with a nuke damper is
big enough to be a Naval problem.  And the system he/she/it is currently
visiting has other things to panic about. =)
        Also, I would guess that GURPS allows for, or can be *bent* to allow
for to custom-made one-shot-ship-wreckers.  I don\'t know for sure, as I
don\'t play the system.

        In otherwords, GM Fiat said "I need Megacorps, so I\'ll have them

to create one..."

        So why didn\'t the existing "Big Three" companies simply buy them out
or stomp them out?  It is not in a corporation\'s best interest to have
competiton.

        Hi, Walt!

        Thanks very much.  I had never considered it that way, but it make
sense.  I just presumed the CPU vs CPU duel was a reflection of the bigger
system\'s ability to run more DM-generating programs than the smaller one
(Predict, Gunner Interact, etc).  Thanks!

Spoiler  and IMTU Warning.




I found it HIGHLY unlikely that no other race would have spread throughout
the galaxy long before humans/major rcaes/ancients given how easy it is to
refuel etc and the timespans we deal with. I also found it very unlikely
that no oher intelligent races would have developed in other eras at other
places in the galaxy given how many races (minor and major) there are in
Traveller known space (a minuscule portion of the galaxy).

To solve this and somewhat stay in canon I decided that hyperspace itself
was an artifact of some vastly intelligent race and that it worked only
around known space and in a corridor towards the galactic core (the Zhos
core expeditions are in canon). This also deals with the fact that there
are no easy explanations to how hyperspace works etc in canon sources and
this could IMHO only be possible if it was not a naturally ocurring
phenomena (physicists would get into deep trouble if they couldn\'t rely on
the cosmological principle - everything near us is more or less the same as
everywhere else).

Finally the weird mutation that created this supersmart Droyne I found
extremely implausible if it was natural. I decided that the preancients
created Yaskoydroy as part of a plot between two factions among them. When
Yaskoydroy finally found out about what he was and what hyperspace was he
got REALLY frightened; hid killed all children, destroyed all works, gave
j-drives to all major races and hid in a pocket universe. I guess those
preancients were/are pretty fearful huh.

That\'s because GT dosen\'t have any life support costs at all (AFAICS
there\'s
not even any food costs, which IMO is going too far in the other direction
(more likely, I\'ve missed a reference to them. David? Can you clear that
up?)
Anyway, the docking costs were worked out to give a Free Trader roughly the
same expenses per jump in GT as in other Traveller versions.
****************
The life support systems used in GT are Total life support.  They include
food. the upkeep for them is taken care on during the anual maintanance.
this mean that if you skip anual maintinace, that not only do you have a
higher chance of misjup, but you also might lose life support.  IYTU you
can declare the food to be unappitizing paste, and charge for food,
Some resonable numbers:
100/week for crew/mid passage
200-400/week for high passage

IMTU, there is an elder race that is still around. They remember the
ancients. It\'s no big deal - this race (the Meshran) don\'t have Jump Drive
and are very content to sit in their six systems and just _be_.

One of these days I\'ll be posting more information about the races in my
camapaign (The Meshran, Krahz/Chk, Syumbroy, Tieyl, Taneian, Bulwrath,
Gil\'ggoruk). As soon as I get some free time (like that\'s going to happen).

I\'d say a weekly service would be frequent enough to compete. Heck, between
Capital and Mora a QUARTERLY service would be frequent enough!
************
quarterly I wouldnt call a network at all, just one ship IIRC could do
this, taking the Rift route.

And as I have specifically stated several times I do assume that such a
system exists: The Imperial Navy. I have also said that it seems unlikely
to the point of breaking my willing suspension of disbelief that the
Admiralty would not want tight control over their fleets. If you
disagree about that, then we disagree about axioms, not logic and any
discussion where axioms are disputed is futile.
*************
IMO the imperial navy will have at least one jump6 courier per capital
ship. as well as scheduled runs between navy bases.

There\'s a chart somewhere in FFS2 that says how many targets one LIDAR
can engage. For medium-small ships you can indeed run allt he weapons off
one LIDAR; the main reason for having more is redundancy - if the LIDAR 
gets hit, your ship loses much of its combat effectiveness.

>[sensor rules] But how about a simple set of tasks and modifier
>tables to add to a role-playing situation.

My draft Military Combat System has a simplified set of sensor rules for
combat situations. The "quick" version looks something like this:

- ----
When a ship wishes to fire, 
compare Signal = (Firing ship sensor rating) + (Target Signature) to the 
following table to determine if a sensor lock occurs:

Range        passive/LIDAR        active signal         
            needed for lock        needed for lock
Impact          10.0                     9.5                       
Point-Blank     11.5                    11.0                    
Very Short      12.0                    11.5                          
Short           12.5                    12.0                      
Medium          13.0                    12.5                   
Long            13.5                    13.0                     
Extreme         14.0                    13.5                  

If the sensor operator makes a succesful Formidable (3d) roll against
his (sensor skill + int), increase the sensitivity of all the ship\'s
sensors by 0.5 for the duration of the turn. If the ship only has one
operational sensor decrease the sensitivity by 0.5 (since it must use
the sensor both for tracking and scanning.) Targets that are hiding
not firing weapons have their signature reduced by 0.5. 
- ----

The ranges are ranges in my military combat system - in T4 terms, 
"Short", "Medium", "Long" and "Extreme" are the four T4 range bands.
(I can forward you the whole MCS if you\'re interested - Akins spreadsheets
in later version do the conversion automatically.) 

As you can see, a big LIDAR can get fire control locks out to quite long
ranges; and a PEMS-13.5 will do fairly well for fire out to medium range.
A 13.5 or 14 is about the right passive sensor for a small warship, depending
on how much money you want to spend and what the mission is.

I would say that troops carried like that are troops that can\'t function
effectively on the ship - ground-only troops, that would (for example)
lack the coordination and training to deploy to defend the ship against
borders, or even for non-routine boarding of other vessels. (Think of the
command positions as being for a Marine officer, and the workstation being
a position for someone who coordinates operations between the ship and the
troops.)

>3.  Beef up the sensor suite. [To a PEMS-14]

This is a tough call, because it\'s expensive; depends what the mission of
the ship is. If it always deploys with a fleet, or in high-population systems
with native traffic control, it might get by with the 13.5 - it can still
see out to the 100-diameter limit pretty easily.

Or - if you must have a big search sensor - buy the PEMS-14 as a 
scanner-only (not useable for firecontrol, just for finding targets) and
buy a couple more (cheap) LIDARs, and maybe a tracker-only (fire-control)
PEMS-13.5

	True, but still enough to spoil accurate astronomical observations, 
which still give them a certain value as plot devices. If I am not 
mistaken, you can easily postulate a sector-wide dust cloud such that 
observations through it are generally spoiled. You can see where 
brilliant stars behind are, but not real details.

	In the GDW adventure Knightfall, the PCs get to explore a lost 
shimmering city of....

	.... THE PRIMORDIALS ... (fanfare)

	which, IIRC, is portal-linked to several systems across the Galaxy. 
In the Referee-side notes, it is clearly specified that they had 
nothing to do with the Ancients. Their technology was, what? TL 
20-something? Gadgets included relativity pistols and the like.
	I think that it was said that they preceded the Ancients.

	Even though I am not very worried with canon, I would say that 
Knightfall (with his Massilia sector UWPs) *is* canon.

IMTU, there is archeological evidence of a starfaring race that covered 
the known area of the galaxy at least 1 million years ago.  Little is 
known (wink) about them, except that they exhibited high tech, possibly 
F or G, but appear to have used sublight ships.  The prevelant 
hypothesis for this, which has some archeological support, is that they 
were very long lived, possibly measuring lifespans in centuries.  The 
popular term for them is the Predecessors.  Researchers call them PR-1 
(Prior Race 1).  There is a theory that they seeded various races about 
the galaxy, but no hard evidence exists for this.

Reply-To: traveller@MPGN.COM

Friends,

One of the posts from Tuesday, 12/01 (yesterday) caught my eyes, and 
brought up a great question about other star-faring races before or 
during the time of the Ancients.  I have to admit that it\'s kinda 
boring to me to have artifacts from "long lost civilizations" all 
belong to either a hyper-psionic mutant Droyne or one of his 400 
eugenically enhanced offspring circa -300,000.

Traveller sources have hinted at other races during or before that 
time period.

In IG\'s Alien Archives, one of the races (I\'m at work and can\'t 
remember the name:  I think it\'s the Providers, but I\'m not sure) 
were transplanted to their current homeworld in -500,000.  Their 
original world was about to be destroyed by natural phenomenon, so 
they sent sample of their lifeforms to other world using STL 
transport.

In GT: Behind the Claw, one of the minor races (again, memory lapse, 
but the name started with a T) was discovered to have been 
transplanted to their current homeworld from somewhere else in 
- -600,000.  Who did it?

Does anyone else have any references to other star-farers or elder 
races from canonical Traveller sources?

Did other elder races exist?  Did they have jumpdrives, or were they 
stuck to sublight speeds?  Did they cover one world/system, or did 
they have an extended stellar society?

What are your thoughts?

In Service,
Jason

The problem is that planets are thought to be less likely to form in a
multiple star system. The forming stars would tend to eat more of the
initial gas cloud.

Also, you have the problems of orbit stability. Close in to any given
star in a multiple star system, you can have an orbit that\'s
essentially unaffected by the other stars in the system. Orbits are
going to be either unstable, or at least subject to *wild* climate
variations from this point until you are far enough out that the two
(or more) stars can be treated as a single gravity source.

So unless the habitable zone is in the inner or outer "stable orbit"
zones, then planets in the habitable zone aren\'t possible.

Even if a stable orbit *was* possible, you get temperature variations
due to the changing distances to the two or more stars. And these tend
to be large enough that life is unlikely.

> Does anyone know if there is a "rule of thumb" scientists use when 
> looking for stars that might support habitable planets?

Main "rule" is that the star have a lifespan long enough for life to
evolve. That means that type O, B, and A stars are out. Then you
eliminate stars that aren\'t on the main sequence. That\'s because such
stars are either still forming their planetary system (if any) or they
are very old, and won\'t stay in their current condition for more than a
million years or so.

For example, stars tend to become red giants when they near the end of
their lifespan. In the process, they expand a *lot* and engulf inner
planets, and if they haven\'t engulfed any habitable planets, those
planets are now way too hot for life. Planets that were farther out and
are now at reasonable temperatures won\'t have time to develop life, as
red giants last less than a million years. Then they either collapse
"peacefully" into a white dwarf, or go supernova. The ones that go
supernova leave behind pulsars or black holes.

> Is the CT/MT universe more generous in handing out habitable life 
> systems than current scientific theory dictates?

Well, one thing to consider is that there\'s a big difference between a
planet that can be lived on, and one that has native life forms. Even
so, Traveller does seem to be a bit on the generous side.

They are most definitely *not* humans. In one of the first episodes it
was mentioned that they\'d conned Earth into thinking that they were
human and that Earth was a lost colony. That didn\'t last too long.

In another episode, we find out that the Centauri male sex organs are a
sort of tentacle multiple feet long. And very prehensile (Londo is
caught using one of his to cheat at cards :-) They have 6 or 8 of them.

Do recall that "Centauri" in the name of a star means that it is in the
constellation Centaurus. And there are a *lot* of stars in that
constellation. Some of which are hundreds of light years away.

"Alpha" <constellation name> signifies the brightest star in the
constellation (as seen from Earth). Alpha Centauri is bright because
it\'s close. On the other hand, Beta Centauri is a B giant hundreds or
thousands of light years away...

There\'s no indication *which* star in the constellation the Centauri
are from. But it\'s very unlikely to be Alpha Centauri, because they\'d
have visted us long ago (and likely conquered us, the way they did the
Narns).

Good question.  IMHO, even retaliatory use should cause a loss of
prestige.  But the problem is, the PE with less prestige who retaliates
in kind, will lose all of its prestige before the attacking PE.  I think
the first use of such weapons should generate a greater prestige
loss than retaliatoty strikes.  But after the first exchange, I\'d treat
them equally.  (BTW, I can\'t find the secton in PE that discusses this,
could you point it out to me?  Haven\'t cracked PE open in a while).

Initial only, on my opinion.  Since trade will be calculated separately.

Very strong expression of interest here.  Although I rarely get to use it,
PE is probably my favorite T4 product.

Have you looked at the work Jo Grant did use Galactic to assist with
PE?  I think I have a copy somewhere if you\'re interested.

Been there, edited that ;-)

BITS released 101 Religions not so very long ago. This is mainly
humanocentric but does have an Aslan religion (and possibly a Vargr and a
Droyne one IIRC). It was carefully edited to try and make material playable
and non-inflammatory.

I can\'t add much more - as I was involved in it - but a large number of TML
and TWG readers contributed, co-ordinated by Tim Collinson.

Unfortunately, I suspect someone will be offended. :-(

BITS maintains an archive of old Traveller material - contact Andy Lilly at
bits@bits.org.uk and he may be able to help find some old stuff (for ex I
have recently acquired near mint Tarsus, Beltstrike and The Flaming Eye).
Tarsus and Beltstrike were 10 each - $15 - and Flaming Eye cost me 17GBP.

Sad to hear about this fraud.

enough to share and I am trying to keep them close to the OU).

I\'ve also toyed with the fact the maybe Grandfather himself is the product

single, "spontanious" mutation of the scope that Grandfather represents.

You know I wonder that no-one said this before. I\'ve been toying with the
idea that Grandfather lied! I mean we have his word that he wiped out his
children after getting pissed that they were ignoreing him, then build his
pocket universe so that he could have a little privacy to do his research.

What if he lied?

- - What if the children were wiped out by "Someone or thing else" and
Grandfather build his hole and pulled it in after him to hide? Might explain
his quickness to destroy the ship that carried the humans into his PU.

- - Likewise, what if some of the kids did escape, and are licking their
wounds somewhere, waiting to find Granddaddy\'shiding spot?

- - Or are waiting for their "weapons", the Big Six, to mature enough to go
after him.

- - Or maybe, the Big Six are Granddaddy\'s defenses?

- - Or his weapons against "Someone or thing else"?

Hummm, who said that the Ancients lost their kick when their secret was
revealed way back?

Friends,

One of the posts from Tuesday, 12/01 (yesterday) caught my eyes, and
brought up a great question about other star-faring races before or
during the time of the Ancients.  I have to admit that it\'s kinda
boring to me to have artifacts from "long lost civilizations" all
belong to either a hyper-psionic mutant Droyne or one of his 400
eugenically enhanced offspring circa -300,000.

Many years ago, on first reading MT, I found it intuitively obvious that J-6
ships in general would enjoy a huge benefit for many applications.  However, I
got the impression that the Imperium was VIGOROUSLY engaged in suppressing the
use of this technology.  The Emperor (or the Secret Masters) want J-6 to be
their private advantage, and since they own the boards of most Megacorps, they
pretty much get what they want.  IMTU, at least.

"What\'s that?  You want a custom-built J-6 yacht?  I\'m sorry, Mr. Zillionaire.
While that technology is _theoretically_ possible, GSbAG doesn\'t use it.  Not
profitable.  We don\'t have the facilities or the parts.  You might try Kleon\'s
Kustom Kruisers, down the street..."

And, on a related note, I\'ve been looking over the Reft Sector lately, and
wondering how the Island subsectors got explored and settled.  There is no J-6
route to them from either "bank" of the rift.  I can imagine a special scout
cruiser modified for 2xJ-4...  using 80% of hull volume for fuel!  (I assume
these worlds were settled long before the drop tank fiasco of 1105.)

But I can\'t imagine a _colony ship_ outfitted for J-4 twice.  Who would do
such a thing?  How many colonists?  At what cost?  Does anyone have any
history...  or any bright ideas?  --S

True.  My point was that the estimate that was being made fit in within
a factor of two of the other estimates that had been made, and therefore
seemed to be a good starting place for discussion.  The arguments being
made probably stay pretty much the same for a GDP-per-capita from kCr 12  
to kCr 30 per head, but I haven\'t paid that much attention.  

Maybe someone thinks that a better estimate is kCr 5 per head, and that
that makes something in the background break.  That\'s fine, and if true
then they should start from that point and justify it.  The alternative
is not to make any estimate, and argue in circles.

To be honest, I\'ve been ignoring most of the fast courier thread.  I
treat X-boat routes as routes the Tukera long lines and regular xmail
follow.  Faster communications have usually been available through
various means when necessary.

G:T misjump chances are simply too high.

I would suggest that the chances listed are the odds of doing it all in a
20 minute time frame - if you use the \'Trading Energy for Skill\' rules out
of Gurps Basic as \'Trading Time for Skill\', then you can (by taking things
nice and easy) have an average crew (skill 12-14) safely jump, barring crit
failures.

Of course, you need a crack crew to do the much more difficult task of
managing a jump out in combat.

>>>>
My understanding of using skill rolls is that they are not used for
routine tasks that you do every day succesfully; they are used to
represent the task during times of stress.

ex:  You wouldn\'t make a skill roll for walking down the sidewalk
during the day with noone bothering  you, nice weather, not
intoxicated, etc.
You _would_ make a skill roll if intoxicated, distracted (someone
shooting at you with an FGMP-15), x2 gravity, freezing rain, etc.

So, unless there is something going on during a particular Jump
setup, I wouldn\'t make them routinely roll for it.  In other words I
wouldn\'t bother having them roll if it is a jump that goes from and to
systems the ship has been to before, the ship is in good condition,
purified fuel, plenty of time to calculate Jump parameters (or
especially using course tapes from the Starport), with no outside
interference, and beyond the 100d limit.  When to make rolls is when
one of those factors is no longer perfect.  Of course, as a ref\'s plot
device it can always be important (the Star Trek standard "subspace
anomaly" can always occur for those annoying players who insist on
making sure the ship is in perfect condition).  Therefore, having an
"opposed" task makes some sense so that the players think it is a
Routine roll, but the ref knows that it is really a roll at a
Formidable level (or whatever).

On page 87, PE states that "any Pocket Empire known to have thrown
nuclear and biological weapons at an _unsuspecting_ [emphasis added]
world will be regarded as untrustworthy...."

Seems to me that retaliation is not as big a problem as first use
(during a given turn).  I would interpret this as follows:

1.  First use of WMD by the attacking PE causes a loss of prestige equal
to the Attack DM of the weapon.

2.  Retaliatory use of WMD by the target PE results in a possible loss
of prestige.  Subtract the Attack DM of the attacking PE\'s WMD from the
Attack DM of the target PE\'s WMD to determine loss of prestige for the
target PE.  Thus, if I retaliate in kind, using equivalent weapons, I
take no hit.  OTOH, if I use my TL 14 bioweapon (Attack DM of +4) to
retaliate for your use of TL 7 non-persistent nerve agent (Attack DM of
+1), this will be seen as overkill, and will subtract 3 from my prestige
(you, of course, will subtract 1 from your prestige for the initial
escalation).  Under no circumstances can a PE _gain_ prestige from
retaliatory use of WMD.

I am using an alien race like the famous greys as a race that became
starfaring after the Ancients Final War, but before the Vilani (and by some
time... say c-20,000 Imperial)... Their homeworld, etc is a great mystery, but
they\'ve payed visits to Terra, Vland, Sylea, Zhant but always stay just beyond
the ability to detect them, yet for some reason seem to always leave clues to
their presence, as if on purpose.  Maybe they were an experiment of one of the
draysaskin.  Whatever the case, they have interest in humans (of all sub
races).  Some claim it\'s all a manipulation of (insert fav conspirator here:
templars, Illuminati, Hivers, Chthulu, politicians, the religious right, etc
etc) and/or bogus.

Further, there are a few other "elder races" as well.  (I just like the idea
of Babylon 5\'s First Ones too much to leave things solely to the "younger"
races).  Some have died, some have gone to other galaxies.  Many ruins are
mixed among the ancients (in fact ancient sites were happily inhabited by more
than a couple).  Most have erased all evidence of their existence (or been
erased themselves).  Some have hung around and are watching the younger races
(and maybe even interfering now and then).  Most are gone.
 
Some I\'ve based on Star Control races (the Chenjesu and Ur-Quan,
particularly), also the "ancients" from Starflight.  Some of these, use
alternate tech ftl (and commo) from the original Fire, Fusion, and Steel.
Subspace and stargates/wormholes only so far, though i\'ve been tossing around
introducing Stutterwarp.  Nothing like having my players exclaim ("how the
hell did they do that??")

The few that remain in the Charted Space are way above being affected (or even
noticed) by Virus, though the Black War and Collapse caught the attention of a
couple...

Yesterday afternoon the New Zealand government again proved that they

maratime nation almost solely dependant on sea trade for it\'s earnings
and having the fourth largest territorial waters in the world we could
get by (somehow) with a "2 Frigate Navy" (2).

This has had the Immediate result of P*ss*ng the Australians off. ( a
bad thing - unfortunately)

On the plus side, we are upgrading HMNZS Charles Upham (finally) (3)
have agreed to fund 2 extra rifle companies for the army and lease/buy
28 F-16A/B\'s for the Air Force.
The F-16\'s are coming cheap though.(4)

OBTRAV:(5) I\'m sure that in the core areas of the 3I there will be
systems like this. say a trinary star system with a starport of B, a
rich trade code a resaerch base in the far companion,  extensive
asteroidal mining in the outer system, Oort belt and close companion....
with 2 SDB\'s , 6 gigs, and 28 9ton fighters to defend it all.
This is how piracy survives in the 3I (6)
Just off hand does anyone know of a system B***64*-*  Ag  Ri   Trinary
in the core sectors somewhere? I\'d like to develop it.

OBTRAV: Will politicians remain this blind and/or dumb over the next
3,600 years??


(1) There is no New Zealand version - YET.

(2) "2 Frigate navy" is a contradiction in terms. To keep the ships in
order- more importantly keep crews for them - It takes 3 ships, minimum.

(3) This should have been started over a year ago - the papers said  it
needed extensive refiting when we bought the ship- why is everybody
acting like they\'ve just discovered that now and screaming "LEMON" to
anyone who\'ll listen???

(4) I will not comment on this beyond stating that the defence minister
has said for the record that "They are the Best Strike aircraft of their
kind int the world."

(5) See, there is a point to this rant after all.

Well, aside from the fact that most people don\'t buy stocks based
on the hourly price, the fact is that, since it will take weeks
to get your order to the world in question either way, the trader
needs to have some way of dealing with the delay.

One might arrange to have a ship take news of such things to
a certain destination (though I suspect that simply having
a local representative present to buy stock on site would
make more sense) but I don\'t see that as supporting an X-boat
level of service.

The question isn\'t wether megacorps would benefit, the point is
whether they would benefit often enough to support a X-boat
kind of jump-6 system.

And, on a related note, I\'ve been looking over the Reft Sector lately, and
wondering how the Island subsectors got explored and settled.  There is no J-6
route to them from either "bank" of the rift.  I can imagine a special scout
cruiser modified for 2xJ-4...  using 80% of hull volume for fuel!  (I assume
these worlds were settled long before the drop tank fiasco of 1105.)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The Islands subsectors, as described in the CT Adventure _Trillion Credit
Squadron_, were settled by the European Space Administration
Long Range Colonization project - an expedition using sublight
multi-generation colony ships, launched before jump drives were even
invented. 

There is some speculation that they were deliberately sent so far,
and told not to contact anyone on the way, so they could set up
a secret settlement of humanity far from home - so that no matter
how bad a catastrophe engulfed Earth and nearby systems, humanity
would survive. The threat must have seemed great to justify such
a project.

What threat could this be? Some have theorized that the threat was
the Vilani Imperium, supposedly not contacted yet - somehow the
policy makers on Earth knew that a massive chunk of the local
galaxy was already owned.

The Islands Clusters in TCS were designed for a fleets-vs-fleets
strategic scenario, and the clusters were specifically mapped
so there would be definite boundries to the conflict. The history of
the clusters was written in an attempt to explain the presence of
people in the middle of the Great Rift, and TML\'ers have speculated
from there.

That said, I\'d wonder if the the circa-1105 Islands Clusters wouldn\'t
be home to more recognizable customs and societies than any other
place in known space. While they have been settled for some hundreds
of years, the original colonists were from combination coldsleep/generation
ships - some of the original colonists of the subsectors were from
pre-interstellar Earth - they were thousands of years out of time by the
time they awoke on New Home, and some of them had awoken during
the voyage as living reminders of society on distant Earth.

Well, I don\'t remember exactly what was refering to what.  But
if you are refering to the various proposals that purport to
show that various large organizations could afford to build
a higher jump system with a small fraction (usually down
around 1% of their budgets)...
a) At least one of them, once you got down to net profit,
had a 5% difference.  A large corp most certainly cares if
their net profit changes by even 1%.
b) Most of the analyses are forced to make assumptions that,
while "reasonable" could also be reasonably made at values
that are quite different.
c) "a" and "b" are irrelvant anyway because no large corp
is going to spend even 1% (or 0.01%) of their budget on
something that they don\'t see a return for.  So the %age
of a corp\'s budget it would take to do it is irrelevant.

The point what that being able to carry less urgent mail would
help pay for the jump-6 network.  If you are sending it by

Well, as I said, that is debatble.

The point I was making there is that there will be some valuation
of need.  Sure they might decide that a jump-6 X-boat network
will pay for itself in fleet effectiveness (though I don\'t
think so).  However, they won\'t pay for one because it is
"only 1% of the budget".  Thus, any analysis that only figures
out how much of the budget would need to be spent on something
hasn\'t proven anything.  It does establish that it would be
financially possible, but nothing more.

Build a ship with fuel for J6 and a J3+ drive, and you\'ve got a J6 ship, of
sorts.

Do it with a J1 drive and you can build one at TL9!

Obviously such things are slow, but they still meet the requirements of
rift/border crossers - jump 6 parsecs without stopping to refuel.

Actually the Joes do have TL F worlds (such as Zhdant), just like the
Imperium has TL G worlds.  It\'s their standard stuff that\'s TL E. 
Potentially, they could have high jump capability TL F ships - BUT I really
really doubt they would use them on suicide missions....

Alan Bradley

ps: Joe world generation is a bit different from standard Impie stuff. 
There may actually be a TL E cap, but it doesn\'t apply to Zhdant, or to
anywhere else the ref decides....  I\'m talking pre-Regency settings, of
course!

Remember government type 1?  Many corporations, and not just Megacorps, are
already "legitimate planetary governments".  Amongst other things, this
gives them loopholes for maintaining "planetary navies" and armies.

There appears to be a strong correlation between Megacorp owners and senior
noble families.  "Stomping them out" is called starting a civil war...

Incidentally, one aspect of the Julian War was a conflict between the
Imperial Megacorps and the Menderes Corporation.  Menderes won.

I\'m not sure that you got my point. The difference of a few hours could mean
the difference between making 310 MegaCredits from a stock trade and making
20 MegaCredits (imaginary values invented as examples).

I wasn\'t commenting on the frequency of trading. I was commenting on the
frequency of information. Getting information days (or even mere hours)
before others is too useful to a megacorporation to just be ignored.

The on-site corporate representative only knows as much as everyone else in
that market. That\'s the problem that megacorporations would have to deal
with on a regular basis.

Example:

Imagine I run a stock trading company in a subsector in Daibei. I have
agencies trading in the markets of various worlds in that subsector. In the
core regions, Delgado, LIC announces that it is releasing a new line of
computer games based on an extremely popular Imperium wide children\'s vid
series. Presumably, as this information hits every world, subsector and
sector, the price of Delgado stock is going to go up. Knowing that Delgado
stock is going to shoot up before the local markets find out could be very
important. That would give my company the advantage that casual traders, or
corporations with little money (or little foresight) would not have.

Maybe the company I run was going to sell off all its Delgado shares based
on the poor performance of one of its weapon designs in the subsector. Now I
know that Delgado shares have a good chance of shooting up in price. I can
wait. On the other hand, maybe my company has no Delgado shares. Maybe I was
waiting until the stock hit a certain low price. Now, I know I have to buy
very soon or the price will shoot up.

>The question isn\'t wether megacorps would benefit, the point is
>whether they would benefit often enough to support a X-boat

As I said, my own take on it is that they would exist. I don\'t think it
would have the total coverage that the Xboat routes have. I think that
they\'d probably exist in the subsector/sector range especially, with maybe a
few dedicated, high-priced routes along  major routes from high volume trade
centers.

One of the major problems is that Traveller\'s world creation system isn\'t
designed to make sense. As a result, trade routes and "mains" and all these
things are left completely to random chance. In reality, they\'d probably
develop over time.

It does provide food (since GURPS full lifesupport provides
full life support).  A number of GM\'s have indicated that
they rule that the food provided is such a tasteless mush
that almost everyone prefers to buy "real food" to take along,
which is fine since nothing says what the food tastes like.
(this would make a good option rule in a sidebar in the Naval
supplement).  In my campaign I decided that the "food"
is so nearly inedible that they don\'t bother to install
that part of the life support system except for exploration
vessels and others that have some chance of getting caught
without food for a long period of time.

Not being sure of what their duties are, what do you need a Navy for?
Here in the States we have a separate service, the Coast Guard, that
handles everything that most everyone else needs a navy for, customs
interdiction, fishing regulation, rescues, piracy supression (yes
Virginia, pirates _do_ exist off the US coast...mostly in the caribbean
and gulf), etc. If you\'re asking 2 frigates to do that, I agree, your
politicians are nuts! If what the navy does is \'show the flag\', then 2
ships are fine...

Traveller News Service - 001-0174
After celebrating the beginning of the new year, the Church of Sylea\'s
(page 23) Bishop of Antares made a public statement requestion that the
Restored Canon Church of Sylea (pg. 17), stop interfering with its
activities in the Antares subsector, and especially with the missionary
work of the Monastic Order of St. Marc (pg. 31).  An unnamed source
within the CoS heirarchy in Antares hinted that the Monastic Order of the
Soldiers of God (pg. 22), also known as the Chaplains, or Battle Chaplains,
has been harassing the Monks of St. Marc, and may be in league with
the RCCS.  Several others have remarked that the Ricardos, members
of the Religious Military Order of St. Ricardo I, King of Sylea (pg. 27),
have been increasingly visible in Antares sector.  Could a Holy War be
shaping up in Antares between these religious orders, with the CoS and
the Ricardos on one side, the RCCS and the Battle Chaplains on the other,
with the peaceful educating monks of St. Marc caught in between?
Stay tuned.

Yes, I agree that the NZ government is dumber than mud.  So is the
Australian government.

IMO the ANZAC frigates are good for two things only:
1.  Subsidising the Australian shipbuilding industry.
2.  Allowing the US navy to have token client forces with them next time
they fight a war.

So: who will the NZ navy be fighting?  Australia?  The US?  France?  
IMO most likely it would be supporting an "intervention" in some place like
Fiji, Vanuatu or Bougainville, or "showing the flag" in the Gulf.

OBTRAV:  Client states are likely to maintain small jump-capable navies
(basically Gazelles, Patrol Cruisers or Merc Cruisers), in addition to
SDBs, to allow them to "support" Imperial fleets, or intervene in other
smaller clients and non-aligned worlds, with Imperial permission of course.

No comment, as I don\'t want to restart the piracy debate.  Lots of worlds
IMTU have "navies" about this size.  My comment above suggests that the
analogy should be with small jump-capable ships, rather than SDBs.

Say the price on an company is low, and the local corp-rep gets the load-down
that this particular company has gotten a huge contract. He sends the
information to the board which say takes 7 days to get there. They see this
as an oppurtunity and send the "buy"-message back. During these to weeks 
the price of the company will have gone up tremendously as the planetbased
companies buys all the stocks. 

How do you do stock trade this way. I\'m not even sure that there will be stocks
in a soceity that has interstellar travel this way. Are there other ways of
setting up the system that would be more benifical? Is the stock market type
influenced by our "Real World"-point of view?

But before who. How can you be sure that your information is in your hands
before it is in other hands. What info are you going to try to capitalize on.
Which deals can you get before the others try to get it. Which ones is
there no point in doing because some other megacorp has the edge. In a
soceity with the information lags like the IMperium, I really think you have
more the:

" Well, Frank, this is you budget this year. I hope you\'ll make us a 
big a profitt on Vland as you did last year. "

You get more independent local reps that get a budget and try to make 
a profitt. The more sucessful you are the easier it is to get that
promotion of that dirtball you spend the last three years on.

The Islands Clusters (New Islands and Old Islands subsectors, Reft Sector)
were settled by sublight colony ships from Earth.  Three ships built by the
European Space Agency departed Earth orbit in AD 2050 (-2461 Imperial) with
100,000 colonists in low berths (each) and smaller, generation-ship style
crews.  The ships arrived in the Clusters around AD 4512 (-9 Imperial) and
spent most of the next millenium spreading colonies throughout the region
at sublight velocities.

In AD 5501 (980 Imperial), the Imperial Strike Cruiser Eldorado misjumped
to Serendip Belt in the Clusters as a result of battle damage sustained
during the Third Frontier War.  Her crew taught the Belters enough to help
them repair the jump drives, and she returned to the Imperium in AD 5504
(984 Imperial) through the use of auxiliary jump fuel tanks*.  The Belters
used this experience to develop jump drives of their own.  When the
Imperial Scout Service sent a mission to follow up on Eldorado\'s contact in
AD 5534 (988 Imperial), they discovered Serendip Belt on the verge of
conquering the rest of the Clusters.  For reasons unknown the Scouts
elected to spread jump technology to seven other worlds in the Clusters,
ensuring their division and rivalry for at least the next hundred-odd
years.

All this information is covered in Traveller Supplement 5: Trillion Credit
Squadron, pp. 40-48 (? I\'m going from memory).  It was originally a naval
campaign setting, and so the large number of rival worlds makes sense in
that context.  Why the ESA chose to send a colony so far out is the subject
of occasional debate on the list (check the Archives, if you\'re
interested), especially since invention of jump drive and first contact
with the Vilani followed within fifty years.

The region was covered again in The Regency Sourcebook for TNE. The
Clusters had been forcibly incorporated into the Regency to prevent them
from becoming a jumping-off point for a Vampire invasion fleet.  Contact
was maintained througn the use of deep space fuel depots ("calibration
points").

Funnily enough, New New Zealand did come up as an example of a possible
self-defending system sometime during the Great Piracy Debate of 1997-8.

I would actually argue that the above flotilla is quite adequate to defend
your average pop 6, starport C world, against ethically-challenged
civilians, especially if you arm the fighters with the Traveller equivalent
of the Penguin. You cant defend the Outsystem, but hells, who can ?

The Anzac Frigates are quite capable of blue-water operation, so I\'d call
them Frigates rather than SDBs - they should be jump-2 capable at least.

Doesnt New Zealand have a couple of Orion patrol aircraft as well ?

I dont know about gov type 4, but Mongo (1204 Jewell/Spinward Marches)
comes pretty close. Binary system, Ag Ni Ri, pop 6 ... gov type is 8, but
we Civil Servants know who really runs the country. Phlume (1611 Vilis/SM)
is another option.

G:T missiles have the same problem most other missiles have - any missile
hit destroys any other missile.

Thus, expensive ship-wreckers get hit by very small, very cheap,
point-defense missiles.

No. The Vilani bureaux are \'structural features\' of Vilani interstellar
society. Using the term \'megacorporation\' for them is not precisely correct
- - they are part corporation, part subculture, part State ...

At the time, Zhunatsu Corp (aka the Third Imperium) was negotiating at the
Vilani from a position of rough equality - the Vilani had slipped to TL9 or
10, and their interstellar zone of influence had shrunk to a couple of
subsectors.

See if you can find a copy of Milleau Zero. It\'s got a lot of good stuff in
it.

If this is the case, then the \'book\' streamlined A1 and A2 class Free
Traders are going to be very, very rare. The \'standard\' low-jump Free
Trader (suitable for insystem and short-haul work) is going to be
dedicating that 20% of total volume to firstly cargo, secondly some
contragravity and thirdly some more m-drive modules.

Big woop. Load em up as cargo on an outgoing freighter, take em to a C
starport, maintain em and send em back. Do it on a 2 year maintainence
cycle (it isnt as if they are going into jumpspace).

The problem is that starport facilities suitable for small traders (sub
2000 tons) look to cost about twelve megacredits (eight for two shuttles,
two for a refining plant and some LHyd drums, and two for some defenses and
a pond).

Handwaving this strategy out of existance is possible, but if you dump the
streamlining on an Empress Marava class A2, you can take the cargo up by
about double (say, another 35 dtons of cargo, and another 5 M-drive).
Sticker cost goes up to MCr 38.5, but cargo capacity is now 83 dtons
(better than a fully streamlined Beowulf-class A1).

Economics is everything.

Sigh. 

This is NOT how trade in such a system works. It can\'t. In a system
where local managers are required to respond to events and opportunities
faster than the communications delay would allow, they have to have the
authority and resources to act on their own initiative. 

Your hypothetical corp rep buys the stocks himself, when he feels their
value is appropriate, using the corporate resources he has available to
him. He just has to maintain a sizeable bank account to do this. This is
something that is easily slowed to the pace imposed by the OTU travel
lag. He includes these details in his weekly, or monthly report to
subsector HQ, which may not see it for another month. Just because the
pace of business isn\'t as fast as it is here, now, doesn\'t automatically
mean that it doesn\'t exist.

This is exactly how such things were handled here on earth before the
advent of rapid worldwide communications in the last century or so. The
Ney York Stock exchange was founded in 1792. The London stock Exchange
was founded some 20 years earlier, by a group of existing stock brokers.
This is long before the advent of modern communications; in fact it is
an exact model of Traveller economics, as the speed of communication is
limited to the speed of transport. Commerce in Traveller is NOT
centralized, the Dilbert model of Managerial Micromanagement does not
work. This is why the Imperial government is set up the way it is, with
the central authority setting policy in an abstract fashion, expecting
the local rep[resentatives, using their own authority and lines of
credit, if need be, to act upon the abstract and implement it.

A local manager that loses money over the period of a year or so will be
fired or demoted. One that makes a lot of money will be promoted,
perhaps to the subsector management level where she will have to depend
on the judgement of her picked lackeys...err... subordinates to make the
tactical decisions on planet. The point is, that the management
hierarchy is extradinarily flattened between the planetary level and the
megacorp HQ level. It has to be, you can\'t do the kind of \'Master may
I?\' decision making processes we use today.

Todays system of micro management, hourly trading in stocks (daily
trading exists now, I can only expect, that as the trading systems get
more automated, there will be people who are making money trading on an
hourly basis) simply cannot work in the OTU. 

However, stocks as a method of capitalization of business are just too
damn useful to go away; it is a cornerstone of economic development as
we know it. The rate at which they are traded may change, but the
concept remains the same.

It\'s also possible, however, that Delgado\'s stock is only traded on one 
planet - Regina, or the planet with its corporate headquarters. That\'s (in
some sense) the way most stocks work now, and worked in the 19th 
century - they are only traded on one exchange, which does have a physical
location, and your ability to purchase those shares if you\'re not
physically present is limited by the speed of communication (instantaneous
today, but significant in the past.)

On the other hand, there could be information from non-central planets that
will influence the price of Delgado; for example, if Delgado computer games
are cited as the motivation in a grisly mass-murder on Glisten, the first
person on Regina to know that could buy up quite a bit of Delgado stock on the
margin.

If you are trading on the fundamentals (like most people, rather
than some sort of market timing strategy) then the fluctuations
up and down average out (or you just put in a limit on how
much you are willing to pay and list some alternate stocks).

If you are talking about buying based on news that the others
don\'t have.  I\'m not sure that such news will warrent an
X-boat level of service.  (At any jump, a few worlds will
get the info first and beat everyone further away, the best
way is to know the news is coming and be prepared to use
it).  In any case, if you are trying to make money by getting
news before others, then you don\'t want a jump-6 X-boat network.

That\'s a huge compliment.  I was really impressed with what I saw.  You
don\'t know how hard that is for me to say since I\'ve never been turned
on by anything that GURPS did.

I\'ve got to admit.  I like the look of the newer games these days.  This
is almost the year 2000, and there\'s no reason why the gaming industry
shouldn\'t benefit from high production values in game products.  I like
the way games like the new Star Trek game, Star Wars, Vampire, and
Alternity look--I didn\'t say I like all of those games.  I just think
that\'s the direction that production values in games should take.  The
flashy pictures, sleek design, and slick pages look good and add value
to the product for me.  The game mechanics and stuff inside have to be
good too, but I feel like I\'ve bought a better quality product when it
is packaged properly.

Maybe it\'s because I concentrated on marketing when I was in school, or
maybe it\'s just because I like nice things--but I like the new, sleek,
glossy stuff.

GURPS Traveller (or any of the GURPS stuff, for that matter) doesn\'t
fall into this "new-look" category, but I liked it none-the-less.  From
what I saw, G: T looks like a simple, good gaming product that will hold
its own with the DGP stuff and the earlier Trav stuff.

I did like it.

And, here\'s the biggest compliment of all.  If I pick up my Trav game
again sometime in the near future (unlikely, since we are having a blast
with my Star Wars game that we have been playing for the last six
months), I will buy the GURPS stuff EVEN IF I DON\'T USE THE GURPS RULES.

I just saw too much good Trav info in there to not buy it.

Good job, Loren.  Good job, SJG.

That\'s it, I can\'t stand it anymore.  I\'ve got to see this stuff for

Michel,

I would recommend Bruce\'s DSR(Definative Sensor Rules) as a starting place,
they cover all major points and allows for a fairly extensive EW/ECM
effects. In basic terms EW/ECW realy only effects the signal strength
levels. I only disagree with the DSR on the cost factors not declining with
TL increases.

	They\'re hurting even more than you think, because they didn\'t make
the sale to NZ ... the F-16 is a *Lockheed* product. Although
Lockheed may not be getting much off this sale, either, as it sounds
like these are used or surplus models (the A & B are fairly old

	It\'s not just the very first class, it\'s also an annual requirement,

training. It\'s amazing how many military lawyers are *terrible*

    'body' => 'We seem to have three schools of thought on this.

The first one is that an Express Postal Service is not economically
worthwhile, and thus does not exist in the late Third Imperium.

The second one is that an Express Postal system is so worthwhile that it
presents a threat to Imperial Security, and has been prevented, in order to
protect the Imperial State\'s news advantage vis a vis it\'s citizens.

The third one is that at least one Express Postal system co-exists with the
Xboat system.

Now, I have big problems with the first school of thought, because a fast
courier costs within an order of magnitude of a Far Trader, and there are
plenty of orginisations that can afford lots of Far Traders. News is so
clearly such a valuable commodity that I am surprised that anyone would
argue that it isnt worth gigacredits to be consistently the first with it. 

I have problems with the second school of thought, because the people who
would benefit from an Express Postal System are the people who could afford
to use it - the Imperial Elite of the nobility, the megacorporattions and
the mercantile community in general. 

Furthermore, these are the same people with the resources and contacts to
bribe the officials in charge of any Navy or Imperial Fast Courier system
into including commercial packets with normal packets.

The officials in charge of passing along packets of information would also
have the awful temptation of using that information for their own ends.

Thus, only having a Naval or Imperial system may have the same net effect
and has the added risk of increasing the amount of corruption in the system.

Now, when the X-boat system was set up, it did use state of the art
technology, and if we are vaguely charitable towards Arbatrella\'s
bureaucrats, we can assume that the nodes were at the time the important
worlds.

I like the idea of the Imperium just coming out of an economic slump, with
the Solomani Rim War and the Fourth and Fifth Frontier Wars taking up too
much of Imperial resources to implement the plans to fix up the Xboat
system. A series of *big* loans to the Imperium to fund the above wars
could also explain a slowdown in megacorporate investments ... IMO the main
Imperial method of raising cash would be through bond issues to megacorps -
they pay the cash, and then the Imperium pays them back over many years,
when the tax revenues start flowing back through.

If you like conspiracy campaigns, we could have Everyone Who Counts
maintaining the polite fiction that news goes via the xboat system, and *of
course* no-one has express couriers that go faster than this (with
Imperialines being a second-order secret).

Most everyone takes care to maintain deniability when they take advantage
of advance knowledge, of course ...

Now, one of the major bureaucratic developments that accompanied the end of
the FFW could be the official recognition that allowing civilians to use
jump-6 couriers will not result in the End of the Imperium As We Know It,
and will indeed save the Imperium from having to redevelop the Xboat
system, as jump-6 vessels will be required to carry Priority X-mail at a
tariff of Cr 1 000 per dton, at the request of an Imperial Official.

        Hi again, Jon!
        Since you obviously have got the Heavy Textbooks at your disposal,
nebula can be caused by a star going nova, yes?  The gas cloud is the
"stuff" left over from the stellar matter, right?  Was just working on my
may, and the premise behind the existance of the "Obsidian Sheild" IMTU was
a ~TL18 interstellar civil war fought by a near-stellar neighbour race about
11000y ago.  They figured out enough about stellar processes to touch off a
couple of stars before they blew themselves back to TL0....  So I have two
"was a star" locations that are now the "North" and "South" extents of the
"Obsidian Sheild Nebula".  Given what I am postulating, could there be a
nebula there, or should it really be something else?
        Obviously "canon" and MTU have never been in the same room together,
but that is a different issue =).

I need to see / feel the stuff, first.  I\'m having a hard time
believing that it\'s any good.  And is it worth having if you aren\'t
going to use the GURPS rule books?

I\'m not sure what model they are, but apparently they were intended for

refunded the deposit, either). They\'ve got very low hours on them - the
highest flight hours is something like 11 hours. At least they\'re on a ten
year lease with an option to buy at the end - hpoefully we\'ll lease \'em for
the ten years and then buy something else.

It sounds like they\'re a really good deal - if you\'re in the market for
F16s. However new fighters or attack aircraft is supposed to be bottom
piority for our spending, and F16s aren\'t really ideal for our mission
requirements anyway. Obviously our government is a sucker for the \'deal of
the century\'. Never mind that this means the Navy has to find a way of
keeping an ancient frigate in service for another four years with no
guarantee of a replacement even then. Never mind that the $500 million for
the Army still isn\'t going to be enough to buy all the gear they nedd to be
an up-to-date light infantry army. Thank the Powers that the government
hasn\'t lost its mind completely and gone out and bought a whole lot of M1s
or equivilent.

As I understand the astrophysics, a couple of different phenomena might be
relevant to what you\'re talking about here.

Most red giant stars near the end of their natural lives tend to experience "mass
loss" (i.e. they blow a lot of matter into space -- kind of like a very intense solar
wind).  This can come to a peak at the end of the star\'s life, when it loses its
entire outer shell.  The core becomes a white dwarf star, while the bulk of the
star\'s mass forms a "planetary nebula" that slowly dissipates into space.
Planetary nebulae tend to be one or two parsecs across, and are fairly dense.
They\'re also bright -- they give off light because they\'re excited by the white
dwarf star at their center.

The canonical examples of a planetary nebula are the Ring Nebula or the
Helix Nebula (the latter, oddly enough, is probably in Imperial space).

A more massive giant star, large enough to go supernova, will produce a
nebular remnant like the Crab Nebula or Veil Nebula.  These are also
bright nebulae, which tend to expand dissipate faster (they have more "kick"
behind them).

You\'d have to decide how violent the occasion was when your two stars were
blown up, but in either case you\'d get a region of relatively dense (but
*bright*)
nebulosity.  The time-frame you\'re talking about might be reasonable.  If I
remember correctly, all the nebulae I\'ve just referred to are thought to be at
most 20,000 years old.  You might have a white dwarf at the location of each
of your victim stars.

        Hi, Jon!  Thanks for the great info.
        So, just to be sure I understand what you understand, the nebula
would be "bright" due to excitaiton from the left over white dwarf, yes?  If
the remnant was reasonably "cool", such as a brown dwarf, then the amount of
excitation and therefore luminosity would be negiligible, do you suppose?  
        The weapon used was similar to the "trilithium" warhead in "ST:TNG
Generations"...  it basically "shuts off" the star at the nuclear level
(Hells own Nuke Damper) so there would have been lots of matter to blow off,
and a "cold" remnant.  I doubt the players will ever have to worry about it,
but I want my map to make as much sense as possible, given the seriousness
of the change to near space I am talking about.
        Any idea how "wide" the Crab and Veil Nebula are?  If not I am sure
I can find it on the web...

I can think of one very obvious source for a jump-6 network.

Any news media megacorp in Imperial space (or even a
almost-but-not-quite-megacorp), would most likely benefit hugely from a
jump-6 network. After all, those who report the news first get market share.

If you have a jump-4 news network, and a jump-6 news network, who do you
think the public are going to pay the most attention to?

Or that matter, if you have two holovid distributors, one at jump-4, and the
other at jump-6, which one do you think will be supplying all the premiers?

Or maybe you all think that news and entertainment media will not be a big
cash industry in the Far Future.

The TNS jump-6 net, anyone?

Bravo!
What we really need for policing the waters of our island nation are some
fast patrol boats! Not useless (to us anyway) frigates!
Bang an anti-sub mortar on your PT and throw in some cannon (20-30mm) and
you\'ve got enough to stop the largest threat we are able to stop anyhow. The
frigates are a waste of money that could have been more effectively spent.

I may be wrong here guys, but General Dynamics builds the F-16 right here in
Texas.
Now Lockheed may have bought GD, but I doubt it.
I have friends who are Midmanagers with GD and I could ask, but I don\'t
think I am wrong here.
Can\'t believe NZ bought A and B models.

Ice,

I\'ve been using Adobe Acrobat to make up packages for my plans (none are
truely complete, mostly due to the fact that I\'m working a campaign that,
along with Real Life, is killing my time!). When they are done I hope to
include deck plans, visual and text descriptions, and a graphic illo., I\'ll
send tha spread sheet on request. The adobe files are greatly reduced in
size to the originals, I\'m not sure how they\'d react to being ZIPped. One of
the reasons for this is to allow them to be cross platform (IBM/Mac can both
read adobe).

As to plain ZIP or self-extracting, I\'d say plain, it reduces the file
slightly more. Most IBM type owners (I sure) have some type of zip
extraction. If not the can always grab one off of someplace like WWW.
Download.com . I\'m not sure if the Mac users can use ZIP or not? If not a .
txt file might be useful for them.

 Less than 0.01%, in the case of Mora - and that to connect the
entire Imperial Marches to Capital. "Maintenance" would be 5-10%
of that, except that they\'d be supporting it through willingly
paid fees for services rendered - and cheap at the price, too.

  Interesting theory. OC, the % it would take _is_ relevant
to the likelihood of a project being undertaken, especially
if it\'s likely to show a profit. YMMV.

We\'ll shortly have less of them. They\'re getting long in the tooth and are
hellishly expensive to buy. Thus we\'re supposedly looking for a cheaper
alternative, but I doubt we\'ll bother replacing them, more\'s the pity.

A few minor problems with using patrol boats - with what will we show the
flag in the Cook Is, etc? How does one render assistance to Pacfic Islands
and private vessels after hurricanes using a fast patrol boat? And most
important, how does one patrol our southern waters during a winter storm?
Bear in mind that if your patrol boat is in harbour during a storm the
fishing vessels (which are ocean going) will ride out the storm, steal the
fish while the boats are moving out to sea and be gone by the time the
boats get there.

If we had the money for six+ frigate I\'d be all for only having three
(enough to have at least one at sea at all times) and spending the rest on
fast missile boats, but without some form of blue water navy there\'s no
point having patrol boats.

  FWIW, the Imperium may very well not recognize the concept of "insider
trading" as being related to messaging lags. Sure, concealing information
or colluding to manipulate a market may be offences (and if not Imperial
then certainly recognized as applying throughout the Imperium) but being
in possession of more recent info and using it would be unlikely to be
punishable simply because enforcement would be a genuine nightmare.

  As someone pointed out about the size and availability of capital pools,
Imperial megacorps may be a lot more like the Japanese (& vaguely like the
German, IIRC) model of a core financial institution and the businesses that
accumulated over time. Although the main business may not be structured that
way (although Tukera for one certainly looks it with all the subsidiary lines)
the impracticality of central control of day to day business means that each
sector (or smaller) unit will tend to function independently, with operations
only becoming more coherent as the time horizons of projects begins to over-
shadow the normal commo lag (i.e., 5-year plans may make sense, but fixes to
allow for local conditions have to be made on the spot).

 You shut off all nuclear reaction in a star\'s core, result: with all
photon pressure gone the star collapses into itself. Unless there is
something actually _sustaining_ the nuclear damping after the fusion in
the star dies (unlikely), you\'ll end up with a) a neutron star, b) a black
hole, depending on the mass of the original star.
  And of course you also have the rapidly expanding shell of stellar
ejecta, which again is glowing like crazy being excited by sychrotron
(etc.) radiation either from the neutron star or the black hole\'s
accretion disk.

  I\'m unclear as to why you\'re responding to your own previous paragraph,
but I\'ll concede the point as you\'ve indicated that data capacity is not
a problem. However, J-5+ couriers can offer _cheaper_ service than J-4.

  Mr. Prior, I believe. However, this eliminates the complaint that J-6
couriers have low cargo capacity, as it\'s not an issue to their mission.

  What about the fact that the J-4 service (and forget about the
meandering 2.6 parsec average concept) is more expensive than J-5
service, and very little cheaper than J-6?

It has several, and for a while in the eighties they
had some of the most modern ASW equipment in the world, but even
before that we regularly won the Fincastle trophy for
ASW work.

Of course, we always had to hide the the little switch that launched
the nukes at air-shows, wouldn\'t do to let the public know that
nuclear-free New Zealand has nuclear-capable aircraft.

There are several utilities that enable mac users to handle zip (stuffit deluxe 
and unzipit spring to mind). I don\'t have the URLs handy, but do a web search 
with the keywords "mac zip". I\'m sure some of the regular mac users could 
provide a lot more.

 You might want to check out www.weekendwarrior.com. I haven\'t ordered

  Oops. L-Hyd was allocated at 63_%_, or 88.2 tons. We apologize for any
inconvenience this may have caused. (OTOH, it proves that nobody bothers
reverse engineering any of these, so now we know that we can get away
with anything - bwa-ha-ha!).

  As pointed out during the recent discussions, cost per ton of cargo
delivered by data couriers is not relevant as their capacity is deemed
adequate (proving that a computer 5/6 does more than just play Pong).

Well, most of this depends on how well-surveyed a system has to be before
you can jump out of it again.

If all you need is fuel, a working jump drive, and a computer running
Generate, then you could happily do 52 parsecs along a main (200 dton
jump-1 ship, 2 spare j-drives, spare power plant, m-drives, computers,
extra fuel tankage - when you need maintainence, just switch to the
backups. Should be good for a 3 year voyage).

If you need to spend 6 months exhaustivly tracking every planetary body and
rogue comet, before ships can jump out of a system, then things are going
to be a bit slower.

Of course, a state may now *want* to explore too much, for fear of finding
someone bigger.

You may also have \'rogue\' free traders expanding Known Space without
government knowledge or permission (this was one of the things that caused

If you are interested in this sort of stuff, you should really get hold of

BUY IT!

Having read through G:T and BTC, they are both worth buying for the
background, even if you don\'t want to use GURPS.

Having FFS1&2, LBB#6, WBH, and not intending to use the system,
I think that I\'ll avoid Basic and the generic sourcebooks.

This is from someone with plenty of CT and MT stuff, whose campaign is
set in M0 and awaits T5 (The misjump is supposed to take them away from
Sylea. It might now take them to the Spinward Marches instead of the
other side of the Two Thousand Worlds - you see I am a nice guy:> -
but my conscience is fighting a desperate attempt not to pitch them into
Y1105).

The above is IMHO and I\'ll accept no liability if you claim to have
followed this advice and were disapointed.

Ditzie wants me to note (1) that the *ship* will, but if you have
contracted with Famile Spofulam for a delivery of a packet in 23 days, and
our ship arrives in 21 days, then the packet comes out of the box on the
23rd day.

If you want \'fastest possible delivery\' then you pay for fastest possible
delivery.

But you didnt, so you get what you contracted for. And if you dont like it,
pay premium rates, like your competition do.

One of the realities of space is that whilst the pilots get all the glory,
a lot of ships just arent built to navigate the high winds of an upper
atmosphere. That is where the Spacejacks come in ... small teams of men and
women who work in the cold hard vacuum of high orbit, transferring cargo
from Free Traders to small Lighters that serve the less-developed worlds of
our Imperium.

Typically, they operate out of small gigs and lighters, manhandling barrels
of Liquid Hydrogen into the ravening bellies of starships, and maneuvering
pallets of precious cargo the other way, safely into the body of a graceful
gig or cutter.

Once the cargo is shifted, they usually wait in the cargo hold of the
trading ship, as any passengers are moved across to the gig for the trip
down through the atmosphere.

The small craft then swoops home, is unloaded, and then climbs back into
the blackness of space with another cargo of drums of ell-aitch-deee.

Eventually, usually after six to eight trips, the job is done and the
Spacejacks can go back to their home ... except, for a Spacejack, home
truly is the gravity-free blackness of high orbit ...

Also known as Orbitals, Upshoremen, Shippies or Biofreight (the latter by
starship crews), these spacers specialise in moving cargo to and from
starships in orbit.

Typically, a team of Spacejacks works in conjunction with a Gig and it\'s
pilot on some under-developed world. They contract to shift the cargo off a
trading ship, and shift LHyd onto it, usually for Cr 100 per dton of
either, plus the cost of the LHyd.

This is a good deal for the Free Trader, as it allows unstreamlined ships
to avoid risking the planetary atmosphere, and the fees will provide a
decent return on the enterprise.

Like all workers, they have their own jargon ... their small craft are
lighters, so LHyd is \'lighter fluid\'. Middle passengers are carbonaceous,
so high passengers are obviously ice, because ice asteroids are more
valuable to a belter than carbonaceous. The edge of the atmosphere is the
\'interface\' or \'face\', so an unstreamlined ship is a \'facehugger\'. Starship
crews are \'dimmers\', referring to the Vilani habit of dimming the lights on
a ship just prior to jump.

You could always post a PD unzipper (or a link to one) so that people
only have to download it once if needed.

However, what about those save light macros?

(Bother, they only seem to be for Excel 5.0, my Excel 97 doesn\'t have them,

Sounds like the situation near the beginning of the century just after

Those mercenaries were hired by the Imperium. That\'s different from
carrying mercenaries who are freelancing or just being repatriated.

That\'s aplot opening, though. A mercenary unit needs to activate their
repatriation bonds, but there\'s no transport offworld. An Imperial Captain
offers offworld transport in exchange for the unit doing a job...

My first questions concerns armor for ships.
I know how to add armor to a ship, but how much armor should a ship.
the ships included in the GT book, have vastly varying armor rates.
for example, the Dragon Class SDB (page 144) has a DR of
1011, ok...its a combat vessel, its supposed to have armor. 
The Broadsword class mercenary cruiser (page 139) also a
combat vessel, unless I\'m mistaken, has a DR of 100.  quite
a discrepancy.  The two other combat starships in the GT
book, both fighters, the rampart and Iramada class fighters
(both on page 138) have DRs of 1175 and 200 respectively.  I
had originally thought that this was due to the difference
in tech levels, with the rampart being TL12 and the iramada
being TL10, but both the dragon and the broadsword are TL10.

My next problem is with the cost and mass of the armor. 
should armor at TL12 cost more and have more mass than the
ships hull?

Sounds to me like you need a Medium Endurance Cutter (MEC) along the lines
of U.S. Coast Guard 210\' WMECs.  See http://www.uscg.mil/datasheet/wmec.htm
for details.

Two major problems with this idea are; 1) No "real" armament on the WMEC
like AA missiles or ASW Equipment, only machine guns and one light 25mm gun
and 2). I think you\'re stuck for political reasons with whatever the ANZAC
Frigate is.

Number 1). is easily solved.  I recently (well, last summer) had the
opportunity to tour a couple of "Frigate Navy" frigates (Canada, Germany,
The Netherlands, Gr. Britain) and one thing I found on some of those
frigates was the modular nature of the weapons systems.  AAW and SS missile
were pretty much stacked up on the deck, which made them fairly easy to
add/replace/service.  I\'m sure the price in terms of damage control
problems (debateable) and increased wear and tear (mitigatable) of systems
mounted this way is made up for by the advantages, but I couldn\'t help
thinking; any ship could be outfitted with these weapons...assuming a few
square meters of deck space could be found.  Why escort tankers when they
can be provided

ASW is, of course, handled by ship launched helos, which were part of all
the frigate designs.

Problem 2) is related to the subject line and I offer no solutions, being a
yank and having no right to advise others on politics (although that
doesn\'t stop my compatriots).

To bring this kicking and screaming back to traveller;  I\'ve always wanted
to mount missiles on the outside of my fighters...kind of like contemporary
aircraft.  That also leads to mounting external missile \'pods\' on just
about any craft in the traveller inventory.  Aside from decreasing
acceleration performance (significantly in some cases) what is wrong with
this tactic?

Lockheed purchased the aviation assets fo General Dynamics, GD\'s Ft. Worth
Division IIRC, several years ago.  They did not purchase the entire company.  

The aircraft in question were originally purchased and paid for by Pakistan
before the became a nuclear power.

I seem to recall building someting like that back when T4 only had the
QSDS system.  wanted to see what the least expensive starship would run.
I called it the Polo/Tradesman Class.Think it\'s still on my website.  Yes,
at: http://magicnet.net/~cmdrx/xtek/polo.htm

I converted that thing to GT recently.  
It is almost exactly that of Aerron\'s design below, but only one rather
minor difference.
Instead of using a spacedock, I used a vehicle bay for the air raft.  I
was able to squeeze in an extra manuever module.  The difference in
acceleration is minimal.  Also Aerron has an extra .5 tons of cargo in his
bay.  This difference could be explained like the different models of cars
we have today. ;-)

I dont have GT handy, could someone add up the "Ship Patron" points for
this one?
I think this would be a good PC ship.

        Thank-you.  You just cemented my whole problem with the Canon
arrangement right there...  How did they *get* to be Megacorps, if they only
things capable of "ignoring" the problems of operating on this scale *are*
megacorps?
        How brutally Darwinian is it?  At what TL, and thus jump and thus
comms rate, can you "grow" a Megacorp?
        Once you have the resources of a Megacorp to draw on, yes, only
Collosal bad luck or missmanagement will kill you.  In the meantime.....
And once the first Megacorp climbed the evolutionary ladder, why didn\'t it
EAT everything else threatening to become a Megacorp?
        Follow me now?  Or am I still missing something here?
>>>>
An interesting correlation might be the growth of the automobile
manufacturers.  when they (cars) were new, there were a bunch of
manufacturers.  There were dozens in the US, and quite a number in the
UK and Europe.  At this early stage, cars were modifications of
existing technology (truely horseless carriages), and could be made by
practically anyone who knew how to make carriages.  As technology
changed and they went from being horseless carriages to I.C.E.
automobiles, the skill set needed to create them changed and
drastically reduced the number of people who could undertake the task.
 Then when Ford rationalized (from the mechanical point of view
anyway) the production process, the amount of capital involved in
setting up a car plant grew enormously to the point where a lot of the
smaller companies were eaten by the bigger (more stable) companies. 
We ended up with a handful of worldwide "megacorps" who build cars. 
Now we have Ford and GM in the US, who also have massive presence in
Europe and lesser influence in other parts of the world.  We have
Daimler-Chrysler (I think that\'s the name they settled on) who is a
major presence in the US and Europe, and a fair amount of penetration
in the rest of the world (ex:  almost all the taxis in Israel seem to
have the Mercedes badge on them).  Toyota and Nissan of Japan are huge
in Japan (of course) and common in most of the world.  These first
examples would be the equivalent of "megacorp" status.  The next step
down has firms such as Hyundai, Daewoo, Fiat, and Zil who are dominant
in their home countries, but less common elsewhere.  These would be
equivalent to sector-wide companies.  On a third level are smaller
manufacturers who have more niche products like Lamborghini, Ferarri,
and Zastava (makers of the Yugo).  These would be equivalent to
subsector or planetary companies.

    'subj' => 'Courier route efficiency (long and probably rambling)',
    'from' => 'Walter Smith SmithW@HARTWICK.EDU',
    'body' => 'I was thinking on courier routes, and whether the length of a mail route
would increase average efficiency or decrease it.

Especially relevant was the irregularity of jump space exit. Even
assuming no misjumps (a reasonable assumption for most regular
merchant traffic), a courier that left seven days ago can still arrive
yesterday or tomorrow (or an even wider span, but these would be
most common).

If the courier route is run by a single ship, making each jump as fast
as possible (say a Mora to Core "War is declared" dispatch boat),
these time differences will tend to average out, and could probably
be ignored. This would even be the case if speed of message from
one end of the run to the other were most significant, as the next
boat could leave within minutes of the previous boat arriving - again,
the time differences would tend to average out.

When you deal with communication nexi and hubs, things start to get
complicated. Now speed of message from end-to-end of route may
not be as significant as maintenance of service on the route.
The courier from Regina may have shown up a day early, but your
courier to Mora can\'t leave until the courier from Rhylanor shows up - 
otherwise instead of everyone waiting a day for their mail, the mail
from Rhylanor will be a week (depending on the frequency of the service)
late. Fast boats can\'t speed up mail that\'s sitting in a port because it
missed the courier, therefore you may have a situation where all legs
of the mail network move at the speed of each slowest part - and the
inefficiencies will be additive (or even multiplicative).

The solution, of course, is to define a level of service and populate the
route with sufficient craft to maintain it, even if some of the craft are
late (or lost, or failed, or misjumped). The level of service needs to be
frequent enough that mail missing one courier can leave on the next one
without undue delay - daily seems to be a good estimate, as I would
say the arrival time variations would make hourly couriers less useful.

So, as a bare minimum - assuming no ships out of service, and no
ships gone a-missing - you will require seven courier ships for every
route leading out from each mail stop. Add three ships to ensure
reliability of service, we\'re up to ten. A courier can, at best, be in service
96% of the time - the other 4% of the time it\'s in annual maintenance,
but our three ship overage should be enought to handle that. 

But we\'re also assuming that both ends of the link (or at least one of
them) can do the annual maintenance on-site. If that isn\'t possible -
say the next stop spinward of you is a class-C stopover to a high-pop
world ten parsecs away - then service on each craft will take twice (or
more) as long, since the craft has to jump a week away and a week 
back in addition to the two weeks maintenance. We drop from a best-
estimate in-service of 96% down to 92% - or worse. That\'s enough
to add one, more likely two ships to the per-link requriements, and
remember that replacement ships need annual maintenance too.

It\'s possible that careful routing of couriers could allow each vessel to
be in a class A or B starport when it needs maintenance. It is more likely
that the best routing will place the courier where it can get maintenance
before it truly needs it - say at 48 weeks instead of 52 weeks, or even
40 weeks. Taking a courier out of service too frequently for maintenance
will cost more, but even the worst case (maintained every 40 weeks 
instead of every 52) you would still be getting a 95% in-service percentage.
This assumes that too-frequent maintenance isn\'t harmful, which is
probably the case - though I do know of real world(tm) items that you
can wear out prematurely with too-frequent maintenance.

This kind of routing will prevent you from implementing a TMLer\'s 
suggestion (Ian\'s?) that you place different craft on each leg, with
exactly the jump drives for their route. It may be hard to optimize
routing for j-3, j-4, j-5 and j-6 craft to allow them to only jump the
routes they were made for, visit a repair port yearly, and not end up
all parked at the far end of a mail leg. 

So, the setup costs of any optimized mail system will equal the
cost of setting up a mail station* on each world, plus 24 couriers** per
world-to-world link in the system (12 each way). If you can send mail in
six directions from Rhylanor, Rhylanor will have 72 couriers assigned
to itself and 72 couriers assigned to jump towards Rhylanor.

* mail station: At minimum a commo station, business office and
access to local repair and maintenance yards. Tankers will probably
be a necessary expense (such as the CT X-Boat tender). If you are
underconfident about local starport facilities or defenses, you may
have to bring your own (drastically increasing the costs).

** courier: What kind? Optimized for the leg they are assiged to, or
one-size fits all to take advantage of volume discounts? Type-S
Scout/Couriers for the jump-2 or less legs, or (if your system allows
it) some kind of sub-100tn X-Boat? Courier (independent starship)
or X-Boat (maneuverless message tube)? What kind of courier, and the
cost, will be heavily design-rules dependent. I would like to note that
Couriers that can land themselves may be able to remove many of
your mail station expenses (from above), at a possible (depending on
your rules system) cost in time. If a round trip takes me 18 days instead
of 14 days (2 days each end to land and take off), it will take fourteen
ships to maintain service one-way instead of twelve - and the cost
difference between an orbital refueling facility and two to four Couriers
would be significant. That would assume the cost of building these
facilities was significant - they may already exist for other purposes,
or system efficiency may be more important to the design than cost.

If system efficiency was the determining factor, I could see some class
C (or even worse) starports seeing a major upgrade when the mail system
comes through - akin to USA midwestern and western towns lucky
enough to be selected for early rail service in the 1800\'s.

Such a benefit to a system would be valuable enough to make the locals
very interested in the decision-making process, which world gets to be
a hub and which gets to be a backwater side-route. Interested enough
that some of them will do scenario-generating things - bribery,
negotiations, campaigning, information-gathering, etc...all kinds of things
for PC\'s to get involved with. <G>

Dragging it back to Trav, here\'s where those gazillions of credits the
IN has at it\'s disposal can be spent without putting an SDB behind every
asteroid throughout known space...Unlike the super-effecient rational
naval force that everyone is postulating it to be, they dump the money
on large showy ships unsuited to the duties they need to be put to.

Possibly.  This would never hapen naturally, but then you\'re not talking
about a natural occurrence either.  If the stellar core were somehow left
cold, dark, and slow-rotating, then more than likely there wouldn\'t be
anything to illuminate the nebulosity except nearby stars.

According to my copy of Burnham\'s, the Crab has an apparent age of about
900 years and is about 6 light-years in diameter.  The Veil Nebula is much
older, maybe 20,000 years old.  It forms the visible segments of the so-called
"Cygnus Loop," which may be about 70 light-years in diameter.  That should
give you some idea of what sizes are reasonable. . .

Well, it\'s hard to pin a TL on some of these devices, since they are by
definition, Non-Traveller.

There are alternate maneuver and sub-light drives, such as:
 Solar Sails (just about any TL, we could probably make one now if we
wanted)

Bussard ramjets (move a big magnetic scoop through space very fast and
you\'ll pull in enough hydrogen to sustain a fusion reaction, producing
thrust and power for the scoop. TL-9-ish)

exotic things like the Dadelus drive (drop tiny pellets of deuterium
into a big nozzle, hit them with lasers to cause a tiny fusion
explosion, which pushed you forward. First postulated in the 60\'s or
70\'s by the British Interplanetary Society <?>. TL-8-9-ish.) 
Spindizzies, as in James Blish\'s series Cities in Flight. Reactionless
drives that convert rotary torque into vectored thrust.
Electromechanical antigrav. TL-???

FTL drives limited to gates, pretty much. 

Stationary Jumpgates. Sort of like Stargates, or the things in  C.J.
Cherryh\'s Well of Shiuan, and the rest of the series. Gates are large
and stationary, and you move from one to the next. The far end has to be
placed there by STL or other forms of FTL drive.

Yaskodray allegedly has invented things like this, AKA jump disks, sort
of like the jump disks in Niven\'s known space series. TL-21+

That\'s alll I remember offhand from FFS1

I would *not* want to live ona planet with;
9,970 Pregnant Women
9,970 newborn infants and only 10,000 caretakers.

On the other hand, the idea of having sex with 9,970 different women in one
year is...not terribly unappealing.

Surplus but not used; these are F-16s that Pakistan paid for many years

Well, they did do a post holocost movie with that general plot.  It was NOT
pleasant for the sperm donors.  They were milked and artificially inceminated
the women. They weren\'t even SECOND class citizens, more like third or
fourth... The baby factories aren\'t much better... your child is taken away at
birth so that you stop lactating faster and thus are ready for the next
incemination.  Then half way through your pregnancy they\'ll discover its male
and abort and you have to do it all over again... for 20 years... and then you
become a caretaker.  Of course, about 75% of the baby factories can contribute
to the work force at any one time (they get taken out for the third trimester).

After 600 years like that, I\'d hate to even visit that planet.  Even after a
hundred would be scary.

A supernova leaves behind an expanding cloud of gas that could be

Supernova remnants actually have not a white dwarf but a neutron star
in their center. I\'m not sure what fraction of the brightness of the
remnant is due to the neutron star and what is due to shock heating of the 
expanding shell as it pushes the local interstellar medium out of the way;
more the latter, I think.

For a moderately massive star this might actually produce a supernova. That\'s
what causes supernova - the core runs out of nuclear fuel, nuclear 
reactions cease, the whole star collapses inwards, the innermost core forms
a neutron star and the outer layers sort of "bounce" off from the neutron
star with explosive force. (Possibly the energy transport isn\'t really the
"bounce" but neutrinoes coming out of the core, but that\'s a detail.)

Incidentally, any guesses on the power of a nuclear damper (or accelerator)
required to generate nova-level flares (like the Darrian star-trigger)?  And
how long it would need to be in operation to generate this result?

GT had an explanation for the startrigger involving meson beams, tungsten, and
other mumbo-jumbo, but I\'m ignoring that because it didn\'t make any sense ;).

This is going to sound like a clich\', but I always viewed the Aslan as havingsome

This is closer to what I was working on when the thread died inmy last campaign.
It was a twisted path too. It started with a
virus controlled terraforming project that uncovered a ancient
site. I was going to end it somwhere in the great rift on a STL
transport.

I mostly agreed with your post Bruce.  However, I think that you will
have people making money on the hourly trades in the OTU.  However, it
would be on the local companies that are trading and not necessarily on
the Mega- Sector- SubSector- corporations.  There will be some of that
too though, I am sure.

I think there will be companies that are traded on some limited number
of worlds....  Would there be worlds that are "stock market" worlds? 
That that is their primary service?  I could see the major companies
being traded on such markets but not on others....  Or that there are
classes of shares...  One share of Berkshire Hathaway will grow to how
much by the time of 5600 maybe?

In Julian May\'s Pleocene (Sp?) Exiles series she had a race of beings that
basicly founded the Concordium.  These beings were rumored to have refueled
their own star and existed as a race of almost pure mental energy.
Remillard refers to one of the main antagonists, Marc Remillard.  He was
also known as Abbadon or the Adversary.

SPOILER WARNING.....



















In the books, four of them detailing events 6 Million BC and three
detailing events late 20th and 21st centuries, a significant portion of the
known universe is psionicly active.  The Lylmik formed the "Unity" which is
similar to a psychic internet.  Marc led the Human rebels against the Unity
and almost succeded if not for the intervention of several of his family
members.  Easily the most powerful of all human operants, he and his forces
fled to the past through a one-way time gate.  When they arrived they found
that a group of humanlike alien exiles had already settled parts of Europe.
 These aliens were latent psychics.

To make a long story short, Marc and one other human made the jump to the
alien\'s homeworld to help guide them into full operancy.  In a way, the
devil of the abyss became a hero.

In the second series, the ones detailing the next hundred years or so, you
learn the origin of the Lylmik and the true identity of Atoning Unifex.

I highly reccomend the books.

Ferrari is part of FIAT.
Lamborghini is part of another group (can\'t remember who).

BMW/(Land) Rover would be an example of a sector corp with mega aspirations.

Pisst! Want to see some photos? See those rumoured BITS products at:

http://www.bits.org.uk/

It shows the range of products that are out there in the CORE sectors. I
anticipate that a small freetrader may get supplies to those of you in the
wilds sometime soon. ;-)

.ZIP because Mac owners with Excel 98 can open the file then, whereas they
can\'t open a EXE.

And I couldn\'t download an EXE and extract it through the firewall at work,
whereas I can download a ZIP and extract it.

ZIP files are relatively cross-platform. Self-extracting files are not. So
I\'d vote plain ZIP.

I have been giving this a lot of thought, as I want to add it to my game.

what about a stock center at each sector captial and the rules of buying
and selling are that each Mega corp sends a certain percentage of stock to
each stock center. 
I.E. Astroburgers sends to Regina 1% (Lets say 300 shares, and the stock
alphanumeric for astroburger is ASB1, but each set of shares has it\'s
sector name attached, ASB1Regina.) of it\'s for sale stock and tracking
purpose and to another sector goes 1% etc etc and only that amount of stock
is available for purchase The price per share is set by the stock
commission at the time of departure by the xboat. And after it\'s purchased
in the sector it was sent to, it remains there until the parent corperation
pulls out by buying up all shares or the stock commission declares it no
longer viable. 
Stock could only be sold for the first 24-48 hours after the arrival of the
xboat (depending on frequence of xboats) to prevent someone learning about
a dip of increase in stock at home sector and racing off with their jump
millions boat to make a killing.
there would have to be rules on transfering title/ownership between
sectors. If it would be allowed. 

so a person that travels around alot could have stock certs that look like
this

stock		shares		current value
ASB1Regina  	12 shares	27 as of 1121
ASB1Trunsdel  200 shares	32 as of 1122
LMM2Regina 	50 shares	30.3/4 as of 1122

and in order to sell they would have to know the price of share at that
days xboat delivery.

because of the distance/time in traveller the players/owners would have
different stock values of the same stock and they would have to live with
it. They could be at trunsdel and learn their stock is worth 32 per share
but their regina stock is still worth 27 a share because that stock is
registered at regina and regina may or may not have had the update yet. So
selling stock would become a long drawn out time consumeing process.

let me know what you think. I do realize I have almost no knowledge of
stocks and am make this up as I go based on what I have heard. So bear with
me please.
thanks

It would be better to say that, since a governement built Express
Postal Service (the X-boat network) already exists and meets most
the needs, it may well be that nobody want to spend the money
needed to have a 33% quicker, but otherwise redundant, network.

Again, the point that someone can "afford" it shows nothing.  Weither
their is enough news that can wait a certain amount of time, but
looses significant money if it wait 33% longer, is debatable.

The supplements (such as Behind the Claw and Aliens Vol 1.)
are useful for any game system.  BTC has very little in the
way fo game mechanics.  Aliens has only the racial packages
themselves.

GURPS Traveller has (as one would expect) a lot of GURPS
specific rules.  Things it has that are of general interest
are the description of the setting (maybe a 1/3 of the book)
and perhaps the modular ship design rules (You will need
to convert weapon stats to your own use and would need
Vehicles if you wanted to expand it).

Only to the degree that you can\'t do something it you
can\'t afford it at all.  Otherwise, it says nothing
about the likelihood of the project.  Unless they
think they are going to get a return for that money,
they aren\'t going to be more likely to spend money on
it because it is a small portion of the budget.

If I am at a board meeting and I can\'t show any return on
a project, the arguement that it is only 1% (or 0.01%)
of the budget won\'t do me much good.

The Tigress, for example - in High Guard terms this was a massively
overpriced ship, only marginally more combat effective than the 200,000 ton
battleships and arguably less combat effective than a 90,000 ton battlerider
(which is harder to hit.) Some of these are High Guard artificats, but one coulcd
imagine in general lots of political pressures in favour of big flag-showing
battleships.


Or special projects like Longbow - a dedicated tracker-only science-grade
PEMS-17 sensor array costs TCr 375, a big black budget item.

  Striker had them as launch rails (mass = mass of carried issile), and you
could use them to carry SS3-designed rounds - anything that has a specified
mass, I guess, including Striker or B:8 designed probes, drone missiles, etc.

  IIRC, one JTAS had suggested Striker stats for Ramparts, and there were
missiles involved, though whether they were on the Ramparts I don\'t recall.

You\'re absolutely right, Greg. On a single planet local stocks will sell
at any pace that technology allows.

Yeah, how do you buy, for instance, 100 shares of Tukera? Perhaps you
buy either local shares only, _or_ you buy into a mutual fund model,
where trading is done on the local level on behalf of the fund, which
may be administered on the subsector or sector level. Still it implies
an almost complete independence on the part of local fund managers. 

(Trav plot: Now what was the name of that currency trader who caused
that bank in England to fail?...;-)

While local markets may trade on any time basis their technology allows,
multi-world trading will of necessity have to take a different pace.
Perhaps stocks are traded in a central multi-world market on specific
dates, with some central date-time stamp on the orders to buy and
sell..ie: if the buy order gets to Mora by day 91 of the year, it\'s
executed on the first quarter trading day. All trading takes place on
that day, so stocks rise and fall at specific intervals during the year.

This places a premium on that J-6 courier service, as moving trading
orders is a natural use of high speed communications. It also makes for
opportunities for PC\'s...on off-X-boat worlds, they might be asked to
jump TODAY so as to get a trade order onto the xboat network by some
cut-off date.

This makes multi-world markets possible, but more and more limited as
the size (and commo lag) grows. I suspect MegaCorp capitalization, like
everything else in the Imperium is decentralized almost completely.

It should be.  Consider it this way:

Assume you are available for sex 16 hours a day, 365 days a year.
(This leaves 8 hrs/day to squeeze in sleep, meals, and biological
necesseties.)  This means you have sex with 28 women per day, (I\'m
rounding up so none of the women will be missed) over a 16 hour
period.  That\'s 1 woman every 34 minutes and 29 seconds.

Now, I enjoy sex as much as the next guy (and maybe more), but you\'d
have to be SUPERMAN to keep it up like that!  I foresee endless
supplies of Viagra, lubricant, and Novicane in your future. :^)

(FYI, considering that it takes human sperm about 5 days to develop
to the point of being viable for conception, you\'d be performing most
of that "work" purely for the act itself.  After the first half dozen
partners, you\'d be producing nothing capable of fertilizing an egg.)

Interesting problem, however. :^)

  This is the model I used behind the JumpExpress courier designs (HG);
they could provide _parcel_ service from Glisten to Regina in the time
required for ten jumps plus L-Hyd replenishment and SOP drive checks, or
16 hours per HG (minimum recommended under any non-combat circumstances
is one hour, ibid). If necessary, most of these designs could carry an
in-board engineer rather than have the pilot do both, but that seems
more than a little bit over the top.

  IAC, the handling required for packages is going to be an issue for
all couriers including X-Boats; while storage density is assumed to be
high enough for our purposes IIRC it\'s been pointed out that information
density in commo transmissions is limited by physical constants - thus,
even the regular X-mails will require onloading of low priority bulk media.

  As previously specified, all of the figures I\'ve been working with are
weekly courier lines with switch-overs between vessels (and vessel types)
reduced to an absolute minimum as dictated to Operations by Accounting.

  This starts to add up pretty quickly, so if this is a daily mail system
it\'s either an upgrade or complete replacement of the X-Boat system in the
coverage area. If this is J-5/6 then express couriers will not be able to
function on these routes, and will be reduced to the status of dispatch
boats at major centers, available to go off-route ASAP (at huge fees).

  YMMV, but in many TU\'s the ref may read one year as "52-weeks plus/minus".
Seeings as it\'s largely unclear what annual maintenance does to a Trader for 
KCr 55 (over two weeks?!) it could simply be done over the course of a year
in week or 3-4 day installments. If delaying until week 54 is neither rabidly
illegal nor suicidal then the problem may be reduced there as well.

  This can work better if you add 24-36 hours to the ship/ship-type switch-
overs. The real killer under HG is using J-6 where you don\'t have to as the
ship costs an 40% extra or so. In the JumpExpress/Al Morai examples (11/30)
the J-6 ships running the Glisten-Trin-Mora runs are making four jumps per
leg and visiting three TL F worlds with Al Morai facilities in place. Using
this extra ship-type is necessary for efficiency for these links, and only
requires <36 hours added at the Mora nexus with the Type F-5\'s.

  The X-Boat system may very well be established at something like this
strength, but a parcel-type courier system could get by with far fewer -
a few dozen for most of the Marches business traffic, as indicated.

  Many organizations will already have all this - specifically sector
or state wide lines (in the Marches, Al Morai is an excellent example).

Ok, there\'s the first problem.  Hull-mounted weapons count against your
hardpoint limit -- small craft are limited to 3 hull-mounted weapons or one
turret, but cannot have both, or a combination.  Aside from that the numbers
look ok, though I didn\'t do any major checking on it.

	I realize that once a ship has been built, it\'s spinal mount cannot be
changed (or made larger; not sure about smaller).  However, what about ships
that never had a spinal mount installed when built?  You could not put one in
later...but since bays are no longer limited to just 50 and 100 tons, why
can\'t you put a spinal-mount sized weapon in a custom designed bay?  This
gives low-tech ships a chance of possibly being given a form of SLEP to keep
it competitive (at least somewhat) as opposed to building a whole new class of
vessels.

	Is this possible and legit, or is it simply pure rules-lawyering?

  If the % is too high, then the project is less likely to be approved.
If it\'s quite low and still likely profitable, then it\'s at least going
to be considered. Cheap enough, and it may be discretionary for a manager
somewhere (like linking two good markets 5-6 parsecs apart with a ship
every two-three days or something; this might be a sector heads choice,
allowing for H.O. oversight.

  Correct me if I\'m wrong, but at this point the basis of the profitability
discussion with you is that "you don\'t agree"?

As long as each run is designed as endpoint to endpoint, with pickup
cargos in between, that will be the case - if getting something from
Mora to Efate is the major objective, and it doesn\'t matter if you happen
to miss the connection with the line heading for Lunion, then you will be
33% (or even up to 100%!!) faster than the X-Boat system. Once you
start adding any complications to the route - branches or hubs - there
will be inefficiencies in the system that will hinder your effectiveness.
It doesn\'t matter to me how fast your courier is, if it leaves for two weeks 
right before my most important piece of cargo shows up at your 
shipping office.

Either you add more boats - in effect duplicating the effort of the X-Boat
system, just with longer legged craft - or you find your overall effectiveness
eroded, to the point where jump-4 X-Boat traffic will be almost as fast.
Some of your priority cargos will be much faster, some others will
languish in your port facilities for weeks until the next courier shows up.

"Excuse me, sir.  You said you want to place a "Sell" order for 100
shares of Tukera A?  You mean Class A stock?  At Cr 1,230,000? Do you
have the shares here?  Oh, you want to sell them short?  Right." 

Lots of opportunity for graft in the mutual fund picture.  Maybe shares
trading on a certain market like another poster mentioned.  I\'ll have to
think about it more.

Good idea on this.  Trades take place on certain dates, much like
options expiring currently.  So your shares gain or lose value
"officially" based on quarterly executions of buy and sell orders.  But
this opens up a secondary market of trading the stock that you hold
(either in "street name" or actual certificates) for whatever price you
can get locally.  And then the shares may be registered to the new owner
by the ISEC.

Or to get a cancellation order to a specific High Jump courier *after*
the official x-boat has left in order to counteract the sell order you
just sent 4 days ago (since the TNS has just reported that
breakthrough....)

Kind of like "Trading Places" where they need to get the Orange
Concentrate Futures report before its public....

Right.  And in operations of the MegaCorps, one of the articles
mentioned that they often are working at cross purposes to other
divisions within the same corporation...

All kinds of possibilities!

To boil it down. No side of this argument have come up with numbers that
show profit or loss. You, Hanke and Ian claim that profitt is likely (without
much numbers to support you :-). David (and I) claim that there loss is likely
(without much numbers to support us). Its a stalemate that rests soley on the 
IMTU argument.

So could we please stop this tread since it is on the verge of coming to
virtual blows. Our views of the Traveller universe is simply to different
and therefor not giving us a common platform to discuss on.

never played with the traveller virus, although some players in my
mechwarrior game read about the virus fleets and decided to try to slip it
into my game as a means to override enemie ships, unfortunalty for them I
too had read about the virus stuff and worked it into my campiegn as we
ended the game they were desperatly trying to recover the stolen harddrive
that contained stage three of the virus program before it could be entered
into the Comstar mainframe..(They knew that the inner sphere would be
defenseless if the virus was transmitted, the clans were due to invade in
less then a year.) it was fun for me and took the game in a compleatly new
direction. (hope you know what I am talking about sorry about the digression)

shoot that was almost 20 years ago that I played adventure one, I am lucky
to have remembered that., it was only 1250 ton? I thought it was
bigger...ofcourse when all you got is a 200ton scout everything is aLOT
bigger .  oh well

IMO, the benefit of a fully-realized X-Boat system will be it\'s reliability.
If you go to an IISS communications office with a message,
you know that it will leave within time X (day, two days, every Thursday,
whatever) and that they will get it to point Y by time Z almost every time
you try. A smaller system - like the express mail couriers we\'ve been 
mentioning - will end up trading speed for reliability or availablity in most
cases, unless they get as many ships as the X-Boats use.

Yes, it only takes a jump-5 courier two jumps to make the Mora/Rhylanor
run. You\'ve just dispatched it with the quarterly reports, and just as it
vanishes into jump space your assistant hands you a report of new
Naval contracts. Now you get to sit on this time-sensitive data until
your courier returns four weeks from now - or until it\'s sister ship, 
running the opposite way, returns two weeks hence.

If you have one courier making the run, put the data in an X-Boat
message right now - the four week wait for your courier to get back,
plus the two week transit will be slower than the jump-4 X-boat network.
(I figure j-4 X-Boats can follow their way stations and make Mora/Rhylanor
in five weeks, though it would take longer if no boats were doing
J-4 waystation to waystation when possible - some links on the route
are only j-1 apart.)

If you have two couriers on the route, your KCr-ish investment in a
private J-5 run might save you a week - if neither of your couriers is
nursing a busted Jump Gizmo at the halfway point. The X-Boats have
enough ships not to worry about that, either.

So, best case your private courier run saves you three weeks - a lifetime
for time-sensitive business data. Worst case, your data never arrives
and it takes you six months to find out for sure. You only get the "best 
case" if you\'re keeping one of these ships in reserve for that special 
message. How does your traffic travel if you don\'t want to send away your 
courier just yet? By X-Boat...<G>

These kinds of policy are hard to maintain.  They face a lot of

But with the timelags we are talking about here, there is no way to verify the
info without loosing the advantage you had. So your left with acting on
uncertain information that on top of this might not even be true when it
arraives, even if it was true when it was sent. 

This indicate to me that a very small portion of info will be useful for
this type of setup. At least not enough to justify a hole network of
couriers. I\'m not even convienced that the X-boat network is a viable
and profitabel endevour. 

>Walt Smith

And I\'m still tending towards my view that stock markets will not be
a very good way of doing business in the future. My view is that it
will be more family run businesses, were the ownership is handed down
from father/mother to son/daughter.

This might be because I don\'t know enough about the stock market and its
advanteges. What is so benfical about it?

This might work, but I don\'t think it very likely.  The vast majority of
stock owners will not be "Travellers" anyway, though I\'d bet a high
proportion of Travellers would be stock holders.  And then we are only
talking about a few MegaCorps anyway (15-20 all told).  I think MegaCorp
stock would be thinly traded, very expensive, inherited.  It is mostly
held by nobles and holding companies IIRC.  Most shares traded on a
specific world would be world specific shares, IMO.  There would
probably be rules about what can be traded on what market.  But that
doesn\'t limit secondary markets for securities.

I think SubSector and Sector companies might have a system like this, or
the one Bruce mentioned having trading on a Quarterly [maybe even
monthly or weekly] basis.  Tying something to the arrival of xboats I
don\'t think would be too workable as the x-boat may never show, or may
be delayed...  But it could be interesting to have the exchanges execute
all orders on a certain date.  I could see a fund manager having a fast
ship standing by J-6 away in order to take any "unknown" late breaking
news a J-6 in to beat the market close and make the killing.  Would this
happen often?  No, but only once might make the expense justifiable.

Ah, but there is money to be made by having information or selling it
beyond where the official news has reached.  Time is money, even moreso
in a timelag environment.

Not a good idea from my perspective as a shareholder, but certainly
doable IYTU.  Then again, it could work this way in the primary market,
but there would be a secondary market for those "out of sector" shares,
particularly if you were heading that way.  You might be able to
purchase stocks cheaper here because it would cost a lot to take them
there to trade them, but then, if you are going that way, who cares?

I guess you would really have to have a buy and hold strategy, wouldn\'t
you?

Well, if someone else alleges something, it is up to them to
support it.  Also, I have never claimed that they were uneconomic.
I claimed that the existance of a jump-6 X-boat like network
is hardly automatic based on the setting.

>Which will be the best system ?

There really is not answer to this.  I prefer GURPS but athat
has to do with perferences and play styles (I don\'t like
the variable number of dice mechanics).  Both are perfectly
usuable sets of mechanics (assuming T5 is pretty much like
it is expected to be).

Then there is the question of the setting.  If you like the
CT/non-rebellion/non-Virus setting vs looking at whatever
setting T5 decides to use.  (though, to at least some
degree there is not reason you can mix and match).

I thought it was at least a year off, but I\'m not sure.

  Yup, possible, but you would need a reaction that actually supports the
inner region in place of the now absent photon pressure. Otherwise the
core most certainly collapses. (What such a mechanism would be I cannot
fathom, but hey we\'re talking TL-20+ sutt here, right.)
 Thinking further I realise that with smaller stars this might just result
in nuclear fusion restarting after the star has sunk some (and blown its
outer region to space). With more massive stars, possibly even haevier
main sequence ones, the result would be a neutron star or a blck hole as I
stated earlier. Don\'t know about actual threshold masses as I don\'t have
my stellar dynamics lecture notes handy (and more experinced astronomers 
around here can probably do the math faster anyway).

  As far as I could tell from the SN1987A results the shock heating
radiation would mostly seem to be in radio and X-ray regions. The visible
light glow is mostly due to excitation by the central superdense object,
methinks. (The existence of a neutron star has apparently been confirmed
in the case of SN1987A.)

        Hi, Ian!
        Yeah, good point, but the whole Traveller combat system is based on
onion-peeling odds.  You build a PAWs, I add armor.  You build nuclear
weapons, I build Dampers.  You build meson guns, I build meson screens.  You
build K-Kill weapons, I build repulsors.  You use lasers & energy, I deploy
sand and armor.
        So, based on that logic, we should never wind up fighting, because
there is no point in putting weapons on our ships, because the defenses we
mount are cheaper than the cost of the weapons.  Now, I admit I am be
facitous (sp) but you see what I mean.
        Also, keep in mind, that it is an economics issue...  if you have
"x" batteries of defenses, I need "x+1/odds of hitting" to overwhelm your
defenses and frag it.  The bottom line is after I have fired my "n" missiles
at you and actually immolated your ship, is that cheaper than what it cost
you to buy your ship?  If yes, I win.  If no, you win.
        I\'ll spare you the repost, but even with 100Mcr missiles, I think I
illustrated that someone could kill a dreadnuaght cheaper than it could be
built.  That is the underlying issue of missile warfare in the
RealWorld(tm), is that its not how many that get stopped its the one that
doesn\'t that is cheaper than the asset it was aimed at.
        However, this does monsterously shift the balance of the game from
"Ironclads in Space" to "Carrier War 1999".  It also means that star-systems
can clobber at will *almost* anything within 3 light-seconds of the main
world using silo-launched weapons...  Sort of like in the Spanish Main where
a ship vs a fort was a non-guess outcome.
        It depends, I guess on your POV of warfare economics and how much
you dislike "straying" from canon.  IYTU YMMV =).

  You seem to have forgotten stutterwarp (as in 2300AD) and subpace drive.

 Stutterwarp: This functions by tunneling the ship forward a few hundred
meters at a time in very rapid succession (hundreds of times a second)
resulting in apparent FTL speeds.
 Suggested statistics from FF&S1 are volume=2+(5 x SQR(driveMW)),
price=volumex0.3 (Mcr), speed(LY/day)=Tlm x (MW/10D)^1/3,  D=ship
displacement, Tlm=driveTL+4. 2300AD director\'s guide has more info on
stutterwarp.

  Subspace drive: This works by transporting the ship to an alternate
dimension where distaces are much shorter, and continually propelling it
forward.(Subspace appears to be a resisting medium.) If the drive fails,
you either a) reappear in N-space in a corresponding location, or b)
diappear forever (take your pick). This is sorta like the drives in B5.
(Could also be thought of as a supertech refinement of jump drive. IMTU
the primordials used subspace drives to zog off fom the milky way galaxy
to parts unknown...)
 Rough suggestions for stats are V(pc/hr)= ((MW/D) x eff factor) x 0.1,
efficiency factor varies from 0.6 at TL-9 to 1.1 at TL-20+, volume varies
from MW x 0.5 to MW x 0.04 TL-9 to TL-20+, rpice is vol x 0.25 (Mcr).

 As you can see, stats are given right from TL-9, but the actual TL might
be anything if you decide to use these at all, since this is _alternative_
tech.

 There is also mention of the ever lovable Tachyon band FTL communicators
in FF&S1, and IIRC the Challenge aricle about Project Farstar has some
vague rumours about alien ships using something called a tachyon drive.

"European Astronomers Discover Nearby Extrasolar Planet
"A team of European astronomers, using a new telescope dedicated to 
extrasolar planet searches, has discovered a planet orbiting a nearby 
double star system, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) announced 
Tuesday, November 24.
"The planet was discovered around Gliese 86, a star system 35 light-years 
from the Earth.  The planet orbits in a nearly-circular orbit about 0.11 
astronomical units (16.5 million km, 10.2 million miles) from the star. 
 Astronomers estimate the planet\'s mass to be at least 4.9 times that of 
Jupiter, our solar system\'s heaviest planet.  The planet\'s surface 
temperature would be about 380 degrees C (715 degrees F).
"The main star is about 80% as massive and 40% as bright as the Sun. 
 Previous observations of Gliese 86 show that it is a binary star, with an 
unseen companion inferred to exist by spectroscopic analysis at least 10 AU

away.  The discovery of a planet in a binary system like Gliese 86 may 
provide new data on the stability of planets in such star systems.
"The new extrasolar planet is the second-closest to our solar system.  In 
June astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler announced the discovery of 
a star around Gliese 876, only 15 light-years from the Earth.
"The discovery was made by a team of Swiss astronomers that includes Michel

Mayor and Didier Queloz, who discovered the first extrasolar planet around 
a Sun-like star in October 1995, when they found a planet orbiting 51 
Pegasi.
"The astronomers used a new telescope, the 1.2-meter (47-inch) Leonhard 
Euler telescope, located at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, 
Chile. The telescope, along with a high-resolution spectrograph, will be 
used primarily to search for extrasolar planets."

 AFAIK the rate or type of nuclear factions has nothing to do with flaring
or even superflaring. (Let\'s get one thing straight, the Darrian sun did
_not_ go nova, not even close...I mean Daryen still has a biosphere,
right?)
  From what I can remember from my solar system physics course, the
flaring is more connected with the immensely complex magnetic phenomena in
a star\'s outer region, so the star trigger could involve some nifty (not
to mention massive) magnetic/gravisonic manipulation. Ill dig up the
lecture notes when I get home, and see if I can whip up some nice sounding
pseudoscience here.

the point defense range, it dumped a dozen or more small missiles on

I figured the Terrans would adopt a weapon system similar to what they had

probably go with a mid-range value of 2d weeks per system, modified by any

   I just joined the TML.  Thought I\'d insert my own Cr0.02 here.
   The major problem that\'s been mentioned is preventing one individual =
from taking advantage of the difference in stock prices between one =
world and another.  So to prevent this the Imperium would have rules . . =
.

Rules for Stock Trading
   Each corporation\'s stock is only traded on one stock exchange (like =
NASDAQ) per system.  However, market forces are only allowed to change =
the stock\'s price in only one market (usually where the corporation\'s =
headquarters is located).  On all other worlds the local market sets the =
price of a stock based on its last word from the "home" market of that =
stock.  For example: Sternmetal\'s (symbol: STM) corporate headquarters =
is on . . .  let\'s say Efate (Spinward Marches/Regina), so this is where =
the stock is normally traded.  However Sternmetal also does business on =
Roup (one jump away) and its stock is traded there as well.  The price =
of STM is set by normal market forces in the Efate stock exchange, and =
can change minute by minute.  The price of STM on Roup only changes =
every time an X-Boat comes in and transmits the latest Efate price to =
the Roup stock exchange.  The price of STM remains unchanged until the =
next X-Boat from Efate updates the price again.
   Individuals and entities can still make private stock trades outside =
of a stock exchange.  The value of trades done over time should be no =
more than the minimum cost it would take to travel from wherever the =
transaction occurs to the home market\'s system.  A jump-4 ship (such as =
an X-Boat) could get from Efate to Roup in one jump.  If it costs that =
ship Cr1000 per jump then trades should be no larger than Cr1000 per =
week per person.

   Any holes in these rules?  Could someone still abuse this and make a =
killing?

This might work, but I don\'t think it very likely.  The vast majority of
stock owners will not be "Travellers" anyway, though I\'d bet a high
proportion of Travellers would be stock holders.  And then we are only
talking about a few MegaCorps anyway (15-20 all told).  I think MegaCorp
stock would be thinly traded, very expensive, inherited.  It is mostly
held by nobles and holding companies IIRC.  Most shares traded on a
specific world would be world specific shares, IMO.  There would
probably be rules about what can be traded on what market.  But that
doesn\'t limit secondary markets for securities.

I think SubSector and Sector companies might have a system like this, or
the one Bruce mentioned having trading on a Quarterly [maybe even
monthly or weekly] basis.  Tying something to the arrival of xboats I
don\'t think would be too workable as the x-boat may never show, or may
be delayed...  But it could be interesting to have the exchanges execute
all orders on a certain date.  I could see a fund manager having a fast
ship standing by J-6 away in order to take any "unknown" late breaking
news a J-6 in to beat the market close and make the killing.  Would this
happen often?  No, but only once might make the expense justifiable.

Ah, but there is money to be made by having information or selling it
beyond where the official news has reached.  Time is money, even moreso
in a timelag environment.

Not a good idea from my perspective as a shareholder, but certainly
doable IYTU.  Then again, it could work this way in the primary market,
but there would be a secondary market for those "out of sector" shares,
particularly if you were heading that way.  You might be able to
purchase stocks cheaper here because it would cost a lot to take them
there to trade them, but then, if you are going that way, who cares?

I guess you would really have to have a buy and hold strategy, wouldn\'t
you?

Thankfully, the warrior-monk Ricardos, with the support of the Imperial

Only if the dreadnaught isn\'t optimized for missile defence. If a 
MCr 1 0.1 ton missile can hit and kill your MCr 100 10-ton missile
every time, the dreadnaught can easily win by allocating a small 
fraction of its mass to defence.

And, in G:T, laser point defence against impact-type (including
direct nuclear) missiles is so good that small dedicated point
defence laser turrets can eat many times their weight in incoming
missiles, further tipping the balance. Basically, if ship-killing
nuclear or KKMs threaten to become common, ships should have dedicated
rapid-fire point defence lasers that will tip the balance back.
(Real-world analysis indicates that any laser is pretty much guaranteed
to hit a missile within a few thousand km with every shot, and G:T
or FFS lasers can have rates of fire of a pulse per second, so they\'re
very hard to overwhelm.) Missiles can be important - especially det-lasers
or KKMs vs overwhelmed/non-maneuvering targets - but they don\'t 
dominate.

  The complexities are a hassle, and for the cases I\'m making they would be
avoided by concentrating on high-grading the commo market - connect the Hi-
Pop, Hi-Tech worlds and call it a days work. The assumption I\'ve been working
with is weekly launches (although 8 day scheduling might work better), as
14 days between launches does badly cut into the short range J-5+ advantage.

  In a courier-per-week case you achieve parity from 9-12 parsecs along,
and win hands down beyond that (well, except 16, I guess :> ). IAC, there\'s
also the advantage that a courier/parcel service can work to cherry-pick
worlds along its\' long-distance routes, where a mail service might not be
able to do so; a J-5+ X-mail system might also still suffer from this.

  There is no basis whatsoever for a J-4 system being almost as fast as a
weekly J-5+ system over a distance of 20-100 or more parsecs - it wouldn\'t
even be close, even for a rationalized X-boat system using equally effective
routes.

  My mistake; I thought that the post "Economics of potential courier routes"
(NOV/30) was fairly clear in discussing the revenue requirements for a basic
system of the sort discussed; weekly launches of minimal (~100 Dt) (HG) ships
to link major markets, in this case Glisten-Trin-Mora-Rhylanor.

  These 34 _billion_ TL F Imperials need to generate a _maximum_ of Cr 800,000
(i.e., KCr 800) per launch from one of these four worlds to support the entire
courier system between them. That is, each of these worlds - highly productive
(and thus wealthy?) and with population of 10-20 _times_ that of the modern
industrial West has to generate that revenue to support the intermediary jumps
to the next such world.

  E.G., using the somewhat specious declaration that Londons "official mind"
in the later 19th C. was only a thousand or so decision makers, and multiplying
that by 10 (after all, Victorian England wasn\'t quite as economically active
as 8-10 billion TL F Impies might be) and we get the possible result that there
could be as many as 10,000 people who might have to subscribe at Cr 4,000 p.a.
to generate this revenue.

  Naturally such a possibility is absurd and overtly capitalist, and as such
should be consigned to the dust-bin of management history :\\

  Why would a courier leaving every 7.5-8 days not be as reliable?
Sure, they\'re only point-to-point (although messages could then be
handed off to the X-Boats to save some time) but within that limit
they operate under the same constraints as X-Boats. The customer
knows that the ship leaves on day X, and lives with it.

  This is an indication that a niche market may exist for short range
couriers, not that a weekly system isn\'t faster than the X-Boats. It
certainly doesn\'t address the fact that around MCr 500 would set up a
J-5 weekly courier between Mora & Rhylanor - would you care to report
how long the mapped X-Boats routes would take to do that run?

  OK - I didn\'t notice that :( - but there you go - with four couriers
running you get a minimum two week saving - and you can\'t find enough
customers in 16-odd billion warm bodies to cough up KCr 800 max. in 
fees for each launch off their world (or vice versa, FWIW)?

  The shorter the run the less advantage is derived from a small number
of couriers; two ships is basically building a deliberately broken
business. If properly maintained, and allowing for acts of gods (or the
GM, YMMV) then there\'s no reason that the system shouldn\'t be as reliable
as a run from Toronto to Frankfurt.

  For an extra Cr 3.0 I imagine they\'ll send a confirmation that the
message was received - you _never_ know if the intended recipient ever
read or understood it. If the couriers deal with the same physical
universe as the X-Boats then the worst case is a two week savings.

  You also pretty much get the best case one day per run period.

  Oh, while the terms of carriage might accept liabilty for malfeasance/

hijacking, mis-jumps or piracy aren\'t covered :)

Actually the Kinunir is at least vaguely OK for what it is:  a small,
self-escorting troop carrier.  Basically it\'s an upgrade of the good old
Merc Cruiser.  Another variation on the same theme is the good old Corsair,
with it\'s huge (for a "naval" ship of its size) hold.  Corsairs do actually
have legitimate uses...

In settings like TNE, or in very small navies, where ships are scarce, you
often need cargo and people hauling capability more than actual combat
capability.  Ships that can do that And fight, can\'t fight very well.

Capitalization, maybe.  Ownership, no.

It\'s pretty clear in M0 that the MegaCorps are "family businesses" of Noble
families and their supporters/factions.  They will use the joint-stock
company form, but I suspect will tend to attempt to retain control of the
various boards.

In MT, towards the end of the Rebellion, the Megacorps began consolidating
their assets in particular areas.  The Vilani megacorps and Tukera Lines
had begun the trend, and the others followed as interstellar trade
declined.  This suggests that several of them had core areas, where their
controlling shareholders were based.  (See Survival Margin, and maybe Hard
Times???)

Of course all of them will have had local subsidiaries, and some of these
would be very substantial businesses.  It\'s likely that these subsidiaries
could make up (err, am I in 1100 or 1200?) the majority of their
capitalised value, and that the "control" their key owners exercise is
through highly leveraged structures.

So, yes, Bruce is kind of right, but there are hard core controlling
interests, IMHO.

Hmm, I wonder if anyone can make sense of what I wrote?

IMHO, people have got fixated on the stock market model.  Think: Media.

Ok, so you own the Regina Post and I own the Regina News.  I get my news
reports two months before you do.  By the time you get it, it is worth
precisely nothing.  I make giga-bucks, you go out of business.

Volumes?  Enough, I suspect.  Sure, some of it is pretty tabloid, or
parochial, but our "Newspapers" are electronic and have search engines and
stuff attached.  And it\'s regular - you can run your service as often as
you can afford.
 
Furthermore, once you have established the backbone for this network, you
can then start selling space on it for other people\'s messages - becoming
an alternate xboat service..  Then you can haul the stock-market data.

TU existence?  Well, media networks similar to Reuters etc exist - TNS is a
fine example.  And Makhidkarun doesn\'t just sell Big Maks - it also
specialises in media and entertainment, including magazines.  This makes it
at least one prime candidate for running such a network.

The economics are driven by competitive pressures.  Either you pay for the
fastest available system, or your competitors eat you.

Legal limitations?  Well there are regulations on media here in Australia,
mainly to stop it becoming even more monopolised than it is.  The Imperial
government might want to keep J6 to itself, but "Big Mak" and the other
Megacorps are pretty powerful lobbies...

Collusion?  Could the media cartels have agreed to not try to cut each
other\'s throats this way?  Maybe, but all it would take is one aggressive
medium-size tabloid publisher with some well-armed friends to break the
cartel.  Maybe it hasn\'t happened yet.

Well, we know that the Imperium makes heavy use of colonial forces in
wartime.  Presumably there would need to be training exercises to allow the
colonial units to become familiar with environments other than those on
their own world.

In some cases, the colonial forces may actually perform the roles Imperial
forces would, if the latter are stretched thin in an area (subsector). 
Huscarle and other elite hi-tech units are most likely to be used here,
under the authority of local nobles.  There is an example of this for the
Duke of Regina\'s Huscarles in the Civil War given in an old JTAS and the
Spinward Marches Campaign (CT).

Of course, Huscarles are a bit of an odd case.  In some cases they may not
really quite count as planetary forces, but in others they would be the
"guard" units, IMO.

Forces serving with Imperial forces could be either required to be provided
(tax, feudal service, and/or treaty) or could be offered voluntarily either
for prestige, or because the world\'s elite has something serious at stake
in the particular conflict.

Could Planetary forces be used for expansionism?  Well, the Imperium tends
to frown on large power blocs forming within its territory, but there are
worlds that are colonies of other imperial worlds, (eg:
Garda-Vilis/Tanoose).  Presumably it happens sometimes.  The key is
probably the pragmatic political excuses used, and the political situation.

Planetary forces could potentially be used to further corporate interests
too.  Remember, senior Nobles are wealthy, and not merely powerful.  They
could well be able to arrange an intervention in their companies\'
interests:  see the history of various "Banana Repulics".

It\'s not impossible for planetary forces to support other planetary
governments.  These alliances may be genuine, or may involve subsidies,
where the "allied" forces are effectively mercenaries.  This kind of thing
might be more common when a mid-tech world needs to support an expensive
high-tech army.

All the last few suggestions are situations that the Imperium would not
encourage.  However, the Imperium is run by men, not laws.  The principle
would be that anything that doesn\'t threaten the peace of the realm, and is
in the interests of the local Duke\'s family, is OK...

Obviously, this only scratches the surface.  IYTU, planetary forces can do
anything you want them to!

But they do accumulate and burden the communication system. If a

The point is that _reliable_ and _timely_ are incompatible goals.
You cannot easily get both.  The same goes for _meaningful_ and
_detailed_. Whatever communications system you have, some of your
lucky or fast or well-camouflaged or small crooks (be it pirates,
smugglers, or anything else you care to name) are going to get
by.

So your list is relevant and reliable, but it\'s still slow to get
out and doesn\'t include those who looked innocent but weren\'t, or
even those who only looked a little odd.  How many forms of
mopery and dopery in the spaceways qualify for inclusion on your
"Imperium\'s most wanted" list? The bigger it is, the harder it is
to manage.

waste my **** time with this **** **** of ****" (Insert nouns and
adjectives to taste) appear to be quite common.  Just watch the

Some TUs or sectors of them have several such "utter dumps" for
every class A starport.

   A good analogy would be trying to run your shipping data
collation system through some sort of mail system between any two
sites. You can use any size or kind of diskette you want, but no
phone lines and nothing can travel faster than 20mph.  Also
remember that computing technology between different sites might
vary from Classic Roman Digital to Pentium whatever-the-latest-
version.
  (It occurs to me that LEOs looking for crooks aren\'t the ONLY
ones who would like to get a good look at shipping data...)
As for catching them, different kinds of crimes require different
methods. Combinations seem to work better than relying on just
one.

Same thing. It\'s a matter of scale. If a world can afford 16,000
60 MCr traders for the price of one Trillion credit naval
squadron, you _could_ call theft of one or two of them petty.

That\'s exactly why bugs in automatic echoing and rebroadcasting
programs are the bane of the Internet. In a more controlled form,
it\'s actually quite common: X subscribes to two lists and posts
the same message to both of them: Y subscribes to the same two
lists, and reads the same message twice.  Both the Internet and
the X-boat system have sometimes unreliable links (do accidents
ever happen to X-boats?) The Internet tries to route a message
different ways if one link can\'t be used; and usually this works.
If there\'s a delay, it\'s usually seconds or minutes. This doesn\'t
work as well for the X-boats (or whatever substitute you use).
With the X-boats, it takes two weeks to find out whether a message got
through a link so you can try a different different routing. You have a
choice of accepting missing messages, delays of weeks, or
tolerating echoes.

Once again, you can have your info fast, or you can have it
reliable, but you can\'t have it both.  Any crook who sticks to an
area and a pattern long enough might as well hang out a "come get
me" sign anyway.

   My opinions of the American court system are off-topic on this
list, but quite apart from the presumption of guilt or innocence:
   Do MoJ warrants hold up because they are usually solidly based
on evidence, or because they are Imperial? If the latter, then we
can assume that in many quarters, "Imperial Ministry of Justice"
is regarded as an oxymoron.

>>IMHO there are better ways to combat petty piracy.

Several of them have already been discussed on the list. Cargo tracing
is one possible tool, but by itself it won\'t solve much

>Any crime that requires a multi-megacredit tool to perform is
>more than petty.

   As far as a pirate ship being a multi-megacredit investment
goes,  please don\'t tell me you think someone who plans to make a
living from larceny and murder is going to go down to the
shipyard and plunk down a down payment on a conventional mortgage
for a properly registered ship like a respectable citizen unless they start
as a privateer. Even then,  IMTU pirate ships are almost always stolen
property in the first place. In the second, they might change hands for a
trade of a lesser model plus a few MCr or so in booty.
   I\'d consider "corsair" type ships to be built by government
subsidy for the use of privateers: They tend to be purchased at a
steep discount compared to other types of ships. If the
government recoups any of its investment, they\'re cheaper than
pure warships. They also tend to be written off as destroyed or
missing in action...only to turn up in the hands of pirates a few
years after the war is over.
   "There are only three rules to privateering. First, we shoot
pirates. Second, anyone who steals from our side is a pirate.
Third, salvage from enemy ships is not piracy."
   Thor Bradley Rudbek of Rudbek at Rudbek was surely not the
first to notice that it can be ruinously expensive to be "rich".
Starship expenses can eat a remarkably big hole in a MCr in a
remarkably short time.
   Even if just having posession of a starship makes you filthy
rich compared to the celebrated man in the street, how often is a
pirate ever going to sell the thing for more than a few percent
of its original price? I don\'t think it would be often enough to
even retire in comfort.

  You allege that such a business would be unlikely -  is that supported?

  I\'d agree that a J-6 X-boat like network is far from guaranteed,
and in fact minimal adherence to canon prevents it. A J-5+ courier
system linking major worlds only is an entirely different proposition
for most purposes, and is both cheaper and much easier to justify as
a profitable business; basic figures on the business have been posted.

IIRC the ANZAC frigate design has modular weapons, it\'s just that our
government in its infinite wisdom, is buying the cheapest (read crappiest)
options.

I did a simple study a while back to show the effect having only
preindustrial food production means has on population growth. When you go
through the figures it rapidly becomes clear that you have to have many
more men than women in the population before the low birth rate is more of
a limitation on growth than shortage of food production. The lower the
surplus food production by the adult population, the less the shortage of
women matters. For an extreme example if it takes 100 adults to produce
enough food for themselves and one child, obviously as long as there is one
woman (though a few more to allow for losses during childbirth would be of
use) the birth rate can easily out-strip the growth in food production.

Was the Tigress the BB with a whole lot of fighters, as well? I\'ve only
seen that particular book once, and like a fool I didn\'t buy it (being a
_Space Opera_ player in those days). I\'ve always had this suspicion that a
lot of pro BR arguments use the Tigress as the BB example because it\'s not
an optimal design.

I can\'t see why not, as long as there\'s room for the bay . In FF&S1 there
is the paralell mount, which is built alongside the spine, and limited to
80% of the ship\'s length. As there aren\'t actually structural I can\'t see
any reason one couldn\'t retrofit them.

  The LE is pretty much a straight "correction" of the CE built at TL F,
so the 6 was mandated right along with the sucky Agility and the poor
weapons load out (per HG, weapon-X hits will wreck you). The armour\'s
not at a real good level, either :(

  The IE could have a 6 or an E (5fib) - for protracted raiding the latter
seemed better to avoid needless mission kills. Offence is marginally degraded
but that hardly matters against small freighters, and the combat Agility of
3 really makes a difference, particularly against Zho frigates, et al.

  A combat optimized Gazelle wouldn\'t be 3-400 tons, IMHO :)

  If they\'re transported on compact media (~CD) and the duplicates aren\'t
kept on file then the level of traffic could easily be tolerable. While
inserting false data into the stream must be possible, the main point of 
collating all this data is to look for anomalies - like the ship that

  OK - I\'ll take reliable and meaningful (whatever happened to choosing
between fast, cheap, and "food"? - ah, the good old days :> ). Again, a
system to double-check traffic doesn\'t need to be fast unless you\'re
trying to figure out which ship is the commerce raider - for which direct
methods will likely be much better.

  FWIW, I\'d be shocked if some of the pirates, smugglers, etc. aren\'t the
security forces or intelligence organizations running ops (talk about a 
neat way to remove loud-mouthed conspiracy theorists...).

  Slow to get out, but probably a lot faster over a sector or two than
a tramp freighter. IAC, it\'s not meant to be a short term solution.

  What ticks off the powers that be (and who they are!) varies by TU.
It\'s not impossible that people who try to fund J-6 courier networks
are really high on certain shitlists. I\'d go with threats to internal
security (piracy, hijacking - smuggling is peripheral due to the use
of it as a cover for fencing, and enemy intel ops), major economic
crimes, and serious crimes against persons (murder, assault & battery,
kidnapping, rape, spamming).

 "I don\'t **** care about any" other TU\'s :) - well, except the OTU :)
As for the rest, if the Imperium can\'t on average find 2-3 reliable 
staff per backwater then I cringe to consider the reliability of their
military personnel (which would, OC, explain the Rebellion...). OC, it\'s
not unreasonable to have an Imperium so corrupt that slaves and "donor"
organs are euphemistically advertised in every port as it would explain
a lot, but it would need to be spelled out a bit more clearly.

  Similar systems worked fairly well before computers - or electronic

backwater if they really felt the need.

  Perhaps you should discuss when a cost is petty/trivial with Mr.
Summers :)  More seriously, the fact remains that MCr 60 is a value
that will fund a substantial effort to prevent and/or recover a loss.

Well, is this going to be enough to support an entire X-boat
kind of distribution system?  How much are they willing to pay?
I don\'t see it myself and we are talking non-Trivial amount
of money.

But look at what we have today. Most norwegain newspapers consists almost
enterily of norwegian news, some european news, and few from other places (the
big big news and some funny stuff) I think that you\'ll get planetary
"newspapers", who really cares what goes on a parsec away anyway. There is
enough happening on the planet anyway. In smaller population, there won\'t be 
place for two papers anyway.

But still, it isn\'t to many who are interested in news from more than a couple
of tens of miles from there home. How many of you americans or australians 
follow european news regulary? How many of us europeans follow american news?  
And does anybody follow news from Africa, except for africans?

The problem is that there is quite possibly a local competitor that is going

people tend to be very self-centered.

Hold your horses a bit here. Now you see this has become confussing to me.
First we were talking about a extencive J6 - X-boatish network that would 
carry information (mail,news etc.) throughout the Imperium, now were down to
an express route between four worlds.

Second. Your using a HG-ship. Whats its cost? I don\'t own HG, so I can\'t easily
find this out. Since I\'m a FFS-guy myself how does the prices compare?

This is were you miss some of my views. We have four worlds of over 8 billion 
TL F citizens each. What do you trade between these worlds that they can\'t
produce themself? Why would anybody on Glisten be interested in what goes on
on Mora? There is enough going on on Glisten to fill every newspaper to the
brim. You assume that all citizens on Glisten will have an interest in Mora.
I\'m not even sure that one citizen on Glisten would give a rats ass about
what goes on on Mora. You see. You can find the number that is needed to support
the network (although your numbers lack the expences for other expences than 
building the ships, maintaining them and crewing them), but there is now way 
that you can show if this number is possible to meet. You can argue from 
your point of view. I can argue from my point of view. You might think that I\'m
just being argumentative, but you should consider that I actually might have a
hole other viewof the Imperium than you.

"might" and "the possible result". Two phrases in your sentence that brings my
point out in daylight. You see, I don\'t want a world taht is dominated by the TL
F impies. Were they do soley trade with themself. I see the Imperium as a

spacetravel as we have with NASA. There will be accounts of ships leaving and
coming. But news from other worlds will be as scarce as news about astrophysical 
discoveries are today. 1 to 2 newsstories a day seems guite right to me. And
if we look at the TNS-news releases that might mot be to much of.

One problem that might araise is the accidental destruction of the 
record media (i.e the CD in this case). Imagine a X-Boat carring 
mail that is essential to a corporation or maybe to a law suit and
arriving in-system discore that the hard-drive and backups are 
corrupted due to a human error, jump space anomali, etc. ;-)

How is this information handled when the X-Boat gets in-system.

Say there is a warrant out for a smuggler. The warrant is sent out
by xboat. Is it sent out in all directions, or in the most likly direction
that the smuggler has gone? When reaching a system, does it automaticly 
go with the next x-boat out, or is it up to the starport sheriff to
send it on? If it is sent on automaticly and the starport sheriff
has arrested the smuggler what then?

But how the hell do they determine if the staff is reliable. You can\'t, so
you hire the one you think you can rely on, but among these there will be
corrupted staff, just like there is today. (And incompetent also)

Why? With an average GDP of 15000Cr (at 4$ per Cr -> 60.000$)
versus the average GDP of under 3000$ today, this is no more than 
a car theft (assuming that the ship is not new). And we know how 
serious the police are about car theft today :-) They routinly call
in the military to get these thieves, just like the IN is taking care
of the pirates. (sarcasme intended ;-)

Some ? Most. But it increases the risk, and decreases the chance that they
will survive for long enough to learn their trade well.

The toher risk for smugglers is RICO type laws - you may be able to make a
profit of KCr 500 smuggling stolen ship parts, but you are risking a MCr 20
ship doing so.

Yep. If you want to go after fraud, go thru the documentation.

There are also lots of good adventure opportunities with people who
shouldnt retailing commercial shipping data.

Why not use them as legitimate Mercenary Cruisers or as Frontier Traders ?

There are several problem with this, at least as far as the Marches goes.
Firstly, there are several areas (Sword Worlds, Vargr Extents, Federation
of Arden) that would not ask too many questions about a ship\'s previous
ownership history. In the case of the Vargr, go two or three governments
over, and I dont think they\'d care at all.

Secondly, there is very little functional difference between a Frontier
Trader, a Mercenary Cruiser and a Pirate ... big cargo hold, better
armament and maneuver than most merchants, big passenger capacity.

Thus, I believe if you are prepared to travel some way, I believe that you
can sell stolen ships for a fair percentage of their value.

Now, this doesnt mean I believe that piracy around mainworlds is
profitable, but once you have stolen a ship, you can get buckets of credits
for it.

Yes, but the problem is the main counters for PAWs and Meson Guns (high gee
maneuver) are expensive, and the main counters for lasers and missiles
(thin armour and sandcasters and lasers respectivly) are cheap.

One laser costs KCr 250 under HG. One ship-wrecker missile costs MCr 2.

Why would the Imperium care ? Anyone too poor for good information is

I can accept that \'starting price\' exchanges may occour (\'I contract to buy

122-1117\'), but I can also see why the buyer and seller would want a

Yep. In spades, in fact.

Remember, the House of Rothschild went from modertae to giant on advance
news of Waterloo ... I also have unreliable memories of some group of
investors putting the Duke of Malborough on retainer, so they could have
first news of how his wars went (ahh, the good old days of sold commissions

If Oslo is anything like every other major city I\'ve visited, it is going

I\'m a news junkie, although I admit I dont know for sure who the Norwegian
government is (I think the Social Democrats are in, but I\'m not 100%
certain). But I follow German politics reasonably closely, and I am sure
you can find Norwegian Greens who know the name Bob Brown.

Jump-6 TL 15 couriers are cheaper in FFS2. Most designs crunch out to about
MCr 150, including maneuver drives and some cargo space.

What trade is there between Germany and America that they couldnt produce

Interstellar trade works because of novelty and economies of scale.

About 0.1% of them is about 10 million customers ... even better economics

When you are dealing with MCr 150 assets with four (count em) crew, the
other expenses tend to drift slowly into the background compared to ponying
up the cost of the ships.

Unfortunatly, the Spinward Marches are completely dominated by a handful of
high-population, high technology worlds.

I\'d prefer having the highest population in the Marches at about 100
million. Blame Marc Miller for making population on a log bell curve, and
not fixing the die rolls correctly for the Marches back in the good old days.

Goes into the starport computer, gets cross-checked with the arrest list

No, a MCr 15 ship is worth 1 000 times per capita income on a TL15 world.
Per capita income in the industrialised West is about US$20 000, so the
equivalent is more like $20 million.

Last I looked, the military did tend to get called out when someone nicks a
747, even a 20 year old one in poor condition.

    'body' => '\'Famile Spofulam Releases New Laser Turrets\'

\'Enigmatic business tycoon, Hengabar Sofulam, today released the latest
release from Famile Spofulam\'s High Energy Solution labs - the Signature
class X-ray lasers.

The weapons, a TL13 rapid-fire X-ray lasers, are designed to fit into
Imperial standard 3 and 6 dton turrets, and are capable of firing at a rate
of 24 shots per minute, and are capable of sustained, accurate fire out to
500 000 km.

The turrets include beam pointers and a crewstation, and are designed to
slot directly into an appropriately sized turret socket.

The first is a 200 megajoule laser unit, and masses 47.75 t and is quoted
at costing MCr 2.2, including the 3 dton turret. The second is a 650
megajoule laser unit, massing 115.5t and costing MCr 3.1, including the
6dton turret.

Hengabar\'s neice, Ditzammer Spofulam, met with reporters after
demonstrating the lighter weapon by carving her initials in a X-tek XTF-4
Delta Fighter at a range of 120 000 km. The demonstation of the heavier
version was terminated after 7.5 seconds fire, as the target had been
turned into plasma by that time.

Her comments were \'Weeeee reckon that if you only have spaceie-wace for one
laser-waser, then it oughta oughta oughta be a good one. Weeee reckon that
the the the baby Signature-wignature can put out as much megajoulage as
eight nooormal civilian laser-wasers, an an an can solve most
problem-woblems\'.

The Imperial Ministry of Justice has issued a temporary restraining order
against sale of the heavier model to civilians. It is understoof Famile
Spofulam\'s legal team are planning an appeal.\'

****************************************************************************
*******

The 200 MJ laser has a damage value of 51 (2.5 cm of superdense), while the
650 MJ laser has a DV of 92 (4 cm of superdense). Both have a minimum delay
between shots of 2.5 seconds - eight times the RoF of a \'standard\'
shipboard laser. Precise ratings depend on the combat system you use, and
the RoF your power plant can maintain.

These babies burn up a lot of power - you need [MJ/(0.65*delay)] megawatts
to keep shooting them. Note that you can reduce the output of the laser to
increase the rate of fire, which could be important when using them in a
point defense role.

The cost is actually dominated by the 500 000km beam pointer, which could
be cut down to 50 000km by cheapskates.

Note that one of these lasers is, in general, as effective as 8 lasers at
the \'standard\' rate of fire of a shot every 20 seconds. Lots of luck
powering the big laser at maximum RoF though (370 MW ... ouch).

At TL13, they are very cutting edge for the early Imperium, but are
technically obsolescent by the 1100s.

****************************************************************************

I\'ve done a TL12 plasma bazooka, and a TL12 400 MJ plasma gun, but I\'m too
tired for more typing.

Ditzie wants me to note that the Main Plasma Gun fits in her new toy ...
Uncie Hengie got worried about Gravitic Sensors, and asked Ditzie to build
a TL12 battlefield helicopter.

Ditzie thinks it will fly ... it mounts a 400 MJ plasma gun and a
starship-grade sandcaster, and is entirely powered by fuel cells ... and
thus is completely invisible to gravitic sensors.

Subject: Re: G:T ship design questions
Hello all
My first questions concerns armor for ships.
I know how to add armor to a ship, but how much armor should
a ship.
the ships included in the GT book, have vastly varying armor
rates.
for example, the Dragon Class SDB (page 144) has a DR of
1011, ok...its a combat vessel, its supposed to have armor.
The Broadsword class mercenary cruiser (page 139) also a
combat vessel, unless I\'m mistaken, has a DR of 100.  quite
a discrepancy.
**************
The Broadsword isnt really a combat vessel, it is an armed transport.


My next problem is with the cost and mass of the armor.
should armor at TL12 cost more and have more mass than the
ships hull?

yes

IIRC - Nick Leeson

The guy I know who used to work for Bearings (in a UK division)
and was at the time facing no job and a significant dent in his
earnings for the year had some relief when I brought back a
poster featuring Nick\'s new home (Changi Jail) :-)

(I believe his annual bonus was paid and in any case he\'s back
to earning unreasonably vast sums from another company.)

However the point is relevant.

If each company\'s shares can only be traded at the system of its
registered HQ, then you must be allowed to send Mr Nick with
MCr800 to that system to trade how he wishes.

Now you don\'t need to talk with Mr Nick, except to receive annual
accounts and give (or receive) suitcases stuffed with ImpCr or the
electronic fund transfer equivalent. :-)
So you might think that you don\'t need the fast X-boats.

But what about those people who trade in YOUR shares?

They cannot trade with Mr Nick because its not your registered HQ.
Now you could set up Mr Nick as a separate limited company (possibly
a good idea as it turned out) but either you don\'t own the shares to
Nick Sharetrader plc (which means you\'ve just thrown away MCr800)
or you do (which means that news that when Mr Nick loses MCr800
your share price is hit).

So someone is going to want to know what\'s going on several systems
away and is going to be able to make money from more up to date info.

Or there is no interstellar trade.

My only contention is that assuming that everone has lots of J-6
couriers standing around waiting for that vital message does not
work and that an optimised J-6 network would exist between
major planets with other planets taking feeds from those planets.

IMO:
Since the OTU has an inefficient X-boat network with J-4 ships
with no manoeuvre drives used for J-1 hops to meet couriers
then there has to be a reason. Maybe it was reasonable when setup
(but I disagree with that) but clearly someone is keeping the
X-boats inefficient now.

Take some of your original bays, merge them into a single unit, and 
build a big honking weapon in them.  You wouldn\'t be using a bay 
anymore, since it would be unable to move, so you basically have a 
spinal now.  Use any other bays and sny cargo space for extra power 
generation.  Actually, this might be closer to being a parallel mount 
than a spinal.  

Re reducing the size of a spinal mount, maybe not, seems its mount would 
be integral to the structure of the ship, so even if you did reduce the 
size, you\'d gain little in more space, due to maintaining structural 
integrity.  Course, if extra space is not your concern, and you just 
want to swap that old PAW for a newer and smaller MG, go ahead.

	I had a question for the list...

	I realize that once a ship has been built, it\'s spinal mount cannot be
changed (or made larger; not sure about smaller).  However, what about ships
that never had a spinal mount installed when built?  You could not put one in
later...but since bays are no longer limited to just 50 and 100 tons, why
can\'t you put a spinal-mount sized weapon in a custom designed bay?  This
gives low-tech ships a chance of possibly being given a form of SLEP to keep
it competitive (at least somewhat) as opposed to building a whole new class of
vessels.

	Is this possible and legit, or is it simply pure rules-lawyering?

Subject: GT Gunship
Hello all
This is my first design for a GT starship.  I started with a
50 ton cutter and eventually made it into a gunship/honking
big fighter.  since this is my first attempt at designing a
GT ship, I not too concerned with viability or realism of
design (though those comments are welcome) I am mostly
concerned with getting my math right.  I have created the
larval form of a spreadsheet for help in constructing this
ship, If you want a copy lemme know and i\'ll mail it out.
on with the ship
50 Ton SL hull. DR200 with basic stealth and emissions
cloaking.

More DR?

Modules
     Basic Bridge
     Engineering
     2 Hull mounted Missile racks
     4 Staterooms
     1250cf of cargo space
     15 Maneuver Drive Units
     1 Turret w/ 2 360MJ lasers and one sandcaster
Statistics:
**********
you have 5 weapons here when only 3 are allowed. my suggestion, drop the
turret and go with hull mounted weapons.

NOTE: final cost includes a full load of missiles (154) and
sand canisters (200)
comments...please point out any errors I may have made and
let me know what you think
****************
using the standard format would manke the ship easier to read and comment
on. consider making this as a heavy fighter instead, use a cockpit, cut the
staterooms, bring the ship above 6 Gs. and add as much armor as you can
still keeping accel.

Actually, looking at the survey data there are a fair number of colonial
worlds, \'owned\' by other worlds. In the core sectors of the Imperium, one must
assume a fair number of these are long-term multi-world polities.

Also, The Imperium will only discourage things that threaten its own power. A
Sector Duchess, who controls five or ten worlds is not a threat. She can call
herself the Queen of the Freedonian Empire; the Imperium doesn\'t care, so long
as she maintains her fealty to the Emperor, and, probably more important, pays
her taxes on time, and doesn\'t hassle the major corporations with excessive
trade regulations. (NOTE: I said _major_ corporations. The Imperium will allow
almost unlimited hassling of the little guys, like PC\'s, as they\'re too small
to matter. If you start hassling Tukera, OTOH, very soon an Imperial Fleet is
paying a visit...and Tukera will stop, which means your economy tanks.)

However, for *life* it would seem that you need orbits stable on

Frankly, given that it\'s *impossible* to give a fighter enough armor to
matter, I think that the standard design for fighters *not* intended to
enter atmosphere would be a central support "spar" (sort of like the
triangular trusses to be used in the International Space Station). You
have the engines, cockpit, and weapons systems off of this.

Consider that once you have space based observatories at several AU
from your star, you can accurately determine stellar positions for at
least a dozen or so parsecs with little effort. Heck, a well equipped
*ship* could do it. They\'d just need to have the time to move around
many AUs without jump.

Once you have observatories in different *systems (and thus seperated
by one or more parsecs) you can accurately determine stellar positions
for any star in the galaxy that you can see.[1]

Spaceborne telescopes of the size of the ones we have now on the
ground, as well as things like long baseline optical interferometers
will let planets be detected for at least hundreds of parsecs. Gas
giants definitely, and a fair number of the others.

So scouts will *know* where stars are before they jump. They\'ll also
know if there are gas giants. And have a rough idea of where other
planets may be and what their orbits will be like. 

So what they\'ll be doing is determining the "exact" planetary sizes, as
well as looking for smaller planets and asteroids. Given that it could
take years to *accurately* determine the orbits of the planets (well
enough to generate the parameters that navigation software will want)
and similar amounts of time to check out various features on the
planets themselves, I expect that things would go like this:

1. A single scout jumps in, and sits there making astronomical
   observations and monitoring radio frequencies. If there\'s no
   evidence of civilization, he\'ll keep making observations for a month
   and then jump back "home". If there is some evidence of
   civilization, he\'ll either try to make contact, or record things and
   jump back home.

2. If the scout *doesn\'t* return on time, the service sets a warning
   flag for the system, and sends in a *pair* of much more covert
   scouts. One stays stealthy in the outer system and watches the
   other, while staying ready to jump out *immediately* if anything odd
   happens.
   Most of the time they just rescue the first scout from a
   malfunction. Less often, they recover the remains after a ship
   malfunction. And in rare instances, the first scout either
   misjumped, or otherwise disappeared. The ship hiding in the outer
   system is in a position to observe the first ship\'s entry and exit
   flashes, and possibly any distress messages beamed towards the
   previous system. In *really* rare instances, the system harbors
   hostile aliens, in which case at least one of the second set set of
   ships is going to escape.
 
2. Once a "First-In" scout has done the initial survey, the system is
   scheduled for a follow-up. This will be done by a large group (small
   flotilla?) of ships which will spend several years mapping the
   planets, pinning down orbital data, searching for other
   planets/asteroids in the system, and actually doing
   geological/biological surveys of the planets and asteroids.

3. After the follow-up is done, the new inf will be added to the
   official databases. 

But in any case, the main factor slowing system surveys is that anyone
trying to make a systematic survey *has* to set things up so that if a
ship is lost, they know *where* it got lost. That\'s why step 1 is set
up the way it is. The "home" system may merely have a temporary base in
it, or a follow-up group. But by being due back at a certain time, the
risks are lowered and thus you don\'t wind up waiting six months, and
then spending a year searching, only to find out that the ship got
nailed in the first system it visited.

I\'d say that the IISS will accept reports from free traders and the
like who\'ve explored beyond the "surveyed" areas. If a trader reports
something interesting, the IISS might even send a follow-up based
solely on his info without sending a First-In scout. And as long as
things check out, having explored it first yourself may even entitled
you to special status with regards to filing claims. 

I don\'t think they\'d be quite as happy if you initiate first contact
with a spacefaring culture. Pre-space cultures they problably don\'t
mind too much, as long as you didn\'t botch things and leave them with a
mess to straighten out. 

If I expanded the above, plus some of my other ideas into a "How the
IISS survey works" document, would folks be interested? 

[1] With a 2 AU baseline, we can determine distances out to at least a
dozen parsecs. At *one* parsec, we are dealing with distances 100,000
times the length of our baseline. So if our baseline is a parsec, then
we can determine distances that are more than 100,000 parsecs. Which is
somewhat more than the distance to the other side of the galaxy.

As I recall, one of Asimov\'s science essays dealt with what life would
be like on earth if we had a double star. Based on the Alpha Centauri
system he placed the second star out at about Uranus\'s orbit. 

He calculaterd that it wouldn\'t affect Earth\'s temperature noticeably.
But that it would give as much light as the full moon (?) at closest
approach. But it\'d still be a point of light.

If anybody can track down the specific essay and which of his books it
was collected in, I think it\'d be a good reference for the list.

Uhhh, David, I think you underestimate the power of the Media. We\'re talking
things like, oh, sayyy, Disney + Sony + CNN + Dow Jones + Murdoch, Inc. rolled
into one. On an Imperium-wide scale, so its them times several thousand. 

Have you _any_ clue on the profit margins Disney makes??? We _ARE_ talking a
non-trivial amount of money here. Easily enough to support these kinds of
rapid couriers. We _are_ talking about megacorps like Makhidkarun, here. You
know, one of the ones that used to run a third of Known Space, a long time ago?

We\'re talking big, here, really REALLY big here.

Its currently a joint venture between the Christian Democrats, the Centerparty
(former Farmers party) and the Left party (liberals). They have like 25% of
the seats in the Storting and rule because the other parties, Workers Party
(social democrats) 35%, The Right Party 25%, the Progress Party 20%, can\'t agree
on anything. Its a very wierd situation were the Regjering (the three parties in
Governmental position) is get support from case to case.

You can not compare two 8 billion populations with two 300 million populations.
What is it the Earth needs to import that we can not produce ourself? 

>Interstellar trade works because of novelty and economies of scale.

But what is it that Mora produce that Regina can\'t produce themself. With 8
billion citizens, fusion, strong force manipulation, I really don\'t see what
Mora can offer Regina, or Regina can offer Mora. Regina is short on raw
materials, you can be sure that Mora is that also, so they both import their 
raw materials from som close bye mining world. So Regina (or Mora) is most
interested in what goes on on their own world, and with 8 billion people around
there is enough going on there to insure that Regina news, tri-vids, magazines
etc. are dominating the home market.

Now on a pop 5 mining world it is totally different, as there is not enough
people to make newspapers, tri-vids, refrigarators etc. so they import what they
need. But their needs are not enough to justify a J6 -Xboat network. At least
not in my view :-)

But you still havn\'t answered why the rich people is interested in what 
happens elsewhere? To take a bizarre eksample. A norwegian cheesemanufacturer
is using only norwegian raw materials (importing would be to expencive), his
market is Norway (I can\'t even supply the need on this market). This
manufacturer is not going to be interested in general news from around the
world. He want\'s the news that affect him personally, and those news are 
norwegian and mainly about the cheesemarket in norway.

No this xample is bizarre because norway is such a small society that we could
argue that there would be competition from the outside, cheaper raw materials
outside norway and so on. But scaling this up to Regina you have such a large
soceity that he\'ll have enough keeping track on what is happening on Regina
to worry about Mora. Again in my maybe not so correct view :-)

But what is the general cost of living for these people. The administrators
that run the network, the building that the HQ is in. The cost of setting up
offices where the customers deliver thier messages. The web-servers, the
buildings these webservers are in. The technical staff to keep these on-line
rental of phone lines, permits, advertising. How can you be sure that this
is not going to be a significant sum.

Yes, population, politics, military and ecomonics are dominated by the large
worlds. But that doesn\'t necessarelly mean that they are very interested in what
goes on outside the atmosphere on the world.

Well, the Imperium is in my view not a good place to make good adventures, at
least not when it is the way Steve, Hans and you portray. Sorry :-) but I don\'t
like it that way. You have no marigin for human stupidity or error. Every thing
is streamlined to the upmost efficency, everything is rational to the extreme,
and infaluble. Just look at the "Dumber than mud (OT)"-thread. There is in my
view going to be 99% self centered sapien beings in the Imperium, each driving
towards his own goal. That spells chaos to me, not order and perfection.

But is it handled manually. Is it completly automatic or is someone set to
verify it. What if the crime the guy is wanted for is not a crime on this world?
What I was asking for was an oppurtinity to have the Starport Sheriff not
getting around to verifying the warrent, so that it misses the X-boat out, and

A car today can cost 200.000$ easily (an expensive one, but say it is a boat for
sake of argument). In USA the GDP per citizen is 28.600$. The average GDP per
citizen of the world is more like say 2.800$. So assuming that Regina has
approximatly the same numbers, a well established (but not rich reginian)  would
have a GDP per citizen of say 150.000Cr (10 times the average GDP per citizen of
the world). So the car could cost 1.5MCr to be an equivalent of a 200.000$.

Would the military be sent out (with Orion planes, figates and like)
to hunt down a guy who steals something like a 2M$ boat?

But the timescales that long hasn\'t been explored yet, so one can hope
that a orbit stable over a million years will be stable a thousand times that
long. And this simulation is also only circular orbits taken with 15 degrees 
inclination steps (0, 15, 30, 60... degrees inclination). So it is by no means
extencive enough to give to many answers, but it could provide som clues.

include ship control sheets for Full Thrust (because some people use that
for ship combat).  I think it would also be useful to write up the design
for other rulesets; for example, GURPS and High Guard. 

I understand that the conversions wouldn\'t be strictly \'canon\' in the
other rules - a T4 ship is differently designed than a GT ship. What I
want is something that describes the T4 design in GT terms, so a referee
who is _not_ a gearhead could use the ship without learning T4 rules.

The Full Thrust conversions would be easier, in the sense that AFAIK no
Traveller group uses the Full Thrust rules to design their Traveller ships.

In a sense it is. I imagine that the logic goes something like this: If
jump-6 message traffic was profitable, it would exist. Since canon states
that all message traffic goes by the X-boat network (at an average of 2.6
parsecs/week!), jump-6 message traffic does not exist. Therefor it cannot
be profitable.

I think that it is so obvious that speedy information would be worth a lot,
but I can\'t prove it, and I don\'t feel the need, because I also think it
obvious that the statement that all message traffic goes at a top speed of
2.6 parsecs/week cannot be true. At the very least the Navy would want a
better service than that and IMO the Imperial Bureaucracy would piggyback
on whatever system the Navy used.

But that dosen\'t mean I think that a jump-6 network would necessarily be
as extensive as the X-boat system. Indeed, since I would like to retain
the X-boat system for the background (though I would love to have it
redone in a more rational way), I must assume that it isn\'t. Nor is that
quite unbelievable. For one thing, the X-boats are cheaper and faster
for short distances. IMO the most likely setup would be a long-range and
a short-range system set up to supplement each other.

It might be, but why raise the point at all since no-one is proposing an
X-boat kund of distribution system? What we have been talking about is a
much smaller system that links a limited number of major systems (300 or
so sector and subsector capitals plus a few extra along the way).

A world with a population that low wouldn\'t be on the network anyway.

Well, if you have a world with 10 billion inhabitants and 1 in a hundred is
willing to pay a credit a day for good \'far-off events\' coverage, you are
grossing MCr36,500 per year...

If Steven can show that a network linking the most important worlds in one
sector to the sector capital is plausible it would go a long way to show
that a network linking that sector capital to the neighboring capital makes
sense too, wouldn\'t you say? And if you link that sector capital to the
major worlds of that sector and to the sector capitals of neighboring
sectors, pretty soon you have an Imperium wide network. Not, to be sure, an
extensive X-boatish network, but then, I don\'t think Steven propose doing
away with the X-boat network, merely the notion that the X-boats would be
the fastest means of communication available.

Relying only on (my memory of) information posted a few days ago, a HG jump-6
courier costs MCr155 while it costs less than a third of that by FF&S rules.

Well, in the 18th Century you had England and half a world away you had
India and China. What did they trade between these countries that they
could not produce themselves?

Not all. In fact, propably not all that many. But we do have canonical
evidence that some people do care what goes on on other worlds. Otherwise
the TNS wouldn\'t exist.

I am.

I didn\'t check out Steven\'s figures, but if he is using _TCS_ figures for
maintenance you can be quite sure that ALL expenses are accounted for
several times over.

  Why would a courier leaving every 7.5-8 days not be as reliable?
Sure, they\'re only point-to-point (although messages could then be
handed off to the X-Boats to save some time) but within that limit
they operate under the same constraints as X-Boats. The customer
knows that the ship leaves on day X, and lives with it.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
As I said earlier, when your fast courier service is dedicated to
point-to-point service, you won\'t have any (or many) problems
with reliability. Once you add hubs and nexi, you will start having
problems with missed connections. If your courier leaves every week,
then missing a connection by a day will cost you a week of time.
Not just there, but at every hub where a connection was missed.
The delays will add, even multiply in effect.
The X-Boat network can avoid this problem by having enough ships
to leave daily, or even more often - cutting delays from missed
connections drastically. The X-Boat system is slower, but the 
true speed of messages will reliably remain very, very close to the
average speed - thus the higher reliability. A smaller network of
high-jump weekly couriers may have a much higher maximum speed
of messages, but will have less ability to guarantee that any given
message (except messages travelling directly along a point-to-point
priority route) is actually travelling that fast - or travelling at all.

I agree there is a niche for point-to-point high jump courier routes,
but I see them as complementing the X-Boat system. Eventually
the X-Boat system may be improved to the point that the niche
market ceases to exist. Of course, if the wealthy people who might
fund such improvements already have such service available, why
would they improve what everyone else uses?

The Fighting Ships writeup for the Tigress gave it thirty squadrons of heavy
fighters.  It\'s probably the traditional BB example because it\'s the biggest
BB in Fighting Ships, at 500000 tons.  As a design concept, I think it looks
like a cross between a fleet carrier and a 300000 ton BB.

Well, some of us do, at least (gotta love the World Radio Network :-). The
idea is that if there are enough someones, then they can support a network
*at least* to the major, high-population worlds. Besides, we are not just
speaking about news, but _media_. Motion pictures, holovids, computer
games, books, magazines, and the like. The corporation that gets any of
these types of media to the market first is the one that is likely to make
huge amounts of money.

For a certain population (abeit, possibly a small percentage), exotic
off-world stuff is going to be very attractive. YMMV, of course, but IMHO
this certain population would be large enough to support a high-capacity
jump network *at least* between the major worlds.

[Of course, it seems to me unreasonable to assume that the Imperial Navy
will have anything less than J6 couriers; and with information being a
dense as it is, I cannot think of a reason why other organs of the Imperial
state would not  piggyback on this network. As I wrote, YMMV.]

Sharushiid has a processing plant at Barnard IV-C (Ikugi), where it 
is processing the lanthanum ore from the first and second planetoid 
belts.  Sharushiid is performing some research on new refining 
techniques, using the abundant sources in the newly discovered 
Ikugi system.  The original belters came in and began to establish 
the processing plant approximately ten years ago (circa late 2086AD.)

Due to the sensitive nature of the project, Sharushiid has 
constructed a small monitoring station on moons about each of the 
four gas giants in the outer system.  (These are located at V-B, VI-D 
and VII-B, as well as at the Ikugi base itself.)

Two years ago (late 2094AD), a small colony was established by 
Sharushiid at VI-C purportedly to conduct colonization research.  The 
original monitoring station at VI-A was abandoned, and moved to VI-D 
to protect the colony, as well.

The original VII outpost at VII-E was abandoned last year due to 
recent seismic activity, and was re-established at VII-B.  If the 
seismic activity settles, the company may choose to reactivate the 
original site.

The nomenclature used does not reflect either of the canonical 
systems mentioned in LBB 6: Scouts or MT ImpEnc.  Such systems were 
developed during the latter part of the Interstellar Wars and the 
Rule of Man.

Terran dates are used for reference herein, as I do not have the 
materials available here at work to generate the Vilani dates as 
well.

Thank you for your time.  I look forward to input from my valued

What effect does the moon have on the human body (except the added light
during nights and an irresistible craving to go there)? I mean
scientifically proven - not folklore.

Short-lived means thousands of years (the Crab remnant is about a 
thousand years old (the supernova was seen on Earth), and I think the Cygnus
structures are several thousand (maybe ten thousand) years old, and beginning
to thin out.

"not very dense" - the gas is actually less dense than the normal interstellar
medium (because it\'s very hot) - very thin vacuum. The crucial point is that
it\'s likely to be thin enough to be transparent at most wavelengths (it
glows from flourescence at emission lines of hydrogen or other materials.) 
This is different from the big dense molecular clouds where stars form, which
are nearly opaque due to the large amounts of dust present. (I could be wrong,
though - supernovae and their remnants are not my sepeciality.)

In fleet combats, ships below 3000 dTons (maybe even 5-10,000) are really
of limited use; in High Guard terms, a ship has to have a Computer/9, 
6G maneuver, decent armour, and missile-9 to be more than decorative against
capital ships. So there probably is a strong IN pressure to spend as much
money as possible on the capital ships and heavy escorts, rather than the
sort of 500-1000 ton ship you want lots of to heavily patrol against pirates.

And then look at what the IN does when it finally wants to build a 
1000-ton colonial cruiser for patrol duties: it builds the Kinunirs. 
Gold-plated (with a black globe generator and a pseudo-AI computer), somewhat
slow (a ship in this niche really should have 6 G), and with a weird armament
set (PA turrets.) It probably costs twice what a good escort should and
has half the capability. 

(Before anyone replies, I know the historical reasons why the Kinunir is 
weird, and know that they didn\'t really build many of them...although
I\'m not sure there is a good patrol-ship design in "Fighting Ships"; the
Crysanthemum is really tied to fleet ops, and I can\'t recall the specs of the
Fer-de-Lance.

Unfortunately if you have TL15, cheap fusion power, etc, you don\'t have pop 5
mining worlds because all those pop A worlds just strip mine the asteroids and
other planets in their own systems, have all their industry in orbit and
orbital farms as well.

You end up with the only trade being tourists to other planets and the
only material imports are the tourist souvenirs (sold by the TL15
factory to the TL3 world and then sold to the TL15 tourist.)

If eco tourism takes off, the only trade item is wildlife film crews :-)

The assumption in Trav is that there is a market for those pearl handled
FGMP-15s
and hand crafted walnut gearstick knobs.

You can\'t do this.

You can\'t average GDP across Earth and then say that the US government wouldn\'t
bother.

Consider who in your average country (GDP = 2800) would own a 2M$ boat and then
consider if El Presidente isn\'t going to use his navy to search for his boat.

(appologies for the obvious cultural slur)

If 15MCr to 1,000 time GDP on a TL15 world then it is equivalent to 28M$ in
USA.

Not forgetting that most Merchant ships in Trav are more than this.

so the 747 comparison is valid.

Fighting Ships is an interesting book; useful, but it has canon problems/
internal inconsistencies of almost IG proportions (though somehow these
didn\'t bother me when I first read it.) The Tigress does indeed carry a 
huge squadron of fighters - and even Imperial Heavy Fighters are (the ones
that are half fuel, needed by the huge power plant needed to power the huge
computer - everything that\'s wrong with HG ship design in one convienient
package) of limited use against capital ships. One can argue that it\'s more
intended for system control duties than line-of-battle; there are a couple of
more general battleships included as well. People mostly just site the
Tigress because it looks cool.

No objective study has ever proven any \'Full moon effect\' on any human
activies, except those that benefit from the added illumination at night
(keg parties, burglary, other assorted recreational activities like
that) There is actually no statisically significant increase in ER
admits, crime (other than the aforementioned burglary) or other \'moon

survey speeds. If it takes weeks, months, or years with good sensors within
a few parsecs of a target system to survey it well enough to jump, that
slows down expansion tremendously - which makes it much more plausible that
(for example) the Vilani never quite reached Earth, or the Imperium only moved
slowly towards and past the Marches...

For example, what if you really do need to chart the locations of most of
the planets inside the target system? What if ships that hit a planet\'s
100-d limit don\'t just pop out of jump space but pop out in small bite-sized
pieces? Then you need to know where at least the gas giants or the plane of 
a systems ecliptic is before you jump into it - even a 2% chance of hitting
Jupiter\'s 100-d limit is probably unacceptable. This requires observing the
system long enough to plot the orbits of the gas giants and to be sure
that you haven\'t missed any plantes (becuase, say, they were in front of 
the star); probably a month or two within ten parsecs with a good sensor,
or years within 30 parsecs with better sensors. If you combine this with a 
variant where you have to be within a thousand diameters to get *out*
of jumpspace - so you can\'t jump 20,000 AU away from a system - it slows
things down nicely. 

Another variant - how about if you can only come out of jumpspace at a 
place where local gravitational forces (from the star and a planet) 
cancel each other out - poised in-between the planet and the star - to within
a few thousand km. In that case you need to chart a system well enough to 
know where at least one planet is *and its mass*, which requires detecting
its moons or its effects on other planets - very time-consuming. The moons
in particular would require being within a couple of parsecs. 

Combine either of these with HePlaR-only drives - so that crossing a solar
system requires a couple of weeks - and the fastest-possible expansion could
well end up being a parsec per month even with an expensive dedicated survey
ship.

than the approximated version used in the Vehicles book (which are good

for long-duration survey missions; it\'s double fuel capacity gives it an
effective 4 parsec range and while by no means a warship, it has enough
firepower to survive potentially deadly encounters. The ship is still used
for survey missions by the IISS, as well as by private individuals (those
sold to private owners genrally remove the missle rack and replace it with
another set of lasers).

Just because it has not been documented does not mean it is not possible.
I asked the question because of personal experience (first in retail and
sales and then in customer service and tech support) during the full moon
period.  Clients are a bit more edgy, combative, rude, and generally
unpleasent.

Again, it was based on personal observations.

Probably not.  Remember, stars are emitters while most planets are only
detectable through reflected or reradiated emissions.  VLBI will increase
resolution, but not sensitivity.  You not only have to spot a planet but
you have to do so when there is a tremendously bright source (the star)
very nearby.  The planetary orbit may not be inclined to you in such a way
to give you a good reading, either.  Detecting planets a couple of parsecs
away, certainly, and gas giants (especially Jovian or larger emitters) well
beyond that -- but not "hundreds of parsecs".

Someone out there is supposedly writing GURPS Traveller: Scouts.  It might
be worthwhile to track that individual down and offer your services, before
it gets written some other way.

OK. Personally I\'m not touching the "network" in any real sense,
just trying to model J-5+ spines with minimal off-shoots - the one
for Al Morai would be Big Four, Regina post-war, and then from Mora
to anti-spinward (and eventually Capital).

  Particularly post-5FW the pilots (and engineers?) should be available
(as small raiders and escorts are stood down) to allow the handful of
couriers in question (less than a dozen for the minimal intra-sector
installation) to use military-style jumps for less variable jump-times.
Failing that, an 8.5 day schedule pretty much eliminates all normal
mishaps affecting scheduling.

  Businesses have very good reasons to want long-distance news, at least
in OTU. Elites also tend to be interested in more than the local gossip
and sports pages. And anyone with shares in mining companies operating in
Africa follows the news there; IIRC, some of the South African gold companies
are getting listings on NorAm exchanges now to capitalize.

  I\'ve been giving cases for express routes - the Big Four was merely the
smallest such model (well, now there\'s Mora-Rhylanor per Mr. Smith). I\'m
prepared to assume that there isn\'t a J-5+ X-Mail system.

 i) OTU assumes a fair chunk of trade. Given the assumptions about OTU I
can\'t argue - without that trade the result wouldn\'t be the OTU. FWIW, I
have run a campaign where most worlds were near self-contained autarkies
supported by asteroid mining and highly automated factories.

wants, needs, or can derive any physical utility from that news, then they\'re

Yep, this is also a well documented effect. Ask anyone who works an
E.R., fire or police station. Almost without fail, they will tell you
things get weird during a full moon, they have more cases, the have more
crazies, etc, etc. BUT if you look at the actual admissions or other
records, there isn\'t objective proof of the variation they notice
subjectively.

What _is_ happening, is that _you_ know that there\'s a full moon, by now
oyu are expecting more rudeness, craziness, etc, so that it is more
noticeable subjectively. than the usual run-of-the-mill craziness and
rudeness. You attribute things to the full moon that you don\'t attribute
to anything else the rest of the time.

You have something to hang it on...the rest of the month when some
a**hole ^H^H^H^H \'Valued customer\' treats you like crap, you think, \'oh
this is just another clueless a**hole\'. But during the full moon, you go
\'Hey, you know, it\'s a full moon tonight...gonna be a crazy one...\'

(I do know whereof I speak, being in tech support myself...)

  I think this we\'re talking about sending messages to authorities for
tracking/collation. I haven\'t given much thought to legal implementation,
nor have I read the M:0 stuff on the IMoJ closely (imagine - IG material
that might be almost worth the money I paid for it!).

  Incompetent we can live with, mostly :) Why not hire Imperial ex-service
sophonts or newts - they make great post-masters. If all such personnel are
corrupt/easily corrupted then the Rebellion really let the 3I off easily.

Well, picture the X-boat network as the equivalent of Reuters or AP for
news delivery, and that gives it a reason to stop at the worlds along the
network (and maybe sign up long term contracts). Indeed, the planetary
governments may sign up to a J6 network and *repress* the news they get
early to gain a political edge for their spin doctors.

Actually, I thought I caught a reference to an "Advanced Kinunir" project
in RSB or paging through GT, being started in the post-5FW era.  I assume
this is only to explain how there\'s so many Kinunirs flying around TNE/GT

The knowledge on this TML never ceases to amaze me.  Thank-you everybody 
for your responses on the Alpha Centauri/life question.

After asking the question I did some research on the net and found a 
host of differing opinions.  The most intelligent responses have been 
here (naturally) and have suggested life in that system would be 
difficult, although one or two seemingly educated people outside the 
group feel differently.  Note the web page:

http://monet.physik.unibas.ch/~schatzer/Alpha-Centauri.html

The only way we can be sure is to wait for the next xboat, that is if 
those involved in the courier debate feel the information is valuable 
enough to support the cost. :^)

  As Mr. Smith pointed out, the Mora-Rhylanor route takes 2 weeks at J-5,

  The X-Boats are fun, as long as I don\'t have an accountant or business

the sheer cynicism of the Imperium, but the 2.6 average would just blow

Class II:  Identifies all planetary and satellite bodies, and

Takes 2d6 weeks.

Class IV:  Fairly thorough examination of entire system.  All planets 
and satellites are mapped.  Landings and possible contact.  Takes 2d6 
months.

Class V:  Extremely thorough examination of entire system.  In-depth, 
long-term cultural study and contact.  Major dedication of resources.

The x15 cost has been consistently ignored for vehicular weapons, and I think
it might be stated explicitly in Star Mercs that you should do this.  The
breakpoint is probably 6,400 kJ, since weapons are half-weight below that
point.

Probably yes. NASA thinks its\' hypothetical space-based planet-finding
interferometer ("Terrestrial Planet Finder"), for launch in the 2010s or
2020s, could see Earthlike planets around sunlike stars out to 10 or more
parsecs - and that\'s at TL8. In the nearer term, a space-based 8-10m telescope
like the Next Generation Space Telescope could expect to see jupiter-like
planets out to tens of parsecs. Spacecraft sensors - at least in TNE/T4 - 
are bigger and better than either of those; optimized spacecraft sensors might
be able to detect many gas-giant planets out to 100 pc and earthlikes to 
20 or more pc. (Whether they could - for example - measure orbits precisely
enough to let you safely jump into a system is another question.)

It\'s possible. The model I\'m assuming is a bit different. I imagine
megacorporations not as huge, pondering, inflexible beasts, but the
equivlant of amalgamations of many smaller companies.

There is some evidence that this is one of the ways that huge, modern
corporations are choosing. For example, significant portions of 3M have
splintered into smaller companies to better focus on the tasks at hand. The
companies, as a whole, are still 3M though.

By my reasoning, a megacorporation would likely be made up of hundreds (or
thousands, or tens of thousands) of smaller companies. Some of these
companies might even be in competition with each other. So far, this model
is completely compatible with canon.

Now, the stock market. Individual worlds would have their stock markets.
Megacorporation branches on a world would be traded on  the stock markets of
these worlds. Normal corporations on the world, and larger corporations on
the subsector and sector level would also have stock traded if they had a
presence on the world.

At the subsector capital, there\'d be another stock market (or possibly
merely another layer of the stock market). The various megacorporations (as
megacorporate entities) would be traded, as well as all of the corporations
in the subsector. At the sector capital, there\'d be yet another stock market
(or another layer). Megacorporations would be traded, as well as sectorwide
corporations and the larger subsector-wide corporations.

The stock markets, in all cases would trade constantly. Maybe the planetary
markets might shut down for a few hours per Imperial standard day. Maybe all
might be forced by Imperial law to shut down for a few Imperial hours per
Imperial day. I\'m not sure. I envision around the clock trading though.

I don\'t know what the stock market would look like above the sector-wide
level. The concept is really mind boggling to think about.

So this is the model I\'m making my assumptions on. I\'m not positive that
it\'s completely compatible with canon, but I can find no canon that would
invalidate it.

While I realize the statistics back you up, I am surprised, because
there is at least one thing that is linked to lunar cycles, and that
is a woman\'s menstrual period, and I believe there _is_ evidence
that this has an affect on "mental health" in a broad sense.

Of course, while the cycle is linked, the linkage (and
synchronization) now may be completely out for most women, but I\'d
guees that the tradition may have started when there was a tighter
correlation between menstruation and the lunar cycle, and as there
is also evidence that women living in close proximity tend to
synchronize their cycles, I\'d say it would only take a few tribes
where all the women mentsruated in sync with the full moon, and had
significant mental problenms at the time for the legend to spread.

There\'s even some stories tying this into the werewolf legend.


I read somewhere that there is also a correlation betwen suicide
rates and the 11 year sunspot cycle, though obviously there was no
causal relationship mentioned

OBTrav : Do menstrual periods on long inhabited worlds become
modifed to match and local lunar cycles ?

What happens to them in cultures that live in space or on world
wwith no lunar tides ?

Reminds me of Earth 2, colud there be a long term problem living
solely in space in Traveller ?

David your figure of 33% is incorrect...The delay is 2X the time or 100%...
A J4 ship would have to make 2 jumps to get out to jump 6 from some
planet/star base/etc.  If you add up the time it\'s 4 weeks(+/-) round trip.
A J6 ship is out and back in 2 weeks(+/-) therefore it is a 100% increase in
time (2X) needed for J4 ship to do the same job...Granted the circumstances
would have to be just so for that to be case but it COULD be the case in
great number of places.

It is a one-shot affair, propelling four megajoules of plasma to a distance

Indications were also given that the weapon had potential for use against
battledress-equipped troops.\'

****************************************************************************

The weapon includes a 16 kg mechanism, a 0.01 kg action, a 9.6 kg EPG, a
2.6 kg bipod, a 0.2 kg Electronic Sights, 0.1 kg Wide Spectrum Visual
Goggles, and 1.4 kg worth of fibre-optic cable and aiming mechanism.

Note that recoil damping is not supported. The inch-thick Operators Manual
warns that FS will not be held liable for damage caused by users actually
holding the thing prior to firing.

The weapon is designed to be emplaced somewhere with a good arc of fire,
and the user links the fibre-optic cable to their HUD, while they go hide
somewhere. Once a suitable target comes into range, kerblowie.

In Traveller terms, Combat Engineering is probable the most suitable skill
for emplacement, and then High-Energy Weapons for firing.

A couple of rules were bent - there is no loading mechanism, no recoil
mechanism, and I made up reasonable numbers for the aiming mechanism and
fibre optic cable.

Current feeling is that life can from in a few 100 million years,
or shorter.  (There is some evidence of life at 3.9 billion years
ago and it is though the planet wasn\'t habitable much before 4.0
billion years).

It did take a couple billion years for mulicellular life
to form.  It isn\'t a sure thing that it alway has to take
that long.

  Which is why NASA\'s TPF and PI missions (planned) are to be _infrared_
interferometers. An avrerage star\'s photosphere is so hot that in IR its
radiation is markedly less dominating than in visible light. (The
radiation from the photosphere is quite close to blackbody, which peaks at
VL in these temperatures.) Also with interferometry comes the innate
ability to cancel the interference fringes caused by the central star
before closure phase (that\'s when the actual image is formed). in TPF\'s
case this is supposed to drop the star\'s brigthness to millionth part of
the original.
  The TPF claims to be able to resolve _terresteial type_ planets about
15pc away, of course it\'s still in feasibility study, but given funding
this could be just a few decades away. Imagine what one can do given
centuries, let alone millenia of development.

Actually, this all started with the claim that the
info on suspected smugglers would be given general distribution
at jump-6 (ie via a X-boat kind of network).

(In fact I still keep this original point in mind when I post.
Perhaps I\'m just wierd that way.  :-)

All I maintain is that it is reasonable that the general
method of information distribution is via the X-boat network
as presented.  There maybe exceptions (special courier for
certain organizations, events, etc), how extensive those
are depends on how you spin it.

FWIW I designed some X-Boats using FF&S1.

A J-4 M-1 X-Boat at TL-13 costs MCr 58.8 and has 45 DT of cargo space.
A J-4 M-1 X-Boat at TL-15 costs MCr 64.8 and has 49 DT of cargo space.
A J-6 M-1 X-Boat at TL-15 costs MCr 72.9 and has 38.5 DT of cargo space.

That means that a J-6 100DT courier costs 24% more than your basic FF&S1
X-Boat equivilent.

Having that bloody great disk overhead might cause some nervousness.
Perhaps someone better at math could tell me how much of Regina\'s sky is
taken up by Assinbola?  IIRC, Assinbola is a Size 60 GG, and Regina is 45
diameters out.

Connonically, there were (in MT at least), fast courier that
brought really important news to regional governments before the
populace got word of them (secretly).  But this is not the same
thing as network open to general use and suitable for diseminating
information generally....

The point is that yes, you have chosen a specific situation that
favors a jump-6 ships.  OTOH, if you have a route that is two
jump 4\'s then there is _no_ savings with jump-6.

Reminds me of the story about when the US sent some SEALS to cross train
with their French equivilants during some NATO manuvers.  They were from
Team 2.  The French word for seal is "Phoque".  The word for two is "Duex".
 The SEALS happily saluted French officers by shouting out "Phoque Duex,
SIR!"

Yeah. the "giant pac-man" was the _Tigress_. The flat boxes was a
_Plankwell_, IMO a much cooler ship. 

Fighting ships mentioned that the _Plankwells_ were named after
Imperial Admirals, Admiral Olav haut Plankwell being the namesake
for the ship-of-class due to his leadership during the First Frontier War.
He later became Emperor by to showing up at Capitol with his fleet
and saying "Gimmee." Interestingly, while there is a class of Battle
Rider named for Emperors of the Imperium, his name hasn\'t been
used on any of them...you\'d think they\'d have forgiven him for that
Civil War by now...<G>

Nope.  I may not use Ditzie\'s toys IMTU (as is my choice), but  I
kind of like the occasional Ditzie post.

Question for Ian:  Is "Famile Spofulam" written up anywhere?

I\'m considering doing these, but I recall somebody (I can\'t remember

patrol cruiser available. Do you remember who you are???

The question then becomes:  _Assuming_ a rationalization of the X-boat
system (as many have pointed out, a lot of X-boat stops are irrational),
how many stops are mandated by the (comparatively) short legs of J-4
couriers?  Not having a hard-copy map of any M:1100 sector (and my .gif
file of the Marches is M:1200, without X-boat routes), I can\'t venture
more than a WAG, but I suspect that about half the stops are based
either solely or primarily on the need to service J-4 ships.  If that\'s
the case, then going to a J-6 standard will eliminate quite a few
unnecessary stops (especially if the criteria for deserving a J-6 stop
are Type A or Type B starport, plus additional factors you choose to
indicate an Important World).

Having said this, I see no need to abolish the J-4X-boat network.

I view the X-boat (at J-4) network as the equivalent of the US highway
network prior to the construction of the Interstate highway system.  A
J-6 network would be the equivalent of the Interstate highways.  To
continue the analogy, many worlds/towns are not part of either system
(covered in Traveller by Type S scout/couriers, subsidized merchants,
and available free traders, and in RL by state/local roads).  There are
towns served by neither Interstate highway nor by US highway (to use an
example near to my home, the town of Brusly, LA).  Other towns/cities
are served by only the US highway system (St. Francisville, LA).  Baton
Rouge, LA (the sub-sector capital), is served by two Interstate highways
(I-10 and I-12), an Interstate system loop (I-110), and at least two
major US highways (US 61 and US 190).  It would be foolish not to build
Interstate highways when they become feasible, and equally foolish to
try to connect every small town with Interstate highways.  Were I the
referee in our current Traveller campaign, I would include a J-5/J-6
network to _supplement_ the J-4 X-boat network.  (As our campaign is on
hiatus, I haven\'t spoken to the referee about this.)

Further, I would expect that the Imperium has the J-6 equivalent of
Interstate highways, but connecting _only_ major Imperial military
installations and C3I nodes (imagine if the US Interstate highway system
only connected state capitals, major ports of embarkation, and military
bases with immediately-deployable combat assets).  Obviously, these
nodes would get news faster than anything on the civilian J-6 network,
and _far_ ahead of worlds relying on the J-4 (or less) networks.

Caveat distance [YMMV].

That is correct; it\'s Traveller\'s "Death Star" (or as I like to say the death
star is Star Wars\' Tigress...). Personally; I think that the 200 kiloton
Kokirruk is a much better BB as you get 2 1/2 of them for a single Tigress.
Down side is no fighters, but then again the price of the Tigress doesn\'t
include the fighters anyway. Lastly; I think the Plankwell (the flat boxes

IMTU I\'ve been dealing with this very problem. (late pre-imperial
M:0: I\'ve been assuming the change from TL-11 to TL-12 took place
about the same time Cleon was consolidating his rule, and no, I\'m
not going to start over rebuilding MTU if canon says differently)

   The larger military ships all have jump-1 drives with fuel
capacity for two jumps. (It also takes them some 6 weeks for such
a jump--two to jump and four to refuel, just because of their
size and the need to use frontier refueling.)
   Most trade ships are Jump-2 instead of jump-1, because the
internal markets are off the main or separated by worlds where
fuel is hard to get.
   I\'ve decreed that there are "iceballs" such as cometary nuclei
even in systems without a gas giant, so refueling is possible (I
want my J-2 scouts to be able to go take a peek and come back)
but it takes twice as long as normal to refuel from these. 
Desert worlds without gas giants but with spacefaring tech
capture and use these for refined fuel but fuel costs at least
twice as much as it does anywhere else.
   Has anybody done work on the economics of intra-system
hydrogen refinement and transportation? It\'s on my TTD
list...somewhere after design of intra-system tankers.  This ties
in to techniques of gas-giant refueling. I\'m undecided on the
relative merits of high-speed and slow-speed versions.

Don\'t you mean, after the *2nd* jump?

You\'re carrying fuel for 2xJ1 and your power plant.  You make your J1, do some 
drive checks, then do your 2nd J1.  Two weeks, plus the time spent doing your 
drive checks and recalcing your position, etc.  Call it a day or 2.

Depending on how good a jump number you can swing, you can always use tankers 
and/or drop tanks to make the trip.  I would *NOT* wanna try to cross the 
Great Rift in a J1 ship!!!!

OK, each jump means 1 week in jump space.  That\'s 2 weeks.  Where you coming 
up with the 6 week figure?  This I don\'t understand.

I don\'t get this, either.  While I have no probs with a Kuiper or Oort Belt, 
howcome refined fuel would cost twice as much?  Granted, getting there ain\'t 
gonna be a picnic, but still...

  It depends on various factors, including the size of your
exploration fleet, how far they have to go, and how long they can
stay out.
   As a rule of thumb, for your TL I\'d say two worlds per survey
vessel within three parsecs of the nearest base,  halved that
for each two parsecs further out. This counts travel time out and
back at a week in system between jumps to allow for fronttier refueling,
plus an average two months in a system taking a close enough look to
see whether it\'s habitable or already inhabited.
   This also assumes no losses due to hazards. Exploration can be quite
slow at TL 9/10.

* The GURPS Space combat system, a version of which is also in Compendium
II, is an abstract system for resolving space battles. It is analagous to
the High Guard system for Traveller, in that it handles large fleets and big
ships a little better (IMO) than the tactical system in GURPS Traveller.

TRANSLATOR\'s NOTES (not designers, since I didn\'t make this ship up originally);
This ship is severely underarmored from what it\'s Armor factor in High Guard
indicated it should be, which was around 18,000 DR in GURPS. The reason for
this, of course, is that it could not match it\'s performance stats with that
much armor. This leads me to believe that GURPS designed space combat
weapons badly outstrip the ability of ships built with the GURPS vehicles
system and designed for Traveller to defend against them. This ship actually
has more survivability in the GURPS Space combat system than it would in the
tactical game, I believe. In the alternate timeline that GURPS Traveller
represents, space combats are probably MUCH shorter and deadlier.

        Hi, Ian!
        Here is an odd question...  I don\'t see it spelt out any where in
HG, and you seem to be pretty savvy on all things Traveller.  What is the
ratio of defenses vs attacks?  In our one-shot-shipwrecker (OSSW)
discussion, can one battery of lasers engage an infinite number of missiles?
Or is it one battery vs one attack?  I have always figured it would be the
latter, by a couple of remarks people have made are making me wonder.
        The reason I ask, is because, obviously, if it is a 1:(Big Number)
relationship, then OSSW-type weapons *are* ineffective...  the defender
*can\'t* be overwhelmed until you\'ve beaten them up with something else...
at which point you might as well finish them off with it.  On the other
hand, if you have a 20-defenses ship, I need to fire 20+1 OSSW\'s at it;
probably cheaper than the ship\'s cost.
        I get the impression in G:T, a given mount can attack as many things
as it has ROF, which means that OSSW\'s are certainly a bad investment in
that system.  What about other Traveller variations?
        Apologies in advance for so many questions and so many odd-angle
discussions.....

This is actually *easy* to figure out. All you need is some simple
trig. Regina is 45 diameters out. So if we construct a right triangle
joining the center of Regina, the center of Assinbola, and the "edge"
of Assinbola, we have the line from Regina to Assinbola being 90 times
as long as the line that\'s the radius of Assinbola. So the *angle* has
a tangent of 1/90th. Which is .64 degrees. Times 2 to get the other
half of the planet = 1.27 degrees. This is much larger than the full
moon, but not especially large. It\'s about 1/40000th of the visible
sky. 

Try making a 1" circle and holding it 45 inches from your eye. A US
quarter or a Susan B. dollar are about an inch in diameter (one\'s a bit
under, the other is a bit over). *That* is how big Assinbola will be. 

BTW, 45 diameters out seems a bit much.

I know *just* the design. Since I don\'t have the design rules, someone
else will have to come up with exact figures and costs.

It was discovered back in the 20th century AD that the plasma column of
a flame could be modulated electromagneticly to act as a *very* high
fidelity sound output device. It was only a lab curiosity because the
flame had to be high purity. 

But it should be possible to build such a "speaker" around the exhaust
of a HEPlar of fusion rocket engine. The sound output would be directly
related to the *thermal* power output of the engine (hint the Space
Shuttle main engines are 46 gigawatts!).

Trust me, speakers with gigawatt (much less *terawatt*) outputs *will*
be heard regardless of whatever is in the way. 

I see two markets for such devices. The smaller ones (up to, say half a
million newtons of thrust) would be used by "rock bands" for mega
concerts. And possibly by dictators for PA systems for thier speeches.

The larger units will be used miltarily. Either for psych warfare, or
as sonic weapons. These things can produce the subsonic frequencies
that do various nasty things (epiletic seizures, nausea, even death).
Ditto for ultrasound. Only drawback is that (at least for the
subsonics) the sound pattern has to *center* on the "speaker", and
*can\'t* be shielded against. Thus they\'ll have to be operated remotely.

Check out the Sept 17, 1998 issue of Nature. There\'s a paper by a
couple of U of Arizona astronomers about using a "nulling
interferometer" to cancel the light from the star, but not from objects
around it. 

I read about it in the Jan 1999 issue of Astronomy. There\'s a nice
image showing the gas cloud around Betelgeuse with a nice dark dot in
the center where the star has been cancelled. They made it using two of
the mirrors from the Multiple Mirror Telescope.

So imaging planets *is* possible.

thinking about, but in order for us to seriously think of us in space we
should consider them. A series of conversations has gotten me thinking.
Now   for a few questions  that I think everyone should chew on when we look
at space travel. I am a woman, and now I am going to get personal.  I am
curious, does anyone know if nasa or anyone else has published information
on the effects to a woman and her cycles in space?
I am on depo provera right now and have never really paid attention to the
moon with my cycles. I don\'t have any right now. But how does space effect
those who are currently cycling? Is it a gravitational thing. I assume it is
like the tides.
One more thing. About mental health, I like I said am on depo provera (birth
control shot that prevents ovulation)  and therefor have no cycles, so that
does not have an effect on my mental health. I am however a diagnosed
bipolar (manic depresive)  with an anxiety disorder, and on a strict regimen
of medicine as of last year. I can say that when I look now at my health
history, the only correlations I find are...over the years when I have
become severely manic in the past, looking at a calender it happens to
coincide with the waxing of the moon. But that may just be coincidence,
seeing it is not a monthly thing. I am in a better mood during waxing, but
that may just have to do with some other hormonal factors that all women
have.
Are there any thorough studies out there? I have been looking out of
curiosity, and how would space travel effect peoples mental health? I know
nasa has to be thinking about this kind of thing. Anyone out there have any
ideas about mental health and space travel? How about women and travel?
Would a woman still cycle being jumped from one area  to another? If not
remember this, a woman is born with as many eggs as she will have all her
life, unlike men we do not continue making them, imagine a woman of 60 who
has spent a life in space not even close to menopause. How will this effect
women and the way they develop and act over  the years. How will it effect
our life cycles? One more bone to chew on, is there a correlation between
aging and menopause? Women in my family do not begin menopause until their
mid-fifties, and there are a lot of 90 something year olds in my family, do
these have anything to do with each other.

Just a lot of unanswerred questions.

I see. OK, here is my take on that subject: The basic routine information
that can, when correlated with similar data from other sources, expose
irregularities in merchant traffic would, IMO, go by staid old X-mail.
It would be months before it got collected (at subsector capital level)
and it might or might not be spotted (OTOH, I am convinced that someone,
propably several someones, would try to correlate it eventually. It is
just too useful and to easy a tool for fleet and insurance analysts not
to use).

However, fleet advisories ("Look out for SOLAR QUEEN, it\'s suspect.") and
warrants, as well as information of known infractions would go by fastest
available means (which may not be very fast from true backwaters) to the
nearest fleet base from where it _would_ be distributed by jump-6 couriers
to all fleet bases. From the fleet bases it would again go catch-as-catch-
can out to the most remote backwater.

No, you just didn\'t realize that my aside about the X-boat network was an
aside and not an argument in that discussion.

Assuming for purposes of argument that you had selected two planets with the
same TL for your example, there is propably very little that they couldn\'t
both produce. But that dosen\'t mean that they do. If it is cheaper to buy
imported grav cars from Mora than to build them themselves, Reginans will
buy Moran grav cars.

I have no problem with an ordinary level of human stupitity and error. Some
of my best game rationalizations are based on human stupidity. But I do have
a problem when the stupitity necessary to keep a situation stable for
decades seem to require that everybody involved works overtime on being
stupid.

Funny, it is precisely because I think a lot of powerful people would be
driving towards their own goals that the stranglehold over information that
the Emperor is claimed to have seems so implausible to me.

If there is a warrant out for a smuggler, the warrant must be valid under
Imperial law. If it is valid under Imperial law, a MoJ agent will serve it
and (IMTU at least) the navy will back him up.

If he is in the starport or in space the MoJ agent can serve the warrant.
If he is on sovereign planetary soil, he would apply to the local
authorities who might help him or not as they pleased.

Given what I know of police forces through time and space (most of it
gotten through reading fiction, admittedly) most authorities will accept
a valid warrant as, well, you know, valid. That is, arrest first and 
verify later. YMMV.

Such a car would not be the equivalent of a 40 year old Free Trader. More a

If the system gives you a saving of 25 weeks under ideal conditions, you
need to miss a lot of connections to make it less efficient than the
alternative.

Hmmm. I must go home an re-read what I have about the X-boats. I thought
that they provided weekly service. Is it really daily? And if it is, do
you have any idea of how much it must cost to run it? Try working out
the number of X-boats you\'d need for a single link. A weekly courier
network could be run with three ships per link, though admittedly with
no provision for accidents and misjumps, so four ships per link is
more plausible. But that wouldn\'t come anywhere near the cost of, what,
20 X-boats per link plus the tender?

>I agree there is a niche for point-to-point high jump courier routes,
>but I see them as complementing the X-Boat system.

So do I. But canon says the X-boats are the fastest available means.
That\'s what I\'ve argued against. Not the existense of the X-boats, but
that they are all there is.

This is scary, since High Guard combat was already pretty deadly (one
good meson hit would disable any target...). What it may also signify
is that the balance between PA weapons and MGs is upset, if you can\'t
carry enough armour to defend against even a cruiser-sized PAW...
(Similarly, at the low end, even small ships can carry enough armour
to defend completely against standard lasers, which is a problem,
especially since G:T has no "surface hit" category.)
Anyone done any battleship designs with G:T yet?

Nope. We designed a different ship, optimized for long-range anti-piracy
patrols.  Heavy redundancy on all major components, _lots_ of sensors, and
enough weaponry to blow the average pirate/Zhodani scout out of orbit.

Anything they _have_ published would be on the basis of zero data. IIRC,
Shannon Lucid is the only woman to have spent enough time in space to study
this, and being that she was 53 at the time, I suspect she was
post-menopausal. Oddly, this is one thing left out of her official NASA bio :-)

Actually, no, it is _not_ like the tides. While our bodies, obviously, are
affected by gravity, they are _not_ really affected by tides. The lunar cycle
correlation with women\'s menstrual cycles is not really firm, and may be
related to deep seated evolutionary patterns of behavior (and by deep seated,
I mean _really_ deep seated, back to the time when we were multi-cellular
organisms living in the tide pools...not that our lives are dependent on the
cycles of the tide any more, but evolution is a rather thrifty sort of
process, biological mechanisms are re-used in a host of different ways. Genes
find a way to keep themselves useful, and thus conserved.)

Mental health and space travel will have very little to do with space, per se,
particularly in the context of the Traveller universe, which doesn\'t have to
deal with extended periods of weightlessness.

 Mental health and being cooped up in a small metal box with no outside
stimuli...now, that\'s something we have _lots_ of information on; we\'ve been
doing that for decades, ever since nuclear submarines were invented. 

Cooping people up on small craft for months and months at a time has been done
ever since the invention of the ship. The Polynesians made epic journeys
through the South Pacific, in tiny boats, using only TL-0 starmaps as a guide.

We know a lot about keeping people sane when cooped up like that. Much of it
has to do with picking the right people to start with. ObTrav, this is done at
chargen, since any PC who can\'t Travel doesn\'t get very far. The other is
keeping them stimulated. In the Navy\'s case, this tends to be a) making sure
they\'re kept busier than hell and b) making sure that the parts of the
environment you _can_ control are varied, which is one reason why nuke subs
are reputed to get the best cooks in the Navy. ObTrav...I wonder how much of
the Low Automation typical in mil-spec ships are due to needing something to
keep the crew busy as much as damage control and decentralization?

More important to mental health is the regular rhythm of day and night.

In the absence of time signals, people\'s circadian clocks shift from the
24-hour to a variable number between (about) 18 and 32 hours. This has been
established with volunteers living for months at a time in stable,
time-reference free environment, such as well lit deep caves, which have
constant temperature, humidity.

These studies indicate that humans do have an individually variable circadian
rhythm. I would guess, however, that several humans living in close proximity
would settle on a common day/night cycle.

 This is akin to the well-known phenomonon that women living in _close_
proximity (like room mates), _tend_ (not invariably) to synchronize their
menstrual cycles, probably, we suspect, via pheromone signals. This is
probably an evolutionary adaptation to limit a human \'packs\' attractiveness to
predators (one of the things NOT to be doing in bear country is be having your
period...this is also known for other predators, including big cats). 

BTW, this susceptibility to predators is also the probable biological basis
for the practice in many cultures of segregating women having their period in
separate areas from the rest of the tribe. 

Dragging this back to Trav, the big thing facing Travellers will be the 53rd
Century equivalent of jet-lag, called (I say in a burst of utter
non-creativity ;-) jump-lag. You go in a week from someplace that has a 20
hour day, and 0.7 gee to one that has a 30 hour day and 1.3 gee. Much shorter
or longer, and people will start, I think, adapting in different fashions,
basically by keeping time on a different clock than the planet they\'re living
on, probably by manipulation of the immediate environment; basically, they\'ll
live in arcologies. Gravity you\'ll just adjust to.

I suspect one thing that occurs in a weeks jump is cycling the gravity from
the planet you just left to the one you\'re going to, _particularly_ if you\'re
going from lower to higher, and changing the day cycle to match the new \'day\'.

This won\'t be necessary for any trip where you might just unload, load, fuel
up and go...there you\'ll maintain some sort of constant ships environment. But
anywhere you plan on staying some time you\'ll be acclimatizing yourself.

This is a crucial thing for people like IN troops or Merc companies, which may
be in combat soon after arrival. This will lead, I suspect to pharmacological
and other adjustments. (Some current research has shown really odd things,
like shining light on the back of your knee can help you overcome jet lag quickly.)

I think he specified that "most ships" have fuel for just one J1.
IMHO 2xJ1 designs should be more common in early starfaring
settings where J2 isn\'t possible or feasible. J1 routes along mains require
reasonable development of the infrastructure.

   PE and IS give incompatible figures on how many 90,000 dton
top-of-the line battleships Sylea should be able to afford. After
some fudging I settled on a fleet of 10 plus about twice as
many 50,000 dton cruisers.
   These were designed as partially streamlined, but the very
thought of sending one of their capital ships deep into a gravity
well to do its own frontier refueling gives Admirals the
screaming heebie-jeebies.  (Military ships can\'t rely on purchasing fuel,
refined or otherwise, most places they go).  Routine operations
require a few dozen 10,000 dton fuel supply ships to go along with a battle
group to do the skimming and refining.  At a couple of days a
pass, it takes either a while or several tankers at once to top
up just one of the big fellows.  4 weeks is my SWAG for how long
"a while" is for a typical group.  Wartime conditions would speed
this up a little, but IMTU the war with the Chanestin kingdom
which will whip the Navy back into fighting trim hasn\'t started
yet.

Some corporate bigwig on a world that resembles Venus with less
atmosphere and doesn\'t have any gas giants handy decides water is
too scarce as it is to go pumping hydrogen by the ton into every
passing merchant, but he still wants them to come by.  He gets
the bright idea to fund a few tugs to go out and haul in an
iceberg or few from the outer system to somewhere near the
starport.  OK, who\'s gonna pay the overhead on this little
operation? Charging only twice as much as where you can just pump
water out of the nearest ocean into your refinery is a conservative 
guess.

Such lists coming by different routes tend to pick up strings of
amendments and amendments to the amendments and variations of
amendments to the amendments to the amendments.  This kind of
thing is what keeps textual critics employed, BTW.  I don\'t
believe there is any such animal as even an up-to-date starship

Relevant and reliable where it takes weeks to collect information
from a subsector means months and years before it gets back.  You
can combat large-scale and long-term crimes that way, but
"small", mobile, short term operations need different methods,
and are best handled at the local level.

or stolen property seems to be just too common for the Imperium
to give it much attention. There are a lot more things to steal
and a lot more ways to do it than piracy can account for.
As for serious crimes against persons...make that against nobles,
for the Imperium to get involved. Anybody else gets referred to
the local authorities, or if they don\'t have jurisdiction, the
local bounty hunter.

Which OTU? Which sector? When?
I don\'t have any problem considering places like the Glimmerdrift Reaches
to be out in the sticks compared to the Imperial core.

Again, it depends. For instance, whether Cr1000 is "a lot
of money" depends on whether you measure your weekly income in
tens of credits or millions.

Naturally, those are the kinds of post-war uses a government usually
intends, and it is what "honest" people do with them. Unfortunately,
privateering has an observable tendency to attract people with fewer moral
scruples than the general population. I\'d call it a substantial minority of
privateers that turn full pirate.

Pirates selling their own or a captured ship have problems getting good
prices because they have problems producing clear title and a ship in good
condition.  Semi-legitimate dealers want a discount for having to deal with
these problems themselves.  I wouldn\'t count on the areas outside the
imperial borders that don\'t ask questions to pay top credit, either.

IMO Killed, captured, and shipwrecked are the standard piracy retirement
options: retiring wealthy is something every pirate dreams of but few ever
do.

Hello all,

I\'m a long-time Traveller player (early 80\'s) that\'s been lurking on the
TML for only a short while.  In my "spare" time, I\'m a computer artist = (you
can see a couple Traveller images at my website), sculptor, 2d artist, = sfx
makeup artist, videographer, etc, etc.

I\'m going to shortly start creating vacuum formed & cast props of = Traveller
equipment for use by myself & some of my friends for use at SF = conventions
and for a private, independant (i.e. un-releasable) short film I want to
shoot based on one of the games that I\'ve run in the past.  Equipment
included will be battledress (or at least combat armor :), = PGMP\'s/FGMP\'s/PCMP\'s,
gauss rifles, and some other misc bits & pieces of kit.

My question for Marc is this:  Is it possible to sell these props to = other
TML\'ers & fans without licensing arrangements as long as they are not
marketed directly as Traveller Battledress, Traveller Gauss Rifle, etc?  = If
that is not possible, what about selling them for COG (Cost Of Goods) = only
compared to including labor?  And if THAT\'s not possible, can you please
contact me directly at one of the e-mail addresses listed below to = discuss
licensing?

My question for the rest of the TML\'ers out there, who by there very
definition are hard-core fans of Traveller, is if these are available,
would you be interested in purchasing them?  I\'m not looking at =
outrageous
prices (like $700 for a suit of Stormtrooper armor on the web), more =

by myself (kinda\' like websites :)  I\'d appreciate everyone\'s comments.

I could have probably given the ship the 18,000 DR, since there is a fair
amount of cargo space, by increasing the maneuver drive to the proper level;
I may even go back and do that now. But the purpose of what I was doing when
I built it was to do as close a conversion from CT as I could get. Different
systems will require slightly different optimization. But even with 18,000
DR, the PAW spinal mount listed in GT, let alone the one this ship has, will
tear through the armor pretty good.

	I believe that T5 will be the way to go, even though it will be a little
while before it arrives (Mr Miller says mid- to late 99)  This is due to the
fact that he is writing it himself, and refuses to release it until it is done
completely and with as few errors as is possible ( he is not willing to make
the same mistake that Imperium Games did by not editing, checking or
playtesting) before rushing release simply to have it on the shelf at GenCon.

	However, the GT supplements are also worth purchasing now.  Many of them have
almost no game mechanics in them...they are simply packed with info that can
be used with ANY Trav system.  One in particular is Behind the Claw...no game
rules or mechanics, just info on the history of the Spinward Marches,
including a write-up on EVERY world in the sector.

	This is all, of course, IMO.

I would phrase an answer to this as \'what is the difference between three
fac one missile attacks and one fac 2 missile attack\' ?

Ignore roolz for a second ... you are the Point Defense Officer on a
frigate. You see three missiles inbound. Now, from your perspective in your
crewstation, is this three attacks, or is it one attack ?

My personal solution for HG would be to have a \'partial\' result, when
either side gets within one either way of their target roll. A \'partial\'
result either halves the USP of the inbound (important for layered
defenses), or puts a +?3? on their damage roll.

I dunno if a Partial should count when dealing with the last missile.

Well, a \'standard\' laser fires once every 20 seconds, and the FS-designed
FFS2-compliant tech 13 Signature class laser has a rate of fire of four
shots in a ten second period. If we borrow the FFS2 Fire Direction Center
table and use it\'s \'correction delay\' number for indirect fire as the
\'correction delay\' for point defense fire, then you have a delay of 10
seconds at TL9, 5 at TL10 and negligible at TL11 and up.

I\'d say that means a standard laser can tag a lot of missiles, and a
Signature can tag shitloads.

Ditzie is drooling, but I *think* she wanted something she could put in her
chopper-wopper. A Heplar unit requires a fusion plant, and Uncie Hengie was
*quite* specific that only chemical power sources and batteries were
allowed (the whole idea of using rotors was to make a popup-capable
aircraft invisible to neutrino and gravitic sensors).

Well, everything FS builds is mostly legal under the appropriate design
rules. If you dont like the idea of a nine-gee fast extraction vessel with
3 gee of compensation, a Barbie-scale particle accelerator or a
grav-powered pogo stick capable of reaching low orbit (on Jupiter), fine
... but they can be built. OK, we might leave out the beam pointer on
Barbie\'s Own Particle Pistol, or not put in a loading or recoil mechanism
on the Plasma Bazooka, but any bending of rules is clearly indicated.

I like writing the Ditzie posts, too. Ditzie is one of my coping mechanisms
when my work gets more enmeshed in a web of self-delusion and doublethink
than usual (the performance figures for Job Network are Thing Man is Not
Meant to Know ... for this a half-billion was spent, an institution
destroyed, and the rule of law and the supremacy of parliament were
trampled on ?).

Some FS designs are on the THUDDD pages, but most of it is in the TML

Being cooped up in a metal box is an issue.  What people do in jump to keep
themselves occupied hasn\'t really quite been adequately addressed IMO.  I
wonder if small starship crews don\'t get sick of each other\'s faces every
once in a while.

Culture shock, and suddenly being moved to strange environments, could
cause problems.  I imagine depression would be a common problem in these
circumstances.  This would not necessarily be the same as bi-polar
"disorder" depression.

>How about women and travel?

Well, on a small ship, at least, I imagine their cycles would synchronise
very quickly...

> Would a woman still cycle being jumped from one area  to another?

Yes, I think.  Hormonal effects would probably outweigh environmental ones.
 It\'s also worth remembering that different women have cycles of different
lengths.  It\'s really only artificial influences like the contraceptive
pill that "standardise" them at any level beyond groups small enough to
cause synchronisation.

On going effects like changes to day-night cycles (and gravity?) will
affect the circadian "clock".  I\'ve got no idea what this will do to larger
cycles.

One of my feelings about full system generation is that almost all systems
will have multiple refuelling points - the odds of having more than one ice
asteroid, icecap, liquid water source or gas giant seem to be very high,
when all bodies in a system are generated.

I believe that almost no system will have no refueling sources.

First of all, hydrogen is a very common chemical. I believe that \'mining\'
hydrogen should be more than possible just about anywhere.

Well, this is where things get to the pointy end of the Piracy debate - and
just so that everyone is clear on exactly what us anti-Piracy people think,
we hold that piracy around mainworlds is uneconomic. Piracy well away from
mainworlds is more than possible.

Without risk premiums, it is fairly cheap to build a low-gee transport, to
take hydrogen from the refuelling source (gas giant, ice asteroid etc) to
the mainworld\'s starport.

However, whilst it is fairly simple to secure a single point against armed
civilian ships, it is nearing on the impossible to protect an entire system
from a single point.

In my opinion, fuel shuttles on interplanetary runs make good targets for
pirates, which means the shuttles need to be escorted by combat-capable
vessels.

Now, this increases the cost of transporting the hydrogen, to an absolute
maximum of the cost of shipping the hydrogen in from another mainworld, or
from the refining point to the mainworld via jumpspace (probably Cr 850 per
dton or so).

But I think in general, it would be cheaper to build a hydrogen mine than
to ship the fuel in from other points in the system.

Firstly, nuclear dampers need to be able to turn off fusion plus units.
This will pretty much exclude their use in line of battle, unless you are
fighting forces with no access to TL12 technology.

Secondly, active fusion plus units increase your chance of misjumping to
about 1 in 6. This should mean no-one will use them in starships to power
jump drives.

Fusion plus should therefore be able to be used in grav bikes, to power
civilian lasers and so on, but it should not be able to have any serious
military application, or to be used as the main power system on a starship.

I don\'t follow this.  Any partially streamlined ship can skim.  Warships are 
designed to be sturdier than civilian ships.  So where\'s the danger?  I just 
don\'t see it.  Warships are designed to survive *combat*.  A quick skim run?  
No problem.

Add to this, you\'d want your fleet to be able to refuel *fast*, to keep the 
momentum of your offensive going.  If you\'re gonna be bogged down a month and 
a half every time you jump, you\'re gonna be screwed blue & tatooed by the 
first fleet designed to skim and scoot.  They\'ll do an end run around you and 
nail your base while you\'re stuck at the gas pump.

In my HG interpretation (hopefully correct...) it is one battery per attack.
The key is the size (UPP #) of the battery compared to the UPP# of the missile
salvo. As an example a maxed out (factor 9) laser battery is 10 triple turrets
(30 lasers). A maxed out missile salvo (factor 9) comes from a 50 ton bay
(TL15) or a 100 ton bay (TL 14). Less tubes and/or less missiles result in
smaller UPP #"s. Thus a HG designer has a choice: more weaker shots, or less
stronger shots. Thus to figure out if your shipkiller missiles work or not;
you have to buy them in ENTIRE salvos....This one attack per salvo also works
with repulsors, which is fortunate, since a repulsor bay basically eliminates
a salvo automatically. What\'s even worse is that (damper and black globe)
screens attack EVERY Missile salvo that hits... I think I agree that the SS3
missiles shouldn\'t be used in HG; not because they can\'t, but because they
aren\'t cost effective (though a devious player might buy a few and wait for
defences to be knocked out...)

One would also have to look at how many cases do you have to jump
short because a jump-6 destination in the correct direction is
not available.  However, if the stars really are randomly
distributed, then, in the long run, it should come out in the
wash.

I\'m not an expert in the area, but as far as a I know, generally
the effects on mental health are dominated by being cooped up
in a metal box with limited contatct with society ofset buy
a busy, disciplined schedule and the fact that you are someplace
the most never get to go.

The only psychological effect of space travel that I know
of is that NASA has found that it is fard to read facial
expressions when poeple are floating in different orientations
(I participated in an experiment by some people studying this
on the floor below me).

You are correct in that it is currently believed that it was rise in
oxygen levels that allows for the formation of multicellular
life.

My undstanding is that this is thought to have occured about
2 billion years ago.  (But it somewhat depends on who\'s papers
you read).

All systems should have *some* "iceballs". But they may be

out.

Well, iceballs are likely to be a *much* cheaper method. Consider the
difference in cost between setting up a station on Europa or some other
ice moon, and having to constantly keep skimming Jupiter. 

On the moon, you have shielding from any radiation belts, you have
gravity, and you just need to supply a bit of heat and you can deal
with *liquid*.

Transport costs from the moon are slightly cheaper. First because you
don\'t have to use all the fuel required for the multiple skims, and
second, because you don\'t need to go as deeply into the gravity well.

If you are dealing with comets or leftover planetesimals in the far
reaches of the system, you lose the advantage of gravity. And the
transport costs will be higher. But they are several ways of dealing
with it. 

First thing you do is encase the body in a reflective "bubble". This
keeps it from evaporating as it gets closer to the star. Not only does
this avoid waste, but the gas jets that would otherwise form can have
significant thrust. 

Next you start digging in. The material will be ices, various organics
and rock dust. The ices will be water, ammonia and methane. You\'ll want
to seperate them as they boil off. Ammonia is *way* to valuable for
fertilizer and chemical synthesis to break down for hydrogen unless you
are *really* desperate. Nitrogen is one of the hardest to find life
support elements in space. 

Methane is useful too, and a pain to breakdown. All that carbon tends
to gum things up. 

So you store the methane, ammonia, and water seperately. And break down
the water for hydrogen as needed. You keep the oxygen. Note that with a
bit of care and use of the reflective shielding, you can store all of
these as *solids*. 

The other organics will range from traces (in "ice" asteroids) to a
major component ("carbonaceus chondrite" asteroids). They are
*definitely* not worth breaking down for hydrogen, but they\'re
invaluable for chemical synthesis and as a source for carbon and
nitrogen for life support. 

Finally, there\'s the rock dust. Other than running it past a magnet to
seperate any nickel/iron it\'s not worth processing. So it makes good
reaction mass. Use a mass driver to throw bucket fuls of it away at
high velocity. It won\'t get you moving very fast, but it will get you
headed for the inner system. 

As you approach the inner system you can deploy a solar sail to steer
you into a good parking orbit. By this time, you\'ve likely "refined"
the entire body, and can sell pure water, oxygen, LH2, methane and
ammonia. Also you\'ll have a good stock of organics and likely some tons
of nickel/iron "dust".

It\'ll almost certainly take *years* to move the body into the inner
system. It\'s not worth it to move it in any faster. You wind up eating
into the profits by burning up too much of the body.

But since it\'ll take at least a dozen people to efficiently erect the
bubble and handle the rest of the tasks (and several dozen might be
better) I can see a prospector locating a suitable body, and selling it
to a group who then go out and bring it in. But *while* they bring it
in, they\'ll be living on it and turning it into a habitat. 

On the long trip in, it\'s "home". And they\'ll get visitors from tankers
coming out to trade supplies for the ices and organics. But tankers
aren\'t going to move a significant chunk of a body miles across, even
if it takes 20 years to bring it in. 

Once they settle into the final parking orbit, they\'ll have a basic
space habitat with *huge* "tanks" of water, etc. 

So I\'d picture a system accumulating "L5 colony" type habitats as ice
bodies are brought in and converted. By the time they run low on ices
to sell they\'ll have had the habitat\'s biosphere running well for a
century or so. And they can trade food for things they need. 

BTW, I\'ll be willing to bet that space colonies trade food for "life
support sludge" (ie "concentrated sewage" :-) on a weight for weight
basis. That\'s *required* so that they don\'t lose valuable organics. The
money and other items will be in *addition* to this.

Top price, no. 50% of fair value, probably. 30% of fair value, certainly.

The problem for pirates in the Marches, IMO, is not in cooking the pigeon,

But I\'ll back it up, "Behind the Claw" is definitely worth it for
all the great little anecdotes about the Domain of Deneb and the
history of the region.
Maybe people who have purchased a lot of BITS stuff may have seen
most of it, but this does collect it all together in one place.

Even the GT rule book has more information in it than rules, and I
felt it worth getting. I always suggest the hardback over the
paperback though, all GURPS paperback books are badly put together
in comparison to, say, White Wolf paperbacks.

Not so sure about the Aliens Supplement yet, haven\'t seen it, and I
already have most of the old "Alien Supplements" and also the Space
Opera book the new ones are supposed to come from, so we\'ll see.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been reading Adam Smith\'s Wealth of Nations recently.  Still not
certain how much I agree with him, but I\'ve read enough to discover how
much he\'s misquoted by the neocons who run large corporations.  For
example, this is his take on sources of income:

"There are three parts of produce and three original orders of society.
The interests of the proprietors of land is inseparably connected with the
general interest of the society. So also is that of those who live by
wages, but the interest of those who live by profit has not the same
connection with the general interest of the society."

In more detail:

"The whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country, or what
comes to the same thing, the whole price of that annual produce, naturally
divides itself, it has already been observed, into three parts; the rent
of land, the wages of labour, and the profits of stock; and constitutes a
revenue to three different orders of people; to those who live by rent, to
those who live by wages, and to those who live by profit. These are the
three great, original, and constituent orders of every civilized society,
from whom whose revenue that of every other order is ultimately derived."

Concerning those who live by profit:

"The plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all
the most important operations of labour, and profit is the end proposed by
all those plans and projects. But the rate of profit does not, like rent
and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension, of the
society. On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor
countries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going
fastest to ruin. The interst of this third order, therefore, has not the
same connection with the general interest of the society as that of the
other two. merchants and master manufacturers are, in this order, the two
classes of people who commonly employ the largest capitals, and by their
wealth draw to themselves the greatest share of the public consideration.
As during their whole lives they are engaged in plans and projects, they
have frequently more acuteness of understanding than the greater part of
country gentlemen. As their thoughts, however, are commonly exercised
rather about the interest of their own particular branch of business, than
about that of the society, their judgement, even when given with the
greatest candour (which it has not been upon every occasion), is much more
to be depended upon with regard to the former of these two objects, than
with regard to the latter....  The interst of the dealers, however, in any
particular branch of trade or manufacturers, is always in some respects
different from, and even opposite to, that of the public. To widen the
market and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the
dealers. To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the
interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be
against it, and can only serve to enable the dealers, by raising their
profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own
benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens. The
proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this
order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought
never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined,
not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.
It comes from an order of men, whose interest is never exactly the same
with that of the public, who generally have an interest to deceive and
even to oppress the public; and who accordingly have, upon many occasions,
both deceived and oppressed it."


How does this relate to Traveller?  Well, IIRC Marc mentioned that he
modelled Traveller economics on the mercantile system, which is what Smith
is describing. While Milieu 0 seems to be firmly in the grip of the \'third
order\', IMTU by 1200 the bulk of Imperial officials are nobles, and thus
from the first order.  The purpose of a fief is to provide the noble
independent income, so that they can withstand blandishments from "those
who live by profit".  (The attitude towards merchants in "Mote in God\'s
Eye" and "King David\'s Spaceship" are typical IMTU.)

I\'m certain that those of you who\'ve studied economics have seen this
before, and can no doubt explain it better than I can, but I thought I\'d
throw in the viewpoint of a man who wrote during a period much like
Traveller\'s.

One of the assumptions was that Hydrogen is the most populous matter in the
universe.  Given a large rotating blob of matter, some of it will combine
due to gravity, eventually forming a star.  As the rest of the matter
collides with itself, it starts forming planets.  However, inside the "ice
line" hydrogen doesn\'t stick so it just sort of blows past rather than
adding to the mass of the planet.  Beyond this "ice line" it is cold enough
that it\'s no longer gaseous and thus sticks together.  Right after this
"ice line" you can expect a large Jovian body where most of the liquid
hydrogen is able to form.

I think the point is that only young systems will have no "easy"
refueling.  For these systems only the rocky planets close to the star will
have had time to coalesce from the accretion disk.  For these young
systems, the hydrogen is out there, but it is so spread out that it would
take a prohibitively long time to gather it.

in jump space each way - you\'d see only three or four ships per
leg (including spares), there would be a lot more in service.

Interesting. It hadn\'t struck me before that at any given moment,
the majority of active duty x-boats are in jump space.

I would say that even the X-boat system has main lines and backwater
lines. The main trunks probably have daily service all along them,
the lines that feed of it become progressively slower as message traffic
ebbs.

 No problem. >>

Check out Supplement 5; AHL. Though they\'re partially streamlined; they use
fuel shuttles for mormal refueling. The book stated that skimming was
dangerous for AHL\'s and they only did them in emergencies. There is a section
in the book that allows for die rolling to prevent fuel tank damage; losing
shuttles (moored externally I guess; though HG design rules require hangers
that need displacement tonnage-ie volume); maneuver drive damage; or even that
all time favorite-loss of control and a one way trip to the bottom of the
gravity well....PC\'s can use their appropriate skills as DM\'s. 

Thus, the AHL is the only CT and MT semi-streamlined ship that has this
problem. She is quite a "canon-breaker". She is also (along with the Gazelle)
the only ship with external small craft, in a rule system with no external
craft design rules! (though HG IMPLIES that dispersed structure ships are
built that way-they can launch EVERYBODY simultaneously, but still require
volume dedicated to these craft-what a gip!!). Unfortunately; I am "New Era

No way she\'ll get such a system into the chopper. The power required
just won\'t fit. But since unshielded personnel could get *killed* by
the thing, she might be able to build one around a chemical rocket
engine (I don\'t think jet engines reach the power levels she needs). 

I\'d say it has to be some sort of drone vehicle. And it can\'t use the
"speaker" while in flight (the sound output bounces it around the sky
too badly)

A modified ramjet engine *might* work. There *are* ways to make
ramjets start in "still" air (mostly by doing something to force air
down the throat). 

I\'m leaning towards "Vox Deus" (voice of god) as the name for this
item. "Divine Thunder" is another contender.

Lots of luck on Mercury or Venus. Mercury is definitely very poor in
volatiles. And "skimming" from Venus would be a *major* undertaking.
It\'d take a *long* time to collect enough hydrogen to do you any good.
The surface is too hot to retain any hydrogen and the temp & pressure
making landing out of the question anyway.

The moon *may* have some minable ice. Mars does have ice. The question
is how much is water and how much is CO2, as well as how "dirty" it is.

Remove Earth and Mars from the Solar system and you\'d have to go clear
to Jupiter to find a practical source of hydrogen.

But it taks a *long* time to transport any significant amount. You
either need a *lot* of ships in the "pipeline", or you need to be able
to move the source closer to the port. Neither is cheap. Operating
costs will eat you alive. 

Just work out trip times from the gas giant and how much hydrogen you
can haul. Then figure how much is likely needed. You\'ll wind up with a
virtual conveyer belt of ships.

If the planet is at least as warm as Earth, and has no hydrosphere, you
can be fairly certain that the planet hasn\'t retained enough hydrogen
to be "minable". 

There\'s a *reason* most of the hydrogen winds up in the gas giants.

They\'ve found that *some* cycles are affected by exposure to light of a
given intensity. There have been tests of using *bright* lights to
reset the circadian rythms. 

So that will handle the "jet lag" problem of synchronizing ship\'s time
with port time. 

BTW, I do *not* see ship\'s adjusting their "day" to match the
destination. That\'s because except on really small colonies, there will
be multiple time zones. Synchronizing with the zone of the port won\'t
help folks travelling to some other part of the planet (or to a
different planet in the system!).

What the ship will likely do is shift time while it\'s docked or landed.
Then revert back to "Universal Time" while underway.

Take a look at the CT Subsidized Liner and Subsidized Merchant. For
smaller starships, it wasn\'t necessary to specify whether a carried
craft was internal or external - and "volume" seemed to apply to what
you carried into jumpspace (or what you built your M-drives to move
around and power plant to support). Drop tanks are, in a sense, an
externally carried craft, and the CT rules simply had them add volume
directly. Though the cost issue arises - if 95 tons of your 400tn ship
is an externally carried shuttlecraft, why are you paying Kcr1/ton
to build those 95 tons of hull? Must be the external sling mounts.

Morgan of Hed used something called the "Great Shout" (IIRC) to split
a set of multi-story high stone doors in the "Riddle of Stars" series.
 (Reminds one of I Thes. 4:16, "For the Lord himself shall descend
from heaven with a shout,..." That verse also calls it the "Trump of
God")

Look, SwordWorlder, there are two things you *really* need to know.

#1, Ditzie is a girl.

#2, she works in Famile Spofulam\'s High Energy Solutions division, and is
currently working on a Plasma Chain Gun, to go in the chin turret of the
new TL12 Combat Helicopter. The helicopter\'s main gun is a 100 MJ plasma
gun, that should be capable of penetrating 40 cm of superdense.

Now, calling her a boy may or may not offend her.

Personally, I would not risk offending anyone insane enough to even
*consider* putting a high megajoulage plasma gun *on a helicopter*.

PS If you are mounting a number of plasma guns in a gatling-gun type array,
should you only need one autoloader for the EPGs ? A small, insistent, and
heavily armed mind wants to know.

1.  I don\'t have a copy of AHL.

2.  We can assume that the AHL would launch all the small craft *BEFORE* 
skimming.  One could assume that even a AHL captain isn\'t *stupid*.

3.  HG rules for hangers states that the hangers are internal.  Only Dispersed 
Structures just bolt the hardware on the frame.

4.  If its tankage is *that* delicate, how can it be expected to stand up and 
fight a battle??

The \'volume\' dedicated to external small craft under HG is so that you can 
determine its final volume and thus its overall performance.  Otherwise, it 
would be totally \'legal\' to design a 100 ton J6 boat and hang 1000 tons of 
stuff on its hull for a quick cheap J6 boat.

        When we (HMCS Restigouche) came home from the Gulf, we went through
that area.  The buggers were using cigarette boats with 20mm cannon on them
to slow an intended target and biz copters to rappel commando squads onto
the deck.  The commando squads could be expected to be equiped with Uzi\'s or
H&K\'s and *cutlasses*.   Apparently the month before we went through, some
Greek captain had tried to resist and they\'d taken a piece out of him with one.
        We closed up 2nd degree of readiness for the transit through the
area, and put flood-lights to illuminate the 3."75\'s and the Harpoon boxes,
and the Maple Leaf on the stack ("No, this is NOT a merchant.  Go Away.").
I remember the Combat Officer briefing the CO that if we were attacked, he\'d
bring the "A" system (3"75\'s) online...  he didn\'t expect to hit them -
that\'s be the waist 30mm & .50cal\'s - but he figured one two-barrel
five-shot volley at night (MUZZLE FLASH) would convinced them to annoy
someone else. =)

IMTU, the twelve xboats are, as it states, present at one time. So
Glisten/Glisten, a high-tech high-pop world, might have twelve xboats in
the system, with each one departing at some time during the day.

Each xboat jumps to a neighboring system, refuels, and jumps back. So
it\'s gone for two weeks. 14 days times 12 xboats per day means that
Glisten has 168 xboats assigned to it by the Scouts.

If you send an xmail message from Glisten, it leaves within hours of
receipt by the Scout Service.

Picture all these xboats leaving from Glisten in a given day. Picture
them arriving at the next world and transmitting their information to
the next xboat, which then jumps. Picture that next world only having
two or three xboats, so sometimes the incoming xboats must wait days for
an outgoing xboat to become available.

Each world in the xboat chain must have the same number of xboats, lest
there be bottlenecks in the flow of information.

It hasn\'t come up yet IMTU, but if it does, I\'ll rule that there are 2D
xboats in system (regardless of tech level or population), and that
number will change every few hours.

        I don\'t know if I\'d build fighters that way, if only since a
streamlined fighter would be more useful, IMHO, but I can see in-system
workhorse craft built this way.  That was something I always liked about the
"Eagle" was that it *looked* like something a terran would build.

 Then why go there without jump? I have seen no canonical references
forbidding an insystem jump. Even if the microjump takes the standard
week you\'d save some major time, and since fuel consumption _does_ depend
on distance, youd probably save a lot of fuel too.

 As already stated, a single large comet moved insystem will supply a busy
highport for years, and the money you can get from all those trillions of
tons of fuel (and other usable chemicals) far outweighs the cost of
strapping a few ion engines to a comet and lobbing it into a Hohmann
trnsfer orbit insystem.

 I can also see manned refueling stations built into a system\'s kuiper
belt to refuel passing ships that have no interest in the mainworld. (And
if you want insystem, you can always spend a week in microjump.) These
station could also do some actual trade themselves. The methane, ammonia,
nitrogen and (according to recent studies) aminoacids in the cometary
sludge are indeed valuable trade commodities.

 There\'s _not_ going to be a single mainworld with more than a hundred or
so inhabitants that has no water at all on it. The sheer cost and
logistical difficulty of providing oxygen for thousands let alone millions
of inhabitans from offworld sources makes such an undertaking ridiculous
even as an idea.

Uh, Hi Dttzie,

I picked up  your transmittion, quite by acceident I assure you, while

it gets awfully lonely out here in the oort cloud. In my opinion, by it\'s

original gatling was fed from a single hopper, as the barrels passed. I can

It is an MT design with staged power plants - it uses a lot of the

*DUMB*.

If you got multijump fuel capability, you only go in part of the way.  This 
gives you a \'get the hell outta here\' capability if you screwed the pooch.  
You jump in with the fallback position already locked into the computer, fed 
with continual updates on the solution at say, 1 cbt turn intervals.  For 
instance:

Your fleet is J4.  Your fallback position is 1 parsec from the target.  Move 
to within 3 parsecs, refuel, and take your target.  If you gotta break off, 
you deedee straight to the fallback position, which your supporting squadron 
has just spent over a week securing in force.  The bad guys come after you, 
you \'bush \'em with your reinforced task force.  *Your* reinforcements come 
forward, refuel, and everybody goes back and hits your original target again.  
Unless he\'s been reinforced bigtime, you should be able to knock him over.

So outer moons instead of cometary nuclei? That makes it a little
bit easier than I was thinking. It\'s quite possible that I\'m
underestimating the difficulties of comet-catching: refueling at
some larger icy body closer in to the mainworld does make more
sense.

Not necessarily. I mentioned in my world-building posts a while
ago that small and hot worlds tend to lose their hydrogen
containing compounds quite rapidly. In the outer system anywhere
maximum temperatures stay below freezing, ices of some variety
should be fairly common.  Mainworlds with a UWP indicating 10%
water or less might easily find on-planet water expensive enough
and slow transport from the outsystem cheap enough to make ice an
important commodity in interplanetary trade. I can\'t quite see it
in interstellar trade unless you have something like a water
world just one parsec from a desert world.

And what is a pirate going to do with 200 dtons of ice or
whatever?  I\'d leave incoming bulk commodities alone and target
the outbound runs taking equipment and luxury goods to the
various outposts.

Is your "mine" within a day\'s flight of your starport? If not, I
suspect you\'re better off shipping fuel than making merchants go
get it themselves. For merchants with a schedule to meet, time is
money.

Outsystem operation is a mainstay of the less than reputable and the
military/police keeping them suppressed. It\'s probably as easy in the
outworld areas to catch (land on) a comet as it is to catch an asteroid.
Comets in the outsystem aren\'t as affected by solar winds as they are
closer to a star, so there isn\'t any flyoff choking your navigation.

First thing I\'d hit if I were interdicting a world is to cut off their fuel
supply.

Pirate may need to hit a fuel shuttle or two just for the fuel. Their
wouldn\'t be any profit in it, but it would prevent them from having to
refuel in trafficed (and patroled) areas.

This isn\'t a terrible assumption. Fusion rockets have an enormously uncertain
fudge factor in their performance: the efficiency, expressed as the percentage
of hydrogen in the fuel that gets fused as opposed to the percentage that
is injected unfused. The fusion rockets in FFS2 assume a (not alltogether
ludicrous) 10% or so, I believe. (Not that anyone calculated things that way;
the number in FFS2 just comes from the FFS1 number, with (as Dave says) ten
times higher fuel consumption to make them less useful than the higher-tech
HEPlaR. 

As I think about it, I can\'t think of any good reason why the efficiencies
for a Bussard ramjet would be the same as for a straight-up fusion rocket - 
among a million other things, the fusion rocket probably gets to burn
D/T enriched fuel.

I mentioned this in my "Nature of Hydrogen" post.  Gas Giants won\'t form until you
go out past the "Ice line"  The "Ice Line" is out beyond the habitable zone of a
star.  However, Gas Giants can put out some heat so the moons could be in the
habitable zone of the Gas Giant rather than the star itself.

That\'s all fine and dandy, but the definition of J-o-T in the latest

Now, if I have NeededSkill-1 but I need NeededSkill-3 to attempt the

Is using J-o-T to negate the penalty not introducing an inconsistency in
the rules?

Possible, yes.  Likely?

I can seense some misconceptions lurking behind your explanation, but I\'m
too tired right now to try and clear them up.

The canonical model for planetary formation claimed that gas giant worlds
would only form at relatively large distances from their primary stars (outside
the "ice line" as Joe Pettit says.  Unfortunately for the canonical model, we\'ve
detected a number of cases in the last couple of years where a planet of Jovian
mass exists *very close* to the primary -- far inside the "ice line."  I have yet to
read a convincing reconciliation of this with the canonical model.  In any case,
that would suggest that gas giant worlds can sometimes  take up stable orbits
in the life zone.

It\'s possible for a gas giant\'s moon to be large enough to hold an atmosphere.
We have a couple of examples in the Terran system, after all.  Presumably
a gas giant in the life zone could have a moon large enough to have an
oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.  My gut feeling is that this would be an unlikely
situation, however.  The largest moon in the Terran system (Ganymede) has
only about 2.5% Earth\'s mass. . .

So how common is the situation you\'re asking about?  Unknown.  Insufficient
data.

You\'ve seen MTUs wilderness refueling rules, haven\'t you?  Almost entirely

The only reason the AHL would be skimming is if it\'s fuel shuttles were
damaged/destroyed or maybe if it\'s too dangerous to use them... A skimming
under that kind of duress is difficult for me to imagine under CT, though more
than plausible w/ a HEPlaR assumption (as of course, i am under). ; )
Besides, there is only a risk of this due to "severe atmospheric buffeting"
incidents.

There is no reason why grapples should be unfeasable except maybe the
canonical "jump grid" networked wiring mentioned in the Jumpspace article by
Marc Miller (from JTAS?) and currently on Kagehira\'s AAB, (especially as
opposed to the uncanonical DGP jump grid).  Even these need room for the
windows, turrets, antennae, the maneuver drive, etc so why not an external
craft?

Delicate compared to the stress caused by the same "severe atmospheric
buffeting" incidents caused by the flight through the turbulent atmosphere of
a gas giant.  Aren\'t the fuel tanks intended to serve as a "cushion" in HG/CT?

Canon says that the X-boats are the "fastest available means?"  I don\'t see
anything that says that.  Just that it\'s "designed to make optimum use of jump
technology" (which isn\'t necessarily false).  Whether a J6 X-boat network is
economical (and thus "optimum") or not... It would depend on an economic
analysis I don\'t think is possible due to insufficient (and unwanted, for
some) information.   But we don\'t want to debate *that* again, do we? ; )

In the ref\'s section for the MT Imperial Encyclopedia, it would seem your
theory on the bureaucracy using the naval courier "network" might be correct,
Hans.  I don\'t if it\'s been pointed out or not, as I haven\'t followed this
thread closely but: "Knowing vital facts before they become general knowledge
is essential to a well-run bureaucracy."  pg 49.  Course maybe i\'m being too
literal? ; )   It also depends on the definition of "bureaucracy" and even the
casing of such, no?

IMTU, the Emperor had good reason to be wary of an increasingly corrupt
bureaucracy.  Above this, J5 & J6 was restricted and required heavy permits
(and not allowed for even a sector wide service, which could/would blatantly
reveal the control system that was the Express-boat network), moreso than
lower jump drives.  The Emperor\'s share (and control) in the megacorps ensured
they didn\'t violate this,either.   They want a private system like the
Imperiallines operation, that won\'t spill the beans and would remain under
wraps, fine, as long as they keep it quiet (and \'secret\' ala Imperiallines)
and, of course, the possible presence of an INI
"representative"/watchdog/monitor.  : )  Any that violate the Emperor\'s wishes
might find themselves going the way of the Zhunastu Corp.  ; )

Is there anything in canon to violate any of that?

*WHAT* pursuing combat ships?  You refuel after you *WIN*.  If you gotta

Maybe you hope no one is crazy enough to dive as deep into the gas
giant as you just did? If they lose track of you, the mess and noise
in a gas giant\'s neighborhood may well keep them from finding you
again until you are close enough to ten diameters to make a running
exit fight out of it.

The AHL board game had a scenario aboard the wreck of an AHL
(_Bard Refuge_?) that tried this stunt and had the bad luck of running
into a flight of SDB\'s, which got in a lucky drive-disabling shot.
Whether spacesuited characters could survive on the decks of a ship
floating tail-down in a methane sea on a gas giant is another question.

AHL\'s usually did one to three parsec jumps, keeping a fuel reserve
for when they jumped into the teeth of something nasty. If you jumped
away from one enemy fleet and into another, you did what you could.
These babies were deep penetration raiders, they didn\'t belong in the
same system as enemy line-of-battle units.

Isn\'t the Ice line under some fire after the recent discovery of what

Let\'s do some back-of-the-envelope calculations.

The ocean surface of Earth covers about 139 million square miles.  Assume
an average depth of about one mile and we get about 2 x 10^19 cubic feet of
seawater . . .that works out to about 5.6 x 10^20 liters.  An old earth-
sciences text I have handy gives about 110 grams of hydrogen per liter,
so we get 6.16 x 10^22 grams or about 6 x 10^16 metric tons of hydrogen.

My guess is, you could refuel a squadron of dreadnaughts every day for a
thousand years and not make a noticeable dent.

You know, I\'d never considered this before.  Getting your LHyd from seawater
strikes me as, well, *safer* than ramming yourself through a Jovian planet\'s
atmosphere. . .

There are actually models that show a gas giant could retain significant
atmosphere (like all of it) even around the orbit of mercury; gas giant
gravity is a mighty force. 

The reason for these models is that there are half a dozen systems with
observational evidence (indirect, but good) of jupiter-mass planets with
orbits of 0.05 to 2 AU.

What isn\'t well known is how to *form* a gas giant at those separations.
Most models form the gas giants out at the edge and then shuffle them in
(though near-collisions or tidal drag.)

Or the gas giant could form past the "ice line" and get shuffled into the
habitable zone by close interactions with another gas giant, or by tidal
drag from the protoplanetary disk. Whether moons would survive such an
operation is another question, but they could be recaptured afterwards...

Under CT/HG, hulls are assumed to be rigid enough to handle an atmospheric 
flight unless they\'re nonstreamlined.  Under CT/HG, even semistreamlined hulls 
can skim.  AHL\'s are considered semistreamlined.  So what\'s the problem?

That\'s because the hangers are a shirtsleeve environment so you can do 
maintanance on the small craft during jump.  Dunno bout *you*, comrade, but 
*I* ain\'t getting out on the hull during a jump to work on something.

No, they\'re not.  And I\'d guess that a good hot combat would be inherently
*more* stressful than a skimming run.  There would be lots of jinking around,
and inertial compensating is *not* part of the fuel tankage.  I saw a reference
for that under CT, but I\'ll be damned if I can remember *where* I saw it.  This
means that the fuel is going to be sloshing around all over the place,
irregardless of any baffling.  If the tanks were so delicate that they
couldn\'t survive a skimming run, then they wouldn\'t survive a combat.

Besides, a hull has the *same* armour value all over, and main fuel tankage
is *internal* to the hull, thus under the armour.  All of which tells me that
if the ship can\'t survive a skimming, it has *no* business in combat in any
way shape or form.

Yeah.  It would be much safer.  Unfortunately that seawater is probably on
the main world of the system.  You know the one?  The one with the deep

Mind you, ice might be more viable.  I suspect you would be more likely to
find it in out of the way locations.

Look.  You jump into a system.  You might *not* have jump fuel to get back 
out, but you *do* have powerplant fuel, which means you have manuvering 
capability.  If you jump into a hot system, you still have plenty of time to 
fight and win before you have to refuel.  If you get within 10 diameters and 
pick up a couple enemy SDB\'s inside the gas giant, so what?  You\'re looking at 
SDBs on the order of what, maybe a kiloton each?  Against a 60 kiloton ship?  
Why are you worried about them?  A 60 kiloton starship can brush aside a 1 
kiloton SDB no problem.  If you find yourself down to 3 to 1 throw weight, 
abort the skim and use another gas giant.  This means the bad guys have to be 
able to field at least 20 kilotons of defenders.

I don\'t see that as a likely happening.  How much metal do you have to throw 
at an AHL in order to guarantee you take it out and still get back home?

Still, the ships had enough armour for hull rigidity, as well as fuel scoops 
for skimming.  Just use the damned things.  Hell, even 200 kiloton Plankwells 
have scoops and can use \'em.  What makes an AHL such a hanger queen?

For a Hydrographic percentage of zero, think Sahara desert. Not

    I\'ve had notions of putting a refinery out in orbit a safe
distance away from a GG. [Insurance carriers will love you for
it, though cash-strapped merchants might not]. Maybe have RP
drones do the skimming.  Even better, if there\'s an icy moon you
can put the refinery there and leave the GG itself safely alone.
    I\'d also seriously consider running strings of RPVs from the
refinery to the starport (What is there for a crew to do except
at the ends of a run?). Terrestrial systems prefer pipelines for
this kind of work, but I don\'t think a pipeline with ends in
relative motion and several AU long is going to work. I\'d expect
a good TL and a severe shortage of hydrogen on the mainworld to
be prerequisites for insystem shipping of it anyway.

There is also the comet-grabbing option. Take a couple of decades
to steer a suitable object into a suitable solar approach orbit.
(Mountain sized objects are hardly renowned for their
maneuverability). Wait several more for gravity to bring it in.
Relatively cheap if you\'re in no particular hurry.

Or this might be the Traveller version of towing icebergs to LA.

   Surviving meson, PAW, and laser fire is a completely different
matter from handling gravitational and atmospheric stress on the entire
hull. These beasts don\'t ever make landfall. Where and how are you going to
park something that size if you do get it down to the ground? Are you

    SF capital ships don\'t have the 3g+ worth of maneuver drive to do slow
speed skimming. Recent design philosophy has emphasized armor and firepower
instead. A couple of well-remembered disasters in the past few centuries

skimming vector wrong has convinced practically everyone in the navy that
emergency refueling was more to be feared than the enemy.
   In an emergency these _might_ skim if they had been designed for it. The

before now. As with many other things in the SF, everyone knows
it\'s a problem but they can\'t agree on a fix.

Depending on the chemical composition of the star system. The
proportions of the metals (anything heavier than Oxygen) start
jumping all over the place once you get off our own planet\'s
magnesium-and-calcium aluminosilicate crust. There\'s a chance that there is
a better usable concentration of some useful metal in that dust than a
neigboring planet has left in more accessible ores.

There are also studies that show a seasonal increase in depression as days grow shorter. I would have a ships doc should be well versed in techniques to minimize the stresses caused by drastically shifting day/night cycles, including lighting, dietary supplements, perhaps even some medical treatments. No one wants a crew member going postal. I can attest to the strain of shifting back and forth from day to night shifts on a repeated basis.
Referring to a question in the original post, IMTU contraceptives have advanced to the point that they prevent egg release, effectively \'freezing\' the cycle around day 10(?). This way the full number of eggs is available when they go \'off the pill\'.

For a non-passenger ship, yes. A passenger vessel may want to shift to the
downport time cycle on the way, since it is not only the time of day but the
length of the cycle that you have to adjust to.

Ability to skim doesn\'t imply ability to land.  Nobody says it does.  And 
according to Supplement 9: Fighting Ships, the AHLs have Factor 5 nuke dampers 
& Factor 6 meson screens.  I wouldn\'t worry *TOO* much about taking fire from 
SDBs.

FWIW, any naval planner who sends out a raiding party that *can\'t* refuel all 
by itself ought to be shot for treason.

Just about everything in the old Supplement 9: Fighting Ships of the Imperium 
is capable of skimming.  This includes the venerable 500 kton Tigress class 
battleships.  Every capital ship mentioned has fuel scoops and integral 
purification plants.

Umm, I don\'t think that an x-boat ever has to wait to transfer it\'s data.
That\'s what the Tender is for. The X-boat transfers it\'s data to the big data
banks on the tender, which then sorts it and dumps it to the next boat going in
the right direction, or to the local planet\'s data system for distribution,
depending on the message\'s destination.
I think one use of \'faster than x-boat system\' data is with opprtunistic trade.

So can I. Try a week of days, a week of swings, and then a week of midnights.
Then keep repeating. And cities wonder why their police unions are constantly
trying to end this. (usually with a plan that uses permanent shifts, and
seniority is weighted for bidding for favorite shifts...)

Sorry, but J1 and a microjump take the same amount of fuel. So unless
you\'ve got a ship that can hold fuel for *more* than 2 J1s, you *have*
to go out there in normal space.

That\'s the problem, jumping uses jump fuel. And since the *purpose* is
to *obtain* jump fuel...

It\'ll take a lot more than a "few ion engines" to get it into that
transfer orbit. And a Hohmann transfer orbit from (say) Pluto\'s orbit
to Earth orbit will take somewhere between 50 and 100 years....
(half of whatever the orbital period of a circular 20 AU radius orbit
is)

Remember, oxygen and water have to be recycled on any planet without a
breathable atmosphere. It\'s no different than a large space station,
except that you don\'t have to budget as much for "structure". 

So it\'s *quite* doable. They aren\'t going to be thrilled at providing
tons of LH2 for ships though.

At one time we would have said that a gas giant can\'t form that close
to the star. And thus that there couldn\'t be a gas giant that close.

Planet\'s discovered in the last few years show that we were only half right.
It still seems that gas giant\'s can\'t form that close to a star. But
apparently, processes during the early stages of system formation can
*move* them that close or closer. 

And once you *get* a gas giant of jupiter size or larger, moving it
closer to the star tends to *not* drive off significant amounts of
hydrogen, etc.

I can\'t see this as the only valuable thing on the fuel shuttle will be 
the Thruster Plates and your not going to get away with that unless you 
rip it out (is there a market for slighly used T-plates). Fuel shuttles 
will probably be too large to "hangar".

 I did a fuel shuttle design some time ago (now lost i as HD crash :( ). 
IIRC it was 2000 dt and 90+ % of the volume was made out of hydrogen and 
it cost very little (and did not have 20 airlocks). If I were a pirate I 
wouldn\'t spend my time searching for fuel shuttles (it\'s another matter 
if you\'re desperate for jump fuel).

It might, but getting a spreadsheet to format it nicely like that is a

Umm...I extrapolated them from the GT book. I thought they\'d be close,
but wasn\'t sure. Perhaps we could get a few more hull sizes posted to
the list (ie, some common low tonnage AND high tonnage hulls...)

I can also do the hulls properly when I finally get my copy of GURPS
Vehicles (when they get around to shipping it up from Sydney...)

Tenders don\'t normally carry weaponry, as they are usually only seen on
xboat routes which are heavily patrolled (relatively, IMTU). They should
be capable of being armed, though, especially on the frontier (and the
marches do see the occasional war or five). Allocating the full number
of turrets will allow the tender to defend itself in wartime, or for any
other reason decided on by the IISS.

I probably should have allocated them as crew. I put them in as (unseen)
crew in the extra staterooms carried on the ship.

Hmm...it still needs some more work, I think. I will post another
version soon (unless anybody objects, of course ;-).

  That\'s how I\'ve dealt with this too. Hyd0 planets _do_ have some water,
enough to support the population but not enough to make cheap Lhyd fuel.
Thus you could get fuel from a no water present mainworld but it would be
obscenely expensive. Better use some othe fuel source if such exists.

 Duh...why? If you have J-2, like most traders would- (I\'m running in Old
Expanses. Looking at the astrography J-1 traders are pretty useless.)- you
can jump to Kuiper belt from another system, refuel, jump in (half you\'r
J-2 fuel), conduct you\'r business and, and jump to Kuiper belt again (the
other half of the fuel). Then you just refuel again and continue on you\'r
merry way. 

 Granted you lose 2 weeks in the process, so this would not be done if
_any_ fuel is available on mainworld. But if this is the only way to get
good to a world with any significant population, traders will take it.

 BTW you indicate there\'s a canonical source discussing microjumps. Could
you give a reference if at all possible, i\'d like to read what is said. (I
was thinking of using half of J-1 fuel for microjumo myself, but if 
canonical data is microjump=J-1 I might go with that instead.)

  OK, let\'s amend that to constant deceleration spiral orbit (kinda like
what you would get solar sailing fron Earth to Sun). I figure it\'ll still
take a couple of decedades, but the again the 20km ball of sludge _is_ a
pretty big source. Even the busiest highports would only neen to drop in a
comet evrey couple of years. And the amount of ion engines needed will not
be so large as to make it economically unfeasible, especilally since you
only need couple of hundreths of G:s of accleleration, and you get to
reuse the engines.

  Even with the best of enclosed habitats you get some wastage (especially
if you\'re trying to produce something for export). I admit you could deal
with this for thousands, at higher TL even millions of people, but there
are airless, waterless planets with _billions_ of people on the starmaps.
Even if you lose only one or two percent life support materiel per cycle
(optimistic, since you\'ll be doing some major exprt to support an economy
this massive) you\'ll be in major trouble replenishning this from offworld.

At some point a change has occurred.

In CT you have the following refuelling options:

    Full Streamlining       Starport    Gas Giant    Mainworld Ocean
    Partial Streamlining    StarPort    Gas Giant
    Unstreamlined           Starport

In T4:

    Hypersonic Streamlining Starport    Gas Giant    Mainworld Ocean
    Slower Streamlining     StarPort                 Mainworld Ocean
    Unstreamlined           Starport

The obvious conclusion is that the AHL designer was working to the T4
rules but High Guard was based on an early draft of FFS2 without the
errata.

        I am in the process of working out how big a no-jump refinery ship
would have to be to be able to make a 5% profit on investment from doing
round-trips between a gas giant and a mainworld and dropping the fuel off...
I\'ll post the design and economics information when I am done tonight...  I
am doing the design under CT, and classing the extra fuel tankage as "cargo"
for purposes of the economics.

Exactly how would one know, in advance, whether she\'s had her meds or
not?  I mean, she reacted rather kindly to her admirer (in another

have just not studied her mania long enough to see a pattern.  To be

Actually, you can generate hydrogen at even *lower* tech levels.
Sulfuric and nitric acids are producible at TL 1. React them with scrap
metal, and you get hydrogen. 

Also batteries are buildable at TL 1 if you *tell* them how. There\'s
evidence that batteries *were* discovered in ancient times and kept as
a secret, because the way they were discovered gave electroplating.
Which is a *great* way to rip of people by gold-plating some other
metal... :-)

Another means of producing hydrogen is by reacting steam with red-hot
coke or charcoal. This produces a mix of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.
This is how they produced "illuminating gas" in Victorian times. And it
works ok in balloons.

There are ways of seperating the CO from the H2. But if you are
producing it for a ship, the ship can seperate it easily enough. The CO
will liquefy long before the hydrogen does. So you can run it through a
cryogenic condensor, and "dump" the CO. I\'d send it back to the
natives, they can store it, or burn it to heat the coke.

And I *think* that at the TL that can produce illuminating gas, they
may be able to build the gear required to condense out the CO on their
own! They won\'t ber able to condense the hydrogen, nor will they be
able to store it at very high pressure, so it\'ll take *huge* storage
tanks.

Yep. And melting ice is safe too.

I figure that only planets that don\'t have enough water for their own
planned use (say someplace like Mars) are going to get sticky about it.

The thing is, during combat the *only* "severe buffetting" that a ship
will experience is transmitted shock waves from missile impacts, or
chunks of armor exploding from beam hits. 

"Jinking" to make the ship harder to hit will be almost unnoticeable,
as the ship\'s main engines are always pointing in much the same
direction *relative to the hull*. You change the direction the ship is
going by rotating it so the engines point in a different direction. 

The turning forces will be *less* than a g except on fighters. 

The forces encountered on gas giant skimming run are both a lot
stronger *and* being aerodynamic rather than inertial, they will be in
different directions and exerted at quite different points on the
airframe. 

Consider that jet fighters than can survive *violent* manuevers in
combat avoid thunderstorms because the wind forces in them can rip the
plane to shreds.

Weather, even the *mild* stuff we have on earth, can produce *far* more
stress than a ship will undergo in combat. On a gas giant, you are
dealing with storms bigger than many planets!

Do recall that a cubic meter of water weighs a ton. That means that for
every meter of depth, you have another *ton* of pressure on every
square meter of hull. 

Then consider that submarines can be detected *visually* in as much as
30 meters of water (maybe more). I find it highly unlikely that your
ship is braced for 30 tons per square meter *inward* pressure. 

Among other things, remember that airlocks open *in* on spacecraft,
because that way the air pressure inside holds them closed. Submerge,
and the outside pressure is higher, and only the "latch" is resisting
all that pressure!

Iris hatches aren\'t going to handle that sort of pressure well. And the
only other kind of pressure hatch that *doesn\'t* suffer from the "opens
in/out" problem is a "rolling block" type seal as seen on Cardassian
airlocks on Deep Space 9. It\'s a nice design for hatches that you need
to be *strong*, and to open regardless of pressure differential. But
it\'s not suited to the outer hull.

Think of it as a conveyer belt with no belt. :-)

Actually, it\'s cheaper to not use vehicles at all. Use some sort of
"tug" to place the tanks (or whatever) into a transfer orbit that has
an adequate safety margin. Hang big radar corners off them so they
stand out like a sore thumb (a radar corner a meter across gives a
radar return like a "normal" ship 10-100 meters across!). At the
destination, tugs go out intercept the cargo and drag it into parking
orbits.

This minimizes the investment in drives and avionics, and maximizes the
amount of cargo that gets moved. You don\'t do it with more expensive
cargos, but for bulk cargos it\'s ideal.

I think it\'s practical only if you want to take 50+ years. That\'s why
my scenario had people *living* on the asteroid/comet and processing
while it was in transit. 

Also, it occurs to me that given the number of comets detected every
year, there should be a fair number that only need a *small* nudge to
go deeper into the system, and a slightly larger one to get them into a
favorable relationship with where the target planet will be when they
get there.

I don\'t see that as a likely happening.  How much metal do you have to throw

Who said anything about getting back home? All we heard about the
engagment was that the AHL-class died, we don\'t know how many
SDB\'s she took with her.

It\'s also quite possible that the ship was already damaged when attacked.
She had already visited several enemy systems, and refuelled while
running from another enemy battlegroup. 

And if you\'re sensors are comprimised, I can kill your 60ktn ship with
just about any SDB in inventory. No point defense means my missiles
can ram your ship before exploding - heck, they may not need to
even bother exploding. Your ship is very easy for my missile guidance
to see in all that gas giant gunk, compared to how my missiles will
show up on your fire control.

Still, the ships had enough armour for hull rigidity, as well as fuel scoops

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I would say that she\'s technically "partially streamlined", but more
optimized for deep space work than the average partially streamlined
ship - there may have been some details not well represented in the
HG design system. The HG system applies standardizations to
ship designs, it probably doesn\'t cover every detail - did you ever
notice how many CT ship descriptions had a "peculiarities" section?
The infamous inferior air filters on the standard type-S scout
certainly don\'t show up on it\'s HG Universal Starship Profile.

BTW, a highly skilled crew can, on the average, pull off a gas giant skim
with an AHL, even before the service life upgrades (higher-tech bracing
for the fuel decks) mentioned in the _Arrival Vengeance_ scenario.
They may lose some fuel, but probably less than j-1\'s worth and
probably through damage that can be repaired during jump.

It\'s very possible to have a moon of a Gas Giant with a habitable
environment. Just because a Gas Giant is mostly gas does not mean it\'s not
dense enough to have sufficient gravity to attract heavy satelite bodies.
Saturn does have a density low enough to allow it to float on water (if you
could find a body of water big enough to try), but it\'s total mass is
enormous (how many moons dos she have?). Jupiter, the king of them all, has
several moons near the size of Luna (the earth\'s moon) and one bigger I
believe (Titan).

IMTU, the capital of my largest empire is in a multi - star system where
all the neighbor stars are very distant so as to allow each star a maximum
number of orbits (under MT generation rules). At least 2 of the stars have
GG in their habitable zones and have habitable worlds. The main capital
moon is one of 2 habitable worlds around it\'s Gas Giant.

The main problem with habitable worlds around a Gas Giant is the Gas Giant.
Think of the seasons on earth, they are governed by the amount of warmth
recieved from the sun. Now, conciter, if there was a large object that
periodically cut off your access to this warmth. Your habitable world would
have to be in a high, fast orbit around this Giant to minimize the amount
of time cut off from the star or you will have long periods of very
inhospitable weather, not likely very healthy for the development of life.

Actually, in the recent discoveries concerning extrasolar planets, there is
a Gas Giant in orbit zone one with an orbit of 4 days around one paticular

Hmmm...actually, there is no evidence that these \'giant planets\' so close to
the primary are _gas_ giants...ALL we know is that there seems to be a large
non luminous body orbiting very close to the primary.

As I\'ve said before, developing models of planetary system development on the
basis of n=1 is likely to be largely speculation.

The \'ice line\' and likely elemental composition of various orbits _are_ very
probably correct; that\'s based on well known physical properties. How planets
of various sizes form are certainly far less well known, and could well have
significant random components of which we\'re not aware. Gas giants, are
probably hard to format a small scale, there isn\'t the mass to hold all that
gas together. But giant rocky planets, that will depend _entirely_ on the
composition and concentration of dust and debris in the inner zones of the
protostellar system as it\'s forming. If there are high concentrations, we
could very well end up with some very large, rocky planets there.

We have, ferinstance, accrete, a well known model of planetary system
formation. I\'ll have to peruse the code, but I don\'t think it even allows for
very large planets near the primary. BUT it\'s based on certain assumptions
we\'ve made concerning system formation...if those are wrong, our model is
inaccurate: GIGO.

Second, lets consider our methods of _finding_ these extrasolar
planets...looking for perturbations in the stars position. That\'s going to
automatically filter _out_ systems with many, small planets. The only ones we
can find right now, with this technique, might very well be anomalous systems.

Thirdly, some people have advaced the theory that the extrasolar planets we\'re
seeing (very large, very close to the primary) didn\'t form there, but what
we\'re seeing is the end stages of catastrophe, with a planet formed far out in
the system spiraling inward towards the primary, due to some hugantous orbit
perturbation. Shades of Velikovsky, but at least they\'re not saying that this
planet rained manna down on the planets it passed along the way. ;-)

IIRC, the AHL class was only to skim fuel in emergencies due to stresses on
the hull due to the unique protrusion on the bow that had the glass domed

on the gooseneck.

There are actually models that show a gas giant could retain significant
atmosphere (like all of it) even around the orbit of mercury; gas giant
gravity is a mighty force. 

The reason for these models is that there are half a dozen systems with
observational evidence (indirect, but good) of jupiter-mass planets with
orbits of 0.05 to 2 AU.

What isn\'t well known is how to *form* a gas giant at those separations.
Most models form the gas giants out at the edge and then shuffle them in
(though near-collisions or tidal drag.)

The reason for calling them gas giants are based on their masses. The *current*
models state that anything under 80 jupiter masses is a gas giant while objects
over 80 j.masses up to 0.08 solar masses are brown dwarfs. From there up you
have stars.

We have no way of saying anything about the formation of smaller planets
based on the current observations. But the technique used is capable and have
faound systems where gas giants are where their *suppose* to be.

I think that a giant planet wandering in from outsystem will clean up almost
everything from its startingpoint in to where it is. A wandering is a slow
process that takes millions of years. (I might even be that all giants will
wander in, just that it hasn\'t happened in the Sol system yet :-)

Yes it is. It is easy to design an Jump-4 X-boat system that is more
efficient than the one supposedly in use in the OTU. Introducing jump-5
and jump-6 links in selected places can improve things even more.

>Whether a J6 X-boat network is economical (and thus "optimum") or not...

A purely jump-6 network is almost certainly not optimal, since the boats
would be forced to jump short far too often. But then, Steven, Ian, and I
are not talking about pure jump-6 networks. 

>It would depend on an economic analysis I don\'t think is possible due to

Let\'s see. We can get a list of worlds that we want connected by checking 
what worlds are connected by the official network. There may be some
controversy over whether some worlds are "stepping stones" (worlds that
is part of the network only as intermediate stops rather than goals in
their own right) or not, but I suggest that we could get around that
provided everyone genuinely wanted to work out something plausible. We
know what an xboat and an exboat tender costs (or can work it out if we
can agree on what ship construction system we use). What other information
do you think is needed?

No, you just accept the concept that the Emperor would be able to repress
private high-jump courier networks (by \'private\' I mean corporate) and be
able to prevent people from leaking privviledged information. No doubt the
Emperor could occasionally "Knowing vital facts before they become general
knowledge" (though whether the benefit would outweigh the problems caused
by the slower general communications is highly doubtful), but the amount of
control over private institutions that that implies is staggering.

But the lines you quote above imply that the Imperial Bureaucracy IS the

And the restrictions required to ensure that those regulations wasn\'t

None of the Emperor\'s shares in the megacorps would give him control of

Only the notion that the advance news of the Emperor\'s assasination somehow
got to Norris alone. The setup you mention for YTU (which, incidentally, is
pretty much how things work IMTU except that I don\'t see the need for the
secrecy) would have several hundred people recieve the advance notice*. You
may be ready to believe that several hundred people with as many different
agendas can keep such a secret. I don\'t.

Supplement 5 - Lightning Class Cruisers, which shipped  with  the
AHL boardgame (and nowhere else), includes both 1st  edition  and
2nd edition HG stats.

The supplement also lists three modes of refuelling:

    "Administrative Refuelling" - When there is no  enemy  threat
    present the fuel shuttles are used to skim the gas  giant  or
    world ocean for fuel.  Duration = 3 days for full refuel from
    GG, or 7 days for full refuel from world ocean.

    "Tactical Refuelling" - As administrative refuelling but with
    the fuel shuttles protected by the  AHL\'s  fighters  and  big
    guns.  Duration = same as administrative refuelling  if  full
    refuel, or 15 hours for enough from a gas giant for jump-1.

    "Emergency Refuelling" - AHL skims the  gas  giant  directly.
    Dangers are:
        1) Loss of fuel shuttles - fuel shuttles  attach  to  the
           AHL externally and during this operation  there  is  a
           chance they may be torn from their mountings.
        2) Loss of fuel deck integrity  -  severe  buffeting  can
           result in one or more fuel decks buckling (and not  be
           able to retain fuel).
        3) Drive damage - severe buffeting can result in internal
           damage to the m-drives.  Worst case scenario is AHL is
           lost into the gas giant!

A purely jump-6 network is almost certainly not optimal, since the boats
would be forced to jump short far too often. But then, Steven, Ian, and I
are not talking about pure jump-6 networks. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I\'ve been wondering if the ability to use any ship on any leg of the
network would be worth the efficiency drop of ships jumping short.

In the current X-Boat system, a large number of functionally (and
perhaps completely) identical couriers populate the network. When
your courier arrives in Regina from Dinomn, the X-Boat administrator
can send you on to Roup, Jenghe, Extolay, wherever you\'re needed as
soon as your boat is ready to jump again - and even with only cursory
drive checks and refuelling, your X-Boat probably won\'t be ready to
go back to Dinomn before some other boat already in-system
could leave. 

If you have different jump capabilities on different couriers, those
couriers become tied to specific legs of the route. While you can
transfer them to same (or smaller) length legs elsewhere, you\'ll
also see legs that some of your couriers can\'t do at all.

A benefit of tying particular boats to particular legs would be
increased reliability of that leg - you have ships dedicated to
keeping it running. If couriers go where they are needed, you
may have an administrative error pile X-Boats up in one system
and deplete them in another.

We\'re given a 20% discount for standard designs, to reflect
economies of scale and shipyards becoming familiar with the
construction process. If your production run is enough X-Boats
to keep the Imperium in contact with itself, should your discount
be bigger? Say, big enough to make one model (even if it is often
inefficient due to shorter jumps than it can do) cheaper than
three or four variant models?

I have a scan of the Fasa deckplans but have not posted it.  If permission

Interestingly enough, the relevant skill to prevent loss of a Fuel Shuttle
if this crisis occurs is the pilot skill on board the _Fuel Shuttle_,
not the cruiser.

Since I can\'t see someone maneuvering a shuttle while it\'s in an
external cradle, it may be that this crisis involves the shuttle ripping
free of it\'s cradle and the pilot on board struggling to gain control and
take up formation with the cruiser. They\'ll have to quickly jury-rig
a replacement carry sling once they\'re out of the GG atmosphere
if they want to bring the saved fuel shuttle with them.

Hm..I think you underarmored it anyway.  My rule of thumb is that any tonnage
used for armor (in the HG design) should be filled with manuever drive instead.
If you have excess space, you can use that for manuever drive too.  My version
of the high lightning was pretty lightly armored (about DR 8,000) and did 4 Gs;
if I\'d cut it down to 2 Gs it would have had about 33,000 DR (only DR 4,000 on
the turrets; I placed the missile bays in internal mounts rather as external
turrets, so they don\'t add any surface area).  It also made use of my
generalized spinal mounts, with a rating-67 mount doing 6d*20,000.

Thus, the AHL is the only CT and MT semi-streamlined ship that has
this
problem. She is quite a "canon-breaker". She is also (along with the
Gazelle)
the only ship with external small craft, in a rule system with no
external
craft design rules! (though HG IMPLIES that dispersed structure ships
are
built that way-they can launch EVERYBODY simultaneously, but still
require
volume dedicated to these craft-what a gip!!). Unfortunately; I am

The AHL design does include  the external craft in the overall design

 Among other things, remember that airlocks open *in* on spacecraft,

 Iris hatches aren\'t going to handle that sort of pressure well. And the
 only other kind of pressure hatch that *doesn\'t* suffer from the "opens

From: "Allen Shock" <ashock@gte.net>
Subject: GT Lightning Class Frontier Cruiser (my version) (LONG)
In a fit of fevered delirium, I decided to design my own version of the
Lightning Class Frontier Cruiser. I hewed fairly close to Supplement 9:
Fighting Ships, consulting Supplement 5 when I couldn\'t find what I wanted
there. One change I did make was to use the 40-ton fuel skimmer instead of
designing a 400-ton version, thus this ship has 10 times the number of
skimmers that the Supp. 9 version had :) Thanks go to Hal for his hull
tables, and to both Hal and CmdrX who helped with the design of the fusion
guns. Much of this ship is highly apocryphal from a GT standpoint, but what
the heck, it\'s my game :)
*****************
would the savings in pilots make the larger skimmers worthwile? some
preliminary calculations show that bigger skimmers are more cost effective
(but skimming can be more impared by lose of a single big skimmer.).

CREW: 1x Captain, 1x Executive Officer, 2x Pilots, 2x Navigators, 4x Sensor
Ops, 4x Commo Ops, 2x Computer Officers, 4x Screens Officers, 121x
Engineers, 409x Gunners, 7x Medics, 150x Troops, 80x Fighter Pilots, 45x
Small Craft Pilots, plus a frozen watch of 312 additional crew.
*****************
Consider having enough bridge crew for 3 shifts on one bridge. why 4
screens off?  consider making 2 of them gunnery officers with override
controls for the spinal mounts/some of the missiles.

(yes I am still working on theose sensor drones.)




60,000 ton USL hull with Heavy compartmentilization, DR 7700, 190 turrets
with three lasers each, 90 turrets with three Sandcasters each, 40 turrets
with two Fusion guns each, 24 Missle Bays with 3,800 missles and 50 missle
racks each, Radical Emissions Cloaking, 2 Command Bridges, hardened (1 Main
Bridge, 1 Auxilliary Bridge), Engineering, 8400 Maneuver, 3600 Jump, 30000
Jump Fuel, 78 Low Berths, 620 Staterooms (62 single occupancy, 385 double
occupancy, 173 normally unoccupied), 6 Sickbay, 120 Utility, Spacedock for
80 fighters, Spacedock for 40 fuel skimmers, 5 Vehicle Bays for 40-ton
pinnaces, 20 Fuel Processors (187.5 hours to purify full load), Meson
Screen
(DR 488), Nuclear Damper (25 mile radius), "Factor N" Spinal mount particle
accelerator, 6440 Cargo.
*******************88
Consider adding more Fuel Processors to bring that time down.  there is
enough cargo space that could be converted to manuver drives that you could
increase the armor.  the DR on the meson screen is so low as to not bother
with it at all.

**************
looks good on a glance through.



TRANSLATOR\'s NOTES (not designers, since I didn\'t make this ship up
originally);
This ship is severely underarmored from what it\'s Armor factor in High
Guard
indicated it should be, which was around 18,000 DR in GURPS. The reason for
this, of course, is that it could not match it\'s performance stats with
that
much armor.
*****************888
Did you try cutting some of that massive cargo space?  I think you could
almost double the DR....


This leads me to believe that GURPS designed space combat
weapons badly outstrip the ability of ships built with the GURPS vehicles
system and designed for Traveller to defend against them. This ship
actually
has more survivability in the GURPS Space combat system than it would in
the
tactical game, I believe. In the alternate timeline that GURPS Traveller
represents, space combats are probably MUCH shorter and deadlier.
**********
I agree on this point, part of this is that the GSCS assumes rough parity
of ships.  it could do suprisingly well, we would need to run a few space
combats to see though....

thge major point of difference is missiles (and to a lesser extent) spinal
mounts. instead of being all or nothing salvos, you can get partial leakage
and ships can combine missile fire to overwhelm the defences of larger
ships.

as for spinal mounts, it did always come down to who got hit with the
spinal first in HG didn\'t it?

    I\'d also seriously consider running strings of RPVs from the
refinery to the starport (What is there for a crew to do except
at the ends of a run?). Terrestrial systems prefer pipelines for
this kind of work, but I don\'t think a pipeline with ends in
relative motion and several AU long is going to work. I\'d expect
a good TL and a severe shortage of hydrogen on the mainworld to
be prerequisites for insystem shipping of it anyway.
>>>>
If you think of "pipeline" narrowly as a cylinder of metal with stuff
going through it, then I agree that a multiple AU version with ends in
relative motion is not likely (undoable at TL8, maybe possible at
TL15).  If you think of "pipeline" in a broader sense, then a mass
driver sending continuous bucket-fulls of ice from an icy asteroid or
moon into orbit of the mainworld is not only thinkable, but doable at
TL7.  You just need a catching net at the mainworld end of the
pipeline.  It might well take a year or several for any one piece of
ice to get from outer to inner system, but with a continuous stream,
that doesn\'t matter.

Looks great. I spotted one type: section heading "The languages of the

(capitalization), but for a third language that\'s amazing!

Two suggestions:

1) Include page numbers in the table of contents

2) Include and hotlinks in the PDF file.

Neither of these are more than a minor quibble.

OK, one more suggestion. Send this to Pyramid, or some other magazine.

This is scary, since High Guard combat was already pretty deadly (one
good meson hit would disable any target...). What it may also signify
is that the balance between PA weapons and MGs is upset, if you can\'t
carry enough armour to defend against even a cruiser-sized PAW...
***********
well you can, but not at 6Gs when accel is based on mass and not
volume....and this gives more reason for slow  capital ship designs, as
faster light units. I admit to liking the DEs being faster than the BBs and
DNs rather than the other way round.


(Similarly, at the low end, even small ships can carry enough armour
to defend completely against standard lasers, which is a problem,
especially since G:T has no "surface hit" category.)
Anyone done any battleship designs with G:T yet?
*************
well, you can still get criticals (ignoring half of DR) and smaller ships
have more of a problem defending against missiles.  try swamping a scouts
defenses versis a merc crusier and you will see what I mean. the merc
cruiser should stop more smissles per turret than the the scot (if I have
my math correct) espicaily if the scout has one each (laser/missile/sand)
and the merc has something like 6 sand and 9 each missile/laser.

in fact I think that 8 scouts might have trouble taking the merc cruser
(assuming the merc detects them that is)
the scout could muster only 8 missile salvos each turn (vs the 15 PD
weapons of the cruiser) whiel the merc can get off 9 missile salvos (vs the
two PD weapons of the scouts)

although if the scouts had suprise (quite likely due to their stealth)....

Shrug.  A high lightning cruiser has 900,000 hp.  It will take criticals from
its own spinal weaponry, but it takes around five shots to get a kill.  If you
steal a page from Vehicles and give it a very heavy frame, it climbs to
3,600,000 hp and takes 15-20 shots...

whats wrong with a little piracy between friends:)


        When we (HMCS Restigouche) came home from the Gulf, we went through
that area.  The buggers were using cigarette boats with 20mm cannon on them
to slow an intended target and biz copters to rappel commando squads onto
the deck.  The commando squads could be expected to be equiped with Uzi\'s
or
H&K\'s and *cutlasses*.   Apparently the month before we went through, some
Greek captain had tried to resist and they\'d taken a piece out of him with
one.
        We closed up 2nd degree of readiness for the transit through the
area, and put flood-lights to illuminate the 3."75\'s and the Harpoon boxes,
and the Maple Leaf on the stack ("No, this is NOT a merchant.  Go Away.").
I remember the Combat Officer briefing the CO that if we were attacked,
he\'d
bring the "A" system (3"75\'s) online...  he didn\'t expect to hit them -
that\'s be the waist 30mm & .50cal\'s - but he figured one two-barrel
five-shot volley at night (MUZZLE FLASH) would convinced them to annoy
someone else. =)

Actually, 80 jupiter masses is 0.08 solar masses (1 jupiter mass = 1/1000 of
a solar mass, near enough.) The argument about the line between brown dwarfs
and gas giants is quasi-religous, but most people would place it down around
10 or 20 jupiter masses.

The wandering inward is driven by the protoplanetary accretion disk - which
Sol no longer has - or by collisions with other equally-massive gas giants
(which Sol also no longer has.) In the process it doesn\'t necessarily sweep
up the whole protoplanetary disk, although it probably does collect all
the bigger chunks and leaves little room for other planets.

Scientists: Radiation belts pose
greater risks than previously thought 

AP News Service


SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The radiation belts surrounding Earth can
become extremely powerful in a matter of seconds, posing far  greater
risks to spacewalking astronauts and communication  satellites than
previously believed, scientists said Monday.
<snip>
New observations by an array of satellites show changes in the
planet\'s own magnetic field can accelerate electrons in the belts  to
nearly the speed of light, transforming them into what some
researchers describe as ``killer electrons.\'\'  
<snip>
Under such intense conditions, the charged particles can pierce  a
sheet of aluminum a half-inch thick. That could result in a
catastrophic accumulation of charged particles in the sensitive
electronics of hundreds of orbiting satellite, and perhaps endanger
astronauts.

  That could sharply affect how everything is built in the Imperium -
no more 45 different kinds of J-2 trader when one gets a higher discount;
depending on how such a discount is awarded you might see one design for
each niche per sector or two. That assumes that individual shipyards must
achieve very high construction totals.

  OTOH, where a run of 20 Nemesis Intruders might be built at one site
to maximize the savings (19x0.8 +1x1.0; vs 20x 1.0 if built at 20 systems)
the truly vast runs could have runs of dozens (!+) per decade in one or two
yards per sector. OC, the 10% discount on standard designs (even if the yard
in question has never built one?) may already represent the results of this.

  It\'s been awhile since I\'ve seen lots of detailed ship financials from
out of the THUDDD process, but a ship that gets the 20% (vs 0%) discount
is going to be decisively cheaper to operate in the same way that a 30%
or 40% discount will pound the stuffing out of a mere 20% discounted hull.

  OC, a TU with only 30 or 40 standard designs would make things a lot
easier for ship designers, esp. those using T4 or MT. Wait, B:2! - it\'s
already happened! :)

<< Perhaps you would like to define it, then, Marc? >>

The original statement went something like this... 

(based on the original CT ship design specs, which said that the minimum size
for a ship (as opposed to a small craft) was 100 tons). CT has small craft
down to a 10 ton fighter. 

Prior to M:0, there is a minimum size required for a fusion power plant.
Efficient small craft powered by fusion were not possible; neither were small
vehicles powered by fusion.

Fusion Plus cracked that limit and made it possible to produce fusion power
plants which had the same efficiency as larger plants, but were smaller. 

Fusion Plus produces no difference in power output for starships. It just
makes it possible to make smaller Fusion Power Plants with a corresponding
mass /volume to output ration.

Before Fusion Plus, you could not make Chrysler Lebarons with fusion power
under the hood. After FP, you could.

The small craft of the First Imperium and of the Interstellar Wars were bigger
than thos of the Third Imperium because the 3I small craft (including
fighters) could carry smaller fusion power plants. 

Before M:0, no one had Fusion Plus. In the Imperium\'s early years, they
maintained it as a monopoly.

I noticed this quite keenly when designing humanoid robots w/ Vampire
Fleets/FFS1.  In particular, i was doing an AB-101 (w/ homebrew psuedobio
rules) and didn\'t like fuel cells one bit.  They\'re described in Book 8 as
using hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells w/ a closed hydrogen, open oxygen system and
that if they were designed for vacuum, then fuel consumption was 9 times
quicker.  So what I did was rule that FFS fuel cells are the closed oxygen
systems and so allow that hideously high fuel consumption to be divided by 9
for my AB-101 w/ an open oxygen system.  I was also thinking that FFS legal
fuel cells are fine for TL8 through maybe 11, but at 12 they should maybe use
LHyd instead of the HGHCD (which seems to be what all book 8 fuel cells use).

Right.  It is more Supp 5 than TNE (which is primarily tasks difficulties,
etc).   The effects are mostly from supp 5.

It was supposed to be semistreamlined w/ an asterisk, as in it\'s not designed
to do the skimming but is capable of doing it in emergencies.  The description
in Supp5 says the AHLs were constructed using an open-frame system.  It
would\'ve been more appropriately described as USL w/ an asterisk IMO.  ; )

Hangers and grapples are different things, entirely.  Think of grapples more
as a jet\'s hardpoint mouting for a missle.  SL grapples would be a groove
shaped out of the way of the main airflow, AF might be perfectly shaped and
fitted, maybe even a door of some kind... Any external maintenance that needs
to be done will be done EVA.

Think the fuel deal was covered by Shadow/Leonard Erickson.

Table 219 of FFS2 of Fusion Plus currently defines it ... unless of course
you can tell us exactly what T4 got wrong about it ... 

Defining features include high surface area requirement, moderate fuel
consumption, very high power density (double that of a comparable Fusion
unit), very low fixed costs (about KCr 2-3 per megawatt at Tl10-12,
compared to about KCr 100 per megawatt for TL9-12 fusion) and lack of scale
efficiencies.

Now, there are in fact good reasons for keeping Fusion Plus mostly as
written - all those nice M0 fighters in the THUDDD heavy fighter
competition, for a start.

However, as it stands, I believe it is too dominant a technology.

My tweaks were a way of keeping it as a civilian technology, and as one
more edge when you are fighting completely TL11 and down foes at TL12
(although you dont really need one, what with nuke dampers, meson screens
and the extra gee of inertial compensation).

I still don\'t see "fastest available means."  I see "maximum of efficiency"

Of course.  The Xboat system may have well started out as optimized.
Waystations and capitals get moved, the routes are slower to change due to
political squabbles, corruption, etc etc.  The Xboats are certainly capable of
being optimized for their design (reorganizing the randomly generated routes
is what I think you want.  Well actually the Regency\'s Xweb is just what you
want, isn\'t it?  That\'s what exists IMTU <g>  I\'d prefer to rationalize the
dice if i ever ran a pre-Rebellion campaign...).  Look at the reasons given
for the slower speeds... "trade routes do not follow straight lines and not
all jumps are made at jump-4."  MT IE pg 24.   It\'s not preposterous to assume
that the xboat network has been slowly degenerating to the situation c1100
where it is quite inefficient according to its capabilities.

You know, Hans, I think RSB might be interpreted as validating your theory,
too (excepting J5 and J6 links on the Xboat network).  It says (pg 21) there
were parallel J6 routes for the "noble elite."

Not repress it but be able to make any private (also meaning corporate) body
fear his retaliation (and their dissolution as an entity) if they should
disregard his mandates, much less explicitly disobey him.

That\'s why I asked if I was being too literal.  ; )  And later said the
definition and casing of "bureacucracy" might well be important.  The
description of the naval courier in Supp 9 would indicate its only used for
fleet actions, keeping in touch w/ fleet elements, and seemingly only over a
subsector level (that\'s where the fleet is, after all).

If the Imperium forces private (especially corporate) parties to register
their ships and somewhat regulates matters todo w/ ship ownership and
construction, it would be fairly easy to screen out "non approved" applicants
for a significant number of J6 ships or to put on such a tax to make it
unwanted ("what?  \'bulk rate, premium jump drive\' tax?").  The megacorps would
be allowed their J6 couriers as long as they don\'t burst the bubble of the
Xboat network to the Great Unwashed.  A single (even a couple) J6 ships fine.
Just not setting up a pony express type system.  They\'re expensive enough to
be noticed and rare enough for covert investigations (and private
"reprimands") to be conducted by Imperial Intelligence.

Right.  We\'ve been over that too.  I only meant that he does have a say in
what they can and can\'t do, overall, both as share holder and as Emperor of
the Third Imperium.  A courier network of J6 ships has got to cost alot and be
noticible.  If the Emperor didn\'t want them to have them, they wouldn\'t have
them.  As long as they don\'t burst the bubble and expose the Xboat control
system, they\'re allowed to keep them.

Don\'t make me quote that TNS entry again, Hans.  It\'s quite apparent (though
never explicit) that Norris did *not* alone get the information on the
assassination.  That high level meeting was composed of all the high-ups in
the SM/Domain of Deneb and it was decided in that meeting that Norris would
pretend to get it alone.  Ya think?

Well the secrecy is just that their J6 courier networks exist.  Given the ways
things work, I don\'t imagine the megacorps need or want an Xboat type system
(and don\'t think you\'re proposing one), but their "network" is rather more
individual courier ("get this to the Spinward Marches regional manager, Eneri,
and pronto!") oriented than auto transmit to every megacorp holding/pony-
express type deal.  For every little podunc megacorp outpost and station, the
memos travelling via xboat or slow courier should be fine.

> *Heads of Imperial Bureaucracy on all worlds, megacorporate sector managers,

Just what is the "Imperial Bureaucracy" in YTU?  How is that defined?  Are we
talking low level number crunchers and analysts?  Even military could be
lumped into that by some.   I\'m thinking sector and subsector capital nobility
(and their aides).  I have no objection to that very limited body being part
of a J6 network, but anything lower doesn\'t need (much less rate) more than
the Xboat system.  Why would Eneri the Bureaucrat need or want more than the
Xboat can provide?  And why would the Emperor or the Emperors men not just
tell Eneri to shut his hole and crunch his numbers?

Well, under FFS2 a set of thruster plates is worth, at minimum, MCr 2.5.
Assuming you can get 40% of value (probable, given that they are pretty
useful and ubiquitous), then thats a megacredit of revenue.

This sort of \'chicken stealing\' may not make you rich, but the idea is a
stream of small paydays keeps your ship running until the chance for the
big payday comes along.

On the other hand, hanging out near mainworlds will give you a lot more
opportunities, but also be much, much, much more dangerous.

Does a pope shit in the woods ? I think there are few things Ditzie would

I can see it now - the SF builts some Battlecruisers to solve the problem,
and naturally gives them to experienced senior Captains who are used to
lots of armour. The first time they get into a fight they forget they\'re in
an eggshell and get badly shot up. Net result - the SF Navy\'s senior
officers\' beleif in heavy armour is seen to be justified and the problem
just gets worse.

Personnaly unless the enemy is in gunnery range (in which case you\'re

Some planets in Traveller (Vland for ex) have been using jump drives for over
11,000 years.  Would that be enough for a noticible dent to the hydrosphere?
Lhyd is also used in grav vehicles, planetary power grids, robots, etc as well

thanks again for your PE spreadsheet. I am just about to download 
the latest version from BITS. I will let you have my comments when
I have seen it.

I have just checked my e-mail log and it appears that I failed to
send my comments on the first version. Did you receive them? If not
I will update them and resend them.

I would be interested in taking part in your PE campaign.

All the best,

Essentially true.  Was pretty much true in high guard as well, though. 
However, bear in mind that the Azhanti High Lightning, due to being something
like 50% fuel tankage by volume, is pretty much guaranteed to be lightly
armored -- rip out the fuel tankage to make a 30 kTd battle rider (and
temporarily ignore hardpoint limits) and DR climbs to about 60,000.  Drop down
to 1 G and DR is 150,000, which _is_ enough to be relevant against spinal
mounts.  Allow even a little bit of directional armor and we can get something
like 250,000 from the front, 125,000 from other sides.

Not to mention some of the fuel cells being worked on for
today...they\'re air-breathers, using methanol fuel, BUT, they\'re cool
and can be made very small. I read about them in Popular Science (it was
a 1998 or 97 issue) they\'re being considered for use in things like
laptops and cameras, that sort of thing.

  At TL 9 fusion is KCr 200, 4000 kg, and produces 2 MW per m^3.
  An equivalent fuel cell is KCr 20, <1650 kg, and >0.9 MW.*

  Fusion scales down poorly past one cubic meter, but a fuel cell is OK to 40
liters/55 kg, and can go further.
  *extrapolations from 100-liter unit per B:8 (2/.165/.09).

  Fuel cells only seem thirsty if you have to carry the oxygen as well.
Actually, if you crack the water again afterwards they might work as
"batteries" for combat under CT, which actual storage cells are too 
expensive to do under those design rules.

hauling two loads of fuel from a GG to the starport per month.  Given that
transit time at 1G to a "near gas giant" is ~5d, that allows a day on each

        Right now, MTU doesn\'t have anything this big in commercial

envison a smaller version (~500 dtons) of this craft being subsidized by the

DISCUSSION

        So, selling refined fuel at a starport for a modest 20% markup
returns 1%.  The FreeTrader, Sub Liner, Destroyer, whatever docks along side
and transfers fuel.

        If we crank the TL up to 15, reducing size and cost of powerplant,
we get a 3% rate of return if we sell it ourselves, or we can split the
revenue with the port and each make 1.5% just so we can have convience of
dumping the load as soon as we get to the port.   We also increase our
shipable load to 2290dtons, or about  45 refuels for a sub-merchant.

        I can see the Port Authority being willing to have one of these
under its auspices instead of a private concern.  With the missile racks, no
corsair is going to want to pick a fight with it; he\'s facing a potential
critical hit every round, and the target doesn\'t loose anything simply by
dumping its load and turning around for the GG again.  Not worth the
aggrivation to the pirate.

        However, even at TL 9, it is economically feasible, as far as I can
see.

Not really in High Guard; spacecraft (even cruisers, since High Guard  
armour scaling was messed up) could carry enough armour to protect against
everything but surface hits from spinal PAWs, which would slowly whittle down
the factor of the opponent\'s spinal weapon. To get criticals and quick kills
you had to go for meson weapons.

Directional armour shouldn\'t really be allowed for spacecraft (it\'s not 
like they can really spend every moment facing the front towards the
enemy...) The fact that even a 2G pig like the AHL can\'t carry enough armour
to protect itself against its spinal implies that 5-6G cruisers are in
serious trouble against their own spinal mounts...

Hm...I chopped together some battle riders to see how this actually worked.  On
checking, I agree that there\'s some problems.  Most notably, it\'s much easier
to give ships meson screens than armor ;)  For a 5,000 ton BR (about the
minimum viable size for the basic spinal mount in GT) reasonable immunity to
bay-mounted PAWs (about DR 40k for TL 11+ PAWs, which do 6d*18,000) is 88 kT
and about 1 GCr.  Comparable resistance to meson guns is 1/80 the weight and
half the price...

A 2G, 5 kT BR is reasonably immune to bay-mounted weapons of all types; spinal
mounts will gut it.

Assuming you think this is a problem, best solution would probably be reducing
the penetration of large energy weapons (not damage..just penetration), since
the source of the problem is that if you take a 1,000x larger vehicle, it will
have 10x the armor and 30x the damage (and 100x the hp).  As I recall FF&S also
used penetration proportional to the square root of energy, so it might have
the same problem (or not...I could never figure out the logic behind FF&S
computations for weapon weights).

This is a problem for SDBs, especially.  It\'s canon that some of them spend

One could substitute LHCryo fuel (11.1 / 9.15 /  8.55 / 7.5) for
LH2/LOX separately.
Density of LOX is 1.15g/cc, 16.43 X LH2.

This redresses the fuel consumption issue somewhat.
A MW-hour is a heck of a lot of energy though.

*Fusion Plus was intended to be \'cold fusion\'. This is explicitly
mentioned in the \'Central Supply Catalog\'.
I regard F. Plus as a muon-catalysed fusion reactor which bridges the
fuel cell - \'hot fusion\' gap.
The energy required to generate muons accounts for its dreadful fuel
consumption.

(Remember that nuclear reactions are at least a million times more
energetic than electronic (chemical) ones, per mass of fuel).

*Hot fusion reactors should be both more energy and mass dense than
quoted in FF&S (if current RW research is close to the mark). One could
explain canon volume figures by the need for shielding from all the
neutrons and X-rays produced. Masses may be a little low,
unless a large void fraction is assumed.

The minimum size restriction should stay as is.
The smallest TL 15 plant is 100L and produces 600kW power - which is
equivalent to running an MBT or a locomotive with an engine which could
fit easily into a Suzuki Swift or similar little car.

*Apologies to Ian and Ditzie :-
I know you\'re both big fans of batteries (being very useful things for
all those lovely FS mayhem makers).

Real World battery densities are about 3-5kg/L.
Does the FF&S table presume a void fraction of >33% (banks of cells on
racks )?
The energy density by TL is a very reasonable approximation.

Sorry about throwing my spare change into the ring.

You never can tell. Binary star systems are common enough that
almost double planet systems shouldn\'t be excessively rare. (Earth-Moon,
Pluto-Charon) are appropriate examples.  So, a GG might just as
well have one big moon as several small ones.

I\'d guess roughly TL-3 as a lab curiosity, TL-4 to do it on a large
scale. Economically feasible is another question entirely.
Hydrogen-oxygen is among the more potent fuel mixtures, so you
need a cheaper energy source to make it common.

That\'s what I\'d like to know. I don\'t know that anyone has worked

transport, and my plate\'s a little bit full for that particular
project just now.

That is a quicker estimate. One free trader using 20 dtons of
fuel, jumping out each week for each of its 4 billion or so
current inhabitants would drain the hydrogen in earth\'s oceans in
a mere 5 million years. You needn\'t worry.

Yah, the energy densities required by traveller just aren\'t viable for a
chemical power source.  You basically have three choices -- ignore the physical
limitations involved, use known non-chemical power sources, or invent new
techniques (with suitable technobabble).  The first option will automatically
aggravate the gearheads, and getting a useful power density out of the second
option is likely to involve ignoring some physical principles too.  The best
(established) technobabble for this appears to be damper fields.

Damper-assist RTG: put a medium half-life radioactive material in damper field
generator which can be tuned to either accelerate or decelerate decay.  You are
advised to choose something which doesn\'t emit much gamma ;).  This can
probably get quite high power densities, but fuel costs and usage will be
fairly high as nuclear power sources go.

Damper-assist (and gravetic assist) fission: lower fuel usage and higher energy
densities than the above (energy density really only limited by your ability to
handle the output of your core).  If you really feel like taking risks, could
be gas-core fission.  Has the disadvantage of being horribly unstable and an
incredibly dangerous neutron source, but as a power plant for a missile its
probably fine.
  
Bonded flywheels or superconducting loops: whatever technique is used to create
bonded superdense could probably be used in other ways, and might allow
creating incredibly high density superconducting loop batteries or some such. 
Note that these are really closer to HPGs than batteries; if you can store
enough power in a superconducting loop to be useful as a general purpose power
source, the weight of the capacitor in an energy weapon becomes functionally
irrelevant.

Beyond this, its conceivable that in some way power can be stored in some sort
of field (either gravetic or damper), though there\'s no canon support for this
being true.  OTOH, canon is unclear about exactly what happens to decay
energies in damper-assisted decay in any case.

OK, so what is the minimum size of a fusion plant at TL12 ?

This will also affect small craft, because of the requirement to have a
fusion plant to run a HEPLAR drive. Allowing small fusion reactors will
allow minimum size Heplar drive, which will drive down the minimum cost of
a small craft (which now stands at about 2 megacredits for TL12, which is
wayyyy too high IMO).

The other issue is grav vehicles - the decision on the minimum size of
fusion power plants is important for grav tank design. It is possible to
build an internal-combustion grav tank, but not one that uses plasma or
laser main armament powered by the power plant (a short duration battery
powered from the main engine is possible, if you dont mind a small number
of shots available before you need to stop flying and recharge the battery).

 Assuming you think this is a problem, best solution would probably be
reducing
 the penetration of large energy weapons (not damage..just penetration), since
 the source of the problem is that if you take a 1,000x larger vehicle, it
will
 have 10x the armor and 30x the damage (and 100x the hp).  As I recall FF&S
also
 used penetration proportional to the square root of energy, so it might have

 computations for weapon weights). >>


Maybe it\'s time to lobby Loren to put out some errata...

I have an idea. How about we assume current GT armor is equivelent to Striker
low tech armor. I remember it was MUCH denser than the TL15 super-dooper
stuff. I suggest (if GT mechanics allow it that is...) that we make high tech
armor much less dense (though probably retain current volume). That should fix
this problem.

Much as I hate to dispute the highest authority in Traveller (:*>), I think this 
statement is just plain wrong. I\'ve spent some time and with a little creativity 
you can indeed build a wide variety of reasonable small craft at low tech levels 
without the use of fusion plus. You can find several examples on my website 
(the TL 9 15 Td swallow shipsboat, the TL 9 75 Td Reppu "fighter", the TL11 
200 Td Tracy Longship, the 100 Td TL10 AK100 and TL11 AK111 ketches). The 
trick is to use fission reactors and fusion rockets. I\'d agree that fighters are 
probably not going to be possible until TL10-11; but other small craft 
(comparable with fusion plus versions) are very doable.

I knew I had seen reference to this before in one of the LBBs.  In Secret
of the Ancients, p 18, the following limits are given:

"Equipment is subject to specific limits when in a gas giant environment,

...Ships and Small Craft
A 3G maneuver drive is required before a vessel can enter the atmosphere
below 37,000km (Note:  the altitudes are specific to the GG in the
scenario, diameter is 72,000km and atmosphere reaches to an altitude of
about 37,000km).  Commercial vessels (traders, merchants, liners) can
withstand up to 1000 degrees Kelvin and up to 1000 atmospheres.
Military vessels can handle temperatures up to 1500 degress Kelvin and
pressures up to 2000 atmospheres.  System Defense Boats are specifically
constructed to handle temperatures up to 2500 degrees Kelvin and pressures
to 3000 atmospheres."

Then, in Gamelords\' "The Mountain Environment," page 14, it lists depths
and pressures:

Sea Level is 1atm
10m is 2atm
20m is 3atm
...
80m is 9atm
90m is 10atm.

If this is true (and I\'ll be the first to admit I am not an expert on
pressure as you increase the depth) and the increase is 1atm/10 meters of
depth, the the following may hold true:

Civilian ships:  1000 atm should give it a submerged depth of 9990meters
Military shipes: 2000 atm should give it a submerged depth of 19990meters
SDB class craft:  3000 atm should give it a submerged depth of 29990 meters

If this is correct, then the ocean refueling issue is moot.  Your basic
Type A Free Trader could refuel just about anywhere...The problem as I see
it is how much maneuver capacity would you need to surface if you had to go
that deep.

The question is, would the M:1100 equivalent of the Greens have enough
political stroke to object?

(Of course, the _true_ M:1100 equivalent to the Greens would _also_
object to using the hydrogen from comets, gas giants, stars, or anything
else.  After all, _any_ human activity above TL-0 is
anti-environment....)

Granted.  But as I understand it a fusion power system uses a *lot* less
hydrogen than a jump drive -- the drive is basically flinging the LHyd out the
airlock into jump space at a prodigious rate.

I _used_ to have permission from FASA, but when they sold the copyright
(to Seeker, IIRC) that permission was explicitly revoked. (I got a phone

ownership.)

  So you use gas giants, but you can\'t use large iceballs or planetary oceans. 
    The captains are worried about things like about losing
enough speed in the skim that the 1G maneuver drive can\'t get
them back out of the gravity well.  Nuke dampers and meson
screens won\'t help you if you miscalculate the atmospheric
density and wind up doing an imitation of Skylab or comet

  AHL is a millenium later and a couple of TLs higher than MTU. I
don\'t have Supplement 9. All I have are the much maligned
Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium plus FFS1&2, and IS.
  IOW, I don\'t have any canonical sources for FFS2-using TL11
designs for the Sylean predecessor of the Coronation class
battleship (mentioned in IS)...

  You use top-of-the-line Battleships and Heavy Cruisers for
raiding parties??? My Grand Admiral uses them a) for show, and b)
to beat up on fleets attacking or defending key worlds (usually
the high pop, high tech, or industrial ones. Tell you what: when
you get to be Grand Admiral IMTU, you can rewrite Naval doctrine
and talk about shooting the naval architects all you want.

If your source is an iceball or comet, forget the tanks. Put a
reflective plastic coating on a slug of purified ice and away you
go. LH2 from a GG does need a tank, though.

(Head slapping) Now why didn\'t I think of that?  Of course that\'s
how you ship bulk solids intrasystem.

And how would you possibly give it a *big* nudge, anyway? <g> At
that distance out things in orbit are pretty slow moving, but a
small difference there makes a big difference in when and where
your comet goes.  There\'s a choice of taking your time about it
and getting it right in the first place, or waiting until it gets
falling at a pretty good clip and then trying to steer it.

  Like I said...IMTU the TL-11 Sylean predecessor to the
Coronation class battleship and the Heavy Cruiser that goes with
it a) don\'t HAVE multi-g maneuver drives, and b) weren\'t
designed to either land or imitate a submarine.

It would be moot, IF the temperature/pressure ratings were accurate. Mind
you, if they were then civilian ships would be pretty invulnerable, let
alone military ones. IIRC (and I could be wrong), those
temperature/pressure combinations are where you start to do things like
create diamonds.

If those figures are accurate, then starship hulls are pretty
invulnerable...

Has *anyone* ever read Asimov\'s story about the Martians who collected (the
equivalent of) drop tanks? I thought it was supposed to be a classic short
story. So classic, I can\'t even remember the name right now.  %-(

Ah - I think it was "The Martian Way".

IMTU, the sort of scavengers that exist in Asimov\'s story exist in
high-freight-capacity systems. Since the megacorps use bulk traders
(5000t+) with drop tanks, it becomes commercially viable to collect these
cast-offs and return them to the starport for a fee.

(I just *say* it is viable, I\'ve never bothered to do the math - why ruin
"local colour" with the facts... This is my swipe at all those
economic/piracy/tramp trader/size of the Navy issues... ;-)

So, do drop tanks have the cryptic phrase "no deposit, no return" written
around the rim? :-)

Sit down and do the math. You\'ll find that it\'ll take quite a bit to

Except that due to the mass of a gas giant, the orbital periods of the
moons are a *lot* shorter. For example, Ganymede has a period of a
*week*. The star will only be eclipsed by the GG for a matter of
*hours*. And only at certain times of year, depending on the
inclination of the moon\'s orbit.

Actually, the signature is likely to be a *lot* bigger than that. Since
a radar corner basicly consists of some metal foil on a wire frame,
they are dirt cheap to make. I\'d expect that you\'d see 10 or 100 meter
radar corners, giving the cargoes the radar signature of a small
asteroid. 

But just remember that you may get noticed trying to insinuate yourself
into the "stream" of cargo. They\'ll be traveling on trajectories that
are rather inconvenient to match except shortly after departure or
shortly before arrival.

Except that in the scenario you just gave, the ship can just as easily
jump to the main world (using J1 worth of fuel) then jump outsystem
again, using the rest of the fuel. That takes *half* the time, and the
only difference is that you arerive at the next stop "empty". 

If you want avoid that, then you could do a jump to the kuiper belt on
the way out. 

However, the important fact here is that while you can find comets and
the like out there, you can\'t do so *quickly*. Among other things, they
are likely to be tens of AU away. Remember, at the *inner* edge, the
Kuiper Belt is about 40 AU in radius. And it extends out for quite a
ways. Assume it\'s several AU thick, and you get an inner edge that has
an area of ~77 AU by 4 AU or about 307 AU. Add in a nice "wdth" for the
belt, and work out just how many cubic AUs the thousands of bodies are
scattered thru.

I don\'t recall where it\'s mentioned. I\'m pretty sure that Mark Miller
has confirmed microjump=j1 for fuel usage.

A 20 km chunk of ice has a radius of 10,000 meters. And a volume of
4.2e12 m^3. Assuming it was pure water, that\'s a mass of 4.2e12 *tons*.

At 2/100ths of a g, you need a thrust of 84 *billion* tons. Even with
an ion engine, that\'s gonna use a *lot* of reaction mass. 

Now let\'s consider the trip time. 40 AU is 6 billion km. Or 6 trillion
(6e12) meters. 

D=.5*a*t^2
3e12 = .5 * (1/50 * 10) * T^2
3e12 = .5 * .2 * T^2
3e12 = .1 * T^2
3e13 = T^2
T = 5477225.575 sec

That\'s time to halfway. Doubling it gives: 10954451.15 sec

That\'s 126.8 days. 

Only problem is, if you work out the fuel consumption, you\'ll find that
even with ion drive, the required fuel would be prohibitive.

So you are either boosting *much* more slowly, or doing so
intermittently.

Heck, the more massive the system, the *lower* the losses. That\'s the
way eco-systems *work*. Also, the larger the habitat, the *lower* the
surface area to volume ration is. And it\'s the surface area where
losses occur. 

And with even thousands of people, you are going to have to have a full
fledged eco-system of some sort. By the time you get to millions,
you\'ll be doing things like using artificial marshes to recycle sewage
(this is a recent technology, but quite workable). At one end you have
a pretty nasty swamp. At the other you have clean water that can be
drunk straight from the marsh, as well as large numbers of edible fish.
You also have a lot of vegetation (which helps recycle air). The reeeds
and the like turn out to have an affinity for the heavy metals. You can
actually *burn* them to white ash and recover metals from the ash!

The bacteria and the like in the swampier stages of the marsh break
down or otherwise sequester toxic chemicals. At some point, you want to
stop using the first stage swamp/marsh and set up a new one. Easiest
way would be to just start dumping into the second stage marsh and have
a new final stage. 

Meanwhile, after it dries out, you dig up the old marsh and extract any
toxins that weren\'t broken down. You may decide to regulate
production/use of some things if you get too much toxic waste. But
mostly it\'ll be only the *really* weird stuff left behind. 

Heck, with a bit of planning, you could put the marshes in a circular
belt, such that you are only using half of it at any given time, and
thus have decades to do any cleanup work needed.

Anyway, this is based on *real* sewage treatment techniques. And about
the last *third* of the required "marshlands" are usable for
recreation. 

You *can* get workable recycling in much less space, but it won\'t be as
efficient. And as we\'ve learned the hard way, you *want* a large
biomass reservior. 

Enclosing this much volume will be a problem, but a solvable one. I
rather expect that there will be a lot of "farmland" as well as the
"marshlands". 

On airless worlds, and ones where the air is really thin, I think I\'d
go for underground placement of the marshes and "farms". Create a
series of linked "bubble caverns" with nukes, meson guns, or whatever. 

On worlds with a decent pressure, but non-breathable air, you can get
by with fairly light construction. This includes the higher presure but
non-exotic atmospheres. No reason not to have the marshes/farms at
ambient pressure. 

With exotic atmosphere types, underground starts to look good again.

Whats your view on the shorter-duration batteries ? One of Ditzie\'s
favorite habits for energy weapons for short-duration combat (eg grav
tanks) is 5-minute duration batteries (lets face it, after 5 minutes of
firing, one of you should be dead dead dead).

Well, given the low power consumption of contragrav, chemical power plants
do seem still to have a role, at least for the export market.

Hmm, could this be an option for the gap between fusion and everything else

Hmmmmm. Ditzie wants to know much more, but as a missile power plant it
seems to be of limited utility - missiles need a fusion plant to run
Heplar, and missiles dont demand much power.

As dampers are TL12, I can see the damper-assisted gas core fission reactor
being an engineering curiousity - why not just use the small TL12 fusion
plants ?

Well canonically in Traveller a Hyd0 planet can have up to 4% water.

Four percent of the surface of a planet can be an _awfully_ large
ammount.  The Mediterranean Sea for example occupies much less than 4%
of the Earths surface.  However that is still thousands of cubic
kilometers of water with trillions (1x10^12) of tons of water.  You
could refuel an AHL clan cruiser out of it every day for the next
thousand years or so and it would still be 99+% intact.  Do you really
think thats enough of a shortage of water to drive up the price.

I wouls suggest finding out the exact ammount of water using MT\'s WB
Hbk.  It states that you should roll 2d-7 (rerolling a roll of 12) and
add to this number to the hydrographics roll x10 (pg69)

Note that you can determine the hydrographic % of every planet. [The
more detailed ammounts are my extrapolation.]  Using this system some
Hyd 0 planets will be 4.99% water [or other liquid] covered and some
will have less than onoe onethousandth of a percent of their surface
covered with water.  [The same system can be used for Hyd A planets
simply by reversing the words land & water, of course.]

This is very logical & is undoutably correct in terms of real world
engineering _but_ canonically we know that starship hulls can indeed
withstand enormous pressures.

In CT Adv 12, Secrets of the Ancients, there is a table giving specific
depths within the gas giant that the lost Ancient city might be at &
notes the atmospheric pressure at that depth.  IIRC the table went up
into the thousands of atmospheres.  One atmosphere (15 lbs psi) is about
10 tons per square meter.  Therefore Traveller starships can descend to
quite great depths in water.  My copy of Secrets of the Ancients was
mislaid in my recent move, could someone please check this table.

The damper-assist RTG is a good idea. The two isotopes that look optimal
are :-Plutonium 238, with a half life of 87 years and a specific power
of 73.53W/kg, and
Curium 244, with a half life of 18 years and a specific power of
524.76W/kg. [1]

Pu 238 is used in the U.S. space program\'s RTGs.

However, battery energy densities (referring to FF&S2 table 224,
\'Batteries\') could be explained by judicious choice of electrolytes and
increasing efficiency of extracting energy.
E.g. a *perfect* nickel cadmium battery would have seven to ten times
the energy density of the contemporary article (cited values for RW
ni-cads range from 0.07 to 0.11 MJ/kg).

There are many other combinations of ions with higher energy densities -
nickel cadmium is average for a chemical battery system.

> Damper-assist (and gravitic assist) fission:

Another good idea. As Ian Whitchurch pointed out though, it\'s a bit
redundant with a mature fusion technology. However, maybe not every
culture manages to crack the \'fusion problem\'.

The size constraint on fission piles limits their utility (no Mr.
Fission in the family runabout).

Beyond TL 8, particle accelerator (proton beam) driven reactors would
soon supplant conventional technologies in those societies concerned
about loss of coolant accidents and meltdowns.... Fission can\'t continue
when the accelerator is off.

Ob Trav :-
For an accelrator-driven fission plant design a C-PAW (proton beam) with
discharge energy equal to (power plant output in MW/50) MJ with a ROF of
2 per second. Otherwise identical to TL 8 fission plant in FF&S terms
(mass, volume, etc). [2]

I assume that damper technology is used in fusion plants once it is
available to enable smaller reactors (hence the dramatic decrease in
plant minimum size with TL) and, realistically, to permit proton chain
fusion (it isn\'t called a star cycle for nothing ; you need truly
stupendous pressures and temperatures to do this trick!).

>

Probably separate technologies. High temperature superconductors and
superdense materials arise through a similar line of research.

Very high energy density accumulator banks would have to use superdense
flywheels or superconducting loops as you describe.

Try this handwave :-
Quantum dots are discovered at TL 8. These are collections of electrons
in semiconductors which behave like a single electron. \'Artificial
atoms\' are soon devised with quantum dot arrangements similar to the
electron configurations of regular atoms.

Increasing sophistication in computer modelling and good old hard work
in the lab identifies some useful anomalous behaviours in certain
elements and compounds which yield high temperature superconductors at
TL 9-10.

A workable quantum gravity theory arises at TL 9, and gravitic devices
soon after. Superdense materials are discovered when artificial atoms
are manipulated in contragravity fields. Certain metastable (many years)
alternative condensed (retain structure after being returned to normal
gravitational field strengths) crystalline forms of familar elements,
and several useful componds are predicted then synthesised - these are
the first superdense materials.

Ian,
Astroburgers in BtC is possibly the most aggressive fast food chain ever
seen. They set up a store in a combat zone and started serving food (ye
gods!).

I have no objection to short life batteries (appear in FF&S2 and could
potentially be used as cheapish accumulator banks). They are a useful
solution to the energy weapon problem.

AND is the Advanced Nuclear Drive, a low-efficiency/high-

(and the whole engine after more than a few seconds of 
firing) is moderately radioactive; it can only be used 
in expendable vehicles. Missiles using this drive are 
"kicked" a  few tens of meters away from the launching 
ship by the launcher or by a explosive charge in the 
launch cannister. 

You can either use an AND (the magic drive) or a TL 9 
fusion rocket (and a rapid turn away to get out of the 
exhaust plume).

You\'re right, of course.  I\'m not concerned about the oceans drying up or
anything but more about incidental ecological effects of removing and not
replacing the water.  But it is relatively insignificant amounts, and there
could well be methods for replacing it, i suppose.

I\'d take issue with that.

In fact I\'d be surprised if the figure was even 10%.

First, there is a problem with the base price.

The current rules imply that the cost of an item for a starship is the
same wether part of the starship or bought separately. You could assume
that the cost of a starship fusion plant as part of the ship cost includes
fitting plus all the power lines and other wiring that make it useful.
This still means that there should be a difference between buying a
fusion plant and having a fusion plant fitted to your ship but for most
purposes I\'ll assume that the extra cost of fitting is offset by the
shipyard recovering parts from the decomissioned plant.

So I\'ll assume that for the cost in the book you get a brand new
standalone unit (complete with guarantees).

The retailer wants to make a profit so the price to them is lower.

However, secondhand stuff has significantly reduced value. If you sell
to someone who wants a power plant, they are going to want a significant
saving (like 50%) because they get no guarantee of how it has been used
and no one to complain to if it breaks, even if you supply all the
service history. If you sell to a retailer, then they can give a guarantee
to their customer but will need to service the item, make a profit and
still have a margin in case it does not work and is returned.
A possible assumption is that the retailer will sell at 60% of full price
and thus will only pay 40% of full price. Don\'t forget that any tax that
the retailer pays also has to come out of any margin.
If the retailer charged more than 60% then they would have problems
competing with new products.

The problem is that you have goods of unknown age, origin and title.

In the real world stuff like this gets an inspection for insurance
purposes. Now you can jump to the next planet before the paperwork
catches up but the buyer can\'t, so they will want a large margin to
cover the occasional unhappy customer and reposesed goods.

Also asking all the possible buyers for a price risks inviting the
police to the party so you will be restricted to your list of buyers
to those that you think you can trust.

Thus you won\'t be getting 40%.

consider using more G to reduce the time taken. At 4G, I calculate that the
time should be halved, allowing more runs per month and much more profit.
(G will increase cost per transported unit of fuel, but unless it doubles
this cost it would make sense.

It\'s PAUL Sanders that owns the DGp stuff, and if he also owns the Seeker

What\'s the chance that every drop of water on this hydrographic-0

More likely, the water will be scattered in small oasis, seeps,
underground catchbasins and such. Each one of these would probably
be the lifeblood of the community around it - and refuelling an AHL

Ok - time to squelch some grossly inaccurate rumors :)

I do NOT own any rights to the DGP or Seeker material! To the best of my
knowledge, Roger Sanger still owns the rights to the DGP material, and he
was - last I heard - also attempting to buy the rights for the Seeker
material from Steve Green (I\'ve no idea if he ever managed to get his
grubby hands on the Seeker material).

I will say this though - based on past experience with Roger, you haven\'t a
snowball\'s chance of getting his permission for using the Seeker material
if he does indeed own it without paying through the nose. But there is no
harm in trying, and good luck ;) 

>If you _do_ manage to contact him, could you ask him when he plans on
>paying me the money DGP owes me?

Heh - you need to talk to Roger, not me about this. I\'ve only communicated
with Roger a couple of times, the last time being nearly two years ago.
Another point that strikes me - if a person buys the copyright to a
company\'s material I do not think they also assume the previous owners
outstanding debts ;)  If the old DGP owes you money, I\'d say you need to
contact Joe Fugate, not Roger or whoever presently owns the copyright.

Maybe it\'s time to lobby Loren to put out some errata...
I have an idea. How about we assume current GT armor is equivelent to
Striker
low tech armor. I remember it was MUCH denser than the TL15 super-dooper
stuff. I suggest (if GT mechanics allow it that is...) that we make high
tech
armor much less dense (though probably retain current volume). That should
fix
this problem.

Alright, this is where we were before.  This Sanders fellow has
purchased what\'s left of DGP, Seeker and FASA Traveller stuff (and
maybe more).  Now he is hiding from his creditors (been there, done
that) and ducking flame-o-grams from Traveller people everywhere. 
Fine.  Does anyone have any idea how to get in touch with him?  I\'m
not a creditor nor do I want the rights to publish his stuff anywhere.
 Not that anyone could, anyway!

Yeh, I know.  Thinking "Roger", writing "Paul".

Paul, I\'m REALLY sorry about this.  I saw a "Saunders", and replied
without stopping to think for a minute.  In no way did I mean to impune
your reputation.  

To everyone tuning in late: Paul Saunders is the chap who\'s bringing the
the "lost" Keith supplements back to life. (A great deal, BTW. Email him
for details if you haven\'t already heard of them. I\'ve ordered the full
set.)  While I _wish_ he was able to do the same with the DGP material,
that is (as he has pointed out) Roger Sanger\'s affair.

My mistake. The fellow in question is "Sanger", not "Sanders". Similar
names, and both dealing in old Traveller material, but:

Roger Sanger is sitting on the DGP copyrights, having purchased the
company. Which is his right, but the least he could do is honour DGP\'s
outstanding debts (like Joe Fugate did).

Paul Sanders is bringing the "lost" Keith supplements back to life, and in
no way deserves the slur I made by mixing him up with Roger. AFAIK, no one
has had any trouble buying items from Paul, and we owe him a vote of
thanks for rescuing unpublished material from obscurity.

Only problem is, if you work out the fuel consumption, you\'ll find that
even with ion drive, the required fuel would be prohibitive.

So you are either boosting *much* more slowly, or doing so intermittently.

126.8 days is very quick for TL8 (current) tech.  Since you _are_
talking about a large mass (or a series of smaller masses) of bulk
non-perishable material, you don\'t _need_ a fast orbit.  It would be
perfectly ok to set that 20km chunk on a much slower orbit.  Lets try
5 years.  With a 5 yr orbit (using the same equation, since I don\'t
have my physics book with me), you would need an acceleration of only
about 1.2E-4.  That\'s more than two orders of magnitude lower (and
takes a lot less fuel).  Wrap a reflective blanket around it and you
won\'t get much more sublimation than with your 1/3 yr orbit.

I have a possible solution to the situation with GURPS Traveller starship
armor. It is based on the precedence used for reactionless thrusters. I\'m
not sure of the math involved; that I will leave to others. My idea is to
move higher tech armor down on the tech level scale for GT. The
number-crunchers can figure out exactly what the changes should be :) The
big question is: would the Powers That Be open to such an alteration?
*****************8
I dont think that such a move would be neccesary, a battlesuit can be built
that can take a direct hit from a ship laser.  The problem with Grave Tanks
is the oppisite, you can make tanks practicly immune to fusion gun fire
(the wonders of contragrav).  how about you and i get together on IRC some
night (after I get then new computer all set up that is) and try out those
AHLs you did, I suspect that they have enough HP to make the combat
reasonable. (we can even use those zho cruisers I did for Aliens I as
opfor).

up for it?

And I will be giving that GT ship design class on the 10th for those
interested.

Depends what minimum size is.  Minimum viable size for damper-assist fission is
pretty much the minimum size of a damper (whatever that is), even a moderately
capable damper could probably make do with a reaction mass of no more than a
couple of _grams_ (of highly enriched uranium).

_NOT_ a good idea.  Trust me.  The problem is that as vehicles get larger,
weapon penetration goes up faster than armor values.  Small vehicles tend to be
invulnerable beachballs from hell as it is, GT armor is in fact substantially
better than _any_ armor available in any other version of traveller.

Short answer: GT \'expensive metal\' at TL 12 is, weight for weight, 15x stronger
than steel.  \'advanced metal\' is 24x stronger.  Bonded superdense is, weight
for weight, 7.5x stronger than steel.  There really isn\'t a need to push this
further....
GT makes no statements about the actual density of metal armor.

At various times, I have posted the availablilty of Draft T5 material. Those

Starports

Each is a large Zip file containing several (many) Word For Windows 95 files.

My understanding is this:

DGP sold their rights to Paul Sanger (Seattle). He also picked up the FASA
material, and he may have the Seeker material.

I\'ve seen more HG on the list in the last two months than any time in the
last two years (except maybe in the Fighters Flamefest). I\'d be interested
in seeing any errata.

Did you catch my HG fusion rocket post?

I *thought* the number of TML digests had dropped ;-)

IIRC it\'s the fact that armour values in GT aren\'t compatible or equivalent
to HG for ships such as the AHL.

Hmm.... unless he bought DGP as a going concern in which case he owes Rob.

Paul Sanders has the Keith Bros material IIRC.

Roger Sanger has the DGP material and won\'t release it, not unless you pay
him silly money. He has a reputation of starting many projects that come to
nothing.... If you read between the lines of the IG material published you
may get the impression that the books were written to stop Roger ever
releasing his material successfully(*). But there again, I could be cynical.

(*) Emperor\'s Vehicles / 101 Vehicles (DGP), M0 Vland material / Vilani and
Vargr (DGP), the planned Aliens books..... Personally, I feel his sitting
on the material is a travesty, but that\'s his perogative.

In hindsight, this might be better technobabbled as a nuclear salt water
rocket - one in which fission occurs in uranium salts dissolved in water,
heating the water as exhaust. The performance specs for AND are 
actually pretty reasonable for such a rocket. OF course, then the
exhaust moves from "moderately radioactive" to "extremely radioactive",
but performance/price/etc. don\'t change.

  Then why go there without jump? I have seen no canonical references
 forbidding an insystem jump. Even if the microjump takes the standard
 week you\'d save some major time, and since fuel consumption _does_ depend
 on distance, youd probably save a lot of fuel too.

	Perhaps because the original thrust of the post (as I understood it anyway)
was that you had no jump fuel left and were trying to refuel again, and what
if the Oort cloud was the only spot to refuel from?

If the purchaser of DGP assumed the outstanding debts at the time.
(Usually done but not always).  And it depends on what form of

  Righto, and considering how much fuel you get from a 20km chunk you
could probably get away with even 10 or 20 year trajectories. All that
reflective foil and ion engines is going to take a _big_ ship to transport
to the comet, but you\'re not going to need very many of these. (Actually
finding the things can be done by normal seeker vessels as low risk
side-venture, for example.)

I\'ve found that by simply adjusting orbital speed, you can make a lot of
headway by letting the star\'s gravity drag it in.  Then you just put in a
few corrective burns and lock it into a lagrange point for convenient
access.

Okay, according to that source ...

    Commercial vessels (traders, merchants, liners) can withstand
    up to 1000 degrees K and up to 1000 atmospheres.

    Military vessels can handle temperatures to  1500  degrees  K
    and pressures to 2000 atmospheres.  System defense boats  are
    specifically  constructed  to  handle  temperatures  to  2500
    degrees K and pressures to 3000 atmospheres.

    Suits: Special protective suits fail at 1000 degrees K or 400
    atmospheres.



Additionally,  it  states  for  a  gas  giant  with  a  72000  km
equitorial diameter ...

  Quite true, as just came up in ship discounting; the components must cost
less before installation than the 10% or 20% discounted cost that some ships
get; for heavy industrial gear sold in quantity assume 70%, perhaps.

...
>The problem is that you have goods of unknown age, origin and title.

  Unless the item is small enough to not have a serial # or other ID
then you need to sell to a fence or directly to an end-user who isn\'t
concerned with the items provenance. While the current functioning of
the gear can be largely determined by giving it a close examination,
there\'s still going to be a discount to cover possible unknown damage.

  So assume that cost of uninstalled components is 70% of installed list,
and a further 30% for undocumented goods* believed to be owned free and
clear; a belter mining operation might pay 50% of list. If they strongly
suspected that it was stolen (whether they ever expect to see an inspection
of any kind or not) then they may offer as little as they think they can
get away with and still get the gear.

 *assumes well-maintained/reconditioned equipment

  OC, as we\'re talking about stuff that really is stolen, then there\'s
clearly a support function for people who can (at least temporarily)
fake the papers to make hardware look like it\'s legal.

OK. Assume we have 2 cm of crystaliron over an 8.4 m3 spherical missile.
Thats 0.4 m3 of crystaliron, for 4t.

Our target acceleration is 10 gees, and our 4 m3 warhead masses 4 tons as
well. Therefore we have 8 t of payload to push.

OK, lets add 200 kg of AND drive (220 kN). One hours fuel is thus 6.8 m3 of
DT water, or call it 7.25 t.

OK, we need to blow the size up to 11.2 m3, which means we need another 20%
armour, or another 0.8t.

We have now got a mass ranging between 9.0 and 16.25 t, and a thrust of 220
kilonewtons.

I dont think that cuts the mustard. If we double the thrust and take the
burn time down to 28 minutes or so, it\'s acceleration ranging between 3 and
5 gees as fuel burns, which is better.

But is 28 minutes burn time at an average of four gees enough to be useful
in combat, especially when you consider the missile has AF 20 and must thus
rely on dodging from laser fire.

Alright, this is where we were before.  This Sanders fellow has purchased
what\'s left of DGP, Seeker and FASA Traveller stuff (and maybe more).  Now
he is hiding from his creditors (been there, done that) and ducking
flame-o-grams from Traveller people everywhere.  Fine.  Does anyone have any
idea how to get in touch with him?  I\'m not a creditor nor do I want the
rights to publish his stuff anywhere.  Not that anyone could, anyway!

I heard that he also has the missing evidence from the Kennedy shooting and
is responsible for fluoride being put in our water supplies.

You\'re still going to have tons of LHyd slamming against the walls of the 
tanks, and in the wrong direction from where the bracing is.  No intertial 
compensation inside the tanks, remember?

Which the hull will be braced to deal with.

	Would you care to be on an aircraft (such as the C-130\'s used as hurricane

large warship like the AHL into a GG atmosphere is an excercise in extreme
emergency.  If he\'s in that big of a hurry, he is trying to escape from
something or someone. "Meeting engagements" happen all the time, even in
space.  Maybe 2 fleets both pulled in at roughly thesame time, and steller
topography doesn\'t allow for a jump of 1 or 2 pcs, which is your reserve fuel.
Granted, the ships are "partially streamlined", but that does not mean that
they are recommended for rountine use in an atmosphere.

Yeah, which is why they\'d shed the external small craft before skimming.

No, these are:

as stated. That is, these are the maximum g-loads that a human body can

I always assumed that with a ship of any size you wouldn\'t trun the C-G
systems off while on the ground, so that in fact only a small portion of
the ships actual weight in on the ground, with the C-G taking the rest.
Mind you I use TNE where merely nullifies gravitational attraction, so all
you need to do is turn the power down until you have the desired amount of
nullification and voila! you\'re down.

Douglas,

I\'ve tried the progam. Concidering my knowledge of VB is nil, it seems to
have worked fine for me. The only suggestion I can give at this time would
be to add some way to save or print the output. I\'ve used a screen capture
to print out several, it works ok, but it\'s a bit cumbersome. An internal
printing option would be nice.

Have you considered a Janus-style mount?  If you set it to fire

Does the Fusion drive still have a minimum size? IN FF&S1 it had a minimum
thrust of 100 tons, giving a minimum volume of 11.1111 m^3 and a mass of
11.111 tons. Until their fuel consumption was worsend by a factor of ten
(making it worse than HEPlaR0 they were wonderful for long duration burns,
if you could afford the price. I always liked the idea of fusion rockets
for cruising, with HEPlaR for high acceleration bursts (running them off
the power from the fusion rockets). But I hear that that doesn\'t work
anymore :(

Heard somewhere, probably another Discovery Channel episode, concerning a
theory that a large percentage of the earth\'s water came from mini - comets
that are still hitting our planet everyday.

IF this theory is true (have heard there is now evidence to this), how much
water do these snowballs add to the hydrosphere, and would they replace
water fast enough to make depletion due to planetary negligable?

Also note... someone else posted that for earth, even if everyone had 100d
seekers and refueled weekly, it would take milenia for even the smallest
impact on the hydrosphere. If this is the case, then these snowballs may
counteract this.

<dangerous brainstorm>
What about refilling the source? Could a world go out and grab something
the size of Hale - Bop and replenish the water source?

        Hi, Phil!

        Yep, you are *almost* right.  The much larger cost and crew
requirements due to powerplant size increase is mostly offset by the ship
getting a two extra runs in every month.  However, at TL9, the difference is
still too big...  our ship costs 571Cr per ton of fuel to make 500Cr/dton,
resulting in a loss of MCr2.8/yr.  Of course, it has an Agility of 4, making
it a little less raidable, too.
        At TL 13 (when powerplant size & cost next drop), it costs
Cr423/dton to make Cr500/dton.  That nets us MCr3.2, or a 0.3%ROR.
        At TL 15, it costs Cr290/dton to make Cr500/dton.  That nets
MCr9.3/yr, or a 1.5%ROR.

	For those who\'ve been around on the GDW-Beta list since then, this
was the going-in guidance we were provided for QSDS. Fusion plants
were exactly as in FF&S, except below TL12--power per cubic meter of
plant didn\'t change, just the smallest size you could make the plant.
This proved to be too confining for Greg Porter in the Vehicle Design
System, so he unilaterally changed it. As with most IG products, I\'m
will to bet it didn\'t get run by Marc before being printed ...

I did the calcs for Tavonni years ago, trying to force it into the
shadow-cone of Ryzel (its gas giant) for long enough to create "Tavonni
Jungle". This is a dense, impenetrable mass of killed-off vegetation
covered in new growth - great for hunting parties on TaSP (Tavonni Safari
Park). I started with a 2-week period in the cone, once every hundred years
or so, but when I re-checked I found it should be in the dark for only a
few days (_Final Night_, anyone?). So I said that this occurred more often
- - every 20 years or so.

I based the calcs on _Book 6: Scouts) and _Grand Survey_ (which became the
_World Builder\'s Handbook_). I\'ve never even *seen* a copy of _World Tamers
Handbook_, so I dont\' know how this measures up to "modern" calculations.
;-)

I look on this as an example of playing with the numbers (legitimately, not
fudging) to achieve an interesting result.

Mora-class Cargo Carrier
                MK-B714442-090000-90000-0    MCr 1305.812      3000 tons

Passengers=30. Cargo=930. Fuel=1320. EP=120. Agility=1. Low=0. Three Shuttles.

  The design falls short of the 1200 tons of cargo listed in SMC; it\'s
not clear that even a B:2 design with Z drives could achieve this. The
dispersed hull saves at least an additional MCr 30 (24 after discounts)
and is acceptable as all ports of call have the shuttle and refuelling
facilities needed for such a ship (in addition to Marketings obvious
customer service capacities).

  Weapons loads are fairly minimal considering where these ships travel;
although the ship would be hard-pressed against even a Zho frigate, 50
tons of the cargo capacity is actually an empty 50 Dt weapons bay (HG,
p.30) to be equipped with missiles or a repulsor in wartime.

  The three 40 ton shuttles seem to be a needless frill considering the
operating environment. Fifteen crew staterooms are installed, one each
for the Captain and Purser, and halves for the rest: four engineers, two
gunners, 3 shuttle pilots, nine pursers staff/stewards/service, and ten
command staff. Specialists include customer relations, a doctor and nurse,
and a loadmaster (cargo handling deck crew come from service, shuttles,
the gunners, and one engineer).

  These ships don\'t make money at KCr 1/t and KCr 8 gross after LS. The
company must have speculative trade carried in addition to always running
full (that being what the offices are for), and possibly mail contracts
between some of the little backwater worlds. Given their rather odd route
structure it wouldn\'t be surprising if they have an understanding with the
IN in exchange for having reqular service to some of these dumps.

  Interestingly, none seem to have been lost during the 5FW.

  FWIW, there are some fairly dubious scams to be run on the design rules.

Not even close, as far as the pressure goes. Thousand atmospheres can
be handled by a lot of industrial gear. The temperature ranges are
kinda extreme.

For diamonds you need pressures in the *millions* of atmospheres.

It could be gravitational since the cervics is opening and the uterius is

I read some years ago that Nasa was thinking about putting Dungeons and

against this Demonic practice (heh) and Nasa has never said a word on the
subject since.
(They should have suggested GURPS instead) Cabin fever was the term from
extended sea voyage eras. Depression, Suicide, paranoia (sp) I think it
would apply to space age too, I have seen people isolate themselves will
being stationed in remote areas overseas (europe, alaska) their ability to

discount the person as a \'ragbag or dirtbag\' not worth the time to help.

My earlier comment about "The Martian Way" should really have been
expanded. In the story, there is a politician on Earth complaining about
the amount of fuel (water from Earth\'s oceans) that the Martians use to
tool about with. The problem was not one of *numbers* (as Peter - and
Asimov - showed, the politician was talking rubbish), but of *people\'s
perceptions*. The politician was succesful because he appealed to people\'s
fears of running out of water. After all, if you are on a desert world
where you "know" water is scarce, how would you feel about a bunch of
spacers - who don\'t even live here - "stealing your planet\'s very
lifeblood!" (shake fist in the air at this point).

Not a sensible, rational argument from the facts, of course (not many
political arguments are ;-), but certainly enough to put a premium on the
fuel you sell to off-worlders. These are the sort of consequential effects
that bring worlds alive for me.

Plot Hook: the adventurers are hired to convince the world that starship
fuel consumption doesn\'t significantly affect a world\'s eco-system. Their
opposition is a rabid politician and his minor (but vocal) party.

Since I\'ve already stated several times that I don\'t object to the X-boat
network as such, I don\'t understand why people keep harping on that. Yes, I
think the randomly generated X-boat network is odd and that it would be
much more plausible if it had been reality-checked afterwards, but it\'s not
"that\'s-so-odd-it-CAN\'T-be true" but only "that\'s so-odd-that-I\'m-going-to-

That, OTOH, is so-odd-that-it-IMO-CAN\'T-be-true. It is simply so vital for a
farflung navy to keep in touch by the fastest available means that I flatly
refure to believe in an active navy where every effort to maintain the
fastest possible communications isn\'t being made. Please note that I could
accept a local admiral in a placid backwater that was so complacent after
decades of peace as to allow things to slide. But not a navy of an empire
with the size and history of the Imperium.

It\'s funny how the Imperium is very laid-back and hands-off and powerless
when it comes to explaining why it allows piracy and private wars to exist,
but up-tight and controlling and powerful when it comes to explaining why
such a thing as rapid communication dosen\'t exist. IMO the Imperium could
be interpreted one way or the other, but not both at the same time.

But that\'s just my point. What X-boat control system? If you allow a few
hundred people with widely divergent interests per sector to use an extra-
fast system, then there is no control over information.

I was referring to the notion that only a few people knew of the assasination
until the official news got there by X-boat. But the secret that J6 courier
networks exist is just as... no, even more impossible to keep. It goes out
the window the first time (OK, one of the first times) someone uses advance
notice of some event to accomplish something. And what\'s the use of having
advance notice of anything if you can\'t use it for fear of revealing the
fact that you had advance notice (This, incidentally, is a classic dillemma
of spy organisations theoughout time).

>>*Heads of Imperial Bureaucracy on all worlds, megacorporate sector managers,

> 
>Just what is the "Imperial Bureaucracy" in YTU?

IMTU each star system constitutes a sovereignty governed in any way its
inhabitants see fit. As members of the Imperium these sovereignties have
surrendered certain of their rights to the Emperor. The Emperor turns over
these rights to his vassals in return for fealthy and these vassals in
turn parcel them out to lesser vassals. Each star system thus have two
associated authorities: its own government administering system affairs and
an Imperial noble administering Imperial affairs. That noble is the head of
the Imperial bureaucracy for that system. When a system is too small to
rate even a baron of it\'s own, it is considered part of some mearby
marquisate and its Imperial affairs are run by someone appoiinted by the
marquis.

>How is that defined? Are we talking low level number crunchers and analysts?

No, just a few hundred Imperial nobles, a couple of dozen Megacorporate
managers, and a couple of dozen admirals.

>I\'m thinking sector and subsector capital nobility (and their aides).

Even that is 40+ individuals for the domain. Add the Megacorporate managers
and a couple of IN admirals and you have 60 people with widely divergent
interests and agendas. Add in their aides and you\'re up to more than 100
people. Do you really think that such a group is capable of keeping any
secret, let alone one of such monumental import?

>I have no objection to that very limited body being part of a J6 network,
>but anything lower doesn\'t need (much less rate) more than the Xboat system.

Rate is a political decision. Need is something else. If the Imperium really
is straining under the communication lag (as we are told it is), then they
most definitely need it.

>Why would Eneri the Bureaucrat need or want more than the Xboat can provide?

If Eneri the Bureaucrat is the Imperial governor of an entire star system
he would benefit from timely information about a whole lot of issues.

>And why would the Emperor or the Emperors men not just tell Eneri to shut
>his hole and crunch his numbers?

Because the Imperium is straining under the communication lag and the Emperor
would like to relieve that strain?

	The FF&S2 description was a poor attempt to patch over the problem
created when "Central Supply Catalog" changed the definition from
Starships.  

	For Starships (and specifically SSDS/QSDS) we were told that FF&S
(TNE) was to be our gospel, with only those changes necessary to
match Marc\'s new vision. Specifically for Fusion Plus (after
consulting with Marc), we were instructed to make the minimum size
power plants below TL12 ten times larger to represent non-fusion plus
plants. When Central Supply Catalog and the Vehicle Design System
were created by Greg Porter, that didn\'t allow him to do what he
wanted to do. He flat out said on the GDW-Beta list he didn\'t care
what FF&S or Starships said, or what was "Traveller," he wanted to be
able to build 20G grav speeders, and would rewrite Fusion+ ... which
he did, and I doubt he (or anybody at IG) consulted Marc on that
issue.

	When we started FF&S2 we were faced with trying to put together a
patchwork between SSDS and VDS while avoiding pissing off too many
people who didn\'t want Yet Another Incompatible Design System. Well,
obviously we didn\'t succeed. And because of the timecrunch (IG
published what we considered the first PLAYTEST READY draft ...), it
never got provided to Marc for his blessing.

	Given his statement, I would take it as an official errata that
Fusion Plus is *incorrect* as presented in FF&S2 (T4) and CSC. The
correct description should be what Marc gave: non-fusion plus power
plants have a minimum size that is ten times what was presented in
TNE FF&S. Fusion plus power plants have *exactly* the same power
output as non-fusion plus, but allow a smaller minimum size.

	The "regular" fusion plants presented in FF&S2 (T4) are non-fusion
plus up to TL11, and are fusion plus from TL-12 on. If I get the time
in the next year or so, I\'ll try to update the errata to show *only*
regular (non-fusion plus) plants in the table, and put in a note to
show that plants built with fusion plus can be ten times smaller.

I like this idea, but according to FFS2, 24 shots per minute is as good as
it gets for PAWs. I guess you could mount a couple of them in parallel.

My feeling is that the classic buyers of this sort of goods are outsystem
belters ... who are also the people that tend to have it stolen.

It\'s pretty easy to secure control of a given 100 diameter \'point\', and
pretty hard to control the outsystem.

Remember, our theoretical 10 m3 t-plate unit could be taken a long way to a
market, without running up too much in transport costs.

How about \'40% of used value\' ?

We\'re mixing design systems, but at 4G and TL9, crewmen will go *squish*,
as inertial compensation hasnt been invented.

  I was referring to a planet with no neigbours within J-1 distance. I\'ve
only really gotten familiar with Neworld (where I play) and Old Expanses
(where I referee), neither has a nifty sector spanning main like e.g
Spinward Marches does, so J-2 commerce is a necessity.

  There\'s no question locating a comet would be far too tall an order for
a trader. I was thinking of a situation where either: a) Belters have
located suitable comets, and maps and signal transponder frequences can be
had for the right price, or b) there are manned refueling stations in the
Kuiper belt. (If the traffic is heavy enough to support this.)

 I was rather thinking of all the thousands of visitors the A class
starport these places usually have gets every week. Youd have to
institute some pretty brutal biomass quarantine measures to stop them from
taking away unfeasible amounts of life support materiel. (I.e all they
eat, drink and breathe etc.) Also most things you export are going to take
away oxygen/water (plastics, metals etc.)

  OK, this is doable. (And makes for a rather interesting locale too.)
But the main point is _why_ would anyone do something like this? For one,
even with the colossal economic might of the Imperium behind you, the
initial investment of starting all the hundreds (at least) colonies like
this on the canon starmaps would eat you alive considering the need to
import the starting water oxygen topsoil etc. and to excavate hundreds of
cubic klicks of cave. And with a garden world with a couple of hundred
inhabitants right next door (several examples exist) the logic really
starts to stink.

Kevin Walsh\'s Free Trader Beowulf page has a number of new options for HG
(although I wish the Sensors options were in a standard txt file or some
such; none of my word processors can open whatever they\'re written in).


is High Guard out of favor? seems to me a fair number of HG designs have
been posted here as of not too long ago. I would also be interested in any
errata as it becomes available.

    'body' => 'This is based on an earlier discussion here about fleet trains - combat
support vessels - in the High Guard system.

I noticed that the HG ship form had a check box for "magazine", indicating
whether the ship had one or not. This box wasn\'t mentioned anywhere
I could find in the rules - were rules for supply once included or
considered, and later dropped?

Anyway - HG and TCS abstract quite a few items, such as sensors,
crew casualties, even planetary conquests. I was considering a method
for abstracting starship supply capabilities.

1. Basic Rules: The first level of abstraction, the most basic method,
would be inclusion of required cargo space in starships. 

For every 1% of hull space dedicated to cargo, a warship can operate
away from a friendly starport for one month. A starship with less than
this amount (or that has exceeded it\'s cruising time) will start to suffer
a degradation in capabilities. The exact effects should vary by TU,
but some suggestions:

Reduced weapon factor rating (poor maintenance on targeting arrays,
burnt out weapon tubes, missile shortages). For each month out of
supply, every weapon type either suffers a loss of one factor or a loss
of 10% (rounded up) of total weapon batteries for that type (owner\'s
choice, but single-battery weapons must take the factor loss).

Reduced effective computer rating (computer rating includes sensors,
scanners, even some fire control. Any of these could be harmed by
lack of spares). Reduce computer effectiveness for combat _only_
by one for every two months out of supply. Ship can still jump with
original computer rating.

Reduced damage control effectiveness (equipment used up already.
Attempted damage control on systems that have been field-repaired
at least once, now harder to get working again). For every second
month out of supply, apply a -1 penalty to damage control rolls.

Reduced combat-readiness of fighters and other carried craft. For every
month out of supply, 10% (rounded up) of the current fighter compliment
is unavailable for action. 

Access to friendly starport for one week will reverse all these effects,
as will access to a full month\'s worth of supplies for every two months
out of supply.

Optional rule: Any system reduced to Zero rating due to being out of
supply must be repaired in a starport as if it were destroyed in battle.

2. Combat support vessels - if you can\'t take it with you, bring someone
who can.

Combat support vessels can be tenders, ammunition ships, fleet
supply cargo ships, whatever level of detail you wish to include. 
A combat support vessel must provide the 1% per month cargo space
for supported ships. For example, a Free Trader acting as a fleet supply
auxiliary could use it\'s 161tn cargo bay to support itself (2tns) and
another 15900tns of warships for a month. It\'s even possible that it will 
only need 1tn (or less) of space for itself, as it isn\'t taking part in high-
intensity combat operations.

If the combat support ship can shuttle back and forth between a
friendly star port and the fleet, even 1% tonnage could supply that
fleet indefinitely. The longer the shuttle route, the more tonnage must
be allocated. Less than two jumps, 1% of tonnage is OK. Four jumps
would require 2% of tonnage. Figure 1% of tonnage required for every
two jumps...and note that this is jumps _by the support ship_. If
your fleet is Jump-4, on picket duty four parsecs from your starport,
a Free Trader supplying you will take four jumps to get there instead of
one and need 2% tonnage instead of 1%.

If a fleet loses it\'s combat support vessels, or needs to move away from
a location combat support was shuttling supplies to, it must immediatly
rate it\'s supply condition based on it\'s own cargo hull percentage and that
of combat support that came with it. If it has less than 1% hull tonnage
available, it will start to suffer from lack of supply within two weeks.

3. Differing Supply Needs: we might run out of missiles, but we got
plenty o\' laser bolts.

Some ships require more supplies than others. The 1% figure is
considered as an average.

Ships requiring more supplies:
- ----
Missile armed vessels
Sandcaster-equipped vessels
Vessels with large fighter compliments
Vessels with large marine/assault landing contingents

The following detail rules cover these differing supply needs.

a. All warships require a base 0.5% hull volume in cargo stores.
b. To this is added 10% of hull volume dedicated to missiles,
missile bays, or sandcasters.
c. To this is added 10% of hull volume of carried fightercraft, and
1% of hull volume of carried combat non-fightercraft (such as
marine assault shuttles). Any of these craft can be stowed (using 
no supplies), but would require some time (hours?) and expenditure
of a month\'s supplies to bring to combat readiness. As an optional
rule, these craft can be stowed using starport supplies before a sortie.
These craft would then not begin to use supplies until they were
deployed in combat. This would allow replacement fightercaft to be
easily transported to forward bases.
d. Marines themselves are considered supplied by the 2tns crew
quarters provided for each marine.

Example:

A 3000tn Frigate with all energy weapons requires 15tns of cargo for
a month of independent operations.

A 3000tn Missile Frigate with two 100tn missile bays and ten laser turrets
would require 35tns of cargo for a month of independent ops.

A 3000tn Escort Carrier with 80 15tn light fighters on board would
require 135tns of cargo space per month of independent ops.

If you don\'t put any armour on it at all - which you might was well not,
since AF20 is just decorative - and use the ln(mf) formulat to calculate
G-turns (since the missile\'s weight changes significantly as it burns fuel),
a 6G12 missile fits nicely into the standard 0.5 dTon size with laser commo.
Not a conincidence.

It sounds like a going concern to me, but I\'m not an American lawyer (or

Will the server post whatever messages were sent during the outage?

ObTrav:  Obviously, this is an example of how lack of redundancy in the

Well, during playtest my group did find it hard to armor
large ships against their own weapons.  However, when you look
at the designs, if make a jump capable ship with good
maneuverability hard to damage, then non-jump, slower
ships become "undamageable".

The current system worked OK (it was possbible for a large
ship to recover from the first hit) and having ships that
couldn\'t be damamged would have been a big problem.

This explains why the palletized seats in the C-141s that took me to and
from Egypt, and the seats on the C-5 from which I had a jump, were
rear-facing.

Looks as if grav inertial compensation isn\'t much help in a crash....

My earlier comment about "The Martian Way" should really have been
expanded. In the story, there is a politician on Earth complaining about
the amount of fuel (water from Earth\'s oceans) that the Martians use to
tool about with. The problem was not one of *numbers* (as Peter - and
Asimov - showed, the politician was talking rubbish), but of *people\'s
perceptions*. The politician was succesful because he appealed to people\'s
fears of running out of water. After all, if you are on a desert world
where you "know" water is scarce, how would you feel about a bunch of
spacers - who don\'t even live here - "stealing your planet\'s very
lifeblood!" (shake fist in the air at this point).

Not a sensible, rational argument from the facts, of course (not many
political arguments are ;-), but certainly enough to put a premium on the
fuel you sell to off-worlders. These are the sort of consequential effects
that bring worlds alive for me.

Plot Hook: the adventurers are hired to convince the world that starship
fuel consumption doesn\'t significantly affect a world\'s eco-system. Their
opposition is a rabid politician and his minor (but vocal) party.

sorry I\'m bored and haven\'t got a digest in two days.
Obviously something needs posting - if its something else wrong there\'s
nothing I can do about It.

This is just going as a *.txt attachment - I don\'t know if the list
accepts messages like this so if who end up with 2 pages of trash blame
me.

So here is the product of a boring morning: Xt!!kghu (subsector P,
Grikr!ng sector)
Something I missed from below - The Vargr name for this Subsector is
\'Knourrdhae\'.

And yes, I promise not to post when I\'m completely bored ever again, and
to actually edit what I\'ve done...

Xt!!kghu  subsector  contains 4 worlds with a total population of  11,439,696.
The highest Tech level is F at Gzekr\'ruk  rika!\'xk.
The multiplier column lists population multiplier, planetoid belts and gas giants.

Key: C = corsair base, G = Vargr naval base, O = K\'kree naval outpost, St = steppeworld

Notes: Xt!!kghu  subsector sits in the middle of the largest rift in charted space and is, perhaps, the most God-forsaken spot known to any sapient species. 

2632  Saevzoknang D321101-7
Saevzoknang (pop 96) was origionally founded as a  mining colony run by the Saevzoknang mineral development corperation. It\'s still run by the company and is anything but a success. It\'s current \'prosperity\' is due to the fact it is playing host to the Atveng planetary navy, a corsair group  from a K\'kree occupied Vargr planet. Tensions between the corsairs and the Uzzuen deep space force, however have lately begun to cause a division of loyalties. The planet is reliant on Uzzuen\'s economic aid and on the Corsairs military aid. The Atveng Corsairs have 3  5,000 ton  destroyers of TL 14. Uzzuen maintains 6 TL 9 Mercenary cruisers here.
The amber zone rating relates to the fact that Saevzoknang is raided often by the K\'kree navy.

2634  Uzzuen          C88A641-9
Uzzuen, with a population of  8,704,425  is a dying world. Unable to maintain its previous Tech level (TL 12) since 1035, the population has slowly shrunk as the people move away from the constant K\'kree raids.
Think of this place as a hard times era Doomed world. The only industry busier than defence manufacturing is the construction of bulk transports. It\'s only a matter of time until the K\'kree break through and bombard the world from orbit.
Again, the amber zone rating relates to the fact that Uzzuen is raided often by the K\'kree navy.

2935 Gzekr\'ruk rika!\'xk BS0A2P0-F
Gzekr\'ruk rika!\'xk  is the permanent home to 456 very unhappy K\'kree. Stuck in a series of tiny domes carved out from the ice, breathing air that smells like the downwind side of a burning oil refinery, obeying the dictates of a navy superior who has never come within 10 parsecs of the base, morale is completely at rock bottom. The K\'kree continue to perform their duties (repairing and refueling Navy warships) until relieved. Incidence of cabin fever are rife amongst the support staff and warship crews - this is one reason why the K\'kree navy are not using this lightly guarded route to attack around the Vargr defenders in Gn\'hk\'r sector.
Gzekr\'ruk rika!\'xk  is the sole planet orbiting a small brown dwarf star. The Translation for the official Name is \'Fortunate Wanderer\'. The Vargr call it \'Gnokhs\'. The support staff call it Hell. 
There are about 20 - 30 warships based here at any one time, none larger than 1000 tons. The planetary defence is limited to 2 batteries (8 launchers, 2 PEMS, AEMS arrays each) of missiles each.
The nominal law level for non-K\'kree is F, and (despite having more trade codes than I\'ve seen in one place before)is completely restricted to the navy.

3238  Hkakrekuk     D7646R0-A
Hkakrekuk was first founded by the passengers and crew of a misjumped colony vessel. Covered from pole to pole with vast rolling steppes broken only by warm shallow seas, Hkakrekuk is a planet the K\'kree consider very pleasant, and K\'kree on leave from the Gzekr\'ruk rika!\'xk  navy outpost consider it heaven
The nominal law level for non-K\'kree is 9.

Adventure notes:( Things PC\'s can do here)
Uzzuen can only build J-1 ships but have a lot of empty space to cross. They\'d pay well for the location of any comets the PC\'s could find.

Saevzoknang\'s argueing military commanders have seriously dented both of their charisma and disheartened all their followers. Some good role-play here could see the PC\'s leading a major military attack force.
Plenty of salvage and mining possiblities here too.

Gzekr\'ruk rika!\'xk  is a navy outpost off limits to Civilians and non-K\'kree. If the PC\'s end up here they\'ll be arrested but there is no Brig on planet. They\'ll just be told to stay in their cabins and guards posted. 
Despite being prisoners they\'ll still be visited by everyone who can find a way in. (news is thin out here.) Just in time for another mass outbreak of K\'kree insanity perhaps??

    'body' => 'This is based on an earlier discussion here about fleet trains - combat
support vessels - in the High Guard system. 

I noticed that the HG ship form had a check box for "magazine", indicating
whether the ship had one or not. This box wasn\'t mentioned anywhere
I could find in the rules - were rules for supply once included or
considered, and later dropped? Since I like my fleets to have some
"realism" to them, I decided to work on some rules to add supply
considerations back in.

Anyway - HG and TCS abstract quite a few items, such as sensors,
crew casualties, even planetary conquests. I was considering the 
following method for abstracting starship supply capabilities.

- ----
1. Basic Rules: The first level of abstraction, the most basic method,
would be inclusion of required cargo space in starships. 

For every 1% of hull space dedicated to cargo, a warship can operate
away from a friendly starport for one month. A starship with less than
this amount (or that has exceeded it\'s cruising time) will start to suffer
a degradation in capabilities. The exact effects should vary by TU,
but some suggestions:

Reduced weapon factor rating (poor maintenance on targeting arrays,
burnt out weapon tubes, missile shortages). For each month out of
supply, every weapon type either suffers a loss of one factor or a loss
of 10% (rounded up) of total weapon batteries for that type (owner\'s
choice, but single-battery weapons must take the factor loss).

Reduced effective computer rating (computer rating includes sensors,
scanners, even some fire control. Any of these could be harmed by
lack of spares). Reduce computer effectiveness for combat _only_
by one for every two months out of supply. Ship can still jump with
original computer rating.

Reduced damage control effectiveness (equipment used up already.
Attempted damage control on systems that have been field-repaired
at least once, now harder to get working again). For every second
month out of supply, apply a -1 penalty to damage control rolls.

Reduced combat-readiness of fighters and other carried craft. For every
month out of supply, 10% (rounded up) of the current fighter compliment
is unavailable for action. 

Access to friendly starport for one week will reverse all these effects,
as will access to a full month\'s worth of supplies for every two months
out of supply.

Optional rule: Any system reduced to Zero rating due to being out of
supply must be repaired in a starport as if it were destroyed in battle.

- ----
2. Combat support vessels - if you can\'t take it with you, bring someone
who can.

Combat support vessels can be tenders, ammunition ships, fleet
supply cargo ships, whatever level of detail you wish to include. 
A combat support vessel must provide the 1% per month cargo space
for supported ships. For example, a Free Trader acting as a fleet supply
auxiliary could use it\'s 161tn cargo bay to support itself (2tns) and
another 15900tns of warships for a month. It\'s even possible that it will 
only need 1tn (or less) of space for itself, as it isn\'t taking part in high-
intensity combat operations.

If the combat support ship can shuttle back and forth between a
friendly star port and the fleet, even 1% tonnage could supply that
fleet indefinitely. The longer the shuttle route, the more tonnage must
be allocated. Less than two jumps, 1% of tonnage is OK. Four jumps
would require 2% of tonnage. Figure 1% of tonnage required for every
two jumps...and note that this is jumps _by the support ship_. If
your fleet is Jump-4, on picket duty four parsecs from your starport,
a Free Trader supplying you will take four jumps to get there instead of
one and need 2% tonnage instead of 1%.

If a fleet loses it\'s combat support vessels, or needs to move away from
a location combat support was shuttling supplies to, it must immediatly
rate it\'s supply condition based on it\'s own cargo hull percentage and that
of combat support that came with it. If it has less than 1% hull tonnage
available, it will start to suffer from lack of supply within two weeks.

- ----
3. Differing Supply Needs: we might run out of missiles, but we got
plenty o\' laser bolts.

Some ships require more supplies than others. The 1% figure is
considered as an average.

Ships requiring more supplies:
- ----
Missile armed vessels
Sandcaster-equipped vessels
Vessels with large fighter compliments
Vessels with large marine/assault landing contingents

The following detail rules cover these differing supply needs.

a. All warships require a base 0.5% hull volume in cargo stores.
b. To this is added 10% of hull volume dedicated to missiles,
missile bays, or sandcasters.
c. To this is added 10% of hull volume of carried fightercraft, and
1% of hull volume of carried combat non-fightercraft (such as
marine assault shuttles). Any of these craft can be stowed (using 
no supplies), but would require some time (hours?) and expenditure
of a month\'s supplies to bring to combat readiness. As an optional
rule, these craft can be stowed using starport supplies before a sortie.
These craft would then not begin to use supplies until they were
deployed in combat. This would allow replacement fightercaft to be
easily transported to forward bases.
d. Marines themselves are considered supplied by the 2tns crew
quarters provided for each marine.

Example:

A 3000tn Frigate with all energy weapons requires 15tns of cargo for
a month of independent operations.

A 3000tn Missile Frigate with two 100tn missile bays and ten laser turrets
would require 35tns of cargo for a month of independent ops.

A 3000tn Escort Carrier with 80 15tn light fighters on board would
require 135tns of cargo space per month of independent ops.

- ----
Now, these rules are easily tweaked to reflect YTU philosophies on
fleet logistics - just change the times frames, or add/reduce the
tonnage needed to support operations. Note that I\'d consider the above
requirements to be "active duty" anyway - a scout ship performing
peaceful survey missions might need half or less, as would a merchant
ship (or even military ship) on a simple shuttle run. Active combat
operations would require at least the supply levels above, and some
(like planetary bombardment-style seiges) might eat up all the missile
stores available in the entire subsector.

Areas for these rules to be extended:

1. Rules for setting up a forward supply base
2. Rules for getting supplies from enemy fleets or captured bases
3. Better rules for recovering from loss of supply (possibly including
use of starport refit capabilities, or even requiring earlier annual
maintenance overhaul)

>how different is the FF&S2 missile design system from that in FF&S1?
The main difference is that FFS1 missiles used a miraculous solid fuel called
EAPlaC, so you didn\'t need an actual engine (and in theory they could be
capable of infinite acceleration.) FFS2 missiles use a vague nuclear rocket
called AND[1]. With the proper rocket formula it matches classic 6G12
performance, though.

He is correct. Thing is, for higher tech HG combat I think full

in a config 1 or 2 hull is the best idea from a purely rules-oriented
design standpoint. The small defense you get against meson weaponry
is worth the small price increase. I don\'t like the idea from a "realism"

	Actually, I would have to disagree with this. The theory seems good, 
but it doesn\'t match reality.  Such stars as 51 Pegasi show that not 
only do gas giants exist within the habitable zone they exist much 
closer to the star than the habitable zone.

	There is a theory that such planets formed beyond the "ice line" 
and were dragged by some mechanism into the inner system.

	While I don\'t know whether such a planet could retain any moons, it 
seems at least remotely possible that it could have captured some 
planets it passes on the way in. It could also have accreted new moons, 
though this seems less likely.

Is there still anything from Seeker (SGS) available? I only got the
Empress Marava and Subsidized Merchent deckplans and wonder if there are
still others out somewhere.
Also as I\'ve got the Adventure Class Ships, I\'d like to know what
deckplans fasa also brought out for Traveller.

Most messages should have been held in the inbound queue on a machine

Go to the bottom, and you should find a link from which you can select
different regions of the world. I could spend a whole day there myself. A
very nice site with many, many links to other site\'s. I\'ve found the links
to Kate Monk\'s name pages to be most useful (usually you get a bit of
cultural info, followed by whatever naming rules are used in that culture).

Hope the rest of you find this site as useful as I have been finding it!

Where does the 6G12 performance come from? IOW why is it \'Classic\'? TNE
missiles range from 7G7 to 12G12, and EAPlaC has a maximum of 13G13 (using
FF&S1\'s dubious design system).

Um...  no.  OOPS.  Fusion rockets, huh?  Well, that would be interesting

  Looks nice. Perhaps an expansion of what constitutes a month of operations
requiring average replenishment - as you point out high intensity combat (a
single battle or extensive attritional action) will require more resupply
than an uncontested blockade operation.

  The HG tonnage allocated to Service crew (e.g., the shops on a Kinunir)
would cover the first such increment, and hopefully support vessels for
one or more such would remain in reserve on hand.

  There may have been a similar article in a JTAS, but IIRC it dealt more
with stockpiling routine maintenance spares and supplies for personnel to
allow unsupported long range missions.

Hmm... I may have missed that file - I use the sensor material out of

I use it because I can design a big (100kt) ship in an hour.
FFS scared me, and FFS2 scared me more.  I didn\'t like MT\'s ship design
system, much less FFS...

That\'s because Mayday/CT missiles were 6G12\'s.

A really interesting question is to think how to integrate these into FFW _
either abstractly (requiring a J-3 or so "supply line" back to a friendly
naval base) or concretly ("supply squadrons"). It could change the
flavour of the game considerably (and for the better, since the pile-everything-
into-one-hex strategy becomes less viable.)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'m thinking that a mixture of both might be appropriate.

Give each base a "Support Radius" dependent on it\'s starport class,
presence of a Naval Base, perhaps even it\'s population and tech level.
Perhaps include some rule for taking over enemy bases and using
them for supply - say they give you Support Radius zero the turn you
take them, and the radius goes up by one every turn you hold it.
Maybe even some rules for establishing forward bases in systems 
with no or minimal starports.

Have this Support Radius drop to zero if the system is under seige - 
it can still support friendly fleets contesting the system, but merchant
marine ops will be curtailed.

I\'m not sure what the Supply Radius should be for most bases,
but I think I\'d keep it pretty low - perhaps the best base would have
a J-4 radius, the worst a J-0 radius, most coming up somewhere
in between. 

Create "SupportRons" (or even "CombatSupportRons") to accompany
the deep-penetration forces. Base them on TankRons for availability
and combat abilities (or rather, lack thereof), have them provide a mobile
supply base with a Support Radius of zero.

Have some purpose-built commerce raiders that are always considered
to be "in supply" - such as the Azhanti High Lightning Frontier Cruisers. 
Perhaps extend this special ability to ScoutRons.

_Imperium_ had some pretty basic rules about the effects of being
out of supply, it boiled down to attack/defense disadvantages and
out-of-supply ships couldn\'t perform high-intensity missile fire.
I\'ll have to review the FFW combat rules to come up with appropriate
penalties for being out of supply under it\'s system.

Just to keep things simple, I\'d have ships be "Supplied" or "Out of Supply",
and not increase or  decrease the penalties based on how long the unit
has been out of supply.

Another question: how many squadrons should a base (or SupportRon)
be able to support?

**thumbing through FF&S2**

From what I can find, the highest TL addressed on any chart in FF&S2 is
TL-21.  OTOH, the highest TL addressed on the inertil compensation table
is only TL-15.  Obviously, Santa has access to TL-22+ technology,
enabling sufficient compensation for this acceleration.  Further, at
TL-22+, Reindeer Power Plant Efficiencies can conceivably rise to the
levels needed to power Santa\'s sleigh at the required velocities.  The
post above also doesn\'t take into account the time-dilation effects of
near-C travel.

In short, it\'s the gearheads who will _save_ this Christmas icon.

For those who celebrate any holidays during this time of year, Happy
Holidays!

I\'d say the HG fleet maintenance costs would cover the cash,
so yes, apply this only to facilities required. If you got your hands
on an enemy Battlecruiser that had been lost for a year behind your
lines, you might have to pay through the nose to get it back into
fighting trim.

I was told those rules were later modified into Striker rules, and as
such were incorporated into the MT system, by supposedly *in the know*
folks at a GenCon in the Eighties...

Undamageable with or without meson guns ?

Incidentally, my draft design for the Imperial Moot Ratification class
(circa 30 000t TL12 pocket battleships) were designed to have about 40% of
their surface area dedicated to Meson Screen emitters.

For some reason I thought this is what Mayday/LBB Missiles had - 6G12 - but
it occurs to me that I\'m probably misbehaving. Anyway, it seemed like a good
compromise...EAPlaC didn\'t really have a maximum acceleration (you could
implicitly make your missile 1200G12 if you like - it would just accelerate
for a tiny fraction of a turn), so by definition all FFS1 missiles came
out as xGx.

6G12 seems like a reasonable value but I would be willing to hear a case for
12G12, since I made up the numbers anyway (although then you end up with 6G15
standard missiles too.)

It\'s mostly a wild guess. I\'m not even sure what would be in the 1%

It doesn\'t look too onerous, a percentage-based requirement is pretty
easy to do in HG, that was pretty much it. It could use some playtesting.

I recall a THUDD SDB design, the entire crew was supposed to go into

sounded. Such a vessel would last a long time on a 1% of hull tonnage

OK, I realise that this is probably better put to the technical list, but
seeing as I saw it here: what is the ln(mf) formula, and how can I use it
given the information in FF&S to work out the G-turns a rocket has? Also
does anyone know how far off the results you get using the method used in
FF&S1 (average the empty and full accelerations) tend to be?

It seems that since our announcement on Monday 7th December 1998 that SJG
would be stocking BITS products for mail order, they have had rather a lot
of advance orders. As they have not yet received the BITS shipment and thus
do not have the appropriate catalog entries against which to log the
orders, they cannot yet process these orders. I would therefore ask, on
behalf of SJG, that buyers hold off on orders until January.

Many thanks for your enthusiastic response, however!

SJG suggest that you check the Daily Illuminator

I\'m not sure it is too high a level of abstraction, but it did need some
descriptor.  What are the supplies needed?  I saw the listing you had
(or someone had) of expendable ordnance, and that is a good start. 
Additionally, what would be the repair parts that would be necessary for
self-sustainment?  Another thing might be the war material on board.  I
would anticipate X number of days of supply (food, ammunition, barrier
materials, repairs, etc.) for carried troops/fighters.  

Supp 9 doesn\'t have any dedicated troop carriers does it?  Are there
ships designed for that purpose out there?  I mean the Multi-kton
Assault ship....

This is a good thread...  Thanks.

The short answer is \'exploitable export resource\'.

If you assume 1000 miners and life support techs, each with 10 dtons of
gear, topsoil, LOx etc, being transported 10 parsecs at Cr 4000 per parsec
for passengers and Cr 800 per parsec for freight, you get a cost of MCr 48.
Add another KCr 20 per dton in actual cost of gear, and it goes up to MCr
250 or so.

Pretty easy to amortise that, especially if you can import food from a
nearby world with a biosphere.

Of course, as time goes on, people regard the world as \'home\', start to put
down roots, raise families, dig more caves, build or import more life
support gear etc etc.

I mean, with all due respect, Finland seems a much less nice place to live
than a number of other places I can think of, but people stay there ...

Mora-class Cargo Carrier
                MK-B714442-090000-80000-0     MCr 1296.38      3000 tons

Passengers=30. Cargo=1026. Fuel=1320. EP=120. Agility=1. One Shuttle. One
Launch.

  The design still falls short of the 1200 tons of cargo listed in SMC;
Embarked craft is now 1x 40 ton shuttle and 1x 10 ton launch; one small
craft pilot has been dropped. The laser battery has also been reduced.

  Where things get exciting is when you start designing some of the ship\'s
fuel tankage as "large craft" (consisting solely of fuel tankage) attached
to the main hull and switched at company facilities for empty cargo boxes
(ideally, identical 300 ton boxes already fitted with internal demountable
tanks). If the company can get these big boxes with pop-off ends and install/
remove the demountable tanks fast enough then no interchangeable hull pieces
would be required - a substantial savings.

  IAC, empties could be shuttled around on under-booked MK\'s (if that occurs
often) or via a smallish tender design. At MCr 15 for a 300 ton tankage sub-unit
this may be worth stocking and shuffling about for the extra haulage capacity.

  What has to be avoided (and should, IMO be disallowed) is the "after-market"
installation of tankage as drop tanks*. Even after the 50% config modifier the
internal tankage of the design costs KCr 500 per Dt, while drop tanks cost only
KCr 1/Dt for essentially the same commercial utility.

 * the _major_ flaw with the CE, IMO - the fourth hardpoint is an "oops",
but the tankage issue implies that almost every civilian design in the game
is poorly designed and allows this disgustingly twisted workaround.

  While the 1200 of 3000 Dt cargo load cannot be achieved with J-4 standards
any of the above would allow short hauls to be increased by 300+ tons, giving
an average much closer to the specified capacity.

Will, obviously without, since armor doesn\'t stop meson guns.  But
the same factor (not having to push the weight around) would
probably let you load up on meson screens.

We did postulate that a ship could target the ships sensors
(do densiometers have to be on the outside of the ship?  I
guess neutrino detectors don\'t, could you target with those?)
and where the guns stick out and then take you time boring a
hole in it.  But for game play purposes I wouldn\'t make
armor better.

Also, as David Pulver pointed out on the Pyramid GT message board,
there is a problem that small ships can have a problem damaging
each other if armor is made better.

        Hi, Greg...  there is a 50-ton Troop Ship in Supp 9, carries 50
troops and 10dtons cargo.  I designed a 200-dton jump-capable Assault Lander
for my TNEC campaign, that hauls a full platoon and two ATV\'s and can beat
down its own LZ.  I have never seen a "Marine Assault Ship" of any kind...
All though it wouldn\'t be hard...  pick any liner and armor it a bit...

        Hmmm...  Maybe that\'s what I\'ll do tonight...  build a TL11 MAS,
complete with "Striker" add-ons such as assault capsules.  I am supposed to
have such a thing in TMU anyway, so that will be a good excercise.

        I played in an SFB campaign where we were using 1 cargo box as one
month of supply...  The usual concept was to pull a WPN box from a raider
and make it a CARGO;  that was a month of supply (our game was done in one
month turns).  We also applied a scalar;  a size five (tiny) ship was
supplied for five months out of a CARGO, where as a size 1 (starbase) was
only a month.  Which led to the design of combat frieghters;  all screens,
gatling phasers, one torpedo and as many cargo boxes as you could cram,
being escorted by a *pair* of cruisers.  It would do the rounds to
prearragned RV points to resupply as many ships as possible and then fall
back to resupply itself.
        At least one major battle was fought over a resupply convoy....  the
Klingons happily totalled a CruRon and a battleship to destroy a
10-frieghter convoy guarded by two CruRons that was enroute to resupplying a
strike force base.  The base & system fell to the Klingons two months later,
largely because the StarFleet ADD racks were empty and they were low on
photon torpedoes.
        The Romulans had an interesting twist to this....  they routinely
did boarding actions on OpFor Battle Frieghters and to control of them...
thereby resupplying their own ships with the other-sides supplies.  They
usually pulled the two phaser-3\'s they carried in favor of having two months
supply.

        Having economics/ supply rules in place *completely* changed the
flavor of the game...  We had very nervous players in some cases, panicking
more over the defense of thier supply lines than the deep-penetration force
the line was supplying.  When a single battle frieghter could supply your
entire strike fleet for a month, you get *real* concerned about avoiding
enemy patrols.

>Perhaps the 1% per month is too high a level of abstraction?
>
>Walt Smith
>

        No...  I think it is about right...  so long as if the TL\'s are
equal.  I mean; it seems pretty obvious to do calculations on, and you can
simply state in the ship\'s description "it has X months of supply during
peace time and X/N months of supply during wartime in cargo space".

Well from what I recall about the Aliens I thing, the DGP info was explicitly

6G12 is what Classic Traveller used. Special Supplement #3 had a missile
design sequence, which allowed you to design everything from a cheap
missile useful only against disabled targets to 6G12 fully controlable
missiles (which usually hit).

It is from Mayday - which has a missile design sequence in too - and is the
standard missile duration/thrust performance thing.

Yep. All Crab Air (RAF) passenger transports can be rigged with rearward
facing seats. Airlines have been resisting the idea - even though it
would probably save lives - becuase they are afraid of passenger
reactions to travelling backwards.

If you search the TML archives about 18 months ago I believe Roger Sanders

Apparently Roger Sanger, (He is the one who owns the DGP copyrights, not
Paul Sanders) and SJG could not come to an agreement, so thus it DGP

Actually, you don\'t import topsoil. Topsoil is merely sand & clay with
added organics and organisms. The organics are essentially "life
support sludge" after bacterial processing. The organisms can be
produced by inoculating the soil with bacterial cultures, and once
those have taken hold, adding earthworms and other multicellular life. 

Heinlein\'s "Farmer in the Sky" has a couple of sections dealing with
producing topsoil from raw rock. First they have some equipment that
breaks the surface up into rocks down to the size of cars. Then
something that breaks *that* down into fist sized rocks. They break it
down to gravel with yet another sized crusher, and finally have "hand
tools" to break up gravel into rock flour. 

All of these would be doable by typical mining gear. Add a couple
stages of bacterial ore recovery and the tailings are useful for
building soil. 

We have projects now that use bacteria to extract metals and some
non-metals from ore and from old tailings piles. 

So I\'d just ship in food and save the sludge until there\'s enough to
build the first batch of soil. Shipping bacterial cultures and soil
critters is *much* easier.

> Pretty easy to amortise that, especially if you can import food from a

And if you skip shipping in bulk topsoil and go for my tricks, it\'s
even cheaper. 

You *do* wind up needing lots of water, but *any* mining setup will
require a lot of water until we switch to techniques that making
"mining" essentially meaningless.

I use it for the wow and fear factor it can generate.  The wow factor is
when you want to impress and show your citizens that you have the power to
protect them.  The fear factor is for the enemy in their cities and towns
when they realize that your megaton battleship is cruising by their window
and the local defense forces are nowhere to be found anymore.

IMC, it blows through and hits empty space; the turrets on ships are
designed so that the maximum number can bear on a target at the same time;
for small ships this generally means putting them so that they are arrayed
on the sides and top rather than the front and back.

Or you could say thet the turred needs to be destroyed rather than just
disabled before the ship is affected.  so it would absorbe a total of
13,200 hits before applying to the ship.

There was an interesting idea in Analog a few years back. Terraforming
a one-face world (ie a planet tidal locked too its star) by impacting a
"chain of small comets along the terminator. 

This would create a chian of interlinked craters. Add a river flowing
from the pole to the equator, and you have a useful living area.

I think that the problem occurs when the frozen watch suddenly becomes
_un_frozen.  Picture a technician going into the frozen watch area to
unfreeze someone.  They pull out the body while it is still frozen. 
They drop the frozen watch.  The crewman breaks into twentyseven
thousand small pieces all over the compartment floor which then start to
melt.  The clumsy crewman says Dooohh! but is quickly distracted by a
donut....

Will, obviously without, since armor doesn\'t stop meson guns.  But
the same factor (not having to push the weight around) would
probably let you load up on meson screens.

We did postulate that a ship could target the ships sensors
(do densiometers have to be on the outside of the ship?  I
guess neutrino detectors don\'t, could you target with those?)
and where the guns stick out and then take you time boring a
hole in it.  But for game play purposes I wouldn\'t make
armor better.

Also, as David Pulver pointed out on the Pyramid GT message board,
there is a problem that small ships can have a problem damaging
each other if armor is made better.

Did they ever get more than three things out?  I\'ve got the "Babylon
Project", "the Earthforce Sourcebook", and a GM screen/module of some sort
(never taken time to look at it).

Agreed, looks more like a "Face Hugger" from Aliens than a hand!  Shoot

Of _course_ not.  Engage two targets simultaneously.  You probably
wouldn\'t need a true 180 degree opposition to get some recoil-cancelling
effects.  (Of course, you might snap the helo like a dry twig....)

OTOH, while I understand that you\'re mounting this on a helo to prevent
the gravitic signature from giving away your position, you could have a
grav compensator linked to the firing circuit.  After all, once you fire
a plasma gun, you have provided quite a lovely visual/IR/radiation
signature anyway.  The compensator turns on a few milliseconds before
firing, and shuts off a few milliseconds after the recoil is dampened. 
You then scoot away, with no ongoing grav signature.

You\'re right, I just forgot (not having reat CT for some time). 

BTW EAPlaC is only the best choice in FF&S1 if you want the very high
maximum acceleration. HEPlaR + batteries or fuel cell is better if 6G\'s is
enough acceleration (no need for a fusion plant in FF&S1). If you bouild
your missiles at 10.5 m^3 at TL13+ you can have fusion powered HEPlaR and
get 16G155, though they cost 27% more than battery powered 14G28 models
(all this is using FF&S1\'s formulae).

I don\'t see a problem with this, as then you have a choice.

I imagine it should be based on maintenance points.  I don\'t think FFS2 still
uses these, but am not sure.  I like the concept of the maintenance rules of
TNE (wear values et al) though, of course, I\'ve tinkered w/ them.  Malfunction
checks are only done on catastrophic failures and when Preventive Maintenance
isn\'t done (which for MTU is just the required maintenance points and not
double as in TNE pg 241).   

Hmm...  Off hand, i\'m leaning towards something like a m3 per maintenance
point for a full years supplies (parts, lubrication, etc) w/ modifiers for
machine and electronics shops.  That would fill up ships pretty quick and give
most of my designs about 1-6 months of independant operation, depending on how
I actually slice the machine/electronic shops.  I\'m thinking have each one cut
the total supply size by from 10-25%.  What do the gearheads think?

I actually don\'t think the stock rules were far off the mark (especially for
ground vehicles).  I\'ve personally witnessed a well maintained M1A1 go out to
the field and have *something* friggin fail within 8 hours, which requires a
full crew to be working on that piece of *#$% until well past 0300.  It\'s
usually something electronic or mechanical (the mechanical is usually easily
fixed... the electronic has to be shipped somewhere), but sometimes its due to
operation... throwing track, get stuck in the mud, etc.  In general, though, u
do your maintenance and have nothing to worry bout.  

I know nothing about "high reliability" pieces like combat aircraft though...
anyone here work as ground crews on an Air Wing or for an Air Force or Naval
Aviation and have their two CrImp to toss in?

  This is the one scenario I _can_ stomach: resource worlds. What I can\'t

  And why wouldn\'t the miners (or whatever) work maybe 1-3 month shifts on
the hellhole resource world, and then travel one jump home to the garden
world to spend their obscene pay with their families.(Who probably
wouldn\'t be too happy living in a mine anyway.) This is pretty much the
eqiuvalent of what modern oil rig workers do.

  And look at our population density: a whopping 40 people/sq.mi. Finland
is actually a lot less unpleasant than you might imagine, then again the
climate is also a lot less extreme than most people seem to think. (No
polar bears here AFAIK, and the only time I see a reindeer is when I drive
800km north to a skiing resort.)

Subject: Converting High Guard stats
Hello Folks,
  A few thoughts to parade before the collective wisdome of the list...
a single laser needs an 8 to hit a target.  A single Particle gun needs a
9 to hit.  A Spinal Particle gun needs a 3 to hit, and a Meson Gun spinal
needs a 5 to hit.  These numbers are based upon a 2d6 system from High
Guard.  This would seem to imply that the Spinal mounts are better at
hitting than are the lasers.  Much MUCH better than lasers.
  If we accept that the lasers present in GURPS TRAVELLER are the
"standard" for what is relative to an "8" to hit in HIGH GUARD\'s system -
then a RoF bonus of +4 would equate to the "8".  Therefore, perhaps the
Single turret mounted Particle Accellerator is considered to be maybe a
RoF +3 Bonus, while a Particle Spinal Mount should be more like +9 and
perhaps a Meson Spinal should be more like +7 or +8.
************
or even higher, rememberitn that HG used only two dice.



  Spinal mounts concievably can do tremendous damage.  So much so, that it
would be ridiculous to think that meson screens are of any value.  Case in
point:
TL12 Meson Spinal mount (T equivalent in HIGH GUARD):

1/2 damage range: 10 hexes
Max Range       : 29 hexes
Damage          : 5d6x25,800 (average damage is 451,500
RoF per minute  : 4
RoF bonus       : +6
  If I were to change the RoF from 4 to 15 while maintaining the Volume
Constraints, the stats would look like this instead:
1/2 damage range:  5 hexes
Max damage Range: 15 hexes
Damage          : 5d6x13,850 (average damage per hit: 242,375)
RoF per minute  : 15
RoF bonus       :+8
************8
how about if we up it to 30 per minute, what happens then (besides the +9
to hit.)?


Four hits averaging 242,375 points will do 969,500 as compared with
1,354,500 for the Meson gun that I described first.  If that Destroyer
Escort has a Meson Screen DR of 60,000 (10% of his internal space devoted
to screens) then it will suffer 729,500 points of damage that round as
compared with 1,174,500 points from the first meson gun example.  (by the
by - that Destroyer Escort only has 120,000 hit points to begin with.
720,000 points of damage will destroy it totally).
***************
I am sure that after careful examination you could deduce that it used to
be a destroyer :)

You would need to do 1,320,000 damage to destroy it totaly.

Even then there would be that tell-tell cloud of expanding vapor....

I\'m sure Ditzie knows *nothing* about any side deals involving unauthorised
use of FS resources for \'private projects\'. Thats what her fwend Michael is
for.

Now, these overgrown lizards are TL12-13, and UN Space is tech 9, right ?

OK. Ditzie tells me a defining feature of plasma is that it is short range
(oh for an r-torp), so what we actually want is a series of small stealthed
grav-propelled missiles with a plasma gun warhead (FS\' High Energy
Solutions division generally doesnt believe in stealth, putting it\'s faith
in firepower, but when you have a 3 TL advantage, stealth is worth it).

Now, given a 3 TL advantage, we should be able to pick out any grav tanks,
artillery etc that are lying around with a cheap sensor, and then the
missile dives onto the target, with the plasma firing at 30-50 meters.

This will remove the support forces, letting infantry be cleaned up with
cluster bombs prior to the actual landing.

Does that fit the client\'s business requirements ?

Oh yeah, Ditzie says that she\'s got a high tech combat helicopter they may
be interested in too ... hmmm, are the A gun\'s stats in Mercenary ?

PS Having the Plasma Missiles clean up the tanks etc means that the PCs get
to survive, stuck in a foxhole.

    'body' => 'I\'m a Trekkie.  I don\'t care how the films fare, I\'ll see them all.
And, I eventually watch all of the episodes of the shows on television,
too--Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek:  Deep Space
Nine, and Star Trek:  Voyager included.  I\'ve grown up with Trek, and it
is hard for me to imagine a world without it.

Now, with that out of the way, let\'s talk about the third Next
Generation film, the 9th in the entire series.  It\'s fun!  From all of
the Trek movies, I\'d say that this is one of the most friendly for
non-Trekkies--even more so than Star Trek IV:  The Voyage Home.

Paramount has the biggest marketing push behind this film that I have
seen behind a Trek film in a long time.  They\'re playing it up as a good
"date film", and I\'d have to agree.  This is not to say that die-hard
Trekies, like myself, won\'t like the film, because I enjoyed it.

The story is a basic TV plot.  I\'d like to see something a little
grander on the big screen, but in reality, the story in Insurrection is
really just an excuse to watch the characters that have been created
with the Trek franchise.  A good job of that is done in this film.

I keep holding my breath to get another five star film that approaches
Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan in enjoyment, scope, and just plain
awesome movie making, but I\'m starting to turn a little blue.  The plot
of Star Trek:  Insurrection would have made a hell of a two-part episode
during the series, though, and as a movie, it\'s pretty good.

There\'s a lot of laughs in this one.  I kept hearing that, and I went in
thinking the film would be hokey.  But, it wasn\'t.  I laughed and
chuckled all the way through--glad that I was spending time with the
crew of the Enterprise again.

I\'ve got a few grips.  First, about the film\'s concept as a whole.  I
really wanted to see a TV-movie tie-in where we get to see what the
Enterprise is doing during the huge war the Federation is currently
having with the Dominion (you\'ll know about this if you watch DS9).  I
think the filmmakers had a chance to make this incredible, ultimate
space-fight, Trek morality on war, film, and they dropped the ball.

They could have had the Enterprise crew sent on some ultimate mission to
end the war--maybe to drop the superweapon, or something like that, on
the Dominon HQ.  I can just see it now--all that Trek-esque morality on
dropping THE BOMB.  Maybe the weapon could be some prototype of the
Genisis Device from the earlier Kirk-Trek films.  That\'d be a nice tie
to the old series.  Maybe they could start off at DS9 and have Worf come
aboard (he\'s stationed there, in case you don\'t watch DS9), then move
into a HUGE, save-the-day space fight, climaxing that big war on the big
screen.  Maybe the Romulans could do a sneak attack a la Pearl Harbor.
Maybe at the end, Voyager could finally arrive from the Delta Quadrant,
bringing that baby home as surprise (boy, do they need to do that).

Imagine it:  Klingons fighting to the death, honor and bravery paramount
above all else;  Romulan cloak-and-dagger spy networks;
Federation/Dominion/Cardassian space fights;  our first look at large
scale Trek ground warfare...

But, I know I\'m dreaming here.  Maybe if George Lucas takes over the
Trek franchise...

Anyway, as far as my specific gripes on Insurrection go, they need to do
away with those new dress uniforms.  It looks like they hired the same
guy (I don\'t know if they did) who did those awful ST:TNG uniforms to
design them.  They make Picard and crew look like waiters in space.
Another small gripe:  the ending was a little too neat and weak for my
tastes.  And, I think the Amish-people-in-space story line has been done
one too many times.

As far as strengths for the film?  I\'ve already named several.  It\'s a
fun film.  I laughed a lot.  I think non-Trekkies will like the movie.
The TNG characters continue to grow.  And, it\'s the best Next Gen film
to date.

I was worried that they weren\'t going to cover why the Enterprise was
off screwing around with this little planet (total population of 600),
when the Federation is currently embroiled in this galaxy wide war with
the Dominion, but they handled that fine.  It\'s a big galaxy, and in a
space that big, the front line can be far, far away from you.  The
Federation has to keep up duties in other parts of the galaxy too--can\'t
let it all go to hell just because there\'s a war on.  The Enterprise is
busy with diplomatic duties to support the war effort.  I liked that,
and I bought it (if I couldn\'t have my war film).

Barring Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan, and Star Trek IV:  The Voyage
Home (my two favorites), Insurrection takes it\'s place up there with
First Contact, Generations, The Undiscovered Country, The Search for
Spock, and The Motion Picture.

And, Insurrection is much, much better than The Final Frontier.

I\'m going to rate it a "Good" film by giving it 3 out of 5 stars and
encourage you to go see it.

You forget that what they eat, drink & breathe wind up as CO2, H20, and
"organic byproducts" all of which get left behind. Simply having
visiting ships dump the "sludge" from the water recycling system will
get you more organics than you lose. 

If they resupply with food, you aren\'t quite as well off. And due to
the way people metabolize food, sjhips will wind up with excess carbon
(from CO2 cracking in the air recycler) and excess water. Both of which
you\'ll gladly take off their hands. :-)

Exporting metals and minerals won\'t deplete organics. I doubt that
they\'ll be exporting anything with a high organic content unless
they\'ve got *lots* of spare biomass.

Excavating the caverns is *cheap*. A single nuclear demolition charge
will produce a *huge* cavern. The initial spherical cavity winds up
with a puddle of "melt" in the bottom, and that gets covered over when
the fractured rock above the cavity collapses. So you wind up with a
cylindrical cavity with a hemispherical top and a bottom composed of
loose rock over the melt puddle. 

They\'ve actually considered this technology for underground storage
facilities. 

I figure that most of these places start out as one of three things:

1. Way station. It\'s the best choice in the system, and having
   *something* there makes trade easier. A place to refuel, or even to
   just wait while you send a message on to get the replacement for
   that part that wasn\'t supposed to fail... :-)

2. Research base. Something was deemed of interest by some scientists,
   and they got enough funding to establish a small base.

3. Mining colony. Some sort of mineral deposits were found that some
   optimists felt were worth the cost of mining and shipping.

On all of these, you start out with a few dozen to a few hundred
people, and ship in food. After a while, you set up
hydroponic/aeroponic farming mostly to help rececyle the air and partly
to get some fresh air. After this has been going for a while and
diversified a bit you start raising food animals (chickens, rabbits,
guinea pigs) and including some fish in the water based recyling.

By this time you\'ve got thousands of people. And the marshes and the
rest start looking like a good investment, as they require less machine
pre-processing of the sewage before feeding it to the plants. 

This is a very condensed and simplified description of the likely
stages, but I don\'t see any insurmountable obstacles to such a slow,
steady increase in life support and population. 

BTW, for simple tunneling, I bet a modified PGMP/FGMP does a great job.
:-)

And right *now* they have experimental tunneling machines using CPAWS!

Power being cheap, excavation isn\'t all that hard. *Especially* if you
are on a world where you can just vent vaporized rock to the outside
and not worry about messing up the air.

    'body' => 'In an attempt to bring life back to the list, here are some ideas I\'ve been
letting  roll about in my head.  I\'m sure I\'ve not considered all of the
implications yet, but I\'m putting it out here for some discussion.  Also note,
I stopped version with MT, and plan on getting in a bit later again with GT or
T5 (or both).  This may explain if I\'ve missed some (new) canon positions that
either conflicts or already explains some of the material contained here.
With that said, here is some fodder for the gearheads.

JUMP SPACE HAS PHASES, LOGICALLY SIMILAR TO MATTER (e.g., such as water).

The initial reasons of why I arrived at this was simply to allow various game
systems into one universe, by coming up with as logical explanation as I could
on how te various FTL methods might work.  Try to answer the question "how
could I put Traveller, Star Wars/Star Trek/Space Master, and Stargate/Earth
Final Conflict - type systems together reasonably?"

Premises:
1) The \'phase\' change is not based upon heat (like water), but instead on
gravitic influence.
2) The gas/liquid translation occurs at about 100 diamaters, the liquid/solid
translation at something much less (perhaps 10, or even 1.5 diameters)
3) The transition point is not immovable, but either slowly shifts (like waves
on the beach and tides) or there exists an area where both phases allow for
some activity and reduced effectiveness or chance of success.
4) Jump Space is highly convoluted in a hyper-dimensional way.  (especially if
you want StarGate-like travel to be possible between two planets in different
star systems, which would in the normal universe be seen to cross over the
\'liquid\' and \'gas\' phase of jump space.  The Earth Final Conflict hyper travel
is not so effected as it only took people from one point on the planet to
another point on the same planet).

Explanations:
1) Traveller FTL travel can be seen as the jump engine causing a shock wave in
the \'gaseous\' phase of jump space, which the ship then follows so as not to be
affected by jump space itself
2) Star Wars/Star Trek/Space Master FTL travel is based on \'outriggers\' or
\'hydroplanes\' that dip their FTL drives into jump space while the rest of the
ship receives some feedback from it that protects it from being completely
overwhelmed of real-space effects.  They can see normal space, and choose when
to stop FTL travel, and aren\'t affected by relativistic time dilation effects.
3) StarGate type style travel is either burrowing through "solid" jump space
at the moment of need, or (more likely) opening one end of an existing tunnel
to allow travel to the other end.
4) The transition of gas to liquid to solid also accompanies some step up in
the velocity achievable.  While Traveller ships can jump 18LY (6 hexes * 1
Parsec [= ~3LY, right?]) in one week, Star Wars/Star Trek/Space Master ships
often do it in about a day, and Stargate type travel is nearly instantaneous.

Game effects/Implications:
1) While traveller-style jumps may be possible from less than 100 diameters,
failure becomes more likely the closer one gets, until perhaps at the 10
diameter mark it will not work, period. (No more jumping from the planet
surface, you reckless pilots!)
2) The different jump spaces available (1-6) are based on making use of the
convolutions of jump space.  (It may be easier to picture the Earth for this
next bit - the comparison being normalspace is looking at the Earth like a
map, when it is really a globe) J1 makes an \'easy\' jump by going a set
distance, and only a little bit \'below\' the sphere surface (say, New York to
Washington DC).  Higher Jump drives can go deeper, and faster/farther while
\'under\' (so that J2 might be New York to Kansas City, J3 New York to Salt Lake
City, J4 New York to LA, J5 New York to Hawaii, J6 New York to Tokyo).  
3) There will never be a galaxy-wide empire, if it is based solely on one mode
of FTL travel.  (Unless it would be based on StarGate type technology, but
that would only allow for control of the planets themselves with stargates,
and doesn\'t explain how they got there in the first place).
4) Galaxy-core diameters are used, meaning that traveller ships will come to
about 100 galaxy core diameters (I don\'t know that this value makes much sense
- - how far would this be?  A comfortable distance coreward from our known
traveller space?  Or would it take in the whole galaxy?  If so, maybe the fact
that the galaxy is a collection of gravity sources somehow muddles up the
range effect) and find their jump drives more likely to fail, may come upon
another interstellar power with differently run (and faster! ships), but that
can\'t go out past, oh, 110 galaxy core diameters without their drives failing.
5) Transition between phases on the galactic scale certainly includes many
sectors wide of space to allow for good conflict between the various
technologies.  Using a set barrier that shifts in and out, you may have years
when traveller type ships come into a system, and then can\'t get out when the
point shifts back, at which time the outriggers can access the systems.  Using
an area approach where both are possible (if somewhat reduced in power) I
would think would be more interesting.
6) intra-system and inter-system traveller may be based on very different
technologies (pirate thread coming! - imagine outrigger-type insystem ships in
outward galaxy systems, much faster than the ships jumping between the
systems, yet not able to jump themselves.)
7) Wormholes (for you DS9 fans), are as yet unexplained stargates naturally
forming for as-yet unregisterable gravity influence (perhaps in J-Space
itself!)

Well, I\'m suiting up into my flame-retardant outer-wear.  So have at it!

Don\'t recolless rifles blow some kind of inert material out the rear for
recoil compensation? How about using the same idea for your plasma gun?

I was wondering this when designing a large warship for GT.  In
Vehicles, long duration vehicles have significant extra space
assigned to the motive and power componenets.  One approach
can be to assume that one use of this is to store think like
spare parts.

Similarly, space for a galley, lounge, etc. is take out the space
assigned for crew staterooms.  Presumably, some of this space can
be used for storage of consumables for the crew.

I\'ve used the Cidi as NPCs in my GURPS Traveller campaign.

Coming into port and having your docking fee taken by a 7"

	From what Marc has repeatedly posted, that is not quite true. You
cannot use verbatim from any DGP materials. However, the license
under which DGP produced Traveller materials *explicitly* allowed GDW
(and now Marc) to reuse any of the ideas they choose. The concepts,
ideas and backgrounds in the DGP materials can be used; you just
can\'t lift the text verbatim and reprint it.

I\'m a filmmaker, and a lot of people think that\'s "cool".  I\'ll tell them about my
company, Walker Jane Productions, and the feature film we are currenlty working on,
"October".  And, then, sometimes, the conversation will drift into "how did I become
interested in movie making".  I respond--always--that movie making is story
telling.  When I was a kid, I used to play with my GI Joe and 8" action figures from
Star Trek or Planet of the Apes.  I would make up these grand stories (scripts),
build places to play with them in the dirt complete with miniture log buildings made
of tree branches (sets), and act out grand epic tales (directing).

When I got older, in high school, I discovered role playing--and I\'ve never stopped
ever since.  In these games, we make huge, all-encompasing campaigns (scripts,
again), and we populate these campaigns with mucho creativity put into our PCs
(character development and backstory).  As a gamemaster, I direct the action of the
session (directing, again), and I put images in my player\'s head.

The people who I\'m talking too, explaining how I\'ve always been a filmmaker but just
never used "film", always look at me a little strange at first.  If I was some bloke
off the street, I would immediately become "a geek" in their eyes, but since I am
what they consider a "cool" filmmaker, I am all of a sudden not a "geek" but an
"eccentric personality".

I don\'t care what they think.  I love this stuff.  Even as I make this film, I run a
game where we meet twice a month.

I\'ll probably never stop playing.

I\'d say that the problem is the tight schedule, the fact that\'s its
just about Christmas, and that most of us on here have day jobs
already.

If it was due sometime near the middle of next year, I\'d jump at the
opportunity,  I\'ve written half that much text in a couple of weeks working
full time on something I had intimate knowledge of (40,000 odd words
of user manual for a network management system)  but unless I
dedicated my Christmas holidays to nothing but this, (thus causing
all sorts of secondary repercussions in relation to families and
previous commitments.) no way in the suggested time frame.

Give me half a years warning, and I\'ll write whatever Traveller
stuff you want.
Or any RPG for that matter. Don\'t mention novels though, got about
four on the go, never been able to finish one :-)

One more thing that\'s interesting to note.  The lead contender of composers (who will
write the score for "October") is Mason Fisher.  Fisher\'s credits include music for
SSI\'s D&D role-playing computer games and the new release of the AD&D Core Rules on
CD-ROM.

More RPG influence on this filmmaker\'s table...

We just had this conversation...  was it here, or on rec.games.frp.gurps?
Anyhow, the consensus was that ANY of them would make great Minor Races, or

I think we have to remember that for the last 130 years or so, naval
vessels have tended to be exceedingly \'bleeding edge\' technology.

Before steam engines, explosive shells and torpedos sparked off the
continuing naval revolution, military sailing ships did not substantially
change in design for three hundred years, and could be sent on two or three
year voyages, with no resupply but water and food.

Now, the slow pace of technological development in Traveller will mean many
to most military ships will be dealing with stable, mature technologies.

Fundamentally, it is a design decision as to whether ships should be able
to conduct year-long voyages without resupply, or if they should be tied to
a resupply point.

Finally, if you want a \'Armed Auxiliary Fleet Tender\', check out the
Elisabeth class Frontier Trader in the THUDDD competitions. Jump-3, armed
with a bay laser.

M1A1s are very much bleeding edge technology. This may or may not apply
with Traveller military starships. If it does apply, then we need to think
about how it affects civilian starships.

Imagine a 50 kton battlecruiser, G:T 12, designed to operate in line of
battle. We want a sporting chance at surviving Bay meson guns.

Now, we have 510 000 m2 of surface area (or whatever G:T uses for surface
areas ... me, I think in dtons and m2 for surface area).

Therefore, Meson Screen modules will get us DR 40 apiece (20.8 million/510 k).

Now, a Bay Meson Gun has an expected damage of 30 000 or so, so 1500 Meson
Screen units (3% of ship volume) will get DR 60 000. It will cost about MCr
3000, or about 7 times the cost of the weapon it is designed to defend
against (and about 3 times the cost of a Spinal Meson Gun).

This will happily stop a Bay meson gun most of the time, but will be
ineffective at stopping a Spinal Meson Gun.

To have a sporting chance at stopping a spinal meson gun, we need Meson DR
of about 200 000, or in the case of our 50 kton battlewagon, a number of
Meson Screen modules about equal in volume to the ship.

Note that, for a 50 kton ship, the number of Meson Screen modules
neccessary to stop a Bay weapon could fit a Spinal meson gun.

Thus, I believe that Spinal Meson guns will be mounted in ships of around
10 ktons, and that battleships larger than this are unlikely to be combat
effective under G:T rules.

I believe the usual \'mixed\' armament will apply, with bay weapons being of
the other type to the spinal weapon.

In G:T, we have a critical hit rule that allows armour to be reduced by
90%. Hell, if lo-tech high-skill fighters can whale away until one of them
gets a crit on their attack rolls, then battlewagons can too.

So ?

Remember, Infernet raised the white flag at Trafalger when he came under
fire from the tenth and eleventh British ships to engage him ... \'modern\'
naval combat is actually unusual, where ships can and do sink after the
first solid hit.

In fact, ships being hard to hurt is *good*, because it allows boarding
actions and such.

Well, first of all, just because it has a type 6 atmosphere and some water
doesnt mean it\'s a garden world. 

Secondly, the jump home and back is going to cost about Cr 8000 round trip,
so with 3 trips a year, thats KCr 24 in transport costs, which is about
double the average income on a TL11 world. You might as well bring the
husband and kids, have him work in the Life Support system, and have the
kids in a creche (or share shifts, or whatever). Cash in your vouchers at
two-thirds of par, then after 5 years you have KCr 90.

Nope. A G:T Spinal Meson Gun takes up a mere 1500 or so dtons *including*
power plant.

It\'s more like a J-gun than a T-gun.

OK, lets demonstrate the problem. Prices are rounded up to the nearest
megacredit, to account for Ditzie\'s Retirement Fund. Masses are rounded up,
to account for the designer getting back from a party at 2 AM.

The class name is the \'Jacquerie\'.

G:T Pocket Battleship ; TL12, 5000 dtons

Unstreamlined Hull : 55t, MCr 6

12t/dton armour : 60 000t, MCr 720  <DR 36363>

4x Command Bridges : 32 dton, 100t, MCr 58 <Hardened> <16 crew>

Engineering : 1 space, 4t, MCr 1 <1 crew>

Utility : 10 dtons, 115t, MCr 3

64 Nuke Dampers : 64 dtons, 640t, MCr 256 <40 mile range>

Spinal Meson Gun : 1512 dtons, 15 120t, MCr 939 <?? crew. I am assuming 15>

2 Particle Bays : 100 dtons, 935 t, MCr 45 <4 crew>

1 Missile Bay : 50 dtons, 620t, MCr 1 <2 crew>

10 Triple Laser Turrets : 10 dtons, 250t, MCr 21 <10 crew>

750 M-drive modules : 750 dtons, 3000t, MCr 220 <5 crew>

Jump-4 drive : 250 dtons, 1000 t, MCr 1525 <5 crew>

Jump-4 fuel : 2000 dtons, 2600 t, MCr 320

38 staterooms : 152 dtons, 76t, MCr 1 <6 single, 32 double staterooms> 


Now, the ship pulls roughly one gee, so it cant chase down much.

More to the point, it is reliant on external refueling (having an acute
lack of fuel shuttles, streamlining and fuel processors).

It\'s missile defenses are barely adequate, having a bay dedicated to
counter-missile work, ten triple laser turrets and a nuke damper.

But it pulls a jump-4, mounts a Spinal Meson gun, costs MCr 4120, and has
armour thick enough to shrug off most hits from a bay-mounted PAW.

        The problem is that in modern navy combat, *anybody* can carry a
weapon that has the same relative effects as a TRAVELLER spinal-mount...
"Harpoon"-type missiles, fired in a four-shot salvo will crit-the-crap out
of even the heaviest Soviet cruiser...  the only thing "exempt" from them is
the US battleships;  and *nothing* is exempt from *thier* 14" rifles...
        Offense has outstripped defense in the late 20th C, so everyone
builds lots of small ships to ensure there is still one platform with a
fire-control solution. =)

        I agree wholeheartedly.  My players *hate* boarding actions, because
you can (and they have) find yourself in the situation of loosing the action
to the crew of the ship you just disabled...  ;)

There is a theory that naval technology from the post Classical era onwards
can be viewed as the search for a way to return to the days of ram equipped
triremes. With those technologies one hit kills were tricky to acheive, but
not outrageously difficult. Since then ships became tougher in relation to
the weapons that they could mount, and this didn\'t change until exploding
shells made of good steel came along. Even with WWI technology ships were
very tough and difficult to sink when well made (look at the pounding the
German BCs took without sinking). Those major ships that sank did so as a
result of poor design rather than the superiority of offense over defense
(IMO if the technology was mature rather than cutting edge this wouldn\'t
have happened). 

I\'d suggest that in some ways this still applies today. Modern ships are
esay to sink because they aren\'t heavily armoured, not because we can\'t
protect them from other ships. It\'s the aircraft and submarines that heavy
suits of armour won\'t stop protect against, not other ships.

In Traveller there are no equivilents of aircraft and subs, with the
ability to bypass traditional defenses (except the Meson Gun, perhaps), and
so there is no reason to not put all that armour on. I see nothing wrong
with the HG has ships thumping away until someone loses enough armour to
get seriously damaged, or until a damage roll gets lucky. While I really
like TNE\'s _Battle Rider_ this is one aspect I don\'t like about it - it is
possible to design ships that can\'t be destroyed by similar sized ships
(mind you they generally can\'t hurt the other guy, either) unless Meson
Guns are in use, simply because armour doesn\'t go away.

Such as the time we managed to cram (for a _very_ short period of time!)
a company or so of powered armor infantry aboard a derelict
BROADSWORD-class merc cruiser.  We took a 25,000 dt Zhodani light
cruiser that way....  (The Zhos were looking for the former owners of
said BROADSWORD, the command and staff of a mercenary unit that had just
been decimated.  I could tell you more, but then I\'d have to degauss
your hard drive...and your _brain_.  ;-)

Pity we had to give the ship back...after the Imperial Navy boffins had
studied him for a couple of months.

Perhaps...but remember the drives supposedly go a year between
(intensive) maintenance, and that fuel is already taken care of in
the design. Also, most weapons have no ammunition requirements.
This should reduce the cargo needs somewhat from what a 20th c.
wet navy ship needs for combat.

I\'d go further than David:

I think it\'s incumbent upon you to try to retain as much of all previously
published material as possible.  Everything every published is available
from someone here on the TML, so if you do land the contract there will be
plenty of people who could check your work.

That said, if you discover a contradiction than you\'ll have to resolve it
(or indicate that sources are contradictory, which happens in The Real
World (tm) all the time). Just don\'t repeat the mistakes of some Imperium
Games authors, who decided that what they didn\'t know wasn\'t important to
fans, and basically tore up whole chunks of Traveller history.

Ah...the film has changed quite a bit in the last year.  Last February,
I stopped working on "Sunday Morning", the first film I was working on.
I met with some SFX guys, and I realized the vampire movie I was working
on would cost too much to make as my first feature.

So, I switched to another one of my screenplays, a film called
"October".  This is a love story drama.  I\'d put it in the same genre as
Good Will Hunting, Chasing Amy, and Indecent Proposal.

But, I get your point.  And, I do love gaming.

Take care,

Kenneth.

Pocket Empires Version 1.60
This is a spreadsheet to handle some of the calculations involved in running a 
Pocket Empires campaign. The spreadsheet currently:

  -  Calculates the GDP for each world
  -  Calculates Government Income, Fixed Expenses and
     Available Budget for each world
  -  Calculates Popularity and Prestige for each
     individual world
  -  Features a worksheet for calculating the prestige
     of multiworld Empires
  -  Calculates the trade codes for each world
  -  Calculates the initial Resource, Infrastructure and
     Culture scores for each world
  -  Calculates the Resource demand for each world
  -  Calculates the Resource trade benefits for each
     world

The sheet is capable of handling up to 350 worlds (roughly the size of an 
average Imperial Sector). To add more worlds just copy and paste the 
appropriate lines (however note there are fixed references to interstellar demand 
and import and export benefits in rows S (resouces available) and W (total 
GDP) of the GDP sheet and these will need to be edited manually [all 
references to "Constants!" sheet]).

    By Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation of Planets

Twas the night before Christmas
Stardate unknown,
We were completing a scan
Upon the neutral zone

When what on the screen, Data had perceived
A hailing frequency moving at warp speed.
"I\'m picking up a vessel new to the Federation
With an apparent greeting  -
A salutation!"

As Ferenghi before the pressed latinum gleam
Came a cluster of stars in a tractor beam
When out in subspace
There arose anti-matter
I quickly called "Mr. Ryker
"Let us deal with the matter."

More rapid than Klingons
The onslaught had begun
I opened hailing frequencies
"Set Phasers to stun!"

When what to my astounded eyes I did see
Was an antiquated sleigh
>From another century
With an arrogant driver
Holding hostages I knew
It could only be my odious adversary
Q!

Those who pulled the sleigh
Filled me with rage,
Then with fear
They were heroes of our past
As sort of human reindeer

"On with you, my crew
Spock, Kirk,
Bones and Uhuru,
On with you,
Nurse Chappell,
Yeoman Rand and Sulu!

To the top of the planet!
to the edge of Farpoint!
Together!
Together!
Let us not disjoint!!!

As Geordie checked for damage
Dr. Crusher prepared
To tend to any crewmen
Who might be ensnared

"Speak not a word more, Q,"
I said with a sneer
"Just tell me,
What the blazes are you doing here?"

"I haven\'t the time for your insolent pranks
Since you\'re not with MY crew,
Then kindly break ranks"

As I stood at my post,
Worf readied to fight
But I held out my hand saying,
"Q\'s leaving!  Right?!!"

He answered me not
But went straight to his work
And pointing a finger
He turned with a jerk

More rapid than force fields
The ship had been full
Of presents, and trimmings
Transcending the dull

"Lighten up, old Jean-Luc,
Don\'t be such a bore.
It\'s Christmas for mortals
The Q gave you the store.

"While you certainly are
An inferior form,
But for at least one day
Even Q\'s can be warm."

I admit I was stunned
As though hit by a Borg
But this vessel had been
As dead as a morgue

There had been no adventures,
No crises to handle,
And we needed this hoiday
Then Q lit a wax candle

Q went straight to a sack
And withdrew many presents
Handing each one to a crew member
One to every one present

"Here, Guinan,
Here, Data
Here, Ryker and Troi
A bar guide
A compass
A Ouija board toy"

The gifts Q gave out
All seemed so appropo\'
That it had phased me greatly,
"This cannot be so!"

"I cannot believe
You are who you claim.
I think if you ARE Q,
Then this is a game!

You\'ll set us all up
And then we\'ll be your pawns
Take it all away,
And make yourself gone!"

Then Q gave out a sigh,
And blew on a ship\'s whistle
His disguise dissapeared
Like the down of a thistle

And now he was changed
To a jolly old elf
And I laughed as I saw him
In spite of myself.

He had a white beard
And a pulchritudinous belly
That shook when he laughed
Like some replicated jelly

Then I heard him exclaim,
E\'re he beamed out of sight,
"Merry Christmas, Trekkers all
And to all a good night!"

Stuart,

How did you get around the prblems with T4\'s encounters and Alien creature
generation? Did you use MT when the problems appeared?

It may be owned by *very* unfriendly people. Or it may be easy to live

But compare passage costs. High or middle passage costs a *lot* more
than airfare. And there\'s still the problem of the "nice" world
possibly being off limits.

Yeah, for one thing, there\'s a 50% chance that the amino acids have the
wrong handedness. And the same goes for sugars. As I recall Earth has
right-handed amino acids and left-handed sugars, but I may have that
backwards. 

At a minimum wrong-handed material has *no* food value. At worst, it\'s
actively detrimental. 

So you could have a garden world that you could starve to death on. And
establishing "Terran" plants and animals in the face of a healthy
native ecology won\'t be much fun.

Another possibility is that there are *natives*, and they don\'t want a
bunch of "aliens" running around on their planet.

The wrong-handedness bit is the most *likely* form of
bio-incompatability, but others are possible, such as lacking vital
amino acids, having large amounts of amino acids not found in terran
life, or having some form of carbohydrate *other* than sugar & starch
be how the plant life stores energy.

Any of these can be a mean, rotten trick to play on characters when
they land on an unexplored "garden" world.

SHIP\'S DESCRIPTIVE PARAGRAPH

2050 - Alpine Class Planetary Assault Ship (Type BT)
TL 10.  1000 tons.
Using a 1000-ton, Cylinder hull, the Alpine-Class Planetary Assault Ship
(Type BT) carries a full company to their intended point of invasion.  She
carries enough Jump Capsule launchers and High-Survivability Capsules to
ensure that the entire unit makes the LZ in one wave.  An attack shuttle
follows in bringing down ready-for-action G-Carriers to support the troops.
It is performance-rated at jump-1, 1-G acceleration and 20EP.
Fuel tankage for 140 tons supports the power plant for 8 weeks and 1 jump-1.
The ship is  fitted with fuel scoops and a purification plant.
Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model/2bis.
There are 91 staterooms, no standard low berths and no emergency low berths.
The ship has 10 turrets. There are 15 beam lasers mounted in five turrets
organised into five batteries.  There are 15 missile racks mounted in five
turrets organised into five batteries.   For defence it has an agility of
0.  There is a 13.5-ton magazine and are 10% nuclear weapons normally carried.
There are 132 ship\'s vehicles.  123 Jump-Troop High-Survivability Capsules,
8 G-Carriers and 1 Shuttle are carried.
Cargo capacity is 14 tons.
The hull is partially streamlined.
All of the Alpine\'s batteries are tied into counterbattery systems, to allow
defence-suppression by orbital bombardment in support of the landing.
There are 0.67 tons of waste space.
The Alpine-Class Planetary Assault Ship (Type BT) requires a crew of 23.  10
Command Section, 3 Engineering, 10 Gunnery and 2 Flight Section are
required.  3 full UN-CMC platoons are carried.
The Shuttle Pilot operates the Shuttle.  The G-Carriers are operated by the
Marines.
The ship costs MCr401.81, including architects fees and takes 120 months to
build.  24 of these ships were built between 2050 and 2058.  The lead ship
was the UN-DNS Alps.

14.  Notes						
The Alpine-Class Planetary Assault Ship carries a full company to their
intended point of 
invasion.  She carries enough Jump Capsule launchers and High-Survivability
Capsules to ensure 
that the entire unit makes the LZ in one wave.  An attack shuttle follows in
bringing down 
ready-for-action G-Carriers to support the troops.  All of the Alpine\'s
batteries are tied 
into counterbattery systems, to allow defense-suppresion by orbital
bombardment in support 
of the landing.

COMMENTS

        I did this up in response to someone\'s question about Kton-troop
carriers.  I kept the size and TL down for use in my TNEC universe.  You
could carve a beach-head with a few of this size of ship, while other ships
moved re-enforcement troops in more slowly over the next few hours.  The HSC
jump systems are from Striker Advanced Rules, and cost Cr50,000 each...
Finest kit money can buy for Jump Troops.
        A TL 15 version at 10Kton gives you 15 fully equipped platoons as
per above (42 Marines per platoon, 615 capsules, 15 shuttles and 120
G-Carriers), plus 2Jp2 range & 2g\'s, with combat systems upgraded to add
factor 3 armor, 5 USP 9 repulsors, 4 USP 5 PAWs, USP 9 Nuclear Dampers, and
has 100 tons of cargo for extended operations.  If anyone wants the ship
design sheet for that one or the SDP, email me and I\'ll send it to you.

        Comments, questions and corrections always welcome...

Dear Miss Ditzie

It appears I will shortly be in need of a high-capacity point-defense
system, capable of dealing with individually-targeted cluster bombs.  A
repulso-based system capable of throwing incoming munitions back at the
invading rotters has a certain charm, don\'t you think?

Would you, perchance, have time in your busy schedule to accomodate my
request?


A sincere admirer

Here, here.  I\'ll confess that I refuse to consider the bulk of M:0 canon
IMTU for that very reason.  My biggest problem with M:0 was that it
basically started by ignoring previously published material, and never 
looked back.  The products by and large "felt" as if they didn\'t care for
the history and tradition of Traveller itself - that this was the way it
was and if I didn\'t like it, I didn\'t have to buy it.

Well, I didn\'t.  Not that there weren\'t problems in the product, but to
be honest, being in the con business, after the initial release (core 
rules), the enthusiasm of the faithful waned - and potential new players
were very aware of it.  It didn\'t attract the TNE crowd, because the
background wasn\'t relevant.  It lost the CT crowd, because while the rules
did their best to "look" like CT, it wasn\'t.

Rob, I seriously hope that Marc and others who write for Traveller, as
well as Loren and SJG, and any others who work on the next edition of 
Traveller, have those two paragraphs in front of them at all times.

I\'ll go so far as to say I won\'t buy anything unless it conforms to that
"statement of faith".

The Encounter generation is a amalgamation of the CT, MT and T4 rules. There
is a bit of them all in the code. It seems to work okay though?

It is a Visual Basic program so, it should work with Windows NT. If someone
wishes to convert the program to the Mac or Linux then I will happily
provide the source code. It isn\'t the tidiest or efficient bit of code ever
written, but it works pretty well.

Any feedback would on the program plus any errors that you notice in any of
the calculations would be appreciated.

I hope to add support for files created in Galactic 2.4 and Trav Tools in a
later version.

  "Planetary bombing factor" is the number of tons allocated to magazines for

  This doesn\'t seem particularly useful except for determining a basic structure

MacOS - try Metator at http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/RPS.html for
something similar by Rob Prior.

MacOS - The domain level editor Imperial Grand Survey 2 is at

M0 Campaign didn\'t violate canon as it stood but was massed up by the
(flawed) First Survey data destroying the text which was written around the
original Atlas maps. Many people have objected to the darker feel to the
early Imperium but that isn\'t a canon issue. I know I find it more
believable than the fluffy shiny Imperial expansionism so have argued for.

Psionic Institutes and Imperial Squadrons have no major canon flaws to my
knowledge, nor does Alien Archive.

Missions of State (aside from the Joe Walsh and MJD scenarios) damaged
canon badly.

The Anililik Run is an old style AD&D module, nothing like the original
CORE proposal. The author didn\'t understand what a jumpdrive was, and
played it like a bad cartoon SF show crossed with Trek and The Keep on the
Borderlands.

Agree - we found the main IG books difficult to sell at GenCon UK 98. The
BITS 101\'s went well though but they are more generically compatible.

Marc has repeatedly stated that IG either ignored his comments or gave him
things to check in a day or so.

Andy Lilly would say much the same - even manuscripts edited to match canon
were changed or not checked by IG.

Dave Golden has also commented that IG printed the first usable playtest
version of FFS2.

I can see your viewpoint entirely.

IG\'s products were overpriced, poorly edited, and really badly typeset.
IIRC someone commented that GDW had forgotten more about layout going from
MT to TNE than IG had ever known. The lack of backpage blurb didn\'t help.
And IG didn\'t pay the authors... Opportunities to remedy mistakes weren\'t
taken eg the corrected world data and locations for First Survey...

I can accept that. Now what is the used value?

Since the book has the new price, 10% of book seems easier to look up as a
guide price.

The actual price will (of course) depend on circumstances and negociation.

Unless players start using trading skills and spend a week of so
investigating the market, I\'d probably start the bidding at 10% if they
are selling and 100% if they are buying.

Then again, I\'d be wanting 200-400% for the new stuff :-)

6G\'s is NEVER enough! If you are fighting 6G ships, you need much faster
missiles in order to catch up (OK, this assumes a "stern-chaser" scenario).
I tweaked the old "Missiles" special supplement to create standard
(civilian) 10G turret missiles, with military bay missiles coming in at
21G. This means that Mayday combat becomes more like HG, in that the
missiles fire and hit in the same turn - and you don\'t need those pesky
missile markers cluttering up your battlespace.

BTW, also gives wonderful KKM effects if you are using this (CT) form of
space combat...

I *think* these rules are up on my web site (?? I don\'t have access at
work, so I\'ll have to go back and have a look tonight).

Well if you\'re willing to spend the credits I\'ve got a TL13 missile that\'ll
do 17G136 with a 100kt warhead. FF&S1, of course.

Concerning WW II battleship/battlecruiser main guns (post-Washington
Treaty designs):

France:  DUNKERQUE-class - 13"/50 cal; RICHELIEU-class - 15"/45 cal

Germany:  "Pocket battleships" and SCHARNHORST-class - 11"/55 cal;
BISMARCK-class - 15"47 cal

Great Britain:  NELSON-class - 16"/45 cal; KING GEORGE V-class - 14"/45
cal

Italy:  VITTORIO VENETO-class - 15"/50 cal

Japan:  NAGATO-class - 16"/45 cal; YAMATO-class - 18.1"/45 cal

United States:  NORTH CAROLINA and SOUTH DAKOTA classes - 16"/45 cal;
IOWA-class - 16"/50 cal; ALASKA-class - 12" guns (caliber unknown)

[note:  all gun sizes and calibers come from the SEEKRIEG Ship Data
book, so I take no responsibility for errors therein]

ObTrav:  Do naval architects in Traveller tweak their main armament
designs as much as Terran battleship designers apparently did?  (I know
that I do, using FF&S2.)  If so, do Traveller-era wargamers debate the
relative merits of various battleships and their associated main weapons
as vigorously as 20th-century Terran wargamers and naval enthusiasts do?

  Don\'t know about you, but if I was a highly trained space ops specialist
with half a deceade of tech school behind me, I wouldn\'t work in a place
like this for much under Cr60000 a year. I mean, you do need _skilled_
workers for a first stage vacuum colony. I\'ll admit the time frame was a
bit  off considering the difficulty of travel. One long vacation a year
(with low-berth travel of course) would probably be more on the mark.

   As for the family, unless you are married to a person who just happens
to work in the same field, you end up with a very unhappy spouse working a
minimum pay job that doesn\'t match his/her training at all. (Not like
there\'s too many jobs on a small mining outpost for a high-end
admin/service professionals. There\'ll be some, but not for nearly all of
the family members with unrelated professions.)

  And what happens when the kids start growing up? You will not find a
good university on a resource world... hell, you\'d be lucky to find a
decent high-school.

  There happens to be oxygen bound into many refined metal compounds, the
same goes for plastics. Not much of course, but if you\'re exporting
millions of tons a year... Let\'s face it, you won\'t support an economy of
several billion people exporting raw materials.

 Define huge, the temperature at ground zero is certainly enough to
vaporize rock, but since energy density falls off relative to the second
power of distance, the temperature is going to be below melting point of
rock just a few hundred meters away even for a megaton-scale device. After
that you just have a bunch of hyprpressurized gases blowing a huge warren
of massively unstable cracks around the melt cave.

  To support billions of people you\'d need cubic klicks of cave, hence
hundreds to thousands of _big_ nukes. At around Mcr10 a pop this is
starting to hurt. You\'d have to do this in one stage too, not like you can
expand with nuclear blasts with people living next door. Also, after the
blasts you get to wait a few decades before the radiation falls to livable
levels. (Irradiated bedrock is a bitch to clean up even wit hi-tech
toys...)

  I hear the Ruskies tried this. (Not 600km from our border, I might add,

  All of these are feasible, and exist IMTU too, and I\'m not saying some
of them might not grow really large, but many hundreds all around seems
stretching it a bit.

 No argument, very good for mining. You\'d just need tend of thousands to
excavate a sizeable colony, and the buggers cost upwards of a million in
sufficiently lage sizes.

  Irradiated rock again! No way around this one, no matter how hi-tech

  Well, from where I sit being easy to live on _is_ a resource worth the
trouble. And as for the unfriendly people, if there are a couple of
hundred of them (you can find these on the map), and a megacorp wants the
garden world (maybe to sypply several nearby mining colonies), the odds
are that scattering of unfriendly natives will simply disappear.

  Why not go for low-passage, at TL-12+ this is utterly safe and much
cheaper. (Admittedly more than one trip a year would probably still be
unfeasible.) A highly trained professional has to make at least kCr50-80 a
year (as straight salary or profit%) to even consider working in a place
like this. With dough like this 10000 a year isn\'t going to hurt _too_
much. 
  And if you\'r megacorporate employer says the world next door is not
off limits, the odds are it won\'t be, I mean let\'s face it these guys
practically _own_ the Imperium.

  Actually, on a planet with wrong handed amino-acids it\'s a cakewalk
compared to a world with compatible biosphere. Incompatible chemistry
means local diseases won\'t affect the colonists and their plants and
animals at all. Once you have clared a patch of soil, you just put in
Terran microbes and whatnot, and the crop plants can grow with no risk of
infection. (Somebody suggested doing this for dead vacuum dust, I\'d say
sterilized soil is easier.) Pests and predators stupid enough to eat
anything Terran will either get smart or starve to dearth pretty quick.

  See my earlier post. (Duh... Frank, wasn\'t there like some dumb natives,
who didn\'t want us colonists here?  What natives, do you like see anybody
around? *evil grin*)

  All of these have the same solution, wipe out the local ecosphere as you
expand your own. Incopatability works both ways. The real problem here
might be the green groups and other "regressionist weenies" (a megacorp
view, not mine) whining about humans meddling with alien biospheres.

  Well, since you brought it up, remember Beta Canum. It has an
incopatible biosphere too, and dispite this manages to be the bread basket
of the entire French arm, not to mention probably the richest and most
flurishing colony in known space.

  Yes you could, and you\'d be safe for the moment, but what about the
colonists, who can\'t afford their own nuke damper (or are too scrawny to
lug around several tons of metal).
  One thing nobody will ever convince me to buy is, that the damper effect
continues after the field disappears. Goes against every bit of knowledge
I have of nuclear physics. I mean nuclear decay of unstable elements is a
_fundamental_ piece of physics.
 Even if the damper causes every unstable nucleus to decay instantaneously
(pretty far fetched) the resulting burst of radiation would irradiate
furhter nuclei, and you\'d be back to square one. (Sorry for the rant
folks.)
  BTW even a nuke damper won\'t protect you from radioactive dust and such,
but that is much easier to clean up anyway (especially at high TL:s).

        Hi, Eppu!
        If our colonists are that concerned about it, put a dome over the
field and go hydroponics....  it means that the Terran microbes and whatnot
would be less likely do something unpleasant with the local enviroment, and
the pest/predators issue goes away.  In fact, I think initial surface
colonies are going to be less like a 1800\'s Wild-west strip-town than they
will be like an 1100\'s English Baronial castle;  everything important to
survival inside a barrier wall/ dome of some kind until the colonists get a
better idea of how much the Scout survey missed.

        Here I disagree with you....  I think that the Scout Service would
have noted the existance of a sentient culture and it is entirely possible
that they or the Navy might be "monitoring" activities in the system to
avoid repeated genocides.  If you presume that the Imperium is of a "good"
bent at all, allowing the Corporations to commit repeated genocides of "dumb
natives" is simply asking for them to consider going after bigger fish (Hey,
Boss...  You know that asteroid colony in the next system where they just
discovered all that  high grade uranium?  I heard they had an unfortuate
outbreak of Ebola-II;  wiped the whole colony out.  We might be able to
"salvage" something if we go check it out).

looking at the "free" services, some of which _do_ offer what I need.

I have a few possibilities.  One requires that I maintain a (paid third-party)

window every time a member page on their server is accessed, with advertising
that they choose.  One creates a pop-up only on first entry to a particular
member web site, again with advertising that they choose.  None of these are as
attractive as my current space provider, but the arrangement with my current
space provider is best described as "charity", and must be considered subject
to revocation at any time.  Therefore, I\'m exploring my alternatives.  I\'m not
going to move until and unless it becomes necessary, but I want to be prepared

I wouldn\'t be surprised if fares wouldn\'t be part of the contract, kind of
like mercenary tickets.  In fact, exactly like mercenary tickets - it\'s
just different kinds of off-world labour.

There are fly-in fly-out mines around the place on Earth, where the
companies stump up the bucks for lots of airfares (one every few weeks or
so).  A single, more expensive round trip isn\'t unthinkable.

  Still have a bit of a hard time understanding how this is supposed to
help you. (No, I\'m not going to do the same rant again.) Traveller is
quite vague on what nuke dampers actually do, but the damper boxes used
for transporting nuclear explosives etc. strongly point to a transient
effect. Othervise the warhead would be a useless lump (of what?) coming
out of the box. Also the FF&S1 technobabble on dampers seems to imply an
effect that only continues as long as the field is applied, though this is
far from clear.
    
 It is stated that you can speed up the decay of unstable nuclei, but
this is no miracle cure either. The decay causes more particle and EM
radiation, which in turn created more irradiated materials. Of course, not
all released particles will react so a damper used in this fashion will
cause a steady decline in the rad levels. This would still take months of
bombardment though, which I would hardly call waving.
   BTW I did some quick math, and a conservative estimate would be around
10000 megaton-scale nukes to create enough space fo 5 billion inhabitants,
not cheap. Also, youd need at least one damper per blast site plus power
for them. (Add another 40-50 billion to the bill.) Of course a project
like this would take several years, so add hazard pay and life support for
several hundred or more highly skilled workers (probably not much more
than a few billion credits though).

  I agree totally. With a reasonably hospitable atmosphere you can build
square km:s of light plastic dome for pocket ghange. These are also good
for starting the soil claiming projects and later, if the colony does
well and there are no nasty surprises, the domes can come off, and you can
use the areas underneath them for the basis of your further terraforming.

  Actually I was thinking a pre-existing _human_ colonization of
unfriendly bent. An indigenous intellect might be trickier to remove, but
still quite doable if the incentive is good enough. (Granted, no sane
megacorp would pull this one simply for farmland.)

  I dont. This is a matter of personal tastes of course, but I just can\'t
think of a machinery as massive as the imperium as very good natured.
Practically the only thig in T4 I agreed with was the delicious
flip-side of the coin views in M0 book. I figure the Imperium would never
have gotten as far as it did without a few atrocities and outright
genocides of its own.

  I find this a perfectly plausible scenario, that probably happens every
now and then in the big, brutal, cut-throat world of Imperial business.
The megacorps are pretty much what keeps the realm running, so what\'s a
little genocide between business pals, eh? From the viewpoint of Imperial
bureaucracy a single individual (or a few thousand of them for that
matter) is going to be utterly irrelevant.

Point taken. I would suggest that, while the `intensive\' maintenance
schedule might be once a year, there\'s going to be a lot of preventative
maintenance happening. I\'d also submit that, while higher tech. gear
tends to have higher availability, better maintainability and better
reliability than older gear, this is to an extent achieved through large
stores holdings of line-replaceable units.

I\'m also thinking food. Is this accounted for somewhere, or are we
assuming hokey ST replicators?

Missile armed ships are going to have *big* replenishment requirements,
too - esp. if they are involved in intensive combat or planetary
bombardments.

During my tours in the Military I too saw New vehicles break down often and
older vehicles (One in particular that was actually expected to fail while
on manuvers) not break down, I beleave it would rely on the following factors

1. if regular maint is being preformed.
2. if additional inspections are being performed above and beyond normal
maint. 
	In the above example the older M119A1 APC (I hope I got those numbers
correct) had a history of breaking down  within 6-8 hours of moving to \'the
field\'. A new driver was assigned and he babied the APC the entire field
problem (I.E. he inspected the vehicle each time he stopped and actually
had to replace One track extender bar) The Company Commander was so
overjoyed that this APC did not have to be towed back in for once, the
solder was given a three day pass.)
3. Random Failures. 
	It seems in real world military (what a shock) 99.9999999999999% of all
parts are made by the lowest bidder and for some odd reason they are also
made of inferior material and are prone to sudden and critical failures.
This practice of buying from the lowest bidder will always continue. I have
even read about a case (which the U.S. Military lost) inwhich the Army
purchased 20 computers and discovered they would not function, the
contracters response was. "Operational? No where in the contract did it say
the computers had to work."

	What this would mean in game terms is that the GM must roll for equipment
problems and failure EACH and EVERY day of continuous operation, Starting
with the moment the equipment was turned on. The first roll would indicate
if this was a operational critical piece of equipment (will the device work
or not) the second roll would indicate if the failure was a critical or
normal failure.
Modified by the following:
	1. If regular maint was performed. (positive mod if yes, cumulative neg
mods if no.)
	2. If the part was shoddy in construction (neg mod if yes.)

	Unfortunalty IRL the sad truth is every single mechanical part is waiting
to break down, I have seen thermostats die every other month, starters,
alternators, water pumps, fuel pumps, transmissions etc etc I have had cars
that every other week I was replacing parts and then again I have had cars
that ran so smoothly I didn\'t have to add or change the oil for 6 months
and I was inspecting the oil weekly.
	If you have had any experince with the military and vehicles you would
know they spend regularly scheduled time in  motor pools doing PREVENTIVE
MAINTENCE in addition to upgrades and repairs. I have seen motor pool
reports that have an average of 20-25% of the battalions vehicles in a non
operational status, the goal would be to have less then 10% on the list and
often the Chief Warrent Officer would find some lame excuse to remove a
vehicle (The parts on it\'s way right now, so we can take #C22 off the
list.) Then again I have seen Warrents make sure they have EVERY single
broke vehicle on that list to insure they get the proper maint funding
regardless of how it makes their job performance look.

	How would it affect Civilian ships? the same or even worse as the
civilians do not have the same resourse\'s to draw on that a military has.
(it would be safe to say that each vehicle has to have at leaset 10 maint
books, one for the motive, one for the electronics, commo, weapons systems,
etc, etc)  If a group does not have a dedicated mechanic that spends almost
the entire game working on EVERY part of the engine, life support, etc 
	Then again the GM could exclude real life and just make an easy maint roll

	Yes I meandered fecklessly, but I been there and done that in regards to
military maintence. It\'s a whole nother bear if you have PC\'s running
around with civilian versions of military hardware. Most people would not
spend every moment working on their transports unless it was making funny
noises.
  
	In an article in Soldier of Fortune mag, there was a discussion about a
group of civilians that had faked their way into control of a retired
warship (mueseum piece), Some of the incidents were humorous, (they almost
sank the ship at dock) but it eventually cost the sponsers ALL of their
money and the warship had to be sold for scrap. The civilains bailed and
are still being looked for.

Heres a thought: what about a maint shop at each port and as a requirement
each time a civilian ship puts in at a planet it must have a certified
inspection? (This could be a free inspection or 1/2 cost, or full cost, but
required.) The military does this IRL so what if the imperial Goverment
knowing that civilians lack the expertise or resourses makes this a
requirement. It\'s done now for Emissions and in some states a vehicle safty
inspection is required annually. It would make for extended visits and
adventure hooks.

No, the idea (as I see it) is that that the decays occur at such low
energies that the decay products (including free neutrons, alphas, and the
like) are so wimpy that they can\'t effectively irradiate surrounding
material.  There\'s plenty of radiation produced when you reduce nuclear
binding energies enough to spontaneously fission every unstable nucleus in
the area, but it\'s radiation at much lower energies-per-particle than we
see in natural fission.

0A nuke damper has a field with two nodes, one that makes nuclear
material more stable, and one that makes it less stable. You focus
the appropriate node on your target depending on the effect you desire.
Therefore you can stabilize a case of californium rounds by building
nuke dampeners into it that focus the stabilizing node into the case.

The destabilizing node is used to make nuclear materials inert,
not just while the node is focused on it, but for good - it changes
the rate neutrons are shed by the radioactive matter. It seems that
you can affect how this energy is shed as well - Nuke Dampers
don\'t seem intended to make a nuke missile explode early (an
effect of instantly turning up the reaction rate), they must cause a
rapid but controlled release of energy.

In the case of civilian decontamination operations, a nuclear dampener
would make an area emit energy for a brief period of time - perhaps
as neutron radiation, perhaps as X-rays, who knows what. Afterwards,
the area is non-radioactive - perhaps even less radioactive than normal
background levels.

I\'m still wondering what would happen if you focused a starship-grade
nuclear dampener into the middle of the enemy bridge. It\'s accurate
enough to sweep a 12G missile, you\'d think you could hit a person with it.

Actually, I think it just causes the radioactive matter to decay into stable
forms.

Actually, increasing the reaction rate probably wouldn\'t cause a nuclear weapon
to explode early, though it might cause it to melt.  Nuclear weapon critical
mass is controlled by neutron emission per fission and neutron capture
cross-section, not rate of decay.

Of course, the effect of nuclear dampers as described (increases/decreases the
strong nuclear force) almost certainly wouldn\'t have the described effects. 
The most probable effect of increasing the strength of the strong nuclear force
would be to set off a huge blast of radiation as all the nuclei in the area
realigned themselves at a lower energy level, and reducing the strong nuclear
force would require enough energy to make up for the mass difference.  The
effect given for a nuclear damper suggests some sort of field which modifies
quantum tunneling, or possibly adjusts the range of the strong nuclear force in
some inobvious manner.

Probably standard emissions, which mostly means alpha, beta, gamma.

Probably nothing, unless the person was currently significantly contaminated
with radioactive materials.

Recall how much of the ship is solid metal, or empty space. On a

The maneuver drives on an Azhanti High Lightning are described as
"maintenance free" - probably a description from a salesman\'s
product literature, rather than the engineering crew\'s maintenance
schedule. Still, it may be that Stellar tech level drives have big parts that
don\'t wear out much.

Note that most battle damage can have the effects reversed by
damage control, but still needs to be repaired in a shipyard. This
indicates that whatever they\'re making repairs with is something
less than complete replacement units.

These make me think that starships can make do with a limited
amount of storage space, but zero cargo space is just taking it too
far.

Here\'s a thought. What if the hull displacement percentages for
bridge, drives, weapons, etc. include within themselves space for
spare parts and consumable stores? If that were the case, my
whole idea for cargo requirements on warships goes out the airlock.

I\'m thinking of the energy required to render a pile of uranium inert,

do any harm. What happens to you if someone fiddles with the

Seems to me the whole idea behind the nuclear dampener is that it
is a device special made to fool with the strong and weak nuclear
forces - class it with jump drives, meson screens, contragrav and
all those other things we build with the Trav design sequences but
don\'t quite understand in the realworld (tm) yet.

  Guess the megacorp CEO forgot to pay the Imperial family\'s dividends

  Certainly, I just think mopping up a few hundred isolationist natives in
the name of progress is way below it. And if there are too many pesky
natives, the LIC:s can just call in the navy to exterminate them - also in
the name of progress of course.

  No argument here as long as you _can _ do business with the natives.
However, if the said natives are a couple of hundred bumpkins silly enough
to claim they own the planet, don\'t want you there and don\'t want
anything to do with your products, things start looking a bit different.

Well, it doesn\'t require _any_ energy to render a pile of uranium inert (it
just requires lots of time).  Unless a nuclear damper is strong enough to break
down stable atoms (in which case its a disintegrator, and much higher tech
level) it won\'t have any effect on a human.

  Even a rapid but controlled release of energy is still radiation. The
radiation released would produce more unstable nuclei, not as much as
previously, but some. The radiation level would drop (maybe on a log
curve), but all radiation wouldn\' just magically disappear.

IMTU, the corps played by certain rules. You didn\'t slaughter the

the only places in-system where they could buy food and air, or
the only places they could sell their ore. Pretty soon you own the
miners as well. Economic domination, not armed invasion.

The Megacorps were pretty much OK as long as what they were
doing could be seen as primarily economic in nature. Declaring a
shooting war against an Imperial planet (no matter how small)

Bear in mind that radiation usually does _not_ create more radiation; neutron
emission is actually quite rare as a mode of radioactive decay, and that\'s the
only form of radiation which can create more radiation.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Californium is a highly unstable radioactive isotope. In Traveller, it\'s
used for micronukes - ammunition that will, when mashed flat against
a tank, attain critical mass (some of the time) and give you a nice
punch. If you didn\'t have a way to keep it stable for long periods of time,
it would be useless the day after you took it home from the weapons
plant.

While the stabilizer node of the nuclear dampener is focused on the
californium, it doesn\'t radiate energy, doesn\'t revert to a more stable
isotope, it just sits there. When you take it out of the box (say by
firing it at something), it leaves the field of effect and immediately
becomes it\'s dangerously unstable and lovable self. Remember, that\'s 
the _stabilizing_ node we\'re talking about.

The other node, the _destabilizing_ one, is the node most relevant for
civilian decontamination operations. While the stabilizing node
prevents radioactive materials from changing at all, the destabilizing
node causes radioactive materials to change at an incredible rate,
shedding neutrons and energy until the radioactive materials
are no longer radioactive. The energy released may be dangerous
while the process is occurring, but apparently doesn\'t make surrounding
materials radioactive.

The effect is transient. The materials stop changing once you turn
off the dampener - changes made to the materials will be permanent.
A fusion rifle has transient effects as well - it only makes people
dead while you\'re shooting them, they generally don\'t get any deader 
afterwards.

It doesn\'t have to.

Humans evolved in a pretty radioactive environment. Get the radiation
even a little bit down a log curve and people can handle it. Most
environmental cleanup operations have an allowed tolerance level

FFS2 takes it into account, but only for low tech IMO (and TU).  Requires
variously stored foods (refrigerated, low berthed <g>, etc) unless one wants
algae vat food or to store livestock and have gardens, etc etc.  This should
be limited to Traveller tech level 9 (maybe 10) and down IMO.

A higher tech idea is in GURPS: Biotech, that of "Fauxflesh Vats."  It\'s the
(GURPS) TL9 meat version of hydroponics.  A "biomass" of geneered lean meat
tissue is sustained by the ships life support and is continuously growing.
It\'s harvested as needed or when it gets too big for its vat(s).   For MTU, a
certain number of vats are included with the life support costs of the ship.
I haven\'t decided on it, exactly, but i following the simple guideline of
Biotech...  small ships have a limited number (possibly only one, which
greatly limits variety ("Beef again?")).  Being a gearhead, i\'ll probably get
around to codifying it sometime, if someone doens\'t beat me to it, but it\'s
not high on my queue right now. ; )  Of course, given a catastrophic incident,
its possible the biomass could die or otherwise need replacement.  Malfunction
in the life support system could just fall on this rather than something that
could immediately kill the crew (temp/air/etc).

Another idea is cloning food.  W/ a forced-growth tank, it can be done pretty
quickly.
For really high tech, samples aren\'t even needed to begin cloning.  MT Ref\'s
Companion says individual organs can be cloned at TL13.

I don\'t know that you _can\'t_ do that.  But if you have that
many people, there are going to be some left over to start
making things (rather than having them imported), fixing
thing, and doing things for other people.  Thus industrial
and service sectors will develop naturally.  If you already
have a market of several billion, it is that big a step to
exporting those goods and services....

  These are, naturally, the first courses of action. If they fail it\'s
time to finance a few unscrupulous starmercs to pull a black op, or even
to anonymously pay off a pirate band to do the job (you know,
deniability). A certain (canonical) megacorp even maintains a rather well
staffed black ops arm forn stuff like this, with a track record for
regularly screwing the INI stooges. (Now let\'s see, I think it was called
Vemene)

  As I said, only if you\'re moronic enough to get caught. I\'d bet more
than one megacorp with a none-too-bright CEO ended its days this way...

P.S: Yeah, I know I\'m a sick bastard, and my game certainly reflects this.

  But is it in this case? Looking over the decription of nuke dampers, it
seems logical that this would be exactly the type of decay they would
cause. Don\'t know, though. As was already stated, this technology is
_way_ beyond our current understanding, so I think we\'d better leave
detailed explanations up to individual referees.

  Certainly not. The point I was arguing stated this _would_ happen. The
issue was the life support losses thus incurred. Surprising things can
contain oxygen/organic molecules, plastics do. The losses wouldn\'t be that
big p.u.m, and could certainly be replenished from outside. This is just
another thing that would eat into the total product of the economy.

 Yeah! Can you hazard a guess, which movie I was thinking of when I wrote

  I agree. But even this would take some pecievable time, don\'t you think?
It was the "waving things over with a nuke damper" part I was most

My take on it is kinda strange.  Sure, there will be plenty of good bucks to be
made exporting the raw materials.  There\'ll even be some more good bucks to be
made exporting semirefined materials.  There are also secondary sources of
exports as well.  Things like techniques and tools developed on that world
that will work someplace else, particularly if the tools and teechniques are
a couple TLs abouve the enduser\'s TL.

I can see this happening.

There\'s a lot more to a viable mining community than just running the mines.  
Think boomtowns in the old American West during the Gold Rush.  Miners need to 
eat, and if they\'re not going to be stuck buying instaheats off a Company 
boat, this means somebody\'s got to run the hydroponics and carniculture 
systems, *and* the food processing centers *and* the food distribution systems 
*and* waste management *and* atmospheric control.  Just a rough WASG, I\'d say 
you\'d need 5 support people in the background to put one miner in the mines, 
minimum.  You want to be the guy who\'s making and selling the pans to the gold 
miners.  And what do they do for recreation?  If you don\'t keep them busy in 
their offshift time, they\'ll get stircrazy and blood will fill the air 
filters.  Not good.  So you\'ll need security people and administrators to try 
to keep the stupidity to a minimum.  And entertainment workers (not 
necessarily prostitutes, mind you!) to keep the offshift workers busy.

Personally, I don\'t see *ANY* \'minimum wage jobs\' in a mining colony.

I\'d think the Company recruiters would pay top dollar for good educators, and 
part of a long-term contract would be for chances at Company-sponsored 
scholarships to the best and brightest of the little anklebiters offworld in a 
\'civilised\' system nearby.  You *DON\'T* want the next generation of miners and 
support people to be absolute uneducated idiots when you\'re working under 
hostile environments.  And the current crop of contract miners would *insist* 
on decent education for the rugrats before signing on.  After all, it\'s not 
like the Company is their last chance to make a buck...

Huh?  Why?  Given that nuclear dampers only affect radioactive materials (and
fusion reactions), it seems reasonable that it won\'t mysteriously cause them to
decay in a different way from how they normally decay (if it does anything but
accelerate/decelerate decay, it would probably cause non-radioactive materials
to start decaying too).  The description of nuke dampers doesn\'t entirely make
sense (and probably wouldn\'t have the effects its credited with in the game
system), but doesn\'t obviously encourage greater neutron emissions in any case.

I would, but unfortunately I don\'t have the Imperial Squadrons sourcebook.
However, it will probably be one of my next T4 purchases. ;-)

Speaking from a Gearhead-1 Credhead-1 GM-0 POV, I enjoy the
creative and world-building aspects of Traveller.  "Games" and
simulations give me some insight into real-world science,
technology, and economics and the interplay among them that I
would not get otherwise.  Sure, it\'s "play"...but it gives me
incentive to play with knowledge and skills that would otherwise rust
from disuse.

Speed.

The only G-Carrier that can fly near the speed of a CT or MT shuttle is the
Imperial Marine Grav APC (1000+ kmh). From (admittedly poor) memory, a MT
shuttle can fly at 2000+ kmh, while a G-Carrier can only manage 120 kmh.

Anyone with MT Encyc handy can feel free to correct these speeds.

The Imperium has a lot of other ways to stop megacorps and others from
crossing the line, and a need to do it, because as Walt says, the Megacorps
are the Imperium.

My favorite royalty story comes from Thailand. At one time, there were
student protests against the military government, and the military broke
them up with live ammunition. A representitive of the palace asked the
student leaders if they wanted to set up first aid stations in the palace
grounds, the students did so and within 48 hours the military government
had resigned.

Food itself isnt that much of an issue, if you have water recycling. I can
imagine half a kilo of dried food would be about right, and that means you
can put many people-months into a m3 of storage.

Canada\'s military on call for Y2K chaos

The Canadian government may invoke emergency powers in 2000 in
case chaos and panic results from the Y2K computer bug, the Ottawa
Citizen reported this week citing an official report.

``Among the activities that must be done to meet the problems
resulting from Y2000 failures is development of relevant emergency
orders and regulations required for the invocation of emergency
provisions under the Emergencies Act,\'\' the report said.

``In the worst case, we should consider the Emergencies Act a
potential source of special powers,\'\' the Year 2000 Contingency
Planning Group of Emergency Preparedness Canada said in
the report.

It recommended that the legislative procedures needed to
implement the Emergencies Act should be ready by the end of March
next year.

Defence ministry spokesman John Blakely told the paper
that invoking special powers was only a prudent contingency the
government was considering.

``The question of whether it will be required or not is
one that will have to be determined at the time,\'\' Blakely said.

According to the paper Canadian troops have already been
advised to prepare for what would be the greatest peacetime
deployment of soldiers in case of unrest or other troubles due to the
computer bug.

The deployment operation, known as ``Abacus,\'\' foresees
the imposition of martial law and soldiers assisting the
police, the paper said.

Computer experts have predicted many systems, including
those controlling banking, power and transportation, could shut
down with the advent of the next millennium as their two digit date
system fails to distinguish between 2000 and 1900.

The problem is that you have to not merely *sterilize* the soil, but
you have to *remove* the "wrong handed" chemicals, as they are *worse*
than useless. 

That\'s a *major* pain. You may be able to develop bacteria that break
down the wrong-handed protiens or sugars. But they\'ll be even happier
breaking down stuff with the *proper* handedness.

If a world has the "right" handedness and the like, you aren\'t going to
be in much danger from diseases or parasites. Things like fungal
infections are possible, but can be countered the same way normal
fungal infections are. 

You can use soil by merely killing the native organisms, no need to
break down compounds. The native stuff will compete with you. But that
won\'t be much worse than weeds on earth.

With a wrong-handed biosphere, you\'ll have all those useless chemicals
"clogging" the soil. If you break them down, the soil will work for
both terran *and* native life. And native life won\'t be bothered by any
leftover native compounds.

"Sambquh, remember those stupid aliens who tried to take away our land?"

For example, consider what happens to a proto-colony if the pissed off
natives stampede the local equivalent of a pre-1800 buffalo herd over
the colony site? (Hint: these herds were *miles* across and miles long).

Well, the alien bioshpere has the advantage of *size* on its side. As I
noted above, you\'d have to remove or breakdown "native" chemicals in
soil just to get to a point where native and terran organisms are on an
equal footing. And every time native material is deposited by wind or
rain or underground water seepage, it gets a bit of an advantage.

Sure, the native life can\'t eat teran life. But it *can* mangle it, and
choke it. And there\'s a lot more native life than terran.

Actually, a critical mass *won\'t* explode. Not unless it is *confined*
long enough for the reaction to proceed far enough. That\'s what the
explosive charge in the warhead does. It keeps the *initial* energy
release from scattering the fissionables before the reaction can get
very far.

If you just place a critical mass together, you\'ll get a *small*
explosion, which will partially melt the fissionables and scatter them
over a few feet or yards. 

This has happened in storage facilities when people screw up. 

So when the nuke "damper" (actually "accelerator" in this case) hits a
warhead, the subcritical mass(es) in the warhead will "catastrophically
disassemble". They\'ll release a large amount of energy, until the
energy release is high enough to melt them or to physically break them
up. This will happen *faster* than the explosives can react. 

So you\'ll get a burst of neutrons and x-rays/gamma rays, that will
trail off quickly (a few microseconds) as the mass(es) scatters. After
a few milliseconds the explosives will detonate and complete the
scattering of the warhead. 

So what was a missile will be an expanding cloud of contaminated
shrapnel. The blast will hardly be noticeable from a few miles off.

I\'d say it comes off as exactly the sort of radiation it would release
at normal decay rates. Just faster. That means mostly alpha and beta
radiation, with the occasional neutron and gamma. The alphas and betas
are very short ranged and will get absorbed by surrounding materials or
by a few yards of air. Their energy will wind up as heat.

The main factor in using a "damper" to clean up a site is whether or
not there are any fissionables present. They can release a lot of
energy when decay is accelerated, and they release a lot of neutrons,
which tend to make surrounding materials radioactive. 

So after a slow start (to check for enexpected fissionables) I\'d say
that you\'d turn up the decay rate until the site is producing heat at
the max rate you are willing to allow. 

You don\'t want it to melt (usually). And you don\'t want the heat to
create strong uprafts which might carry away contaminated dust. You
also want to avoid steam explosions in the ground. And avoid
radioactive steam.

But radiation does *not* make non-radioactive materials radioactive.
The only way to do *that* is via neutron capture or emission. 

Most radioactives do not *emit* neutrons, so they cannot induce
radioactivity. The alpha and beta particles emitted can break up
molecules and are thus dangerous to life forms. But they don\'t create
radioactivity.

CPAWS (electron beams in this case) do *not* induce radioactivity!
If they did, every TV set, computer monitor, and other CRT would have
to be treated as nuclear waste.

Radiation <> Radioactivity

The high energy particle impacts will create X-rays or gamma rays. They
*won\'t* make the target radioactive. So anyone in the target area will
get irradiated. But when the beam is turned off, there will be *no*
radiation present.

*Nobody* with money or the intelligence required to aquire that
training you value is going to ride in a low berth except in an
emergency. A 10% chance of death each time means that there\'s only an
81% chance of surviving the round trip. And only a 35% chance of
lasting through a 5 year term with a round trip each year.

What makes you think that people with the required skills (which will
be about as common as various types of construction worker skills here
on earth) will be married to that sort of person?

Sending kids off to boarding schools is far from uncommon.

BTW, I\'d say that a good analog for this sort of thing is what went on
in Alaska when they were building the big oil pipeline and drilling the
wells on the North Slope.

People with families didn\'t go. Instead you had young men getting high
pay, and *not* taking vacations. They\'d get time off (mandatory as I
recall), but they pretty much stuck to the theaters and whorehouses. 

And when they *were* working, they worked long hours.

Not much oxygen! And the *ores* from which you extract most metals are
*oxides* of the metal. Metal production will result in a net *increase*

You forget that the blast effects are mostly due to absorption of
x-rays from the nuclear reaction. The rock absorbs these and converts
into high temp plasma.

In any case, they have excavvated large underground chambers using
nukes. I don\'t have the references handy. The walls are stable because
it *doesn\'t* create the cracks you are thinking. Or rather, such cracks
as *are* generated, result in the rock being seperated from the wall
*by* the gases.

These cavities are long term stable, at least in the 5-10 year range
(as that had been how long the cavities had existed at the time my
references were written). 

And in any case, you *would* want to line the resulting cavity with
*something* (concrete, fused rock, whatever) to ensure that it was
sealed properly and stabilized in case of undetected fissures in the
rock.

First, check out the cost of excavating a similar sized cavity (say 500
meters diameter and a couple of km high) used normal excavation
methods. Nukes *are* cheaper.

Second, the radioactivity is trapped in the melt pool at the bottom of
the cavity, which is buried under tens of meters of rock. 

Third, you can create new cavities quite close to older ones. They did
tests on this. Heck, you can detonate then such that the cavities
overlap. Though that\'s rather tricky.

The US tests were in Nevada, and seemed to be ok, but public fears of
anything "nuclear" ended any possibility of civilian uses for a long
time. But the military still has it in reserve if they ever need large
underground storage tanks for oil or water.

Check out places in the real world that started out as way stations.
Centuries later many of them have huge populations. 

Mining tends to have the actual mine sites depopulate, but the nearby
"support" areas sometimes prosper on their own. 

Research stations haven\'t been around long enough to see how much they
can grow over a few centuries.

See my other post. You get radiation *while* it is operating. Turn it
off and there is no *residual* radiation.

        The first quote is from pp111 of "The Traveller Book" under the
description for GCarriers.  The description (I can post the rest if you
like) does not describe them a "combat gunships".  The second quote is pp111
as well, describing Ari/Rafts.

        Canon.

        Further, pp30 of "Rule Book 3 - Equipement" (Striker Rules) clearly
indicates they have a top speed of 300kph, and the contra-grav system is
capable of maximum 1.25Gs, and defaults as unarmed.
        You might be thinking of the TL15 Imperial Marine Grav APC on pp29
(Ibid), which has performance maximums of 600kph/1.5Gs and is heavily armed.

        MTU is a TL 11 maximum game, with TL 9 being Terran Sphere average,
so the IMG APC is *very* not an option.  Hence the requirement to haul the
G-Carriers down by assault shuttle.

FFS2 takes it into account, but only for low tech IMO (and TU).  
Requires
variously stored foods (refrigerated, low berthed <g>, etc) unless one 
wants
algae vat food or to store livestock and have gardens, etc etc.  This 
should
be limited to Traveller tech level 9 (maybe 10) and down IMO.

A higher tech idea is in GURPS: Biotech, that of "Fauxflesh Vats."  It\'s 
the
(GURPS) TL9 meat version of hydroponics.  A "biomass" of geneered lean 
meat
tissue is sustained by the ships life support and is continuously 
growing.
It\'s harvested as needed or when it gets too big for its vat(s).   For 
MTU, a
certain number of vats are included with the life support costs of the 
ship.
I haven\'t decided on it, exactly, but i following the simple guideline 
of
Biotech...  small ships have a limited number (possibly only one, which
greatly limits variety ("Beef again?")).  Being a gearhead, i\'ll 
probably get
around to codifying it sometime, if someone doens\'t beat me to it, but 
it\'s
not high on my queue right now. ; )  Of course, given a catastrophic 
incident,
its possible the biomass could die or otherwise need replacement.  
Malfunction
in the life support system could just fall on this rather than something 
that
could immediately kill the crew (temp/air/etc).

Another idea is cloning food.  W/ a forced-growth tank, it can be done 
pretty
quickly.
For really high tech, samples aren\'t even needed to begin cloning.  MT 
Ref\'s
Companion says individual organs can be cloned at TL13.

It didn\'t always "go nowhere".  I\'ve seen at least three versions of the
Spinward Marches X-boat net, and the original CT/MT grid had a link that
ran Strouden-Persephone-Marastan-Ffudn.  (But all of them have a jump-5
Tenalphi-Strouden link.  I think Tenalphi-Persephone-Strouden would make
sense.)

The original version is the one in CT\'s "Spinward Marches Campaign" and
the indside cover of one of the MT rulebooks.  Take this as the base 
network.

Changes in GT:Behind the Claw --

  Reston-Capon added (probably a typo that it was missing on the old map)
  Strouden-Persephone-Marastan deleted
  Risek-Dhian-Inthe deleted

Changes in MT:MegaTraveller Journal #1 --

  Reston-Capon added
  Ffudn-Weiss-Grote added (unfinished bypass due to Marastan red zoning?)
  Persephone-Marastan-Ffudn deleted (Marastan red zoned)
  Junidy-Towers-Nasemin deleted (marked as Vargr territory)

The Spinward Marches network is a bit weird.  The Solomani Rim network
looks a lot more rational.

I assumed that the ship is closed-cycle for water. As for food, an idea
has dawned - stow it in the low berths ;>

Well, I\'d argue that even fuel tanks (and more importantly, fuel
transfer systems) need maintenance. Instead of taking the family car as
an example, consider an air-independant propulsion diesel submarine.
The complexity inherent in the fuel systems can be outragous.

(I\'m assuming that a sensible starship wouldn\'t have the `one big fuel
tank\' that could all get lost in one accident).

Hmm. I don\'t buy it. If all this gear is maint. free, what do the
engineering crews do all day?

Battle damage is very different to component failure. A (c20) system
that fails will usually have one LRU that has failed `randomly\', and
using the built-in test it can rapidly be located and replaced. The same
system that has taken damage may either have:

(a) Taken physical impact/fire damage that has affected several LRUs -
possibly so severe that the built-in test doesn\'t work.

(b) Be irradiated, so that *none* of the semiconductor parts work

(c) Have suffered shock damage, so the LRUs need reseating.

(etc)

Mechanical & chemical engineering systems are, if anything, worse -
since implementing the built-in test is so much harder.

The question then becomes `which components count spares, and which
don\'t?\' I\'d quite like a good number of spares for my active sensor
array for my starship; I would probably not bother with sapres for a
radio on a three-hour endurance aircraft with no engineering crew.

Depends on how much combat endurance you want to give the ship. Your
average trader with a missile turret is probably happy with `one up the
spout, three on the ready rack\'. You missile destroyer will want *a lot*
of missiles it you\'re planning to besiege a planet with it.

Not much oxygen! And the *ores* from which you extract most metals are
*oxides* of the metal. Metal production will result in a net *increase*
in available oxygen.

heck if all you want is oxy, you can get that from rock. hydrogen and
nitrogen are the problems.




The US tests were in Nevada, and seemed to be ok, but public fears of
anything "nuclear" ended any possibility of civilian uses for a long
time. But the military still has it in reserve if they ever need large
underground storage tanks for oil or water.

Check out places in the real world that started out as way stations.
Centuries later many of them have huge populations.
Mining tends to have the actual mine sites depopulate, but the nearby
"support" areas sometimes prosper on their own.
********************8
The above comment about Nevada sparked this memory:
I used to live in Las Vegas, Nevada

It started off as a Mormon Conony, as a way station on the route to San
Bernadino.
A lead min was opened by them first colonists but soon closed due to
imputities in the metal.

<think of it as a refuling base orbiting a gas giant>

someboady new arrived at the colony from (IIRC) England.  I realised that
the impurities in the metal were in fact silver.

<The way station now supports an active mine>

during the depression several chemical companies relocated to the valley

<chemical exports now>

during WWII the Air force built a pilot training base (Nellis AFB)

<the way station now gets a navy base>

after the war new casinos (the old ones were still there from the mining
days) were opened.

<think of Bugsy Segal as a rep of a shady megacorp. an anything goes resort
planet>

Howard Huges also moved in.

<mega corp. Research Station. in new propulsion tech>

in the early 80s many entertainment and tech companies moved to Las Vegas
allong with Comdex and CES every year.

<now exports entertainment software, movies, and has a very good
engineering school. (Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering)>

in the late 80s on of the two rocket fuel plants for the shuttle (both
located in henderson just south of LV.) blew up

<Zohdanis sabotage factory making jump drives for the imperal navy!!>

some population figures:
1850: less than 100 (droping to less than 10 for a while)
1890: a couple of thousand (not including miners)
1960: about 100,000
1980: about 800,000
now: just under 1,600,000 in the valley (over 900,000 in Las Vegas itself)
over 150,000 of these are Mormon.

<to meet theses ame rates of growth, a pop A world (in 1115 the GT era) of
say 1,500,000,000
would have been pop 9 twenty years ago (in 1095 the CT era)
pop 8 40 years ago (in 1075)
pop 6 a hundred years ago
pop 5 as the inital colony (in 965) dropping to pop 4 after about 10 years
later


I am sure that there are more examples out there....inhospitable, but still
fast growing...

Fairbanks AK is about 200,000 if you include the army and airforce bases

 So can I. (In fact I just used a vac world in my game that used to be
pop9, now down to pop8 due to war damage.) My greatest problem with this
whole issue is that there are just too damn many of these on the maps to
conveniently explain away. (Duh... guess I should have said this to begin

  Yes, indeed. I never assumed all the workers would be miners, but at
least in a first stage colony everyone would need to be basically familiar
with vacuum/zero-G operations. This certainly would hitch up the paycheck
of even a lowly cook (heh, another money-hole). The point here is, that in
a society where vast majority of populance never leave their homewrlds,
not evreryone will have these skills, and many people won\'t even wish to
learn them, even if they are married to a vac-op:s specialist. (Space can
be a scary place.)

  Just so. I\'m just trying to figure out if it would\'t be cheaper to ship
in bulk freighter loads of off-world term workers, than try to build an
entire infrastructure for basic education and higher learning from
scratch.

  Duh? Traveller CPAW:s use protons or light nuclei. The last time I
checked the spallation caused by suprrelativistic protons colliding with
heavy nuclei _does_ indeed produce radioactive elements.

Based on occam\'s razor.  Pending any evidence it _doesn\'t_ decay in a normal
fashion, assume it does.  In any case, most neutron-activated radioactive
materials have fairly short halflives, so by the time you\'ve cooked off the
heavy radioactive elements you\'ve probably caused any secondary radioactivity
from neutron emission to be erased too.

Well, its unclear what the per-particle energy for traveller weapons-grade PAWs
actually is, so its possible (in fact, given that meson guns can be
constructed, relatively likely) that spinal particle beams can generate some
secondary radioactivity.  However, a CPAW designed for use in an atmosphere
needs relatively high beam current and thus a fairly low per-particle energy
(probably under 5 MeV -- which isn\'t \'super-relativistic\', its < 10% of c, low
enough that relativistic effects can mostly be ignored).  Such particles
_don\'t_ create radioactive elements.

They lock up useful nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen, for starters.  

They could also act as non-functional substitutes for compounds present in
Terran biologies, kind of like the way carbon monoxide "mimics" oxygen in
the blood stream.  There are also RW cases of compounds that simulate the
effects of hormones like oestrogen.

Another problem is that you have to not merely sterilize the soil, but the
air and water as well.  Otherwise the soil will very quickly become
contaminated again.

The key aspect of dealing with alien life is that "life" is primarily
unicellular, or worse.  At least, that\'s the case on Earth.  We live in the
"Age of Bacteria", just as much as the dinosaurs did.

Life is persistent.  Displacing a planetary microbiology is a much harder
business than shooting tigers.  I suspect, in most cases, what occurs is a
kind of "draw", where terrestrial and alien biologies coexist.  Of course
this coexistence will be unstable...

In other words, the bugs you have to worry about are the ones you can\'t
see.

It\'s a shame they\'re less fun than the big ones.

  Now this brings up another question.

How fast is a Particle beam? We all run around asuming C, but is that realistic?

They should get unbound by \'conventional\' microorganisms, though, right?  I 
thought I remembered reading someplace that at the lowest levels of the food 
chain, levo and dextro sugars & proteins are interchangable.  Any 
microbiologists around to set the record straight?

If this *is* the case, you merely have to introduce the proper lower level 
microbes and fungi to disassemble the wrong handed sugars and proteins and put 
them back into the environment as components.  If terrestrial organisms can 
then get a jumpstart under those conditions, they should outcompete the local 
critters.

From a GeoCities news e-mail I received earlier today (about the
watermark):

The new Watermark also features an animated image that fades from 
the word "GeoCities" to our new, smaller "g" logo.

This change isn\'t in place yet, but I\'ll keep you posted.  (BTW, since I
have the ad banner at the top of my page, I don\'t cause those annoying
"pop-up windows.")

ObTrav:  Are there shipyards that offer discounts or other incentives
for purchasers who set aside part of their chameleon surface for some
sort of ad for the shipyard?  (Not as far-fetched as it sounds.  The
dealer from whom I recently purchased a used truck will give me periodic
free oil changes, as long as I keep the dealership\'s ad plate on the
front of my truck, and the ad sticker on the rear.)

  This is one possibility I also considered. Can be used to explain a
couple of dozen worlds. What about the rest? There are at least hundreds
of ignored planets that canonically shopuld be prime colony material.

  Excuse me? I\'m starting to wonder if we\'re even talking about the same

  Again I wonder if we\'re talking about the same universe. My
understanding was that the majority of imperial citizens never leave the
surface of their homeworld. Only the ones that do would be likely to
possess required levels of vacuum-op skills, and only a fraction of these
would be qualified to work on building/expanding/maintaining a first stage
mining colony.
  A further question: Is it your opinion that people never/rarely marry
outside their professional circle and social class. (Now I\'m starting to
wonder if we even _live_ in the same universe.)

  This is the picture I was proposing too. One thing these people won\'t be
doing with a lifestyle like this is starting families and reproducing.
(With people having permiscuous relationships left and right, a company
policy of mandatory contraceptives would be pretty much a given.)

Shrug.  A realistic particle beam weapon system with current technology or
slightly above probably wouldn\'t be more than a few million volts, and maybe
10% of c.  Given that relativistic meson accelerators can be constructed, it is
reasonable to assume that relativistic PAWs can be constructed as well (120
million volts for 0.5 c; 1.2 billion volts for 0.9c), though in this case its
somewhat unclear why armor is relevant against PAWs, collision byproducts
(including uncharged mesons and pions) should be able to go through quite a bit
of armor without too much difficulty.

There have been 3 versions of Traveller that have been published since TD#21
(assuming, of course, that TD stands for The Dragon), all of which reinforce
the fatality rate for low berth travel.  I tend to view that as more
definitive.

  No doubt of that in any case. So add the cost of lining 4500 km^3 of
caves with support structures to the bill. Now we\'re _really_ starting to
get the figures up.

 Is that .5km diam. couple of km high(=2.5 km?) for the entire 5 billion?  
(0.39m^3/person, my friend is just about that volume crouched up, and
she\'s small) I don\'t think so. (Moving around would be a bit difficult,
let alone breathing since there\'s no room for life support.) 
  Anyway, nukes certainly are cheaper,but that doesn\'t mean they\'re cheap.

 Blasting nukes with people in the next cavern? Now this is one reference

  Yeah, and many others are stone dead. Besides, the terrestrial examples

  Wouldnt the "nearby support area" in this case possibly be the garden

  With a dozen or so middlemen the risk of discovery drops rapidly. And
deniability also works _inside_ the corporation. If the instigator of the
whole sordid affair is a subsector manager (maybe after a friendly 
unrecorded chat with the CEO) it\'s easy to throw him to the wolves if the
whole thing blows up in your face.

  Indeed, but the spallation shower would not be focused anymore. The
radiation can still do major harm, but this aspect _is_ adressed in
Brilliant Lances/MT/HG. At least GURPS space covers effects of PAW induced
radiation on ship personell.

  It stands for _Traveller\'s Digest_. I thought those were pretty much

I always envisaged them as being like the vertical launch boxes seen on the
Seawolf magazine on the UK\'s Type 23(?) Duke of....... class frigates. I
think some of the old Soviet Navy had a similar arrangement. Sort of a bank
of missiles with loading gear and a magazine below.

I think he means Traveller\'s Digest, a magazine that\'s *sorely* missed...

Yah, but if your goal is to kill off the crew with radiation sickness you don\'t
really _want_ focus, since it takes 4-5 orders of magnitude more energy to
destroy the frame than to cook the crew.

I own neither MT nor TNE, but T4, page 115, indicates that the survival
roll for a low berth passenger is 9- (DMs:  +1 for Medic 2+ attending,
- -1 for End 6-).  These percentages match those from CT Book 2 (page 2). 
Assuming that any ship transporting low passengers has a Medic 2+, this
works out to 3/36 [1/12] chance of death, before modification for low
passenger Endurance.  10% fatality sounds about right (this is, BTW, one
reason why I don\'t design civilian ships with regular low berths).

OTOH, FF&S2 seems to indicate that TL 11+ low berths are generally safe
(page 78).

YMMV.

ahem...

That still leaves *two* versions...  ;)

I don\'t know exactly where it would be stated in MT or TNE, I don\'t carry my
*entire* library with me (although, once the CD comes out...), but in T4
it\'s on page 115 (book A) under the section titles \'Low Passage\'.

"Roll 9- for each passenger when hi is revived..." and "...+1 DM for
attending medic of expertise 2 or better..."  which means that with a
medic-2 or better, the passenger survives on a 10 or less.  11 or 12, well
you check the low lottery to see who wins.  The last time I checked a stat
chart, 11 or 12 on 2 dice was 3 chances in 36 or roughly 12%.

Now, while I don\'t have my TNE or MT books with me, I\'d be willing to bet
dollars to donuts that there is equivalent passages in both of those
editions.

If you\'ll look at the map again, you\'ll notice there are many inhospitable
worlds with negligible populations - only a few thousand (or hundred,
or even dozen) people on them. These may be worlds that never got
started, or may be worlds that "died quietly".

This is a thread we\'ve seen before on TML - a problem with the
subsector random generation system.

The original Traveller random star system generation system didn\'t
link population to living conditions. Your chances of having a population
in the billions had nothing to do with how quickly your vac suit
would dissolve in the local atmosphere.

The best alternative generation system I\'ve seen yet is Jim Vassilakos\'
_Galactic_, but even Jim\'s "homebrew" method tends to make vanilla
subsectors - every nice planet is populated to the gills, every planet
even moderately difficult to live on is deserted. Something more in
the middle, between the two extremes would suit me better - perhaps
just like Jim\'s, but with a bit of a tweak to the modifiers he uses for
whether people will live somewhere or not.

The Traveller Imperium is a culture that can put 100,000 people on
a starship - I\'m sure they could put a couple hundred million on
a planet, no matter how nasty it was. Why would they? That (with
some referee imagination) is where the universe details (and plot
hooks) come from.

   CJ Cherrhy\'s "Cyteen" includes some valuable ideas on
terraforming. Wiping out local ecosystems is not a short term project if
the biosphere is fullof contaminants (planets are BIG places, on a human
scale) and your colonists could easily be living inside domes for a few
thousand years to come. 
   It\'s not something you want to do casually, either, because you never
know when some rare alien life form has very *valuable* properties, or
what\'s going to happen to it when you import terrestrial organisms. Just
watch the unintended consequences of playing with terrestrial ecosystems.
   Anybody tired of roaming the galaxy? Sit down on some planet for awhile
and help out with the local ecological survey. (Imperial scouts are only
around for a year or so at best...how well are they going to learn the
ecology in that time?) Get to know all the local beasties, up close and
personal. Find out which ones prefer to eat what and then see what happens
when you include people (your party, for instance) in the mix.

   This connects to a point I was about to bring up anyway,
connected with normal small starship operation. I agree entirely
about the "housekeeping" type of maintenance. I\'d see moderate to
major repairs as going in the annual maintenance, but minor
repairs and routine maintenance (Equivalent to changing light
bulbs, scrubbing the toilet, checking the oil) should be done all
the time. A certain amount of parts and supplies should be kept
on board for the purpose, though space for these would be
included in the appropriate area (engineering supplies and
equipment)
   This is not discussed as one of the routine starship costs,
but IMO it ought to be.  I also dislike the way that the basic
rules allocate life support costs only to occupied living
quarters or low berths. It\'s also been mentioned by some that the
"life support" costs for starships seem too high.
   It seems to me that some 50% of what is allocated to occupied
staterooms as "life support cost" should instead be "housekeeping
and routine maintenance" and spread out over the entire ship.
This corresponds to a human body\'s "basal metabolism" or having
the life support on "idle" for most areas of the ship. The
remainer is allocated to "active" life support and is affected by
the activities of live bodies. Even the lion\'s share of the life
support costs would consist of costs associated with routine
maintenance, such as repairing of seals or leaks, replacement of
leakage, filter and scrubber replacement or recharge, cleaning,
and so forth.

>I\'m also thinking food. Is this accounted for somewhere, or are
>we assuming hokey ST replicators?

FF&S2 discusses levels of life support. Those appropriate to
starships include:
   Standard: Light, thermal control, closed loop water and semi-
closed air. (2 week duration) Food is separate, Solid wastes not
recycled. (U.S. Space shuttle is roughly this type)
   Extended. Light, thermal control, closed loop water and air;
Food is a carried consumable; "solid" wastes are dried and
compressed. (US Submarines & Space station are roughly this type)
   Endurance. Closed loop water, air, and food. Appropriate for
space stations and generation ships or the equivalent.

   For the sake of simplicity I would think you could consider
the cost of rations along with life support costs and storage
space along with either living quarters or life support.
   Alternatively, you could also consider it separately and
calculate required weight, volume, and cost if you want to pay
more attention to logistics.

I made an assumption (the first two sentences in the paragraph you

        Fast enough that the beam can cross 50,000km in 1000sec...  So, at
least 50km per sec...  Now that is a *silly* minimum calculation, but it is
the absolute minimum.

    'body' => 'Dear Folks -

A while ago, Joseph Kimball asked why I gave his site a three-star rating.
Since I have never really explained to _anyone_ how I come up with the
ratings, I thought I might try to change that...

I do not have a written-down grading system. This means that all "ratings"
reflect my personal bias and should only ever be taken with a few large
grains of salt. I just try to get a handle on the "look-and-feel" of a
site, its volume (sheer amount of material) and scope (coverage of multiple
incarnations of Traveller).

Here are some of my reasonings:

- - some things I ignore, such as links pages - everyone has those - or
sections which are named but are empty (eg. logistics at Leonidae).

- - I am a sucker for deckplan and artwork sites. I was always the map-maker
in our AD&D games. ;-)

- - the 1-star and 2-stars may only have one thing on them. Links-only
probably get just one star (see previous point), but I include them because
they are still Traveller - no point in being picky about what "is" and
"isn\'t". Some sites, like Jagwire, I have to re-review. Loren\'s page is
really part of the SJG site but deserves its own direct reference. Bill
Keith is there in deference to being a Great Old One. ;-)

- - 3-star sites are "average", but remember that\'s only in relation to ALL
the sites out there. The SJG and BITS sites, for example, are important
sites but don\'t really have any *gaming* material, they just tell you to
buy _their_ gaming material. ;-)

- - 4-star sites have something special that puts them above average, such as
extensive Library Data, Javascript apps, etc. Examples include the THUDD
site (sure, it only covers ships - but _what_ ships!!), Doug\'s Sylea
Downport (this gets it for the Silly Era alone!), Bryan\'s AAB site (for the
complete Trav publication index list), James Junction ("Counter-Genocide"),
Bruce Johnson\'s Traveller (the Dean Files), Mark Seeman\'s Traveller
(Library Data), and so on. Usually, it is just volume or scope that holds
me back from rating them as 5-star.

- - some 5-stars are really 4-star in coverage or volume but stunning artwork
or deckplans or site design or absolute must-have software push them into
the 5-star bracket. Examples include the Draconis Cluster, Virtual Space,
Halfway Station, Galactic, and Freelance Traveller sites (although FT is
closing on being 5-star due to volume alone!).

- - the absolute best 5-stars, and the ones I rate everything else against,
cover everything about Traveller in all its incarnations. Examples include
Goran Damberg\'s and Joe Heck\'s sites. Hmmm, maybe I should re-rate
everything in jump drives terms, J1 to J6!

- - I am a sucker for deckplan and artwork sites. Or did I already say that??
:-)  And I\'m jealous of Library Data sites that are bigger or better than
mine. ;-)

In the final analysis, it comes down to the "feel" I get about a site\'s
volume, content, and "look" when I am browsing it.

BTW, I *hate* pop-up window adverts. However, this by itself will not cause
me to lower a site\'s rating, unless they occur
on-every-page-in-the-damned-site! - time to lower the volume of ads for a
while, maybe go and watch commercial TV...  ;-)

I was *shocked* to see I came in as 4 stars!!!!!!!!!

At most, I thought I\'d only pull in mebbe 2, *possibly* 3.

And my site isn\'t even *done* yet...

My head is spinning.  Thanxx for the rating, David.
