Not to take away the fun of the Starship Design Debate, but anybody had any
wishes of what the first adventures to be published will be like?

Personally, I\'d like to see a few "mysteries of the deep" adventures like
Twilight\'s Peak and Secre of the Ancients (Classic Traveller). Not
necessarily involving the Ancients, but sector-spanning adventures that take
you to several locales, while searching for clues to a greater mystery (since
we are coming out of the Long Night, maybe locating old technology, mapping
old colonies/bases, etc. could be the "push" here). Plenty of room for lots
of red herrings here!

Love them red herrings!

Another adventure I\'d like to see would be of a more limited scope. A
commercial-oriented adventure, where Traders are involved in setting up a
merchant company. This adventure would be (I think) suited for solitaire as
well as group play. Give lots of details on finance, stock markets and the
like--how the arrival of a rival ahead of you ruins the worth of your cargo.
It\'s a bare bones idea right now, but there might be something here (or I\'ve
been working in the finance industry--yech--too long!).

Finally, I\'d like to see Trillion Credit Squadron. Well, since it\'s an
earlier time, maybe we can call it Billion Credit Squadron. TCS accomplished
a lot of stuff that Battle Rider and others did--but with a lot less chrome.
I still have fond memories of designing ships with HG, outfitting a fleet,
and battling it out by plotting on graph paper with pencils and **big**
erasers! The campaign outlined in TCS would work, with some alterations. Just
have the lost colony get moved closer to where the Imperium is emerging from
the Long Night, change some tech levels, and there you go!

Thanks for listening.

This is all that needs to be said.  Actually, I thought they did a 
better job of it with TNE than MT.  MT was a total disaster.  The 1st 
edition as it was printed, should have never even been submitted to 
the publisher, let alone be printed and released.  They wised up on 
that with TNE, which at least didn\'t have gaping holes in character 
generation and craft design a la MT.

I think that TNE did weigh down the book a bit with their publishing 
style.  The sidebar stuff, and the computer readout had a tendency to 
clutter things, making it a bit harder to read, and undoubtedly 
accounting for at least part of those pages.  Overall, it was well 
written.  I just didn\'t like GDW\'s house rules system all that much...

I gotta agree.  I think FTL communications would probably create a 
much more homogenous culture.  The fact that a charismatic 
dictatorship can be a bare parsec away from a thriving democracy is 1 
of the hooks that captured me.

I wouldn\'t want it to be Star Trek.  If you really think about the 
series, culture within the Federation itself isn\'t really all that 
interesting.  Think about how few Star Trek episodes actually focus 
on events within the Federation...  Most of the stuff is definitely 
frontier.

Nice compromise.  I think that the TL12 minimum gives the early

Thrusters debate...  Good work, Dave!!!!

The point is that there are alot of science fiction choices about how 
a civilization can exist across interstellar space. 

Why have the choices been made for Traveller such that the Traveller empire
is analogous to one of the pre 18th century empires, rather than a far
future one ?

That is precisely the problem with the previously "official" version
of thruster plates--they gave you free kinetic energy. "Realistic"
reaction drives don\'t solve the problem, since you still have ships
travelling at very high speeds and now every ship has a very powerful
fusion gun in back.

The problem is that you want ships to be capable of high acceleration
and speeds. This is the only way to make maneuver drives a feasible
alternative for in-system travel, among other things.

The solution is to state that these very fast-moving ships really
don\'t have the tremendous amounts of kinetic energy that they should
have. Suppose a maneuver drive also included a field generator that
affected the "apparent mass" of the ship. With the generator on, you
can accelerate quickly and to very high speeds. Turn the generator
off, and the ship drops down to a much lower speed (thrusters only?).

I realize there are some issues to be resolved if you want a more
thorough explanation, but they are not insurmountable. The biggest
issue probably is how the theory of relativity plays in. Possible
answers:
 o it doesn\'t (it\'s a "magic" type of field anyway)--the effects of
   relativity are as if the field were off
 o this results in extra energy being expended/lost (a cost to run
   the M-drive, especially at high speeds/accelerations)
 o this limits your maximum attainable speed (say, to below 0.1c)
   and puts stress on the ship/drives

Because that is not the way the Traveller universe works. With jumps
taking a week at a time and no faster method of communication, the
universe is more diverse and generally a more exciting place to be.
You could invent such things, but they would change the nature of the
campaign.

Yes, and given that there is *no* FTL travel in real life (yet?), a choice
had to be made.

Ever hear the phrase "history repeats itself"?  Who is any of us to say
how a "far future" setting *should* be.  The design choices made in
Traveller leave open many many adventure options.  Slow communication
speeds means that characters who are (falsely I am sure!) accused of some
crime can keep one step ahead of the law.  Slow travel times makes
outthinkng your opponent all the more important in large naval campaigs.

Like I said, a choice had to be made, and the choices that went into
Traveller have alot to do with the amazing diversity of game play that can
be had from it.

The text summarises some well known facts and it sounds good.

>TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCE PROVIDES A FOUNDATION

We also see the reappearance of reactionless maneuver drives, fine. Will
Gravitiy manipulation also be used to build something like force screens?
The other missing answer is on the role of computer technology. What is its
technological and sociological importance? Will computers stay as slow, big,
monolithic calculation engines of the seventies or will they reappear as
more up to date multi-purpose tools? What\'s about robots or AIs?

>SOCIAL SCIENCE ADDS CHARACTER AND FLAVOR

The position of robots in society has also important effects on sociology. I
hope the beginning Imperium is more pro-robot (as for example the society
shown by the star wars movies where (the non-intelligent) robots where just
another tool very common for all people and in contrast to the post-virus
TNE society that feared everything more complicated than a pocket watch). On
the cosmopolitan universe: My view of the Imperium was always tolerance,
tolerance up to indifference about all kind of governments. Keep it so! But
don\'t see capitalism as the only working form of society. They Imperium
might follow this ideology (because it works so well :-) but there should
always be exceptions.

>ADVENTURE!
>[...] combat, travel, tasks. 

I strongly hope, Traveller isn\'t a combat centric game. IMHO MT and TNE lost
much because their orientation toward military missions. Something like

...travel, exploration, combat, negoation and all kinds of task.

as adventure concept I would like much better!

>HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE

>[...] Ziru Sirka, with 40,000 worlds.

Huh, the number I remebered (and was used in TNE) was about 11.000 worlds.
Has the empire grown or do they now count different? TNE shown sligthly
different dates (4518 instead of 4521 for example) but that seems
unimportant. Interestingly, this text didn\'t mention the virus, perhaps... :-)

>THERE\'S MORE!

I like this summary of Traveller, mainly because I always liked the overall
setting and had most problems only with rules and given technology (mainly
the design systems) and the main emphasis of (MT and) TNE to military
adventures (starting with rules like TNE that ease combat up to the whole
concept of the RC which was \'if another world is too weak to protect their
wealth one could go and take it)\'.

One point, that came to my mind is the world design. Will it be the same
system as used since the beginning (for the snake of backward
compartibility) or something better. Rolling up some worlds is fun (and more
than inventing vehicles IMHO) but the current system gives some very strange
results because population is independ of all other values. It\'s also
strange that each system always has exactly one mainworld.

So thrustes don\'t change the momentum of the ship.  When you turn off
the drive, you stop moving?

I\'m sad to see the Virus still included (yuck) but given that that era
will only be one of many I can live with it.  More info on the Zhodani
Core Expiditions and similar exotic times sounds great.  "The Heat Death
of the Universe."??? Well, that\'s certainly not my first choice for a RPG
setting, but I must admit to being curious. 

Good Job!

My main point is that a solution is needed for consistency in the
universe, a place in which many people have starships but planets
are not regularly being destroyed, orbiting space stations are
common, etc.

However, the concept I had in mind was more along the lines of this:

The "zeta field" (or whatever) allows you to achieve higher speeds by
changing your "apparent mass". A maneuver drive also has thrusters,
which would change your momentum (and kinetic energy) whether or not
the field is active. However, your "speed" would be higher if the
field is on. Fusion rockets could still exist, but would be at quite
a disadvantage and likely considered a threat to shipping lanes,
planets, etc. Note that the "zeta field" does not need be compatible
with fusion rockets, so you don\'t automatically get a supership by
strapping one onto an old fusion "torch-ship".

This explanation should be good enough for most people, I think.
There are certainly some issues with relativity (which also affects
"apparent mass") as well as whether (and how) to preserve momentum,
kinetic energy, or both when you turn the field on/off, but these
are not insurmountable problems.

you missed my point.  I said the reason CT was such a big hit (in it\'s time)
was because there was a clear line between the rules and the background.
Even the Traveller Book (IMHO the best release of the rules to date)
background matterial was only listed in the back, as an exmple.  If you
cared about the rebellion and the virus than fine, you buy another source
book detailing that.  And as for \'gouging money from your pockets\'  I\'ve got
news for you.  The purpose of a game company is to make money!  (Surprise!)
Not to inform you about some fantasy background.  I am only saying that
including this background in with the rule book is the reason the company
was unable to profit from the game.

My case in point!  And as for a hefty 300+ pages of technical gear, just how
many pictures of tanks do we realy need!

There were errors in TNE that were also in MT, even after the errata sheets
were released!  GDW thought they could make more money by selling pictures
of weapons than by putting out a meaningful, playible game system.

Those would be fun.  There\'s a _lot_ of adventure possible in (re)contacting old
colonies: I\'ve just been reading Stableford\'s *Daedalus* series (*The Florians*,
*Critical Threshold*, *Wildeblood\'s Empire*, *The City of the Sun*, *Balance
of Power* and, soon, *The Paradox of the Sets*) and all (so far) would make
excellent Traveller adventures of exploration, diplomacy, and discovery.

Or you could, for example, discover a set of old worked-out mines, dating from
after the Ziru Sirkaa.  Well, those resources aren\'t available _here_, then,
but they must have been taken elsewhere.  Who dug the mines?  Where did they
go?  Are they still technological and spacefaring, or have they fallen back
to barbarism?

Are there still Vilani holdouts with ancient legends about the arrogant invaders
from beyond the stars (Solomani from the Rule of Man)?  Would they welcome fresh
contact?

We never hear about whether the Sylean Federation just happened to be the only
other viable interstellar government expanding at the same time... could there
have been another state in conflict with them, now ousted out of the history
books after their eventual utter destruction?

Way back when Marc Miller was soliciting ideas for the new Traveller product
line, I mentioned that a series of Adventure books, on different themes for
adventures/campaigns (how-to, new rules and gear, plot hooks and a few actual
adventures) might be good for bringing in new players and expanding the horizons
of older ones.  I think I included Exploration Adventures (scouts and recontact),
Military Adventures (characters as still-active-duty), Commercial Adventures
(what you\'ve described above), perhaps others.  I\'ll have to dig out my notes....

As for the future of the published universe... is the vague "Survey" map for
Milieu 0 (in which information becomes sketchier further and further from Sylea)
going to remain the basis for the whole historical line?  Or are we going to
find more areas detailed as new Milieus arrive -- Reavers\' Deep for the Aslan
Border Wars, the Spinward Marches (obviously) for the Frontier Wars, Solomani
Rim for the Interstellar Wars, Vland for the Ziru Sirkaa, Ilelish for the
Suerrat Revolt, Antares for the Julian War, etc. etc. etc.?  If so, I fear
we\'ll encounter D&D-like trouble wherein individual referees feel cramped
when new products detail their already-developed campaign settings.

  However, I need the jargon to compile, and not just the stuff
  that I make up out of my own head, or that my former gaming group
  used when we played.  I need yours, too.  And yes, that includes
  you all the way in the back waving your hand at me.  Oh, you want
  to know what I mean by jargon?

  That\'s easy.  It\'s the "slang" that\'s not part of standard
  Galanglic as it appears in your particular incarnation of
  Traveller\'s reality (IOTR), and that your players\' characters are
  likely to encounter in the course of adventures.  Shipboard
  slang, ground slang, military slang, all of that is good and
  useful.

  Examples?  Sure - just a few off the top of my head:  In my IOTR,
  a good ship\'s cook is called a "gil", a "gilly", or occasionally
  a "shu-li", all deriving from the old Vilani "shugili", the guy
  who knew the techniques for making edible the inedible plant life
  on Vland.  A "cork" is a nuclear damper, when used to disrupt or
  terminate the output of a power plant that relies on nuclear
  reactions for power production (fission or fusion, hot or cold),
  and using "cork" as a verb is what a "cork" used as a noun does.
  The guy in your crew who always seems to have a knack for
  managing protocol is a "newt", because before it became
  politically correct to call \'em "Bwabs" or "Bwaps", that\'s what
  members of that race were called - and everyone knows that they
  handled protocol like nobody\'s business.  Stuff like that.

  What I\'d like for each entry is the word itself, the part of
  speech, the definition, and the origin, if known.  Set it up like
  it might be in a dictionary.  Don\'t worry about the same word
  having multiple, even contradictory, definitions, or two
  different words having the same definition - after all, "fat
  chance" and "slim chance" mean the same thing, don\'t they?

  Example:

  gil (n) [from Old Vilani "shugili", a food preparer/witch
  doctor/shaman]  (1) A cook, usually one who can create high
  quality meals out of poorer-quality materials

  If you don\'t want to waste space piecemeal here, post to me at
  jeff.zeitlin@execnet.com.  I\'ll whip it all into shape, and put
  it up in the RICE Archives, and post it here all together.

I sincerely hope that they detail very little, as I have fleshed out quite
a bit and even changed some of the maps.  Of course, it doesn\'t really
matter what they publish in the end, I\'ll end up using what I am my
players like and shelving the rest.  Much of what it sounds like MMT is
going to be like is already in my house rules, so it should be pretty
smooth.

generate an Advanced Character that is a Computer Programmer, like Myself,
then that is not really a problem.  However, much of the knowledge I have is
very specialized, and in most games rolled up into 1-3 skills, Computer, or
Computer Operations, Computer Programming, and Computer Build/Repair.

Now in a basic system, I could generate a basic character with a Computer 6
that would kick butt.  he could hack, repair, write, program, etc.  In an
advanced system, this same character might have 2-3 times as many skills.
Most of them would be, however, duplicates of the basic Computer Skill.  So
now I purchase a Programming Languages skill (to let me know if I can
decipher the code written by another programmer in a Language I don\'t know),
A Computer Operations skill (to simulate using software written by others),
a Computer Ettiqutte skill, a Networkig skill, a Communications skill, etc
ad nauseum.

In military terms the same things apply.  If I create a Merc charcater, just
how useful is his Heavy Weapons 4 skill when he is tailing someone?  Every
skill in traveller could be subskilled out to a great degree.  I mean think
of what you could use Streetwise for.  

I would love to see advanced char gen for other occupations.  I once
generated a rather detailed Fighter Pilot generation system for CT/MT.  It
was very Book 5 like with special assignments, etc.  It was chock full of
useful skills (for a fighter pilot) Heavy Figter Pilot, Medium Fighter
Pilot, Small Fighter Pilot, Fighter Tactics, Squadron Communiations,
Carousing, etc.  It was also quite leathal as I remember.  Survival rolls
were often above 7.  I test generated about 50 characters both enlisted and
officer and generated about 12 new types of fighters and fighter weapons. (A
ECM fighter for jamming, a Torpedo bomber complete with 5 ton missle,
atmospheric fighters, etc.)  It added a lot to our play, even though almost
every character generated with it didn\'t get a chance to fly a fighter in a
space battle.  

Were these characters BETTER then the others.  No, they were more detailed
about one aspect of their natures, but they were weak in other areas.  The
Fighter pilot just wasn\'t very good at finding cargo, or making deals with
Vargr, etc.  The saem could be said for Scientists, is it better to have
Science 5 , or Aquatic Biology 2, Volcanic Geology 1, etc.

default skills at level 0). This is not an especially lucrative endeavor, but
it does have some chance of success.

I think Traveller is the best choice because it has always been for Traveller
regardless of era or rules set.  CT and MT posts have always been welcome. 
The only rule was no TNE on Xboat.  I was waiting to see what the game was
going to look like before I tried to urge a direction (which I didn\'t want to
do).  Thanks for taking the time to keep us informed!!!

Agent...whoo hoo!  One of my favorite alternative character types (as 
evidenced by my home-grown advanced generation system for them :).  

The skills list looks excellent.  I just have one suggestion:  I found it 
convenient to create a new skill called Concealment for the Agent 
character, so that they could hide items about their body with some 
skill.  Sure, it\'s better to role-play that out, but such can be said of 
many (if not all) skills on the list.

Thank you for posting this information!

Whew!  What a document.  Add a bit at the bottom describing products to 
be produced, and you\'d have yourself a heck of a whiz-bang marketing 
tool, methinks.  Something along the lines of the old "Understanding 
Traveller" pamphlet, with this as its foundation.  Splash sheets and 
posters will get attention - a document like this will /keep it/.

I assume you aren\'t asking for proofreading (ie, for typographical 
errors, etc.)  Rather, I assume you have posted this draft version for 
our benefit and for comment on the subtance, not form.  Given that, I 
have nothing but praise for the work.

Once again, thank you for sharing with us!

        Given that Warp Drive, Jump Drive and FTL communications are all
technical balderdash anyway, no, there\'s no _technical_ reason possible.
However, there is a very logical reason: that\'s the way the game is written.

        As in any form of SF (game or book), you make certain assumptions or
decisions up front, as a basis for an internally self-consistent universe.
Why doesn\'t Babylon 5 use Warp Drives? Same reason. Why did Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle use Alderson tramlines in "Mote in God\'s Eye?" Same reason.

        Don\'t like it? Change it in your game.

You\'re right.  As in any scholarly study of a body of work, critical
thinking and cross-analysis are crucially important to understanding.

I would say primary sources, or recognized sources, or at least very good
places to begin learning.

Some 15 years ago, I developed advanced character generation for police,
lawyers, artists, and academics.  The only thing I remember about them were
that if your academic character were ever promoted to the administration, he
or she lost one level of instruction skill per year as an administrator.

I\'m with both of you.  All career paths presented should have advanced
character generation.  

The original Book 1/Book 4 basic character generation was kept simple to
allow new players (which was everyone in 1977) to jump in and play.  I
remember rolling up lots of characters at first, because it was so different
than, e.g., D&D (before the "A"), and felt so much more thorough.  Having
lived to the age at which many characters muster out, I see that I and
everyone I know have many more skills in real life than we would have had we
been on the basic character generation track in our lives.

You like what you like, but I like the year-by-year progression, and I use
it as the framework around which the character\'s biography is built.  When I
generate a character, I first go through the advanced character generation
process.  At the end, I know the character\'s age, so I can put him into
historical context.  Then I work forward.

I finished tabulating the results of the design poll.  Rather than clog 
the mailing list with a million lines of statistical analysis, I would prefer 
to send the information to you individually.  E-Mail me if you want the 
full blown report.  Here are a few general conclusions, to whet your 
appetite (or make you feel grateful I didn\'t post it to the list, depending 
on your point of view).

There were 62 total responses.  The most popular design system 
for starships was FF&S, although it was preferred overall by only 35% 
of total users.  Of those users familiar with the CT & MT systems as 
well as FF&S, that percentage rose to 52%, still only a slim majority 
of total players.  MT was a distant second with about 25%, with High 
Guard at about 20%.  Virtually nobody wants something as simplistic 
as book 2.

Of those players who were not familiar with all 4 systems, the 
majority owned MT & CT, but never bought FF&S.   GDW had a good idea 
in FF&S though, as several players who do not use the TNE background 
still use FF&S as a design system (and presumably TNE rules for 
vehicular/ship  combat.  

Vehicles: 
There was nothing approaching  a consensus on what system was preferred 
for craft design.  Several people who liked FF&S as a ship design 
system expressed a dislike for FF&S as a vehicle design system, and 
many of those expressed a preference for MT.

The breakdown between MT, Striker, & FF&S was as follows:

FF&S: approx. 30%
MT: approx 25%
Striker approx 20%
N/A approx 25%

There was no significant difference in percentage for those who were 
familiar with all 3 systems.  Ironically enough, about 1/4 of the people 
who responded to the poll said that they\'d never used any of the three 
systems to design a vehicle of any type.  Clearly, a Sears catalog of vehicle 
types would satisfy a lot of these people.  An FF&S lite may not be as 
necessary for vehicles as ships.

General Conclusions:
Just about everybody wanted some complexity to ship design.  Book 2 
was familiar to all but 7 of the 62 respondents, and yet only 3 of 
them expressed any desire to still use the system.  FF&S was a 
favorite of the more complex 3 (MT, HG & FF&S), but not by much 
of a margin.  When compared by those who\'d owned all 4 systems, 
FF&S was a majority favorite, but not overwhelmingly so.  A 2 tiered 
approach such as that espoused by Don & Dave would appear to be 
the way to go.  Clearly, there is a market for something as complex as 
FF&S, but it is equally clear that GDW made a mistake when they did 
not release a less complex ship/vehicle design system for those unwilling 
to tackle FF&S.

As far as vehicle design, results are less clear.  FF&S is still a 
favorite, but frankly, there were a number of advocates for MT & 
Striker as well.  FF&S would probably be the way to go, but it may 
need to be tweaked, refined or overhauled to satisfy a number of the 
complaints I heard about it.

My unsolicited and perhaps unneeded advice to IG:

Use a 2 tiered approach for ship design &.  There are a number of 
"gearheads" who love the detail and complexity of FF&S, but there is 
a nearly equal number who still want a certain level of detail, 
without getting into overwhelming complexity.  A Medium Complexity/High 
Complexity step is probably the way to go.

Finally, whatever system winds up going into the ship design rules, 
it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL, that these rules be carefully proofread 
and laid out in a logical fashion.  Judging by the responses given to 
the unworkable parts of MT & FF&S, as they were prior to the errata 
fixes, this really hurt GDW.  The number of comments like:  "I tried 
to design a ship using XXX 1st edition, got halfway through and gave 
up, because the rules were poorly written..." comments that I got 
were unbelievable.  It is my opinion that the poorly edited ship 
design and combat rules killed MT they consumed most of the errata 
(other than the Merchant Advanced Character Gen system)..., and they 
turned a few people off from FF&S as well.  In GDW\'s defense, they 
did do a good job of making these 2 systems workable with the error 
corrections, but they lost a lot of people by not releasing a 
finished product to begin with.

Believe it or not, that is a synopsis of the conclusions and data in 
the report.  For the full report, e-mail me at the address below.

I\'d appreciate it if you continued to post to xboat. I don\'t subscribe to

the xboat list!), but I for one would still like to stay updated.

My Cr 0.02 on your efforts

I hope there are plans at some point in the future to create other 
character classes as a supplement, in JTAS, or something...  I kind 
of miss the Pirate & Belter classes.  I suppose Scholar could replace 
Scientist (another of my faves).

>

I like the inclusion of more scientific disciplines.

> Archery*
> Armorer

Not sure I like giving characters the ability to build their own 
armor...sounds like a heap o\' trouble to me.  I\'ve run many an 
adventure where Merc type characters have been looking for a source 
to buy battle dress.  Now all they need to do is find the materials...

> Fast Talk*

What the heck is Fast Talk?  Is this the ability to be an auctioneer. 
 Or the ability to talk somebody into (or out of) something they 
really wouldn\'t do under most circumstances?

> First Aid* (very high levels become EMT)

Overall, I gotta agree with other peoples assessment on this 1.  I don\'t see a 
need for this, when most of the skills are duplicated by Medic-1 & 2. 

I suppose you could give this instead of Medic for military careers.  
A lot of folks would be taught First Aid in the army, not as many 
would actually go through Medical school.

> Performance (Art)
> Performance (Dance)
> Performance (Drama)
> Performance (Music)
> Performance (Writing)

Obvious choices for the Performer character.  I think the Performer 
type is tough to justify as a basic character class though.  I can\'t 
see too many people in Traveller playing this as a PC.  Hard to get 
excited about having rolled up a character with Performance (Dance)-4 
skill, when your neighbor is a Battle Dress-3, or Broker-2.  Would be a 
good type for a \'Citizens\' supplement though, and I can see some great 
ideas for NPC\'s & patrons.

Great idea in a pre-Psionic Suppressions Imperium

I like the inclusion of a larger number of Default skills.

Very nice ideas, Marc.  Thanks for posting them.

Doesn\'t people from university go for adventure? What\'s about Scientists,
Engineers or Doctors? Or should Scholar be a collective category for them?
But why didn\'t you then also summarize Army, Navy and Marine to (for
example) Soldier?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think the idea here is that military types are more likely to 
adventure, so they can be differentiated more.  Also, in terms of 
designing character generation systems, it\'s easier to group scholarly 
disciplines than military ones (in my experience, which is fairly extensive).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Consolidated Skill List (* indicates Default Skills [see below])

To justify my following critics I\'d like to say that if I\'ve made no
comment, I agree with that skill. The game should have about 50-60 skills,
but not more. Perhaps you should drop one or two skills to lower the number.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

To me, the number of skill is unimportant.  There can be hundreds for all 
I care.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Archery*

The use of archaic missle or throwing weapons a default skill? I don\'t think
so.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I agree with this comment.  Someone who\'s never been trained to use a bow 
should definately get the -5 DM for unskilled use when using one (or 
whatever MMT\'s replacement will be for this).  This is also true of 
several other skills listed as "default".  I would suggest looking this 
over again.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Armorer

Building armor on your own? I would drop this skill in favor of some more
important skil.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is an extremely important skill for primitive types, so I would not 
drop it.  However, I would subsume it into craftsman (see below).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Craftsman

What does a craftsman craft? A baker? a bricklayer? A goldsmith? I would
drop it.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I would not drop it, but make it a cascade skill with specializations 
allowed.  This again is important for primitives (usually NPCs, but they 
gotta have skills too).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Environment Combat*

I\'d count special training to the corresponding weapon skill and drop this.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think this should be a cascade skill too.  Including such things as ZG 
and Hi-G combat.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Equestrian*

Does this skill also include normal riding (for me, it\'s a somewhat unusual
term I had to look up)? Why not call it simple Riding?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Because "Riding" is not the correct term.  Anyone can ride on something 
being controlled by another.  Equestrian is the skill of controlling a horse.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Fencing

A special skill? Why not included in Blade weapon?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think you may be confused here (or I may be also :-), but I think this 
is referring to the skill of putting stolen goods out on the blackmarket 
(also called fencing).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Forward Observer

I never understand what\'s the roleplaying use of that skill. As a general
rule, I would try to distinguish between occupation (or role) skills and
activity skills (more general). To be a forward observer is an occupation
(IMHO) but to be that, you have to be trained in communication, stealth and
to keep cool.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

FO is the skill of calling in artillery fire or orbital artillery fire. 
You seem to think it is the skill of "scouting" or something, which has
been covered in CT/MT as Recon.  If you\'ve ever watched a movie about Viet
Nam, they\'re always calling in strikes from aircraft and artillery.  That
is what FO is for.  I agree with someone else\'s comment that this would be
a TL 5-9 skill, after which it would become rare (though it\'s always nice
to be able to go manual when your fancy electronic FO computer breaks
down). 


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Gunnery
>Heavy Weapons*
What\'s the difference between these two skills? Isn\'t a cannon a heavy 
weapon?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Gunnery is for space combat, and refers to use of turreted lasers and 
plasma weapons.  Heavy Weapons are things like squad support weapons 
(MG\'s, LAW rockets, etc.), and are generally portable or semi-portable.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Jack of All Trades

I would drop this skill because experience with old Traveller has show that
this \'Mac Guyver\'-like skill causes lot\'s of problems because it\'s too
advantagerous.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I love this skill!  Please don\'t drop it, but _do_ clearly delineate how 
it is to be used.  I\'ve always made it that a character with JOT can 
"expand" his skills into related areas.  e.g., you have mechanics-3 and 
jot-1, you can handle electronics-0.  If you have jot-2, I\'ll let you get 
away with engineering-0 and computers-0.  And so on.  In Shadowrun, they 
have a "skill web" and I\'ve always meant to make one for Trav.  It would 
formalize the system I outlined above.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Melee (Armed)*

That\'s the difference to blade weapon? (What I\'d like to say: think about
building more general skills where blade weapons are a special case)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I agree with this.  Isn\'t this brawling and/or blade?  Perhaps blade 
should be dropped and Melee be the replacement, including clubs and 
hammers and such things which are not "blades".


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Performance (Art)
>Performance (Dance)
>Performance (Drama)
>Performance (Music)
>Performance (Writing)

Nice, but very unimportant for roleplaying in the Traveller millieu, IMHO.
Drop.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Sorry, Stefan, but I completely disagree with you here.  They may not 
have been important in your games, but I\'ve had to invent them myself for 
my campaigns.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Philosophy*

Again. That\'s roleplaying but no player can stat \'my character has just
created a new meanful philosophic statement because I rolled successfully
against philosophy. GM, think about something like "I know that I know
nothing"\'
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is simply meant to imply that the character has knowledge about 
philosophy and can write and comprehend papers on the topic.  Try reading 
a high-level philosophy paper (or even a mid-level one) and tell me then 
that this isn\'t a skill.  You could just as easily say that any academic 
discipline should not be given a skill (e.g. history, political science, 
etc.).  All of these are areas of knowledge, and make useful skills.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Psionicology (an academic endeavor)

Oh, that\'s a real improvement. Good.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Yup, I like this too.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Research*

Can you research something independ from a scientific discipline? As far as
I know, no German university teach general research but you only learn
researching together with all other knowledge of the specific discipline.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

You can research something independent of a discipline.  Many Canadian 
univesities have degrees in "Information Sciences" that relate directly 
to this skill.  It is the ability to search and organize information 
meaningfully.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Surface Vehicle*

Including boats that swim on the water\'s surface? :-) (What\'s about Ground
vehicle?)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This should definately be a cascade skill.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Btw, will the basic rules book also cover alien races? Does they have
special skills which have to be considered?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I don\'t think it should cover alien races.  I would like to see (as much
as possible) the rules be relatively free from the background so that
people can use it for non-Imperium non-Standard sorts of campaigns. 
Alien skills will presumably be covered in Alien Archives.

But thats not the purpose of the list.  If we are going to cross post everything, then there should only be one list.  There is a large amount of mail right now, and you have to read the messages 2 or 3 times.  

Secondly, TNE discussions have dropped to a minimal level, with most all discussion being T4 related on Traveller.  So let the Traveller list be what its for, discussing the current version of Traveller, which in this case is T4.

If you are on Xboat, not on Traveller, simply mail a message to:

    traveller-request@mpgn.com   (or traveller-digest-request@mpgn.com)

and in the body say:

     subscribe traveller your@email  (or subscribe traveller-digest your@email)

If everyone on Xboat that is interested in T4 joins traveller, then Xboat will
be for CT/MT only discussions.  I will even create a TNE list if needed. 

I would like to see no more T4 cross posts, and urge the Xboat people to join Traveller.

NEW Consolidated Skill List

D indicates default skill, all characters have this at level-0 at the 
GM\'s option ("primitive" characters will not have some of these, but will 
have others that moderns won\'t have).

G indicates grouped skill, from which one "specialty" must be chosen, 
with all other members of the skill group being level-nil (level-0 at 
GM\'s option).

C indicates cascade skill, from which one "specialty" must be chosen, with 
all other members of skill group being at 1/2 level (level-0 if specialty 
is at level-1).

My girlfriend Carol Rhodes invented this word in about 1983:

cerastic (ser a\' stik) noun (from Terran English ca. -2400, ceramic +
plastic): Any fired synthetic material, typically used in furniture,
consoles, and dining ware aboard starships.  Cerastic is usually strong,
easy to clean and sterilize, and resistant to heat.  adjective:  being made

   Maybe not a default skill, but many people may have an Archery-0, not

Not a default, except on Low tech worlds.

Unsure about the Default level or not.  Most people know how to put a bandaid
on and clean simple wounds.  Does this warrent a Medic-0 or First Aid-0.  If this is not combined with Medic, then Medic-1 has to equal First Aid-4 or 
something like that.  A doctor is trained at those things at a higher level
than EMTs.  They should be combined because its a logical progression.
     Medic-0  First Aid
     Medic-1  EMT/Nurse
     Medic-2  Paramedic/Registered Nurse
     Medic-3  Doctor
     Medic-4  Specialist etc.

I wonder if we really need this.  Most of space travel is either
ships boat (in system), or astrogation (jump).  Pilot seems to have
less and less importance.  You have vehicle-ground, vehicle-sea, vehicle-air,
vehicle-grav, why not vehicle-space.  The only reason to keep it with Astrogation around is for compatiblity.

	I would like to second (third?) the vote for a Belter class.  It
can be part of merchant or something, but I would definately like to see
it included.  This would require some sort of prospecting skill (though I
guess this is just a combo of geology and sensor skills).  I was never so 
hot on the Hunter class.  
	I was also thinking that "Agent" might be expanded into something 
broader like "Security Forces", and include police, spies, private eyes, 
etc.  

Survey skill:  what is this skill for?  I\'m not saying it should be 
dumped, I just want a description of what it\'s good for.

Recon:  same as above.

Liaison skill:  someone said this had something to do with orbital 
artillery.  I\'m pretty certain this was an error. It\'s more of a 
"Diplomacy" skill.

Equestrian:  In retrospect, I think this should be renamed.  It does 
imply horses only (what about Ton-Tons and Tarsus Nobbles?).  Riding is 
not a great substitute, but it would do.  I was thinking that maybe 
"Ground Vehicle" or "Surface Vehicle" could include "riding animal" as an 
option.

	As a more general comment, I like the way MT handled skills.  I 
like the idea of groups of skills, and categories like "Inate" which 
contained streetwise, leader, etc. that you could choose from.  This 
helped in directing character generation.

price of the ship is directly relatable to the Thrust value, and even

There seems to be some misconception abouut Armorer. He doesn\'t make armor;
he is a small arms (maybe large arms) repair and maintenance person. The
craftsman down the street here fixes many different things (appliances, etc)
but I would probably not take him my SiG P-228 if its smokestacking (jargon

Atlas was one of the rarer modules. It never had UWPs, although there was
some effort to produce those Sector UWP lists. I expect they are the ones
posted on the GEnie Traveller area.

There was never any formal plan to publish that list as a Module.

This listing is from the proposed Imperium Games publication schedule:

"FIRST SURVEY
This vital companion to Milieu 0 is an atlas of the 50 or so sectors that
were the Vilani Empire and its surrounding territories. The star systems of
the Sylean Federation are well defined. Farther and farther out, systems are
less well-defined. Each adventuring group determines its own survey results
for each system they visit. Lester Smith."

The concept is that this module will show the location of the star systems on
sector maps, but NOT the world data (or even the starport information). If it
has a gas giant, that would be there, as would some clue as to water/fuel
availability.

For limited regions (The Sylean Federation; The Neighborhood Of Vland, Terra)
the module would provide current information. Additional data would refer to
what was in the data banks: data now maybe 1200 to 1700 years old.

Fixing or making custom mods to Battle Dress is included in the BattleDress skill I think.  Today, most every infantryman can take apart his M16 and put it back together again, making repairs and minor upkeep.  Its not un-realistic to expect the Imperial Marines to not do the same training.  Can they fix chunks that are blown away?  Doubtful, but they probably could repair straps and stuff that keeps it put together.

Good point I rarely use the virus in my campaigns. The only place it
rears its head is Vampire ships. In CT these encounters are manned by
locals instead of computers.

    'body' => 'Greetings All:

Im (still) in the midst of preparing for a new Traveller campaign (Im
leaning towards the Classic setting, but might hold off until the first T4
items come out to see if well switch there). Ive been going through things
that look odd since the original incarnation of Traveller to todays
technology. Of course, one of the biggest glaring differences are in the way
Traveller portrayed computers vs. what we have today (and this difference
is, as we all know, one of the longest sources of debate starting from the
Origins seminars I attended way back when to todays discussions on how T4
will look!).

Ive thought of a few things to present to my players and would like to run
them past you and your collective wisdom.

Reason One for difference: Traveller was written in the mid-1970s. We
werent wired then they way we are now and nobody really thought wed advance
as quickly. So it has a sort of clunky anachronistic charm. I feel
uncomfortable changing the rules because its like picking at a loose thread
on your suit: You might end up unraveling the whole thing.

Reason Two for difference: Most of the ships in the Traveller universe are
built for rough travel. Its a jungle out there: Unfriendly powers, pirates,
troublesome natives. You never know when youre going to run into a storm
while re-fueling around a gas giant, or a bubble in hyperspace. The computers
are built military style--ultra-rough and tough to take a lot of punishment.

Reason Three for difference: Many years ago, humaniti had much better
computers. Heck, they even developed computers that would think for
themselves and had psionic powers! Then some of these telepathic AIs tried
to take things over. That was the start of the Psionic Suppressions--and of
course, as you know, things didnt end there. Thats way today (the Classic
era) we have psionic powers suppressed and computers are clunky--nobody
really trusts either and they only build computers advanced enough to do the
job and no better.

Waiting your counter-battery bursts...

Actually, thinking about it in retrospect, I\'ve done a 180 on my 
opinion on this.  Especially after reading opinions by others.  Just 
like every 20th century soldier is taught how to strip, clean, oil, 
and service his weapon, a 57th century soldier is going to be 
expected to, and need to know how to patch, service, and repair his 
body armor, which would be as integral a part of his equipment as 
the M-16 is to a US soldier today.  Low levels of this skill could be 
for routine maintenance, medium levels could be for repair, high levels for 
actually being able to build the stuff from scratch.  I guess what 
I\'m saying is that I\'d like to see the description for this skill 
before I\'d comment further.  Another way to limit this might be to 
limit the ability to get this skill to the places it would really be 
most necessary: Army & Marines.

I guess I find people complaining about seperating the rules from the 
background kind of amusing.  I run CT with MT rules, and have been 
for years.  I just ignore the sidebars from the rules, and I don\'t 
hand the Imperial Encyclopedia (which is mostly CT stuff anyways) to 
the players...

Yes, there are lots of references to Virus in the TNE rules, but 
there is no rule in the game that says I can\'t play the game with a 
different setting, and if there was, I certainly could ignore it.  On 
the other hand, I don\'t like the TNE rules, so...

But that\'s a story for another time.

Gads--what sugary memories that subject brings back!

Anyway: How do you all handle the passage of time in your campaigns? We have
the standard Imperial Year, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, etc. I presume that
most ships, especially Imperial Military ships follow Imperial time. But what
about smaller ships? Independent ships?

And--does anybody ever use odd days in their campaign. You land on the
planet--the day is 12 standard hours long--or 48?

I\'ve recently come across a few pieces of SF that had interesting treatments
of this idea.

The first is CJ Cherryh\'s "Downbelow Station". Orbiting Pell, a planet around
Tau Ceti, Downbelow Station has taken on Pell\'s day, which is longer (by
nearly twice, if my memory is correct) than that of Earth. To compensate, the
station (and the ground contingent) operate on the "Main Day" and "Alter Day"
schedule--the two together make up one Pell Day.

The second is David Weber\'s "Honor Harrington" series. I\'m slogging through
the first of the series "On Basilisk Station". One thing that was amusing was
the first chapter, where galactic directions are given as North, South, East
and West. Apparently this universe is as flat as the Traveller Universe
(insert big grin and wink here). The "pocket empire" where the action takes
place has a number of differing days and years for each planet in the system.
As a result, computers have a time calculator built in and the author
mentions on more than one occasion the differences between the times of each
planet. For example, one planet has a fairly normal day of hours (60 minutes
each), plus one additional shorter hour to compensate for the
difference--this additional hour being called a "comp".

Kim Stanley Robinson and Philip K. Dick use a similar approach for Mars. P.K.
Dick coined the term "The Martian Time Slip" for the difference between a
Terran day and a Martian day. Robinson follows up on this and has the clocks
of his Martian colony flash "24:00" until the end of the time slip. I recall
that in "The Rolling Stones", Robert A. Heinlein had one of the twin
characters (Castor and Pollux, of course!) leave his watch on Terran time,
the other twin had changed the setting of his watch to match the new day.

Any thoughts?

Only 1 thing about it.  Although it doesn\'t bother me a bit, there 
are a few people of deeper faith who might find bringing 
Religious/Theologian matters into a role-playing game a little 
offensive.  In my games, alien philosophies and religions are at 
times part of the backdrop.  Others may not be quite so open-minded 
on the subject of religion though.

You\'d need to subscribe to GEnie.  The sector data has been reposted 
to the Sunbane archives though, as well as several other places.  I 
believe mpgn has the data at ftp.mpgn.com

Daniel,

I got to thinking about your reply and I realized that I responded 
a little harshly.  What can I say, I\'m part Irish & Scottish, and 
we\'re not exactly noted for controlling our temper...  :-)

I tried as much as I could to keep my personal opinions out of the 
survey.  I guess I got so angry at you because you made it sound as 
if I had some sort of personal agenda here.  If I did, my personal 
agenda didn\'t work.

Anybody whose read my opinions for very long on this list, 
will realize that they are quite a bit different from what the survey 
bore out.  I don\'t like FF&S.  I don\'t want to spend that long 
designing a ship.  I\'d much rather take that kind of time to detail a 
few critical NPC\'s, a few worlds, or write a few more adventure 
hooks.  My time is too precious to take the time to design a ship 
with FF&S.  I like MT, and may still use it if I don\'t like the less 
complex system that is being worked on as we speak.  It still gives 
me a reasonably detailed ship, and doesn\'t take long to do on a 
spreadsheet.

On the other hand, there are a lot of "gearheads" (I hate that term 
now just about as much as the word  "canon" on this list) who want 
that level of detail, and frankly, some of them present quite 
convincing arguments on why a FF&S style product is necessary.  I 
don\'t agree with them, but they are obviously passionate in what they 
feel, just as you are in your defense of Book 2.  They were also out 
there in much larger numbers than people who leapt to the defense of 
Book 2.

When 58 out of 62 people responding to a survey tell me they\'ve seen 
Book 2, and only 3 of those people say they still want to use it, I 
think my statement that "virtually no one wants to return to a Book 
2 system" is not jumping to conclusions without the data to back it 
up.  I recall Rob Miracle saying that there are about 500 people on 
the 2 lists about a month ago (maybe Rob can update this number).  If 
this is the case 62 is about 12-13% of that number.  That is a far 
larger sampling than most polls taken in other arenas.  Heck, 
presidential victories are usually called on less than 13% of the 
returns.  

No it is not scientific, and yes you can dispute the findings if you 
wish, but everyone on this list had a chance to make their feelings heard.  
If they choose not to do so, then as in any other democratic process, 
silence is assumed to be consent...  Obviously the majority didn\'t want 
to take the time to respond to a poll.  Maybe they don\'t care what the 
next system looks like.  Maybe they\'re shy or afraid of being flamed 
(although they had my e-mail address to mail it privately to me if they 
wished).  Maybe they didn\'t read either of the messages about it I posted.  
Or maybe they came to the same conclusions by themselves that the poll did.  
All I can do is report the results and draw conclusions based on the 
data I have.

I\'m sorry that the results didn\'t come out the way you hoped, but 
hey, they didn\'t come out the way I would have liked either...

Some might, but some aren\'t. I make no bones about being a Christian, but
there *is* a Christian role-playing game out there (DragonRaid--take a look
at http://associate.com/innovative/dragonraid/index.html or
http://www.alaska.net/~cass/draid/draid.html). You can even download
the rules from an ftp site. My point is that I am of a deeper faith, and so
are those who play DragonRaid, and I personally think that a Role-Playing
game is a great medium for exercising one\'s faith, practicing apologetics,
etc. I\'ve actually thought about doing a Traveller campaign in which the
characters are travelling evangelists!

In other words, I definitely see the relevance of this skill :)

Absolutely.  It\'s not refered to as the POST VIRUS era for nothing.  Virus
is rare in TNE having largely killed itself off in the initial generations.
The only difference between a vampire ship and a pirate ship is that the
vampire may or may not have an actuall crew and is probably in a worse state
of repair.

I think your suggestion is getting away from the main idea of what skills
realy are.  Religion/Theology is a set of beliefs not a skill.  For example
you don\'t list your religion on your resume.  That would be like having a
skill called Republican/Democrate to indicate your political views.

I do agree with you that such beliefs do offer the potential for some ideas
during a game. But a religious scholar would have skills in Admin, Language,
Computer and possible Streetwise and Bribery.  And such skills would make
the charator more attractive to a player.

So what?  You could use the rules from D+D in the Classic Imperium.  The
problem with TNE was that the rule book presented the virus as part of the
basic rules!  Sure you could remove it, but why tangle background with rules
when there is no need to?  Especially when doing so shrinks the market for
your game.

I think the exposion of skills in Traveller is causing a loss of comman
sense.  \'Fencing\' skill is a great example.  If you have property to sell
you find a buyer.  Why do you need a special skill just because the property
has been pinched??  I suppose you could claim the skill allows the seller a
chance to know the buyer is realy working for the police, but simply being
an alert player would work as well and lead the player to beleive that his
presense during the game matters!  Otherwise every action the players make
is now dictated by a simple role of the dice.  No need for the players to
put any thought into their action just role a few dice and see if you succeed.

Another example is Gunsmith.  (Yes I do know that being a gunsmith requires
special training) But mechanical skill already covers this.  And with so
many types of \'guns\' in Traveller you now have to break it down into \'Rifle
GunSmith\', \'Body Pistol GunSmith\', \'Laser Carbine GunSmith\', \'Gauss Rifle
GunSmith\' and on and on.

In GT there were only six basic stats.  Each was important in it\'s own
right.  In the same way a small subset of skills makes each skill important
and meaningful.

You\'re looking at this as an issue of religious affiliation and not
religious education.  What of the pastor or theologan who went to
school to learn this stuff for years?

I think the best thing to do is create a Scholar skill where you take
it and declare what you\'re a Scholar in.  This will allow anything
from comic books to religion to works of art.  The effects for each
are the same, the more knowledge you have in a subject, the better you
can dig for details or relate the topic to someone else.  

This also allows some customization based on campaign and character. 
Instead of having an exhaustive list of skills, you can just have stuff
like Scholar, Scientist, etc, where the rules work the same.  Provide
some examples for the players and GM\'s and things get really easy.

I don\'t know. There are certain skills associated with religions (languages
to be learned, philosophy--just take a look at the huge subject of
apologetics!). Maybe it could be a cascaded portion of Scholar?

Also probably true!

I can buy the first half, but I\'m not so sure about the second.

That was the start of the Psionic Suppressions--and of course, as you
know, things didnÆt end there.

Ok, I see where you\'re going..so now days we don\'t allow
computers to become powerful enough to challenge bio-superiority.
 
How about I give you a technical reason that keeps the big, clunky,
power hungry computers?

Reason Four:  Gravtics!  The development of gravity control technology
had a very un-welcome side-effect, it played regular *hell* with
microelectronics.  In the presence of a working anti-grav device
anything more delicate than a vacuum tube burns right out.  In fact, I
work it such that a landing anti-grav ship can take out half the
planet\'s electronics...if it\'s all chip and transistor based.

- ----
Imperial Encyclopedia:

Some cultures never discovered gravity control and persisted with
electronics development.  This led to them inventing things that would
make our electronic devices look like bundles of sticks. OTOH, without
the advances coming from gravtics research, these misguided societies
are invariably limited to their own worlds, and begin to stagnate and
slide into overpopulation, wars, and eventually world wide
catastrophes!  [Imperial propaganda.  <g>]

Our scouts have come across several of these worlds.  In many cases,
we find destroyed societies with the populance reduced to barbarism.  

Occasionally, we find them in time to help them reverse their
technological direction and travel down the correct path of
development.  Until these worlds can retool their technologies they
are declared as travel restricted zones.

Most worlds discovered and began developing technologies based on
gravtics.  The ability to control gravity is one of the foundations of
our technology.  It has made our star spanning culture possible. 
Loosing some miniaturization in electronics is a small price to pay.
- ----

This gives us big, clunky, power hungry computers (and other
electronics), but as a trade off we get gravity control, T-Plates,
Jump Drives and Fusion in a can!

Knowledge is one thing but access to the necessary tools and equipment is
another.  For example, I know the basic theories behind casting a cast-iron
engine block... now all I need is the smelting plant, a forge, and a mold of the
original  8-)

If such a skill allows maintenance of such equipment, it would be extremely
*specialized* knowledge.  Repair of high tech equipment is no longer "repair"
but "Re & Re" or simply "replacement" of damaged components (Ford just came out
with a non-servicable transmission).  Even today, companies don\'t spend a lot of
time repairing items such as PCs; they replace entire components instead.  Under
battlefield conditions, you have to decide how many seperate components make up
a single suit of Battle Dress and if all of these components are kept in stock
at the local depot at all times.

Personally, I\'ve always considered repair-type skills to be entirely different
than building- & design-type skills.  IMHO, one requires a natural-born
mechanical aptitude while the other requires an education in engineering,
architecture, etc.

I think that any basic use skill should cover basic familiarity
with user level maintenance... Combat Rifleman type skills will
cover stripping and cleaning and oiling and fixing the 2 or 3
most common failures which can be field repaired, etc.  Grav vehicle
will teach you how to change the starter battery and fuses and
such... Ground Vehicle would cover the battery, fuses, oil, and
changing tires at least, things like that.  If it is normal for
average people who use something to be able to repair it to a
certain level, then that repair skill should be subsumed into
the user skill.

More specific maintenance skills should be specialist-oriented;
an armorer has armory skills in serious and depot level weapons
repair, mechanical skills in doing heavy car repair, changing out
major components, etc.

I would agree with you about R&R practices. However, there is this
logistical train associated with R&R maintenance practices. In the
darkness of space, no one can hear your triplicate requisition for the
widget that makes the thingie go. I feel that as society moves away
from its logistic support, like space, the skills to repair will
increase in scope and complexity. That\'s why in colonial societies, the
artisans and craftsmen are the ones who build the society. This is
based on their ability to fabricate and repair stuff from over there.

Personal military goods are a prime example of this. In WWII, the
ability of American GI\'s to tinker with other nation\'s weapons and
equipment and make them go was noted often by historians (reference
check any one?). This is in the absence of the logistic train that
supports the other product.

IMO, a variety of skills is necessary, if the guidance is there for
acquiring them.

13% of the returns in a presidentail race still amounts to several hundred

You\'re right.  It isn\'t.  And I think it would be a mistake for IG to gamble
future sales of the system on the view point of 62 internet users who
responded to a survey.

Majority?  You mean the majority of internet users, not the majority of
Traveller players.  An silence can not be assumed to be consent, it could
mean that only 62 people noticed the survey.  I often skim through parts of
the list that don\'t interest me.

Sorry Stu, but the results you have do not allow you to draw any conclusion
other than \'58 out 62 internet users who like Traveller and respond to
surveys like complexity\'  IG would be making a big mistake gambling future
sales of their system on your conclusion (unless they only wanted to sell it
to internet users who like Traveller and respond to surverys).

The point I\'m trying to make about the survey is that the results althought
interesting are rather meaningless.  All they show is that a small subset of
internet users who subscribe to this list and respond to surveys like
complexity.

What\'s wrong with just using the Education stat?  

Ok, what about looking at it the same way as history.  Historians spend
years in study, yet unless you define a history skill for each and every
subset of history you would be better off just using the players Education
Stat.  Save skills for situations that clearly fall outside of the bounds of
the basic stats.  Example, don\'t add a juggling skill, simply use the
players Dex if needed.  (Yes, not every PC can juggle.  But that would be
apparent based on the PCs background)

I don\'t think that analogy is quite right; listing yourself as
Republican/Democrat is more like listing your skills as Christian/Muslim,
not "Religion Theology". You can get an undergraduate degree in theology,
which in my mind makes it a skill similar to history. It can cover a broad
range of faiths or perhaps one faith in particular, and the character\'s
skill need not have anything to do with his or her faith - it\'s conceivable
to have an atheist sociologist with Religion-3, trying to put into
psychohistorical perspective the causes and influences of religion, for
example.

I like the "scholar" idea someone else posted. With a few examples, it
could cover all such skills that, while admittedly worthy and worthwhile to
have in a campaign, are similar enough of little-used enough that the space
saved by putting them under one umbrella would be better used for other
things - like a paragraph on rock-throwing :)

I don\'t think so.  Understanding Aslan beleifs in central to understanding
why the Aslan are the way they are.  Perhaps the skill should be called
"Ritual" in an attempt to get away from the whole religious part but it is a
relatively important thing.  Assuming you want to get into that whole can of
worms in the first place.  A knowledge of Ritual, specific to culture, could
potentially stop you from putting your proverbial foot in it when you
encounter the local leader.  The last thing you want to do is offend a man
who\'s already on the edge when he\'s got nuclear weapons.

My problem was that I wanted to use the character generation system from TNE
with a heavily modified version of CT that I had devised.  In my campaign, I was
planning on introducing Virus earlier than depicted in the game (ie: the players
were unaware of what was to come).  The TNE rulebook was laid out so poorly that
my players easily stumbled into the Virus information between the Character
Generation and Skills sections.  Thankfully, they only gave it a brief glimpse
(they though it dealt with some sort of biological virus and didn\'t see the real
Virus coming  8-)

Personally, I like the old boxed RPG concept, with separate books for players
and referees.  That way, information stays where it belongs.

I agree.  However, I also believe that a plateau will be reached when humanity
can no longer learn enough to repair high tech equipment _without_ specific high
tech repair tools & equipment (eg: silicon chip design, for example).  I see
this type of stuff in the automotive trade all the time.  Believe me, no
mechanic I know of could repair any of the sensors or actuators on some of
today\'s cars, not to mention a burned out ECM (ie: computer). They\'re too
miniturized, for one thing.  When things are designed to be resiliant, they are
often equally difficult to repair ("replacement" is usually pretty easy,
though).  As things become more and more sophisticated, I would imagine that the
components would become equally integrated until one epoxy-sealed black box did
everything.  There will always be widgets and thingies, however  8-)

I have seen a hard drive that belonged to a customer a few years ago.  It seems
that he had a hard disk failure and was so mad that he fired off three rounds
from his .357 Magnum into his hard drive.  Now this would be a good example of
battle damage and NO amount of tinkering and fiddling would bring that drive

Living long enough to learn all of these skills then becomes an issue 8-)

As technology advances, however, a single skill point in "Electronics" becomes
far more valuable than a single skill point in "Climbing".  If electronics is
going to become such a popular/necessary skill in the future, it should be
broken down into a number of cascade skills to allow for better roleplaying as
an electronics specialist.

comments, suggestions, information, corrections, additions and deletions.
I have tried to address several concerns brought up on the list regarding
various skills, and have tried to run the middle road between those who
want detailed skills and those who want broad skills.  I leaned a little
towards detail for military skills to satisfy all the merc types out
there, and I think the technical skills are a little on the detailed side
as well. Let me know what you think. 

NOTE ON SKILLS BY TECH LEVEL

I think skills should be understood to be mediated by the character\'s 
native TL.  Someone from a TL-5 world might have mechanic skill, but he 
won\'t be able to repair starship turrets (At least not  easily.  I\'d say 
give a -DM equal to the TL difference).


SKILL CATEGORIES

Skills below are placed in categories mainly for ease of organization.  
These categories could also be used in chargen, just like in 2300AD 
(e.g., you get x number of skills from Underworld Skills).

Skills come in several types:

(D) Default: represents a skill that everyone has at level-0.
	(DL): only individuals at low (3-) tech levels get this as default.
	(DM): only individuals at medium TL (4-8) get this as default.
	(DH): only individuals at high TL (9+) get this as default.
[I considered having Dn+, where n would be a specific tech level, but I 
think this is simpler and does the job just as well. Comments?]

(C) Cascade: represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of them and 
all others are at 1/2 level.

(G) Group:  represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of them but 
get level-nil in all others (or level-0 at GM\'s discretion).

same results. I would lump both into this skill.]



***ACADEMIC SKILLS***********************

Research (D)

Instruction  
[Not default, I teach and it took a while to learn.  Most people are 
lousy at it on their first try (many are lousy their whole lives).  Maybe 
I\'m too close to the problem, though...]

"standard" philosophies].

	-Psychology, applied [The "softer" side of psych, social psych, 
talk therapy, etc.]
	-Sophontology [this is a more universal version of anthropology].

skills.  It represents knowledge about belief systems, holy writings, 
etc. from various cultures]


***CRIMINAL/POLICE SKILLS******************

Blackmarketeer [Refers to the ability to find buyers for elicit goods.

Gambling (D)

Interrogation (D)

	-Choose specific animal.

Aircraft (G)
	-Helicopter	: copters, autogyros.
	-Prop Plane	: including VTOL at TL-7+.
	-Jet Plane	: including VTOL and trans-atmosphere at TL-8+.
	-Light-t-Air	: blimps, baloons.
	-Glider	: 
	-Jet Pack	:
[Can anyone think of others?  Are the last two too specific? I was 
thinking of lumping them into "Personal Flyer" or something like that.]	

(Astrogation has been replaced by Navigation and Astrography).

Communications (DM) (DH)

Computer (C)
	-Programming	
	-Repair

Designer (G)
	-Spacecraft	:
	-Architectural	:
	-Vehicular	:
[Can anyone think of others?  This is supposed to be "engineering" in the 
20th century sense, but is called "design" to distinguish it.]

Electronics 

Engineer  [This refers to running and repairing starships as opposed to 
designing them.]

Farming

Grav Craft (C) 
	-Personal Flyer: grav belt, grav cycle.

spacecraft when using antigrav.

Navigation [Refers to spacecraft in jump space. Pilot covers navigation 
in real space. Orienteering covers navigation on planet surfaces.]

Pilot [Refers to spacecraft (of any size) maneuvering/navigating in real 
space. Ship\'s boat is eliminated and/or covered by Grav Craft]

Prospecting [Or is this just a combination of Sensor Ops and Geology?]

Robotics

Sensor Operations

	-Writing
	etc. etc.

Politics


***MERCANTILE SKILLS************************

Trader

Carousing

Innate (G)
	-Carousing

	-Liaison
[Missing any here?]

Jack-of-all-Trades [I picture this as a skill which enables your other 
skills to wander into neighboring disciplines.]

Language (C)
	-Choose a particular language 

[Note:  I think language skills should be given as part of the 
character\'s "background package" or some step which is not part of career 
resolution. This resolves the problem of "wasting" skills on gaining 
languages.  Having grown up in Quebec, I\'m bilingual, but not because of 
any "training"]

Orienteering [refers to navigating on planet surfaces]

Perception (D) [I don\'t like the idea of a seperate Observation skill.  
The argument was good, and I too am a good observer but bad perceiver, 
but I feel this dilutes things a bit too much]

Recon (D) [maybe we should call this skill scouting or something like that?]

Survey [could someone please explain to me what this skill is?]

Survival [Not default, lots of people have died cuz they didn\'t know not 
to drink salt water.]

I can\'t argue with you here a bit.  Since the days of CT, and the old 
"For Referees Only" on the Adventures, GDW didn\'t really make much of 
an effort to keep information of any kind secret from players.

If stuff is "For Referees Only", it shouldn\'t be in the same book at 
all.  It should be in a seperate book.

If this happened c 300,000BC then the "near-intelligent cavemen" cannot have
been Homo sapiens, but some earlier human type. The small gene-pool of
abducted "cavemen" have therefore undergone 300,000 years of divergent
evolution from the base population on Terra.  The Terran population evolved
into Homo Sapiens, but the transported populations would not have done so -
they would have evolved into other geni(?) of Homo or into entirely new
species: some of these transported populations may never have evolved full
intelligence.  This means that neither the Vilani or the Zhodani can
possibly be Homo Sapiens and must belong to some other human genus.

I don\'t know if this is the intended consequence of the Ancient Abduction,
but its a fascinating idea!

skills define a character\'s origin, or does the character define what and 
why the skills are? In other words, does a character become `religious\' 
or knowledgeable about religion (a) because she has that skill or (b) 
because that is a background which explains (some of) the skills that 
character has?

Taking me as an example, under model (a) I would have a UPP something like

664BC8 Scientist, in 2nd term, age 24 Cr few
Religion-2 Chemistry-2 Physics-1 Computing-1 Instruction-1 Jack-o-T-1

Under model (b) I would be more like

664BC8 Scientist, in 2nd term, age 24 Cr few
Chemistry-2 Physics-1 Computing-1 Instruction-1 Liason-1 Psychology-1 JoT-1

with the Liason skill representing learning to get along with people in a 
practical sense and the Psychology being something in which I\'m interested,
partly in the context of understanding people\'s spirituality.

The point I\'m trying to make is that skills in Traveller represent 
specific things that a character can do well, and which are likely to be 
used quite often. We could get silly with the skills above, and start 
including ones like Guitar-1 and Technical Writing-2, but these skills 
are simply not necessary; if it becomes particularly important that a 
character\'s guitar playing be impressive, then the ref can assign a level 
of skill based on how much time the character practices, and roll a task 
based on skill and Dex (say). Technical writing is a function of 
education and technical competence (appropriate science skill).

Going back to religion, therefore, I would separate this out into 
`generally applicable skills\' (social and academic, mainly) and `things 
in which the character takes a particular interest\' (which I would 
moderate via rolls on Edu, Int and maybe Soc, or -- mostly -- via role 
playing). The former should be part of the main skill set; the latter are 
characterisations and part of the role-playing proper.

Mind you, having said all that, you do need to have a reasonable number 
of `basic\' skills. I wouldn\'t go back to the CT `scientists have computer 
skill and maybe electronics\' approach...

This seems to be a good and simple rule.

>SKILL CATEGORIES

>think this is simpler and does the job just as well. Comments?]

For me, DL, DM and DH seem to be sufficient.

>***MILITARY SKILLS*************************
>
>Archery (C)	[I do not think this should be a default skill]

I agress with you, no default, even for low TLs.
I would change this to (G) and drop Atlatl.

>["Armorer" has been placed as a cascade of craftsman, below]

I would include the ability to fix devices into the corresponding useage
skills (mainly Fire Combat and Battledress), as Derek sugested earlier in
this list.

>Blade (C)
>	-Short Blade (D): knives, daggers, blades...
>	-Long Blade (D) : swords, cutlass, broadsword...  
>	-2 Hand Blade (D): bastard sword, 2 handed sword...

I would drop D for Long and 2H blades.

>Cudgel (C)
>	-Short Club (D)	: billy club, bo stick, bottle...
>	-Long Club (D)	: baseball bat, treebranch...
>	-Staff (D)	: staff, pole, broomhandle...
"2 Hand Club" to be uniform?

>Environment Combat (C)

I would abstract this to "trained to fight in unusual environments" and drop
all cascades.

>Field Artillery 
>Gunnery

Are here great differences? Oh, some people would say, of course I suppose.

>Hammer/Axe/Mace (C) [Can anyone think up a better term for this?]

I wouldn\'t divide melee weapons so far. Perhaps impaling and slashing
weapons are enough. For a fantasy game, a broader diversification might be
useful, but I think just to provide some primitive barbarian skills, this is
enough.

>Heavy Weapons (C)
>[I would also include laser-based variants at TL 9+, and plasma/fusion 
>variants at TL 12+]

Will they really work so differnt that different (sub)skills are needed?
Isn\'t it all about targetting and pulling the trigger? :-)

>Melee Weapon (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)

I feel that a third level isn\'t a good idea. I would go with only this melee
skill and drop the cascades of these subskills.

>Ranged Weapon (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)

Same goes here.

>Slug Weapon (C)  [Each includes tranq, googun, and tangler equivalents.]

I don\'t think, that pistols and rifles should be D. Perhaps it\'s that way in
the U.S. but in most parts of the world weapons aren\'t freely available and
most people will have no training in these skills.

>Unarmed Combat (D)  
>[I don\'t like the idea of distinguishing Brawling and Martial Arts.  Yes 
>they are different, but they aim to achieve the same goal and have the 
>same results. I would lump both into this skill.]

I agree.

>***ACADEMIC SKILLS***********************

>Instruction  

Is this skill useful I a lot of roleplaying situations? It\'s also difficult
to learn Calligraphy and it\'s no skill in Traveller (yet) 

Science = natural science and Scolar = liberal arts? These are the
(translated) terms I would categorize the skills under.

>	-Theology 
>[This does not represent one\'s faith, which is outside the realm of 
>skills.  It represents knowledge about belief systems, holy writings, 
>etc. from various cultures]

That\'s the right definition, IMHO.

>***CRIMINAL/POLICE SKILLS******************

>Blackmarketeer 

I would drop this skill, because most social skills should be left to
roleplaying and selling "hot" goods isn\'t that different to selling or
buying any goods.

>Break and Enter [Replaces "Intrusion" which is not overly clear and 
>sounds sort of immoral :-) ]

I would prefer one-world skill names.

>Disguise [not default, in my opinion]

I\'d agree

>Forensics

I also could be a subskill of medicine, IMHO.

>Forgery [Definately not default, IMO]

Yes.

>Gambling (D)
>
>Interrogation (D)

To get information from a suspect or witness isn\'t that simple, I think. No
default.

>Intimidation (D)

I would drop this.

>(Investigation has been removed.  In my opinion it is a combination of 
>Forensics, Interrogation, Perception, and Streetwise.)

Then, it\'s a good canditat to include this skill and drop all other (just
kidding :-) Perhaps, I would drop Forensics and replace Interrogation with
(the more general) Investigation.

>***TECHNICAL SKILLS*********************
>
>Animal Rider (C)  [note, this is here because technically, it\'s a vehicle]

I would simply call this "Riding" and drop the cascade for simpicity.

>Animal Care (C)  [includes training, maintaining, packing, and husbandry]
>	-Choose specific animal.

Again for the same reason, drop C.

>Aircraft (G)

>[Can anyone think of others?  Are the last two too specific? I was 

Yes.

>(Astrogation has been replaced by Navigation and Astrography).

What\'s the need of Astrography besides Astrogation?

>Computer (C)
>	-Programming	
>	-Repair		
>	-Hacking
>	-Applications (DH)

Computer usage (Applications) should be open for everyone. No skill needed.
I would put Hacking and Programming together (even it Hacking is only a form
of creative application use but I need some more knowledge) and to repair
computers, I would suggest the Electronics skill. ("How many computer
scientists do you need to change a defect light blub? Zero. It\'s a hardware
problem.")

>Designer (G)
>	-Spacecraft	:
>	-Architectural	:
>	-Vehicular	:
>[Can anyone think of others?  This is supposed to be "engineering" in the 
>20th century sense, but is called "design" to distinguish it.]

I would drop this skill. 

>Engineer  [This refers to running and repairing starships as opposed to 
>designing them.]

>Farming

Isn\'t this a craft? (At least with my understanding of craft)

>Gravitics

Isn\'t this a science?

>Navigation [Refers to spacecraft in jump space. Pilot covers navigation

If that\'s no more, I would stay with Astrogation.

>Pilot [Refers to spacecraft (of any size) maneuvering/navigating in real 
>space. Ship\'s boat is eliminated and/or covered by Grav Craft]

Piloting a space craft is either done with some programming or the same as
flying with a grav vehicle, IHMO. Sophisticated controls will reduce the
needed instruments to a minimum. So I would introduce something like general
Spacecraft Operation add Spacecraft as subskill to the general driving skill.

>Prospecting [Or is this just a combination of Sensor Ops and Geology?]

No, I don\'t think so. I would see this as own skill, perhaps named Mining?

> Space (G)
>	-Pilot
>	-Navigation
>	-Engineer
>	-Gunnery
>	-Vacc
>[Am I missing any here?]

All skill are already listed anywhere. Why a special Space-Group?

>***PROFESSIONAL SKILLS********************

>Diplomacy (D)

I would drop D.

>Medicine (DM) (DH) [I like the idea of Med-1 being 1st Aid up to Med-4

>Politics

What\'s that? Oratory? Diplomacy? Unscrupulousness?

I would say professional.

Good point.

Keep it simple.

>Recon (D) [maybe we should call this skill scouting or something like that?]

Yes, please.

>Survey [could someone please explain to me what this skill is?]

As far as I believe, a systematic scouting and cartographing of unknow
regions, or more general, the collection all all data worth knowing.

Still a large set of skills, but it looks good. I still prefer a more
uniform set of combat skills as follows:

Melee (Unarmed)
        Covering brawling and at higher levels artial arts.
        Also covering combat with iron-fists or similar weapons.

Melee (Blade weapons)
        Covering attacking, parrying and (at higher levels) fencing with
        pointed weapons.

Melee (Clubs)
        Covering attacking, parrying with hacking or slashing weapons
        where you have to wing your weapon instead of stabbing.

Melee (Polearms)
        Covering combat with long, mostly two handed weapons.

Missile combat (Throwing weapons)
        Covering targetting with throwing knifes, spears or axes.
        Also covers sling weapons.

Missile combat (Bow)
        Use of historic (curved) or modern (composite) bows.

Missile combat (Crossbow)
        Use of all kind of crossbows.

Gun combat (Early firearms)
        Covers use and maintenance of simple black powder weapons.
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.

Gun combat (Modern firearms)
        Covers use and maintenance of modern slug weapons
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.
        Gaus weapons are included here.

Gun combat (Energy weapons)
        Covers use and maintenance of lasers and plasma rifles.
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.

Gun combat (Heavy weapons)
        Covers all kinds of rocket throwers, anti-tank weapons or
        heavy machine guns.

You might actually want to specialize this (Imperial, Subsector, 
Planetary), or (Trade, Criminal, ...).  Of course, I\'m a law student, so 
when I look at it I see it as a big, diverse, field.


>Medicine (DM) (DH) [I like the idea of Med-1 being 1st Aid up to Med-4
>being surgeon].

I have issues with it.  There are a lot of paths to explore in medicine 
besides surgery.  I have a feeling that the "Med-4 = surgeon" thing is a 
consequence of the emphasis on military things.  There should be people 
with Med-6 who are experts in, say, communicable diseases (this is 
especially relevant when you\'re exploring new planets!).  Most real-world 
physicians do not perform surgery, and have only been exposed to it 
during clinical rotations.

****
XENOQUALIFIERS

Certain skills are going to exist in different versions where different 
races (and sometimes cultures) are concerned.  Both of the skills above 
are good examples.  An Imperial Naval physician with Med-5 who has to 
treat a Vargr will (unless she\'s served with a Vargr unit) not be 
operating anywhere near level 5, and if she has to treat a K\'Kree may be 
no better than someone who has taken a first aid course.  Similarly, a 
lawyer from Vland called in to argue a case on, say, Lair would be 
shocked at what constitutes appropriate courtroom conduct and would 
almost certainly hose his client badly.

Other obvious skills include (off the top of my head) Streetwise, 
Bribery, Liaison, Leadership, *possibly* Broker and Trader (though the 
trade community might be cosmopolitan enough that it wouldn\'t matter), 
Interview, Interrogation.  There are probably others.

I can think of three ways to handle this:

1.  Ignore the differences (I think this is foolish, and tends to make the
    aliens more like "humans in funny suits")

2.  Allow characters who spend time around a different culture or race,
    using their skill, to receive a "xenoqualifier" attached to it, thus
    letting them use the skill effectively in that context

3.  Allow characters to purchase the xenoqualified versions of a skill
    separately from the Imperium versions

I use a combination of (2) and (3) in my own campaign.  I use 2, for 
example, with Medical skill, making -- perhaps wrongly -- the assumption 
that some of the skills learned in human medicine carry over.  I use 3 
with "interaction" skills like Streetwise, where the behavior patterns 
are so culture-dependent that you really need a new skill.

This has come up in my game because the PCs misjumped way deep into Vargr 
space, and have been learning the ropes.

Actually it was originally beleived that the Genus Homo Sapiens was only in
the order of 20-50,000 years old based on fossil evidence obtained from a
number of sites in west africa.  This was held to be absolutely true for
nearly thirty years.  However, over the least decade a number of sites have
begun turning up, particularly in the southern african fossil beds that
would seem to push the origin of Homo Sapiens back to the 150-200,000 year
time frame.  What this means is that Homo Sapiens exited contemperainous
with several other genus for thousands of years.

In theory the Ancients would have had at least three different Homo speicies
to work with.

Howdy!  This is just a bit of an overview of my views on the skills 
thing.  I just got done waxing philisophical (or not) on T4 and some 
basic ideas I have in a mailing re: FFS Lite, so I\'ll keep this a bit 
shorter.  I\'m not going to comment on every skill (which doesn\'t mean I 
like or dislike any given one), but make a few more general comments.

IMHO, in keeping with the idea of a *BASIC* T4 that can be sold to a new 
(and non-gearhead) audience, we don\'t need to get overly complicated in 
defining all the skills. Maybe a supplemental publication on skills?

As a for instance, let\'s look at medical.  For many of us, the following 
worked well enough: 
   Med-0 = mother kisses knee and puts on bandaid and knows not to put 
            tournequet (sp?) around neck,
   Med-1 = standard 1st aid such as taught in the military,
   Med-2 = EMT/field medic,
   Med-3 = (basic) doctor.
For others, splitting into specialties at Med-3 (or 4) and taking 
partial skills in other areas seems good.  e.g.: My combat doctor 
character (Admin-1, Medic-6, GC(Pistol)-5, ..., not necessarily a 
pacifist ;) ) specialized in Trauma(effective level 6), has a related
ability of 5 in (Macro-)Surgery, and maybe a 4 in other specialties.

Computer has also been commented on.  Face it, your average non-chiphead 
(not in this mailing list; maybe an MD who cares a lot about the 
preceeding) doesn\'t know and couldn\'t care less about the differences 
between hardware and software, much less AI, operations, programming, 
etc.  While most of us know that there are a lot of (critical) 
difference, they won\'t reduce playability if the group involved don\'t 
care about them.  ( ref: \'OK, the spaceport supervisor\'s left his office 
to check out your little diversion.  Yes, his terminal\'s powered up.\'  
player: \'I\'ve got comp-4, and I\'m looking for the last month\'s cargo 
manifests.  (out of character) I don\'t know if it\'s AI, operations, or 
programming! I\'m a psychologist, for Pete\'s sake!!)
 

This wasn\'t well developed, but shows what I mean.  Most players have 
areas of greater or lesser interest, and this will be reflected in which 
skills they wish to expand.  Maybe a rule that any skill at a given 
level (4?) or higher must be specialized.  After all, my BS in Nuc Eng 
was very general, covering Health Physics, Fission power, fusion theory,
requlatory concerns, waste management, radiochemestry, and a number of 
lesser topics.  My MS work, on the other hand, is concentrating on 
radwaste remediation, and specifically groundwater transport of 
nuclides.  However, I\'ve gained a lot of experience in researching 
and (with time and a successful research task?) could expand my 
knowledge in other areas to meet or exceed that in my area of 
specialization.

I think it is definitely necessary to have a limited number of canon 
skills, particularly for the first release.  After all, you could have 
200+ skills, and each of us would still find something we\'d like to add. 
Limit the basic (official) amount, and allow refs to add via house 
rules.  It may, however, be a good idea to require new skills to have a 
canon skill to which they are identified for transplant to other games. 
(I know this isn\'t always practical, but wouldn\'t it be nice?)

Default skills: how about a default number (6? 10?) of default \'slots\' 
which a player could select skills for?  Those skills not available for 
default (battledress!, etc.) would be identified.  Others would be 
limited by background (vacc suit-0 not likely for a ground hog, unless a 
SCUBA diver).  Most players would not have bow skill, but I\'ve messed  
around with them enough to have a bow-0, without living on a TL 5- 
planet.  This would allow a lot of background development without a lot 
of time, effort, or effect on game balance. 

Comments on a few skills:

Armorer:  One who works in an armory?  IMHO, both (small) weapons and 
armor.  Low levels imply can maintain effectively, ensure continue to 
work, fit to individuals.  Higher levels allow repair, possibly with 
mech/electronics/computer/etc. skills as required/beneficial. Also maybe 
customize to an individual to improve effectiveness (after SORAG) or 
reduce encumbrance.  Only at very high levels, with additional skills, 
TL/item-specific training, and proper tools/materials/workshop would 
creation be possible.  Of course, may allow use of non-standard 
materials to simulate (limited) armor capability.  Higher levels may  
require cascading to weapons(slug/laser/energy) and armor(cloth/hard 
(ceramic, metal, etc.)/power). 

Fencing:  If swordplay, this might be a high level speciallization under 
blade combat.  If dealing with grey goods, maybe streetwise?

Regarding some of the particular skills people are asking for, it seems 
possible to have a supplement which spells out some additional skills.  
Alternativley, combinations of skills which give the desired effect.  
(e.g. GC(Cbt Rfl)-3 + Vacc-2 + Elect-3 + Mech-2 = Armorer-2) Once again, 
you\'ll never make everyone happy.  I, for instance, find a single skill 
for Engineering to be ludicrous!  But it needn\'t affect playability.  A 
few score skills which are fairly abstract seems a good idea for the 
basic version of T4. 

That\'s all for now - for what it\'s worth! ;)

of recognition, and all the help he can get.  If you haven\'t seen it, 
check it out at:

http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Admiralty/FFSLight/FFSLight.html
I\'d like to get some feed back on a thought I\'ve got on this.  I know
that this audience may be heavy with those who like the full-blown FFS,
but picture yourself or your players in the position of having to whip
up a quick ship in 20 minutes or so.

My ship design experience has been with HG.  As such, I\'m used to most
components (drives, armor, etc.) being proportionately based on ship\'s
displacement.  I pick a tonnage, pick what drives and armor I want, 
pick weapons/defenses, calculate how much powerplant I need, add misc.,
staterooms, bridge, etc., and I\'m pretty much done.  This allows a lot
of flexability in a fairly short time.

I\'m not familiar with FFS, but from looking at the tables on Dave\'s 
page, it looks like most of the calculations are made the same way.  
The point is, I don\'t see a few simple multiplications as being terribly
restrictive.  There are so many ships already out there that anyone who
wants to design one should be willing to go to at least that much 
trouble.  Maybe we could add a catalog of off the shelf components like
CT2, but I hope we don\'t need that!

As far as I can see, it seems like where things might need to be simpler
is where there are a near infinite variety of available options, such as
in weapons design.  Create a few standard varieties based on experience
and make them the options.  And allow those who like greater detail to 
really optimize them with the full FFS.

I guess I\'d rather just a simple list of straightforward calculations,
even if they involve 3 or 4 multiplications at a time, than having to
wade through a ton of tables which limit me to \'standard\' hull sizes.

Comments, anyone?  Don\'t worry, I\'ve got my asbestos underwear on, over
my lead jockey shorts.  Flame away!

I got no problem with a cool looking cover, and even a teaser of the 
adventure on the back cover.  Kind of like the poster art for a 
movie...  

I do got a problem when the background material stuff is on the same 
page as character generation stuff...like it was with MT & TNE...

Good news is that with the Mililieu system that IG is proposing, the 
basic rules are going to be just that (basic rules).  The background 
material for the particular era will be in a seperate supplement.  
This should eliminate that problem.

     That depends.  I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1980, and in that
time, I\'ve never done any role-playing.  I\'m playing a *game*, not a
*role*.  Frankly, the fun for me was the "far future engineering."  The
characters were like chess pieces.  The nice thing was that Traveller
could accomodate both viewpoints.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I really don\'t think that Trav. was developed with this type of customer
in mind. I believe that a large majority bought the game to role-play.

     Why can\'t we have both?  Simple basic rules, and insanely complex
add-ons?

If IG has unlimited resources we could. However, they don\'t & for now
I think it would be very wise for them to concentrate on what originally
made Trav. a big hit. And that wasn\'t tailoring the product to suit old
veterans. If anything, esp. considering the CCG crowd, the public\'s toler-

thing that I believe should weigh heavily in any future decisions.

Actually, ironically enough, it ruins it for the player involved more 
than the GM.  

I don\'t even think that most people would try to do this intentionally.  
But lets face it, if you\'re flipping the pages of Traveller: The New Era, 
you\'re going to run into sidebars.  In fact, if for some reason you 
flipped through to the wrong set of pages, you\'d run into the pages 
detailing the campaign background.  This could be done quite 
accidentally.  At least if the stuff is in a seperate book, you have 
to get the proper book, and start leafing through.  Prevents it from 
happening accidentally.  And if you label it "For Referees Only", or 
some such, it even tells the player to beware.

I\'ve never run across a cheater in an RPG.  There isn\'t much point 
to it.  If I did, it would be the last time they ever gamed with me as 
a Referee, or as a fellow player.

But yes, it would hurt the player more than the referee.

Tough call.  I enjoyed the game, and frankly played it just a few 
months ago.

It does tend to look the same after repetitive play.  There are a few 
things that are kind of fun.  Playing out the invasion of the planet 
is fun.  It gives you a nice full color map in the standard traveller 
format of Earth, which can be useful for other adventures there.  I 
guess it depends on how much you\'re going to get out of it.  If I had 
to make the call at the price you\'re paying, I wouldn\'t know which 
way to go.  Then again, you probably won\'t get too much of a shot at 
it again...

Actually, its more of an operational level ground attack game, with 
the naval combat being limited to Solomani system defense forces 
(SDB\'s and the like), against an Imperial invasion fleet.

Hope this helps...

Really, you just don\'t want them to do 1 at the expense of the 1 you

I understand your point of view, but it would be a mistake to spurn

Religion isn\'t a skill, but Theology is a knowledge.

I had a player back in the late 70\'s that wanted to play a Navy
Chaplin in a game.  We cribbed up a character sheet for him with
anthropology, sociology, phycology, philosophy, and recruiting
included.  I gave him a Theology skill too, but I don\'t recall exactly
what it was for...oh yeah, it was to identify,
understand, evaluate religious ritual in alien cultures.  Maybe I
should have called it Xenotheology.  <g>

Actually, "Theology" is a skill.  Knowing the precepts, dogmas, and so forth
of a religion is an area of knowledge.  The (sad) fact that most church-goers
know little about these aspects of their religion doesn\'t invalidate it as a
useful skill.

(Parenthetical note: I\'m not trying to stir up an argument about a possibly
touchy subject.  Direct flames to me personally, not the list.  For the
record, I\'m an Anglican, warden of my church, and on the boundary between
inclusivism and pluralism.)

For many campaigns I could see this as a useless skill, because religions
don\'t really enter into the game.  But the same could be said for sociology -
many campaigns don\'t really have different cultures.  However, religion _can_
be important in daily life, and understanding how religions work would be an
important skill for a first-contact team to have.  

I would put Theology/Philosophy in the Social Science skill cluster.

I agree here.  Theology is a field of study as serious in its own way 
as biology, chemistry, sociology, etc...  Very definitely a skill as 
the game defines skills.  It will remain a field of study in some form, 
for as long as there are cultures of intelligent beings.

Probably the best suggestion yet...

The truely difficult part is one of treating religious beleifs with respect
(which I imagine you do) -- especially the ones which are not your own!  I
generally include in my own campaigns the assumption that most major human
religions will continue well into the future, but that they are not high on
the list of the priorities of most adventurers.  I have had players wish to
specify reigion as part of their character -- in those cases I simply insist
that they include the practice in their roleplaying as well.

Best added as a GM\'s option, though.  It\'s way too easy to turn religious
NPC\'s in to jokes.  Many published adventures seemed to be of the "wackey
sect of the day" sort, and I found them a bit annoying.  Roleplaying a
missionary, with the right GM, could be very interesting, though.

In the campaigns where I\'ve used them, players who don\'t show respect 
for local religious customs, where such religious customs are 
prevalent in a community (religious dictatorships for example), are just 
asking for (and usually getting into) trouble.

: I think the question of religion skill raises an important point: do 
: skills define a character\'s origin, or does the character define what and 
: why the skills are? In other words, does a character become `religious\' 
: or knowledgeable about religion (a) because she has that skill or (b) 
: because that is a background which explains (some of) the skills that 
: character has?
: 
: Taking me as an example, under model (a) I would have a UPP something like
: 
: 664BC8 Scientist, in 2nd term, age 24 Cr few
: Religion-2 Chemistry-2 Physics-1 Computing-1 Instruction-1 Jack-o-T-1
: 
: Under model (b) I would be more like
: 
: 664BC8 Scientist, in 2nd term, age 24 Cr few
: Chemistry-2 Physics-1 Computing-1 Instruction-1 Liason-1 Psychology-1 JoT-1
: 
: with the Liason skill representing learning to get along with people in a 
: practical sense and the Psychology being something in which I\'m interested,
: partly in the context of understanding people\'s spirituality.

But the problem here is that it doesn\'t take into account Religious
studies.  You\'ve gone from being a religious academic in the first
example to a ship\'s counselor in the second.  A skill like "Religion"
or even "Scholar (Religion)" should cover more than just confession.
What about the 158 yr old Vilani archeologist who\'s been searching for
the Holy Tea Set?  Surely he would have a Religion-3 which doesn\'t
necessarily reflect that he\'s a priest, but rather that\'s he\'s
educated in this particular field (history, legends, lore, etc...).
It\'s no different than "History" except that it has a much more
limited scope--but it\'s still an integral skill to the character (even
if it isn\'t in terms of game mechanics).

 My gut inclination is to complicate this a little bit:  If the
 _concept_ being addressed exists at the lower TL, your rule (DM
 -TLDiff) applies; if it doesn\'t, the task becomes impossible (not
 Impossible the success level, impossible as in "you can\'t do it.")

 Example:  Gasoline-fueled internal-combustion become available in
 the form of the Model-T at TL(4? 5?).  They are still common
 technology (in the form of the Porsche 911) at TL8.  Henry Ford I,
 who could repair one of his own machines, would be able to at
 least understand in principle what\'s going on in that Porsche, but
 couldn\'t repair it as well as he could one of his own.

 Leonardo daVinci, genius as he was, had no conception of the IC
 engine.  You could explain it to him (in Italian, with lots of
 circumlocutions for missing vocabulary), and he might very well
 understand it, but without learning the technology, he\'d not have
 a prayer of being able to do anything with it, in spite of being
 a good mechanic by the standards of his time.

 Unless you\'re going to allow default modification based on other
 than TL (and I think you should), drop the distinction, and don\'t
 provide default skills that are TL-specific.  If you do go with
 other-factor defaults, it\'s better to just list the minimum
 criteria that must be met for it to be a default skill:

 Swimming (D Hyd=9+)

 Any character that lives on a world that\'s more than 85% water
 covered will know how to swim.

 Watercraft, motorized (D Hyd=9+, TL6+)

 Anyone that lives on a world that\'s more than 85% water covered,
 and which has a tech level sufficient for mass-produced motor
 boats will know how to operate a motorboat.

 Watercraft, human powered (D Hyd=9+)

 Any character that lives on a world that\'s more than 85% water
 covered will know how to build rafts, and probably rowboats or
 canoes as well.

 Vacc Suit (D Atm=3-, TL=8+)

 Anyone that lives on a world with a normally-unbreathably-thin
 atmosphere, with a technology high enough to build space suits,
 will know how to wear one, and conduct routine activities in it.

 My gut feeling is that with proper grouping of skill groups, it

 ::>***MILITARY SKILLS*************************

 ::>Archery (C) [I do not think this should be a default skill]
 ::> -Bow
 ::> -Crossbow
 ::> -Sling
 ::> -Atlatl

 I have no idea of what an atlatl is, but Crossbow is probably more
 akin to your Ranged Weapon than to the others listed here.  And
 bow (as in conventional, not cross) is far different from sling.
 Toss this group, or convert it to Archaic Weapons (Group,
 level-nil) and add cudgel/mace/axe/hammer, blade, and polearm.  If
 you go with the latter, copy Crossbow into the Ranged Weapon
 group.

 ::>Blade (C)
 ::> -Short Blade (D): knives, daggers, blades...
 ::> -Long Blade (D) : swords, cutlass, broadsword...
 ::> -2 Hand Blade (D): bastard sword, 2 handed sword...

 Keep this as a cascade, but make it a choice off the Archaic
 Weapons group.  Bastard Sword should be in both Long and 2-Hand.

 ::>Cudgel (C)
 ::> -Short Club (D) : billy club, bo stick, bottle...
 ::> -Long Club (D) : baseball bat, treebranch...
 ::> -Staff (D) : staff, pole, broomhandle...

 I\'d make Hammer/Mace part of this cluster, possibly as additional
 weapons in Long.  I\'m not sure where to put Axe.

 ::>Environment Combat (C)
 ::> -Low gravity
 ::> -High gravity
 ::> -Jungle
 ::> -Desert
 ::> etc. etc.

 Definitely etc.  Including Urban.

 ::>Hammer/Axe/Mace (C) [Can anyone think up a better term for this?]
 ::> -Short HAM (D) : ballpeen hammer, hatchet...
 ::> -Long HAM (D) : warhammer, mace...
 ::> -2 Hand HAM (D): battleaxe, woodaxe, 2H mace....

 See above, Cudgel.

 ::>Laser Weapon (C)
 ::> -Pistol (DH)
 ::> -Rifle (DH)

 Carbine?

 ::>Melee Weapon (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)
 ::> -Blade (C)
 ::> -Cudgel (C)
 ::> -Hammer/Axe/Mace (C)
 ::> -Throw

 Aha!  Here\'s where Sling should be - part of Throw, which I would
 assert should include rocks, spears, etc.

 ::>Ranged Weapon (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)
 ::> -Slug Weapon (C)
 ::> -Laser Weapon (C)
 ::> -Energy Weapons
 ::> -Heavy Weapon (C)
 ::> -Sonic Weapon (C)

 Crossbow, here.  As well in Archaic.

 ::>Slug Weapon (C)  [Each includes tranq, googun, and tangler equivalents.]
 ::> -Pistol (DM) (DH)
 ::> -Rifle (DM) (DH)
 ::> -Shotgun (DM) (DH)
 ::> -SMG  [I don\'t think any autoweapons should be default]
 ::> -Autorifle [includes gauss weapons at TL 9+]

 Carbine?

 ::>Unarmed Combat (D)
 ::>[I don\'t like the idea of distinguishing Brawling and Martial Arts.  Yes
 ::>they are different, but they aim to achieve the same goal and have the
 ::>same results. I would lump both into this skill.]

 Yes, and no.  I\'ve heard it asserted that Brawling-equivalent
 skills are for beating the stuffing out of the opponent, relying
 on overpowering force.  Martial arts are for using the opponent\'s
 skill against him.

 The eight-year-old isn\'t going to have a prayer against the
 professional boxer in straight brawling-equivalent, but if the 8yo
 can get the leverage (not impossible), he _can_ discourage the
 boxer.  Separate \'em out, but use selection of a specific
 martial-arts style strictly as a "color" item.

 Brawling-equivalent is a STR/END skill.  Martial Arts is a DEX
 skill.



 ::>***ACADEMIC SKILLS***********************

 ::>Research (D)

 No, not a default.  Some people never manage to learn how to use
 the card catalog.

 ::>Instruction
 ::>[Not default, I teach and it took a while to learn.  Most people are

 No, I\'ll agree with you on this one.

 ::>Science (G)

 ::>high TLs.
 ::> -Botany  :
 ::> -Chemistry :
 ::> -Geology :

 The current English term in vogue is "Planetary Science".
 Planetology would also be acceptable, being an equivalent
 construction entirely from Greek roots (planetes, wanderer +
 logos, study), as geology is (geos, earth + logos, study).

 ::> -Physics
 ::> -Psionicology [Or is this more of a scholarly pursuit?]
 ::> -Psychology, experimental
 ::>[The "harder" side of psych, neurobiology/chemistry, artificial
 ::>intelligence, and so on]
 ::> -Zoology :

 I\'d add "Library Science" to this - the skill of being able to
 organize knowledge and direct the research of others.

 Also, what\'s the justification for separating Science and Scholar?

 that\'s how most bribery arrests are made!

 Persuasion.  Covers it, plus "legitimate" discourse as well.

 ::>Forensics

 ::>Gambling (D)

 Default only if it includes _playing_, but not _organizing/operating_.
 If it refers to running illicit games, not default.

 No, keep Intrusion and Pickpocket.  See above.

 On that basis, BlackMarket could be covered by Trader/Broker and
 Streetwise.  Certainly, police-type investigations encompass all
 of these - but there\'s an element of organizing the knowledge

 combo.  Keep Investigation.

 At low tech levels and low population densities, it probably

 From knowing several people who fly (as pilots), I\'d be inclined
 to advise you to substitute "Fixed-Wing Single-Engine" and
 "Fixed-Wing Multiple-Engine" for "Prop" and "Jet".  Especially
 since at the high-end Cessna/Piper, you\'re getting a lot of
 overlap in both technique and performance with low-end Lear.

 ::>Communications (DM) (DH)

 Is this "using a telephone/walkie-talkie" or "using a ham radio
 setup"?  If the latter, not a default.  It\'s also possible that
 we\'re talking "communication" as a set of techniques for effective
 delivery of information, regardless of method, in which case it
 becomes a "science" or a "scholar", and not a default.

 ::>Computer (C)
 ::> -Programming
 ::> -Repair
 ::> -Hacking
 ::> -Applications (DH)

 If by "hacking" you mean breaking into computers, no.  That\'s
 called "cracking" or "being a vandal".  Unless you\'re being
 paid to do it to test the computer security of the company that\'s
 paying you, in which case it\'s "tiger teaming", a specific
 activity that true hackers can engage in with no loss of face.
 Any other legitimate meaning of "hacking" in connection with
 computers is strictly covered by programming - and even crackers
 have to have some knowledge of programming.  For that task, go
 with Programming skill, DM+Intrusion skill or some fraction
 thereof.

 I harp on the distinction between "hacking" and "cracking"
 because (a) many "hackers" (my sense) get offended when you lump
 "crackers" in with us, and (b) there\'s a non-trivial amount of
 overlap between the hacker (both senses) community and the RPG
 community.  Crackers frequently call themselves "hackers" to try
 to share in the true glory of the name, which some of them might
 even understand; all they succeed in doing is contaminating the
 name in the eyes of the public.

 Computer.  While a computer designer must be able to program, not
 every programmer can design a computer - not even a virtual
 machine.  Allow Computer Design skill for tasks that require
 programming skill, but not \\vice-versa\\.

 ::>Prospecting [Or is this just a combination of Sensor Ops and Geology?]

 No, keep separate.  Sensor Ops may not tell you everything you
 need to know.  You may also need tools and techniques not
 available to the planetographer.  This would be a skill that a
 "Belter" has - and "Belter" is an occupation, not a skill.

 "diplomatic".

 No, not a default.  Only a minority ever learn even First Aid

 ::>***MERCANTILE SKILLS************************
 ::>[I\'d like formal definitions of the skills below, I\'m not sure what they

 ::>Administration

 Probably should be a "Professional" skill; it\'s needed even in
 non-mercantile contexts.  I read it as being the ability to manage
 an organization and the information needed to make that
 organization function effectively.

 ::>Bargain

 The ability to manipulate the perceived value of one side of an
 exchange relative to the other, through non-coercive techniques.
 Could legitimately be a specific application of "Persuasion".

 ::>Broker

 The ability to act for another in trade.  Includes knowing what a
 fair price is, and being willing to buy and sell using your own
 funds at that fair price to close a transaction.  (i.e., if the
 fair price for the load of foodstuffs you brought in is 6000
 Cr/Tonne, but nobody is offering more than 5300, the broker should
 be able to buy from you at 5700, and hold on to it until the local
 price rises enough for him to sell at a profit.  Similarly, that
 same broker will stock up on merchandise when the price is low,
 and sell to you below the prevailing price, but still at a profit,
 if the prevailing price is unacceptably high.  In this way, he
 influences the market (smoothing out the long-term graph) in
 proportion to his holdings and capital.)

 ::>Steward (D) [where does this go? Professional Skills? Other Skills?]

 I see this as a "Professional" skill - it is the skills necessary
 for personal service (in the sense of servants in a filthy-rich
 person\'s mansion - butler, maid, bath girl/boy, hair stylist,
 manicurist, social calendar arranger, and so on).  It also
 encompasses certain aspects of Customer Service (i.e., handling
 multiple people, arranging personal services, dealing with
 complaints, etc.)

 ::>Trader

 Knowledge of what goods are generally available or generally in
 demand in which locations, and what quality of brokerage service
 is available.

 There\'s been some discussion of this.  Languages learned as you
 did should _not_ count against skills, but any learned after
 starting career resolution _should_ count against skills.  I also
 lean toward classification of language groups, with (say)
 Spanish-3 giving Portuguese-2 and Italian-0.5 and such.

 ::>Perception (D) [I don\'t like the idea of a seperate Observation skill.
 ::>The argument was good, and I too am a good observer but bad perceiver,

 No, I buy the argument.  Perception is _not_ observation, and if
 you ever study police work from the inside, you\'ll see just how
 different they are.

 No, Reconnaissance is perfectly OK.

In my opinion this is an honest mistake that CT\'s designers made. By
far the worst offense was in computers but that was understandable
because in 1983 a cheap and powerful computer was a Digital PDP-11 and
the model of computing was time-sharing one powerful CPU. CT assumed a
linear evolution of computers along this model e.g. a more powerful
single CPU system, CT didn\'t anticipate the paradigm shift to a cheap
processor on every desk and communications in between model that we
have today. In 1977 the PC was little more than a toy with no
applications to take it from hobbiest circles that it occupied so who
could have guessed that in 1983 IBM would take the hobbiest toy and
turn it into a business toy sparking the entire microprocessor
industry. 

I do hope that the starships of T4 take advantage of cheap local
microprocessor controlled technology and networks much as cars and
racing sailboats do today. But I cannot blame them for not seeing this 
technology in 1977.

I\'m not sure whether I have or not but I think that my players
knew that part of my job as GM was to keep the players motivated
towards finding "the prize." If it seemed like they weren\'t
getting anywhere for a long time they understood that they would
eventually get a helpful hint from the ref along the way. I
started my favorite Traveller campaign in 1983 with the
"Twilight\'s Peak" adventure. At this time they were able to cheat
just by walking six blocks to hobby store and flipping through the
adventure themselves. This is going to be the problem with any
canned adventure or "for Referee\'s only" text.

In fact I\'m fairly certain that if a player got out of hand 
enough to cheat I know that some of my players would have found a 
way to "fix the problem" themselves (probably by killing the 
character in question). This was a much bigger threat than I 
could ever bring to bear.

Just a thought, but why would there be ANY data in the databanks.  
You\'d think just about all data except the fact that there is a star 
in such and such an area would be lost after 1700 years.  I doubt 
that Sylea & surrounds would have data of any kind other than 
positions, and class of stars for worlds in for example the Vland sector.  
I\'ve always viewed the rise of Sylea as kind of an intergalactic 
Renaissance coming out of the Dark Ages.  If this is a valid model 
(maybe it\'s not), then its doubtful Sylea is going to know much of 
anything about a lot of worlds...even obsolete information, and the 
pocket empires on the fringes are going to know even less.

Thoughts?

True.  Players in RPG\'s tend to have a rather direct way of dealing

Sounds interesting, I may have to pick up that copy at my local library.  I

This is the problem with all sci-fi games\\tv shows.  Look at Star Trek.  The
original series Star Trek communicators that were supposed to be the best
the 23rd century had to offer are now large compared to the portable phones
of today (they now have ones you can actually wear!).  

Computers, however, I find by far the hardest thing to keep up to date with.
When Traveller was released, computers low-power, and not much good at doing
anything.  However, nowadays, computers advance at an extraodinary pace (The
486DX4\\66 I bought 18 months ago is now completely out of date, as is a
double-speed CD-ROM), and it is hard for science ficition to keep up.  I
mean, within a few years, human civilization has jumped a tech level on the
electronics side of things definietely.  

Actually, that gives me an idea.  Here, are using CT tech levels, my opinion
of our current levels.

Personal Weaponry: 7
Armour: 8
Heavy: 6-7
Computers:  (not sure on this one)
Communications: 6 (though I think 7 or 8 would be Internet)
Water Transport: 7
Land Transport:  7
Air Transport:  7
Space Transport:  7
Energy:  6 (capability for 7, but it\'s not widely used)

Avergae Technological Level for Earth:  7

This seems to be a logical model, a Renaissance, with a culture rising
from it that is remarkably similar to 18th century Terra.

Sure!  :)  I consider the Traveller tech levels to be a set of numerical 
representations of levels at which various technologies are achieved /on 
average/.  I ignore the earth-year equivalents given in the last column 
on the chart, and just consider the various tech levels to be 
independent of eachothr.  That is, Earth happens to have advanced in 
computer technology faster than the "average" world which has achieved 
tech level 8.  

Each culture is going to have its own mix of technologies, depending on 
where their emphasis lies.  The United States has had, for a number of 
decades, an emphasis on military technology, for instance.  A less 
warlike culture might be at tech level 8 for medical technology 
purposes, for instance, while remaining at tech level 5 in military 
weapons.  

Sure, the CT tech level chart needs some minor fixes, but it\'s not as bad 
as it might, at first, appear.

The asteroid belt contains significant quantities of antimatter, presumably

With consistent formating and a set of well defined abbreviations the
same info could be presented in just a few more lines.  We aren\'t talking
about loosing a "ton" on non-technical info.  The savings in space
just aren\'t _that_ dramatic.

I guess, in the end, Imperial Games is going to have to decide if they
want give things in a way that is a bit better for long time players
while risking turning off new players who might be interested in the
game.

With respect, no. What I\'m saying is that theological literacy and
`religious knowledge\' are a function of education and (maybe)
intelligence. The applicable, transferable skills gained from the practice
of religion are something else -- Fast Talk, Persuasion, Admin,
Streetwise, Psychology, even Science (in a technocratic religion) or
Forgery/Bribery (in a mercantile one, like that of Nedra in the Belgariad).
Rob Prior\'s complaint that people don\'t really take the 
intellectual side of things seriously -- or can\'t -- is something I would 
translate into game terms as: many people who profess a faith are in fact 
`only\' part of a culture. If the game is going to have Religion skill, you 
ought to have Vilani skill, 46 different Vargr skills... not entirely a 
facetious idea, incidentally.

Now, while I\'m sure I\'d rate at least Religion-1 (Christian), that is a
function of being relatively intelligent and over-educated; my ability to
debate things religious is a function of scientific training, background
knowledge etc.. In other words, religion is part of my educational
development and inseperable from it. This is why I\'d make PCs committed to
a religion make the occasional roll vs. Education, rather than inventing
another skill, or I\'d just invent the occasional task. (Maybe there should
be some suggestions about `rolls for casual knowledge\' e.g. they are
usually Difficult, Edu -- or Routine, Edu, Computer with the aid of a
suitable database -- and 1 difficulty lower if the character is
particularly knowledgeable, e.g. an ex-Navy officer on naval history.)

To go back to our Traveller example, if I were really well-informed about 
Christianity (debatable) then I wouldn\'t rate History or Sociology skill 
- -- it\'d be historical or sociological (or theological) `facts\' I knew.
If I were a trained theologian (I\'m not), I would probably have History or 
Sociology skill, because those would be *transferable* skills, methods of 
working and understanding concepts that can be used in other fields, 
wherever they were gained.

I don\'t see why it shouldn\'t *be* History, a/a. The area of knowledge is 
religion, but the set of skills applied to that area are History and 
Sociology (say). Religion here is not a skill but a subject of skill.

I think that that is the point.  Your archiologist\'s skill is nothing BUT
history.  Not being motivated by faith, service, or any need to  support the
"Sect of the Tea Set", he is just an historian.  The Religion skill, IMHO,
should apply to those skills not otherwise covered by other skills required
to actualy BE a priest.  An expert in helenistic religions might be
History-4.  A priest of Athena would be Religion (Helenistic) -4 .  I would
use it more (in an adventure context) as a more limitted form of Leadership
or Persuasion.

I totally agree with you. Isn\'t IG, however, going to package MMT as a
single book, either hardcover or softcover? I\'d much prefer a boxed set,
with a "players" manual, that would cover character generation,
resolution of personal combat, etc., and a "referee\'s" manual that would
cover the rest, including at least one chapter with background info on the
Traveller universe for newcomers. I believe this is the way the original
Traveller:2300 was packaged, and (IMHO) was the only good thing about
that game :-)

I think it\'s up to you to come up with your own character\'s history, and
either case could apply. The character could have a religion skill because
he or she is highly interested in the topic or is a religious person, or he or
she could have the skill because the character\'s parents forced the
character to go to a religious school for the first 18 years of the
character\'s life.

In either case, the religion skill would be warranted, and could be of use
in several situations (like being on a world with a Theocratic government,
perhaps).

*Definitely* agree, as that\'s how the FAA and the International
equivalent do it too. Multi-engine is a *much* different skill than
single engine, but Jet/prop isn\'t near as much difference.

One thing though. "Test Pilot" ought to be in there somewhere. It\'s a
lot different than ordinary piloting.

And Aeroponics. There really is such a thing, and it\'s much better
suited to zero-g than hydroponics. Better suited for shipboard too, due
to the reduced mass.

I agree with Marc Miller\'s decision to *seperate* "first Aid" (up thru
EMT) and Medicine. I\'ve had fairly extensive first aid training, and I
know some folks with EMT, Nursing and medical training. Medical and
"first aid" *do* belong seperate. The skills are *not* the same. In
fact, many doctors who aren\'t trained in emergency medicine aren\'t any
better than First Aid 1! Likewise, an EMT\'s training is very
specialized. 

I *would* say that Medical skill can be *used* as First Aid 1. And
*maybe* First Aid can be used as Medical 1. And Medical skill should
include "Nursing" (start with it in fact)

As for First Aid being a default, remember, this is for *characters*.
They *should* get a "no penalty" (but no bonus either) to try to do
first aid.

He\'d not understand the electrical system. But given that compressed
air (from bellows) was used to operate some types of "toys" for nobles,
and that gunpowder was in use, he\'d be able to figure out a lot more
than you might think. The carbeurator works on principles he\'d known.
Ditto for the valves, crankshafts etc. 

So as long as the ignition and timing were ok, he could figure out
anything else. :-)

Space suits can be built with WWI (or possibly even Civil War)
technology. Other than that, I agree.

An atlatl (aka woomera aka throwing stick) is a long stick with a
"hook" sticking out near the end. The "hook" fits into a notch on the
end of a spear. 

 /==================>    <-spear
/======================  <-atlatl

You grasp the end that\'s near the spear head and use it to throw the
spear. What it does is effectibely make your arm longer, thus *greatly*
increasing the lever arm. This makes the spear go faster and hit harder.
It makes a *big* difference and was invented independently at least 3
times.

Personally, I\'d go with a "thrown missile" skill that broke down into
chunks like this:

rock/grenade/etc
spear
  Atlatl
bow/crossbow
sling
  staff sling (a staff with a sling on the end)
special (boomerang, shuriken, knives, etc)

BTW slings and staff slings were used until fairly late in the middle
ages and *revived* for a while around WWI for throwing grenades
farther. The rifle grenade and RPG ended this. But it\'s still something
"hi tech" a character could do with a "lo tech" skill!

Crossbows don\'t out range bows. They are just easier to use.

hammer/mace do *not* work like cudgels, or staffs, due to the weight
being concentrated at the end. And it makes a difference wether it\'s a
one hand (short) weapon, a two hand (longer) or a pole arm (yes, they
mace pole arm maces!)

Axes probably go in a similar progression from one-hand thru poleaxe.
BTW, someone who can use an axe can use a mace at about the same skill
level. But going the other way doesn\'t work as well (it matters more
which way the axehead is oriented).

But for simplicity you could probably combine the axe/mace/hammer
sequences. 

(In case you hadn\'t guessed I\'m in the SCA :-)

Trust me, after five years of studying in university and a BA to back me up
there\'s a lot more to archaeology than history and religion.  Remember, 99%
of humanities development occured before the advent of writing or religion.
This puts it into the relm of behavioural science, interpolation and just
plain guess work.  There\'s more to being an archaeologist than picking up a
book and saying, I\'m an archaeologist.  Did you know one of the courses I
took included how to hot wire a car?  True story, you\'re in the middle of no
where and some goober loses the key\'s what are you going to do?  Don\'t buy a
car with a locking stearing wheel that\'s for sure.

Okay, I think I see the difference.  I\'m using Religion to talk about
theological studies, while you\'re talking about using Religion as
practicing and participating in a religion.  That\'s my mistake,
as has been pointed out "Theology" would probably have been a better
term to use.

It could be History, but then again, it could also be Theology.  It
should apply to more than just History, but it would be more limited
in scope.  It could be like Xenobiology.  While you could break that
down to Biology, Liason (bedside manner), First Aid, etc...,
Xenobiology infers other nuances.  Theology could be viewed in much
the same manner.

	If you don\'t have a religion skill, what are you going to tell all
those people who are taking Religious Studies and Theology courses?  That
what they\'re learning is really just general knowledge (based on INT/EDU),
or that they should be in the History or Sociology departments?  Theology,
like many other skills in Traveller, is an area of knowledge.  One\'s faith
does not necessarily come into it.  One does not really gain any skills
from being a member of a certain faith (at least no more than one gets
from being part of a certain culture, and we can\'t have a skill for each
one of those).  But one does gain special and extensive knowledge from
studying Theology, which is an area of research much like sociology,
history and anthropology, but which has its own domain. 

	A preist might have skills like Orate, Liaison and so on, but
these are not "Theology".  Theology is an area of study with its own
particular emphasis.  It is not history, nor anthroplogy, but a field on
its own.  One can debate the "usefulness" of this skill, but one can do so
with many others.  I think Theology definately has a place in Traveller.

        Absolutely.  The Sylean\'s knowledge of former Imperial Space, and
that\'s a lot of space, would be limited to what was known at the height of
the Second Imperium/Rule of Man, some Fifteen Centuries before hand.  Now
assuming that their original data bases have remained intact for 1500 years,
a fact which in the first place may well be something of a streatch there\'s
a awful lot that can happen in 1500 years, not to mention language drift,
culture change and warfare, lets face it the Vargr and Aslan weren\'t just
sitting around at this time looking across the borders thinking "Oh those
poor humans.  Let\'s give them a bit of a breather for now and turn our
attentions elsewhere."  Pardon me but if I was a Vargr captian or an Aslan
Iheati I think the first thing in my mind would be, "Power Vacuum and well
developed worlds ripe for the taking.  Yee Haww!  Saddle up the ponies tex
we\'re gonna have us a good time tonight."

        Returning to the areas that were Imperial at that time would be a
lot like returning to the Wilds in TNE.  No one knows just what the hell is
out there but expect wierdness and lots of it.  The only advantage the
Sylean\'s have over the RC is they didn\'t have their tecnoligical base
stripped completely away and they don\'t have to worry about Vampire Fleets.
Of course they do have to worry about canibalisic natives, pirates,
marauders, evil dictators, and some kind of odd wobbly thing that\'s made the
entire spinward marches disappear.

        Imagine the knowledge that\'s been lost.  Look at how much the
Greeks, Roman\'s and Egyptians knew three thousand years ago and compare it
to how much we didn\'t know one thousand years ago.  We lost a lot of
information in a very short time, and generally speaking we were just to
damn close minded for 500 years to even imaging that their might have been
other possiblities.  Of course when the church told you, you were going to
hell if you though up something new it kind of put the kibosh on any great
thinking.  "Go to hell -- remain ignorant -- go to hell . . . I think I\'ll
remain ignorant."

        Though few people are going to admit it T4 is just TNE set in an era
where the collapse hasn\'t been as all encompassing and total.  I think I
might like this after all.  "High didalee dee a pirates life for me."  My
question is how will tasks be resolved?

At least the background info for each mililieu is seperate from the

agree with you.  :-)

As someone who probably qualifies as a long time player, I think
the problem with TNE was the dumb background (this was it for
me) or people just prefering the old rules.  You can always
just stick a profile at the end of the planet/character/etc.

and want to keep them.

    'body' => '	Hi all.  Sorry if this topic bores some of you, but it fascinates 
me.  I think it is very important for an RPG to have a proper skills 
list.  For those of you who are less interested, I\'ve tried to minimize 
the length of this message.  I\'d consider moving this to the GDW-Beta 
list, except that I think it would get lost in the FF&S flood.  For those 
of you who are interested and wish to give me a point-by-point or 
otherwise lengthy reply, please respond to me directly so others don\'t 
have to pore through the long messages.  If you made a suggestion before 
and isn\'t implemented here, it doesn\'t necessarily mean I disagree with 
you, it may mean I simply forgot, so suggest it again if you think it\'s 
important.

	Below is "Mark III" of my skill list.  Again revised based on 
comments by various people.  Main points include:

o	The social sciences have been included in the form of Economics 
	and Political Science skills.
o	Geology is still included, but is now called Planetology to make 
	it more "universal".
o	Theology is still included as an area of study.  I consider this 
	to be nothing more controversial than the inclusion of sociology or 
	anthropology, and (IMO) it is not replaceable by any other social
	science as it is a discipline all its own.
o	The "Scholar" vs. "Science" distinction has been eliminated.  Not 
	sure how it would be implemented in the game anyway...
o	Weapon skills have been re-organized in line with several comments.

o	Default skills have been eliminated for the time being.  I now 
realize that default skills are a product of one\'s profession, culture 
and homeworld characteristics.  Instead of trying to take all this into 
account in a skills table, I feel default skills should be part of 
"background packages" or lists of automatic skills given based on career 
choice (e.g., Army characters get Rifle-0, Navy get Vacc-0).  I\'ve heard 
that such background packages will be part of MMT, and automatic skill 
have always been part of it, so I think this would be a better way to 
handle things.

o	Cascade skills have been revised.  I have not cascaded all the 
skills that I feel should be subdivided.  This is for two reasons: 1) It 
makes for too many skills, 2) It makes skills less likely to be useful.  
For instance, a character is not likely to be able to use his "Farming" 
skill often in adventuring.  This becomes even more unlikely if one 
subdivides it (even though there are good arguments for doing so in terms 
of realism).


SKILLS BY TECH LEVEL:  I think skills should be understood to be mediated 
by the character\'s native TL.  Someone from a TL-5 world might have 
mechanic skill, but he won\'t be able to repair starship turrets (At least 
not  easily.  I\'d say give a -DM equal to the TL difference).  
Differences in tech level which are too great should preclude any attempt 
at using the skill, at the GM\'s discretion.

SKILLS BY CULTURE/SPECIES:  Skills should also be mediated by the culture 
in which they are learned.  Someone learning medicine in the Sylean 
Federation will not likely be able to use their skills as effectively on 
other species.  Negative DMs would be given for alien surroundings (the 
more alien, the worse the DM).


SKILL GROUPINGS:  Skills are again divided into categories simply for 
organization.  The following sub-groupings are also used:
	(C) Cascade: represents a package of specializations in a 
particular field.  Pick one of them and all others are at 1/2 level.
	(G) Group:  represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of 
them but get level-nil in all others (or level-0 at GM\'s discretion). 
Sometimes, the group will contain cascade skills.
	(RPG) Roleplay it Gomer!:  This notation is a reminder that this 
skill should not replace roleplaying, but add to or enhance it.  Of 
course, this sort of applies to all of them :-).


***WEAPON SKILLS*************************

Archaic Ranged Weapons (G)
	Bow
	Crossbow
	Sling
	Spear Thrower [was Atlatl]	

Artillery 
Gunnery
Heavy Weapons (C): Grenade Launcher, Mortar, Braced Gun, 
Shoulder Rocket.
[Any cascades missing here?  I ain\'t no military type, so please fill me in.]

Melee Weapons (G)
	Axe (C)		: hatchet, axe.
	Blade (C)	: short blade, long blade, two-handed blade.
	Club (C)	: short club, long club 
	[includes hammers and maces].	
	Flail (C)	: light [chain/whip], heavy [flail, morning star].
	Polearm (C)	: light [staff, spear], heavy [pikes, halberds]
[And don\'t forget: glaive-guisarmes, bec-de-corbins, lucern 
hammers...AAARGH! :-)].

Ranged Weapons (G)
	Energy Weapons 		: [no cascade?  or fusion vs. plasma?]
	Laser Weapons (C)	: pistol, rifle.
	Slug Weapons (C)	: pistol, rifle, SMG, shotgun, autorifle. 	
	Sonic Weapons (C)	: pistol, rifle.
	[Carbine fits under rifle, IMO.]	

Thrown Weapons (C)		: Spear, Rock, Grenade, Short Blade, Boomerang.
[This list of cascades covers all the basic throwing techniques, I think.]

Unarmed Combat
[Still not sure I want seperate martial arts and brawling skills.]


***MILITARY SKILLS*************************

Battledress				
Camouflage
Combat Engineer 			
Demolitions

Environment Combat (G):  
	Low gravity 
	High gravity

Instruction				Research
Archeology				Astrography
Astronomy 				Biology 
Botany					Chemistry

	Notes:
	[IMO Research more-or-less covers Library Science.  Everyone 
who\'s in a field feels that the field should be further subdivided.  I 
has psych as two skill because of this.  It is now just one.]
	[In an interstellar community, Biology is indistinguishable from 
Xenobiology, IMHO.  Just as we study biology over the entire world (and 
not just our own city/country), far future biologists would study biology 
in other ecospheres.  For some lo-tech NPC\'s this skill would be mediated 
by TL and culture, as noted in the intro above.]
	[Astronomy is the science of stellar processes and physics.  
Astrography is like geography, but applies to interstellar nations and 
cultures.]

	[Players may create other members of this group.]

Electronics 
Engineer  
[This refers to running/ repairing starships as opposed to designing them.]
Farming  
[Realistically, should have cascades, but will be little used as is, IMHO.]
Gravitics
Mechanics

Navigation 
	[Refers to spacecraft in jump space. Pilot covers navigation in real 
space. Orienteering covers navigation on planet surfaces.]

Pilot 
	[Refers to spacecraft (of any size) maneuvering/navigating in real
space.  Ship\'s boat is eliminated and/or covered by Grav Craft]

Prospecting

Sensor Operations

Vehicle (G) 
	Aircraft (G)		: Jet, Prop, Helicopter, Lighter-Than-Air.
	Animal (C)		: Choose an animal.  
	[All others at 1/2 skill, so this isn\'t over-specialized, IMO]
	Grav Vehicle (C)	: GravBelt, GravCycle, Air-raft, 
				  GravTank, Spacecraft.
	[Spacecraft refers to any ship (big or small) when using antigrav.]

sure this is not simply a consequence of how we train people on earth?  
For instance, no one learns to fly a copter on earth without learning to 
fly a plane first, but that doesn\'t mean it couldn\'t happen elsewhere. 
Just wondering...]

	Swimming
	Climbing/Moutaineering
	Sport (G)(Choose one).

Carousing (RPG)	
Jack-of-all-Trades
Language (G)(Choose one)
Orienteering

Persuasion (C) (RPG)	: Oration, Intimidation, Fast Talk, Conversation.
Reconnaissance
Survey

I have not included Skill Clusters such as those used in MT (e.g., the 
Space Cluster has Pilot, Nav, Engineer, Gunner, etc.).  I felt these were 
sort of redundant for the purposes of a skill list, though I would like 
to see them in CharGen for MMT.

That\'s it.  Once again, apologies to the uninterested.  As always, I 
welcome all inputs.

Happy Travelling,
Charles.

****************************
Religious Scholar


Re-enlistment:  If the character has Admin skill they may use it as a
positive DM when attempting
to re-enlist.  A roll of 2 always means force retirement.  There is no
mandatory re-enlistment on a
roll of 12.

Skill eligibility:  During the first term of service the character is
eligible for two skills.  Each term
after that they are eligible for only one skill.  The character is also
eligible for one skill with each
distinction earned.

* Language Skill:  While not official canon it has been used in some of the
Alien modules.  The  *
religious Scholar would no doubt learn to read some long dead language to
help further their 
* studies.

Distinctions:  A character is eligible for only one distinction per term of
service.

Automatic skills:   Upon enlistment Language - 1.  Upon receiving first
distinction Admin - 1.

Mustering Out:  One benefit roll is allowed per term of service.  characters
who have received one
distinction are allowed one additional roll.  Characters who have received
two distinctions are
allowed two additional rolls.  Characters who have received three or more
distinctions are
allowed three additional rolls.  A maximum of three rolls are allowed on the
cash benefits table; all
additional rolls must be taken on the material benefits table.  Characters
who have served five or
more terms may add 1 to their rolls on the cash benefits table.  Characters
who have received two
or more distinctions may add 1 to their rolls on the material benefits table.

****************************

Religious Scholar Example:

**Hodgie, having finished school, decides that studying the long dead
Thistian religion would be
a grand way to spend his life.  Taking stock of himself [ player rolls 7, C,
7, 3, A, 9 ] he finds his
UPS is 7C73A9.  Not to bad.  He visits his home planets university and
attempts to gain
admission to the school of theology.  [ Player rolls a 6 (dm +2 for Educ +8)
giving an 8 ]  Hodgie
manages to pass the schools entrance exam.

**First Term:  His first term of service is rather uneventful.  [ For
survival player rolls a 9 (dm + 2
for Social Standing 8+) giving an 11]  But Hodgie has not yet distinguished
himself in his
published findings.  [ For distinction player rolls a 4 ]  The good news is
that Hodgie is able to
continue his studies for another year.  [ For re-enlistment player rolls a 7
].  Hodgie is eligible for
two skills this term plus automatically receives one level of Language
skill.  [ The GM tells the
player that the Language-1 skill is in Lagian, the Thistians long dead
language]  Working as a
scholar provides few physical challenges so to keep fit Hodgie takes up
martial arts as a hobby.  
[ Player rolls a 5 on skill table 2 \'Brawling\' (The GM takes note of this
and later creates an NPC
for Hodgies marital arts instructor!) ]  

Hodgies work also requires long sessions on the computer analyzing cryptic
ancient writings.  
[ Player rolls a 1 on table 3 \'Computer\' (GM takes note of this and later
details where these
ancient writings came from and how the university got a hold of them!) ]

** Second Term:  During his second four years of study, while in the field
looking for more of
those ancient writings, Hodgie has a very close call.  [ For survival player
rolls a 3 (dm +2 for
Social Standing 8+) giving a 5 (GM takes note of this and determines which
planet Hodgie was
on! ) ] 

Obviously the close call was worth it because Hodgie earned the distinction
of his peers!  
[ For distinction player rolls a 10 (dm +1 for one previous term) giving an
11 (GM takes note of
this and later determines that Hodgie uncovered the fabled long lost Spear
of the first Thistain
Saint!) ].     

Hodgie is eligible for two skills this term plus receives an automatic skill
level in Admin.  

His discovery of the long lost Thistian Spear has attracted the attention of
a powerful Noble, who
sponsors Hodgie for an increase in Social Standing.  [ Player rolls a 6 on
table 4 \'+1 Social
Standing\'  (GM selects or creates the Noble and develops suitable
background.  Hodgie now has
at lest one powerful friend!) ]

Now that Hodgie has been with the school of theology for several years he
has been asked to take
on a student and teach her the ropes.  [ Player rolls a 2 on table 4
\'Instruction\'  (GM creates an
NPC student for Hodgie and save her for later use!) ]  

Also because of his distinction Hodgie now finds it easier to get grant
money for further studies,
but learning to deal with the applications is a pain!  [ Automatic skill
level in \'Admin\' (GM creates
several companies and governments willing to fund studies into the Thistian
religion!) ]

With everything looking up for Hodgie bad news is hard to take!  [ For
re-enlistment player rolls a
2 \'Forced retirement!\' (GM takes note of this and secretly determines that a
mysterious rival had
gotten Hodgie kicked out by blackmailing the head of the theology school! ) ]

**Mustering out:  Hodgie is eligible for 3 mustering out benefits.  [
Players makes all three on the
Material Benefits table.  The three rolls are 4, 5 and 5 \'Mid passage\' and
\'Weapon\' twice.  Player
selects a revolver and then takes a skill in revolver ]

**Recap:  Hodgie is now 26 years old.  His UPS is 7C73AA and he  has the
following skills:  
Language - 1 (In Lagian), Instruction - 1, Admin -1, Brawling -1, Computer
- -1 and Revolver -1.
His only possessions are a revolver and a middle passage.  He spent eight
years studying the
ancient Thistain religion and recently made an import discovery in his
field.  For which he was
rewarded with social advancement.

He has three NPC contacts, his martial arts instructor, a powerful noble and
his former student. 
But he also has a rival who is black mailing the head of his former theology
school.  

Also, Hodgie knows of several companies that might be willing to provide
private funding for
more research, if he can make his case to them.

IMO details and background are what make for an interesting charator, not
pages of little used (or
understood) skills!

The problem with using negative DMs comes when the character starts 
improving the skill in a different cultural environment.  This is why I 
use the "Xenoqualifiers" system I posted a while back.  Imperial and 
Aslan Streetwise, for example, are two different skills.

This is interesting.  Rather than creating a new skill, Theology, or 
somesuch, you have broken it down into the sub-skills involved in the 
pursuit of a career in theology.  Things like languages, computer use, 
admin, instruction, and survial are certainly useful to the theologian.  

Hmmm.  This means that the knowledge of theology is implied rather than 
explicit as far as skills are concerned.  I\'m trying to think of where 
this would be a disadvantage...hmm....okay, let\'s say Hodgie, in the 
course of his adventuring career, meets up with a group of people who 
have been without outside contact for so long that they actually practice 
the supposedly dead religion he has been studying.  However, through the 
years the religion has evolved a bit, so isn\'t exactly like the religion 
he knows.  Perhaps the ref would want the player to make a task roll to 
determine whether he recognizes the religion as the one he has been 
studying, modified by centuries of use.  This would require a skill level 
to be used as a DM. Hmmm.

Dunno, doesn\'t sound like a really good example to me.  Perhaps someone 
else can come up with a more compelling reason to make theology an 
explicit skill.  But, until then, your method seems workable to me.

[Character generation tables snipped]

> Religious Scholar Example:

This is a really good example.  I never worried about NPCs that might 
logically come out of the character generation process until I started 
playing the Hero system, with its emphasis on dependant NPCs, Hunteds, 
etc.  After that, it just made sense to include them in Traveller as 
well. I\'m glad I\'m not the only one!

BTW, this would be a great addition to the Merchant Captain Alexander 
Jamison character creation example (or whatever is included in T4): 
noting where a referee might, if s/he chooses, logically infer NPCs that 
should be generated based on the events in the character generation 
process.  I think it would give beginning referees a great opportunity to 
help players create more life-like characters, and imbue the 
campaign-universe with more realism as well.  When the campaign starts, 
the characters would not just be experienced - they would have at least a 
minor group of friends, enemies, and contacts.  A frame of reference in 
the social order, if you will.

> IMO details and background are what make for an interesting charator, not
> pages of little used (or understood) skills!  

I agree.  While a humongous list of skills makes for a more realistic 
system, there is a point at which additional skills confer little or no 
benefit to the majority of players.  The little black books had too few 
skills, certainly.  But CT as a whole had just about the right amount of 
skills.  

I added a few in my campaigns, but I think that is something each referee 
should be prepared to do as needed.  I see little benefit in IG providing 
referees with an exhaustive skill list, since that means many of those 
skills will never be used by most referees.

Each basic character type should have skills avaiable to him or her which 
provide the /majority/ of skills a character in that profession would 
logically have.  Yes, I believe it is unnecessary to provide for every 
skill every character type could ever possibly use.  There are so very 
many fields of study open to a Scholar character that deliniating them 
all would be preposterous - the list would probably be equal in number to 
all other skills in the system.  And, again, most of those skills would 
go unused in most campaigns.

I remember when AD&D started using the Proficiency and Specialization 
systems.  It added a lot of detail to the game, but it was (IMO) at the 
expense of playability.  In AD&D\'s case, that was just one more step down 
the road of complexity - and it was already well down that road.  I\'d 
really rather not see Traveller follow suit.

The CT system, at the time of the introduction of The Traveller Book, had 
the best approach as far as complexity is concerned.  The Book had 
everything needed in order to play the game - and all systems were quick 
and simple - very playable, and realistic enough.  If a group wanted to 
introduce more complexity and realism into the game, they could buy Books 
4-8, the Supplements, and/or various other expansion modules by GDW and 
the licensees.  

Complexity was completely optional, and the Traveller Book was a 
self-contained role-playing game (that is, there were no systems missing, 
although each system favored playability over realism).  Perfect.

The list of skills that Marc Miller recently posted appeared, to me, to 
provide plenty of skills for the basic book.  As necessary, when 
supplementary material comes out that requires new skills (ie, if a 
Citizens of the Imperium II or whatever comes out), it would make sense 
to expand the skill list.  Beyond that, I see little use for an attempt 
to make the skill system perfectly complete.

Comments welcome!

I think that the explanation is in Adventure 1, The Kinunir.  The Shionthy
system has a lot of "contra-terrene" matter, which I think is anti-matter.
So it\'s very dangerous for ships.  Why it should be crime to put yourself in
danger, I don\'t know.  I\'ve always believed that the contra-terrene asteroid
belt was once a planet, destroyed by weapons beyond our ken during the Final
War, and the goverment doesn\'t want anyone examining the site without its
approval.  Then again, Traveller always brings out the conspiracy theorist
in me.

Thanks Derek, for correcting the first posting.  As an archaeological
graduate, and in terms of Traveller, I\'d have to argue that one of the
Imperium\'s primary archaeological fields would be "Ancients Studies", and
of course for that you\'d have no written history to go on.  I\'d suggest
that advanced "non-destructive site recording" and "artifact
interpretation" would be at the top of the 56th Century\'s archaeological
skills.  Certainly for my own degree, only a third or so was spent on
history (mainly Roman), the rest of the course was primarily concerned with
the techniques and development of archaeological excavation and the
preservation and social interpretation of finds.  Never hot wired any cars
though...    ...is it the same as doing it to an air-raft?

With Jump drive, it it only takes setting up observatories in a couple
of adjacent hexes to get accurate stellar positions out to *thousands*
of hexes. And it only takes a bit more work to get stellar type. 

A few years of observation of stars that are determined to be close
enough to worry about can determine things like presences of gas
giants, and even mainworlds. But the absolute *best* that you\'d be able
to do is determine mass, size, rough atmospheric composition (ie you
can\'t detect taints and could be off by one "density" category), and
very rough hydro (say +/- 30%)

I\'m working on a write-up of this sort of thing that may wind up in the
rule book.

Maybe you can send me a copy of the book? :-)

Anyway, here\'s what I came up with:

                           Navigation

Interplanetary navigation uses principles that date back to the 20th
century (Old Terran). Much like the Global Positioning System (GPS) of
that era, most systems in the Imperium have a number of satellites
scattered widely around the system. Each satellite broadcasts a data
stream consisting of its ID, its position relative to the mainworld,
and a precise atomic clock time.

Onboard a ship, a special receiver unit takes the data from 3 or more
such signals and integrates it to determine the ship\'s position to an
initial accuracy of 100 km or less. by using more signals and 10
minutes or so of listening to them, a ship can get a position to
accuracies of 1 km or better.

A portion of the data from the satellites is encrypted. Ships equipped
with the proper decryption circuit can get the 1 km accuracy
immediately. Such gear is reserved for the Imperial military and it is
a criminal offense to posses it without authorization.

In time of war the entire signal is encrypted, thus forcing non-
miltary users to go back to the methods used in undeveloped systems.
These amount to using the ship\'s radar and/or telescope to locate the
planets and determine the ship\'s position from these sightings with the
aid of an ephemeris for the system. This can take 30 minutes or longer
to get a fix that\'s only good to about 1 light second, unless they are
within a few light seconds of a planet.

This gives the Imperial military a distinct advantage when they jump
from or to a system equipped with SPS (System Positioning System)
satellites.


                         Imperial Survey

The Imperial Survey was established to help map both the existing
territory of the Imperium and the surrounding areas that had been lost
during the long night.

The mapping project started by establishing a pair of observatories in
the outskirts of a pair of systems one parsec apart. The line between
them became the baseline for the Imperial maps. (My maps are in
storage, so I can\'t check this, but it\'d be nice if one could be
"Capital" and another the system immediately "above" or "below" it, if
such exist).

The observatories each had large telescopes used for sky mapping.  They
also had a LARGE laser aimed in the direction of the other observatory.
The lasers were modulated with a signal similar to that used by the SPS
satellites.

Once the laser beam reached the other observatory (3.26 years after it
started), comparing the time information with the clocks at the
observatory gave the distance between them to an accuracy measured in
fractions of a millimeter. For additional accuracy, the time info was
echoed back to the originator over a second channel in the laser link.

Thus, after three and a quarter years, the length of the baseline was
known with incredible accuracy. And after signal info had made a round
trip (7.52 years total), the distance and relative movements of the two
observaties was known exactly.

With this info, the sky survey photos from the two observatories could
be compared for positional differences in the stars (parallax). The
parallax, plus the length of the baseline allowed precise location of
stars even *thousands* of parsecs away. Only stars oscured by dust
clouds and nebula will be hidden.

With positions known, other telescopes studied the nearer stars in the
uknown territory. With careful observations, it is possible to detect
gas giants, and even normal planets or asteroid belts. Even more info
is possible with careful study.

The initial parallax survey determined only position and stellar type
(O,A,B,F,G,K,M, etc). The follow-on surveys of stars can determine
*class* (ie the difference between a G0 and a G9 star) quickly.
Determining presence of gas giants takes a year or so.  Presence of
smaller bodies can take several years, and detecting atmosphere and
hydro (to the limited extent possible by astronomical observation)
takes even longer (a decade?).

This meant that it was determined that the best course would be to have
to survey determine positions, and presences of gas giants *only*, and
send ships to determine the rest. Thus was born the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service.


                 Interstellar Navigational Grid

As a secondary goal, the Scout Service established a "survey grid" of
beacons that would allow generating even *longer* baselines for
observations, though at lesser accuracy. It also had an unintended
secondary effect of allowing misjumped ships to easily determine where
they were even if there are no nearby stars.

The "grid" consists of extremely powerful transmitters, distributed
throughout a sector. On average, there will be one for every two
sub-sectors. These transmitters send out an ID and a time signal. As
with SPS systems, and the Imperial Baseline, signal comparisons give
distance.

It wasn\'t until a liner misjumped and landed in "empty space" a parsec
from the nearest star, that the other use for these beacons was
invented. The ship had fuel enough for another jump, thanks to being
lucky enough to find a small comet-like body within manuever drive
range. But they didn\'t know *where* to jump, and while they were using
the ships telescope to attempt to match stars to their charts, they
weren\'t certain that they\'d be able to pinpoint their locate before
they ran out of food. (The telescopes on ships are *not* intended for
that sort of work!)

One of the junior communications officers had run out several
kilometers of wire from engineering spares to make an antenna. He was
hoping to be able to pick up an identifiable signal to help with
narrowing down the ships position. A navigotor wandered by as he tuned
past one of the beacons and recognized the signal for what it was.
Within hours they\'d reprogrammed an SPS module to handle the grid
beacon signals. And a week later they popped out of jump near a
starport.

The news of this "miraculous" escape spread quickly, and gear for
determining the ships location in interstellar space by using grid
beacons is now standard emergency gear.

I\'m in agreement here.  Note that I said Sylea and others should know 
stellar positions and stellar classes.  This stuff could be 
discovered by use of astronomy.  Don\'t ask me about the nuts and 
bolts, I\'m a social scientist at heart.

I don\'t know if you\'d know this stuff for systems that were too far 
away though.  It wasn\'t until very recently that somebody found 
planets circling Alpha Centauri, which is practically a next door 
neighbor in stellar terms.  Whether Sylea would know this information 
for the Solomani Rim is doubtful, other than Stellar position, and 
maybe class.  Maybe you can prove me wrong though...

changes as I create FF&S Light. Thruster plates *will* continue to be
available as "alternate" technology. Reaction drives such as HEPlaR are the
primary focus, though.

This is truly depressing news. We might as well just call it TNEv2 instead
of T4. Hopefully MM or some other higher up will recognize this as the 1st
step toward recreating the debacle the GDW produced & put a stop to it.
Hopefully.

I hope so.  The whole question of skill level is a really extreame
abstraction forced on the game because it is, well, a game -- not a model of
the real world.  The whole idea of a "History" skill covering even what an
"Historian" knows about history is pretty lame.

One aspect of rules creep that seems to occur is increasing skills
specialization.  Any GM who has more than a superficial knowledge of a field
realizes the lack of precision and tries to correct it.  For example,
professionally I am probably a computer-4.  I do windows clients and
database tuning.  Know a few other bits and pieces about this and that.  In
the office we also have some folks who are computer-4 but their
specialization is GIS systems.  What can we discuss?  The weather.  If I
tried to do their work, I would be about a computer-0.

Creep seems to happen most often in military skills probably because (1) a
lot of gamers are military buffs, or have picked up a fair amount of
military knowledge from gaming and (2) things which can leave my character
dead are VERY interesting.

The result? It seems resonable to have a skill cascade Foward
Observer(Ortillery) but only one History skill as if a professor of
Victorian Social Anthropology could make a meaning statement of New Kingdom
Physical Culture.

What soultion would I propose?  Drag it back -- simplify.  Assume NPC
specialists are specialists (a few side skills for depth, but the lad with
the radio and the laser designator is the FO and that\'s it).  Let players be
generalists.  I would sooner have a player with skill Grunt-5 who can be a
one man army then to have to deal with all gory details (yes, you have
Combat Rifle-17, but that\'s a smoothbore, it doesn\'t count?)

Lets face it.  Studying the ancients in Trav would be like studying the Romans or 
Mayans or Egypians in our century.  It\'s the big stuff that everyone wants to get 
involved in.  However, there\'s a certian dark side to this work.  Because of the 
importance of Ancients sites, at TL21+ there\'s a lot of really important gear lying 
around on these sites, you\'d end up with a political officer and a troop of 
soliders every time you tried to dig up something.  Kinda like working in Mexico or 
Peru.  THe sites would all be mapped insitu with out having to disturb anything, 
just imaging what ground penetrating sensors are like then, wow!  Unfortunately 
in order to recover and study the artifacts you\'d still need to get on your hands 
and knees and dig the place up.  Or in the case of some work I\'ve seen out here 
wait for the D9 to tear the place appart and pick up what\'s left.  Youch that\'s a 
nasty way to work.

Working in europe I wouldn\'t imagine there\'s much call for hot wiring.  You\'re 
never extremely far away from something or some one.  Here in Canada when someone 
loses the keys and the nearest town is 150 miles away someone had better be a 
professional break in artist.  I wonder if air rafts are easy to hot wire...  and I 
wonder if they\'re still using 10cm mason pointing trowels in T4.  We got pretty 
good at throwing those things after two months in the field.

I\'d imagine a trendy department in every University would be something
like a Department of Physics and Antiquities.

Their main specialty would be the analysis of artifacts and their
surroundings, giving clues to where the leading-edge physics of the day
should be heading.  Of course, potential technological spin-offs (not
least in terms of military hardware) would lead to very acceptable
levels of corporate and government funding with the concommittant
decrease in interest in the "purity" of the field ;-)

Academic politics amongst the archaeologist/physicists could get
nasty...

You experience is far from typical.  Most people can\'t memorize what
each of 30 some odd digits means in 20 min without even trying.  I
glad it works so well for you, but the fact is that their use
is going to be a barrier to new players.

Wow, some people just won\'t give up!  What\'s the problem.  There is
now a quick and easy system a al Books 2 and 5 as well as the possible
inclusion of a revised version of FF&S.  In theory everyone should be
happy.

However, that isn\'t the case here.  Is your hate of TNE so great that
you won\'t allow any of it to influence T4?  And how can you even
compare IG to GDW.  If IG did like GDW and not listen to our input,
then we\'d be looking at HG 2.  As it stands, lots of things have been
reverse engineered, mechanics to match the story line, and ease of use
has been incorporated.  You can now create ships as quickly as Books 2
and 5 (and yes, this will be the initial stuff), and eventually all of
us gearheads will be able to get off by designing every nook and
cranny down to the damn glove compartment.

I\'m sorry if I don\'t see a problem other than your attitude.

These things would have to be extremely powerful (to the point of requiring
small stars for power sources), and it would take decades before the "grid"
was useful, due to the delay in propagating the signal accross 30 light
years of space.

This all seems rather wasteful, when there\'s already a grid in place that\'s
usable by anyone, anywhere [*].  All a civilization needs to do is some survey
and calibration work.  There are quite a number of pulsars in the galaxy;
they produce a distinctive radio signal that slowly changes over time,
making it a natural "clock".  The pulsars are powerful enough that their
signals can be detected all over the galaxy.

Using the very-long-baseline observatories mentioned earlier, the exact
locations of the most useful pulsars can be determined.  Benchmarking
surveys both within and outside of Imperial territory can sample the
pulsar\'s signal, so that it\'s "clock" is known with a high degree of
accuracy.

Finally, with all of the information published, any ship, literally anywhere
in the galaxy, that has a set of IISS pulsar charts can determine where it
is in deep space (even in previously-uncharted deep space) with a good
degree of accuracy.  Well, that and a working radio communicator.

It\'s also and adventure hook: PCs in a scoutship could be charged with
performing a benchmarking survey: literally all they have to do is to travel
ten parsecs in a given direction, stopping for a while at each location
along the way to record singnals from the various pulsars.  And return.

The only thing that makes this challenging is that it\'s into relatively
unknown, unexplored territory.  The benchmarking has to be performed before
the survey work starts, so all they\'ve got to work with is a map showing
star locations and the presence or absence of gas giants.


[*] Anyone that writes an adventure crediting (or blaming) Grandfather for
creating pulsars as a private navigational aid had better write a _good_
one!

Absolutely and they do get pretty nasty now just between differing archaeologist 
in the same field.  Richard Leaky and Don Johanson didn\'t speak to each other for 
years because of an intense personal rivalry.

The thing that bothers me is with the plethora of Ancients sites and the vast 
amount of material evidence at these sites that no one has put two and two 
together and figured out the whole Droyne thing.  I mean hell we can find one 
and a half million year old foot prints in east africa and determine that people 
walked them pretty much how they walk now and their feet were essentially the same 
but no one has ever notice the similarities between Droyne architecture and 
functional items and those utilized but the ancients.  Hell even a single chair 
will tell you a lot about the people who create the site.

Derek Stanley

I never had a problem beleiving than no one knew who the Ancients were until I 
read "Secret of the Ancients."  Then a little buzzer went off in my head and said 
pardon me, the Ancients are still alive, living among us an no one has noticed any 
material connection?  So much for the super science of the future.

>and homeworld characteristics.  

There has been some suggestions to include automatic 
default skills based on a charators home planet.  
I know such rules were included in MT and 
Traveller the Next Error but...

My problem with automatic default skills is 
that they are based on the idea that all 
home planets are generic.  

Let me use the following three planets 
from my own campaign to illustrate my opinion.

Example 1.	Vernoa	C550763-5	De, Po

[This idea was shamelessly stolen from Space 1889!]

Several thousand years ago an advanced human 
society built a series of canals on Vernoa.  
The purpose of the canals was to provide 
abundant water to the dessert from melting 
polar ice.  The descendants of those ancient 
humans now live exclusively on the canals.  
Sailing skill is automatic as sail boats 
are the primary means of transportation.  
Also most children learn to swim before 
they learn to walk.

Example 2.	Kamdell	D77A8DB-6	Wa

The government of Kamdell is a very strict 
religious dictatorship based on the worship 
of a vicious marine carnivore.  Any one 
entering the ocean, for any reason, is guilty 
of trasspassing against the gods.  Penalty 
for trasspassing is death.  As a result no 
one goes for a swim here (or more importantly
no one learns to swim here).

Example 3.	Tagus	C9CA553-9	Fl, Ni, Wa

The atmosphere of Tagus is highly insidious 
and will defeat any personal protective measure 
within 6 hours.  The fluid covering the planets 
surface is most defiantly not H2O.  Care to take 
a dip here?  Obviously few if any new borns to 
Tagus will automatically learn to swim.

at TL11 ... preTL-11 ships still use HEPlaR or Fusion.

I\'ll admit it Dave.  I loved TNE.  I hated getting into starship combat because that 
pretty much wasted an afternoon.  But I loved the system, the rules were good, 
providing you didn\'t get hit with a propelled grenade then things got messy, combat 
was easy, the equipment was supurb etc, etc, etc.  I\'ll buy the new system and if I 
think I can apply any of the stuff to my campaign I will.  But I intend to continue 
battling the virus and re-opening the frontiers of civilization.

Inspite of everyone\'s bitching about FF&S I liked it too, it needed to be better layed 
out, but it was essentially an excelent system.  Once you\'d designed something once it 
became really easy after that.  The problem I found was everyone looked at the first 
page, got intimidated and said, I don\'t have time for this.  This was from the same 
people who would happly spent two hours detailing a system out to the last moon of the 
last ice ball.  I can whip together a rifle in under twenty minutes, I can put 
together a starship in under three hours, and I can design a grav tank down to the 
fusion cannon in less than two hours.  Everybody whines about the system but how many 
of them really sat down and tried it as opposed to looking at the tables and getting 
flustered.  There\'s an art to designing equipment, it\'s not just a bunch of numbers on 
a page.  It\'s a living breathing organizm.

"You run into an Imperial Grav Tank."

"What\'s it look like?"

"It\'s square with a turret on top."

"Sounds ugly.  You got a picture?"

"No."

"Can you sketch me a picture."

"No, I just cranked it out ten minutes ago."

There\'s more to designing equipment than just crunching the numbers.  Like I said it\'s 
art and don\'t let anybody else convince you other wise.  A gearhead can crank the 
numbers through, an artist knows what it looks like and makes the pictures and plans 
while doing the work so everyone else knows what it looks like.

The skill numbers should not define the character. His role playing
should define the character. Subtle guidance from the GM will ensure
this. (Some times not so subtle :)

My players, and I when playing, have defined the context that the
skills were acquired in. I have a Barbarian TNE character that has
enforced an Intelligence check on himself every time he is faced with
technology. No prodding from me (the GM). This Barbarian has acquired a
Small Arms skill from another player character who was a Special Forces
Instructor. However, that does not mean that any weapon he picks up, he
knows how to operate. He enforces the unfamiliarity because, he doesn\'t
have the Tech-Level background to figure out that it is the same as the
one the Instructor showed him. In fact, whenever there are new weapons
to be used, the Instructor now takes the time to show him how to use
the weapon. 

IMO the characters *must* use the skills in context to define their
persona. GM\'s *must* enforce that context! The skills issue is moot.
Too many skills only slows down the CharGen process, and that can be
remedied, since the GM should be taking interest in the PC\'s
development anyway. (To gain contextual information!)

 Derek, I\'m slow today.  It took me a while to get your point.  

BUT:

I think the qualifying question for a skill is what tasks would you roll
against it?  You might have learned to hot-wire in Archeology 501, but you
would still not go looking for an archeology prof if you loose your keys.
It just means you picked up streetwise-0 in that term.

The person I was arguing against was trying to claim, as far as I could
tell, that there was no difference between the skill his "staw" archeologist
knew and what a person with a "Theology" skill would know.  I don\'t buy that.

I do but the claim that a scholar should have some non-scholarly skills.  He
rolls his ability to date a site by pottery fragments against Archeology.
To get down into the excavation without spreaining his ankle is still an
agility throw, and surviving the pub crawl the nearby town is still a
Courousing roll.  He might have developed all his abilities while training
and woring as an archiologist -- but they ae seperate skills.

In this case I as GM would determain the roll needed to recognize the
religion.  I would make the roll for the player in secret using the 
number of terms the charator spent studying the religion as a positive DM.  
(In hodgies case the DM would be +2)  The same method can be applied 
to historians or scientists and avoids the need for seprate History skills 
or cultural skills.

>BTW, this would be a great addition to the Merchant Captain Alexander

Actually, I based it on the Jamison example from book 1 :-).

As a finial point, I dislike the use of pre printed charator sheets that
list every single skill.  When the charators in my game have at most half 
a dozon skills almost all the page is wasted.  And the sheet doesn\'t reflect 
the fact that I as GM may create and include new skills.

I\'ve always been able to tell the good players from the bad players by looking
at the number of pages it takes to discribe their charators.

The only problem is that any religious scholar should have History skill
too. My problem with CT was that it had just about the right number of
*military* skills.  You can\'t play a decent scientist or scholar in that
system (I\'ve tried, having never had any interest in playing a military
character).  T4 doesn\'t need many more skills and IMHO *shouldn\'t* have
many more skills than CT, but it needs a greater diversity of skills. The
MT skill list was a little long, but had just the right amount of
diversity.

Absolutely, Wow I use that word a lot.  There\'s far more you learn in school than 
just what you\'re studying.  Anyone who just took, [insert appropriate disipline 
here] at university would be a pretty boring fellow.  I know when I was at 
university I took all kinds of courses, some of which were completely unrelated to 
what I was majoring in, why?  You\'d go crazy if all you did all day was look at pot 
sherds.  
	
Anything you do you\'re learning other things while doing so.  I studies archaeology 
while I was in university, what do I do now?  I\'m an on strike environmental 
tester.  Is that what I do, no, I just do that because it\'s steady money, I\'m 
really a writer, a script writer actually I\'m studying to become an assistant 
director and a cameraman.  So there\'s far more going on than would be covered in a 
single career term during character generation or in a single secondary activity 
pick.  Do any of these things relate to skills.  Probably, Writing, Leadership and 
Photography.

I guess perhaps I\'m trying to justify a skill in a disipline that I feel very 
strongly about, perhaps I\'m getting way off track here.  The point being there\'s 
more to archaeology than history and there\'s far more to history than just the 
written word.  We here in North America should be far more aware of that than any 
other culture on the face of the planet.  Where I sit now, the Left Coast, 
Vancouver to be precise, history only began 150 years ago, recorded history.  
Before that there are no written records, just the archaeology.  The first thing I 
did when I visited England was to hit the nearest church graveyard.  First 
tombstone I saw was placed there 300 years before Canada even existed on a map.  
You have no idea as to how young that makes us out here on the west coast.  The 
Oldest standing structure out here is a trade shop at Fort Langley, just slightly 
better than 130 years old.

And surviving a propper archaeological pub craw is probably more of a test of 
endurance than carousing.  You\'ve never been to a party till you\'ve been at an 
archaeological mixer.  Man those things are wild.  It took us half a bottle of sake 
to determine that 9 seconds on high was the perfect temperature for a shot glass in 
a microwave and boiler makers I\'m never seen so many boiler makers at a single 
outting.  I\'m getting misty just thinking about it.  On of the guys I worked with 
was working in Alberta, in the space of a single field season he was chased by 
bison on an ATV, and man can those suckers move, fled from a train tunnel to avoid 
being crushed and a couple of other thing\'s I\'d care not to speak of.

Remember if you take archaeology as a skill on a back woods planet never ever walk 
up to someones door with a clip board, it\'s a good way to get shot.

I totally agree!  Perhaps I should finally own up, in public,
to having tried my own hand at bits of rules.

Now I appreciate that no one is particularly going to want to
adventure as a librarian character in the 57th century
(although I\'ve quite enjoyed it!) so I won\'t bore you with
the usual char gen.

However, what about the scheme I\'ve been trying to work out
for a ULP.  (Yes another one, sorry if you\'re not fond of
them!)

A universal library profile.

It seems to me that the one thing that was somewhat
overlooked in Traveller (should I grovel to Marc seperately?)
was a consideration of exactly what format all the wonderful
\'library data\' that existed might come in.

The ULP (in five or six digits) enables referees to see what
is available (and how, and to whom, etc. etc.) for any world
visited whether hi-tech, lo-tech or anything in between.

I don\'t know if this of interest to x-boat readers but I\'m
about to be thrown out of the building so I must go now.

Jerry, 

Well put, if somewhat blunt.  

I say this as somebody who has never designed a ship with FF&S, and 
has never played TNE (although I have the books for the system, and 
HAVE read them).  The facts are that a lot of people liked FF&S, and 
IMO it was probably the best thing that GDW designed out of the TNE 
stuff.  In my opinion, that\'s a bit like saying it\'s the best 
ballerina in Galveston, TX, but FF&S was a good idea.  I think that a 
tweaked FF&S under a different name in a year or two would be a fine 
addition to my collection.  There is a simpler design system, and we 
can thank IG in general and Don Perrin in particular for seeking 
input.  A simple system and a complex system should please everybody. 
 
It\'s time for the CT folks to face facts.  this is not 1977.  Most of 
the people on this list are veterans of 10-20 years of RPG 
experience.  My first RPG was Tunnels & Trolls.  A crude design, 
terrible mechanics, and no product support.  Would I play it again, 
now?  Not in a million years.  Would I use book 2 to fight starship 
combat or design starships?  Heck, I\'m not even sure I\'d want to use 
Book 5 again...  Again, not in a million years.  A large number of 
gamers feel the same way.  For you to bash FF&S just because you 
don\'t like it, is no better than what GDW did by assuming that 
everybody wanted to use a system as complex as FF&S.

The good news for the CT folks, is there\'s no Virus in the first 
mililieu, your campaigns will be writing the "canon", instead of 
being strangled by it.  The system is going to bear a closer 
resemblance to CT/MT than TNE, and IG is looking for ideas and 
input.  The strength of the game has always been the background first, 
and the rules second (or third), anyways.

> MegaTraveller Referee\'s Gaming Kit (DGP)

Basically a good referee\'s screen, with a short folio adventure and 
some equipment sheets in the DGP style.

If its the price I saw listed on SOK a while ago, its worth it if you 
use MT.

> Traveller Logbook (Judge\'s Guild)

Not a clue on this one

I believe this was a book full of subsector maps

Planetary maps, if I\'m not mistaken..

General note on all the Judge\'s Guild stuff.  IMHO, it was poorly 
proofed, and of amateurish quality.  I liked some of the sector maps, 
and wound up buying all of them.  The other stuff never interested me 
enough to get it.  I have none of the above products, but probably 
saw all of them over the years.

> Arrival Vegeance (GDW) Adventure?

Late in the MT era.  Set in Hard Times.  

***SPOILER MATERIAL ahead***

Basically a trek by an Azhanti High Lightning cruiser across the 
Imperium, trying to contact various factions in the Rebellion to seek 
Alliance, with lots of adventures in between.

Probably worth buying, if you have Hard Times.  If not, you might 
want to find a copy of Hard Times first.

A followup to the Hard Times Sourcebook for MT.  Merc adventures in 
the Diaspora sector

I haven\'t run this 1.  It looks OK, but it didn\'t especially thrill 
me.

Not familiar with this 1.

A sector on the Trailing edge of the Imperium.  If I\'m not mistaken, 
this may be non "canon" material, whatever that means.  A decent 
sector map though.

A quick and easy system?  Just where is this system?  
If it\'s posted on the internet I haven\'t seen it yet.

The best part about the book 2 design system was that it 
didn\'t explain the technology.  The GM was free to create
what ever explanations they wanted to explain what and

Hate?  Maybe he just doen\'t want to see the same mistakes repeated

You\'re right, we can\'t compare IG to GDW.  But we *can* compare

us believe that IG would be doing the same thing by including the 
same type of unusible ship design system in the basic rules.

The ostensible reason for the IN placing an interdiction on Shionthy
was that the concentration of contra-terrene matter was a significant
hazard to space travel. A single fleck of antimatter could severely damage a
ship, and probably the crew as well due to the radiation produced in
the annihilation. Adventure 1: The Kinunir gives some rules for
encountering antimatter, so I think that this could be taken as
official canon.

Of course, since the Shionthy belt is presumed to have been caused by
a Ancient planet-buster weapon, the Imperial Navy have probably
interdicted the system so that they can sift the area for scraps of
Ancient technology without treasure hunters making off with valuable
(and possibly powerful) items.

If I remember rightly, the Travellers Digest published an adventure
(part of the grand tour) which took place on an interdicted Ancient
site in the Marches, but I can\'t remember which system it was on
(Pixie springs to mind, though).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks for the support Dan. You\'ve already said most of what I would
have so I\'ll just add some comments.

Darkstar; you guys have been pissin\' & moanin\' & cryin\' & whinin\' ever
since T4 has been announced because you weren\'t getting what you wanted.
I find it interesting that you now take offence whenever someone else
complains. You already got what you wanted with TNE & we all know what
a big success that was. Face it, you are out of touch with what the
general public desires & your extreme attachment to FF&S just proves
the point. T4 may well be able to survive this grafting on of elements
of the failed TNE system but I suspect that your demands have only just 
begun.

I repeat, the more T4 adopts from & therefore comes to resemble TNE the
more people will identify it with TNE. And that\'ll be a big negative,
for sure.

eee-Nuff. Take it to alt.flame if you need to continue insulting each other.

    -- the Admin


Now, a rational non-flaming, non-TNE, non-CT bashing reply to the ships argment:

It appears that some form of FF&S will be used to create the design system
for T4.  The design system does not look like it will be FF&S, just derived
from FF&S.

Basically both sides win here.  The Gear Heads get to go nuts and build
simple easy to use tables that will be for the non-Gear Heads.  They are
correcting some mistakes in FF&S when they build the tables (for instance
you should be able to drive a 200T Far Trader with a crew of 2).  They get
to argue the variations in laser intensities to their hearts content, we
hopefully will get a chart of  Laser X does nD6 damange (or whatever is
appropriate).

I have been kinda listing in on the GDW-beta list where the gear heads roam
and injecting my "Demands" from time to time.  So far, I am pleased with
what I have seen, though I have not looked at the weapons and combat stuff
yet.  But hopefully, they learned, and their hull/drive/power plants seem
somewhat reasonable.

Let people put in glove boxes if they want, but the basic system doesn\'t
need it, and frankly we just need a bunch of pre-designs to work with and a
combat system that is simple and works.

There are two "Quick and Easy Systems", actually.  One, The Quick Ship
Design System (QSD System) is on the same complexity level as Book 2, and
was done by me.  You literally select from tables and add up columns - the
intent was that you could reasonably design a ship with nothing more than
the rulebook and a pencil and paper (there\'s only two places where you have
to divide, and only six multiplications in the whole sequence, so the
calculator is optional).  It\'s truly "plug-and-chug".

The result is (within a fairly limited scope: 100 to 5000 ton ships, and a
reasonable but small set of hull, weapon and sensor options) a ship rated
for the MMT starship combat system, that is also a valid FF&S design.

I\'ll see if I can get permission to make the design system available on the
\'net somewhere.  I believe the QSD System will be included in the basic MMT
rulebooks, so that you\'ll be able to design and customize ships immediately.

The second system is FF&S "Lite", being put together by David Golden.  He\'s
got the current mock-up on his web site.  FF&S "Lite" is a bit more complex;
you\'ll need a calculator work out your design.  On the other hand, it\'s a
LOT more flexable, is still much easier than FF&S, and also produces MMT
statistics and valid FF&S designs.  FF&S "Lite" will probably be included
with the starship book product.

Since both systems are based on FF&S, you can mix and match steps: if you
don\'t like any of the QSD System\'s available hulls, you can generate a hull
with FF&S Lite, and then fill it with QSD System components and have a valid
design.  You can use FF&S to design a new weapons system, and then "package"
it up for use with QSD System or FF&S Lite.

I think we\'ve really got the best of both (all three?) worlds with MMT.

Unless of course, he had no background in physics, and therefore had 
to come up with total bulls**t.  

Sorry, but I like a canonical explanation of some sort as to how the 
stuff works.  Not that most of my players are going to ask, but if 
they do, I\'m going to be able to give them a semi-rational, 
consistent explanation on how something works.

They aren\'t.  IG IS listening to folks.  They\'ve changed things quite 
a few times, and taken a lot of suggestions.  Actually, from what 
I\'ve seen, the only thing out of TNE that is going to be used is 
FF&S.  IMNSHO, FF&S was the best thing to come out of TNE, even 
if I do disagree with it, and find it too complex.

Er, not too many.  And the unusable ship design system you refer to 
(FF&S) is NOT going to be in the basic rules.

Just because you or I don\'t want something, doesn\'t mean there aren\'t 
a lot of people who do.  Open your mind...  You are being at least as 
bad as some of the pro FF&S people...  Game design has progressed 
since 1977...  I doubt seriously that very many people at all want to 
go back to the rules of the little black books...

I figure that the reason is that the Imperial Navy is trying to find a
way to *mine* the anti-matter and use it as a power source. They don\'t
want anybody else getting hold of any.

For a good description of the sort of problems involved, read "Seetee

Contra-terrene)

Remember, a lot of the recent discoveries are due to observations from
the Hubble Space Telescope. As telescopes go, it\'s no more than a large
*amateur* instrument. A professional size telescope on the moon or in
the outer reaches of the solar system would pick this sort of thing up
easily.

I posted what I sent in. Note that I took a reasonable (if somewhat
pessimistic) view. Once you have the positions, you can start
determining more about the nearer stars. But its almost as fast (if not
faster) to send a ship to check things out. And the ship can determine
things that the telescope can\'t.

I\'m pretty sure these are mostly books of blank forms, with some tables
included. They may have some filled in maps/forms, but it\'ll still be
mostly blank ones.

A sector map and world details that GDW has since declared to be

I\'ve encountered them in "The Fountains of Paradise" and "Red Mars" and like
the idea, but I have\'nt been able to convince myself that such a thing would
work
(not that that should be a problem in an SF game!)

Think about it: a large mass (an asteroid, say) is placed in
planeto-stationary orbit and a cable is lowered to the planetary equator and
anchored.  elevator cars are then run up and down the cable.  Seems simple.

However, at no point along its length is the cable (which has mass, probably
a lot of mass) in orbit.  For example, a section of cable 200km above the
earth\'s surface travels "around" the planet in 24h and is thus moving at a
very much lower velocity than a satellite orbiting at the same altitude.
The cable is therefore not "weightless", and exerts a downwards force on the
orbiting anchor.

Is it not then the case that no matter how massive the anchor the cable
would eventually drag it down to the planetary surface, with catastrophic
consequences?

Hope someone can help

The cable\'s _radial_ velocity is the same as that of the satellite - it
completes 2*pi radians in 24 hours. It\'s just the same as the rotation of the
planet - a point on the surface of the planet and a point somewhere inside
the planet are moving at different speeds, but their angular velocity is
the same,
otherwise the planet would break up.

I think that the most likely candidate for drag is going to be the effect
of the planet\'s atmosphere on the cable, but I don\'t have any figures for
that, I\'m afraid.

Well, most of the discussion on it has been taking place on the
traveller and gdw-beta mailing lists.  There\'s a draft in place and
everything.  I\'ll have to dig up the URLs and give them to you later.

: The best part about the book 2 design system was that it 
: didn\'t explain the technology.  The GM was free to create
: what ever explanations they wanted to explain what and 
: how the MDrive worked.  

I think this is more a function of the fact that the original 3 books
didn\'t present the Imperium as THE game universe.  But hey, things
change and we realize that the importance of Traveller is the story
behind it.  So you don\'t like the way MDrives work.  Change it.  I
keep seeing lots of divergent campaigns where people change the
history of something or other because it works better with their
view of the Imperium and yet can\'t bring themselves to create a
different explanation for the way drives work.  What doesn\'t make
sense here?  I swear sometimes I feel like people purposefully don\'t
bend the way tech works just so they can have a point of contention
with me.  8)

Uhm, where did I say I loved TNE?  Or is the assumption that since I
liked FF&S suppossed to mean that I liked the entire game.  Man, I
could have sworn that I heard myself complain about the storyline.  I
seem to recall stating on this list many times about what I found
wrong with TNE.  But then again, I had to swallow hard and admit that
there were things about it that I DID like.

Do you believe that they shot themselves in the foot because the
created TNE or because they didn\'t listen to their customer input?
How many of us were clamoring for a campaign background other than the
RC?  How many of us desired sourcebooks that dealt with other
timelines (classic, rebellion, hard times, etc...)?  The complaints
that mostly hit the list (about 80%) were not about mechanics, but
rather about the story and that Virus crap (to quote someone else).

It\'s good to see that IG didn\'t listen to any of this and they\'re
picking up right where GDW left off!

Starships supplement.

You don\'t need them in your designs.  I however see otherwise.  Why do
you think that IG is starting with the basic system and then building
upon it?  That way you get the simple stuff with the rules and then
you can fork out the extra cash for a more detailed system if you\'re
interested.  I still don\'t see what the problem with this is.  It
worked for Starship and then High Guard.

: >I\'m sorry if I don\'t see a problem other than your attitude.

: Sounds like someone else has the attitude problem.

Oh pardon me if I get a tad offended by people who assume that if IG
isn\'t reprinting the stuff from 20 years ago then the product will be
crap.  Also, I find it hard to swallow that by making changes that
their customers are asking for the IG is turning into another GDW.

    'body' => 'Well, it appears that we have several different styles of Traveller 
players, and that they overlap to some degree.  There are people who like 
complex, moderate, and simple systems for ship design.  These three 
groups also exist for skill systems.  This is probably also true of every 
other system in Traveller.  

An interesting thing is that the people who enjoy complex ship design 
(for instance) are not necessarily the same people who enjoy complex 
skill systems (again, for instance).  

Me?  I\'m one of the folks who likes to keep things simple, but I also 
appreciate the need of others for complexity.  It\'s great that Mr. 
Wildstar\'s system may be (will be?) included in the basic book.  If that 
is true, then I will be very, very happy.  (No offense meant to Mr. 
Golden - I like his system, too, but I love the idea of having all three 
systems (including the renamed FF&S) available.)  If things turn out the 
way they are looking to in terms of ship design, I\'ll probably use QSDS 
most of the time, FF&S Light once in a while (for important ship 
designs), and FF&S only once in a great while.

So, having lots of different ship design sytems is good.  But is this 
also true of skill systems?  I mean, heck, if it were possible, wouldn\'t 
that satisfy everyone?  

I\'m thinking it can\'t be done smoothly, however.  Not without drastically 
changing the Traveller skills system.  Let\'s say the basic system has 
only top-level skills with a few cascades.  Medic-0 is first aid, etc.  
The complex system would either have tons of cascades (Medical is divided 
into First Aid, Nurse, etc.) or simply have tons of skills (Medic is one 
skill, First Aid is another).  Unlike with going from QSDS to FF&S or 
FF&S Light to FF&S, taking a character from one of these systems to the 
other would involve some translations.  

Examples:

Basic to Cascade:  My (Basic) Medic-1 would have to make a choice as to 
which cascade skill (or skills) she would want to have.  Instead of 
being mediocre at all medical skills, she would be mediocre at one 
cascade and very poor (skill level 0) at all others.  She looses ability 
in the translation.

Basic to Lots O\' Skills:  My (again, Basic) Medic-1 would go from being 
able to perform emergency medical assistance to being less able to do so 
(if I have this system figured right).  The First Aid or EMT skilled 
people would be more proficient than she at this sort of action.  (And if 
this is not the case,then why have separate skills at all?  If one is a 
subset of the other, then keep them as one skill.)

As I (and others) have said before, my preference is that there be a good 
list of basic skills (something very like the complete skill list from 
CT, including all the Books and Supplements).  If more skills are needed 
in a particular campaign, the referee can add them.  


While there may be broad support for having a lot more skills, each 
individual extra skill is only going to be useful to a very limited 
number of referees and players.  Please, keep the basic skills system simple.

Some one found planets around Alpha Centari?  I must have been unconcious

The 2300AD game system recognized two "Beanstalks" in the human sphere.  One
on the earth and one at Beta Canum Venaticorum (sp?).  The whole thing was
the asteroid was like a ball on the end of a string because of the speed it
was orbiting the planet and its mass, greater than that of the stalk itself,
it wanted to pull away from the planet.  In the "Invasion" module in order
to deny the Kafer\'s  access to the beanstalk the lower attachments were
blown before the planet fell and the beanstalk just drifted off into space.
Musta been a hell of a sight from the planets surface.

Good answer, and it shows you\'re a flexible and creative referee.  I\'m a

I take it TNE had such a character sheet?  (I\'ve never seen a Traveller 
character sheet with all skills listed on it.)  Or has this been proposed 
for MMT?

: begun.

Phil, first and foremost, I\'ve always taken offense when you complain.
Second, you mistake our previous round as out-and-out support for TNE.
I did say that there were a lot of things that I liked about TNE.  I
also recall saying that there were plenty more that I didn\'t like
about TNE.  I also recall that I didn\'t even begin to play a TNE
campaign until The Regency Sourcebook came out.  So please don\'t say I
got what I wanted out of TNE until you see how much of it I actually
used.  After that we\'ll talk about disappointment.

My point back then was that some people liked the RC and Virus setting
and that there should be no reason why they shouldn\'t continue the
setting in one of their Milieu sourcebooks.  You disagreed and
basically said what amounted to "they just shouldn\'t be playing
Traveller if that\'s the setting they want to use."

Where were you all last week?  Work on an easy design system was all
over the gdw-beta list.  It was announced many times and stuff
cross-posted to both the traveller list and this list.  If you wanted
to make sure it was done right, why didn\'t you give your Cr.02 on the
issue?  Speaking of which, have you even seen this system yet?  I
didn\'t think so.

: I repeat, the more T4 adopts from & therefore comes to resemble TNE the
: more people will identify it with TNE. And that\'ll be a big negative,
: for sure.

It\'s amazing how lots of people wanted to go back to CT and MT for
lots of things except for this.  Originally IG was going to go with a
more HG system then what they have now.  Amazingly once they saw more
people complain then not they gave it some thought and a chance to see
if it could work.  "FF&S?  Only if you can make it as quick and simple
as Books 2 and 5".  Take a look at the stuff before you start to blast
it.  That\'s all I\'m asking.

I agree with you that Traveller needs more non-military characters than 
the basic CT system had.  This means it needs more skills to support 
those characters.  But which skills?  

For instance, I don\'t remember the character list Marc posted having a 
Religious Scholar.  It had a Scholar, but it wasn\'t specialized.  But, 
hey, you\'ve gotta have /some/ skills for specialization, right?  Right.

But, again, which ones?  If we choose to include every single discipline, 
we\'re going to have a humongous list of skills (many of which won\'t be 
used in most campaigns).  Does it make more sense to make some broad 
choices that are not too specific (ie, top-level skills rather than 
breaking them down into their component skills - Computer Science, 
rather than Database Systems, Management Information Systems, and 
Programming - let alone a further breakdown (for instance of Programming 
into each computer langauge, or of any computer skill into 
platform-specific skills)), or to allow for the widely applicable, 
low-level skills such as languages, computer use, etc.?

With only a very few additions, the complete CT list of skills can serve 
to allow for any area of study, as Daniel\'s Theology example shows.  This 
method appears to be the best way to go.

No TNE used blank spaces after the attribues.  I don\'t know where this
character sheet came from.

My understanding is that:
a) By the Word of Marc Miller, T-Plates are cannon.
b) There will be reaction drives as well
c) T-Plates show up at either TL 11 or 12.  I forget which
d) The T4 reaction drives will not be the fuel hogs they were in TNE
e) T4 J-Drives will use CT/MT fuel formulas, not the TNE ones required by d).

   TNE had it\'s major flaws (like Virus & only reaction drives).  It did have
some strong points though.  The character creation system was much stronger
than CT.  The task resolution system didn\'t drive GM\'s to pack asprin like
the MT system.

    Actually, GDW lost toes over the T$R lawsuit.  The typo ridden MT

   Then what is the arguing about?  You got what you wanted.  Book 2 & 5
type design rules included in the main book.  The rules even include 
reactionless drives!

  Because there are enough gearheads out there to make it worthwhile

   There was a poll taken, and the results showed that most folks who
used all three design systems perfered FF&S.  It also showed that there
was a need for a \'Q&D\', plug & play design system (like Book 2).
  That is what IG is putting out.  The Plug & Play rules in the main
book, and detailed, gearhead rules in a seperate book.  Don\'t buy the
gearhead book if that level of detail offends you.

  If T4 is just a reissue of CT, why bother?  It has been 20 years, and
the RPG industry has learned some lessons (like it doesn\'t pay to argue
with T$R lawyers :-<).  There are some good features from TNE & MT that
IG should look to including in T4, as well as things that should be left
by the wayside.

        That\'s why you extend a counterweight *outward* from the central
mass. That part is easy to fix ... but what do you do when some terrorist
blows the downhaul loose? Or some drunk in his suborbital skimmer nails it?
The kinetic energy in that cable when it hits will make the end of the world

Jeez, you must have been sleeping under a rock.  I read somewhere in 
a mainstream publication (might have even been a local fishwrap), 
that some Astronomer in the US had discovered what looked like a 
planet circling 1 of the stars of Alpha Centauri...

I couldn\'t tell you exactly when it was, sometime last year.

Sorry, I can\'t remember more, I wish I could.

I would say, given they have gravitics (which will allow gravity
fields to do with uncharge matters what magnetic fields does
with charged matter) they already have the means.  I think
the consequences of this one weren\'t that well thought through.

It couldn\'t have been liked by that many people, otherwise it would still be

Besides, I don\'t even know what HEPlaR is?  I thought that Thruster Plates
were part of background not rules.

Yes, I\'ve seen the \'simplified\' star ship design on Daves web pages.  Yuck!!!
Page after page of mind numbing charts.  Again, why is level of detail so
important?  
If the only reason you play the game is to spend hours detailing meaningless
pages
of \'funny\' numbers than go ahead.  But don\'t try to pass this off as the next 
best thing to sliced bread.  It\'s still a complex, overly detailed, impossible 
to use system.

If you mean that they spend time detailing every single asteroid in a system
then I
would agree.  However, if you mean they spend time detailing the NPCs in the
system,
the details of the planets government, the culture and language of the
planets then
I would disaggree with you.  IMO the point to playing Traveller is dealing with
new situations and solving problems and puzzles caused by situations, not
trying to
squeeze another .000047 MegaWatts out of your latest Battleship design.  (But
I\'ll admit this is a judgment call on my part.)

Again, the absence of any explaination of the formate of Library
data was one of the strengths of Traveller.  The rules (IMO) 
should NOT tell us exactly how things work.  That\'s up to the
GM to design.  \'Official\' background can give one or more ideas
of how such systems work, but look what happened to the rules 
governing computers in Traveller.  What was thought possible 
in the late 70\'s turned out to be way off!

        For the same reason that a lot of things popular in 1977 aren\'t
popular in 1996: this isn\'t 1977, it\'s 1996. People have changed, our world

both
an interesting back-drop and a centerpoint for adventures.
Given the universe of Traveller as it is, it lends itself to the spread of 
missionaries throughout the Imperium and the surrounding space.
In my games, the missionaries are recognized as being individuals of
peaceful intent and are therefore never messed with (even the pirates
don\'t bother them since it\'d REALLY get the locals up in arms!).

Actually, thought has occured.  Since the Droyne are really the Ancients and
the Droyne have no known homeworlds just something I can\'t spell off the top
of my head that means "lost home" has anyone considered or read that
Shionthy might actually be the remains of the Droyne/Ancients homeworld.

You seem to feel that the Imperium IS Traveller.  I\'ve always thought
that Traveller is a framework of rules on how to run a good Sci-Fi
game.  The official background is just that background.  

The rules should not attempt to explain technology, only present the
framework of how the technology is applied.  That way the GM is free
to create their own reasons without having to change major sections
of the base rule set.

If you say "If you don\'t like thruster plates, don\'t use them!", fine.
But if the rule set for space combat and ship design imply that MDrives
are thruster plates than I would have to change major parts of the rules.

>Oh pardon me if I get a tad offended by people who assume that if IG
>isn\'t reprinting the stuff from 20 years ago then the product will be
>crap.  Also, I find it hard to swallow that by making changes that

I\'m not saying that they need to reprint old material, but I am
suggesting that they print new material in the same way they did
20 years ago.  Specifically:

        Clearly separate the basic framework of rules from background.

and

        Keep the rules as simple as possible.

Somehow the Imperium seems to have became the only viable background.
No commercial products that I know of delt with alternate settings.
This I feel was one reason why Traveller fizzled.  Remember, TSR 
published several campaign settings for D&D.  

New players may have gotten the idea that Traveller was about 
Stephon, Zhodani and Aslans (or more recently Virus).  
And if they didn\'t like those things they wouldn\'t like Traveller.

I think you may have mistaken this for the other myraid of planets
discovered recently.  I make a habit out of cutting EVERY article to do with
science & space out of the Toronto Star (a big newspaper) and there hasn\'t
been anything to do with planets around Alpha or Proxima Centauri.  However,
recently, (actually a couple of times last year) scientists using the Hubble
telescope have discovered planets circling other stars.  In fact, just
yesterday a Jupiter sized planets in a similar orbit to Jupiter was
discovered circling a star only 8 light years from Earth.  There\'s evidence
that a smaller, Earth sized planet may orbit closer to that star as well,
prompting the newspaper article to suggest the possiblity of
extra-terrestrial life, guess we\'ll have to wait and see.

Yeah, he played this retired Navy Chaplin for several game sessions. 
We were running a Far Trader in the Spinward Marches, and all the
players were ex-Navy.  This guy was the medic on the ship.."Being both
doctor and priest, I really *can* space my mistakes."  <g> I remember
this crew having to deal with a Theocracy on some world, and getting
involved in some sort of religious dispute between factions on
another.

Never ran any real missionaries, though that could be
interesting.  I did have an NPC gun runner pretending to be a
missionary in one game.

Can\'t say the same here.  Pirates don\'t give *anyone* quarter, and
most locals don\'t want some strange outsider harranging them about
religion..they\'ve got plenty of locals anxious to do that themselves.

There are plenty of possibilities out there.

I shouldn\'t have used the term "drag" - I meant it in the loose rather than
technical sense.  The cable isn\'t being pulled through the planet\'s
atmosphere, although I imagine that strong winds near the ground and
high-altitude jetstreams might have an effect on the structure.  Instead of
"drag" I should have said "pull": the weight of the cable is pulling the
asteroid down because although the asteroid is in free-fall, the cable is
not.  The cable is not in orbit (free-fall) precisely because it is moving
with the same angular velocity as the planetary surface.

??????! This sounds wrong to me.  The anchor mass does want to pull away
from the planet: it wants to travel in a straight line at a constant
velocity, but it can\'t because the planetary mass keeps on exerting a
gravitational pull on it.  This is pretty much the definition of "orbit" and
explains why the Moon doesn\'t need a long string attached to it to stop it
drifting away from the Earth.  Similarly, the cable anchor would stay in
orbit whether the cable was attached or not (unless it is the case that the
weight of the cable would eventually pull the anchor out of orbit...)

In "Red Mars" the martian seperatists blow the cable at the anchor end to
stop Terran mercenaries assaulting the surface (Its a while since I read it
so I might be misremebering here).  

I\'m not sure about the idea of a counterweight: I don\'t think it would work
either (I\'m so down on everything today :-)).  A counterweight mass higher
up than the primary anchor would have a different orbital velocity.
Remember that the only reason the elevator works (if it does...) is because
its orbital velocity is such that it has the same period as the planetary
surface below, and this can only be achieved at one orbital radius.  The
counterweight would have to be both higher up than the anchor and moving at
the same velocity as the anchor and this just isn\'t possible.

In Scotland we have a third verdict in court: "Not Proven".  This is how I
feel about Space Elevators.  I really would welcome any more comments on
this subject.  If you don\'t think its appropriate for the list, mail me direct.

: 
: You seem to feel that the Imperium IS Traveller.  I\'ve always thought
: that Traveller is a framework of rules on how to run a good Sci-Fi
: game.  The official background is just that background.  
: 
: The rules should not attempt to explain technology, only present the
: framework of how the technology is applied.  That way the GM is free
: to create their own reasons without having to change major sections
: of the base rule set.

Would you say the same about the Star Wars RPG?  What about
Battlelords of the 23rd Century?  The problem with role-playing games
is that there needs to be a place for them to play in.  What you just
described is GURPS Space.

If all Traveller is suppossed to be is a set of mechanics, then why
are we even bothering including a background?  Why should Virus or The
Rebellion even be an issue?  If you don\'t like technology tied to
rules, then why is jump space the default FTL?

But the Imperium does end up being the background for the ruleset for
the game we call Traveller.  And yes, jump works the way it does,
Strephon lives, and Virus make my toaster feel queasy.

If you want to use the rules but not the setting, then do so.  The
game should be tailored to suit your needs.  You don\'t like an
explanation change it or don\'t reference it.  Try to pick up any RPG
(other than a generic one) and see if the setting can be completely
distinguished from the rules.

As for TSR and their many campaign worlds.  Greyhawk was their
official and only campaign world until 1986 when it (along with Gary
Gygax) was dropped.  At that point they created the Forgotten Realms.
It wasn\'t until the 2nd edition, and actually in the last four years
that they\'ve started this propagation of campaign worlds.

That\'s funny considering that you haven\'t even seen the product yet.
Man prejudice abounds.  I\'d say wait until it hits the shelves at your

of it is CT than you think.  But you know, I can\'t say I honestly
believe you\'d give it a fair shake, so maybe it\'s better for my piece
of mind to know that someone as prejudiced as yourself isn\'t playing a

Actually, I\'d say GDW\'s problems with T$R, and MegaTraveller\'s poor

neglecting the Regency background hurt them as well.

DUH, because some people like that level of detail.  If you haven\'t

Not impossible to use, at least not for a lot of people.  Probably 
easy if laid out on a spreadsheet, which is the best way to use any 
of the ship design systems (Except for Book 2, which my 3 year old 
could probably design a ship with).

> I would disaggree with you.  IMO the point to playing Traveller is dealing with

To some people.  Ideally it is what the players want out of it.  If 
they want excruciating detail, then the system should let you.  If you want 
something less detailed, dump what you don\'t want.  It\'s easier to 
delete a rule you don\'t want to use than it is to add 1 you need.

> Have you seen this simple system?  It\'s as simple as a 1040 tax form!

Actually, I filled out a 1040 tax form in about 40 minutes this year. 
It took me about 40 minutes to design a ship with MT the last time I 
did it.  I would suspect that Dave\'s FF&S lite will also take me 
about 40 minutes.  You\'re right, it is as simple as a 1040 tax 
form...

Actually, if you want the naked truth, its because THERE WAS NOTHING 
ELSE OUT THERE!

The RPG systems on the market in 1977 were D&D, Tunnels & Trolls, and 
a few other Fantasy RPG\'s.  It was the first SF RPG, and therefore 
was successful, almost by default.  It was an elegant system for the 
time, but lets face it, a lot of CT looks like a greybeard at this 
point in terms of rule system.  This is the reason for a task system, better, more 
comprehensive ship and craft design.  Look at the number of early 
Traveller licensees who now make products that compete within the same niche:  
Games Workshop (Adventure 4: Leviathan), FASA (Sky Raiders, and a ton of 
other stuff), DGP (Soon to come out with AI, they basically designed 
MegaTraveller).  

Hell, I bought my second set of Little Black Books at Waldenbooks for 
heavens sake.  Those days are gone.  They will NEVER be back.  The 
market has matured, there are other SF RPG\'s out there, and in the case 
of the SF market, games with very recognizable licensing (Star Wars, 
Star Trek), are directly competing.    Plus, the RPG market has shrunk 
compared to those days.  I live across the way from a guy who bought 
the CT boxed set, and never used them.  At that time, people bought 
RPG\'s they never used, kind of like people buy CCG\'s today.  
GDW, TSR and others got rich then in a way that the companies 
around now would have a hard time doing.  A lot of people got into 
RPG\'s for a couple years in the late 70\'s and early 80\'s, and then got out.  
Then about 83-85, a lot of the early companies fell like leaves from the 
trees in autumn, as a lot of players moved on.  Frankly, I was that way 
for a while.  I didn\'t get back into it until about 1990 after having not 
played a game since 1984.

If you think that just reissuing the little black books in a single 
bound volume is going to allow IG to take shelf space away from West 
End Games (Star Wars), & FASA (Starfleet Battles), you are deluding 
yourself.  Very few people would give a system that relied solely on something 
as crude as Book 2, Starships for ship design a 2nd glance today, not 
even me.

On the other hand, you did confirm my basic premise, we have only

The way a beanstalk ostensably works is to make the cable long enough that
the asteroid is travelling at a greater than orbital velocity, and thus
pulls the cable tight by centrifugal force.  

Yeah, there are all sorts of engineering problems -- I find the idea a bit
farfetched myself, but that is how it is supposed to work.

If you take a line with a mass at each end, reeled in intially so that
the masses are next to each other and so in the same orbit, and then
you reel the line out so that one mass heads planetwards and the other
spacewards, the result is something which orbits at the rate of the
centre of the line.  This is difficult to do, as the Space Shuttle
tether experiments show.  A beanstalk would be the extreme case; much
smaller lines entirely in space could conceivably be used to generate
power, sling loads into deep space, or decellerate incoming
spaceships.  To make the beanstalk (a la Red Mars), you put a
planetoid in geostationary orbit above where you want the thing to
come down, and then reel a line out in both directions.  The lines act
as counterweights.  However, if you make the spaceward line denser, or
thicker, or whatever, it doesn\'t need to go as far out as the
planetward one needs to go down.

BTW in Red Mars, the beanstalk was broken at the geostationary
planetoid: It then fell in a spectacular fashion, wrapping itself
twice around the planet, and causing a lot of damage (a great passage
in the book).  The planetoid whizzed off to Jupiter, or something like
that.  If you broke a beanstalk at the base, the whole things would
whizz out into space, although there would probably be a hell of a
sonic boom as the tail end was pulled through the atmosphere.
Tactically, I suspect the Red Mars rebels would have done a better job
if they had wiped out the anchor on the planet, so that there wouldn\'t
have been the massive collateral damage, but it wouldn\'t have been
such a vivid read!

There is a Traveller adventure called Tower Trouble in an old White
Dwarf, which details what is essentially a "great train robbery in the
sky", and is set on a beanstalk rising from Ecuador on Terra.  I think
the main reason beanstalks aren\'t prevelant in Traveller is that grav
travel is so much easier and safer; an elevator only makes sense when
the competition are using rockets.  I think the Terra Tower in the WD
adventure suggested that it was built before gravitics came of age on
Terra (about 2020 AD?), although that would make it 3000 years old!

How do you figure?  The only place they\'ve really won major 
concessions at all is that FF&S was saved.  The skill list & basic 
character classes are very CTish.  The storyline is CTish, and MM is 
even setting up several mililieu\'s to give players a choice of where 
they want to game...

Nonsense.  This game is probably going to resemble a slimmed down, 
better proofed and edited (we hope) MT or CT than TNE.

On the contrary.  IG has solicited opinions not once, but several 
times.  And last I knew, IG hadn\'t done anything to give T$R grounds 
to sue them.  :-)

That\'s too bad.  I\'m sorry to see this, I think you\'ll be missing out 
on something good.

Talk about burning your boats.  Too bad.  When you weren\'t ranting 
at people who disagreed with you, you did have some valuable insights.  

> I had hoped that I could spread the word around here that T4

Then you would be misinforming people.  All just because you\'re not 
open-minded enough to coexist with people who happen to like the 
level of detail provided in FF&S, even when the game is offering 2 
different alternative design systems of lesser complexity, all 3 of 
which will be a lot more compatible with each other than Book 2 & 
Book 5 were. 

Frankly, from what I\'m seeing and hearing I can\'t wait for my 
hardbounds to get here.  I feel that I\'ve had the opportunity to make 
my feelings known, and I think the game is picking and choosing rules 
from all previous experience.  T4 looks to me like it potentially 
could be the best Traveller ever.

Sorry to see you go.

According to Alien Module 6 - Droyne, Imperial scholars do believe that 
the Ancient homeworld is somewhere in or around the Spinward Marches.  
They base this fact on the the observation that the occurence of Ancient 
sites decreases as you move away from the Marches.  It is also the 
popular hypothesis that the Ancient homeworld was destroyed during the 
Final War.

This is not correct.  Apperantly Yaskodray (Grandfather), after 
eliminating all of his children and grand children who opposed him, 
pinched off a pocket universe and moved the Ancient homeworld into it.  He 
would emerge from his pocket universe periodically, to help the Droyne 
when they were in trouble.  The most recent apperance was when he 
introduced the coyns (sp?) to the Droyne on several worlds in several 
different system.

You missed a *vital* detail. As you lower the cable towards the ground,
you *also* let the "anchor mass" move farther out. The anchor mass,
being *farther* out exerts an *upward* force on the cable. This keeps
the "center of mass" at the geosynch point, and also keeps the cable
under tension.

Most of us have absolutely no idea whats going though MM\'s head right now.
All of this babbling on the echo here is about what we the people think is
good.  Marc could turn around tomorrow and tell us that because none of what
we\'ve said is Scottish it\'s all CRAAAAAAAAPP!!

And what was so wrong with TNE.  So far I\'ve heard little complaints with
the basic rules, character generation etc.  Everyone is whining about the
inclusion of Virus and the Destruction of the 3rd Imperium.  Personally I
think the inclusion of these things answered questions with no easy
solution.  And you can\'t blame GDW for that, read the Rebellion source book
by Marc Miller, the writting\'s on the wall then.  The Rebellion had turned
into a blood bath with no easy solutions it was evident that unless
something radical occured, something like, dare I say it, VIRUS, the war
would just drag on for centuries and the end result would be the same.  The
complete and total desruction of humanities interstellar acheivements.

T4 will not be a repackage of TNE.  Neither will it be a repackage of CT.
No one is going to be 100% happy with what occures but none of the rest of
us are willing to give up on shaping its future just yet.

No ... the asteroid isn\'t in orbit, either. 
Hang on a second, and I think I can explain it to you.

Let\'s start to build a Clarke Tower: we\'ll park a space station (or an
asteroid would work, I suppose) in geostationary orbit over the equator
somewhere, OK? 

Clearly, if the station is of any size, it\'s center of mass
is what\'s in geostationary orbit, right?  The uppermost and lowermost
extremities are not actually in orbit, you see, because they are moving with
the same speed as the station\'s center of mass.  They are, however, firmly
attached to the station, and so don\'t go flying off into space, or falling
to the ground.  If you stand at the top of the station, and let a pebble go,
it would enter a different orbit than the station was in.

Now we\'ll start building the actual tower from the station to the ground.
As we start to build, the mass of the tower on the bottom of the station
will tend to move the station\'s center of gravity down.  So, to counteract
this, we\'ll add mass to the top of the station, so that the center of mass
of the whole structure stays the same.

We keep building the tower down towards the ground, and keep adding to the
counterweight on the top of the station, until the tip of the tower reaches
the ground.

It\'s worthwhile to note that this whole thing _is_ in geostationary orbit
(even though the bottom part of the tower, on the ground, isn\'t in orbit by
itself; neither is the topmost part of the counterweight).

Once we\'ve got a firm attachment to the ground, we\'ll probably add a little
extra mass to the counterweight on top of the station.  This is so we can
increase the mass at the tip of the station (ie: the on the ground, coming
up the tower) without pulling the center of gravity of the station too low.
This will also put tension on the entire tower structure.


Arthur C. Clarke (the "inventor" of the geostationary communications
satellite) has explained the concept pretty well, and the only impediment to
actually building such a structure is the strength of the materials
required.  Structurally, Clarke Tower hangs down it\'s entire length from
orbit.  The tensile stress on the tower near the "top" (station) end is
enormous - to the point where there are no engineering materials that
you can build the tower out of (various laboratory materials indicate that
we may be able, at some point in the future, to build such a tower).

One fiction book that describes the construction of a "Clarke Tower" is
Clarke\'s _The Fountains of Paradise_; and it covers the engineering pretty
well.  He may have written non-fiction articles about it as well; I don\'t
have a bibliography handy.

The anchor mass portion is not, repeat not, in orbit, any more than the
tower portion is in orbit.

No.  The entire structure, taken as a whole, is in orbit.  Remove or
separate any portion of the structure, and the remaining portions are NOT
in orbit, and will do various strange things.

> The counterweight would have to be both higher up than the anchor and
> moving at the same velocity as the anchor and this just isn\'t possible.

Yes!  It _is_ possible, as long as the counterweight is attached to the
"anchor end" of the cable.  In order to "keep up" with the anchor end of the
cable, the counterweight has to be moving at the same angular velocity.

Since it\'s higher up than the anchor, that means it\'s moving at a higher
tangential velocity.  It\'s _also_ moving at a higher tangential velocity
than an object in orbit at the same altitude [*].  This means that it
"pulls" on the anchor (if the anchor were removed, the counterweight would
go flying up to a higher orbit).  As it is, the counterweight "pulls" on the
anchor - counteracting the downward pull exerted by the cable portion.

[*] The fundamental paradox of orbital mechanics: to slow down, increase
your velocity.  To speed up, reduce your velocity.  This is because
increasing your orbital (tangential) velocity raises the altitude of your
orbit, thereby increasing the length of an orbit (more than compensating for
the increased speed), and therefore _decreases_ your angular velocity.

Actually, if Dukes of Hazard and Miami Vice is what they picked up, 
their discovery report probably reads as follows:

"Discovered insignificant blue-green planet in the (insert alien name

    'body' => 'Hi all.  I\'d like to know what you think of this idea.  I think it might
provide a happy middle ground between those who want seperate skills for
".38 pistol, snub nose, TL8" as opposed to ".38 pistol, not snub, TL8" and
those who just want one skill called "Fighting".  

The idea is similar to Shadowrun (no! no! keep reading!  It\'s not that
bad!) where they have a fairly small list of basic skills and then allow
you to pick a specialization if you wish.  You can stay a generalist and
get level-2 skill in all firearms, or you can specialize so that you get
level-3 in pistol but level-1 in all other weapons.  

Basically, if you get skill of a particular level, you can stay a 
generalist and get that level of expertise in all aspects of the field, 
or you can specialize, getting (level * 1.5) in your specialty and (level 
*.5) in all other areas.  Specific values are open to modification, of 
course, but I\'d like to know what people think of the idea in general.

This does not make skills more complex in any way.  All one does is give a
skill description and list a bunch of suggestions for specialties at the
end of it. The GM decides when a specialty applies to any given
situation.  For instance, Medical (to bring up a hot topic), might look
like this: 

Medical:  This skill deals will all aspects of caring for the sick and 
injured, including emergency medical treatment (blah, blah, blah)...
	Specialties:  First Aid, Surgery, Ophthalmology, etc...

When playing, the GM would determine if say Dr. Bob, Medical-4 
(podiatry), could use his skill at its specialty level (6) or would have 
to use it at his non-specialty level (2).

Example:

GM:  "Well, Toby has fallen down the well and broken his ankle.  What do 
you do?"

Dr. Bob: "Toby!  I\'m coming to get you!  Hang on!"

I like this point \'Traveller needs more non-military characters\'.
However, adding more skills for the sake of \'adding more skills\'
may not be the way to go.  The current CT skill list provides
plenty of skills for strictly civilian occupations.
Still, certain technical areas could be added.  
How about \'Photography\'.

I can\'t remember if it was Alpha Centari, but several gas giant sized
planets have been found in orbit around other stars.  The real interesting
fact about these new planets is that are orbiting closer to their star
than our own systems gas giants.  Will this data efect the rules 
for star system generation?  Book 6 states that gas giants should
first be placed in outer orbits before being placed in inner orbits.
However, our own system seems to be the exception rather than the rule.

Not really.  There was Space Opera which came out probably before Traveller,
but if not, shortly there after.  It didn\'t last long.  It was very
cumbersome, the printing quality was poor (used small fonts, poorly laid
out, etc.).  Yes some people loved Space Opera.  Most picked it up, looked
at the complexity and layed it right back down.  They stepped over, saw how
clean Traveller was, the rules were simple, and it was a game that can be
played.  TSR also had Gamma World, which while it had it\'s following it did
not spring to the for front of the Sci-Fi gamer like Traveller did.

I think the problem with CT had to do with the expansion from the basic
game.  GDW produced a bunch of supplements which kept cash flow going, but
its like a computer program that is modified and modified, after a point,
its out of control, large and clunky.  If I want to go a friends house to
play Traveller I have to pack about 50 pounds of books.  The Hardback
Traveller Book was great because it condensed a bunch of the little books
into a nice portable, usable media + they added art work.

Mega Traveller would have been great had the typos not been there and if the
system had done a bit better job of taking all the CT books and condensing
them into several books i.e. collect all the skills together, make sure
thinks like the Book 2/High Guard inconsistancies are cleared up.

The artwork for MT was fantastic, the layout and printing was clear and
readable.  It is probably my favorite set of Traveller reference books to
work with until you get to almost every page has written notes transcribed
from the Errata.

TNE would have been successful had GDW printed it nicely and not altered the
basic flow of the game.  AD&D is still the same basic game as it was in
1977.  The expansions and inconsistices are cleaned up with each printing,
and lessons learned over the years go to make the game better.  There is no
doubt that the Players Handbook and Dungeon Masters Guide today are far
superior to the books produced in the late \'70s.  Yet the rules have only
been changed slightly, and then only to correct problems.

What sells a role playing game today?  

  a) Playable rules.
  b) Incredible Cover Art
  c) Incredible interior art
  d) Sharp printing (interior color helps).
  e) Everything you need to get started available Day 1.
     (not necessarily in the same book).

Vampire is not a complex game.  The game is not over run with rules.  More
time is given to telling the story than determining the diameter, spacing,
and depth of the bite wounds in millimeters.  No one cares that if a bite
from behind at 45 degrees yields a faster blood flow than a frontal bite at
87 degrees.

Take that specificly to Traveller:

I would rather have:

TL 12 Mk. 1 Laser        10d6 Damage
TL 12 Mk. 2 Laser        20d6 Damage
TL 13 Mk. 1 Laser        15d6 Damage etc.

than:

TL 12 150 MW Laser       10d6 Damage
TL 12 200 MW Laser       etc ...

The Laser wattage has no real game effects.  Why do you think Star Trek has
Type 1 and type 2 phasers [Rob visually holds up two different Phasers
showing that they look different]?  Because its something the masses relate to.

Keep it Simple.  Keep it playable.  Don\'t make things complex just because.

They did that with the Traveller Book and it was very popular.  But today
that wont cut it.  There has to be Art and a lot of it and there has to be a
heck of a story to pull you in.  (Oh, Star Wars is a simple game too.  No
need to be a nuclear engineer there....)  Its got to be clean and sharp.

As far as vehicles and starships go, how many games currently on the market
even let your build them?  I don\'t think Vampire lets you construct cars.
AD&D does not provide rules for building ships.  The Star Trek RPG didn\'t
include ship building, they had you buy pre-designed ships.  

Sounds like I am going back to support TNE which did not include design
sequences.  TNE did not have enough ship types, nor did it have deck plans,
nor did it provide tables for fixing shot-up components.  Also there were
way too many abbreviations that you had to did through text to find out what
it ment.  However, T4 Starships if done right will bring the coolness of the
day I first picked up Supplement 7 - Traders and Gun Boats, which is still
the coolest and most used Supplement that Marc put out.

I want a ship design facility, and the multi-level tier system looks fine so
far.  Only about 1/3 of the books sold will be sold to people who will care
to build ships (mostly refs and gear heads), but the other 2/3\'s would love
to have some solid designs and ready to go.  Ships are kind of like
Travellers "Monsters".  You have to have a monster manual with pictures and
descriptions available to oohhh and ahhh your players.  AD&D players dont
care how many vertibre are in the neck of a naga and Traveller players
certanly don\'t care how many cup holders are on board their starship.  "How
fast does it go?  How hard does it shoot?  Can I sneek around with it and
avoid those Imperial nastys?"

Enough ranting and raving...

If you set it up that way then yes, you\'re heading for trouble. But
at the same time you send a cable down the well you move the rock up above it\'s
original position as a balance (conservation of angular momentum). 1 point on
the cable is in orbit, but the rock is above

entire system is orbiting about it\'s centre of mass, and there is no force up or

gravity between the two endpoints, which is why it can\'t be done with current
materials.

Gamma World really doesn\'t count.  It was basically a amateurish, 
post-apocalyptic Earth setting.  As was typical of early TSR stuff, 
editing and layout were poor as well.  

I\'d forgotten about Space Opera, but if I\'m not mistaken, it came out 
after Traveller.  Someone could probably correct me on this...

Maybe I should amend the statement to say it was the first popular SF 
game.

Poor proofing on MT killed it (Especially since the two places where 
the most errors cropped up were Ship/Craft Design & Combat rules, and 
Character Generation).  I agree with you, with the errata, I liked it 
as a rules set.

I grant you that, but its a lot easier to make a fantasy RPG, and 
make it stick than SF, unless you\'re throwing out hard SF, and then 
you might as well be doing fantasy.

Yeah, but the great thing about Traveller is that it lets you design 
your own world, and ships.  Even with TNE, when the background 
was so enmeshed with the rules that it was frustrating, you could still 
chuck the preexisting background, and design your own.  How fun 
would Star Trek be without the Federation mililieu.  As for Vampire, 
I have a feeling it has already peaked.

I agree.  A clean, elegant design system, and a lot of preexisting 
ship types, with nice deck plans.  My Supplement 7 is falling 
apart...but I still use it.

But

In the Niven stories the hulls were sold by the Puppet Masters.
There was a limited number of hulls types to choose from.  I always

My hope is that you are wrong.  So I have not yet cancelled my
pre-order.  But I am going to withhold any more dollars to IG 
until I see what they are releasing.  

Last night I read some ancient magazine reviews of early CT 
products.  White Dwarf gave 10 out of 10 ratings to Adventure 3,
Double Adventure 2 and others.  What type of ratings did Next Error
receive?  I don\'t know, I never found any.  Sort of tells you 
something doesn\'t it.

Another idea sort of based on space elevators is a spinning pole.  
The poles middle (and most of its mass) is out of the planets atmosphere.
As it spins one end of it will come close to the ground.
By using any type of flight technology (including lighter 
than air) cargo and passengers could be transfered to the 
the end of the pole and pulled into space.
An equal amount of weight must be placed on the other
end of the pole for transfer to the planet and extra
thrust must be applied from time to time.

I\'ve got Glimmerdrift & Ley.  Is there \'canon\' info available on
these sectors?  It might be fun to let PC\'s \'find\' the bad data
from previous surveys, then surprise!  Heh, heh.. ;)

Why do you think GURPS Space is currently more populare than Traveller?
The StarWars RPG is entirely background based.  I\'ve never touched
Battlelords of 23rd Century so I can\'t compare it.

>If all Traveller is suppossed to be is a set of mechanics, then why

My point exactly!  Why bother including such things in the rule set!
I\'m not objecting to GDW or IG releasing suppliments or adventures
using Virus as background but I do object to them including Virus
as part of the rules!

I could take the rule books for StarWars RPG and tear out the background.
But why should I bother when there are better rule systems out there that
don\'t restrict my campaign ideas or force me to shift through several pages.

>Rebellion even be an issue?  If you don\'t like technology tied to

Jump space was never part of the rules.  Only the observible effects
of the jump drive were part of the rules.

Hopefully you woun\'t mind to much if I keep trying to convince
reader of this list that Traveller was once popular because the
rules didn\'t presuppose explanations and background.

>If you want to use the rules but not the setting, then do so.  The
>game should be tailored to suit your needs.  You don\'t like an

When an explanation I don\'t like is centeral to a set of rules then
it becames very diffucult to remove it.  Again, my point is if the 
background is mixed in with the rules and a new GM doesn\'t like the
background they are not going to like the game.

>(other than a generic one) and see if the setting can be completely

Traveller was once generic.  Traveller was also once very popular.

There was a Star Trek role playing game called Federation.  Another Sci-Fi
game called Space Opera.  T$R had a Sci-fi game (Star Frontiers??) 
that they claimed "Was the playable one".  Traveller was the first 
Sci-Fi game to attract a large market share.

Ah, but social and political reasons might be used to include them!
In my own campaign the world of Weldon has a beanstalk to showcase
their technology.  Using the stalk is a symbol of ones social standing.

Not me.  I\'ve never used the 3rd Imperium so I could care less about it.
What I\'m complaining about is the complete and total blending of 
the 3rd Imperium background with the rules for the game.

What does this have to do with a consistant, well defines, usable set
of rules?  Virus is a plot device nothing more.  Again, the Imperium
is NOT Traveller.  Even the MegaTraveller rule books claim that 
the game is called Traveller and the background of the rebellion
is MegaTraveller.

The problem we all have here is no one really knows what\'s going on with the
new rules.  It\'s all bean counting and skill arguing.  If we had an idea as
to the basic mechanics of the system worked we\'d probably all feel better,
or horrified depending upon your point of view.  I\'m not going to pass
judgement on the system though untill I actually see the beast.

I guess I"m kind of blind to the old appeal of Traveller, not having used
the old rules in many a year and having watched the GDW house system evolve
over ten years I\'m extremely comfortable with the system.  I appologize to
anyone I have offended with my over zelous defence of the TNE system.  Nuff
Said...

Actually this is not true there were rules for starship construction in

I don\'t see how Virus was enmeshed in the rules.  Sure the Virus was
mentioned in background refrence materials but whether the virus was there
or not made no difference on the task determination etc.  It was all just
background for you to use or ignore at your own discression.

Actually I got involved in a campaingn called Rom\'s in Space where we all
played Romulans.  What fun.  Calling in photon torpedo\'s for ground support.
But I digress.  I guess that would simply be a continuation of the
Federation Milieu.

I think what Stu was trying to say (we had a short discusion about this a week

Character Generation section and the Skills section, allowing any player to

I ran a game where the PC\'s were pirates.  (That\'s why I designed the 
advanced charcter generation system for pirates - the players wanted to 
play pirates, and didn\'t like the basic character generation.)  It was a 
one-scenario game, however, so didn\'t last more than a few sessions.  
This was on of the few times we got into boarding and whatnot (most of my 
campaigns were light on space travel).  

BTW, when the new Traveller comes out, I\'ll be updating my Pirates, 
Spies, and Belter character generation systems to comply with the new 
rules and take advantage of the new skills and such.  Expect that in 
August or September . . .

Charles,

It sounds like a good idea...IF what you\'re talking about won\'t mean a 
lot of new skills.  That is, if we can have a top-level skill of 
"Researcher" then a cascade of all the different areas of research, I\'m 
all for it.  But if what you\'re proposing includes the idea of having 
top-level skills like "Theology," "Computer Science," etc. with cascades 
under /then/, it would still require a massive skill list, which I oppose.

I think this could be done in the former way, so it sounds like a really 
good idea.  True, it is a departure from the way Traveller does things, 
but . . . .

\'course, since T4 is very close to going to the printer, this whole 
discussion is probably moot. :P

Lest the lists become bogged down in the pessimism recently expressed 
herein, I\'d like to let everyone know that I am very, very optimistic 
that T4 will turn out to be the system almost everyone here can agree on 
using.  There will be a few CT, MT, and T:NE hold-outs, undoubtedly.  
But I think T4 will unify the disparate factions of Traveller players, and 
allow us to work together to create better gaming experiences, to the 
greatest extent since CT.  

If T4 had abandoned FF&S entirely, a large group of players (the 
gearheads) would have been left out.  Thankfully, Mr. Golden and IG, 
along with Derek Wildstar, came up with a series of solutions that will 
satisfy all of our tastes...while allowing us to exchange designs, no 
matter which of the three ship design systems we use.  

Including FF&S in three forms was /not/ a negative thing.  It was an 
overwhelming plus for /us/.  It was an inclusive move by IG, and they 
will reap the economic rewards thereof, while we all reap the rewards of 
having a larger pool of talent (that\'s all of us!) using the same 
system, rather than three or four different, incompatible systems.

This, of course, works hand-in-hand with the multitude of Milieux that IG 
will be supporting.  No matter which of the official Traveller universes 
you like, there will be one for you...plus other, new ones! 

T4 is going to be a great product.  We\'ll each do some tweaking in our 
own campaigns, but when has that not been the case for ANY RPG?!? :)

In Adventure 12, the Droyne "Homeworld" is listed as part of Yaskoydray\'s

This was a huge problem.  I think they should have had a section near the
back for all that kind of stuff.  As opposed to sticking it right after
character generation.

Deckplans oooooooooo.  I\'ve looked through all the recently created stuff on
all the web sites.  Both TNE and MT and rarely, hell it\'s the exception
rather than the rule do people bother to include deckplans.  I personally
love deckplans, it\'s something concrete something I can hold in my hand and
say THIS is my ship.  With out a deckplan it\'s just a bunch of numbers on a
page.

Did a boarding action in a game I was playing, it got so harry one of the
PC\'s accidentally grenaded a guy in a closet.  Actually we think it was a
kid.  Ten sessions later I accidentally killed him.  Long story.  Ain\'t

I thought that the most likely candidate for Droyne homeworld was
Andory/Five Sisters.

That raises another question:  I\'ve seen the two worlds spelled differently
in various official publications.  Was there a final answer:  Andor or
Andory? Candor or Candory?

Yes, let\'s have replicants going berzerk and killing people!  Whooee! :P

Seriously, I think the cyberpunk sub-genre is pretty well covered by 
other games (TM).  Until MT, Traveller wasn\'t a "dark future" game.  With 
the breakup of the Imperium, and the Virus era, not to mention the "Heat 
Death of the Universe" milieux already planned, I don\'t think it\'s 
necessary to add yet another dark future scenario...

Just my opinion, of course. 

- -Joe

BTW, lest anyone misunderstand, Blade Runner is my favorite movie of all 
time, and I\'d love to see a RPG based on it.  I just think Traveller 
isn\'t the game for it.

Yeah, that would probably work just fine.  Quite a few folks
(scientist/engineer types) have looked at the concept in the past and
it\'s well grounded <pun intended>.  The problem is the cable has to be
made of unobtainum!  <g> The tensile strength of diamond fiber would
do it, but it\'ll be a while before we have that much diamond fiber
cable.  A beanstalk on the moon would be doable with current
technology..maybe Mars too, not *sure* about that.

>In Scotland we have a third verdict in court: "Not Proven".  This is

Sure, *nothing* is really proven until somebody does it. <g>

Here are some more ideas I\'ve run across over the last 25 years..all
very possible, all very unlikely to ever be built. The people
describing them were engineering types, and the science behind them
seemed sound.  If nothing else they\'re ideas we can incorporate into
games to give them some flavor. [Source Analog magazine]

1.  Space Fountain - Your elevator cable is composed of a framework of
semi-circular magnets (think mass driver).  Fire iron slugs up the
driver and back down to the ground.  The slugs provide support for the
framework.  Once you start, keep adding sections to the framework
driving the slugs higher and higher until you have reached a hundred
miles or so.  Attach a car to the framework and ride it to orbital
altitude. Supposedly, if this thing collapsed it would fall straight
down and not spread out.  Supposedly it would work.  (I\'ve got doubts
about this one, but I seem to recall Dr Robert Forward writing about
it.  <G>)

2.  Space Loop - Link lightweight magnetic strips into a loop a couple
of hundred miles long.  Put several strong magnetic drivers along the
strip and start accelerating the links.  As the links accelerate along
the ground centriphical force causes the top half of the loop to
elevate.  At some speed the top of the loop is above the atmosphere. 
Link in slightly more massive links as the whole thing is spinning for
increased support.  Now construct a *lightweight* framework around the
loop, and you can send a tram around to the top and back down on the
framework. You could also drop an elevator cable down from the top. 
Believe it or not, the science behind this one looks solid.  Dangerous
as ##$@!  Probably expensive as that too..but most likely doable. The
suggestion was to do this at sea down along the equator for safety
sake.  This macro-lariat idea came from some folks down at Texas A&M.

3.  The Walking Stick (Or as I call it "The Hook") - Don\'t build a
beanstalk down to the surface, instead put a relatively small station
in low earth orbit.  Extend a cable from the station from either side
and rotate the station against the direction of orbit.  The cable will
approach the ground such that the relative velocity between the cable
and the surface is only a few hundred (or few thousand) miles an hour. 
Now a sub-orbital spaceplane flys up and matches speed with the cable
(remember the cable is overtaking the earth\'s rotation), and links a
cargo pod onto the cable.  The pod rides the cable up into space as
the station pulls in both cables.  The station loses momentum, giving
it to the pod, so the station has to boost now and then to stay in
orbit, but it\'s cheaper to boost *from* orbit than to boost all the
way too orbit.  This idea is a small part of the tests the Shuttle\'s
been doing with that long cable they\'ve been extending out the bay. 
The other part of the idea is to generate electricity from that cable
extending through the earth\'s magnetic field...the station steals
momentum from the earth using the earth\'s momentum to help it maintain
orbit.  The cable doesn\'t have to actually enter the atmosphere, or be
all that long.  This one could really work, and wouldn\'t cost an arm
and leg to test out.

4.  The Space Ring - Now this one is *far* out!  Build a linked ring
around the earth in orbit.  Suborbital spaceplane flys up achieving
the altitude but not orbital speed.  Figuratively *lands* on the
ring..actually links on and uses the ring\'s momentum to pull up to
orbital velocity.  The ring maintains it\'s orbit stealing from the
earth\'s momentum.  The fly in the ointment is getting the ring in
place in the first place, and it has to be a complete ring for
structural stability.

I honestly *love* ideas like this! <g>

One was far sure and another *might* be, the report I saw wasn\'t
clear.  This really surprised me too.  What\'s a gas giant doing that
close?  Shouldn\'t the solar heat and wind driven off all that hydrogen
from the inner system?  One of the giants should be in the star\'s
lifezone too!

I doubt it.  IG has been *dead* silent on system generation, and
that\'s *my* real interest..not gloveboxes in Scout ships.  <g> The
system gen rules haven\'t changed much (any?) since book 6. My
expectation is they\'ll stay the same in T4.

>However, our own system seems to be the exception rather than
>the rule.

Too soon to say.  Some of the earlier planet sightings had giants way
out like ours are.  I\'m guessing we\'re closer to the rule than the
exception.  As the accretion disk condenses the majority of the
lighter gases are driven out of the inner system leaving smallish
metal heavy planets close in and larger hydrogen heavy planets further
out.  The break between inner and outer system seems to be where water
freezes out.

That\'s not true.  

"Early in his life, Grandfather selected a star system as a base for his
activities, and this system became the core of his pocket universe.  Of the
several planets within the system, the main one is physically nearly
identical to the Droyne homeworld and has been seeded with animals and

"nearly identical" to the homeworld, it isn\'t the homeworld.

Thus the location of the homeworld remains a mystery (for further referee
development).

There are TONS of game son the market right now.  All have rules most are
different.  Almost every one of these games also has a game background
that the game is designed for.  Without the background the game doesn\'t
always work right.  Even the supposedly Generic GURPS Space heavily relies
on the background of the Space Universe.  Sure you can modify it, but the
best selling GURPS modules, and one of the reasons of its success is the
creation of Worldbooks based on popular Sci-Fi.  Sure the rules allow for
almost anything, but GURPS sells tons of Worldbooks for a reason.

Traveller is inextricably intertwined with the Imperium.  Does this mean
that you have to set your games there?  No!  However, I have never thought
that any incarnation of Traveller was the best RPG on the market from a
rule standpoint (maybe TNE was OK, but it too had problems).  However,
what has kept me interested in Traveller is the fact that the 11,000
worlds of the Imperium even existed.  Someone mentioned Battlelords of the
23rd Century.  It is a good game.  The rules are OK, but what makes if fun
to play if the background.  Can I design one better?  If I could I would
have my own game on the market.  If you want to design your own...more
power to you.  But if you want T4 to succeed, and I am not sure that
everyone on the list feels that way at this point, then background is the
key.  Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, and Changeling are poor games in my opinion
from a rules standpoint, but from a background standpoint they are
probably the best on the market hands down (GURPS even copied them). 
Shadowrun is the same, fair rules, but incredible background.

Personally I am hopeful that T4 will be a success.  I harbor no love for
TNE over any other Traveller rule system, and IMHO no setting compares to
the Rebellion for intrigue and adventure, but I am willing to give M0 a
try at least for a bit.  I have been vary happy that IG has listened to us
on the list, and realized that TNE had DEFINITE improvements over all
prior incarnations of Traveller.  In the immortal words of Rodney King
"Can\'t we all just get along?" B-)

Waiting for T4 with baited breath so I can try and prove that Fighters are
the key to any Space Navy...

Maybe the fact that there was a section on Virus in the main

It gave deck plans for about a dozen or so standard Traveller ship 
types (Scout, Lab Ship, Far Trader, XBoat, etc), along with High 
Guard stats, and new encounter tables.  It was probably the single 
largest collection of deck plans released for the game.

Worth it if you can scrounge a copy for the deckplans alone.

Pirates have been the antagonists in several of my games, but never

I\'ll be looking for them.  It doesn\'t look like Belters or Pirates
will be in T4\'s basic set, but Agents might match your Spies.

were lowered from the skeletal torrid, and once the elevators were in, they
were used to send up more goodies (ones that couldn\'t survive cannon
launch).

Expensive, but also allows for nearly a billion persons in comfort in the
ring/torrid/satelite.

Since the cables are dropped from equidistant points, their net surfaceward
forces would roughly cancel out, leaving a situation where you simply need
to strengthen the ring. (BTW, the ring is not in in geosynch. After
construction, one use thrusters were used to slow it so that the cables
could be dropped.)

Sorry, but it *is* in orbit, because its *center of mass* is moving at
the correct orbital velocity.

Again, no. The anchor mass, if cut loose would go into a *different*
orbit, because, being *higher* than the center of mass, but moving at
the same angular velocity, it is moving *too fast* to be in a stable
orbit BY ITSELF. As part of the *system* (cable, station, more cable,
anchor mass) it will be stable.

It\'s perfectly possible. If you have a satellite in orbit, and extend a
pair of cables with weights on the end, one towards earth, the other
*away* from earth, your orbital period does not change, because your
center of mass is in the same location. But the fact that the weights
at the ends of the cables would be orbiting at different speeds if they
weren\'t attached to the cables means that they experience an apparent
"pull" away from the center (the satellite). This is the force that
causes tides!

And while we don\'t have materials strong enough for beanstalks (that
cable is under a *lot* of tension), we have *already* experimented with
tethers in space. Many satellites use them to keep pointed at the
ground. And the Shuttle did an experiment recently that was going fine
until the cable snapped.

Well, if T4 survives long enough to make it an issue, I\'m going to try
adding some alternate technologies, and even approaching a couple of
authors I see at local cons about letting their "background" get used.
(F.M. Busby has a couple of good settings: the Rissa Kerguelen
universe, and the more recent series with the Traction Drive, and the
Habegger Gates)

And I knew *no one* who used the campaign background. We rolled our own.

I just basicly group things that "work similar" together. Then the
rules mavens can decide if they want to stick my grouping into
"overgroupings". 

And no matter *what* we do, they\'ll get it wrong. I still remember
DMing D&D in the "old" days. We finally had to drag out some tourney
weapons and stick some of the players in a ten-foot wide archway
between the living room and dining room and say "ok, this is 10 feet
wide. *Show* me how you are going to get five guys with swords to fight
there...." :-)

Not quite. The hull impacted a *lot* of antimatter atoms. Finally
enough atoms had annihilated that the hull fell apart.

This was just an example of new components. 

I would also like to see rules for things above tech level 15 such

I\'m just getting back into Traveller, after several years of not playing at all

Hehe!  Yeah, boarding actions are NOT like your typical dungeon crawl. 
;)  My players found that out, too.  They got out their mapping tools, 
ready to approach it as a D&D-ish thing (remember, this was our first and 
only boarding action).  Surprised the heck out of them when the 
"monsters" (occupants) didn\'t wait patiently in their rooms for the 
players to dash in and kill them. :)  

Sounds like your boarding action was a sneak maneuver.  My players 
weren\'t so lucky.  The party to be boarded knew what was going on (they\'d 
been holed prior to the boarding), and took appropriate action.  It was 
more of a mass battle in the corridors than anything else...

This I realize, I was refering to the fact that it made no difference to Dr.

Actually I\'ve got deckplans for all these ships from different web sites.
The back of my binder is a page of ship and a page of deckplans.

An old story.  It all started when Gary Gygax, designer of AD&D, 
either left T$R, or got fired by them, or whatever it was.  Anyways, 
GDW, looking to get into the Fantasy RPG market, hired him.  Gygax 
wound up designing Dangerous Journeys for them, which was not all 
that successful for GDW.  To make matters worse, T$R claimed that 
Gygax had been working on and designing DJ when Gygax was still 
working for them.  GDW contended that he did not.  TSR wound up suing 
GDW for a pretty large sum of damages, and won.  It put GDW in a 
fiscal crunch from which they never really recovered.  Ironic, 
because Dangerous Journeys itself was not a successful product for 
them, or so I\'ve heard.

So if we\'re getting a modular ship design system for T4, how about a set of
modular deckplans to go with it? Or at the very least a supplement full of
the deckplans for the new \'standars\' designs?

I suppose it would be too much to hope that someone out there has produced a
deckplan-building tool, have they?

I don\'t understand. I haven\'t signed off on a Repackaged TNE. In fact, I am a
champion of simpler is better, playable is better. I do know that we all
benefit from having consistency in game systems so that the simpler does lead
to logically to the more complex. And I am not one to throw FF&S out just
because it is TNE.

So stick with us at least until you see the product in August. Then, if you
don\'t like it, flame us (and me) all you want.

If Agents is like Spies, that one won\'t be updated. :-)  (Which will give

Ah..nothing like having a new RPG to tweak and add to...I can\'t wait!

You\'re right, I was confused.  I didn\'t read what you wrote correctly, 
and came to the (wrong) conclusion that you wanted a CyperPunk milieu.  
My mistake.

Yeah, this would be good to have in the basic rules.  It would give 
referees a standard set of technology that could be used in settings 
beyond the Imperial maxiumum tech level.  Then again, maybe this stuff 
will be included in a future milieux that deals with something past the 
Virus era - maybe the Heat Death of the Universe milieu will have such 
technology.

I\'m sure that MM could answer this 1 better, but I believe from 
reading the text of the AOL conferences that he owns the rights to 
Imperium.  The credits say that it was Marc\'s design, so he should 
own the rights.

Marc, 

I remember reading on 1 of the webpages (something reposted from AOL, 
I believe) that IG had intentions of designing a Strategic Level Wargame for 
use with the Traveller system to fight Imperium style battles.

Are there any specific plans to rerelease Imperium, or any of the old 
Traveller related wargame titles (Invasion: Earth & Fifth Frontier 
War) or would this wargame that will be designed basically have scenarios 
to replace it..

The production of a FRP called Dangerous Journies.  Developed by the
Anti-Christ of role playing Gary Gygax.  Apparently he originally wanted to
call it Dangerious Dimensions (D&D).  Didn\'t just sue them, sued their pants
off as well as their skivies and anything else they were wearing or might
wear tommorow.

Actually they were waiting for us too.  We were in light battle dress and
they weren\'t.  Our job was to secure engineering.  You\'ve never seen so many
HE grenades used in a small environment, man was that nasty.  They\'d set up
a HMG just inside the airlock and were dug in around the bridge and
engineering.  Eventually we took the ship though, not without major
casulties, no fatalities on our side, they weren\'t so lucky.

I hand construct them.  I\'ve got a number of pregenerated components. ie.
doors beds, iris valves etc.  The problem come in working out a scale so
it\'ll all fit on one page.  It would be nice but beleive it or not Windows
Paintbrush works just fine for building deckplans.

So sayeth the voice of Marc Miller.  Marc how is the task resolution system
going to work?  This is something we\'ve all been wondering.  Just a quick
sneak peak would be nice.

Yeah, I\'ve found most of these the last couple of years since I was 
on the web. But I\'ve had supplement 7 for about 12-13 years now.  
I have high hopes that T4\'s Starships will publish deckplans, along 
with all those nifty ship designs...

It definitely gives the players a little more to envision, and makes 
the ships seem more real.  Props are always good...

My roomies used to go thru *several* xeroxed copies of the deckplan of
their ships in a gaming session. Either because they were fighting on
board, or they were trying to figure out where the battle damage was,
and how to work around it. 

You haven\'t heard real anguish until you\'ve watched a player realize
that the last hit they took wiped out his cabin, including the
battledress he\'d had so much trouble obtaining. Worst part was that the
last hit was his fault, everybody else had wanted to cut their losses
and run... :-)

Trouble is, the very positions of the stars are different! We know
*that* much from the Atlas of the Imperium, and a few other supplements
that had star maps that more or less covered that area.

I happen to *know* Keith Lofstrom, the guy who came up with this one.
He isn\'t at Texas A&M, though for all I know, he may had worked with
folks there.

The "loop" consists of a bunch of iron plates. No connection between
them. Something like this:
    +--+
    |  |
<-- |  |
    |  |
    +--+
You run them thru an evacuated tube on the ground, sort of like a mass
driver. At each end, you have *big* magnets that bend the stream
through an angle. Two sets at each end. So after going through both,
the stream is headed back to the other end, Sort of like this:

                        ->
      ----
    /                                                  \\
    ----
                        <-
It\'s around a hundred klicks between  the ends as I recall.
The reaction forces from bending the stream around require the *lower*
of each pair to be well anchored to bedrock. The upper pair "float"
supported be the thrust involved in bending the stream. They are
anchored to (kevlar?) cables to help even out any variations in thrust.

You start adding plates to the stream and extending the angled sections
of the tubing. This slowly raises the upper part of the loop. Once you
get high enough, you can can quit extending the tubing, as the air
pressure is as low as it is inside.

To use the loop, you magnetically "grapple" to the stream. As you grab
harder, it slows down and you speed up. Note that the upper section of
the loop is the slowest and it is still somewhat above orbital
velocity.  

Anyway, you just let the "drag" from the stream of plates against your
magnetic field drag you on up, and on the upper section, either boost
you to orbital velocity, or brake you. 

The worst thing that can happen is failure of one of the 4 "corner"
magnets. If it\'s the "up" magnet on the ground, you just let the steram
of plates fly through a gap in the magnet and break through a
replaceable pressure seal. They wind up in the ocean. You generate a
*lot* of steam, and rusty ocean water. :-) And you are out the energy
you invested in speeding up the plates, and the cost of the plates. The
energy is the most expensive part. The upper stations will have
parachutes. So re-erecting is an annoyance.

If the "down" ground station fails, due to the angle, you can still
dump into the ocean, but you want deeper water there.

If the ascending station on the upper portion fails, you lose a bunch
of plates, as they\'ll be above escape velocity. If the descending
station fails, you\'ll have a shitload of plates in orbit, and a fair
chance of recovering them. 

The loop concept would be well suited to atmosphere 0,1 and 2 worlds.
Beanstalks are suited to smaller worlds, regardless of atmosphere.
Tether systems (skyhooks) are workable on just about anything, but how
workable depends on details of the planetary system. Space fountains
are best for low g worlds, I\'d think. Low atmosphere would help.

Actually, as I recall from a discussion elsewhere on the net, theplanet
may *mass* as much as (or more than) Jupiter, but there\'s no evidence
that it\'s a gas giant! One of the others seems to have *some* possible
spectral data, but mostly these are detected by gravity effects alone.
So all we know is the orbit size and the mass.

Picture a "rocky" type planet with the mass of jupiter and the orbit of
Mercury or Venus! Yow!

I\'d actually hope that we can get a re-write on them. Something similar
to the three stage ship design rules. Something quick and simple for
the novice GM, something more detailed for when you need more, and
something as detailed as the scouts book (or PBH) for folks like me.
:-)

But the trick would be to make them *compatible*. The rules in the
first three books, and in the scouts book did *not* work especially
well together.

Also, as has been noted, there are some major hole in the "simple"
method unless you either assume that there are a *lot* more alien races
(to explain the low tech levels and high populations on worlds that are
"uninhabitable" by humans), or do a *lot* of handwaving. Especially if
you take stellar type into account.

Without backgound a game is just a set of rules.  But I don\'t aggree when

This wasn\'t always the case.  It\'s been true ONLY from MegaTraveller on.

So you won\'t be interested in Traveller if the Darrains destroyed another
star system and left the Imperium with only 10,999 worlds?

The fun (IMO) is not designing rules, rather it\'s designing background.
And yes I do think I can do better!

Why do you have to wait for T4?  It\'s your campaign.  If you

Another use for space tethers in around planets with magnetic fields.
A long tether can be used to generate power.  Imagine a large space

Squillion pounds??  Oh, just noticed the .uk on your header.

1)  There is no place on the USD chart to enter data on the Avionics (in

did I miss something?

2)  The tables in the QSDS system should follow a standard format.  
Rather than having the Crew column in one place in one table and in 
another in a different table, put each column heading in the same place 
on each table.  if a column heading isn\'t needed for a given table, 
obviously just put the next one to the left that is needed in its place 
and adjust the others accordingly.  I found it bothersome to have to keep 
hunting for where the volume, price, crew, etc. were located on each table.

Other than those two quibbles, it is an excellent system!  Thanks, Guy!

The following skill list is a modified version of the one the Mark Miller 
posted to the TML a while ago.  His list had 81 skills.  This one has a few 
more (total of 96 skills).  I\'ve tried to keep things basic, in light of 
several requests to KISS, but wish to say that I personally feel that 
keeping the number of skills down is unimportant.  It does not complicate 
things to have lots of skills.  One simply rolls against "Pistol, Slug" 
instead of "Firearms".  I don\'t see how this makes things any more 
complicated for players or GMs.


SPECIALIZATION 
For those of you who prefer a more detailed skill system, I suggest an
optional "specialization" rule, whereby one can pick a more specific area
within a discipline and recieve 1.5 * skill level (round down) in it while
recieving only .5 * skill level (round up) in every other aspect of that
skill.  Some GMs may wish to make this rule mandatory for some or all
skills.  At the same time, some GMs may wish to make specialization
unavailable for some or all skills. 

Note that the "specialization rule" also helps to resolve several 
controversies that have flared up on the list.  First Aid can now be a 
specialization of Medical, Theology a specialization of Philosophy, and 
so on.

Another advantage of the specialization rule is that it allows seamless 
creation of new skills by simply making them specializations under 
existing skills.  There will be no need to re-invent a bunch of tables 
every time you want to add new skills to the character generation system.

Okay, enough with the blather, here\'s the skill list.  As always, I would 
like to get as much feedback as I can.  Let me know what y\'all think!

(Also, let me know if this two-column format comes out readable).

SKILL LIST:

** Indicates a "new" skill that was not on MM\'s posted list.

# Indicates a skill which has been modified from MM\'s posted list.  i.e., 
the skill\'s name/scope has been changed, or it is now  part of a group of 
skills which represent what was a single skill on MM\' list.


***WEAPON SKILLS (17)*************************

Archaic Ranged Weapons #	Artillery
Automatic Weapons #			
Blade, Short #			Blade, Long #
Club, Heavy #			Club, Light #
Energy Weapons **		Firearms #
Flail **
Gunnery				Heavy Weapons
Laser Weapons **		Sonic Weapons **
Neural Weapons **		Throw
Unarmed Combat#			Polearm #

Notes:
	- Weapon skills should be understood to include high-tech 
variants (vibroblades, monofilament flails, stun sticks, gauss guns, etc.).
	- Gun combat and Blade combat have been reorganized to eliminate 
the need for cascades.  In terms of character generation, there will be 
need for Skill Clusters like in MegaTraveller.
	- Fencing is a specialization of "Blade, Long".
	- Archery has been replaced with the broader "Archaic Ranged 
Weapons" so that it can cover slings and such as well.
	- Armorer is a specialization under Craftsman (or Repair?).
	- Brawling and various martial arts are specializations under 
Unarmed Combat.
	- Several weapon skills which were not included on MM\'s list have 
been added for completeness (lasers, energy weapons, neural weapons).


***MILITARY SKILLS (7)*************************

Battledress			Demolitions
Hostile Enviro. Combat#		Forward Observer

Tactics

	-Environment combat is now "Hostile Environment Combat", which is 
clearer and has a cool acronym (HEC).
	-Recruiting has been added.  
	-Combat engineer is a specialty under Design.
	-Camouflage is a specialty under stealth.

Ooooh...major carnage.  Sounds like on heck of a session, though.  :)

I\'m glad to hear you say that.  I must admit, as a simpler is better sort of
person (despite my notoriety for my MT design collection), the sudden influx 
of FF&S messages in my mailbox last week was a little worrisome.  Already
owning everything from DGP and GDW for CT and MT, I\'m still a little reluctant
to commit to buying the hardback T4 sight-unseen, but I\'m keeping an open 
mind.....

:>I think that the most likely candidate for drag is going to be the effect

:I shouldn\'t have used the term "drag" - I meant it in the loose rather than
:technical sense.  The cable isn\'t being pulled through the planet\'s

:with the same angular velocity as the planetary surface.

   Methinks you misunderstand the concept of Beanstalks.

   Now, I hope you understand the basics of orbital mechanics, but just in
   case here\'s arefresher.

   Objects stay in orbit by going just fast enough (but no faster) to be
   continually racing against gravity. Gravity pulls on the object, and
   the object travels *just* far enough that the amount that it falls
   matches the curvature of the planet. Orbital mechanics is influenced
   by a number of factors; gravity, the size/density of the planet being
   orbited, and the amount of drag encountered (primarily a concern at
   lower altitudes, say less than 150km) Gravity varies (using the inverse
   square law) depending on the distance from the planetary surface. This
   means that objects closer to the planet have to orbit faster.
   Clear so far?

   Knowing this much, a couple of things become obvious:

   1) Objects in orbit can match the rotational period of the planet in
      *only* one orbital band. (In Earth orbit, this is approximately
      20-25k miles)

   2) Objects matching the rotational period of the planet, but *closer*
      will fall from orbit. Objects matching the rotational period of the
      planet, but *farther* will leave orbit and fly away.

   Now picture this:

   A space station is put into orbit where it can match the rotational
   period of the planet. This space station has two reels of _very_ strong
   cable inside. Two BIG counterweights are attached to these LARGE reels of
   cable. Start reeling these cables, one leads DOWN to the planets surface,
   the other leads OUTWARDS into interplanetary space.

   Two things begin happening almost immediately:

   1) The LOWER counterweight is going _slower_ than it needs to be to
      stay in orbit, it will tug downwards on the space station. The
      farther down it goes, the harder it pulls.

   2) The HIGHER counterweight is going _faster_ than it\'s needs to be to
      stay in orbit, it will tug upwards into space. The farther out it
      goes, the harder it pulls.

   Keep going until you reach the surface.

   The biggest problem we face to construct a Beanstalk is NOT the orbital
   mechanics, but the sheer strength of the materials needed to withstand
   the stresses of such a construct. The two cables will have to be about
   50K miles total, and will not only have to carry the load it\'s lifting
   to orbit, but it will have to be strong enough to support itself, and
   that\'s no mean feat!

   You will also notice that *any* kind of failure in the structure is
   disastrous. The parts of the structure leading down to the surface are
   travelling *less* than orbital velocity. If a terrorist group planted a
   bomb on an elevator, and blew it up halfway up the stalk, the lower half
   of the cable would drop and hit like a bomb. Worse, it would be long
   enough to wrap itself around the Earth hitting a VERY large area and
   virtually certain to blast a large chunk of the ocean into the atmosphere
   causing some serious and longlasting problems with the ecosphere. (eg,
   nuclear winter or greenhouse effect - take your pick)

Classic Traveller was not intertwined with the Imperium.

Ah but the problem with the game system embedded with the rules is that
you have to do alot of work to extract it. 


Traveller has more structure and more defined things than GURPS does. Its
alot easier to design a game in Traveller since certain technology 
decisions have already been made by the game. I think that the Imperium
background is interesting, but I don\'t want it shoved down my throat so 
I can play a game.

Not a wise idea. The energy you get that way is subtracted from your
orbital velocity! On the other hand, if you have an independent power
source, you can use properly configured tethers to (slowly) boost your
velocity.

I can see it now:

IRS NPC:  Mr. Starkiller, we need to talk about your allowances for 
ships expenses.  For example, this set of receipts here... it looks like 
you\'ve been funneling money from the employee\'s pensions to the 
Ship\'s shadow fund for years...and all these deductions for ship\'s 
maintenance...I was not aware that a ship needed maintenance 6 times 
a year...

the airlock...without a vacc suit?

If there were so many HE grenades used in the ship corridors, how was 
collateral damage IN engineering explained away?

Remember in Milieu 0 this end of the galaxy is just coming out of a
*long* dark age.  There are going to be lots and lots of planets at
TL7-10..right?  There are going to be planets that have NOT developed
gravtic technology, but have spread out across their system.  In fact,
there\'s nothing I know that links J-Drive tech to gravtics, so there
could be pocket empires out there with no gravtics.

So, on worlds like those beanstalks or space loops might make a *lot*
of sense..right?  

Even after the new Imperium drops by with gravtics, the good old stalk
will still be there and still be used.

Not to mention how useful deckplans are when you have shipboard
combat.  To me a ship design without a deckplan isn\'t finished yet!

Of course, a main world without the rest of the system laid out isn\'t
finished yet either. <g>

off worlds and suns.  Could we not therefore say that the effectiveness of
T-plates drops with distance from these bodies?  This would put some sort 
of limiting factor on speeds, would it not?  For instance, you could not 
"accelerate in from pluto" because you would lose thrust as you moved 
away from the planet.  You\'d drift until you came across another body to 
push against.  

This might also solve the problem of conservation of energy.  Simply say 
that by some mumbo-jumbo the the ship robs momentum from the world it is 
pushing against.

I haven\'t thought through the specifics of this, so feel free to bash away.  
I\'m sure this has been brought up before, but I don\'t remember the 
conclusions reached.

Happy Travelling,
Charles.

In a way, yes.  But, heck, was Gygax supposed to never write another FRPG 
again?  Never write an RPG of any type again?  

Let\'s assume Gygax left TSR, THEN decided to come up with a new FRPG 
because he felt that not being saddled with the traditions of D&D, and 
having quite a bit more experience at writing RPG\'s than he had when he 
originally started, would allow him to make a really great product.  He 
contacts GDW, and they agree to publish it, since he is a "name" and they 
like the idea of filling out their line with a FRPG.  

If something like that was the case, what should they have done in order 
to avoid giving TSR ammunition?  Should Gygax be barred from making 
FRPG\'s?  If so, TSR should have paid him to agree to that (it\'s been done 
- - Nolan Bushnell, the man who founded Atari, signed a five-year non-competition 
agreement with Warner Communications when they forced him out).  

Unless TSR had evidence that Gygax had worked on the game while he was in 
their employ - using TSR\'s facilities, equipment, supplies, and/or time - 
then they had no basis for their claim.

This is all speculation, of course.  It\'d be great to know what really 
happened.

Actually, in a lot of businesses, this is pretty much SOP.  In my 
last job, my boss, (basically, a middle manager), was forced to sign 
a non-compete clause.  I would imagine that Gygax, as a top level employee, 
probably did get to sign a non-compete, but I don\'t know for sure...

Of course, non-compete clauses are not always enforcable either, 
courts have nullified them under some circumstances.  I don\'t know 
the specifics of the case, but I\'m sure TSR\'s contention was either: 
A) He was working on it while he was at TSR (in which case it could 
be intellectual property of TSR); or B) It borrowed or infringed on 
TSR\'s previously held copyrights.  I would suspect that TSR contended 
a little of both.

True...

I agree.  It\'d be good to hear the tale from GDW\'s side.  I\'m not 
really all that interested in TSR\'s story, as I consider them to be 
the 500 lb. gorilla in the RPG market...  I\'m sure that they just 
crushed GDW\'s hopes with money.

...which is rather bizarre, as the likelihood of ANY FRPG, including one 
by Gygax, eclipsing the D&D franchise is next to nil.  If you mentioned 
the name of any RPG to the average person on the street, you\'d get no 
recognition of the brand name - unless you say, "D&D" or "Dungeons and 
Dragons."  TSR has played that franchise well, considering the whole 
role-playing industry caters to a fringe group.

Anybody else remember the old Dungeons and Dragons ads that would 
air at Christmas time many years ago?  

Remember JC Penney selling TSR products, including D&D and Dungeon?  They 
also sold some Grenadier models.  This was back in 82-83.  

Man, if IG  and FFE could get the Traveller name out there like Marc has 
been talking about, there\'s no limit to the sales potential.  Which 
brings up a point I worry about: popularity generally means the product 
has been homoginized beyond the point where I can continue to enjoy it.  
Will the traditional Traveller be something the masses want, once they 
are made aware of it via TV, movies, and books?  Or will it be necessary 
to dilute the product in order to gain that mass audience?

No, actually, it\'s more like Gygax ALONE gave TSR the ammo.  GDW didn\'t 
know that Gygax had worked on the game while he was still at TSR.

The way I understand it, TSR had proof that Gygax had come up with the 
concept of DJ while he was still at TSR.  From what I understand, that 
was the basis for their suit against GDW and Gygax.

Since I intended one of the 400-ton hulls for this purpose, I\'m glad you

A couple of comments about your design:

                                ^^^^^
Confusing terminology time: In the QSD System, I consistently used
Displacement Tons as my unit of volume.  I hate converting from cubic meters
(or "kiloliters" for those of you brought up on MT) to displacement tons and
back again.  For the QSD System, the larger units made more sense, so I used
them exclusively.  UNfortunately, the USD is supposed to give the ship\'s
volume in _both_ systems.  "Tons" in the USD refers to volume in displacement
tons (just like in the QSD System), but "Volume" in the USD refers to volume
in cubic meters (an alien concept to the QSD system).

SO, for QSD System users, the USD Volume is USD Tons times fourteen.
In your case, this is 5600.

> 00 Fire Control Rating		03 G Rating / Heplar
  ^^
I can tell that one of the captain\'s first targets will be to score a set of
military-specification laser batteries.  The master fire directors included
with those will increase the ship\'s fire-control rating, giving it a +3 to
hit, and enabling the ship to engage 3 targets at once (both of which are
important to a pirate).

                                ^^^^^^^^^^
Power plant rating is 2 times MW divided by displacement; rounded to the
nearest whole number.  In the case of your corsair, this works out to 3.

Yes.

Neither one makes a difference in the combat of the ship, so neither one
appears in the USD display.  The avionics type can be inferred from the
Control section of the USD: "fib" indicates military avionics, and the TL 
should be the TL of the ship.  If the avionics differ for some reason
from the normal assumption (and the corsair\'s don\'t), then it should be
noted in the description.

The communications don\'t appear in the USD at all; you should note them in
the description somewhere.

> 2)  The tables in the QSDS system should follow a standard format.  

You\'re right, they should.  I didn\'t even _think_ of this \'till someone
noticed it.  For what it\'s worth, they\'re in whatever order they came out
of my spreadsheet in (which usually indicates the order that the columns
appeared in FF&S).

I doubt that there\'s anything I can do about the copy that was typeset this
week (except hope that this change occurred to Don as well as you), but I\'ll
update the copies I maintain ASAP.  That way it can be corrected on the Web
site, and maybe for the second printing of MMT.

Yes, sorry.

You\'re welcome!  Can I post the (corrected) corsair on my Web site?

Ah, nice! :)

Thank goodness! I\'d meant to request comments in my post, but I left that

have no experience with FF&S, I figured there\'d have to be some errors!

Ahhhh....now I get it. :)

I realize it\'s too late for the version to appear in MMT, but \'twould 
have been nice to have a column giving that value (yeah, it\'s a simple 
calculation, which is even explained in the QSDS text, but still....).

Sounds reasonable.  Again, being unfamiliar with FF&S, and having limited 
descriptions in QSDS (no quibble there - that sort of detail should be in 
the combat section, which I didn\'t download) I didn\'t have much guidance 
on what sort of weapon system to put in.  So I just stuck to what the 
Supplement 4 description gave in Book 2 terms.  I\'d definitely add the 
military-specificaton laser batteries if I were designing the Corsair again.

Yup.  As I said in my email to you, I read that sentence in QSDS several 
times after I got the fractional answer, and always came up reading it as 
/divide by 2/.  Sheesh!  :)

Cool.  I\'ll download it again then.  Now that you\'ve corrected my errors 
and given me some more insight, I can more confidently do some more ship 
designs!

Yes, please, that would be great.  If you could add the military-type 
batteries that\'d be excellent as well.

That was rather naive of Mr. Gygax, then.  I work at a holding company\'s 
corporate offices - where absolutely no products are designed or created, 
only accounting and financial functions are performed - yet even I had to 
sign an agreement stating that using company time, facilities, equipment, 
etc. for personal or personal business uses could, at the company\'s 
option, result in: termination, company acquisition of any economic 
benefit derived from such activity, company acquisition of any products, 
services, or entities derived from such activity, etc. etc.  

It\'s sad that GDW had to suffer for EGG\'s mistake.

	The Corsair, and armed raiding ship, is mostly used by Pirate 
characters.  Notable features on the corsair are large cargo doors and 
variable identification features.  The large clamshell doors can open to 
reveal the entire cargo bay.  The ship has several centrally controlled 
identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the 
ship is a non-commercial type.

Yup.  Once in a while I\'ll bring in some Traveller books and work on 
my campaign on my lunch hour.  People will take a look at the books 
and wonder what it is.  I\'ll explain it\'s an SF RPG.  They\'ll give me

Weeeellll, let\'s not get too enthusiastic.  The golden age of RPG\'s, 
when even Aunt Betsy was buying D&D books, is about 10-12 years 
behind us.  Probably the best shot to get it in front of a larger audience 
would be novels and computer games...both of which reach into a little 
less of a fringe market, anyways...

Unless I miss my guess, Traveller: The Motion Picture is not coming 
to a theater near you...at least not in the near future anyways...

This I didn\'t know, although I wondered.  It would make sense that if 
GDW had known, they would have stayed about a million miles away from 
Gygax...

===================
Issues:
1.  The Avionics and Communications thing mentioned earlier.
2.  The inconsistent ordering of columns in the tables.
3.  The Crew issue.  Using the "standard" QSDS caclulcations, I had a crew 
of 12 before I began rounding down and assigning two jobs to other people. 
(5 Engineers, 2 Maneuver, 2 Electronics, 1 Medic, 1 Steward, 2 Command).  
The guidelines for combining crew positions and reducing crew size for 
smaller vessels is too sketchy.
4.  Miscellaneous Equipment.  The Shops and Labs section needs more info: 
are Engineering Shops, Vehicle Shops and Sickbays mandatory when you have 
enough engineers, small craft or medics?  How does the mass/volume of small 
craft effect a ship when in External grapples?  Does this add to the volume 
of the ship when calculating Jump and Maneuver Drive volume?
5.  The Universal Ship Description.  This needs to be clarified.  It could 
use an example.
The Controls section probably is where the Avionics/Commo info would be, but 
that is unclear.
6.  The Jump-2 drive in the Far Trader only added 200,000 Cr to the cost and 
no extra crew.  This seemed a bit odd to me (though not all that bad).

Overall, it took me about 45 minutes to do a design on pen and paper.  I 
then spent about 15 minutes creating a simple spreadsheet, and now it takes 
about 10 minutes per ship.  I have about 5 other designs, which I\'ll post 
this evening or tomorrow.

Well, actually a lot of people _do_ buy GURPS for the rules (you may
not be aware, but a lot of people, possibly the majority, of GURPS
players use worlds not in any supplment).  However with that
disclaimer I agree with you.  There are a lot of rules out there
and without a radically different approach, Traveller isn\'t
going to win a lot of people just to use it\'s rules.

Games like Hero and GURPS are in a different situation since they
offer rules that can be used for more than just one genre.  For
Traveller to compete on this basis they would have to racially
change the scope of the rules.

Actually, this explanation doesn\'t work.  Any time you got more than
a few light minutes away from a planet your delay would start causing
problems.  Also, in many situation you are  going to have to try using
nearby stars which will not only have delays of years before it
takes effect, but would be impossible because you wouldn\'t be able
to collumate a beam of gravitons sufficiently.

You might as well just do what was done in Classic Traveller.  Ships
have "manuever drives" which are reactionless, and leave it at that.
That\'s what I do with my Traveller (though I never liked thruster
plates, they reduce what could be an interesting situation with
side effects and unexpected uses to a cold sterile, "the ship moves").

Yaay!  Can\'t wait to see the corrected versions.  I was just looking at 
Supplement 7, trying to decide whether to do a Far Trader next or not.  
Now I can go on to something else . . . (though, methinks there is going 
to be a flurry of QSDS ship designs, so I\'d better do it sooner than 
later...grin).

Agreed.  Must be a standard thing under FF&S, though, since QSDS is a 
derivative work.  But, the huge jump in the number of crew members 
bothered me, too.  That means either more NPC\'s, or more player 
characters.  Neither sounds like a good idea to me.

Depends on what you mean.

I have a set of standard items created in SuperPaint.  When I\'m detailing a
room, I just copy-&-paste them in.

Admitedly they look a bit low-tech, because I started doing this in colour
for Space 1889, and haven\'t put a lot of time into conversion.

Now, if a kind artistic soul was to email me some 300 dpi PICT (or GIF or
TIFF) top-view images of beds, fresher cubicles, control consoles... I could
quickly convert all my deckplans to gloriously coloured masterpieces :-)

Seriously, though, I\'d be willing to do a lot of the drawing is someone could
create nice fittings.  My current standard is 2 yards/metres to the inch with
no squares draw on the plan.  Instead, I place a small red cross (0.25 in) at
the centre of the square.  This is less obtrusive, and also means that narrow
corridors don\'t look strange.

I think Matt has some of my 1889 deck plans at the heliograph site.  Check
them out for an idea of what I\'m talking about.

I\'m terribly sorry to have to re-re-post this.  I created a ship design 
spreadsheet, and found that when I made the change to military lasers I 
had not performed the calculations correctly.  So, the cargo and cost 
values have changed.  Again, I\'m very sorry for posting this three times.

(My excuse: I\'m on the last couple of days of my Honeymoon; designing 
ships and doing calculations probably isn\'t a very good idea, considering 
the ... er...distractions I\'m facing. :)

========

Here is the corrected QSDS Corsair.  I added the standard military laser 
batteries, but this bumped the cost up quite a bit, of course.  I also 
added a short description, mostly cribbed from Supplement 4.  (Although I 
did change the mention of retractable fins, modules that "appear and 
disappear," etc. as I wasn\'t sure how well that would mesh with a 
detailed design system like FF&S.) 

Under "Cost" I have given the full price, with the discounted price (for 
using off-the-shelf components) in perenthesis.

Crew Detail: 6 Engineers, 7 Electronics, Pilot, Astrogator, 3 Gunners,
	     3 Command.

	The Corsair, and armed raiding ship, is mostly used by Pirate 
characters.  Notable features on the corsair are large cargo doors and 
variable identification features.  The large clamshell doors can open to 
reveal the entire cargo bay.  The ship has several centrally controlled 
identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the 
ship is a non-commercial type.  
	The crew, as with any craft, may be smaller in actual use.  The 
Captain may choose to have some individuals performing more than one 
function.  For instance, the Command positions may be filled by a senior 
Engineer, a senior Electronics specialist, with the Captain also being 
the Pilot or Astrogator.  The actual number of Engineers and Electronics 
specialists (including those also filling a Command position) may not be 
decreased without increasing the likelihood of equipment failure.

It gets worse...my bride is an RPG and videogame nut, so there has been 
more time spend on these things by both of us during our honeymoon than 
would probably be considered healthy by any rational person.  Than God I

Since Carole, my new wife, is busy with the new videogame I bought her as 
a bridal present, I decided to try my hand at another ship design before 
getting back to more important matters [G].  I tried to be very careful, 
and I double-checked my work, so I hope this one won\'t require re-posting.

First, I\'ll give the stats on the ship, then a ship description, and 
finally a little discussion of the QSDS system and some other design notes.

Crew Detail (Standard): Engineering-2, Electonics-1, Pilot-1, Astrogator-1,
			Gunner-2, Commander-1, Medic-1, Steward-1

Crew Detail (Minimum) : Engineering-2, Electronics-1, Gunner-2,
			Pilot/Astrogator/Commander-1, Medic-1, Steward-1

(Note: The Medic and Steward may be foregone if no passengers are carried.)

==========================

The Secure Trader is designed for use in transporting goods and 
individuals to and from hostile areas, as well as transporting goods and 
individuals that have a high probability of attracting hostile 
attention.  Since a much higher price can be commanded for such 
transportation, this Trader is capable of making a profit for its owner 
in spite of the higher price in comparison with the more commonly used 
Far Trader.

The main causes of the high price of this ship are the weaponry and the 
hull, both of which exceed the standards for trading vessels.  However, 
they also allow the Secure Trader to survive in situations that would 
destroy the standard Far Trader.

While the small staterooms have been designed with the crew\'s use in mind 
(excepting the Captain), Travellers experienced with this sort of ship 
have found it sometimes necessary to have the crew double-up in large 
staterooms because a passenger\'s social sensibilities require that his or 
her retenue use smaller accomodations than are used by his- or herself.  
With eight large staterooms and nine small staterooms available, it is 
possible to come up with many variants of crew and passenger arrangements 
able to please even the most discriminating passenger.  In addition, if 
no high passengers are available at a given port, the Captain can always 
sell middle passage and allow the crew to use the high passage staterooms 
(doubling up or not, as the situation warrants).

Not every Traveller will desire a Secure Trader, but for those who have a 
true sense of adventure, it can bring rewards rarely seen by the timid 
captains of standard trading vessels.

============================
Design Notes:

This is the type of ship my former players (back in CA) would have loved 
to use.  I figure there must be others out there who would like such a 
ship, so I designed it.  Hopefully, you\'ll find it useful.

QSDS Notes:

I found a couple of typos in the QSDS.  The Standard Military Laser 
Batteries chart has a colum for Price, which should be labeld Cost to 
keep it the same as the other charts.  The same goes for the Standard 
Civilian Laser Batteris chart.  
The Standard Sensor Systems chart has a typo under the Improved TL 12 
sensor system\'s USD.  The other entries in the column go Ax Px Jx, but 
this entry is ordered Ax Jx Px.  Given the values involved, I assumed the 
J and P had been transposed, but the values had not.  But, I really can\'t 
be sure.


Anyway, I hope a use for my design is found.  If someone comes up with an 
improvement, please let me know.

        I\'d say the vast majority of are GURPS users are not using any of
the published backgrounds.  The historical and licenced ones are of limited
interest (except the White Wolf conversions), and the two original ones
haven\'t done well.
        Of course Traveller did start as a generic SF game...just try
finding any mention of the Imperium in the original set.  It would actually
handle C. J. Cherryh\'s universe quite well.  (Considering her first book
came out around the same time as Traveller, I sometimes wonder....)
        Anyway, even though the rules have stood the test of time better
than anything else of comparable age, for me the setting is the main
attraction.  Epic scope, all sorts of adventures, interesting alien
races....  The Library Data is such a good way of presenting information I\'m
surprised I haven\'t seen anyone copy it.

        By the way, I\'m new here, what precisely is QSDS?

James,

QSDS is the Quick Ship Design System, which was created by Guy Garnett 
(AKA Wildstar@qrc.com) in response to a ...er...mild disagreement that 
occurred recently between those who want a system like Fire Fusion & 
Steel (very very detailed) for designing ships, those who want something 
like High Guard (somewhat detailed), and those who want something like 
Book 2 (very simple) to be used with T4/MMT.  It turns out that Imperium 
Games will re-release FF&S, better edited and with a new name, for T4 
at some point, but will be including something called FF&S Light 
(designed by David J. Golden) in their Starships supplement (this is the 
high-guard type system, fully compatible with FF&S), and Quick Ship 
Design System (the Book 2 style system) will be in the basic rules book for 
Marc Miller\'s Traveller.  

This way, thanks to David Golden and Guy Garnett\'s game design abilities 
and dedication to the game, as well as IG\'s open policy for customer 
suggestions, everyone should have a system that is right for them...and 
all systems are compatible with eachother.

QSDS is available online at http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/  (there\'s more 
to the direct URL, but that will get you to Guy\'s home page, and you can 
get to QSDS from there).  FF&S Light is on David Golden\'s web page, but I 
don\'t recall the link right now. :(

my ship, I have installed thrusters with extensive battery banks so it can
operate with its fusion plant shut down, the asteroid is nickel-iron with 
carbonaceous coating to absorb light, and the thruster radiator fins are 
recessed into a crater at the back of the asteroid so its EM signature is 
reduced. Other features (EM arrays, weapon bays, airlocks, fighter/small craft 
launch tubes, the spinal mount) are also recessed into craters in the surface

Any ideas/ship designs rattling around out there?

Gee, that\'s gonna cause a revolution in math! The biggest number I can
think of is C. That\'s the tranfinite number that *may* be aleph-2. It\'s
the number of "curves" that can be drawn in a plane ("curves" because

If you want a "less pleasant" game, I just came up with a scary
thought. 

Near as I can tell without being cleared for such high security
material, it should be possible to cross Traveller with Paranoia! Heck,
you could just call it a *weird* strain of "the Virus". 

Now *that* would a strange game!

That is absolutely true. If you use the term, "Role-Playing Game," people
have no idea what you\'re talking about. If you say, "You know, like
Dungeons & Dragons," immediately the realization of what you\'re talking
about crosses their face, and they wonder why you, as a grown man (in
my case), are playing games meant for pimply-faced adolescents. The
general public doesn\'t realize that this is the hobby of many people, and
that a whole industry supports it.

Yup. I got my first (and my last :) copy of Dungeons and Dragons from
Jamesway (a now-bankrupt department store, like Kmart) when I was a
kid.

I don\'t think so. I was always a fan of Star Trek, even before the movies.
Now that it has exploded in popularity, I\'m extremely happy, because that
means that Paramount feels it is worth it to pump more money into the
project. So when I once had only 76 original-series episodes to watch,
now I\'ve got the original series, 7 movies, and three TV series to watch,
and another movie is coming out in November. I\'ve got a copy of the Star
Trek RPG (original version--which I believe also came out of the JC Penny
catalog in about \'82), and I get the Star Trek Communicator magazine.
That\'s enough for me, but there\'s a ton more Star Trek stuff out there I
could get involved in (I\'ve never been to a convention) if I felt it was
worth the time. Because of its popularity, I can now immerse myself in
Star Trek. And it hasn\'t been diluted one bit. There\'s still the same
techno-speak there always was. If anything, it\'s been expanded.

Wouldn\'t you enjoy it if the same thing happened to Traveller? If
somebody didn\'t know what a RPG was, and you said to them, "You
know, like Traveller." Or to have Traveller novels, TV series, movies, etc. I
think that would be fantastic! And the point is, it can happen. If Paramount
could do it with Star Trek, which is sort of pseudo-military based, don\'t
you think it could be done with Traveller, which can focus more on the
non-military-type adventures? I think it can, and I think it will.

This is great stuff for conspiracy theorists:

What if (tongue placed firmly in cheek) TSR and Gygax plotted the demise
of GDW all along? Gygax would get fired, but would leave "evidence"
either in his user directory on the network, or in a file cabinet
somewhere, that he had worked on the FRPG while at TSR. Maybe just a
preliminary outline would do it. GDW jumps at the chance to have Gygax
design a game for them. The network administrator "finds" the outline in
Gygax\'s user directory when he deletes his account at TSR, and the rest
is history.  :-)

How could the computer be in charge if it does not have FTL travel. All
you need is one or two rebel X-Boat pilots to screw up the transmissions
between the computers.

There\'s nothing better then having players involved in a boarding action who
say.  Okay we\'ll call up the standard deckplans.  Fine.  They run aboard and
the deckplan is diffenent because the owner has modified it heavilly over
the last twenty years.  The looks on their faces a priceless when they find
a wall where a corridor should be.  8)

Right.  Imagine me as I appear during my lunchbreaks sometimes - 
a grown man, wearing a three-piece suit, reading Traveller books.  To 
the average person, a "serious businessperson" such as myself should 
never be engaged in such "childish, frivolous" pursuits as role-playing 
games.  Little do they know that more thought goes into the average 
Traveller campaign than most "serious businesspeople" spend on their 
personal lives as a whole. ;)   

The detail work involved in doing any of the major functions of a 
Traveller referee (world/star system bulding, ship design, etc.) would 
surprise most people.  Our little secret is that it is such enjoyable 
work! :)

It was evil, and that\'s probably the best word to describe it.  EVIL.  But
we were doing good, the priate was attacking a merchant, and well they won\'t
be offering evidence at any trial that\'s for sure.  I\'d do it again in an

No, but Gygax was working for the CIA at the time...and knew Jack

Actually that wasn\'t a problem.  They\'d set the powerplant on overdrive and
blew the ship up.  After we got the hell out of there of course.  In
Engineering we never used anything bigger than an SMG and we did remarkably
little damage, we didnt\'t miss a shot that time.  However, the powerplant
was to far gone by the time we got there.

I can gloss through the system but if there isn\'t a main world map I\'m
ripping my hair out.  It\'s horrible you wouldn\'t want to see it, I\'m a very

I\'ve allways assumed that the tech level of a world rated the worlds

Actually I always thought that the idea of a genetic engineering computer
gone mad creating all kinds of horrific lifeforms and releasing them into a
controlled environment, then trapping the characters in that place would be
pretty scarry.  Kind of TNE meets alien meets predator meets the terminator
meets dark conspiracy meets call of chuthulu.  Brrrrrrr.....

Trouble is, the very positions of the stars are different! We know *that* much
from the Atlas of the Imperium, and a few other supplements that had star maps
that more or less covered that area. <<

While the opportunity for a comment like that was wide open, I thought
we could avoid the whole mess through proper application of taste and

if you want to take over/control/economically benefit from a battle, the
cheap, kill \'em all attitude is a failure. You\'ll spend more re-building,
re-propagandizing survivors and your own people than the cost of a landing
and precision bombing, even tho the latter has a higher initial cost.

If you want to simply eliminate the opposition, DK\'s and nukes are the way
to go. But you still must convince at least those doing the attack that it
is the right thing to do, and then survive the inevitable political
backlash when word leaks out. (And, yes, no matter how black the op, word
WILL eventually leak out).

IMHO:

Drop troops are for securing an LZ for less mobile troops, despite R
Heinlein\'s Mobile Infantry. Traveller Drop troops are not RH\'s MI, despite
the obvious insiration therefrom. MI were in existance to fight the bugs.
Traveller has few bugs (Noted ones include the Chamax), but lotsa DT\'s.
DT\'s are a cross between paratroopers, spetznaz, and Ogre/GEV (by SJG)
infantry: light, fast, practically invulnerable to non-power-armored trops,
and victims of tanks in direct fights. they are as mobile as infantry, with
the ability to survive hostile environments, but a tank can kill them with
frightening efficiency (See MT, striker or striker II). they hit dirt
between 5 and 15 minutes from orbit drop, and saturate a small area, and
hold until reinforced by landing ships, some 10 to 30 minutes later. then
they reinforce the tanks. They often are grav-capable, so they can keep up
with  non-grav tanks well enough, and a combined landing force of DT\'s and
grav tanks is quite potent, as well as capable of a wide range of action.

their expense makes them the beach head takers, and the other (army) troops
follow them in.

First and foremost a marine, first and foremost a DROPTROOP!

Good for you!  I may be a heretic, but IMNSHO, every GM decides in
what *universe* his/her game takes place.  The GM can choose to accept
or reject *anything*..even what some people call canon. Maybe
*especially* what some people call canon!  <g>

I can gloss the system too, but I *hate* doing it.  In fact, heritic
that I am, I don\'t really like the idea of "the main world."  <g> In
many systems there are several settlements scattered across several
worlds.  The players might have business at any of them.  

I set up lots systems where the "Port of Entry" is a good starport on
a small airless rock with only a few hundred people employed
there...often a moon or an asteriod.  Cargos and passengers incoming
or outgoing to other systems funnel through there.  

Sometimes they aren\'t even allowed to take their ships to other
locations in the system..for various reasons.  Maybe the local
government wants to control imports/exports (tarrifs, religious
reasons, etc).  Other times it\'s said to be a "safety" measure, for
whatever reason.  Often the real reason is to force ships to buy fuel
at the offical gaspumps. <G>

The main population centers are elsewhere in the system.  So are some
of the adventures.  <g>

I *do* agree with you about maps.  I really like maps too! ;)

No, the original poster is right.  When you move a conductor through
a magnetic field you generate electricity, but you have to apply
a force to more it (which here will show up as drag on the vehicle).

If only there was a computer program that would do this and not create ten
thousand pages of tables.  Something that details a system like we would
detail a system.

This is a cool idea.  Like Gateway Station.  I never though of it for Trav
though.  If you look at a Starwars Module "Platts guide to Starports" there
are some very cool ideas and sketches in there.

I hate buying fuel from the locals.  I\'ll go out of my way to get it free.
I\'ve got a system where it\'s illegal to use active sensors on the main
planet.  Why?  The locals are hiding something?  The Ancients have set up a
taco stand?  Who knows but when you give players these kinds of regulations
they go nuts.  Well I know, but that\'s none of their buisness.

Maps are the best thing a GM has for story telling, prop wise that is.

Brad, the reason I brought this up was I am under the impression that you
Brits call 10,000,000,000 a billion rather then 1,000,000,000.  If you could
clear this up for me it would save me from being out gunned the next

        I generally gloss the system, but that\'s because I like the more far
ranging campaign, where the characters are likely cover a great deal of
distance.  Just how many systems do you have the energy to flesh out?
        Now I freely admit I will detail any system where I think the
characters will spend much time...and I do feel guilty about glossed
systems, but I get impatient.

        Makes sense...I like this....

        I love maps.  Anyone have world maps they\'re willing (and able) to

There is one other alternative, albeit above TL17; grandfather has
constructed gates that allow instant travel to a pocket dimension, where
you drive a day or so to another gate out, and have wound up between 2 and
8 parsecs distant.

these gates appear in secret of the anchients, IIRC. I KNOW they appear in
a CT numbered GDW produced adventure.

Mission:
The Ajax Frigate is designed to "show the flag" and discourage piracy.  As a 
representative of Imperial might, it can patrol systems where sending a cruiser 
would be uneconomical and/or over-kill.  However, it should be more than capable
of seeing off a corsair or two with its particle accelerator and missile 
barbettes, whilst defending with sandcasters & laser turrets.  It is not 
designed to fight larger craft, so no meson screen is fitted.

Possible. Though as I\'ve pointed out, moving by "pushing against
planets" has some rather surprising *inherent* limits. Like the energy
requirements going up as your speed relative to what you are pushing
against increases.

No no no! A British Billion is 10^12, not 10^9, a million millions rather
than a thousand millions. Similarly a British Trillion is a billion billions
(10^24) rather than a million millions (10^12).

Oh, I have campaigns where the characters cover a great deal of distance =

Sure. I have 57 world descriptions including maps here at home. =
Unfortunately for the international gamers, the descriptions are in =
danish. The detailed stats and maps should be readable for everyone, =
though.

The documents are in wp51 format, the maps are mostly in wpg format, =

1) The cost of Thrust Plates have been reduced; they now cost 25% of the

I have a crudely drawn blank world template using Windows Paint...  
I\'d be willing to send it to you (or anybody else who\'s interested) 
or post it someplace if someone wants.  I asked several months ago if 
anybody had a template and nobody responded, so I created 1 myself.

Well, after glancing at 600 or so pages of digests, I see my (mostly)
throwaway line about notes for a Midnight at the Well of Souls generated some
interest.

Some background is in order, then...

Set the wayback machine for 1977. Star Wars is out. Traveller is out. Some
early Jack Chalker--Jungle of Stars, Midnight, Web of the Chozen is out. Fred
Kiesche, Ron Fischer and a few others are at Rutgers University. The pot is
stirred.

In those early days, there wasn\'t much structure to the Traveller universe. I
remember my roommate Ron going to Origins and bringing back exciting news
about Traveller (AHL! Fifth Frontier Wars!). But we mostly ran our own stuff,
based on a weird mixture of Larry Niven, Jack Chalker and others.

One adventure we ran was--well, we never really had a name, but called it
(jokingly) "The Web of the Bloodretch". It was a weird mixture of Jack
Chalker\'s Web of the Chozen and Midnight at the Well of Souls, with character
transformations into an alien spieces, a wrecked alien culture, and a quest
to transform the characters back into humans. It was fun, but it was bad.

Fast forward a little. Add in Steve Davidson, somebody who actually knows
Jack Chalker. We\'re all talking about doing something, publishing
something...so of course we think of doing a RPG based on Midnight.

The race is on. We call GDW. We do a conference call with Loren Wiseman and
Marc Miller. We get tentative permission to use Traveller (sans Imperium
background) for Midnight the RPG. We contact Eleanor Wood Agency about Jack
Chalker. We start negotiations.

Enter Tim A. Green of TAG Industries, mostly known (at that point) for sewing
bags to hold dice.

TAG Industries and Davidson/Kiesche start a bidding war for the rights to
Midnight. TAG is backed by Tim\'s father, who has (we hear) $$$. We only have
$, generated by our salaries and savings. $$$ beats out $, so we lose out.
The project collapses on our end.

I toss my notes in a fit of anger.

About a year later, TAG comes out with Midnight. Plans are announced--Basic
RPG, lots of modules, a board game based on the Wars of the Well World
(sequels numbers 2, 3, 4), miniatures, etc.

The game bombs. The game does not sell. The game bites big time. TAG vanishes
from the map.

Who knows what would have happened if we had the rights and were able to slap
"Based on the Traveller system" on the front?

Web of the Bloodretch still exists in a few pages of notes, somewhere. As
with my first "dungeon" for Empire of the Petal Throne, it\'s rather sketchy
and pretty awful. But you can\'t toss some things...

I have Glimmerdrift & Ley as well.  I\'ve used them several times for 
campaigns in the past.  I was never sure why GDW declared them 
heretical, er, non "canon"  I also had Maranantha-Alkahest & Gateway. 
The nice thing about them was that they all linked together when at the time 
the only other published sectors out there were Spinward Marches 
(which GDW beat like a dead horse in the CT era), and Solomani Rim 
(which during the pre-Rebellion era was frankly a pretty boring place 
to adventure for the most part).  Having 4 cohesive sectors, most of 
which the Imperium had little or no control of, gave plenty of 
opportunities for far-flung campaigns...

Frankly, Atlas of the Imperium wasn\'t all that great, and conflicted 
with other sources, including GDW\'s in some instances...

What the heck, its not like anybody designed some to replace them.  
You\'d STILL have to design 1 of your own if you decided to run your 
campaign there.  So why not use them if you got them.

other FTLs aren\'t mentioned in CT products, I know that in the TNE Rulebook
on page 331 it says 

\'Projected technology is divided into several different fields.  Each field
represents a solution to a problem or goal.  In the case of the stardrive
field, a universe\'s projected technologyy can be jump drive, stutterwarp,
natural warp points, star gates, hyperspace or psionic shifting...\'

Also, on page 332, a small table showing different areas of technology shows
this

\'Representive Field                     Effects 
 Stardrive                              SEVERAL styles of approach (jump drive
                                        star gates, etc.)\'

Well, I suppose that shows that in ALL traveller there are different styles
of stardrives, but the TNE book also goes on to say that only ONE should be
allowed in each universe (kind of dumb if you ask me).

I think it\'d be a really cool campaign to have the characters encounter an
alien race who uses warp technology. It\'d be really interesting if the
players had to flee a space combat situation: their ship would disappear
into jump space, and the aliens would be like, "Hey, man, what
happened?"

Not necessarily dumb.  You could seriously mess with the consistency 
of your particular universe by allowing different forms of FTL 
travel...

The Imperium background would markedly different with say, widespread 
stargate technology.

I\'ve been working on one in Corel Draw.  I\'m not terribly good with the
system yet, I\'ll be taking a course soon.  I\'ll let you know when it\'s done.

Has anyone seen the "Terralogicus World Simulator"  I\'ve heard about it and
I was wondering if it\'s any good.  It creates world maps.

The free trader as designed cannot pay for itself.  The higher cost along
with the crew requirements (which push up the cost of the life support) make
it impossible to survive without a subsidy or speculative trading.  This
also assumes full passanger and cargo loads per trip and no downtime.  The
bank would never make this mortgage.

Also note the Book 2 Free Trader had 10 state rooms, which ment 8 high
passages available instead of only 6 passages in the 10 state rooms of the
QSDS design which unbalances it even more.

I can appreciate the want for designs to be consistant from the beginers
sequences to the advanced sequences, but they also have to be compatiable
with the basic game.

Actually thats FF&S that says that not TNE.  And in a round about way it
makes sence.  There should only be one method of travelling between the
stars, only one way of breaking the laws of physics.  Granted it would be
cool to watch the aliens faces when that happened.

If you can read PDF files, I have a couple of them - one for design and one 
for "display" if you will. You can get them at:

http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/pdf/blank_planetary_map.pdf
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/pdf/planet_map_design.pdf

I also have a grid of hex paper:
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/pdf/hex_grid.pdf

made them all myself, originally with Adobe Illustrator.

I suppose next you\'ll be telling me that the amount of energy gained
will not be enough to maintain orbit AND power the station?  
(Darn those pesky laws of thermodymanics!!)

Well, at lest it could be used as a backup power system for a space station.

these numbers will change, so I will repost the final corrections after his 
QSDS rewrite comes out.  

As Rob Miracle has noted, the economics are somewhat out of kilter here, but I 
am not as concerned about this as Rob is, since it seems to me that we could 
solve this by increasing the standard prices for tickets and hauled cargo.  And 
the Free Trader carries only 6 High Passengers after all, according to The 
Traveller Book (p64).  I don\'t have access just now to the old 3-book set to 
see if that was a change, or what.

I am still VERY concerned with the crew figures (which contributes to the 
economics problems).  In vessels with large power plants, the Engineering Crew 
becomes huge.  Look at the Mercenary Cruiser, for example.  If there is going 
to be a crew adjustment, I would start with this area.  I still think a 
TL-based or computer-based crew modifier could be added onto the existing QSDS 
rules without disrupting the work Guy has already done.

Another area of confusion: staterooms.  The QSDS rules imply that the 
staterooms can hold maximum 1 person.   Is double-occupancy no longer allowed?  
Is it allowed only for Large staterooms?  Some clarification would be in order.

the hunt.  The Owner-Aboard, generally a prize-winning hunter, has a small 
stateroom to use as a personal office/trophy room, in addition to the large 
stateroom quarters he is assigned.

    'body' => '	Rob Miracle mentioned that, without spec cargoes, the QSDS far
trader couldn\'t pay for itself.  He\'s right, but more of an
indication that the economics rules are broken than anything else.

	The \'Crewmember as employee\' paradigm that\'s used probably wouldn\'t 
apply to a small trader like that.  A major transport corp could well 
afford the Far Trader, because they\'ll get an even steeper discount 
on the ships due to volume purchase.  A Ford escort is cheap, but 
it\'s even cheaper when you buy five or six thousand of them, like a 
big rental company.

	A better economic model of an independent trader is exactly how
most Trav PC\'s with their own ships operate, as a partnership, with
shares in the profits as the only salary...banks make loans,
relatively large ones, on this basis all the time. Yes they\'re risky, 
and that\'s why they charge the interest they do.  Also skip tracing 
in the imperium must be a lucrative business (And sometimes the 
borrower gets caught...our dear guv\'nor was indicted on 23 counts of 
fraud, etc last week over a failed real estate venture.)

	"The life of a repo man is always interesting!"

	Also, the only income figures you used are from a universe where the 
ships get by with half the crews...if expenses go up, the rate for a 
high or middle passage is certainly going to be higher.  
Remember...if the crew needed for your little tramp Far Trader has 
doubles, so has the crew requirement for that luxurious 5000 ton QE2 
of the SpaceLanes.  That means you\'re applying the wrong income to 
the equation.  The same goes for cargo rates as well.

	This simply points out that there has to be a little inflation in 
the Traveller universe to account for the union rules for ship\'s 
engineers ;-)

Sounds good.  Only thing is, that means I (and others) will now be

Hmmm.  Depends on what the price of tickets and cargo is, doesn\'t it?  
I\'d guess that the cost of shipment will be higher at these lower tech 
levels.  As efficiencies improve (at higher tech levels), the prices will 
drop.  At least, that\'s my guess as to how this will all work.

The problem here is TL.  Book2 doesn\'t ever state TL.  We might assume
that it\'s TL11 due to the jump2 drive, but nothing else in the design
matches HG, so why should the TL?

In Traders and Gunboats the Far Trader is listed at TL10, but it has J2.
Book2 is broken (I say this because I\'m sure more ships were designed
with HG than B2, so HG wins :-).

I would also add that the technology that makes a sub-TL12 ship no
longer exists since MM decided on the Fusion+ hook.  I\'d be interested
to see if a HG design at TL12+ matches with a QSDS design.

As someone else noted, the economics have always been broken.  Muir did
some interesting number-crunching on this (since it\'s right up his alley
).

Terralogicus is actually pretty good, but it\'s tied pretty closely to
Astrologicus..or at least it seems that way to me. Astrologicus is
also pretty good, but the systems it creates aren\'t very
Travelleristic.

I had a bunch that *absolutely* hated paying for fuel, so I arranged
for them to visit a system where the only way they could get fuel was
to buy from the monopoly vendor...or find a backdoor.  I *knew* they\'d
go looking for the backdoor!  <g>

If you want to introduce alternate FTL tech you can, but Jump is the
\'canon\' approach.  

I\'ve used stutterwarp, hyperdrive, and ST-like warp drive in the past,
but I\'ve always limited FTL to just one way per game.  I could see
independent development of 2 or 3 methods, but I don\'t know if that
situation would continue long.  Wouldn\'t the best way soon become the
way everyone used?

The lack of FTL communications is also an important factor in
Traveller fictons. I *like* keeping communications down to the speed
of the ships.  I did run one game where there were FTL commo and
sensors, but limited their use by giving them a very short range and
high energy requirements.  They ended up being used in-system only.

Specifically, what do you want?  

I haven\'t been satisfied with any of the several programs I\'ve tried. 
Astrologicus is very good..for $50 it should be <g>..but it doesn\'t
really produce Traveller like systems.

I\'ve been working on a system generator for myself, off and on, for
about a year now.  The algorithms don\'t *exactly* match Traveller
standards, but they give equivilent results for the stars.  The
planets...I\'ve been having trouble with.  <G>

The prototype seems to be able to generate reasonable physical data
for the inner planets of GV type stars now, and I know how I\'m going
to extend it to other V class stars.  Now I\'ve got to work on the
outer system planets, asteriod belts, and *then* deal with the
cultural/social/ parts of each planet, and get everything into UWP
format.  Still a long way to go!

Here are 3 samples of what I\'m generating so far:

(Right now you specify the star class/type and distance in AU. These
are for planets at 1 AU orbiting a G2V star.)

AU:    1.00
Size: 17003   Size/Earth: 1.328
Dens: 5.443   Den/Earth:  0.990
Grav:  1.31
AirP:  1.37  Dense Atmosphere
Temp:   77c (Range:  52 to 102) Boiling, uninhabitable!

AU:    1.00
Size:  9196   Size/Earth: 0.718
Dens: 5.795   Den/Earth:  1.054
Grav:  0.76
AirP:  0.77  Standard Atmosphere
Temp:  -28c (Range: -53 to  -3) Ice locked planet

AU:    1.00
Size:  9631   Size/Earth: 0.752
Dens: 7.238   Den/Earth:  1.316
Grav:  0.99
AirP:  0.83  Standard Atmosphere
Temp:  2c (Range:  -23 to 27) Cool, Habitable from equator thru 
temperate zone

This is all I\'m generating for the planets right now, but I\'ve got a
start.  <g>

What kind of details do folks what?

Ah come on! <g> 

It really depends on the sort of game you want to run.  I prefer to
break as few phyical laws as possible while keeping the game fun. 
However, I reserve the right to decide just how many laws "as few as
possible" happens to be! <g>

IAC, under current theories we\'re breaking *lots* of laws with just
standard Traveller tech..<g>..and everybody knows it!  So, if a GM
wants to break a couple more and include a second FTL that\'s their
business..right?

Yep, all you\'ve said is right.  Notice that TNE goes on to talk about
Imperium tech as an example, though?  In the offical Imperium there is
only jump drive, but, of course, you don\'t have to play in the
official Imperium. <g>

Not really, limiting yeah, but not necessarily dumb.  Most people\'s
experience indicates that having more than one FTL turns out to be
more trouble than it\'s worth....generally.  Then again, don\'t let that
stop you!  Try it, maybe you can teach all us old dogs some new
tricks. <g>

I read this design as having 1 battery of 3-2-0-0 lasers.
2 more batteries of 3-2-0-0 lasers.
3 batteries of missile barbettes.
4 more batteries of missile barbettes.

As I remember, the first 2 digits before the battery are the *number* of
such batteries, not the number *of* the battery.  Is this wrong?

As for armor, I thought hulls were rated to gs*10?  That means for 4 gs
the hull has a base AV of 40 (BL) converted to BR it\'s 2, converted to
USD it\'s 20.  If the hull is rated to 6 gs, then the AV should be 20 as
well.  If the hull is stressed to 4 gs, then the structure is 14, if
it\'s to 6gs then it\'s 16.

I haven\'t looked at the others in detail (I was copying this one to test
fight it :-)

It details 7 starports.  From Kuat (home of KDY the company that builds 
Star Destroyers) to Port Haven (A smugglers Paradise).  It\'s actually 
pretty fun and there are some really good ideas in the book.

In TNE this is not much of a problem, most locals are incapable of 
stopping a determined starship.  In CT this could pose a real problem.

No kidding.  The sensor thing has them tearing their hair out.  
PLAYER:  What\'s going to happen to us if we turn the sensors on.  
GM:  You don\'t know, no one\'s ever done it before.
PLAYER:  So it\'s a tech 2 planet right.
GM:  That\'s what the UPP says.
PLAYER:  What\'s that supposed to mean?
GM:  Nothing.  That\'s just the listed UPP.

It burns their butts and generally speaking it motivates them into 
developing their own adventures.

I\'ve heard that it uses a system very similar to the GURP\'s system for 
planetary and system generation.  Friend of mine loaned me a demo of 
Terralogicus.  Don\'t like the maps too blocky, idea is good just doesnt\' 
go far enough.

This is true, unfortunately lets face it the average stutterwarp ship 
could run rings about a HEPLAR ship, not to sure about grav plates but 
introducing something like this totally changes the face of space.  You 
can do it just be very careful about the type of travel you wish to 
offer.

This is perfect in its level of detail.  Unfortunately most of these 
things will not allow you to input a UPP code and a star type and produce 
something that seems to make sence.

Also this kind of data us usually produced for every lump of rock in the 
system, so when you\'ve got five gas giants each with ten moons, well you 
can see what I\'m talking about.  A bajillion (very large number my 5 
year old cousin invented) pages of junk and only one useful page.  If the 
computer came up with lines like

1.  Searing rock, 5000km
2.  Wild Greenhouse effect, 8000km
3.  Size:  9631   Size/Earth: 0.75
    Dens: 7.238   Den/Earth:  1.316
    Grav:  0.99
    AirP:  0.83  Standard Atmosphere
    Temp:  2c (Range:  -23 to 27) Cool, Habitable from equator thru
    temperate zone
4.  Cool Rock: thin atmosphere, 6000km, 2 tiny moons: rocks
5.  Asteroids
6.  Gas Giant 85,000km, 15 moons, two rings.
etc.

Pehaps thats something like that it should read, for an entire system 
that is.  The planet generator should be able to reconsile the UPP.  ie 
if the upp comes up with a size of 1 and a vacuum atmosphere, perhaps the 
main world should actually be a moon of a gas giant and none of the other 
 planets are inhabitable.  This however requires judgement, something 
computers are not terribly good at.  It would be nice to see such a 
program though.  Just remembered the TPP code too, it would have to 
reconsile the number of gas giants and the number of asteroid belts and 
the planets population.  Wow that\'s a lot of stuff.

Right!  The GM has to live with the consequences of her
decisions.  <g> 

If you put stutterwarp in a game as one technology and have other
ships maneuvering with reaction drives then you\'ve got a potential
problem in game balance.  But there are things you can do...

Maybe stutterwarp can\'t get above 3xftp (400 days to travel 1 parsec),
so it\'s not as efficient or economical as regular jump drives, but
it\'s hell on wheels in-system.  Would Stutter be used as the FTL drive
on most ships?  Not if they could get jump, but it would be a good
backup and maybe an excellent Mdrive.

As far as in-system travel is concerned...well, stutterwarp isn\'t
normally FTL in-system and could have several potential problems of
their own:  1. doesn\'t work near a strong grav well, so you can\'t
land/launch with one; 2. doesn\'t give you *real* velocity, so just
*how* is a stutter going to match orbital velocities once it gets to a
planet (???), if it stutters up to the planet and turns off the drive
the ship\'s actual momentum probably won\'t match the planet\'s; 3.
standard stutters can maneuver like a banshee, but you don\'t have to
play them that way, there are very legitimate ways to limit their
ability to instantly start/stop and change direction.

BTW, I was thinking about (2) yesterday.  Stutter a ship in front of a
planet travelling in orbit at 30kps and turn off the drive. What\'s the
ship\'s momentum in its current frame of reference? Could be
anything..depends on what it was when it turned the stutter
on...right?  So, let\'s say for this example that when it entered the
system it had 0 momentum with regard to the star. Now you have a 30kps
KE bomb sitting in front of the planet!

So much for stutterwarps (or any reactionless drive) eliminating the
planet killer.  If there is a way to put a ship/object in the path of
a planet then the planet can provide all the KE you need for a big
bang.  Well, I guess you could get around even this, but it *is* an
added complication.

Yeah, at this point I\'m generating the data to go *into* a UPP.
Eventually, I\'d want to be able to take a UPP and expand it.

That\'s the kind of thing I\'m shooting for eventually.  

>From what I\'ve read about Milieu 0, we are going to know where stars
are (and I assume their type), but nothing much about the planets in
the systems.  Therefore, I\'m concentrating on generating planets,
moons, and such.

What I\'m going for is a program that, given a star (ie K2V) and
orbital distance, will produce a report on a single planet.  That
report could be a one liner or one with lots of detail..let the user
see both and pick which one they want.  Then print,or append to a
file.  If I do it right, you\'ll end up with as much or as little
detail as you want...well, up to the amount I\'ll have built into the
system.  <g>

You\'ve got that right!  <g> 

However, we have a computer networking with your PC that is (we

Yeah, I know, but I\'ll keep puttering along.  If I get something that
I think is marginally useful, I\'ll let everybody know.

So it doesn\'t have FTL travel (yet!). Once it gets jump drive, it\'ll
have to build a ship big enough to hold a copy of "the computer" and a
fair sized populace.

Consider a normal generator, with a coil of wire moving thru a magnetic
field (from a permanent magnet). The strength of the magnet doesn\'t
drop. The speed of the coil will drop though. Which is why it takes an
effort to turn the crank on a handcranked generator.

I am concerned for one very major reason:  We don\'t have any insite into the
game itself, except that it is to be CT updated for the 90\'s.  Trade has
been the same in every release of the game, save speculative trading.  The
core costs for fuel, passage and such have remained unchanged, and we can\'t
assume that Marc has changed the core game to fit ship building.

This goes beyond economics.  If the weapons are not compatible with the
combat system (which has in someways been addressed) then it won\'t work.  It
seems as if we have been creating a ship design system in the dark with
regards to the basic rules and we expect the rules to conform to our design
system.  Well, reality here, the design system has to fit the rules.

Crew figures are very high.  They are supposedly that way because of lack of
automation etc.  But if you look at every Sci-Fi anything, ships have
considerably smaller crews than is presented by FF&S (L/QSDS).  Even in Star
Trek, they were working on automation that would let a crew of two run a
400,000T ship.  The real world models that were discussed in baseing the
crew configurations on was based on military vessels.  Commerical Air liners
are crewed by very small crews.  But we arn\'t talking today we are talking
the future.

Look at "Foundation".  Look at any "invaders from Mars" type movies, even ET
only had a few crew members and most of them were probably
passangers/scientists.  Engineers just plain are not needed on non-military
vessels.  All other vessels, visit a starport every week.  If things need
fixed or maintained it is done then.  I think that one engineer per 500T of
hull would be much more realistic.  Under 500T, engineering duties are
handled by the  flight deck crew, ah la Hans and Chewy.  500T to 999T You
need an engineer etc.
Now for military vessels, the FF&S based crews are not bad.  They go on long
manuvers and may not see a port every week.  SDB\'s can be hiding in gas
giants for a long time and would need more on-board personel to deal with
problems, where as Oberline\'s is going to maximize space for passangers and
cargo, and have their facilities do maintenence while the vessel is in port.

There is a real inconsistancy here between the vessels in cost.  The Free
Trader is much more expensive while the Sub Merchant is much less.  And the
sub. merchant is supposed to be "subsidized" because its soooo expensive.
No none would need to subsidize the merchant because it will pay for itself,
but would need the subsidy on the free trader.

How did the sub. liner workout to be 1/4th the cost?  Most are within about
20Mcr (of course that is a 40% +/- swing on some ships)?

     slightly desperate navy in a time of need.
     
     This is actually a ship I started designing about a year ago with 
     FF&S, but eventually gave up.  I was delighted to finish it in about 
     an hour and a half using QSDS.  Top marks to the QSDS designers.
     
     I figured 2 crew for each fighter (1 "ground" crew + the actual 
     pilot).  I imagine the extra accomodation over the original being 
     provided in a large "portakabin" type affair parked in the cargo bay.

We\'ve seen the basic starship combat system, and the design systems
will work with the combat system; I\'m not as concerned about this (although
I would have liked to have more time for playtesting).

This has to do with the change in the basis for the design system.  In
Classic Traveller, the "big ticket" items were the drives.  In FF&S, the
most expensive components on the ship are the sensors and avionics.  These
tend to stay the same for all of the commercial starships (at TL-12 it costs
about MCr 16 for these items).  This makes the cost of a "minimum" starship
relatively high.

The cost of the hull and drives are (together) about half the total
cost of the ship; therefore larger ships are cheaper (per ton) than small
ones.  That\'s why the cost of the free trader has gone up, but the
subsidized merchant has gone down.

: A few ideas that popped into my head...
: 
: IMPERIAL INTERSTELLAR SCOUT SERVICE:
: 
: A triangle, point up.  from the two bottom corners of the triangel, arching
: up to about 1/4 the height, is a view of a blue-green planet (picture the
: view from the space shuttle).  Near the top, about the 2/3rds height line,
: is a sunbirst in red.  The rest of the field is black, with white/silver
: stars added.  The whole thing is surronded by a red border

But doesn\'t the IISS have it\'s own symbol already?  It should be that
little six-legged Sylean creature running in front of the Sunburst.
Now, if I remember correctly, the IISS grew out of the SISS (Sylean
ISS).  My guess would be that maybe the SISS symbol could involve the
herbivore across the starfield idea that you gave.  Then when it
became the IISS, they could put the herbivore on top of the Sunburst
(a tribute to their beginning as SISS and incorporate their new
identity). 

Also, didn\'t Cleon I come up with the idea of the Sunburst, or was it
one of his decendents?  Another thing to keep in mind.  If we plan on
not invalidating too many prior Traveller writings, then we should
keep in mind that the Sunburst\'s ONLY color was red.  This did
change around 400 (I think) when an Empress declared that the Sunburst
would have no official color from then on (this was due to the fact that
some IR seeing species couldn\'t even see the Sunburst).

Also, an adventure of which the focus was gaining a new technology to travel

And, I don\'t see why necessarily just because jump drive is say the best FTL

boats on Earth now.  People still use rowboats, yet they\'re less efficient

Lastly, I was wondering what exactly this \'stutterwarp\' I\'ve heard mentioned is?

Wrong...

I quote from the Imperial Encyclopedia, MegaTraveller: Listing under 
Imperial Sunburst.

"The symbol of the Third Imperium established by Cleon (the first 
emperor) when the empire was proclaimed.  Images show him standing 
before the original banner with a GOLDEN YELLOW sunburst against a 
BLACK background, representing Capital\'s type G star against dark 
space."

The emphasis on color names in the above is mine.

The original sunburst was yellow with a black backdrop.  Later, when the 
Eliyoh were admitted to the Imperium, they were unable to distinguish 
between yellow & black (their visual range was mainly centered in the 
infrared).  Therefore, Porfiria declared the symbol to have no official colors.

Again to quote from the Encyclopedia,
"The original banner in the Imperial throne room is still black with 
a yellow sunburst.  The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service uses a 
red sunburst; the Imperial Navy, yellow, the Imperial Army black; the 
Imperial Marines, maroon."

Red is not, and never has been the only color of the Imperial 
Sunburst.  If any 1 color can lay that claim, it is yellow.

The stutterwarp used a macro scale of the electron tunneling effect.  The
whole thing was some fellow, Dean, discovered that given the correct
circumstances electrons could disappear from one point and reappear
instantaniously several cm away.

Utilizing this knowledge the stutterwarp "tunnels" the ship it is  contained
in several hundred meters ahead by cycling the drive thousands of times a
second, getting the revs up, the ship could be made to travel at multiple
velocities of C when in deep space.  Stutterwarp is also limited by gravity
wells so the further a ship gets into a gravity well the less efficinetly
the drive works untill it completely konks out at 0.1 G.  After that you
need conventional thrusters.

What this means is that the ship has no actual forward momentum so
technically it\'s not breaking and laws of Einstineian physics.  Because it
lacks forward momentum it can turn on a dime and accellerate and decellerate
far faster than a regular starship which has to counteract all that momentum.

Because the ship is moving faster than C the first thing your sensors would
show is as it went past you.  Remember it\'s leaping in front of it\'s old
sensor image.  What this means is if two stutterwarp ships passed each other
in deep space a person staring out the window of one ship would see the
other ship suddenly materialize directly in front of their window then
receed off in both directions.  One as the ship actually leaves and the
other as the ships approaching images arrive to be seen.  Looking out the
back of a stutterwarp ship that turned off it\'s drive would produce and
equally interesting effect as all the images behind you caught up in reverse
order, so you\'d see the ship receed off into the distance as the images
caught up to you.  Pretty cool eh?

I hope this gives you a better handle on stutterwarp drives.  I could quote
it all from FF&S if you\'d like.  It\'s a little more concise and gearheaded
in there.

Actually, I wasn\'t so worried about what you said.  It\'s just that 
everybody was proposing all these early Imperial symbol designs with 
tons of red in them, and I knew there was something wrong, but I 
couldn\'t place what it was.

If we\'re going by previous canon (unless Marc wishes to invalidate 
it), the featured color for most early Imperial symbology should 
include lots of yellow...

This needs to be very carefully done. If a new drive technology comes 
along which is (a) cheaper and (b) better -- more efficient, whatever 
- -- than the current drive, there are going to be *major* economic 
effects. That means economic dislocation, civil war, strife and many 
other things which are going to reduce the quality of life for 
players.

The whole question rests on economics. If your new FTL technology 
isn\'t better (cheaper to run/but or faster or whatever) nobody\'s 
going to use it. Look at how Wankel rotary engines failed to take off 
(it\'s arguable that these in fact were superior to standard internal 
combustion engines, but from what I can recall they suffered serious 
reliability problems). If it is better, everyone is going to use it 
and after a while the old technology falls out of use.

Rowboats vs motorboats is a better analogy to intra-system travel. 
Think of it as HEPlaR vs. thruster plates :-) Better FTL drives will 
give you a situation more like sailing ships and steam ships. Don\'t 
know about you, but I haven\'t seen many clippers round here lately

I read this design as having 1 battery of 3-2-0-0 lasers.
2 more batteries of 3-2-0-0 lasers.
3 batteries of missile barbettes.
4 more batteries of missile barbettes.

I was under the impression that the ## before the battery identified the 
battery, not the quantity of the batteries.  Guy, can you clarify?

That\'s the number of batteries

It sounds like what you meant was:

 2 Military Laser 3-2-0-0
 1 Missile Barbette 10 (10)

Note that missile batteries need two numbers: the number of missiles that
can be fired (the ready store, usually), and the number that can be
controlled in-flight at once (that\'s the number of MFDs times the control
rating per MFD).

System (QSDS) is available.  This is version 1.1 and if I\'ve tracked the
updates correctly it should be identical to the one that will be printed
in the new Traveller basic rule book.  You can get QSDS from by web site:

	http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds/

I\'ve got Microsoft Word 6 and plain ASCII versions available (the ASCII
version is also viewable by most web browsers).

For those of you who have already designed ships using QSDS, there are a
number of changes from earlier versions, and you\'ll need to re-calculate
your designs.  The changes primarily affect crew size (which should now
be back down to Classic Traveller levels), and minor typo fixes.

Also with respect to crew size, I\'d like to draw everyone\'s attention
to the paragraph on "Small Ships and Combined Jobs".  In addition to
combining fractional crew requirements (into, for example, a
engineer/sensor/communicator crewperson), there are special exceptions for
small ships.

In particular all ships 100 tons and smaller can be operated in routine
circumstances by 1 crewmember (no matter what the crew calculation says),
and all shps 200 tons and smaller may be operated in routine circumstances
by 2 crewmembers (again, no matter what the crew calculation says).

Also, don\'t forget that when all is done with QSDS, you can take a 25%
discount (multiply the final price by 0.75) because of the standardized
construction.  This should help the economic aspects of small trade
starships considerably (a MCr 36 QSDS ship actually costs MCr 27).

Finally, I note that there\'s been some discussion on what the two "Maneuver"
crew are for.  I\'m sorry it wasn\'t explained well, but here\'s the deal: you
need one, a Pilot, if there\'s a maneuver drive installed.  You need another,
the Navigator, if there\'s a jump drive installed.  Thus, a ship with both a
maneuver drive and a jump drive needs a Pilot and a Navigator (Astrogator).

I\'ll be happy to answer other questions about ship design; and I\'m putting
together a Frequently Asked Questions list that I\'ll also put up on by Web
site at some point.

I\'ve got one of those d20 style world maps created for the Mac (using a CAD
package).  I can generate pict, gif, jpeg, ... from this without too many
problems.  If anybody is interested I can upload it.

I\'ve also got a full world map up on the web (as part of my little adventure).
 The adventure is located at http://spider.jcu.edu.au/trav/twilight.html

Right at the bottom of this is the world map (as a gif) and this is a link to
the postscript version (for downloading).  The direct URLs for these two are
http://spider.jcu.edu.au/trav/world.gif &
http://spider.jcu.edu.au/trav/world.ps

The various file sizes are (rougly):
	adventure	60k
	gif		16k
	postscript	300k

The postscript version takes ages to print on our laser printer, this isn\'t
because it is a bitmap image, it is simply rather complex.

Enjoy....

I agree with you on this...generally, but not completely.  I can
envision situations where there could be a couple of FTL methods
available, even with the difference as great as "sailing ship vs steam
ship."  Why, for example, are there still jump1 ships when technology
makes jump2,3,4 drives available?  Over time more and more ships will
move to the newer, better technology, but *how much* time will it
take?

On the sail vs steam analogy, the first steam ships were built in the
early 1800\'s and sailing ships competed successfully with them for
nearly 100 years.  In some niches sailing ships still compete with
engine powered ships successfully.

Another possiblity, would be a culture alien to the PC\'s might use
different techs for various things, including FTL.  Maybe eventually
the new culture would adapt to the mainstream (or the mainstream would
adapt to the alien culture\'s technology), but it wouldn\'t happen
overnight.  

Shoot!  If you had a really superior technology would you give it away
to everybody else?  How much would you *charge* somebody for it? 
Would you try to prevent the other folks from developing it for
themselves?  They\'d get it...eventually.

I doubt the early 3rd Imperium is giving Thruster\'s or MrFusion to
anybody!  I rather suspect they would go to extremes to prevent those
technologies from leaking to competing powers...

we\'ll be able to finally compete with those Imperium pretender scum.",

...and now you know why the Terran\'s cleaned the 1st Imperium\'s clock!
<g>

Terrans had meson guns, the Vilani didn\'t.  The Terrans had jump2, the
Vilani didn\'t.  It\'s blitzkrieg time again, faster moving and longer
range against slower and shorter. 

Terran fleet concentrates more quickly than the Vilani can and takes
key planet.  (Maybe by threating it with a *big* rock <g>, but let\'s
say pounding the planet with long range meson guns.) Then the Terrans
quickly install DMSs and move out.  Vilani send in a fleet to recover
the planet, and get chopped to peices by the DMSs while the Terran
fleets are elsewhere taking still other key Vilani planets.

The Vilani can win a pitched space battle (which the Terrans won\'t
fight) through simple numbers, but they can\'t get lost planets back. 
And with it costing fleet after fleet in
impossible attempts to recover planets the Vilani soon don\'t even have
the numbers to win pitched battles.  Now their loses escalate!

Terrans can concentrate and scatter their forces more quickly. They
can bloody a Vilani fleet at range and jump.  They have secure bases
for resupply, while the Vilani\'s bases are only secure if a massive
fleet is sitting there..eventually not even then.

Of course, that\'s not *all* of it, but I rather suspect this is a
bigger part of what happened than spreading diseases or cloning
soldiers.  <g>

Huh?  Where did that come from?  I\'ve never seen the name Dean
associated with the stutterwarp, I quote...

"However scaling up the Jerome effect (Dr. Emile Francois Jerome,
2021-2103) from moving a single hydrogen molecule to moving a large
fabricated spacecraft was a long, complex, and extremely expensive
proposition.", *Traveller:2300*, p14.

I\'ve been toying with the idea of cutting down on the jump rate and/or
maximum length of the stutter\'s jump to make it a
sub-light only drive.  

The Dean Drive is something else entirely.  From memory, it was
supposed to work by converting angular momentum directly to linear
momentum.  The prototype built in the 50\'s(??) supposedly moved across
the floor, but Dean wouldn\'t let anyone examine the machinery (not
even the patent office <g>), so we don\'t know *how* it moved across
the floor.  Probably wasn\'t a real hoax, just a stubborn amateur who
got it wrong.  <g>

Crew Detail: 1 Engineer, 2 Electronics, Pilot, Astrogator, 3 Gunners,
	     1 Command, 1 Ship\'s Troop.

	The Corsair, an armed raiding ship, is mostly used by pirates.  
Notable features of the corsair are large cargo doors and variable 
identification features.  The large clamshell doors can open to 
reveal the entire cargo bay.  The ship has several centrally controlled 
identification features which can be used to disguise the ship: radio 
emissions alter frequency and content, and the ship\'s transponders can be 
altered to identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and 
identities.
	Based on a 400-ton, wedge-shaped, unstreamlined hull, the ship has 10 
Large Staterooms for use as crew quarters, while the 20 low berths are 
available for emergency use, or to hold captives.  The Avionics 
installed are to military specifications, while the communications gear 
is Improved TL-11.  Nine workstations have been provided, but there is no 
central bridge.
	 The Corsair is not normally available on the open market, as the ship 
is a non-commercial type.

Crew Detail (Minimum) : Engineer/Electronics, Pilot/Astrogator.

(Note: The Medic/Steward may be foregone if no passengers are carried.  
The Gunners are optional if the weapons will not be used.)

The Far Trader is based on a 200-ton, box, streamlined hull and has a 10 
ton/hr fuel purification plant.  A variant without the fuel purification 
plant is available with greater cargo capacity (60.8) for a slightly 
lesser price (MCr 63.39 after the standard discount).  In either format, the 
Far Trader contains standard civilian TL-11 avionics and improved TL-11 
communications systems.  There are 8 Large Staterooms available, one of 
which is typically used by the senior individual.  The rest of the crew 
makes use of the four bunks available.

"Best" for *what*? Each type is going to have good points and bad
points. So what may be good for *some* things might be lousy for
others. 

As an example, take the Habegger gates F. M. Busby has been using in
recent works. You stuff things in one end, and it comes out the other
end. No time passes for anything in transit, but two years pass for the
outside world. And they don\'t have a range limit.

So they\'d be great for bulk cargo, and for colonization. But they\'d be
lousy for general travel, and for urgent cargo. They\'d be a dead loss
for most military uses. 

They\'d make little difference in the Imperium (and in fact, they\'d
explain the lack of bulk cargo carriers). And the X-boat routes would
still be very important (who wants two year-old news, if you can get it
only a few months old?).

This is an extreme case, but most FTL drives in fiction have limits of
some sort, if only because it makes for better story possibilities.

Since it\'s a computer program, I\'d rather have it do *all* the calcs
and store them in some sort of *compact* record format. Then be able to
select the level of detail I want to see when browsing.

I think all the physical stuff (or at least *most* of it) should be
generated together, as it tends to be somewhat interdependent.

I also think we need to have routines for generating sectors (only
gives stellar type, and maybe gas gaints), routines for generating a
system given the stellar type info (including GG if the sector routines
generate that), and routines for fleshing out the system.

I base this on the "three" levels of data we seem to get:

1. stellar type
2. UPP for mainworld
3. detailed system

We need to be able to generate the lower levels starting from any of
the higher levels. And that includes "adjusting" the detailed system to
make the mainworld fit.

Actually, there\'s no reason to suppose that there is only *one* way to
do something. Consider flight. There\'s lighter than air, aerodynamic
lift, and overwhelming thrust. For interplanetary travel, there are
reaction drives, solar sails, etc.

Which you use depends in part on what you want to accomplish. For any
particular task, one method is usually much better than the others. But
that doesn\'t mean that you can\'t do it other ways.

There may be several ways of achieving FTL. Certainly the current
theories sugest at least two *different* methods (wormholes and the
Alucubierre drive).

And as a previous post suggested, if you are careful to adjust the
performance and limitations of various technologies, you can have
multiple drive types with no real problems.

Heck, it could even turn out that after the "warp drive" and "jump
drive" folks get to know each other, they\'ll both think that the other
is *nuts* for using the drive they do. 

"If that warp drive breaks down, you\'re stuck out in deep space and
have to hope someone can find you."

"So? At least they\'ll know *where* to look for us. If that Jump drive
of yours mis-jumps, you could wind up *anywhere*!"

(and round and rond they go... :-)

How about the following:

HPGL (A size) \\___ (I\'ve got a 7475A plotter)
HPGL (B size) /
Tek 4010      (I have a Tek vector display)
CGM	      (this is "standard" *scalable*, *vector* format)

I like vector formats, because they can be scaled, even if they don\'t
have built-in support for scaling. And most decent graphics packages
can handle CGM.

Mission:
The Ajax Frigate is designed to "show the flag" and discourage piracy. As a 
representative of Imperial might, it can patrol systems where wending a 
cruiser would be uneconomical and/or overkill.
However, it should be more than capable of seeing off a corsair or two with 
its particle accelerator and missile barbettes, whilst defending with 
sandcasters & laser turrets.  It is not  designed to fight larger craft, so 
no meson screen is fitted.

THis was probably the reason. 8)

I don\'t have the ref handy, but they were presented
in an early JTAS and are "allergic" to jumpspace.

Now, no sane human would use this drive ("I\'m not going
to take 6 yrs to go Jump-1") for interstellar travel,
but there are a few larger systems where it could be
used for interplanetary transport.

There is actually a good range of possibilities that can
be covered in this way, but you have to watch out for
"incompatible" FTL methods.  Maybe under-powering a Jump
field generator only warps the space instead of penetrating
it, allowing for "slow" FTL, maybe there is a different
drive geometry involved, or a different type of energy
field.  Overpower your meson screens and perhaps you get
a boost to your manuever drives ;)  The possibilities
are nearly endless.  It is just a matter of finding a combo
that works.

   Stutterwarp would tromp all over any drive that requires acceleration.
It doesn\'t accellerate, it just moves. So it can change direction
instantaneously and literally stop on a dime.

   As an aside, it would be fun to run a beer & pretzels game that had
both Jump and Stutterwarp. The way I\'d do it would be to give Jump and SW
similar performance, but make SW *extremely* expensive so that only
governments could possibly afford them. You would rapidly see an
interesting dichotomy - military vessels would all get SW, while civilian
and commercial vessels would make-do with cheap Jump Drives. Civilian combat
with military vessels would be a joke. Pirates would have a hard time,
unless they managed to get their hands on a bootleg, possibly defective
SW drive. In which case, they would be *real* dangerous - until the drive
broke down. <g>

   The way I see it, this means SW drives will probably be strictly
controlled (no reason for civies to have one) and probably booby-trapped
to prevent missappropriation by "non-superpowers" that don\'t have SW, or
pirates.

  Yep. These people that keep trying to artificially limit the game

about we\'ll be dealing with these problems in the future. Heck, that\'s
what s/f is _about_.

   Players are *always* going to find ways to ruin the referees day.
It\'s much better to just keep the game simple and assume that Things
Happen and have a rational system set up to deal with the potential
problem. Trying to drop a PB? Have a patrol cruiser *just happen* to be
in the Right Place at the Right Time. If you\'ve already got the players
used to the idea of an patrol presence, they shouldn\'t object to it.

   Such a game is *much* more fun than a game where the referee says
"hmm, I don\'t like that - sorry you can\'t do it"

   What *is* the difference betwen dropping a rock at 50km/sec and
dropping a rock at .1c? In either case, they are guilty of war crimes
and would be chased to the ends of the universe, in my game.

   Players should be discouraged from doing things like this, but there\'s
better ways than "you can\'t do it".

You might go with Word 5.  A lot of people, esp. Mac users, haven\'t

I haven\'t been following that closely.  Are you dropping that dumb

You\'re forgetting that the jump from 2 to 6 was only for the PC

  Additionally, all of the current traffic seems to be on various
  topics associated with Traveller, a product line yet to be
  released by Imperium Games (as opposed to Traveller, a product
  released about 20 years ago by Game Designers Workshop).  I do
  not contend that this is a bad thing.  Far from it - it signals

  I do contend that the duplication is unnecessary, both to the

  I am therefore formally requesting that discussion on
  reunification of Traveller and XBoat be opened, with the proposed

  This is not to be taken as an objection to redivision, or a new

Does anybody know if majordomo makes it possible to automatically

Just a thought to reduce congestion in the mailboxes of those people

As a dedicated fan of Classic Traveller who doesn\'t own MT nor T:NE, I 
support a reunification of the lists.  I think people can refrain from 
flaming others\' tastes in Traveller flavors.  (Besides, we should all 
agree to police this sort of thing, and hopefully Rob will boot truly 
abusive folks off the list.)

I don\'t know how difficult it would be to create another list if it 
becomes necessary after T4 is introduced, though.  Maybe Rob would rather 
not go through that, eh?  Might be easier for him to keep Xboat around, 
which he can then designate as the CT/MT/TNE list, leaving the Traveller 
list for T4 (or whatever division seems logical at the time).

What do you say, Rob?

What is bad is when you are also on GDW-Beta where the ship design stuff
is being designed.  I frequently get the same message three times.

Actually Paul, the list ADMIN could issue an edict similar to:

>From your ADMIN:

     The Traveller Mailing List is for discussions about any Traveller
     version of Traveller.  All discussions regarding T4 should be 
     discussed here.  

     The Xboat mailing list is for discussions of Classic and Mega-
     Traveller.  TNE and T4 discussions are not permitted there.
     Any one on Xboat who wishes to discuss T4, or follow its development
     should subscribe to Traveller as well as Xboat.

     Cease and desist any further posts to Xboat that relates to T4 or MMT.
     
     Cross posts should be kept to a minimum, and should only address specific
     issues that are important to both list such as administravia, or questions
     of a generic nature such as "Why was there no Grandmother for Grandfather"
     that needs the input from multi-era people.  Announcments of Web sits, and
     other things that are of the common good are ok to be cross posted.

Now these two lists have very specific missions.  T4 seems to be important to both
lists, but specifically by the charters of the two mailing lists, T4, while its 
roots are CT/MT, is clearly to be discussed in Traveller, and since its not CT/MT
should not be discussed in Xboat.

Discussion?  Do we need a list to discuss the RFD?

     Personally, I\'d prefer that not happen.  I only subscribe to the
Xboat list, because I don\'t *ever* want to hear *anything* about TNE
(admittedly, some comment about that filth occasionally leaks over into
Xboat, but life is much better here than on the original TML).

     If the lists were consolidated, I\'d have to completely unsubscribe,
and as one of the original members of the old TML, I don\'t think I\'d
like that too much.

Actually, there\'s a patch that will let Word 5.1 on the Mac read and write
Word 6 files. It goes in the Word Commands folder, and works
nicely.Admittedly, I haven\'t had much call to use it, but it did let me
help out my cousin, who had typed her resume on a PC/Word 6 in Washington
and needed it printed off here in OK.

If anyone\'s interested, I can mail it as an attachment.

I\'m not sure what you mean.  I meant Word 5.  A lot of people upgraded
on up to 5, but Microsoft screwed up version 6 (at least on the Mac)
bad enough that a lot of people stopped there.  It\'s bad enough that
MS took out ads in Europe apologizing for how it came out.

As specified in 2300 and FFS you are right.  <g> However, if you
require several seconds to bring the sutter up to speed or to actually
turn it off, say for mechanical reasons, then it will have very fast
pseudo-acceration and psuedo-decelleration.  Then throw in a limit on
the speed that you can slew the direction of the stutterwarp dirve,
say because it needs to be firmly secured to a framework in the hull
you can only change direction by 10 degrees per second, and it takes
18 seconds to reverse direction.
 
Would it still run rings around reaction and standard thruster plates? 
Sure would!  <g>

Of course, you could further limit the stutters.  They could take
longer to pseudo-accelerate.  The turn rate could be even worse, say
the stutter can\'t turn at all, you\'ve got to rotate the ship by other
means...just how fast can you flip a 2000tonne neddle with gyros?  You
could cap their pseudo-speed at lower k/s by making the number of
jumps per second lower and/or the distance per jump smaller.  

I\'m going to play with making stutterswarps sub-c only (or maybe max
them at low c), and use them in the same game where jump is the
standard FTL.  Stutter would be the standard MDrive, and a backup FTL
if you lose the JDrive or something.  <g> I\'ll see how this plays out.

Oh BTW, how does a Stutterwarp match orbital velocity with a planet? 
Or even worse, how would it match velocity with deep space base?  It\'s
got to have some *real* thrust coming from somewhere!

I agree.   I get the digest version, and whichever I read second
now takes next to no time to skim through, as I have already
read most of the articles.  I wouldn\'t want to unsubscribe from
one as I  wouldn\'t want to miss the odd article that\'s only posted
to it.

I would second this.

To me, the idea that there can\'t be any kind of cross-fertilisation
between the different flavours of Traveller is ridiculous.  Don\'t
like the TNE stats for an interesting NPC?  Substitute some CT/
MMT stats instead.  The real work is there in the ideas of the
description and character.  Stats are easy.  Don\'t like the CT
description of a long endurance stealth intelligence cruiser
because the CT description doesn\'t include the dimensions of
the waste water pipes in the plumbing system?  Maybe the
posting might inspire you to design your own version of the ship.
Maybe you could just skip over it.  Personally, I have to confess
that I am not too interested in the rock-velocity-planet-boom
thread, but hell, it\'s relevant to Traveller, and if people want to
discuss it that\'s fine by me, I\'ll just skip to the next thing that
does interest me.

This is getting a bit much like the Wars of Religion for my liking.  Is it
really that much of an effort just to move on to an article that does
not offend your principles?  I think that if we all got this blinkered we
could end up with a proliferation of mailing lists - CT, MT, TNE, MMT,
CT with planet killing rocks, CT without planet killing rocks etc etc.  If
we all tried really hard we could end up with a list each that suited us
perfectly.  You could then be master of your own domain, where the
things you weren\'t keen on never darkened your RAM.  Conversation
would be a bit dull, mind.

Reality check:  It is only a GAME, much as we all love it.  A bit of
toleration for the things we don\'t like but others do might make
the list a more productive and interesting place. (Apologies for
sounding like the end of a Disney film..)

So, I would support a trial of a merged list.  After a while perhaps
we could all be invited to comment on what has really annoyed
us all and what we have liked most.  This might indicate the most
appropriate ways of splitting the lists should we need to.

I for one like things the way they are. I don\'t subscribe to the Traveller list
because I never purchased TNE, but I do appreciate hearing about T4 on
the Xboat list because it directly relates to CT/MT. The Xboat list fills my
mailbox enough. I don\'t want to subscribe to both. Can\'t we save the
reorganization of the lists until T4 is released? By then it will be more
clear how to do it.

Sorry. I was bringing my PC baggage with me. I didn\'t realize there was a
Word 5 for the Mac. The Windows version of Word went from version 2
straight to version 6.

The one thing that you need to remember here, as an Xboat only is just how
much TNE is being discussed on Traveller: none.  zip.  zilch.  There are
however TNE vs. CT vs. MT and which one will MMT favor.  There has been so
little TNE (specific questions to that system, virus talk etc) that it has
become so minor, it shouldn\'t bother CT purists.  Most of the TNE content
messages on Traveller are currently being posted to Xboat any way.

I want people to use the lists as they are chartered, which has MMT being
discussed in Traveller and not Xboat, since MMT is not CT or MT (may be very
close, but . . .)

The rules governing stutterwarps in 2300AD required that ships spend around
40 hours discharging in a gravity well every 7.7 light years travelled. 
This well had to be higher than .1g, at which point the warp efficiency
plummeted to "poor chemical thruster" levels.  In my campaigns using this
system, much of the time spent discharging was used alternatively
free-falling deeply into the well and stuttering back to the .1g limit
again.  The net effect of this is to accumulate a new (real space) vector
of the right amount for your next destination.  For a high example, forty
hours at 1g is certainly enough (144km/s) for most nearby stellar
velocities and well over anything required within systems.

I\'m not a CT purist; I use both CT and MT when it suits my needs. My only
real concern here is the amount of messages going to my mailbox. I went
to PC Expo on Wednesday, so the mail piled up in my mailbox. When I
came back to work on Thursday, I had so many messages (most of them
from the Xboat list) that it took me over an hour to go through them all. At
work, I can\'t afford that kind of time. I can\'t imagine what would happen if
I subscribed to both lists--every day I would have that situation, I
suppose, while with just the one list I only had to deal with it because I
missed a day in the office. 

I guess that causes me to change my point: I am in support of ONE list that
I can subscribe to, where I can get info on CT/MT/T4 (since I have already
ordered an advance copy). The Xboat list has been serving that task for
me nicely; I just don\'t know what goes on in the other list. If we can have
a situation like that, I\'ll be happy, no matter what you call the list.

Maybe, if you want to unify the lists, we can let people on the Traveller
list talk about CT/MT too, not just TNE and MMT. If that were to happen,
perhaps the Xboat list would phase itself out. We\'re mostly (I think) adults
here, I\'m sure that CT enthusiasts can check their flaming of TNE people
and vice versa.

CT and MT are more than welcome to be discussed on Traveller.  That is the
purpose of the list.  Traveller has been and always will be open to discuss
anything with the Traveller name on it. 

Xboat was formed because the CT/MT purists (which I consider myself btw) got
really pee-ed off at TNE and virus and they wanted a TNE free zone.  Traveller
did not exile CT/MT purists, but they left on their own.  Everyone on
Traveller welcomes any and all Traveller discussions.

Now about the volume of mail:  It is probably at an all time high right now
for this list with maybe the exception of when TNE was released.  The
biggest problem is the cross-posting.  Many people are on both lists which
means they get both groups and doubles on every cross post.

The solution:  All T4 traffic on Traveller only, and no cross posts.

> How was the Imperium organised during its heyday? Was it an elective

Actually, for the most part, the Imperium was dynastic.  There was 1 
period when this ceased to be true.  The Civil War of 604-622 
occurred when Olav Hault-Plankwell, Grand Admiral of the Marches, 
assassinated Empress Jacqueline.  Olav was the 2nd Emperor to succeed 
by right of assassination.  The first, which had removed Cleon the 
Mad, had been sanctioned by the moot.  The murder of Jacqueline 
kicked off a 2 decade period where basically any admiral who had 
control of a few fleets, a lot of ambition, and more nerve, could 
move his fleet into the Core sector, kill off the last admiral to 
kill the Emperor, and become Emperor himself.  These Emperors were 
the so called Barracks Emperors.  This might have gone on in indefinitely, 
except for Arbellatra, who knocked off the last of the Barracks 
Emperors.  Arbellatra, unlike her predecessors, knew that she would not be 
immediately supported as Emperor.  She proclaimed herself Regent, 
promising to rule only until a legitimate heir to the throne could be 
found.  Of course, anybody with any sort of legitimate claim to the 
throne was basically freeze dried meat in space, or 2 meters 
underground at the time, so the net result was that Arbellatra 
became Emperor a few years later.

This restored the principle of dynastic succession, which continued 
until the assassination of Strephon in 1116 by Dulinor.  At this 
point, the Imperium ceased to exist as a single, unified entity.

Theoretically, the Moot is supposed to approve Imperial candidates, 
but with about 3 exceptions, it acted as a rubber stamp body. 

1)  When Cleon the Mad became emperor, the moot actively plotted his 
assassination, and his murderer was proclaimed Emperor by right of 
Assassination.

2) The vast majority of the Barracks Emperors were never approved by 
the Moot.

3)  The Moot never got an opportunity to approve or deny Lucan\'s 
claim to the throne after the deaths of Strephon, his heir, and 
Varian (Lucan\'s older brother) during the Rebellion.  Lucan fearing 
what the Moot might have to say, dissolved it for a year, and then 
began to stuff the Moot to his favor by disenfranchising numerous 
nobles who opposed him, and granting new titles and fiefs to a number 
of his lackeys.

The Imperial family had vast holdings in most of the megacorporation, 
as well as fiefs on numerous worlds.  Don\'t know about your comments 
on raiding the Imperial treasury, but if their holdings in the 
megacorps amounted to what they should, I doubt any of the Emperors 
ever wanted for money.  Somebody else could probably 
answer this question better than I could.

Ok, so what you\'re saying is that the Traveller list is for all versions of
Traveller: CT/MT/TNE/MMT. Then Xboat is only for CT/MT, with absolutely
no discussion of TNE/MMT. However, if you have a topic that can also
apply to CT/MT, and you\'re on the Traveller list, you want to cross-post
your message so EVERYBODY gets the message. 

I may be new to this list, but that sounds dumb to me. How many CT/MT
purists can there be out there that can\'t just delete a message when it
pertains to TNE/MMT? Most of the topics I\'ve seen have to do with things
that can apply to all versions, or have to do with MMT, which should be of
interest to all. And, it seems, that most people here on Xboat do have a
healthy interest in MMT. In light of all this, it seems, that Xboat should be
deleted, and Traveller set up as the ONLY Traveller list. That way, the
Xboat people could talk about CT and MT all they want, and their
messages could just be in the mix of the rest, and things would be simpler
for everybody.

Does this sound right, or am I starting to make enemies? :)

I\'m not certain the Klingons have quite the preoccupation with land 
that the Aslan do.  I can see the "honor" comparisons right off...  
Actually, the way they\'ve been portrayed in later series, I see 
almost as many comparisons to the Vargr as the Aslan (as long as you 
substitute "charisma" for "honor")

On the other hand, if you think about it, the way Klingons have been 
portrayed in Star Trek is inconsistent.  

In the original Star Trek, they were cardboard cutout villains...no 
depth of character whatsoever, no explanation of motives...  Only 
goal was to kill men in red uniforms, and be killed by bridge crew of 
the Enterpoop...

In Next Generation, they were portrayed with kind of a Code of 
Bushido air to them (honor was more important than life, etc).

Now in DS9, they\'re portrayed almost as a race at war with itself, in 
a near constant state of turmoil...hence my Vargr comparisons...

It makes sense to me, but you probably are starting to make

More likely, it used 3rd derivative forces. But that gets into a *long*

Here\'s a good idea.  How about switches that allow for complete viewing 
of the detail of the main world then the rest of the worlds are fully 
generated but the detail levels are set by the user.  ie. exaustive, 
plenty, enough, bare minimum.

The problem still remains that you have to be able to feed in the main 
world\'s UPP and TPP (?) and get a system that makes sence to these 
readings.

Right now here is a rough break down (guestmates actually) of the traffic of
the combined list (if someone wants to go through the digests and count them
feel free to):

    System Comparison:  30%   (i.e. I like CT better, no I like TNE)
    MMT Related         40%   (Skills, weapons etc.  Carries a lot of the above
                               with it)
    TNE Related:        3%
    MT Related:         3%
    CT Related:         3%
    Generic to all:     10%
    Admin:              10%
    Other:              1%

Right now, about 50% of the traffic (not all of the first two catagories) is
being cross posted.  If the lists are used like they should be, only the
Generic and Admin should be cross posted.

Personally, I like the idea of one list -- it makes my life easier.  But I
am not objectionable to more either.  However, we don\'t know what T4 will
look like.  When TNE came out it alienated a bunch of people.  When T4 comes
out it could: a) Tick off the CT/MT crowd again, b) Tick off the TNE crowd,
or c) make the world a happy place (which is the one I am cheering for).  At
the point that T4 comes out, we may want to create a TNE refuge, just like
we did for Xboat.  But it doesn\'t change the Traveller Charter, which is to
discuss Traveller regardless of version.

So in the mean time, until T4 comes out, I don\'t want to make any changes,
but the level of cross posting is out of control, so I am reminding people
of the charters of both lists.  My recommendation is instead of combining
the lists, limit MMT to one to reduce the large amounts of cross posts and
let the lists do their thing and serve their charters.

Well, first of all, the immediate thing that you probably wouldn\'t know
about the Aslan sans Alien module is the gender division.

Aslan females outnumber Aslan males about 3 to 1.

The females take on a variety of non-combat roles - including all
medical, financial, technical, technical support, educational,
etc, etc, issues.

Aslan males deal almost excusively with leadership, politics and
warfare. According to the skill slisted, Aslan males are
unable to deal with even simple concepts like _money_ without
having a special skill to do so.

The Aslan will often ignore a non-Aslan\'s true gender and refer
to a being using a gender selected on the basis of that being\'s
job or skill set. E.g. a ship\'s captain will always be refered
to with male pronouns, a ship\'s doctor or engineer will always have
female pronouns used for them. This faux pas is probably more common
among males than females, as females get educated at least.

This is very unlike the Klingons, who are all ass-kicking
types apparently. Also, Klingons seem to have a more 
"human" sex ratio - men do everything, with the occassional
female character so the producers can throw a pair of breasts
onscreen. (ST and all its offspring still have the most awful
females roles.)

Isn\'t this what both the Aslan and the Vargr serve to do in Traveller? ;)

Yes, this is fairly Aslan.

I think the idea is that there\'s a big battle for control of the Klingon
race... this is actually not unlike the Aslan, where there are
various competing clans, who fight not only outsiders (Imperium/.
Solomani) but each other. There are distinct, clear clan lines
that can be drawn for the Aslan however, unlike the Vargr, who,from
a human perspective, seem to fight with anyone.

I think the Aslan are motivated somewhat by the Kzin (Kzinti?)
of Larry Niven\'s "Known Space" universe.

If I was to risk being a cynic, I\'d also note that both the Aslan
and the Vargr suffer badly from the "humans in rubber suits"
syndrome. The K\'kree are a bit better, then the Droyne and the
Hivers are probably the most alien aliens. Though none of
the Traveller aliens could be described as "bad head jobs"
(well, not much).

Only if you are playing them as humans in furry suits, which is the 
way Star Trek portrayed the Klingons, for the most part...  :-)

I\'ve used Vargr and Aslan in my campaigns on quite a few occasions.  
As I run them, they have very clearly defined motives which go beyond 
opposing the players.  They just may not be motives as humans would 
define them...

Probably a better comparison than the Klingons...

Actually, the K\'kree are probably the least human of all the aliens 
in Traveller.  The thought of killing a sentient lifeform because 
they MIGHT be a threat, is difficult for me to comprehend.

Your point is taken about the rubber suit syndrome.  But hey, what\'s 
a space opera without a few humans in funny suits... ;-)

Yes, I\'m aware of that rule in 2300, however flitting around orbit for
almost 2 days matching orbits isn\'t a viable option in most
Travellerisk games.  I could stick a Grav drive on the ship for real
velocity change near planets, but there are problems having
stutterwarp and grav drives powerful enough to match orbital
velocities in the same game. Still thinking about it...

When you think about it because of the way stutterwarp works.  Micro 
jumps.  Could you not simply accumulate momentum in a forward direction 
then as the ship is jumping turn it slightly the momentum would still be 
in a forward direction (as far as the ships concerned) then you just have 
to match velocities with the planet drive around it and come at it from 
the right angle.  THis is similar to what was mentioned before but 
faster.

Land ship, offload cargo, load cargo, go to orbit, engage stutterwarp 
with orbital velocity entact, adjust velocity to match new planet, arrive 
new planet, land etc.

   I do NOT agree.

   The division of the lists exists for a reason. The solution is to
   convince people to stop cross-posting.

   Is there really any reason to post QSDS designs in all three mailing
   lists? Pick ONE list and mail to it - anyone who gets annoyed at
   multiple posters PLEASE send the offending parties mail, I\'ll start
   doing the same. Hopefully things will calm down and mailing list
   volume will drop to sane levels.

   Actually, I\'d like to propose a list called "Continuing Threads",
   that way threads that are beating the horse to death can continue
   without annoying too many people. To make this work, all we need
   is a little cooperation.

   *THINK* before you crosspost.

I assume that during the Civil War, venality figured as much as power-lust
in many, if not most, of the attempts to seize the throne.  As rich as
admirals no doubt were, the wealth controlled by the Imperial family would
be orders of magnitude greater, and thus tempting.  The ability to raid the
treasury to finance repair, upgrading, and additions to the
Admiral/Emperor\'s fleet would also have some appeal.  In addition, while
probably all of the admirals involved were nobles, the power of the emperor
was orders of magnitude greater -- including the ability to make new nobles
- -- and also tempting.  

Other than during that period, however, I think Stu is right that the
emperors never wanted for money (for themselves or their families).  Raiding
the treasury was probably unnecessary.

No, they acted like any superpower, trying to get non-aligned worlds to join
their empire by whatever means.  For example, in The Trouble with Tribbles,
they poison the quadrotriticale to cause a famine on contested worlds that
only they will be able to help.  In A Dirty Little War, they\'re slowly
increasing the tech level of the lowlanders so that they\'ll come to dominate
the highlanders, and will join the Klingon Empire.  
You\'re correct that their personal motivations were never explored, which
was one of the shortcomings of the series.

You\'ll have to decide if these fit the tech level, but off the top of
my head:

o	mass-spectrographic analyzer
o	various "scanners" for examining objects and surfaces at high
	resolution and various wavelengths
o	possibly nanotech "ants" that search for traces of hair, skin,
	fiber, oils, etc under the control of the cpu in the kit


Basicly, you set the thing down, describe the area to search (room,
structure, area of ground) and it sends out the "ants", to look for
anything that might bear checking out. They record the location of
anything small enough to carry and bring it back for analysis. Larger
objects are either called to the attention of the investigator or
carried by multiple "ants".

So the tiniest drop of blood or strand of hair will be found, and a DNA
analysis run, giving you a rough picture of the person. Sure, you\'ll
get *lots* of data, but so what? As with fingerprints now, you\'ll get
samples from the people known to have been in the area, and try to
track down the unknowns.

Of course, *professional* criminals will have similar kits to "tidy up"
the scene. :-)

Luckily, professionals are rare.

No, more like the Hani in C. J. Cherryh\'s "Pride of Chanur", the Chanur

Try reading some Cherryh! Hani are *not* human, though comprehensible
without too much trouble. The Sstho are weird. The Mahendosat are odd,
the Kif are *really* weird (by the end of the trilogy I could managed
to (sort of) comprehend the Kif worldview. That was *scary*). Then
there\'s the K\'nnn and the T\'caa which are just plain *alien*. 

She has a few other alien races floating around too, but these are the
ones she\'s written the most about. She also has some *human* cultures
that are different enough to make Zhodani, Vilani and Solomani look
like brothers.

Personal motivations was what I was talking about...  Your points are 
valid as well...

IMHO, even though people wax nostalgic about the original serious, 
the successor series have had a lot more meat on their bones in terms 
of true science fiction...

But, I still like the original series, anyways...

Well, in that case, this is my last post to Xboat. I will be joining the
Traveller list, not for TNE info, but for T4 info, since I am interested in that
as well and have already ordered an advance copy, and it seems clear
that this is not the place to discuss it.

Sounds like many of you are also subscribed to Traveller. If so, see you
on the other side!

I hadn\'t considered this but on reflection you\'re right.  Is
this because they\'re a dynamic, \'evolving\' (not in a
Darwinian sense) race or because they hadn\'t been thought out
well enough to begin with?

One of the (many) things I liked about early Traveller was
the work done on the aliens.  From the first (Aslan as it
happens) alien module, a lot of thought and detail went into
making them.  (Which reminds me, was the name \'aslan\' a
tribute to C.S. Lewis or did he get the word from somewhere
else yet?)  I still think the two MegaT alien volumes are
incredible pieces of work.

I seem to remember a David Gerrold book letting us know they
flatulated in air-locks!  (I think this was demonstrate how
*really* nasty they were.)

But given Classic Trek was ahead of its time anyway, it\'s a
bit much to expect super-detailed aliens right off.  (Though
one would have thought they could have improved over three
years worth of series)

This is certainly what I was imagining was similar to the
Aslan.

I see what you mean. I hadn\'t considered that maybe other
races would have their Star Trek comparisons too!  (though I
don\'t recall seeing anything hiver like - unless you count Q
manipulating!)

Surely the idea that they are \'humans in rubber suits\' only
comes about if they\'re not being role played well.  With all
the background, history and culture developed for T (starting
with the Alien modules), there has long been the opportunity
to have \'alien\' aliens.  As for looking humanish, I thought
that was why the whole thing with the Ancients was brought in
- - to provide a rationale for that.

At least they\'re not as \'samey\' as Star Trek TNG aliens which
simply seem to involve lumps of make up here and there.  (Was
that Ethan was referring to as \'bad head jobs\'?)

The power consumption for thrust-plate maneuver drives was wrong.  It should
be 1Mw per cubic meter of drive.  I made a formula error in converting to
QSDS (which uses displacement tons for volume calculations), and had them
using 1Mw per displacement ton of drive - too low by a factor of 14.

The latest version of QSDS, 1.2 incorporates this correction (this is the
only substantive difference between version 1.1 and 1.2).  It is available
in Microsoft Word format from my Web site:

The ASCII and Adobe PDF copies of QSDS will be updated as soon as possible.
Don Perrin informs me that the correction was also reported to Imperium

I\'d have to say that the 2 races that are most unique in the game are 
probably the K\'kree & the Hivers...  I haven\'t seen anything similar 
to them in the SF I\'ve read, but maybe I just haven\'t read the right 
books...

Actually I don\'t beleive they refference the origin of the name Aslan.  
Though the Aslan themselves have a different name for themselves.  The 
humans refer to them as Aslan, for reasons they don\'t fully comprehend.

You\'ll have to decide if these fit the tech level, but off the top of
my head:

o     mass-spectrographic analyzer
o     various "scanners" for examining objects and surfaces at high
     resolution and various wavelengths
o     possibly nanotech "ants" that search for traces of hair, skin,
     fiber, oils, etc under the control of the cpu in the kit


Basicly, you set the thing down, describe the area to search (room,
structure, area of ground) and it sends out the "ants", to look for
anything that might bear checking out. They record the location of
anything small enough to carry and bring it back for analysis. Larger
objects are either called to the attention of the investigator or
carried by multiple "ants".

So the tiniest drop of blood or strand of hair will be found, and a DNA
analysis run, giving you a rough picture of the person. Sure, you\'ll
get *lots* of data, but so what? As with fingerprints now, you\'ll get
samples from the people known to have been in the area, and try to
track down the unknowns.

Of course, *professional* criminals will have similar kits to "tidy up"
the scene. :-)

Luckily, professionals are rare.

Well, the \'rubber suit\' comment comes from the fact that
morphologically (ie. shape-wise) they\'re far too similar
to humans. It\'s a bit more realistic (did I really say that?)
too have aliens that are a bit less human.

The Ancients do explain the Vargr, but the Aslan, well, they\'re
just lucky I guess. Though, the coyns had pictures of the
Aslan _before_ they went to the stars, didn\'t they? Hmmm...

I wonder if there are any alien races in Traveller that reflect

The Answer:

Actually, I asked this same question a year or two ago, and the response
from Loren K Wiseman was that yes, that is indeed where the name for the
Aslan came from. I\'ve got the mail backed up on a floppy somewhere if you
want more substantial proof :)

I wonder if Marc could help us out here as I\'ve long thought
that \'Aslan\' was a name coined by C.S.Lewis for his Narnia
books.  If he took the word from prior source I\'d be
interested to know.

As he (Lewis, not MWM ASFAIK!) and Tolkien knew each other,
the whole \'world\' of old european languages (and probably more)
may have been available to him.

I assume that during the Civil War, venality figured as much as power-lust
in many, if not most, of the attempts to seize the throne.  As rich as
admirals no doubt were, the wealth controlled by the Imperial family would
be orders of magnitude greater, and thus tempting.  The ability to raid the
treasury to finance repair, upgrading, and additions to the
Admiral/Emperor\'s fleet would also have some appeal.  In addition, while
probably all of the admirals involved were nobles, the power of the emperor
was orders of magnitude greater -- including the ability to make new nobles
- -- and also tempting.

Other than during that period, however, I think Stu is right that the
emperors never wanted for money (for themselves or their families).  Raidin=

While I\'m all for having really \'alien\' aliens, I would have
thought that in Traveller (and Star Trek for that matter)
human\'ish\' aliens were almost a prerequisite for having
conflict/interaction/role playing possibilities.  (After all,
an \'energy blob\' might just about make an NPC but is possibly
not going to be the height of fun for a PC.  (Though I stand
to be corrected.)

It seems to me that if we did reach the stars and find it
well populated, we would be more likely to have on-going
dealings with the more \'human\' aliens.  Anyone care to argue
that the K\'Kree and Hivers are on the limit of being
reasonably \'playable\'?

I thought someone mentioned the coyns might have been faked
(or added to by Grandfather at a later date) - can\'t say this
is a speciality of mine though so I may be wrong.

>"Another new alien race? Hm, we\'ve used pointy ears, pointy

You\'d have thought it would be cheaper to concentrate on the
alieness of their societies rather than bodies (considering
that they\'ve got to played by Earthling actors).  But even
their societies often seemed to be simply means for
portraying some particular aspect of (American) culture.

Sorry, I wasn\'t here all that time ago! (Work only got e-mail
about a year ago and it took me some time to find you guys!)

Don\'t worry about the \'proof\', I\'m quite content to believe
that LKW took the name from C.S. Lewis.  However, I checked
my Turkish dictionary this morning to discover that \'aslan\'
is in  fact the Turkish for \'lion\'.  So, I assume that Lewis
got *his* idea from this.

(I take no credit for finding this out, someone e-mailed me
direct with this suggestion which made me check my dictionary
collection.  As s/he may wish to remain anonymous for
whatever reason, I won\'t embarass them - but thanks!).

Hell, many aliens (and *most* players) are not just "humans in funny
suits". They are "contemporary Western Culture humans in funny suits".

I\'ve seen enough "role-players" who couldn\'t even take into account the
way that *humans* from a different culture react differently, to say
nothing of considering *alien* motivations. As an example, an idiot
who got in an argument with a "samurai" type character over some action
the group was taking. The idiot was about to state the the "samurai\'s"
word wasn\'t good enough when he *literally* got tackled by the less
idiotic types. This guy would probably offer a K\'kree a hamburger...

Players who *can* handle different cultures manage to handle aliens
moderately well. But they are rare. <sigh>

Gordon Dickson has written some books that have aliens who are truly
alien. That is, they are logical, reasonable beings. But the very basis
of their thought/culture is quite different. In one case, the main
difference between us and them was that our culture is "based" on
"rightness". That is, a thing is good or bad depending on how "right"
it is. For the aliens, it was "respectable/not respectable" or at least
that\'s the closest humans could come to the concept. Not that this is
*not* "honor" it\'s something more than a little different. And unless
you could keep it in mind *all* the time, the aliens would keep doing
the unexpected.

Then of course, we have C.J. Cherryh. I\'d *love* to see what\'d happen
if you placed her "Compact" just the other side of the K\'kree and
Hivers. K\'kree trying to deal with Kif would be fun. And Sshto and
mahendosat trying to deal with Hivers (and vice versa) would be almost
as good.

Aslan was lifted from C S Lewis as a descriptor of a feline / lionoid race. I
used the term at GDW for some time prior to inserting it in Traveller. ASAIK,
published material in Traveller have always said "No one knows how this name
came to be applied to the "Aslan"."

I agree that it\'s a realistic explanation.  We don\'t have much direct
canonical evidence for it.  There are occasional references to entire
planets held as reserves by wealthy families, and the Imperial family owns
significant stakes in the biggest megacorporations (which in itself makes
them wealthier than any other individuals).

The easiest solution (and one that involves no change to existing QSDS designs)
is to note that QSDS power plants contain fuel for only 6 months, not 1 year.

Since starships will ordinarily refuel after every jump, the duration is not
expected to be a major concern.  Designers should install twice the listed
amount of fuel if they require an unrefuelled duration of a year.

SUBJECT : re marc replies

tc>I wonder if Marc could help us out here as I\'ve long
tc>thought that \'Aslan\' was a name coined by C.S.Lewis

Not the first time stuff I\'ve "long thought" has had to be
revised!


marc>Aslan was lifted from C S Lewis as a descriptor of a feline / lionoid race. I
marc>used the term at GDW for some time prior to inserting it in Traveller. ASAIK,
marc>published material in Traveller have always said "No one knows how this name
marc>came to be applied to the "Aslan"."

Evidently a Scout of Turkish origin on an early expedition
out \'thataway\'.

Many thanks for the response.

Can I just apologize to xboat readers for managing to repost
half a digest in error.  (Sorry, my e-mail is a rather
primitive package and didn\'t warn me it would do anything
like that.  I shall beware in future.)

Likewise, I\'m sorry I can\'t get a \'subject\' line included but
if I \'reply\' to a message it seems to ignore any subject line
I put in.  That one I can\'t fix.

While we\'re back on the subject, can I suggest Psicology
rather than Psionicology?  It may be too late but I\'d vote
for this for two reasons:

a) it\'s a nice subtle distinction between it and psychology
       (indeed the pronounciation is the same which might
make for interesting misunderstanding as well endless
possibilities for (supressed) psionics to confuse issues).


b) it\'s much less of a mouthful

Ok, here\'s a bit more info on the sort of thing I like to use for
my MT character generation; sorry I took so long, I didn\'t bring my
Traveller stuff to the hospital. <green-faced>

The Single-roll career generation:
==================================
Instead of rolling separately for survival, commission, promotion and
special duty, I find it faster to use a single roll with the
results indicating wether this was a good or bad term.  It removes a
bit of generation details on the one hand (for example, you can\'t
have
both a commission and a promotion in the same term, but on the 
average the number of skills should be about equivalent.  I haven\'t
done the maths to prove it though)  but it can add a lot more details
on the other hand.

The base roll is 7 for ALL careers.  I picked that because it seems
to
be a fairly good average of all the other rolls for all the careers.
It might seem like it removes the danger from taking the more
daunting
careers but in fact, what matters are the DM\'s applied to the dice
roll.
Here they are:
Career          DM+1 for each of
Navy            Edu 8+,Int 7+,Soc 9+
Marines         Edu 7+,End 8+,Soc 8+
Army            Dex 7+,Edu 7+,End 8+
Scouts          Str 8+,End 9+,Int 6+
Flyer           Dex 7+,Edu 6+,End 7+
Sailor          Edu 6+,End 6+,Int 7+
Law Enf         Edu 7+,Int 7+,Dex10+
Doctor          Dex 8+,Int 7+
Diplomat        Edu 8+,Int 6+,Soc 9+
Bureau          Edu 6+,Int 6+,Soc 5+
Scientist       Int 7+,Edu 7+
Noble           Edu 9+,Int 10+
Merchant        Str 6+,Int 6+
Belter          +1 per term
Pirate          Str 9+,Int 8+,Soc 7+
Rogue           End 7+,Int 9+,Soc 8+
Hunter          Str 7+,Dex 7+,End 7+
Barbarian       Str 7+,End9+,Int 6+

The roll of the dice determines how good/bad your term was.
(Roll+DM)-(Base+Setbacks)       Result
- -3                              Major Setback (counts as two)
- -1                              Minor Setback
0                               Survives and reenlists
+1                              Special Duty (+1 skill)
+2                              Promotion    (+2 skill)
+3                              Special Duty (+3 skill)
+4                              Comission    (+4 skill)

Where Roll is your dice roll, DM is the DMs above, Base = 7 and
Setbacks is the total number of setbacks this character has had.

When 12+DM < Base+Setbacks, then your character MUST quit active
duty.

When you roll a +2, your character receives BOTH a promotion and a 
special duty.
On a +4, only a Commission is received.

Term Effects: (added to improve role-playing depth)
=============
When you\'ve determined what kind of term you got, you must choose
from the following tables what exactly happened:        (note, these
aren\'t complete! :) 
Never pick the same result twice. 
Retirement is only possible if you had a positive result on this
term.

Major Setback: (things that happened to you. These are very BIG
screw-ups,
that go beyond simple career effects, and should be part of the
adventures/background/etc).  
So as to avoid heaping too much trouble on the PC (it would be
unrealistic) the referee can decided to change further Major Setbacks
to either Demotion, Forced Retirement or something appropriate.
The point is to convince the PC to quit while he\'s ahead. :) 
1- PC dies: PC is a clone, or has had a stroke, brain damage, etc.
2- PC screws up on a galactic scale: Might lead to 1, as she\'s made
        a major ennemy.
3- Excommunicated: You did something that really pissed the
Intemporeal.
        (ex: Mentally undressing a Zhodani Woman in a Zhodani church
:)
4- Racial group victim of genocide: You had to drop everything and
escape.
5- Comitted a crime.
6- Became allergic to your homeworld environment.
7- PC crashed a ship on a major urban center.
8 - PC part of a Scandal involving members of the Moot and a group
of, mh,
   \'entertainment\' androids. 
9- The PC\'s whole family dies.

Minor Setbacks: Things that happened to your career and affected
no one else.
1 - Wounded; Reduce one stat by 1, unless PC has enough money at the
end
    to pay for a repair job, cybernetics/cloning/etc at homeworld TL.
2 - Demoted:  Lose a rank
3 - Chased out of office, no more promotion until Commission rolled
again.
4 - Routine: No more special duty until Promotion/Commission.
5 - War: You get drafted into military service.
6 - Bad investment: Lose benefits for this term.
etc etc.

Promotions REDUCE Setbacks by 1 (minimum 0).
Commissions CLEAR all setbacks.

Special Duties are treated like the Service Skills in MT advanced
character generation.
Each career gets his list of services.  Roll the service the PC gets
enrolled into.  Then consult THAT Service\'s skill table, and let
the player PICK the skill in that table.
The rationale is that you might not be able to choose where you end
up (unless you volunteer :), but once you\'re there, you try your best
to retain the skills you were interested in.

Anyways - obviously that\'s not a complete system but I find it
interesting
and fairly well-balanced.  It gives the player the chance to have
some control over the direction the character is taking, and adds a 
layer to the role-playing background.
I see this as a middle ground between point-based systems and
completely
random systems.  Random systems should be ancient history - they
don\'t
really let the character evolve in your mind as you\'re creating it,
so you end up playing a character that might be cool, if you\'re lucky
or which you might not like at all.  Anyways. :)

Here\'s a few generation traces:
===============================
Underdog 444444,Average Joe 666666,GI Joe, 888888
The characters keep going till they can\'t possibly do anything good
anymore, which isn\'t exactly how things go during normal generation.

In the Navy:
The first number is the dice roll, the 2nd is the DM, the third is
the base (7) and the 4th is the setbacks.
Underdog:  Final score: 6 terms (he could have quit before)
                     7 skills. (reasonable, especially since even
losers
                     as supposed to be VIP\'s in Traveller).
                      2 setbacks, 2 major setbacks.
                                           
Average Joe:  Total: 3 terms, 6 skills. 2 major setbacks.

Gi Joe:  Total: 13 terms (70 years old), 4th rank, 26 skills (more
than
                HIS maximum.  Not taking into account the aging
                process. 1 minor, 3 major setbacks (by stretching
things)

Three Joes as Diplomats:
Underdog Joe: 
       total: 4 terms, 6 skills.  Pretty good. 3 major setbacks
(stretching)
       
Average Joe: 
            Total: 3 terms, 4 skills.  Poor guy. 3 major setbacks.
            
GI Joe: 
       total: 5 terms, 9 skills.  Not very good. 2 major setbacks.

Three barbarians:
Under: 
      Total: 3 terms, 6 skills. 2 major setbacks.
      
Average: 
        Total: 10 terms (not bad for a barbarian!), 19 skills.
                2 minor, 1 major setback.
                
Conan: 
       Total: 12 terms, 30 skills!!! 1 minor setback, 3 major
setbacks.


The morale is, don\'t get into a career you\'re not suited for, cuz
you\'ll
screw up before you\'re 30!


Real Example:
===============
Now we\'ll see how the system helps us be creative, and is really a 
lot faster than having to roll 4 times for everything.

Merchant A48B78, 
Term Roll/Target        Result
I - 6/7 -       Setback: No benefit this term. 2 skills:
                +1 Dex (to 4), vacc Suit-1.
II- 7/8         Setback: Routine. 1 skill.
                Electronics-1
III- 12/9       Special Duties: 4 skills.
+1 End (to 9), Computer School(Computer-1), Geer
School(Engineering-1), 
+1 Dex (to 5)
IV-  6/9        Major Setback: Ship misjumped to a Red Zone system. 1

                skill. +1 End (to A), Lost to aging.
V - 12/11       Special Duty. 2 skill
Space School(Ship\'s Boat-1), Space School(Tactics-1), -1 Str, -1 Dex,

- -1 End
Retires


Aklaphon Steroi, Merchant 949B98 Age 38 5 terms         Cr10,000
Vacc Suit-1, Electronics-1, Computer-1, Engineering-1,
Ship\'s Boat-1, Tactics-1

Steroi, an opportunistic, boisterous man, hoped to make a quick buck
selling inferior goods to inferior minds.  It didn\'t go as easily as
he\'d hoped.  Eventually, his bad trading habits came back and bit
him hard - he was sold inferior replacement parts for the ship he
was serving on, which misjumped into a Red Zone system.  Out of this
event, he made 3 major ennemies - the folks he\'d double-crossed and
who\'d quadruple-crossed him, the local Imperial Noble who had not
recommended a Red Zoning for nothing, and the Ship\'s Captain
because they had to abandon ship, and took the ship\'s boat back to
the
local noble\'s place, for evacuation.  

Massive and lumbering about slowly, he has become more tolerant of
others as he ages.  However he\'s been planning to get back to 
his ennemies, and been studying ways to do it in secret.


Anyways, I hope you like it.  Please comment/etc as I\'m sure you
will.  The results are probably very skewered, in the sense that
it\'s easy to make a total failure or a killer-char, so if you notice
it and think of a fix, let me know. :)
There are a few scenarios that aren\'t possible anymore (say, get
a promotion and then be thrown out) but usually that\'s for the
best (why promote someone if you\'re going to fire him?)

1) Vague and ambiguous:  Writing in what language?  from how long before the
Long Night? just before?

2) How intelligible without applying translation software?  By TL 12 (I
think that\'s Milieu 0), known languages will all be freely translatable by
computers; written forms will be the easiest because most consistent.  So if
the adventurers are in communication with a starship, or if they have a
computer with translation software with that language with them, they will
be able to read it as easily as their native language (which I assume is a
Sylean dialect of English). 

3) While the advent of general literacy has slowed the evolution of language
(at least of grammar; vocabulary changes constantly), the complete
dissemination of audiovisual recording equipment and records, in a culture
that relies on them constantly, will bring such evolution to a near
standstill.  

Between 2 and 3, if the pre-Long Night writing is English, the PCs will have
a pretty easy time reading it.

I don\'t recall seeing that, but the Imperial family does have 
significant holdings in all the megacorps, typically 4-5 percent.  
Exceptions are Instellarms with no direct ownership listed, and 
Zirunkariish with 18%.

Very rich indeed.

My advice is to quit playing silly language games and call the field
"Psionics". That\'s the *standard* meaning of the term (c.v
"electronics", "avionics", "gravitics", "physics", etc)

Psionics: (n) sy-on-ix.

Rob,

I\'m forwarding this to the lists not to increase bandwidth usage, but 
because I think it is important that others see your message and my reply.

First, let me say that I have not been inflexible in the amount of 
quoting I do.  When I saw the first post in XTML that complained about 
the amount of quoting, I began paying more attention to that.  While I 
may have occasionally slipped since then (I\'ve been on-line 
for many years, and old habits die hard), I feel I\'ve done a good job of 
keeping the quoting to that necessary to allow everyone - even those who 
haven\'t seen the original post (for instance, new subscribers, those 
who have been away on holiday, or those who simply, for whatever reason, 
didn\'t read the message I am replying to) - to follow the conversation.  

When I originally subscribed to these lists, I posted many of my house 
rules in Xboat, as you may recall if you subscribed at that time.  I have 
also tried to contribute meaningfully to the conversations ongoing.    
But, I noted that there were increasing complaints from some XMLers 
regarding the level of cross-posting and the number of lines quoted, so 
I stopped posting to XTML for the most part.  All of my new material 
appears only on TML.  

Since I want to have the widest possible audience for my contributions, 
it makes the most sense to post to the "all games welcome here" TML 
rather than the splinter-sect "Only CT and MT" XTML - even though I\'m 
primarily a CT referee.  

Now that I\'ve received your email complaint regarding the amount of 
quoting I do on TML, I\'m beginning to wonder whether posting to these 
lists is worth it at all.  Who needs to hear the numerous complaints 
about wasted bandwidth, when I\'m spending my free time trying to join in 
with the many other great people here who are enhancing the Traveller 
experience?  It\'s not like I quote entire posts and add only "yeah, I 
agree."  Every time I post, I try to add something meaningful to the 
discussion.  I may or may not succeed, depending on your perspective, but 
that is always my attempt.

I have been on-line for many years, and have developed a style of 
posting that I think conveys the most information in the best method.  
Others feel differently, and that\'s OK.  But I do not believe in the 
theory that X lines of quoting is going to work every time...no matter 
what number you substitute for X.  Some say 2 lines, and others would 
rather see no quoting.  I try to quote enough so that anyone coming into 
the conversation without having access to older posts will be able to 
follow the conversation.  I do this because I believe what we discuss 
here is that important.  

I admit that the current humor thread has perhaps too much quoting, but I 
took that as a part of the humor of the situation.  That thread is a 
parody of all the arguments we\'ve had recently, and I\'m enjoying it.  The 
fact that it\'s gotten to seven or so levels of quoting is part of the 
humor precisely because of people such as yourself who have posted to the 
lists asking for less quoting - another type of flame, which is being 
parodied.

If I\'ve been out of line in my quoting style because the mailing list 
culture is different from usenet and BBS culture, then I apologize.  If 
the people who contribute to this list feel that is the case, then I will 
change my ways.

Quoth Jamie Young:

> zone be like?

Much more temperate than Earth\'s.  With no mountain ranges or thermally-
active coastline barriers, the atmosphere would form just two convective
Hadley cells rather than the multitude that Earth has.  Water is also a
wonderful leveller of temperature variations: in past geologic eras on
Earth, the continental arragements that have allowed the greatest oceanic
circulation both north-south and east-west have tended to foster the most
consistent and idyllic climates.

> Would atmospheric currents form latitudinal bands, as on
> Jupiter?

No: Jupiter gets those bands because of its horrific rotation rate. I\'m
unsure whether they\'ve yet decided (perhaps Galileo will help?) whether
the ?solid? body of Jupiter rotates faster than does its atmosphere.

> Would the oceanographic/atmospheric interaction be unstable
> leading to global ice-ages?

I\'m not sure what you mean by this.  Could you elaborate?

> How would the climate differ between two

The shallow one\'s climate is likely to vary more, as subsurface mountain
ranges, volcanoes, etc. will have a greater effect on global circulation
patterns.  So you\'d possibly get significant regional variations (like
ice caps).

> I understand that photdisassociation of atmospheric water would give

Free oxygen is pretty durn reactive stuff.  I suspect much of it would
come out of the atmosphere to be dissolved in the world-ocean, which it
would in turn depart to oxidize seafloor mineral outcroppings.  You
wouldn\'t get a significant fraction of atmospheric oxygen unless and until
life arose.  As for the end ratio.... the main brake on our current level
of atmospheric oxygen is the danger of fire at high levels, but that
wouldn\'t be as much of a danger on a waterworld, so perhaps it would hit
the upper 20%\'s?  (That\'s a hand-waving guess).

They\'d form latitudinal bands like *Earth*. That\'s what the tradewinds
are. Ditto for the "doldrums".

You\'d also get some mondo storms, because tropical cyclones (hurricanes
& typhoons) wouldn\'t ever run into land masses. They\'d only die out
when they hit *really* cold water.

Hmmm. Good question.

Not sure. I think that what you need to worry about is what the ocean
currents look like, which depends a lot on the sub-surface topography.

Depends on the starting composition of the planet, among other things.
You\'ll have some nitrogen and inert gases there. The amount of oxygen
depends on how much is left over after oxidizing everything it can get
at. 

In an extreme case you can have enough oxygen to make the place a fire
hazard. But that requires starting with *lots* of water.

Pierre-Louis Constantin has developed what appears to be a very workable 
system.  I rolled up a few test characters using it, and found that it 
worked well.  One of its strong points is that it encourages more 
imagination on the part of the referee and player when generating a 
character.  Having to come up with Major and Minor Setbacks, as well as 
Special Duties, is a good spur to creativity.

When I was rolling up those characters, it made me be a bit less likely 
to go for "one more term" in the hopes of finally getting that last 
promotion.  If you stop getting promotions, the negative DM\'s start 
piling up and you realize you\'d better quit while you\'re ahead.  I like 
that. 

Pierre, in your write-up you mentioned that it wasn\'t complete.  If you 
ever get the chance, it\'d be great if you would write up the complete 
system and share it with us.

Thanks for posting it!

those following the thread regarding aliens:


Aliens and Linguistics: Language Study and Science Fiction.
By Walter E. Meyers (South Atlantic Modern Language
Association Award Study). 270p
1980.  ISBN 0 8203 0487 5

Sadly out of print but I obtained a copy through
Inter-Library Loan and found it riveting.  If you are
interested in languages *and* in SF it is brilliant.  It also
includes a lot of references to what SF books and stories
have used what kinds of language/linguistics.


(If anyone sees a copy in a local second-hand shop over there
in the US - I\'ll pay good money for it!)

I\'m no eco-scientist, but the first thing I thought of when I saw
this question was the carbon-cycle which tends to regulate temperature
on Earth. The general idea, and somebody with more schooling can feel
free to correct me if I get it wrong, is that carbon-dioxide plays a
huge role in determining how much heat your atmosphere retains. The more
CO2 is the air, the more heat is retained. The cycle works as follows:

1. CO2 is on the upswing, the atmosphere is heating up, which causes the
   weather system to accelerate, meaning more rain, which washes the
   CO2 back into the soil where it gets stuck for millions of years in
   the form of various carbonates, meaning that your planet cools off
   again.

2. CO2 is on the downswing, so the atmosphere cools down and the
   whether patterns slow down. Fortunately, since Earth is geologically
   active, some volcano erupts somewhere and spews out lots of CO2,
   and so the planet gets to heat up again.

Now, it gets a lot more complex than this, but for a thumbnail sketch,
this is my understanding of how Earth stays at roughly the same temperature
year after year. #2 is a constant pressure, and #1 is the opposite pressure
which due to the weather system tends to perfectly offset #2. The problem
with a water world, of course, is that #2, the constant pressure of
volcanos spewing millions of tons of CO2, is pretty much non-existant
as far as I can tell. I suppose they could be spewing CO2 from underwater,
and that it could rise to the surface in the form of bubbles, but I
wonder what percentage would be captured by the water on the way up, or
trapped under ice assuming the world went into an ice age? Another question
to consider: Without a freestanding soil, would the #1 effect, the washing
down of CO2 and trapping it various carbonates, be able to occur? If so,
as what rate as compared with a terranorm world?

Any chemists/environmentalists want to take a stab at this?

Earth\'s oceans are already our largest CO2 reservoir, holding far more 
than the atmosphere.  In fact, one of the big questions in greenhouse
warming is just how much more CO2 might dissolve in the oceans at 
equilibrium rather than stay in the atmosphere.  So, yes, underwater
volanoes would contribute to atmospheric CO2: their effect would just
be muted/slowed by the need for gas diffusion through the oceans.

Again, dissolved CO2 might have a similar effect on seafloor deposits 
(especially new and unoxidized minerals flung from the aforesaid volcanoes).
But the need for diffusion through the ocean again slows the process down:
the waterworld might be vulnerable to wide temperature swings before its
slower feedback process brings the climate back under control.

I don\'t have a modula-2 compiler, so I didn\'t speak up.  I\'d *really*
like to have a copy if you can translate the source into Pascal.

The albedo of the WaterWorld would be higher than Earth\'s, leading to a
reduced surface temperature, but water is a greenhouse gas leading to
increased surface temperature.  I wondered if one of these effects would
dominate so much that either a global ice age or a global sauna (or even a
runaway greenhouse) would develop.

Ice Caps: I read somewhere recently that if global warming occurs as
predicted the arctic ice cap of earth may become a seasonal feature.

Ya but if a starship has a particularly nasty name, "Relentless, etc."  
It makes the characters want to get away all that much more.  Plus, if 
keep having them run into "Relentless, whatever" it builds a mystique 
about that ship and it\'s captian.

HI Time to De-Lurk (Turn off Shadow Ship Cloaking Field)  (
shhhsshhshsskkkkk)

	To be honest, in Great Science Fiction books and Shows, StarShip 
names give an Air of completeness to the universe, All our present day 
Carriers, BattleShips, Cruises, Destroyers have names, as do most private 
craft.  For those of you who Watch Babylon 5, would it be as interesting as 
it is, with out this completeness?  Tink about some of the names, Hmm 
General Haig, commanded the Alexander (Double meaning for that ship, Named 
after Alexander the Great, And Alexander Haig?)  There is the Space Liner 
Asimov, and The deepspace Explorer Cortez.... All of these ships have 
special meaning behind thier names, and when you hear them mentioned in the 
Show, an image pops immediately to mind.  This is the same sort of Fullness 
naming your ships in the game can give to your roleplaying experience.  
Just think about it.  This is the making of a much richer game if you try 
to do little things like this.

Just My humble Opinion.

"Nobody\'s really sure anymore."

While its a nice honor to have a ship named after you most people do not 
have names that sound "heroic" enough or have a really good mythos 
involved with their creation.

Here\'s a couple of names I\'ve used in my campaign

Artemis
Dyonitia
Athena
Aries
Hecate
etc.

Any God\'s name, with a few possible exceptions makes a good ships name.  
If the people know what the god stood for they can generally work out the 
ships purpose.

Ishtar:  Is a good name, unfortunately some fool in Hollywood made a 
totally crappy movie with the same title, forever ruining the name for 
the rest of us.

Large Imperial Vessels I generally give formidable sounding names.  
Something that strikes fear in the heart of god generally works well.

Vengence
Formidable
Victorious
Relentless
Intrepid
Triumphant
etc.

Thou these make more Solomani sounding names they\'ve got that edge that 
makes players think that something is bound to go wrong.  Merchant ships 
are probably the easiest ships to name.  Just about any name will do.

Drop Dead Red
Void Runner
Astral Waters
Silent Explorer
Ted\'s Ship
etc.

I don\'t know maybe I put to much thought into it but runnig into the same 
ship several times tends to build a sence of comaradarie.

"You slide into port there\'s (roll roll roll) two subsidized merchants 
and a far trader in port"

"You slide into port there are three ships in port, a pair os subsidized 
merchants you\'ve never seen before and the "Mistress of the Dark."

You don\'t even have to tell the players what the "Mistress" is if they\'ve 
encountered it twice before they\'ll remember the ship and it\'s crew.

"Say that\'s Captian Rumm\'s ship isn\'t it?  200ton TL-15 far trader."

"Yep, the original puking dog."

I always keep around a list of the starships my players have encountered 
and when I\'m playing I always keep track of the starships I\'ve 
encountered, type, captian and notible features.

It adds a feeling of continuity to the game that\'s often hard to find.

Your answer really depends on your height.  Being a couple inches over six foot 
and more than 250 pounds of strapping manhood (oh lord, that sounds great), I 
find that I can wear a good-sized XL T-shirt, but the things are usually not 
long enough.  To get a decent length, I find myself getting a 2XL, or even a 
3XL as often as not.

Thanks for mentioning the shirts; I\'ll need to get one.

This is a good idea which I, too, have implemented: continuity of 
characters and objects.  Now, some may say, "Gee, what an amazing 
coincidence that we always seem to run into someone we know no matter 
where we go."  Or, as the local movie critic said of Independence Day, 
"It\'s just a little too coincidental that everyone in the movie meets 
everyone else, even though they are spread over two coasts and have 
disparate jobs.  The computer geek who can crack the alien\'s code just 
happens to have a wife who works for the President, who happens to..."  
[quoted from memory, not verbatim]

In my estimation, however, this sort of thing gives the story (be it a 
book, a movie, or a campaign) MORE believability and likeability.  Sure 
it can be overdone.  But in moderation, use of previously known people 
and objects in future adventures is a good idea.  I strive for a sense of 
familiarity in my campaigns.  Not only do the players enjoy it, but that 
makes the truly strange or unfamiliar seem even more so.

I would think that the name of the big navy ship would be very important
intelligence to the PCs.  

>From the deposition of Enli M\'Tavish in SuSAG, LIC v. Porodgram, LIC:

Q:  What happened next at Zircon?

A:  After we finished the job at the SuSAG installation on Zircon, we split
in the Slewfoot. On our way to jump point, SuSAG called the Imperial Navy
ship Revenger -- then orbiting Zircon Prime -- and identified us as wanted
criminals and spies.  

Q:  How did you know that?

A:  SuSAG used a radio, unscrambled.

Q:  Then what happened?

A:  Revenger swung out of orbit and hailed us.  When her sensors locked on
us, we jumped, even though we were risking misjump.  

Q:  Where did you jump?

A:  That jump took us to Gougeste ... 

[deletion]

A:  From Gougeste, we made Emerald, stopping in deep space at 0207/Jewell
midway.  

Q:  What did you do at Emerald?

A:  When we stepped out at Emerald and made contact with the starport, the
first thing we wanted to know was the identities of other ships that had
called there in the last two weeks.  Revenger hadn\'t been there, so we had a
little comfort that we weren\'t known yet.

YAY!  I hated that fact that the old TNE shirts never got any larger than
XL.  My wife is 5\'4" and under 120, and wears a XL (she likes them baggy).
 I am 6\'1", and more than I would care to admit.  I wear a XXL but prefer
a XXXL for length.  I say More power to IG for getting shirts out now.

You do get CO2 from underwater volcanos. It pretty much goes into
solution. *But*, the the concentration of CO2 in the water has to match
that of the atmosphere. This is actually shifted a bit by solubility,
but the basic idea hold. The CO2 content of surface water depends on
the amount in the air, and the temperature of the water. The CO2
content at depth depends on the temperature, and the content of any
adjacent water, modified by how fast CO2 diffuses. 

Given the lack of exposed rock, the carbonate formation would only
happen to exposed rock on the bottom. CO2 makes water acidic, so it
will react with basic rocks, resulting in carbonates. Also, calcium
carbonate is a favored structural material of some life forms, so they
will create it from the calcium dissolved in the water. 

The carbon cycle change more slowly, asnd thus be more capable of
taking large swings if some sudden change happens, but it should still
work out.

Remember that the main reason for the runaway greenhouse on Venus is
the *lack* of water. 

As I recall from discussions of Ice Ages, a water world is less likely
to do this. The reason we have so many is because of all the land in
the northern hemisphere. When the continents are more spread out, we
don\'t get ice ages.

There are two reasons for this. First, when water gets to 4C, it
reaches maximum density and sinks. That causes a circulation pattern
that moves surface waters north (and coriolis forces turn this eats or
west, depending on hemisphere), and deep waters move south. If you do
manage to freeze the surface water, it has to be in a land-locked area
like a lake or the Arctic Ocean. On a water world, you\'d have to get
most of the oceans *volume* to 4C before it could *start* to freeze.

And once the surface freezes, it insulates the deeper whater against
further heat loss. So as long as the equilibrium temp of the planet (as
determined by solar radiation) is above freezing, you\'ll have at least
some open whatever, barring so *really* weird occurences.

Andrew,

In a way, you are right that the rules are, in many ways, part and parcel 
of the Imperial setting.  For example, the oft-cited price fixing for 
cargo and passage rates.  

But, here\'s another look at the issue:

The Traveller set I first purchased was the Deluxe Starter Edition (two 
8-1/2 by 11" booklets, with Adventure 0, Introduction to Traveller, and 
the Spinward Marches map.  We hadn\'t used prepared adventures since the 
D&D days, so I didn\'t actually read Adventure 0 until about 10 years 
later (!).  I don\'t recall reading Intro to.., either.  So, we set about 
playing Traveller using only the core rules.  I made up planets as I went 
along.  There was no "Imperium."  
Then I bought Supplement 3, The Spinward Marches and that gave me data on 
the planets on my map.  But there still wasn\'t an Imperium.
It wasn\'t until a few years later that I had enough Supplements to piece 
together an idea of what the Imperium was like.  Gradually, our campaign 
environment came to resemble the official Traveller universe.

Now, did our play suffer from not using the Imperium?  No, it didn\'t.  As 
a matter of fact, we had other sci-fi games (notably Star Frontiers), and 
we preferred Traveller to Star Frontiers /even though we didn\'t know 
about the official Traveller setting/!  The rules, the clarity, the 
professionalism...these things made Traveller the superior product it was 
for us.

Now, obviously Marc Miller is going in the direction of giving Traveller 
distinct characteristics outside of the rules (ie, the discussion of 
symbols of the Imperium to be used to clearly indicate a given drawing is 
of a Traveller setting).  So, I think the official Traveller setting will 
be even stronger than before.  I think this is a good idea.

But I still hope the rules will be separate from the setting - even if 
only separated into sections of the same book.  That way, people will at 
least have the clear choice of making their own setting.

This is all moot now, though...we\'ll just have to see what the game looks 
like in a month!

Well....not always bad. :)  Depends on your intent.  I think the occasional 
ship named something like "Mr. Happy," "Pattycake," or "The Mortgage

One of the Norse sagas involved a ship called the Nameless.  During
construction, the Viking leader said something to the effect of "Why call a
ship Land Ravager when it is destined never to ravage land?  Let us call it
the Nameless and see what it does.  Then we shall give it a new name when it
has proven itself."

The Viking raid turns out to be a complete disaster, with the men getting
separated from their ship, dying of cold and disease instead of in battle,
and running across northern Europe with their tails between their legs.
Near the end of the book, the leader and a few survivors are running,
exhausted and hungry, from pursuers, and they reach the edge of a cliff
looking over the sea.  There below them, being dashed by the surf onto the
rocks, is the wreckage of the Nameless.  The leader says something like, "I
guess a ship lives up to its name, not the other way around."

I\'ve forgotten the name of the saga, having read it in translation when I
was in junior high about 25 years ago.

Ha! I\'d bet that Vilani generals would all be jockeying to be on the ship
named after the oldest hero in memory - the older, the better! An no self
respecting Vilani crewmember would dare step on board a ship without 
studying the history of the ship and it\'s name first.

ObTravJoke: What are the three most important items on a Vilani real 
estate agent\'s checklist?

Historical value, historical value, historical value!

You know I can see the Viking\'s doing this.  It\'s probably where the 
mystique, changing a ships name is bad luck, came from too.

See the ship knew it was going to have it\'s name changed.  A name is 
everything, it\'s not just a handy little rack to hang your hat on 
it\'s everything when it comes to personality development.

Interestingly enough, in one of the Star Trek novel, the author suggests that
Romulans feel the same way about names. The commander asks Kirk which great
Enterprise the ship is named for. When he replies that it isn\'t for any
specific enterprise, just the spirit, the commander is not surprised that
the ship gets into so much trouble. Call a ship Intrepid, and it will
forget how to fear (especially if you crew it with Vulcans), and get into
trouble.

With this in mind, I\'ve always been tempted to have ships pursuing PCs
called things like \'Relentless\' or \'Eternal Vigilance\'. Pirate ships get
names like \'Going Shopping\' or \'Bargain Hunter\', while PCs end up in
ships with names like \'Trouble, here we come\'.

Do recall that studies have shown that most people in the US are no
more than *5* acquaintances from anyone else. The average is more like
three or four.

In other words, I probably know someone, who knows someone, who knows a
friend of the president.

I\'m going to disagree with you, Andrew! <g>  

It\'s not the background, exactly.  It\'s not the rules, or how the
background and rules work together either.  It\'s the FEEL of the game.

Yeah, but how many of us have developed house rules for this, that,
and the other thing...like price fixing and passage rates.  I bet if
we add up all the house rules, you wouldn\'t recognize the *rules*, but
you would recognize the feel of the game.

Mine was the original Black Box with 3 little black books that never
mentioned anything about the Imperium..period.  No adventures!  No
map!  Totally "roll your own", so we did.

Having never owned either, I haven\'t either.  <g> Actually, I think
"Intro to.." was published in JTAS or Challenge, I think, so I might
have read it.

Right! Traveller could be anything you wanted...still can.

When I bought Supplement 3 I\'d never seen a map.  It provided a
*wonderful* playground that I could do with what I wanted.  I\'d
developed several star systems by then and just integrated them into
the Spinward Marches.  Those were the days my friend!

>But there still wasn\'t an Imperium. 

Actually, I started seeing it referred to in JTAS, and Book 5 (High
Guard) actually *assumed* some sort of remote centralized government.
I think they were calling it the Imperium even then.

>Traveller universe.

I guess mine did too, but we never got too close to the official
history.  Remember how we all felt when WAR! splashed across the JTAS
cover?  <g> It was very exciting, but my games never got involved in
the 5th Frontier War...and we skipped the rebellion, the civil war,
and the V\'thing in their entirety.

>Now, did our play suffer from not using the Imperium?  No, it didn\'t.
 
Absolutely not!  

I *loved* the Traveller News, went there first in every issue of JTAS
and Challenge, but all that was happening in a different universe.  A
similar universe, with similar technologies and star systems, but
still a different one.

>The rules, the clarity, the  professionalism...these things made
>Traveller the superior product it was  for us.

You got that right!  I just turned and look up at my bookshelf saw
GURPS, Aftermath, Space Opera, SpaceMaster, Star Trek and
StarFrontiers all sitting there..along with CT, MT, TNE, TW2K, and
2300AD.  <G> (The rest of my stuff is in another room) They are all
grist for the mill!  

Only Traveller keeps rising to the top.

I do to.  I keep going back to TNE, looking at the rules, and dang it!
There are some really good ideas in there.  It\'s just so *hard* to
find them among all the setting stuff.  

Give me the rules!  I\'ll come up with the setting!  Ok, you can give
me the setting too..just make it easy to separate the two.  <g>

If you can get ahold of it, try Cachalot by Alan Dean Foster (my favorite

something dark and mysterious in the deep, et al.  I can\'t seem to remember if

Yeah. "I don\'t know what it is, but I know it when I see it." :)  Being 
unable to put ones finger on what is so great about something you like is 
a rather embarassing situation to be in, but I agree with you.

I didn\'t own the 3 little black books until just a few years ago.  In 
going back and collecting all the CT stuff I missed, I\'ve found it best 
to divide my collection into three sub-collections: one collection of those 
things that I want to preserve, which are never touched (I know, how 
anal!  But I live in fear of someday being without an original copy of 
the Traveller rules, thus the redundancy and care); a collection of things 
that I have only one copy of but which I will go ahead and use (ie, 
Group One items, etc.); and a third collection of items which are used 
without overmuch concern for their condition (essentially, multiple 
copies of the stuff in the first collection, which just happens to 
comprise what I see as the core rules (books 1-8, Supplements 1-13, and 
The Traveller Book)).  
Anyway, the point of saying all that was to show that I use books 1-3 about 
equally as often as The Traveller Book.  Depends on what mood I\'m in, 
strangely enough.

Hmmm.  I don\'t remember it from JTAS.  Might have been Challenge.  Now 
that I\'ve read it, it /is/ a nice piece of work.  I just didn\'t seem to 
need it back when we first started playing.


> Right! Traveller could be anything you wanted...still can.

Yeah.  That\'s just it.  I never had trouble coming up with scenarios for 
Traveller, while in other games I either got into a rut or simply got 
bored and stopped playing.  With thousands of worlds, many alien races 
(some detailed, some less detailed, and still others not even mentioned 
- -- and thus open for your creation!), any tech level you can imagine, and 
everything else available to you, there really is no end to the adventure 
possible with Traveller.  No matter what the size of your Traveller 
collection. :)

:)  Yes, indeed.

I\'m sorry, I should have been more specific. I meant, "There still wasn\'t 
an Imperium in my campaign."  I knew of the Imperium by that time, of 
course.  I just didn\'t know enough about it, and I didn\'t really have 
much interest in changing my already-working setting, at that time.

We did something similar to that.  We played in the Rebellion when MT came 
out...until we decided the setting, while undeniably exciting for many 
people, wasn\'t for us.  So we went back to CT, and the universe that had 
grown up around our characters through the years.  

Like yours, ours wasn\'t a truly canonical version of the CT universe.  The 
Imperium was almost completely uncaring.  It was an entity capable of 
producing overwhelming force whenever it felt like it...which was usually 
in wars that most of the population felt were unecessary and petty; the 
result of the Imperial nobility\'s hubris.  

Speaking of the nobility, Strephon and the rest of the nobility were off 
in the background somewhere, feasting and piddling their lives away when 
not involved in something horrendously wasteful like war.  So, they really 
didn\'t enter into the picture. More important to the characters were the 
local governments, the overpowering MegaCorps, the super-rich/powerful, 
pirates, and organized criminals.  

Or, in our less-ambitious campaigns, the most important things all 
happened on one planet, and concerned ordinary people affected by their 
neighbors and rivals.

Oh!  This reminds me of a question I wanted to ask of those who refereed 
more than one campaign (I know some of the folks have run the same 
campaign since the beginning):  How much continuity, if any, was there 
between your campaigns?  Did previous characters\' exploits affect 
subsequent adventures?  Were previous characters even known about in 
subsequent campaigns?

Right on.  I read the Traveller News ("Yet another Imperium-wide benefit 
of membership in the Travellers\' Aid Society") to the players each time 
I received my new issue.  It was an on-going story we all followed, but 
only rarely did any of those events happen in my universe.

I\'m all for a strong setting with tons and tons of background information 
detailed to the last chromosome of each Alien.  Just, please, make it all 
separate from the game mechanics.

  That should be fine. If the code isn\'t understandable, I am happy to
interpret too. Have a look at it before deciding to port it though, as it 
does contain a fair bit of Amiga specific stuff.

  I have made the source and executable available separately from my web site

You should find the two files there. Unfortunately there are no docs for the 
program - it is one of those things which I was going to do, but never got
done. I will see what I can do in copious amounts fo spare time! :-)

Wasn\'t / Isn\'t Aslan the name of a lion in some novel?  I thought 
that was written in Canon somewhere (probably in a Digest Magazine).

The only novels I know of with a lion named Aslan are the Chronicles of 
Narnia series by C.S. Lewis (which, incidentally, were the first novels I 
read all the way through of my own accord, and which were a big reason I 
learned to enjoy reading as much as I do!  After them I read C.S. Lewis\' 
sci-fi trilogy, from whose main character I get my handle.  From that 
point onward, I\'ve read mainly those two genres (sci fi and fantasy), 
which lead me to role-playing games.  So, it can be said, if it wasn\'t 
for C.S. Lewis I might be a very different person...and I wouldn\'t be 
here annoying you with chatter that is tenuously related, at best, to the 
subject at hand! :)  ).

As I understand it, yes.  Early Traveller had a number of jokes of
this sort inserted in.  As I recall, the official line was that the
Aslan were named by the early Solomani explorers who were the "first"
to contact one of the Aslan starfaring clans.  The meaning of the
name "Aslan" is lost in obscurity as far as Imperial citizens are
concerned.  :)  

There are other examples of such things in old Bestiary articles.  
For instance, there\'s an animal called a "bloodvark" that looks
like a cross between a bloodhound, aardvark, and canister vaccuum
cleaner, and is trained to find fugitives on many worlds.  On some
of them it is called a "hoover", but nobody knows why....  (Hoover
being a well-known vaccuum cleaner brand in the US.)  This was in
one of the old JTAS issues.  There\'s probably other examples, too.

The idea seems to have been to have subtle, plausible jokes for the
20th century players that the 57th century characters wouldn\'t get.
(Both the Hoover Vaccuum Cleaner Co. and Narnia books could easily 
survive into the Terran Confederation era, for instance.)

  Joe Walsh asked some leading questions over on TML which
quickly lead to a thread that rapidly diverged. I\'d like
to bring this back to the quiet civility of XBOAT and the
original point.

Joe Walsh asks a number of questions about hand computers:
Physical:
>Are they notebook-sized?

User Interfaces:
>you do something similar to flipping a page to get it to 
>display the next page?  Or do you say, "flip page?"  
>Would you say the display is very much like ink-and-paper
>in the way it looks, or is it more like a LCD?  

External Interfaces:
>Can they download information from afar, or do they need
>a physical link to the computer being accessed? If the former,
>can they be used as communicators?  Can you link them together
>into a temporary network, allowing every user to see what is
>on some sort of shared display, which they can all interact
>with?  What sort of range do they have?

  Physical was interestingly discussed on TML, mainly around
the (wierd) ideas of flexible computers. What I\'d like to
expound upon is ideas around the user interface.

  Lets try to get away from the "box with buttons" idea. There
are better ways but lets, for the moment, think of our "hand
computer" as a pair of glasses. They sit on the bridge of
your nose not merely correcting vision but giving you the equivalent
of a "heads up display". This can be adjusted from completely
transparent to opaque depending on user preference and activity
(eg sitting at a campfire or driving a air/raft).
  Now, go further. Most conventional HUDs are static. Ie. they
project what they project independant of the attitude of the
head. However why not tie it into where your head is pointing?
(There are several ways to do this I won\'t bore you with.) So
when you look right, you see more screen. Same for up, down,
etc. The size of your virtual HUD grows further.
  Even more so, the corelation between head movement and screen
scrolling doesn\'t have to stop there. Just as a small movement
with a mouse produced a large movement across a computer screen,
moving your head 20 degrees to the right might rotate your
virtual display 40, 60 or 80 degrees, depending on sensativity
settings. (Cherryh\'s battledress works like this.) Thus your
virtual bubble world ends up being a sphere bigger than 360
degrees around (the maths gets a bit wierd, but there _are_
equations).
  With me so far? Next step.
  As the computer is sitting on your face, it has a pretty good
view of your eyes. It can tell exactly where you are looking.
If it wants to display a mouse-like cursor on the screen it can
put it just where you look (gee, I _really_ wish mine did that).
Not only that but since the angle of your eyes is slightly
different depending on how "deep" you are looking than it can
also not only detect direction but depth as well. Thus you have
a 3D "mouse".
  A lot of human non-verbal communication is done through facial
expression. We have quite developed muscles there for a wide
variety of nuances. Your Fabulous Facial Friend ("hand" computer)
can pick up on these. As simple as using different squints to
"right or left click the mouse" up to rather more complicated UI
interactions our immersion in present technology prevents us from
even guessing.
  And for my finale...
  I\'m an old keyboard jock. Mice are grand but try typing in this
article with one. Even with "Expression Entry" I still anticipate
the utility of keyboard-ish manual entry. After all, no matter how
versitile our faces are, our hands are more so.
  So far we have just looked at our "Eye Computers" looking in.
Well there is no reason they can\'t look out just as effectively.
They should be able to determine the exact attitude and placement
of your hands as effectively as your pupils. Say then that in your
virtual HUD a "keyboard" is displayed along with analoges of
your hands. You can then easily "type". (Wasn\'t there a scene like
this in Jonny Mnemonic?)
  Not only that but the keyboard is infinately versitile. You can
add keys, split the keyboard in ergonomic ways, and add bits all
over your virtual environment.
  Similarly the ear-rests can catch the vibrations of your skull
as you sub-vocalise and interpret that as further input for those
even too lazy to use the virtual keyboard...


  So lets wrap up with a bit of colour (and leave external interfaces
for another day)...

  Sid Viscous walks back from the customs house to his ship. He
stops in a park to check out the forms he\'s uploaded. He unfolds
his "hand" computer and places it on his nose. He closes his eyes
briefly and slowly opens them, activating the display to full
opacity. A number of textured portals litter his viewing area.
With a gesture he sweeps them off to his "sides". "Search by
recent", he mutters and a list of the more recently modified
data appears. Glancing and clicking he brings up the recently
uploaded customs lists.
  Grabbing one of the forms he drags it larger and a 3D display
starts explaining the form and its uses. Sid, however, has seen
this many times and, a few blinks later has axed the 3D playback
and is left with the textual representation of the regulations.
As his eyes scan down the document it scrolls more into view.
With various lip gestures he marks places of interest in the
hyper-texed fine print.
  With another eye-gesture he minimises the display and presses
a special "function button" that brings up his ship\'s manifest.
Eye flicking through this he eye-circles sections, and eye-drags
them to bits around on the desktop.
  When he is done with this he re-activates the form and drops
the info into requisite spots. One, however, red-lights, requesting
additional clarification on the containers he has entered as
"footware". He knows the Yasidians have an ankle taboo and that
the sandals he is importing are rather risque\' but local standards
and subject to strict government controls he had hoped to avoid.
  He ponders how he is to fill in this particular section as
a wrong answer could be costly and endanger his lisence. After some
time he is suddenly surrounded by large portable densiometers
soaring on vast pennons through the waif like atmosphere of a
gas giant. His "screen saver" has activated.
  Pulling himself together he dismisses the densiometers (which
flap bashfully behind activated panels) and start calling up
local dictionary translators. They have no real on-line services
outside of customs so he has to rely on data uploaded from there.
He drags screens around and flicks his eyes over definitions trying
to find one that adequately describes his cargo yet doesn\'t trigger
any legal warnings.
  His workspace quickly becomes cluttered and expands from 90
degrees to 180 and up to 270. He ties in several repeated actions
to facial macros and tries to organise his data.
  Suddenly the whole workspace shudders and he feels a heavy
pressure on his shoulder. Closing his eyes and rapidly opening
them set ths computer back to transparent mode. He blinks
repeatedly at an old gentleman poking him with a stick.
  "Are you all right there son? Thought you were having a bit
of a fit. You have to watch the UV around here. Good day, so."
The old mans wanders off in one direction and Sid goes in the
other. There is a Traveller\'s Aid Society around here somewhere.
They might have better dictionaries or old-hands who know the
ropes...

Hi, I just signed on to the XBoat so I missed the earlier comments on Campaign
Cartographer.

I have a copy of CC ($70, version 1.2 by ProFantasy Software, London; an earlier
version?). My package runs under DOS and included everything needed. The only
other module I\'ve seen was to add additional fonts.

I bought CC for drawing maps, but it included a starship template with standard
Traveller symbols for hatches, etc. You can also design your own symbols. CC is
a very flexible CAD program that lets you draw in color on multiple layers, edit
drawn shapes, do fills, etc. I\'ve used other CAD programs and CC compares very
well, especially for drawing maps (rivers, coastlines, ...). A step-by-step
tutorial is included. There are several export formats including Windows bitmap,
BMP (no GIF or JPG).

I have very limited experience with using CC for deck plans; I\'ll let you know

Many years ago, I read a science-fantasy book called Solo Kill. The story took 
place on an alien world populated by several intelligent species, one of which 
was a technology-oriented amphibian river-dweller. It had invented numerous 
gadgets, such as the gas-powered engine and the aircraft, but not gunpowder. It 
used compressed air for its fire-arms, mainly rather unwieldy machine-guns (the 
most advanced smallarm was the crossbow). Another species operated at night and 
preferred silent weapons. Their glider plans were equipped by some sort of 
flechette-style bombs that were deadly against their unamoured opponents.

There *are* limits to this. You see, vision *requires* constant
movements of the eyes. If your eyes don\'t move you can\'t see anything.
So a visual "mouse" has a *lot* of "jitter".

Check out the entry system severely handicapped people like Stephen
Hawking use (there was an artical about it in byte about 10 years back.
It uses a set of icons and as you select them they change. They\'re
organized such that it takes *very* few icon choices to get to a word
or phrase. That\'s how Hawking, using something *considerably* less
useful that a mouse can speak in almost real time. Anything that fast
can be made faster with the sort of display you are talking about.
Especially since you\'ll start "memorizing" the movements required to
get common words and phrases, just like a typist can think "the" and
have his fingers hit the proper keys in the proper sequence.

Actually, the standard keyboard is *way* sub-optimal. And I\'m not
talking about things like the Dvorak keyboard. Check out what the call
"chording" keyboards. You have a key or two for each finger and
generate characters by using combinations of the keys. They don\'t take
much longer to learn, and they are *faster* once you learn. They can
also be set up to avoid carpal tunnel and the like.

The *most* common chording keyboard is the one used on "braillers".
These are intended to let the blind take notes, and they have six
buttons arranged like the dots of a braille character. There are a
couple of other controls, but I forget what they are. 

You just enter braille direct. You\'d think that there are just 64
possible characters. That\'s only partially true. The "braille alphabet"
you see in encyclopedias is what\'s known as "level 1 braille". Level 2
uses some otherwise unused level 1 characters to modify the meanings of
level 1 chars, giving things like multi character groupings or short
common words. Level 3 braille uses 2 and 3 character sequences to
represent entire words and phrases. 

Or consider the keyboards used by court stenographers. They have only
10 or 12 keys, yet they can transcibe damn near anything (it\'s called
"machine shorthand").

Given the above, there\'s no need to bother displaying a keyboard.
Select "text input" and then just flex your fingers in the right
patterns. You don\'t even have to flex them all that much, just enough
for the sensors in your glove (or attached to your wristband) to pick
up. 

> With various lip gestures he marks places of interest in the

With hyper-text storage and any sort of decent search program (using
even contemporary levels of "AI"), "fine print" becomes a meningless
concept. Instead, if someone is trying to be tricky, they\'ll have to do
it via setting up interrelationships between widely seperated
regulations. But slipping that past any sort of computer analysis
requires that you use a computer & software that are better than the
people you are trying to trick have. And the GCLU (Galactic Civil
Liberties Union) has some *good* people trying to find such things.

Yes, hypertext and computer aided searches may actually bring about the
return of the days when you could *understand* the laws affecting you!

> This is because originally the keyboard was set up to slow down the speed 
of the typist.  The first keyboard developed, back in the 1800\'s, was an 
extremely fast keyboard the problem was if you typed at maximum speed the 
striker type arms all got jammed up at the type place, who can remember 
this?  So someone came along and redesigned the keyboard to make it more 
difficult to type on, ie putting letters that ususally came together in 
places where they required more effort to reach.  This stopped the arms 
from jamming up and made typing faster.

Hm. I\'d argue that Brass->Iron is more of a leap than Iron->Bonded Superdense,
but I\'m not sure how.

Probably lots. if there\'s one thing that human have gotten better at over
the centuries (millenia!) it\'s keeping records. We know as much as we
do about Ancient Mesopotamia because they kept such good records on clay
tablets and such. Modern people produce such vast amounts of information
about themselves that we\'ll probably go down as the greatest narcicists (sp?)
in history... Oh wait you said _average_ citizen. Probably nothing.
The average modern person is lucky if they can place Sri Lanka on a map.
It will be possible for an average university-graduate type to know 
a lot about the 20th century, but it probably won\'t be common.

Some figures will remain on the tips of everyone\'s tongue. Some names will
be forever lost. Name 3 Egyptian Pharoahs. Now, which one had his
burial crypt found intact, which one is a major brand of condoms and
you must have stayed awake in history to remember a third name. Now,
who built the Great Pyramid?  That\'s tougher, but you could do it.
Which pharoah imposed the greatest tax burder on his people? I doubt
anyone will get that one (without making it up or having a PhD).
(Note my use of the Egyptian metaphor as I don\'t know a thing about
Mesopotamia! Case in point.)

The average 58th century native Terran will probably know that John F.
Kennedy was an American president, but it\'ll be doubtful if they know
anything more than that he was shot. (Though by then, they may have
figured out by whom...)
 
> Comments (and PhD titles :-)) please.

I think that Terra would be unusual in that after the Rule of Man,
almost every human occupied planet in known space would have access
toa fairly complete Terran history. Vland and Terra would be the two
best known planets in all of space, perhaps even overshadowing
local historical stuff.

The Solomani aliens book by GDW had very little about Terra at the time of the 
Third Imperium.  The Solomani & Aslan book by DGP had some more, but one of the 
best sources of Terra info wound up being the Invasion:Earth board game by 
GDW.  This game was a simulation of the invasion of Terra at the end of the 
Solomani Rim War in 990.  In addition, I believe there was a DGP adventure 
(from the Megatraveller Journal?) set on Terra.

One of these books specifically mentioned the New York was still around, 
preserved under a dome.  Apparently, Washington DC also survived, as the 
Smithsonian was mentioned in one of the two Solomani courcebooks in passing.  
The ruins of ancient Egypt were also still around; the adventure was actually 
set in that area, IIRC.  The GDW Solomani sourcebook had an adventure which 
gave some info about Terran history, regarding the restoration of an Indonesian 
(?) royal family that was exiled after some sort of global vote around the time 
of the 1st Interstellar war.

From Invasion Earth we get some overall details.  There were three major 
starports;one each in Australia, North America and North Africa.  The one in 
North Amreica, Starport Phoenix (located near present-day Phoenix, Arizona) was 
renamed Paolo by the Imperium during the occupation, as it had too many 
connotations with the Solomani Phoenix Project (an intended anti-Imperial 
guerilla campaign).  The starport in Africa was called AECO Downport.  I recall 
reading somewhere that AECO stood for Africa-European Cooperative Organization, 
which would imply some sort of political or mercantile union between Europe and 
Africa.   

This game also gave us some indication about the big cities; really these were 
big megacities.  Not surprisingly, western Europe, the East and West coast of 
North America and Japan were all shown as vast city complexes extending for 
several hundred miles.  In addition, there were large blobs of megacity 
scattered in central China, Australia and Central America (Mexico City, I 
imagine).  I seem to recall that Africa was relatively clear of city blobs in 
the middle, but there were some in North Africa and in southern Africa.

In addition, there were some global changes.  The Mediterranen was larger, and 
the coasts of Northern Europe and the Americas were slightly changed; it looked 
as though the average sea level had increased.  This might imply some global 
warming and melting of icecaps, but I don\'t recall any specific statement.

I think the Terran of the 57th century would know far more about us today than 
we know about ancient Mesopotamia.  Unless there is some total breakdown of all 
Terran civilization (not just a drop back to TL9 in the Long Night) many 
records of nearly all facets of life will still be around centuries from now.  
Even if such a collapse were to happen, the sheer bulk of these records makes 
it much more likely to have a significant portion to survive.  Of course, this 
will still be the purview of scholars rather than the "average joe," but even 
the average guy will learn something in school.

The way I see it, our ability to store information has increased 
dramatically from the distant past you mention to today.  That is, in our 
distant past there wasn\'t a whole lot of information stored in the first 
place, so of course not a whole lot of that still exists today.  On the 
other hand, we store so much of our information today that even in the 
distant future (barring disasters too horrible to imagine) they will 
still have a great deal of our accumulated knowledge.

That\'s my take on it, anyway.

Sure!  Unless the batteries all went dead during the "long night."  Or
the Virus gets...ooops wrong echo!  <g>

Seriously, I do agree with you though.  Technology on planets like
Earth wouldn\'t fall far enough to loose access to their knowledge
base...and that raises the question:  Why did the "long night" last
over a thousand years?

OTOH, I\'d be just as happy to drop rocks on all the major planets and
let everybody restart from scratch....ooops rocks again!  <g>

Me!  Me!  I learned to type on a manual typewriter, complete with
striker arms. 

Derek\'s right about the keyboard layout.  The typewriter was invented
in 1871, and every manufacturer had his own layout, each better and
faster than everybody else.  The problem was the men (women weren\'t
allowed to type...their fingers were considered too delicate <g>) kept
jamming the keys.  In 1878, I think it was, a committee decided on a
standard keyboard layout..that we call QWERTY..that every manufacturer
*could* use.  The QWERTY layout was designed to slow typists down and
particularly move certain key combos to locations requiring a reach.

Today with electronic typewriters/keyboards we don\'t need the QWERTY
layout, but it\'s unlikely to go away.  Typing teachers know QWERTY, so
they teach QWERTY, and their students become the typing teachers who
teach what they learned...QWERTY. <G>

Dr Dvorak developed a much better layout in the early 1930\'s.  His
layout was tested against QWERTY:  2 typists typed the same documents
during an 8 hour day with movie cameras recording their finger
movements, the distance their fingers moved during the the 8 hours of
typing were measured.  The QWERTY typist\'s fingers moved more than 3
miles, while the Dvorak\'s typist\'s fingers moved around 1/2 mile.

Curved barrels are decidely non-optimal for any kind of projectile
propelled by a push. They\'d be hard to aim, and the wear on the outside
of the curve would be extreme. They\'d also have a tendency to blow up.

Missile weapons progress through several somewhat parallel sequences,
and gun powder comes in fairly late.

I can\'t think of any missile weapons that don\'t fit one of these
categories (except maybe the boomerang).

I can\'t really see torsion/tension weapons going much farther than they
did. Ditto for pressure and rocket. You run into materials limits
pretty fast. 

On the other hand, there *are* some possibilities with centrifugal
force. Take the old "turbine" that Heron invented in ancient Greece. It
never got used for anything. But imagine someone noticing the way that
anything "loose" near the ends of the nozzles flys off pretty hard.

With a some work, you could come up with a gizmo that dropped stones
from a hopper into "boxes" one the side of the "turbine". Remember, it
spun about a *horizontal* axis. Sort of like a miniature waterwheel
attached to the same shaft.

It wouldn\'t be very effective, but it\'d be enough to make people keep
tinkering with it. Eventually, you\'d wind up with a *nasty* little
weapon. A steam turbine coupled to a set of appropriately curved
compartments that get fed balls at one point and eject them down a
barrel after say half a revolution or so. Look up the rpm of even an
19th century steam turbine, and figure out what sort of velocity we are
talking about with only a meter radius.

It might even be possible to design one around a compact gas turbine,
in which case you\'d have a rifle like weapon with the soldier packing
around a small fuel tank (propane?) and having this weird circular
bulge near the stock of the weapon, and an exhaust port somewhere
spitting out hot gases.

In case you didn\'t notice I\'m not talking about anything as primitive as
a glove either. One optical sensor should do the trick.

  Oh, ho, ho, ho! Not a chance. "Fine print" just takes on a new meaning.
Take airline reservation systems. Once they were computerised everyone
thought that we now were going to have fair and equal chances for any
airline to get tickets. Then some airlines started changing their departure
times by a few minutes in different directions so that the search software
put them on the top of the list for commonly used search engines.

  Laws will always complexify themselves to the point where you need
professionals to interpret them. Ever since good old Hamurabi carved
that stele there have been lawyers. There always will be.
  Hypertext contains no magical solution. If you make it long enough and
with enough cross references you will need a professional to interpret.
It is just that it allows you to express much more complicated laws than
cuneiform.

  So, guys, instead of discussing 20th century technology just assume the
future deals with this stuff. Get back to the original gimick and lets hear
some plot ideas...

This is an awfully good point!  One of the things that I didn\'t like about
the New Era is that they seemed to forget about this: 20th century
references abounded, and for no real reason.

Just the sheer volume of history (even assuming that it was all preserved)
and historical data will overwhelm someone who was trying to research it.
Naming US Presidents would be a lot like naming Egyptian or Chinese rulers.

A reference to "Aslan" would be as obscure in the Far Future as a reference
to "Ninkasi" is today (would you drink from an unmarked, opaque container
labelled "Ninkasi"?).

Exactly.
"Yah, database archaeology.  Did you know that for most of the 20th century,
 they didn\'t have full-text searching?"
"No way, get outta here, man!  How did they ever find things?"
"Aparrently they didn\'t.  I\'m doing a paper on their early space travel, and

 I can\'t find any refernece to it in contemporary military histories."

And they\'ll probably remember Washington and Lincoln (but I\'ll bet a lot of
people will confuse Kennedy and Lincoln - after all, they were both "the one
that got shot").

Unless someone is _really_ interested in it, the most detail that
anyone will ever go into would probably be like Larry Gonick\'s (excellent)
_A Cartoon History of the Universe_.  There\'s just too much information for
anyone to be more than casually aware of it.

Planets like Earth didn\'t loose their knowledge base - Earth was the core of
the Old Earth Union, a space-faring trading group that lasted through the
Long Night.  It\'s the other, less-optimal worlds that didn\'t fare so well.

Remember, the Long Night was triggered by a currency collapse: interstellar
banks started to refuse to honor notes and drafts on "far away" branches.
It doesn\'t take much of this for trade to become a local (or even
non-existant) thing.  Once trade collapsed, only worlds with a friendly
ecosystem and a population that could be locally supported remained.  These
worlds are fairly few and far between.

The end result being that there was no _point_ to going off-world; many
economies suffered a long depression or stagnation even on the best worlds.
Add to that a number of groups with working starships that decided that the
best way to deal with the financial problems was to take what they wanted
from those less-well-armed, compound it with Fear, Uncertanty, and Doubt,
and pretty soon nobody goes trading anymore.

This jogged a memory loose. I\'ve seen plans for something very similar
to this in a 1940s vintage _Popular Mechanics_ or _Popular Science_.
The gizmo used an electric motor to spin a tube around it\'s centerpoint.
Each end of the tube was curved into something like a Jai Alai racket
shape. A hopper fed BBs into the hub of the tube, centrifugal force
spun the BBs out through the tubes. There was some sort of interruptor
mechanism to ensure the BBs would release from one point.

The photo showed a happy home handyman playing with his electric indoor
BB machinegun, punching holes in paper targets in the comfort of his
den. The whole mechanism was pretty small, and there were some cautions
on building one bigger, with a faster motor, etc., because this could 
scale into a nasty little device pretty easily.

Our ability to store information for short periods of time has increased
by leaps and bounds over the past ten years but noone is thinking of long
term storage. The lifespan of information on magnetic tape is less than 20
years and on optical disk it probably less than 100 years. This is without
regard to data layout and character set encoding which brings up a whole
other set of issues. So even if a CD-ROM would last until 5700~5800 AD it
would be difficult to decipher without a contemporary ASCII table and
printed copy of the CD-ROM data layout books as rosetta stones so to
speak. I think it\'s foolish to assume that we will employ a significant
portion of the earth\'s workforce in the endevour of constantly converting
databases which are meaningless out of context from "obsolete" formats to
"modern" formats every twenty years or so. 

What this means is that _some_ historical data will be saved. A list of
American presidents provided that when we get around to creating one-world
government it\'s not the Japanese that end up with the most influence 8-). 
Land records and trades will be meticulously maintained for as long as we
can buy and sell land. There\'s probably a tonne of stuff that\'s I\'m
missing but the point is that it\'s foolish to think that it will be
possible to look up a twentieth century individual\'s credit rating and
local buying habits more than 20 years after his death even though that
information is meticulously collected, stored and maintained now. Also, 
forget this information storage if there\'s a short war to interrupt this 
"golden age" of information in which we live. Computers and information 
have become so important that they will certainly be first line targets 
in the next war.

     Probably because the books said so...;-)  Actually, the term \'Long 
Night\' is mostly  Cleon-ist propoganda, and refers mostly to the lack 
of a centralized Government, most places did not fall into barbarism.

     But, here\'s an idea...The long night was mostly an economic 
phenomenon, brought about by two major factors...the long supression 
of technology by the Vilani, and the over heated, over rapid 
expansion of the Rule of Man.

      The former guaranteed that the majority of worlds were dependent
upon imports from select high tech planets for a large amount of
their infrastructure.  This is well in line with the conservative,
monopolistic practices of the Vilani. Thus very few worlds had the
ability to maintain their current tech level (meaning interstellar
travel), and since knowledge was so supressed by the Vilani, even
the ability to recreate the tech was not there.  These planets would
have had to go through the equivalent of the Renaissance, the
Enlightenment, and the Industrial age, all over again to get back to
where they were.

     The Terran rule probably made things worse.  The rapid expansion 
probably stretched and broke what infrastructure was there..again, 
leading to significant dependence on technological imports.

     When the economy collapsed, everyone drew back to smaller and 
smaller spheres of influence. Star travel never died out, but trade 
was economically unviable in many areas. These areas were never quite 
lost as much as ignored.

     With economic collapse, as surely as summer follows spring, comes 
warfare...fighting between the remaining starfaring groups probably 
destroyed even more of the advanced technological base.

     This could well have led to a rather isolationist viewpoint on many 
many of the worlds involved, again supressing interstellar trade 
and travel.

     With the combination of a lack of technical resources, the lack of 
knowledge, and isolationist policies, it\'s not hard to figure that 
the Long Night would fall.

     Why did this state persist for a thousand years? I dunno...I\'d be 
more likely to think of it in terms of a few hundred, unless by sheer 
fortuitous luck, no one in the entire known universe with the drive, 
and resources of Cleon I existed until he did.

Good question.  I dunno.

Oop.  That won\'t make for a good post, now will it? :)

Lemme see...perhaps, just prior to the long night, all knowledge stores 
had been transferred to some storage medium that was inaccessable when 
tech levels dropped.  No books, just high-tech storage that relied on 
technology prone to failure and which no one could repair any longer.

Yup, that\'d require a bit o\' handwaving, but that\'s all I can come up 
with right now. :)

It depends on what the information is.  A business that coverts to a new 
storage format will transfer all of its current customer database into 
the new format.  Non-current customers\' data will probably not be 
transferred.  So, over the long term, you are correct: none of this 
information is likely to be available very long after the customer\'s 
death. 

But, really, I wasn\'t referring to such "knowledge" at all.  Loosely 
stated, I am referring to the type of information one could find in a 
library.  

Will this sort of information be converted?  I think you\'ll grant that 
the "core" stuff (meaning, the stuff that is most often accessed) will 
be.  There will also be items which, although not frequently used, will 
be determined to have historical importance (that importance, of course, 
being determined in the then-current context, which will undoubtedly 
exclude some items that would be considered VERY relevant 200 or 2000 
years from then) and will therefore also be converted - perhaps by 
privately funded organizations, or even by business-sponsored 
conversion.  

The rest?  Sure, it may fall by the wayside.  It may not be converted, 
and will eventually deteriorate beyond usability.

Nonetheless, the point of my post was that we have HUGE stores of 
knowledge (again, referring to library-type knowledge) in comparison to 
even 200 years ago.  Not only do we have a lot more knowledge stored, we 
also have more copies of that knowledge - and those copies are scattered 
all over, under the care of many different people and organizations.

So, even if we assume that 90% of our knowledge will be wiped out due to 
lack of conversion to subsequent storage methods (something I consider 
highly unlikely, but for the sake of argument I stipulate it), the 
remaining stores will still dwarf what we have of the knowledge base from 
3000 years ago.

That\'s what I figure finally broke the whole thing down.  A
*dependent* world with a starship or two tries to take what it needs
from a higher tech world, and everybody ends up with broken equipment
and a lot poorer.  If this kind of think happened over and over, you
would grind down the remaining infrastructure leaving very little to
rebuild with.

This probably wouldn\'t happen on the *home* worlds, like Terra &
Vilin, for instance, but their sphere\'s of influence might contract to
a very small area.  

What I don\'t quite get is the loss of tech levels on planets like
Vilin or Terra, so that the expanding 3rd Imperium have Jump 2 or 3
and Tplate tech and the old centers of power don\'t!  The only thing I
can think of is they *really* were wreaked by war sometime during the
dark age.

...or several thousand!  If it was mainly economic, then a few
hundred.  If *massive* wars spread across the whole area taking out
virutally *all* areas of high tech, AND continued happening until
everybody was knocked down so low they couldn\'t get at each other,
then several thousand to rebuild and come back.  

One other thing I thought about is that maybe there\'s some material or
element needed for Jump and maybe TPlate tech that is missing in
almost every system.  So even if System A retained the *knowledge*
they might not have the material, and System B might had the material,
but no longer had the knowledge.

Over the centuries, maybe several seperate cultures would emerge at
about the same time..not unreasonable if they are all starting from
about the same level..and killed each other off.  This might have
happened over and over, until one *didn\'t* get killed off, and we call
that last one the 3rd Imperium.

Sounds right to me, too.  War goes hand-in-hand with economic collapse.  
In some areas, it would be horrific levels.  In others, it would amount 
to hit-and-run/smash-and-grab type actions.  But it would be everywhere 
it would be possible for one needy world to reach another world.

Again, I agree, IF those worlds remained powerful enough to ensure 
economic stability for surrounding worlds.

Could be. If they retained anything worth having, and if someone else had 
some firepower and wanted that stuff, then devastating war would be a 
possibility.

I agree.  But, goodness, didn\'t even ONE world survive relatively 
intact?

Another good thought.  It could very well have happened that way.  Plus, 
it makes for good reading, should someone want to write the history of 
the Long Night. :)

The standard QWERTY layout was NOT designed to slow down typing, it was
designed to put common characters far apart on the board so that they
wouldn\'t jam. Jams ocurred more frequently on nearby characters. The fact
that we are still using this stupid layout is for backwards compatability
which is the bane of all progress but probably good for the profit margin.

I endeavour to tell you about some practices here in Sweden to preserve=20

The Stockholm Tolkien & fantasy society to which I belong was once upon a t=

Last night I get the official timeline from TNE and calculated the
"equivalent" times in Earth-history.  I.E. in 1117 the Imperium is 1117
years old.  1117 before 1996AD is 879AD.  Take an example from "local
history": 879 is approx the time that Kenneth MacAlpine unified Scotland.
How many people, even here, know that, or care?  At high school history
lessons skimmed over everything before the industrial revolution (:-()
giving only the broadest strokes before getting to the "relevant" stuff.  I
would guess that education in the Imperium would have a similar bias towards
"recent" events, and every planet would have its own spin on what the events
meant.  The foundation of the Imperium would surely be a semi-legendary
event to most people, perhaps like the origins of China to modern people
living there.   I think that the average Imperial citizen might view the
rise of Terra and its conquest of the Ziru Sirka in much the same way as we
view the arrival in Greece of certain iron-armed tribes from the steppes:
very important to the origins of our culture but not really relevant nowadays.

I agree that records would survive into the far future, but I\'m not sure how
complete they would be.  For example, how many history books will make it
onto CD, and how many of those will eventually make it onto holo-cube and
subsequent media? How many scholars will dedicate their careers to studying
the history of pre-fusion Terra?  On Earth itself people might know (for
example) that their was once a great country called the United States, and
that it had presidents and that one was called Kennedy, but I would guess
that practically no-one would know which order the presidents served or what
they did, just as very few people know which order the pharoahs ruled in.
On other imperial planets people might be aware that there was once a world
called Terra (barbaric name!) and that much imperial culture was orginally
derived from there, and that the Terrans claimed to be the original humans:
I wonder if they would be aware of much more.  But think of the
opportunities for future Cecil B DeMilles - "Thrill as Neil Armstrong, his
glamourous sidekick Valentina and the heroic soldiers of Nasa battle against
viscious Aslan raiders on the sands of ancient Luna" (subtitles in Anglic) :-)

Canon says that the TC grew out of the United Worlds, which itself
grew out of the UN.  There is a Challenge adventure (I forget which
Challenge, or the adventure\'s title) about an early Terran explorer
who some how survives to the 57th Century, and her experience of the
TC was that it was fairly liberal - the racist ideals of the Solomani
(who claim her and her preiod of history as role models) disgust her.
Of course, the hawks in the TC were gaining power, and the TC probably
became a military-inclined nation shortly after she left the scene (in
a misjump induced by the first shots of the First Interstellar War, I
seem to remember.)  Whoa, just reread your post - do you mean the new
Terran Confederation, ie. post-collapse?  In that case the TC is
fascist, if it derives from the Solomani Confederation.  Doesn\'t the
latest Traveller Chronicle cover this area?

No way! Let me tell you a little secret - the US of A doesn\'t exist in
the 58th century!  Unless your citizen comes from Terra, this
knowledge is going to be entirely unknown, and even then it would
probably be relatively common knowledge for North American citizens.
Don\'t underestimate the average man\'s ignorance of history.  I\'m
hardly average, but about all I know is that Washington was a general
and later the 1st President, Lincoln had something to do with slaves,
wore a top hat, and was shot, and JFK was also shot, and owned a
rocking chair (or was that his missus).  I\'m not even 100% sure on any
of this (so don\'t flame me if I\'m wrong on my US history, because that
just makes my point stronger).  A human from Sol region might know
important leaders of the Terran Confederation or The Rule of Man, but
in canon references the only pre-Long Night leaders mentioned are the
1st and 2nd Emperors of The Rule of Man!

How many average people can name Roman Emperors?  Caeser? Not a name,
but a title (although I think the distinction was a little blurred
then).  We know who the Emperors were, fairly closely, but almost no
one without a specific interest will be able to name many of them.
The same is true of ancient Terran governments in the 58th century.

If one accepts this for starships it is interesting. Since we know how much
starships cost, how long it takes to build them, and the salaries of engineers
we can calculate _how many_ people are needed to build a ship.

Sticking to classic, Book 2 puts the average starship engineer at a salary
of 4000Cr per month. First lets assume that the average starship _constructor_
earns the same. Second lets assume 100% loading. Ie. that the administrative
cost of a person is equal to their cost in salary (true for the software 
industry,
the only experience I have).

By Book 2, the standard scount costs 29.43MCr and takes 9 months to build.
Thats a cost of 3.27MCr per month. Of that 1.635MCr is labour. Removing
the loading leaves 817.5KCr cost in salaries. Dividing by the normal wage
implies that it requires 204 engineers working full time to build a standard
scoutship.

Applying this to the rest of the standard ships we get:

Free Trad     211
Sub Merch     451
Sub Line      673
Yacht         290
Merc Cruis   1115
Pat Cruis     987

So, for example, if a starport wins a contract for making a subsidised liner
that garuntees jobs for over six hundred workers for nearly two years. You
can see how governments might subsidise such vessels not just for
garunteed freight service but also for the employoment it ingenders.

In fact you might say that such subsidised vessels are primarily built during
slumps in commercial shipping. Rather than have loads of ship yard workers
laied off and either degenerate or move away, commissioning a subsidised
ship keeps them gainfully employed and their skill sets current. The trickle
down effect benefits the rest of the economy. For this the government gets
a ship that must service their shipping requirements and probably at a very
good price, since prices would drop during a slump.

"Ah yes", said the old starhand, "The Willful Wallabie here was built during
the depression of the 1030s. She may be old but you will find no problem
getting spare parts. There are thousands like her that the governments
were churning out. In fact they say that the economic boom of the 1040s
was caused by the increase in shipping tonnage due to all the subsidised
ships on the market place. And she can be yours for the excelent price of ..."

In the private sector, companies would mainly be concerned with keeping
their facilities in full production for as much time as possible. (Assuming that
construction engineers are permanant rather than casual hire. Not necessarily
valid comparing to today.) Consequently there would probably be _less_
shipyard space than demand would indicate.  It is more profitable to have a 
medium
sized shipyard that is always busy than a large one that stands idle 
occasionally.
Shipyards would only expand when they were really certain they could support
it. Competing shipyards would strive to get someone "book in" to slots in as
far advance as possible. So they might give attractive discounts to a 3 year
contract which work may not start on for 1 year (or more!).

Inbetween the public and private sector you would have unions or other worker
"representative" bodies. Their main concern is not profit but increased wages
and numbers of workers. They would likely lobby at increasing the size of
shipyards whenever possible. In good times they can use the threat of strike
to try to drive the salaries of their members up and in bad times they might
cut deals promising not to strike and fix wages in return for lump-sum 
donations.


Gee, this is begining to sound like all the debate around Welsh Mines in the
80s. Am I too fixed in my century or do some things never change?

Consider also how much information can fit in just a single CD-ROM
today, and DVDs are expanding this. How soon will it be before every
"important" book ever written will fit on a single optical disk?
I don\'t know how long a CD-ROM will last (it\'s probably longer than
100 years if its shrink-wrapped :-), but all that it takes is for
somebody to reprint it every so often. Even if you have to spend
some time figuring out a disk format from 200 years ago (which isn\'t
really *that* hard), the knowledge from one disk would be worth it.

1, and I\'ve noted the continuing improvement in quality with pleasure.  
While still not up to the production values and content of JTAS, 
Challenge, or Traveller\'s Digest, the last few issues of TC are quite good.

  As others have noted, the primary focus of Issue 10 is the Solomani Rim 
in the New era.  16 subsector maps with data for systems for both 1117 
and 1202 occupy 16 pages, with another 10 pages of text describing 
significant features of the sector, are very well done - certainly as 
good as any of the sector supplements produced by GDW and others.  With 
an index and other information, the Solomani Rim section makes up 36 
pages out of 56.

  According to the editorial, future issues will detail the major polical 
entities of the Solomani Rim and provide equipment and ship designs for 
Classic, MT, and New Era settings - it looks like this will be Sword of 
the Knight\'s pocket empire for the near future.  The Terran Republic, a 
pocket empire centered on Earth, seems especially interesting, as a 
non-fanatical religeous empire.  I\'ve always thought that religion was 
one of the most neglected aspect of Traveller - I\'m looking forward to 
the next issue.

  One interesting piece of information is in the writeup for Arcturus 
Subsector on the planet Cymbeline (the source of the Deyo chips used in 
Imperial Transponder circuits and Virus).  This mentions that Vampire 
ships make "pilgramages" to Cymbeline (to visit their ancestors?) and 
come away with altered programing, an "Evangelical Doomslayer" strain 
that wants revenge on Lucan for nuking Cymbeline in the late stages of 
the Wars of the Rebellion.  The altered Vampires then head Coreward to 
try and find Lucan.  This explains the "Vampire Highway" from the 
RC material.  I have not seen this explanation in print before, though I 
may have missed it, and I rather like it.

  The remainder of the issue is an adventure.  One nice aspect is that 
the setup provides three settings - Reformation Coalition, Regency, or 
the Traveller Chronicles own Far Frontiers.  A typical rescue scenario, 
the adventure is well written, though the final resolution of the mystery 
brings those naughty Ancients in again.

  Overall, a solid effort, though the interior art is still substandard 
(nice cover, though) - well worth the purchase price.  Most useful for 
TNE GMs, though for folks without the old GDW Solomani Rim supplement 
this is a cheap way to get that data.  Two thumbs up.

Computer tapes 20 years old may be hard to read. Cassette tapes that

It doesn\'t take *that* much of the workforce. Plus, there are some
storage formats being worked on that look to be a lot more stable over
long periods.

But now you know why businesses are so strong on hardcopy records.

Another factor just coming into play are the legal aspects. There are
court rulings that make such things as email by government employees
"public records" which must be stored indefinitely.

And folks like Project Gutenberg are working hard to get a lot of stuff
into machine readable format. And that stuff *will* keep getting moved
to new formats.

Only if it\'s an imaging sensor. Simpler (and much cheaper and more
reliable) sensors can detect things like mucle contractions or joint
flexes. I think tension of tendons would work well as that\'s
proportional to the flexing of the fingers, and can be easily measured

Won\'t help them with me. Last time I used the OAG, I selected start and

I suspect that we\'ll reach the situation described in an Analog story.
Everyone will have their personal AI, and it\'ll download the local laws
as you enter the jurisdiction. Then it\'ll advise you on what you need
to worry about.

Lawyers and laws haven\'t gotten a lot of attention from computer
science types yet. But it turns out that the notation used for computer
langauge syntax diagrams works *very* well for laws. And the result is
both more compact and easier to understand. 

Lexical analysis is going to make things *very* different. It\'s a
relatively new tool, and hasn\'t (yet) been applied in this area. 

As for plot ideas, how about a "practical joke" by a "friend". He loads
a program into your "glasses" that does to your vision and hearing what
things like "jive" and "valspeak" do to text.

You could get into a *lot* of trouble before you took off the glasses.

   I overheard in interesting conversation the other day while sitting in a
local theater waiting for the movie ``Independence Day`` to start (by
the way, I highly recommend it--it\'s not ``Sense and Sensibility``, but
then it doesn\'t try to be--it is vaguely reminiscent of the Star Wars trilogy,
however).

   A person brought up the name Clark Cable during a conversation.  The
other said, ``oh yeah, he was an actor, wasn\'t he?``

   In a conversation with my sister a few years ago, I brought up the
name Elton John.  She, being ten years younger than me, had no idea
who he was.

   Information and historical data will no doubt be available in quantity
about 20th century Earth in the 58th century.  The real question is, will
anyone care, or will certain myths be accepted as fact.

   We know from Survival Margin that Strephon quoted Lincoln, so at
least some American influence continues on.  The Third Imperium is
described as having a substantial middle-class, and that Imperial culture
is similar to ``that of late 20th century America`` (then again we should
remember that the authors of Traveller are late 20th century Americans,
so we shouldn\'t be too surprised).

   One twist that is part of Traveller canon involves the worship by
a certain Solomani religious sect, of Elvis Presley.  While probably just
thrown in for comic relief, remember that there really *is* a group
currently in existence that calls itself ``The Church of Elvis``, in which
believers treat Elvis Presley as a holy man (these people claim to be
nominally Christian).

   Now on to Jamie Young\'s comments:

   Good point.  It is likely that the average Imperial citizen doesn\'t know
Lincoln from Washington.  Someone with `History-1` might know that
they were great American Presidents, someone with `History-2` might
also know that Washington was the first U.S. president (some with
History-7 would know that John Hancock was technically the first
president, but he was President of the Continental Congress), and that
Lincoln was President during something called ``The American Civil
War``, which they might wrongly conclude was similar to the Imperial
Civil War and that characters such as Lee and Jefferson Davis were
generals trying to seize the Presidency from Lincoln.  You get the idea.

>I would guess that education in the Imperium would have a similar bias
>towards "recent" events, and every planet would have its own spin on
>what the events meant.  

   While certain facts was be consistent because to the influence of
Imperial culture, it is likely that if you want to study American history
(or British history, etc.) you would have to do your own independent
studies, or take an Ancient History course down at the local university.

>How many scholars will dedicate their careers to studying the history
>of pre-fusion Terra?  

   Probably large numbers of them, just as there as large numbers of
Egyptologists today.  Rancorous debates would probably take place
between Imperial and Solomani ``Terraology`` scholars about the causes
of World War II, what country baseball originated in, controversial 
interpretations and translations of ancient Terran texts (remember folks,
it is very unlikely that the people who speak Galactic English are
speaking the Queen\'s English--Lord knows if anyone still speaks Italian
in any form), etc.

   And Stewart Eyres writes:

   Rachel Strider was her name.  As I recall, the ending of the adventure
left it open as to whether she was the real thing or an imposter trying
to embarrass the Solomani government.

   Hundreds of years of war created a ``warrior elite`` who were
responsible for the prosecution of the war.  Looked on and idolized as
heroes, no doubt, unfortunately one of them decided that the
Confederation government had no business treating the Vilani Imperium
as spoils of war, and decided to instigate a coup....

>Doesn\'t the latest Traveller Chronicle cover this area?

   The latest Traveller Chronicle (#10) covers primarily New Era material
for the Solomani Rim (the Terran Republic), though there are references
to pre-Collapse history.  The next couple of issues of Traveller Chronicle
should go into more depth about pre-Collapse matters.

   Nor does the UK, at least as we known it.  There are administrative
districts called `England`, `Scotland`, etc. but they exist as a way to
divide the planet for governing purposes only.  There are probably
cultural regions, where tourists can gawk at ``Californians`` and
``Germans`` (who probably aren\'t those things any more than residents
of Rome are Ancient Romans), but that\'s as close as you\'re going to get
to being home.

>Don\'t underestimate the average man\'s ignorance of history.

   You\'re comments about Washington and Lincoln and Kennedy prove
the point I was making about Clark Cable and Elton John above.

   BTW, President Kennedy owned the rocking chair--he had a bad back
and the chair helped.  Lincoln freed the slaves (actually Union troops and
the slaves themselves did the real work, but you get the idea).

   I wonder how many Americans can name even three UK Prime
Ministers?  We\'ll worry about the royals later....

   Actually Caesar, and it was both a name and a title (as was
Augustus).  The original Caesar was of course Julius.  Later on during
the Empire it became a title.

   Of course I know much of the above because I was a History major
in college.  Others may not know as much.

This is a BIG (Read: HUGE, ENORMOUS, GARGANTUAN) assumption.  First off, you
wouldn\'t be using what Traveller calls Engineers (at least not what we first
think of).  The only real place we have for these guys in our ship yard is
in the Maintenance Dept, and they rarely work on ships.  Some of your cost
is going to people who in Traveller would best be described as Business
Professionals (could be Engineers) with a high Starship Architecture skill.
Starting pay for these types IIRC is $25K with top levels being as high as
$50K to $75K.  Most of your cost is going to go to Construction workers.
These fellows make $6.00 to $13.00 an hour.  We typically work the yard
48-60 hours a week depending on how far behind we are.  In our ship yard
(and I think as the norm) we have welders, fitters, painters, and helpers
(the yards that do vessels as opposed to jus barges add electrical and
mechanical).  The experience of the worker is going to determine how much he
makes.

>Second lets assume 100% loading. Ie. that the administrative

>the only experience I have).

This is not true at all.  The software industry must have a high overhead
rate!!  In our shipyard, we have about 200 employees whose pay is charged to
the job, and about 25 "overhead" employees who don\'t charge their time
directly to a job.  As I\'m in purchasing, I don\'t know the actual pay
figures for people, but my guess is that our overhead pay is close to $70K
to 80K per month.  Our job direct employees would be in the neighborhood of
$450K per month.  Of course, since I\'ve been here we have never had fewer
than three hulls in the yard, and about every other job is a multiple hull
job.  A typical contract is for $8 to 10 Million (8,000,000) per hull.  This
is for a barge with no propulsion or crew quarters.  Just a bunch of cargo
space and painting and , depending on the type, we also add piping, pumps,
and generators or engines to run the pumps (for cargo handling).  Anyway,
the point is, that I would consider a typical ship yard to have overhead at
20 to 25 percent of job direct labor.  Of course, I wasn\'t including Labor
in my figures the other day, and whil they were slop figures and very
conservative, the excess wouldn\'t be enough to cover the entire overhead
figure.  Also, most yards would probably be part of a corporation that had a
main office that charged overhead.  That overhead wasn\'t in my figure
either, and I have no idea how much that number would be, but I do know that
it would be split between at least two yards (although only two or three
yards centralized overhead would probably be run from one of the yards.)

These figures are all costs, the price would only be 15 to 25 percent of
that, and you should use the price figure to come up with the accurate labor
numbers.  Also, I\'m curious what the "cannon" time to build these other
ships is.  I don\'t think I agree with the 9 month figure to build a Std
Scout.  I would probably list is as at least a year and consider it a quick
project.  I mentioned in my post that it was going to take almost 3 years to
build a 600Td hull (Barge only, add at least 6 mo for a ship).  This is a
typical time for Government jobs.  Civillian Jobs take a bit less, maybe two
years.  This time is pretty standard for hulls from 250Td to 900Td.  The
smaller hulls would take probably a year and a half on average.  I\'d be
interested to see how your figures match the current norms based on what I
believe to be a more accurate construction time.  I\'ll get with the
Production Controll guy here and get some numbers on manhours for different
size hulls, and post that later if the interest continues.

Shipyard workers are very migratory.  For example, Down here on the coast,
many of our yard workers quit during shrimp season and go out to run their
shrimp boat until the season is over, at which time they come back and hire
on again.

The shipbuilding community usually runs on a three to six year cycle, that
is every three to four years there is more work than there is yards.  The
idea is to get work lined up for your yard to last throughout the coming
slump.  Its not easy, but that\'s what makes the estimators hair grey.  ;)

This is true to some extent, but I\'ve never seen a shipyard at 100 percent
capacity.  Naturally, you want to make the most of every inch of your
facility, but this really isn\'t practical.  I\'d expect the average to be
around 55 to 60 percent capacity.  Of course, often a good 25 to 35 percent
of your capacity is taken up by repair jobs.  Repair jobs are a different
story altogether.  The fariance in repair jobs is so vast, that it is
difficult to even set a standard.  For example, a simple job, like blasting
and repainting a set of deck barges is usually a cash cow for yards.  Other
jobs, like re-outfitting a barge, can take your shirt along with all your
money.  It is an art to know which jobs to bid on and shich to refuse.

The reality of the Shipworkers unions is much less dramatic than that of the
United Railworkers Union, the United Autoworkers Union, or any of the other
"highly visible" Unions here in America.  In reality, the Union does the job
it is supposed to, that is working with management as a representative of
the employees as a whole to improve working conditions.


Sorry to those of you who aren\'t interested in this stuff, but finally the
topic has come around the circle to something I know about and can talk
somewhat intelligently about.  Hope this helps folks better understand
Traveller shipbuilding.  When I find the time, I\'m gonna try to work up an
information type document on my take on Traveller starship construction.
I\'ll post it to the list for comment

Calculating how many people it takes to build a starship is a cute idea,
but your examples have some big wholes. Is the price of a vessel the
wholesale or retail value? You make some pretty large assumptions - that
everyone gets paid the same and that salary costs are equal to
administrarative costs.

Sorry to put a damper on things. Like I said, it\'s a cute idea, but there
are two many huge assumptions for it to be even a rough estimate.

would be the only people who managed to combine TL 12 with a sector-wide
government.  With these resources at their command it would be relatively
easy for them to expand and incorporate surrounding worlds and
confederations.  Given that many of these worlds and confederation would
join willingly, the Imperium could grow quite readily.   Once the 
Imperium covered several sectors none of these minor confederations could 
possibly stand in its way.

Another possibility for destruction:  Perhaps this is solely an American 
phenominon, but it seems that there are always groups who enjoy burning 
books, recorded music, etc. that they disagree with.  If such a feeling 
were to sweep the nation for whatever reason, there would be mass 
destruction of all kinds of material.

Probably will never happen...but, I fear, it is no less likely than all 
of your country being razed by a nuclear barrage. :(

Paul-

No apologies necessary.  Lists such as this are (IMHO) created so that 
people who have knowledge in very specific areas (that\'s you) can share 
said knowledge with people who pay insurance claims (that\'s me).  Keep up

something familiar, something that people can realate to.  If there\'s

Movie\'s have it easy, there\'s tons of visual clues that give you a

there so that players and GM\'s can loose themselves in the alienness of a 
world but still find something that they can latch onto and call their 
own.

Lets face it a game that refers to the angry chords of the 45th century 
guitarist Kensley Charles isn\'t going to mean squat to us, however a 
refrence to the disillusioned angst of the "Smashing Pumpkins" gives us 
something we can all relate to, the music pops into our head, assuming 
we\'ve heard it, Kensley Charles means nothing and conjours no images.

I like it!  The label "Long Night" was put on the period by 3rd

See 13 Travellers\' Digest.  The whole issue is devoted to Earth in the 57th

The problem isn\'t the density of the data storage medium it\'s the 
lifespan before that medium is unreadable. The magnetic domains in 
computer tapes "print-through" from layer to layer over time. After 
fifteen to twenty years the amount of "signal" from print-through is 
higher than the noise threshold on the tape. This makes it difficult and 
expensive to read the tape and extract the data from it. This isn\'t a 
problem if you know what\'s on each tape because you can pick and choose 
which tapes to process. But after you\'re gone and the only thing left is 
a box of mag-tapes...

The second problem is data format and it\'s even bigger. In many cases 
tape is easier in this regard because it\'s a serial stream of "words" 
recorded across the tape surface. CD-ROM is harder because it\'s a serial 
stream of bits so the wordsize information is encoded in the CD-ROM 
reader which certainly won\'t exist n * 10^3 years from now. 

Think of it this way. In the year 5700 AD any CD is going to be a 
curious little disk with a very long serial bit stream encoded on a 
piece of aluminum sandwiched between two layers of acrylic plastic. No offense to 
anyones musical taste but without the label and/or a CD-DA/ROM reader, 
how do you tell the difference between "Frampton comes alive" and 
"Project Gutenburg"? Even if they only encoded data on CD-ROM how do you 
tell the difference between "Project Gutenburg" and "Northbrook Vehicle 
taxes assed - 1996"

When you layer on top of this the fact that every CD-ROM that\'s pressed 
isn\'t going to survive from now until the 5th frontier you\'ve got to 
admit that alot of information is going to be lost. 

Now don\'t forget that this assumes that the storage method (CD-ROM/DA 
is just an example) doesn\'t suffer from some sort of bit rot over time 
like magnetic tape does.

Cassette tapes that old are worse. You can hear the print through on a

It depends on the storage format of the original material and the 
cost that the vendor of the new information system assigns to data 
conversion. It also depend on whether or not the customer is willing to 
pay the vendor\'s price. This is highly variable. The hospital that I used 
to work for had medical records dating back to 1826. They had on-line 
information dating back to 1987. The online data is simple to convert so 
it stays but the paper information is purged once it\'s confirmed that 
the the patient has died and the info is no longer needed. This is the 
typical case.

Hardcopy records are _currently_ difficult to save. In many cases they 
are not stored on acid free paper so the storage medium itself is 
degrading (like magnetic tapes).

Don\'t confuse indefinitely with infinitely. You are observing a current
law which is up to the whim of the contemporary court system. A reversal
of the decision that this information must be stored "indefinitely" could
result in it\'s lawful erasure on privacy grounds. And there is only a 
finite amount of time and money that we can spend maintaining this 
information. Eventually someone will deem it useless and toss it into the 
cirular file.

Actually I disagree with you a little bit here.  Every bit of 
canonical reference points out to a general disruption of commerce, a 
decline in technology.  Yes, some areas survived as Pocket Empires, 
but I recall Vilani & Vargr stating that Vland even slipped far 
enough to lose the ability to produce new ships at 1 point.  No it 
wasn\'t the stone age horror of TNE, but I suspect that there would be 
lots of TL 6-8 worlds whose internal economies could no longer 
support the technology to build starships...exploring Year 0 are going 
to find a lot of TL 6-8 planets slow

Actually, from the way I read what we\'ve been presented by IG, the 
Syleans are the ONLY ones with TL12, giving them some very real 
advantages...

This part is sounds very plausible to me...  The choices presented to 
them in the early years would be join a stellar empire with obvious 
edges in technology and commerce, or get squashed like a bug...

technology or squashed, gee, which is it going to be?

OK, more clarification.  The Labor percent (Avg: 30%) includes Overhead
(Both Corporate and Yard), Engineering, and Actual Construction Crew.  Each
of these four divisions use about 7.5% of the labor cost.  This fixes the
problem I refered to in my last post.

Also, using the Starship Salary rates from the TNE main book, and
considering someone with skill level one as a laboror, and assuming the pay
listed would be 1/3 of someone not serving onboard a ship (with free room
and board) the average dollar value could be converted directly to credits.
I have the calculations if anyone is interested.  (It actually converts to
the low pay in the yard, and the higher skill levels would be payed higher.)

I\'ve figured out the problem.  Most of it came from the fact that Iwas using
the entire 30% for yard laborers working on the vessel rather than the
overhead, engineers and all.  Anyway, I came up with the following figures
for the standard ships in BL.

The Construction Time Column is for a single shift (48hrs/wk, 52wks/yr).
Add 2 Months of Engineering lead time at the beginning of the project.  Add
1/4 of the time for "sea trials" at the end of construction (More for
military vessels).

I\'m working on the rules system to explain Starship construction Costs and
Times, and I\'ll post it as soon as its done.

I bet you that they hold the data until *years* after the patient dies.
If not, they will, first time there\'s a lawsuit and they can\'t produce
the records.

All too true. But businesses count microfilm as "hardcopy". I have a
friend whose job used to be microfilming bank records all day long. And
this was for a medium size "local" bank.

Actually, Lincoln only freed the slaves in the states that had formed
the Confederacy! It was intended as a tactic to help disrupt things
down there. Slaves in states that stayed in the Union weren\'t freed
until *after* the war.

Just off the top of my head, Chamberlain, Churchill, and Thatcher. And
I *think* the current one is Majors.

As for the royals, there\'s Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Phillip, and Prince
Andrew (again just off the top of my head).

I\'m not a history major. But I have a mind that retains trivia, and

event.  Any worlds which were in a position to be moderately
self-sufficient could still build starships.  I doubt much knowledge was

the Long Night was *long*.  In the immediate wake of the collapse, when
everyone\'s economy went to hell it\'s easy to imagine that even Vland would
be in sorry enough shape to no longer be producing starships.  Their
economy simply couldn\'t afford it.  However, all their extant ships would
still exist.  I see the Long Night as not only less extreme that the
Virus, but in many ways, as less extreme than the later stages of The
Black War (no one was pounding hundreds of worlds into oblivion at the
beginning of the Long Night). 

Sure, the first few decades of The Long Night would be economic chaos for
everyone, and non-self sufficient worlds would likely die off or collapse
into barbarism.  However, any civilization who survived the first century
would (IMHO) be ready to look beyond the borders of its star system again. 
The whole Gateway sector was colonized during the later part of the Long
Night (and not by the Syleans).  I see lots of folks doing the same thing,
exploration, limited traded, local colonization efforts, but no true
empires, and the constant threat of pirates (ie your unfriendly stellar
neighbors whose worlds also have starships) as well as near total
ignorance as to the current state of other worlds.

I\'d ammend this to the only ones with TL 12 in their immediate area.  The 
Darrians were probably back up to this level, and I\'d imagine that some 
of the worlds near the Solomani Rim were doing equally well.

political/military.

I\'ve a few alternative recommendations for folks to look at, for a 
different view.

George R.R. Martin: 

Dying of the Light, Tuf Voyaging, Sandkings, and Nightflyers (the later
three being anthologies).  Dying of the Light, and Tuf Voyaging, as well
as most of the stories in the later two books are set in a mileau which is
*remarkably* similar to the Imperium (mostly human dominated space
recovering form a prior collapse...).  Martin\'s culture\'s and worlds are 
very rich and imaginative.  Each world, and each culture is strange and 
wonderful.

Elucki Bes Shahar: 

Hellflower, Darktraders, and Archangel Blues:  These books are in a
setting which is almost *identical* to the Imperium, however, the plots
involve theft, trade, and intrigue more than war and politics.  Also,
culturally, (and in the details, technologically) this setting is very
different form the modern day, wonderful stuff). 

Joan Vinge:

Snowqueen, World\'s End, Summerqueen:  Wonderful books in a setting which 
has some similarities to the Imperium, and would be great to borrow from. 
Once again, the level of rich detail is wonderful.

Enjoy!

>>This is cannon, 

How I hate that term! 

But if you must use it, use it correctly!  A cannon is a large mounted
piece of artillery.  Canon is a law or body of laws...generally of a
church.  The Church of Traveller?  <G>

Now back to Jump Theory....the following is not CANON, it is ERIS! <g>

=================================================================

                    How Jump Drives Work

Jump Drives have two separate components, the Jump Coil and the Jump
Grid.  Both are required for a ship to complete a jump.

The Jump Coil is a large device located somewhere inside the ship.  It
rips an opening between normal space and jump space large enough for a
ship to enter.  The opening persists for less than a minute.  Creating
an opening is an electro-mechanical action that requires a huge amount
of energy in the form of electricity.  Even so this uses only a small
portion of the fuel a ship carries.  Capacitors (or other storage
mechanisms) are often used to build up the required charge needed to
energize the Coil.  Preparing for a jump normally takes several
minutes while the capacitors are charged, the Coil is set in the
correct configuration, and the engineers make sure the electrical and
mechanical components are all working correctly.  Once a ship has
entered jump space the Coil is shut down, cooled and often serviced by
the engineering staff.

The Jump Grid is built into the ship\'s hull.  Its purpose is to
maintain a barrier between jump space and normal space.  This barrier
is required because, as you know, humans (and all known aliens) suffer
madness and death if exposed directly to the effects of jump space.
The Grid is energized before a ship enters jump space, exhibiting the
trademark violet and blue shifting patterns as the ship moves into the
opening into jump space.  The Grid runs continuously while a ship is
in jump space.  The Grid uses a substantial portion of the fuel a ship
carries.  Loss or reduction of power to the Grid is very dangerous,
and its function should be continuously monitored.  Most ships are
built so that the Grid overlaps to compensate for hull or Grid damage.
As you would expect, warships incorporate much more overlap than
civilian ships.

                   Why a Starship Needs Coolant

Starships produce huge amounts of energy as they travel through space.
Most of this energy eventually turns into internal heat that must be
removed to keep the internal temperature at acceptable levels.  Ships
generally regulate internal heat by circulating coolant through large
radiators.  A good deal of this coolant is inevitably vented into
space. Ships in jump space continue to produce heat internally, and
while in jump space they must continue with heat regulation.  In jump
space, as in normal space, the most effective method for cooling the
ship is venting heated coolant.

The interesting thing is that Bill\'s stuff was "pop culture" when it

maybe it\'ll be "The Young Ones." <g>

METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION

CONSTRUCTION TIMES


Methods of Construction

Typically there are three methods of construction in shipyards within the
Imperium: Frame Construction, Hull Construction, and Modular Construction.
While each of these types of construction affords certain benefits for
different construction facilities, perhaps the most popular is the Modular
Construction Method.

Frame Construction:  A shipyard using the Frame Construction method
generally will begin construction with the creation of the internal
structure and framing of a starship.  After the basic frame structure is
created, the various components are added in place, and where necessary
floor, wall, and ceiling plates are installed.  When all, or the majority,
of the components are added, they are all connected and the remaining floor,
wall, and ceiling plates are installed.  Finally, the hull is added to the
outside of the structure, and any external components are added.  This
method of construction is particularly useful in the construction of open
frame hulls, small hulls, and hulls with few exterior components.

Hull Construction:  The Hull Construction method is typically used with
military and other government hulls (*1), odd hull configurations, and hulls
with specialized internal designs.  The basic process in this type of
construction is to start with the basic structure of the hull, and add the
internal structure and components as necessary.  With the aid of
anti-gravity technology, the actual hull is held in place until the
appropriate internal structure and armor plating can be added.  Once the
internal structure and additional armor are added, the internal plating
(floor, wall, and ceiling) and the components are added.  Finally the
components are connected and initialized.

        *1 - Typically only military and government hulls that will require the
             installation of components that have been developed secretly for
             the government.

Modular Construction:  Modular Construction is used profitably for any type
of hull, but extremely reduces the cost of standardized hulls.  In Modular
Construction, the base of the hull is laid out, and modules are added as the
hull is built up.  For example, in a simple design, the bottom of the hull
would be manufactured, and teh engineering modules would be added to the
bottom deck, then as the fore and aft hull was being added on, the second
level floor would be added, and on top of it, the quarters modules.
Finally, the hull would be sealed, the components would be connected, and
the hull delivered.  While it is typical for the hull to be created from the
bottom to the top, it is not necessary that it begin with the bottom.  In
fact, some shipyards will only begin a modular construction from the aft.


CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

Welders:  The welder is the worker who adds the final securing to the hull
and internal structure.  After a fitter (see below) has placed the building
materials where they belong, the welder comes in and attaches these
materials with a permanent weld.

Fitters:  Fitters are responsible to place the plate, angle, channel, and
other structural and hull material in the proper place.  Typically the
fitter will secure these pieces with a few plasma welds until the welding
crew comes to finish the welding and secure th peice in place.

Electricians:  Electricians are responsible for running the electrical
cables throughout the ship.  These cables provide both power and data
transfer to and from the systems of the ship.  In addition, the electricians
are responsible for installing the electrical components onboard the ship.

Gravtics:  The gravtic crew is responsible for installing the gravity
systems (both contra gravity lifters and ship gravity) on board the ship
and, in some cases, the maneuver drive.  This crew is also responsible for
connecting these systems to the power and data cables provided by the
electricians.

Engineers:  The engineering crew is responsible for installing and
connecting the remaining systems.  This includes jump drive, power plant,
life support, quarters, hanger, and, on civillian ships, weapons.

Weapons specialists:  On military ships, this crew is responsible for
installing and connecting the weapon system.

Painters:  This crew is responsible for coating the hull (interior and
exterior) with the appropriate color shceme as well as the proper protective
paints.

Material Handlers:  This is the crew that actually gets the material from
its location in storage to the place wher the installation crew needs it.

Foremen:  These are the supervisors.  There are two groups in this heading,
the job foremen and the yard foremen.  The job foremen are assigned to each
hull and responsible for coordinating the construction from start to finish.
The yard are usually assigned to multiple hulls at once and are responsible
for overseeing the various crews in the yard (ie, welding foreman, fitting
foreman).

Laborers:  This crew is assigned as needed to assist the other crews.  Their
responsibility varies from getting welding material to unloading material to
mixing paint.  Typically this crew is responsible for the final clean up on
board a vessel before trials begin.

Architects:  This is the crew that actually designs the ship based on the
customers specifications.  They are responsible for determining the best
system to fit the customers requirements as well as designing the location
of equipment within the customers guidelines.  This crew provides the yard
with the blueprints with which they construct the hull.  This group also
include the specialists who help the customer determine what will work and
what will not work.

Office Employees:  This group includes the purchasing, accounting,
personnel, and management departments.  Also included in this group is the
sales and marketing staff as well as company laywers and project management.


CONSTRUCTION PRICES

Price:  The price listed for starships in most packages is the actual final
price for the vessel.  Typically shipyards will offer a ten percent (10%)
discount for customers willing to use standardized products rather than
specialized equipment.  Many shipyards have also implemented a standard
practice of allowing a twenty-five percent (25%) discount for ships built
using "off-the-shelf" components, that is components that are either in the
shipyard inventory or standard items available within weeks from a vendor.

Cost:  The cost of a starship typically runs between 80% to 95% (Avg: 85%)
of the actual sale price with 25% to 35% (Avg: 30%) for labor and overhead,
and 75% to 65% (Avg: 70%) for materials.  The 30% average for labor is
typically divided evenly between actual yard workers, designer/architect,
yard office, and corporate overhead (each getting 7.5%).  Here is a simple
breakdown of the starship cost:

     Cost Breakdown:
             Labor                      
                         Job Labor -  7.5%
                  Design/Architect -  7.5%
                     Yard Overhead -  7.5%
                Corporate Overhead -  7.5%
             Total Labot                        30%
             Material                           70%
                                              ----
             Total Cost                        100%


CONSTRUCTION TIME

In a typical shipyard, working 48 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, operating
only one shift, the construction time for a starship can be calculated using
the following formula:

        Tc = (.208 * P)/(D^0.5)

        Where:  Tc = Construction Time in Years
                 D = Displacement Tons
                 P = Price in MCr

To this figure, add .16 years for typical design time.  For civillian ships,
typical trials time will be twice the displacement divided by one hundred
months.  Military ships use the same formula only using four times the
displacement.  The formula for the number to add to construction time is:

        Tt = ((F * D)/100)/12

        Where:  Tt = Trials time in years
                 F = Multiple factor (2 for Civillian, 4 for Military)
                 D = Displacement Tons

The final time from contract signing to delivery of a starship would be:

        T = .16 + Tc + Tt

        Where:   T = Total time in years (contract to delivery)
                Tc = Construction time in years
                Tt = Trials time in years

These formula assume a single shift 48 hour work week and an average pay of
13Cr per hour in the yard.  It also assumes a 52 week per year schedule.  If
additional shifts are added (up to three shifts), simply divide the Tc
(Construction time) number by the number of shifts used.  Trials and Design
are not effected by additional shifts.

If any of the other factors are changed (ie, hours/work week, weeks/year, or
average hourly rate), the formula will not work.  As these are the averages,
this will be the typical time throughout the Imperium; however, if any of
these norms change, the following extended method can be used to determine
the construction time:

Step            Action                                  Result

 1.             Multiply 90% (or cost percent) by 
                 7.5% (or labor cost percentage) to
                 determine Job direct labor cost 
                 factor.                                Labor Cost Factor

 3.             Divide Labor cost factor by 1,000,000
                 then again divide by 13 (or average 
                 yard hourly rate) to determine man-
                 hour factor.                           Man-Hour Factor

 4.             Divide man-hour factor by 48 (or
                 number of hours worked per week) to
                 determine man-week factor.             Man-Week Factor

 5.             Divide man-week factor by 52 (or
                 number of weeks worked per year) to
                 determine man-year factor.             Man-Year Factor

             This number is:  the number of years it would take one man, or
                              the number of men it would take one year
                to build the ship, and must be adjusted based on the number of
                workers able to work on the ship at one time.

 6.             Determine the square root of the
                 displacement tons.                     Crew Factor

 7.             Multiply crew factor by 10 to
                 determine the maximum crew able to
                 work on the ship at one time.          Max Crew

             The initial formula for Construction Time is the Price of the
ship times the man-year factor divided by the max crew.  Again this is for
one shift, for more shifts divide the construction time by the number of shifts.

This just proves you are *not* average, which probably holds for
everyone on this list!  The *current* royals are easier, as they are
media targets.  Can you name the royals since say Queen Victoria, or
Henry VIII (please don\'t, I\'m just pointing out that naming them is a
long way from knowing anything about them).  What did Augustus or
Octavius actually do?  The point is that even if such information is
preserved into the 57th century (a debate I *do not* want to get
involved in) almost no one will care enough to learn. and schools will
have more important things to teach!

Someone said "neither will the UK" in response to my point that the
USA didn\'t exist in the 57th century.  I agree, I don\'t even expect
the UK to last long into the 21st century.  This wasn\'t my point - it
was the assumption that all Imperial citizens would know what was
essentially history trivia of some little nation of only 500 million
people, which ceased to exist in any meaningful sense millenia before
- - this, to my mind, showed a certain lack of realisation of quite how
distant the Imperium was from Terra today in terms of both time and
physical scales.  I also agree that references to contempory culture
etc. *do* provide a reference point, but I prefer references that are
seriously warped from reality as we (most of us) see it (a la "Saint
Elvis") - warped by both time and the different perspective of
Imperial citizens.

"Terran history in the 20th century was an ongoing series of
world-wide civil wars, with generals such as Churchill, Stalin, and
Kennedy fighting for control of the United Nations.  Some scholars
have attributed the rise in technology over that period to the
constant need to arm and cope with the consequences of numerous civil
wars, although this view has been discredited by Mattitian
sociopolitical theory.  This period is viewed as the end of the
`Terran Dark Ages\', prior to the `Golden Interstellar Age\' staring in
the 21st Century."

The writings of say Lincoln, or the speaches of Churchill may still
exist, but they will be interpreted in a modern context, and so
certainly not understood as they were at the time.  The writings in
the Bible, which are to some degree an historical account, are not
wholly understandable, and often it appears to contradict itself.  The
problem isn\'t only keeping a faithful record, but also the correct
understanding.

"Government of the People, for the People, by the People".  Did
Strephon really understand this in the same way as we think we do?
His government relied on inherited power, and provided an independence
to the nobility which in no way ensured fair government for his
subjects.  He refused Dulinor\'s democratic reforms (hence the
assasination), and whil he may have been right that the Imperium
wasn\'t ready for, he couldn\'t really believe (as suggested in Survival
Margin) that his empire related to Lincoln\'s view of government.  The
words may be remembers, even the achievements of those who said them,
but the understanding will change.

Hmm.. okay, yes there was a George V and a George VI.

William I-IV. William I was William the Conqueror, William II was not long
after, Willaim III was William of William and Mary, William IV was just
before Victoria. All being well, Prince William will become William V.
There was also a Stephen not long ofter William I. William I himself beat
Harold. Queen Anne was the daughter of William and Mary.

Lots of Henrys, and Mary was the daughter of Henry VIII (who wasn\'t
beheaded - that was Mary, Queen of Scots, beheaded by Elizabeth I, Henry
VIII\'s other
daughter).

Plenty of Edwards too, VIII of them.

There were 2 Charles, Charles I was beheaded by Cromwell, Charles II
defeated Cromwell\'s bunch and restored the Monarchy. Cromwell could have
become Oliver I had he wanted, but he refused the crown.

There were 3 Richards, the third of whom was beaten by Henry Tudor at Bosworth,
who them became Henry VII.

The James. There were 2 of these, but it gets a bit complicated here. James I
of England was James VI of Scotland, and James II of England was James VII of
Scotland. This also leads to Elizabeth II of England being Elizabeth I of
Scotland. James II was overthrown by William of Orange, who became William III
when he married Mary.

There has never been a historically documented Arthur, and there\'s never likely
to be another one, as every time the heir to the throne has been called
Arthur he\'s died before ascending the throne. As a result, it\'s considered
a very unlucky name for a royal. THE Arthur was probably a Romano-British
war-leader who resisted the invasion of the Saxons. Most of the romantic
legends are probably Breton in origin (Brittany in France being Lesser Britain,
as opposed to Great Britain).

Prince Albert was the only Prince Regent; Prince Phillip is the Duke of
Edinburgh.

Have I missed anyone out? If I have, my apologies, I\'m am engineer, not a
historian. :)

Some people have a problem with the physics of certain things in
Traveller - I have a huge problem with this.  Three and a half thousand
years of development, contact with a variety of alien races, intermixing
with a variety of human races, all with different cultural and historical
backgrounds - and the predominant culture is \'similar\' to late C20
America?  Please!  This makes virus look like a well thought out,

I never got the impression from CT that this was the case, but it certainly
seemed to come out in the TNE materials I read, and I think that it
was one of the weakest parts of the mileu.  This isn\'t for any anti-US
reasons, just for reasons of credibility and believability.  The authors
of Traveller may well be late C20 Americans, but then the majority of
SF writers are late C20 Americans, and that doesn\'t stop some of them
producing believable, interesting yet different far future cultures.

Oh come on!  The Imperium numbers some 11,000 worlds. Many
Imperials will be of Vilani or mixed Vilani/Solomani descent.  Many of
those who are of Solomani descent who are able to or willing to trace
their cultural ancestry will be from non-American stock.  Nearly FOUR
millenia will have passed since today.  I would suggest that the vast
majority of Imperial citizens would have no knowledge of the US\'
existence.  Why would somebody whose ancestors have been living
on world x for 2000 years be bothered about the early history of one of
the nations which was part of UNSCA which eventually became the
Terran Confederation etc etc.

There probably would be a few specialised historians who would be
historians of pre-spaceflight Terra.  But not many.  The average
Imnperial historian would be much more interested in the history of
their world, their subsector,their sector, their Imperium, than they would
be in that of a pre-spaceflight nation on Terra.

   I tried to pattern the stats as closely as possible after the work done
in The Regency Sourcebook (with one notable exception, see below),
the gold standard IMHO (if only they hadn\'t tried to cram 112 pages of
material into 96....eeech!), and previous classic GDW Traveller
publications.

   The concept here is that we\'ll give you enough stuff up front to get you
started, then continue to present material down the road.  The
concentration initially will be on the New Era setting, but other additional
material for the Second Solomani Rim War, Year Zero, etc. will also be
included as time/space/Kevin Knight\'s budget permits.

   Mechanics-wise, the vehicles and equipment will be FF&S based.
As Imperium Games publishes modified design sequences for T4, I\'ll
endeavor to convert everything to the new standard, and present new
T4-based designs as well.

   It was a concept I felt strongly enough about to continue developing,
even as GDW slid into oblivion.

   This explanation is the one presented in the Vampire Fleets
sourcebook.  I of course expanded upon it somewhat in creating the
description for the remainder of the subsector.

   I\'m glad you enjoyed TTC #10.

   For those of you who are interested in meeting the author of Children
of Earth, I\'ll be at Gen Con this year checking out the Imperium Games
booth and participating at many of the Traveller events.  I hope to see
you there, even if the whole convention is controlled by the Evil Empire
(tm)  (aka TSR).

   Also, someone has pointed out that the 1202 world UWP stats appear
above the 1117 stats, and that in other GDW publications (most notably
the Regency Sourcebook), when dual stat listings were used, that the
1117 stats appeared above the 1201 stats.

   While I apologize if there was confusion on anyone\'s part, this was
an area where I departed from the RSB standard.  IMHO, ergonomically
having the 1202 stat on the same line as the rest of the UWP information
makes it easier to read, particularly if you are interested in what the stats
are *now*, and the 1117 stats are of secondary interest/importance.

   And here we are in the 20th century, some 2000 years later, after
contact (and mixing) with a variety of other human cultures and
races, all with different cultural and historical backgrounds--and yet we
still quote Julius Caesar.  For that matter we still quote Moses, and he
dates back some 3500 years, give or take.

   Discounting ``Sneaks and Geeks``, for apparent reasons, the rest of
the TNE material is no more or less riddled with American references
than say, any of the material published from 1982 to 1992.

>The authors of Traveller may well be late C20 Americans, but then the

   The majority of science-fiction writers produce material that is no more
or less riddled with Anglocentric remarks than Traveller is.  A few, very
good writers have been able to create material that transcends the
limitations placed on us by our background and environment.  The few
very good writers out there do not write for RPGs, at least not for very
long.

   They would, for the same reasons that people in the US and Brazil
have knowledge of Ancient Greece or Egypt.  They might not know all
the particulars, and they probably get some very basic facts wrong,
but they would know that there was this thing called the `United States`
or more likely just `America` on Earth a *long* time ago.

   Fortunately or unfortunately, the United States of America is currently
*the* predominate cultural and political power of Earth, has been since
1945, and will continue to be so well into the 21st century.  After that,
how knows?  But try to find a corner of the planet where you can\'t find
a picture of Walt Disney cartoon  character in someone\'s possession.
Or a rock-n-roll recording.  Or American cigarette (probably being used
as a form of currency).  

   Anyway, the US is the Athens of this era.  While we managed to
defeat our version of Sparta (the USSR), and didn\'t engage it in open
warfare (thank God), because of our status, we will be remembered
for many millennia to come.

   The UK?  ``They were a power that pre-dated America by some years,
in fact the original Americans were UK colonists.  Eventually the
Americans revolted and established their own government.  It wasn\'t
until sometime later, after the Americans increased in power and the UK
began to decline, that the Americans and the UK became friends and
allies against a series of tyrannical enemies that arose on Earth during
the chaotic 20th century.``

   If you were a professor at a university in the Third Imperium and one
of your undergrad students gave that as an answer to the above
question, you would be happy he or she knew so much about that
aspect of ancient history.  You further suspect that the student was
of Solomani heritage.

>There probably would be a few specialised historians who would be
>historians of pre-spaceflight Terra.  But not many.

   We could argue over the numbers, but my guess is that there will be
more pre-spaceflight Terran historians than Old Earth Union historians,
if for no other reason that the pre-spaceflight era was just so darn
interesting in comparison.  World Wars, brink of nuclear holocaust and
all that.  On the other hand, I\'m sure that there will be a much larger
number of Sylean/early Third Imperium historians, as their early history
would be of more relevance to modern Imperials.

>The average Imperial historian would be much more interested in the
>history of their world, their subsector,their sector, their Imperium, than
>they would be in that of a pre-spaceflight nation on Terra.

   I don\'t disagree here (as noted above), it\'s just that it would appear
from canon that the people of the Third Imperium have empathy for the
nation-state known as America.  If my explanation isn\'t satisfactory,
then there has to be another besides ``it isn\'t possible``.

Harold

Of course, a great deal of information will be lost. The point is
that a great deal of information, especially important things like
great literary works and "accumulated knowledge", will not be lost.

High-density media will virtually guarantee that *somebody* will
take the time to keep a current copy of this data. Also, it makes
it worth your while to take the time to decode old media if there
was a lapse for some reason. Also, if there is lapse (for example
due to a war), people will likely be taking time *afterwards* to
recover a great deal of this "lost information", so the format of
the data will be known anyway.

However, even if you needed to decode a 20th century CD-ROM which
was somehow intact (frozen in dry ice?), it really would not be
*that* hard to do. Analysis under a microscope makes it obvious
that the data is stored as "pits" in a circular fashion. The data
structure can easily be detected by looking for patterns. Even
the 8-bit ASCII character set can be easily determined using some
simple cryptographic methods (the same goes for compressed data,
images, etc). So if you had a copy of Grolier\'s Encyclopedia, you
can at least figure out what *data* is on it. What you do with a
3700-year-old copy of Windows 95 is your problem, though. :-) :-)

  Actually, this is one of the reasons I liked GDW\'s 2300AD so much.  By 
setting things three hundred years in the future, one could logically 
postulate a linkage to present-day culture and political forms, with some 
odd changes (the French as the dominant world power!?).  You\'re right, it 
doesn\'t work as well for TNE.

  I feel the need to disagree, at least with respect to Millieu 0.  It 
has not been long since Europeans (and Americans for that matter) spent a 
large amount of time studying Greek and Roman language and history.  In 
the United States, at least, some degree of mastery of Latin was required 
to enroll in college until the late 19th Century - the rise of 
engineering is really what did that in finally.  I remember being taught 
latin and greek roots in high school so as to prepare for language 
tests, and there are some schools (mostly Catholic ones) that still 
stress latin and greek in their curriculum.

  Why did this situation come about?  Prior to the late 19th Century, 
Roman civilization and Roman civil engineering were in evidence all 
around.  As European societies expanded and organized themselves, they 
did so in the shadow of a Roman empire that had spanned a greater area 
than any one country, and that had moreover managed to build civil works 
(walls, aqueducts, roads) that outmatched anything contemporary society 
could accomplish.

  To my mind, the Syleans are in much the same situation.  As they expand 
to the stars, everywhere they are reminded that they are not the first, 
that the First Imperium and the Rule of Man preceeds them.  Moreover, I 
would imagine that engineers would study old records for a hint on what 
could be done and how to do it.  To my mind, Sylean exploration teams 
would include data-recovery specialists, trained in the operation and 
interpretation of First Imperium records.

  As a result, the history of the First Imperium and the Folks from Terra 
who Ended Their Glorious Rule will probably be a part of the average history
curriculum in Millue 0, or even later.  Of course, by the time period of 
Classic Traveller, much of that history has probably been cut out of the 
curriculum, to make room for the study of all those Emperors of the Flag.

The North Pier is a big building just north of the Loop that houses a
variety of tourist-oriented shops, a food court, a couple of bars, and some
video arcades.  One of the arcades, on the second floor, is devoted to a
virtual reality simulation of Battletech.  You sit in the cockpit of the
battletech machine.  You can race through a mine in a grav speeder, or fight
each other on the surface in battle suits.  Then you can watch it on video.
I didn\'t participate (my reflexes not being what they were twenty or
twenty-five years ago), but saw some good action.  

There are also two very nice and very large miniatures on display. One is a
battletech machine, and the other looks like a grav ore carrier.

One of the things which the MT collapse supplement ("Hard Times" ?) 
pointed out was how many planets are dependent on off-world 
technology or off-world resources. Many TL 6-8 worlds are going to be 
borderline at best when it comes to sustaining their life support 
systems. Many non-agricultural worlds are going to have problems 
supporting themselves (dependent on food imports). Also, many 
low-population planets which lose contact with the local starfaring 
culture are going to be in serious trouble -- think of the problems 
they will have with a limited gene pool (interesting adventure 
scenarios: think of "Deliverance"). Milieu 0 explorers are likely to
find quite a few dead worlds, with ruined settlements.

True, but they might not remember all of this well enough to teach it 
in year 0.  Remember that its been 18-1900 years since the Syleans 
were in contact with Terra at Year 0.  Also, I would suspect the 
emphasis in study for most people is going to be on the period 
beginning with 1st contact for the Terrans, and the Interstellar 
Wars.

Your right here MedicoLegal had some say in how long the information 
was kept after the patient had died. I think it was in the 
neighborhood of seven years because after that time it was difficult 
if not near impossible to sue the hospital. The amount of time 
doesn\'t matter. The point is that people stayed at our facility in 
1826 but no-one there could tell you anything about them because in 
nearly eveyone\'s opinion that information was without value and but it 
cost\'s money (warehouse space) to keep and maintain.

This is true too but how long does information on microfilm last before 
it has to put on another media. Will microfilm last 3700 years or will 
someone have to take the volumes of data that on it and convert it to 
something else every couple of hundred years. Going back to my hospital 
keeping the medical records of people who attended in 1899 isn\'t 
necessary because: They\'re not going to sue and the art of medicine was 
so primitive back then that we don\'t think that we are going to learn 
anything from it. Given that it cost $25.00 / square foot for warehouse 
space (cool and dry to reduce degradation) the business decision is to 
throw that information away. This is model that I think most things will 
go by. It\'s harder to envision this happening to the government and 
historical information but that\'s because over our lifetime the 
Government of the United States is a very stable entity and will perceive 
some value in maintaining its history. Some time after that changes, some 
time after the U.S. Government goes away by whatever means the 
details of the history of this regime will be lost. In 3700 years 
historical scholars will be able to figure out that the United States 
existed and who the president was in 1963. But this information won\'t be 
required reading for every Imperial Citizen and it won\'t be the easiest 
information to find either.

I would moderate my position slightly with regard to milieu zero.  My
original posting was referring to the New Era, and I would stand by
my assertions fully in regard to that.  I do feel that even in Milieu 0 the
history and pop culture of the US would be less important than you
believe.  The twin foundations of \'Western Culture\' have for centuries
been defined as the culture of the Greeks and Romans.  These
cultures are far  more important to our development on this small
world than that of one nation of a balkanised world in an Imperium
of many many others, large numbers of whom owe their culture and
history to the Vilani, not the Solomani.

Even many citizens of the Imperium with Solomani roots will feel that
they owe their allegiance, history and culture to their home planet,
not to where their gene stock originally came from.  We are all
descended from Mitochondrial Eve who bounced about the
Kenyan or Tanzanian plains at some point - how many of us owe
our sense of identity to Africa, rather than the US, UK, Canada or
elsewhere?

Simply because the US is the dominant power, and American pop
culture is to a large extent world culture at the present, doesn\'t mean
that this is what will pass on to our far descendents as representation
of Terran culture.  150 years ago Great Britain was THE dominant
world power, with perhaps greater (certainly more direct) sway over
the world than the US has now.  Now we are a small, reasonably
successful island state, with an international importance that probably
owes more to our past than our present, and a lot of mad cows.

150 years before that the Spanish and the Dutch were major world
powers, etc etc.  I would expect any Terran popular culture which
passes on into the future firstly to be mutated almost beyond
recognition, and secondly to owe its origins to a polyglot, polycultural
world.

I would still argue that any histories of Terra taught to non-specialists
would concentrate on Terra\'s role after first contact, and would be unlikely
to delve into the early presidents of one of its nations (which is where
this thread started).  Of course, future history is probably likely to prove
us all wrong. ("Few 20th century analysts could have predicted the
amazing rise to world domination of the Glorious Belgian Empire, and
the rapid Belgification of global culture..")

Although it\'s not much to go on, there is some evidence that Terran culture
will continue to have a major influence on Imperial culture as a whole.  The
official language of the Imperium, and one that is spoken and understood by
all starfarers (and a majority of it\'s citizens, at least according to all
available evidence) is "Galanglic" - a descendant of modern English.

How close Galanglic is to English is debatable, but from the available
evidence (not much, unfortunately) modern English is at least as
understandable to Imperials as Chaucer is to present-day readers.

On the other hand, Great Britain has had a large influence on the cultural
background of all of the English-speaking countries of the world.
Shakespeare, Dickens, Conan-Doyle, Gilbert and Sullivan.  The King James
version of the bible, even.   By the time of the Imperium, perhaps old
Terran works will be more a matter of curiosity (and modern
"interpretations") than popular culture - on the other hand, there are
several different copies of Beowulf in print right now!

It\'s a known fact that at least some of CS Lewis\' works survive into the
world of Traveller - because that\'s the origin of the term "Aslan" for a
certain race of aliens.  I can\'t imagine that Tolkien (for example), will
ever go out of print, and I\'m sure that others can think of a long list of
other works that will remain in print for as long as there are people to
read them.  While perhaps not so politically important, culturally the
influence extends as far as the English language.

So, I can see a lot of reason for there to be influences from current
popular culture - on the other hand, I think those influences should be
subtle and not overdone (and it\'s very easy to over-do this).

True.  Many people may quote (or misquote..) Julius Caesar, albeit some
without realising it.  That is not necessarily the same as knowing the
history of the Roman Empire.  And I\'m sure that many people are
familiar with the characters from the bible without knowing much about
the history of the Middle East.  But don\'t forget that we\'re all on the one
planet here - would someone who has been living on one of thousands
of other worlds whose ancestry is maybe predominantly Vilani be as
interested?

I\'d agree that this is possible.  My original posting was in response to

I wouldn\'t argue with that either.  It\'s just that I believe that the US is 
a
great power among many, preceded by some, undoubtedly
followed by others.  In a believable science-fiction setting many
years in the future I\'d expect to see a culture influenced by many, or
at least several of these powers, rather than one.

Alas, the fate of a once proud nation.  To be considered only as
a footnote to the colonization of the US.  I\'d give the student an F

If any historian of pre-spaceflight Terra was examining remaining archives
of the first primitive computer networks and found somebody\'s copies
of the TML they\'d get a shock.  Nostradamus wouldn\'t have a patch on
us.

If canon is what is produced by GDW then canon states that after the
introduction of the Virus (see flame wars passim for arguments about
its unfeasibility) multi-mega-credit sophisticated FTL spaceships
were flung into the mathematically and topographically complexities
of j-space and emerged at their destinations parsecs away by crew
members shouting Red Thirteen Blue Four down the Far Future
equivalent of speaking tubes to each other...

I wouldn\'t say that the people of an 11,000 world sociologically
complex state some three thousand years in the future (with a
mix of ancestry that includes Vilani as well as Solomani) having
a particular empathy for the 20th century nation state of the US
was impossible.  I would say that the likelihood of it puts many
of the arguments about the likelihood or not of the physics behind
much of the Traveller technology into the shade.

I don\'t intend any disrespect to the US or any of its citizens on the
mailing list by my arguments.  I think maybe being British gives me
quite a good perspective of the transience of power and cultural
dominance...

I don\'t think pre-starfaring Terra would be taught as "history\'" at all. It
would
be taught as an entirely different subject, the 57thC equivilent of Classics
or Antiquities, perhaps even Archeology.
What is taught as history tends to break down into three major groupings:
    1) Local history - i.e. a child on Regina will learn of the colonisation of
Regina, the development of the colony, how it\'s social systems evolved etc.
    2) Case studies - These are studies of how other cultures have dealt with
common problems. Thus in high school in New Zealand I studied the history
of Ireland as a case study in conflict.
    3) Background history - This is basically local history given a deeper and
wider coverage. Thus our Regina school child might learn of the colonisation
of the Spinward Marches, the development of the Imperium, the social changes
brought about by the Civil War etc.

Almost all of what is taught before tertiary level is either local history or
case studies. Obviously, unless the history is being taught on or near
Terra, local history will not concern itself with Terra. Case studies tend
to restrict themsleves to the previous 100-200 years so as to remain
culturally relevant.

So this leaves only background history to concern itself with 20thC Terra.
However I don\'t think it would. Background history concentrates on how
past trends have influenced modern culture. The Long Night provides a
logical break, much as the fall of the Western Roman Empire does now
to act as a starting point for History.

Here I disagree. While I would think that the study of 20thC Terra (and the
Terran Confederation, Rule of Man and Ziru Sirka) would not be classified
as history. I think 19thC and 20thC Terra would be quite a popular period
to cover. Primarily because of the rapid rate of change during this period. One
only has to look at the rate of technological change, from TL3 to TL8 in
200 years whereas the Imperium has only managed from TL12 to TL15 in
over 1000 years.

I also think that 20thC Terran history would be widely though very very
superficially know in the 57thC. Since it would not be history as such, it would
be free from the political overtones that invariably go with "history". It would
have become as much a part of their pop culture as classical Greece and
Rome have of ours (Can just see the holo series now "The legendary
adventures of J.F.K." or even "Maggie Thatcher, Warrior Princess").

Hm. Well, as I was re-reading \'Solomani\' last night... The Syleans
were largely of Solomani origin. Sylea was one of the final capitals
of the Rule of Man, thus justifying Cleon\'s formation of the Third
Imperium.

Anyhow, \'Solomani\' states that a large part of the Imperial Nobility
and most of it\'s Naval Officers of the Flag are _pure Solomani_.
Even in 5700+AD they can still trace their heritage back to Terra
for _every single ancestor_!!! If they\'re this obsessed about
racial purity in the very diverse 3rd Imperium, in the 58th century,
they must still be pretty hot to trot for Terran history. Heck,
even the Emperors were pure Solomani until the mid 600\'s when one
of them married a Viliani woman. Under the Rule of Man, Viliani
nobles took Solomani names to fit in better with the new power structure.
No doubt the Viliani, who loooove all things old, all brushed up
on their Terran history in an interesting blend of cultures.

I think the Rule of Man, short though it was, left a pretty considerable
mark on the universe. Traveller is maybe more Terran-centric
than we think...

America. Considering the distances and lack of instant communication (FTL
Radio) I think it\'s diversity would be similar to the period western
expansion from 1850-1900 A.D.. 
 Example: Many Germans settled in the area of Milwaukee, with them they
brought their language, culture and politics. They had a common language of
English with Americans outside of Milwaukee, but in Milwaukee, among their
own community, they still spoke German. The only reason German culture has
been reduced in influence is it\'s direct exposure to American Culture (The
Mix) for an extended and continuous period of time. 
 Now imagine if Milwaukee was a planet on the fringe of the Imperium. Changes
in the Imperium; Styles, entertainment, and Ganglic slang would take a year
at minimum to work it\'s way out to the Isolated planet of Milwaukee. 
 The Isolation then becomes more then distance, it becomes cultural.
Milwaukee ends up building it\'s culture that is based on their German orgins,
other planets nearby, a slight Imperial Influence and on what they need to
develop in the face of changes on the local level (Events and Environment).
This being true for 11,000 seperate systems, I would think that only a
handful universal cultural characteristics would exist in the Imperium unlike
the nearly universal cultural characteristics in the U.S..

An alternate explanation exists: I believe "Aslan" is Turkish for "lion" 
(or so Loren Wiseman explained, IIRC).  A quick Web search via Altavista
turns up Ismail Aslan, assistant head of the (pro-Kurdish) Turkish People\'s
Democracy Party, and a Turkish librarian named Huryasa Aslan, so it\'s
certainly a regionally correct name.  We already know that many ethnic
types from Earth strove mightily to preserve non-Anglic language and
cultures.  So I don\'t see anything odd with a far-future Turk being one
of the first-out scouts spinward from Terra at first contact.

The \'different squints\' method is quite okay today - eyetracking as a computer
input is what my PhD thesis was about. Just look at an icon to activate it,
none of this keyboard business. Of course there are still problems, but I won\'t
bore you all with a diatribe on them here. :)

Interestingly enough, speech therapists are beginning to see a new problem
being refered to them. People are arriving with voice strain due to operating
speech recognition systems. Think of it this way, if you\'re operating a computer
by speech alone, you\'re putting vour voice to under a lot of stress, using it
far more than normal, so it starts to cause problems. And what do you do if
you lose your voice? How do you operate your machine then?

Overall I think that we\'re still likely to have keyboards of some sort, although
not the qwerty design we\'re used to at present. Intelligent predictive
systems will minimise the amount of typing that needs to be done, but the
fingers will still be the main input medium.

but suffice it to say that a kind of Dennis Potter \'Cold Lazarus\'

it were their own memory blah blah etc. Benefits listed are: advancement
over \'crude\' speech and writing communication forms, easier teaching
methods, enhanced memories for sufferers of Alzheimer\'s Disease, and
less possibility of thieves & rapists escaping justice if a record of

intact, and I suspect that somebody used it a few times to run the 
campaign, then resold it...

My intention is to put it up for auction.  I am not here to rape 
people though, so I intend to conduct the auction in the following 
manner:

1) I will be accepting 1 bid and 1 bid only from each person!  Make 
your first bid the most you would be willing to pay for this 
wonderful campaign...

2) Minimum bid shall be $10 US (which is what I paid for it...)  Bids 
shall be taken in $1 intervals only.  If you don\'t want to pay $10, don\'t 
bother sending e-mail to me...

3) Bids will not include shipping.  US customers can expect $3 for 
priority mail, maybe slightly less if book rate or something of that nature.  
International customers, I\'d need to find out at a later time.

4) Payment may be by money order, or check (US customers only).  
Money orders I\'ll ship out as soon as I receive them, checks will 
wait 2 weeks to clear...

5) All bids should be sent to me at: 
sdollar@goodnet.com

Please include the word \'auction\' in the subject line...so that my 
mail filter will send it to the right place...  

For the sake of bandwidth, absolutely NO bids will be accepted 
that are sent to the mailing list...

6) I reserve the right to change or modify the rules to this auction 
at any time...(but it would be very unlikely for me to do so)

7) Bids shall be accepted until a week from Saturday, July 27, 1996...

8) In the unlikely event of a tie, I will e-mail the parties 
involved

Don\'t be too literal -- "Saint Elvis of Terra" could refer to an  
entirely different person by that name such as: 
 
Elvis Larson, founder of the Society for True Humanity, 
a spiritual/self-improvement movement popular during the period 
of the Nth Interstellar Wars. Depending on the local activists, 
the movement was part religion, part philosophy, and part scam. 
The scams died out, the philosophy was absorbed into later 
movements, and the religious aspects fragmented and formed the 
basis for numerous local religions throughout the Solomani 
Sphere and regions of Solomani expansion (including the Imperium). 
Many of the religious sects canonized Larson as "Saint Elvis". 
Due to the fragmented nature of the religion, local practices 
vary in the extreme, often quite contradictory to practices 
on other worlds.

Ah, now then (he says, finally delurking about nothing to do directly with
Trav at all. Tsk. Typical.), a few years ago I saw a televison item about an
airline that was experimenting with a voice recognition system to handle
telephone bookings. It was doing very well taking the booking details during
a demonstration until, as an experiment, the caller deliberately sneezed
violently. There was a pause and then the computer blithely booked the
flight for Tuesday.

The problem is, there are *very* few games (especially successful ones)
that *really* use a different culture. Most players *do* play those
other cultures as being just "our" culture, perhaps with a few rules
changed. 

So at least the "core" culture needs to be familiar. For the other
cultures, the problem becomes detailing them. Look at what it takes to
detail a culture such as Tekumel, Glorantha, or whatever.

While I don\'t have a definitive answer, I rather suspect that microfilm
is *at least* as durable as paper, if not more so. Given "reasonable"
storage conditions, the means of degradation I see as most likely are:

1. oxidation (*very* slow, acetate film is damn stable)
2. migration of dye (the "dye" that the film uses may slowly migrate
   over time)
3. adhesion/bonding (the adjacent pieces of film may adhere if kept in
   contact long enough)

I\'m guessing that these would be stable over 500-1000 year periods. And
given that they were incorporated in some deliberate "time capsules", I
suspect that they are thought to be good for even longer.

Of course, if the data is on microfiche it\'ll take up a *lot* less
space. You get what? 200 pages per fiche?

Barring some *major* disaster, I think that newspapers and magazines
(on microfiche) will survive in the libraries. And given the interest
that sociologists and even anthropologists show in stuff that\'s only a
hundred or so years old, I expect that the data will be converted to
"modern" storage every so often. If only by research assistants to a
person doing his Phd on "sports trends in the United States of America
(19th through 24th cent.)"

They\'ll be able to read Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, The London
Times, etc for the whole of their existence.

Depends. I rather expect that any of it that has been converted to
"modern" storage will be readily available *if* you care to look.
"Periodicals, Terran, 20th century, nation, ....."

And given the sheer *number* of scholars needing *something* to do
research on, I rather expect that much of the data will be converted to
"modern" storage formats. I also expect that much of the conversion
will have been done by scanning the originals, and then using text
recognition algorithms on the scans. Which could lead to some
interesting errors untill and unless someone *familiar* with the
language of the period compares the scan and the "text" extracted from
it. Ditto for what will happen to images digitized at the wrong
resolution (you would not *believe* what can happen to a halftoned
image if scanned at the "right" wrong resolution)

   Fair enough, and as I cannot currently read the author\'s mind, nor have
engaged him in conversation about the subject, you could be right.

   But, when one evokes the name Elvis, no last name, just Elvis, it is
assumed you\'re talking about Elvis Presley--not Elvis Grbeck of the
American football San Francisco 49ers, or Elvis Costello, rock-n-roll
star.  You could say that when a 57th century person hears the name
they immediate think of the religious leader, but remember that the author
is writing for 20th century readers while pretending to be writing for
ones in the 57th century.  To use Elvis\' name in that manner while
making reference to someone else entirely would be confusing.

   If I\'m not mistaken, isn\'t there a St. Elvis of Terra reference in ``Survival
Margin`` that quotes a line from the song ``Suspicious Minds``?  I\'m pretty
sure there is.

Harold

Let me be clear: "Elvis Larson" is my own invention of 
who Strephon was talking about. 
 
_DAve Nilsen_ was obviously referencing Presley, but it was  
opaque enough that one could "switch Elvi" and create 
a fictional person that _Strephon_ was referring to as 
"Saint Elvis of Terra" if one balked at the notion of 
Presley being a noted person in the 57th C.

Actually, a J-torp doesn\'t need to be NEARLY that large.  That 15 ton figure includes fuel,
controls, power plant, and just about everything needed to have a miniature little starship.  For
not much more, you could add crew, a fixed mount weapon, and a little bunk: PRESTO you have
a miniature little jump capable fighter craft.  Someone ought to design one of these, just for kicks.
:) Sort of the Traveller version of the X-Wing fighter.

But a J-torp needn\'t be nearly this complex.

All you need is a little computer and a jump drive.  No power plant or fuel is needed.  The drive\'s
capacitors are charged by the launching vessel, which also imparts inertia to the torp through its
launching mechanism.  Once it reaches it comes in-system at the target location, it can sit around
like a little Nav buoy and wait to be picked up by dedicated tender vessels.  The end result is a
replacement of the generic X-boat courier line with unmanned J-torp message couriers.

A device like this would have tons of drawbacks.  For military courier use, its basically worthless
since its unsecure and not tactical (bad idea to send one of these to communicate with someone
hiding in an enemy system).  They\'d be nice for launching as a log buoy in the event of some
catastrophic emergency on the starship.  The sheer size of one of these things (still in the 5-10 ton
range) means that only larger vessels are likely to carry any at all, particularly since the launching
mechanism has to be custom designed into the starship as well.  Only the larger ships of the line
are likely to carry more than a small handful (2-4) of these things.  Like the X-boat, J-torps
require dedicated tender vessels to care for them.  Just about anything with a cargo bay might
concievably pick up one of the things, and maintenance could be done in the cargo bay, but
getting the thing back into its launcher tube would be tricky, and best performed in port (unless
you\'re a tender, cu!
 stom designe
   d for the mission of
 launching and retrieving drone J-torps.

Without much extra work, a drone could be designed that has just enough of a robotic brain to
fire some simple thrusters and home in on a target planet.  Designed with an airfoil, some terminal
guidance software, and a little turbine engine all you need is a warhead to create a J-Tomahawk
cruise missile.  Such nightmarish devices could (in sufficient numbers) be the scourge and plague
of inhabited systems throughout the universe.  Of course the only reason those goofy Vampire
Fleets don\'t just annihilate all human life in the former Imperium is because they don\'t have the
manufacturing capability to produce such weapons, since Imperial shipyards all conform to the
100ton limit.  Still, 100tons of automated Scout/Courier hell could carry one enormous fusion
warhead (strip fuel, vehicle, and crew space, charge Jump capacitors externally, and fill all
remaining space with one incredible bomb).

Hmm . . . does anyone remember Darkstar?  :)

     Um, well...no.  It\'s not.  Not by a long shot.  I work at a data
center that, among other things, does COM (Computer Originated Microfilm
[and fiche]).  We recently got some ten-year-old fiche in to be
duplicated (masters are archived--duplicates are used for everyday
access), and they were almost unusable.  Decayed to the point that they
had to be babied by hand through the duplicator.  We eventually got
decent duplicates, but the quality was very poor.  And that\'s after only
ten years.

 >1. oxidation (*very* slow, acetate film is damn stable)

     It certainly is--too bad acetate isn\'t used for microfilm or fiche.
It\'s 15-mil (average) polymer (at least, the Kodak film we use--the
Diazo dupe film is slightly thicker).

 >2. migration of dye (the "dye" that the film uses may slowly migrate
 >   over time)

     This isn\'t a problem--the film is old-fashioned silver wet-
processed.  Modern photographic dyes aren\'t used.  We even run our used
chemicals through a silver recovery unit--enough there to be worth the
effort.

 >3. adhesion/bonding (the adjacent pieces of film may adhere if kept in
 >   contact long enough)

     This doesn\'t take very long, depending on the quality of the newly-
made masters.  If they\'re packaged together wet, they stick together
within *minutes*.  If they\'re properly dry, they should be okay for 15
years or so.  It depends on the storage environment.

 >I\'m guessing that these would be stable over 500-1000 year periods.

     If that\'s the case, then I\'d suspect that the stuff used in time
capsules was produced specially for that use.  Regular film won\'t last
anywhere *near* that long.

     Depends on the magnification used.  Up to 400 with a 72x lens.

     But, I\'ve probably just given out more information on fiche than
anyone would want.  ;-)

Weird, I have stuff close to *20* years old, and it\'s showing no signs
of degradation. I suspect that the company "cheaped out" on the media
and used the stuff intended for applications like daily info listings,
instead of the stuff intended for archival use.

Some of it uses an aniline dye process. The "grain size" is the

Like I said, I *know* that there is microfilm (and microfiche) that
lastys a *lot* longer than the stuff you are using. Libraries would
*not* be happy if their microfilmed newspapers and magazines only
lasted 15 years!

I happen to be more aware than most of the ins & outs of
microfilm/microfiche as I stumbled across a fiche reader for $5 and a
microfilming camera (feed in sheets of paper) for $15 back around 1975
in a secondhand store.

I gotta get the camera serviced one of these days, but it\'s almost
certainly a missing screw and it costs $90/hr just to bring it thru the
door of the local Kodak service center!

We were taught that the rough duration of archival-quality microfilm was
300 years or so, if stored in the right conditions.  Acid-free paper will
last for more than a thousand years (we\'ve got paper that old).
Parchment will last longer (we\'ve got books dating back to the 3rd and 4th
centuries AD; no reason it shouldn\'t last a few centuries more).

Modern computer media (disks, etc.) is too new to have much experience
with yet; I suspect that much of it will be gone within a century, if
not within mere decades.  Lack of reading machinery is probably a more
pressing problem (there are _two_ machines in existence today that 
can read the 1960 U.S. census data tapes.)  OTOH, if you made a CD-ROM
out of pure aluminum instead of plastic-and-aluminum it might well
last for centuries, if not millenia.

If you really want long-term storage, though, carve your words in 
granite, or put them on baked clay tablets.  Pottery is virtually
indestructible (OK, it\'ll shatter, but the fragments will stay
around), unless you physically destroy it (as in, grind to 
powder.)  Stone tablets, likewise.  

In the Far Future, this means that the past history of most planets
can be learned by archaeologists up until the point when they
gotinto the Plastic Age...

     Well, again, no.  The company didn\'t.  "Archival quality" is one of
the buzzwords.  Also, the equipment we use is some of the best in the
industry (the XFP-2000--stick data in one end, get collated fiche out
the other).  What really matters is the photo developing chemicals.  If
the chemicals are fresh, then you get archival quality fiche that last a
*lot* longer than average.  If the chemicals are overly used, then the
quality suffers quite a bit.

     Also, there isn\'t any difference between "daily info listings" and
"archival use."  Same film, same chemicals, same processing.

     We also produce CD-ROM disks, which are a great deal more useful
than fiche.  The only reason that our customers still want fiche is that
the fiche aren\'t alterable once made (without it being noticable), so
they meet legal requirements for records retention.

     Doesn\'t say polyester on the label--I\'d have to call Kodak to get
any more detailed information.  I might do that--they *do* have an 800
number...

     You probably have the luxury of using fresh chemicals all the time,
then.  We\'re in production 24 hours a day, and have to run as fast as
we can just to stay in place.

     That\'s actually quite reasonable--our field service department
charges $150.00/hour (double that for off shift service calls).  Even
if the equipment comes in to us.

One of the *big* problems is that the media only holds those differing
domains for so long. They tend to "blur" around the edges after a
while. Which is why tricks like using DD media for HD are a bad idea.

Another *major* problem is the binder used to hold the ferrite
particles to the plastic. Some of those fail all too easily. A friend
had a BBS that in the early 80s used the floppy drive *heavily* (it was
essentially an online text editor, and the text was stored one line per
128 byte sector). He found that some brands of floppy failed in a
matter of *hours* on his system. He kept one of the worst examples. It
has large patches where you can *see* through the clear plastic because
*all* the coating came off!

Personally, I have a 3.5 few disks that are unreadable because the
media was *glued* to the metal hub, and the glue failed!

It\'s not just the drives. I can find lots of drives that\'ll handle 5.25
DSSD and DSDD media. But the *format* can be a problem. Try finding
software that can let your PC read the disks created by my Model 100
DVI. They are "normal" 5.25 DSDD disks, 40 track, 18 256 byte sectors
per track. But just *try* getting from there to the directory and file
structure. :-)

And forget the *single* density disks. Many of the floppy controllers
out there can\'t read single density anymore. Forget trying to figure
out the format, you can\'t even get the *bits* off the media.

As for the kind of thing you mention, I bet that in 15 years you\'ll
have to hunt to find a ZIP drive.

Or just use micro-lithography to copy them onto silicon wafers. At
micron level lithography, you could use a 5x7 character matrix (add one
dot "space" between characters both horizontally and vertically to get
6x8 "cells")  and that gives you a bit over 20 *billion* characters per
cm^2. And they too will endure for a *long* time. And one of the things
that has come out of semiconductor research is the ability to coat
things with a layer of *diamond*. That\'ll protect the surface nicely.

And like your stone tablets, these with last a *long* time.

I\'d arrange a long term archive with some sort of "plates" of something
durable with incised or etched text. They\'d explain how to read the
next level of archives, which would be "microfilm" sized text and
pictures on something like artificial diamond "grown" around the text.
The next level would be the micron level stuff. And if we ever come up
with a *stable* means of storing data more densely than that, we can
have a fourth level. But we *could* do the first three levels now.

     "Tonight on _It\'s The Mind_...." 
     -- 

Ever since I saw "Total Recall" I\'ve thought that I had to write a RPG 
adventure sometime that explored the issue of "who am I?".  There was a 
Babylon 5 episode recently (well, recently in the UK) where a monk started 
having nightmares about terrible murders.  It turned out that he had 
committed the murders before being caught and having his personality 
suppressed - he now didn\'t *know* he\'d murdered anyone.  Relatives of the 
victims had hired a psionic to break down the memory suppression, so that 
he would realise what terrible crimes he had committed before one of the 
relatives killed him.  After the monk had been killed, the relative that 
did it was also given a mind wipe, and ended up joining the same religious 
order, since they now had a "vacancy".
It was all done much better than I have described, especially the scene  at 
the end of the episode where the Captain (who was friendly with the monk) 
meets the murdering relative after his mind wipe and has to be reminded 
that he was no worse than his friend, the monk.

Of course, I\'ve never gotten round to writing a scenario on this theme, 
though I did write one on "AI" based on ideas from Bladerunner.  Actually, 
it was a fantasy adventure where a magically animated wooden doll was being 
hunted down by its creator to be destroyed, because the "experiment" hadn\'t 
quite worked right.  The players became involved initially to try and stop 
the damage this doll was doing in the market, but ended up with them having 
to decide whether to give up their captive to its creator.

Oops, I\'ve written a bit more than I meant to, but this is one of my 
favourite subjects.

Cheers,
Liam

*** Nowhere Man spoiler ***


Am I losing e-mail again, or has nobody compared this to Nowhere Man
yet? Somehow I ended up watching most of the last season finale, even
though I\'d only seen 1-1/2 other episodes.

For those that don\'t know the story, the premise of Nowhere Man is
that the government has erased this man\'s identity and completely
covered everything up. He remembers things from the past, but there
is no evidence that it ever happened. In the last season finale,
they explained everything and it was completely different from what
you were being led to believe. The star apparently was a government
agent in an agency that had the capability of completely replacing
people (faces, memories, and all). He had built this personality
and history for himself and it was never real.

There are many ways this could go. Did he do it to test the limits
of the technology, as has been suggested? Was he forced into it?
Did he intend all along to subvert the agency, but this was the
only way they\'d let him out? All three? Does he have an entirely
different personality from before he became/was made into a spy?

So Tom Vail is/was a government agent who tried to retire from the
  Mysterious Agency?

*sigh*  The "creators" of this series seem to have given up any
  pretense of not STEALING the entire concept of the show from the
  much praised British series "The Prisoner".  Instead of being
  locked away in the Village, Vail is locked outside of normal
  society.

I\'ve noticed the similarity since the pilot episode, but what really
  made me groan was one scene where Tom is in a lineup, and they\'re
  told to count off... he, of course, winds up with Number Six.

Go watch "The Prisoner."  It\'s original.  It\'s better.

ObTraveller:  As noted in a now out-of-print GURPS worldbook for the
  setting, the Village of "The Prisoner" can be dropped into almost
  any genre of campaign.  However, it should probably be kept to a
  brief guest appearance, as one of the themes of the series (the
  futility of escape from the prison) will wear VERY thin on your
  typical players after a while.

I was asked this once by a player and absolutely horrified him with my
response.  I told him that, every week, a book full of plot ideas was
dropped on my doorstep.

Going to the television, I picked up the program listing and proceeded
to read the "one line" synopsis of movies playing that week.  After
finding one that "felt right" I proceeded to warp the description by
substituting characters and events in the game for the stars and
elements of the movie.

For example, for the Superhero game I was running at the time:
    STAR WARS: Old wise man tells young farmer he is heir of fallen
    hero.  The boy joins the rebellion and helps beautiful rebel
    princess attack overwhelming Imperial battle-station.

    Hmmm... Let\'s start with the "new weapon" for the bad guys.
    Maybe someone discovers Soulweaver\'s old base on the moon.
    Someone that knows enough to use what they find, but not
    enought to be to subtle.  Sounds like a job for Ravenwing. Now
    we need a "fallen hero," preferably one connected to the
    Liberty (the PC hero group) that has "gone bad," since *we*
    know what happened to the fallen hero in STAR WARS.  How about
    this "Lion" guy from the Rhodesian Super-SWAT team?.  Oops, no,
    he\'s dead.  Hmmm...  Double Hmmm... even better.  We can turn
    the "father of farm boy" into "mentor of young super" and make
    Thunderbird (PC and member of Liberty, ex-member of the
    Rhodesian Super-SWAT team) central to this plot.  We need
    someone to find out about Ravenwing and bring the information
    to Liberty.  Perhaps a daughter or grand-daughter of one of the
    Rhodesians.  Ur... Teufulhund (Note: Need to look up "Devil
    Dog" in German or whatever it is they speak in South Africa) a
    beautiful young girl that knows of Thunderbird.

    OK, how\'s this.  Ravenwing and Co. find Soulweaver\'s lair on
    the Moon.  They discover something that makes them Too Powerful
    and they start trouncing their enemies, possibly including
    Liberty.  (Scenario #1:  Ravenwing attacks) Teufulhund brings
    information about the source of Ravenwing\'s new abilities to
    our heroes, perhaps Ravenwing is "mopping up" her mother\'s
    super-team and she comes to Thunderbird for help.  I wonder
    what TBird\'s wife will say, not only about the beautiful young
    girl that has attached herself to TBird, but about his
    ..unseemly..  past?  (Scenario #2: Ugly past and Untimely
    Angst)  Eventually, our heroes will contact enough folks and
    dig up enough Power or Subtlety to confront Ravenwing.
    (Scenario #3 & #4: Figuring out what is going on and beating up
    the bad guys.) Sometime during these last two, Liberty
    discovers that Ravenwing is being helped by Daedalus, the
    Master Planner, who is actually TBird\'s old leader, Lion. (The
    rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.) Oh! The
    Horror! :-)

There is at least six sessions (six to eight weeks) of gaming in this,
and all the gross plotting was just done off the top of my head, and
took about fifteen minutes.  Do one more, weave the plots around each
other, and you have almost six months of general plot line ready.

While this is a superhero scenario, I could have just as easily started
with any other movie in the book and warped the story elements into a
science fiction game.  I\'ve done it before, and you can too.  And it
Really, Really works... :-)

Hope this helps...

Now that\'s one I never thought of. Heck, you could pick up one of those 
huge "TV Movie Guides" that have thousands of movie synopses, and have 
enough plots to draw for the rest of your life. 

Nicely done!  Thanks for posting that.

Oh thank God!  I was afraid I was the only total fanboy around here who did 
things like that.  I plan on using the dogtags to frighten people once I\'ve 
almost convinced them that RPGs are not a bad thing.  Of course, _I_ still have 
my original GI Joe Club dogtags from 1969.

I\'ve been thinking about this issue a lot since Bruce first brought it up (and 
even earlier, when I was submitting and resubmitting ship designs).  I really 
HOPE the rules set is solid.  I have a strong suspiscion that the starship 
combat portion will be the weakest part, and will probably be the second thing 
I toss from my own campaign (the first thing being range bands.  _Range Bands_, 
for heavens sake!  I have never played Traveller with a group that did not 
ditch range bands as soon as the playing started.

I am looking at this a bit more philosophically.  There were two sections of 
the original 3-book rules that were basically lame, and that I quickly replaced 
with my own systems; personal combat and starship combat.  In both cases, GDW 
later came out with a better system that I adopted (Azhanti High Lightning and 
High Guard, respectively).  I know for a fact there is a plan to come out with 
advnaced (presumably better) starship rules later.  I strongly suspect that the 
combat rules will either be something I can modify to suit my needs, or that 
Imperium Games will come out with a compatible but better system later (perhaps 
in JTAS).  If it comes right down to it, I\'ll cook up my own system and submit 
that to JTAS.

I\'m like Joe in this; I want IG to succeed so bad it hurts.  I was looking 
through some old Space Gamer issues over the weekend (garage cleaning day - I\'m 
keeping the magazines).  One thing that really struck me was the fact that 
EVERY issue had one, two or even more Traveller articles.  There were other 
gaming magazines in the pile also, ones I did not subscribe to but bought 
individually, and all of them had Traveller stuff also.  This was a very 
respectable stack; maybe 100 magazines in all.  For whatever reason, that level 
of fan commitment stopped, and I truly think that more than anything else 
_that_ is what killed GDW\'s Traveller.

So, I have made my own personal pledge.  Starting this week, I intend to submit 
something once per month to JTAS.  In fact, I already made this month\'s 
submission; mailed it yesterday.  Rob Miracle says we have more than 500 TML 
members.  If only 10% of you do the same thing, IG will be getting 50 
submissions per month.  Even if they only accept 10% of what is submitted, 
there would be 10 JTAS articles by TML members in every bimonthly issue.  Look 
at some of the _REALLY_ cool stuff that hits the TML.  The RICE Papers.  The 
ship designs.  The adventure ideas.  Even some of the "throwaway" comments like 
the one a few months back about the fate of Lucan - forced to live forever by 
his robotic servants and tortured with undying agony.  Even some the technical a
rguments that show up here could make good material; the infamous RockDropper 
thread, summarized into a 4-page article, would provide a wealth of information 
for players and GMs.  The bio-warfare stuff Bruce Johnson did.  The 
Majesta-class ship and background history (was that Alvin Plummer?).  And so on.

Look at the Imperium Games website for submission information.  I think Andy 
Lilly\'s BITS site has the information as well.  If you are not web-capable, 
write to IG and JTAS to get submission information.  Hey, if you\'re really 
ambitious, ask them for guidelines for submitting an entire adventure or 
supplement.  And remember also that IG and JTAS are not the only fish in the 
sea.  To really make Traveller thrive we need to get it exposed in some of the 
"general-purpose" gaming magazines.  I know Dragon is now a TSR-only organ, but 
what about some of the others.  And of course, there are a lot of really good 
"indie" Traveller magazines out there; Traveller material in those magazines 
might be "preaching to the choir" in terms of expanding Traveller\'s popularity, 
but support of any kind is what makes games grow.

OK, I\'ll get down off my pulpit now.  I just want the new Trav to stay around, 
grow tremendously and piss off TSR and people like Phil Pugliese.  I want it to 
be something we can both enjoy and participate in.  Think of this as something 
like an election:  If You Don\'t Vote (or write), Don\'t Bitch

This is a temporary state.  We all are waiting on T4.  IG and MM arn\'t
dropping discussion topics in that spawned a lot of discussion like some of
the earlier threads.

I suspect that about the time GenCon ends (maybe a little earlier when
people rush to GenCon to get their T4 book and leave to come back and do a
review) we will see a sharp increase in traffic.

I couldn\'t figure out how to use the d*mned things when I first got 
Traveller.   So, I came up with my own system.  (Meaning, your theory 
holds true in my case.)

Huh.  I agree on the starship combat note, but I love the personal 
combat rules.  They are perfect for the way I like to run combat.  But 
then, I\'m not into detailed combat.  I just want it quick-n-deadly.

That\'s the attitude! :)  Perfect.

I\'ve read a theory that what made the original D&D so great was that it 
was broken.  That is, each group had to puzzle it out for themselves, 
designing rules and whatnot since the game was severely lacking in 
elegance and detail (excusable, since it was the first of its kind).  
Perhaps, as Traveller grew and expanded, the lack of areas for unofficial 
expansion had something to do with declining usage as well as the other 
well-known reasons.

Good points, all.  I\'m certainly willing to submit material once I have 
the game in my hands.

Both are from the latest issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology.

1) The loss of Ariane 5 was caused by a software error in the intertial
   guidance units.  The units had been used in Ariane 4 without problems,
   and were installed in the new rocket without modification.

   The problem turns out to be twofold: A calculation which is needed when
   the rocket is on the ground was continued in flight for 40 seconds (the
   data is not needed or used in flight).  During this 40 seconds, the
   value overflowed (became too large for to calculate), causing an error
   indication.

   The error indication was assumed to be a hardware failure, and the
   guidance unit was automatically taken off-line (and began sending
   diagnostic data to the flight controls, instead of guidance data).  The
   backup guidance unit was identical, and failed in an identical fashion
   slightly before the main unit.

   The value never overflowed when the units were used in Ariane 4 because
   the older rocket flew a different trajectory (which kept the values
   within bounds for the first 40 seconds of flight).  Because the unit
   worked in a large number of Ariane 4 flights, it wasn\'t extensivelu
   tested for Ariane 5.

2) An Airbus plane being flown by Chineese pilots was lost due to the
   combination of poor training and software faults.  At low altitude in
   a landing, the co-pilot accidentally triggered the automatic throttle\'s
   "go-around" lever (this causes the throttle and autopilot to perform an
   automatic abort so that the plane can go around and try landing again.

   The pilot instructed the co-pilot to disengage the automatic throttle,
   and - since the plane was now off the glide-slope for landing - engage
   the automatic pilot to get back on glide-slope.

   The automatic pilot was in "go-around" mode (because the lever was hit
   by the co-pilot).  As the plane\'s nose came higher and higher (for the
   go-around) the pilot and co-pilot began fighting the autopilot.  As they
   pushed the nose down with the elevator, the autopilot brought it up with
   the trim controls.  Eventually, the aircraft stalled at low altitude.

   Almost any other aircraft would not have crashed in this condition; they
   automatically disengage the autopilot when the pilot moves the controls
   a significant amount.  The Airbus doesn\'t, on the theory that the pilot
   might accidentally move the control column during an automatic landing
   and cause a crash.  The Airbus also doesn\'t have a warning when the
   autopilot adjusts the trim.
   

How does this apply to Traveller?  Well, item 1 could apply to almost any
piece of computer-controlled gadgetry (even gadgetry that worked fine
before, as in this example) on a new starship, or when any ship is operated
in conditions that it\'s designers never experienced.

Item 2 could certainly apply to high-tech spacecraft, where (as in the
Airbus) the autopilot\'s programmers think they know better than the pilot
does what the aircraft should be doing.

Think of it not as a rip-off, but... an "h\'omage". :)

The Prisoner is pretty popular among the TV-literate (god, what
a concept). For instance, there\'s an episode on Babalyon 5 where
Garabaldi meets an old enemy (or something like that) and when
Garabaldi leaves the room, the bad guy goes "Oh, Garabaldi...
be seeing you" and gives him the old Prisoner wave. Very cool.
As another example, in LambdaMOO, the base class for the wizards
is #2 and the base class for regular players is... #6. The Prisoner
is everywhere. Work him into your next campaign.

Not an insult to the Prisoner, which is cool, but isn\'t TV-literate 
kind of contradictory?  Kind of like military intelligence???  :-)

I refereed a few Traveller PBEMs. You can find some info
on one of the games in http://astro.sns.it/~mstiavel/Traveller/tpbm.html

My experience was:
- -it is useful to prepare a rather detailed description of the 
scenario/campaign (2-3 pages), so that players who sign in will not drop
off after a couple of turn because things are different from what they 
expected.
- -it is dangerous to have more than one turn per week (too much work for the
referee, this is the reason why we stopped the game)
- -it is useful to have pregenerated characters that the players can select
- -it is necessary to enforce strict turns (start/end etc) otherwise
players go off on different timelines

This is just my experience and need not to be representative..of my
players only two had a lot of Traveller experience.

         Cheers,
              Massimo

P.S. depending on when you start ( I am very busy in the next couple of 
weeks) and how often you plan to play I may be interested in joining
you PBEM.

Dave covered these pretty well.  The executive summary is that laser power
was limited; thrust plates are back as standard technology (and cheaper),
and fusion power minimums were raised to support milleu 0.  The change to
contra-gravity is minor (allowing you to get thrust from it, too).

The most recent version of QSDS is v1.3, and it\'s on my Web site at
	http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds
When new versions are available (there will almost certainly be a v1.4,
unless IG tells me to cease and desist) the will appear on the same site.

> 4.  What are the "known errors" in QSDS and SSDS?

There are two known problems with QSDS v1.3:
1) The power plant table gives fuel requirents for 6 months, instead of the
   FF&S/SSDS standard of 1 year.
2) The HEPlaR drive table is completely wrong with respect to the input
   power required by HEPlaR drives.  The power requirement should be 14
   times the listed amount (it\'s a displacement-ton versus cubic-meter
   conversion error in my spreadsheet).

> 5.  What are the fixes for the known errors?

See above.  When T4 arrives, I\'ll compare QSDS 1.4 with what was printed,
and produce a definitive errata list.

I can\'t promise to answer promptly, but questions that are e-mailed to me
(instead of appearing in the TML, which I sometimes read and sometimes just
delete without reading) _will_ get answered, sooner or later.

Well, I did some digging.  The unmodified ship\'s deckplan seems to be lost
and gone forever (and I _know_ I did it) - oh well.  I did find two versions
of the Falcon (one at TL-12 and the other at TL-15), as well as a bunch of
other ships.

The problem with the deckplans is that they\'re 11x17 and were drawn in
color (buying Azhanti High Lightning had a big influence on the way I drew
deckplans forever afterwards); I don\'t have a scanner that can handle that.
I\'ll be posting the High Guard designs in a little while, though.

If folks are interested, there is some other material there, including a new
and different weapons list for folks who were usign the original STRIKER.

    'body' => 'I\'ve posted some info on T4 to the Traveller Mailing List, forgetting to 
add Xboat so that the CT/MT-only crowd can see the info.  So, here\'s a 
quick overview of the system:

System Overview:  T4 has errors; some are serious, most are not.  T4 is 
not TNE Second Edition; the only thing it has in common with TNE is the 
starship systems (and even that has been changed from FF&S).  T4 truly 
is, as IG claimed, "CT updated based on 20 years of RPG experience."  
Take "The Traveller Book," add a new task system, some more character 
classes, a new die-rolling convention or two (1/2 dice, X- targets 
instead of X+ targets), a consolidated and updated skills listing, and the 
aforementioned modified TNE starship creation system, and you\'ll have the 
essence of T4.  


T4\'s Known Errors:  

1)  Lots and lots of typos.  Words that are plural but which should be 
singular; vice versa; sentences like "use your Compute skill" instead of 
"use your ComputeR skill"; etc.

2)  Some awkward phrasing here and there.  Not as bad as the 70s-era 
"English" instructions in Japanese-made products, but still poor form for 
a professionally published work.

3)  The mustering out process explanation doesn\'t jibe with the ranks 
tables.  They kept the "Traveller Book" explanation, which bases the 
number of additional rolls on whether the character has achived rank 
1,2,3,4,5 or 6, while the rank tables go from E1-E10 and O1-O7 or 
O1-O10.  Not difficult to change for those of us with High Guard, 
Merchant Prince, etc.  But newbies will be confused by it.

4)  The Skills List and the Skills Descriptions are supposed to have some 
skills in italics, which is to connote those skills which may be used at 
level-0.  Unfortunately, no skills are listed in italics.  Therefore, 
there is no way to know which skills may be used at level-0.

5)  In the services portion of character generation, the skill tables 
do not have cluster/cascade skills listed in bold (they ARE listed in 
bold in the schools/colleges section, though).  This will confuse people 
at first, until they memorize which are clusters/cascades and which are not.


Things I Like About T4:

1)  I love the addition of the colleges and schools.  There are eight of 
them, but some cannot be entered into directly.  That is, you have to go 
to College before you go to Graduate School; you must graduate with 
Honors from a Military Academy before going to Commando School; and so 
on. 

2)  I like the addition of basic skills.  An age 18 character will have 
from 4 to 7 skills, depending on the tech level of his/her home world.  
This makes sense.

3)  I like the fact that characters have far, far more skills than their 
CT (basic) counterparts.  4-7 basic skills, plus 4-6 skills per term, 
plus default skills.  Basic character generation is almost as quick as 
with the CT basic rules, but the character generated this way will be on 
par with a CT Advanced (Book 4-7) character.

4)  The skills list is right for a basic book.  There are enough skills, 
but not so many that it becomes unweildy.  Additional books may (and 
should) expand on this list, but the basic book has the right amount to 
keep experienced players happy while not demanding too much of newbies.

5)  The task system is simple and logical.  There aren\'t umpteen 
exceptions as there are in most other task systems.  It\'s 
straight-forward and robust.  I can get used to 1/2 dice (matter-of-fact, 
I got used to them after just two games of Traveller Starship Battles at 
Gen-Con).

[Next time, I\'ll cover combat and whatever else I\'m able to read and 
playtest before the weekend is over.]


Some Andy Rooney-ish musings about T4:

1)  The ships look different.  It\'s not a big deal, but I\'ve always 
pictured Traveller ships as they appeared in CT.  It will take a while 
for me to adjust my mental pictures.

2)  The splashy Chris Foss interior art could have been dropped, esp. if it 
would have affected the sale price at all.  I like the b&w art by Larry 
Elmore, though.

3)  Every time I look at IG\'s Imperial Sunburst logo, I think of Mattel.

4)  T4 is definitely the official abbreviation for the game.  On the back 
of the book, in the bottom right-hand corner, is a graphic of "T4."  
Under that it says, "Marc Miller\'s Traveller 4th Edition."

5)  The book is the right size.  TNE was way too big.  A return to three 
little black books would have been rediculous at this point (no matter 
how much I love those books).  192 pages (including many pages of splashy 
art, the index, and even an advertisement for some role-playing magazine 
on the last page!) is just about right.

6)  The type font is nice.  Good size, and easy to read.

7)  That character sheet has got to go.  For one thing, it doesn\'t give 
enough room to list all the skills one will undoubtedly get under this 
system.  Heck, you can\'t list all the skills the example character 
("Alexander L. Jamison") has!  For another thing, you can get rid of the 
Mustering Out Cash/Items box (this stuff should be lised in the normal 
cash and items sections).  I think some enterprising third-party could 
make some easy money by coming up with a more usable character sheet.

8)  Including a picture of the design team was a good touch.  

9)  I miss the "Note on Gender and Race" that was included in previous 
versions.  That struck me as a good thing to include.  On the other hand, 
these days it would probably be vilified as too "Politically Correct."  
On the third hand, maybe it would be vilified as being not PC enough.  
I guess that\'s why they didn\'t include it.


More later, as necessary.

it covers just about everything you\'d want it to (in a basic book), from 
hand-to-hand to artillery, tanks, robots, and other forms of ground combat.
It is possible to cover all of this (in a basic way) in 8 short pages 
because of the robust task system.  I\'m impressed.

Quick Summary:

You can still tell Traveller has its roots in wargaming.  :)  The 
original rules shine through in this section, and their flavor is 
retained.  However, the consolidating effects of having a task system has 
vastly simplified the combat rules over what appeared in CT.  Once you 
memorize the task system, combat will go very quickly.


Errors:

The only error I found in the section is in the section discussing 
explosives.  They don\'t mention whether a grenade is thrown at a target 
HEX or a target INDIVIDUAL.  Since the system uses range bands, I guess I 
can see why they didn\'t mention it.  But, it\'ll be hard for inexperienced 
players to resolve hand grenade attacks.  They can figure damage, but not 
to-hit.  Most will probably be able to puzzle it out though.


Cool Stuff:

1)  Multiple actions:  A character can now make a number of actions each 
round up to his or her related characteristic score, but at a penalty.  A 
person with Strength 8 can make 8 Brawling attacks per round, for 
instance, but each attack will have relatively little chance of 
succeeding (unless the character is very highly skilled).  

2)  Called Shots:  You can do a called shot for increased damage (two 
kinds), decrease damage (two kinds), or to disarm.

3)  "Holding" your actions is covered well.

4)  Special rules.:  In addition to the Tactics Pool and Endurance rules 
that are familiar to most of us, there are also Strength and Dexterity 
Pools.  Strength pools allow one to increase the damage done by 
non-ranged attacks.  Dexterity pools allow one to avoid being hit by 
non-ranged attacks (no dodging bullets, darn it![G]).

5)  Initiative:  Initiative is done more logically (I got a taste of this 
in the Starship Battles game, and it works well) now.  The side that 
wins the initiative moves LAST but attacks FIRST.  That way, they can 
react to the other side\'s movement, then fire attack before the other 
side does.  This is more playable than realistic, but from experience, I 
know it does work well.

With the exception of one book ("The Last Planet" aka "Star Rangers" or
some such) the patrol is always "The Patrol". In that book it *may*
have been "the Space Patrol".

Also, it\'s "the Guild", not "the Theives\' Guild". Which gives it a nice
flavor. If someone mentions "*the* guild" with no qualifiers, everybody
knows *exactly* what they are talking about, but it\'s impossible to
*prove* it. :-)

"The Zero Stone" and "Uncharted Stars" also have a good bit of some of
Norton\'s other major "props". Namely the Forerunners, and the
Zacathans. And I think the First-In Scouts make an appearance as well.

Well, in Norton\'s universe the Free Traders are at least loosely
organized (which helps), plus, since they deal with the "frontier"
areas more, they tend to be a *lot* more experienced when it comes to
combat. And they\'ve got better excuses for going armed. 

Add in the fact that the Patrol does *not* approve of the sort of
illegal stunts the corporations would *like* to pull on the Free
Traders, and you have a workable balance of power.

BTW, that book I mentioned ("Star Rangers"/"The Last Planet") would
make a good example of how to write a neat adventure based around the
aftermath of something like the Civil War that ended the Third
Imperium. The basic idea is that a governor how didn\'t want the
detachment of Star Rangers around to get in the way of his plans
ordered them out to re-survey some planets in an area nobody had
visited in centuries. And he sent them out with inadequate spare parts
in an old ship. The story opens as the ship crash lands on a planet.
Later we run into the passengers from a liner that got lost while
trying to avoid the fighting, and refugees from a Patrol base that got
overun in the fighting. All of these get mixed together while they try
to figure out just why the planet seems to keep "bothering" the humans,
and what happened to the high civilization that used to be there.

Heck, given that Norton wrote a book based around D&D and has allowed
some use of her fantasy stuff in RPG\'s, I think that IG might want to
consider asking for permission to do a "Norton Sourcebook" for T4. Her
drives aren\'t *that* different. They even include mention of something
that sounds a lot like misjumps. And the technology is otherwise not
*that* hard to integrate. The races and backgrounds would be a nice
addition as an alternate universe to play in. And it\'d save a lot of
info that may otherwise disappear for good when she dies (I\'m assuming
that she\'d have a fair amount of input).

	But, the .5d6 is being used in 3/5 of the \'standard\' difficulties
(since you only roll for Easy in you are using a 0-level skill).  In the
Traveller Strategic Battles ar GenCon, where range=difficulty, half of
the range bands needed a .5 die.  Add this to other rools which are
rolled on 2d6 only (sensor rolls), and the results are clear:

	1) The .5d6 is integral to the T4 task system and is used frequently
(almost half the time)
	2) The T4 task system is *not* a task system, it is a system much more
kin to the Classic Traveller system of arbitrary numbers needed to
succeed, except the number of dice rolled is used instead.  IMHO, the MT
task system is vastly superior, in that it is more consistent, easier to
use, and I *don\'t* have to be reminded how many dice to roll. 

	It looks like I\'ll continue to play Traveller the way I have been, the
MT task system and modified FF&s for equipment. (Although, I\'ll probably
write up rules for using the MT task system in T4)

I\'m sorry to hear you won\'t be joining with those of us who will be 
moving on to the T4 system.  I\'m sad that there will be yet another split 
in the Traveller group, but I suppose it is unavoidable.  <sigh>

Frankly, the task mechanic in TNE is superior to MT,IMO (can\'t say about T4
until I have it in my hands).  I\'ve never been mistaken for a TNE fanatic,
but I always thought it\'s task system was
outstanding.  Every roll was against a single 1d20 and the task levels
could be pre-generated, ie.

                                  x4    x2    x1     /2    /4
Skill       Level+Attrib=Asset | Easy  Avg   Diff  Frmdbl Imps
==============================================================
Pilot         3      9    12   |  48    24    12     6      3
Astrogation   2      7     9   |  36    18     9     4      2
 
I made up character sheets like this with a place for each task difficulty
level already layed out.  When a character was created we filled in each
row.  From then on it was just a matter of:  a. calling out the difficulty,
b. rolling a 1d20, and c. comparing the result against the proper row and
column of character sheet.

Isn\'t this just a *little* unfair?  We\'ve had *three* different
varieties of 
Traveller to play with the last twenty years, and the best they could
come up
with is a mostly re-edited and re-formatted version of CT?

I will contiue to play Traveller, I will continue to purchase T4
materials ( I\'ve
got *three* copies of the T4 book, (one with me, two on order)), my wife
and I
are working on articles for submission to JTAS, and I am delighted at
the sneak peaks
of the T4 vehicle system by Greg Porter.

I\'ve been using MT\'s task system since \'88, reading TML since \'90 (and
continue to
read both TML and XBoat), and using FF&S since it came out.  

Its true, I didn\'t like TNE, I don\'t like Virus, and I believe FF&S
needs tweaking.

*But* - 

I am not part, nor have I ever been part, of the split in the Traveller
group.  I
believe there is room for all of us, regardless of what flavor Traveller
we play.
The only *real* problems I have are with those who have problems with
that.

How is this superior to the MT task system?  All I have to do in MT is
keep
track of my skill level, and add it to 2d6.

Yeah, it was unfair of me.  I\'m sort of binary in my outlook.  I\'m either 
seeing doom-and-glom or I\'m looking through rose-colored glasses.  No 
middle ground for me! :)  As I mentioned in another post, I\'d been 
anticipating and dreading (doom-and-gloomishly) a split in the Traveller 
fan base like what occurred with TNE.  Seeing your proclaimation that you 
would be sticking with MT, I jumped to the conclusion that my worst fears

I\'m sorry I did that.

Well, yeah.  :)  As a CT fan, I can honestly say that I can find no fault 
with IG\'s use of CT.  To me, it really is the best they could have 
possibly come up with. :)

Same here.  Suckers, aren\'t we? :)  IG should give little awards for

But..but...What about the unbalancing effects of changing things?  Didn\'t 
Gary Gygax\'s numerous warnings about this stop you from changing the D&D 
systems?  Good God, man!  Are you nuts?!?!  [big grin]

Wow.  What a melange!  I guess I\'m too much of a purist (or, a chicken?) 
to mix the systems that way.  As I mentioned earlier, I like using a 
mixture of simple and complex systems for CT, but all were made for use 
with CT.  Mixing between "eras" of Traveller makes me shudder. [G]
[BTW, this is not meant as a slight to you.  I\'m not disparaging your 
method, I\'m just saying it\'s too much for /me/.]

I did the same thing with my use of the Atari 8-bit.  When I started 
re-buying all the stuff I used to have, I did "serious" work on the clone 
box, and mostly just played games on the Atari.  But I got tired of 
having some things on one computer, and others on another.  So, I moved 
entirely to the Atari.  

I guess I\'m just a purist at heart.

(Strangely, though, using a 14.4Kbaud modem with the Atari doesn\'t bother 
me.  Nor does adding systems to Traveller that are developed by me or 
others on this list.  Hmmm.  I\'ll have to work on reconciling that.)


> Like many others, I will still buy T4.  However, it will probably not be

I wonder whether IG will care about such use.  On the one hand, they\'d 
undoubtedly rather you bought every single T4 item they will ever make.  
On the other hand, they\'d probably rather sell you a few items here and 
there than sell you none at all. :)

In the Traveller seminar with Marc Miller and Ken Whitman, Marc said he 
wants to replace all previous Traveller material with new, T4 material.  
Well, not all of it.  He did say he\'d ignore some of the stuff (and, 
presumably, expect others to ignore it).  The stuff to be ignored will 
probably (this is me theorizing here, not anything Marc said) be the 
more obscure third-party stuff, such as that put out by Judges\' Guild, 
Group One, and others.

first time through.  On going back over the Skills listing, the error I 
noted therein is actually far less serious than I had originally thought.

It is true (as I noted) that the promised italics used as an indication 
of skills that may be used at Level-0 are missing from the Skills List.  
However, in the actual Skill Descriptions, such skills /are/ noted.  The 
method is using the word "Default" after the skills, such as:

Acting (Performance Cluster, Default)    Int or Soc

I had mistaken the intended use of italics to be in the Skills 
Descriptions as well as in the Skills List.  This is not the case.  So, 
it /is/ possible to know which skills may be used at Level-0.  It is not 
as easy to discover as it would have been had italics been used, but this 
is certainly not a serious error.

My misunderstanding stems from the last paragraph on page 37, which states:

	"[level 0 skill use is] possible only with skills listed in 
	italics on the Skills List.  (The heading for each of those skills is 
	italicized in the individual skill descriptions as well.)"

But then in the Skills Description section, just prior to the beginning 
of the actual descriptions, it reads:

	"As in the Skills list, those skills that can be used at level 0 
	as a default are noted, as are cascade skills."

The use of the word "default" in that statement led me to re-evaluate 
what they meant by Default in the Skills Descriptions.  I had originally 
thought it meant that the skill was not a cascade skill.  In fact, there 
are many non-cascade skills listed without the word "Default" in their 
heading.  I conclude from this that "Default" must mean that the skill is 
usable at level 0.

This conclusion is borne out by the types of skills with the word 
"Default" in their heading and those that do not.  Acting, 
Administration, Athletics, and Blade Combat are "Default," while 
Artillery, Battle Dress, and Demolitions are not, for example.

I apologize most humbly to everyone for making this mistake.

As it stands, T4 now has only one known serious error: the problem with 
Mustering Out rolls.  All other errors are minor and unlikely to affect 
play (ie, typos, grammatical errors, missing bold face and italics, etc.).

Different strokes, I suppose. 

With MT you had to remember 3+, 7+, 11+, 15+ and what they went with.  You
had to add the, what was it 20% of the attribute to the skill to get your
number, but that could be pregenerated.  Then add that number to one of
those level numbers and compare to a 2d6. Easy for you! <g>

Harder for me. <shrug>

Truth to tell, T4\'s system would be OK with me if it wasn\'t for the darn .5
dice!  No matter what Joe says I *know* I\'m not going to like them. <g>

Eris

ps.

I wrote a Traveller-4 Die Roller this afternoon.  That\'s one reason I
wanted the know whated the details on the task levels, I knew I had this
afternoon off to work on the program. <g>

It works nicely, just hit the button for the task level and it generates a
number for you.  As long as the computer rolls the .5 dice for me, the
system is just fine.  <g>

I\'m doing something similar:
1.  \'Basic\' character classes and generation - MT, but I\'m leaning
toward 
	changing this to T4.
2. \'Advanced\' Character Generation - MT detailed system - for those
people who
	want to know almost *everything* about their character background (me
	included).  I\'m definately going to add the colleges rules from T4.
3. Task resolution - MT
4. Personal combat - MT, modified with ideas from Friday Night Firefight
and
	Phoenix	Command, along with personal rules for character damage.
5. Vehicle combat - Task-based Striker (the original), with personal
rules
	for damage.
6. Starship Combat - MT Task-based Brilliant Lances, with some minor
changes.
7. Weapon/Vehicle/Starship design - FF&S, modified with Striker/MT stuff
	- T-Plates from MT
	- Armour/Penetration ratings as Striker
	- Using high-speed discharge batteries instead of HPGs
	- Lowering the weight of Battledress \'skeletons\'
	- Changing some descriptions
	- Adding rules for grav-focused, starship-mounted plasma/fusion guns 
	- etc, etc
8.  World generation - mostly MT, but using the WBH from DGP for real
detail.
9.  Time Period CT/MT - my campaigns have ranged from 1105-1130
10. Various other tidbits taken from a variety of sources (Traveller
	Chronicle, Challenge, other games, etc).

As various parts of T4 come out, I can see my switching numbers 5,6,7,
if the
new rules are to my, and my players, liking.  If not, I\'ll change them.

I\'m already in the process of \'salad bar-ing\' (take what you like, leave
the 
rest) T4.  I\'ve been known to do this will all the games I run.

Gotta agree with you here, although not completely.  I\'m enough of a

   One possible source of inspiration would be the British Magna Carta,
which spells out the rights of nobles.  The Imperial version of this
document would certainly do that as well.  Additionally it would spell
out the rights of commoners--here the U.S. or Canadian constitutions
would be of assistance.

   You can count on there being something that states something along
the lines that the word of the Emperor is law, something akin to Papal
infallibility.  Ideally it would also address the issue of Imperial 
succession, and the Moot\'s role in it (you\'ll also want a loophole allowing
for the possibility for succession through assassination as well with an
eye toward the Barracks Emperors and the Rebellion yet to come).

   It probably would not address a detailed government structure, as that
probably isn\'t an issue in the early years (everything centers on the
Emperor in any event).

   All I can think of at the moment.  More later if I come up with anything.

Regards,

Harold

    'body' => 'Here is the errata/potential errata I\'ve found so far:

Step 2, the text directs you to "select a hull from the table on the next
page".  The actual chart it is refering to is on page 107, which is 15
pages later.

Step 3, the text says, "on the following table, cross-index the jump level
desired with the size of hull".  There is no such table, not below nor
anywhere else in the book, making it impossible to design jump capable
ships.

Step 6, the text indicates that missile launchers "do not have to be
crewed when operating as part of a missile battery under the control of
a master fire director", but in Step 9 the text indicates that "one gunner is
required for each weapon, sandcaster and nuclear damper battery
installed".  For missile batteries, is this gunner in addition to the one
required for the MFD?  The two statements seem to contradict each
other.

   Also, I now know why people *really* loved the Third Imperium so
much--missiles were free, shoot all you want!!!  No where have I been
able to find any mention of the *cost* or *displacement* of spare missiles,
which presumably you will need after you shoot off the ready missiles
provided in the turret or barbette (which I guess are also free).

Step 7, Small Craft External Grapples are described, Small Craft Hangars
and Launch Ports (table for which is on page 112) are not.  Fuel
Purification Plants are mentioned on page 89, but not in Step 7, which is
presumably the section they belong in (the table for them appears on
page 111).  Ditto Shops and Labs, which rates a chart on page 111, but
no explanatory text beyond what is on the chart and a brief mention of
Sickbays in Step 9.

Step 10, the text indicates you should, "multiply the number of crew
members that need workstations by the workstation characteristic
above".  One big problem: there is no characteristic above.  The chart
you need is actually located on page 112.

Chart section problems 

The Standard Military Controls table on page 105 indicates that the crew 
requirements for such controls is 0.0 at all tech levels.  Given that the
Standard  Civilian Controls table on the same page gives some number
from 1 to 3, it appears that the crew numbers for SMCs are incorrect.

The Thrust Plate Drive Potential table on 108 is rather awkwardly labeled,
giving one the impression that the Gs column starts at 100!  Easy enough
to figure out that 100 refers to displacement and that Gs run from left to
right, but this should have been done better.

Additional Criticisms

   The beginning of the Spacecraft section promises, "with the systems
in this chapter, a player design nearly any type of spacecraft, up to 5000
tons displacement".  Avoiding a criticism of the grammar used, we
discover that while the Standard Hull Configurations chart does go up to
5000 tons, there is very few options in the configurations you have to
choose from (at 3000, 4000, and 5000 tons there is only one type). 
Also, the minimum size hull is 100 tons displacement.  This means you
can forget designing your own small craft, fighters or jump shuttles for
now.  I would have much preferred that this chart be taken out to a full
page, and a wider variety of standard hulls be presented.  Surely some
company in the Third Imperium makes standard small craft components!

   While it appears that the wholesale errata that plagued MegaTraveller
(aka MegaErrata) has been avoided (thank the Divine Being), this section
is probably the most  poorly laid out of any of the four attempts (classic
T, High Guard, MT, TNE) to present a ship design system in Traveller.
For example, the charts for weapons and defensive systems
(something one would assume you could find all in one place) are
scattered over four separate pages in the charts section.  In attempting
to assemble a 1000 ton TL 12 destroyer (an attempt thwarted by the
lack of a proper jump drive chart mentioned above), I found myself
frequently flipping back and forth between pages to find the proper 
chart or instructions.  While the actual work involved in putting the
ship together was much less than with FF&S, the constant page flipping
was very annoying.  Were I to use this system on a regular basis, I
would end up photocopying the entire section and redoing the layout so
that it was in a more logical sequence.  Those responsible for the
actual layout of this section (who now will never admit it in public) should
be ceremonially flogged with a piece of wet spaghetti.

   Well that\'s what I\'ve found on the first run through.  If anybody else
has any errata they have found (particularly in the charts), please post
it here.  If someone at IG would like to respond to what I\'ve found so far,
I\'m sure everyone would like to hear it.

Harold

   It is MIA.  Thanks for the info--now I can finish that destroyer.

   As a matter of fact it was also missing, still another piece of errata
I\'m afraid.  Thanks for posting it.

   The problem is that missile launchers and laser weaponry are treated
differently in the book.  While laser weaponry is preorganized into
batteries (sometimes consisting of just one weapon), missile launchers
come in two types: turrets or barbettes.  There is no discussion of
organizing launchers into batteries, only how many missiles can be
controlled by a MFD.

   A clarification statement of some kind should handle the problem.

>No.  The manning requirements are per _battery_ (MFD), not
>per _mount_ (launcher).

   At higher tech levels, it is possible to have multiple missile turrets
organized into seperate batteries under a single MFD (this is generally
not an issue at TL 12 or below, because MFD control factors aren\'t 
usually high enough).  Thus, MFD and missile battery are not necessarily
synonymous, and thus the source of the confusion.

   Also--I\'ve designed several ships using FF&S, so I\'m familar with how
things work under that system.  What I\'m attempting to do here is
approach things as though I know nothing about FF&S, and I\'m picking
up T4 with no prior knowledge (just as a new player would).

   Standard FF&S missiles displace 7 cubic meters and weigh 7 tons--
that fact is not stated in T4 however, though it certainly should be,
as should the time it takes to reload missile launchers.  I\'m afraid we\'re
back to the classic T pre-Special Missile Supplement rules, where
missiles are much less powerful, but you never have to worry about
reloads or running out of them.

>A hangar is a hangar, y\'know.  A place to keep your small craft, kind of
>like a garage.  

   As I stated above, I\'m familar with the concepts, but someone picking
up the book with no prior knowledge of TNE might not understand the
difference.  The difference may be explained elsewhere, but I couldn\'t
find it on my first run through.

>I didn\'t really provide any explanatory text for any of these items.  The
>shops, labs, and sickbays were controversial, so there weren\'t (and

   How could shops, labs, and sickbays be controversial?  and if you\'ve
gone to all the trouble of putting them in the game, why wouldn\'t you
include a description of them?  I\'m not accusing you personally of
anything, I just don\'t understand IG\'s logic.

>Fuel purificaion plants turn raw fuel <snip>

   This is the explanation that a newbie needs, and it should have been
included, but wasn\'t.

>Not my fault.  IG moved things around to get them to fit (on the other

   Absolutely.  If you are going to the trouble of including a *very* basic
ship design sequence, then you owe it to your public to make sure that
everything is spelled out as clearly and concisely as possible, and that
it all works as seamlessly and effortlessly as possible.  Afterall, you\'re
trying to *encourage* non-gearheads to design a ship, not discourage
them.

>I believe the controls (both civilian and military) do not require any crew.
>The tables I submitted to Imperium Games included a crew column on

   Well the columns were definately there.  On the SCC, at TL 9: 3.0 crew
are required, at TL 10: 3.0, at TL 11: 2.0, at TL 12: 2.0, at TL 13: 2.0, at
TL 14: 1.0 and at TL 15: 1.0 are required.

>That\'s mainly due to space limitations.  For the same reason, the table

   Interesting, as the chart does not indicate that all the hulls are from
one universal tech level, though that would certainly make sense in
retrospect.

  Time for a *minor* correction on my TL 12 destroyer\'s hull....

>As it was, I barely finished the system in time to be included in the book;

>made it miss.

   Then it was probably a good thing that you left it out.  Better a limited
system that can be expanded later than a total diaster unsuitable for
use by sane people (i.e. MegaErrata ship design).

>Remember, T:TNE _didn\'t_ have a ship design system in the main
>rulebook.  T4 was almost the same; and most of the layout problems

   True enough, we get a slightly simplified TNE system in Brilliant Lances
(not included with the TNE manual), and then the full blown system in
FF&S (which you could purchase seperately or with the TNE manual as
part of the boxed set).  I beg to differ on the space problems though--
there appears to be more than adequate space available in the section
so that the tables could have been layed out in a more logical format.
Also, someone decided that inserting three full pages sketches that
have nothing to do what-so-ever with ship design in the ship design
section was a good idea--for future reference to whom it may concern,
it was not.  Neither was putting six pages of ship design examples
and illustrations between the ship design instructions and the tables
you need to carry out the instructions.  While having the examples
close at hand in the book was OK, they should have been put at the
end or the beginning of the ship design section so that you don\'t have to
flip past them as you go back and forth looking up information for your
designs.

>Again, pending the permission of IG, you\'ll be able to download a
>much-better-organized version of the system from my Web site.

   I look forward to it.

>Remember, I don\'t work (or speak) for IG; I just wrote the system ...

   Nearly as good  (and in some cases better).

   For the record, I\'m not trying to trash IG here or the new ship design
sequence.  I\'m merely trying to point out where the problems are, so
that they can be fixed.  I want everyone to be able to use this system
so that they don\'t feel like they have to fall back on Book 2 or High Guard
or some other such thing, or worse still, not design a ship at all.  One of
the things I appreciated most about TNE was that GDW was very open
and upfront about where mistakes were made, and they were 
generally quick to fix them (and no smart ass remarks about Virus being
a mistake they didn\'t fix, OK?).  Hopefully IG will continue this tradition.

Harold

First, the list has run on ns.mpgn.com ever since we switched to majordomo a
while back.  The weekend of the 11th of August (I think) we lost ns to a cpu
failure.  This was a DecStation 5000 running Ultrix 4.4.  To get our name
server (which was the key role of this machine) back on line, I grabbed the
one machine I had avaialble, which was a Dec Alpha running OSF 1.3.  I
copied all the majordomo stuff from the drives on the 5000 to the Alpha and
brought the list back up.  Now that history is past us:

The messages coming from ns.mpgn.com instead of mpgn.com are probably some
sendmail configuation difference between the two machines.  I will try to
get this fixed in the near future, but it is a pretty low priority.

The Mime-headers seem to have gone away.  Personally I like this.  I use Elm
from home and it doesn\'t like Mime-messages very well.  Any reason to go
back to them?

I have gotten a lot of returned mail, but they all seem to be ligitamate
bounces, mail boxes full, user unknown, etc.  I just went through most of
TML and removed the bounces I have been getting.  I will try to get to Xboat
later today.

As far as the anonymous remailer bounces you are seeing, can someone forward
me a copy and I will try to track down the source of the bounce. (a
difficult task no doubt)

Any way, I would like to appoligize for the recent problems.  Its not my
fault that that 5000 had to go conk out on me :-)

That\'s true.

I think what Stu was saying is that a lot of us CT-ers have moved all of 
our discussion to TML, since that\'s where discussion of T4 take place and 
T4 is so close to being CT...

I\'m really beginning to think it could be a possibility.  If 
anything, there might be a need for a 2nd list for TNE holdouts...

Yup, but a lot of former xboat CT/MT hardcores are now posting on TML 
since T4 is better discussed there...  This is my point...

     Due to a crackdown at work, I\'ve had to unsubscribe from all my 
     non-work mailing lists :-(.  I\'m having difficulty with xboat.  Every 
     time I ask majordomo to unsub me, it says I\'m not a member.  Doing a 
     \'which\' command says I\'m not on any lists at mpgn.  However, I\'m still 
     getting messages from xboat.
     
     I\'m really quite keen to be unsubscribed very quickly, since other

Send it to: majordomo@mpgn.com, and in the body of the message give your 
commands, such as:

subscribe traveller your_address
or
subscribe traveller-digest your_address
or
unsubscribe xboat your_address
or 
unsubscribe xboat-digest your_address

You can give more than one command, but each must be on its own line.

I intend to get a lot of gaming in.  By the time I get back, I should

OK, fine, but we also have descriptions of "cold fusion" plants which 
power the grav vehicles and ground cars.  Given that the 4 ton (metric 
ton, not disp. tons) grav vehicle and the 1.5 ton ground car can both use 
cold fusion plants I doubt that they take up 5.6 cubic meters.

So, what are the stats for cold fusion plants, and why aren\'t they being

This is just a guess, but the smaller cold fusion plants will probably be 
in with the vehicle/small craft design rules.  Given the space 
constraints on QSDS, they probably had to make a decision as to how small 
of fusion plants to include, and decided that those smaller ones had to 
be left out.

I could try, but you will probably get better results doing a search on Alta 
Vista (http://www.altavista.digital.com).  I did one and got 3k hits, the 
first page of which looked promising.  The URL for the search is 
http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&what=web&fmt=.&q="cold+
fusion"

[Be careful of the return my mail app probably inserted between "+" and 
"fusion".]

When you insert metal alloy rods of a special configuration into ordinary
water and then run an electric current through the mechanism, the metal alloy
rods serve as a catalyst (that is, they promote the reaction, but are
unchanged by it) which promotes fusion of hydrogen into helium.

The result is a production of energy as a current flow from the mechanism
without the need for high temperatures, containment fields, or high energy
inputs.

The output is affected by the specific composition of the metal alloy rods,
the purity of the water (including the isotopic composition), and other
factors.

2. All About The Traveller Mailing Lists

   There are two Traveller Mailing lists, these are TML and XTML. Both of
   these lists exist as a means for the Traveller Player/GM to exchange
   ideas and discuss the various aspects of the Traveller System, and its
   universe.

   The Traveller Mailing List (TML) is open to discussions on all aspects
   of Traveller. This includes Marc Miller\'s Traveller, Traveller: The
   New Era, Mega Traveller and Classic Traveller. This also includes the
   background.

   The Xboat Traveller Mailing List (XTML) is for discussions relating to
   Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller and the Traveller universe dating
   prior to the Rebellion.

  2.2. How Do I Unsubscribe?

   To leave the TML, send a message to majordomo@MPGN.COM and in the body
   put the lines:

   unsubscribe traveller
   unsubscribe traveller-digest

   This will ensure that you are no longer subscribed to either real time
   or digest mode.
   To leave the XTML, the body of the message should be

   unsubscribe xboat

3. What are the etiquette rules for the lists?

   Here are a few guidelines for posting your thoughts to the TML. Please
   note that they are only guidelines. They are intended to make
   everybody\'s life easier by keeping the noise level down and keeping
   the content high.
     * All messages should have a meaningful title. Please don\'t use "Re:
       Traveller-digest V1996 #2" or anything similar.
     * Any message which is over about 150 lines should be labelled as
       LONG in the title. This gives a warning to those running terminal
       sessions over slow links.
     * If you have a very long message that is not relevant to everybody,
       please consider making it available on an FTP or WWW site instead.
       Then announce it\'s existance on the list. A good example of
       material suitable for this is program listings and scripts.
     * Flame wars should be quickly extinguished or moved to personal
       email addresses.
     * When quoting, please follow these guidelines:
          + Please quote the minimum amount possible to show what you are
            responding to. Remember, everybody has already read the
            original message, they just need to remember it! :-)
          + Please don\'t paste in 5 generations of replies on a
            particular topic, or an entire 150 line message. Excerpts
            work best.
          + Don\'t quote signatures.
          + Don\'t quote a message just to say "me too"
     * Signatures should be limited to around 4 lines please.

        I figure a futuristic radar setup would have both ground sensing
and air-sweeping radar. For Ground radar, you will be able to detect (and
possibly image) any moving object within line of sight (less than 100m in
forest, greater than 2km in desert). Air-sweeping radar will detect out to
the horizon (70km) in perfectly flat terrain (calm ocean), significantly
less in rough terrain (1-2km), and virtually nil in a depression.
Sophisticated radar systems will also be able to recognize pre-programmed
objects (enemy tanks, aircraft).

       Attack radar is usually a seperate system, though by 5700ad I figure
scan-while-track will be common. I figure a sensors roll (range and terrain
dependant) will be necessary to obtain a lock-on. Once locked on, all
radar-assisted guns (with balistic computers) will fire one level easier,
and guided ordinance (missiles, etc) will hit 80-90% of the time.

        Radar detectors will also be activated both by the sweeping and
attack radars. This will allow the pilot/driver to jinx, deploy ECM, or
fire anti-radiation missiles (missiles that home in on the radar signal).
The effectiveness of this is up to you. The strongest consideration should
be the Tech level, I would say each tech level difference reduces
effectiveness by half (for both radar, and countermeasures).

                                                                Matt

My name\'s Glenn and I\'ve managed to stay "clean" for twelve years. No
wasting time on rpg\'s in all that time (well, a relapse or two, just for
old time\'s sake). But, uh-oh... Some of my friends want me to run Traveller
again... I resisted at first but... oh, the temptation... Now I\'ve fallen
completely off the wagon. I went out and bought T4.

A fine book. Excellent Chris Foss reproductions. Dull but readable
typeface. Better organized than the Traveller Book. Too bad somebody didn\'t
proof-read it too closely, but as an editor I know how it is - deadlines
and such.

And the game seems to have been immensely improved while I was away. I
stopped playing after The Traveller Book, so this is my first exposure to
the Task system - seems very cool indeed - and the armor rules make much
better sense this time round. My favourite RPG seems to have just gotten
better.

But there are those nagging inconsistencies in the Imperium universe which
have always bothered me. So this time out I\'m biting the bullet and
developing my own future history and setting. Maybe someday I\'ll dump big
chunks of it onto somebody\'s ftp site, once I\'ve got the bugs worked out.

In the meantime, here\'s a question I haven\'t seen discussed in the XTML
digests I\'ve been skimming in the MPGN Archives... 

What ever happened to radio-spectrum CETI (Communication with
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)? You might point out that the Imperium\'s
got FTL X-boats, what do they need with those old, slow radio waves, right?

Well, it\'s clearly a crowded universe, including scatterlings of Old Terra
all over the place; so there must be a HUGE number of other civilizations,
major races and minor, in all that vastness beyond Known Space. The
Imperium\'s been around a long time, off and on; they could certainly be
carrying on centuries-long radio conversations with other species in the
Orion Arm, not to mention the Perseus and Sagittarius arms. Heck, you might
pick up the occassional "We\'re Here!" beacon transmitting from another
galaxy. IF you\'re listening. If you get bored, it wouldn\'t be so difficult
to set up automated listening stations.

Because maybe... just maybe... somebody out there, 90 degrees away around
the Milky Way\'s disc, has discovered the secret of tachyonic travel. Or at
least a Jump-7 drive. Or a really great Taco recipe. And maybe they want to
share...

In the future history I\'m working on, I plan to have a truly galactic,
Saganesque network of radio civilizations, conversing slowly about such
matters.  At the very least, far-flung civilizations might want to trade
data on supernova chain reactions, or galactic plasma jets, or other
galactic "weather hazard" reports. However, I do suspect any tech-17
societies are going to keep their best techno-goodies close to their
chests, partly for advantage in trade with their closer neighbours, but
also to avoid calling too much unwanted military attention to oneself. 

Is this a topic covered by any Imperium material, canonical or otherwise?

    For EuroGenCon-96 I produced a demo version of a concept
for a Traveller Suite, similar in market positioning to the
recently released TSR CD-ROM. The features of the demo included:
    * On-line rules
    * On-line library data
    * Star maps of the imperium allowing viewing from sector
down to system level.
    * Character and NPC design and generation
    * Starship construction
    * Animal Encounter generation
    * Ship Deckplan Design
    * Planetary Map Editing
    * Language Handout Editing
    * Trade Account Management
    * A dice roller (including 1/2 d6 support)

   The demo elicited a very positive reaction from both players and
distributors and I received a large number of requests to make
this demonstration publicly available.
    Additionally Imperium Games have given us the go-ahead to take
this to the level of a potential product. We are currently in
discussions with them about licensing considerations and market
positioning.
    Although no one actually managed to crash the software while on
display (although many tried!) it is still only an alpha test
version. Its main purpose is to solicit feedback on what a final
product should look like and include.
    In order to best gather this response I would like to set up
a web site containing a number of pages:
    * A release page for ease of access
    * A user feedback page where people can add their comments and
suggestions
    * A Known Bugs and Workaround page where users can track problems
in the alpha version and how to live with them.
    Due to access problems I cannot maintain these pages from my
current account. I would be highly appreciative of any volunteers
from out there who can set this up for me!

    The development manager of this software is Jo Grant who can be
reached at jo_grant@crd.lotus.com. The project manager is Andy Lilly
who can be reached at A.S.Lilly@nortel.co.uk. This product is brought
to you by the CORE Traveller development group, in association with
Imperium Games, and is intended to compliment our range of upcoming
Traveller supplements.

Getting the message across.

The X-Boat network in Traveller.

What is it?

The X-Boat network is the main means of sending messages across the vast 
Imperium.  It
was established 624 (Imperial) and covered the entire Imperium in 718 
(Imperial).  The
backbone of the system is a small craft capable of a maximum speed of Jump 
4.
Administration of the X-Boat system is the responsibility of the 
Communications Office
division of the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS).  Although the 
maximum speed of an
X-Boat is jump 4, not all jumps are made at that speed.   Because of the 
way the network is
laid out, the average speed a message travels is Jump 2.6.

How it operates.
The best way to describe this process is to do it as an example.  Say I was 
staying at Capital
and I wanted to drop a message of to a close friend of mine on Regina.  I 
would address it in
the following fashion:
*John Smith@Regina/Regina.TASNET.JS584866

So breaking it down, starting with the far left.  The * informs me that 
John is a registered
voter on Regina then his name.  The @ means located at.  Regina is the 
system name,
Regina is the subsector capitol.  The next part TASNET is the computer 
system name and
the last part is his identity on that system followed by his UPP.

Common computer system domains include:
TASNET:_Traveller\'s Aid Society.
EDUNET:_Educational.
GOVNET:_Local government.
IMPGOV:_Imperial government.
COMNET:_Commercial businesses.
PRIVNET:_Non business.

These are the main ones.  Major corporations\' names are added after the 
network name and
before  the user ID.

I record my message to John using my terminal in my room.  I have the 
option of Video,
Audio, or text.  The only difference in them is the quality and cost.  
Video is 30 credits for
each ten minutes per jump, audio 10 credits for ten minutes and text one 
credit for ten pages.
Mixed text and pictures\' costs one credit per page.  If I was not using a 
terminal in my room,
there are public terminals located in most starports.  Although video 
transmissions are only
available on class A starports, audio class B and C or less is text only.
Billing is in Imperial credits and worked out with the jump speed of 2.5.  
If he was not on the
main route, the message would be passed to the Imperial Courier Service 
(ICS) for final
delivery.

I have finished my message and instruct the terminal to send.  The terminal 
then gives me
the option to have my message encrypted, this doubles the cost of the 
message.  From here,
the data is compressed and passed to the local communications system for 
transmission to
an X-Boat station or passed to the ICS for delivery onto an X-Boat route.

An X-Boat drops into realspace.  The pilot then activates the recovery 
beacon and aligns the
communications array to the X-Boat station.  An X-Boat station is 
constructed close to entry
points of Hyperspace and contains fuel, pilot stations and communications 
arrays.  The
station dispatches an X-Boat Tender with a fresh pilot and fuel.  Once it 
has reached the
boat, it recovers it, changes crew and refuels it.  This process takes 
about four hours.  The
record for this routine is seven minutes.  A single tender can deal with up 
to six X-Boats at a
time.  In busy systems, many tenders can be seen working at once to keep 
the network
going.  Once re-fuelled and a new pilot aboard, the X-boat is released and 
gets ready to
jump.  While all this activity is going on, the X-Boat is still getting 
data and messages.

Once all checks are finished aboard the pilot shuts down the communication 
array and
departs the system.  The pilot from the X-Boat is given another job, 
whether this be aboard
the tender or at the X-Boat station.  After a week in normal space he is 
reassigned to another
X-Boat and his job starts again.

What is the ICS?

The ICS maintains a fleet of type S scout/couriers.  It is they who take 
the messages to
systems off the main network.  They are mostly modified with the passenger 
compartments
removed and replaced with extra computer storage and extra fuel tankage.  
They depart at
different speeds taking their messages to wherever they need to go.

How do I collect my mail?
Usually this is just  case of connecting up to the planet\'s data net and 
accessing it that way.
If you are on the move, this can be tricky.  Copies of mail are held at 
subsector and sector
capitals and at TAS hostels.  The last option only applies if you are a 
member of TAS.  Mail
is also archived at scout bases, this option requires an administration fee 
of about 100 credits
and a week to accomplish.  You also need to produce proof of identity.  A 
standard Imperial
bank card is usually all that is required.

What else does the X-Boat system handle?
You can make bank payments at an X-Boat office.   The information is 
encoded and then
sent to the back of your choice.  This has become a standard way of paying 
for starships.

Does the X-Boat carry military transmissions?
Yes, unless the transmissions are secure.  If they are secure then the 
Imperial agency
sending the transmissions uses an Imperial courier vessel.  Imperial 
courier ships are rated
at Jump 4 with a few being capable of Jump 6!


What about parcels or paper transmissions?
To some, a letter is the ultimate secure transmission.  You cannot drop a 
letter into a
computer and scan for a phrase.  Someone has to read it all the way 
through.  Letters are
handled by the ICS except they are not X-Boat sent.  Instead the message is 
accepted at the
ICS office and then passed on with other letters and parcels to a cargo 
ship.  Letter post
costs one credit per 100grams of weight.  Parcels on the other hand can 
make licensed
carriers a tidy profit.  For ease of packing aboard ships, parcels must be 
sent using a
standard design.  The boxes are available at starports everywhere at the 
cheap price of a
tenth of its size in credits..  The smallest box is a 10cm plastic cube and 
this costs one credit.
The postage for this item is 5 credits.  A cubic metre costs ten credits 
and postage costs 500.
The formula used to calculate this is: (size*size*size)/6*10.  Size= size 
in cms.  So the metre
box is 100*100*100 =300/6=50*10=500.  Postage is charged per 2 jumps or 
fraction thereof.
The parcels are collected and dropped into a cargo container for a sector.
So, I decide to send John a litre of water.  The water fits into a metre 
cube and I take it to the
ICS office.  There I pay my 2500 credits for it to be carried 24 parsecs.  
The package is
loaded into a cargo container along with nine other metre cubes for Regina. 
 Each cargo
container will hold ten cubic metres for each ton of displacement.  Once 
loaded, a licensed
trader is contacted for delivery.

Note:  Since the ICS has limited ships available, they rely upon licensed 
carriers.  Obtaining
a licence is not easy. First an application form has to be filled out and a 
fee of 500,000
credits is paid.  Then the applicant is given a thorough background check 
if anything looks
suspect then their application is refused and the fee is kept.  If all 
looks good, the applicant is
granted a licence.

ICS regulations prevent more than five tons of a ships\' cargo space from 
being used for mail.
This prevents unscrupulous captains from running off with mail and also 
means there is a
steady flow of carriers.  Each ton of space nets the carrier 5000 credits.

If a group of governments is pitching together for a Subsidised Merchant 
and the ICS thinks it
will suit their needs then they will throw in one fifth of the cash for it. 
 The merchant is usually
given first pick of the cargo.

The cargo is then transported to its destination in its pod.  It may along 
the way make stops
to drop off mail pods and collect more.

MegaTraveller.
The X-Boat system operates at full capacity until about 1120.  Once fleets 
start to diminish,
many systems start to lose contact.  The Aslan\'s hold off attacking X-Boats 
because they
present no threat.  Many ships and pilots where lost in systems that had 
major battles as they
became easy targets for stray missiles.  Once the virus starts to rampage 
through Imperial
space many X-Boats become infected.  They become carriers of the Virus.  
Since they
contain only enough fuel for a jump 4 they drift aimlessly.  It is during 
the rebellion the ICS
makes the bold decision not to spy on enemy systems.  This leads to Lucan\'s 
and Dulinor\'s
fleets to intentionally destroy X-Boats in enemy territory.  Vagr pirates 
prey on them for
spares and the long range jump drives.

New Era.
There is not the personnel to maintain something as complex as a network of 
ships.  A vague
communications network exists but it lacks the range of the old X-Boats.  
Many have been
found in systems, dead and lifeless.  They are boarded and scavenged for 
spares.  Since
they have no manoeuvre drive the hulls are just left to decay.  No X-Boat 
ever became a
Vampire ship simply because they could not refuel.

I\'d go with jsmith@whatever.tasnet.world.subsector, mainly because the
internet sorts that way for a reason.  I favor eliminating the UPP from the
address because its a game mechanic, not something I visualize being used
for an id, especially because it changes as you age - I wouldn\'t want my
mail not to get to me because I got older, or because I got knighted.

Check the date _very carefully_ against the Civil War material.  I don\'t
think that the network could have been established until Arbatrella
was  in full control (at least as Regent, if not as Empress).  Include
a paragraph or so about how Arbatrella intended to reduce the chances
of another Civil War by tying the Imperium more closely together. 
(Background is always good.  Book 9: Fighting Ships was about 300%
more useful than  Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium because
it included a couple paragraphs of actual _text_ about each ship,
as opposed to just the stats.)

The section about "X-boats didn\'t become Vampire ships" should be 
deleted.  Sure, they couldn\'t refuel... but the computer might very
well be infected with Virus, which then goes dormant as the power
fails.  And I\'m sure X-boats had anti-intruder measures just in
case a pirate dcided to start preying on the communication lines.

HEY!

Flooding gets you nowhere!

Now, did you ever once perhaps read the little automatic message sent to you
after you subscribe to a mailing list?  You know, the one that tells you how
to unsubscribe, and, it tells you NOT to delete it!

Perhaps in the future you\'ll pay attention a bit more...and, as I said,
flooding gets you nowhere...each one of your messages has been forwarded
back to you by myself...I hate getting floods.

To unsubscribe:

send a message to majordomo@mpgn.com

unsubscribe xboat (-digest)

That\'s it...got it?

Well If I was building a naval base I\'d put a few *big* meson guns and lots of 
turrets. I\'d have mines in thhe area and satellites that could fire missiles, lasers 
etc. (No crew as well they will not last long in a real fight.)  

If it\'s a base there will be a lot of ships in the area as well SDB, passing battle 
ships etc. 

And of course the whole area will be seeded with sensor satellites. 

( Note if some of the satellites stop transmiting a careful commander might think 
that there was an emeny ship interfering with them.)

If I was in the PCs I think I would be trying to get in to the base and destroy it 
by some form of sabotage. (Poison, Reactor accident, Reprogram the space base 
defences to attack the base or *all* incoming ships)

Dear Traveller Afficionados,
 
I\'ve  noticed some  speculation over  the past  few weeks  on the
mailing lists pertaining to DGP\'s future role in Traveller, and I
thought you might appreciate an update...
 
DGP has been  in negotiations with the managers  of Traveller for
almost 10 months. Those guys sure are busy.
 
Even though  I\'m not as enthusiastic  as I was 10  months ago, it
looks like a deal may be able to be worked out. Keep your fingers
crossed.
 
We are seeking  a renewal of DGP\'s Traveller  license, so that we
can rerelease  our extensive Traveller archives  in various forms
as  well as  produce brand  new Traveller  works for  your gaming
pleasure. We love  sci-fi, and we look forward  to being involved
in Traveller development once again  and working with Marc Miller
and Imperium Games.
 
Wish us luck!
 
I\'ll keep you posted.
 
Sincerely (floating somewhere in limbo),
 
    Rodge
 
Roger Sanger
Digest Group Publications
 
 
 
P.S.:  Out of  curiosity, which  of DGP\'s  publications were your
absolute favorites?
 
What  in particular  did you  like about  DGP\'s works compared to
other game supplements?                                        RS

Dear Carlos,
 
The Geonee  were presented in detail  in DGP\'s Travellers\' Digest
(magazine)  #17.  They  were  the  special  focus  of  the issue,
introduced  as  the  main  non-player  characters  in the feature
adventure  "Missing in  Transit" in  the Digest\'s  epic series of
adventures: "The  Grand Tour". There are  plenty of illustrations
showing their size and their garb, including the cover painting.
 
Shiwonee, the Geonee Homeworld is  also presented, in DGP\'s Grand
Survey  (World Builders\'  Handbook) format.  A tech-level  G (16)
world,  Shiwonee is  an interesting  place to  visit, though  not
nearly as interesting as the arrogant and essentric Geonee (among
other things, they keep their women under lock and key, including
their posessions  - even crewmembers  who belong to  them!). They
claim to be a "Major Race", not by virtue of discovering the jump
drive  (they  didn\'t),  but  by  virtue  of  being  the  Ancients
themselves!  This claim is ignored by the official  six (that is,
five *)  Major Races, but the  Geonee actually do have  a special
relationship  with the  Ancients -  chirpers are  integrated into
their society and  have a very central role  in their culture. Of
course,  the  Geonee  are  first  to  brag  about  their superior
technology, and they act as superior beings at every opportunity,
despite their  diminutive stature (they  aren\'t much taller  than
chirpers!).
 
The  feature adventure  comes  complete  with a  diabolical plot,
Ancient Artifacts, and even a love interest.  :)
 
As with  most Travellers\' Digests, the  astrography of the region
is  also  presented,  complete  with  library  data.  Of  course,
as in  all TDs, character  descriptions of the  PCs of the  Grand
Tour series (Akidda Laagiir,  Dur Telemon, Dr. Theodor Krenstein,
and the AI robot AB 101) are included.
 
 
 
Travellers\' Digest 11 also presents  a system survey of the world
Far  Trinity in  the  Massilia  sector, "Project  Blackheart" (an
ultra secret  EYES ONLY naval  adventure set in  the aftermath of
the Fifth Frontier War  against an imposing Zhodani technological
threat),  an  entry  in  the  regular  feature  "Medical  Digest"
covering  TL  9  to  TL  12  human  medicine, detailed "Traveller
Arsenal" descriptions and illustrations of the PGMP-12, the Gauss
Pistol,  and  the  Gauss  Rifle,  a  "Tech  Brief" on information
processing,  Traveller  Q\'s  &  A\'s,  and  a  couple  informative
articles  for  use  with  GDW\'s  2300  game  ("An Overview of the
American Arm" and "Exploration: American Style").
 
 
 
* Special  Note:  In Travellers\' Digest  #17, in  the Grand  Tour
Feature Adventure "The Blade of Koiyehk", it is revealed that the
Aslan are  not a Major Race!  Not only did they  not discover the
jump-drive  for  themselves,  but  they  learned  about  it  from
humans!) Their honor would certainly be threatened if this secret
were  to become  public  knowledge.  Will our  hearty adventurers
escape with the secret and their lives? (Cliffhanger ending...).
 
:)
 
I hope I\'ve been of help.
 
Food for thought,
 
Roger Sanger

Subject: Getting DGP stuff reprinted?
Status: R

Hi there,
    Since your the fellow with all the copyrights for DGP... I have to ask.
What are your chances of getting all that stuff reprinted?  There\'s a bunch of
stuff from DGP I never got a chance to get and I\'d happily pay to pick up
reprints of the stuff.  Not to mention that it would instantly boost sales of
T4 to have all that support matterial out there as well.

Stephen

Dear Stephen,
 
The managers of Traveller seem  very enthusiastic about DGP being
involved in  the development of  Traveller once again,  including
the possibility of  DGP archiving all of its  material on CD-ROM.
They have remained enthusiastic throughout our negotiations.
 
Unfortunately (or quite fortunately, dependending on how you look
at it)  the managers of Traveller  have their hands full  and are
extremely  busy.  This  means  they  are  working  hard  to  make
Traveller  the best  that it  can  be  -- something  we will  all
benefit  from.  I\'m  thoroughly  impressed  with  what  I\'ve seen
(including what\'s going on behind-the-scenes).
 
As for  placing a % probability  on DGP\'s chances of  getting the
official  go-ahead, it\'s  more a  matter of  when rather than how
likely, and  that\'s anybody\'s guess.  Though I\'m sure Marc Miller
and his associates will get around to us just as soon as they are
able to.
 
Keep your fingers crossed.
 
Sincerely,
 
Roger Sanger

     This would, of course, be just too cool.  Does this include the 
     possibility of finishing things that wasn\'t finished (the rest of the 
     Alien books, for example) or just the previously released stuff.
     
     Would the info being re-released be changed to use the new T4 rules or 
     the MT rules set?  How \'bout the new stuff?
     
     If the new stuff is to use the MT rules, could you add conversions for 
     use with MT (heck, I\'ll even volunteer to do those conversions).

Greetings Sapient!
This printed guide is an abstract of Imperial Publication 03-8462872, "Guide
to Supplies, Consumables and Trade Opportunities in the Imperium". It
contains information compiled from over 70 trade and survey expeditions to
worlds that have been out of contact with the Imperium for over 1000 years.
While each world is unique, certain technological developments have been
fairly predictable. This publication lists that subset of items which
explorers have found most useful to have on hand for convenience or trade
purposes, and those which have been most commonly encountered on other
worlds, and which are of note either for economic potential, hazard or
curiousity\'s sake.

This guide is broken down into the following cross-linked sections:
 Imperial Surplus
 Personal protective gear
 Exploration tools
 Personal mobility
 Communications
 Commercial goods (uncategorized)
 Vehicles (plus design tools)

Full specifications, suppliers and case histories of use for any item can be
downloaded via references in this guide for a nominal fee. Mention of an item
in this abstract does not imply endorsement by an Imperial agency or any
guarantee of performance, either express or implied. All comments by end
users are guaranteed to be representative of the majority opinion for the
relevant item, but are not guaranteed to be reliable. Individual reference
locators are current at the time of download in case personal contact is
desired.

In game terms, this abstract is a single sheet of paper that can be
downloaded from any general purpose Sylean news kiosk for the cost of 5Cr.
The full specifications and contact list is 50Cr, but purchasers of the
abstract get a 5Cr discount.

LAV-10
The LAV-10 is a tracked utility vehicle superceded by fusion-powered antigrav
units and removed from secondary service in year -21. Normal role was as
prime mover, non-combat troop transport or light weapons platform. 

The Central Storage Depot at Port Sidon has a large number of LAV-10 utility
vehicles for sale for export or metals reclamation. No warranty is expressed
or implied as to usability except for a guaranteed recyclable mass of 3,600kg
per unit. LAV-10 units are available for 2500Cr each in minimum quantities of
10 and have a shipping mass of approximately 6,000kg each.

The surplus LAV-10\'s may be missing tracks, engines or instrumentation. While
they are sealed for use with life support, it is not currently installed, and
while wiring and data paths for military electronics are intact, all sensors
and communications gear has been removed. On average, five units can be
disassembled to get one LAV-10 in good used condition and a lot of spare
parts. This process will take about 200 man-hours in a vehicle repair shop,
and this time can include retrofitting with a Fusion+ unit for an additional
1500Cr in parts and labor.

EVA-11
Current manufacture hostile environment suit, applicable for industrial work
in zero-g, vacuum, or non-breathable environments. It contains state of the
art systems to increase the safety and efficiency of the unit and costs
approximately 100KCr new. Used or reconditioned units may be available from
mining or construction companies for a discount of up to 60%, but may be
close to or past their warranted operational lifetime of 2000 hours use. The
normal suit masses 100kg, which includes a current manufacture Fusion+ unit
and antigrav harness so that when activated it has zero weight. However, its
mass is still significant and should be taken into account.

The EVA-11 has full atmosphere support for the minimum 72 hour duration of
the power plant fuel, sufficient fluid reserves for 48 hours of normal
consumption and sanitary hookups for similar duration, provided they are
attached. Normal entry is accomplished from the back, takes only a few
minutes and can be done wearing normal clothes. However, a special EVA
undersuit ("suit skivvies") is recommended for long-duration use to avoid
chafing and blisters (-1DM to Intelligence from distraction after 6 hours
without them). 

Performance figures vary by manufacturer of EVA suits, but the EVA-11 is
capable of 2g acceleration, has continental range communications (nominal
range 3,000km), transponder, inertial navigation and autopilot, a full suite
of on-board environmental sensors including multispectrum visual and
discriminatory audio, built-in biomonitoring, self-sealing of punctures, and
a flexible outer shell for micrometeroid protection, with a rigid optically
compensated helmet (armor rating of 3). Note that non-penetrating impacts may
cause damage to the fabric, thermal distribution and insulation underlayers
of the suit. Acquire documentation of authorized repair of any apparent
damage to a used suit you wish to purchase. This will be listed in the
service record of the suit\'s log computer.

The wearer of an EVA-11 or equivalent suit takes a -2DM on all Dexterity
tasks due to the mass and thickness of the suit, and -3DM to Endurance tasks
if forced to use the suit in a gravity well (contragrav may negate the suit
weight so that you do not have to walk, but you still have to move the heavy
arms and legs of the suit under your own power). If they do not have Vac
suit-0 or better, any action taken in combat requires an Average task on
their default to avoid a fumble or mishap.

"If you want to make yourself look impressive and be easier to spot on ship\'s
sensors, I recommend the reflec option. It doesn\'t affect performance much,
and most outfits doing mining or construction with heavy lasers get their
EVA\'s that way from the factory. It adds some cost, but it\'s cheaper than
paying off death or dismemberment benefits."

Neural Activity Sensor-13
Developed from tech level 12 psionic helmet theory, the neural activity
sensor (NAS) was first used medically. It remotely detects the electrical
activity of a life form\'s central nervous system and classifies it according
to amount and complexity. The data system compares the activity pattern to
known types of life, especially intelligent life. The unit requires some
skill to properly calibrate and operate, but once normal lifeform readings
for an area are gathered, an on-board expert system aids classification and
interpretation of data.

Detecting complex neurological activity in a target area is handled as a fire
combat task with a short range weapon (which may be aimed). This works vs. a
specific area the size of an outdoor square. Scanning a 30x arc is a -3DM and
aiming does not apply. In areas with a high density of life, the NAS may be
set to a certain threshold, which corresponds more or less to the size of the
creature (within 50%).

The portable unit consists of a backpack and a handset with a retractable
parabolic dish focuser. The handset in fact is not attached to the backpack,
and it can be operated up to 100 meters distant, which further extends the
range. The NAS runs off a pair of .5kg battery packs, which last for up to 20
hours of use. An optional scanning head (2500Cr) will allow unattended use of
the NAS (with an effective skill of 6) and scans a 30x arc per turn (the -3DM
is taken into account). These units are not available on Sylea, but limited
manufacture on other worlds has been reported.

****

Grav belt-12
Contragrav technology has finally reached a point where personal "jump belts"
are possible. These consist of a body harness and several contragrav moduules
arrayed around the body, with a small left or right hand mounted control
stick near the waist, and a power pack usually mounted near the lower back.
To get the low thrust and fine precision required, a dedicated computer
interface is used in conjunction with sensitive inertial sensors. Otherwise
the belt would only be capable of full thrust (3g) or none at all. The grav
belt is controlled partially by use of the stick, and partially by the wearer
shifting their weight. While a grav belt can be used in zero-g conditions
(within 1 planetary diameter), the lower of zero-g or grav belt skill is used
to reflect the increased difficulty. Top speed of a normal grav belt is
around 280m/turn or 168kph, with a normal endurance of 1000 hours between
refuelings and maintenance.

Increases in technology will increase the performance and decrease the mass
of the belt, but operation remains largely the same. Typical options
available at all TL\'s include:

Voice interface - Allows hands-free control of the grav belt, but lacks the
fine precision of manual control. Adds 500Cr to cost.

Roadgrid interface - Required for use in Sylean metropolitan areas. Includes
voice interface and remote control to automatically take you to your
destination. Adds 1000Cr to cost.

Emergency parachute - In the event of catastrophic failure, the single-use
parachute will deploy fully at any altitude of 100 meters or more, and the
user will usually only suffer minor injury (1D damage, armor does not
protect). Adds 500Cr to cost and 3kg to mass.

Backup power supply - A high-discharge battery capable of powering the grav
belt for 30 seconds (6 turns) in the event the main power plant fails.
Standard feature, no extra cost or mass.

Companions-12
These are a fairly recent development of the robot-makers art, and fall more
under the heading of androids. They are fully anthropomorphic robots designed
around an artificial duplicate of the human (or other) skeleton and
musculature, giving them a very realistic appearance and movement pattern.
Linked by several Comm channels to a central computer, they are capable of
mimicing human behavior in a variety of fields with the exception of eating
and drinking. Note that this is not in any sense an artificial intelligence,
but a very adaptable expert program system. The high cost of development and
programming has limited the market for Companions, and it is expected they
will remain a luxury item for the forseeable future. Purchase price includes
a 1 year warranty on all parts and software, and yearly maintenance contracts
are 25KCr per year.

Companion-12 80 liters 80kg 250KCr

<sidebar>
In game terms, a Companion is detectable as artificial on an Average
intelligence or Engineering task, modified by any visual obscurement like
heavy clothing, helmet, etc. At higher TL\'s, the difficulty of this task will
increase. Stationary, they appear very lifelike, but when moving, the very
subtle differences become apparent to humans who have seen "the real thing"
all their lives. A Companion\'s stats are 7695-0. Intelligence represents the
flexibility of the programming. Education is irrelevant, as a Companion has
access to any information available on its central computer (or on the global
net if on Sylea). This computer has a rating of 4 for purposes of mimicing
human behavior, and a rating of 2 for general purpose tasks. The processor
inside the Companion is a specialized rating of 2, just for communications
with the central computer. Companions may be controlled by a virtual reality
harness, though this is not a standard option. Social Standing is always 0,
as they are not considered anything more than a fancy tool. For accomplishing
complex tasks or using skills, Companions can have any Dexterity skill at +1,
and any Intelligence skill at +2, so long as the task does not require
genuine creativity (note that "Acting" could be the Intelligence skill,
making the  "hey, it\'s a robot!" check have a -2DM. Normally a Companion
comes with up to 4 skills, and more can be acquired at the cost of 10-20KCr
each, as they are exceedingly complex programming tasks to develop, and any
skill which does not have a mass-market application will cost at least
100KCr, as it will be developed just for that single customer. If access to
its central computer is lost, the Companion is not capable of independent
action, and will usually remain stationary and power down except for
communications links.

Legally, Companions have no status, and like any other tool, the owner is
responsible for any misuse. So, while a Companion is sophisticated enough to
go out and buy your groceries, if it hits someone with your car, you will be
the one charged with manslaughter or negligent homicide. Current laws
regarding robotics are applied to Companions. No cases that touch on their
unique complexity have come to trial, but in this eventuality, changes or
modifications to existing law are expected.

For combat purposes, a Companion is treated as a character with the
appropriate skills. They have an inherent armor of 1 for purposes of being
impaired, although any damage may mar their synthetic flesh. They do not take
blunt trauma damage, and are only rendered "unconscious" when Endurance (i.e.
power source) is reduced to zero. They are immune to vacuum, water depths up
to 2 atmospheres, and can tolerate corrosive and insidious atmospheres for
several hours, though all of the above will affect their synthetic skin.

Dear Traveller Afficionados and TML\'ers,
 
It  has  never  been  the  intention  of  MM  or  DGP to create a
situation in which background for the game was barred from future
reference in the game.
 
That is, DGP was given an  open hand to draw upon GDW\'s Traveller
materials, and in return gave MM and his associates equal freedom
to design new Traveller game  materials based upon the background
presented in  DGP\'s works. DGP  entered into this  agreement with
the  full  awareness  that  Marc\'s  rights  of  derivation  would
continue even  after DGP\'s right  to publish game  material under
the  Traveller trademark  expired.
 
Of  course,  the  scope  of  the  agreement  was  limited  to the
publication  of  materials  for  the  Traveller role-playing game
market. Any use of DGP\'s materials outside that market by Marc or
his associates would require a new agreement with DGP.
 
 
Under this  arrangement, once something  integral to the  setting
was created  -- such as  a key person  (the Emperor, a  planetary
leader, the head of a  major regional corporation, etc.), a piece
of equipment, a class of ships, a planet (or culture, government,
or organization),  etc. -- these  things could be  represented in
new game works because they comprised the background of the game,
that  is, they  DEFINED THE  MILIEU. The  text and  illustrations
themselves could  not be reprinted,  but any idea  that fell into
the category of "background" could  be drawn upon in the creation
of new Traveller game products.
 
The notable  exception to the reprint  restriction concerns data.
Most  of  the  data  presented  in  the  game  consists  of  pure
background,  and can\'t  be presented   in any  other way  than by
reprinting it  verbatim. Planet names, UWP\'s,  sector data lists,
ship  class  names,  ship  statistics,  and  other  data  can  be
reprinted directly in new Traveller  game products (by Marc or by
whomever he designates).
 
The  copyright  limitations  mostly  concern  foreground.  Player
characters, adventures, NPCs  insignificant to the superstructure
of  the milieu,  their personal  activities, specific encounters,
etc. Even though  these persons and events could  be mentioned in
passing,  neither MM  nor DGP  would ever  consider reworking  an
adventure  done  by  the  other,  or  making  use  of  their star
characters, without getting permission first.
 
As you can see, the distinction between foreground and background
material  is highly  subjective, and  relies upon  the trust  and
goodwill between  the parties involved.  For instance, throw-away
references  were  often  picked  up  and  fleshed  out in greater
detail, even some that could be identified as "foreground".
 
One  thing you  need to  understand about  Marc is  that he takes
pride in being the creator and leader of Traveller, and we at DGP
have always found him to be a fair and honorable ruler. You don\'t
have  anything  to  worry  about.  Marc\'s  main  concern  is  the
happiness of his customers and followers.
 
We at  DGP are very  happy that Marc  is in control  of Traveller
once again, and we feel that it is a position he truly deserves.
 
Sincerely,
 
Roger Sanger

I can\'t take you off the list because I\'m just a list recipient like
you. You have to take yourself off by sending the right command to the
right address.

You sent the right command, but you sent it to the wrong address.

The right address is:

This is a message I got from LISTPROC, it may help you:

To unsubscribe to xboat, send the command:

unsubscribe xboat

in the body of a message to "traveller-request@MPGN.COM".  If you want
to subscribe something other than the account the mail is coming from,
such as a local redistribution list, then append that address to the
"subscribe" command; for example, to subscribe "local-traveller":

subscribe xboat local-traveller@your.domain.net

A digest version of this list is also available; to
subscribe to that instead, replace all instances of "xboat"
in the commands above with "xboat-digest".

Think of it as ablative armour for your ship. Any energy discharge through
it is forced to vapourise the sand before it can vapourise the ship.

Personally though, I like to use it as an anti-personnel weapon while
dirtside. :)

Book Three? Which version of Traveller are you using?


>Is the sand shot in space to form a shield or is it shot at an enemy
>target to protect against their shots?

IIRC, in Classic Traveller when sandcasters are fired a cannister
full of ablative particles is ejected into space and a cloud of
ablative particles forms (nominally between the defending ship and
the attacking ship). This cloud travels with the defending ship until
that ship changes its vector at which point the cloud either breaks
up or continues along the original vector depending on whether or
not you want to keep track of it on the playing area.

Later versions of the Traveller space combat system change how all of 
this works.

>But what is the area of effect for a single sand shot?

I used DM -3 per cannister (rightly or wrongly :-). I don\'t recall
what the Traveller game "Mayday" (long out of print) has to say
about all of this.


>Also, if a ship travels through a field of sand does it take damage?

Certainly possible, but I can\'t find a rule about this in CT. So as 
far as the rules are concerned, it\'s probably safe to ignore (unless, 
of course, it lead the players into an interesting adventure -- in 
which case, have at it!).

Shot into space around your ship.

I think that sand covered the hex your ship was in when you fired it.
And it kept moving with the vector your ship had when you fired it.
Thus if you manuevered, you\'d leave the sand cloud behind, following
your old course. Note that "manuevering" includes accelerating in the
same direction..

I don\'t think they assumed a ship wouldn\'t take damage, but to be
realistic, I\'d say that it depends on how fast the ship is moving.
Obviously, sand can\'t damage your ship, so that means that moving thru
it at a relative velocity of 6 (ie doing a 6 g burn to get out of the
cloud you\'ve released) has to be harmless. For anything faster, there
should be damage. How much is a good question.

Note that a lot of the above is based on the Mayday rules, which made
things a bit clearer.

Bruce,

This issue with sensors has been IHMO wrong. To arrive at FCS(Fire Control
Solution) you only need three things -Bearing, Angle Theta, And Range
Rate(Rate in which target is/is not closing to the firer). You do not need
to resolve?(not a FC term) to hit a target. 

With Passive EMS it seems to me that everyone is fixated on the IR spectrum.
A Passive EMS sensor will weight in heavily other emissions that a target
might have such a 1 Gigahertz emission when the HELPAR/Thruster Plate drive
is used, the change in frequency when the drive changes speed. A Passive EMS
sensor could also pick the toilet being flushed so too speak, or even your
communications gear in standby mode. We might look at vehicles as to what
emmissions it might have.

A vehicle (Space or not) emitates vast amounts of Emmissions across many
spectrums. If you say that such emmissions are to faint, by todays tech your
WRONG. Today police can tell if you have a radar detector in vehicle just
simple piece of electronics. Do you now how much emmissions your radar
detector puts out lets say it in the milliwatt range, the police can detect
them at over a mile. Today from some satellites, very faint emmissions
(picowatt range), can be detected from orbit to within half a meter. EMM
will reduce but not eliminate a vehicles emmissions. The only way to stop
the emmissions is to turn off the source.

AS for missile a Semi Active homer homes in on the reflected emmissions off
the target. The source of the reflected emmissions could the firing ship or
another. As for how the missile deciding when to detonate, today a lot of
missiles use "Doppler Rolloff" to detect when to go boom. What is "Doppler
Rolloff", well we are all familiar with it, say a ambulance is approaching
you, you hear the siren, after it goes past you, the siren seems to have
changed sound that it makes. 

Also passive sensors always will have greater range than active. But passive
require a greater tracking time to arrive at FCS.

IMHO the only way to use missiles in combat is to use all the different
types ie KKM, Nuke Det Laser, Nuke Contact, and Explosive Contact. If you do
not I design a point defense system that will stop it cold. 

As to the debate on limiting Thruster plate drive it to certain size, it
will not work, people on this list have already given very good examples. If
you feel that thruster plate missiles will be over powering, there is an
elegant solution, use a Grav Sensor. A high acceleration thruster plate will
distort the local gravity scene in proportion to the amount of G\'s that the
missile is accelerating. The greater the distortion the greater range it can
be detected.

Certain EW gear that we have today can track, classify, and evaluate a
target in less time than you would believe. All from extremely small
emmissions that a target gives off.

Nice post, Leonard.  I\'ve been following this discussion to get my own brain thinking in 
the right direction about sandcasters, and as I remember, you are right.

I must also say that I like the improvement in T4 where the sand particles are 
magnetised so that the sand cloud can be moved with the ship by a magnetic beam (and, I 
assume, the highest desity of the cloud can be placed between the ship and incoming 
fire).

In my universe, I think I\'ll use both ideas.  One is for lower tech ships, and one is 
for higher tech ships.  Just like Heplar and thruster plates.

Kenneth.

I\'ve got a friend who\'s been collecting comics, and for years, he\'s been buying many
from this guy who operates out of his house.  So, I\'m with my friend the other day, and
he decides to stop by the comic guy\'s place to get his monthly fix.  I\'m there for the
first time, and what do I find?

Traveller Stuff!  Yes, beautiful, mint condition, never been purchased before, original
CT Traveller Stuff.  I was in heaven.

I purchased all he had.

I got the first edition of Snapshot, unopened, still in the wrapper!  I just love it.
Ain\'t life grand?

The guy said life is funny that way.  He\'s had it since it was published in 1979.  It\'s
been through two stores that he\'s owned, and nobody has ever bought it.  He saw how
flabbergasted I was, and he mentioned that it was just ironic that he\'s had it all these
years only to have it fall into the hands of a true Traveller fan--someone who can
really appreciate it.

Well, I\'ve filled in some missing holes in my collection, and I let my gaming group pick
their spoils.  To my dismay, I still have some items left.

And, like my Snapshot boxed set, I thought that I would give these wonderful pieces of
literature a chance to find a home with someone who would really appreciate them.

What better place to do this than on the Traveller Mailing List?

So, sharpen your pencils for your Christmas lists, I\'m going to do my first Traveller
Auction.

All items (but one) are in mint condition.  The auction will last until November 21st,
and I\'ll post updates at least once per week.  Only US currency can be accepted, and
postage will be over and above the bid price.

E-mail all bids to me directly at dreamer@brokersys.com.  If two equal bids are sent,
then I will look at the time sent as the deciding factor.  The auction is open to
everyone, and you don\'t have to be on this list to bid.

Chris,

I don\'t know.  Tractor beam, magnetic projector?

I guess I worry about that the first time my group gets into a nasty space battle.

We are selling Mining Claims and Deeds to mine the asteroid belt. You

of a star that you select. As the first homsteader you get to name the
star.

A gag? Of course, but still a nice gift. Our certificate is printed on

Marc Miller

Specimen data for Vland Sector for inclusion in First Survey (circa Year 0)
(accompanies Sector Map).
Best viewed in Courier (monospaced font).

This data reflects the information currently (Year 0) available in AAB. World
Size, Atmosphere, and Hydrographics have not changed for worlds in the
sector. Blanks indicate Starport, Population, Government, Law Level, and Tech
Level (all of which cannot be reliably determined after more than 1,700 years
of Long Night). Historical names are reflected, although they may have
changed. The referee has two options: generate the missing world data using
T4 (and enter it in the listing); or consult the more complete data for the
territory (provided online).

At the same time, there is available some world data which is reasonably
current. This information (which is available to any travellers who inquire
at the data base or library or starport) is reflected (for example) in the
entry for world 0921. This entry shows complete information.

Players (groups, ship crews, etc) can enter the data in their own copy of the
Survey as well as record the routes their exploratory voyages take.

Vland data file is missing some stellar data and gas giant information, which
produces the anomalously low Gas Giant presences.

This example reflects only a partial list in order to conserve file space.
This is not the final run, so some data (including names) may change. Names
ending in a period(.) are newly generated; original names do not end in
period.

Guy Garnett was kind enough to give us some values for converting T4
armor ratings into thicknesses of steel plate. I asked him to do this
and promised this list a table for converting High Guard and Striker
armor values to T4\'s. Here it is.

This is for those of us who want to run T4 games with all the
equipment we used in previous (CT) games.

Note that my High Guard armor values are different from those that Guy
posted. This is because the language used in the Striker errata was
ambiguous; it can be interpreted in two different ways.

The columns are:

1) The striker penetration value. This number is roughly compatable to
the penetration value found in MegaTraveller.

2) The High Guard armor USP rating as interpreted by me (Rob).

3) The High Guard armor USP as interpreted by Guy (Wildstar).

4) The T4 personal armor rating (in dice).

5) The QSDS and RPSC armor rating from T4\'s Universal Ship Profiles.

(Note: This table contains Tabs. Tabbing is set to 8 spaces.)

FORMULAS:

There are formulas for converting these armor values to the equivalent
thickness in steel plate. I used these formulas to make these tables.
"A" is the armor value. "T" is the thickness in centimeters of steel.

*** Striker Penetration:

Striker uses 1 inch steel plate as its standard. For armor less than 1 inch
thick, Striker uses a linear progression with A=10 equal to 1 inch. So
A=1 is one tenth of an inch and so on. For armor thicker than an inch,
Striker uses an octave binary progression (it doubles in steps of eight)
so 18 = 2 inches, 26 = 4 inches, 34 = 8 inches, etc.

For penetration values less than ten, the thickness in cm of steel
is:

T = 0.25 * A

For values of "A" larger than 10, then "T" is:

T = 2.5 cm * 2^( (A - 10)/8 )

where the "^" sign is the exponential operator (like in BASIC),
equivalent to FORTRAN\'s "**".

*** High Guard:

High Guard uses a one to one correlation with Striker as shown on
the tables. Because of vaguely worded errata, there are (at least)
two interpretations for conversion, as was noted above.

*** T4 personal combat

As Guy mentioned, T4 uses the following formula:

T = (A/6)^3

*** QSDS Armor

For values of "A" smaller than 30:

T = 10 * 2^(A/10)

For values of "A" larger than 30:

T = 4 * A - 40

Hope this helps all the other old CT holdouts on this
list 8^).

I wrote a  detailed letter about DGP\'s  copyright policies on TML
awhile back  (with which Marc Miller  concurred), but there still
seems  to be  some lingering  confusion concerning  the matter in
public  Traveller  discussions,  so  I\'ll  clarify  the situation
again.  I think you are going to love this:
 
MARC  MILLER HAS  DGP\'S PERMISSION  to use  background data  (UWP
lists,  planet names,  sector  maps,  etc.) from  DGP\'s Traveller
works  in  any  way  that  he  sees  fit  in  printed Traveller 4
publications!
 
In addition, Marc  Miller has been given a free  hand to dip into
DGP\'s Traveller archives for inspiration in developing background
material for  his new incarnation  of the Traveller  role-playing
game. This way, he can keep  Traveller 4 consistent with what has
come before!!!
 
The  races  (the  Geonee,  the  Brinn,  etc.), the places (Vland,
Shudusham,  Capital), and  the things  (robots, equipment,  etc.)
which  you loved  from DGP\'s   works still  exist in  the overall
Traveller  milieu.  I  don\'t  believe  Marc  has any intention of
changing this  (he\'s DGP\'s number  one fan!).
 
Traveller has been around a long time, and it would be a shame to
invalidate the thousands of pages  that have been written for the
milieu. Marc knows what he\'s doing, and he knows what you love. A
lot of  what has come before  will not exist in  Milieu Zero, but
the future has not been erased. ;)
 
And the best years are yet to come.
 
Sincerely,
 
Roger Sanger

A Note on Magazines:  While additional issues of many listed magazines 
(i.e., Travellers\' Digest, JTAS (as Challenge), etc.) were produced, 
they are not included here because those issues contained material related
to games other than Classic Traveller, even though they did contain some 
material usable in the Classic Traveller system.  This is also the reason 
certain issues of Space Gamer, Dragon Magazine, and others are not listed.
