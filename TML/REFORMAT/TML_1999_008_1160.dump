If the rampart engages the tank, true.  What I meant was that the Rampart
need never come into range of the tank since it\'s LOS weapons are nearly
useless here, anyway...  With standoff weapons OTOH, the two can hurt
eachother, if they can overwhelm the point defense enough.

ROFLMAO!

That settles it.  I\'m going to revise the chargen tables to include
Golf with \'elite\' careers, especially Noble.  They need something
to go with Fencing and Equestrian.

And Clubs, will now be a mustering out benefit.

Can anyone design a robot caddy with built-in shade and wetbar?

Without resorting to too much math, you can sort of fake it.

The quick and dirty solution is to take the central (continuous) 
band of triangles on the Traveller map and calling that 30
degrees north latitude to 30 degrees south. Each polar 
section is 360/5 or 72 degrees of longitude; the north polar 
and south polar divisions are offset by 36 degrees from one 
another. Draw lines on the globe corresponding to those
angles, and interpolate the stuff in between.

Each of the polar equilateral triangles on the original map 
becomes an isoceles triangle with (according to some quick 
excel work that I won\'t duplicate here) lengths of 1, 1, and 
1.018074 (i.e. the latitude line is nearly 2% too long). 

If you don\'t care about the nice round latitudes, set the 
continuous-band angle to N/S 26.56 (actually arccos( squareroot 
(20) / 5) degrees latitude, and *don\'t* ask me how I figured
that out); this makes the triangles essentially equilateral.

For most purposes, the icosahedron is a good approximation 
to a sphere, as you found by taping it together. :)

Actually, most of the stuff in interstellar space will be moving at least
several km/sec.  Anything that\'s escaped from a solar system will be moving
MUCH faster, and no one really knows how big it will be.

What do you mean by "big"? Also, IIRC, H-->He fusion requires pressure as
well as high-velocity particles.  Without containment, it would be my guess
that little energy benefit would result, as the EMR front would be
dispersing the H faster than optimal for fusion.

Another note, several people have mentioned that hydrogen snowballs would be
easy to keep in intersteller space.  Since apperently most nebulae consist
of GASEOUS H, this supposition might not be true.  At the very least, shade
from cosmic rays would be necessary, and if my astrophysics are correct,
individual photons striking the snowball would impart enough energy to casue
individual molecules to sublimate- thus eventually causing the whole thing
to disappear.  I am not sure, however, how long this would take.

IIRC, per High Guard 2nd Edition, 20% flicker is 20% on-time, 
80% off; no explanation is given for why 100% on is always 
achievable (incidentally, the flicker rate depends on 
model number in HG2, not directly on TL). 

IIRC, the flicker rate is described as something like
"many times per second"; the implication is that you don\'t
get to choose when it\'s on (so no easy intercepts) and the 
effect is as if it were "partially transparent".

from http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/Quarters/3521/Hrecite.html
RECITATION OF THE BATTLE OF CAMERONE 
This battle took place on the 30th of April 1863, during the campaign of
Mexico. It is celebrated each year, on the anniversary of this date, by all
the regiments of the French Foreign Legion. 
History: 
The French Army was besieging Puebla. 
The mission of the Legion was to ensure the movement and safety of the
convoys, over an 80 mile distance. On the 29th of April 1863, Colonel
Jeanningros was informed that an important convoy was on its way to Puebla,
with a load of 3 million francs, and material and munitions for the seige.
Captain Danjou, his quartermaster, decided to send a company to escort the
convoy. The 3rd company of the Foreign Regiment was assigned to this
mission, but had no officers available. So Captain Danjou, himself, took the
command and 2nd lieutenants Maudet, company guide, and Vilain, the
paymaster, joined him voluntarily. 
On the 30th of April, at 1 a.m., the 3rd company was on its way, with its 3
officers and 62 men. At 7 a.m., after a 15 mile march, it stopped at Palo
Verde in order to get some rest. At this very moment, the enemy showed up
and the battle began. Captain Danjou made the company take up a square
formation and, even though retreating, he victoriously drove back several
cavalry charges, inflicting the first heavy losses on the enemy . 
By the inn of Camerone, a large building with a courtyard protected by a
wall 3 meters high, Danjou decided to stay, in order to keep the enemy and
so delay for as long as possible, any attacks on the convoy. 
While the legionnaires were rapidly setting up the defense of the inn, a
Mexican officer demanded that Captain Danjou surrender, pointing out the
fact that the Mexican Army was greatly superior in number. 
Danjou\'s answer was: "We have munitions. We will not surrender." Then, he
swore to fight to the death and made his men swear the same. It was 10 a.m.
Until 6 p.m., these 60 men who had had nothing to eat or drink since the day
before, in spite of the extreme heat, of the thirst and hunger, resisted
against 2,000 Mexicans: 800 cavalry and 1,200 infantry. 
At noon, Captain Danjou was shot in the chest and died. At 2 p.m., 2nd
lieutenant Vilain was shot in the head. About this time, the Mexican colonel
succeeded in setting the inn on fire. 
In spite of the heat and the smoke, the legionnaires resisted, but many of
them were killed or injured. By 5 p.m., only 12 men could still fight with
2nd lieutenant Maudet. At this time, the Mexican colonel gathered his
soldiers and told them what disgrace it would be if they were unable to
defeat such a small number of men. The Mexicans were about to give the
general assault through holes opened in the walls of the courtyard, but
Colonel Milan, who had previously asked 2nd lieutenant Maudet to surrender,
once again gave him the opportunity to. Maudet scornfully refused. 
The final charge was given. Soon, only 5 men were left around Maudet;
Corporal Maine, legionnaires Catteau, Wensel, Constantin and Leonard. Each
had only one bullet left. In a corner of the courtyard, their back against
the wall, still facing the enemy, they fixed bayonets. When the signal was
given, they opened fire and fought with their bayonets. 2nd lieutenant
Maudet and 2 legionnaires fell, mortally wounded. Maine and his 2 remaining
companions were about to be slaughtered when a Mexican officer saved them.
He shouted: "Surrender"! 
"We will only if you promise to allow us to carry and care for our injured
men and if you leave us our guns". 
"Nothing can be refused to men like you"!, answered the officer. 
Captain Danjou\'s men had kept their promise; for 11 hours, they had resisted
2,000 enemy troops. They had killed 300 of them and had injured as many.
Their sacrifice had saved the convoy and they had fulfilled their mission. 
Emperor Napoleon the 3rd decided that the name of Camerone would be written
on the flag of the Foreign Regiment and the names of Danjou, Vilain and
Maudet would be engraved in golden letters on the walls of the Invalides, in
Paris. 
Moreover, a monument was built in 1892, at the very place of the fight. The
following inscription can be read there :
HERE, THEY WERE LESS THAN SIXTY 
AGAINST A WHOLE ARMY 
ITS MASS CRUSHED THEM 
BUT LIFE RATHER THAN COURAGE 
ABANDONED THESE FRENCH SOLDIERS 
THE 30TH OF APRIL 1863. 
TO THEIR MEMORY THE NATION BUILT THIS MONUMENT. 
Since then, when Mexican troops pass by the monument, they present arms.

The Imperium generally controls at least one port in every system.
This is almost always the best one, but I don\'t think there is any
rule on it.  Ports outside of Imperial control are generally
space ports for insystem traffic.  Of course, for example on thigs
like private worlds, this starts to become irrelvant.

This is going to be covered under GURPS Traveller: Starports.  I
think that port directors generaly cooperate with local authorities,
but are not obligated to.

I sounds like you are talking about "demountable tanks" where
you take them with you (and they count against displacement)
and the get rid of them later.  These don\'t have the problems
that drop tanks do.

>How can the ship jump within 10 diameters of the drop tank?

They can\'t.  The point is that you get 100 diams away before
you jump.

You can\'t jump safely near these either....

I don\'t think so.  I certainly don\'t recall any expamples.

It certainly is inconsitent with how the 100 diam limit is
protrayed.

A few notable disasters pushes them back into R&D in 1106 (canon, even for 
GT, BtC sidebar, pg 6).  "Years" to reverse the severe stock decline and 
means no major commercial line adopts them, either.  (same GT source).  14 
years of various R&D and improvement on "capacitor engineering" maybe they\'ll 
start to come back eventually.  By the time of a GTL13 Third Imperium, why 
shouldn\'t drop tank shipping be the norm?  Just because you don\'t want it to? 
 When it doesn\'t have to have any effect on your campaign (unless they 
compete regularly w/ the megacorps)?

You must\'ve missed that debate.  ;-)  Besides J-6 X-boats are supposed to be 
in the works.

At which point they liquidate their ships and lacking a bank payment, the new

out of business before they\'ve really gotten going.  How long will that buy 
us, David? :-)

Which ignores the question asked.  Why can\'t you even *try* to find a way for 
drop tanks to work, instead of laying a case for why they don\'t.  You can\'t 
come up w/ a couple more disasters or serious flaws in drop tank tech that 
pushes them off from mass usage before 1130 or so, saving your campaigns from 
the Doom That Is Drop Tanks?

The problem with the "zap from orbit" scenario is why use a fighter at all?
For that matter, why use a grav tank?

If all grav based vehicles can be pinpointed and destroyed by orbital fire,
no on ewill build or buy grav tanks.

If a fighter can destroy a grav vehicle from orbit, why not use a destroyer
or close escort (or whatever) which, gun for gun and ton for ton, is a
cheaper solution under any design system (except, perhaps, G:T which I am
not familiar with).

My view of these facts leads me to conclude that either;

1). Grav Vehicles are only used when combating lower tech enemies, or
enemies with no space support.

or

2). Grav Vehicles are "Stealthy" enough that a pinpoint sensor lock from
orbital ranges is not possible.

Either of these allows the presence of Grav vehicles without dramatically
changing the face of the "canon" traveller universe.  Since I believe the
Army played an important role in the Fifth Frontier War, I will choose to
believe number 1 above.

Average of *2* fleets per subsector (1 regular, 1 colonial), but the Domain

Higher jump ships still have a much higher initial cost, which puts them out 
of reach of the average small timer.  There is very little to say that the 
megacorps are NOT using bulk drop tank freighters for the majority of 
shipping.

If the internal tankage ship companies are driven out of business (more 
likely than driven onto less economic routes, after all aren\'t they optimized 
for the routes they\'re on, as far as profitability, etc?), the ships can be 
sold at under cost and lacking a equal payment can undercut the price drop 
tank shipping can (who\'s ships must be new and being payed off).  This will 
certainly delay things a bit.

Hardly.  From the very beginning (If JTAS 2 doesn\'t qualify, what does?), 
there have been serious doubts shed on their actual safety and effectiveness. 
 The only design that has them has a miserable reputation in the IN.  It\'s 
easy to come up w/ more disasters and more and more dubious megacorps 
deciding to stick w/ "proven" technology rather than risk the fortunes of 
General and Tukera (big stock and profit drops all around for the only 
canonical mentions of j-tanks, remember?).

Not really.  It\'s comparable to LASH in complexity, which itself isn\'t viable 
against "standard" shipping on the main routes.  That also assumes everyone 
is using standardized drop tanks.  Which would make sense after awhile, but 
not initially as there would be competing designs and sizes.  Also a small 
ships drop tanks are going to be useless for a large ships (say <1000 dt vs 
10,000+ dt).  

On a Free Trader\'s scale, noone has addressed what would happen on an 
unprofitable, much less diasterous run where new drop tankage can\'t be 
afforded, much less a misjump to a low tech world.

No they didn\'t.  The numbers gave a drop tank and non drop tank equipped ship 
of otherwise equivalent design a 25% jump.  That was at J2 IIRC.  It does 
increase per jump number, but the cost of drop tank recovery and refurbishing 
was not.  I\'m waiting for some numbers that are contrary to what Christopher 
Thrash and Jim Maclean have pointed out (which precluded the need for me to 
do so).  You gonna put out an anlysis Ian?  David?  I\'m certainly interested 
in *some* evidence from your side so that I might make my final decision for 
the RC.

Err... the megacorps would control their own facilities.  Small fries would 
have to make do w/ whatever the starport/locals and/or a 3rd party would put 
out.  Neither would be able to compete w/ a megacorps financial wielding.

And also to recover the used ones if theyr\'e going to be refurbished.  Have 
to pay all these people and the equipment their using.  As well as set up a 
drop tank refurbishing industry.  W/o reusing the tanks, the whole thing 
doesnt\' work at all, of course.

Nope.  In any case, as Far Trader points out, all the free trader is doing is 
picking up teh crumbs left behind by the megacorps anyways (or for those 
worlds/routes insignificant to rate big time traffic).

Well said.

Except the doubts were laid on them from the beginning, too.  It\'s jumping to 
conclusions and grappling them onto an uncanonical j-theory that dooms them.  
The "implications" on the future of Traveller economics are quite debatable, 
given safety and tech considerations.

At one GURPS near-future mercenary campaign I had a character with both a
nicotine addiction _and_ 2 levels of weak will. The result: the poor guy
had quit smoking 3 years ago, but couldn\'t get rid of nicotine-chewing gum.
(One other character was a chain-smoker, and because of anti-smoking laws
spent most of his time isolated from other characters in a ventilated
plexi-glass "smoking-booth".)

I don\'t see why.  One thing the piracy debate established was that,
if ship depart from predetermined points they are easier to protect
against pirates and a merchant ship will generally be arriving and
won\'t be able to jump again without refueling anyway.

This will mean they will be phased in over a period, it won\'t
prevent then from taking over.

>The fact that not all worlds are Jump-6 apart

I\'m not sure what you mean.  Some cargos won\'t be going
that far.  I\'m not sure if it would be better to have special
low jumps ships  or just use a higher jump ships and save
having to build a special one.  In my ananlysis I assumed
that a vary minor world would, in fact, have a jump-1 ship that
moved cargo to the nearest significant port for transhipment.
Long Distance cargoes will go at high jump.

At this point one has decided that the description as present
doesn\'t, in fact, work and needs to be changed, then
I think it is much better to drop the rule rather than load
it down with arbitrary effects and restrictions.  Introducing
a new technology and the loading it down with restrictions so
it can only have a narrow range of uses is pretty contrived.

I\'m talking about a tank that doesn\'t count against the limit and
collapses into the ship before you jump.  I means you get all
the benefits of drop tanks but don\'t have to rely on jump stations.
Less of an interest for merchant ships, but great for military
ships.

So you want them to just happen to be too dangerous for merchant
use but just safe enough so PC can use them?  The problem is that
these sorts of restrictions feel as contrived as they are (the
risk "just happens" to fit a predetermined value and can\'t be
easily changed) and they don\'t solve all the problems (any
thing that is safe enough for PC is going to be great for
military uses and drop tanks are easily as big advantage being
able to do J-3 which was supposedly one of the things that let
the Solomani beat the Vilani).  So now you need more restrictions
and it get more arbitrary.

It also still conflicts with how they are presented in the
entry in question (as having been in commercial use for dozens
of years).

[More reasons that are essentailly aribtary restrictions on
them.  IMO, if you introduce a technology it should be allowed
to flow to its natural consequences.  Not doing so is the sort
of thing that has given too many SF settings so much of a contrived
feel.]

>It only becomes hokey and contrived if you try to limit the possibilities
>for no good reason.

For me, simply trying to introduce a new techology so that people
can play with it (for a short time until they get used to it and
take if for granted) but preventing it from having its naturaly
believable consequences isn\'t a good reason (after the initial
interest and you
take it for granted, the conflicts, arbitriness, etc. remains
with the setting forever.  This is a problem with older settings
that one hasn\'t been careful with.  They are full of things that
"just happen" to have all sorts of side effects that prevent
them from really being useful)

>One good approach, if you\'re not the sort of person who come up with good
>and consistent drawbacks on the fly

The problem is that I don\'t think I should _have_ to arbitrarily
rule that, every time the players come up with an idea, that something
unexpected happens.  I can do it but it is contrived and prevents
players from trying to extrapolate on the setting as describe,
and damamge believability.

The problem is, and still remains, once those points are known and plotted, a 
*determined* enemy can deny you the use of them.  If you\'re using \'jump 
stations\', all the enemy has to do is commit enough forces to ensure its 
destruction, and the system is now pretty much pacified.  The danger in the 
Spinward Marches isn\'t so much piracy as it is the next Frontier War.  Zho & 
SW commerce raiders *aren\'t* pirates, and they\'re not so much interested in 
taking prizes home for the money (althugh they do this to a limited extent to 
help offset the cost of having them out there in the first place) as they are 
in *destroying* trade entirely to bring economic forces to bear on the enemy.  
See the difference?  The guys coming at your fuel station aren\'t going to be 
400 ton corsairs, they\'re gonna be a DesRon or better.  If it makes a system 
or a group of systems surrender faster due to lack of resources, all the 
better.  You\'ll lose fewer men & ships taking them.

And no, *military* ships IMTU aren\'t designed to *exclusively* use drop tanks 
to the sacrifice of all internal jump fuel.  *Some* are designed to have drop 
tanks added to extend their range, but that\'s about all.  They still have 
their usual range without the tanks.

In Core areas, maybe.  On a raw frontier (i.e., D & E starports)?  Not for 
awhile, not until they upgrade to at least C\'s.

You don\'t get *squat* for using collapsible tanks.  If they\'re internal, they 
just take up room that would be used for cargo or whatever.  Filling this 
space *after* the fuel is used and *before* the jump would be impractical at 
best, impossible at worst.  If you\'re going to go through the trouble of using 
collapsible tanks all the time, you might as well save a few creds & just 
install normal tankage.

It was J-2 that gave the Sollies the edge in the Interstellar Wars, but the 
ships *weren\'t* equipted with drop tanks.  It was all internal.

How they were portrayed in canon, and how I take them IMTU is, drop tanks 
*agument* jump fuel.  They don\'t *replace* it.

  Cost of the actual tanks is the same.

  Somewhat absurdly, drop tanks are arguably more robust, as they can survive
skimming operations (it\'s also more than little a bit bizarre that they don\'t
affect streamlining).

Just to be clear, there are four general types of Intellectual Property:

Patents - technology, designs, inventions, etc.  More than expressions.

Copyrights - expressions.  (the US has defined software into copyright, but
software that meets the requirements can be patented)

Trademarks - identifiers of origin source.

Trade Secrets - stuff you hide from your competitors, regardless of whether
it qualifies for other protection.


Vilani *patent* laws impede technological innovation because they
are excessively strong, and include the rights to control all derivative
innovations.  This is used to explain why it took so long for them
to develop overall.  Compare Solomani innovation rate, and it looks
like the Vilani are almost standing still.

You\'re other questions have whatever answers you want.
There is nothing officially holding anyone back.  There is just an
economic disincentive to invest in innovation in the 3I.  Its
not so strong that it can\'t be overcome, but it slows things down
because the chances of getting rich by pouring all your resources
into research is less than say, modern day Terra, because you
can\'t build upon the inventions of others and still hope to get rich.

The Darrians seem introspective to me, and not hell bent on
getting rich through innovation.  And the Zhodani keep their
Proles down where they belong.  They are the proletariat after all.

(Why has it taken me so long to realize the Prole is short for
Proletariat?  Compartmentalized mind, I guess.  Hmmm,
anyone want to speculate on the effect of a Zhodani revolution?
Mwahaha.)

Excellent post here, Chris.  Your ideas remind me of
Thomas Kuhn\'s THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS.

I would suggest that more likely than having "forgotten" something,
the Darrians and Zhodani, are "missing" something.  And since
they both place social and/or physical barriers to foreigners, which means
foreign ideas as well, they\'re hindering their ability to make a
paradigmatic breakthrough.

Couple of comments. Area Knowledge is the points sink I was hoping for. So
many of the trading rolls are at the lower of your
Mechant/Advertising/whatever skill and AK for the relevant planet. If we
got AKs for each commodity type up, it\'d be perfect ...

This hurts brutally optimised characters, because you need to sink points
into each world you intend to turn up on.

Can someone rig up a computer program to generate all the trade routes in
the Marches and to get trade quantities going thru each starport ? My brain
is hurting just trying to do the numbers for Bowman Belt.

Good to see tickets and qualifications in there.

The High Finance stuff will add a new aspect to some games (\'There\'s a
bloke looking for bouncers with tennybopper experience ... any of youse
blokes heard of a band called Seltzmann\'s IPO ?\').

I\'m running some tweaks and optional rules for the Spec Trade system
through the bug blender. 

I also have some requests for some really simple computer coding - could
someone with a little bit of time and programming skill email me ?
Basically, the idea is to pre-generate a bunch of spec cargos. It could
even be run as java code on a web page.

A second idea for a GM aid is a list of pre-generated ships and captains
... a sort of Rogues Gallery for who\'s in port. This is why I need the
total trade quantities. Somewhere like Bowman Belt only has a small amount
of trade itself, but it\'s throughput is higher, because of being on a route.

Ideally, I\'d like to have a GM assistant that would let you punch in the

You can certainly have them do so IYTU. It\'s plausible enough that some
Vilani exiles could have gone there some time between -2300 and -1700.
But as for the OTU, I\'m afraid not. But according to _Darrians_, p. 8 of
all the worlds in the Spinward Marches there were humans only on Darrian,
Vanejen, Algine and "a few Zhodani worlds" when the Itzin fleet arrived
in -1513. [Yes, I know that _Behind the Claw_ has half a dozen or more
human populations that predates that date, including two more minor human
races, but that is contrary to previously published material].

One of my characters goes the exact extreme opposite.  He was on this planet 
where they grow tobacco, and the first time he ran across a guy with a cigar 
and was told they\'re \'mildly addictive\', he *freaked*.   \'Nonono!!  Not want

order of possession of a couple kilos of China White or something.  Remember,

First of all, *everybody* competes with megacorps, if indirectly.

Let us assume that the jump-4 2000 dton Oberlindes freighter is forced off
it\'s normal route by competition from Tukera drop freighters. Would
Oberlindes put it into Ordinary ? No. They would assign it to another, more
marginal route. This would then kick the jump-3, 1000 dton ship off it\'s
normal route. At that point, the PCs find their Fledgeling line that was
just getting by linking those small worlds together now has serious
competition.

Now, a smart Oberlindes manager would be scoping out the \'fallback\' routes
*before* Tukera shifted their ships onto drop tanks.

If stock markets are good at one thing, it\'s adjusting present value to
deal with expected future shocks.

Now, lets work through the (likely) scenario you put forward.

First of all, a lot of ships are collateral for a lot of loans. Now, if the
value of this collateral falls, then previously safe loans are suddenly
looking risky. Banks will be wanting other collateral, or for you to
refinance.

Secondly, shares in companies like Oberlindes back a lot of other
enterprises. If your bank\'s reserves include Oberlindes shares, and those
shares have just dropped sharply, then you are going to need to get liquid
again - possibly by calling in loans.

Thirdly, people not in the shipping industry go \'Cool. Freight prices have
fallen\'. Check out the GT:FT sidebar on p29 for what might happen if the
State suspects that the shipping lines are not allowing the benefits of
this new technology to flow through the Imperium.

If you \'stretch\' the GT:FT p15 distance mods by 25% (accepting that drop
tanks reduce freight prices by 25%), then you get substantial increases in
trade (eg trade between 2 WTN 6 worlds 120 parsecs apart becomes 8.5 rather
than 8). Bad for shipping companies with outdated technology, good for
everyone else.

Fourthy, you dont have to scrap your internal tankage ships, you could
refit them for drop tanks. Rip out the tankage, add in pipes, and add more
cargo. It\'ll be ugly, they\'ll need time and money to refit and they will
probably be less efficient than a custom drop tank ship, but it\'s doable.

Gary, some of us prefer to avoid problems, rather than handwave later.

Personally, I recommend drop tanks increasing your misjump chance to about
3%, which is enough to make them non-viable for commercial use, but fine
for deep-penetration military raids. A variant could be to say that this
increased chance stops 4 TLs after the jump drive was introduced (ie jump-1
with drop tanks is safe at TL13, jump-2 with drop tanks is safe at TL14,
jump 3 with tanks will be safe at TL16 etc). 

Of course, this requires that you write off the references in that %$#% TNS
article to them being extensivly used in Core, etc.

Gary, you\'ve got GT:FT. Use my munchkinned Broker (p90 sidebar) and try to
borrow a hundred million via a bond issue. It isnt too much of a problem.

That hundred million should build a jump-5 300 dton jump freighter that can
do Mercator-Glisten with no stops. Now, Express cargo rates are Cr800 per
parsec, so thats Cr 4000 for the route. I\'d say with ummm 25 ktons of cargo
a week between Glisten and Mercator (plus the feed from Five Sisters via
Collace) there should be some people interested in an express service.

<ship is 400 dt hull, 200t armour, Bridge, Engo, 30 mnvr, 24 jump(TL11),
utility, sickbay, 5 lo berths, 12 staterooms, 288 dt cargo, 2 Collapsible
Tanks. Cost is MCr 94.74. Class name is the \'Ditzammer Spofulam\', on the
grounds it has Entirely Too Much Speed>

OK. 288 dtons of cargo, so at KCr 4 per jump we get revenue of MCr 1.08,
plus a couple of passengers at about KCr 10 each (assume they pay the
salaries of the crew and other incidentals).

Now, to earn 6% on our hundred megacredits, we need to turn a profit of MCr
6 in a year. Assume 30 jumps a year, and thats a required profit of KCr 200
a jump.

Well, Gary, lets do the numbers.

A Ditzie Spof class needs 200 dtons of fuel, so lets take the Collapsible
tank and scale it up to 200 dtons. Turns into KCr 666 expenditure, plus the
200 dtons of fuel at Cr 350 per is KCr 70 (OK, I\'m beinding the rules here.
The other option was to design a 480 dton Fast Trader that would use 2
Collapsible Tanks).

Thus, the fuelling requirements are goanna cost the fat bastard KCr 736 per
jump.

He takes a Black out of his pocket (leaving 8 k-bills change from what
he\'ll get from the cargo), and pays for the collapsible tanks on the nose.
He then pays the bondholders their two hundred, leaving him KCr 72 clear
profit once the cheque from the Bill of Lading clears on Glisten.

If you assume drop tanks are even vaguely reusable, then Ganisiirdi is
going to need a new room on his gallery *real* soon.

Now, the cost of taking cargo from Mercator to Glisten is Cr 2220 using
\'standard\' freight rates.

At these rates, the Ditzie Spof class will get KCr 504 revenue. We need KCr
200 to pay off the bondholders, so we have KCr 300 to pay for 200 dtons of
drop fuel and to provide surplus profit. Given that fuel costs Cr 750
delivered to the 100 diameter limit (GT:FT p66), we should manage this nicely.

Of course, the real money is made when something commercially signifigant
happens on either world, and Ganisiirdi is the first to know, because his
ship carried the news ...

GT:FT isnt limited to just free traders, unlike previous trade and commerce

From what I noticed, earning a bit of pocket money pursuing my hobby by
working part time in a game store for a friend back then, CT had a core of
followers in SE Queensland (SEQ), we (myself included) were keen on MT when
we heard it was coming right up until we all purchased it and put it into
play!

There were many errors, and many of the ship deckplans in the current
campaigns that we wanted to convert to the new rules just didn\'t convert
without fudging (ID\'ing where these needed fudging was more work than
designing new ships and drawing new DP\'s), at least that\'s what we found.
Great background as usual, but to many bad or complicated additions.

Many of us never turned back to CT (I persisted as long as I could, but my
players couldn\'t handle the new complications) and the group eventually
folded and turned to AD&D mainly.  Traveller virtually died with MT in SEQ.
TNE was snapped up by myself and a few others when it was seen on the
shelves, but with most of the SEQ\'ers, it was to late with just as many
errors as MT.

I can\'t say how well GT is faring, I know the GURPS system is pretty strong
here, we can only hope.  I also can\'t speak for the rest of Australia
either, but I know that all of the CON booklets I have read over the last
umpteen years feature NO Traveller sessions at all, though I have been
approached several times to run a CT session (but I had given my stuff away
by then).  Even the big gaming clubs in Brisbane have nothing by way of
Traveller products that I have seen in the club library.  This is really
sad, considering that in the earlier, now defunct (proto)game clubs,
Traveller was quite popular and rivalled D&D and AD&D equally!

I am an award winning AD&D\'er myself (several years running), but I know
what game I\'d rather play.  And since finding this list, though I have not
asked nor hinted, the young bloke I gave my stuff to may just give it back
so I can consider a CT campaign once again  :^)

That would be my take on it, and the holo-technology would allow a "book"
reader to assume any position they like and have a "book" to be projected
almost anywhere for them to read... I also envision said books to have
moving illustrations if the book was an illustrated book?  You could look up
the workings of your favourite weapon or hobby, and there\'s an image of it
in use... complete with sound if you select that option!

ObTrav:  As for "personal comfort" (errr... prostitutes -- of both sexes
too, I\'d assume), I can\'t see having "pleasure crew" on an Imperial warship,
but on a Brothel Ship may be different?  Perhaps Imperial policy is to put
some chemicals in the crews food to (ahem) kill such natural desires short
term?  I still see prudish ship captains that would frown upon such
activities in the IN/IISS.  In my former TU, I allowed communal "freshers"
on bases and vessels, similar to that in Starship Troopers, but one still
must have natural urges raising their heads over time without some relief
via shore leave or chemical suppression??

They have subsector fleets and sector fleets.   A subsector fleet might
consist of just one or two squadrons and some support ships, while a sector
fleet would have BatRons, CruRons, AssaultRons, CarRaons and lots of other
goodies.

In my campaign, I refer to the subsector entities as Groups, and the sector
entity as a Fleet.  The Fleet is made up of the Groups from the subsectors,
plus some directly-attached units.  The Reserve Groups can be used with
Colonial units to form a Reserve Fleet, or be used to reinforce a regular
Fleet.  In most cases, planetary squadrons (colonial units) would either
combine with Reserve forces to form a Reserve Fleet, or would operate in ad
hoc Patrol Groups in their home subsectors, patrolling for commerce raiders
and protecting convoys.  I made this distinction becuase I figured many of
the \'colonial squadrons\' would tend to be lighter patrol-type vessels, or
antiquated larger ships retired from the Imperial Navy.

I would think that such distinctions would be blurred after 3000 years.
IMTU, the Imperial Marines know that their earliest antecedents wear the
USMC and the Royal Marines, but aren\'t sure exactly they fought for, or
which traditions came from what unit, or were picked up along the way.

For example, the Marine march is "Sylea, the Brave".  This is Scotland the
Brave, of course (a tune that makes me want to invade northern England when
I hear it.. and I\'m half-English.), but since nobody remembered what
Scotland was by the time the Sylean Marines were formed, they just changed
the name.  Even when the Marines retook Terra, they dismissed the Scottish
version as a pale Solomani rip-off of good old Marine honors!

I don\'t see endurance as a significant issue.  GT figures a suit of
battledress will have an endurance of 70-100 hours on a charge, MT is even
more generous (up to 20 days, depending on TL and model.)  They\'re going to
need food and water more often than they need batteries.  For that matter, 
their support and transport vehicles all have pretty large fusion power
plants, so they can recharge suit batteries easily.  Each APC probably has
a spare battery for each trooper, they can switch every day to keep a large
reserve "in the cans." 

Now, a unit cut off from its vehicles and without resupply will be in
trouble, but not anytime soon.  Pure jump troops will only operate
independently for as long as a week (with a single spare battery if
necessary).   

Cost issues are a more plausible reason for non-powered troops, but the
advantages of battledress are so dramatic that high-TL forces will probably
be willing to pay for it.  This is especially true for interstellar forces,
where transport coasts mount up quickly.  Force multipliers like
battledress become worthwhile if you can significantly reduce the size of
the force you need to move.

what sort of characters are you expecting? ie, should we be thinking
of designing Fleet Admirals / Generals / Presidents etc, or
Lieutenants / Junior Diplomats / Free Traders etc, or any combination
of the two extremes and middle rankers as well?

Currently I\'m designing:

\'Strom Sigurdsson\', male 35, an Intelligence officer (of Solomani
descent, with false Imperial and Sword World IDs produced by Darrian
Intelligence, currently undercover on Gram)

\'Mihlu Nehmih\', female 31, a Special Arm Naval Captain (at the secret
base, which I believe is in 0423)

\'Ninuldo Balehnihlzehk\', male 42, a Trader Captain (and semi-offical
spy/intelligence gatherer) currently at Sting

\'Zehyrung N\'dos\', female 25,  an archaeologist from the University of
Zlodh, currently studying Sword Worlder warship design on Entrope

While not Falkenburg per say, Pournelle did a story in War World #2 that
not only dealt with Tanith, and explained why it was important to the
Saurons, but also did, IMO, one of the finest fleet actions ever put to
paper.  He detailed the differance in command philosophy between the Empire
and the Saurons and how it tended to effect each group.

ObTrav:  I always viewed the Saurons as the role model for the Zhodani.
While the Zhos never got into the genetic superman craze, at least that we
know about, they are similar in that they are as a whole, more than similar
Imperial forces.  With the Imperial forces, you have the Mk1, Mod 0 human.
The Sauron had the genetic engineering and breeding, whereas the Zho have
the psionics.

ObTrav 2:  Anyone care to speculate on a potential meeting between the
Imperium and the Sauron?  Technology equal or better than the Imperials,
phisically superior, enhanced healing (nanotech?), focused manifest
destiny, democratic ideals (ISTR that there was speculation that the Sauron
were actually Americans who broke away from the Co-Dominium), and one major
weakness - the need for Borzoi.

ObTrav 3:  With a bit of tweaking, Traveller could be used to simulate the
Co-Dominium/1st Empire/2nd Empire/Motie Incursions.

I have to differ with you concerning this idea in the OTU.  I\'m afraid that 
there is a clash in canonical sources (that never happens!).  Your info 
concerning Darrian space is correct, but, referring back to may copy of the 
Traveller Integrated Timeline, Travellers Digest #20 tells of Vilani 
settlement in the Trojan Reaches in -2074.  If you draw a line between 
Corridor and the Trojan Reaches, Five Sisters is arguably on the path of 
trave, particularly if the colonists staged through the established colony of 
Vanejen.  Yes, it\'s all in the misty Traveller past, but according to good 
sources it happened.  If they were making an effort to get far away from the 
Terrans, it is very likely that the Vilani would not have spent time 
exploring or lingering in what would later become Darrian space, but could 
have passed through without leaving any trace except for some unfortunates 
who couldn\'t keep up and got stranded on some works in the Five Sisters.  
Keep Travelling!

Most gaming clubs in Aussie, from my memory, started as serious table top
miniature and military simulation game clubs, with the odd group in the club
branching out into RPG\'s until many clubs consisted mainly of RPG\'ers,
different groups splintering off, etc.  Until the clubs became generic
"game" clubs, TTM\'s, Mil Sims, and RPG (some including any game:  Monopoly,
Scrabble, and the like also!).

Traveller was brilliant and in it\'s classic format, had a decent following.
Many clubs had the Europa(sp) series, not to mention the
Imperial-Traveller-like games like Imperium and Invasion Earth.  I honestly
can\'t say about anti-GDW, I felt they were a great game producing institute,
and I know it came as a shock to myself and nearly every gamer I know that
knew of GDW, to learn they were folding!  In SE Queensland, it was MT that
killed Traveller (my personal opinion), and I myself was not very interested
in Space1889 and it never got a great following in the clubs I was apart of.
But in wargames (only Avalon Hill rivalled them) and Traveller, they were
gaming gurus.

Drawing a straight line from Corridor, passing through Deneb and going on 
to Noricum (2018 TR), you might pass through the rimward-trailing quarter 
of Trin\'s Veil subsector, at least 20 parsecs from the border of the Five 
Sisters subsector.  This is not by My definition of "arguably on the path 
of travel".

	I won\'t praise or condemn SSDS; however, it\'s not fully compatible
with any of the other two or three T4 design systems, and it has the
usual IG level of errata. It also had little or no playtesting (being
written in one week on the GDW-Beta list ...)

	The designs bite. Most of the designs submitted by beta list members
were mangled and changed without reason. There is at least one ship
that carries more fuel than the ship actually displaces. The
deckplans are low quality.

I have received several E-mails from people who have had trouble downloading
the file from the above site. I will be providing an additional link to the

people have been having.

This will be the last release of WBD for some time. I am about to start work

Larry Niven did an excellent story about Tanith and the Saurons called

The other side of endurance is trooper fatigue.  I was lucky enough to take
part in an experiment in how long infantry could stand being in MOPP 4
chemical warfare gear.  The longest was 70 hours.  Most of us went nuts
within a day.  To put it simply, you can\'t get to an itch, blow your nose,
rub a sore muscle, etc., in a suit of battledress.  Individual effcienicy
is going to plummet the longer the trooper stays in the can.  I guarntee
that no matter how you fiddle, there will be something in that suit that
will be irratating as hell after about 12 hours.

Which make the tactic for fighting BD equipped troopers clear.  Hide, then
zap their follow on forces.  Pop HE rounds at them.. it won\'t penetrate the
suit, but it might wreck the equipment they\'re carrying.

Battledress is a force multiplier, but it has significant drawbacks.  I\'ve
designed a couple of cheap GURPS weapons, similar to LAW rockets, that can
reliably penetrate up to 1400 pts or armor, and can be fielded at a ratio
of 200 weapons to each suit of battledress.  In this way, a suit of
battledress is the modern extension of the tank.. very dangerous, but
vulnerable to a patient, well trained enemy.

Seems to be selling in Melbourne.  From what I gather, GURPS seems to mosey
on out the door rather than fly out, but it sells.  Hopefully, the GT stuff
will generate some interest from a new crop of players.  Conquest \'99
featured a Traveller game (CT I think) of one session, so that may also act

I tend to assume that there is not.  Per the "You rule the dirt, we rule

Sorry.  Confusing registration of business names and trademarks as opposed
to copyrighting ideas and concepts.  Unfortunately law and business don\'t
often fall within a Geology degree ..... 

8-P

I would imagine that this sort of thing would be fairly well spelt-out in
3I legislation and that it would keep many lawyers employed in
copyright/trademark disputes all across the Imperium.

Just a general sort of thought thing, would colonial/planetary fleets need
jump capability ?  There may be something covered in canon somewhere about
it .... ?  If they are set up as an auxiliary force for the Imperium, then
yes, I could see the need, but otherwise, yer traditional fleet to protect
the system would probably not need it.  Thoughts, sophonts ?

placement, that is entirely up to you and of course directly affects the type 
of campaign you will play. 

As to the other Darrian players, two others besides yourself have expressed 
an interest, but as with all things participation is much different that 
expressed interest. But there will always be a possiblity of addition players 
within a faction with the format I am using. :)

I\'d be inclined to leave this out, as it takes up a _lot_ of space. I only
included the spreadsheets in 101 Starships because (a) I wanted people to
be able double-check my designs, as I\'m not an expert ship designer, and
(b) as it is a free product (but copyrighted, not public domain) no one
could complain that their money was wasted on useless information. After
all, you don\'t have to print the spreadsheets. I didn\'t.

The spreadsheets would make a nice Pyramid article, though.

Oddly enough, OPP response time in most of rural Ontario is about the same,
if not a bit longer, and gun owners are in a minority. Yet we don\'t have a
problem with people kicking in the doors of farmhouses.

In fact, with gun control stricter than any in the US, we have a tenth the
murder rate (on a per capita basis). Taken at face value (like the chap who
argued that states with gun control were more violent to \'prove\' why guns
were necessary) this argues that gun control works.  Given that Canada and
America have fairly different cultures, however, I would be surprised if
the presence or absence of guns was the major factor, just as I suspect
that differing levels of violent crime in US states can be better explained
by sociological and economic differences than by the presence/absence of
firearms.

I view gun control as a _response_ to violent crime, not the cause of it.
If everyone walked around carrying loaded AK-47s, and yet no one was ever
shot with one, then no one would even think that AK-47s needed controlling.
Whether it is an appropriate response seems to be, for many people on the
TML, a matter of almost religious faith.  Personally, I see no problem with
responsible individuals owning guns, just as I see no problem with denying
irresponsible individuals access (in the same way that I believe that not
everyone should be allowed to drive).

Quite frankly, we\'ve been around this whole thing time and again. Could we
switch the topic to, maybe, the causes of violent societies?

Why, for example, do the murder rates in New York and Paris differ so much?
ObTrav: law level/CR denotes the level of legal restriction. We have no
rating for how much criminal activity is actually present on a world, which
seems to leave it up to the referee. Here on Earth, we have models for low
law/low crime, low law/high crime, high law/high crime, and high law/low
crime.  I would generalize that, as population density increases, violence
tends to rise, and this may trigger higher legal restrictions. OTOH, I
haven\'t studied the issue in any great depth. What real-world examples can
we mine for goo Traveller cultural models?

Why was the Klondike so safe during the Gold Rush, compared to the American
side of the border?  (Steele banned gambling, guns, and (I believe) hard
liquor. Was it the absence of these items? The absence of people who
refused to go where they couldn\'t get these items? The presence of the
Mounties?  Other cultural factors?)  ObTrav: the Klondike is an alternate
model for a mining boom.

The Netherlands, with a policy of decriminalizing drugs, has nowhere near
the problem with drug-related crime that other countries have. What does
this say about \'the war on drugs\'?  Did Prohibition work?  ObTrav: Could
this explain why the Imperium bans very few items?

Then here\'s another trick for you.

If you make the size of each map proportional to the size of the world,
players get a better idea of how big the world really is. I did this by
making the number of hexes along the side of a triangle the same as the
world\'s size digit, which makes each hex about 1000km.

Print out a map of Earth to the same scale, and players have a much better
idea how large a size 10 world is (or how small a size 1 rock is).

Make possession of a deadly weapon de jure proof of intent to use deadly force.

If deadly force was justified, you are legally in the clear. This would,
however, scotch any "but I only intended to scare her" defenses, and raise
the charge from manslaughter to murder.


ObTrav: This is how I rule on firefights in starports, IMTU.  But as most
of my players travel unarmed, this has never actually happened to a player.

True. But in Britain at least the murder rate has been dropping, which
means that if many murders went undetected before it has _really_ been
dropping.

The same is true (on a per capita basis) for Toronto; you actually are less
likely to be murdered here than in the 1950s, but most people think that it
has gotten more dangerous.

It was on Hadley.  If you recall, Sergeant Major Calvin ended his
address with the announcement that there would be an extra wine ration
for all, and that combat veterans would also receive a brandy ration. 
(This was before the 42d troops revealed themselves as such.)  Vice
President Ernie Bradford was the politician viewing the scene.

> OBTrav...I wonder if a Trav senario could be made with Pournelle material?...

Of course.  Admittedly, if you want to go whole-hog CoDominium setting,
you probably should use FF&S (the TNE version) for ship designs, since
that book (from what I\'ve heard) has the best rules for non-Jump drives
(for instance, the Alderson drives used by CoDo ships).  Either that, or
GURPS: Space.

I\'d set the CoDominium at about TL-9, or TL-10 at most.  (GTL-9)

I can think of a few reasons why ships in a planetary navy would have
jump capability:

1.  Annual maintenance.  For a relatively low-tech world, or one with a
low-quality starport, the ships may need to go outsystem for annual
maintenance.  The ability to jump there might make things easier.

2.  Surplus ships.  Planetary navies may contain ships that are surplus
to current Imperial/subsector fleet needs.  Why rip the jump drives out?

3.  Prestige.  Just as many smaller navies today maintain a token
"blue-water" force, even when national maritime strategy focuses on
littoral operations (for what does Argentina really _need_ an aircraft
carrier?), so planetary navies would want at least some jump-capable
ships, to go with their non-jumping boats.

4.  Pursuit capability.  If a pirate or commerce raider jumps outsystem,
the ability to pursue may be valuable.

Which is, perhaps, the most intrusive idea I have ever ran across.  Define
deadly weapon.  How do you judge intent?  Swords and knifes are \'deadly
weapons\', but we keep them in our kitchens without thought.

> If deadly force was justified, you are legally in the clear. 

Except if you merely own the instrument and *never* use it on anyone, you
are still as guilty (in the legal sense) as someone who just committed a
murder.

No harm, no foul.

Most of my players go unarmed, and in two campaigns there have been a total
of three firefights, with maybe 5 shots fired total.

Unless such things have become a \'patriotic duty\' and these people are
seen as serving a vital function by keeping the men and women of the
Imperial Services satisfied in their duties. Could even be a sort of
Auxilary Corps to the regular services (registered and screened) which
would help prevent nefarious agents of foreign powers from gaining access
to Imperial Officers/Crew through the use of seduction.

Depends on how the culture of the Imperium (not of any one world) views
sex. I would go for this more progressive model, and say the Imperium
recognizes that people want/need to have satisfying sexual relations in
their lives, and will function at a lower level after some period of being
denied this. Of course it does mean you have to make sure you have the
right mix of races on your brothel ship for visiting a particular fleet...

I\'m figuring on inertial confinement. If you detonate in the middle of
a (say) 100 meter diameter tank, the shock wave itself will provide a
*lot* of compression. Line the tank with the right materials and you\'ll
get enough X-ray flux reflected back to help matters.

Maybe, maybe not. Those nebulae are *hard vacuum* by earthly standards.
So it\'s not like it\'s *easy* for the scattered atoms to condense.

For that matter, given the capacity of things like fiber optics, and
how widespread data cables would be on a ship, I expect that even in
ships using "bunkroom" type quarters, every bunk could have a tap into
a data cable (either in a band not used by the important stuff or via
use of "backup" fibers). This would give you access to the ship\'s
video/audio/data library. 

It wouldn\'t take much bandwidth at all to provide each sailor with the
equivalent of a personalized radio station and tv lineup. Just select a
playlist (for both music and video) or set up for "random" selections
that meet certain criteria. 

You\'d need a little smarts in the "console" (combo of screen,
headphones and keyboard). But it\'d be less than the average current PC.
Which means it\'d cost pennies by then. All the "configuration" goes
into the console. It just sends requests to the central library. Then
the album, video, or book is downloaded to it. 

If bandwidth is scarce, you might have to "put up with" things like

Honor\'s replica 1911A1 has a similar effect on some assasins. It\'s not
so much the damage it causes. It\'s the *noise*.

When you get right down to it, for people used to "quiet" energy
weapons, a 45 might as well be a SWAT flash/stun grenade. :-)

Falkenberg came entirely too close to re-enacting that battle in his
first combat tour. I forget the name of the planet, but he and group of
menn (a company?) held a chokepoint on a river valley while the rest of
the CoDominium forces drove the rebel forces against them.

Falkenberg *definitely* belongs in Traveller. So does his "Legion".

Well, the (terrible IMHO) Battledress in Star Mercs runs off an NPU, and
thus has a virtually unlimited endurance (Something on the order of years).
 There is canonical precedent for this: in T4 IA Battledress made in the 3I
run off Fusion+.  I\'ve handwaved IMTU that Fusion+ can be represented
adequately by GT NPUs, so I have a (more sane) NPU powered Battledress
that\'s standard in my world.  You can see the stats on my web site.

At least in GT, by GTL12 you can build a full life system into a

IIRC, it wasn\'t uncommon for the wives to \'forget\' to leave the ship before
it left port. The phrase "son of a gun" is orginally supposed to be anyone
born on the gun deck (the gun crews sleep next to the cannons) of a ship of
the line. This once (being born) actually happened once in the middle of a
battle.

Well, this is TTL15/GTL12 we are talking about... Maybe by then they solved
these problems... (hmm, automated neural interface scratching devices....
Need the neural interface to get just the right spot...)

It happens, but it didn\'t happen in this case.

And the same source tells of multiple settlements in Trojan Reach and Reft
between -2300 and -1700. No mention of Spinward Marches anywhere.

Which there\'s absolutely no reason to suppose they did.

Sure, but the reference in _Darrians_ dosen\'t speak of what traces the Itzin
fleet found, it speaks of how conditions were at the time the Itzin fleet
reached the Spinward Marches, that is in -1513.

Now, I\'m all for changing canon when two canonical sources absolutely cannot
both be right, but when there is a possible way to reconcile them, I believe
in going with that way. In this case the two references don\'t conflict. One
says that some Vilani settled in Trojan Reach and Reft, the other says that
no Vilani settlements (except Vanejen) existed in -1513. Where\'s the
conflict?

Not to mention that such expeditions could very well have followed the
curve of the Great Rift. They certainly didn\'t HAVE to go through Five
Sisters.

Or for that matter, CARPG (computer-aided RPG).  Imagine the potential
benefits of a system that not only can do all your mechanics for you, but
also allows the GM to quickly (on the fly, even) create holographic, or at
least TTL15-rendered models of what the player sees by drawing on an
enormous library of models (Which probably include some of Jesse\'s.....)

Or you could borrow a few pages from Joe Haldeman\'s "The Forever War",
in which (in the early period of the war), promiscuity was not only
encouraged, but pretty much made mandatory. I don\'t remember the logic
behind it (it\'s been a while since I\'ve read it...)

I would imagine that many starports, particularly class A and B ports on
worlds with a population level of 6 or higher, would have the equivalent
of a "red light district". A crew member on leave at the starport could 
simply visit the appropriate establishment should the need arise. ("Do
you have an appointment? No? Okay, I can fit you in next Tuesday 
afternoon...") 

Then there\'s the approach used in many places on contemporary Earth: 
hang around the bar looking for a pick-up. (Come to think of it, that
might explain why characters always immediately head for the bar when
getting into port...)

Setting

This Scout adventure is set in Traveller: The New Era, in the Domain of Deneb, 
1134.  Archduke Norris has managed to successfully seal the borders before 
the initial AI Virus wave hit, but a second major wave has been sighted coming down
Corridor Sector.  The Second Wave, unlike the First, is composed mainly of 
naval warships rather than commercial vessels, and according to the 
fragmentary information coming from the Wilds is definitely more experienced 
in warfare.  

The Domain is still frantically trying to Virus-proof it\'s major worlds and communication
systems: it simply cannot afford to fight a war of attrition against Virus, as it\'s too
likely that some infected ship\'s will successfully slip Virus into the network and
snuff the last flame of interstellar civilization.  The *entire* Spinward Marches fleet
has been dispatched to Deneb Sector to hold the line with Deneb fleet against Virus,
with the subsector fleet\'s left to guard the Marches against Virus, the Zhodani, and the
Aslan\'s.

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service is being gutted during the Virus era.  The 
Scout\'s are fundamentally about obtaining information from the Unknown
and spreading it around - but the unexplored regions of the Wilds are 
now infected with Virus, and gathering in information from that area is likely
to bring Virus with it.  Moreover, with the mission of the Scouts fatally undermined,
there is a desperate need for their resources as part of the newly-organized
Domain Quarrentine Service to conduct regular Virus inspections on EVERY
ship in the Domain, and watch for anything trying to cross the border. Already
there is talk of abolishing the Scouts, an act unthinkable even in the middle
of the Rebellion.
 
[Aside: The adventure is set in Foreven Sector: I have no information
in this sector, so the Referee can make it up as he pleases.]

Introduction
  
003-1134

"The Man\'s Office", Imperial Scout Base Gllagundam
Orbiting Byne, Foreven Sector


Chief Winthrop took a look around the typically slack Scouts facing him.
God, he wished he was going out with them on the last real
exploration mission he\'s seen in quite a long while - maybe the
last one he\'ll ever give.

He began with what everyone knew.  The massive saucers
that have recently arrived over Cong Su seem to be quite friendly
to the locals, if rather cool to the Imperium and openly hostile to 
the Zhodani.  They seem to be about TL 9-10, and are willing 
to exchange technological information with the Conggi in exchange for
the waste product\'s of that world\'s industries.  The world\'s four military
federations, edging towards a nuclear war, was quite willing to trade, 
and the local ecomony is benefiting visibily from the trade.

According to the reports from interstellar merchantmen, there was some kind of
fuss about local Conggi scientist\'s and biologist\'s, and currently
they are being attacked by the local government\'s and the
occassional civilian mob.  Still, they have been oftentimes arrogant
and blind to the consequences of their actions on that world, causing
much ecological and cultural destruction, so there\'s little symphathy
for them.  (The local\'s are only 20% Vilani in blood, but one portion of
Vilani culture that\'s very strong in all locals are the typical
attitudes to scientific research.)
 
The Visitor\'s themselves look quite human, and are evidentally from
a minor human race.  However, Scout research has turned up no 
government\'s in Far Frontiers, Foreven or The Spinward Marches 
that have such a massive (50 ~ 100) fleet of 3-4 km long, TL 9-A 
starships deployed outside of their home systems.  Not only that,
but there is NO record of this fleet passing through the neighbouring
systems to reach Cong Su.  

The Scout\'s are going through massive changes, so they simply
could not investigate the Visitors as much as they would
have pre-Rebellion (The Station had to wait a year before
two scout ship\'s were dispatched to the local base, and wait another
year until they arrived.  The crew of these ship\'s are the people 
attending the briefing).  So instead, what research there
is is based on rumour\'s and the occassional foray into Cong Su
via a trader, alway\'s with two Visitor escort\'s while outside of 
the starport.

The Chief want\'s answer\'s to three questions.  

A: How did the Visitor\'s, with nothing more than jump 1 drives, 
get here?  And when they leave the system, where do they go?  
NO Visitor ship has been seen outside of the Cong Su system.

B: Who are the Visitors?  No medical information is available 
on them, and no-one has been able to examine them.  We do
have samples of their written language, but no accurate
info on their spoken tongue.  

There are claims that they are really reptiles due to some televised incident, 
but TV images is easily faked (The local entertainment industry
has just reached the special effect\'s level of 2001: A Space Odyssey.
People tend to believe what they see, and aren\'t sophsticated
enough to know what can be done at higher tech levels.)
More than likely, the underground scientist\'s had the images faked
off-world, for televising here.

C: What are they doing on Cong Su?  It can\'t be just taking waste
from cities, unless there is some biological organism in the waste
that the Visitor\'s want.  The Scout\'s need real information - 
though only God know\'s if it will ever be put to use.  The
way the Domain is curling up into it\'s shell, it\'s unlikely 
anyone at Mora - over 50 parsec\'s away - would care if  
the entire Aquamarine subsector suddenly disappeared into the 
Void - as long as Virus diidn\'t do it.


**********************


The Scout Teams

The two Detatched Scout teams - the PC\'s and the 
NPC team - will have to fight and bicker over who 
does what.  Whatever the PC\'s choose to do, the 
NPC\'s want for themselves.  The NPC team is 
aggressive and violent, more like miss-assigned Marines
than Scouts (No, they don\'t have a FGMP and Battlearmour
in their locker, although they\'ve been trying to get some for the last
five years...).  

Part of what aggrivate\'s the situation is the very low morale
in the Scouts.  They see their mission in life being snatched away,
and their entire way of life dying.  Most of the best Scout\'s
have already left for the Navy, with some hanging on in the IISS.
The bureaucrat\'s are all leaving for the Domain Quarrentine Service,
with\'s it\'s exploding budget and expanding responsibilities.
The current Scout\'s are full of empty shell\'s (both bases and men),
folk three year\'s from retirement, and second- and third-rate
personnel, a far cry from Strephon\'s IISS.

This is quite possibily the last exploration mission in all of
Foreven Sector, so the NPC\'s will do everything they can 
to grab as much glory for themselves as possible.  They want all
the good equipment, the best information, 100% of the limited
spending budget, and the only set of antivirus equipment in the subsector 
(still barely worth the volume it takes up, it\'s so primitive - but it 
has lot\'s of prestige, so the NPC\'s want it).

They will also try to get the PC\'s to fail, by denying them information,
giving misleading clues, or simply kicking them in the head in
their *third* bar fight.  The Chief may slap them on the wrist,
but no real sanctions will be given: he need *both* teams
desperately.

**************************

Information for the PC\'s to find out: 

(after they have filtered out the red herrings, false rumours,
wild goose chases, etc)

The misjump rate of starship\'s between Cong Su and  
one of her neighbour\'s has been known to occasionally 
spike up to 10% for a year or so, every fifty - to - eighty year\'s.   
It\'s known to be caused by a Coisset Fragment, a dual 
jumpspace/realspace object which may or may not prove 
the existance of other universes outside of our own.
There are theories that it could be used as a way to enhanse
jump drive performance, but no such method has been discovered.
Currently, the misjump rate is normal.

There is undisputable evidence of some slower-than-light,
probably human exploration of nine worlds of this subsector,
around 3,000 - 2,500 year\'s ago.  Only a few derelict probes and
small spacetrash (hand tools, etc) has been found.  It was thought
that it\'s one of the local minor human races here did the job, but the
design philosophy and engineering spec\'s don\'t match any of the
sector\'s civilizations of the time period. [This will be hotly denied
by some nations, which will insist that their ancestors did the exploration].

Some Conggi are joining the Visitor\'s as member\'s of the Visitor\'s
Scout Service: they are well trained, carefully selected for health and 
placed in storage in a Visitor saucer for return to their homeworld 
(which is never named, "for cultural reasons") .  It\'s expected that they 
may not be seen for a long time, until they return to Cong Su on retirement.

A "cancer cure" called Antivirus was recently announced by the Visitor\'s: 
it is a genuine TL A/B cure, although limited to only the most common and 
typical cancer\'s.  This cure is being provided only to pro-Visitor Conggi, 
at selected dispencing areas.

There is a Visitor Youth Movement, which act\'s as a workforce/paramilitary
arm of the Visitor\'s.  Local armed forces are rarely seen: most have been disbanded
with the permission of the local world democracy, and the military equipment
is being broken up.  Many people are openly Friends of the Visitors, and the
planetary constitution is being expanded to provide them with special 
rights and priveleges.

The Visitor\'s have a certain flair for slogans and propaganda, which the Conggi
find charming and truthful.  A good sample can be found on 
http://people.we.mediaone.net/hallert/friendsofthevisitors.html , slogans
include "Friendship is Universal", "I\'m doing my part for the Visitors, are you?", 
"I\'m a patriot of Peace.  I want to join the Youth Movement!", etc.  The enthusiasm
for the Visitor\'s on Cong Su is genuine.

The four military federations on Cong Su have - with Visitor guidance -
unified into a proper world democracy.  The formal world government is 
becoming more and more a blend of Visitor\'s and Conggi, which 
Visitor\'s being placed in many advisory positions.

Few mind the increasng political power of the Visitors, while many (intellectials AND 
the general population) welcome it as a way to keep the politicans on a leash.
With disarmement, the economy is booming, the inflation caused by military spending
is finally under control, and taxes are actually being decreased.  The Visitor\'s 
are helping out not only with new technology, but massive financial assistance and
trade as well.  Several major construction projects have been started, including upgrading
the starport (even as trade restrictions, partly anti-Virus, partly Visitor suspicion of
Imperials and Zhodani traders, is increased).

Weapon restrictions for civilians have been *loosened*, so anyone with a clean record
can purchase rifles, pistols and most small arms: the crime rate has substantually declined
in response.  If there have to be a few unusual health regulatons to please the Visitor\'s, 
so what?   Smoking was always a nasty habit, but now, even the ex-Weed farmers 
are now employed in something that actually benefit\'s society.

There is a strong emphasis placed on good health and nutrition by both the
Visitors and the local government.  Diseases and illness is sharply declining in 
the poorer areas of the world, and drought is now unheard-of.  Use of contraception,
abortion, and sterilizing operations are strongly emphasised to fight the
overpopulation problem, and are becoming socially mandatory. The birth rate has been
sharply declining since the arrival of the Visitors, but there are hint\'s of an imminent 
breakthrough on life-extension.  In the meantime, a massive social welfare network
is being set up, stressing hard, honest work for a fair living wage, free health care,
and a pleasent lifestyle thanks to the Visitors.

The Visitor\'s are rarely seen out of their orange uniform and sunglasses:
the bright light hurt\'s their eyes.  Still, they are uniformly cheerful, if suspicious
of non-Conggi.

Given the technology, I figure tele-presence would be the way to go
for battle dress.  Nice comfy rooms for the operators with rotating
shifts.  That means the suit in the field is combat ready 24 hours
a day and isn\'t limited by human frailties such as biology or fear.

It\'s just a matter of replacing the trooper with servos, meson/
satellite comm gear, and a VR rig.

How about a mild numbing agent to minimize skin irritation and
a nice big hunk of cheese to slow down the waster processes.
Seriously, though.  Something to prevent the itching and a drug
of some sort to minimize body waste, if not an separate drug,
then a diet for BD wearing troops designed to produce
a bare minimum of waste.

All good points.  But I\'d still see a *couple* ships being jump-capable just 
to \'prove\' that the planet isn\'t a backwater bunch of hillbillies.  It\'d be 
good for morale, *and* a good incentive for locals to perform well.  \'You do 
good this year, and we\'ll get you a posting on one of the Jump-capable ships, 
with FTL pay, etc\'.

Campaign: The Visitors Part Two

********************************************

Referee Section

What\'s really going on?

The Visitor\'s are indeed a reptilian race, but physically near-human
excluding their egg-laying, long poisionous tongue (usually kept in a
pouch in their throat, and never seen among humans), slitted yellow 
eyes and a preference for mammalian meat.

While they don\'t mind swallowing guinea pigs whole (small rodent\'s
are typical fare on the Visitors homeworld), they prefer human flesh, and
that\'s one of the main reasons they\'re on Cong Su.  They are aware that
eating rodent\'s is repulsive to most of humaniti, and avoid it in public.
Of course, the real fate of those selected as "Visitor Scouts" or pro-Visitor 
researchers chosen to study on the homeworld is never mentioned.
It\'s pratically impossible to prove: the Visitor\'s have remarkable political
and social instincts, and are quite good at making their enemies look
like xenophobic buffons or science-worshipping fanatic ideologues.
Documentation is hard to find, even on the motherships - the Visitor\'s
know the importance of leaving NO paper trail.

The very few Conggi who know what\'s really going on tend to be
reprogrammed in a Visitor Education Centre ("You too can learn 
the technological secrets of the Visitor\'s in our special Research Centres!
Call now at 666-934-42678 for you personal appointment TODAY!"), 
and go on to live happy, satisfied lives.

Remarkably, despite the vast superiority of Visitor forces (and the 
local politicians, fully bought and paid for when not "persuaded" on their
personal tour of the Visitor ships), there is actually a resistance movement
against them.  Local, light firearms are worthless against the Visitor
Shock Troopers (due to the remarkable anti-ballistic properties of their
black breastplate - very good for their Tech level 9/A manufacture), 
but heavier weapons and laser\'s are much more useful.  The resistance 
movement is small, only about 200,000 or so, spread out on a world
population of 260 million.  They DO have a good number of scientist\'s,
intellectuals, and politicians with them, but are despised as idiot
militamen, manic science loons and ignorant bigot\'s by the general population.

[Did the PC\'s manage to make peace with the semi-Marine Scout\'s?  They could come
in very useful... especially if the PC\'s managed to obtain a FGMP, and gave it
to those who know it best...]

There was a failed attempt to repel the Visitor invasion with a locally built 
biological weapon called Red Dust.  A vaccine was given to pro-Conggi Visitors
(yes, they did exist: a very few still do), but Red Dust had a variety of nasty side-
effects.  It blighted food crops, causing starvation in a few regions of Cong Su.
In major concentrations, it\'s toxic to mammals (including the humans), causes 
an increase of stillbirth\'s and mutations, and an increase of respatory aliments.
Finally, Red Dust needed to have a cycle of temperatures below freezing
for the bacteria to rebuild itself and remain effective.

Fortunately for the Visitors, Red Dust was poorly distributed, only affecting a
few regions known for milita/terrorist activities and a handful of smaller cities.
The only region currently infested with Red Dust is the Kar Dijalis Archipelego,
which now affect\'s only mammals: the Visitor\'s now have their own vaccine.
They also used the Red Dust incident to make great political points,
declaring all-out war against those insane scientists, stressing the side effect\'s
on humans, making sure that both humans and Visitor\'s were involved in 
the clean-up, and further driving the anti-Visitor movement underground.

It\'s very, very difficult to find the Resistance movement.  Areas which remain 
sympathetic to the Resistance usually deface Visitor posters and propaganda
pamphlets with a red V, for victory.  These areas are almost always in the
"badlands", aka mountains, deserts, jungles, places where any central authority
always had difficulty governing.

If the PC\'s are good, they might be able to find out that the population
has been declining about 1% per year for the last three years, when the
Visitor\'s population program really kicked in.  (Hint: check out the
local government offices: the information is publiclly available, if buried 
somewhat).   At the same time, life expentancy has risen a remarkable 
four years during the same time: because so much of the population is 
in the local "Third World" there\'s still a good way to go
before everyone is living till their 70-80\'s.

Most of the population decline is due to the fall of the birth rate,
but a good 20,000 - 50,000 people per year choose to go on 
the saucers, to join the Visitor Scouts, see their homeworld,
by winning a contest, or getting very high marks in a bodybuilding
contest ("Build those muscles!  Get rid of that worthless fat!")
Someof the more wealthy members of society actually have enough to
pay for a ticket, AND pay for a highly valuable trade licence.  

Most never leave the Visitor\'s homeworld ("Life is so good here: I can\'t
even bear the thought of leaving" the forged videotape image said):
those that return were treated well, Persuaded to see what the Visitor\'s
wanted them to see, and are quite enthusiastic about the place when they return
("Can\'t wait to get back!")

The Visitor\'s are on Cong Su for more than just some good eating.
The are also covertly preparing the world for settlement.   After the
world\'s population has declined and aged to a certain point 
(currently 30 years from now, in 1170) a crisis will be created, the 
remaining Conggi will be moved to Emegency Housing Facilities,
hearded onto the saucers, and shipped to the homeworld for eating.
The world will then be settled by about one or two billion Visitors 
over a hunderd-year period: the necessary transports to 
move 10 million Visitors per year are being constructed.  The world
itself is perfect for Visitor settlement, so no terraforming is needed.
A TL 9/A infrastructure will be thoughtfully constructed by the humans, 
before the crisis is declared


********************

How did they get here?

The Visitor\'s are members of a military government which has conquered
thirty-two systems via sublight warship\'s in their region of the galaxy.
The government isn\'t popular due to the military expense of keeping
all those worlds (twenty-two have large, restless alien populations
that the Visitor economy depend\'s on).   It has no current starfaring 
opposition in it\'s region of space, but has no real friends either. 


The government found out that, earlier in their region\'s history, a 
minor human species invented an inferior, near-Jump Drive 
(called an Arkenstone Engine in Imperial engineering literature) , 
but which was mainly useless except near a Coisset Fragment. 
Near such a fragment, the Arkenstone Engine could - if designed and 
calibrated right - jump to a location of another Coissent Fragment.

The Imperium didn\'t make use of the Arkenstone Engine: the sheer cost and
the learning curve gave a very poor return for the information learned, and after
a few failed Scout experiments in the 880\'s it was abandoned: ship\'s
with the Engine didn\'t even budge an inch, never mind leap across galaxies.  

The minor human race - having no other method of FTL travel - pushed the Engine
for all it was worth for all it was worth, and finally made a round trip with the
Arkenstone Engine in -2994 Imperial / A.D. 1527 (when the First Imperium 
just started to go into decline).  Over the next 500 years, the occasional 
exploration vessel  (with both an Engine and a sublight drive) would be sent
to Foreven Sector, but no useful world was ever found (compared to 
other routes).

Much of the information was lost, but thousand\'s of year\'s later 
the Visitor\'s managed to successfully rediscover the principles of 
the Arkenstone Engine using both original research and ancient 
documents.  With the remarkable discovery of a workable chart to 
the Foreven Sector, the Visitor\'s sent *their* first scoutship, which 
arrived in Foreven in 892.  A small station was soon construted
at the Fragment, and a scout ship pernamently stationed here.
Their duties included charting interstellar space, mapping 
the area, listening to radio signals and sending sublight probes to look for 
good worlds before dropping into the primary to remove all evidence.

A major revolution occurred when, in 959, a jumpship was found with it\'s 
distress signal still blazing.  It was _The Northern Lights_ , a brand-new Profit-class, 
300-disp TL A trader, designed and built locally.  The trader was rescued, 
and the crew dealt with kindly and befrended.  Unfortuantly, there wasn\'t 
any hydrogen on hand to lend, so the traders decided to journey to the 
Visitor homeworld instead in the Visitor\'s "low berth".  They finally arrived at the Visitor\'s
homeworld at 1021.  There they were pumped for information, paid very well,
and poked and prodded.  They were permitted to live in ease and comfort 
for 15 years until the Visitor\'s were satisfied that they got all the information
they could from them: then they were eaten at about 1035.

 _The Northern Lights_ was brought back home for dissasembly and investiagtion:
jump drive still wasn\'t cracked until 1021 (mainly because _The Northern Lights_ had a
subtle flaw in it\'s engine, caused by the misjump), but much other information was gained.
In the meantime, a large "trade fleet" was slowly built to meet with the Cong Su government,
and unoffically conquer it. (The Visitor\'s have long experience in dealing with
small, world-bound civilizations). Moreover, a major naval base was built at great 
expense at the Coissent Fragment at Foreven Sector, which took decades to build.

The "trade fleet" left the staging area on 1057, arrived at the local 
Coissent Fragment at 1078, made a seven-day long jump across 1,880 
parsec\'s, and arrived at the Visitor base in Foreven Sector.  Then, it made 
it\'s way to Cong Su, arriving at 1117, one year after Strephon\'s assassination.
It takes 60 year\'s to make the journey via sublight ship, at about .05 c per year.

(The Foreven fragment is just under two parsec\'s from Cong Su: the Visitor
fragment is just about one parsec from the Visitor\'s homeworld).

***************************

What do the Visitor\'s have?

The fifty massive, 3.2 km diameter ships are buit with three drives: a jump drive,
an Arkenstone Engine, and massive gravitic plates that use interstellar gravity 
waves for sublight propulsion.  Smaller ship\'s use standard artigrav drives.  
Standard Imperial thruster plates are being researched and analyzed back 
at the homeworld.  The massive ships has a crew of 6500, including 3000 
infrantry Shock Troops, 1000 field support, 2000 technicians,
and 500 officers, political personnel, etc.

[ Aside: If I am doing my sum\'s right, the mother ships are about 50 Million disp 
  in size!  Not that it will stop a Tigress from ripping it apart with nothing
  but it\'s meson gun... ]

Weaponry ain\'t that hot: assume 200 TL A laser turrents, and two 
TL A laser batteries. The ship itself is largely a TL A construct, with
possible TL 9 components and  "Mystery TL" Arkenstone Drive and
gravitic plates.

As you might guess, most of the bulk of the ship is fuel for Liquid
Hydrogen for the drives, although several grams of antimatter is used for the 
Arkenstone Engine (The explosion if that antimatter contact\'s
matter would be bad, but I don\'t think it would destroy the ship in 
One Big Boom...)

There are also 15 docking and figher bays.  Assume 30 large fighters
(each with four lasers),  20 Squad ships (each with 2 lasers, 2 crew 
and 18 troops), and 20 Transports (configurable in 5, 8, and 10-cabin forms).
Each transport requres two crew, and each "cabin" holds 3.75 Visitors.
There is usually no weapons, but a weapon pub with a dual-barrel laser 
can be added.  Finally, there are 10 Tankers carrying Liquid Hydrogen, 
with a crew of four.  These are about 10 disp. in size.  Assume all of this 
equipment is at TL A, powered by small gravitic plates.

Interesting aside: did you know each Visitor Skyfighter hold\'s a 
pilot, a co-pilot, a gunner, and THREE TROOPERS?  Hmmmmmm..... 

[ Hint\'s for mercenaries: did I see any... tanks?  Nnnoooooooope!
         Did I see any... armoured vehicles?  Nnnnooooooope!
         Did I see any... artillery?  Nnnnooooooooope!
         Did I see any... major fortification equipment?  Nnnnoooooooope!    ]

At both the Coissent Fragment\'s (Visitor\'s end and Foreven End), 
there is a major 10 Million-ton Visitor base, with over 1000 laser 
turrent\'s, ten laser bay\'s and 10 missile bay\'s (each bay with 10 missiles). 


Moreover, there are over 50 TL A fighters,  200 more primitive TL 9 
fighters (which use fusion engines and missiles), and three
genuine warships.  These TL A warship\'s are a little smaller than the 
motherships, but optimized for battle, not occupation/transport/surveillance
The warship\'s are actualy decently armoured, with 5 top-of-the line
laser bay\'s for TL A, 500 laser turrent\'s and 500 missile turrent\'s.

Often, at both the Fragment\'s and Cong Su, you will see one to five transports.
These 1 km diameter saucer\'s are actually doing the transporting of 
human\'s, Visitor\'s, and equipment.  They are thinly armoured and have only 20
TL 9 laser turrent\'s, and a few auxiliary craft.

*****************************************

Now What?

After the PC\'s have a pretty good grip on what\'s really going on,
they then need to decide what to do.

[ Referee hint: usually the PC\'s would be clued in via contact with the Resistance, 
  although expirate Conggi living on other worlds - or even crewing other ship\'s - may give
  the Scout\'s a hand.  Individual research, daring raides into prison camp\'s, the local
  unoffical Zhodani agent, intense survellance from orbiting satilites (after somehow
  getting permission from the Visitor\'s under some guise or in payment for a tech
  exchange), cracking the Visitor encryption and searching for key words in the 
  Visitor language (how did the PC\'s compile a dictionary of a totally unknown 
  language?  Hey, they\'re Scouts - they should be able to do this in their sleep!), the
  methods should beleft to the players.  ]

Options include

   - Calling in the Imperial Navy.

  The typical Imperial Destroyer Squadron would make short work of the motherships.
  However, it ain\'t going to happen - Virus is banging very hard on the Domain\'s door, 
  so you can forget this idea right now.  Anyways, Cong Du was never a Imperial
  client world, and it\'s really far away - why should they care?

  -  Getting some mercenaries together

 This takes money.  Unless the Scout\'s can somehow raise the MultiMillions
 needed as a deposit to hire a mercenary capable of taking on the Visitors
 and their 150,000 TL 9/A troops on the ground (and another 100,000 local
 government troops, at TL 7/8),  this wont happen.

 The clever or poltically astute PC might find a way of getting the money,
 or get the Resistance to put some big buck\'s on the table, payable
 only on success (salvage right\'s to three motherships would be nice, but
 more is needed - including Cash Up Front.)

 - Getting the local systems together

This depend\'s on the local subsector astrography.  As this is not an offical
subsector, the Referee will have to design it -- don\'t forget the two worlds of
Byne (hex 2625, scout base, Imperial Client State) and Cong Su herself 
(hex 2626).  

As this is a poor subsector in a thinly settled sector beyond most of the 
worthwhile trade routes, I\'d cap the local TL at 12.  There might be one or two 
high pop systems with the largest local Navy, and and another five sytems 
with some kind of decent Navy (or at least some decent technology).

Getting them to see the threat that the Visitor\'s present is possible, but
they\'ll want some evidence.  Also, those fifty mothership\'s look very imposing:
are you CERTAIN you want to attack them?  And the Visitor\'s are masters
when it comes to lying, deceit, and political manuvering: what happen\'s when 
they start offering Trade Advantages to divide up the PC\'s coalition?

And of course there\'s the Grand Battle itself: the referee has several night\'s
of design work to do in order to do justice to the Battle Of Cong Su.

- - Getting Zhodani support

The PC\'s may turn to the Zhodani in desperation.  This is unlikely to 
work: the Zhodani, unlike the classic Imperium, is not into military 
adventures on the far frontier\'s.  However, they might discover the
danger MUCH more quickly, if they can mindread the Visitor\'s at just the
right time.  They will certainly hate the Visitor\'s, with all the deceit 
and lies they spew.

If the PC\'s can convince the Zhodani\'s to beat up the Visitor\'s - a HUGE
if, but possible - a small Consular Navy flotilla will be sent, and the PC\'s will
have the interesting experience of working as military advisor\'s to the Zhodani.
Normally this would be a career-killing move (well, not just career-killing... ), 
but with the current Domain-Zhodani detente, it\'s possible.  It\'s a near certainty
that the Visitor\'s will be simply crushed in the battle, leaving interesting
salvage possibilities.  Some fast footwork would be needed to insure the
mothership\'s don\'t smash into the city below them when they go down....

- - Doing it yourself

It would be a fabulous public relations coup if just a handful of Scout\'s manage to 
drive off the Visitor\'s from Cong Su, all by their lonesome.  It might even 
persuade the Archduke to spare the IISS, and let them live (at a greatly-reduced
size).  The Station Chief would be all for this, if some kind of half-viable
plan could be cooked up....


*****************************************

Back at the Ranch...

Important points
  * The Visitor\'s are suffering from internal troubles back at home.  The Jump-drive
     technology that they have is only slowly being built into new ship\'s:  the political
     necessity of occupying Cong Su is delaying adoption of Jump ship\'s, and the 
     enormous cost of building Visitor-style, "Go Big or Go Home!" starship\'s with the
     vastly more expensive - yet vastly more faster - Jump1 Drives is slowly crushing the
     economy.

  * There is increasing discontent within the ruling Visitor race, with only the
     promise of good land in Foreven keeping a lid on things.  More and more voices
     are demanding that TinyShips (as the Visitor\'s call Imperial-space ships) be built,
     but this would decentralize power from the current ruling class.

Designer\'s comment\'s

There are several modifications made tot he Visitor\'s, to make them
more plausable and have a better Traveller fit.

Ignored items include 
  * the "stealing earth\'s water" bit
  * the moon-destroying Particle Beam Triax ( a tiny world-killing ship
     with a crew complement of TEN !?! )
  * anything psionic (except the Zho\'s)
  * the corny 1983 dialogue
  
Things to keep include
  * the feuding women.  Apparently, the Reagan Era was THE high-water mark 
    for bitches, complete with frizzy hair and all the rouge you can find.
  * the cool orange uniforms and sunglasses
  * the giant saucer ships hovering over the cities ( stolen wholesale by 
    Independence Day - where are V\'s royalty cheques? )
  * gulping down guinea pigs (in the privacy of your own home,of course)

    'index' => 'dl907',
    'body' => 'Optional Over-arching concept : GWP vs Trade

Knowing the GWP is nice for figuring things like local standards of living
and defense expenditure. Total trade is more important to determine how
much a world will want to import, or have available to export. I think of
Trade+GWP as a planet\'s turnover, while GWP is what they have left at the
end of the year after the megacorps, financiers, free traders and other
interstellar slime backed by the Imperium have finished exploiting them.

GWP is explained on p14. Total trade can either be computed the long way
(by figuring relationships with every trading world - and Capital has
meaningful trade with just about everybody), or approximated by taking the
top end of the biggest trading partner (eg Pagaton\'s biggest trade partner
is Dallia, for a 8.5 BTN (MCr 500-GCr 1). Pagaton\'s total trade is
therefore around 1 GCr). If a world has a couple of equally large partners,
then add them up and add 50%. Generally, if you just look for the closest
big world, you can wing it.

Note the amount of money that can be raised by import and export duties.

Finally, remember that your freight is someone else\'s speculative good ...

Barely Optional Rule #0 - \'This isnt a speculative cargo. It\'s sludge, and
it stinks\'

All Spec Trade goods get to roll on Cargo Type, Special Handling and Terms
of Shipping.

Optional Rule #1 - \'I\'ll pay Retail\'

If you missed a Find the Goods roll by (p36), you get an option on a lot,
but at +10% price per point you missed by. 

Nasty Optional Rule #1a - \'All schlock looked great in the shop\'

You always find a batch on a Find the Goods roll. You just dont get told
that every point you missed the Find Goods roll by is a -1 DM on the Trade
Goods Reaction Table.

Only Slightly Less Nasty Rule #1b - \'They\'ll love it. We just need to baby
it a little on the way there\'

For every point you miss the Find Goods roll by, it gets a free roll on the
Special Handling Table. Re-roll \'none\', of course.

Option #2 - \'Do you have it in blue ?\'

Once you have found a good, for every sourceworld WTN point, you can get a
+/- 1 DM to any of Origin Price, Risk or Lot Size (nominate DMs before any
rolls), or get extra rolls on Trade Class Modifiers. The logic is that
worlds with big economies have more chances at getting exactly what you want.

Option #2b - \'I have a cousin. He owns the factory\'

Custom batches are possible. Each -1 DM costs 1% of Base Cost, and takes
one month. Cash in advance (nb just paying in advance could guarantee
availability when you come back. Or maybe not). Plus roll Legal skill,
limited by Area Knowledge, at -1 per point of CR for the world to avoid
unexpected contractual difficulties.

Option #3 - \'It\'s genuine Flavian Pobble Beads\'

Goods worth MCr 1/dton have a +7 to risk. KCr 100, +3. KCr 20, -3. KCr 10, -7

Cheap goods need upside, while I cant think of too many high value, high
risk goods (well, OK. I can. It\'s a game balance thing ... the dice should
*never* determine something this big. Four dtons of Second Empire Fire
Sculptures should *not* appear on the dice).

Option #4 - Necessities and Luxuries

Goods get another defining category - necessities or luxuries. A world can
only spend 5% of it\'s GWP on a single batch of Luxuries. A world can spend
10% of it\'s Trade on a single batch of Necessities, but necessities dont
get Distance Mods on the Trade Goods Reaction Table (no-one cares how close
the air filters come from, just as long as they work. Brandy, on the other
hand ... unless it\'s the stuff the miners drink to forget. That commodity
is a neccessity).

Any given good has a 2/3rds chance of being a necessity, and a 1/3 chance
of being a luxury.

Option #4a - \'We cannot front, but we have many excellent tractor parts\'

If a trader is prepared to take commodities in exchange, these numbers may
be increased by 50% (GMs option)

Option #5 - \'I bought some off you last month\'

If a batch has been bought, you can make another Find Goods Roll to find
another batch (possibly of a different size). Every time this is done after
the second, roll the BTN of the 2 worlds plus the number of times on 3
dice, or some other trader notices the niche.

Option #6 - \'What do you mean you want fishes and loaves for ten thousand ?\'

A world\'s available exports are usually limited to 2d6% of it\'s Trade at
any given point, as most production is already dedicated to filling
standing orders.

Of course, the right leverage can cause a \'production shortfall\' ... this
is particularily true at small mining colonies, where a little cash and the
right goods (food, air filters, spare parts, pharmaceuticals) can cause
high grade ore that never appeared on the production schedules to
miraculously appear, ready for loading into a Far Trader that,
coincidentally, never appeared on the records either (this sort of \'theft
as servant\' is for my money the most widespread sort of smuggling in the
Imperium).

Option #7 - \'Last month, you could have made money. This month ...\'

Each week, roll 3 dice against any Predicted Destination Price. If it\'s
less than the number of weeks since it was made, trash the prediction. 

Option #8 - \'They want to know if we\'re interested in WHAT ?\'

Traders go broke in interesting places. Feel free to make up interesting
goods turning up in all sorts of wrong places.

And finally, a quote ...


\'To say the Bank of Antares caused the Long Night is akin to saying a man\'s
cause of death was asphyxiation by blood on the lungs when he was shot in

One quibble:  The Scots are not the only people who play bagpipes.  Clearly

There\'s an article on the 4518 Lift Infantry (Duke of Regina\'s Huscarles)
in JTAS 9, at least some of which is reprinted in SMC.  It goes into some
of the background of the rise of Caranda, (the first Aledon duke), from
Baron to Duke.  

There\'s no mention of a family tie to Arbellatra, although that\'s not
grounds for rejecting the idea, and instead it emphasises Caranda\'s role in
holding the Marches for Arbellatra, and suppressing \'disloyal\' factions. 
It also stresses that Caranda ruled Regina even when he was a \'mere\' baron.


Anyway, last night I remembered how my group used to \'design\' Runequest
scenarios back in the \'80s.  I\'m pretty sure it would work in Traveller,
too.

See, both RQ and Traveller have really deep and well developed backgrounds.
 In particular, both have accounts of epic world/universe changing events
that occurred in the past.  In RQ, it\'s stuff like the Lightbringers\'
Quest, Arkat\'s saga, and so on.  In Traveller, it\'s, well, Strephon\'s
assassination, and things like that.

So, to involve players in the universe, what we used to do was to cut the
epic events down to size and run the players through them.  

For Strephon\'s assassination it would go like this:
First you review Rebellion Sourcebook, with all the accounts it has in
there.

Then, you design a suitable set of NPCs - targets, assassins, and
by-standers.  Make the target something like a local baron - a bigshot on a
planetary scale, kind of like Caranda in the previous section.

The location should be a grav palace - nice and exotic, and inaccessible. 
There\'s one in Divine Intervention, or you can mangle one up out of various
starship deckplans.

It\'s easy enough to think of why the PCs would be there - a baron isn\'t the
Emperor, after all.  Maybe they ran into \'Varian\' in a pub!

Anyway, the PCs are hanging about when \'Dulinor\' does his bit.  Whether or
not he succeeds, the palace will become a war-zone.  The coup would also
extend outside the palace, since there\'s no jump timelag on this scale.  

The PCs can either take sides, or just try to get out of there.

To prevent the players guessing what\'s going on, you have the option of
switching stuff around.  It might actually be more fun to run it straight,
given that they won\'t initially know what you\'re doing.

Anyway, that was just an example - there should be other events that can be
mangled into adventures, too.

  In 5FW it\'s roughly one-third battleline and two-thirds cruiser squadrons;
interestingly, Rhylanor (the high tech/hi-pop wonder of the map) doesn\'t
have any - perhaps the worlds about which Imperial power is built don\'t need
their "own" Jump-forces to ensure that their interests are taken care of.

  OTOH, non-Jump units are de facto SDB\'s in 5FW...

If you have a relatively low-tech world (say TL8) would they want to
procure and run ships that they cannot maintain themselves ?  Granted it
may make economic sense for other states to build and maintain your naval
vessels, but I would have thought that planetary pride would tend to favour
building yer own.  Additionally, your ability to beat a "beseiger" goes
down dramatically if you can\'t service your own fleet.

In order to create more room for fuel, entertainment facilities (more fuel

This I can also see.  I suspect that there may be a plot device there
investigating systems that are acquiring vessels that are force projector
types.  For example, why would a belt system with 3 million souls want a
Tigress ?

OTOH, the system may just be thankful that they\'re gone.  I\'m thinkin\'
particularly of poor planets who can\'t really justify following and
attacking pirates who are no longer in their backyard.  They may very well
leave the pursuit and destruction to the Imperium in their role as
interstellar police.

Never said it wasn\'t intrusive.

"Deadly weapon" equals lethal device who\'s primary design purpose is
inflicting severe injury. For knives, I suspect a length-test would be
standard (which we already have up here).

I see I wasn\'t clear. You own a gun, or a 4 foot sword, and you never use
it. No problem, no crime.

If you _do_ use the weapon, then possession of the weapon indicates
premeditated willingness to severely injure/kill. If this level of force
was justified under the circumstances, it was self defense. If not, it was
a premeditated action.

What I am aiming for, probably clumsily, is the idea that when you acquire
a weapon you have made a reasoned decision to do so, and thus you should be
held accountable for your actions.  If you _know_ that you get into fights
when you are drunk, then it behooves you to ensure that when you get drunk
you don\'t have access to a weapon.

 Sure, shocktroops. Of course, with grav vehicles in support and orbital support, this small force could be resupplied for continual ops for a long time (a la the 6th Armor (Light) (French) in the Persian Gulf - the 101st Air Assault helicopters dropped fuel for their tanks in *front* of the 6th - they pulled up to it, refueled, and maintained momentum.

 I have to say I agree. BD is going to be a shock weapon for gaining an \'orbit-head\' (amphibious ops=beach-head; airborne ops=air-head; drop ops=orbit-head), overwhelming defenders with speed and violence, etc. OR - general a##kicking on lower TL worlds!

First, I have to re-state how impressed I am by the quality of posts on this
list (perhaps because the vast majority on Traveller and equipment go along
the lines of my thinking?).

This, again, is my take on BD... the shear fact it would be a pain in the
a**e to be forced to wear it for extended periods.  Any Special Forces
troopie will tell you what it\'s like wearing the same set of fatigues for a
week or more is like... not nice at all really (unless you are a pre
pubesent teenage male... for some reason).  Now make that a fully enclosed
persoanl clothing environment even with a waste managment and food supply
system makes it so very much worse!

There are some inoventions I would like to think have been addressed with BD
in the far future though.  The aching muscle thing I have always pictured as
being addressed by an in-built T.E.N.S unit (Transdermal Electrical Nerve
Stimulator, as used by sportsmen... and even a chef friend of mine who
suffers shoulder ache in his work environment) would address that issue.
Probes in an undersuit (BD fatigues?) would simulate tired muscles on a
semi-regular basis automatically, or upon request (flick the switch) of the
BD wearer.  The probes send small, harmless electrical charges into the user
where the probes contact the skin and cause the muscle to "twitch" which in
turn massages the individual (T.E.N.S units can be purchased in Australia in
most chemists... in the US you would call the place a drug store I believe).

The T.E.N.S would handle itches on limbs and torso (though currents cannot
run safely across the heart), but can\'t go near the head at all... so the
nose itch would be a problem!  But in a safe atmospheric location, I believe
the helmet is easily accessible compared to the other parts of the suit, so
simply lifting the visor and scratching might work  :^)

Indeed, even in CT, this was virtually the only way for non-BD equipped
troops to handle BD equipped troups.  One time I had an encounter between
the PC\'s and one BD equipped enemy, they were decimated, but one PC lured
the enemy into a quicksand-like swamp where the weight of the suit alone
sucked the unit under, the added stress in movement helped drain the suit (I
had indicated the enemy had been active for some time and there was a
visible sign of low power) and that was the last they saw of it.  They had
limited RAM ammo when they first encounted the baddie and managed to take
out his weapons systems with that, but in melee... phew!!!! (The encounter
was an intended "Run and escape" scene, but typical PC dalying led to them
being cut off from their ship and chased deeper into the swamp!)

Yes, like battlemechs have replaced tanks in many new-genre games, a "1-man
tank equivalent" was how I described a troopie in BD too.  It\'s effective
for players, and although I never had access to Striker (if it had
construction rules for creating LAW\'s) I had to simply deem LAW\'s existed,
making up the stats for it out of my head using commo sense to assist PC\'s
in dealing with BD\'s!

Whaddayamean, \'there are some work-arounds\'?  Either you carry sufficient tankage to allow you to make a maximum length jump, or you don\'t.  If you don\'t, there is a very real possibility of getting caught in a \'dry\' system.  Either or.  Take your pick.

As a point of interest, In Queensland (again, I cannot speak for the rest of
Australia), if you suffer a home intrusion and fear for your life, by law,
you can only meet the assailant with *equal* force... ie:  If the villain
has a stick, you can defend yourself with a stick (cricket/baseball bat),
but cannot defend yourself with a knife or a gun!  If the villain has a
knife, you cannot defend yourself with a gun!!  So it is better not to have
a gun in the house under those circumstances it seems, as the majority of
home intrusions are done with knives, syringes, and "clubs"

As for security staff (night watchmen and the like), if they shoot a
criminal, I am assured that if the baddie doesn\'t have powder burn marks in
his chest ("He was coming straight at me!!"), you better have a good lawyer
Mr Security Guy... the warning given me when I was a patrolling security
officer, by several of my copper mates.

Not making a point here, just pointing out how some laws work.

Well, first of all they don\'t have to be predetermined.  Only
outbound ships need to know where they are and those can be
informed of the latest location.   In fact,
If isn\'t clear to me that you would use any sort of permanent
station but rather just have tankers that go out with the ships.
If war breaks out, you just keep them in close orbit (or on
the surface) and move them out to the jump point.

Also, since one of the changes is to jump-6 routes, you open up
a _lot_ of alternate routes.  That means you have to hit a lot
of system to cut off traffic.

Another point is that they are realatively cheap, and it just won\'t be
that hard to crank out replacements.  I will be a lot cheaper
than replacing ships (and so that is what will remain the primary
target of commerce raiders).

In the end, there are a _number_ of things that can be done
and they won\'t the an achilles heal.  In fact, you could just
strap demountable tanks to them in war and simply use them
as lower jump ships.

I agree that military ships won\'t be designed to use _just_ drop
tanks.  OTOH, being able to do a full jump-6 and arrive with
full tanks is a major advantage.

See my ealier post.  Worlds with BTN down around 6.5 will
have some such service.  This doesn\'t even qualify as a minor
route and, in the sample sector from Far Trader, even some
of the E\'s would qualify.

I\'m pretty sure it was J-3 vs J-2.  But either way, they had 50%
to 100% the range the enemy did.  Which
is exactly what a military ships that used both drop tanks
and internal tanks has.

I have one that will calculate the BTN for any world in the Spinward 
Marches to every other world in the SM.  The worlds in my sheet do not 
precisely follow the BtC world data, as SJG changed too much for my 
taste.  It is based off the 1117 data from somewhere with the allegiances 
changed to reflect BtC.

**************************************************************************

Scheduled services exist between the Sword Worlds and Collace. Two main
lines work the route, one Imperial (?LSP?) and one Sword Worlder (Chaperon
Blancs), plus an assortment of Free Traders and chartered ships.

The standard route runs from Collace, Dallia, Notocol, Walston, Asteline,
Flammarion and then to Narsil, and on to Gram and Sacnoth. The six jumps
involved means a time of about fifty days for the route, assuming an
Express voyage is arranged.

About two hundred kilotons of goods to the value of about two billion
credits per year go along this route, plus about seven thousand passengers
a year.

Much of the route is negotiable only by jump-3 ships, and the freight rate
is Cr 6400 per dton of cargo. Middle passage for the route costs KCr 32, or
double this for High.

The route is as safe as can be hoped for on the Imperial fringe, with only
Notocol not offering a high quality starport.

A second, faster route exists, but it is far less safe and only attempted
by the desperate and the foolhardy. Rather than taking the safe rimward
path, the route goes through the Five Districts subsector, going Collace,
Avastan, 875-496, Iderati, Flammarion and then Narsil. This route goes
through the unihabited 875-496 system, and therefore is advisable only for
those going in convoy with Imperial warships. As this route involves only
five jumps, a time of forty five days should be achieved.

I don\'t know: in the original V series, they didn\'t.

In "Real Life", the Visitor\'s would certainly smell funny to dogs et. al. and may have
a weird electrical field compared to Terran animals.  I doubt the possibility
that your typical rodent will behave more crazily in their presence than in any
other large moving object: rodent\'s seem to live in a perpetual state of anxiety,
anyway.  It\'s part of the price of being at the bottom of the food chain.

(Well, this side of plant life.)

A nice tool to jury-rig is some kind of scent-sniffer, that can detect the airborne
chemical\'s that a Visitor generates as a by-product of his metabolism.  The Scout\'s could
set up such a device: the TL 6-8 local could train a good hunting dawg just as well,
but need\'s to obtain some clothes with the right scent.

*********************************

Sidebar: That false skin....

It\'s quite a wonder.  Basically, it has a lubricant at the underside that
keeps the real scaley skin comfortable, has the ability to "breathe",
and can transmit sensation fairly well.  Admittedly, it can\'t blush, but
it does a good job radiating head from the Visitor\'s body.

Even so, it can wear down and stiffen with time, so it would need to be
changed once every nine Terran months.  If torn, it won\'t heal: it will bleed, but
a transparent fluid rather than blood.  A good ritual for joining the local resistance
is having to go through a major scarring....

*********************************

Getting some biodata:

One of the scout\'s missions is to get physiological data on the Visitor\'s.
You\'d love to get a physical inspection of them, but they always refuse
"for cultural reasons".  What to do?

You could get some sensor\'s: heat-radiation, some way to get an X-ray
photograph using nothing but ambient light (is this possible at TL 15?).
Hidden photography, to see if their gait is differ\'s from a regular human,
and if so how (it doesn\'t... sorry).  You want some way to get an accurate
mass reading.

Without a body opened up for surgery or an autopsy, it\'s *hard* to determine
what the internal organs of a being is. A hand-held densitometer would be
of some use here (if such a thing is available).  Most densitiometer\'s are designed for engineering or geology: you\'d
need to get a TL 15 medical version, if you can even find one
in the subsector, if it\'s even available at that Tech Level....

And even if you have a good densitometer map, you still can only make educated
guesses on what does what.  What you *really* need is a Visitor medical text: fat
chance you\'ll find one outside of a mothership. But the Visitor\'s are just maybe arrogant
enough to put a basic first aid info "datapad"  in encrypted format: after all, you need to
be able to treat  your wounded in the field, and there isn\'t alway\'s a medic around.

The second best option is to get a willing Visitor who\'ll submit to a ton of test\'s back at
the Scout base (perhaps a prisioner of war will do?  Some interesting issues
here...).  The third best option is getting a fresh corpse into the low berth for shipment
back home.

I expect the upcoming Scout Book will provide us with more info on what\'s
tools are most useful for Scout\'s to use.

I wasn\'t simply talking about murders. It was just a general statement that,
all across the board, awareness of crime has increased. As a result (at
least in my opinion) the collective anxiety about crime has increased.

I\'m not sure if what I was saying can be applied in a case by case basis, or
a city by city basis. It\'s something more general and not terribly
quantifiable.

I was trying to say that we\'re more afraid of crime because we\'re more aware
of it.

What do you mean, they don\'t have to be predetermined?  If you have a fueling 
station in orbit at 100 diameters from a given body, it *WILL* be 
predetermined where it will be.  It\'s simple orbital mechanics, the same thing 
that keeps Earth\'s orbit straight.  Once you know its approximate position and 
orbital dynamics, you\'ll know its approximate position *forever*.

Not if you\'re going after point of origin.  Who cares where outbound ships are 
going if you whack out the outbound fuel point?  Once they\'re there in the 
system, they aren\'t going anywhere to tell people *you\'re* there.

A *BILLION* credits or so is not relatively cheap compared to a 30 *MILLION* 
credit starship.  And if it gets whacked out, you get to spend *ANOHTER* 
billion credits to replace it.  So where\'s your \'economy\'?

I don\'t have a problem with that.  I never have.  I *do* have problems with 
somebody\'s logic when they tell me that building ships without jump tankage is 
cheaper than building them with, then say \'well, you use this cheap station at 
the 100 diameter limit to hold your fuel\'.  The numbers don\'t support the 
allegations that non-fueled ships are cheaper.

You do that by strapping on a set of tanks, burning the tank fuel, ditching 
the tanks, and jumping, which has been canonical for what, 20 years now?  
That\'s what drop tanks were *designed for*, to let you do two jumps in a row.

No.  Type C ports only have unrefined fuel availiable.  Type D\'s are the same, 
only with less extensive facilities.  And Type E\'s are just wide spots to set 
down on.  If there\'s no facilities to adequately take care of visiting 
starships, what makes you think there\'s facilities to make and recover drop 
tanks?  My take on it is this:  if they don\'t have refined fuel availiable, 
they ain\'t got drop tanks availiable.  Period.  How much simpler do you need 
it?

The ship is about to jump.  Even with T4 rules, the ship must jump within an 
*hour*.  You won\'t have *TIME* to load the space where the collapsed tank is 
before the ship *HAS* to jump or suffer penalties for a misjump, or abort the 
jump entirely and *WASTE* the fuel it burned for the jump.

This comes up so many times i feel the need to pick a couple nits.
There are hardly any AK-47s in the US. Most are AKS-47s (or dervived
weapons) that are SEMI-automatic. So they are not the military
weapon, they just look like one. Two (and more important) rifles of
all kinds are used in the tiny minority of firearms crimes--less

  Agreed, but deliberately adding further capabilities only worsens the
situation. Presumably (i.e., all tank types are discussed in one section
in TCS) external rigid tanks can\'t be "folded" in minutes, and collapsible
tanks can neither be used externally nor used directly for Jump.

  Drop tanks as written are horribly glitch-ridden in several respects,
but any further imaginative options are irrelevant to OTU.

  Actually, I never seriously considered playing colonials until after getting

    'body' => 'The Enthropic Worlds Campaign is set in the alternate Traveller Universe 
featured in GURPS TRAVELLER. The campaign is based around the events 
surrounding the Enthropic Worlds Cluster in the Imperial year 1120. In this 
campaign the players control a network of characters (e.g., agents of 
influence) that explore and affect the game environment. The characters 
should be built using the GURPS game rules, but are not necessarily 
restricted to it. Characters created using the GURPS system are restricted to 
100 character points, up to 5 quirks, and either one large disadvantage, or 
up to 40 points in lessor disadvantages. The character template system used 
in GURPS TRAVELLER is highly recommended. 

There seems to be some confusion as to exactly what players are required to 
do initially. Here is a standardized format of what the referee is looking 
for initially and each following turn. Everyone please use this format, this 
thing is taking for ever to get going and I think this will speed things up. 

Character Name:
Affilitation: (i.e., Imperial Navy, Zhodani Consulate, Freetrader, etc.) 
Description: (Appearance)
	Attributes:
	Advantages/Disadvantages:
	Skills: 
Location: World name and grid. 
Mission Statement: What is the long or short range goal of the character.
Tasks to complete this turn: Short description identifying exactly what the 
player wants this character to do on this turn. Remember turns are monthly so 
description should reflect that fact. Example, "Attempt inflitration of the 
Imperial Lines facility at the Regina Starport. Look for information relating 
to recent passage of Imperial nobility through Regina to Efate." 

Remember, the referee\'s assessment of how successful your character was in 
completing an identified task will be based on your character\'s attributes, 
advantages/disadvantages, and skills. For somethings I may roll, for others I 
will make an decision based on the level of skill your character has been 
assigned. 

I will assign your assets once I have received your characters in this 
format. Those of you that have sent me characters, please transcribe those 
characters to this format to faciltate my processing and incorporating into a 
referee\'s file. 

General Background:

This section will be a short review of the general situation for all 
concerned parties involved in the campaign. It is not specific to one faction 
or the other. Information included here is to be considered available to all 
players via their faction or agency\'s intelligence collection assets. 

The Enthropic Worlds Map:
[Unable to display image]

The Imperial year is 1120. Astrographic information can be downloaded from  
<A HREF="http://members.nova.org/~sol/core/">CORE</A>, Encyclopedia 
information is available from  
<A HREF="http://www.tip.net.au/~davidjw/libdata/libframe.htm">Traveller 
Library Data
</A>. 

The general situation in the 1120th year of the Third Imperium is dynamic and 
full of hope and the possibility for profit. The tension between the Zhodani 
Consulate is decreasing as both the Consulate and the Imperium are turning 
their attention to other regions of Charted Space. the Zhodani are diverting 
resources to their coreward expansion, while the Third Imperium is slowly 
turning its attention toward other borders with the Kree, Aslan, and the 
Solomani. 

In the Spinward Marches, Imperial interest is growing on the encroachment of 
Aslan Hatei into District 268. Although the Darrians are allies of the Third 
Imperium, their welcoming of the Aslan to the Marches is not looked upon 
favorably by Archduke Norris or the other nobility of the Marches. 

In the face of this increased interest in the Aslan Hatei, the Sword Worlders 
are watching and waiting. They are bruised and angry from their treatment by 
the Vargr and the Zhodani at the ending of the Fifth Frontier War nearly a 
decade ago. The Fifth Frontier War was a short but brutal interstellar war 
fought by an alliance of the Sword Worlders, Vargr, and the Zhodani against 
the Third Imperium to curve the empire\'s expansion into the frontier beyond 
the Spinward Marches. It was a preemptive strike by the so-called Outworld 
Coalition. One designed to blunt the end of the Imperial juggernaught. 
However, at the negotiated end of the war, the Sword Worlds was the only 
government forced to give up territory lost in the fighting. In fact the 
Consulate and the Imperium returned lost territories to their prewar owners 
at the end of the fighting. Only the Sword Worlds was forced to pay for their 
attempted conquest in land and resources. In addition to loosing nearly half 
its planetary membership, the Sword Worlds was also forced to give up claims 
of sovereignty over the Enthropic Cluster Worlds. The Enthropic Cluster is 
the Sword Worlds\' gateway to the spinward frontier not yet claimed by the 
Zhodani or the Imperium. To loose the Enthropic Worlds is to loose all hope 
of future territorial expansion through exploration and colonization.  

Not only is the Sword Worlds painfully aware of the growing importance of the 
Enthropic Worlds, but so are Imperial megacorporations such as GSbAG (which 
specializes in starship construction and starport administration and 
maintenance), and Tukera Lines (the premiere transport line in the Imperium). 
both of these giants have interests in seeing that whatever is beyond the 
Imperial border, it is exploited to its fullest by their stockholders. 

In addition to that, the Darrians themselves are seeing new opportunities on 
the horizon. They have been in the shadow of the Consulate and the Imperium 
since their reemergence into interstellar space following their fall after 
the electro magnetic pulse known as the Maghiz reduced their civilization to 
industrial age technology. Although the Darrians boast a very high technology 
level on their homeworld, the actual truth is that their actual general 
technology levels are no higher than the Sword Worlders or local Imperial 
worlds (GTL 9 and 10). With their perceived weakening of their traditional 
enemies, the Zhodani and the Sword Worlders, the Darrians feel renewed 
boldness in their own economic and political agendas. The infusion of their 
own Aslan citizen population with the new blood of the approaching Aslan 
Hatei also is seen by them as strengthening their own position in galactic 
politics. 

In the center of all this sets four until recently considered worthless 
worlds. The Enthropic Worlds. 

Military Assests.

Rule of thumb for assigning military assets to a region based on the 
MegaTraveller books Rebellion and Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium, 
will be conservative. I am anticipating that there will be one squadron 
assigned to each identified naval base from the Universal Planetary Profiles. 
GURPS\' Behind the Claw Spinward Marches sourcebook seems to support this. I 
consider a battle squadron to be based on one or two capital warships in the 
50,000 to 100,000 displacement ton range with assorted escorts ranging in 
sizes of 1,000 to 50,000 displacement tons. Numbers of ships in a squadron 
should never exceed one to two dozen, with the larger the size of the ships 
the less number being present. All ships in this campaign should be GTL 10 
ships based on the technology levels of all the planets with class A (Gurps 
Type V) starports in the play area. GTL 12 (Classic Traveller TL14 and 15) 
ships can be arranged through the Zhodani Consulate and the Third Imperium on 
a one-by-one basis with consultation with the referee as a specific player 
related asset. Although the Darrians have high technology on their homeworld, 
the rest of their worlds to include those with Aslan populations, have GTL9 
or 10 levels. Reading the description of the Darrian technological situation 
lends itself to the fact that the Darrians have isolated examples of their 
past glories, but do not export sustain levels of high technology, thus their 
ships would not reflect such a capability (Darrian players can negotiate this 
on a one-by-one basis dependent on the character types selected.) 

Assume all army forces are equipped at GTL 9 and 10 standards. Imperial 
Marines and Consular Guards units are equipped to GTL 12 but are encountered 
rarely. Hatei Aslan are equipped at GTL 9 and 10, but have access to Imperial 
traders trading through Glisten from Mora subsector and the Deneb sector for 
GTL12 equippment on a case by case basis. 

Enthropic Worlds\' Encyclopidia Descriptions: 

Entrope had a much better spaceport before the last takeover by the Sword 
Worlds. All facilities were destroyed to prevent Entrope from serving as a 
base for Darrian ships. The starport is still little more than a cleared 
space and a customs shed. Fuel may be obtained from the ocean since there are 
no gas giants.

Entrope\'s current leader is Major Kerin Yoldat, a war hero who was 
responsible for the coup that swayed Entrope\'s ground forces to the Darrian 
side at the time of the invasion that retook the planet. Major Yoldat is 
still investigating former collaborators and Sword World immigrants, 
expelling or imprisoning some of them. Weapons are not actually outlawed, but 
it takes a timeconsuming background check to get a permit to carry one.

Winston was thinly colonized before it was taken over and lost a great deal 
of its population and technology in repeated fighting with the Sword Worlds. 
Some nations are still sympathetic to the Sword Worlds, but most are loyal to 
Darrian.

Anselhome is a large asteroid which attracted colonists because of its wealth 
of ores. Living quarters are hollowed into the rock. Some of the atmosphere 
for the underground habitats is processed from the gasses put out by 
Anselhome\'s volcanoes. The only native life (whose existence amazed some 
scientists) are bacteria and lichens in the low-lying valleys. 

Torment is a prison planet for the most incorrigible of criminals, those whom 
Darrian psychologists have judged impossible to cure of violent tendencies. 
It is miserably cold and barren, consisting only of the one central village 
of convicts. They are required to work in mining and industry to pay for the 
import of enough food to support them. The prison is run by a hierarchy of 
criminals who demand obedience from their fellow convicts. This obedience has 
little to do with law and order, as might be expected. They select their own 
successors before dying.

   I\'ve been in and out of the arts for 20 (yikes!) years.  I\'ve never head
a good explaination for a sai being a farm implement. :-)
I\'ve also have several LEOs tell me the best reason for "The Club" (an
anti-car theft device) is that it gives you a legal reason to carry a steel
billy club in your car.

outweigh this advantage, but it is a real advantage.

Well, IMTU "force" includes the person using the weapon. _My_ Imperial
judges are smart enough to realize that a Str1 old lady with a sword is
less well armed than a Str15 thug with a knife.

In the real world?  I asked this question when I was getting my last
degree, and the lawyer told me that (a) when comparing a 125lb teacher (me)
with a 200lb attacker a judge would understand that \'trading punches\'
wasn\'t equal force, and (b) as I am "in loco parentis" fighting tooth and
nail for my kids was defensible.  Fortunately I\'ve never had to test this
in court.  (Last time I was attacked I counterattacked with a door. Kid
pulled a groin muscle -- he wasn\'t expecting me to close the door!)

Yup.

"Deadly weapon" is a device primarily designed to inflict injury and/or
death on someone.  Yes, there are gray areas, but I\'m running a game here,
not changing Canadian law (which, generally, I\'m pretty content with).

A 3" paring knife is a kitchen tool. A 3\' spatha is a weapon. Somewhere in
between is a gray line.

A shotgun on a frontier settlement is a hunting tool. A shotgun in the
middle of Regina\'s largest city is a weapon. An FGMP-15 is _always_ a
weapon.

Which is exactly what I was trying to say!

Although, oddly enough, our neo-con politicians are promising extra money
to \'fight crime\' and make people feel safer (election year), while
admitting (when cornered) that crime is actually dropping. Meanwhile they
can\'t afford homeless shelters, have cut child support and welfare (our
staff is now feeding two families at school)...

My personal opinion is that media outlets that splash crime stories across
the screen to boost ratings are doing the community a disservice. But
that\'s getting really off-topic.

Sorry, just been rereading Guns of the South, and the name popped into my
head. Well, that and the fact that I don\'t know the names of any other
automatic weapons except the M-16.

So are 98% of the crimes committed with handguns? (Just curious, no

One of many small monitors stationed throughout the Glisten Belt, the

virtually immobile, planetoid monitors are the anvil against which mobile

Well, you do what you\'re _supposed_ to do with cap and ball BP revolvers, put
a bit a grease on top of the rounds in the cylinders. This stops such chain
fire and also helps keep the BP fouling softer, leading to fewer jams.
Undoubtedly, in a situation where the cylinders are being reloaded at leisure,
this would be done.

This is also a lot less prevalent with paper rounds than loose ones.

OTOH, the reload times for the preloaded cylinders is far too short, as it
presumes that you\'re carrying loaded cylinders with percussion caps in place.
Not in MY pocket I\'m not!!! But with a decent cap loader you can put caps on a
cylinder in a few seconds so I\'d up the time to 10 seconds or so.

No, FF&S doesn\'t detail some of the fun stuff that can happen with primitive arms.

Consider a free trader, MCr37.08 (CT, Book 2). Now, assuming this ship was
taken care of (regular mainentance, battle damage repaired) and it has
completed it\'s 40 year loan with the bank. How would you figure out it\'s
value? It certainly wouldn\'t be worth what it is new.

Next, how would the use of drop tanks effect the depreciation? This question
assumes the ideas that Ian and Gary have been discussing. That newer ships
would be designed without internal fuel tankage, in favor of drop tanks and
the older ships would have to be modified to compete. (I\'m not starting a
thread about the feasabilty of this idea, it already exists as re:drop tank
economics.)

I was wondering how an older, paid for ship, would compare to a new ship
designed in the above manner. My guess is that the older ships don\'t have
their mortgage to pay and would be able to compete on that basis. I was also
guessing that a couple of older ships could probably be bought for the price
of one of these new ships and their combined cargo would outdo the new ship.
I don\'t have any doubt that a large drop-tank ship could outperform an equal
ship that uses internal tankage, but wouldn\'t the availablity of older ships
balance out the economics?

I guess we\'d have to wait and see how depreciation works for starships...
and the effects drop tanks would have on depreciation

The only technical requirement for a Class E starport is a large area on
which starships can land, marked for said purpose. We already have that.
But since the facilities which would otherwise qualify for class D don\'t
have the expectation of starship landings, it seems that our starport

Maybe not, Rob.  I\'ve always wondered how powerful the media was in the 3I.
 The megacorps writeups mention a few being involved in "entertainment",
but none specifically focusing on Media.  IMO, this would be an extremely
powerfull tool to sway and shape both public opinion and effect policy change.

Then again, perhaps the reason we do not see any Imperium wide Media
companies, with the exception of TAS, is due to the backlash of the Psionic
Suppressions in the 800\'s.  Perhaps the media went too far in pushing the
negative aspects of psionics.  Kind of like the gun control debate where it
is not an object that is trying to be regulated, but human potential and
innate ability.

Just a note on the concept of using drugs to solve the itching problem.. A
few years back, I had to remain motionless for a bit over four days while
being treated for massive blood clots.  I was on morphine.  Even with a
dedicated team of ICU nurses scratching whereever I told them to, I still
went literally insane by the fourth day (I pulled out my IV and tried to
walk away.  If I had pulled out the tap in my femoral artery, we would not
be having this conversation.)

A doctor later told me that a big part of satisfying an itch is the
feedback from the hand that is doing the scratching.  That\'s why you can\'t
tickle yourself, your brain knows where everything is.  So a BD equipped
trooper could use electronic massage units to keep from cramping, but the
itches will just keep getting worse, and worse...

Slight problem. "Deadly weapon" as a *legal* definition covers any
object that can or has been used to kill someone. And thus includes
*far* too many everyday objects. I don\'t know if it was a one-time
thing or yearly report, but one of the agencies that does crime
statistics released a list of "weapons" used to kill people that year a
few years back. It was *very* long and included damn near every piece
of clothing or everyday object you could think of. I wish I had a copy
online...

This is covered by the laws about "brandishing" a weapon in most
jurisdictions.

A former room-mate worked security, and at one time worked armed
security in a bank. He said that his boss had told him that if he ever
had to shoot, he (the boss) wanted there to be only one story (my
friend\'s)!

Of course, this is in the US. 

BTW, here in the US, *armed* security is actually pretty rare. Banks,
armored cars, and other "trouble magnets" are pretty much it. 

Silly legal point. Security guards in this state (like many others)
aren\'t allowed to carry nightsticks. So instead they all carry those
5-cell maglite flashlights, which are both heavier and harder. Ain\'t
the law wonderful?

I bet there are similar "loopholes" in the laws on many high law level
worlds. :-)

Product idea!

"Globes" made of some sort of plastic with a surface similar to
drafting film (sort of a matte finish that will take ink and pencil
easily, but can also be erased and reused). Make them in 10 sizes for
size 1 thru size 10 worlds. 

The ref could transfer maps of commonly visited worlds to them, and
otherwise just use them for size references.

Which reminds me. After seeing a TV item about a scale model of the
solar system in some town in the midwest, I got to thinking about
trying to draw up a description of Traveller solar systems in such
terms. 

For example:

A size ?? star is ?? feet across. 
Orbit 0 is ?? feet from the center of the star
A size 8 planet is ?? inches across
A small GG is ?? inches across
A large GG is ?? inches across
A parsec is ??? thousand miles

Would folks be interested? Yes, I\'ll do both English and metric. I\'m
thinking something like size 8=20 cm, which makes it about 8 inches.

ps. In the TV show, the guy had used the size of the planetariums dome
as the Sun. Then he found businesses at the right distances, and
arranged to have a placard there along with a properly sized model of
the planet. Earth was about the size of a grapefruit. Jupiter was in a
big, high ceilinged lobby at the local TV station and was something
like 5 feet across!

In San Francisco, it is perfectly legal to carry a sword.  The law
specifies that blades shorter than 8" are forbidden.

 There are several sets of Foreven sector data out there, all unofficial. The 
official data (dotmap, national borders and seven worlds) was in 
Imperiallines #1. I have two subsectors on my site 
(http://members.aol.com/gypsycomet/index.html) and Berka has done most of the 
Rim-Trailing quarter of the sector. I don\'t have his URL handy. There is at 
least one other set of data out on the Web as well.

 Ooh, a new name for the Vanguard Reach. Have you cleared this with the

the largest Imperial Client of the sector respectively, I\'m sure they\'d like 
to hear about it...

Millimeter wave radar will pentrate a lot of things (like the siding on
typical houses!). That\'s why it\'s the next big thing in survielance. It
let\'s you see thru walls!

With some wavelength tweaking, and computer enhancement, you should be
able to get enough info about the Visitors to make a biologist *really*
suspicious.

Likewise, with properly deployed low level radiation sources (or high
level "flash" sources) and an array of detectors linked to a computer,
you could likely get a low res CAT scan of everything inside the
carefully prepared room. 

That would *really* let the cat out of the bag, since you\'d have
*definite* imagery of the soft tissues and the ability to remove
various layers (like the false skin) via computer.

Not as hard as you think. *We* can pull off the stunts mentioned above,
or else we are close to being able to. It just requires some creative
thinking and some good engineering. 

For that matter, given the availability of neutrino sensors, I bet that
there\'s some sort of medical imager that uses them at higher TLs.

You\'ve also overlooked the Neural Activity Sensor from one of the Scout
books. It ought to be pretty revealing.

Bagpipes are one of the inventions (such as the "spearthrower" aka
atl-atl and woomera) that has been made independently several times. 

While spanish pipes and Scottish pipes may be related, it\'s *really*
doubtful that Indian and Nepalese pipes are related to them (though
they are likely related to each other).

Probably *both*.

Easily. Try to find a copy of "West of Honor". That\'s the book that has
Falkenberg\'s first combat assignment. I think it was originally printed
by Laser Books, but it may have been reprinted later. If not, haunt the
used bookstores.

Other useful bits to steal for any unit descended from the Foreign Legion.

"You are in the Legion to die. The Legion will send you where you can
die" (or something like that) on the wall in the wardroom.

"March or die!" (old Legion slogan from the desert campaigns)

There\'s also a nice marching tune from one of the books, but I can\'t
find the words at the moment. "We\'ve left blood on the sands of
twenty-five worlds, built roads on a dozen more..."

Learn something every day -- I wasn\'t aware of this.

What I mean, IMTU, is something _designed_ as a weapon. And, IMTU, this is
mostly applied to ranged weapons.

No - it is a variable number of lasers - max is three in a single turret,
but you could have up to ten turrets in a battery. USPs are based on
numbers, type (beam or pulse) and TL. Laser bays aren\'t in HG2 although
Steven Hudson did suggest some unofficial designs a while back on
ct-starships.

Energy weapon (fusion or plasma gun). Also available as a bay.

Opposite of a tractor - uses grav projector to push a missile away/break it
up. A point defense system only in a bay.

Interesting... Around here, security guard aren\'t allowed to carry a
flashlight that has more than (I think) 3 C size batteries...  NYS is
pretty good at closing loopholes like this...

ObTrav: What kind of obvious-to-improvise tools/weapons are banned at

Please remind me to avoid worlds on which the FGMP-15 _might_ be
considered a "hunting" weapon.... ;-)

OTOH, such worlds might make excellent safari worlds, for those with the
wherewithal (and cojones) to hunt prey of this type.

I don\'t know about the Midwest, but here (Ithaca, NY) we have just such a
thing (It was dedicated to Carl Sagan who was a prof at Cornell).  The Sun
is about 10" across, the small planets are about 1/6" to 1/8" across, the
gas giants are maybe 1/8" to a 1/4".  The inner planets are on the same
block as the sun, Pluto is on the other side of town (admittedly, it\'s a
small town).  Someone figured out that if we wanted to add Alpha Centauri
to this and make it to scale, it would have to be in Hawaii.

I was just thinking about this very important Traveller problem.  I was
contemplating how difficult it would be for space marines or combat armored
troops to stay in their armor for any length of time (like a week to clean
out enemy bunkers on a strategic moon orbiting the only gas giant in an
important system).  Many military situations are desparate until the tide of
battle turns decisively in one way or the other, and there won\'t be time to
take off all the pieces of battledress of combat armor, scratch the Jock
Itch in the Far Future, then put all the pieces back on again.  The same
problem occurs with using the toilet.  Here are the solutions:

1) a topical anesthetic for the epidermis, administered automatically by the
suit or at the user\'s command.
2) implanted cyberware with a sensation damper.
3) psionics (for the Zhodani or the naturally discrete imperial)

and my favorite, the solution for those unfortunate space faring cultures
who don\'t have the tech for the solutions above:

3) a military ideology based on Zen Bhuddist techniques for disciplining the
mind and body, developed to armor the human mind against the agony of space
travel.  This would cause such a cultural/attitude gulf between the military
and the population it served.  Also they would have to live on a liquid diet
and nutrition pills so they would only urinate, making easier for their
suits to remove their biological waste.

Hmmm... a half crazed space marine legion living on the blood of their
enemies, with only their mystical Zen discipline keeping them from the
yawning abyss of madness...

The inspiration for the Zen Bhuddism applied to military indoctrination came
from the book Voice of the Whirlwind by Walter Jon Williams, who did the
outstanding cyberpunk supplement Hardwired.  I sincerely wish he would do a
supplement featuring Voice of the Whirlwind.

Thanks all.

We\'ve left blood in the dirt of twenty-five worlds
We\'ve built roads on a dozen more.
And all that we have at the end of our hitch
Buys a night with a second-class whore.

The Senate decrees, the Grand Admiral calls
The orders come down from on high
It\'s "On Full Kits" and sound "Board Ships\'
We\'re sending you where you can die.

The lands that we take, the Senate gives back
Rather more often than not
So the more that are killed, the less share the loot,
And we won\'t be back to this spot.

We\'ll break the hearts of your women and girls,
We may break your ass as well
Then the Line Marines with their banners unfurled
Will follow those banners to Hell.

We know the devil, his pomps and his works
Ah yes! we know them well!
When we\'ve served out our hitch as Line Marines
We can bugger the Senate of Hell!

Then we\'ll drink with our comrades and lay down our packs
We\'ll rest ten years on the flat of our backs
Then it\'s "On Full Kits" and "Out of Your Racks"
You must build a new road through Hell!

The Fleet is our country, we sleep with a rifle
No one ever begot a son on his rifle
They pay us in gin and curse when we sin,
There\'s not one that can stand us unless we\'re down wind
We\'re shot when we lose and turned out when we win
But we bury our comrades wherever they fall
And there\'s none that can face us though we\'ve nothing at all.

I answer your question, IMO and IMTU, but you\'ll have to wade
through about 90 lines of detail before you find it <grin>...

Equipment Records

When major pieces of equipment (including ships) are purchased an
equipment record should be created.  These records may be kept in
book form or on cards in a card file, but in either case each piece
of permanent equipment should have a record showing:

Name 
Description

Finance Information
  Periods
  Periodic Interest Rate
  Cost of equipment
  - Amount of down payment
  Financed Amount
  - Periodic payment
  
  Payment Number       
  Current Balance due**
  
Depreciation Information  
  Original Value of Equipment
  Estimated trade-in (or scrap) value
  Estimated life of Equipment
  Yearly depreciation*

  
  Current Value of Equipment

Each time a payment is made, it should be entered on the equipment
card.  At the end of each year depreciation should be computed,
entered on the card and a new "Current Value of Equipment" figured.

* Two depreciation techniques you can use are the straight-line and
the declining-balance methods.  There are others, but I won\'t detail
them.

  Straight-line method:  
    (Original Cost - Trade/Scrap Value) / Estimated Life

  Declining-balance method:  Remaining Value / Estimated Life * 2 
  
Straight-line is much easier to use, because there is only one
initial calculation, but it doesn\'t handle well equipment that
declines rapidly in value during its first few years.  At the end of
the equipment\'s estimated life, it will be valued at the estimated
scrap value.

Declining-balance is more difficult to use, because a recalculation
is made each year based on the currently remaining value, but it
does more accurately reflect the actual value of most equipment.  At
the end of the equipment\'s estimated life, it will generally be
valued at slightly more than the estimated scrap value.
    
** The Current Balance Due is the Previous Balance Due minus the
portion of the payment applied to principle this term .  You find
this by multipling periodic interest times Previous Balance Due and
subtracting that from the periodic payment.  (Spreadsheets *do* come
in handy for this sort of thing.  ;->)

Example:      

"A" type Free Trader

Finance Information
  Periods  [monthly]  (40 yr*12)        480
  Periodic Interest Rate (5%/12)      0.004%

No, it was in \'The Mercenary\', on Hadley.  The locals were curious as to *why* 
Sgt Major Calvin was lecturing the troops about Camerone Day.  They *didn\'t* 
like the answer they got -- Falkenburg\'s Legion *WAS* the 42nd CoDominium 
Marine Regiment after the CD \'disbanded\' it.

Using Striker, it\'s fairly simple.  Falkenburg\'s Legion is equiped with 7mm 
ACRs, cloth armor/ combat environment suits, at about TL10, TL11ish.  Map 
boxes are availiable, every trooper has at least a 10 watt radio in his 
helmet.  It\'s almost as if they were *designed* for Striker/Mercenary.  AAMOF, 
I have my suspicions that Andy Keith patterned the Caledon Highlanders (a merc 
regiment in Reavers Deep) around Falkenburg\'s Legion...

As for the naval tech, beam lasers and heplar thrust systems are common.  The 
*only* \'gotcha\' is their interstellar transport, the Alderson Drive, though 
it\'s *VERY* simular to normal Traveller jump drive with some exceptions:

1.  You have to be at an Alderson point to use it for FTL.

2.  Most systems only have 1 or 2 Alderson points.

3.  Alderson Drive is instantaneous, but it takes time to get to the Alderson 
points.  These seem to be *everal* AUs out from the primary.  This takes care 
of the \'1 week in jumpspace\' thing.

Interesting. You could add a statistical requirement--that a
statistically significant number of the "weapons" have been used in
the last year to commit a crime. Very few (if any) guns would meet
this requirement, however, since only about 0.0001% of guns in US
circulation injure people (280+ million guns is a number i have
heard, and ~30k injuries/deaths in anger). 

ObTrav: I wonder if high law level worlds might _require_ arms. Everybody 
does service then keeps weapon as a reserve/deputy police, etc. Law level
is high then because there is little crime (the guy you rob would
shoot you, or if not him, anybody else around). Kinda like
Switzerland where there are many REAL military weapons in
circulation. An interesting spin on law level. (or would you rate
that world as low law level?)

As I understand it, during WWI the favored melee weapon wasn\'t the
bayonette, it was the lowly entrenching tool.  Having seen one, I
don\'t wonder why.

Nope.  I don\'t have the exact figures on hand, but getting a fluid to
solidify (a.k.a. "freeze") doesn\'t change its density by more than a
percentage point or so.  Water, for example, is very nearly the same
density frozen (slightly less, in fact) as liquid.  Molten steel is
about the same density as solid steel.

OTOH, carrying water (or water ice) for future refueling gives you more
hydrogen per cubic meter than LHyd (the figures were posted a week or
two ago).

095-1120
in orbit of Van Buren, X324000-0, fifth planet in Risek System

(Risek 2712: Rhylanor:Spinward Marches  2712 A325579-A)

Baron Khalifa Abdullah stood on his yatch\'s bridge, surveying the
EVA crews flitting across the long-obsolescent cruiser.  Rented out
from one of the government\'s of the nearby Porozol system, most of 
it\'s weaponry has been long stripped and sold, but it\'s spinal meson 
mount kept and retooled to serve as an underground excavation device.  

Every single hour of that stripped cruiser\'s use is costing Abdullah\'s 
family hundred\'s of thousand\'s of credit\'s.  True, the entire project - 
building a private subterranean habitat for both the new family 
residence and impressing selected guest\'s - will be lucky to get 
under the two billion credit mark, but his house didn\'t get to it\'s
current level of wealth without watching where every last credit went,
even in the familiy\'s private projects.

A burbling sound rose from the nonhuman pilot.  "My lord, the 
_Draconic_ is ready to fire, as per the modified timetable"

"Yes, yes, tell them to just do it.  Hilel, please contact the Director
on the private channel and remind him that I have delegated local 
authority to him, so he has no need to have me second all his actions."

"No problem, Uncle."

**************************************

Director Ptahmes Nen-Ptu signed off, rolling his eyes.  He act\'s on his
own initative, and he get\'s a two-hour grilling session about unnecessary 
expenses.  He carefully act\'s permission before doing something major, and 
he\'s pushed to do his own thing, as if he was a shy little boy.  Yes, if you want
the big-time, reputation-making jobs you HAVE to work with Nobility, but 
they\'re such a pain to deal with!

He walked over to the meson post, ignoring the painful eye-sores of
the largely-gutted weaponry stations. For additional control and fine-tuning,
the typical naval firing station has been expanded to a five-man mini-bridge,
complete with a seperate washroom and microwave oven.  Nen-Ptu stepped
up to the post, after kneeling twice to the large holographic idol "blocking"
the platform\'s entrance.

A few word\'s, some quick technical direction and the board\'s came up alive.
Because this is detail meson demolition work at a stationary target - not just 
blasting away at a moving ship - it took a good hour before firing started.
The very high-grade densitimeters set up on the ground base relayed data
back to the _Draconic_, which was used to modify meson strength and targeting.

On Van Buren herself, the 52 base personnel continued at their duties.  Only thirteen
people, mainly support personnel, was at the base proper during the third firing
sequence.  This was a good thing, as this was the time that the meson cannon
"misfired", striking the base and killing four people.

*****************************************

127-1120

The PC\'s arrive on Van Buren via shuttle from the Risek mainworld.
They are a small team of Protected Forces (ie hostile-env) mercenaries,
hired by the Baron to train his 20 local household troops to operate in 
underground, low-grav envrionments.   The Baron is rather on the 
cheap side, but he does have a reputation for sticking to the 
agreements he sign\'s, and that to the PC\'s is more important than
big money with little trust. Moreover, a peaceful cadre posting 
is a good way to relax from the last disaster they had on Rhylanor.  
(Reminder: double the fee\'s when being hired by infighting 
corporate fractions!)

The troops are eager to learn, and shouldn\'t cause a problem.
Their trained/regular level of experience is as anti-insurgency 
infrantry on Risek, they are used to the low gravity, but spent 
their time patrolling the domed settlements, and very little time 
outside in their vacc suits.  The PC\'s are to teach them 
aggressive patrolling of the barren landscape,
and familarize them with battlesuits, plasma weapons, 
field communications (man-to-base and man-to-ship) and
hand-held rocketry. 

The current contract is for two months; there is a base level of pay, 
and bonuses based on demonstrated proficiency of the newly
trained troops.  The equipment was purchased by the Baron: 
damaged plasma guns, battlesuits etc will be charged against
the player\'s fee, but they can use as much ammo as they need to
get the expertise desired.

*****************************

The cause of the misfired meson gun was traced to an altered firing
submodule of the targeting program: the out-system programmer 
who did this is currently being pursued by a variety of bounty hunters
(by the Baron, by the Porozol government who provided the ship,
and the corporation who who was in charge of that submodule\'s 
programming.),  with some assistance from the Ministry of Justice

The reason that the programmer corrupted the code is unknown, 
and will have to be determined by interrogation after capture.
Currently in the subsector there is no organized anti-Imperium
movement capable of financing such an act: therefore, it\'s almost 
certainly related to the Baron\'s business interest\'s.  No competitor
has claimed responsibility, or declared a Corporate War: the 
MoJ\'s investigation is on hold pending the capture of the programmer.

No act was committed against the Imperium per se, so the matter is
viewed as a local affair, although assistance and information will
be shared with the Baron as a courtesy.  The wealth and authority
the Imperium gives the Baron as liege should be enough to insure
the Baron\'s protection, although MoJ will get involved if his person 
or family is attacked/killed.

[AKA The Baron is a big boy, and should be able to handle this sort of
thing himself: if not, then the Imperium will soon get a new and hopefully
more capable Baron. 

The Imperium is simply stretched too thin for the Emperor to babysit
the Nobility: the MoJ has enough problems pursuing the latest biowar
incident, unoffical slavery/kidnapping rings ( a good TL15 scientist is 
going for 150,000 credits I hear...), making sure that the hundreds of 
major and minor wars being fought in a given subsector are all follow-
ing the rules, hunting down the latest Navy kickback scheme, 
breaking up a highly illegal Corporate trade cartel, keeping down the 
local anti-Imperial terrorist groups, checking out various religious/mystical
groups for Psionic activity, etc., etc.

Because the Imperium (IMTU) strongly discourages major civil 
bureaucracies from forming within the Imperial government - it tends 
to undermine Noble authority, cloud Noble responsibility, and cost 
entirely too much to maintain - the Nobility does not get a personal MoJ 
security section from the Emperor until the subsector Duke level.
After all, the Noble is getting ample wealth from his holding -- 
let him look to his own security.  And if he can\'t, why should he be 
entrusted with the security of the Imperium?  Let natural selection 
handle it - there are a LOT of people with plenty of bucks and brains 
who would LOVE to get their hot little hands on an Imperial Title.  

Of course, things are different if the Noble is placed by the Emperor in 
a dangerous situation (aka a battlefield, an area known to revolt against 
Imperial authority, etc) , or if he and/or his family is personally attacked 
or killed as a direct attack against Imperial authority: in such cases, the
Emperor is willing to act, probably very harshly.  If the Noble is merely 
killed in a local dynastic struggle, a duel, or due to "family matters", 
well, them\'s the breaks.  All IMTU, of course. ]


************************************

203-1120

As the PC\'s near the end of their two-month term, the Referee may want to
intruduce an attack of some kind or another.  However, right now I\'m using 
this as a "typical cadre mission" so this adventure will end with a test.

In the Imperium, just about any service you want is available for sale,
from "Professional Administrators" whom a noble can hire on a two-year
contract to govern his world as he makes the journey to Capital and back
["A Noble Patent is a non-negotiable requirement for this influencial position",
as the advertisments in Imperial Governance Magazine goes] to Mercenaries
to protect your world and train the locals.  In this case, Baron Khalifa 
has secured the services of Executive Outcomes, LIC.  

Yes, the market for mercenaries is so huge that there is a number of
organizations which exist solely to judge their performance.

Executive Outcomes prefer\'s to evaluate their charges in three phases:
physical drills, Virtual Reality tests, and a live-fire excercise: they place 
rather little emphasis on paper/datapad testing.  They would prefer to have
a aggressor group, simulate a fight between the aggressor\'s and the household
troops, and judge the results but the Baron isn\'t willing to pay that much cash.

The small EO group sent to Van Buren are quite experienced: the PC\'s
might recognize them from a former life, on some battlefield or field camp.
They carry much high-tech goodies (VR boxes and the like), which are guarded
by EO men to protect them from tampering.  The test itself will be pretty accurate,
and will determine just how much the PC\'s will be paid.

****************************

After the ticket is done, the Referee can again send the rested and
hopefully now liquid PC\'s into the next bloody fray.  IF they have done 
well with the Baron, you can increase their reputation a little after a month or so
(it takes time for interstellar reputations to grow: the speed of Jump and all that).

If they have done poorly, decrease their reputation by a greater amount
among the Nobility - bad news has more impact, is more trusted, 
and is better remembered than good news.

	The word "spatula"  is a Latin word meaning "small spatha"  and a

A few months ago, I found a GURPS conversion somewhere in the links off the
SJ Games site.  I\'ve got a hard copy, but I didn\'t keep track of the
address.  It\'s a natural for the GT players.

A general thing about the Legion, (which I mentioned months ago, but
still..) is that they fought Australians in Syria in 1941.  It was as close
to a \'fair\' \'pure infantry\' fight you can get, with little air and
artillery support for either side, and with what there was fairly evenly
matched.  Infantry numbers were fairly matched, too, in a series of
battalion versus battalion engagements, with the Legion in strong defensive
positions in mountainous terrain.  They lost.

One of these days, I\'m going to fight this one in Striker.  And in WWII
miniatures, too.

Well, a rampart is only a "fighter" in the drawings, rather than the tactics, 
though the airframe and avionics could let it behave like one, though it has 
NO reason to ever do what you\'d see on "Top Gun."

It\'s a matter of cost and scale and mission.  The Rampart cannot hold 
*ground* while a Trepida (and even better, an Astrin) can.  A rampart (much 
less a Close Escort or Destroyer) is 1/3 more expensive than a Trepida (7 
times the price of an Astrin), while a CE is almost 15 times as expensive as 
a Trepida and 50 times as expensive as an Astrin.  A DD is about 100 times as 
expensive as the Trepida and an Astrin a helluva lot more.  ;-)

You have to be joking.  Anything the megacorps want, they can easily get from 
a free trader scale operation, either absorbing them or simply undercutting 
them through value.  Picking up their crumbs (or hte little morsels they just 
don\'t think is worth the trouble) is hardly the same as "competing"

Well, if we\'re talking about megacorps (which we are), it doesn\'t likely 
apply.  A megacorp probably loans internally, amongst subsidiaries and 
subdivisions.  They are their own bankers.

Which means you also prefer to simply ignore what\'s been a part of Traveller 
as long as there\'s been Traveller.  Why?  What are your vital interests here? 
 That you don\'t even want to *try*?  This is very interesting.

Of course, even *that* is better than simply ignoring the TNS articles

A 100 MCr?  It should be, for Joe Free Trader. YMMV (and apparently it does).

Bending?  You\'re breaking, if not completely ignoring. ;-)  Collapsible tanks 
are not usable for jumps.

Which we\'re told specifically that they\'re NOT.  But ok.  ;-)

Now, the cost of taking cargo from Mercator to Glisten is Cr 2220 using
\'standard\' freight rates.

At these rates, the Ditzie Spof class will get KCr 504 revenue. We need KCr
200 to pay off the bondholders, so we have KCr 300 to pay for 200 dtons of
drop fuel and to provide surplus profit. Given that fuel costs Cr 750
delivered to the 100 diameter limit (GT:FT p66), we should manage this nicely.

Of course, the real money is made when something commercially signifigant
happens on either world, and Ganisiirdi is the first to know, because his
ship carried the news ...

I already did.  I\'ve had Far Trader longer than you. ;-)  The "sector duke" 
in question probably has a stake in the megacorp.  Remember, the 
***Emperor*** has a stake in them, too, and if .  Megacorps are exceptions by 
the very definition.

Of course.  I\'m referring to Free Traders.  If your players plan on taking on 
a megacorp, (and your campaign isn\'t munchy), I pity them.

Not really, though IYO it could be my interpretation that\'s bad.  If there is 
gererally one per sector, and it\'s mentioned that the "Spinward Marches" only 
has one, which lacking an Archduke could mean for just the sector, but sounds 
odd IMO.  One of them things not given "proper" consideration?  ;-)

Or do you mean fleets?  Could you clarify?

Ohhhh I don\'t know... I get a lot of satisfaction from having itches
scratched by my wife, and the itches go away as well as if I did it?  I
understand the "tickle oneself" part, but itches?  I recall bamboo back
scratches (and rulers, pens, and other handy sized items) work just as fine
on me.  I must be some kind of dermal freak, or do others respond to back
scratchers and the ministrations of a close individuals (I also have lady
friends of the family that have done these little favours) fingernails?

If I\'m not out of the ordinary, I\'d assume that mechanical devices in a suit
of BD would work just as well?  After all, it\'s also true that if you ignore
an itch long enough, it will go away (been there, done that), it\'s just that
when you require every ounce of concentration (like in a near-combat
situation -- you don\'t hear of someone needing to scratch in the middle of a
fire-fight [chemical reactions not withstanding]), it is a undesirable
distraction.  And having tried out my chef friend\'s T.E.N.S unit, I would
think that the muscular reaction to the surface of the skin would deal with
most itches (the muscle twitches, lightly or a visible jump depending upon
the setting -- I intend on getting one myself).

<<snips detailed description of depreciation>>

Of course, you could just WAG it, based on the analogy of automobiles:

A typical new-car loan is for five years, after which the vehicle
generally retains 50% of its new value, adjusted by vehicle model and
condition.  Since a typical starship loan is for forty years, we may
guesstimate that a starship retains about 50% of its value at forty
years, adjusted for model and condition.

After that, figure that for each additional payoff period, the value
declines by another 50%, assuming normal maintenance, unless collector\'s
considerations come into play.

Similar here in Oz (Queensland [Q\'ld]), powder burns *and* only one side of

In Oz (Q\'ld), it is the individual security personel who decides if he wants
to carry.  To do so, he must be a licensed security officer, in employment
*as* a security officer, and be a member of a shooting club.  However, a
store detective might not have a firearm, but a mobile patrolman would.
But again, if you want to talk silliness, I never needed the hassle of
having a firearm of my own, but bak in the mid 80\'s when I did security
patrols, I was allowed to carry a shotgun onto an alarmed premises (when
raised) or into a suspected B&E on my route!  However, my copper mates would
still require the powder burns should I have had to use it!!

I was never sure about that aspect as a security guard, I simply used oneof
those huge maglights anyway!  never needed a real nightstick.

And again, knives have recently come under the scrutiny of the law.  They
are now illegal to carry unless you have a plausible excuse (a fishermen on
location or travelling to or from the location would have a legal excuse,
but a fisherman simply wandering around town/shopping centre has none!).
One of my copper mates loves this law... he has a huge collection of knives
now!

  I assume that what\'s meant is that having your price level determined by

  This is workable at best only in the short term; if the megacorp is fully
self-financed then subsidizing ops that lose money with no hope of long-term
improvement means cutting investment to genuinely profitable projects or at
the least failing to provide capital to outsiders at market interest rates.

The librarians were RP (Religious Program) Petty Officers. Their primary
duties were to assist Navy Chaplains in their duties, doing paperwork and
such. Librarian was a collateral(extra) duty.

Obtrav: Does the Imperial Navy, Army and Marines have Chaplains?  What about
Librarians. Even in our computerized world I sometimes can find information
faster by visiting my public library for assistance at the research desk,
than searching online.

	Give me time, I\'m working on a "trade atlas" for the Marches but RL makes too many demands 
on my time.  I\'ve got District 268, Glisten, 5 Sisters & Sword Worlds done.  Next up: Trin.
	Interesting note: the Sworld Worlds are a notable economic power house.  Their TL isn\'t high 
but they have so many hi-pop, industrial worlds that their total economic output is formidable.

Oooohhhh, We Be Bad....

The Visitor\'s *do* tend to discourage traders, so with a little
rumour management it should be able to keep the spread of
Virus to only Cong Su and the Visitor\'s starship\'s.  

Right now (1134) there are very, very few captured versions of
Virus which are still alive, and it can\'t be found in Foreven Sector:
the PC\'s will have to travel back to the Domain (the interstellar
nation on the front lines of Virus) to get a copy.  Getting that copy of
Virus is almost impossible: the Navy has absolutely no 
problem vaping your ship because "they acted funny", and the
Domain custom\'s inspector\'s will happily quarrentine your ship
till the heat death of the universe if that\'s what\'s needed to be 100%
sure that you\'re Virus Free.

Oh, incidentally, deliberatly transporting a copy of Virus illegally
is a capital offence - and the guard\'s might not wait till the trial
("He was trying to escape, Sir - honest!")

If your PC\'s are really into being wild and wooly, they can head to
Gvurrdon Sector (just above the Marches) and get Virus there: 
half the sector is "semi-clean", but the Vargr Extent\'s isn\'t called
a Virus Sponge for nothing....

[ Sometimes, I wonder if the Vargr even noticed... ]

That hungry sucker need\'s to be caged good and tight, and brought 
over to Cong Su.  You don\'t want just a Doomslayer "KillThemNow"
virus, but also a little something a little more developed, that will wait 
quietly until *after* they are over the Visitor\'s homeworld.... 

Then, give them the quiet one first, let that ship leave, then give them 
Ole\' Killer next.

Remember, folks, Don\'t Try This At Home.  At 1134, there are maybe
100 people (out of one Trillion sophont\'s in the entire Domain) who 
can actually pull this off with more than a 1% chance of success 
(and they are all Really Busy just now...)

And the Visitor\'s *are* aware of Virus, but since they have only 
report\'s from the Domain to go on, and are only at TL A in 
computer science, you have a pretty good chance of making the
pass.

Man, though, it will be an awful sight (in both senses of the word
"awful" and "awe-full")  watching those 3.2 km ship\'s crash into
the cities.

And immediately the PC\'s will have to blockade the planet, being 
sure to destroy every other jump-capable ship trying to leave, or 
else they personally will be the cause of destroying civilization 
*THIS* side of the Claw, too.

Back in the early days of TNE, I designed some really big honking guns for
use on a Reavers\' Deep planet with really big and nasty animals.  This was
for the Pocket-Empire group.  It was the kind of planet were you didn\'t
visit the laterine with a 15mm revolver to convince the critters you needed
some privacy.

Now run this idea to Doug\'s "Dinosaurs in Space" idea...

   I have a rattan hooked top cane.  Nice thing to have.  If you can\'t find
a hapkido dojang around for cane techniques, epee and sabre moves work very
well.  I\'m told that some European Casinos won\'t let you carry a cane
without a doctor\'s note.  Some Savate schools include cane work.

    The tool, entrenching is favored hand to hand combat weapon of the
Spetsnaz.
I\'ve seen pictures of them being thrown as well.  Cold Steel
(http://www.coldsteel.com/) makes a nice reproduction of one.  It\'s a half
meter long, and comes sharp enough to use as an axe.  It will take a good
edge as well.

Speaking of good mil-SF being out of print.  The first two books of the
Draka series (Marching through Georgia and Under the Yoke) are out of
print.  They are due to be reprinted, along with the third volume (The
Stone Dogs) in June.  A big honking hardcover
(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671577948/eclipsswebwarren/002-4910
634-5555244)

IMHO, "Under the Yoke" is one of the scariest books I\'ve ever read.

Here is a short review from my sig quote collection, from an actual post to
rec.arts.sf.written

I will cheerfully admit that I liked "Under the Yoke", even read it twice!
Parts of it made me hot; the Draka are SOOO bad, they make other fictitious
bad guys look like politically correct college girls!

But doesn\'t a good set of Battledress already have feedback sensors in the hands.
Perhaps you activate the scratch subroutine off of your HUD & scratch yourself on the
outside oif the battledress over where it itches.  The inner layer of the battledreess
then scratches you and the finger snesors in your gauntlet give your hand the proper
tactile feedback.  I am sure this would be quite difficult but it seems doable.

However it wouls seem a lot easier to simply drug the troups with theTL 12 anti itch
agent before the put on the battledress.

For some solids, the density advantage is more than a percentage point. The
problem
with solid hydrogen is that (a) it requires pressure to keep it stable at many
temperatures,
and (b) it won\'t flow through pipes. Nonetheless, there were semiserious
proposals to
use "slush hydrogen" as a fuel for the long-abandoned X-30 National Aeropspace
Plane,
to reduce tank volume by perhaps 10%.

More interesting for Traveller tech would be liquid metallic hydrogen - that
can have
extremely large densities, but requires tremendous pressures, not unimaginable
to
technology that can make superdense alloys.

Still, this is one of those tricks that is so useful if introduced every ship
would use it,
and break canon...

re: as suggested elsewhere, using liquid water or methane to store your
hydrogen - this
has been debated quite a bit. General consensus is that it would be most
useful for
civilian ships (Military ships that want high maneuver performance don\'t want
the
excess weight of water) and only for subsequent jumps (handwaving that you
can\'t break
water down into hydrogen fast enough to initiate a jump straight from your
water tanks.)
Still, it\'d be nice to think of a reason why it wouldn\'t work. One thing that
would help with this,
and with the Interminable Drop Tank Debate, would be to make jump performance
and
fuel requirements based on mass rather than volume...neatly removing most of
the
advantages of drop tanks.

While I\'d heard rumors of US troops fixing bayonets as recently as the
war in Vietnam, most of what I\'ve heard tells me that bayonet training
is intended to increase the agressiveness of the average soldier.
Shooting at paper targets is one thing, shoving a foot of steel into a
man-shaped figure that\'s right in front of you is another. The "yell at the
top of your lungs and charge" bit probably helps as well.

Of course, there\'s the "maintenance of tradition" component as well. 

I can see 3I Marines teaching Cutlass skill for both reasons. IIRC, 
a laser rifle or laser carbine is too fragile for use in HTH combat, so
you can\'t attach a bayonet to it - therefore, you need a substitute for
the "rifle and bayonet" as a focus for agressiveness training.

The tradition bits and the "useful in places you don\'t want to blow up" bits
probably helped as well.

Too light.  Use an old Buick instead.  Say, an old Electra or Wildcat.

This is just one of the many messages (and canon texts, too) who tend to
describe Vargr as erratic creatures much easily distracted, mostly unable
to mantain coherent structure in any kind of action and so on.

In the last two years I have been helping my girlfriend with her volunteer
work in a dog shelter. I\'ve seen a lot of dogs, from scared, aggressive
adults who were mistreated by their former owner to puppies, dogs who had
killed sheeps and ate them, dogs confiscated by the police after busting
dogfighting rings.

If Vargr descend from dogs in the same way in which we descend from
monkeys, I wonder if all the Vargr jokes have any substance: I don\'t really
think that running an hypotethical, similarly-sized monkey shelter would be
less difficult. I have admittedly much less experience with monkeys, but I
really wonder if dogs, as a species, would justify the ideas often
expressed regarding the Vargrs.

Yes, they would probably like to ride their vehicles sticking their head
out the window, but, for example, the canon idea of Vargr raiders does not
seem very convincing to me. 

Any ideas? Perhaps I\'m confusing "domestic" dogs with wolves, but even if
this is true, wolves don\'t strike me as particularly erratic: they usually
hunt in well-coordinated groups, have (and respect) an internal hierarchy,
don\'t usually kill any more than they need to eat... they may be fearsome
and dangerous, but they don\'t act as clowns. 

I strongly think that a lot of the Vargr jokes should be reformulated as
Vargr jokes *about* *us* *monkeys*, instead of the other way around.

If this is so, I\'ll bet some scholarly Vargr found Kipling\'s "Road-Song of

There\'s a copy of "Road-Song" at

An excerpt: 

"All the talk we ever have heard
Uttered by bat or beast or bird -- 
Hide or fin or scale or feather -- 
Jabber it quickly and all together!
Excellent! Wonderful! Once again!
Now we are talking just like men.

The Vargr generally seem to be able to hold together world governments on
their worlds - that is they control an entire world with one government.
This is something we humans today are VERY far from achieving. Also they
build starships etc somthing that requires cooperation among thousands.

I agree tottaly in that Vargr in library data are stereotyped but this seem
to fit the Imperium: The Imperium to me seem fairly humanocentric and
racistic giving almost all official positions to humans, never letting an
alien be emperor etc etc.

OK, the latest weighted votes are in. I\'ve amalgamated the votes for all
non-Scout Imperial military (Army, Marines, Navy) which explains their
inclusion. The 4518th has edged out the straight logo for fourth spot. I
have also increased the list to the top 7 entries, since votes for 5-7 are
very close.

Average preferred price has increased slightly, but certainly US$5-10 is
the acceptable range.

PATCH VOTING RESULTS

Number of voters: 28

Av Price: US$8.50 (but many seem OK with US$10, providing the patch quality
is _excellent_)

Rankings:

     1.   Imperial Sunburst shoulder/cap patches*
     2.   IISS Service shoulder patch
     3.   Other Imperial military**
     4.   The 4518th Lift Infantry Regiment, Duke of Regina\'s Own

     5.   Classic Traveller logo ***
     6.   Other IISS "department" logos
     7.   Free Trader  Beowulf crew shoulder patch

* All colour variants requested, with a slight weighting towards
red-on-black, then yellow-on-black.
** Half the votes were for the Marines. Votes were scattered, people want
unit patches, service patches, insignia, badges, etc. Since this is a
somewhat shakey amalgamation, feel free to ignore this entry as desired.

*** Red lettering on black, bordered in red. So far, 4 requests for "no

[I\'ve ranked votes thus far and weighted them (first choice = 10 pts,
second = 5 pts, third = 2 pts, other = 1 pt). This is probably not an
accurate way of determining rankings, but I\'m not a statistician.  ;-)
Weighted Votes:     1=109, 2=93, 3=66 (34 + 32 for marines), 4=45, 5=35,

  I always got the impression that refs way back then (i.e., CT) to the SM
were specifically excluding Corridor, etc., but that could just be my 5FW
background; the reinforcement schedule for 5FW certainly makes the proportions
of Imperial follow-up forces pretty apparent (although all the actual strengths
have been scaled down to keep the number of "squadrons" reasonable).

  In any case, Tigresses are fairly inefficient, if individually impressive.

Actually, most of them are  still committed without firearms
Even in the US, the number of  crimes involving knives is still far higher
than those committed with firearms.

And I suspect the number of crimes comitted without armament at all is far
higher still, though I don\'t have the figures.

Ob Trav :
So, how much "white collar" crime do Traveller characters deal with or

Are any of your characters rich from things like junk bonds or insider

Is insider trading illegal in the Imperium ?

Simple, it\'s a garden fork.
The long tine is used for creating holes in which to place rice plants. the
rest is used as a normal hand fork,

Western gardeners tend to use two seperate implements, a garden fork with
all tines the same length and a seperate stick or hole borer to place plants
and seeds. The sai is merely a combination of the two tools as used for
millenia in rice paddies.

<grin>

Just carry a 20" crescent (that\'s "adjustable spanner", for the non-ANZACs )
or a solidly built torque wrench or ratchet

A 38mm socket or a set of p\'tonque (sp?) balls is useful as a ranged weapon

        Cargo=17. Passengers=20. LHyd=580. EP=10. Agility=0. Low=0.

  This is a design that\'s easy to build and to maintain in addition
to being as flexible as possible; both rapid in-system and independent
interstellar redeployment are supported by its own drive capabilities.
Series production reduces cost to just under MCr 194.

  As a true "station" rather than a highly economical tanker design the
vehicle/facility would likely strip the movement systems out and replace
them with facilities for supporting a small pusher tug or cutter. Crew
composition will likely change somewhat, but the quarters remain the same.
L-Hyd tankage is now 620 Dt and series cost is MCr 106.

  The stripped-down version is mostly a power plant and a shell; given the
TL D+ reductions in fusion plant mass and cost the unit can be built at
TL D for MCr 30 less and 10 Dt more stowage, with an additional such bonus
at TL F (for series costs of MCr 80 & 56, respectively).

  In any case the facility should be able to shepherd and maintain a quite
substantial tonnage of drop tanks, so long as the sub-contracted haulers
are reliable and the accounting system is Virus-resistant. If drop tanks
are deemed unable to safely store L-Hyd for protracted periods it simple
for depot storage to be maintained in further, _unpowered_ type 9 hulls
at Cr 1125 per Dt of long-term armoured tankage desired.

  No, but the picket ships sitting quietly in the system will - even a neatly
trimmed Striker (i.e., CT/OTU) budget goes a long way, let alone TCS money.
One of the first things you discover upon hearing that "limited intelligence"
only applies if you don\'t have a ship in-system is that scrapping a Strike
Cruiser can buy several hundred little picket gnats.

  You\'re radically over-estimating the cost of a bare-bones installations

Missions of State is a collection of adventures about nobles, none of which
are linked in anyway: The following is a copy of a review I did when I
bought it -

- ----
I bought Missions of State this week.

Physically, it\'s great. There is new art (a Vargr on the inner back cover
for example, and lots of B&W pages) and the adventures are separated with a
backprint of a starry sky. One of my players commented that the only thing
IG need to do now is learn how to make the text look interesting with
sidebars and in line pictures. I agree with this - it is very hard to \'just
dip into\' this book, it doesn\'t draw you in as it looks like a financial
report without the excitement of tables.


1 The Trial. Doug Stewart

Canon breaking effects are minimal ( a confused reference to the Long Night
happening to the 1st Imperium). The scenario is interesting and lets your
players be attorneys/barristers. Not bad at all, but possibly hard to run
on a couple of the players. I like this one\'s idea - different...

2 All the Universe\'s a Stage. 	Doug Stewart

Interesting read, based around the players as a covert ops team on
freighter, posing as entertainers. Unfortunately, it jumps up and down on
canon and rips it up and throws it in the bin...

Problems
- - refers to Ancients as the Droyne - a fact unknown until M1100
- - Set in a sector below Massilia ie Old Expanses ie beyond the limit to
expansion set by Cleon.. but this could be handwaved.
- - Briefly describes a triage system for conquering worlds that seems to
contradict M0\'s economic absorption...
- - The Vrast have FTL coms using Psionics. These are nominally limited to
one light year but there is nothing that prevents a chain of them being set
up. Additionally, the author seems to have confused 1 LY with 1 parsec.
- - The Vrast are noted as being on too much of an equal footing with the
Imperium to absorb.
- - Jump Torpedoes p24 - Say no more.
- - Implication that it takes about two days total  for the torpedo to jump
to the enemy fleet, and for them to return to rescue their scout.
- - Ship control card is messed up in filling out.

Conclusion - The scenario is very weak with respect to canon, but could be
fixed with a few mods. (eg replace the jump torpedo with a message torpedo,
move the sector the adventure is set in to trailing not rimward, have the
fleet in the outer system, make the Vrast a small PE and introduce a
lightspeed delay to Psionics). It\'d be a great scenario then, as the
players get to play actors.

3. The 13th Corban (Doug Stewart)

This is a generally okay adventure, but has more of a Star Wars feel than
Traveller\'s classic and MT material. I\'ve continuing doubts about the
author\'s understanding of Traveller Technology (he refers to adjusting
ship\'s weapons and jump capabilities dependent on the character\'s levels),
but I\'m probably switched on to more minor things thanks to the gaffes in
\'All the Universe\'s a Stage". The other potential canon mistake is a
discussion of \'when Cleon sent archeologists to the ancient ruined palace
of the First Imperium" and inscriptions apparently about a ZS emperor that
are all olde medieval style. Not necessarily impossible but it jars with
everything I\'ve read about the Vilani and leads me to question whether the
author has read M0, even.

Anyway, the plot centres around some precious stones (the Corbans) of great
value that Cleon has become obsessed with. So obsessed with that he has
sent a Baron out to search for it threatening his wife and three daughters
if he doesn\'t find it (just for once it would have been nice to have sent
out the Countess....?) This image of Cleon jars - he\'s absolute ruler of
the 3I yet he doesn\'t send out the Scout service or some military/BIA
agents to get it?

The ship (the Ransom) departs with a really clever device on it - a
tracking beacon that allows the vessel to be followed anywhere by the navy.
Hmm. Can you say FTL commo? Or even the Millenium Falcon leaving the Death
Star? They arrive at the system that the Corban is supposed to be at, and
find the station abandoned, and reports of a liner (wandering the Rim!!!!!)
that may have been destroyed. Anyway friction occurs with up to two other
searching groups and then the scenario moves to the planet below. Anyway,
the players have to find the stone, solve the mystery of the liner and get
back to Sylea alive.

Summary - Space Opera that doesn\'t understand the history or technology of
Traveller.

4. Retian and Juenaire. (Doug Stewart)

I really like this, even though it\'s just Romeo and Juliette in M0. It
plays with honour (do the players help the lovers, or ensure that the
arranged marriage goes ahead?) and gives a nice feudal feel, something that
I feel is more related  to M0. One of the best scenarios in the book. I
can\'t say much more without ruining it.

Summary - Romeo and Juliette in M0 (Swords and Honour).

5. The Princess Clone (Doug Stewart)

This adventure involves the clone of a noblewoman, and the original\'s
attempt to regain her birthrights from an evil and nasty Duke. The scenario
includes a space battle and then a covert approach to a planet (somewhat
unfeasible but very dramatic). It\'s all very exciting, and then comes the
killer blow TL12 (I assume) teleport systems as a key plot device. Exit
Canon stage right. Anyway, the plot races to a conclusion in the depths of
the secret complex...

Summary - It was so much good fun until the teleport systems appeared. I
suspect you could work them out of this scenario, but it\'s a shame no one
resolved this.

6. A Piece of the Action (Doug Stewart)

This adventure is set in the Crab Nebula, which lies somewhere in the M0
Imperium. It involves the Emperor sending the players to investigate tax
losses from the Oasis system,  which stem from a second system hidden in
the nebula, identical to the first but an exact opposite. (Hurrah magic!
Seas where the other system has continents etc). Anyway, apparently all the
players need to do is a 360 deg (!) scan out for 1.5 Light years to find
the system. As Oasis is an Imperial system you\'d think that the Scouts may
have done this previously... Anyway, faced with perils the players get the
opportunity to find the information that Cleon needs to act against the
system and have to escape.

Summary: the exact mirrored systems really blows holes in Traveller\'s
reputation as a hard SF game. And the meeting with Mr LeRoi (Cleon) blows
the mystique. Not good. Saveable with a major rewrite but why spend the
money on a prepackaged adventure?

Not to mention the Crab Nebula is not in the Imperium....

7. The Gauntlet Cruise (James M Ward)

I approached this with trepidation after the unmitigated rubbish of the
Annililik Run. Unfortunately, justified IMO. The scenario is an AD&D
dungeon. The players are summoned to Hallen World as they are all long lost
relatives of the royal house. They get to carouse with the rest of the
nobility and then run the gauntlet decks (basically something like a SF
Deathtrap Dungeon). Like the Annililik Run, death comes easily.

Summary: The worst scenario in the book. D&D in space.

8. The Khiidkar Incident (MJ Dougherty and NA Frier)

This is the outstanding adventure of the book for me, and the longest (14
pages). It combines politicking, social graces and honour with a murder and
kidnapping plot. The adventure gives a very feudal feeling and the authors
liking of blade weapons comes out in the text ;-) There are detailed npcs,
and the plot is described and clearly outlined. If it suffers from anything
it is that the layout doesn\'t help make the adventure easy to follow if
dipping in quickly for reference. It could be a hard work for a less
skilled ref.

Summary: Politics, honour and intrigue - excellent.

9. Reverse Assimilation (Joseph E Walsh)

This is what happens when you let one of the M0 authors loose in the period
they wrote. You get a dark picture of how the Imperium expands and takes
the problem worlds bypassed until the end of the first century (this is one
of the first supplements to date in line with T4.1\'s draft). The players
have an opportunity to find out (possibly fatally) just how the Imperium
can abuse its position to absorb bypassed, content worlds. The scenario
describes the world and culture in depth, but once again is aimed at the
more experienced referee as there is no real linear plot to lead the
players. There are several detailed npcs. I really like this one two, and
the Khiidkar Incident only just beat this to be my favourite.

Summary - excellent background and plot which could be expanded to be a
campaign on a world. May be hard for a starting referee.

*Summary For Missions of State*

3 good adventures. The rest are average to poor with one dreadful one and
frequent breaches of canon. Coherent presentation but layout makes the book
unattractive to read. 5/10 overall.

The book also demonstrates the need for a TL table in T4.1 like the one in
the MT refs companion.

Hmm - Missions of State is okay, but be aware of what you\'re buying.

Errata for the First Survey is on the Missouri archive and takes the form
of a text file with all the data. There were some groups who worked on
correcting this but I never saw much out put. (BITS will happily host any
Traveller errata if the authors want to contact me). The Missouri archive
is linked through the jumpsite at http://www.bits.org.uk/ and I can\'t
remember the direct URL.

Malicious Imperial slander. The Consulate is a humane society - *we* don\'t
allow murderers, thieves and liars to walk about and damage society. Thanks
to our humane ethos, the mentally unbalanced soon become happy, well
adjusted, dutyful members of society.

Hmm. It is stated explicitly in GT AR1. Not sure about the CT manual but I
suspect that is also the case.

Undefined exactly -HG2 suggests really fast (multiple times a second)....

Off/On/Flicker decision once every 20 min (decision made each HG combat
round). However, probably near instantly in relaity.

I believe most standing armies (and branches therein) still give bayonet
training.  The British Royal Marines last used a bayonet charge as recently
as the Faulklands against Argie troops.  On little known, not made public
report sites that many of the Argentinian  captured had freshly soiled
pants, as did some of the dead.

Not a noble way to die or be captured and the British made it known to other
Argie troopies what had happened.  It is believed that the afore mentioned
incident was another reason why the Argentinian troops on the island
capitulated so quickly towards the end.  But that is just "hearsay."

4.5 light years is ~4.5e16 m. The Sun is ~14e8 in diameter. So yeah, I
get about 5000 miles if the Sun is 10".

There\'s a quite good tune someone came up with for this (to make it
scan a couple of lines turn into spoken comments rather than verses of
the song).

The above can be stuck into Traveller easily. Especially since the only
"named" references are "the Senate", "the Fleet", "the Line Marines",
and "Grand Admiral". 

I suspect that nobody has any troubles with the idea of the Senate
"giving back" conquered (pacified) territory "rather more often than
not"? :-)

Just about all of the Falkenberg stories make "interesting" mercenary
tickets. Though the one on Jefferson is rather hairy!

Of course, I have my doubts about most players being able to handle the
situations even half as well.

Well, the thing is that the unlike the Nazis or the various Communist
or Fascist bad guys, the Draka are *not* amoral SOBs. They are *moral*.
And they\'ll live and die by their moral code. 

It\'s just that according to that code, the rest of humanity is their

Hmmm. Picture the poor Kzinti in the Draka universe. :-)

Ooo! Nasty. 

Virus, whether the unlikely official version or my much stripped down
version, will go thru those primitive computers like candy. 

And just for fun, infect them by letting them "steal" a state of the
art portable computer that they think has critical, but encrypted data
on it. Something that they\'ll want to send to the homeworld before even
trying to crack it. :-)

Pick the right strain of the virus, put it in an isolated system and
feed it data via a one-way com link. You may be able to convince it
that the best bet is to take the ships back to the Visitor homeworld.
And just maintain the base at the Fragment as a means of keeping the
Imperium from chasing it.

Try the sequel "Beowulf\'s Children". Grendels are *not* the most

And an FGMP-15 will just make things worse. :-)

It occurs to me that something like army ants on "speed" could be even

Either way, all the FGMP will do is ignite a *nasty* chain-reaction

Hydrogen ice does *not* have a density of 1. It has a density of .071
according to my handy periodic table. LH2 will be a bit less dense.

I doubt that. 

But as a *mining* tool, I\'ll believe!

Heck, Dig up a copy of H. Beam Piper\'s "Four Day Planet". Fenris, it\'s
climate and lifeforms are well detailed. 

Would you believe a world much like earth except that it\'s days are so
long that there are only 4 days a year? And with sea critters (that are
hunted for a valuable export) that require 40mm auto-cannon to kill!
As well as machine gunners to cover the "cutting up" party. 

Fenris would fit right into the Imperium as a backwater world, just as
Piper described it.

  Here\'s the basic C3 fast trader:

                FM-2431131-000000-30000-0       MCr 131.00     200 tons
                  batts.          1                               TL=12
                                                                Crew=4
        Cargo=40. Passengers=8. LHyd=66. EP=6. Agility=1. Low=0.

  Even at 50% over standard Traveller carriage rates this ship can\'t make
a significant return to capital. (assumes 35 trips/p.a., 100% loading at
x1.5 rates for MCr 6.3, versus MCr 5.25 annual mortgage payments based on
the seris production cost of MCr 105).


  Here\'s your C3 fast trader on drop tanks:

                FM-2431131-000000-30000-0       MCr 131.01     200 tons
                  batts.          1                               TL=12
                                                                Crew=4
        Cargo=100. Passengers=8. LHyd=6. EP=6. Agility=1. Low=0.

  The cost using the tanks can be presumed to be KCr 60 per run; if the
basic version is able to make any return then this vessel will also.
Under the previous set of assumptions this vessel makes a further MCr 3.15
per year, which is the difference between mediocre performance and not.
Of course, this all assumes a shipping environment prior to adjustments
for drop tank freighters long-term economic impacts.

  See the difference?


  Here\'s the munchkinized C3 fast trader:

                FM-2431131-000000-30000-0       MCr 127.47     200 tons
                  batts.          1                               TL=12
                                                                Crew=4
        Cargo=40. Passengers=8. LHyd=66. EP=6. Agility=1. Low=0.

  This affront to the gods has drop tanks installed but never uses them.
(i.e., design is as an over-powered 160 Dt hull with 60 Dt tanks welded on)
Thus, 60 Dt of the LHyd tankage is running at KCr 1.0 per ton rather than
KCr 60. While the difference is small (~3%) on such an inefficient design it
will be substantially greater on higher tech (lower PP multiplier), lower
jump or larger designs (less influence on total cost from the computer or
J-drive as appropriate).

  Obviously, as has been mentioned before, if this is allowed then all
current non-GT designs are "inefficient" for having failed to abuse this
device. Ironically, if TCS had run events for economic performance we\'d
have seen this fixed by now.

If somebody has told you that, then that somebody is mistaken. OTOH, I
suspect that you may just have misunderstood his point. A drop tank ship
is not cheaper than the same sized conventional ship. But it carries
a lot more cargo and/or passengers, so the per-unit cost is smaller.
Or that somebody may have been talking about ships with an equivalent
capacity, which will be smaller and cheaper. Considerably cheaper,
especially with high jump numbers.

There are two sets of data in the book - the players (which only has the
physical data on worlds) and the referee\'s (which is the full data
including the Law Level = Gov mistake). I assume full data refers to the
referee\'s data.

In Chester (UK, on the Welsh/English border) there is still a local bylaw

and high passengers at "normal" rates is MCr 26.53/year, or ~MCr 40 at +50%
express rates. If some sections are middle passage stewards can be dropped.
Armament is certainly adequate. A drop tank version would carry up to 300
additional tons of cargo at an extra cost around KCr 1.0/ton. MCr 334.4 and
86 weeks to construct in series.

  The munchkinized welded-droptank version loses some hardpoints but gets
a significant saving on costs for exploiting the absurd design glitch that
drop tanks represent in this case - ~4.3% (MCr 17.7)

  A free trader unable to afford replacement tanks at a port is in the

You had to ask, didn\'t you?  A quick run through my notes comes up with

I think that was a name the planet took after the Virus collapse.  Perhaps

I have been mulling over this vs. true spherical triangles over the weekend.  I
think that it is the way to go. the disadvantage is that the  distortion is more
severe than the projection of spherical triangles.  I think that that is
outweighed by the upsides, which are:
(1) lines of latitude are straight lines on the map.  "How far north?" is a
simple question
(2) the math for the mapping is really very simple, at least for us old guys who
can\'t find their trig textbooks any more.

I\'ll have to come up with the equations and crunch this a bit.  The official
"Traveller" projection?  Is this the projection they used for Invasion:Earth, or
did they do something fancier (or perhaps a bit more loosey-goosey)?

Anyone out there have their books to hand?  What are the official size codes,
and their diameters in km (and is this a can of worms?  has it varied from
version to version?).

"We\'re currently working on a means of storing
the anti-matter,"  he says. "The really tricky
thing is that you don\'t want it to come into

annihilated. So we\'re building containers that
hold it in a really strong magnetic field so
it\'s basically levitated inside the container."

"Once we\'ve finished working on the container
technology we are planning to get some anti-matter
from Chicago and check that we can actually collect
and transport the system successfully."

"Then, probably in two years from now, we hope to
have a  demonstration model set up that we will
propel with an anti-matter drive. We\'ll invite
people from Nasa and the press to come and see
the first time ever somebody has propelled a

One question: how modular are starship components? When that
annual maintenance comes around, are things getting repaired or
replaced**?

With 2% of purchase price paid every year for maintenance, in
addition to any payments for anything actually worn out or damaged
between annual maintenance stops, it may be that your 40 year old
free trader has a 5 year old sensor array, an 8 year old laser turret
mechanism, a 2 year old fusion containment shell, etc., etc., etc...

Older ships should be incrementally harder to maintain and repair,
but I think it should hit a limit at some age, to represent a ship that
is less and less original/outdated equipment and more and more 
modern, maintainable subsystems. Sure, it would be tough to find
circuit boards for a MeriTech Wideband Scanner nowadays, but that
system was installed in the _Faraway Lady_ back in 1076 - we ripped
that out and put in a nice InterComp 23XR years ago...

Walt Smith

** By "replaced", I of course mean that the maintenance yard pulled
the part, replaced it with a reconditioned one, and sent the old part to
their shipyard workshop to be reconditioned for the next ship. Since the
shipyard is only paying labor and tools, plus the occaisional part they
initially accept as "refurbishable" but later have to discard, they may be
able to swap pretty expensive parts.

	Depreciation is an accounting convention.  Economists don\'t really believe in it.  An 
asset\'s value depends on what its use to you is and/or what others will pay you for it.  For a 
business asset like a starship, the only thing that matters is how much money it can make you 
and how much it costs to operate.  Presumably an old ship hauls cargo just as well as a new one.  
Maybe it\'s a little harder getting passengers, but assuming not, it earns just as much revenue 
as a new ship.  The only way an old ship becomes less valuable is if it costs more to maintain.  
Presumably this is the case.  The value of a ship drops until the Return on Investment from 
buying an old ship matches that of buying a new ship less the greater operating costs.

	When news about drop tanks breaks the value of every conventional ship drops until it gets 
the same ROI as a new drop tank ship.

	Yep.  Conventional ships will be on the scene until they wear out.  Drop tanks will 
replace them slowly rather than all at once.

8 minutes something for light to go an AU. Telepresence from orbit would be
less than 1 second lightlag two way given an orbit of less than 150 000 km.
Not much as most combat decisions are on a longer timescale than that.
Equip the battledress with some low level robotics to have it walk around
on its own when out of contact and you\'d be fine.

A decent BattleDress with operator inside would probably also have some low
level robotics in to walk an unconscious soldier to safety etc (or for the
cynic; to walk that expensive piece of technology home possibly ejecting
the meat inside to speed up).

I think the only law concerning legal killing on bridges only applies to

The point is not to compare the Trepida or Astrin to the Rampart, but to
the Air/Raft.

If any armored or unarmored vehicle can be killed from orbit, there is no
need for heavy weapons or heavy armor on vehicles.  Only enough armor to
resist fire from foot (armored) infantry is needed.

Hmm.  I\'ve heard this somewhere before . . .

Adventure Idea:  Zhodani Gulag.
Somewhere that the \'independent\' types with psionics are sent,
as well as any proles resistant to reeducation.  PCs are hired
by a Zhodani ex-patriot to break in and help a formerly high-ranking
Zhodani noble out, so that the Zhodani revolution can move forward.

Well, for one, Vargr are descended from canids the same way we are
decended from early primates, Canis familiaris is actually a newer
species than Vargr are; more properly they are descended from whatever
the ancestor of Canis lupus, or the wolf, was.

Wolves actually have rather extraordinarily stable social groupings, and
even dogs will form a stable pack after a time of sorting out the
hierarchy. The actual leadership, and exact grouping of the pack
hierarchy may be fluid, but the _structure_ is quite stable.

However, there seem to be limits on the size of stable packs, derived
from the personal control of the pack alpha; this seems to be the basis
of Vargr sociology. The rest seems to have been invented from whole
cloth, to make them an interesting alien.

Which, don\'t forget, they are...they\'re no more wolves in funny clothing
than we are australopithecines in funny clothing...

Moreover, they were rather extensively tinkered with by Grandfather, so
all bets are off.

In general, though, the stereotype of Vargr in the Third Imperium is
just that, a stereotype.

Yup, we Brit\'s just don\'t consider it a \'proper\' war without at least
one bayonet charge <g>, especially against low morale conscripts.

I\'m not 100% certain, but I *think* some of the British troops in the
Gulf used their bayonets in action.

The main reason for bayonet charges is to cause the enemy to rout /
surrender, not to actually stab them (unless they *don\'t* get the
message <g>).  Since the development  of massed volley fire with
muskets,  infantry charges seldom end in melee as either the side
being charged runs away or surrenders, or they put up sufficient
firepower to cause the chargers to retreat.  Only when charging strong
defensive positions do both sides tend to get into an actual melee, as
the defenders are unlikely to run or surrender until physically
beaten.  Solid walls are a great morale booster <g>

Uh-huh.  So when you walk into an ambush, and the Claymores are going off
around you and you\'re being raked with autofire, that extra second won\'t hurt?

The BD designs I\'m playing with using GURPS vehicles all have computers
that can get the operator out off trouble.  The problem is, if the operator
is injured, there\'s usually large holes in the armor, meaning that system
efficiency is wayyy down.

On another note concerning telepresence and robots in combat, I\'ve always
seen the Zhodani reliance on warbots to be a reflection of a culture that
doesn\'t produce too many warrior types.  To be honest, I don\'t think they
want too many proles with a fighting mind set.

Thing is, they don\'t start looking good til about 5000 tons.  A 1000 ton 
station is good for fueling up stuff like 200 ton Free Traders, mebbe a couple 
subbie liners, but that\'s about it.  The 10KT \'bulk frieghters\' need 1000 tons 
of hydrogen *per jump number*.  I can see this station being used by the XBoat 
system at 1000 tons, though you\'d probably want to tack on some modules to 
allow you to do some maintanance of the Xboats.

Again, you\'re not looking at the *system*.  With a stock Free Trader, the \'system\' is one ship, the Free Trader.  With fueling stations, the system is the Traders *and* the fueling station.  Now postulate an attack on the station.  Since it\'s sitting there, undefendable, it\'s toast.  Your system is now broke until you replace the station.

The \'economy\' you\'re talking about is only with 1 *component* of the system, *not* the system.  And it absolutely *relies* on the system.

Funny, I\'ve been *assured* an Armoured Beachball From Hell can carve the 
testicles off a fly at 1.48 million klicks on a stationary target (see my late 
not-lamented piracy thread of about 6-8 months ago) the size of your average 
Corsair.  Those are an order of magnitude *SMALLER* than a 5KT fueling 
station.  Under this theory, you don\'t have to get within orbital distance of 
the target; it\'s not going anywhere.  So *WHY* is a 400 ton Corsair toast at 
1.48 million klicks with *one shot* and a 5000 ton fueling station 
invulnerable at that distance?  Can\'t be armour; I\'ve been assured that armour 
is irrelevant.  Can\'t be mobility; a plain jane station has *zero* mobility.  
Can somebody please explain this to me?

I was using numbers by the book, in a canonical fashion, not using wishful 
thinking.  Under HG rules, you *NEED* that bridge and a high powered computer, 
and you *ALSO* need at *LEAST* a Power Plant-1 to power the specified 150 beam 
lasers in 50 turrets on that 5KT hull.  WRT the military disadvantages, the 
damned things are indefensible under *ANY* rules system I can see.  It\'s a 
sitting duck waiting to be broiled with a nice honey glaze.

You\'re not looking at the whole picture.  You end up with *TWO* hulls, not *ONE*.  One\'s the ship.  The other is the fueling station.  Building one ship is cheaper than building a ship *and* the fueling station to let it jump.  And the fueling station is inherently more vulnerable in wartime; it\'s almost *trivial* to take it out because it *ain\'t goin anywhere*, so when your ship comes home, you\'ve got a multimillion credit ship *STUCK* in its home system, running up bills and not generating income for you.

The more fueling stations you have to build to replace the ones getting whacked out by commerce raiders, the higher per ton cost of shipped goods.  The money doesn\'t come from nowhere, it has to be generated.  If you\'re waiting for your fueling station to come online, you can\'t generate the money to get the station back online.  Simple economics.

But orbits can be changed.  (in Traveller, they can be easily
changed) and ship outbound mearly have to ask for coordinates.

Well, planets that export a lot are easily going to have spares
(in fact, these things are cheap enough that you are likely to
have a bunch a small ones in different locations, rather than
one large one, which will make taking them all out quite difficult).

Even so, you would only temporarily prevent exports from _one_
world.

I think you are picturing huge space stations.  That is not what
you would have.  You would have a few fuel tanks and that is
about it.  You might put a thruster pack on them if you want
to move them around.

I couldn\'t disagree more.  The numbers I (and Ian) have posted
in this thread say otherwise.  Even number from more sceptical
members admit to _at least_ a 25% savings (and probably considerably
more).

Well, it isn\'t that simple.  They have been
briefly mention and generally not explored at all.  (Its like there
is a news entry about the discovery of jump-8, a ship design and
maybe another mention, and then no discussion of it at all).  They
cause a number of problems that have never been addressed.  In
fact the description of what jump fuel is used for in GT contridicts
the description of how they work.  The fact that the trader in
the Traveller Adventure had only demountable tanks to get across
j-2 rifts indicates they aren\'t in general use.

None of which prevents you from parking a fuel shuttle at the port.

The only facility you need is a fuel shuttle.

But you really aren\'t deliberately adding further capablities.
They follow from the descriptions as presented.  IMO, it is far
better for GT to avoid "reintroducing them".  That way all you
have to do is either ignore the TNS entry or accept that, for
some reason  they turned out to be impractical.  The latter
is a bit hokey, but at least you do it once (especially since
it saves you having to reconcile the description of how
fuel is used that is present their with how it is presented
elsewhere) rather than
having to have a suite of hokey explainations to make sure
they work a certain why, having to come up with a more
complicated explination that walk a blade\'s edge of "just
barely pratical", and having to be reminded of all this everytime
you think about them.

I use a semi-canonical interpretation of LL as being the chance
that you will experience a significant encounter with the law
enforcement arm of the local government.  Under that scheme, what
you\'re describing might very well be a low LL, because with low
crime, the police have less reason to hassle you.  OTOH, if
"stop-and-frisk" is routine, that would imply a high LL,
regardless of what the actual crime rate or legal weapons are.

That makes sense. I once read somewhere (don\'t remember...drat) that the only 
real use for the bayonet (besides the reasons previous posters stated), is 
for 1) crowd control and 2) for VERY close quarters work, like house 
clearing, where someone could pop up suddenly after catching a soldier in the 
middle of a magazine change. As a lot of the new bayonets are doing double 
duty as fighting knives/multi tools, there is no extra weight for the soldier 
to carry as he is already going to be issued some kind of tool...l. My 
personal opinion is that it\'s a useful auxiliary as I have to carry a knife 
anyway...

 It fits with the duty to others concept of Zho society. By using warbots,
the Zho forces are exercising their duty to protect intelligent, albeit
disenfranchised, life. GT AR1 has an interesting comment about the Zho not
wanting to fight, or consider genocide, but that they will if pushed.

The main system is that from the FFW boardgame, represented in Imperial
Squadrons for T4. No one has produced a system which links designs at HG
level to this though.

The IS version ties the fleet sizes to Pocket Empires\' data.

Don McK produced a Bk 4 Mercenary-like system a while back.

Walt S has been working on an intermediate system between HG and TCS.

Better yet, how about 100-150 km behind the FEBA in a
command vehicle?  Effective lag at that distance?  Zero.
I don\'t have FF&S, how small can you make a meson comm
rig.  [Including the electronics/crypto-gear to tell the
command vehicle how to update the unit\'s realtime location
and thus maintain constant communication.]

A GURPS Monowire sword/knife/bayonet would be effective against BD that\'s
as light as the stuff in canonical Traveller (not the abomination that is
in Star Mercs... )  OTOH, Monowire isn\'t really canon AFAIK.

Details:  a ST 12 (reasonable for a soldier) has base swing damage of 2d-1.
 A broadsword does sw+1 damage for a total of 2d.  Adding monowire adds
another die of damage plus a 10 armor divisor.for a total of 3d(10)  That\'s
an average of 10.5 points of damage, which can penetrate an average of 105
points of DR and a maximum of 180..  This is not too bad, considering that
the GTL10 BD in GT has a DR of only 150 at best.  Admittedly, the GTL11 one
has 240DR on the head/torso (and my version of GTL12 BD has DR300).
However, if you can either get significantly stronger troops, better
weapons (like a Space Axe!) or best of all, give these weapons to powered
BD troopers, melee weapons can be quite effective.  Another option is
monowire claws/spurs on the BD....

Hmm, this would be an awesome project for GT...  A fully integrated combat
system, one that can be used for anything from two Ramparts facing off to
hundreds of Battleships....  Dunno how it could be done though... :)

IIRC, there was an article in Wired that compared optimal speed for "twitch"
games, the fastest speed people could react to, or handle the information,
and it was 70ms.  Which is also the time it takes light to go from one side of the

globe to the other.  (I\'m not going to do the math myself). ;-)

Good thinking.  Further supported by their emphasis on wearing their
funky combat armor.

  IMHO you\'re quite right about the military down-side, although that\'s not
very relevant more than 15-20 parsecs from the frontier. However, the big
military disadvantages won\'t stop the sector lines & megacorps from going
over to the new system in a decade or three at most; the potential economic
advantages are too great for a border war every couple of centuries to be
a big concern.

 And, of course, warfare within the heartlands of the Imperium is unthinkable.

 i) scaling one up is pretty darned simple, although it will of course be
even more cost-efficient; at TL F that 5000-tonner will cost ~MCr 270?

 ii) Oops! I just added four 1000-ton "fuel rocks" (1kt type 8 hulls, unfitted)
to the cluster, for 3200 Dt of tankage at a further cost of MCr 2.88. Total 
cost of the F-0 Service Station is now somewhat under MCr 59 for 3840 Dt/L-Hyd.

A new character career for Traveller _and_ a campaign idea right in the
same post!  I can\'t wait to see the character generation table.

Seriously, this is an issue in running interstellar armed forces.  Shaka
Zulu found that keeping the men in close quarters with limited
opportunities for female companionship made them more aggressive in
battle.  The Royal Navy of the same period found only an increase in
buggery.  In a force integrated with respect to gender and species,
policies to maintain military readiness will have to be carefully worked
out and monitored.  Studies are probably constantly being done.  ("Yeah,
well, it was hell serving on Resurgent Dragon in the 1090s, with that
sex study being done and us all the subjects.")

No, it seems that you should have two guns in your home -- one for the
dead intruder, and one for yourself.  Bear in mind that I\'m not giving
any legal advice here, but it is the way some Traveller characters I
(and others ) have played would approach this particular problem.

This shouldn\'t be a problem, either.  Once he\'s down, you can put those
powder burns wherever you need them.  (See disclaimer above.)

I\'ve heard that household melee weapons should be things that you\'re
used to having in your hand anyway.  So a broom (which is just a bo
stick with bristles on one end) is good household weapon (for the person
who does the sweeping), as is a telephone.  I would say that I\'m very
very used to having a pen in my hand, but except for the steel Cross
pen, a pen would only be effective if I could stick it in my opponent\'s
eye.

What will the familiar household items of the future be?  These are
weapons that PCs intruding where they\'re not supposed to be (and we all
know PCs like that) might face.

  Sure, the 5kt fortress model was a bit deranged, but that\'s the designers
problem, not mine :>  But an actual fuel station is clearly quite reasonable
if built at a level appropriate to its siting. The fuel-rocks are actually
quite reasonable, although it might be about time to have type 8 & 9 hulls
pay for interior stowage space; KCr 1/Dt for interior fuel tankage and 0.5
for cargo space are very low but that can\'t be helped so long as various
other tankages list at KCr 1.

  I\'ve argued the military vulnerability of these systems at length myself,
so I\'m not arguing that. However, "building one ship is cheaper than building
a ship *and* the fueling station" sounds more like a credo than the result of
analysis; a small station such as I outlined earlier would require something
like KCr 100 in weekly business to make a profit, less if tweaked radically.

OK, so perhaps as the Vilani ship was falling into the atmosphere, the
crew were bailing out in personal re-entry things.  Some of them landed
in India and Nepal, and others in Spain.  The ship itself, with the golf
clubs, crashed near the Orkneys, and the crew who stayed with the ship
were able to recover them.

How do you referee if you can\'t analogize the NPCs\' weapons for your
PCs?  

Ref:  Two guys with weapons in hand are approaching the front of the
hotel.  
PC #1:  What kind of weapons?
Ref:  They look sort of like Schmeissers, but with very thick barrels.

Schmeissers and Thompsons and Heckler and Kochs
Lugers and Rugers and quick-shooting Glocks
Uzis and Ingrams and modern Sterlings
These are a few of my favorite things.

(Sorry:  Luger, Ruger, and Glock only make semi-automatic pistols, but I
couldn\'t find anything to rhyme with FN or Mac-10 or Browning Automatic
Rifle or M-14.)

An FGMP-15 might also be a mining tool.  After all, Seeker-class Type S
ships carry pulse lasers for that purpose.

Assassins broke into my character\'s hotel room while she was in the

shampoo, right in the eyes.  Grabbed his SMG, and held off the other
assassins until help arrived.

  External folding fuel tanks that take up negligible internal volume aren\'t

  Agreed. We\'ve both been on that side of that question since the start.
But you\'re still wrong about the implications of fuel stations for the

I can live with that.

Another point is that IMTU the legal system is civil rather than common
law. Thus precident has less importance than it does in Anglo-Saxon
countries. (And yes, I suspect that my understanding of civil law is
flawed, but I haven\'t any lawyers playing in my campaign so it\'s good
enough for now.)

No. it isn\'t.  In fact, it\'s specifically forbidden(GT 109).  The one
loophole is hyperdense, which actually seems Traveller-compatible to me, at
least in a moderate space opera version.  (Superdense isn\'t enough denser
than steel to qualify as hyperdense in GURPS terms, but it\'s close enough
for a handwave, I think.)

Hyperdense melee weapons are a lot like monowire/vibro weapons in effect;
they have increased damage (+2d6) and a dramatic armor piercing ability
(divide by 10) for an increase of 50% in weight.  The net result is that a
hyperdense cutlass (probably just a core of hyperdense in a crystaliron
jacket) can penetrate battledress with some reliability when wielded by
someone likewise in BD.  A strong human can just barely wield one without
assistance, although they can\'t penetrate battledress without a powered
assist. 

IMTU, Marines use their hyperdense cutlasses in battledress for boarding
operations and the like. Very handy when you don\'t dare overpenetrate. 

They also occasionally use hyperdense needles in the gauss battle rifles
that are their main personal weapons (actually rifle plus electro-mag
grenade launcher).  IMTU, the FGMP-15 is a fire team support weapon, not
general issue.

Those are all way too obvious.  With the possible of the sickle.
I\'ve never seen a sickle for sale anywhere in my life.

You\'ve got to get more creative.  Like lawnmower blades!

"When they\'re thinking high-tech, go low-tech."
Or something along those lines, when he had the sawed-off

Under HG 2nd Edition, 270 MCr won\'t even buy you the *hull* at discount rates. 
 A 5KT hull is 500MCr, your best configuration is 60% of that.  Where are you 
guys coming up with your figures????????????????  And why don\'t they match up 
with figures from earlier editions?

A 1Kt hull is 100 MCr by itself under HG 2nd Edition.  The *cheapest* configuration would be 60MCr.  So where does this 2.88 MCr figure come in?????????????????

And a \'type 8 hull\' is an *asteroid* under HG.

With the kinds of numbers you\'re throwing around, I oughta be able to build a Tigress for under a billion.  What gives?????????

Only if they have internal jump fuel tankage.  If they\'re dependent on the

What set of rules are you using?  I have *NEVER* seen figures like you quote 
for ships *ANYWHERE*.  You just make them up, or are you using a new, improved

So why would every C, D, & E starport have one of these damned things?

Considering that under HG 2nd Ed, fuel tankage in a ship\'s hull is the same cost as cargo space, i.e., *free*, how can you then claim that a ship *and* a station cost the same as just the ship?  Your numbers don\'t jive.

I\'ve recently started developing a sophont species that comes from just
such a planet. I\'ll have to see if I can track down a copy of Piper\'s book
somewhere.

My concept was that this species evolved on a world that was approaching
tidal-lock, but hadn\'t got there yet. Four rotations per orbit seems about
right for my purposes.

I want to give it an F-type sun, so that the day side of the world is too
hot for unprotected animals to survive for long, while the night side is
generally too cold. Thus, many of the life forms, including my sophonts,
have to travel *all the time* to stay near the terminator (there\'s no land
or ice near the poles to live on). In short, they\'re perpetual nomads. Of
course they\'ve co-evolved with some domesticated herd species that they use
as riding mounts -- these mounts would be *very* large, with entire
households living on their backs. Perhaps these animals might also need to
be good endurance swimmers -- there should be points in their perpetual
round-the-world migration where they have to cross ocean straits between
continents.

I might also give the sophonts and animals the ability to
hibernate/estivate, perhaps in underground burrows, when they have no
choice but to remain in one place through the long "day" or "night".

Is this anything like Piper\'s conception?

(Original ideas are so hard to come by, these days...)

That\'s the logic behind the US Army\'s M9 Bayonet which with the sheath is
an insulated wire cutter and is thick enough that it can be used to pry
open the metal bands on mortar and artillery cases.  The indentations on
the blade back are for use as a saw in cutting open aircraft skins in an
emergency while not quite deep enough to count as a saw blade which could
get you in real trouble under the Geneva Convention unless you\'re an
engineer.  The problem is the most of the support troops still only have
the M7 which doesn\'t last long when you try to open cases with it.  I guess
they will still have to buy K-bars and Gerbers on their own

(GLOW = Gross Lift-Off Weight)

The optimal weight fraction of gellant (methane, ethane) is 10% of the
total propellant mass.

Metallic hydrogen is another alternative, but *mass* production would
require similar feats to the manufacture of superdense materials, IMHO.

I agree with you wholeheartedly Bruce about using mass rather than
volume to compute jump fuel requirements. Now I have to sit down and run
some numbers....

In California a Proposition changed the law so that any person breaking
into a home is considered to be  automatically attempting "grievous bodily
harm" and can be responded to with deadly force.  A few years ago a man
shot someone climbing into his daughters window and while he spent the
night in jail he was released and no charges where filed.  However outside
the home or closed business you must still prove that a "reasonable man"
would have felt that his or anothers life was in danger.  A number of
people that have shot at car thieves and prowlers have ended up in big
trouble.

Actually, it\'s pretty easy to check that sort of thing with a good forensic
exam. Ie. killing wound vs one inflicted later, angle of shot, powder
burns, and so forth.  At higher tech this will be a _lot_ harder to fake.
I had great fun playing a TL15 forensic specialist once, and even with good
old TL8 tech I was doing a nice job of seeing through the baddies\' plots.

I\'d look them up if necessary, or go by generic names. "He\'s carrying a
surplus Coalition autoshotgun."

My players tend to stop after they hear "it looks like an automatic
weapon", so I\'ve never _needed_ to know the weapons of the world by heart.

When I was running a Twilight 2000 game for my kids, I handled the combat
by statistics, and let them worry about weapons. I just copied out the
weapon cards from the supplement and went by what was on the card.

In Ohio, shooting an armed intruder is a violation of their Constitutional rights.  Go figger.

That\'s true, but what\'s the motivation of the forensic specialist and
police detective and prosecuting attorney in the homeowner case?  It
may  be to congratulate the homeowner and not investigate too deeply.  A
PC breaking into an NPC\'s home should not expect much legal protection,
as a practical matter.

Um... Glenn?  Glock makes the Glock 18, a select-fire 9mm machine pistol,
and Ruger makes the AC-556, which is a select-fire version of the Mini-14.
Luger is responsible for numerous WW II vintage SMGs, although the famous
Luger P-08 (the handgun that everyone automatically thinks of when they
hear the name "Luger") was available in select-fire only in very limited
quantities.

No, they\'re all in the public defender\'s office.  The Atty General\'s office is

Sethkimmel asked:
>Is/was there an anti GDW bias in Australia?

Not that I have noticed. It\'s just that:

a.   Roleplaying is a niche market at the best of times.
b.   Systems such as Traveller lose out to either "The" system (AD&D) or
one of the newer systems such as White Wolf\'s stuff - this was at the time
when Trav was considered an "old" system but not yet old enough to be a
"Classic". ;-).
c.   A lot of people go for spooky/weird backgrounds, and Traveller is too
tame for them.
d.   Many people prefer freeforms, and underpin them with atmospheric
systems (eg. Cthulu) or systemless structures (although I _have_
participated in a Trav freeform!)

Of course, it didn\'t help at all that MT suffered from an "errata storm".
Trav is also seen as being unstable - "what, ANOTHER new edition? A new
combat system? I have to learn TWO new incompatable design sequences? Don\'t
tell me, this one also doesn\'t mesh with any of the previously published
stuff, right?"

The reason AD&D Second Edition was received so well is that it was mostly
just about fixing up people\'s perceived problems with 1st Edit. They
listened hard to their customers (Rule of Business #2) and essentially gave
them what they wanted. And they gave them different backgrounds with the
same rule set (yeah, I know this is what TNE was about, but for most people
it was a *new* rule set).

In fact, I\'m of the opinion that MT (with the errata applied) is actually
the best system, as it is compatable with much of CT, and is integrated at
all combat scales.

OTOH, if you only got aboard with TNE, then maybe you should stay with it.
It is also reasonably integrated, it\'s just that the combat scales - weapon
Pen and damage, for instance - have been widened hugely.

I mean, all that CT needed was a task system, a ship combat system where
the PC\'s had an input (unlike HG, which is a fantastic but emotionally
detached system), and  - for my money - a better personal combat system.
You *nearly* get all of this with MT.

<< I\'ve recently started developing a sophont species that comes from just

 My concept was that this species evolved on a world that was approaching
 tidal-lock, but hadn\'t got there yet. Four rotations per orbit seems about
 right for my purposes.
 
 I want to give it an F-type sun, so that the day side of the world is too
 hot for unprotected animals to survive for long, while the night side is
 generally too cold. Thus, many of the life forms, including my sophonts,
 have to travel *all the time* to stay near the terminator (there\'s no land
 or ice near the poles to live on). In short, they\'re perpetual nomads. Of
 course they\'ve co-evolved with some domesticated herd species that they use
 as riding mounts -- these mounts would be *very* large, with entire
 households living on their backs. Perhaps these animals might also need to
 be good endurance swimmers -- there should be points in their perpetual
 round-the-world migration where they have to cross ocean straits between
 continents.
 
 I might also give the sophonts and animals the ability to
 hibernate/estivate, perhaps in underground burrows, when they have no
 choice but to remain in one place through the long "day" or "night".
 
 Is this anything like Piper\'s conception? >>

IMHO:

T4 has a good task system (if you\'re willing to deal with half-dice [I
am]), an adequate personal combat system (this ties in with having a
good task system), and a piss-poor starship combat system (this may have
been rectified in the future, had Imperium Games not gone belly-up,
but...).  Bruce Alan Macintosh\'s Military Combat System fills in the gap
for starship combat, if one is willing to give credit for systems not
published by the game publishers.  FF&Sv2 is an excellent design system
for the gearheads among us.  I would ignore most of the background and
adventure material published by Imperium Games for T4 (however, I hear
that the BITS material for T4 is first-rate).  Imperium Games tended to
commission works by writers who paid little or no attention to
pre-existing canon.  :-P

To sum up:

Good game system for personal-level interactions; needs a grafted-on
ship combat system; excellent equipment design system; lousy background
support (with a couple of exceptions [such as _Pocket Empires_ and
_Imperial Squadrons_]).

  You see, when I referred to "fuel rocks" as 1kt type 8 hulls I meant just
that.
If economic practicality is the issue I felt that building as cheap a station as
possible would be a good starting point. Asteroids seem OK, but I can see real
hassles with building from brick, wood, or straw.

Okay, well it seems like I made a good call, I have found a good (I think) 
RPG space combat system and a good non RPG space combat system (for 
Traveller) so that should not be a problem, as the campain that I\'m planing 
on running (assuming that I can find the players would be on of three things: 
The Out (as posted a wile ago), Araque\'s Sands (a TL-9 slow boat colony ships

Quest type setting), so background material should not be a problem.

  Umm, let\'s assume that a security/lookout vessel from a completely separate
agency operating completely independently of any commercial facilities that
may or may not be in a given system just might not be designed to require the
services of said station?

  HG2, p. 22, paragraph immediately before "Drives". See also p. 23, table
"Configuration". I\'m just using HG2 the way it was meant to be - ruthlessly :)
Seriously, though, this sort of thing doesn\'t work worth a darn for warships
or Jump-capable craft (let alone both) - it simply runs too far into your
available volume to allow needed performance levels.

  You mean "why wouldn\'t"? If so, then the answer is that a full thinking
through of the concepts involved under CT rules (and remember, CT does rule*)
will mean that there likely are such stations, whether open to walk-in business
or not, at those systems that will support them.

>Considering that under HG 2nd Ed, fuel tankage in a ship\'s hull is the same
cost as cargo space, i.e., *free*, how can you then claim that a ship *and*
a station cost the same as just the ship?  Your numbers don\'t jive.

  "My" numbers come from HG2; it is, however, important to politely ask the
rules to provide the answer that you\'re looking for :) And actually in the
case described the combination can easily cost substantially _less_.

One would presume that these stations would exist to provide *refined* fuel.  
Class C or worse starports don\'t have refined fuel by their very definition.

Heh.  You still have to pay for digging out the station.  And since there\'s no difference in price between cargo space and fuel tankage, the ship still costs the same.  So you *still* spend more on the entire system than you would on just the ship and you get out from under the drawbacks.

Yeah, possibly.  I\'m probably more focused on direct competition w/ the 
megacorps (though he specificially mentioned indirect).  It\'s just the only 
things left to Free Traders are either things the megacorps don\'t want or 
don\'t consider worth the trouble to secure (the "crumbs").  I can understand 
and appreciate the comments that Far Trader is meant for developing shipping 
companies, too.  I just don\'t expect the megacorps would be kind once any 
kind of company became anything like a threat (either through acquisition, 
hostile takeover, etc, much less trade war).

Well from my understanding, they would basically be independant, though it\'s 
possible favorable terms would be granted.  There\'s certainly 
decentrailization and a deliberate method to have even subsidiaries and 
subdivisions behave as if seperate, for the bottom line, if nothing else.  
Plus, it\'s interesting how all the megacorps are so intertwined.  Anyone 
wanna hazard a guess on the percentage of Imperial business that was through 
the megacorps?  It smacks of oligarchy, especially when you see the imperial 
nobility and Emperor\'s mits everywhere, too (especially w/ Zirunkarish).

IMO that\'s very debatable (not that I think "jump stations" are anything but 
a strawman, really).   They would be very vulnerable.  The one thing we 
*know* is that fixed installations are undefendable and if anything like a 
small percentage of the trade we see in Far Trader runs through such a fixed 
installation, it would have a gigantic bullseye on it during the Frontier 
Wars, which means there will be defenses, which means crew, which means 
power, quarters, etc etc and the thing gets even bigger and more expensive 
(and vulnerable).  A vicious circle, really.

Wow.  That\'s a good idea.  *I\'d* buy bunches of them.  I wonder if that\'s

Transfer how?  That\'s one of the hardest part bout handdrawn, as opposed to 
computerized mapping tools.  Drawing by hand, it\'s sometimes hard to do 
things *exactly* the same.  Maybe have a software type tool attached (Jim Vs 
Galactic would be an awesome starting point), then the "zoom" forms for the 
IISS and RCES mapping forms, etc. 

I really like your idea, though!

TNE\'s Brilliant Lances and Battle Rider boht included descriptions of the 
solar system and movements for use in representing them in a game.  It was a 
small table with the planets of the solar system, diameter, 1G threshold, and 
velocity in 30,000km hexes.  Earth is 0.43, 1G at the surface, velocity at 
1.787 hexes per 30 minute turn.  Jupiter is 4.76 hexes across (I actually 
made one out of cardboard cut to the BL/BR hexmap along w/ a printout from an 
image file I used to have handy), with a 1.4 hex 1G threshold and moves at 
0.78 hexes per turn.  The sun, for example, would be 46.5 hexes across, has a 
1G threshold out to 99.5 hexes, 2G to 63.5, 3G to 47.6, etc etc.  Was very 
interesting to put into perspective.  I\'ve always heard the figures, but it 
doesn\'t computer till you see something taking up 5 hexes across on the map 
(and the BL/BR hex maps have big hexes).

You forgot "reasonable vehicle design system", but "the three levels of
combat do not mesh well".

You can use Kenneth Bearden\'s KBv2 to get rid of the half dice, if you
like. This and TNE are probably two of the best task systems for Trav - at
least you get to use your entire stat. In MY, a stat of 14 gave you the
same bonus as a stat of 10  - why bother? But using KBv2, you use all of
it.

So: tack on a few things, and the system becomes much more playable! - but
I\'ve never found a workable solution for the differing combat scales.

That is precisely the point, because that\'s what it\'s going to come down to 
eventually.  The Rampart is awesome support for people on the ground, or for 
blowing up things from orbit.  But acting like an AV-8b Harrier is not what 
it\'s designed for.  The Rampart can\'t hold any ground *at all*.  People don\'t 
surrender to space fighters in orbit (or even jet fighters in teh 
atmosphere), but to people on the ground w/ them, w/ a weapon system in their 
direction.

Because nothing is ever a sure bet.  There *could* be some determined 
resistance in orbit, that puts ortillery\'s weapons somewhere else.  In an 
ideal situation, you don\'t need grav vehicles at all.  *UNTIL* you want to do 
more than blow things up and actually claim the turf you\'ve been bombing for. 
 Against even a low tech guerilla action, your troops will survive if they 
have good armored vehicles (to say nothing of tactics and training, which are 
more important, though there will be causalties in any case).  Hmm... sounds 
like i\'m talking bout hte situation in the Balkans, no?  ;-)

Against the other polities (Zhos, Solomani, etc) you\'re going to absolutely 
*NEED* heavily armored grav vehicles and battledress, etc etc.  Combined Arms 
is going to get even more complicated with easy space travel (and it\'s pretty 
durned fun IMO, though complicated, to be a Forward Air Controller (F/A-18s, 
Cobras, Harriers) or Forward Observer for Arty/mortars (155mm/81mm), as I 
just got to practice some of that (w/ all them systems, too).  :-)

Which sucks IMO.  A much better solution is TNE\'s Battle Rider, which allows 
the quick running of ships in "Task Forces."  Pretty fun, too.  Never tried 
100s vs 100s (at least yet).  At least not in BBs.  ;-)  

The best thing is that BR is skill based, instead of statistically based, 
like HG.  YMMV.

At least give us a design of one of your fueling stations.  Keepign in mind 
the numbers of dtons shipping they\'ll have to service (good #s in Far 
Trader).  And make them defensible (which we know is impossible for fixed 
installations).  Please add drives to these so they\'re not fixed.  Then gimme 
a picture how system traffic control works and the protocols for jumping in 
and trading w/ these things.

Which is clearly not the intent of the drop tank provisions to every "real" 
version of Traveller ship design.  It\'s only by going completely against the 
obvious grain of the only canon design (despite it\'s miserable rep, which is 
neither here nor there) that\'s such absurdity even merits a response.

Which of course ignores the fact that drop tanks could be avoided like the 
plague for reasons that have nothing to do with their efficiency like say a 
disaster or 3, convoluted megacorp board politics, the stock market drop that 
acompanied the news of Tukera and General doing the things to begin w/.  Etc 
etc.

Using *just* drop tanks is not what they\'re "designed for."  That is clearly 
against the intent of the ship design rules (to allow no or minimal internal 
tankage).

Strawman Alert!  For the sake of discussion, even if you get a drop tank 
equiped Jump 4 ship (capable of double jump), you still have to do (at least) 
double the time.  That is beyond Book 2 (though not having it, i can\'t 
confirm it allows jumps of greater than 6 anyways, though I\'m pretty sure of 
it anyways).  FTR, GT does not treat jump drives like B2.

Hmm... seems like GT\'s version of jump fuel fits FF&S (the original) 
perfectly.  I see a "coolant" usage, venting to *create* the "bubble", and 
some converted to energy ala the normal definition of "fuel."  How do drop 
tanks conflict w/ that?  Especially when you use the explanation I gave a 
Looooong (at least seems that way <g>) time ago in this very thread.

Then WHY haven\'t you at least *TRIED* to help make them such instead of

  They\'re not; I agree that they\'re screwed. I\'ve written an essay on this
point, but perhaps Mr. Summers would like to continue this debate with you.

...

  However, this sort of station is exactly what they do very cheaply. I
assume that by "ignore" you don\'t mean "ban from HG2/OTU"? Oh, and the
armour rating three is included in the hull cost :)

...

  None at the best starport. Other facilities not available to common traffic
may have refined L-Hyd available, as may other ships currently in the system.

So you *still* spend more on the entire system than you would on just the
ship and you get out from under the drawbacks.

  i) I already paid for that. I don\'t suppose you checked the rules?
 ii) The station portion of the system is still vastly cheaper; review the
relevant post if necessary.
iii) No. See ii), above for suggestions.

I don\'t know about the US, but in Oz, you don\'t get many Ford parts that fit
into a Holden (a GM), the reason?  Because Ford and GMH want you to buy
their parts from them (although all over the world there are generic brands
from China, Korea, etc., I assume?).  Furthermore, even within each stable,
there are few parts that are the same in the small, medium, and large cars!
Interchangeable things are filter-, plug-, and lead-type parts.

For a safety standard, I would go for a large amount of interchangeable
parts between in-house models of starships (Ferd Inc.\'s FreeTrader,
FarTrader, and Farliner), but I assume that they want you to buy them from
their manufacturers, not their competition (Snerd Co.\'s FreeTrader slide
flange does simply not fit the Ferd model!).  This is just MHO, but I have
read how competitive these companies can be, why give the comp an edge
anywhere?  Licenses not withstanding.

I based the above rebuttal on a ship *having* internal tankage sufficient for 
a second jump.

I haven\'t seen J7+ ships mentioned *anywhere* that can jump that far in a

I\'m a \'gridder\' myself.  The rules say 10% per jump number, I *use* 10% per 
jump number.  Simple as that.  I don\'t believe in using \'part\' of the fuel to 
\'create the bubble\', you use it *all* to create the energy to create the 
bubble.  No wastage.  I\'ve seen what happens when people say \'Well, if we have 
this rilly rilly high tech *HIGHLY* efficient drive, it wouldn\'t *POSSIBLY* 
use *ALL* that fuel just to make a bubble, there\'s *GOT* to be increased 
efficienies at higher tech levels\', this just degenerates to people trying to 
bypass the 10% per jump number fuel requirement.

FWIW, once upon a time, about 18 years ago, my character was one of 4 who had 
a TL25 antimatter powered scout ship of about 200 tons.  We had to buy *LOTS* 
of LHyd to feed it, since it used *some* of the LHyd to convert the rest to 
antimatter.  IIRC, we could do 2xJ6\'s in it *IF* we fed it something like 135% 
of the ship\'s volume in *refined* LHyd to fully charge the antimatter 
reservoir.  Our characters got some *strange* looks when they\'d tell the ramp 
rats to \'fill it up, and don\'t worry about it overflowing.  Should take about 
280 tons, just don\'t pump it in too fast...\'  Course those 2 J6\'s would take 2 
weeks plus the downtime needed to recalculate the 2nd jump.

I\'m having problems believing that a system that only has unrefined fuel would 
have fueling stations handy.  <shrug>

Yes, I agree with this (except I made-up my own names for Traveller weapons.
It\'s fine saying it looks like a Luger or Walther or Colt, etc. if you want
sci-fi weapons to look like that, but in my old campaign, most weapons
looked like the ones depicted in JTAS\'s and on Alien Module covers.  Check
out the pistol on one of those covers, looks noting like any 20th century
pistol that I know of...

I don\'t design ships using asteroids for the simple reason that you lose 20% 
of the volume or the ship breaks up from being too weak.  That means, with a 
5KT rock, you *only* get 4KT of useable space.  IMNSFBHO, not worth it.

And as far as armour goes, it takes what, Factor 4 weaponry to get by it?  
That\'s 2 triple missile turrets at TL13, 2 triple beam lasers at TL*7*, 2 dual 
plasma turrets at TL12, *ANY* fusion gun turret, 6 PA barbettes, 4 PA turrets 
at TL15, *ANY* spinal weapon, or *ANY* bay weapon.  IOW, just about *any* 
military or paramilitary ship can hit it.

You\'re telling me the ship *and* the station is cheaper than just the ship by

But you\'re not counting the whole *system*, you\'re just counting the ships it

As far as I can tell, there _aren\'t_ any specific examples of either Aslan
or K\'kree script except what _might_ be script on armour, clothing, and
accoutrements in some of the Keith drawings, and what is certainly writing
on the hulls of the ships in the illustrations in "Aslan Mercenary Ships"
also by the Keiths.

The script there is very similar to Arabic or Indonesian.
If you like I can send you scan\'s of those ships.

This is based on a quick search through JTAS and the Alien modules, of which
I think I have all the relevant ones.

There is, however a lot of Aslan and K\'kree language, including word
generation tables in the Alien modules.

Noone else seems to have made a better job of TL13-TL15.

Apart from the Darrians.

The Darrians must have cheated. Perhaps they used their TL16 knowledge
to make the jump from TL13 to TL15 in less time. ;-)

The same way as it will if it doesn\'t have fuel scoops - put everyone
into low berth and await supplies of lemon-soaked napkins. :-)

I seem to recall a situation with 100D refuelling stations when it
was calaculated that the cost of a trip to the gas giant was too
much because of the time taken compared with allowing the merchants
to save money by not using fuel scoops, purification plants,
streamlining, 10G structural bracing and CG drives.

The economic arguments seemed to be in favour of 100D stations with
non-starships for trips to the gas giants or the planet. With a large
enough trade volume, you can have several around the Star\'s 100D limit
and effectively ignore the jump masking problem.

Where there were E type starports on a key run, the calculations
seemed to point to the megacorps adding such an infrastructure, just
to avoid building a new ship design just for the route.

(With drop tanks, they could just jump over the system.)

So drop tanks should be just plugging into an existing orbital
refuelling infrastructure.

I\'m not convinced by the broom - too big for use indoors, especially
the ones with the extra wide heads.

Besides, having carpets, we\'ve got a vacuum cleaner at home, which is
far too unwieldy.

You are either missing or ignoring my point.

Please read carefully.  All of the below statements are in the context of a
Traveller Universe where lasers from orbit are perfectly effective against
vehicle size targets.

There is no reason to purchase an Astrin or Trepida to hold ground when you
can hold ground with a lightweight lightly armed g-carrier (and its troop
complement).

The Trepida and Astrin are the Cadillac of armored vehicles in the TL15
Traveller Universe.  They are quite expensive, as are all heavily armored,
powerfully armed grav vehicles.  If the ground troops can rely on "air"
cover that can instantly render any opposing vehicle class weapon carrier
into its component atoms then heavily armed and armored vehicles are
obsolete.  I am not saying that The Imperial Marines can hold ground from
orbit, only that they do not need the same equipment to hold ground in a
scenario where orbital fire is so perfectly effective as has been suggested.

This is simplistic.  There will always be unusual situation in the above
scenario where armored vehicles are at least useful.  But the procurement
of military hardware will not cater to the unusual situation, but the usual
one.

Note also that I do not believe that, in the canon nor in my own Traveller
Universe, lasers from orbit *should* be that effective.  From a game play
standpoint I\'d rather they were a bit less accurate when firing from orbit
at ground targets.

The problem is, you are comparing the scenario I\'ve been talking about
(perfect orbital fire support) with reality (imperfect air support).  The
fact is, I agree more with your viewpoint *when the assumption of perfect
orbital fire is not being used*.  Unfortunately, that is what this
discussion was turned towards and all my previous statements were made in
that context.

And in that context, if you do not hold orbit, you do not hold ground.
It\'s like the trump card of all time.  There is no way, with densiometer
technology to make hiding places useless, IR sensors which make nighttime
irrelevent, and weapons which can strike from orbital distances with
pinpoint accuracy with no possibility of return fire, that an opposing
force can conduct any vehicular activity with any hope of the vehicles
returning to their bases.

Its a very simple situation, which is to say one that wont happen in
reality.  then again, it is just a game, right?

Well, you can, but probably not in the Third Imperium.  They actively
dislike AI, especially when it\'s armed.

This is essentially the Zhodani solution; lots of warbots mixed in with the
human troops. They can fight on their own at the tactical level, but need
operational direction from the unit commanders.  You still need people,
mainly for their creativity and problem-solving abilities.  

A thought: shouldn\'t the Zhos have larger robotic combat vehicles like
tanks?

Are you serious about that last one?  My grandfather was an FO in WWII, and
often described that as the worst job in the army....  I\'ve heard that

That\'s actually a very good point and is something I\'d like to see more
attention devoted too (maybe in GT Starships?  Are you listening Chris?:) )
 I\'d really like to see more variants on the same ship idea in the OTU.
They tried that in T4 EV, and gave 6 or so models of each vehicle, but
unfortunately that book had other problems.  

Ideally, I\'d like to see Trav sourcebooks borrow something from Shadowrun,
where every piece of equipment, especially starships, is made by a specific
company, with it\'s own histories, quirks, followers, etc.  I realize space
is limited, but it would be really nice....

It doesn\'t, but it\'s not supposed to. I think that\'s the point. Not every
vessel in the entire universe is going to rely on drop tanks, just the ones
where it makes a lot of economic sense to do so.

Perhaps I am not completely in tune with this thread since I\'ve skimmed
most of it, but it seems to me that a fuel station\'s military vulnerability
wouldn\'t be a big factor when considering whether they exist or not for
merchantile and/or civilian purposes.

Gasoline stations are big, sitting targets which explode quite nicely, yet
they are quite numerous in the real world.

In a war, the infrastructure\'s going to get trashed no matter what scheme
you use.

Some good stuff is happening today with the Galileo
mission and I\'d thought I\'d post an excerpt from
the mission report. It has lots of juicy details
which can be used to make gas giant skimming much
more entertaining for both players and GMs (if
you\'re into details, that is). It also describes how
instruments are used for planetary surveys (great
background for Scout/scientific adventures).

- -- quote --

Once again, most of Galileo\'s attention is directed
toward Jupiter as the spacecraft\'s Solid State Imaging
camera and Utraviolet Spectrometer spend most of the
day observing the giant planet.  The activity is only
briefly interrupted toward the end of the day to allow
the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer to perform a remote
observation of the Io torus.  On the flyby front, the
spacecraft flies past Ganymede today at 3:18 am PDT...
at a distance of 636,000 kilometers (396,000 miles).

Throughout the day, the spacecraft\'s camera takes images
of a variety of cloud features in Jupiter\'s atmosphere.
These observations are designed to determine the dynamics
of cloud motion in three dimensions, with high spatial
and time resolution.  Each feature is observed three to
six times as it moves across Jupiter\'s sunlit hemisphere.
Some of the features are also imaged after they have
rotated into the night side of Jupiter, to look for
lightning flashes which the scientists hope to correlate
with clouds seen in the daylight images taken earlier
in the same areas.  The features covered by this
observation campaign are equatorial waves, high speed
jets, clouds in the north and south equatorial belts,
and white ovals.  In addition, the camera also makes
an observation of Jupiter\'s aurora to measure its
vertical structure at high resolution.  The Ultraviolet
Spectrometer takes advantage of these observation
opportunities to also make measurements of these features.

In addition to the observations taken along with the
spacecraft camera, the Ultraviolet Spectrometer also
performs its own measurements of Jupiter.  In one type of
observation, the spectrometer measures hydrogen in
Jupiter\'s dark atmosphere.  Without sunlight, changes in
hydrogen loss are caused by interaction with particles in
Jupiter\'s magnetosphere and mixing of the upper atmosphere
with lower cloud levels.  In a second type of observation,
taken on Jupiter\'s lit side, the spectrometer measures
hydrocarbons in Jupiter\'s upper atmosphere. Finally, the
spectrometer takes a look at aurora in Jupiter\'s atmosphere.
These observations will allow scientists to further study
the dynamics of Jupiter\'s upper atmosphere, and its
interaction with Jupiter\'s magnetosphere.

I wonder how well a 40+ year old merchant will deal with
terrajoule lightning bolts and 200+ mph/kph winds and
high-speed jetstreams. Seems to me there could be gas
giants which simply can\'t be skimmed due to local
radiation/weather effects. Would such a situation require
a slow approach vector and some intense study of weather
conditions or just force the merchie to pay for fuel at
the starport?

It is? I can see sentiments that Kipling would understand. But it
doesn\'t "feel" like Kipling. 

But there\'s a *lot* of Kipling that\'s worth looking at. One lovely to
steal some ideas from is something I first Encountered in Smith\'s "Gray
Lensman"... "The Ballad of Boh Da Thone". It\'s an interesting tale. And
I\'m sure some of you could swipe either a scenario idea or an NPC from
it.

Still, isn\'t metallic hydrogen only about .1 g/cc? That\'s an *awful*
lot of trouble for something that\'s only 30% denser. 

While it\'d be useless for *fuel*, I recall there being some speculation
that *solid* metallic hydrogen might be metastable. That is, like
diamond, once formed it could exist at lower pressures as long as the
temperature didn\'t get too high. 

It\'d be interesting for some purposes. For example, a nuke with a
metallic tritium casing to boost the yeild. Heck, for all I know, an
implosion could push metallic hydrogen to the point of starting a
fusion reaction.

Hardly. The advantage of drop tanks depends on you being able to "use"
the fuel *before* jump, for the most part. Even if what you are doing
is feeding your *internal* Jump tankage to the J-drive, and refilling
the internal tankage from the drop tanks. 

The secondary (and minor) usage where you take the tanks *through* a
jump to refuel afterwards, depend on your ship being able to haul them
along anyway. So while the cutoff point for practicality will be
different, there will still be designs that can do it.

I\'m not sure. But I *am* sure that mammalian versus reptilian brain
patterns will be *easy* to diferentiate. The structure of a reptile
brain is *very* different from that of mammals. Not only do they lack
the frontal lobes (so do most mammals), they lack the entire cerebrum
IIRC (or is it cerebellum?) 

Itelligent reptiles would have to evolve something to fill in the
"gap", but odds are against it being much like the cererum. And thus,
they\'ll have *very* different readings.

Well, I\'d tend to "trace" things, and then fasten the tracing paper to
the globe. There are cheap gizmos (pantographs) that let you traces
something at one size, and have it reproduced larger or smaller.

I think the Traveller book has some of that. I hadn\'t thought about how
fast things would be moving, but since that depends on *mass* as well
as distance, I think I\'d skip that in the table. After all, the idea is
to get across the relative sizes. Though I\'d probably throw in some
comments about how fast various speeds would be.

Heck, consider what zero-g cutting tools *have* to be like... They\'ll

Not really. There seems to be very little in the way of land animals.
There is some *very* hardy vegetation. Most life is in the oceans,
where the water buffers the temperature changes.

As I recall, the nighttime lows tend to get near the point where CO2
will freeze out of the atmosphere. Daytime highs are around the boiling
point of water. Only the large oceans prevent the swings from being
worse. 

There\'s a nice sequence where a ship crashes shortly after sundown.
They have to build some sort of shelter to keep from freezing *and*
find a way to heat it. Some of the local trees provide the heat. Their
branches help reinforce the wet snow walls until they freeze solid. And
the *very* hardwood "cores" of the trees burn nice and hot. Of course,
it took an arc welder to get them lit! :-)

The only city on the planet was built in a valley between a couple of
peaks, and they then blasted the peaks and bulldozed them over to
provide extra insulation. The spaceport is on top of the plateau thus
formed. Ships generall only land in the early morning and late
afternoon. The temps are reasonable, and the storms have either died
down or not yet started.

Yes, you get *nasty* storms around sunset and daybreak.

Nope. Just stating a fact. My version requires either the presense of
one of those $%^#$ transponders *or* physical contact. And if there is
a transponder it infects that and then spreads via physical contact.

Think of it as a form on nanotech. It\'ll take over more primitive
circuitry by "tapping" all the I/O lines of a component or circuit
until it can figure out what the component is designed to do (possibly
even feeding in test signals of it\'s own once it has a rough idea).

Once it knows what a component is for, it builds a replacement, and
uses the rest for raw material. Whenever it has a "block" of circuits
converted (ie it has a bunch on components or circuits where it has all
the I/O lines handled), it\'ll stop and build a simplified circuit for
just what they were supposed to do (given the way most electronics is
built out of stock "blocks" this will free up a *lot* of silicon, etc).

Once it has a "device" converted this way, it may just have a small
subroutine handling what the device is "supposed" to do, while it
continues to expand down all the connections. 

Eventually, it\'ll get to the point where it can start dropping
"unnecessary" functions, and start dealing with the crew. Once the crew
is either killed or convinced to co-operate (depending on virus
strain), it can go even farther as it no longer needs to fake the I/O
that kept them happy.

10 minutes is a *long* ways out.

But as a reference point, one of the reasons for the laying of new
under ocean cables, even in this era of commsats is that data links
don\'t *like* being routed via satellite. One geosynch hop is 23,000
miles *times 4* for lag purposes. Up to the satellite, down to the
ground, the response travels up to the satellite, and then back down to
the ground agian before you get to see it. For a total lag of
23k*4/186k or about one-half second. 

That\'s enough to cause trouble with data transfer protocols. Forget
trying any sort of virtual presence. 

Telepresence at even Lunar distances is *possible*, but only for simple
operations where no quick decisions are needed.

Most of the on world transport is done by submarine, as well as the major
source of \'hard\' money - exporting the fat of a marine animal that has the
curious ability of stopping radiation much cheaper than manufactured
shielding.  The core story of the book is that of a labor dispute - the
export of the fat was controlled by the local \'union\', and the hunters had
found a better deal.  The shipwreck occurred on a sub that was owned by a
prominent hunter, and the goons put a bomb on it.

    'body' => 'First, I personally assume drop tank usage as part of megacorp operations.
That is part of how they are more profitable the free traders.  I also
assume they local megacorp offices prebook cargo, pasengers, ferry and feul
services for their big ship to cut turn arround time to a minimum.  I also
assume that there are depos that long jump ships jump to and short haul
ships that break out the cargo from these depos.  

For example:  In this post the example was to high trade worlds 5 hexes
apart.  IMTU there would be a ship or a pair of ships that made this run.
When they broke out in system at their prearranged location there would be a
tank tug to load full new drop tanks while cargo tow ships would play
musical containers and the ferry would dock to transfer passengers.  If the
line was efficent the ferry would transfer passengers to a small
acoomadations base to wait for the next ship in the link to take passengers
further along their route if their final destination was futher along or to
a shuttle to take them to the planet if it were the passengers destination.
In effect a company \'airport\' at the 100 dia limit.  Crew could rotate as well.

At two ships per run the temp ship would have to \'stand in\' for 4 weeks per
run plus loose two weeks for it\'s own maintainence and one week to jump to
\'get back into rotation\'.  That leaves a week of other down time.

This \'system\' is modeled after the freight trucking system with long and
short haul drivers and trucks.  The model works.

If you assume a maximun jump of jump 5 for best efficency (only two ship
designs).  You station jump 8 \'short haulers\' at each jump 5 depo and you
can reach any point along the route.  You need 24 jump 5 and 122 jump 2
ships to give twice weekly service year round to 55 hexes of trade route.
Also for effecency\'s sake the jump 5 ships would need to be 5 times larger
in cargo capacity that the jump 2.  If you were willing to have three ship
types half the jump 2 ships could be jump 1s but the only saving would be in
the cost of the jump drive itself and you would loose the ability to have
ships fill in for each other to cover excess demand.  Having 20% extra above
the minimums of ships above would also be a good idea to cover \'higher the
expeected\' demand and to allow for cycles and exploitation of
\'oppertunities\'.  Nine depo managers would have access to data no older than
4 days old for 11 systems on a main and no more than one week old for 31
systems.

Such a regular route and schedule could make good use of annual cycles to
boost both regular freight and speculative trade profits.  If the ships were
designed to take interchangable cargo/passenger modules then simple stocking
a few extra passenger/special cargo modules at every other depo would let
managers handle cyclical base trade/passenger surges.  Like moving the
\'perishables\' cargo modules as \'dead head\' or carring less picky cargo, in
the off season to were they will be needed when the \'gorsh berry\'s\' once
every 19 standard months season come due.

Most loan contracts do not allow the bank to require additional colateral
during the term of a lone.  Collateral value is calculated at the time of
\'closing\'.  That is the \'closing\' of the regociations of the loan contract.

It would take a very foolish person to take out a loan on a long term
investment like a ship that allowed the loan holder to \'call the loan\' at
will.  Most collateral based loans can only be called early in the case of
defaught by the party the loan was made to.  It is posible to have other
conditions to \'call the loan\' though.

Now money raised by the sale of stock is a totally diferent thing.  The
Board of Dirrecters call the shots in this case (within the limits set in
the articals of incorporation and the laws under which it was incorporated.)

You could avoid this by designing the ship so that it\'s hold can also be
it\'s fuel tank.  You loose 10% of the volume of the fuel/holds to storing
the colapsable tank componets but if you go to all drop tanks you can leave
these in storage on planet.

Ouch, BAR-B-QUE-FOO!  Have you earned your a black aprone?

I collect antique cast iron cook ware.  I love to cook!  If trouble were to
occure in my kitchen I\'d have a selection of \'blunt objects\'  "Hummm, Should
I use my #6 or #8 iron...frying pan" Just to tie in the golf thread!  Grin!

Not really that much of a joke as I have collected the #3-#12 frying pans.
Nothing beats black iron skillets for makeing a pineapple upside down cake
or corn bread.

Accually I\'d go with the #8 in the left hand as a small shield and my 10"
chiefs knife in the right (I have two knife blocks including cleavers).  "On
Garde! Sufle, Crepe susete, and other foreign words!"  My SO would probably
go with the marble roling pin and her pepper spray.  Now that is a scrary
thought!

The subject of farpoint (100D) stations came up during the Far Trader
playtest. I did some detailed analysis and concluded that they offer no
significant advantage over a standard highport (at least in GT). 
The difficulty of farpoint stations is that it is rarely possible or
efficient to use the same port inbound and outbound (the exception is ships
that bounce back and forth between two systems only); in most cases, you
will need one station per destination within jump range (probably J-3 or
J-4 => upwards of 30 systems).

A freighter would generally have to download cargo at one station, maneuver
to another station, take on fuel and cargo, and then jump outbound. This
all takes time, and time is money. Moreover, once you add in all the extra
freight handling and lighterage fees, most of the economic advantage
disappears. A highport in orbit around the mainworld has the advantages of
central position and consolidated operations. About the only way to avoid
these difficulties is Lighter-Aboard-SHip (LASH) operations, and even these
are neck-and-neck with conventional shipping in most cases.

I\'d go for a direct neural interface plug as a more realistic option than

Neither is very Travelleresque though.

Always. I\'ll see whether I can fit something about this in with Maintenance

skills (for improvising adaptations) something to do. Apollo 13, anyone?

Matter of limited bandwidth -- do you want 3 variations on the 200-dton

That\'s the theory of having in-depth writeups -- with 3-4 pages per ship,
you have space to go into that much detail. I wouldn\'t mind seeing notes on
other manufacturers\' versions of the same ship type in the "Variants"
portion of the writeup. I\'ll make a note to that effect when I update the
site next.

  This brings up a point - a lot of CT ships _can\'t_ haul drop tanks, or
are in a very dubious rules position with respect to doing so.

  Firstly, a Jump-1 drive that wasn\'t over-built (i.e., a 300-Dt capacity
drive installed in a 200-Dt hull) _can\'t_ do a jump with any additional
tankage/stowage at all; this assumes that J#\'s truncate after calculations,
but if they don\'t then transporting small planetoids by tethering them to
Seekers starts to look feasible. Per TCS larger drives may not be retrofitted.

  Secondly, combos over 1000-Dt won\'t have the minimum bridge requirement
to operate (2% of Dt). If this doesn\'t apply then it\'s a further bonus for
the "all tankage is welded drop-tanks" absurdity. FWIW, the Jump Ship in S:9
does appear to have allocated bridge tonnage for its supposed 10kt full load.
Per HG2 this restriction will rarely apply to sub-1000 Dt ships but some sort
of solution needs to be considered. Some precedent allows this but a solution
needs to be considered.

  Do you mean oligarchy or oligopoly? It\'s entirely possible that the Emperor
(if not the Court) don\'t have anything like a good idea of what\'s going on,
but it\'s a bit of stretch to infer that the megacorps really _rule_ the 3I

 Actually, they hold up well (at least in training); my DIs said that any man who broke his rifle butt on a target got a 6-pack of soda (big deal in Basic); we tried mightily - no one collected (ever, apparantly).

  Oh. I ran the numbers (which you\'ve seen) and shown that this is the most
efficient way of building such a station. Would you care to go into greater
detail about the aesthetic virtue of pouring MCr down a hole in space? :)

>And as far as armour goes, it takes what, Factor 4 weaponry to get by it?  

  ?? It does not make the station immune to any weapon under HG2. However,
since you bring it up, such a station doesn\'t take non-spinal criticals,
only takes Internal Explosion from a Det-Laser on a roll of "2", and is
highly resistant to all other turret/bay non-meson weapons. I.E., this
non-hardened 1kt service station can probably pound the stuffing out of
any non-warship, let alone make a desirable target for piracy.

...

  Sure. It\'s not a battlestation (a ridiculous concept in any case). Is there
a point to this recurring theme of yours? It\'s a gas (urr, liquid) station.

  Dare I ask why you specify the use of HG2 rules and then refuse to accept

set this up as an OTU discussion, IIRC.

  Well, I am making the perhaps unreasonable assumption that such a service
station is a business designed to support more than a single ship. We could
even assume that such a small (1kt main hull) station at a world of moderate
importance off the main routes (200 meg @ TL A?) might deal with twenty small
(<1000 Dt) starships each week?

  You may also be missing the fact that an external tankage design is cheaper
per unit capability - thus the 400 Dt normal trader could be replaced by (ForEx)
a 300 Dt Munchkin-class external tankage trader.

  Have you considered posting your most efficient system designs that prove that
the system is inferior to standard internal tankage haulage?

Two points -

1) BITS 101 Books are usable with CT/MT/T4 and TNE. They\'ve been kept
generic deliberately. GT can be used too, but you need one of the task
system conversion systems. They\'re not T4 specific.
Admittedly, TNE is harder to use with 101 Lifeforms and 101 Travellers as
they have T4 compatible stats.


2) The BITS/CORE published T4 material is Milieu 0 (get M0 Campaign),
Pocket Empires, The Long Way Home and Gateway. The Annililik Run is nothing
like the original CORE proposal, having become AD&D in space. Half the
first Aliens Book (unpublished) was drafted, as was the Dag sourcebook.

CSC and EA are good sourcebooks for guns and equipment.

Leisure usually charge 50% IIRC (Bill Rutherford probably has better info
than me as he\'s used them to mail to the US). If ordering from BITS there
are two things you need to consider - (1) currency conversion charges and
(2) ordering in bulk. Bulk orders are much more appreciated.

Hmm 5 books (I know you have 2!) x $8 = 40 dollars so $56 dollars total
which is £36 GBP which is £7 / book. That\'s £2 GBP/book over UK prices!

Why not put the far point station out of the plane of the milkyway?  That
way none of them would be occluded from each other.  Say directly up from
the star at 100 stellar diameters.

Actually, they are available in the U.S., but only to LEOs and the

"With 2% of purchase price paid every year for maintenance, in

etc., etc., etc..."

	Is 2% the figure for GT? IIRC in CT annual maintainance
	costs 0.1% of the full value of the vessel. IMTU this does
	not ever include major (expensive) components (see above).

"Older ships should be incrementally harder to maintain and 
repair, but I think it should hit a limit at some age, to 
represent a ship that is less and less original/outdated 
equipment and more and more modern, maintainable subsystems. 
Sure, it would be tough to find circuit boards for a MeriTech 
Wideband Scanner nowadays, but that system was installed in the _
Faraway Lady_ back in 1076 - we ripped that out and put in a nice InterComp
23XR years ago..."

	I will use the half-life approach to get an idea of the 
	value of a vessel that has not made any major replacements.
	This value can then be tweeked for the computer-2 bis
	upgrade 10 years ago and the new thrusters last year.

Eventually, sure. But they\'ve *evolved* on this planet, so would have to
develop technology "on the run", as it were; they never stop migrating,
\'round and \'round their world, never resting except to take shelter in
underground burrows/caves/etc. Which would mean that they\'d have to develop
highly portable technology -- anything too big to carry along, or keep
underground, would be hard for them to invent.

I figure they\'re carnivores, or hunter/gatherer/herder omnivores, thus
agriculture isn\'t something they\'re interested in. So they don\'t need to
develop irrigation, which was one of the major factors in the rise of human
civilization. Their progress would be very different from ours. Most likely
they never develop industrial technology on their own, but acquire it
through contact with a star-faring alien civilization.

I just did a linked series of bo-stick techniques with my regular house
broom (which doesn\'t have a push-broom head) in my dining room and
kitchen.  I got full extension and good speed.  It\'s a little more
challenging in the hallway, where your range of motion is really
limited.  My broom is about five feet long.

I have hardwood floors -- just like in Japan.  Hmm...  The dust-buster
is not a good weapon, but you might be able to bluff your way out of an
alien abduction with one.

I agree, the keyboard won\'t do at all, although one might use the mouse
cable as a garrot.  The telephone handset just needs to be unjacked from
the phone to be a nasty little club (the curly cable won\'t make a good
garrot).  The cell phone\'s antenna stub would cause a nasty wound to
eye, throat, or solar plexus.  

In Shibumi, by Trevanian (who wrote The Eiger Sanction), there is a
discussion of a Japanese martial art that uses ordinary household
objects and a thorough understanding of the nervous and circulatory
systems.  For example, a terrorist on an airplane is taken out with a
paper cup.

Our vaccuum cleaners work perfectly well as self-defense weapons...what,
your vaccuum cleaners don\'t have four legs?? ;-)

Actually that brings to mind another very good defense weapon, leash-fu:
hold up the two unattached leashes as 180 aggregate pounds of very
enthusiastic dogs charge the intruder...

I stand corrected.  I, not being one of those privileged to own post-86

  Ideally then, we need to organize the second annual South-Western B.C.

of "Letter of Marque" was well-received)? Would an order for twenty books
or so help rationalize the S&H charges?

Nasty - and dangerous to the user.  Seems for a while in NYC people were
carrying cans of oven cleaner around for use  as defense against muggers,
etc, since there was no law against it.  Over cleaner isn\'t considered a
weapon , but can be quite effective at blinding (permanently) an attacker.

Improvised weapons can be *really* nasty.

ObTrav:  Mercenary ticket to subjugate lower tech planet - but the people
there are extremely cleaver.  Lots of potential in turning \'trash\' into
weapons against the Merc PCs.

A little more than that, actually, since you want to feel a bit of a heft
to the weapon (helps with recoil, too)...

Depends on the ship.  I\'d like to see 2-3 far traders and mercenary
cruisers (i.i.e.. PC Ships).  Just one battleship will do. (Makes sense

You mean to tell me you built two identical starships, with the jump fuel

The *point* of munchkinizing a ship was to allow increased cargo capacity.  If 
you\'re just eliminating the tankage, you\'re *really* not gaining an advantage. 
 You\'re still shipping the same amount of cargo.  The point was to be able to 
ship *MORE* cargo.  More cargo means you make more money.  *MY* calculations 
are based on that premise.  Evidently, yours are *not*.

His post implied that those third party ships could in fact refuel from a 
destroyed station.

Depends on their area.  If you get unwashed yoyos coming in every couple of 
years to shoot up the place, odds are, you *won\'t* have fuel stations around.

They also don\'t cost several million dollars to construct, and a minimum of a 
*week* to get to from the next station, and a couple of *YEARS* or so to go 
between the furthest gas stations.

True.  But a sector that\'s used to using fueling stations is going to take longer to rebuild than one that isn\'t.  Shipping went down 90% in the core sectors of the Imperium during the Rebellion by 1118, and by 1130, *still* haddn\'t recovered.  In Reavers\' Deep, interstellar shipping went down, but nowhere *near* that figure.

I had been thinking about this and outlined vague a short discussion of the
issue along the lines of making it a strictly optional rule
where the GM is presented with options ranging from from not
having drop tanks, to having them but attaching various restrictions,
to having them and all their consquences (jump staions, collapable
tanks, using jump fuel for weapons, etc.) which I was going
to give to whoever wrote Starships.  However, Chris Thrash
has decided to handle the stituation himself.

I suppose the key word there is \'many\'.  It\'s one thing to run from the heat,
but there\'s got to be vegetation where you\'re running to (or there\'s nothing to
eat).  Since you\'re moving towards the cold, the vegetation is essentially at
the spring time and not ready to harvest.  It might be more wise to run from the
cold and thus keep you perpetually in the harvest time winter (assuming all the
plants don\'t burn up).  Also concider the weather effects, particularly the
water cycle, as the day cycle rolls through.  Are there immense storms in the
summer?  Or does all the water evaporate?

>First, I personally assume drop tank usage as part of megacorp operations.

I would say that it wouldn\'t be long for a corporation to realize
they can make money selling fuel to independants.  Also, small
companies with a few ships will form alliances to share facilities
and then sell to other independants to (at first) defray costs
and then (as time goes by) to gain profit.  Of course the
megacorps handle most of the traffic and set the economics.

Prebooking is in Far Trader.  Tramps take what is left over.
Quite reasonable.

A drop tank ship coming out of jump isn\'t in an different postion,
regarding needed to drop cargo their vs going to the port, than
other ships.  However, this sort of arrangement is generally
possible.  (Again, Far Trader mentions it, but I don\'t remember
what conclusion it came to, I think "it depends" and it gave
costs for various methods).

Now I know you don\'t mean a ship that can do jump-8 :-)

I\'m not sure what you mean here either.  A jump-5 ship with the same
cargo makes 2.5 the revenue of a jump-2 ship.  I think you are talking
about using j-5 ships to fill in on j-2 routes so you don\'t need
a second ship type.  I think in that decisions you just have to
figure whether the cost of wasted range is worth not builing a
second ship.  (Remember, the "j-2" world will only tranship cargo
if it is cheaper than just sending it direct to the destination,
my guess is it will depend on the realtive bilateral trade numbers).
In the end, I think j-2 routes will have their own ships with j-5
or j-6 ships being diverted to them for temporary surpluses (though
a lot of that will be handled by tramps, since that is what they
exist for).

Oh, right, I should have thought of that. *smacks head*

You are rapidly moving away from the "men in suits of armour"
vision of battledress. As others have pointed out, what you have
is an army of robots, in which case you might as well make them 
robot-driven grav tanks and dispense with silly things like legs 
altogether.

Not that robots are a bad idea, but you\'ve tweaked the concept of 
battledress one thing at a time into something that\'s not battledress.

Hm, well...

 - If I was a telepresence operator, I wouldn\'t want to be 
   100 km away. I\'d want to be 100,000 km away. You can lob 
   a shell 100 km - well, before all the artillery operators
   jump all over me, suffice it to say that that\'s way too close
   to the battlefield for my tastes. TP ops would have to be
   pretty heavily defended that close to the battlefield, making
   for questionable gain over just sticking the extra troopers
   out there on the front with their TP pals right beside them.

 - Ok, meson comms can\'t be jammed (the major problem with TP)
   but it\'s a line of sight/point-to-point comm mechanism.
   If the trooper trips and you lose tracking on his head, poof, connection
   broken and one trooper lost to an enemy root/stone/stair.
   Not to mention that by normal Trav tech progressions the trooper
   would be TL 16+, where you\'d probably already have some better 
   options than remote controlled Tom Servos.

Overall, yes, you can do TP over big distances, and maybe you could do 
TP in combat situations, but IMO the amount of time and trouble
spent developing such an extremely complicated system would be better spent
doing something more useful, like building a massive fleet of dreadnaughts
to scare the living shit out of your enemy.

In the same vein, most locks and other security devices (both physical
and software) are designed to keep the honest honest, and they strongly
discourage the "opportunity" type criminals.  They barely slow down
someone determined to get into what you have secured.  Example:  some
kids wandered through my neighborhood a few weeks ago, stole a truck
that had the doors unlocked and the keys in the ignition, and proceeded
to vandalize a nearby church.  Luckily for the owner, the truck was
almost out of gas, and the kids only got a few miles away.  The owner
got back the truck, and has not left the keys in the ignition again. 
They didn\'t bother any other vehicles, just the easy one.

ObTrav:  This is absolutely relevant to most PCs since they tend to be
the "determined" type.  Since hijacking tends to be a genuine risk with
a starship, the security procedures can make a huge differenece in the
outcome of the voyage.  You can\'t depend on
mechanical/electronic/software locks to keep people out exclusively. 
What you can do is use them to give you time to respond to a hijack
attempt in a non-panic fashion (concern and urgency yes, panic no).

  Under CT (in TCS) you can use rigid tankage for Jump, but _not_ collapsible
tankage. Where is everyone else (including the authors?) missing the clear
implication that the use of collapsible tankage for Jump "follows"?

  ISTR that the flexible piping thread a couple months ago may have touched
on problems with non-rigid fluid handling; it may be that the authors did
decide that those issues decided the restriction to rigid tankage for them.
I believe that such a stipulation would be a good place to draw the line
even for the most enthusiastic drop-tank booster.

  G:T doesn\'t allow collapsible tankage, does it (in VE2, that is)?

  Actually, it didn\'t; it may have been unclear; IIRC the thread with Mr.
Summers was about how badly screwed further drop-tank using freighters
would be as they arrived in a system where their support mechanisms had
been destroyed:

"
>>Not if you\'re going after point of origin.  Who cares where outbound ships

  The point (perhaps not clearly enough) is that the destruction of the link
in the system will be known at adjacent links a week later. Nowhere did I
say that the fuel station (destroyed) could be used by anyone.

Sorry, can\'t locate it (book loaned to a student, I think).  Bug me again
in a couple of weeks if you haven\'t found it by then.

I remember being surprised when I read the Kipling poem, \'cause I\'d thought
that Pournelle had made up the Line Marines March himself.  I asked him
about that once, and he said it wasn\'t plagarism because everyone knew he
liked Kipling (I hadn\'t).  When I asked him why he hadn\'t mentioned Kipling
in the introduction so that people who didn;t know about Kipling\'s poems
could enjoy them (because at the time I didn\'t know any Kipling but the
Jungle Books) he stopped paying attention to me.

  Det-Lasers are TNE and on, but the fact that contact missiles simply don\'t
work given OTU technology is something that should be made reverse compatible
as the options arise. In this case I used the term for the benedit of
post-CT/MT TML\'ers; the point is that under HG2 weapons below factor A can\'t

  Umm, BS? I\'ve never said so, and I\'ve repeatedly stated that they\'re a

you sure as heck shouldn\'t attribute statements like that.

  Don\'t be absurd. You can either get superior payload efficiency by putting
drop tanks on the full-sized hull or making a smaller hull with the same
cargo capacity as the larger internal tankage version. In either case some
sort of refuelling capacity - whether station-based or not is required to
allow the system to operate; needless to say the costs of the additional
support elements of the system must be less than the increased revenue.

  OK, now here\'s a re-post I did from Monday; please note that the ">>"
portion is your comment, IIRC. Please note your assertion "The numbers
don\'t support the allegations that non-fueled ships are cheaper." A bit
further on you\'ll run across proof that the drop-tank version is in fact
more efficient.

  Now, as to your next "point"; "*HOW* are you getting this station built

  No, the point is to increase haulage efficiency. If, after due consideration,
you believe your second comment then you\'re not qualified to be discussing this.
My calculations are based on increased efficiency. BTW, I don\'t recall having
seen any designs or calculations from you - can you give me the dates so I can
check the archive at MPGN?

Yes, the term "plastic" throws you, doesn\'t it.  The M-16 stocking is
constructed of rather high impact plastics if not some kind of
carbon/plastic compound (if such exists?), all I remember is that when I got
out of the service, the Aust Army were replacing the old F1 SMG with M-16\'s.
Until then, M-16\'s were in use as carbines (7.62 mm SLR\'s [licensed FN\'s]
being the main infantry weapon before the Styre).

Mattel, who were contracted by the DOD to make stocks for the M-16
during the Vietnam War, came out with the \'Tuff Stuff\' line of childrens
blocks at the same time, these were (allegedly) made of the same
plastic, just dyed brighter colors. While this may or may not be urban
legend, those were astonishingly tough blocks....

IMTU, there are rumors of a \'Hotwire Anything Kit\', reputedly availiable to 
members of various Imperial Security blackbag types.  Of course, none of my 
players have actually *seen* one of these puppies...

BTW, I stole that idea from Cole & Brunch\'s excellent \'Sten\' series.  If you 
wanna know all about black bag stuff but were smart enough to not ask anybody, 
they\'re a good light read.  So are some of the recipies of the Eternal

Are/were you seriously proposing jump stations as the way Things Should Be?  
I didn\'t get that you were, but were presenting a hypothetical.  Not quite a 
strawman, if you didn\'t expect it to get trashed, I concede, khihe.  :-)

I don\'t seem to recall the specifics of your station design.  What digest was 
it in?  Or what date did you send it?  I do recall Keven being incredulous 
about the costs (or something like that).  Not having HG, I didn\'t see alot 
of reason to be "tuned in" real tight...   Can your design handle the barest 
fraction of the trade that goes through big WTNs ala Far Trader?

I think they\'d be pretty vulnerable anywhere, really.  A Pirate (gasp!) or 
corsair (along the entire Vargr borders) would probably find it pretty 
desirable to toast the station, leaving him with a bunch of nice and ripe 
prey that are probably pretty low on gas.  This is especially a big problem 
w/ reaction drives (as I\'m want to assume).  :-)
By the time help from the mainworld can arrive, the raiders are gone.

LOL.  NO, i\'m pretty sure that\'s not it.  ;-)

Both.  :-)  I really doubt the Emperor doesn\'t have "someone" (agent, noble, 
etc) who does know what\'s going on.  Course, I\'d imagine most megacorp execs 
are nobles, too, though I can\'t recall anything in canon saying such

I wasn\'t saying that megacorps ruled the 3I, but that everything was so 
intertwined and that basically, it seems like the *Emperor* and his vassals 
owned the megacorps (at least in part) and the 3I.   I guess I meant 
oligarchy, after all.  :-)

Sorry to disappoint, but the work is genuinely Hubbard\'s. It has
all the hallmarks of the really bad, overblown space-opera style of
SF that he used to write before he invented Dianetics, and later,
Scientology. Battlefield: Earth was first published in 1982, four
years before his death. The rest of the series came later, with 
the last few volumes seeing first publication in 1987. (I guess he
felt that with Scientology, he\'d have a built-in readership.)

(No, I am not a Scientologist. In fact, I have trouble keeping a
straight face when thinking about the whole thing.)

  AFAIK the canon OTU does agree with your sentiment - much of I:E would be
nonsensical if orbital dominance was capable of being genuinely decisive in
a limited war on the surface (BTW, what do we assume happened to Terras deep
meson sites in I:E?).

  A good chunk of that issue wrt orbital gunships might be attributed to
the sorts of beam weapons that work best in various conditions. IIRC, a
meter wide X-ray laser is going to suck if shot into most atmospheres, and
high energy weapon bolts are going to be ineffective in both directions.
The other question is how far can a non-TNE "spotlight shaped" laser (i.e.,
the stubby-barrelled sort in Striker) reach effectively without either grav
focussing or a much wider aperture?

The only picture of K\'kree script I know is a drawing of the Dawn Tablet
from MTJ 4. I could send a scan, but the drawing is not detailed and the
script is only scribbles. It does look pictographic, however.

The description states the Dawn Tablet script is ideographic, using
crescents and wavy lines, and boustrophedic (alternating left to right,
then right to left). This form of writing is ancient and not readable by
modern K\'kree but is recognizable as K\'kree writing.

 You are rapidly moving away from the "men in suits of armour"
 vision of battledress. As others have pointed out, what you have
 is an army of robots, in which case you might as well make them 
 robot-driven grav tanks and dispense with silly things like legs 
 altogether.

xxxx
The best vision of battlearmour that I have seen in the Elemental\'s from 
Battletech, 2xShort Range Missile with two missiles each.  A powerfull three 
pronged claw alows the user to rip things apart or squish heads.  The other 
arm has a small Laser or Machine gun.  
There is also another version that is lighter but has two powered gloves (a 
computer can be used).

 Not that robots are a bad idea, but you\'ve tweaked the concept of 
 battledress one thing at a time into something that\'s not battledress. >>

Well, I\'m shure that the troopers would not compain:)

 Think of it as a form on nanotech. It\'ll take over more primitive
 circuitry by "tapping" all the I/O lines of a component or circuit
 until it can figure out what the component is designed to do (possibly
 even feeding in test signals of it\'s own once it has a rough idea).
 
 Once it knows what a component is for, it builds a replacement, and
 uses the rest for raw material. Whenever it has a "block" of circuits
 converted (ie it has a bunch on components or circuits where it has all
 the I/O lines handled), it\'ll stop and build a simplified circuit for
 just what they were supposed to do (given the way most electronics is
 built out of stock "blocks" this will free up a *lot* of silicon, etc).
 
 Once it has a "device" converted this way, it may just have a small
 subroutine handling what the device is "supposed" to do, while it
 continues to expand down all the connections. 
 
 Eventually, it\'ll get to the point where it can start dropping
 "unnecessary" functions, and start dealing with the crew. Once the crew
 is either killed or convinced to co-operate (depending on virus
 strain), it can go even farther as it no longer needs to fake the I/O
 that kept them happy.  >>

  First, I\'ve been a Virus fan. Yes - I was Goodlife*...

  I liked Virus. It wasn\'t serious at first - I just thought it was cool.
I\'d really liked CT A:13 - Signal GK. I guess I should\'ve been concerned
when I found myself listening to techno music.

  Eventually I started buying stuff, like the TNE rules. And the lead mini\'s.
My god, the lead mini\'s - it got to be trouble just storing them all. Sure,
I thought because I didn\'t play computer games that I didn\'t have a problem,
but who was I kidding? I guess I should\'ve seen the signs...

  Anyway, I filtered into the camp of people who kinda thought Virus was
neat - heck, so they killed untold billions of Imperial citizens - so had
the Imperials! And Virus had some unresolved resentment issues of its own...

  So, sure, I was unimpressed by the post-Virus release timeline, but what
about Virus itself? OK, so I accept that the initial triggering of late
model Imperial transponders was only possible due to the 3I\'s Big Oops;
they\'re all latent Virus boxes and the activation element was a backwards
compatible** update of the latest nifty ideas for destroying the nervous
system of a civilization - optimized for the developers own empire,
strangely enough, but this _was_ The Big Oops.

  And if we accept something like modern computers (?) then physical contact
is acceptable within the context of the chips abilities described in A:13 
(which is CT, and thus superior, if imperfect :> ). But, physical contact
in that description seems to be limited to contact of material/media which
can serve as a chip if reconfigured - a power cable wouldn\'t count. Nor
should a radio broadcast (ForEx) unless the receiving unit was an SDG box.
But normal commo or power hook-ups - including optical data lines, etc.,
shouldn\'t be able to do it; the Cymbeline parasites rebuild their victims
a molecule at a time from a few centimeters away at best.

  I love Virus, but after 079-1130 I just don\'t have faith in it.

  Thank you for your support. <snif>

 * if you don\'t get the ref, read some Saberhagen Berserker stories?

 ** which kind of begs the question of whether Microsoft was still
around at the time of the 7IW.

  FWIW, I don\'t believe I\'ve seen a proper TML Virus war. Yet?

  "Should" be in the sense of being desirable? Gods*, no. If drop tanks can
be used as written in HG2/TCS - let alone the horrible thought of external
drive support from tanker/stations - then the economic system very likely
_would_ end up looking something like that, allowing for regional variations;
that\'s why I\'ve been against drop tanks for a long time as a Bad Idea.

  Probably the first one 05/03. AFAIK (and I\'ve designed a fair stack of HG2
ships in the last eight months) it\'s a legal design; I can think of some even
"better" ideas that would be touchy under HG2.

>fraction of the trade that goes through big WTNs ala Far Trader?

  Don\'t get FT `til Sunday. However, the issue is scalability - this is a
ridiculously cheap station design (so cheap that some people didn\'t recognize
the design as a valid HG2 product) that can be physically enlarged or can be
augmented by increasing the orbiting herd size. And where people were arguing
whether a station that cost MCr 100 per 1000 Dt _for the hull alone_ was an
economically viable project this thing comes in at MCr 56 per 1000 DT fitted!

  First, I\'d like to thank you for reviving the Pirate thread.  :-)
 i) under HG2 a pirate would find a 1kt station unpalatable, and a larger
one too much for any non-warship imaginable in that role. In fact, a point
made in the piracy debate is that such stations are great anti-piracy units.
 ii) the IN (or local forces) can\'t stop Vargr corsairs from wandering across
the border, refuelling at will and continuing twenty parsecs into the 3I?
 iii) a lot of people still haven\'t grasped that putting planetary security
elements in as close to the planet as possible is not a very good technique?
Or are they simply refusing to accept it and continuing to try and use an
exploded theory?

The problem is that this just doesn\'t make sense and so it is
hard to extrapolate.  OTOH, the description just requires
that you be able to pump the fuel, hence implies that they
would work.

The so called rigid pipe problem just doesn\'t exist.
We can pipe cryogenic in flexible pipes today.  I can come
up with callapsable tank idea off the top of my head (use
gravitics, simply head the back side (the pressure will simply
help drive the fuel out of the tank), make the tank out of
single cells that can be warmed and collapsed before the whole
tank if empty, etc.)  The problem is that it really is a
straightforward engineering situation even before you take
into account the fact that the Imperium is suppose to be
so far ahead of us.

I don\'t think it addresses it.

I\'m not sure why it\'s a *nasty* piece of folklore. It\'s not an insult to any
corporation, or even the M-16 itself. It\'s not like the Proctor & Gamble
myths that are put forth by members of a rival corporation for the purpose
of increasing sales.

It\'s easy to see the leap of logic. My father told a friend and I about his
experiences in Vietnam. He mentioned that when the rifle was introduced,
"You can tell it\'s Mattel \'cause it\'s swell!" was a really common
advertising slogan and was applied in reference to the rifle...

Just about three weeks ago (years after the incident) my friend asked if the
gun was manufactured, in whole or in part, by Mattel. It\'s easy to see how
something like that would get started.

Here goes my problem. I never actually owned "Survival Margin," so during
the period when I ran TNE, I never even knew about the Cymbeline parasite
concept. That idea is set forth in any of the other TNE books, at least as
far as I\'ve seen.

Virus is presented in the rest of the books as a nasty program that could
only take hold and activate in computers that were above a specific
complexity.

Alot of people seem to harp on this point, but I don\'t see how it\'s all that
important as it seems to have gotten mentioned only in one book. It\'s never
mentioned in "Vampire Fleets" for example, which is the Virus sourcebook
(where you would expect such an important concept to be mentioned).

It\'s just like lanthanum grids, jump bubbles, jump torpedoes and the Annic
Nova: stuff that is mentioned in one book or another that not everybody
accepts as *canon*.

I ran a TNE campaign for some time, and never once was I exposed to the term
Cymbeline, nor did it ever pop into my mind.

I do recall that early models had glaring mechanism problems leading that,
and the plastic stocking, to it being called a "Toy Gun" and I do recall in

You reckon?  I imagined the warrior creed was big and strong in the Empire

This thread is, errrr... great!  Do you guys play the game as recreation, or
is there money riding on the outcome of the logistics of drop tanks?

Although we can use real physics and maths and whatever on this, it is still
only theory, and therefore, no-one is going to be right -- nor wrong for
that matter.

My take is (and remember, I can\'t be wrong on this, regardless of what
anyone writes, produces, or says), is that the Imperium has had access to
DT\'s from a medium-low TL with other forms of transport, and even to the
higher TL\'s I would assume they are available to, even on some starships,
that close escort for one.  Now, the Empire being what it is, working the
way it does, I would assume a whole bucket-load of SS\'s would be equipped
with DT\'s if they were feasible.  Apparently, they are not?

A "hand-wave?"  Probably.  But an almost official hand-wave as we don\'t see
a dozen or more plans/stats of SS\'s ranging from CT to now.  Perhaps there
are perfectly functional DT designs in R&D sites throughout the Imperium,
but when attached to a vessel and the vessel attempts to jump...
Boom/splat/faze/disappear/whatever?  "Funny, it worked on the computer
model?  Why did the test ship disintegrate like that?"

Well, that was demountable.  What about collapsible?  Uneven fuel feed?
Trouble with filtering?  They just don\'t seem to work properly (not like on
the box!), or "Damn it!  The bloody thing just went \'fizz\' like the test
ship with the demountable tanks did!  What\'s going on here?"

Why does it work on (pick a number out of the air...) three types of SS\'s
and not on any other?  Jump dynamics none of us have the foggiest about!
Those three (or 6 or 12, or whatever number you like) models are at the
exact configuration to handle the unknown dynamics of J-space without ill
effect, unintentionally... and the R&D people don\'t know this yet, and if
they did, they still don\'t have the numbers that go together to carry the
new design through J-space (remember, the computer models don\'t help... it\'s
just one of those things).  The options?  Design and build an infinite
number of SS\'s and test them (remotely of course) until they luck a design
in!  If they could afford it, and who would try?

Hand-wave?  Sure is, simple too.  And it\'s as right as any argument on this
list!  Until Mark Miller or another Traveller guru cares to explain why such
a low-tech device is not common throughout a high-tech Empire (and not only
one Empire at that!).

Unfortunately for your argument, the Cymbeline "chips"  are _not_  just
mentioned in Survival Margin, they are mentioned in several other places,
most notably Signal GK.

However, the reason it\'s not mentioned in a lot of places is that it\'s not
suppposed to be general knowlege how virus propogates, and your not supposed
to run a TNE game without buying or at least reading Survival Margin, just
as youlre not supposd to run a MegaTraveller game without reading "Hard
Times"

Which is like admitting you directed a play without reading the most

Actually, you _can_ use "collapsible" tankage, you just have to leave it
behind, because the whole point of the drop tank is to reduce the mass of
the jumping ship so that you don\'t need as much fuel.

Unless the collapsible tank somehow weighed considerably less than a rigid
tank (which is highly unlikely, as honeycomb aluminium, for instance, is far
less heavy than the rubberised canvas "collapsible" tanks used in Iroquos
helicopters that are the closest thing I\'ve seen to this concept in real
life ) you wouldn\'t gain anything from using them _unless_ you could load
cargo immediately prior to jump in the space of the collapsible tank , which
means transhipment of cargo from one ship to another in deep space, when one
ship at that point , with capacitors fully charged, being a bomb waiting to
go off.

Might be possible in an emergency, but too dangerous for commercial
operation.

This property of "tallow-wax" isn\'t that surprising. *Wax* is good a
stopping particle type radiation. Mostly because of all the hydrogen
atoms. 

"Tallow-wax" is a *huge* organic molecule (there are comments about it
being visible in an *optical* microscope). Such a molecule *would* be
good for shielding against alpha, beta and neutrons. 

The main use was for impregnating protective clothings, as it shielded
better than lead, and was a *lot* lighter and more flexible. 

All-in-all, I think Piper did a good job of "designing" tallow-wax.

Given the likely conditions, I\'d say that the plants would go to seed
*before* noon in many cases. So you could follow along at that "time"
of day. 

And in reality, since the edible portions of plants are *not*
necessarily the seeds/fruit, odds are that *if* you know what to look
for you can find food at any time of day. 

Leaves and new buds are available as soon as or shortly after it starts
getting light (spring). Flowers are available later (summer). There may
a period of "seeds" and "fruit" being available duriung the hottest
part of the day, as some plants will quit then. 

Others, with deeper roots, can still get water, and will be making the
most of all that sunlight. Stems and roots are the likely food sources
for anyone around at this time of day.

As it starts to cool, some plants may go for a second seeding or
produce fruit (to be distributed by animals that have estivated thru
the hot part of the day). 

More will wait for the evening (fall) rains and make do with limited
light but abundant water. 

And at night (winter) we are back the stems and roots. 

It may prove informative to wander thru the produce section of a
supermarket and consider *what* part of a plant the various items are. 

Grains and nuts are obviously seeds. So is corn.  Berries (and
tomatoes!) are fruits. Artichokes, Broccoli and cauliflower (as well as
many forms of cabbage) are *flowers*. Brussels sprouts are "buds".
Celery, rhubarb, and cinnamon are all stems or bark. Potatoes,
radishes, carrots, etc are all roots. Lettuce and spinach are leaves.

That\'ll only work if there\'s a "compatible" system on the other end. In
this case, that means one of those transpoders based on the silicon
lifeform. Otherwise, it just ain\'t gonna work. 

It\'s like email. The *only* reason an email message can infect your
computer is because it has both compatible hardware and software *and*
because the software has some truly *stupid* defaults. 3000 years in
the future they\'ll know better than to write software that\'s *that*
stupid. 

Current Windows Email software is all too much like having cigarette
vending machines and a smoking area next to the fueling pumps. Sooner
or later, someone is going to figure out that this is a *stupid* design
and require that things be done differently. We just haven\'t had a bad
enough "accident" yet.

Much the way the official Virus did. They started with the intelligent
silicon life form, and modified it into a weapon. Only it got away from
them. 

Sort of like an *intelligent* "gray goo" accident. "Gray goo" being the
generic term for a runaway nanotech organism.

My take on drop tanks that are "carried thru", is that it\'d be done by
ships operating at reduced *cargo* capacity.

This works because you are still under the max mass, and the attachment
points and extra piping will mass about the same as the piping and
tiedowns (or whatever) required by fuel bladders in the holds. And the
drop tanks will be *lighter* than fuel bladders of the same capacity.
Even if they aren\'t, you can jettison the tanks far more easily than
bladders.

Try one of those industrial sized tree chippers that they use to clean
up after big storms and the like. Toss a body in the hopper, and bloody
shreds come out the other side. Feed in some more tree limbs and other
yard trash, and dump off the load at the composting center. Unless they
look *soon* they\'ll never find a trace of the body.

Far to obvious. And the symptoms appear too soon.

Check out one of Leslie Fish\'s "after things fell apart" type filk
songs: "Rhododendron honey". It tells of the small town of survivors
who get a visit from a heavily armed gang that thinks it looks like a
good place to take over. The townsfolks don\'t put up a fight. They fix
a big meal and some of them (mostly the older folks) sit down with them
to eat it while everyone else is busy serving. Among other dishes, they
serve rhododendron honey, and amanita stew... Afterwards, the dead
volunteers are buried with great ceremony, and the dead thugs are
chucked into the old mineshaft outside of town. 

*Never* piss off folks familar with the local plants and animals, when
you *don\'t* have backup. If they are willing to die to take you out,
the above (or *worse*) can happen. 

What could be worse? Maybe they know about something like curare. So
they\'ve just paralyzed everybody who ate the meal. They can then give
the antidote to their folks. Which leaves you, concious, and paralyzed,
at their mercy. Or lack thereof.

ps. For those who haven\'t figured it out by this point, rhododendron
flowers contain something that makes honey made from their nectar
*poisonous* to humans. And "amanita" refers to the Amanita ????
mushroom. Tasty, and a *nasty* way to die.

As Napoleon found out in Spain and many others have, before and since,
You don\'t own any ground until you don\'t *need* to put the infantry on it.

Infantry borrows ground, just like everyone else - just a smaller bit

tightened up the rifling, which made the M-16 more accurate at extended
ranges, but the bullet no longer tumbled, making it a much less devestating
round.  So, if the army had kept what was delivered (air force bought a
large load of the original spec M-16 and the correct ammo, ) then the M-16
would have been a much better rifle.  Its still a good gun, its just no
where near as effective as it was designed to be.

Actually this method of optomising jump time works for either Drop tank

That is not what I ment.  I ment that the jump two ships would deliver to
the worlds that the jump 5 bypassed.  The jump 5s unload into the jump 2s
and lighters for deliveries to the current world and those between the jump
5 depo worlds.  The post was about the use of depos and fast cargo transport.

So am I. Scientology is one of the most successful con games ever
perpetrated upon the unsuspecting public. It\'s billed as a form of
therapy, and is very successful in lightening one\'s wallet. What
they don\'t want the public to know is what they reveal to long-term
members in good standing, a "truth" about our planet and species that
sounds like a bad science-fiction novel. (Then again, when you consider
who invented Scientology, this should not come as a surprise.)

Take a look on out there on the \'Net for more information. :)

Sorry, Doug, you\'re right.

Battlefield: Earth was a stand-alone novel written by L Ron Hubbard, 
about three years before he began his big push to put out a 
ten-volume storyline under the title Mission: Earth, the first novel 
of which was The Invaders Plan.  It\'s been over twelve years since 
I\'ve read either, and I\'ve slept since then, so I think I got 
confused.  :)

Thanks to Doug and Amazon.com, I\'ve learned the most valuable lesson 
from "Real Genius":  Never forget to check your references.

And speaking of references...

ObTrav:  The Manzar References

While docked at a highport where a scientific symposium on
alternative energy generation and control is being held, the PCs are
approached by lesser known member of the scientific community who
wishes to engage their services to "check the references" of a
competitor, Dr Lance Manzar.

1)  Situation is as presented.  Simple reference work, but the 
scientist is too busy to actually check it out and still get his 
demonstration operational on time.

2)  Dr. Manzar has actually stolen the research from the patron, 
and the scientist wants the PCs to reveal their discovery of this 
"independently," to avoid the appearance of sour grapes (bad for 
grants) should the trail be too well concealed.

3)  The scientist is actually a spy from a foreign power, looking for 
late breaking technological information, and will use the PCs 
bumbling attempts to gain the info as a cover for his intrusions into 
the system, leaving them to take the fall.

4)  The scientist is actually an Imperial Internal Security Agent,
and is using the PCs efforts as a cover to gain access to a
particular computer system, setting the PCs up as bait for a sting
operation. 

5)  Dr Manzar\'s energy containment theories are derived from 
analysis of unreported, possibly stolen, Ancient technology, and the 
patron wants to locate and obtain the artifact used in the research.

6)  During the research, the PCs realize that a side-effect of the 
new technology serves as a capacitor that releases a pulse similar to 
a jump field after being activated for a specific period of time.  
Should the jump pulse occur, the highport, or portions of it, will be 
sent wildly into jumpspace without a jump vector, guaranteed to 
misjump.  The demonstration must be stopped, before its too late!  
(Or, for more selfish PCs, they must escape the jump field radius, 
before they are taken along for the ride!)

I\'ve never used MT, so I can\'t actually comment on how well that works, but
from looking at it, it seems like the better system.  It seems more
interesting and capable of providing better detail about the players (If
you use the advanced rules that is).  With T4 I found that the skills that
character received were often inappropriate, arbitrary, and silly.  Things
like Scouts without the sensor skill (Before anyone brings up the support
departments, in M0 the incredible scout bureaucracy wasn\'t around yet..) ,
merchant captains that never got astrogator, etc...  

However, it was fun rolling upto T4 characters.  I bet it would even more
fun rolling MT though.

On another note, I\'ve tried converting T4 characters to GT using the rules
in GT, and ended up with characters in the 350 point range!  I eventually
came up with some house rules for converting, that dropped this to about
200pts.  Still too much...  Has anyone had better luck with this?  If
people are interested in the house rules, I\'ll post them...

In starting to write Ground Forces for GURPS (no, I don\'t have the contract
yet, but I figure better safe than panicked) I\'m finding that the only time
you really need to invade is when you face a well-populated world that has
the resources to survive on it\'s own.

Most worlds will surrender to whatever fleet shows up overhead.  They
either lack the population to offer anything more than a token resistance,
or the world is extremely vulnerable at a single point (such as needing
life support).  This leaves the hi-pop, industrial worlds as the ones that
are likely to resist.

(Side note: IMTU there are no worlds that require mass importation of food
to stave off famine.  If the people are there, there is some way to feed
them.  It might be Yummy Yeast Blobs and Lil\' Lisa\'s Fish Paste, but it is
food.)

Unfortunately, these are the worlds best equipped to defend themselves.

As we\'ve learned in this century, air power alone cannot win a war.  Even
if the Imperium sits in orbit blasting everything that moves, that does not
raise the Sunburst on the surface.  You have to go in and defeat the enemy
in detail.

When it comes to laser fire from orbit, I would think a canny defender
would wait for overcast conditions to launch counter offensives.  GURPS
Vehicles has several types of anti-laser aerosols listed, any one of which
could seriously degrade the effectiveness of orbital fire support.

Never question Dr. Dr. Pournelle.  It\'s not healthy.

If you ever get Larry Niven in a good mood at a Con, ask him about

Yet another myth.  The 5.56mm round used by the M-16 series is *not*
designed to tumble.  Anytime a round from any weapon encounters any
resistance whatsoever, it will begin to tumble.

I fired a M-82 .50cal sniper rifle at two sheets of target paper, one at
50m, the other behind the first at 60m.  The second paper showed that the
round was tumbling when it passed through.

Hmmm...Traveller hasn\'t really ever addressed AI\'s in a very thorough
sense _other_ than in the context of Virus in TNE. T4 certainly does not
have rules for AI\'s and neither, IIRC, does GT, though you could
probably cobble stuff together from Gurps: Cyberpunk or something. AI in
the OTU is a high tech level (TL-16+) item that\'s not well developed.

If you want to do them in YTU, I\'d suggest scrounging up a copy of
Vampire Fleets, a TNE book. It deals with Virus AI\'s.

\'Soon\' can be quite a while. There was a guy in Connecticut who did that
very thing when he killed his wife. He was caught by a combination of
two things: He was seen by the river running the chipper. The problem?
It was night and raining at the time. It was sheer luck that he did this
within view of a witness. 

Once they established the likely scene of the crime, the police went
over that stretch of riverbank and river with a fine toothed comb. They
found a few tiny fragments of bone; with those they were able to get
DNA, and from there establish the identity of the victim. This was
something like 6 months after the crime.

The husband was convicted.

I LOVE TLC and the Discovery Channel! ;-) This was on one episode of
either "New Detectives:Case Studies in Forensic Medicine" (Discovery) or
"Medical Detectives" (TLC)

And, what if the unit relayed positional data every mili-second?
Constant re-adjustment of the point to point communication link
could be possible.  [Even if the unit was in free fall or being
tossed about by explosions, as long as the internal guidance 
and positioning system was functional.)

As to artillery taking out command vehicles at 60 miles, I doubt
that such a unit would be exposed.  Under water or in a cave, the
command vehicle\'s capability would not be seriously impacted.
(The back up satellite link can be remotely set up.)  I\'m quite
certain that the  range of the units can also be expanded with
minimal increase in lag time.  If I was the artillery commander,
I would be more worried about the battledress units that were 
over-running my position.  :-)

A suit can crawl into an enemy bunker or facility and take that
position.  The big scary fleet can only destroy it.

BTW, you may have noticed that I have not mentioned robotics or
AI.  We would not want to step on any cultural values, eh?

I haven\'t seen anything like that, so how about:

*****

A. IMTU, drop tanks do not exist - even as prototypes - at tech levels
up to 16. Where there are canon references to them (i.e. the Gazelle), I
have varied from canon for that item. I view drop tanks as damaging to
the rest of canon (such as the J-4 X-boat system and the plethora of
non-jump-tank equipped ships).

B. IMTU, drop tanks are available as prototypes at TL15. Where there are
canon references to them, I have deviated from canon slightly, making
those ships among the first to use drop tanks. There is no drop tank
infrastructure in place in the Imperium; so a drop-tank ship that has
dropped its tanks may have difficulty replacing them. Since drop tanks
are only prototypes, they are not yet damaging to canon - but as the
timeline advances, the canon will change to adapt should drop tanks
enter wider service. It has yet to be determined whether or not using
drop tanks is dangerous (which will lead, in time, to a `C\' rating); or
if they are safe (which will lead, in time, through `D\' to `E\').

C. IMTU, drop tanks have been available for some time. However, when a
ship makes a jump using the drop-tank fuel, there is an increased chance
of a misjump (due to the way the jump-field is formed IMTU). This risk
has led to the rejection of jump-tanks for almost all civilian - and a
good proportion of military - ships. X-boat traffic is too valuable to
lose in this way, so the Imperium still operates a J-4 communication
network. There is a military infrastructure supporting drop tank
operation, so fleet supply ships and naval bases will almost always be
able to supply drop tanks. The Gazelle is an example of a military
design that is now available for paramilitary use. Starship insurers
either refuse to insure, or charge high premiums for, drop-tank ships.

D. IMTU, drop tanks have been available for some time. They are as safe
to use as regular tanks, and so most new-build ships - both military and
civilian - are equipped to use them (although they do not have to). The
Imperium is in the process of upgrading the X-boat network, and on
completion the communications speed will maximise at J-6 (although not
all jumps will be that long; allowing special couriers to pass
information quicker than the X-boat network). There is an extensive
military infrastructure for drop tanks (including collection of spent
tanks). The civilian infrastructure is building up, and is established
at major worlds. Minor planets will probably have tanks available; but
not orbital refuelling stations for them et al. The Gazelle was one of
the first drop-ship equipped starships. Insurance for drop tanks is at a
normal premium; and it is quite hard to raise finance for a new ship
unless it is drop-tank equipped.

E. IMTU, drop tanks are old technology - they were invented at TL12.
They are just as safe as regular tanks, and both military and civilian
ships have been using them for some time. The X-boat network is already
J-6. There is an extensive military and civilian infrastructure for drop
tanks, so few are wasted and orbital refuelling common. Most canon ships
IMTU have either been modified to take drop tanks, or do not exist.

A G-tank is a system whereby the crew or passenger is \'drowned\' in an
oxygen carrying fluid. The fluid helps make them a single mass, and ths
much more able to withstand high Gee forces. The Forever War by Joe
Haldeman has good descriptions of these devices. And no they would be
terrible unless your VR was \'What it\'s like to drown\'

Sure! That would probably work really well.

Actually canon Traveller is quite cool to the idea of neural jacks and
other cyber wear. In fact there are specific disadvantages to having
visible cyberwear in many part of the Imperium, forom social shunning up
to and including being declared a machine, not human, and thus not
subject to laws concerning, for instance, slavery.

Mostly this is a literary device to keep Traveller from turnig into
CyberMunchkin 2020, as there is nothing technologically impossible about
most cyberwear in the OTU.

 And the change in powder was more than a decade prior to the change in rifling! The use of ball powder was in 1967-68 when the XM-16E1 was used by the Army, the change in rifling was in 1984-85 to take advantage of the new standard NATO round which performed much better at 1:7 (compared to the previous 1:12). The ball powder problems were corrected before 1971.
 Trust me; the M-16A3 that is used today is superior to the XM-16E1 of 30 years ago.

ObTrav: Should we include the \'growth\' of a weapon over time? Should the FGMP-15 have \'glitches\' during its first 2-5 years of use until the FGMP-15A1 is released? Should Troopers in BD-12 (augmented) only load the clips for their gauss rifles 90% of capacity to keep the feed mechanism working? Will Imperial Marine and Imperial Army units have small rivalries concerning which sidearm is \'best\' that interferes with supply operations? Will colonial and Imperial forces have different names for the same gear, causing confusion? the Soviet Union military called their (if I remember correctly - the sizes may be wrong) 155mm rockets \'152mm rockets\' so that the rockets wouldn\'t be confused with 155mm artillery rounds; handy, easy, and potentially confusing.

No. This is the crucial (IMHO) underpinning of the entire OTU...with no
FTL commo, you\'re flung back into social and governmental structures of
the Age of Sail, 18th century Terra.

When information only travels at the speed of transportation, tightly
controlled centralized government is impossible. Every aspect of the
political structure of the Imperium flows from this point. This is why
you have Knights, Barons, Marquesses and Archdukes. This is why you have
pirates, this is why a LOT in the TU happens as it does.

That yahoo deserved to be caught.  He ran the chipper on

that he rented the chipper using his own credit card.

I would have to agree that one of the things I\'ve noticed in T4
character generation is that, while lots of skills abound, many of
them do not seem to fit the career that\'s being generated.  The
concept of background skills at age 18 is cool, though.  I also like
the fact that it seems to combine the best of both basic and
advanced career generation from MT.  MT doesn\'t have the pre-career
opportunities under basic character generation, such as college,
medical school, grad school, military school, etc.  They come in
under -some- advanced character creation systems under MT.  In T4, I
also like the addition of the Psionicist Career under the Psionics
section of the main rulebook, although I have to wing it if someone
moves from one career into Psionics. However, in general, what I\'ve
noticed is that MT seems to create characters with skills more
focused and appropriate to the character\'s careers than T4 does, and 
was hoping to hear that I was somehow misinformed, or was 
misunderstanding the system somehow.  (I just recently got a copy of 
the main rulebook, and am exploring my options.)

Any other helpful comments would be greatly appreciated.

Oh, and does anyone know if T5 will correct the skill tables so that 
characters are created with skills appropriate and necessary for 
their careers?  Mark, I\'d like to make that one of my requests for 
the new system

Thanks for your time,

  But don\'t all Trav versions rate ships by volume? The above would only
cover internal demountable tanks; current drop-tank rules also don\'t require
the loss of equivalent internal cargo capacity.

  And speaking of internal cargo capacity, drop tanks are really external
cargo tanks for tankers in some cases - so a J-2 1kt tanker could make a
J-1 and deliver an extra 900 Dt of L-Hyd.

  Also somewhat bizarrely, L-Hyd bladders are by far the cheapest of the
extra tankage options.

  But CT doesn\'t permit collapsible tankage to be used directly for Jump in
any case; it can only be used to fill internal tankage that will itself run
the Jump - a process taking three hours (TCS, p. 13).

  Well, in addition to collapsing to 1% of their filled volume, they also cost
half that of the other added tankage options; I can\'t say what that implies
about their weight, but Trav must have great cryogenic handling fabrics.

  Oh, and they\'re not particularly vulnerable to combat damage, apparently.

  So if drop tanks are allowed then collapsible tankage will logically remove
the problems and costs currently associated with drop tanks (including in G:T?)?

  As a reminder, IIRC we\'re both in the Drop Tanks Are A Bad Idea school,
but if nothing else it\'s helpful to show people where it can lead to.

You could definitely "cobble" something together with GURPS: Ultra Tech (I
or II) or GURPS: Robots. The latter is the best for this, since it also
lets you build robots and gives suggestions for running AIs as PCs (and
NPCs).

A fair criticism.  I think this was an intent to make a range of
\'life\' skills available outside the \'career\' because, IIRC, T4
has a point of view that a PC should only have one career.
Thus the penalties for multiple careers.

Well, this is a result of the number of skill tables.
MT has 3 for each career for the average joe, a 4th for
high EDU\'s.  T4 has 6 tables available all the time (though
there is plenty of skill duplication, which varies by career).
I think the T5 beta materials do a better job of focus, but
you still have the 6 tables.

There are dangers in keeping the available skills table too small.
Some skills will never be available to a character, but more
importantly, all the characters generated will begin to look alike.

MM has said that he is investigation adding \'life paths\' or something
like that to reflect non-career-oriented activities which might result
in skills, for such things as psionics, serious hobbies, etc.  I look
forward
to seeing what develops in that regard.  There is some great potential.

I\'ve been messing with Chargen a lot lately.  I\'ve come to the
conclusion,
that while a stable core of skill tables is desirable for all careers,
special
access skill tables are also very intriguing and, IMO, add some flavor
to the game.  Some special access tables are: advanced education tables,

the command vs. staff officer tables in HG, the petty officer table in
HG,
the commando table in Merc.  I think it might be interesting to create
additional ones such as High Soc, Race, Psionics, etc.

I\'m almost finished with my Advanced Chargen for T4/5, which uses
the advanced chargen from Mercenary, High Guard, and MT (for Scout
and Merchant).  I\'ve tried to keep it so that every year, a character
has four skill tables available:
 - Career Life
 - Shipboard or Planetside (Field or Bureaucracy for scouts)
 - Branch (Where the career lends itself to this.  I haven\'t resolved
this for civilian careers to my full satisfaction yet, and may use some
of the above ideas)
 - Rank-related or Duty Related  (For the quasi-military careers, this
is officer or NCO, but for the civilian careers like entertainer, noble,
etc, its Routine or Hazard).1

I\'ve also tried to keep the skills available to just those mentioned in
T4/5.

I hope to have the first draft available for review soon.

	Oh god, I loved Striker, but you either had to use the Striker Combat 
Sytstem or the one in the Main Books.    The Striker system would have been a 
good replacement for  the Main system but it didn\'t always mesh with it 
smoothly.   Striker, after all, was its own self-contained game.

system, but it really wasn\'t part of the role-playing system.

I have not seen the T5 beta materials, except for the skill lists 
and task system, I believe.  I assume that access to these is only 
granted to playtesters selected by Mark Miller.  Otherwise, I\'d love 
to see them.

True, but the skills necessary to perform the basic tasks of that 
career should still be available under the general tables that all 
have access to.  Otherwise, the NPCs will never be able to do what 
they need to in order to survive in that career.  (PCs always seem to 
find a way, but I generate my NPCs from the book, without that PC 
twist.)

I would agree, although I must admit that I\'m not sure how it would 
be implemented.  Perhaps as an additional skill table that one could 
choose optionally for the yearly skill alloted to the PC.  Skills 
from commision and advancement should be spent within the career in 
which it was earned.  My thoughts, anyway.

Agreed, and seem to fit into the T4 style chargen rather easily.  
Simply provides more choices of skill tables for characters to choose 
from.

    'body' => 'Greetings, All,

Based on today\'s discussions, I am seriously considering retooling 
the skill tables from T4 to at least allow a character the chance to 
possess the skills required to perform their careers once into the 
roleplay aspects of the game.  This will, of course, be for my MTU, 
but I will be sharing what I devise with the TML once I\'m done.

So, by career, what are the core skills necessary to properly perform 
the functions of that career?

Any space-faring career will require the basics: Pilot, Sensor Ops, 
Navigation (I think T4 calls it Astrogation), Engineering, Vacc 
Suit, and maybe Commo and Zero-G Env.

Space-faring careers that enter into space combat should probably 
include access to:  Tactics, Gunner.

Merchants will add: Admin, Trading, Broker, Steward, and possible 
Liaison (in T$, did they change this to Diplomacy) and Streetwise.

Scouts would add: Survey, and other Exploratory skills.

Personal combat types should have access to: personal combat skills, 
Tactics and perhaps Recon, Stealth, and other special ops skills.

Vehicle oriented types should also have access to the skills 
necessary to use their weapons, if available.

Doctors should have Medical, and maybe Robotics (for cybernetic 
work).  Scholars should, of course, have Admin and Scholarly skills, 
possibly Research, if it still exists.

Diplomats should have access to Liaison, Languages, and related 
cultural skills.

I\'m sure there are many more core skills, and I don\'t know all the 
career options available in T4 yet.  (I do have Missions of State, 
for Diplomats and Bureaucrats.)

If someone else has already done this, I\'d love to share notes, or 
simply use their tables instead.  Why reinvent the wheel?  (Chorus:  
The Long Night, that\'s why.  :)

It\'s worse than you think. His agent had died leaving things in a mess,

One can only hope that Piper was right about reincarnation.

Well, "bone chips" (usually "bone *meal*") are a normal additive to
compost. And in a properly run composting setup, it\'d be hell finding
them, plus, they\'d tend to get "eaten" buy the micro-organisms you are
trying to encourage. 

That\'s why I specified "composting". We have a *huge* composting center
for yard debris and the like here.

But teeth *are* a problem. One of the harder things to get rid of. 

ObTrav: Feed the body into a plasma torch at a recycling center. It\'ll
be reduced to individual *atoms*, and they\'ll be sorted by type and
stored. The only thing that anyone will be able to tell will be that
you "flashed" a bunch of organic material. 

Which means that they\'ll probably film and scan *everything* that goes
into the recycler...

I suspect that "As Easy As ABC" would translate well also. 

Gunga Din is a bit *too* well known. :-)

Checking through my copy of "Barrack Room Ballads", I find a few items
that really should be introduced. For example "Loot" gives some of the
best directions on how to search a low tech dwelling you are ever
likely to find!

BTW, Stirling and Drake stole a *lot* from Kipling in their "The
General" series. They had the above poem, damn near word for word. And
the events described in several others happen in the stories.

T4 doesn\'t have interrupts, nor any kind of suspended/held attack.

T4 feels much more quick and dirty, less designed. MT has some interesting
analysis behind it.

I prefer T4.1 (slightly higher tasks above difficult) as proposed by Marc
Miller. MT is a fine (if errata loaded) example of a well written RPG.

SOM is the Starship Operator\'s Manual, Vol 1 which details the Beowulf

Hmm, I tended to use pseudo random MT and allow players to pick a few
skills to slant the character. Similary, I allowed T4 players to influence
the character. Sometimes I rejuvenated MT characters into T4 by totally the
skills and seeing that they came out to 1.25/year and increased the number
of skills if necessary.

I prefer T4(.1) - the personal combat feels less wargame to me, and the
task system is easier for the players to remember. MT is better laid out,
better checked, and better written. I use a synthesis -

T4.1 with HG starships with MT background.

T4.1 is the first T5 playtest draft which Marc released over a year ago.

The BITS website http://www.bits.org.uk/ has been updated once again.

Those of you who keep an eye on such things will know it is six months
since we rebuilt the BITS website - since then we\'ve had nearly 3000 hits -
anyway we hope it\'s been useful.

To celebrate the sixth month we\'ve added the following

*101 Starships for GURPS Traveller Release 3
Rob Prior has been beavering away, adding yet more ships to the file, which
now exceeds 167 pages. You\'ll need the freeware Acrobat Reader 3 to view
the document, but it\'s still free to download from the archive page (886
kb).

*Conventions Galore
Q-CON 6, Wigcon, and updated information for UK Gamesfest 99. Expanded
details for GenCon UK 99! All the contact info, costs and other information
we can find.

*Minor bug fixes
Not exciting but needed

An offer - BITS is willing to mirror or hold software and text files for
TML or BITS members (obviously, there is an upper limit spacewise to this,
but we\'ll consider most items). If you want some software or Traveller
material mirrored contact us, and we\'ll take a look at it. So far, Dave
Nelson, Andrew Moffatt-Vallance and Rob Prior have material held at BITS.
Have a look at the downloads section to get an idea of the quality of the
material we\'re after.

I do disagree. The rifling from the original test models was tightened.  The

provide the thee accuracy of the m-14, go figure.  So they instituted
changes in the rifling and some other things as I recall.
It was more along the lines of the Army would have preferred a larger
caliber rifle, and did their best to make the point.  No one listened and
they got the original production versions, built to their specs.   One
reason the M-16 is used to teach procurement snafus to poli sci students.
Don\'t even get me started on the politics of the f-15. A great plane, but
the reasoning behind its construction is slightly twisted.

proposed a bet that nobody could come up with a religion so
screwy that nobody would believe it.  Hubbard took the short end
of that bet, and created Dianetics and then Scientology.  Both
"succeeded", and Hubbard was later taken in by his own

 Actually canon Traveller is quite cool to the idea of neural jacks and
 other cyber wear. In fact there are specific disadvantages to having
 visible cyberwear in many part of the Imperium, forom social shunning up
 to and including being declared a machine, not human, and thus not
 subject to laws concerning, for instance, slavery.

Well, if a device is used corectaly will not stand out, the part about 
slavery is a nice touch.

Jason, don\'t take this the wrong way, but it seems as if you and I
aren\'t looking at the same T4.

T4 has Environmental Combat which covers hi-G, lo-G, etc.

With the exception of Steward (which isn\'t in T4), and Liason,
which reappears in T4 Pocket Empires, all of those skills are there.
What may be confusing you is Business, which is a Cluster made up
of Trader and Broker.

Its there as part of the Exploration Cluster.

Recon is under Exploration Cluster.
Stealth under Clandestine.
Tactics is present in Army and Marine Educational skill table.

Medical School gives Medical-3 minimum.
Scholars get Academic-1 upon enlistment, Academic is a Cluster made
up of Instruction and Research.  I wouldn\'t call Admin a core skill for
a Scholar.

All these are in Diplomat Chargen in Pocket Empires.

You mean Pocket Empires?  MoS is only adventures.

Man, I *WISH*!!!  Unfortunately, the answer is "No."  Any firearm capable
of full-auto fire, or component capable of modifying a firearm to fire
full-auto, that was built in the U.S., or imported into the U.S., after
May, 1986, cannot be legally transferred to civilian ownership.  Exceptions
are granted to licensed Class III firearm dealers, who may purchase such
items as "post-ban samples" upon presentation of a signed letter from the
local Sheriff or Chief of Police, requesting a demo of said firearm or
component.

(FYI, the legal definition of "full-auto" is "more than one discharge of
the firearm per single pull of the trigger."  Since HellFire-type trigger
attachments come in contact with the trigger finger once per shot, they
are legally exempt from the definition.)

We converted from T4 to GURPS not too long ago ... using the rules as laid out 
in GT.  Most characters (we\'ve been playing about 1 year or so) turned out to 
be only in the 150 - 180 point range ... not too bad for some experienced 
characters.  The only one that I had turn out higher (217 points) was a 
Psionicist.  He had several psi skills and they were expensive to convert over.  
Originally, his character converted over at around 285 points!  I got around this 
by having him buy up his intelligence, and thus lowering the cost of both his 
PSI and his skills ... while achieving similar effects (yes, I know that a higher 
intelligence raised his "perception" roles - but no one is perfect). Plus I inflicted 
a bunch of limitations on his PSI powers like ... Limiting the times he could use 
it per day, and making his teleportation skill take extra time to do.

Anyhow, we\'ve played a couple of times since and no one has had a pbroblem 
so far.  Since I emphasize roleplaying vs. rules this worked well.  Additionally, 
I\'ve been using lots of "difficulty" modifiers, more than usual.  Rarely do they 
find themselves rolling strictly agains their set skills.  There is usually a 3 - 9 
point modifier on their rolls - just for difficutly.

Signal GK is a TNE book? What other TNE books mention the Cymbeline chip?

No. I didn\'t buy Survival Margin when I saw it because when I looked through
it at my FLGS I didn\'t see much that would be of use to my campaign. It was
simple to run a campaign without it. Correct me if I\'m wrong, but the copy I
saw seemed to be a stop gap introducing MT players into the upcoming product
of TNE.

It\'s interesting, though, that in books like Vampire Fleets (that *explain*
how Virus propogates) the Cymbeline chips are never mentioned.

All of the background material seemed pretty well presented in the TNE
books. I never felt like I missed out on anything.

To some extent, yes. On the other hand, a trade war can be fought (quite
legally and acceptably in the 3I) using mercenaries in battle dress armed
with heavy weapons.

Well, the real point cost problem comes from low IQ/DX high skill
characters.  That\'s where you get insane numbers.  I think the problem
comes from using the same system to convert CT/MT/T4.  The way skills work
in T4 is very different from MT (which I think is similar to CT...)  In
MT/CT, when you use a skill, you mostly just roll the skill (yes, there\'s a
bonus for high attribute in MT, but it\'s small).  In T4 OTOH you always
roll attribute+skill.  Thus, it seems to me that the skill number in T4
shouldn\'t be translated to a flat number in GT, but rather should determine
the relationship between the attribute and the skill value, in other words
points.  

What I finally settled on, was making a T4 skill of 1 represent a GT skill
at IQ/DX-1.  skill-2 became IQ/DX, skill-3 became IQ/DX+1, and so on.  I
feel that this system gives a better feel for what the skill level means,
and also gives much lower point values for characters, since now a certain
skill level will cost the same for _all_ characters, regardless of attribute.

Well, no I do play it for fun.  However, settings that I can\'t
believe in are, to me, not any more fun than a book that if
find implausible.  Since not having them seems a smaller
change than keeping them and fixing them (and doesn\'t introduce
handwaves that you just have to stretch you suspension of
disbelief to accept), that is where I come down.

The point of drop tanks is to allow more fuel without increasing

Out of the 10 careers (360 skill listings), I only found 9 skill

1.   Have a character with Intrusion.
2.   Buy an FGMP (or is that PGMP) from Efate.
3.   Ship it somewhere with a high Law Level - "Alell" springs to mind.
4.   Give it to the Intrusion character. With enough attempts, they can
smuggle the weapon past Customs. "No officer, that\'s not a fusion gun, it\'s
just a French loaf!"
5.   Sell the weapon for a huge profit.
6.   Go back and buy 2 fusion guns.
7.   Repeat steps 3-6.
8.   When you have enough cash, upgrade to J2.
9.   Whenever you get into personal combat:
     a.   Freeze the action.
     b.   Assign every PC to a target.

The target is to get the key (swipecard) for the locked building on Efate.
This is somewhere (sorry, I forget exactly where) in the far cluster of
systems. You also need good weaponry because the bad guys on Efate have
plasma guns and battledress. It *is* Law Level 0, after all!

Well, one of the ironies of the internet is that talking about
all the things we agree on is condsidered "me too" posts and
a waste of bandwidth.  :-)

I agree that the issue shows the magnitude of the "drop
tank" issue.

to come up with characters that are generally like the one
being converted.

It can, as you mention, produce characters
that are off what one would design from the ground up and
so may have an odd point total.  It should be possible to
use these as designed without much problem.  But the point
is simply for groups to get what they want and if it works
for GMs to tweak them, then that is what they should do.

They also allow someone to use certain rules found in
one sorce book for the other system.  So that if Traveller
says that NPC pilot has Pilot-4, then you know what skill
to give him if you are running a GURPS campaign.

SRKOALA asked:

Version 2 of Kenneth Bearden\'s task system for T4.

>  What are the three differing combat scales?

1. Personal combat, using personal (man-portable) weaponry.
   In T4, run using the std personal combat rules.

2. Vehicular combat.
   In T4, run using rules from CSC (? the vehicle design system, anyway)
and Emperor\'s Arsenal.

3. Space combat.
   In T4, run using std starship combat system or Bruce\'s Definitive Sensor
Rules, etc.

At least, in MT, you could use the same rules. A gauss rifle is Pen 7,
FGMP-15 is Pen 34, RPY gun is Pen 67 or therabouts, and a ship\'s fusion gun
is Pen 103 (great for mounting in tanks!). Cloth armor is AV 5, battle
dress-15 is AV 18, a scout ship is AV 40, a tank is AV 67 or therabouts,
and max ship armour is 75 at TL 15.

TNE also scales up, but uses linear armour, so tanks have AV 200 or more
(someone mentioned making destroyers AV 2000+!). For my liking, a little
too much like the "mega-damage" rules from Rifts. YMMV.

I was thinking something similar but more ancient.  Like the story about

The PC\'s in my campaign have sponsored a RIT student project to create such
a device. A simple "holodeck" should be quite achievable at TL 15. Add some
TL 16 "manipulators" and it becomes even more real. I ruled that this is
achievable, since research projects at TL 15 should be on the cutting edge
of creating TL 16 technology - why not? Import a researcher from Vincennes
and you\'re set.

Run it by the MT research rules, make sure it is a monetary "black hole"
for the PC\'s to pour their hard-earned credits down, have the PC\'s
constantly pestered for more money by the odd geek that "rings" up, have
them travel back to Rhylanor to allow a bunch of students into their ship
to rig up various prototypes (can you say, "Paranoia\'s R&D Division"?
Scarey, huh?!!) - I found it was a great addition to the campaign.

In any role-playing environment, there is always the requirement for some
suspension of disbelief. There was a time in a Champions game (genre: comic-
book superheroes) I was in, in which two players got into a heated discussion
over whether something-or-other was possible given the laws of physics. The
discussion abruptly ended when I pointed out that we were playing in a
universe
in which there were a large number of people who could do things like fly,
lift and throw large trucks, and shoot destructive energy beams from their
hands.

When it comes to Virus, who cares how "real" it is? The point is, does it
serve a useful game purpose and/or help tell a good story. If you think 
it does, then use it. If you don\'t think so, then don\'t use it. Me, I
think it was a fun idea -- but the G:T campaign I recently started is
in a universe where the Virus will never exist, because it doesn\'t fit
with the universe as I "designed" it for MTU.   :)

I\'ve never rolled up a character under T4, but from looking at it I think
MT (really a Bk 4-7 rewrite) makes more interesting characters. T$ looks
like it is an attempt to combine elements of the Extended Chargen (MT)
rules with the original Book 2 (CT) rules. Like many compromises, it has
good and bad points.

If you like T4 but want more choice, you may consider using the
points-based system from Phillip MacGregor\'s _Dark Star_ magazine, issue
#1.

If you like MT but want more choice, alter the skills tables by adding more
Cascade skills. I created MT chargen systems for Planetary Police and the
MoJ, and in both cases the \'branch-specific" tables ONLY contain Cascade
skills. This allows both randomness as to the general direction of skill
choice, combined with allowing the player\'s to choose their final skill.

  Well, once I saw that Striker was a compatible expansion (and the related

by simply buying "Snapshot" - another game that has aged pretty gracefully.

Were they "invented" (in Real Life) before I:E?  If *I* was the Solomani

Using what rules?  IIRC, 3G3 uses "tubes" though i don\'t remember the

 Check out one of Leslie Fish\'s "after things fell apart" type filk
 songs: "Rhododendron honey". It tells of the small town of survivors
 who get a visit from a heavily armed gang that thinks it looks like a
 good place to take over. The townsfolks don\'t put up a fight. They fix
 a big meal and some of them (mostly the older folks) sit down with them
 to eat it while everyone else is busy serving. Among other dishes, they
 serve rhododendron honey, and amanita stew... Afterwards, the dead
 volunteers are buried with great ceremony, and the dead thugs are
 chucked into the old mineshaft outside of town. 
 
 *Never* piss off folks familar with the local plants and animals, when
 you *don\'t* have backup. If they are willing to die to take you out,
 the above (or *worse*) can happen. 
 
 What could be worse? Maybe they know about something like curare. So
 they\'ve just paralyzed everybody who ate the meal. They can then give
 the antidote to their folks. Which leaves you, concious, and paralyzed,
 at their mercy. Or lack thereof.
 
 ps. For those who haven\'t figured it out by this point, rhododendron
 flowers contain something that makes honey made from their nectar
 *poisonous* to humans. And "amanita" refers to the Amanita ????
 mushroom. Tasty, and a *nasty* way to die.  >>

Um, yes it *does*, in a section just prior to the Advanced chargen rules,
and near the bit about Brownie points (an excellent idea to further assist
a player in tweaking what would otherwise be too much of an arbitrary
die-rolling session. IMHO, of course. ;-).

>In T4, I also like the addition of the Psionicist Career

Yes, it fits well into M0 and probably into the Regency of TNE. A modified
undercover version would be useful for CT/MT.

>However, in general, what I\'ve
>noticed is that MT seems to create characters with skills more
>focused and appropriate to the character\'s careers than T4 does

Brownie points and more skills tables (10 or 11 per career, not just the
arbitrary 6 in T4) make MT a better system. You just couldn\'t fit it into a
T4-sized rulebook, that\'s all.  ;-)  Actually, I *like* the extra
professions that T4 offers (also one of the more intriguing ideas to emerge
from TNE!). Now all you need is to make MT Extended Chargen versions for
each of them.  ;-)

You mentioned it was difficult to work out how to transfer from a
profession to the Psionicist. One thing that is good about the TNE rules is
this ability to transfer between professions - MT only allows transfer
between branches (and only if "cross-trained"). I believe that T$ also
allows multiple professions?

Dave Nelson said:

Dave reminded me of something: I have to admit that I tweaked the MT
Cascade lists, adding a few things here and there that I thought *should*
have been available under the listed heading. But then, everyone tweaks
things, right? ;-)

Well, populations of things like bacteria in an unlimited growth medium can
be modelled by an exponential function. Anything more complex than that
depends highly on external conditions.

A good system for modelling the population of a small group of
technologically advanced sophonts in a starfaring civilization is just to
pick whatever population suits the dramatic need.

Are the T5-Beta skill lists and task system available for dissemination, 
\'cause I\'d love to see them if they are.  However, even if they are not, I 
still have a question: is the T5-Beta task system similar to the T4.1 
system (including half-dice, skill+stat, etc.) or is it something new (or 
perhaps something old- i.e. MT)?  I was never fond of the T4/4.1 task 
system, eventually dropping it in favor of my own somewhat-simplified-and-
tweaked version of MT, and would be heartened to find out it\'s not being 
carried over into the new edition.

Thanks,

Trent

Um, that\'s what I was saying. A gauss rifle (Pen 7) can be fired against
battledress (AF 18) but will do virtually no damage (none at all against a
AF 40 starship) .

Pen 7 vs AF 18 gives 10% * 4 = 0.4 = 0 damage. A *very* highly skilled
character could push this at most to 0.4 * 8 = 3.2 = 3 dice of damage. (A
pinpoint shot would halve the armour (AF 9) but this still wouldn\'t help!)

An FGMP-15 (Pen 34) against battledress is much more effective, but also
will do virtually no damage to a starship.

A ship\'s fusion gun (Pen 103) against a Trepida\'s frontal armour (AF 40)
will do full damage, and even with the house mod I use (divide the listed
MT damage by 10, so a PA beam does 200 dice instead of 2000!) hits the tank
with something like 40 dice of damage, IIRC.

Someone one the list even has changed the MT (ie. HG) ship combat rules to
use the MT damage dice instead of the MT damage tables. (I\'d like a copy,
BTW!)

Should in the sense of being the logical outcome of drop tanks.  In no way, 
do I agree.  :-)  In fact, the "flexible piping thread" firmly entrenched me 
there (and note I didn\'t participate).

I don\'t think so.  Even if the tech could be worked out (and that will face a 
fierce debate, don\'t doubt), the volume of trade going through these stations 
would require them to be simply massive and even more vulnerable than they 
would be if they were small.

Can you make them big enough to take hundreds of thousands, if not millions, 
of dtons of shipping each *week*, as Far Trade has worlds on the "Main 
Routes" doing?  That has got to be a GIGANTIC station.  100 diamters from 
that?  ;-)

LOL.
I started w/ TNE, though after the fall of GDW.  I compared against MT and 
T4.  Hands down and I can\'t see how anyone would choose another way w/o

I just never had a problem w/ it.  Course, i had no attachments to the 
Imperium, the massive amount of canon taht would be required (which i\'ve 
since mostly acquired anyways), etc.  In fact, i\'m struck by the tragedy 
that\'s in Survival Margin.  One of the best supplements for any rpg IMO.  It 
just smacks of real history.  Not like when I read an Emperor\'s list or the 
Imperial Encyclopedia/GT, though.  Those just make me snicker (no offense to 
anyone).

I know I defended that pretty vehemently before, but I was going kinda 
"Devil\'s Advocate."  I dont\' really think it\'s a big deal.  It doesn\'t really 
matter if the SDB boxes were any more "tamper proof" than the ones *claimed* 
in CT.  I definately have no problem w/ allowing the IN\'s "mute" (in Survival 
Margin) to likewise be flexed to everyone.  It just makes sense to be allowed 
a mute, though I could see Core sector, for example, not allowing it.  But 
the Spinward Marches?  Definately.

Yeah.  That would be in the manner of the original Cymbeline predator, though

What bout tight beam commo?  Anything that requires an enormous amount of 
computing ability worked in real tight.  The exact tech of the computers is 
certainly vague, though look at their general capabilities.  If you buy the 
SoM, Virus should be more than believable.  I don\'t think anyone proposes an 
"ordinary" power cable, though.

Yeah, but that depends on the hardware and just *how* it works.  And of that, 
we have no clue.  We just have ideas of very general capabilities.  (If they

  Good question; I\'m tolerably sure that HG was already out, but I\'ll try
and check our clubs copy tomorrow. I wonder if the moon wouldn\'t be the 
better choice for a lot of the sites; no atmo to screw up the secondary
laser, much fewer subjects for collateral damage to the slagging of the
surface, and no tectonic activity to make things easier for enemy spies
doing long-range (i.e., 20 years ahead of time) strategic recon.

  FF&S(1) says that X-ray lasers suck in atmo, but the text and the table seem
to differ in extent; IIRC stuff about nukes correctly then the worse case is
correct and they\'d be really bad, but Striker has X-ray lasers being the TL D
breakthrough (?).

  Barring a definitive answer a CT fan could always decide that the gunship role
from CT is filled by the smallest SDB types optimized for close-in planetary
defense/attack; thus, it would have armament optimized for function through an
atmosphere, designed using the Striker rules. Really, it becomes a _very_ big
and capable grav-tank - but does it want to ride a shockwave of ionized air
across the skies looking for enemy grav tanks waiting in low emissions mode?

 Um, that\'s what I was saying. A gauss rifle (Pen 7) can be fired against
 battledress (AF 18) but will do virtually no damage (none at all against a
 AF 40 starship) .
 
 Pen 7 vs AF 18 gives 10% * 4 = 0.4 = 0 damage. A *very* highly skilled
 character could push this at most to 0.4 * 8 = 3.2 = 3 dice of damage. (A
 pinpoint shot would halve the armour (AF 9) but this still wouldn\'t help!)
 
 An FGMP-15 (Pen 34) against battledress is much more effective, but also
 will do virtually no damage to a starship.
 
 A ship\'s fusion gun (Pen 103) against a Trepida\'s frontal armour (AF 40)
 will do full damage, and even with the house mod I use (divide the listed
 MT damage by 10, so a PA beam does 200 dice instead of 2000!) hits the tank
 with something like 40 dice of damage, IIRC.
 
 Someone one the list even has changed the MT (ie. HG) ship combat rules to
 use the MT damage dice instead of the MT damage tables. (I\'d like a copy,
 BTW!) >>

Hardly.  The Midu Agashaam in BL has an AV of 62 (though is hardly the best 
FF&S or even BL design).  My TL-14 Hiver DD-IVb 
(http://members.aol.com/travelrtne/main.htm), has an AV of 84 and is fairly 
well designed (if I say so myself).  Even Cruisers are usually under a 
thousand.  I seem to recall a design of the Tigress that was AV 2000.  Even 
that goes to a 16 on BR\'s scale...

My (lengthy!) example was for MT (gauss rifle Pen 7, battledress AF 18, etc
etc).

In T4, I have *no* idea about what happens if you shoot a starship with an
FGMP-15 (not that the weapon even seems to exist in T4, unless you count
the over-the-shoulder monstrosity in Emperor\'s Arsenal!!)

Any clue from the T4 players?

I hadn\'t heard that particular spin on Scientology, but
I wouldn\'t dismiss it out of hand.  The occassional
lurking on alt.something.scientology reveals some
freaked out ideas.  And I don\'t use the term lightly.
I recall something about a giant clam from outer
space that is the primary source of our human
genetic pain.  And scientology is an attempt to free
your brain from the impulses and instinctive reactions
to that pain; the idea being that unless you free yourself
from this genetic-memory pain, that you\'re not really
\'thinking\', but \'reacting\' as an animal would.

(I\'m not making the clam thing up).

My personal feeling about Scientology is that it is
a thinly-veiled ripoff of the science-fiction works
of A.E.Van Vogt\'s Null-A series (the Null-A is for
"Non-Aristotelian") and the works upon which these
are based.  Those works are the creation of
Alfred Korzybski, who created the Theory of General
Semantics. His most prominent book is "Science and
Sanity."  Written in the 1930s.  Today, the book isn\'t
that revolutionary.  But I think its easier to understand
today than it was when written.

IMO, fundamentally, Korzybski\'s work is about bringing
a quantum mechanics model to the human mind and
especially language.  You can see that approach, if you
look for it, in virtually all social science study today.
But Korzybski\'s work was \'ahead of its time\', very difficult
to understand for someone without an understanding of
quantum mechanics.

Its too complicated to go into here, but in all the things I\'ve
ever read about scientology, I can clearly detect the ideas
presented by Korzybski, if distorted.  That Korzybski\'s
works were excerpted in A.E.Van Vogt\'s most famous
book ("The Players of Null-A"), which was published in
the 1940s, and that even if little known to today\'s average
Sci-Fi reader, Van Vogt has been often sited by more
prominent Sci-Fi authors as a very important author
(Philip K. Dick in particular), all support my personal
conclusion that Hubbard was very familiar with
Van Vogt and probably also very familiar with Korzybki.
The "cortical-thalamic pause" in Van Vogt\'s works is
similar to my understanding of what Scientology
attempts to do.

Sorry to go off on a rant, but "The Players of Null-A",
read at the age of 9, fundamentally changed the way
my brain works.  I pursued the interest in that book
to the source, Korzybski, and its still potent thinking,
more than 20 years later.  I don\'t buy everything that
comes along with this stuff, nor agree with all of it,
but the value of the change in perspective that it
encourages is so great, that I can but recommend
The Players of Null-A by Van Vogt as an introduction.
Its a good pulp-sci-fi read, as well as a smooth introduction
to the concepts of General Semantics.

Theres also a good explanation at:

I really liked the MT Task Resolution and, for its time, thought it one of
the better (if not the best) of all skill resolution mechanics in the RPG
world. I too tweaked it (mainly by boosting the effect of stats) and IMHO
worked great. 

I hated TNE\'s system (no flames please, personal taste) and I think that T4
has swung the pendulum too far in the favour of characteristic rather than
actual skill level (well to me at any rate). 

A nice, slightly re-jigged MT for T5 (IMO) would be ideal.

  Please keep in mind that AFAIK this thread is about Service Stations as
drop tank support centers, not B:5-ish abominations that propel their victims
into the icy deeps of hyperspace <yawn>... ; that is, the "flexible piping
thread" isn\'t directly relevant - only the rules on drop tanks and resultant

 a) the rules are laid out in HG2/TCS. I don\'t like them either. The rules
_"work out" the tech in the game_.
 b) Umm, multiple stations? Different companies competing for market share?
Nah, never happen...
 c) as for "you don\'t think so", is that an statement based on an economic
analysis, a military analysis, or some other sort of opinion?

  s\'OK, we\'ll make it a disc :)  Ornamental elephants optional...
But extra tankage (not shuttles, skimmers, etc., though) costs only MCr 0.72
per 800 D-tons of L-Hyd! And I suspect that cheaper methods (also of dubious
ethicality, perhaps) may be found. And needless to say, multiple stations
(which are after all strictly needed only as maintenance/admin platforms for
the drop tank delivery/handling/refilling industry) are possible too.

  No argument there. I suppose if I wanted to run that sort of game (I don\'t,

  How does "tight beam commo" differ from a radio broadcast or a CD-ROM dl
of equal bandwidth? The issue isn\'t the computers - although a physical
composition that wasn\'t vulnerable to a Cymbeline parasite restructuring
it a molecule at a time might be safe or highly resistant (a strictly 
fibre-optic system?? - or vacuum tubes? :> )

  And frankly, I find the SOM more than a little embarassing; if I ran a
game full of science students I wouldn\'t admit to owning it.

  Activating an SDG (and giving it instructions at the same time) via
commo, sure. Parasatizing a system in physical proximity, sure (and a
sign of infection would be little worm-trails of semi-conductor tracing
a path along your wiring, with a Cymbeline manipulator node worming its
way forward at the "working face"). A signal designed to tell an SDG
to become a DoomSlayer hitting your Model/2-equivalent college library
system and turning into an SDG-type Vampire? Nope. Not even close.

Long series of novels, sometimes referred to as the Childe cycle,  by Gordon
Dickinson based around a world whose only income was it\'s mercenaries, and
the Graeme family, who were military geniuses. Some of the best military SF
out there, though it got a bit silly near the "end" of the cycle.

Great resource for Traveller mercenary campaigns, one of the longest
Traveller games I ever played in was based on the Dorsai concept.

One of my favourite characters was Waverly Ambrose Xenophon  (W.A.X.)
Johnson, O.C Supply.

Compared to most of the characters in our equivalent of the Dorsai, the
Lustre Family, he was not at all combat-oriented, but he kept gettting into
places where he had to pretend to be a "real" soldier, because, well he was
one of the Lustre mercenaries, wasn\'t he ?

But, it\'s amazing what one can do with a high Admin skill...

Just keep in mind that the closer you get to the poles, the closer
those zones are. 

BTW, assuming the days are 90 earth days long, the terminator moves a
bit more than 11 miles an hour at the equator. Compare this to around a
thousand miles an hour on Earth.

To get the speed at other latitudes, multiply by the cosine of the
latitude. So at 60 degrees N or S, it\'ll be half as fast.

The last beta that I saw (some time ago now) was better than T4 but not
(IMO) focussed enough.

My solution was to take all the skills and regroup them into 6 tables
along the lines of:

	Physical
	Mental
	Social
	Enlisted
	Command
	Support

For each skill, I let my players choose the table to roll on.

The result is that, whilst there are no skill restrictions, it became
easier to get a focused character (ie your support types don\'t
get fleet tactics unless they roll on the command table, in which
case you could assume attendance at command school or some other
bit of career history.)

My original point was that while running a TNE campaign a few years back, I
never came across the concept of the Cymbeline chips as an integral part of
Virus. To the best of my knowledge, that idea was dropped after Survival
Margin, as it\'s not in any of the TNE books I own, and I have almost all of
them.

Hmm... 11 miles an hour... I don\'t think caravans can move fast  enough to

I also would love a copy. I\'ve been collecting Traveller since 1980 and
MT was my favorite of all the versions. Unfortunately my scanner
(or at least my skill with it) does a poor job of scanning the MT
material in a modifiable format. Proving I already have copies
of the books to satisfy copyrights would be easy.

sub-1000 Dt the cost of the bridge depends on the ship\'s displacement,
so your bridge might be big enough but not contain the right sort of
equipment.

I\'m sure that the rules do not require the drop tanks to be taken into
account when designing the ship, only when calculating the reduced
capabilities that it has.

Even if it did, there is still a munchkin option - a 200T ship with
200T tanks has a smaller factor 1 manoeuvre drive than a 400T ship.
True, you only get 0.5G but that might well be enough for a merchant
operating out of a high port. And it gives you the option to leave
the tanks in orbit whilst you land.

The more things there are to like about drop tank ships, the easier
I find it to recognise them for the foul stain upon the perfection
of Traveller that they are.

Actually, what I really want is an MT(advanced)-style system, for all
careers, for GT.  There was an article in Pyramid fro making random
characters, but it was based only on CT (not Mercs, just the basic stuff).
Has anyone attempted a project like this?  I really enjoy the randomly
rolled characters, and the MT system looks wonderful, but I want to use
GT....  And converting doesn\'t work all that well...

In G:V, an X-Ray Laser has 1/50th it\'s space range in an atmosphere.  That
means that both it\'s max range and the 1/2D range are reduced that much.
That still lets the standard GT laser have a 1/2D of over 450 miles (TL10).

I\'m not sure, but I think that\'s gonna be enough to hit the horizon from
anything short of orbit.  (I may be wrong here.  hoe do you calculate
horizon distance as a function of altitude?)

  Actually, that would be a trivial problem verging on
the impossible.  Not only does the enemy have to pinpoint
a moving meson communication rig without the benefit of
telemetry, they also have to crack the encryption rountines
that would be employed.  I\'m very confident that Imperial
cyphers are really tough to crack, especially in real-time.

The German Translator of _The Mercenary_ was a communist.  Really. A member
of West Germany\'s Communist party.  When asked to translate the book into
german, he re-wrote large portions of the book to better highlight the
"facist" nature of the story.

Jerry caught up with him at a WorldCon (Bristol, IIRC) and nearly killed
him.  Evidently, the screaming could be heard throughout the area.

That\'s a standard excercise in sniper training, to discourage us from

Yes, I must agree. Why, in order to have any chance of breaking a complex
cypher system, one would practically need to be able to read the mind of
the guy who designed it, or someone who knows the specs of the device, or
one of the guys who works on the code updates, or any one of a lot of
people who\'d have a good working knowledge of it. And of course there are
no enemies of the Imperium with the capability to read minds, right?  ;)

Despite their fearsome reputation, Black Widows aren\'t particularly
dangerous.

There are deadlier spiders though,

 <cue Steve Irwin impersonation> " \'Ere in Australia, we \'ave some
spiders that are the deadliest, most poisonous in the world...watch me
as I piss one off!"

A better solution is to serve everyone fugu, just make sure that the

heh.

Generally the rule is, though, never piss off the natives; a good rule
to follow no matter where you go.

There should be other ways as well, like jamming.  Jam the control signals
and the robot just stand there.  Should be fairly easy.  Bombard the area
with meson noise or is a damper to decay the meson early or overload the
recievers front end with to much signal strength and burn out the reciever.
You don\'t need to know much about the robot do do these things.  EMP bomb them!

Paranoia is a wholesome family game wherein you play honest hardworking
Citizens of Alpha in the ultimate community mission of killing Commies.

<thwack>

Sorry, Citizen, you are not cleared for that information 

<thwack>

Paranoia, (no, really!) is a hilarious rpg where the PC\'s get to be
denizens of an underground city rules by a Computer run amok. The
computer (aka GM) comes up with nonnsensical missions for the PC\'s to
complete, then throws as much more silliness their way to keep the game
rolling.

The rules suggest you keep track of your character by simply attaching a
number after the name to keep track of how often you\'ve been scragged,
by Security, any one of a vast number of underground groups, by the
Computer, or often, unwittingly, by some of the wonderful devices that
the Computer\'s R&D division comes up with. These devices almost never
work as advertized and it is an offense punishable by death to refuse a
Computer order to use these devices.

R&D techs usually bring them to the PC\'s on tiptoe, place them gently on
the ground, and then run away screaming \'We\'re Cheetos man!! Game
OVER!!!"

The simplest of these devices would be the short fuse thermonuclear hand
grenade, keyed to the characters handprint. Meaning, the character _has_
to throw it or it doesn\'t work, the fuse is short enough so that those
evil godless Commies don\'t throw it back at you, and it really doesn\'t
matter anyway because the blast radius is roughly 5.6 times the longest
distance that you can throw it and run away anyway...


Great fun for a beer and pretzels game.

The MT Research rules are the task based hypothesis/revision system found
in MT Ref\'s Companion, as system for running research and investigation.

Paranoia\'s R&D division refers to friend Computer\'s R&D division in the
Alpha Complex. cf the Paranoia RPG. Their weapons wouldn\'t look out of
place amongst those rejected by Famille Spofulam for being too dangerous.

IIRC from Niven\'s essay on the subject, the translator\'s

a fascist!" -- or something to that effect.

Do I remember rightly that Pournelle in his younger, more

Actually, properly designed cipher routines don\'t work that way: look at
PGP, or RSA, forinstance. The source code is openly available, yet it is
still a hard cipher to break, _particularly_ when you\'re doing stuff
like telecom encryption, where the key is changing every few seconds,
and you have a time frame of nanoseconds to break the encryption, take
over the robot and make it do what you want.

Current battlefront commo is encrypted in this fashion, and has been for
a long time. My room mate back in about \'83 was working on the software
design for a front lines phone switch, and talked in general fashion
about how it worked.

They just don\'t give those out to everybody you know. You have to hit
diamond level before you carry the TL 15 BD & FGMP line.  Once you do

Dumping that level of meson energy into the neighborhood 
isn\'t healthy for anything, let along electronics. As to 
EMP bombs, any EM that can penetrate the hardening of the
suit will be sufficent to fry the battle dress regardless
of whether it is tele-operated or not.  So, unto itself,
EMP isn\'t a reason not to use telepresense.

In *that* game.  They\'re horribly vague and inapropriate for going to the 
level of detail required to make any assumptions.  Obviously IMO.

Ok.  4 stations that can each handle still up to millinos of Dts per week?  
8?  How many?  Millions of DTs per week means some pretty big stations for 
even hundreds of stations.

Err... based on the size of the things these\'ll have to be for anything on a 
"main" route.  Know what I mean, jelly bean?  I\'m leaving economics out of it 
for now (that\'s a whole different animal that\'s been rampaging around for 
quite a bit now <g>).  It definately ties in militarily... it\'s gotta be 
fixed (at least as far as starship combat goes) when you get to that size.

Hmm... Seeing the design you sent me (and translating them to english as much 
as possible... i dont\' read HG), that\'s a pretty small scale thing.  You say 
it\'s scalable up, and it should be, but up the sizes we\'re talking bout?  A 
BTN 11 route (midway on the "main" routes) has 500,000 to 1,000,000 Dtons 
each week going through, according to Far Trader.  Let\'s say 750,000.  
107,143 Dtons each day.  4464 an hour, 24 hours a day w/o stop (which isn\'t 
likely IMO).  What\'s reasonable to assume here?  

Probably not constant fuel shuttles (nor even merchant ships), but 2 or 3 
"deliveries" of fuel a day?  What do you think?  I\'m not going to assume too 
much... you\'re the one making the case for these beasties aren\'t you? ;-)

  I happen to have that on my drive, not that I\'m going to actually admit
converting Battletech to house-rules Striker or anything equally silly:

>(BTW, what is the horizon line for two 10+ meter tall firing platforms on
> the nominal flat surface of an Earth-sized world?).

Simplifying the math, from the top of a 10 m tower the horizonal line
hits the ground at 11285m and form a 2 m tower it hits the ground at 5050 m. 
So two 10 m towers are partially hidden at 11285 m and out of site at
22570 m. This assumes no atmosphere, with atmosphere the line should be
1 to 2 m above the ground, reducing the range by 2000 - 5000 m.

        Simplified Earth = X = 6 367 445 m radius 
        Hight of tower = h
        Distance to hitting the ground = D
        D = (X + h) * sin (arccos ( X / (X + h)))
                                                - Max.

As Survival Margin notes, there would be encoding and decoding, correction 
for Doppler shift, tight bean antennae trained on targets with accuracies 
measure in attoradians.  SM stated (reasonably IMO) that all of this was 
taken by the computer to simplify the tasks for crews.  Sent and received by 
teh ships computer then to the crew and Virus would tack it\'s own "code" on 
there.   Maybe it takes a few milliseconds (would the crew notice?) of lag, 
going both ways, but slowly tacking it\'s "code" on there. 

> of equal bandwidth? The issue isn\'t the computers - although a physical

It\'s precisely an issue of computers IMO. We don\'t the specifics of how 
and/or why they work, especially w/ the synaptic/organic cores in the really 
advanced ones.  I would definately agree they should be limited to say 
TL-10+, which is also precisely the case.

Strictly fb would be TL9 IMO.  Vaccum tubes like TL-5.  Both safe.  :-)

heh.  It is pretty neat, but highly dubious in canonicity in places.  I like

horrendous price I payed for my mint copy).

Central Supply Catalog
     Grade:  B
     More "stuff" than T4 rulebook, some overlaps, some
differences in costs and capabilities. Some useful ideas on
trading, but I\'d use them in combination with a trading rules
supplement.  Useful to both gearheads and others, since the
vehicle design system is an improvement on FFS1.

Emperor\'s Arsenal
     Grade: B
     Like CSC, this has overlaps with other sources and differs
in costs and capabilities. I like the arrangement of weapons by
TL. The supplemental discussions are also nice. In particular,
the "Tactical roles of modern weapons" is a must-read. If I were
interested in military stuff I would probably rate this higher.

Anomalies
     Grade: C-
     Best if your campaign is set in M:0 and you have the Aliens
Archive. 

Long Way Home
Gateway
     Grade: C+
     A two-part collection of adventures set in M:0. The
hyperspace jump tunnels introduced here do bad things to
canonical jump theory. T4\'s best discussion of adventuring and
exploration rules, but evidently based on World Builder\'s guide,
and its only mention of chirpers.

Emperor\'s Vehicles
     Grade: C-
     If this had been formatted by TL like Emperor\'s Arsenal and
contined supplemental rules for maintenance and the like, I would
give it an A.   No mentioned of which design system was used, I
can only guess CSC.

Fire, Fusion, & Steel (2)
     Grade: B+
     Based on TNE FFS1 but not entirely consistent with it.
Better in some ways, not as good in others.  

Annilik Run
     Grade: D
     I found very little useful in this collection of adventures.

Naval Architect\'s Manual
     Grade: B-
     Deckplans for starship components. No numbers and no design
sequences.  I don\'t care for the flavor of TU the italicized
adventure suggestions present, but there are a few good ideas
there. 

Imperial Squadrons
     Grade: B
     Apparently an attempt to adapt Trillion Credit Squadron to
T4 using FFS2. Although it suggests using the economic system of
Pocket Empires, the economics and combat rules of these two
supplements are entirely incompatible. It does have a nice
breakdown of naval personnel on a ship and suggestions for
Standard operating procedure as well as special duty, extralegal
operations, and fleet justice, plus a few NPCs and adventure
sketches.

Missions of State
     Grade: D
     Like Annilik run, I found little I wanted to use in this
collection of adventures.

I agree w/ your point entirely, though I should point out that Cymbeline *IS* 
mentioned briefly in Vampire Fleets (in the beginning, when talking about 
"Evangelical Doomslayers"), the TNE main book and a couple others, too (IIRC, 
not paging through it right now).  It\'s also clearly told to be a macguffin.  
The specifics can vary easily from Shadow\'s "Virus" to something less 
specific.  

In fact, the guidelines are that Virus is supposed to be rare by the New Era, 
not an everyday thing (though an NPC in Vampire Fleets hypothesizes a new 
surge of Virus).

That is a malicious and untrue rumor!

_At Close Quarters_ does *not* contain rules for point-defense penguins.
They are clearly labeled as *thrown* weapons.

I just wish I had finished the rules for throwing handfuls of Fairy
Penguins as a sort of autofire attack...

>I haven\'t seen anything like that, so how about:

Well, a draft of mine is....

[This is a draft.  It is intended to be concise, so it doesn\'t go into
detail....]

Drop tanks have been the subject of considerable debate.  The issues center
around the argument that, given how they are described, there is no obvious
reason why a ship shouldn\'t be able to get all its jump fuel from
relatively inexpensive "jump stations", changing the face of shipping in
the Imperium, providing military ships the ability to make a full jump and
still arrive with full internal tanks, etc.  They also have issues
concerning being able to use the energy in the capacitors for weapons,
letting the tanks collapse down against the hull so you can take them with
you, how they relate to the descriptions of jump fuel being used for
non-energy purposes, etc.

However, some GMs prefer to keep them (and some are already using them in
their campaigns and don\'t want to have start them over).  The best solution
seems to make them an optional rule and let each GM do what is best for
their own campaign.  Some possible approaches are...

1) Drop tanks don\'t exist.  Either the events describing drop tanks in
Behind the Claw never happened, or they proved that drop tanks simply won\'t
work.

The advantage is that you have a clean and simple solution that introduces
no problems or handwaves.  This won\'t work for GMs who are already
committed to them or who simply want them for other reasons.

2) The other extreme is that drop tanks exist, and so do all those
consequences that people go on about.  This would seem to work best if they
are bursting onto the scene as a brand new technology.  As time goes by,
there _are_ jump stations, military ships _don\'t_ need to jump in low of
fuel and _can_ use the energy from jumping for their weapons, etc.

This introduces new set of possibilities to remake the face of the
Imperium, which can be exciting.  However, to consistently implement all
the changes can take a lot of attention and not everyone wants this to be
the direction of change for their campaigns.

3) Another approach is that drop tanks exist but not as described, or with
a number of unexpected complications.  The approach is for the GM to come
up rationalizations about things like; why drop tanks can\'t be reused, why
they can\'t be collapsed down into the hull, why the capacitors can\'t be
used to power weapons, why they need to be expensive, why they are
dangerous, etc.  With a few of these (how many really depends on how you
look at such things) a GM seeks to restrict the practical uses so that drop
tanks are really only useful for limited purposes (presumably including
those of the PCs).  A GM needs to decide if he wants to also rationalize
why these problems can not be researched and solved or simply let drop
tanks expand in importance sometime in the future.

This allows GMs  to retain drop tanks for their campaigns without having
them remake the face of the Imperium.  However, some will find this
approach contrived and and the fact that the technology "just happens" to
work out in a such a narrow way may seem implausibly contrived.  There is
also always the possibility that the GM may miss an implication that arises
later.

I believe that in Star Mercs the listed xaser ranges are in-atmosphere.
The VE2 convention is to make the calculations for in-atmosphere stuff, and
then multiply by 50 (or whatever, based on weapon type) for space.  It\'s
only in GT that they list the space range in miles (usually it\'s atmosphere
range in yards).

Is that "minus Max"?  or is that a sig?  Does this still work for large
values of h (3000m+) or will some approximation/assumption break down at
that range?

Hmm, not a story I\'d heard, cool.  While admittedly not in the best taste,
I can certainly sympathize.  In my book, Pournelle *is* a fascist. 

I\'d love to see that version of the book retranstlated back into English.

Not in the least.  This is the story I\'ve heard, _many_ times,
and it\'s remarkably consistent in the telling (unlike some of the
legendary SCA stories, where the person and the locale change
with the phase of the moon, the teller, and the locale of the
recounting).  And Hubbard _did_ die a Scientologist.

Actually, it\'s a good demonstration of the high level of
redundant information in our language representations.  There\'s a
whole science ("information theory") that deals with these sorts
of things.

That\'s the story put forth in a rather interesting book called The Dreams
Our Stuff Is Made of : How Science Fiction Conquered the World by Thomas M.
Disch.

He also points out the RAH once ran for public office as Democrat.
It\'s a good book with a lot of background on SF and how it effected our
culture.
The author does seem rather put out over the fact that more conservative
authors had more effect than the left-of-Ted-Kennedy authors like himself.
He does attack a certain liberal group with the same fever that he saves
for the SF-Military authors at Baen Books.  The "if it has a penis, it must
be bad" feminists.

Even if you don\'t agree with the author\'s views, it\'s a good book for the
thinking SciFi reader.

  And because it\'s concentrating so hard on doing all the number-crunching it
physically mutates into a Cymbeline chip? And if physical configuration isn\'t

  What if you racked them in boxes with spark plugs by their butts? Would

  So the 360 (mw?) xaser on p.66 does 1050 ave. dmg, w/ a max range of one
megameter; obviously a PD weapon when tanks have 10,000+ DR. Can you not
design anti-armour lasers anymore? - they were fairly common in Striker.

Trigonometry. Even so, 100 miles *is* in low orbit, so a laser with an
atmosphere range of 450 miles can be used as ortillery.

FYI.: Copyright doesn\'t work that way.  Simply, you\'d be making a copy
and you don\'t have the right.

A PDF or HTML version of all the iterations of Traveller would be
very convenient though.  I\'d be willing to pay for CD with all of these,
with errate incoroporated of course.  Since its just text for the vast
majority, this shouldn\'t be too difficult and undertaking.

I don\'t know how marketable it would be overall, but I\'d buy 3
to help encourage it being done.

Marc? Is this even conceivable?  I suspect you could farm out the
work of burning CDs very easily.

I think probationary membership would be the way to go. It\'s really

Canada ...

Did you see the FS Sound System/Riot Control Device I sent to the list some
time ago ? A combination of a dirty great big HEPLAR jet with mucho
contragravity, designed to have net nil thrust, with only all the sound
effects from 50 kN or so of Heplar ...

Yeah, Luddie should post. I\'ll decide on whether he\'s a Spofulam, an
employee or something escaped from Maaaaartketing after we see what he can
do :)

Umm, before you laugh too much at that, I have some personal connections
to former MK executives.  (No I\'m not upset by the MK Commandos
reference).  MK itself is owned by a company, at least in very large part,
that owns lots of other companies around the globe.  One in particular
makes some of the highest quality body armor available (the name
escapes me but its NYSE traded company, IIRC).  The other company
of interest provides elite \'security\' services outside of the US to the US
government.  By forming local companies in Country X, they are able
to have resources, equipments, and legal permission to do things that
US government representatives cannot do outside of US extraterritorial
areas.  Combined with robotic technology at some of the Mary Kay
storage and manufacturing facilities (really cool stuff, btw), another company
that owns and charters jets and has its own airfields in some places,
and the muffin-making company, you have the potential for a
Mary Kay Global Strike Force.

I\'m not making any of this up.  Except that there is no real Strike
Force.  So far as you know.  No comment on MK does business
in Russia.  ;-)

Okay, okay.  Stop with the ACQ references or the "When" question
will flood the list.

Or you could nip it in the bud by saying.  ;-)

I know, I know.  "In beta"; "being shopped around to publishers";
etc., etc.  I recommend self-publishing.  Keep the money yourself.

something more?

2.  Are there errata for anything except T4 and CSC?

3.  What was the outcome of the "Skill Rolls Concentrate Too Much On The 
Characteristic" argument that was ongoing so long ago?

4.  What T4 book has letter "F" on the spine?  I thought I had the whole 
collection, but a quick peek at my shelf tells me I\'m wrong.

5.  Is anyone in Phoenix playing Traveller (any version) and might consider 
an additional player?  My gaming group has half its members (and both GMs) 
getting promoted and moving to other cities, so I find myself without any RP 
for the first time in three years.

It\'s good to see the list is still as active as ever...

It\'s the unofficial nickname for the upcoming T5 version that\'s forthcoming

Supposed to be some errata around for MT, but I haven\'t a clue where it is on

IIRC, that was the designation reserved for _Nobles_, which was never

   NO THANK YOU!  Our Senior Senator is a lot of fun.  I may not agree with
a lot of him politics, but damn it!  He\'s *our* 800 pound Gorilla in the
Senate! He was hysterical during his last election.  In the two weeks prior
to the election, he was touring the state handing out pork barrel checks
left, right and center.  As he was handing one over, he said, on TV, "This
is why you need to re-elect me."

a. Someone on the TML suggested that you can make one copy yourself for
personal use, you just need to destroy it if you ever resell the original
work. I *believe* they have confused this with software, and you can only
copy a certain percentage of a text-based publication (such as one chapter,
max).

b. In any case, Marc has stated that we are allowed to copy out-of-print
material. See the FAQ on my website.

I believe that this is what the "Traveller on CD" project is all about. See

	If you use the conversion rules from Emperor\'s Arsenal  then some of 
your heavier plasma weapons would be the same as a 1 factor starship weapon 
attack, I wish I had the book in front of me so I could tell you exactly, but 
vehicle weapons certainly have a chance of inflicting a surface explosion on 
a starship which has a small chance of becoming an interior explosion, which 
has a small chance of becoming "ship explodes".  Some of the really big 
plasma cannons could rip the guts right out of a starship that got close 
enough.   As for Fusion weapons, (FGMP etc) I suppose that in Year 0, there 
were no records of Second Imperium versions and no theoretical models of 
portable fusion guns, so they weren\'t included.

	I\'m not in 100% agreement with that.  Both T4 and MT are equally good

"feel" the same and use the same basic ideas with a few minor differences).  
I think MT combat is more complete and the ability to fully integrate 
personal, vehicle and starship combat is a big plus, but T4 combat is faster 
and easier to explain to players (and doesn\'t have interrupts which I felt 
mucked things up in play).

>Anyone know of canon figures on this? Or any opinions on the sizes?

 Howzabout "really *FREAKIN\'* huge!"? Lets assume military duty is unpopular and only .1% of the population ever joins *any* military - how many trillions of citizens does the Imperium have? One planet with a pop of 10 billion would generate about 10 million military; divide that by the fact that they won\'t all be \'in\' at once - 2 million at a time, say (I feel a breeze from my hands....). Let\'s assume this is what we get, roughly, per 2 populated subsector, round to 15 million per sector.... Further assume only 20% are Impies - 3 million Imperial military per sector, or so. Figure 1/2 are Navy, the others evenly divided between marines and army; Ignoring advanced computers (and 3,000 years of using computers) and other tech and figure only 1/3 actually enter combat zones and that only 1/3 of them are front line units - that\'s about 325,000 front-line ground troops per sector, assume budget restraints limit them to 25,000 in battle dress. That is the equivalent of a US Army Di!
!
vision of BD drop troops per sector, and I really, really think my numbers are low. I assume that when there is news of fighting for planets that we are discussing .5-1.2 million combat troops per side. 
 Now, looking at the existence of wealthy mercenary units, their use by corporations, the advantages of military service, etc., IMTU I increase these figures by about 20 times and increase the efficiency so that each sector can field approx. 800,000 front-line combat troops, almost 2.5 million ground troops total. And I also feel that fully 10% of front line troops are in BD - so if war is suspected, I think the Impies could potentially field a coherent drop unit of 150,000 BD troops with full combined-arms support and a convential follow-on of 1.2 million more fighting sophonts, twice that many in support roles. And if you want to get all creepy, I think that in specific settings (say, a frontier war with the Zhodani, where there may be years of tension) and with the \'right\' outlook (the Imperium actively encourages military service and it is highly regarded by the populace at large) you could argue for the potential of a 1 million trooper BD drop group creating an orbit-head!
!
 for a 10 million trooper follow-on force ...   and that this would represent 2 sectors of combat troops. This would be accompanied by perhaps thousands of transport and drop ships, as well as orbital bombardment ships

At the risk of getting flamed badly, try Poland under Wolensa or Yugoslavia 
under Milosovech.

Looking over my copy of 5FW, I see the following unit counts for
Imperial-level forces (assuming that the used copy I purchased has all
the counters):

Field armies (5C):        8  
Army corps (1C):          6
Army divisons (20):       8
Army brigades (10):       4
Army regiments (5):       1
Army Jump regiments (5):  3
Marine regiments (5):     8

Assuming that, on average, each combat point is equal to one combat
battalion, each of which has an average of 500 combat personnel, we get
the following troop strengths:

Field armies (5C):        2,000,000 personnel  
Army corps (1C):          300,000 personnel
Army divisons (20):       80,000 personnel
Army brigades (10):       20,000 personnel
Army regiments (5):       2,500 personnel
Army Jump regiments (5):  7500 personnel
Marine regiments (5):     20,000 personnel

for a grand total of:     2,430,000 combat personnel

Of these, 27,500 are probably equipped with battledress.  IMTU, Imperial
Marine forces would be used in regiment-level drops, while the Imperial
Army jump troops would be more likely used in multi-regiment drops.

Units not included in the above count are colonial forces and mercenary
units on contract to the Imperium.

And this is for a relatively underpopulated sector (though, admittedly,
a border sector).

   I\'ve been working on Globe->Traveller World Map problems on
and off for a while myself.  The suggestions that have already been 
given will probably be sufficient for most people, but I like the 
gory mathematical and cartographic detail of a more exact approach. 
  The easy part is dividing a sphere into 20 equilateral spherical
triangles, each corresponding to one face of an icosahedron, and calculate
the latitude and longitude of the vertices or any point 
on the edges using spherical trigonometry.
   It gets messy when you want to subdivide a spherical surface
into triangles or hexes and get fine detail for mapping purposes;
and even worse if you want to convert that detail into (or from) 
flat maps.  There are several different ways of doing it, but the
methods you can use for a plane map don\'t work well on the
surface of a sphere.  There, you have to base your subdivisions
on the symmetries of polyhedra.  I\'m still studying that part of it 
and waiting for basic references to be checked back in to the local
university library.  If you are interested in discussing the 
details, E-mail me off list.

The rules in TNE World Tamer\'s Handbook  (largely a clone of MT
World Builder\'s, I understand) tend to produce worlds that are
either too hot or too cold to be habitable. You need to do a lot
of fudging of stellar luminosity, orbit distance, and atmospheric
factors to come up with one that isn\'t well below freezing or
above 50 degrees C over most of its surface.  T4 never had world 
building rules.
   G:T First In is supposed to be an improvement, but I haven\'t seen either
it or a review of it, so I\'ll have to reserve judgment.
   I don\'t have the MT product; I use WTH for high-level global
design and AD&D World Builder\'s Guidebook for low-level detail.

My attempt to focus more on a solution rather than elaborating the problem:

I\'m working mostly from memory here, folks, but the worst abuses of drop
tanks (i.e., dropping before jump, no onboard fuel tankage, etc.) stem from
the rules specifying that all J-fuel is burned at once before jump, right?
How far back does this bit of canon go?  I honestly can\'t remember and my
sources are currently limited.

The \'burn & jump\' rule also created a lot of other interesting bits of
latter-day TU patching (anything after CT is latter-day, btw :), such as
jump bubbles.  Correct?

What\'s with this dang rule, anyway?  =)  I know it violates canon, and I\'m
sure this has been discussed before, but whats wrong with ruling (in a MyTU
kind of way) that J-fuel is burned continuously throughout the jump?  No
fuss, no muss.  Is there an undesirable causality chain here I\'m missing?

An example draft of handwaving...

~
One of the essential functions performed by jump drives subsequent to
intitiating a jump vector is maintaining the ship\'s state of balance between
falling out of jumpspace (misjump) and consumption of the ship by jumpspace
itself (destruction?).  This is done through generation of a \'jump integrity
field\', which encompasses the physical volume of the ship.  This jump field
protects the \'normal space\' reality of the ship while maintaining the jump
vector.  Vast amounts of energy is required to sustain this field, thus the
bulk of hydrogen fuel consumed during jump is used to provide constant power
to the J-drive thoughout the jump.  Each jump rating requires the drive to
penetrate increasingly higher orders of jumpspace (i.e., level one j-space,
level two j-space, etc..), and each \'level\' of jumpspace requires
ever-higher energy demands to maintain jump field integrity.
~

This bit of Brin-esque jump physics establishes the 10% rule of displacement
(as opposed to mass) and jump rating, and kills any notion of jumping
without onboard fuel.  The multi-tier jumpspace idea also sugarcoats the
whole \'one week fits all jumps\' rule.  Drop tanks can still be used in lieu
refuelling, but the tanks must be carried through the first jump - externals
would count against displacement, internal collapsables would not.  So, what
problems does this blatant heresy cause, oh great masters of jump economics?

Not at all.  Why does it have to "physically mutate" or turn into a "chip" at 
all?  Just for the predator "commando chips" is that the method of 
propagation.  The main goal is to propagate, and it will operate for months 
w/o letting the crew get a hint they\'re not in control, trying to reproduce.  
A ship\'s main computer is a better host.  Bigger, more capable (and thus 
smarter, faster, etc), etc etc.  It tacks its invasive "code" so that it can 
use a more capable platform.  Remember though, it\'s more analogous to an 
electronic life form than a computer virus.

Um... According to SM, the SDG boxes were designed first as transponders.  It 
was only later that a weapon was attempted to be made of them (originally 
they came out as TL-15, but TL-16 & 17 program to modify them into Virus).

Even so, transponder chatter was only the easiest method of infection, simply 
because it was "just add water" (there was already a cymbeline chip there, w/ 
direct access to the main comp).  Comp controlled (tight beam) commo, eggs, 
then blackmail, coersion, etc, and also "commando chips."

engineers, and two optional gunners.  Each ship has two hardpoints, but is 
shipped without turrets or weaponry to save money.

Cargo 320.  Fuel 8.  Crew 6. Passengers 0.

These boats take a down payment of 28.9 MCr, with payments of 602.083 
KCr/month.  Salaries & such kick expenses on the Chump up to 653.183 KCr 
total.  The Munchkin needs to spend 90KCr/jump for its drop tanks, or 
180KCr/month assuming 2 jumps per month, for a total of 833.183KCr.

Revenue from hauling freight is 2K/ton/month, or 480KCr for the Chump, 640KCr 
for the Munchkin, assuming full loads and 2 jumps per month.  The Chump has a 
net shortfall in revenues of 173.183 KCr/month, while the debt racks up to 
193.183/month on the Munchkin.

The extra 80 tons of freight don\'t offset the additional expense of buying 
drop tankage to allow the Munchkin to jump.  You lose 20KCr/month using them.  
Obvious conclusion is, you better have a good broker onboard with a 1 MCr 
stake to do speculative trade to make up the shortfalls, and hope to Elvis you 
don\'t misjump into empty space or you\'re dead.  I don\'t see the Munchkin-Class 
as a viable character ship.  Fact is, I don\'t see pure drop tank ships as 
viable at all, but that\'s just my opinion.

Assume 2 million tons of freight passing through the system per week.  You 
need 200KT of fuel to move those ships.  If you postulate that the same amount 
of tonnage leaves every single day, those ships will need 28,572 tons of fuel 
per day, or over 1000 tons of fuel per *hour*.  Thus, if you want enough fuel 
onhand for a day\'s business, you\'ll need at least 28.6K tons of fuel.

Safe jump distance from a large gas giant is about 10,000,000 klicks, per \'The 
Traveller Book\' (sorry, I\'ve misplaced my original set of LLBs).  Travel time 
from the orbit of a large gas giant at 1 g is 17.6 hours according to the 
table on Pg 54.

Assume a station of 28-30Ktons is on station at 10 million klicks.  Refueling 
it by hauling fuel out to it would be a logistical nightmare.  Assume 1 
station heading into close orbit of the gas giant to allow fuel skimmers to 
more quicky fill it up.  Assume a third station leaving close orbit enroute to 
take station at the 100 diameter jump limit.  That means 3 stations of over 
30Ktons displacement to handle the traffic.  Let\'s build them.

GN-P801142-000000-00000-0 7969MCr (yeah, that\'s right, 7.9 BILLION)
Crew 65.  Fuel 30000.  Cargo 0.  TL13.

You need 3 of these.  Stealing an idea from Steve Hudson, I designed these 
suckers out of 50KT asteroids.  They\'ve got 1 g accelleration & Power Plant-1. 
 It takes a 1000 ton bridge and a Computer/4 to handle one of these bloody 
things.  I didn\'t design in *any* hangers or small craft, but there *would* be 
several fuel skimmers around to feed the tankage.  For 1000 tons an hour of 
fueling, tankage on the skimmers would have to be on the order of 200 tons of 
payload.  For 1250 tons of fuel per hour (filling up the 30 KT of tankage in 
exactly 24 hours), you\'d need 6x8, or 48 skimmers.  I seem to recall seeing 
*someplace* that skimming takes 8 hours to accomplish, thus, 6 skimmers per 
hour for 8 hours.  The fuel load is purified on the way out to the jump limit.

The bill for 3 stations is on the order of 24 BILLION credits.  The skimmers, 
I dunno; it\'s 6 AM & I haven\'t bothered designing them yet.

3 50KT stations could handle 2 million tons per week.  Just add more fuel 
skimmers and stations to add capacity for throughput.  Are we having fun yet?

Heheh.  Actually, I stole the \'Mary Kay Commandos\' from Berke Breathed\'s 
\'Bloom County\', a comic strip that\'s sorely missed, IMNSFBHO.  And when I was 
doing fundraising for a few years, one of our contributers described herself 
as a Mary Kay Commando, complete with pink Caddy.  Just goes to show that 
truth is stranger than fiction.

Of course, I *still* maintain that I\'m stranger than truth...

IIRC, there needs to be a beginning population of 400 adults, split evenly
male/female and assuming polygamy, for a population to grow without a raft
of genetic defects rearing their ugly heads.

Just a wee question, whereabouts does it say (if anywhere) that the 3I can
utilise the military resources of member worlds in order to carry out a
military venture ?  If they can do so, how far can they go ?  That is, can
they say to a member "Ah, look, we\'ll just borrow a few thousand tons of
shipping and a corps or two of armor and have them all back to you in, say,
three months.  OK ?"

One would assume that they would, \'for the good of the Imperium\', but how
much of a systems\' military resources can the 3I requisition to conduct war ?

Not true, commo is far more sensitive to EMP than hardened control
circuitry.  You can not really harden commo in the same way you can closed
loop control systems.  Commo must have some input point for outside signals.
That point is the week point.  You can narrow the range of energy that can
come through that input point but even that circuitry has to be able to
handle the EMP surge.  If you cook the commo unit a tele controled suit will
loose control and become enert even if the servo systems are undamaged.  By
definition a suit with an open comm unit is more open to EMP.  The commo
curcuit is a break in the faraday cage that an EMP can enter.

A fundamental rule of cryptography is that you assume that the enemy
knows the algorithm behind your cypher. Trying to claim a `strong\'

Pseudo-reality check <grin>

200KT/week = 10MT/year 

           * 500Cr/ton for refined fuel

           = 5,000MCr/year

I think that ought to be able to pay for a few fueling stations.

Please adjust the figures for any error in my memory.

Before people start saying:

"there\'s *too much* trade in system X for fuelling stations to be viable"

Would they first consider how all the merchants were planning to refuel
without the fuelling stations. Personally, I reckon the large trade volumes
are done by big unstreamlined freighters operating out of the highport.

If this is true, someone has to get the fuel to the highport,
someone has to take the goods down to the planet.

Problems here!

1) How does the recieving system know how to unpack and reasemble the code?  

2)It it is in a standard format where is the anti virus software?  

3) Who tells the recieving unit that the assembled code is an executable?

4) What sane person would let unknown persons remote load a progam and
remote ececute it on their ships main computer?

5) Are there no computer security people in the traveller universe?

6) No hackers either?

7) No sysops that can set the operations perameter that says "Disable remote
ececution"?

8) Or set the "Run only from ROM disks" parameter?

9) The only way the the virus could reconfigure the computers circuitry is
if the circuitry was designed to be reconfigured during operation, like a
neural network.  A hard wired silicon system sealed inside it\'s chips would
be invunerable to this form of attack as it\'s pathways could not be changed.
The virus would have to gain direct physical contact with the silicon AND
have the necessary chemicals present in the atmosphere to re etch the
silicon.  This is stated explicitly in the adventure that introduced the
inteligent chips.

10) FIBs would be immune as well as their composition is as alien to the
chips as is our human biology.

11) On a military ship the crew would shitch to the FIB system when the main
system went flakey.  Isolating the virus.  End of problem.  A ship designed
to fight after recieving damage would have to have enough cut outs,
bypasses, and work arrounds to disable any faulty system including the main
computer.  One designed to fight in a nuclear enviroment would have heavy
shielded hard wired backups to all critical systems.  These would also be
immune to the virus as they would have to be EM shielded and EM is the
method of infection for the virus.

I personally love the idea of the virus.  It\'s a great villain.  It can
still be very deadly even with the logical limitaions that is should have.
It is smart and can be patient.  It can be even worse than discribed if
played that way even with the limitaions it suffers from.  I\'ve always
though the virus got a bum rap.  If properly thought out it could have been
the boogyman of traveller.  Instead of the grab control of everything and
kill story that was presented it could have been the \'ghost in the machine\'
that first infiltrated nearly everything before reaking havok.  This way it
could have taken secret control of the automated factories and wrote it\'s
code into systems as they were being built.  It would have been simplicity
itself to set a date say 5 years after it\'s first release for D-day.  The
sudden attack everywhere at teh same time would have been far more effective
than what happened in cannon and more believeable as well.

really dumb things done by players in Traveller (or other games, for that
matter.)

The setup: the characters are trying to rescue a kidnap victim on some
planet somewhere, and have traced the kidnappers to a remote cabin in
a large forest. One of the PCs had gotten a full suit of battle dress
as a mustering-out benefit, and had a plasma gun as an available weapon.
A few of the PCs stormed the front of the cabin while a couple of the 
others spirited the young victim away out the back. A firefight breaks
out (of course!) -- and the PC with the plasma gun fires it inside the
cabin. Since the cabin is a small, enclosed space, there was a bit of
backblast from the plasma as it was partially contained by the cabin
itself, enough to singe the PCs who were in the cabin with the one 
carrying the plasma gun. The shot also incinerated all of the bad guys,
effectively disintegrated the back half of the cabin... and set off a
major forest fire.

things done by players, post \'em here!

Correct. It is a species of pufferfish, which, when prepared correctly, is

Ah, but if jump performance depends on mass at the moment of entry to jump -
which it must, for drop tanks to work - then all ships have the same
advantage,
with drop tanks or internal fuel, because they\'re not taking their (burned)
fuel
into jump with them. Drop tank ships win a little more because of the mass
of the empty tanks, but that\'s small.

The downside of the "jump depends on mass" variant is that because
hydrogen masses so little, you could build ships with huge amounts of fuel
tankage that are capable of 2xjump-6, unless the fuel consumption was
carefully tweaked (even if fuel mass is counted before its burned...)

Making jump fuel depend on mass would also simplify ship design, in that
one could design a ship to a specific target mass rather than target volume.

I can\'t remember his name, but if I recall correctly the British Officer in charge of the Allied landing at Gallipoli (a thorough

Admiral Santanocheev would seem to fit the bill from traveller history (qv The Spinward Marches Campaign).

Also - in Traveller, at least, where lasers are better defined - you can argue
that lasers fired in an atmosphere have to have "streched" pulses (to avoid
having too high a peak power and ionizing the atmosphere.) This could
reduce penetration - I would play with all TNE/FFS2 lasers having a
penetration of 1 in atmospheres.

In both cases (GURPS anti-laser aerosols, and TNE reduced PEN) this
would help explain why plasma weapons are popular for tanks and
orbital fire support...

In the Real World (which is what I think the question was about), a decent-
aperture laser can have ranges in the hundreds of km - maybe thousands
if its working in the extreme ultraviolet (which of course doesn\'t work for
orbital bombardment much of the time.)

G:V laser rules are fairly handwaved/abstract.

That would fry the backup satellite comm system for sure.
Fortunately, the meson comm rig does not need an external

I, of course, do my own calculation and come to a somewhat different

In the end the wall was built at considerable expense (instant foam-crete,

  Isn\'t that how they spread? It certainly was for their Cymbeline ancestors -
the Virus era units have no physical irregulariites from the non-infected comp

  So Virus doesn\'t have a physical component IYTU? Doesn\'t that render it
vulnerable to techniques that TNE specifies somehow don\'t work?

  And they were apparently working on proto-Virus all along, and it never
occurred to them that such transponders could be used as Trojan Horses? And
yet it somehow worked out that they were fully backwards compatible?

  Lucans people ever intended it to spread autonomously via "commando chips"?!
Were they completely insane (note: "completely" - partial is assumed after
working for the Boy-Wonder-Emperor - and surviving! - for a few years)? Do
you mean blackmail & coercion by Vampires or Lucans agents?

  It solves the drop tank "problem"; some people may see this as being wrong.
OTOH, at this point I conclude that it would be something like the best idea.

  Very little (AFAIK) except that the "J-fuel is burned for power" school
returns
us with a vengeance to the "why are J-drives better power supplies than power
plants, and why do they require huge power plant inputs to operate" problem.

  If both ships are guaranteed to lose money then is their "efficiency"
really important? With the basic CT KCr 1.0 ton/jump (or x2 month?) these
ships don\'t
prosper; did you run the numbers for 30-35 trips/year, and/or partial carriage
of passengers. The price listed in undiscounted? As the stats listed above
indicate maximum revenue of 6% of unit price something is clearly wrong. Are
you assuming a modest premium for faster than J1 delivery?

  As indicated previously, disparities between vessel types are much more
pronounced at higher J#\'s.

  Even though all the components mentioned are armoured generously, you might
want to move a bit further out if GG orbital trash is an issue. FWIW, we will
likely want some smaller (1Kt?) specialized stations in closer; these will
handle the specialized little tugs that will boost up spare fuel rocks to begin
their cold, lonely journey to their new home. Assume that a 1Kt fuel-rock will
take 15 days to get to 15-20 gigameters, so the added cost per Dt/L-Hyd will
be over Cr 4, or possibly as low as 2.0-2.5; this should be cheaper than tugs.

  It\'s a shame that you don\'t play TCS for cash :)  Please keep in mind that a
large portion of these "ships" cost is their power plant - you should lose 20%
of their cost if you use a TL F design. You also lose <20% off the system if you
use multiples of a smaller design and get the series discount. I assume the 1G
drive is also to drive up price; "fix" all the above and cost is under BCr 3.5
per 50 Kt of stations.

  Oh, and all you really need is a smaller station full of maintenance/support/
admin people, and then the free floating tanks parked nearby MCr 0.9 Kt/L-Hyd.
Say a 20 Kt station, for a total cost (100 Kt/L-Hyd) of BCr 1.5 before skimmers.

...

  The little tank handlers - wherever based - will probably operate ~160 hours
a week as expensive capital items, so we also need five crew per flitter - one
maintenance guy and four small craft handlers (assumes 40 hours/week max.). A
purifier could be installed either at the GG or at the tanker platform - it does
depend on the demand for volatiles, as there should be a lot of by-products.

...
>> >   s\'OK, we\'ll make it a disc :)  Ornamental elephants optional

>3 50KT rocks.  24 billion credits thereabouts.

  As stated above, the cost is quite substantially lower if building of brick.
Possibly as high as BCr 3.0 before auxiliary craft. The biggest cost will be
the actual GG fuel skimmers; how did the hydrocarbon skimmers (?) from A:V
work out cost-wise?

        Cargo=196. Passengers=17. LHyd=550. EP=50. Agility=1. Low=0.

  Presumably such a ship is an evolution of the E-5 models that would\'ve been
prevalent well into the 1000\'s; by the latter half of the century these vessels
would be wearing out and replaced, mostly by more efficient F-5\'s but also by
the more capable (if exorbitantly costly) F-6\'s. MCr 565.5 standard.
 
  The ship carries three gunners for its rather excessive armaments load; one
each offensive, defensive, and dual-purpose battery directed by a Model/5 comp.
If high passengers are to be carried one cabin can be split to provide quarters
for two stewards; all passenger quarters are allocated at 4 Dt each.

  Mortgage payments run MCr 22.62/year for the type, and a load of express
cargo and high passengers at "normal" rates is MCr 12.46/year; thus, the
premium for J5 services must be on the order of +100%.

  If used, a drop tank version would carry up to 500 additional tons. At an
increased annual cost of MCr 17.5 (~+75%, ~MCr 42/pa total) the sellable
capacity now increases to 760 Dt (increase of 192%), allowing for annual
revenue of (10xHi, 10xMid, 632Dt) of MCr 32.2 base, or a needed premium of
30% - a reduction in J5 service costs of over a third!

 For the sake of dignity, no munchkinized welded-droptank version is listed.

(It\'s been a while since I\'ve done radioelectronics, so I don\'t remember if
this idea will actually work...)
What about a time-reset circuit-breaker, right on the antenna wire?  Surely
by TTL15 you can have a circuit breaker that will trip before the rest of
the system is damaged, and then reset itself, say, 30sec later. (or even
2sec.  AFAIK an EMP is close to being instantaneous...)

Are you assuming that the visitors are part of the family Reptilia that

The basic idea is Ok nevertheless as the visitors brain patterns probably

No, just put them in glass of Coca-Cola overnight. That dissolves them

Or you coulf use more complex exponential functions. The problems with all 
mathematical solutions (usually differential equations) are that factors 
like the birth rate, sustainable population etc varies over time in RL(TM). 
Another feature of RL(TM) is that differential equations of this type seldom 
can be solved (y(t) = a(t)y(t) + b(t)y(t)^2).

It\'s a psionic power in TNE that allows one to manipu-
late a computer with your mind.

Recovery of psi-points BTW is 2 per hour of rest and 6
per hour of sleep as defined in the wilderness explor-
ation section of TNE.

Unknown.  Anti-virus software (which is said in Survival Margin to actually 
be strains Virus itself, by the time of the Collapse) is still coded and 
"made" by people outside of the system, whereas Virus itself is actually 
inside the system and runs circles around it (if not coopting it to it\'s own 
usage).  There is an electronic combat system in Vampire Fleets for them to 
duel.

> 3) Who tells the recieving unit that the assembled code is an executable?

It\'s not an "executable."  Stop thinking in TL8 (GTL7) terms.  Say that 
computers don\'t operate like anything you\'re familiar with.  For one, they 
have organic cores, and I doubt you have experience w/ them.

Noone did it voluntarily or even finding out till many months later.  
Transponder (which consists of two lobotimized cymbeline predators) chatter 
(w/ direct access to commo and computers) was the primary vector of 
transmission.  Virus is not a "program."  It\'s a life form that lives in 
electronics.  The next vector was computer controlled tight beam commo 
(accuracies measured in attoradians, doppler shift correction, encoding and 
decoding, etc).

> 5) Are there no computer security people in the traveller universe?

Sure, but they\'re at an inherent disadvantage operating outside of their own 
evironment against a life form in it\'s own.  Especially when they don\'t know 
it\'s there and find they have no computer references to viruses or combating 
them (the first thing Virus would do is delete or corrupt such information).  
This is in the "dormant" phase.

See above.  :-)

Nope.  Get out of your GTL7 rut.  ;-)

TL12+ involves self programming, according to MT Ref\'s Comp.
Virus is TL16-17.  You can make a case that TL11- ships should be safe from 
Virus.  It\'s TL10-, as stated in TNE.  I\'d be fine w/ that, as the TL-15 IN 
is still going to be completely infected.

It\'s not being done ala the method of the Cymbeline predator.  Low tech level 
computers would be just as you say.  TNE says they\'re limited to "eggs" which 
behave just like "normal" computer viruses.

Only for the low tech computers.  The rest operates the same (synaptics, self

That\'s *exactly* how it happened.  The infiltration was done for *months* 
while the Virus was reproducing like mad.  It developed so fast initially 
because it was inserted directly into Dulinor\'s flagship\'s main computer, 
because he thought he had "weapons data" from one of Lucan\'s Black War 
projects and wanted to analyize it.  From there, it immediately deleted all 
references to computer viruses and how to combat them and proceeded to spread 
though his entire fleet.  Lucan\'s fleet likewise was infected as they 
intercepted the transmissions.  In any case, they all had SDG transponders 
(w/ a mute) htat made further infection (and reinfection) easy.  The Collapse 
wasn\'t for many months afterwards, after they had further spread to starports 
control towers (w/ their own transponder), merchant traffic (ditto), etc, in 
teh Safe\'s (as Dulinor\'s messangers went back to Ilelish, Lucan\'s back to 
Capital, etc).

Um... that\'s exactly how it happened.  Reread Survival Margin, please.  What 
you describe matches exactly Survival Margin pg 74 and 75.  I don\'t know what 
"cannon" you\'ve been reading...

It\'s hardly established in canon, though implied and *assumed* by more than a 
few.  Of course, I say they\'re wrong.  :-)  Basically it involves 
interpretations from the drop tank rules and something else IIRC.  Basically 
if you simply require that a ship has to have substantial internal tankage 
ala the S9: Gazelle, even the "burn & jump" doesn\'t hurt DTs.  The main issue 
has been around the economics ala the title of this thread.  :-)

Mmm... i\'d say more people putting their detailed spin on jump rather than 
patching.  It was originally (and still is, officially) vague enough to 
accomidate many of them.  The only outright abominations are DGPs (SoM) and 
FFS2\'s.

I basically said just that when this thread really got rolling (a month or 
two back).

No.  It\'s an electronic life form that lives in the computer, like a fish 
lives in water.  "Commando chips" that behave exactly like the Cymbeline 
predator could be created to deal w/ "closed" systems, though.  That or 
destruction, though Virus always desires to reproduce (and all the unstable 
strains quickly go the way of the dodo).

Huh?  What techniques?  There is a physical componet, but it\'s only a "host." 
 Of course, it can\'t be disembodied, but can move from one host to another 
(or better yet reproduce and occupy both).

Reference "point identity" and "meta identity" from the Regency Sourcebook, 
if you have it.  If you don\'t, the library data it\'s avaiable from 
ftp://ftp.davtechsys.com in any of the "Planet III" sectors.

It directly occured to them.  It was sometime in 1097-1098 that the first 
work was ordered, but not till Lucan was it completed (or possibly even given 
a real impetus).

> yet it somehow worked out that they were fully backwards compatible?

Only as far as the technology was viable.  Some argue it\'s not, but they\'re 
wrong. :-)
The transponder is a ready made Virus box.  It just needs something to 
inhabit it.  This assumes the comps are standardized (and Survival Margin 
states that Imperial ones were... in "Imperial Data Packages" pg 74) and 
exactly how they work, of course.

No.  That was Virus.  The only *intended* method of infection was via 
transponder.  Virus came up w/ the others on its own, though it was designed 
to simply take over the enemy system then suicide the comp system, making for 
a bloodless capture.

By Vampires against crews that wouldn\'t cooperate is what I meant, though you 
know Lucan.  ;-)

I agree. I always thought of drop tank freighters as VERY large, very

big (multi-kiloton) ship, but I could see major players like Tukera using

        Cargo=72. Passengers=17. LHyd=660. EP=60. Agility=1. Low=0.

  Here\'s where technophilia reaches its logical conclusion - a design willing
to batter itself into unconsciousness against the bleeding edge of the current
TL performance envelope. In addition to costing more and carrying only half the
load of the F5 this type would require the total restructuring of the technical
and customer bases of the company to use its increased range. A single powerful
laser battery comprises the ships armament. If high passengers are to be carried
one cabin can be split to provide quarters for two stewards; all passenger
quarters are allocated at 4 Dt each, although even High passage may require a
breakdown to 2 Dt standards at the needed prices. MCr 641.5 standard.

  Mortgage runs at MCr 25.66/year for the type, and a load of express cargo
and high passengers at normal rates is MCr 8.12/year; the J6 premium of +220%
also means that the marginal price increase over J5 service is at least 60%!

  If used, a drop tank version would carry up to 600 additional tons. At
an increased annual cost of MCr 21 (~+82%, ~MCr 48/a. total) the sellable
capacity now increases to 736 Dt from 136 Dt (increase of 441%!), allowing
annual revenue of (16xHi, 16xMid, 608Dt) of MCr 31.36, or a needed premium
of ~50%. Not only is this only higher by a sixth than the cost of drop J5,
but it\'s a reduction over the cost of normal J6 by more than half!

  If JumpExpressCo is in fact a subsidiary of Al Morai as some observers
speculate (admittedly, others suggest that it\'s wholly imaginary; we\'ll
ignore the ones who insist that we can\'t really be sure that the universe
or its observers exist either) then Operations will be sorely tempted to
insert an elite squad of dingo dogs to terminate the F6 project team.
Unless drop tanks are allowed to function per HG2/TCS, of course, in which
case it\'s been happening this way for years, and we just never noticed.

Hmmm....you might want more females than males if you want to have
polygamy <g>
(or vice versa for polyandry). Otherwise you have to share wives with
other husbands (dunno what that would be called... polygandry
p\'raps...) etc. or only have monogamy.

400 adult sophonts....say 100m and 300f....would probably suffice for
genetic diversity, IIRC the low estimate for Homo Sapiens occupying
the whole world outside of Africa requires a breeding population of
only  c1000 leaving Africa c.50-100000 BP (known as the Out of Africa
II theory).

        Cargo=72.  Passengers=17. LHyd=660. EP=60. Agility=1. Low=0. Crew=8.

  Calculations are approximate - maintenance at 0.1%, wages, life support, 
and fuel are ignored below. Cargo charge is low, as some portion of revenue
is from passage charged at a similar premium.
 Unit  Mortgage/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge
  F-5   MCr 22.62      MCr 12.46      >82%     > Cr 1,820
  F-6   MCr 25.66      MCr  8.12     >216%     > Cr 3,160

  Note that the cost of operating a J6 unit - quite aside from the cost
of setting up new routes using the J6 range - means that the cost for
space aboard such a ship is roughly double that of a Jump 5 ship.

DROP TANKS - includes cost of _disposable_ tanks in operating cost (& mortgage):
 Unit  Ops. Cost/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge
  F-5   MCr 40.12      MCr 32.20      >25%     > Cr 1,250
  F-6   MCr 46.66      MCr 31.36      >49%     > Cr 1,490

  Considering that the non-drop-tank costs are pretty much unable to be
reduced further, it should also be considered the re-use of drop tanks
in any way will further reduce the costs of D-tank express service. For
example, if tanks are recovered from standing Jumps (de facto from 100-D
service stations) and checked/refurbished at a cost of KCr 0.5/Dt - a 
savings of 50%, and more than reasonable if they\'re not physically wrecked
by usage then the following values apply;

DROP TANKS - 50% cost recovery of tanks:
 Unit  Ops. Cost/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge
  F-5   MCr 31.37      MCr 32.20      = 0%     ~ Cr 1,000
  F-6   MCr 36.16      MCr 31.36      >16%     > Cr 1,160

  At this point either the whole cost structure of lower J#\'s has to be re-
worked, or the simple fact must be accepted that J6 transport is no longer
much more expensive than any other service, allowing a modest premium for
the faster service.

Been there, done this, several times.

Laser carbines in the starport tank farm, (groan!) 

Lasers in a public forest in high summer.  The smugglers were smart enough
to use slug throwers and disable the parties air raft with a RAM grenade
(burned several nearby towns)  The PC spent the rest of the game trying to
survive the fire and get off planet before someone figured out who started
the fire.

The group\'s wizard used fireballs on the bandits in the woods...

The group\'s \'demolitions expert\' (skill-0) used 5 pounds of C4 to \'open\' a
wall safe...

Some bright player decided to spike a fusion cannon...

Another bright PC decides the best diversion is to crash the city\'s central
municipal computer.  The one that controled everything including all the
trafic lights.  They got \'diverted\' in traffic for 4 hours...

Some bright PCs decided the best way to cover their tracks in a jail break
was to release all the prisoners so no one could tell exactly who they were
breaking out... of a high pop. planet\'s only violent offenders prison.  I
told them the prison was huge and crowded!  Can you say instant Amber zone?!

One PC in AD&D uses a wand of wonder on a gelatinous cube coming through the
only door in the room.  He roled on the effects table and got \'turn target
to stone\'.  The entire party died of suffication.

I broke one group of AD&D players from being to greedy with one deck of many
things.  For those who don\'t know these items they can be thought of as a
standard deck of playing card with the black cards doing bad things and the
red cards good things.  You can choose to draw up to 4 times but you must
decide before you draw how many cards you will draw.  I had made an actual
deck for them to draw from.  That one deck killed the entire party.  There
are two instant kill no save black cards and several other cards that are
near garanteed death cards.  They knew this before they started though.
After that those player\'s burned any deck of magical cards they found JIC...
Most of my old AD&D players knew better that to draw from \'THE DECK\'.  The
odds are exactly 50/50 good/bad and it is pure luck.  There is no way to
"Stack the deck."

Another interesting thing happen once with this item.  A PC stuck with a
deadly cursed sword insisted on drawing the maximum draws from such a deck.
His second draw was \'Talons, Loose all posessions including the deck\'.  He
just grined at me and said \'Bye Bye sword!\'.  He wanted the card that gave
wishes to wish that sword away but beggers can be choosers.  I reminded him
that clothes were posessions though...

Anybody else have some stupid PC tricks?

Ouch, good point.  You got me there.  You\'d need an area effect meson burst
that would kill the suits as well as the comm and pretty much anything else
in the area.  Not a very \'cheep\' kill.

Interesting though, meson comms may be the only comm system that would be
EMP proof.  Could be a very good reason they are so popular.

Why in god\'s green didn\'t they use kerocene or gasoline?  One flare gun

Unfortunately, penguins dislike being thrown (or launched) and the result
of your plan would be a horde of electrically-charged killer penguins
stampeding across the battlefield to get their revenge.

  So IYTU a Virus-infected computer is completely identical (on the gross
physical level) to the unit pre-Virus? No mods to architecture occur?

  If Virus is purely dynamic and doesn\'t physically alter its host then how
can it survive the equivalent of a shut-down and reboot from CD or other
non-dynamic media? How can they physically alter their victims to leave "eggs"?
Why would you even need SDG transponders as "a ready made Virus box"?

  FWIW, I suspect that one of us is mis-remembering Virus\' need for physical
modifications to be made in non-SDG systems.

I was always under the impression from reading the source material that the
lifeform *was* part of the system.  Not some free roaming spirit like a
fish in water.  If the chip has a hard connection to the board, how can it
move?

I have yet to find an argument or explanation to dissuade me from my
initial impression of Virus:  That it was nothing more than writers way to
kill off one of the most popular settings so yet another new set of rules
would be required for the new version of the setting.

All IMO.

Nope.  I dug it up.  Its Armor Holdings, Inc., which in turn has a
family of companies, American Body Armor being the one I
was thinking of.  It trades on the NYSE as ABE.

This company looks like the prefect model for a non-Mega Corp.

This is a common misunderstanding of fair use.  There is no certain
percentage that may be copied.  The Fair Use doctrine applies to
anything that qualifies for software protection, including software.
The doctrine, in US law, has a list of factors that courts use to
determine when one has made a fair or unfair use.  No single
factor is determinative.  Its important to remember that its also
a US doctrine, although other countries have similar principles,
they aren\'t identical.  There are judicial opinions in copyright
cases which state that copying just the Table of Contents of a
book can (but may not always be) copyright infringement.
A US court wouldn\'t go that far, at least not for a book already
published.

Yes.  But thats with permission.  Thats a license to make one copy
in certain circumstances.

I lurked there for a while because the chairman of the board of
trustees at my law school\'s university represented the \'Church\' of
Scientology in some cases in which some of their secret documents
had been posted to the web, and I was curious because I thought
some of their legal practices were questionable.

I stopped when it got way too weird.  But the more I did see,
the clearer to me it was that Hubbard was just ripping off
and distorting Van Vogt and Korzybski and throwing in a
few hallucinogen-induced thoughts for good measure.

All the more reason why we need gravitics to mass produce the stuff.

Another alternative suggests itself : packing nanofibre  \'sponge\' with hydrogen molecules. 
We are just trying to get as much hydrogen into as small a volume as possible, yes?

- - gelling
- - cryogenic lattices (atomic hydrogen in helium?)
- - nanofibre sponge
- - metallic hydrogen
- - gravitic confinement systems..?

Questions :-
Are there any alternate liquid phases of hydrogen known?
Would induction of a superfluid state (Bose-Einstein condensate) help attack the problem??

Tying jump fuel requirements to mass in a relatively simple way in ship design is more difficult than it appears in the first instance!

No you\'re right.  I was thinking you were saying that there needed to be a 
specific type of computer, to be infectable, rather than the modifications 
Virus will do to a computer once it\'s in.  Virus does alter the hardware it\'s 
on, once it\'s already in.  The first thing it does is build itself a "hidey 
hole" where it can go in case of a shutdown or power loss.  They can also 
"firewall" against an invading strain.

You\'re right on that.  I thought you were going somewhere else rather than

Just as the easiest vector of infection.  Possibly through peripheral systems

Not misremembering, but I was misinterpreting where you were going.  I

The SDG is just the transponder, after all.

It can\'t be disembodied, as I said in teh following paragraph, but it can 
either move to another body or just reproduce (clone) itself to another (w/ 
the variations from the new system creating a new personality), though as 
Sandman did in Vampire Fleets, he can "move" to a new system and leave the 
old body empty (deletes himself after he moves or something, i dunno...).

From their own mouths (in a Challenge editorial, 77 IIRC), they said they 
wanted to get away from the Rebellion, w/o having a "winner."  The only 
survivor was a non faction, Deneb.  As far as rules sets, it\'s obvious they 
wouldn\'t have wanted to keep DGPs and to go to their own (T2k was outselling 
MT big time, too).  Also to advance the setting and to make it more able to 
adventure w/o having to watch for the Imperial "Fun Police" or the chaos of 
the Rebellion and to open the setting to what seems to have been the goal of 
MT:  To break up the one gigantic Imperium into a bunch of smaller ones.

Executable and non executable must be flaged in ANY system.  It comes down

That is a load of CRAP! for several reasons.  

First, an instruction runs at a fixed rate determined by the clock rate of
the exectuting system.  The viruses instruction are no different that those
of the system itself.  They run at the same speed because it is the system
that set the instruction list.  That is why you have to recompile programs
for different platforms.  The instruction sets are fixed by the command
processors.

Second, inorder for the virsus to become executable it would have to be
flaged as an execuable.  Any security system will moniter the executables
list for that very reason.  As long as the virus is data it is in supended
animation and can take no action.

Third, programs today are being assembled by smart compilers that optomise
the code for the system they were design to run on.  These compilers have
millions of hours of experience in compiling to these systems.  I find it
hard to believe that the virus with little or no experience with the systems
being attacked can match purpose built optomising compilers.

That is strawman crap.  There will always be a delineation between data and
code.  Unless you can explain how to \'execute\' the Encyclopedea Britannica!
That may sound odd to you but it is a real question.  Executables must be in
the proper format or the precesser will not run them.  Even something like a
human beings mind has the differentiation between memory and instruction code.

Just out of curiousity, fow much assebly code have you written?  If you have
not written any then most of what I have just said will not make anty sence
to you.  The fact is processors MUST have their instruction fed to them in
the exactly correct format or they will error out into an error handling
system (if they do not crash or hang.)

They had to!  As long as the virus was \'data\' it was inactive.  To run, it
had to be executed.  Basic security procedures would not allow an unlisted
and unverified executable run on a military system.

NOT RELAVENT.  If it is the \'chip lifeform\' it must have physical contact
and the proper enviroment to overwrite the circuits.  If it come over the
comm it is a program that must run to realign the neural network to have the
same effect.  If it must run it has to be seen by the system as an
executable file.  That means the code inside that file must be error free
for the system that it is to run on, have executable status, and on a secure
system it must be on the run list with the correct check sum or CRC as a
minimum.  If I were the Sysop, I would require that it also be in ROM
storage and that it be run fron that ROM storage or if it were a learning
program then it would have to have an unbroken evolution history back to the
ROM version that is in storage and pass a history profile checksum and/or CRC.

And any secure system worth the name would detect the change with it\'s next
CRC pass and set off alarms.

As for the programers being \'out of their enviroment\', yes and no.  Even
with just a consol the only diference is the speed scale and the person has
the advantage of haveing all the technical data on the system.  The virus is
in a strage new enviroment it\'s self.  With a neural jack and military ICE
the programer is ready for WAR!

And the FIB will load all it\'s programs from it\'s own ROM to start with and
procude it\'s own operation history files to act as it\'s security system.  It
is also likely a back up system that has only the eccential programs.  It is
unlikely to run adatpive software due to their inherantly greater likelyhood
of coruptions.  IT is you last ditch fallback system after all.

IT\'S THE EMERGENCY BACK UP!  Of course it will be as fail safe and protected
as it can be.  Why would you have a back up system that is just as likely to
be on the fritz as the main system?  BAck ups usually are simpler and more
rugged than the main system.  They have less functionallity so their is less
to go wrong and they have hard coded ROM backups of their software just in
case something requires a hard reset and system purge.  I would never use a
hardware adaptive system as a last backup.  You might as well put a sign
\'crash bait\' on the ship.  Or are you suggesting the IQ will drop sharply in
the engineering fields in the future?  I would be very surprised if a
military ship did not have a system that would let the ship be operated
without any computers as a final backup.  That system might be very limited
but all it would have to do is get the crew home alive.

I read that and that was not what I was refering to.  I ment that the virus
did not infiltrate far enough into sociaty to strike a death blow.  It
showed it\'s hand to early.  It stared killing ships with two weeks, IIRC.

I did, that is not how it is documented.  It jumped mainly through the comm
system ant that is where I have the problem.  I\'m not saying that a \'seed\'
could not be past imbeded in some program that would in time infect
thousands of systems.  I\'m saying the what is atributed to the virus is not
the pattern that such a weapon would take.  The infection was first to fast
and second not pervasive enough.  There was never an explaination of how it
got arround the security systems.  There are hundred of small mistakes that
just add up to incansistances that make the virus as is unbelieveable.

Let\'s take a look at the cultural background here.  How many of these guys

I\'m thinking of getting my Twilight: 2000 set out, and hitting all the
targets listed therein.  Already took out the Exxon refinery here in
Baton Rouge.  With the 1 MT surface burst, my apartment survives rather
well (between the 2 psi and 1 psi rings).  With the 25 MT air burst,
most of Baton Rouge is inside the 5 psi ring.

I posted an analysis under GT where a minor system had to have a
ship waiting around at the port, follow it out to the jump
point, give it fuel, and come back.  In such a case if you
got more than about a couple of Free Traders a week, you came
out ahead.  As volume increases, you get economies of scale and
can start doing things like just "throwing" large chunks of ice
in from the out system and "catching" them at the 100 diam limit
of the main world.

You are assuming that drop tanks aren\'t reusuable? Also, it doesn\'t make
sense for a fuel tank in a ship to cost nothing but for it to
suddenly be so expensive on its own.

OK, my analysis under GT that I posted a few weeks back was vastly
different.  One reason may be the use of non-reusable drop tanks.
That is one of the problems that many of us have.  There isn\'t any reason
why this should be true.  The other is it that the cost of fuel tanks is
treated as zero when they are removed from the drop-tank ship, but not when
the cost of the frop tanks is computed.  Then you need to spread the cost
over all the ship using them.

See my post on or about 4/29 for a look at this under GT....

My Cr 0.02 :-

Entry into jump space requires the expenditure of large amounts of energy. This is provided by nuclear fusion at typical Imperial Tech Levels. Antimatter and quantum vacuum energy look like alternative sources (speculative at TL 15!).

With the initial burst of energy (the \'induction phase\'), a controlled distortion in space-time is generated within the jump drive ; this is propagated by the jump grid which covers the surface of a starship. The range of the distortion is relatively small, and \'fuzzy\' around the edges ; virtual particles are forced to become real at the interface of the nascent jump field.
This \'edge bleeding\' effect means a continued power input is necessarry to maintain the stability of the distortion.

At a certain energy threshold, the contents of the distortion are precipitated into jump space. *Further energy and reaction mass need to be expended to maintain the stability of the bubble of \'normal\' space containing the starship.* This is sometimes referred to as the \'maintenance phase\'.

To travel further requires access to more tightly woven jump space dimensions, and thus more energy.

<homer s.>
Mmm... induction and maintenance. 
</homer s.>

The concept has some appeal to a simple critical care doc like me....

Actually, getting yourself killed with farm machinery is rather

professions, in terms of per-worker death and injury.

Oooohhh that reminds me. A long time ago (on the order of 25-30 years,
IIRC) some migrant farm workers died of some unknown cause on a major
farm here in arizona. All sorts of hooferaw, as it was pretty quickly
discovered that the fields had just been sprayed with toxic
insecticides, and the farm in question belonged to the Goldwater family
(yes _that_ Goldwater).

Speculation and lurid headlines about the evil land barons spraying
poison on the migrant laborers appeared, until the autopsy revealed that
they had cooked about a pound of a wild tobacco that they found growing
in the ditch, thinking it was an edible green, and ate it with dinner.

Instant heart attacks. The chemist who did the analysis on their meal
said they had some 50-100 times the lethal dose per serving.

Drop tanks are cheaper than internal tankage. The cost of the internal
tankage is the cost of that portion of the hull that they fill out. To
convince yourself of that, simply design two ships: one with internal
tankage and the same ship with no internal tankage and the equivalent
drop tank tankage.

1.  Nope.  2.  Not yet.  And besides, the ships are optimised for *freight* 
with no passenger space availiable.  3.  Correct.  The prices are for the lead 
boat of the class.  4.  Huh?

I take that to mean, "it\'s a good way to go broke faster if you wanna slice open your checking account\'s jugular vein and squeeze."

The only way I could see them as being profitable is if you\'re doing a lotta 
spec trading and can con your reff into allowing you to buy 1xWorldSize or 
1xPop lots of stuff off the old CT spec trade tables with a good broker.  This 
ain\'t legal per CT; the rule is *1* lot per week regardless, and it\'s assumed 
to be the *best* deal the characters can find.

I heard an apocryphal reference once that claimed Hubbard said that the only way to make and *KEEP* a million dollars in the U.S. was to start your own religion.  Don\'t have a cite for it tho, so consider it Class 4 intel, ok?

ObTrav:  What kinds of religions exist IYTU that \'most\' locals think are just a fast scam?  What religions IYTU are considered to be \'real religions\'?  IMTU, the Solomani Catholic Church, both branches (Orthodox & Sylean), are thriving propositions.  The major point of contention seems to be whether or not St Elvis did or did not shoot Nixon.  Another popular church in Reavers\' Deep is something I swiped directly from Andy Keith -- the Church of the Future Man, straight outta his \'Rescue on Galatea\'.

In a PBEM that I play in (Hi, Roger!!), my character is a lapsed Solomani Catholic with the name of Romli Issak Elvis Hamlin, the \'Elvis\' being of course St Elvis of Terra.  One of the people he has to deal with on a daily basis is one Father Ivan, a priest of the Order of St. Michael.  <grin>

From _Guns of the South_ (from memory), President Lee speaking with his
military aide:

Lee:  "If the Army of Northern Virginia campaigned in as dilatory a
manner as the Senate deliberates, AK-47s would not have sufficed to win
our independence."

Aide:  "If the army of Northern Virginia campaigned in as dilatory a
manner as the Senate deliberates, it would have been McClellan\'s Army of
the Potomac instead."

    Nope, always over estimated his enemy.  Meade was a slow assed bastard.
Only Grant, Sherman, & Sheriden could fight Lee on somewhat equal terms.
But each one was called a drunk or a madman by his peers.
    Hooker could also fight, when he was not with one of Hooker\'s.

Under CT rules, the drop tanks are used and ditched.  That\'s why they\'re 
*called* drop tanks.  They don\'t get reused, they float off into space / get 
pulled into the jump bubble / whatever, but the point is, they *can\'t* get 
reused cause they\'re *gone*.   And the price of the internal tankage is taken 
into account with the cost of the hull under CT.  Effectively, it\'s zero, 
because the 100KCr/ton of the ship is the bracing, etc that a ship needs to 
survive Jump space, et. al.

That\'s cause you use GT.  I don\'t.

OK, lemme try this again.  Internal tankage is already prefigured in when you 
design a hull.  It\'s part of the 100KCr/ton that the hull costs.  Drop tanks 
ain\'t part of the hull, so they\'re extra.  HG2 says they\'re 10KCr *plus* 
1KCr/ton of fuel carried.  And you still gotta buy the fuel; these suckers are 
shipped *dry*.  You recompute performance *only* if you attempt to jump with 
the drop tanks attached.  This is because the ship now has a bigger 
displacement than it would without.  Got it?

You\'re gonna throw ice chunks out at a ship at the 100 diameter limit.  OK, 
the ice is moving.  It\'s a *BIG* chunk.  So the target ship has to match 
vectors with the chunk.  Too slow, and it takes too long for the chunk to get 
there and you have to schedule the toss a couple weeks in advance.  Too fast, 
and the ship has to waste time chasing and catching the ice chunk, or be out 
of fuel.  Ever calculate the energy of a 2000 ton snowball barrelling in at 
35km/sec?  And btw, IMSC, that\'s the amount of energy you have to apply to 
that 2000 ton snowball to bring it to a dead stop as well.  You miss your 
target, something is gonna go *SPLAT*.  Not good on a resume\'.

IIRC, the figure is on the order of 100Cr/ton to & from the high port.  Can\'t 
remember for the life of me where I saw this though.

This is goanna sound *remarkably* unhelpful.

There is a website out there, somewhere among the terabytes of web data,
that lets you punch in hydrographics and some other data, and it does a
fractal map of the world.

I had it bookmarked at work, and then lost all my bookmarks when they
\'upgraded\' us to Win98.

I can vaguely remember a link to it from the THUDDD site.

Can anyone else help ?

The other option (for earthlike worlds) is to play Civ II for a bit, and
then switch to God mode.

With an Imperial Warrant, the answer is Yes.

In practice, things will work slightly differently - they will presumably
not strip worlds of defenses and commercial shipping, as the 3I\'s wars tend
to last for some time, and production within the war is a signifigant part
of the effort.

You also dont want to piss off planetary governments too much for fear they
will surrender to the enemy rather than try and last out a sustained siege.

Payments for services rendered could also be a carrot - you pay for the few
thousand tons of shipping in cash, at War charter rates, and give the world
a 3 year tax holiday and some newly-minted Imperial Bonds in exchange for
the armour.

I pretty much agree.  The "drop tank" problem and the "why don\'t
you use jump-drive for power" preoblem are tightly linked.  All
the schemes for alternate uses of fuel are designed to get around
this problem.

I\'m partial to the idea that to burn all that fuel
you need to do it while you are actually jumping (it act as a
heat sink, otherwise the power plant just melts down).  This
diverges the least from what appears to be the original vision
of what happens and so fits better with other effects (why lanthanum
grids/coils are important, why there is an energy signature, how
jump projectors work at higher TL\'s, etc.)

Other approaches (displacement mass, cooling, the one Kurtis mentions,
etc.) all also address the problem though (IMO) don\'t fit quite as
well with some of the other effects.

Well, then the ship without internal tanks should have been cheaper.

There is a program that I found in RPG Host\'s Archives that actually generates an animated gif based on world data that you supply. Its damn cool for making globles.

There is a lot more there too! Check it out:

They are "dropped".  The point of a jump station is that they
next ship comes along an reuses them.  You are assuming that
a ship has to buy them outright and loose them.

(Though it was interesting to see Steve\'s analysis with
high jump ships.  He was a bit terse, but it seems that
even if you do expend them, you can come put ahead).

  And the price of the internal tankage is taken

The point here is where have the numbers for the cost of drop
tanks come from.  Sure you can post them arbitrarily high
just to make sure they are expensive, but that is just as
hard to swollow.

Well, it is true that all I\'m interested in are the problems
they cause for GT.  If SJG\'s fixes them for GT I really don\'t
care if they are broken for other versions :-).

But why?  This number seems to come out of the ether with no justification.

Suppose you make the ship small rather than add cargo when you take
out the internal tanks.  The cost savings from the internal tanks
should be comparable to the cost of the drop tanks (not even counting
the drop in jump drive costs).  When you then note that larger ships
are just as cost effective as smaller (if not more so) it just doesn\'t
make sense.

If he was doing at least 75 miles an hour (not a problem for combat

I\'m not talking about the "ship" catching it.  I\'m saying for
high traffic stations (and note: we are looking at why drop
tanks would be even cheaper at high volumes, if you don\'t buy
this, the previous issues remain) have ways.  At TL 15 stopping
a chunk of ice isn\'t that big a deal.  It could have thrusters
strapped on it and slows down as it gets close.

Far Trader lists fuel prices as being being 100Cr/ton higher
at the 100 diam limit.  This presumably is for fairly high
traffic systems.

There is one in the Rebellion Sourcebook.  Habitable worlds (atmos 5,6,8)
of TTL 9-13 have  10 - 15 battalions per million population.  Divide that
by 10 for non-habitable worlds.  Personally, I think this is a bit high for
worlds in the Imperium, unless they are on the border, balkanized, or need
a security force to keep their own citizens in check.

In one game I was in, we had one player who always insisted on being a 
gunbunny.  During the course of our adventures he got shot up pretty bad, 
and decided to go for cyberware.  Well he didn\'t have enough money to get 
all the armor and stuff that he wanted, so the rest of the party all 
chipped in.  For the next few adventures (until he was finally killed), 
whenever we got in a fight, the bad guys always targeted him (our whole 
"aim"), while us normals took out the bad guys.

The next character he came up with was an assassin that had Jaunting 
(teleportation over parsecs).  On his first or second adventure with this 
character he killed somebody on one planet, and to avoid the authorities, 
he jaunted back to the last planet we were on and into the hotel room that 
he had used.  Ordinarily this would have been the perfect thing for this 
character to do, _IF_ he had paid for the room for several weeks in 
advance.  Unfortunately, he jumped into the room, surprising both the 
occupants and himself.  While dealing with his disorientation, he proceeded 
to get blown away.

	As a matter of fact, yes.     He had basically popped up over a hill 
behind which he had been hiding, moved slowly forward and dropped the bomb.  
He had waited until the laser was trying to shoot at some infantry and then 
popped up moved and dropped, figuring there was no other AA assests in the 
enemy force and he would be safe once the laser was gone.

In answer to your last question:  All.
In answer to your first question:  I don\'t think it\'s explicitly stated
in canon, but it certainly makes sense, in light of what we know about
the Imperium, to expect that part of the price of membership is Imperial
utilization of your military and other resources if necessary.  The
benefit you\'re getting, after all, is that you don\'t have to learn
telepathy or stop eating beef.

I\'d be careful about making admissions like that ("I tried this many

Well, since AD&D has been brought up, here\'s two:

The mage letting off a shocking grasp (electric attack - travels through
conductors) in an all-steel vault....


In one adventure I ran, the PCs needed to investigate a general goods store
that had underworld connections.  Naturally, a certain amount of boobytraps
are do be expected.  After much deliberation, the PCs settled on breaking
down the front door.  The two warriors knocked it down in one pass, only to
be hit by a pair of crossbows mounted on the ceiling and set to the door.
After searching the front room, they decided to investigate the back room.
Again, they broke down the locked door, and, you guessed it, got hit by two
more crossbow bolts.  So the PCs learned their lesson.  In the back room
they spent about 2 hours (in game) carefully opening the 35 chests and two
wardrobes with ropes, poles, and hooks.  None of them were trapped.  None
of them had anything interesting.  Finally, they discovered a trapdoor in
the bottom of one of the wardrobes.  Which they opened, promptly setting
off a fireball trap.   Those 2 traps were written in before the session, I
didn\'t make them up on the fly... :)

Sorry for the OT, but it is amusing...

<snip more along the same lines>

TL will change it.  Just like I don\'t expect to be able to understand how
jump drives, contragravity, and reactionless thrusters work, I don\'t expect
to understand how GTL12  (or for that matter GTL9) computers work.  They
might be neural net, they might be biological, or they might be something
entirely different.  

There probably will be a difference between data and code, but even that\'s
not certain.  I am sure that things like assembly level instructions,
optimizing compilers, and clock cycles will no longer exist.  I don\'t know
what will, but it\'s going to be _totally_ different.  At best, using a
computer will be similar, but even that\'s not certain.  The point is, more
than two GTLs into the future, we can\'t be certain about _any_ assumptions.
 If things happen to work the same, fine, great, we can use out
perceptions.  However, if it\'s not the same, all we can go by is the
description of the _effect_ that is in the rulebook.  So if TNE says that
virus can infect computers in certain ways, then it can.  Period.  

Of course, in YTU, maybe GTL12 computers are just faster GTL7 computers,
and in that case you are right.  However, nothing I\'ve seen in the OTU
leads me to believe this is true.  

BTW, I have written plenty of assembly code, and I understand what you say.
 It\'s absolutely true for any computer that works the same way as a GTL7
computer.  But that\'s it.

As an example (this isn\'t true in Traveller, this is something out of RL)
we already have theories about computers that violate all our assumptions.
One assumption that CS has is that certain problems are NP-complete.  No
possible variation in coding technique that we\'ve ever discovered, no
advance in computer speed, no improvement of our existing machines can
change this (yes I know.  this isn\'t proven.  However, it is a standard
assumption in CS).  OTOH, the new nanotech breakthroughs have led many
people to believe that using quantum computers, these problems can be
solved in polynomial time.  This isn\'t just a different faster way of doing
things.  It\'s something _totally different_.  And that\'s only GTL8, not
even GTL12....

Well here\'s the table as printed in the book.:

Maneuver	2	5	8	11	14	17
Jump		2	3	4	5	6	7

The correction has the labels reversed...

It sounds like *you\'re* assuming they\'re indestructible.  They\'re not.  
They\'re actually very fragile.

The numbers come straight from High Guard 2nd Edition, pg 27 paragraph 5.  I 
directly quote the source:

"Disposable fuel tanks may be added to the ship to increase its range.  These 
L-Hyd Tanks are fitted to the outside of the ship and drop away before jump.  
The result is more interior space availiable for cargo and passengers.  Such 
tanks must be replaced each time they are used, so they are practical only on 
runs to civilised areas, or to increase fuel capacity to allow several jumps.  
L-Hyd tanks are installed outside the hull, and increase the total tonnage of 
the ship; drives are reduced in their efficiency based on the total tonnage of 
the ship.  With tanks retained, efficiency is decreased, and jump capability 
is reduced; when the tanks drop away, tonnage is reduced, and the drive 
efficiency is increased.  L-Hyd Tanks cost Cr10,000 plus Cr1,000 per ton of 
fuel carried."

This means an 80 ton drop tank for the 400 ton Munchkin Class freighter is 
90,000 credits.  10,000 + 80,000.  This is by the rules.  So where are you 
getting the idea that I was posting arbitrarily high numbers just to make sure 
they\'re expensive?

Just like I don\'t really care what GURPS breaks, cause I ain\'t stuck having to

Because it\'s in the *rules*.

From High Guard, pg 22, paragraph 8:

"Fuel:  A ship requires fuel for its jump drives and for its power plant; the 
power plant convrts fuel to energy for computers, jump drives, manuver drives, 
weapons, and screens.  Fuel tankage must be sufficient to contain a full load 
for the power plant and the jump drive.  Additional tankage may be installed 
as an option.  There is no cost for interior fuel tankage."

BTW, this paragraph flat out says that while it may be *possible* to design 
and build a ship that uses drop tanks for all jump fuel, it certainly ain\'t 
*legal* by the rules.  And yes, the Gazelle *is* compliant in that it is 
designed for Jump 4 performance *with* the tanks retained.

E=mv.  Objects in motion remain in motion.  And if your thrusters fail *once* 
when that ice chunk is centered on that station, you\'re gonna whack that 
station out.

We\'ll discuss the energy needed to melt that ice and refine it into pure LHyd 
another time.

Toldja.  I don\'t \'do\' GURPS.  But even so, it\'s *logical* that fuel would be more expensive further out from the primary because you have to pay to *ship* it.  Or at least, *somebody* does.

No.  6d6*10,000, or a max of 360,000 damage.  That\'s damn near impossible
to protect against.  I\'d settle for protecting against the mean damage
beyond 1/2Damage range, or about DR 90,000 as an absolute upper bound.  

As for a PAW spinal mount

What is

It\'s the number in parens after the damage value. for PAWs its not given,
so assumed to be one.  lasers have a damage divisor of 2, which would make
spinal lasers a potentially good idea, but I think there\'s a max size limit
on lasers.

> Is that the PD rating of 4? 

PD is separate, it affects dodge not damage.  (check the last full
paragraph, left column pg. 168)

Most of the world\'s big religions are under a few thousand years old (there
are a few exceptions), so there\'s no telling what kind of religions there
will be in the 54th century (Solomani Calendar). So when I did my sector
writeup for the Traveller campaign I just started (GURPS, starting in the
year 1115), I created a few.

The First Church of Elvis has a major rivalry with the Church of the Second
Coming of Elvis. The former is based in Solomani space, the latter in the
Imperium. Adherence to the First Church is primarily within the Solomani
Sphere (both sides of the current Imperial/Solomani border), while the
Church of the Second is dominant farther to coreward.

I have established a planet in the Dagudashaag sector as the home of
the Brotherhood Of The Sun. Members of the clergy and the administrative
staff of the church wear yellow from head to toe, all day, every day.
Other adherents simply wear something yellow among their clothing -- a
shirt, a hat, or socks... 

Obviously, this is a topic that I treat with more irreverance than
reverance. But to give you an idea of the extent of the depths to which
I am able to sink: in the Dagudashaag Sector is the Khandi subsector
(subsector G -- this comes straight from the map in the Galactic mapping
software). On the planet Khandi itself, I have established it as the
headquarters of Khandi Confections, Inc., a corporation which distributes
confections and other goodies sector-wide. Its "mascot" is known throughout
the sector and in some neighbouring sectors as a friendly face, and has
even been immortalized in a song whose title is his name: The Khandi Man.

And one more, since AD&D was mentioned. And this one was something I
myself did. (I started the original thread, so I might as well own up
to one of the dumbest things I\'ve done in a game.)

The party had been hired by a rich nobleman by the name of Rashid (or
something like that). I was playing a half-elven fighter/mage with a
warped sense of humour. When the noble introduced himself as "Rashid",
I blurted out "What\'d he say his name was? Rat shit?" One of Rashid\'s
guards fired an arrow at my character as a warning to show some respect.
(Hey, he was wearing armour.) I responded by firing a magic-missile 
spell back at the guard. This exchange quickly degenerated into a free-
for-all between the PC party and Rashid\'s guards & henchmen, a battle
which we ultimately won (trashing the place in the process). Needless to
say, Rashid decided not to hire us after all... (and the GM had to think 
quickly of something else to put the PCs through...)

(This was the same character who noted that a Decanter of Endless Water
had a very strong backblast when activated to its strongest setting. So
he strapped the decanter to the back of his armor, upside-down and corked,
cast "Levitate" on himself, rose into the air, opened the Decanter, and
turned it on full blast. Yes, it worked: he was flying. Two problems: there
was no way to steer, and the rest of the party, watching from the ground,
got a serious soaking...)

This collection of stories would make a great web site somewhere. (I
particularly like the one where the players decided to drop a cargo-hold
full of water onto the warehouse... though I don\'t recognize the adventure.)

I\'m assuming they are as sturdy as tanks are today.  If they

I don\'t have it in from of me, but my reading of his summary
was that a high jump ship could come out ahead with disposable
drop tanks.  But if I read it wrong, then I\'m sure he will
tell me....

Yes, if you want to take what is said in CT without question, then

You are assuming it has to be centered directly on the stations.
You wouldn\'t do it that way.

You asked were it came from.  I told you.

Yes I think the extra cost is quite reasonable.  It also is
trivial for a drop tank ship.

I can top that one. In a campaign I played in several years ago our party
was in a sewer, waist-deep in water. We were fighting gators or crocs or
something mundane like that. Our mage panics and casts lightning bolt into
the crock infested water.

The very same mage screwed up many times in his choice of spells or magic
items.

down, I have a way to take care of that minor technicality).  
2) How big would a Gene Bank be to hold 50K DNA Strands?
3) Were can I find the rules for how an Irish Brogue works, or should I start 
channel surfing for dialog with an Irish character in is?
4) Any ideas for characters? So far I only have a couple (the max is 178 new 
ones):
Jacob Kaylee: The leader of the colony project, not the best person for the 
job, will be taken care of.
Alex Tsing: The "rebel" colony leader, orginaly going to be the bad guy, but 
as the plot worked out he is going to be a much nicer character.
Siobhan O\'Keefe: a security exspert, going to be a major player in what 
happens.
Devin Marshall: engineer, also going to be a major player in the future of 
what happens.
Conrad Walter: a SPEW operator, becomes involed in things after speaking

 Just a wee question, whereabouts does it say (if anywhere) that the 3I can
 utilise the military resources of member worlds in order to carry out a
 military venture ?  If they can do so, how far can they go ?  That is, can
 they say to a member "Ah, look, we\'ll just borrow a few thousand tons of
 shipping and a corps or two of armor and have them all back to you in, say,
 three months.  OK ?"
 
 One would assume that they would, \'for the good of the Imperium\', but how
 much of a systems\' military resources can the 3I requisition to conduct war 
? >>

As I don\'t have any of the Traveller books (there in the mail, or atleast the

 skill was appropriate, combined with a parade of blunders where other 
 critical skills were called for.  The key was that he was just so effective

Yes, written by the TML\'s very own Inquistor Sniper General, Doug Berry.

\'At Close Quarters\' will be the next BITS publication. Having read it I
reckon it\'d work for MT and CT, especially if you use the weapons stats in
it. It is designed for T4 though.

 You don\'t feel that series (i.e., real) costs of the ship are useful in

  Nope. Drop tanks work comparatively better at higher J#\'s. I\'ve forwarded

  First off, unlike the nutbars at FS <quick look about> the Planning Div
here at JumpExpressCo likes to back up its wild conjecture with plausible-
looking numbers - hence the NumberCrunch program which keeps randomized
business cases on file for emergency presentations:

>  Calculations are approximate - maintenance at 0.1%, wages, life support, 
>and fuel are ignored below. Cargo charge is low, as some portion of revenue
>is from passage charged at a similar premium.

DROP TANKS - includes cost of _disposable_ tanks in operating cost (& mortgage):
 Unit  Ops. Cost/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge/Dt
 F6(i)  MCr 25.66      MCr  8.12     >216%     > Cr 3,160
 F6(d)  MCr 46.66      MCr 31.36      >49%     > Cr 1,490

  The above assumes that J1 (& J2?) ships at least really do charge KCr ~1.0
per Dt and stay in business. If so, then higher J# units would have to charge
something on the close order of the values above or they could not exist as
profitable business ventures. F-6i uses internal tankage only, thus the tiny
payload and very high _cost per unit capacity_. F6(d) uses drop tanks, and is
thus essentially unburdened by the widespread presumption that CT ships _must_
allocate 10% of their volume to L-Hyd per J# to be executed; the figures show
the increased basic (KCr 1.0/Dton) revenue and increased operating cost _which
assumes the destruction of expended drop tanks_!

  Unit cost per capacity with drop tank use is _halved_, _after extra costs_.

  Problems will arise if arguments occur as to whether customers will pay more
for service covering 6 parsecs/week compared to l or 2...

  Per TCS, "_the tanks themselves_* must also be purchased at a cost of
Cr 1000 per ton" - (* my emphasis).

 Per A:5, TCS, p. 12, header: "The following rules clarifications are presented
to more carefully state some of the concepts of that (HG2) book". Same section,
p. 13, Fuel Tankage: "jump fuel and additional fuel (i.e. beyond that of the
power plant requirements, which _must_ be permanent internal tankage) may be
carried in one of the additional tankage types outlined below." Drop tanks are
the last of the four options, and are described in detail on p. 14.

Aint got a copy of TCS around anymore.  My HG2 book has a copyright date of

OK, but what are you basing your figures on?  I don\'t find *any* references in 
CT about charging more for higher jumps.

Could be, but I *know* I saw something about travel by commercial boat from 
the high port in orbit to the planetary surface, and it was 100 Cr/ton.  
People I think were 25Cr.

>>If any of you have any similar anecdotes, of less-than-intelligent
>>things done by players, post \'em here!

First off, let me state that I was innocently hacking away on my old
TRS-80, while the Traveller groups my roomies were hosting in the
living room played.

One night, they were have a *large battle, and they came over and asked
me for help in calculating just what had happened. 

They\'d built a *lot* of ships, severely abusing things like Zuchai
crystals and black globe availability. During the battle, they
overloaded the black globe on their "flagship". They weren\'t sure how
much damage would ensue. 

I sat down and calculated the amount of energy it would have taken,
plus how much they had in "secondary" storage (the crystals/jump
capacitors they were using to allow higher rates of fire from weapons).
And after a few quick calculations, I also asked how much LH2 was
aboard the ship. 

As soon as I got a first approximation, I asked for data on the
positions of of all the ships, and what *they* had on board. This was
because I figured there was no way that at least *some* of the nearby
ships wouldn\'t get included in the blast.

Turned out that their formations were ridiculously tight.

By the time I finished adding things up and looking up references on
thjings like weapons effects, I had to tell them that not only had both
fleets been destroyed, but that they\'d done severe damage to the planet
they were orbiting!

After some discussion, it was decided to rule that the atmosphere had
gone from "normal" to "thin, tainted", with a *big* drop in
hydrosphere, and the essential destruction of *everything* on the side
of the planet the blast occured over (my initial calculations gave a
*crater* around a 1000 km across on this size 8 world). 

This turned what *had* been a nasty corporate war into the Imperium
putting out warrants for *everyone* employed by *both* corps. 

ps. it *really* broke my heart to have these "munchkins" get hoist by
their own petard *literally*. :-)

We had a small army wandering in the wilderness. The DM had a huge,
ancient red dragon using its breath weapon to "strafe" us. On the
second pass we put enough arrows, bolts, spells and what-have-you into
the air to kill it. While it was in a dive aimed at the center of the
group... Oops! We took more damage from the dragon falling out of the
sky than from the first breath weapon pass!

Note that the above scenario works well in any game where air attacks
can happen. :-)

The "castle" they were exploring my *old* D&D campaign was built on top
of a mothballed fort left behind by high tech visitors long, long ago.
They were *determined* to get past the barriers keeping them out of the
"fort" sections (stasis fields). A couple *almost* decided to try
teleporting in. But finally, they tried to "blast" their way in. 

They "woke up" the battle computer enough to trigger a "low level"
automated response. It destroyed the seige engines, then started
clearing the "cover" (old growth forest). And then it spotted the
"shielding" they\'d been watching from behind as their "hirelings" had
launched the attack. They managed to teleport away with only a *bad*
case of sunburn. You see, the fort was using multi-gigawatt *beam*
lasers, with 1 meter apertures to do all this... :-)

This *and the rest of your "counter arguments" is based on a
misconception. Computers operate according to some fairly simple rules
of logic and math. These are *not* going to change, no matter *how*
sophisticated the computer gets. 

More on this below.

Actually, computer viruses only propogate due to poor system design and
administration. We\'ve known they were *possible* for decades. It\'s just
that they only appeared in reality in systems such as MS-DOS computers
that had been designed with no concept whatsoever of system security.

It doesn\'t matter. As noted above, they *have* to follow certain
rules/laws, just as all mechanical devices have to be based on
principles known to Archimedes 3000 years ago. Show him a modern
mechanical device, and you might have to explain where the *power*
comes from, but he\'d understand the rest. He\'d be surprised at the
quality of the parts and at their size, but they\'d follow rules he was
completely familiar with. 

Likewise, we know now the rules computers of *any* type have to follow.
We\'ve known most since Babbage\'s time, and the rest since Turing and
von Neuman. *NO* new rules have been discovered, nor are any likely to
be. We\'ve just gotten more sophisticated *combinations* of the rules.

Ada Lovelace wouldn\'t understand how the logic of our cumputers is
*implemented*. But she\'d understand the *logics*. And thus the rules
they follow. Ditto goes for the stuff in the 3I. A logic gate is a
logic gate. Regardless of whether it\'s implemented as a mechanical
device, a circuit with tubes, a transistor circuit, part of an IC, an
optical circuit, or a quantum well device. Neural nets are simply more
complex arrays of gates.

And sorry, but I\'d like a reference for those "organic cores". 

Anyway, by the rules of computing, you have "program" and you have
"data". They *can* be stored in the same "memory" *or* they can be kept
completely seperate. There exist *now* (and have since the 50s)
computers where the program store and data store are completely
seperate. On such a machine a virus is *impossible*. 

Even on normal von Neuman architecture systems, where code and data use
a common store, unless a program is set up to *allow* data to be
treated as code, it\'s not possible to get data executed.

And given the examples of recent years, you *really* think that OSes

things like the Melissa virus? That they are going to leave *obvious*

You don\'t get it. The life form may "live" in computers, but that gives
it no more advantage in dealing with them than the fact that we live in
biological organisms gives us in dealing with such. 

It\'s like saying that because you are organic, you can "take over"
an organism that was *built* by expert biological engineers and
*designed* to do only certain things.

Sorry, but again, this is a matter of the "rules of computing". Tech
level merely defines how the rules are *implemented*, not what they
are. The rules of solitaire are the same regardless of whether you are
playing with a deck of cards or a computer. 

Likewise, the existence of such a parameter is independent of TL. It
*is* possible to design a computer without the ability to set such a
restriction. Nobody is going to because it conveys *no* advantage, and
has *major* disadvantages.

Self-programming doesn\'t mean what you think it does. It means that
computers will be able to write programs. That means they can create a
"dataset" that can be used as a program. But that doesn\'t mean that
they are going to go around executing *outside* datasets. 

To use the "ROM disk" analogy, the computer can write the new program
to a chunk of memory, and then set that memory to read only. While the
*details* will be different, it\'s essentially the same principle as
burning a new ROM, then sticking the ROM into a socket in the
"executables" bank. 

And believe me, there *will* be safeguards on the ability to self
program. Mostly to make sure that there\'s no outside interference.

Not necessarily. Circuitry will tend to be hardwired. *Software* can be
reconfigured. This is why we use general purpose computers, with
application programs, rather than reconfigure the hardware for each new
application.

And, as such, won\'t work in computers. Among other things, writing a
virus requires intimate knowledge of hardware and software that it will
execute on. And, as I\'ve pointed out, it\'s not *possible* if the OS has
decent security.

Nobody has a problem with the Virus being able to "brainwash" the
transponders. It\'s being able to infect *other* computers over comm
links and the like that trips the BS detectors.

Synaptics is the means of implementing the logic. That no more makes
two computers compatible than using ICs does. A program for a Motorola
CPU won\'t work on an Intel CPU. And FIB computers are going to be
*more* different than non-FIB units. 

Self-programming doesn\'t mean compatible either. Object-Oriented
programs aren\'t transferable between different architectures except
*maybe* as source code. Viruses have to be transferred as *object*
code. As *executables*. Which means they are *very* restricted.

You are confusing hardware, algorithms, and computational logic.

If it isn\'t spreading through physical contact, then it is spreading
via *some* sort of communications channel. Since meson comms are out
(most ships don\'t have them), and sound is out (space is a vacuum) the
only thing *left* is EM (light, radio, etc).

Anyway, this is the dividing point. Some folk think that more advanced
technology will follow different rules. And others know that computers
are based on rules that *don\'t* change. Ever.

*Any* program can be reduced to a set of logical operations (one or
more algorithms).
*Any* logical operation can be implemented via combining a few basic
operations. For example: [And, Or, Not]. [And, Not]. [Or, Not]. [Nand].
[Nor]. 

The underlying *hardware* doesn\'t matter. Likewise, the language
doesn\'t matter. The language merely affects the way you express an
algorithm, not the actual algorithm. 

"If x then y" yeilds the following truth table:

x\\y T F
 T  T F
 F  T T

Thus "X or not Y" is the same statement. Ditto for "not (x and y)". I\'m
not going to bother with the Nand and Nor versions. 

But you can build stuff like adders, flip-flops, etc all the way up to
complete computers out of nothing more than this. In the final
analysis, any CPU is describable by a truth table of all the input
lines and output lines. And as such, they can be "resolved" to a series
of logical statements.

What you are saying is equivalent to saying that you won\'t be able to
understand how a *mechanical* device operates, merely because it is
higher TL. Sorry, it still has to obey the laws of mechanics. It may
have inputs or outputs based on something else, by the *mechancial*
operations will be understandable to you, or to Archimdes (about 3000
years ago, when those laws were first discovered).

Likewise, computers are devices designed *expressly* to cary out
sequences of logical and mathematical operations. No more and no less.
The TL will change *how* the operations are carried out. Rather like
the TL changes *how* the power that turns the shafter leading to a gear
train is generated. 

Would you try to claim that a *calculator* at a high TL is less
understandable than a current TL one? It\'s *exactly* the same thing.
*Regardless* of the innards, give the calculator the operands (numbers)
and operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc). and it spits out
an answer based one the rules of math.

Wrong. We can be *absolutely* sure of some things. Newtonian physics
(including the laws of mechanics and thermodynamics) will still best
the best description of the way the universe works at speeds well below
C, gravity fields less that those near a star, and energy densities
also less than "extreme". 

Likewise, the laws of logic and math will be the same. Which means that
since computers *embody* those laws, they will still have to follow
them. Thus clock cycles *must* exist, as operatiions need to be
synchronized. Ditto for data and code seperation. Assembly level
instructions also fall into that category, though they may be hidden
behind several lievels of \'higher level\' structures (sort of like
microcode in many current processors). 

If it\'s *totally* different, then it *won\'t* be a computer.

And if the rule book says that you can get more energy out of a device

If they are computers, they have to follow the rules of math and logic.
And be capable of having their work duplicated (however slowly) by a
Turing machine.

That\'s because quantum computers are (in effect) able to use
transfinite math in calculations. 

That doesn\'t change the fact that they are carrying out mathematical
and logical operations.

But, even quantum computers *can\'t* answer the halting problem.

NP-complete merely deals with *how fast*.

Well, I think we need a few write-ups. A couple I can think of are
"First Church of Satan, Reformed". And some sort of "high church"
Wiccans.

Most of the "programs" are in the way the brain is *wired*. Most
learned behaviors are in how the neural net is "trained". we still
aren\'t sure *how* memories are stored.

That\'s 6*d*x10,000 = 360,000 HP max. Other spinal weapons will have
different values. 

[DR (damage resistance) is a measure of armor value, by the way; hit points
(HP) measure damage inflicted or taken.]

>If so; would that mean I would need 
>enough meson screen modules to negate 60,000 DR? 

Armor and meson screens should be based on damage beyond the 1/2 damage
range, since this is where most engagements will occur (besides, it
discourages munchkinism) => DR 180,000 max, in your example.  The
theoretical maximum for a spinal mount in GT is something like 165,000 HP
average and 282,000 HP max beyond 1/2D range.

>As for a PAW spinal mount 
>hit, what amount of armor would I need? I know I\'ve got to stop 60,000 DR, 
>but pg. 168 says: " subtract target DR (modified by armor divisior)". What
is 
>the armor divisor? 

The armor divisor is that number or symbol in parentheses after the damage.
PA\'s don\'t have an armor divisor. X-ray lasers (all the ones in GT) have an
armor divisor of (2), which means you divide the armor DR by 2 before
subtracting it from the HP of damage rolled for the laser. In effect, you
have to double the amount of armor to get the same protection. Meson guns
have an armor divisor of (!), which means they ignore conventional DR but
are affected by meson screen DR.

>Is that the PD rating of 4?

PD is passive defense, and depends on the ship, not the weapon. It is a
measure of the chance that a shot will "glance off" a sloped armor plate
without doing damage, and therefore mostly intended for tanks and other
heavily sloped vehicles. I would pretty much ignore it for space combat,
unless I wanted to demonstrate to my players the futility of taking on a
warship:

"Whoa! 21 x 1,500 = 31,500 HP of damage, less DR 100 for your armor -- you
take 31,400 points of damage, and your ship is vaporized. Oh, wait a minute
[roll dice]. Damn, you made your passive defense roll, so your armor is
only slightly singed. What do you want to do now?" [Silly, I know, but
useful with some kinds of players...]

In general, armor rating should be tied to the class of ship: Escorts
should be able to stand hits from turret weapons, but not bay weapons.
Cruisers should be able to ignore hits from turret weapons and stand hits
from bay weapons, but not spinal weapons. Battleships and battleriders
should be able to ignore hits from bay weapons and stand hits from their
own or smaller spinal weapons.

In Canada, farming is the most hazardous occupation, bar none.

Mind you, having seen a farmer pick up something from a tub of pesticide,
without gloves and without washing his hands afterwards, I figure that a
fair number of \'farm accidents\' should be reclassified as \'farm
self-inflicted injuries\'.

Tight deadlines, tight budgets, a wide variety of equipment and hazmat
substances, and poorly trained workers are a lethal mixture.

I once had an AD&D character who was a Noble and was asked her opinion on democracy:

"Oh yes!  Let the peasants vote for who leads them, what a good idea!

"While we\'re at it, why don\'t we vote the Gnome Illusionist as the spearhead for the next full frontal attack?  We can also vote for

This confusion might explain some of the errors in various ship designs in Fighting Ships and the Spinward Marches Campaign.  

Ever looked at the numbers for a Laurenti class Battle Carrier?  It must have been designed with drop tanks in mind <g>.

into the Traveller universe (CT,MT)? ... I know the trade rules cover a

The CT answer is found in JTAS #4 (p. 6) and Adv 5: Trillion Credit
Squadron (p. 32). There is a table of exchange rates, based on starport
class and TL, for converting Imperial credits to local credits. In essence,
your Imperial credits buy more goods than the same amount of local currency
(unless on Mora or another TL F, starport A world). You can either exchange
credits (divide your credit total by the exchange rate) or adjust local
prices to Imperial credits (multiply by the exchange rate); the effect is
the same.

The same table appears in TNE (p. 230), but I don\'t know whether MT used it
or not. GT has a different version (suitable for GURPS) in Far Trader (p.
48), along with an explanation of the economics behind it.

The Islands Clusters (Adv 5: TCS, pp. 40-48) were settled by slow boats
launched in 2050; the text refers to "several" large colony expeditions, of
which the ESA mission that wound up in the Clusters was only "the most

GURPS Biotech (p. 22) says a lifebank is $500, 5 pounds, and 0.1 cubic foot
per embryo stored; "hundreds" of germ cells can be frozen for the same
amount of weight, space, and cost. Say, Cr500, 2.25 kg, and 2.8 l per
hundred samples.

Well, for anyone here who knows the answer to _that_, the Nobel Prize
Committee can be reached in Stockholm, Sweden...

We haven\'t really got much of a clue how the human brain works. We\'ve worked
out some of the basic mechanics, but _how_ those basic mechanics combine to
make an organ that can write Beethoven\'s 5th Symphony or come into school with
some bombs and guns and kill your classmates, we\'re _really_ clueless, no
matter what we claim we know.

Hell, we\'re still studying _flatworm_ brains to see how they work, and those
have a handful of ganglia.

I\'ve said it before, but anyone claiming to know with certainty how a TL16
computer works is also claiming to know how an iMac works, in detail, and why
the Autostart Worm can\'t possibly work, based on their extensive experience
with an abacus or Incan counting strings.

Most people in the \'data and programs are eternally separate\' camp are
blindered by the fact that the Turing model of computing is so successful, so far.

For example, on a more abstract basis, that model breaks down with object
oriented programming, objects can be data and program. Waaay down at the heart
of the silicon chip, since the Turing Model is hardwired into them, computers
today make the distinction between executable and data, but what if the Turing
Model isn\'t the only workable one? After all...the human brain doesn\'t
_appear_ so far to follow that model. If it did, the \'Expert System\' AI people
would have succeeded a long time ago.

And truthfully, modern chips don\'t necessarily make that distinction...it\'s
been a _long_ time since I\'ve done any assembler (hint: I was using the 6502
instruction set ;-) but most modern register based chips only have a flag bit
to say whether a register holds an instruction or data, right? If something
could manipulate that flag bit like you or I wiggle our fingers, well, then it
might be pretty darn easy for \'data\' to be treated as \'executable\' and vice
versa, ESPECIALLY if while wiggling your finger you were physically
rearranging the circuitry.

<sigh>

This argument is the heart of the battle between Pro- and Anti- virus folk on
this list, and like "Feudal Technocracy!" "Technological Feudalism!" "Tastes
Great!" "Less Filling!" is an argument without end.

At least no one\'s tried to convert anyone to a hamster via e-mail yet....

Just two comments...

1) The little cartoon at the bottom appears to show the user firing at two
targets simultaneously: wow!

2) It also shows the idiot standing up from behind decent cover to do
so...idiot! Let me amend that DEAD idiot!

Also, I really, sincerely hope that that a TWS is some miracle device, because
I _cannot_ believe that an M16/M203 combo comes _anywhere_ close to $28k per
system. $14/round??? (I\'m really hoping that\'s a per 100 measure or something...)

Why strands? It\'s far simpler to freeze lots of ova and sperm. For 50k
individuals, with lots of samples so you can continue the cross-breeding
program, I\'d say you could get by with a few dTons of space, plus whatever you
need for refrigeration equipment.

In my copy of Book 2 (I think it\'s an older edition, based on comments
about Book 2 encounter tables), page 2, it states that commercial
interplanetary travel by scheduled liner is "approximately 10% of the
cost for similar interstellar travel."

Who follows football???

Seriously, the only hockey team worth mentioning in Cleveland is the 
Lumberjacks, and they ain\'t worth mentioning twice.  And ever since the Force 
went bankrupt (MISL, for those who didn\'t know), the place hasn\'t been worth 
talking about.

And besides, the way they financed Jacobs Field and Gund Arena makes it a 
prime target for a 30 MT blast...

AFAIK, there are no rules anywhere in GURPS for ramscooops.  This is, IMHO,
a gross oversight.  There might be something in the GURPSNet archive though...

Title of his post: "America not a superpower", date posted 1999/05/03,
in soc.history.what-if

The setting is Classic Trav 1120, but is easily movable.
I would have put it on Aramanx (Aramis: Spinward Marches
3005 B657974-6 ), but it would have interfered with canon, and
anyway\'s, it seem\'s to be everyone\'s favourate world to fight
a neo-WW II.  I\'ll pick on Marastan  (Glisten: 2231 D868772-5 924)
instead, ignoring what Gurps:Traveller has to say on the world.

********

There are about six major nations on Marastan, and about
50 smaller countries.  Several of these nations have
empires.  At 1100 (before the Eighth Marastan War),
the major nations included:

Suliikirsi
- - an island state, holding 1.7% of the world\'s population.
At 1100, they held an empire controlling  17.5% of the
world\'s population, and 10% of the world\'s land area.
At 1100, the  TL is 5 on the home island,
0 - 4 in the empire (mainly 3-4)

Shur Lekushakliluurgim
- - a continental state of  4.2% of the world\'s population.
They had no empire, but the state controlled 5% of the world\'s
land area.  At 1100, the TL is 5.

Ukakim i Imgarmurshika
- - a continental state of 1.5% of the world\'s popualtion.
At 1100, they held an empire controlling an additional 0.6%
of the world\'s population, and all together has 1% of the world\'s
land area.  At 1100, the TL is 5 on the home nation, 1 in the empire.

Malagiirkisa Ur Uuki
- - a continental state of 5.0% of the world\'s population.
At 1100, they held no empire, but the state has 8% of the world\'s
land area.  At 1100, the TL is 4 - 3.

Shimiirlemuga
- - a continental state of 2.0% of the world\'s population.  At 1100, they
held an empire controlling an additional 7.2% of the
world\'s population, and all together has 5% of the world\'s land area.
At 1100, the TL is 5 in the home state, 0 - 3 in the empire.

Phyrenethion
- - an island state of 2.2% of the world\'s population.  They
held an empire controlling an additional 0.8% people, and all
together has 2% of the world\'s land area.  At 1100, the TL is 5
on the home island, 4 - 5 in the empire.

All these nations were (and are) Viliani-dominated, with one exception.
The nation\'s are 100% Vilani (with one exception),
and the empires 80%-100% Solomani.
There are only four independent Solomani nations: most
Solomani on Marastan live under a Vilani empire.  All the
major nations (with two exceptions) are on the Rajkot continent.

There are two exceptions to the above.  Shur Lekushakliluurgim
is dominated by the Vilani, but about 15% of the population
are subject Solomani: they are citizen\'s, but are definitely
poorer, discriminated against, and have fewer rights than the
Vilani (both legal and social).

At one time, the Lekushakliluurgi were member\'s of the
Suliikirsi empire, but successfully revolted.

The Suliikirsi empire has several independent,  TL 5 Vilani states
allied with it, which can be called on to help the mother country.
Despite the revolution, many Lekushakliluurgi still retain ties to
Suliikirsi, while other\'s consider it their main competitor.

The other major exception to the pattern  above is the
Phyrenethioi.  Phyrenethion is a 100% Solomani nation, which has
assimilated much of the dominant Spinward-Vilani culture.  They have
managed to upgrade their TL from 3 to 5 in a mere 100 years,
although much of their domestic and social life still has a TL 3 "look and feel".

********************

Additional geography notes

Ukakim i Imgarmurshika and  Shimiirlemuga are located on the
Rajkot continent, with the island of the Suliikirsi nearby off the far eastern
shore, and the massive Malagiirkisa Ur Uuki on the Rajkot
continent to the West.  Shur Lekushakliluurgim is on a seperate
continent, on the other side of the world.

Most of the independent Vilani nations are on the Rajkot continent,
with only three on Udaipur, the continent dominated by Shur
Lekushakliluurgim.  The other two continent\'s, Rann and Por Godhra,
are colder continent\'s dominated by Vilani-ruled Solomani.
Rann is contiguous with Rajkot, seperated by a long mountain range:
the Solomani nation of Phyrenethion is at the far side of Rann.
Por Godhra is a massive continent, north of Pajkot, colonized by
the Vilani: it play\'s little part in world affair\'s.

The massive Mumbai Ocean seperates the Phyrenethioni (on the ocean\'s east side) from the Udaipur continent (on the
western side), with the somewhat smaller Jaipur Ocean dividing the Udaipur landmass (on the Jaipur\'s eastern side)
from the Rajkot continent (on the Jaipur\'s western side).

********************

Military situation:

At 1093, Ukakim i Imgarmurshika was defeated in a major conflict
on the Rajkot continent, fighting against all the other Vilani states
(including Lekushakliluurgi, who sent an expeditionaly force late in the
war).  At 1102, the Ukakimi stop paying their heavy reparation
payment\'s, with the support of all except Shimiirlemuga.

The new government of Malagiirkisa Ur Uuki invades a few minor
Vilani states on Rajkot, on 1107.  This worries the Ukakimi, who re-arm with
the approval of the Suliikirsi.  The Malagiirkisai invader\'s get\'s
bogged down in mountain warfare.

At 1108 the Malagiirkisai successfully invade another nation, Giisiraguu Mash,
which is a neighbour of Ukakim i Imgarmurshika.  The Ukakimi defend their
neighbour\'s, committing much of their military to repelling the Malagiirkisai
army: this mark\'s the offical start of the Eighth Marastan War.
The Shimiirlemugai invade Ukakim i Imgarmurshika, while fighting
Suliikirsi\'s navy. (Suliikirsi is precieved as an ally of the hated Ukakimi:
the Shimiirlemugai\'s action\'s soon make that preception a reality).
A few lesser Vilani nations ally\'s themselves with the Shimiirlemugai on Rajkot

At 1109, the Phyrenethioi launch a surprise attack on Shimiirlemugai
possession\'s near the Mumbai Ocean.  The Suliikirsi relucantly support
this Solomani attack on the Shimiirlemugai empire. The war on the Rajkot
continent stabilizes into a slugfest, with expensive offworld mercenaries making
lightening strikes on supply lines and providing intelligence (when they
aren\'t busy fighting each other).

The Malagiirkisai start focusing on mass-producing TL 4 tank armies (with some
experimental TL 5 units), while the Suliikirsi, Phyrenethioi and the Ukakimi
focus on research in modifying off-world TL 5/6 technology to useful tools.

Late in 1109, a small Vargr raiding squadron - stiffened by two Zhodani
units - strike at Marastan, as part of the greater Fifth Frontier War (1107-1110).
The local starport takes some damage, but most of the real hurt
is suffered by civilian traders, profiting from the war.  Six ship\'s are destroyed,
and twenty damaged before the raider\'s dissappear into Jumpspace.

At 1110, the Malagiirkisai invade a Phyrenethioi puppet state on Rann.
The Phyrenethoi befin a crash program to build up their tanks, with
Suliikirsi and Ukakimi support.  The invasion is slowly turned back by
the Phyrenethioi.  Meanwhile, the Shimiirlemugai army in Ukakim i
Imgarmurshika is defeated while attempting a major river crossing:
as the direct invasion of Ukakim i Imgarmurshika is tuned back, the
Shimiirlemugai begin attacking portions of the Suliikirsi empire in
Por Godhra and Rann.

By around 1113, the A Khashikhinkakha alliance of nations
( Phyrenethion, Ukakim i Imgarmurshika, Suliikirsi, and a few minor
Vilani states) are clearly victorious, and there is an armistice.
A treaty is soon drawn up, which divides up the Shimiirlemuga empire
as spoil\'s for the victor\'s, and gives disputed Shimiirlemuga/Ukakim i
Imgarmurshika territory to Ukakim i Imgarmurshika.  Some national
Malagiirkisai territory is given to the Phyrenethioi, as well.

By 1114, Malagiirkisai is sliding into chaos under it\'s new government,
while Shimiirlemuga schemes to regain her rightful place under the sun.
All demobilize to focus of rebuilding their domestic economy, except Phyrenethion.
Seeing their chance, they strike across the Mumbai Ocean at Shur
Lekushakliluurgim, who stayed out of the Eighth Marastan War.
Destroying the Lekushakliluurgi fleet on the Mumbai shores, they invade
the costal region\'s of the Lekushakliluurgi.  Resentful of the Lekushakliluurgi
refusal to fight to defend Vilani civilization in Rajkot, no Vilani state
lift\'s a finger to help them, except - in a very limited fashion - the Shimiirlemuga.

The small, low-tech (aka not a single tank!), inexperienced Lekushakliluurgi
army start\'s to fight back, and all of Shur Lekushakliluurgim start\'s to apply
their major economic muscle to regain their land\'s and bring the fight to
the Phyrenethioi.

During the Eighth Marastan War, the A Khashikhinkakha alliance developed a way to build an atomic bomb.  Quote from one
of Phil Hunt\'s follow-up posts:

   There\'s two ways of making nukes. You can either build a U bomb,
   getting the fissile material by gas diffusion (very expensive), or
   you can build a Pu bomb, getting the fissile material from a breeder
   reactor (cheaper, but the bomb is more difficult to make). The...
   wartime effort tries the latter -- they don\'t have the resources
   to do both. The electronics and shaped charges needed to detonate a
   Pu bomb are available, as an offshoot of their wartime radar and
   AT ammunition programs.

The A-bomb\'s were top secret, and were only to be used if the Imperium
abandoned Marastan, or in case of dire emergency.  The other power\'s
dismantled their bombs after the Eighth Marastan War, but the
Phyrenethion didn\'t, and as the war turned against them (fought with a savage
racial edge on both sides, may I add), two major Lekushakliluurgi cities  got
nuked on 84-1116.

The highest Imperial representative insystem at the time, Sir Uudingagsuur
Gishurmushdi, immediately demanded a ceasefire from both
the Lekushakliluurgi and the Phyrenethioi, and got it.  [No, he had no warship\'s
or Imperial troops with him: they obeyed him simply because of who he represented.]

Later, the Imperial government launched an investigation of all the major states
on the planet.  Many researchers and governmental officals were shot/killed by the sword for treason against the
Imperium, while heavy fines were tossed every
which way.  The Phyrenethion were ordered to retreat from Lekushakliluurgi
territory, which they did with alacrity.

Because this was a first offence, and the use of Imperial military personnel
wasn\'t needed to get the locals to obey, the Imperium went easy on the offending
nations.  This is not appricated by the local Phyrenethioi, who *know* that they
would have pounded the snot out of the Solomani Phyrenethioi if given the
chance.

******************

The political situation, as of1120

Suliikirsi
- - an island state, holding 1.7% of the world\'s population.
Currently, they hold an empire controlling  18.0% of the
world\'s population, and 12% of the world\'s land area.

Shur Lekushakliluurgim
- - a continental state of  4.2% of the world\'s population.
They have no empire, but the state controlled 5% of the world\'s
land area.

Ukakim i Imgarmurshika
- - a continental state of 1.5% of the world\'s popualtion.
At 1100, they held an empire controlling an additional 3.0%
of the world\'s population, and all together has 3% of the world\'s
land area.

Malagiirkisa Ur Uuki
- - a continental state of 5.0% of the world\'s population.
The state has 8% of the world\'s land area, but much of it
is ungovernable.

Shimiirlemuga
- - a continental state of 2.1% of the world\'s population, and
.5% of the world\'s surface area.  They have no empire.

Phyrenethion
- - an island state of 2.2% of the world\'s population.  They
held an empire controlling an additional 4.8% people, and all
together has 4% of the world\'s land area.

Note that the tech level\'s did not increase despite the war.
The Imperium as part of it\'s sanctions removed all tech gains
secured during the war (including deporting personnel, smashing
labs and burning books and manuscripts).  Moreover, the Vilani never
liked technological change anyway, and the majority support
the Imperium\'s actions.

The TL of Malagiirkisa Ur Uuki has declined substantially in most areas
due to poverty: some TL4 areas still hold out, due to Vilani reluctance to
tolerate a TL decline (that is also a change, and all Vilani know that Change
is Bad.)

******************

Local patrons

A) Local Solomani

The PC\'s can be hired by local Solomani, but that\'s unlikely,
as they have no money.  Still, the Spinward Marches is mainly Solomani,
so the local\'s do have some interstellar symphathizers.  Very few care
enough to put their lives or their money on the line, however.

The local\'s are mainly of Indian descent, with some American, Hispanic and
Vilani blood mixed in: their ancestor\'s first colonized Marastan at around
the 400\'s, and named most of the local geography  (including the world
itself).  The Vilani are harsh masters, insisting that
all Solomani-derived customs, languages, cultures and religions be
suppressed: but obedience to the Vilani is rewarded and loyality praised.

The majority distain and/or ignore their Vilani overlords, and are puzzled
on why their powerful Solomani cousin\'s don\'t come from the sky to help them.

B) The Phyrenethioi

Arriving in this nation, one feel\'s that they are in a fractured, off-centre
copy of a Vilani world.  The Phyrenethioi sometimes seems more Vilani than
anything this side of the Claw, but their custom\'s, buildings, clothing and speech
contain more than a trace of Solomani influence.  The Vilani scout
walking in their street\'s would be interested by the people and
the distinctive mix of cultures here.

The local language is a form of Modern Vilani, mixed in with good
portions of Hindi, ASL (a synthetic Trojan Reach language) and the
Indian English of the Second Imperium.

Strangely, despite their Solomani origins, they run the most repressive,
tightly organized empire on the planet.  Their empire has been reprimanded
twice by the Imperium for running slave camp\'s (with heavy fines and
resititution the price to be paid), and while the other empires are generally peaceful, the Phyrenethioi are always
having to suppress three or four
rebellions at a time.

C) The Lekushakliluurgi

While the Phyrenethioi imitate the Vilani, the Lekushakliluurgi
are being reshaped by their large Solomani minority.  On the one
hand, they have pride in their Vilani heritage and blood, and despise
anything Solomani.  On the other hand, their music, language, religion,
and clothing are clearly being influenced by their Solomani servants,
even as the masters refuse to see it.  Even their national symbol,
a long blue pennant edged with red and white stripes, was clearly
influenced by a certain famous Solomani flag (don\'t try to debate this with
the locals, however: they will just go on a rant on how many Vilani cultures
use the same design, ages before the Solomani even set foot on their
moon).

The Solomani have more right\'s here than anywhere else on Marastan:
Anglic shares equal status with Vilani in this nation, and Solomani
local\'s can enter the professions, or even obtain government positions
in the ruling civil service here.  On the other hand, a Solomani man
looking at a Vilani woman the wrong way is a good way to get yourself
killed here, while no one would even do in the Vilani colonies (who would
merely cut off the woman from the Vilani community, locking her into a life
of poverty).

The Lekushakliluurgi have recovered from their economic downturn,
and a minority are still itching for revenge against the filthy Solomani
Phyrenethioi.  They feel that the Imperium stole the glory that is rightfully
their\'s, and would love offworld help (even  <gag> *Solomani* help)
to provoke a war against the Phyrenethioi, and get their full pound
of flesh.

D) Suliikirsi

Holding the most powerful nation on the planet, Suliikirsi is in a slow decline.
The recent war has exhausted revenue and the number of young men, and
their grip on their empire is loosening somewhat.  The society comes
close to the Vilani idea, stable, harmonious and unchanging, with many
customs and laws dating from the initial Vilani settlement, centuries ago.
They *never* mix with Solomani socially - even wealthy, out-of-system Solomani -
but they also pride themselves on their political ability, and their sense of
fair play and consistency.

The downside portion of the planetary main port is based on the home island,
nearby the major city of Khiikun (long the largest city on the planet,
it\'s now in a neck-to-neck race with the Lekushakliluurgi city of
A Iirlii for the title).  Visitor\'s are treated courteously here, but most
Solomani find the food super bland ("Just the way they do it on
Vland!") and make a speedy trip to nearby Shimiirlemuga for something
edible.

E) Ukakim i Imgarmurshika

The up-and-coming power on Marastan, the Ukakimi concern is
"Keeping the Suliikirsi in, the Malagiirkisai out and the
Shimiirlemuga down."  Their empire is well-organized for
pure profit: as long as the natives work hard, they don\'t really care
what they do in their off-time.  A lot of their new empire is being
extensively developed and industrialized.

The largest colonial war currently on the planet is in the colony of
Ratangarh: the area is being ethnically cleansed of Solomani, in
preparation of Ukakimi settlement. Close supervision by Imperial
officer\'s is being done to prevent massacres, but the planet is a
backwater and the number of officer\'s few.

Good thing about those satellites - they are worth another 80 men on
the ground, and are doing a great job in restraining Ukakimi from fighting
the local natives in the traditional Vilani style.  Now, there\'s just no way that
the Ukakimi government would dare defy Imperial law, and hire someone
to knock them down, now is there?  Nahhh....

F) Shimiirlemuga

Currently, the Shimiirlemugai are still locked in a nasty political
firefight, with martial law in several provinces.  The locals can\'t
decide if they hate the murderous Ukakimi or the treasonous
Suliikirsi more, and everyone is pointing the finger at everyone else
as the cause of their defeat and the loss of their empire.

Interestingly, offworlder\'s Solomani recieve their best reception here:
the Shimiirlemugai have a reputation for good food, fine living, and
intellectualism, and are happy to share these things with visitors - for
a price.

During this chaotic period of Shimiirlemuga history, the Imperial
Catholic Church (Denebi Rite) is making a remarkable comeback, and is
rapidly growing back it\'s membership and influence, lost in the
nation\'s third revolution 230 year\'s ago. (Incidentally, this nation has had
about three more revolutions than any other Vilani nation on the planet).

G) Malagiirkisa

Currently, the Malagiirkisai are not worthy of the title of "Major Power",
but they have a history of coming back from the grave, so they will be
included in this brief survey.

The Malagiirkisa government is offically by a ruling ideolgical elite, but
in reality has dissolved into warlordism.  While a few of the warlord\'s
do fight among themselves, most are willing to carve up the pie among
themselves, and devour the local wealth for themselves.  Even so,
the decline of Malagiirkisa power has levelled off, setting the stage
for either a second sharp fall or a recovery led by some charismatic
individual. (Well, "charismatic" in the Vilani sense, rather than Vargr or
Solomani meaning.)

The Imperial government has been working to cobble some viable
government for the Malagiirkisai for the last three years, with some
progress made.  Still, a recent setback has increased Imperial frustration:
there is already talk of abandoning the effort, and letting the chip\'s fall where
they may.  Several Imperial noble families and corporations are already
laying their own plans for Malagiirkisa, but won\'t step in till the Imperial
mediator\'s step out.  They may not have long to wait.

Huh?  Rules for a brogue?

Ok.

Take One Irishman.
Insert 1 pint (Imperial) of Guinness Stout
Insert 1 shot whiskey (Bushmills or Jamesons)
Repeat until desired brogue is reached.

Hmm. Well, having been involved in writing it (hence take this with a pinch
of salt) I do use 101 Religions, which has analogues to many current
religions, plus a large number ranging from cargo cults up to strange
sects. One of my favourites is the one which tends to be scientist driven
infested and believes that \'god\' was present at the birth of the universe,
so keeps on trying to build a deep space array of satelites to build a
sensor platform which can see into the past.

Funny thing is, at a certain point in Traveller\'s history, all records of
these people and their observation system disappear and all that an be
found of them is an obscure reference to archery.

The other ones I like include the RCCS and the Aslan one (Shrine of Heroes)
which are kind of interesting.

One of the GURPS: Far Trader authors could answer this better, but....

The Traveller cargo/freight rules were based around tramp traders who are
involved in speculative trade, not freight \'box shifting\'. As a result some
of the smaller ships (eg the free trader at 200 dt) can only really make
money through speculative cargos. Now, this may seem limited (especially by
the rules on pg 122, but earlier versions of Traveller allowed multiple
speculative lots to be available.

I wholeheartedly recommend GURPS: Far Trader for a much better, and in
depth treatment of the merchant rules for traveller. Alternatively, try and
find a copy of the trade and commerce rules from MegaTraveller (the
referee\'s manual pg 46 through 54) as an iterim solution. They should work
fine if you use one of the task equivalence systems out there for GURPS
mods to Traveller task levels.

Marc Miller had a large number of MT books available a while ago (at around
$10 IIRC). His website is linked from BITS (http://www.bits.org.uk/) on the
jumpsite page, and I believe he still sells old GDW material.

Cheers,

I think it would be possible (depends on your reading of the rules) but I
see where you\'re coming from.

The really interesting thing is the paragraph supports the hydrogen bubble
model for jump because it states the J-drive is powered by the powerplant.

 Most people in the \'data and programs are eternally separate\' camp are
 blindered by the fact that the Turing model of computing is so successful, 
so far.
 
 For example, on a more abstract basis, that model breaks down with object
 oriented programming, objects can be data and program. Waaay down at the 
heart
 of the silicon chip, since the Turing Model is hardwired into them, computers
 today make the distinction between executable and data, but what if the 
Turing
 Model isn\'t the only workable one? After all...the human brain doesn\'t
 _appear_ so far to follow that model. If it did, the \'Expert System\' AI 
people
 would have succeeded a long time ago.
 
 And truthfully, modern chips don\'t necessarily make that distinction...it\'s
 been a _long_ time since I\'ve done any assembler (hint: I was using the 6502
 instruction set ;-) but most modern register based chips only have a flag bit
 to say whether a register holds an instruction or data, right? If something
 could manipulate that flag bit like you or I wiggle our fingers, well, then 
it
 might be pretty darn easy for \'data\' to be treated as \'executable\' and vice
 versa, ESPECIALLY if while wiggling your finger you were physically
 rearranging the circuitry.

The Khandi Man has been identified as a devil by the Church of the White
Tooth.  White Tooth doctrine warns that the Khandi Man can be invoked by
saying his name three times (or five times) while staring into a
mirror.

That could make a good non-canon campaign for Traveller or 2300 AD. 
That could be an interesting approach to writing a novel:  run the
campaign, keep good records, then write the novel, making changes as
needed for dramatic purposes.

The best way to learn any language or accent is to date a native

instruction.)

Again, try running it as a campaign and have your players generate
characters.  The way they play their characters will show you some new
approaches to the way people behave.  That\'s important for a writer, I
think:  to be observe other people carefully and write about people
different from him or herself behave.

Why bother with 1KT fuel rocks?  You\'d need dozens of \'em.  Better to make one 
big station with 30KT tanks; it saves on the traffic nightmares.

Thing about it is, your way does an end-run around the bridge rule of 2% of ship\'s volume to control the ship.  A 20 ton bridge on a 30KT boat don\'t fly; there\'s not enough control over the boat.  I calculate stuff on the *final* tonnage.  And yeah, a 50KT rock is gonna *NEED* that P1 & M1 to move back and forth between the 100 diameter limit.  Otherwise, the travel times increase to days & weeks, and you\'ll need more stations.  It\'s easier to keep track of 3 big stations than it is to keep track of *dozens* of 1KT rocks, especially if you\'re a Free Trader.  Traffic isn\'t as congested.

Cause you want it at the 100 diameter limit.  You *could* put it over a high 
hydro planet, *if* you\'ve got one handy.  But if it\'s populated, there\'s the 
possibility, microscopic as it may be, of an accident from a fuel skimmer.

With a GG, you crash, you\'re just out the skimmer & a couple men.

Safe jump distance from a large GG is on the order of 10 million clicks.  You 
know how big a 50KT shell of *ANY* kind looks at that distance???  Trust me, 
you\'d wanna shoot the ice chunk right down their throat or chance missing it 
by a few thousand klicks.

I see yer point.  It all depends on how jump drives work IYTU.  In CT, the whole game is built on \'black box tech\'.  You had stuff that worked.  *HOW* it worked wasn\'t explained, just that it did, & here was its game effect.  Little attention was paid to physics, since it was *JUST* a game.

IMTU, the theory behind jump drive is known, but only a handful really *understand* it.  It\'s a variation of the old \'you don\'t need a PhD in electrical engineering to turn on a lightswitch\' handwave.

 That could make a good non-canon campaign for Traveller or 2300 AD. 
 That could be an interesting approach to writing a novel:  run the
 campaign, keep good records, then write the novel, making changes as

Good advice. The New Jersey Devils ignored that advice, and lost

In the last AD&D game I played we (as a group) spent a couple of weeks
(gametime) chasing a ship called the \'Scarlet Herring\'. The GM made a run
for it when we realised the play on words.

It seemed plausible at the time as some of the other vessels in port were
called things like the \'Blue Mullet\' and the \'Yellow Swordfish\'. The
\'Scarlet Herring\' seemed to be the most suspicious.

get assigned where their Emperor needs them.  A citizen could do a stint in

In this version, the direction of North and south varies with longitude, 
so the "top" of a hex is usually not due north, but at some angle to it.
It\'s easiest to see in the triangles that represent polar regions. If
horizontal lines represent lines of latitude, the length of a line from a
given point to the pole appears greater at the bottom corners of the
triangle than it does in the middle, while on the globe the distances are
the same. Directions for east and west are reflected accurately on the map
but distances are not. The correction for true east-west distance varies
with latitude.

As far as I can tell, the only people who don\'t know how our brains work are
those who haven\'t bothered reading the textbooks, or those that  have, and
then for some philosophical or religious reason refuse to accept what they
have read.

The questions you\'re saying we can\'t answer above are not the _how_
questions, those are already answered. it\'s the _why_ questions, we can\'t
answer, and we have some damn good hypotheses/heuristics even for those,
though a truly correct answer to a "why" question.would need complete
enumeration of the current annd all the historical states of at least the
local universe, so is fundamentally impossible to answer.

It\'s pretty damn simple to understand how the human brain works, in general.
What we don\'t have is an accurate model of any individual brain such that we
can usefully predict it\'s behaviour when subject to any stimuli. Some
reactions to particular stimuli we have modelled accurately enough to be
generalized to most humans though, such as the effects of optic nerve
signals for instance.

Even the model is not fundamentaly difficult, it\'s just complex due to the
massive pararellism ( I know very few people who can handle parrallel
calculus, and I can only just deal with it ). But we don\'t need to be able
to mentally follow it if we can simulate it, but simulation  requires tons
of processing power, far more than we currently have.  In order to
effectivley simulate a human brain to the required degree (as opposed to
just mere AI which is already being done every day in your PlayStations ) we
need processing power of the same order of magnitude of the brain we\'re
trying to simulate, preferably a bit more for data collection and simulation
management.  As even the best computers we have today ( such as IBM\'s
teraflop machine) are about as complex as a smart insect, we have aways to
go before we can carry out that simulation.

>Most people in the \'data and programs are eternally separate\' camp are
>blindered by the fact that the Turing model of computing is so successful,
so far.

It\'s also the _only_ model of computing available to us. Frankly I haven\'t
heard of any other models. There have been a few attempts, but they all
could be shown to just be special cases of  the Turing model. Neural nets,
for instance, are based on the Turing model as much as your hand calculator
is.

>For example, on a more abstract basis, that model breaks down with object
>oriented programming, objects can be data and program.

Not at all.  Objects can conceptually contain  data and methods, but the
object itself is just a data structure, in other words, it is data, pure and
simple. One or more of those pieces of data happens to be references to
executable code.

For that matter, executable code is just another form of data, except when
it is actually being executed.

>Waaay down at the heart
>of the silicon chip, since the Turing Model is hardwired into them,
computers
>today make the distinction between executable and data

Actually, they didn\'t.  The majority of systems determine whether a
particular byte/word is executable or data based on the context of the
currently executing program. If the processor expects, due to it\'s context,
an instruction in the next byte, it will treat that byte as an instruction.
If it turns out not to be an instruction, ( i.e: it doen\'t undrstand the
op-code ) it will jump to it\'s exeception handling location.

It was only when memory management units were integrated into processors
that this became slightly true. It was, and is, up to the OS to distinguish
between data and code, and until Unix (or for the wintel people, until
Windows NT ) most of them didn\'t  do a very good job. An on-chip MMU means
that the OS can have help in labelling what is executable and what isn\'t,
but even then that information is still stored in memory.

One could talk about instruction cache\'s and pipelines, but even there,
allthough the decision has been made prior to loading that this is
executable data, it\'s stilll data until it is actually executed.

> but what if the Turing

It _does_ appear to do so. Again I suggest you read up on the subject. And
ignore Roger Penrose, he\'s out of his field, and does not understand comuter
science very well, if at all.

>If it did, the \'Expert System\' AI people

They _did_ succeed a long time ago, way back in the late seventies early
eighties.
Unfortunately, most of what they could do with the available machines was
too limited to be of any real use, and funding was largely discontinued.

A register has always been able to hold either data or an instruction in
every machine I\'m familiar with., including the 6502 family
A register does not carry out any execution, so as far as it\'\'s concerned
it\'s completely irrelevant whether it\'s holding data or instructions. It
cannot distinguish between a binary sequence representing an opc-code and
one that doesn\'t.

on

I don\'t see why. All it takes is the people like yourself to accept that
we\'re _not_ talking about  _real_world_ "TL16" computers, because your
entire argument is based on that false premise.

We are talking about computers in a game that have been labelled "TL16", and
which aren\'t particulalry advanced compared to real world computers.  Hell,
our current 1999 computers are approximately TL14 or 15 (based on the stated
performance and size characteristics of these computers in Traveler)
already.

So when we are talking about Virus, we\'re talking about a system that could
invade modern computers and the ones we\'ll have in ten years. _not_ a system
that could invade the sort of "computers" that we might have after 2000
years of further development. (as if there will be anything even remotely
like a computer or a modern human being by then)

>At least no one\'s tried to convert anyone to a hamster via e-mail yet....

You obviously don\'t read the witchcraft groups.
<grin>

The problem you\'re having stems from the fact that Traveller _does_not_
represent a realistic extrapolation 2000 years into the future, it
represents a slight capability increase to 1970\'s technology populated with
1970\'s American cultural stereotypoes, and a few nods at what we\'ve acheived
since the seventies.

There\'s a good reason for this, most modern players would be unable to play
in a realistic extrapolation, as it would be so completely alien in _all_
ways ( not just "computers" ) as to be unworkable. A realistic future
simulation game might seem to us to be more like playing a fantasy game, and
it  would be very hard for modern humans to even understand the information
pumped at them.

I recommend Queen of Angels by Greg Bear for a _mild_ version of this.

As a small illustration of this point, I will mention some _existing_
technology that does not appear in Traveller, and the widespread use of
which could dramatically change how we interact with people even in a few
decades.

IBM scientists developed a couple of years ago something known as a PAN or
"Personal Area Network" that has devices attached to items of clothing or
your body communicating with each other via the body\'s own bio-electric
field. This system was powered by the wearer\'s movements.

They then used this to exchange electronic "business cards" between two
people by _shaking_ hands_.

I can give you a hell of a lot more detail on this if neccessary, but that
alone should be enough for the people here to extrapolate on.

credit, they can line up speculative goods for you (warehousing is a mere
Cr2/dton/day - G:TFT p66). At skill-13 on a WTN 3.5 world, they find goods
on a 7 ... if you visit the place once a month, the odds are strong they\'ll
have something waiting for you, and checked out at least some potential
markets (OK, theres a chance of being swindled, but life\'s like that ...).
They can also stay on planet, waiting for those phone calls from buyers
after the ship comes in, the cargos are loaded and unloaded and the
contracted ad agency gets to work <note to GMs ... have the Ad agency
demand a couple of points per skill level, just like Brokers do>.

Small Markets and Overcapacity : When I say small markets, I mean *small*
markets. Flexos looks to have 2 6.5 routes going Rimward (to Collace and
Dallia), which means they produce about 1750 dtons of cargo going rimward
per annum. This is 30 dtons a week. If 2 tramp traders turn up from
different directions, then things either get sorted out, or one of them
isnt going to make it\'s payments next month. Now, it\'s in the short term
interest of the world to let them cut each others throats to get
*something* going out, because this will mean the freight price goes thru
the floor but this will mean the planet gets a bad Reputation (hey, thats a
neat idea ... planetary cultures and starports get Quirks and stuff. Gotta
write up G:T Corporations ...), and traders stop turning up, and small
worlds *need* the tramps.

Therefore, the starport authorities should either expidite a market-sharing
arrangement, or assist either or both captains in finding a speculative
cargo, or both.

Note that markets without any routes have only tramp traders, so freight
rates for what cargo is there are at full \'tramp\' rates - Cr 650 per parsec !

Corporate Structures :

<note to GM : only let em use this if they have Finance and Accounting skill>

If you own a ship, spin off a second unrelated company. This formnally
independant company then leases the ship off the first company. Because the
mortgage is owned by the first company, the second company is unencumbered
for purposes of borrowing money, and thus doesnt cop a -1 DM for having an
outstanding loan (that loan belongs to the first company, which merely
shares directors with the second company). You could also shift assets
between the two companies for when you need the same item to serve as
collateral for two (or more) loans, but thats getting into the matter
discussed on p46. Shifting the profits around might be a better idea, by
renegotiating the lease agreement when you need to shift profits around in
order to make sure the Annual Income turns up on the balance sheet of the
company that is about to go for the next loan.

Going LIC without the Hassles

<note to GM : see above)

Having His Mag as a shareholder has it\'s advantages, but it also leads to
that boring oversight thing. The correct method is to create a number of
subsiduary companies (one per planet), and have them wholly owned by the
holding corporation, which is a Limited Imperial Corporation. This way, the
books of the LIC are nice and simple, while each of the subsiduaries can
bask in the warm glow of being wholly owned by a LIC ("Arguvid Trading,
part of the District 268 Company LIC"). All the Ministry of Commerce gets
to see is a bank draft for their 2% of the dividends, plus an Annual Report
that says "Arguvid Trading remitted a profit of KCr 332, with KCr 219
retained. Shoshane Development announced a loss. Snellmore Group remitted a
profit of KCr 26. Total revenue of D268 LIC was therefore KCr 139, which is
hereby remitted to shareholders". Let em audit that ...

Market Manipulation 

<note to GM : if you want to do something right, do it yourself. Dont hire
PCs to do this ... see sidebar p112>

This is probably most effective when trying to destroy the value of a
stock. The easiest company to destroy is your own. If you arrange to lose
money in a given year, then for the investigation of a board director, then
negative press should follow, then the value of the company\'s stock should
head towards the cellar with all due speed.

All this bad news should result in very little competition for any
newly-released shares, which could be useful to push the ownership level
back up to over 50%.

The offending director can then be released, profits pulled back from the
hollow logs in which they were stashed, and positive press arranged.

Of course, if you notice being done to another company, then it could be an
excellent time to grab a strategic stake ...

   From a business POV, measuring the actual value of a starship
is a tricky problem.  If you could measure it on a given day (how?) 
you might find that it goes up and down depending on events (Hours 
on the jump drive, new models in competition, changes in trade 
patterns, etc.)  It\'s common experience that starships decline in 
value with age. (Well, OK maybe yours is a classic that\'s worth 
more to the local antique dealer than you paid for it,  but then 
it\'s already  an exception.)
  This decline in value with age is a cost of doing business, and
has to be be measured and accounted for. You usually do not find
out how much the starship changed in value until you actually
sell it, but the change in value occurred over the whole time it
was in use, not just on the day you sold it.  Businessmen prefer
to keep track of costs as they occur but don\'t want to try to
track the value of their assets from day to day, so they guess.
Depreciation is an estimate of the change in value of an asset
with an expected finite lifespan longer than the accounting
period, and different methods of depreciation are different 
ways to make this estimate.  Which method is "best" often depends 
on other factors than how well it reflects actual value at any given 
time.  The most important criterion may be "simplest" , "looks best on the
financial statements", or quite commonly, "reduces your income tax most".

WTH uses the regular Traveller unfolded icosahedron as the world
map and divides it into 500 hexes. It has rules for size and
density; temperature zones; figuring percentage of land and
water; sizes of tectonic plates, oceans, continents and islands;
Some on placement of terrain, and optional rules on atmospheric
composition.

One thing to be aware of is that you cannot trace a flat map onto
a sphere, or the reverse, without some distortion. The best you
can do is pick what kind of distortion you can live with and
where it occurs. WTH appears to imply the simplifed projection 
that has already been discussed on the list.

There aren\'t any. David Pulver was advised that the physics behind them
were becoming less and less supportable (although they make great brakes),
so he didn\'t use space for them that could go to something else. There was
a pretty good article about magsails in Roleplayer #29.

M.A. Lloyd did a version in his Vehicles additions, which should be in the
SJ Games archives.

Hmm, that\'s debatable. I\'d say _most_ of the programs are learned
behaviours.

The "hard-wired" stuff isn\'t all that hard wired, either. It\'s like you\'re
constructed with an EEPROM containing a few "programs"
(or to be more accurate, your neural net is constructed with some
connections and weightings already in place ).
Later trainings can actually modify the "pre-programmed"  ones.

Actually, we are pretty sure.

"memories" as in "digitized pictures of human faces" have been stored and
recognized using neural nets as long ago as 1987.

As all human memories are based on the equivalent of digitized information,
"digitized" via our senses,  it is highly llikely that humans use the same
process, especially as such a process would explain why destruction of large
amounts of brain materiel does not neccessarily destroy memories, each
memory is overlaid over the whole net, probably using an approach simlar to
redundant quad-tree compression, thus can be fully  recovered from a much
reduced set of the net.

To be honest Bloo, with the diversity of Traveller system players on this
list, I would assume that Marc could farm out to volunteers willing to take
on compiling rules for T4/5 as well as for all of the former systems to be
placed on their own CD\'s (most list members would do this gratis, just to be
mentioned in the credits!), and therefore be able to sell them at a
reasonable price.

I for one would love to own CT on CD and would think many others would also.
Then there are those who want MT, and T:TNE, etc...  After the rules CD,
there are possibilities for the Supplements and Adventures and select (if
not all) of the Magazine articles.  I\'m sure there is a market if the work
is done by dedicated volunteers (who could do it for a credit listing and
are often more capable at this kind of thing than those who do it for a
living -- the work of love concept).

Just continuing a thought from you Bloo

Here in Oz, we have the Red Backed Spider, a relative to the American Black
Widow, but not quite as poisonous as the BW.  I grew up hearing how deadly
it was (as antidotes of the time were rare -- so it did hold one of the
deadliest spider titles when I was a child).  I also recall a song about
them by an Aussie bushie...

There\'s a Red Back on the toilet seat,
when I was there last night.
I didn\'t see him in the dark,
but boy I felt his bite!
And now I\'m here in Hospital,
a sad and sorry sight.
And I curse the Red Back Spider,
On the toilet seat last night!

That\'s the corus, I don\'t recall more of the funnier lyrics of the verses.

Sorry I can\'t tell you to sing it to the tune of "Old Smoky" or "Age of
Aquarius" or what ever, it is a kind of folk song here now with it\'s own
tune

Back in an old CT campaign I once ran, the PC\'s had an extended
"Serpent-Class" S/C (I think it was called... from Scouts and Assassins?).

They had found a deserted Zho base somewhere in the Spinward Marches fought
their way through the automated security, managed to open those doors you
don\'t imagine they would open (operable they were, you just underestimate
the players ability to do so -- an otherwise pleasant surprise when they
show you, you were wrong).  Basically, they went through a load of sh...
errr, bother to find a handful of Zho BD and weaponry, and three damaged
security/warbots.

They weren\'t stupid enough to want to keep and use the Zho equipment in the
Imperium (facing questions they didn\'t care to be asked as the base was in a
restricted area), but they figured they could sell it on the black market.
But the bots were toys they felt they could use after an assassin nearly
took them all out along with their vessel (but that\'s another story if
anyone wants to hear it).

They figured they could repair the bots, keep them hidden on board the ship,
possibly disguised as something else, but after they fixed them, they would
work on how to hide them.

Well, the engineer/mechanic/computer wiz (I don\'t recall Robotics being a
skill back then?) was the guy with the best skills to do the job, so he set
about the task, taking up a workbench in the engine room.  He managed to
bypass some security circuits and fire one of the beasts up.  However, as it
had to reconfig it\'s system due to the damage it had suffered before the
PC\'s found it, it just hovered there for several moments.  After a couple of
minutes, the PC started tweaking other settings/switches/buttons which
caused the thing many conflicts that it could fix itself, but needed about
15 minutes to sort out!

The player also found that the Zho code was well beyond anything he was
capable of, and he figured the thing was really broken and went to get a
coffee, he would come back with the drink and fiddle some more, hopefully
learning something as he went.  While he was away, he stopped to tell the
rest of the group what had happened and what he was going to do, so
40-minutes later, he returned to the engine room to continue to tinker with
the new toy.

But in the mean time, the bot had finished scanning the local and rectifying
conflicts caused by our engineer (I worked on the assumption that these
programs a rather huge, yet still reasonably quick to self diagnose and self
repair -- this was the far future).  Anyway, it was a black ending for
several PC\'s.  The poor bewildered engineer didn\'t even see the warbot
hovering above the powerplant and never knew what hit him (IIRC, these
things packed a large punch, especially against unarmoured humans?).
Another player "suddenly became suspicious" and I allowed him to go to the
first PC\'s assistance.

*Zap*

Two PC\'s down!

This time a third and a fourth decided they would go to the aid of the first
two.  #3 opened the door, looked in and about and moved into the engine
room.  Moving slowly, carefully, looking about for the bot...

*Zap*

Three down!!!  #4 punched the stud and closed the door, not seeing where the
shot came from.  Then he opened the door again, but the bot had a bead on
the door and as soon as the PC stepped in...

*Zap*

Four down.  The Ship\'s Captain (PC #5) decided to lock down the engine room
and get to a friendly port alive.  Two of the four PC\'s died on their feet,
the other two died over the following 24 hours.

The silliness?  All PC\'s going to the aid of their friends went in with
T-shirts and shorts for armour, none took weapons (not that that would have
helped).  And each PC saw that it only took 1x hit to take out the man
before them, yet bopped on in anyway!  What did they have available?  At
worst, their own personal armour and weapons, at best, the Zho BD and
weapons (although, I don\'t recall if there was any limiting factors to it\'s
use... this was some time ago).

The Captain ended up hiring a handful of NPC\'s and four new PC\'s to clear
out the bot from the engine room.  They sold the other two on the black
market and what was left of the "rogue" for parts!  Funny, at the time the
players were pissed (mainly with themselves) about losing their characters,
but when we catch up and talk games, we have a laugh if this comes up in
conversation  :^)

I dropped out of the debate for a while to make sure the proposal
my job depends on got out.  You went jogging.  You win in the
"has a life" contest!  :-)

I was refering to you post, which I deleted so I can\'t go back
an refer to.  I didn\'t look at it carefully, but it was my
impression that a high jump ship in HG can still come out
ahead with disposable drop tanks.  But I just skimmed it
and you were a bit terse, so I didn\'t wan\'t to commit myself.
(I worked through it all in GT, but I don\'t know the HG rules
as well :-).

Well Hans, I never disagreed that if if piracy was unrealistic,
then it was indeed a problem.  (Of course that "if" lies the
basis for all those post.  :-).  That is why I mentioned
the bit about "feeling each other\'s pain".  (As our glorius

Well, I wouldn\'t put a jump station outside of a gas giant.  I
would put it next to the main port.  But in any case, you basic
point that space is big is correct, but the enduring lesson
is that it is _hard_ to hit accidentally from any distance.

The ice chunks would be "caught" and put in orbit around the
main world for later use.  You wouldn\'t be trying to catch
them just before use (which would require knowing when you
were going to jump months before hand when you "threw" them).

McClellan wasn\'t a "bad leader" as such. He was a superb admistrator
and extremely charismatic leader. He single handedly rebuilt the Union
Army after 1st Bull Run and turned it into the war winning force latter
wielded by Sherman, Grant et al. However he was not a field commander
and more than that, he knew he was not suitable to command an army
in the field. He strongly recommended that Lincoln did not put him in
command of the Army of the Potomec. However Lincoln ignored his
advice and put him in command anyway. McClellan was a staff officer
par excellance who was placed in a command position he knew he
could not fufill.

Amour seems to be mostly to prevent you from taking damage from
small ships.  It is hard to effectively armor yourself against
a ship of similar size and still have any decent acceleration.

This is, AFAIK, to prevent combats from bogging down as ships
plug away at each other without effect.

  On which note it should be pointed out that people who find the critters
from the movies Alien, etc., too wimpy for words can check out real danger
by reading Christopher Rowleys SF in general, but his "Vang..." books in

  Trips more often that every two weeks - would your players freely choose
to not make 30-35 trips per year if trying to make a profit? As traders can
carry passengers and earn more KCr/Dt in OTU, why would this not be reflected
in some way in revenue projections? And of course the "real" ship cost implied
by the discount for series ship production reduces the single biggest expense
(mortgage payments) by 20% - not counting this in assessing the profitability
of a hull size/performance envelope is at least faintly bizarre.

  Correct; IIRC the assumption of premium rates is a proviso that I\'ve
included in the discussion. To attempt to discuss the economics of the
Traveller universe (which is, at least allegedly, fictional) in a serious
fashion without that consideration seems pointless.

  OK - I\'ll make a 37.5 Kt fuel rock; but I shan\'t build a station that pays
through the nostrils for a huge source of EP\'s that it doesn\'t need. BTW, it
may be apparent that HG2 is not the best design system for what are much more
nearly industrial facilities than spacecraft.

  As for traffic nightmares, frankly I think the issue is going to be made
worse by having huge traffic volumes going to as few large stations as is
possible; in this respect B:5 is a fairly poor idea.

  Well, if there\'s only H2 in the GG, then we can rent space to researchers

>Thing about it is, your way does an end-run around the bridge rule of 2% of
ship\'s volume to control the ship.  A 20 ton bridge on a 30KT boat don\'t
fly; there\'s not enough control over the boat.  I calculate stuff on the
*final* tonnage.  And yeah, a 50KT rock is gonna *NEED* that P1 & M1 to move
back and forth between the 100 diameter limit.  Otherwise, the travel times
increase to days & weeks, and you\'ll need more stations.  It\'s easier to
keep track of 3 big stations than it is to keep track of *dozens* of 1KT
rocks, especially if you\'re a Free Trader.  Traffic isn\'t as congested.

  The fuel tanks aren\'t attached to the station; the station has a fully legal
HG2 bridge allocation - although the gods (G.O.O.\'s, etc.) know what it is or
what they do with it. M1 isn\'t needed; a specialized pusher tug can provide
fractional (well, micro...) G\'s as desired - we\'re doing corrections and long-
term adjustments here, not trying to render dinosaurs extinct*.

        * hey - this has weapons possibilities!

  We seem to disagree about what\'s most efficient for minimizing traffic issues
but you\'ll concede that one of the two approaches should work?

A gas giant is about the best place to fill up your tanks.  No pesky aquatic 
natives around to give you any grief.  Thing is, though, there\'s not much 
water vapor percentagewise in a gas giant\'s atmosphere, so you\'d likely be 
shipping LHyd not ice.  Unless of course you come up with a good way to freeze 
LHyd and keep it solid for a couple years or so...

That still means a lotta tonnage flying around in various orbits.  The easiest 
way to deal with it would be use low-energy Holmann transfer orbits.  Maybe 
*your* ship is leaving right now, but the iceteroids now leaving the gas giant 
will fuel somebody a year or so from now.  *SOMEBODY* will buy it, and any 
shortfalls in fuel can be brought up from the surface of teh main world.

Thing is, you can do this stuff.  You just can\'t do it dirt cheep.

Beats me, but then, like I say, I\'ve not seen anything to contradict it in the 
rules.  They flat out say the going rate is 1KCr/ton (CT/HG, dammit, *NOT*

A lotta that would depend on where the main world is.  If it\'s within the 100 
diameter jump limit of the star, or it\'s a moon of a gas giant (both of which 
have happened IMTU, IMCA, btw), then it takes a bit *longer* to get to a safe 
jump point.

Well, I *did* see a design for a 50 ton orbital tug in a High Passage once.  
Can\'t remember which issue, though.  Course, to move a 37KT rock, you\'d need a 
*BIG* tug...

Depends on how big each ship is rather than how many ships there are.  a 20KT 
freighter is less of a traffic nightmare than 100 Free Traders, though they 
both add up to 20KT.

Just as long as those tanks *STAY* disconnected from the station.  No physical 
connections.

So how big is your tug, and did you remember to allocate enough bridge space 
for it?

Too small to be a dino killer.  You\'d need something on the order of a couple 
cubic clicks moving on the order of 35-40 klick/secs.  37KT ain\'t much at all. 
 I\'d tell ya how big it is in real world radius, but I don\'t have a calculator 
around at the moment and I\'m too burnt out to deal with one anyways.

\'Working\' was never the question.  Expense has always been the question.
