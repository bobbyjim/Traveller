Depends on the version of Traveller :-)

I did once look up the specific volume of L-Hyd in the CRC databook at 
work.  I\'ll try and find the data again tomorrow, but it is somewhere 
between 13.5 and 14.

Hmm...I admit, I use this system - although there was one memorable 
occasion where I totally forgot to roll the dice before I started the 
\'GASP! Oh dear, that looks bad\' routine that comes next.

As the person who originally asked the question about being honest

stuck to the rules about stat division when using the MT task system. 
Any takers?

for a true 3-dimensional \'fighting sail\' feel (Wooden Ships, Iron Men,

I understand this, although it\'s unfortunate.  Folks should want a system
because it\'s the best system possible, not because that\'s the way it\'s
always been.  But like I said, I understand.

<cough> Well, um, actually, this is exactly what I did.  I completely threw
out the current task system and created my own.  For any given skill level
vs. any given task difficulty, I determined how hard it should be and
expressed it as a percentage (ie, a ratio).  I then mapped the effects of
having above/below average characteristics and other modifiers (being
hasty/caustious, not having the right tools, working in the dark, etc.)
onto that.

So I wound up with a series of tables and a bunch of modifiers that dictate
*exactly* how hard I think each task should be.  It\'s very simple to
understand and use.

So why haven\'t I posted this to TML or sent it to you?  Because it\'s a
percentage.  It requires 1D100.  I don\'t think this crowd could stomach
that.  And it has incremental skill levels (ie computer 4.3) to provide a
smoother transition from level to level.  I *know* this crowd couldn\'t
stomach that.  And most folks won\'t like looking up numbers on a table (the
tables map to exponential curves, but most of your T4 audience won\'t want
to fool with the math behind them either).

So you (Marc Miller) are left trying to use an artificial mechanism to
squeeze the percentages you want into a certain curve.  That\'s very hard to
do.  I wish you luck.

So don\'t change anything.  Referee\'s with any spark of imagination (this
list is full of \'em) will modify your system to fit their needs anyway.
Don\'t worry about it and spent your precious time working on something else
(like a better Starships book :-).  Maybe some of them will write JTAS
articles with alternate task systems, giving other players even more
choices.  That way you don\'t have to rewrite the "official" rule book.

First of all, characteristics can range from 1 to 15. In the character
generation system it is very easy to get characteristics above 11.
Character generation includes both positive and negative modifiers to
characteristics, which spreads the expected values considerably from the
initial 2 die roll. It is not correct to base the range in characteristics
on the probability distribution of a single 2 die roll. Characters in my
campaign which were generated with the T4 generation rules have
characteristics from 2 to 15, though most are in the range from 4 to 13.

Secondly, skill levels are both non-linear and don\'t have as wide an
effective range as characteristics. Characters typically have many skills
at level 1 and only a few at level 2 or 3. I have fewer characters with
skill 6 than I do with a characteristic of 15. This is not some aberration
of my campaign, it is the way character generation in T4 works.

Even if the range of skills and characteristics were the same, they would
still not be evenly weighted. There are fewer characteristics than skills,
and each characteristic applies to more tasks than each skill. Getting a +1
Dex (for example) will add around two dozen total points to your target
numbers. Getting +1 in a skill will add only 1. Moreover, there are many
game mechanics that use characteristics but do not use skills. In these
cases skills have no benefit at all. It is not valid to ignore the effect
of characteristic rolls and personal pools when comparing skills versus
characteristics.

>The only reason Dex 7 and skill 4 vs Dex 11 and
>skill 1 is seen as a problem is the desire to
>see skill weighted more heavily than stats.  But
>that is matter of personal opinion.

It is not merely an "opinion" that the current task system is unbalanced.
Let\'s compare a Dex 7 skill 5 and a Dex 11 skill 1 character, since they
would take the same number of rolls to generate. If you go through the T4
rules and calculate the target numbers, personal pools, and DMs for these
two characters you will discover that the Dex 11 character is far more
powerful in every respect, except for the target number the Dex 7 character
has skill 5 in, and in that case they are tied.

Yes, in my personal opinion, I would like to see skills weighted more
heavily than characteristics in task rolls, since this would allow players
to choose between a character that is good in many tasks (high
characteristic) or excellent in a few and poor at most others (high skill).
I think this would add an interesting tradeoff to character generation and
provide a more varied mix of character types. You may disagree.

A separate issue is the fact that, in T4 currently, it is as easy to get a
characteristic increase through character generation as it is to get a
skill increase, and the benefit of a characteristic increase is vastly
greater. This is what I see as a problem.

It looks like character generation is not going to change appreciably, so
how to make Traveller characters behave the way they should becomes a task
system issue.  With that in mind, the question becomes how many things
should a superior character be better at, and how easily should they
achieve that mastery.

When I went to HMC, I was amazed at the number of things that the typical
student was good at, compared to students that did not have the stats that
the HMC students did.  (I am not going to argue what those stats were, just
that the entering students for a technical/engineering school with a rough
selection process tend to have higher EDU or INT stats...)

For example, almost all of them were musically inclined.  Most had some
feeling of history, and virtually all liked all sorts of sciences.  When
they took into classes in other fields outside the sciences, they tended to
do very well.  What they could not do, though, was outperform people who
had been in the field for years after taking just one intro class.  They
often could skip prerequisite classes, but they could not jump straight
into graduate studies.

So, I have no problem with stats being a big influence, and a high stat
leading you to success in more fields, I just cannot believe a system that
makes a high stat so incredibly superior to years of training in so many
fields at once.

The current system leads to both of the following situations:

A PhD (12 EDU) Psychologist with a one year course in Botany is as good as
a high school trained (EDU 8) forest ranger field botanist who has spent
five years building up a skill 5.  Clearly, the advanced education will
make them more capable of learning, and will give them superior research
skills, but it should not make them that much more effective.  I could
believe a one year course making him better than any other one year
trainee, and better, even, than man experienced two year people, but I have
met and worked with too many academics in the business world to believe
that the high EDU gives them much more than that in an area outside their
specialty.

From a different perspective, a three term character starting with EDU 7,
which is the average, has 19 skills.   Should they take graduate work, or
just do a master\'s degree to get a target number of 13 in various business
skills?  Said character could have either EDU 12 + 14 skills 1s, or they
could have an EDU 9 + 4 skill 4s.

(I think this should be a hard choice, as the first character would have a
wide range of skills, which the second character does not, but the second
character has a very credible amount of skill.  While the adventurers do
not know their own stats, the world as a whole produces people who have
used the system as best they can.  Consider: 1 in 36 people will have an
EDU 12, while I suspect far fewer will have stuck with a five year
intensive program in a single skill.)

As an aside, you have said several times that skills and stats will vary in
roughly the same proportions, thus a 12+1 being equivalent to an 8+5 is
fair.  Based on a quick check of the tables, the average character is going
to have attribute 8+/-3 after generation, and will either have skills of
1.5 +/- 1.5, based on several dozen characters.

(I did not work out the underlying probabilities of hitting a given skill
slot once, twice, and so on, during chargen, and would not mind seeing such
an analysis.)

Across a spread of characters, the range of characteristics will be at
least twice as big as that of skills.  Further, they will have a lot of
skills which they will have at base level, so the character\'s real
capabilities can be determined almost entirely by the characteristics.
Skill is a much smaller influence, as you can describe a person more
completely with "fast reflexes" than "good pilot".

Gurps works this way, while Ringworld went in the opposite direction.  It
is not necessarily bad, but it is different than classic traveller, in
which high levels of skill were meaningful.

Put me on that list also.  MT was the best task system Traveller ever had.
I will accept (and expect) a revision of the current system, but it should

Second (or third) that.. using a skill that I\'m very familar with, Rifle, I
can bring about the following tasks:

Rifle and Strength:  Firing the rifle.  (Str should be the controlling
attribute for gunfire, BTW.. every firearms course I\'ve taken or taught
puts the emphasis on controlling the gun through firm grip and bracing.)

Rifle and Dexterity:  Clearing a malfunction (On a Spectacular Failure, the
weapon has jammed; this task is the attempt to quickly put the weapon back
into action.  A SF here mean the weapon is truely screwed, and needs a
gunsmith.)

Rifle and Endurance:  Fire in a timed match.  (Basically an endurance test,
timed matches are a bitch.)

Rifle and Intellegence:  Figure out the operation of an unfamilar piece.
(Never assume that all rifles are built the same.. if you don\'t know to tap
the forward assist on a M-16A1, you\'ll get a schock when it jams after 2 or
3 rounds.)

Rifle and Education: Identify a weapon.  (As a both a gun nut and history
freak, I can pick out odd weapons on TV, know what I\'m looking at at
gunshows, etc..)

Rifle and Social:  ID showpiece weapons (A Hi-soc gunman will probably know
the difference between a Gridlore Technolgies "Rajah" Hunting Rifle and a
FS copy.)

One skill, six tasks, and that\'s just scraping the surface.

This is easy to remember, and makes for a natural progression if you find
the need to go even higher  ("you are trying to explain to the Emperor why
you had thye Iridium Crown in the sack?  OK, Fast-Talk for 31...")

I\'m not sure if this is a good idea.. I tend to tell my players that a well
rounded character is more enjoyable than a monomanical one-skill monster.

 The best way to achieve this is the use of "skill

Never really liked the 2300AD mechanics, so I have to vote against this.

I don\'t understand why people dislike the idea of dividing characteristics
by three to get the DM.  I\'v ealready jotted down the ranges, and have a
space on the character sheet right next to the characteristic for them.
example:

STR  8/+2
DEX  C/+4
END  5/+1
INT  7/+2
EDU  2/+0
SOC  9/+3

So if this character had Rifle-2, his final skill would be (using Str) 4.

A freely available language, written in C, that is available on most
platforms.  The strong point that makes it useful for this is that it has a
fairly rich set of data types, including dictionaries which allow
acceptably fast storage/retrieval of worlds by hex and sector.

Check out www.python.org for details.

The benefit is that since there are versions for Linux, Sparc, PC, and Mac,
I can write a script without really having to worry about what platform I
am using.

Certainly, certainly.  When it is done, I will be glad to send it on.  The
present one that can split the large file into small ones, and that can get
a few summary statistics on pop and TL is only about 100 lines of Python,
and I suspect a pro could drop that significantly.

Pass one is the easy one, as it is pretty much deterministic.  I am still
trying to decide how best to do pass two to produce a fun universe.  I
think I know how to do the clustering in a good way; create the total
population first, place it on the worlds where it survived, and then figure
that it will be rare to go beyond a few jumps, but I am not convinced that
what I have scratched together will make sense after a few passes.

FWIW, PE used three jumps as a magic dividing line, and so I only need to
analyze all the "good" worlds in pass one, and then all worlds within three
hexes during pass two.  Probably, I should set up trade routes for PE at
this time.

Oh dear.  My sincere apologies.  I cannot find the page I was referring to
now, but I shall give a look and post the proper credit when I can again
find it.

The page I am remembering included a world generation page that gave a life
rating for the planet, plus suggested shuffling the order slightly on the
various stats generated.

FWIW, I have mostly put together a different system, which will give me
more planets with standard atmospheres and 1G gravity on the surface.  I
also am fiddling with the PE rules to make resources the determining factor
for Ri/Po and infrastructure the factor for In/Ni, so the trade codes all
stay derivatives of the UWP.

This is waiting on my finishing my sector mapper and getting the first beta
to the half a dozen people who wanted it.  I can now at least generate the
executables for both Mac and Win, so there is some hope that it will go out
soon.

Hmmmm...industrial catalysis on that scale would need the same kind of
infrastructure that IC engines would, I think. On earth, both were
outgrowths of the Industrial revolution.

Alcohol fuel, OTOH is available at quite low TL\'s, as all it takes is
knowing the fundamentals of distillation, and wood alcohol (methanol) or
grain alcohol (ethanol) are very easy to make this way.

Ethanol gives you the added benefit of being an instant trade good, too

Do they possess navies capable of standing up to those of the Imperium
(details from the Frontier Wars are sketchy at best)?  Since larger
ships (which generally survive longer in combat) require much time and
resources to construct, do the Vargr even have such large capital
ships?  Or does their society\'s constant state of flux mean that few
such ships are ever completed and retained by their packs (ie: if
packs are constantly dividing and reforming, where do all the large

Well, according to my handy Merck\'s Index, H2 has a density of 0.07 g/cm^3
at it\'s boiling point, going up to 0.076 (or therabouts) as a solid. I
doubt that they store H2 in solid form on starships given the pressure
requirements, so I\'ll use the bp density figure.

A displacement ton is defined as the volume that 1000 kg of LHyd takes up.

So, therefore, 1 Td = 1000 kg * (1000 g/kg) * (1 cm^3/0.07g) *
(1m^3/1e^6 cm^3) = 14.28 m^3. So the FFS figure of 14 is actually the
correct number if you round to the nearest whole m^3.

Haven\'t a clue where they got the 13.5 m^3 number, but by the definition,
14 is the correct number, and the number SHALL NOT be 13.5 UNLESS thou
proceedest on to 14. 15 is right out! 

A displacement ton of LH2 in the form of water, on the other hand is a bit
harder to figure out. One displacement ton of H2, purified (we\'ll assume
we mean chemical, not isotopic purity) is 1000 kg * (1000 g/kg) * 
(1mole/2g) = 500,000 moles of dihydrogen.

1 mole of water = 1 mole of LH2 = 18 g

500,000 moles H20 * 18 g/Mole = 9e^6 g water. Fortunately, water is
another of our great constants so that 1 g H20 is 1 cm^3, so 9e^6 g H2O =
9 m^3 of water. 

Unfortunately, that 9 m^3 of water weighs 14 times what the hydrogen does.

Amazing what lugging around useless oxygen will do!

What do you mean a simpler fix, it introduces a whole new concept of
\'Experience Level\', and doesn\'t use the same number of dice as printed
in PE or the Screen.

This suggestion was made to try and provide a compromise between those
of us who want to see a new task system (which weights skills more) and
those who did not want to change the system (not that they were happy
with the system, but because it would conflict too much with published
material).  Thus in rare burst of insparation I devised this minor
alteration.

Personaly, I would like to see the system used in T4.1 which:-

Valued Skills more highly than characteristics.
Used Characteristics at their full value (i.e. not devided by any
number).
Easily described (i.e. fits on a single sheet of paper).
Was simple to use, both in combat and out of combat.
Was consistant.
SF chance increasing with difficulty.
SS chance decresing with difficulty.
Feels like Traveller.

I know KBv2.0 meets this, but so does T4/T4.1 (with my mod above),
however some of the other suggestions made on this list don\'t.

I\'m just glad that Marc has taken this oportunity to consider the system
he is going to introduce, and I hope that he can come up with a
solution.  But no matter what is developed as the Oficial system I will
probably use a hybrid of my own (since it is impossible for Marc to
please all of the people all of the time).

Well, this is debatable since you dexterity doesn\'t tend
to decrease until late in life (after retirement) and children
aren\'t usually doctors.  In any case, even if it were the
case I would say that someone who is totally mediocre is
hardly doctor material either (not without a lot of training
at least.

Deckplans allow 20% slop, and you worry about a piddling 50 m^3? :-)

Well, this might be an additional point (though is would still
reinforce my point about not comparing absolute values) except
that I don\'t agree that skills are going to follow that
distribution.  The fact is that, while the rolls follow
the bell curve, purchase of skills is on a linear cost
(rather than a diminishing return).

In any case, you would still have to take into acount that
stats trail off at _both_ ends of the range rather
than just one.

I agree that skilled professional should depend on the target
number, rather than the skill level.  This is how other games
that use skill+stat systems define such things.

In 30 T4 characters generated, Even allowing 1 skill per term to be picked,
I\'ve NEVER seen a skill higher than 5!!! NEVER!!! The skill levels I have
seen tend to cluster around 2, +-1; just more of them than in previous
editions.

The fact is that if 2.8% of the characters start with
stat of 2 and 100% of them start with a skill of 0.  Then
for most players the range for stat is not down to 2 but
it is down to 0 for skills....

I agree that is it shouldn\'t be very easy to get characteristics above

See my previous post...
  Characters typically have many skills

Well, yes it is.  Everything said here is an opinion.  Additionally,
the above comment was directed at the point that some make that
someone with training should be able to beat out someone with
talent (No matter how hard that talent is to get).  That is
also definately an opinion.  There are a lot of skill+stat
systems out there and many of them are very popular.  It
would be arrogant to call all of them broken.

I agree this is a mistake.  I would say that a simple
change would be to require a player to save up two or
three rolls that could be applied else where to make
one roll on the stat table.

One of the
Controlling         Number of

==========          =========
STR                     7

EDU                    37
SOC                    12

INT is so high because it is listed as a possible controlling attribute for
skills all over the place.  It certainly *seems* less balanced than TNE on
first glance.

I just put them side by side on the character sheet and run my finger up

nature.

That\'s true, and it bothers me too.  Increasing the number of fudge dice
doesn\'t solve that problem either.  I checked as high as 7 and the jump
from -1 to 0 was still about 44% to 58%.  I still use Fudge style
resolution for the quick and dirty rolls, reserving a more detailed
Traveller style resolution for cases where the difference in a point makes
a big difference.

Yes, the difference should be very easy to see.  The difference is 42%
compared to 58%, and a 16% difference is quite significant.  If we go from
2 to 3 dice, though, we do have a 50% breakpoint at 10- or 11+.

Personally, if we move from a variable number of dice to a fixed set, I\'d
prefer using 3 dice over 2. The range of probabilities is much better.

pretty happy with my version of TNE, but I can\'t resist any 
longer.

My personal perference would be for a TNE style D20 system, but 
mainly because the way tasks divide or multiply assests means that, 
unlike systems that add or sutract DMs, even experts can fail average 
tasks, and novices make very hard tasks. The effect of the success 
levels in 2300AD and MT is why I don\'t really like the task systems 
in those games.

IMO the variable dice system of T4 and variants (including the 
KBv2.0) recreate this nicely, but it\'s also important that SS and SF 
chances change with either the task\'s difficulty or the overall 
success chance (as they did in MT and TNE).

I do belive that stats are overly important in skill based tasks, as 
the one time I played in a T4 game my sniper with a Dex 7 (from 
ageing) and skill 6 was out classed in his specialty by a pilot with 
a Dex 11 and skill 3. Fortunatly we went back to MT\'s task system and 
I could actually claim to be a master shot and not get laughed at by 
the young punks. Even TNE\'s system can get this way, and IME it\'s not 
as pro-stat weighted as T4 is.

For those who are interested my TNE system down-rates the importance 
of initiative, and uses T4 style variability of stat. I\'m thinking of 
altering the importance of stats, as well.

I\'m pretty sure from my MT days that 13.5 m^3 was used because MT 
used 3 m as the vertical distance between decks. Given 3 m high decks 
13.5 m^3 gives two of the standard 1.5 m^2 grid squares per 
displacement ton.

IIRC FF&S used 2 m^2 grid squares and a 3.5 m deck seperation. This 
gives one grid square per displacement ton (and about 3 m between 
decks for neat access ways and crawl spaces).

	Bit presumptuous to redefine what we all want to talk about? I disagree
with the starting point, myself; I have never heard Marc come out and say
that since the debate began. And arguing in favor of it doesn\'t mean you
necessarily support it. I\'ve often continued to argue pros about something

	Actually, I was thinking the other night of a series of cards I\'d really
like to see (and I abhor CCGs): "special encounters," sparked by a
description of a critter in an SF book. I envision a deck of cards, each
with a detailed creature on it, including stats, artwork, behaviour, etc.
Then, when you roll (or decide) an encounter, instead of having to haul out
the main book and generate the creature, or pull out a laboriously-created
world-specific encounter table, you shuffle the deck, and let the players
"pick a card, any card ..."

	It would be a great way to harness some of the creativity here on the
list, of the folks who don\'t have time to write up full adventures, or
detailed economics rules, or lavishly-detailed ship designs. And those
people don\'t have time to come up with all kinds of novel,
"sense-of-wonder," critters.

	In addition to animal encounters, you could throw in a few terrain
encounters. A separate deck could be kept for NPC encounters. Done
properly, you could even use the cards in some sort of stand-alone game,
while keeping them useful with Traveller.

	Something like this is what I\'d like to do for my own universe, anyway.

	I disagree. Dexterity is probably a very UNimportant skill for most
doctors. My dad\'s oncologist is valuable because of his experience and
knowledge--he\'ll never touch a scalpel. The ER resident who saw my dad
recently didn\'t need his dexterity for anything other than maneuvering
around the electrode leads--again, his intelligence and ability to put
together clues to diagnose the basic problem were important. The
gastroenterologist who confirmed and sharpened the diagnosis of a
perforated esophagus not only didn\'t need his dexterity, but wouldn\'t ever
have performed the surgery. The thoracic surgeon who was consulted is the
ONLY person for whom Dexterity might have mattered ... except they decided
not to operate. Again, it was skill, intelligence, education. Going on in
this vein, the opthalmologist who checks my eyes doesn\'t need high dex. The
general practitioner who might put in minor stitches needs decent
dexterity, but not really high. And on, and on, and on. I\'d much rather
have my dad\'s emergency handled by somebody with a wide base of knowledge,
understanding of how the body works, and the ability to put seemingly
unrelated pieces of the puzzle together, than some magic-fingers. The magic
fingers would have jumped on the obvious diagnosis of heart attack (chest
pain, left side spreading up to left shoulder and arm, numbness of the left
arm/hand), missing the other indication (abdominal pain). Instead, the
doctor analyzed EVERYTHING, and put the pieces together correctly
(perforated esophagus leading to air, food, and fluids contaminating the
chest cavity; critical danger of septic shock and massive infection of all
major organs).

	And he could have done that confined to a wheelchair like Stephen Hawking.

And what Task Library would this be? It sounds like you\'ve built up a

Yes, but is that training that grants "skills" or training that grants
"stat bonuses"?

Thank you for your email. What I have to trust is that after I come to a
decision, I will be able to withstand the flames.

Meanwhile, I had a reasoned (voice) discussion with Kenneth Bearden about
tasks, and it helped a lot. For one thing, he expressed the opinion that T41
(being a complete rewrite) (correct me if I misstate you Kenneth) deals with
a wider range of skill levels than Classic Traveller, making at least some of
the discussion moot.

Meanwhile, thanks for your kind words.

Hmmm... if 0 translates to "Illiterate" (I assume that the "Braindead"
term was not to be taken _literally_), negative stats will be
necessary to describe individuals under the mental age of, say, 5.
"Illiterate" might be better off at EDU=1, with "Childlike" or
"Instinctual" taking the place of EDU=0.

IOW, what exactly is the definition of each stat at rating 0, and how
does a rating of 0 compare with slightly higher values (it obviously
can\'t be a linear scale)?  The answer to this question might require
more thought than you might think.

Out of fairness to people possessing stats at the lower end of the
spectrum, I think it is unfair to view 8.3% of the general population
as "Impaired" (based on using 2d6 at age eighteen to determine
character statistics).  Descriptors such as "Impaired", "Lame",
"Anti-social", etc. would be better off administered as character
"disadvantages" (like in the GURPS or Whitewolf system).

Your comment implies that the restriction should be max skill level cannot be
more than 2x Characteristic. The problem there is that Medic is associated
with two different Characteristics (Edu and Dex). I suppose we could say you
can have any skill levels you want, but you can only USE 2x the related
characteristic.

Right, the way things are set up it makes sense for players to put their

   And now a word from our sponsors, Tarantino Limited:

Model 3 Gauss Sniper Rifle

An experimental weapon developed by Tarantino Limited several years ago,
only twelve of these guns were ever manufactured.  These were stored in
a warehouse for a short time until they mysteriously disappeared.  None
of the guns has ever been recovered.  A unique feature of this weapon is
the special discarding sabot ammunition developed for it.  DS rounds are
generally not produced for gauss weapons because they are rather
difficult to manufacture.  The weapon was also designed to be used with
an optional cybernetic eye implant which dramatically increases the
short range of the weapon.

this weapon in a discrete location and then ambush the target from long

   When typing e-mail notes, I use Netscape Navigator, which does not
have a spell check capability.  Every so often, one slips through under
my Spelling radar (that little warning in my head that a word looks
wrong).

   If I served up an unintentional pun that in any way served to lighten
the mood of this place, then it was more than worth it.

Harold

P.S.  Please do not tell my players about the cattle prod.  I haven\'t
used it in months (I had trouble obtaining proper replacement
batteries), and I think they have blocked its existence from their
collective memory.

    'body' => 'If you read and digest this post, you will see why the MT system is 
not all it is cracked up to be by many members of this list.

Many of us (me included) look back fondly on this system for the many 
hours of enjoyment it gave us back in the MT days.  But if you look 
at the system with a discerning eye, you will see that the system is 
no better than T4 or T4.1.

Here\'s why.
===============================================================



Problem #1:  The Stat Problem

Your character just finished med school.  He\'s got a Medical-3 
rating.  His Edu is 9, and you are attempting to treat another person 
in your party.

Now, there\'s this NPC medic aboard also.  He\'s got Medical-3 as well, 
but he\'s only got Edu-5.

Both of you attempt the same task (a Difficult  throw to heal 
your party member).  Of the two medics available--with all factors 
being equal, who do you think will do the better job?

Your character with the Edu-9, right?  With all other factors equal, 
your higher Edu should win out over the NPC\'s Edu of 5.

So what would it be?

In MT, both characters have the SAME chance to succeed.  Because of 
MT\'s stat division, both will have a target number of 8+.  Both have 
a 41.67% chance of success.

Now, compare this with KBv2.0.  Under my system, your character\'s 
target number is 18 while the NPC\'s is 14.  Your character will have 
a 90.27% chance of success while the NPC (due to his lower Edu) will 
only have a 55.63% chance.

See the difference here?  The spread between Edu\'s is significant, 
and not accounted for in MT.

This is where the T4 idea excells.  Your character benefit from every 
stat and skill point they have--not just every 5th one.  Their skills 
and stats define their chance of success--not modify a random roll 
like in MT.

T4 got it right.  It only needed a little tweaking.  KBv2.0 is the 
answer.
==========================================================

Problem #2:  Spectacular Success Problem.

Spectacular Success was called Exceptional Success in the MT rules.  
Here, I will call it SS like in T4 for convience.  

There is a problem with it when using the system in conjunction with 
T4.  Under the MT system, SS is rolled when a number is rolled that 
is 2+ points higher than the target number.

Let\'s take our medic from the above example, and let\'s put him doing 
an Average task.

Using the MT rules, his target number becomes 3+.  This means, if he 
rolls a 3, he will achieve marginal success.  If he rolls a 4, he 
will achieve regular success.  And, if he rolls a 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11, or 12, he as achieved spectacular success.

Doesn\'t anybody but me see the problem with this when applied to T4?

The guy\'s got a 8.33% chance of rolling regular success, and a 
whopping 83.33% chance of rolling SS.

That\'s bass-ackwards.

I don\'t have to tell you that you won\'t find this problem in KBv2.0.
=============================================================

Problem #3:  Regular Success

OK, here\'s a third problem with MT.  Let\'s compare our medic we\'ve 
been using to a Medical-1 character.  Both characters have Edu 9.  
Both characters are attempting an Average task.

Our doctor has a target number of 3+.  The Medical-1 NPC has a target 
number of 5+, and this is how it should be.

For our doctor to roll regular success, he needs to roll a 4 exactly. 
 For the NPC to roll regular success, he needs to roll a 6 exactly.  

You might see where I\'m getting at here.

Our doctor, who is much more skilled than the NPC, has a 8.33% chance 
of pulling off regular success.

On the other hand, our NPC character, who needs a higher number to 
pull off regular success, has a 13.8% chance of rolling regular 
success.

Now, we have the problem of the lesser skilled having a better chance 
of doing something than a higher leveled character.

This is due to the bell-curve like nature of rolling 2 six 
siders--the middle numbers are easier to hit than the numbers on the 
end.

Again, you will not find confusing problems like this in KBv2.0.
================================================================

Clearly, from what I\'ve stated here, MT is not the answer.  I believe 
with all my heart that KBv2.0 is.  The only criticism I see about it 
is that it requires too many dice and that it is more complex than 
T4.

First off, we are not talking about that many more dice--1 or 2 at 
the most over T4.

Second, the system is not complicated at all.  I\'d posit that it is 
simpler than MT, and I can express it in one equation:

Target Number = Attribute + Experience

where  Experience = Skill x 3

That\'s not math that is done in combat.  You do it once, write it 
on your character sheet, and then you use that figure to add to your 
attribute--whatever it\'s current combat value.

What is so complex about that?

Simple addition to find a target number...no half dice...good chances 
of success...easy implementation with T4.

It\'s everything that you are asking for.  It does the job, and it 
does it well.

I\'m telling you.  I did my homework with KBv2.0.  It is the best 
system out there for T4.

I\'m not saying that because I\'m pushing my system.  I\'m saying that 
because I spent months devising the best T4 system, and I haven\'t 
seen anything yet that can beat it.

Give it a shot in just one of your games.  It will make a believer 
out of you too.

No.  TNE skill levels are worth about half of a CT/MT skill level.  
That is, a CT/MT level 2 would convert to a TNE level 4--generally.

You can infer this from the rules and game mechanics, but you can 
also look in the back of Survival Margin where it talks about 
converting CT/MT characters to TNE.

    'body' => 'Just some random thoughts on the task system/skill value/attribute 
debate.

First off, let me stand up and be counted amongst those who are 
in favor of Marc\'s tweaked task system for T4.1.  

Here are some of the reasons why:

1) MT seriously undervalued attributes, and I\'m coming to the 
conclusion that most of the house rules I\'ve seen discussed on this 
tend to do so as well.  I started out when the new system came out as 
a confirmed MT devotee.  I\'m becoming less of one daily.  While I 
think that a high level of skill can make up for a relative lack of 
ability, this is generally not the case.  

Count me amongst those who think it makes as least as much sense, and 
is a lot easier to use than the square root of an attribute, or some 
such.  It\'s simple, it\'s elegant, and frankly, of any task system 
I\'ve seen its probably the easiest out there for a new player to 
get a handle on.  <G>

2) I hate to say it folks, but contrary to the protestations of a 
number of people on this list, CT=MT, but CT & MT don\'t translate 
all that well to T4.  

Here are the things that are dramatically different about T4 from ALL 
of its predecessors:
1) Different ship and craft design systems
2) Different combat system
3) Different space combat system
4) Different skill assignment system in character generation
5) Different task system

In light of all the differences before, it is wrong to suggest that 
Skill-1 in CT or MT is equal to Skill-1 in TNE, T4, KB, or whatever 
acronym you care to play with. <G>

Here\'s why:
T4 Character generation tends to give about twice as many skills per 
term as the old CT/MT basic character generation system.  Compared to 
the Mercenary/High Guard/Merchant Prince/Scouts Advanced Character 
generation T4 still gives a player about half again the number of 
skills compared to the older system.  This, btw, doesn\'t even begin 
to take into account the background skills, which are numerous in T4, 
rare in CT/MT.

1 other thing.  The ability to hand pick skills will tend to create a 
situation where a high skill level doubled or tripled creates a 
situation as badly out of whack as most of the T4 task system creates 
in the minds of the skill heavy crowd.  

A doubled or tripled skill level of 9, which is very achievable in 
T4, is 18 or 27.  

The current T4 task system, coupled with a system that gives out a 
larger number of skills, creates a situation where Attributes and 
Skills are BOTH important.  This is IMO, the way it should be, as CT 
& MT both had a tendency to render attributes nearly meaningless 
beyond character generation.  

3) In defense of consistency.

First of all, having been a member of this list for a long time, I 
know how shook up people on the list get when things are changed 
arbitrarily.  The number of people who were irked when MT came out 
and changed the background is legendary.  Similarly, the flame wars 
over the believability of Virus were some of the most vicious I\'ve 
been witness to.  The number of people who were upset when they 
discovered that all their designs, and characters and so on weren\'t 
cross-compatible between CT/MT & TNE is still interesting.

This mailing list, depending on who you ask, has anywhere from 
300-500 members.  Something like 15-20,000 copies of T4 have sold.  
Like it or not, even if all of TML tells IG with one voice that they 
want a specific change to the task system (which has not happened). 
It is still only a tiny minority of the number of people who have 
bought and may continue to buy T4 books.  Ultimately, IG will live or 
die on how well they satisfy those 15-20,000 customers (of which TML 
is, admittedly, a devoted faction).

Now, getting back to my original argument, put yourself in IG\'s 
place.  They\'ve sold somewhere between 5-10,000 copies each of 10 
different supplements to those folks who bought the original 
rulebook.  All of those supplements use the new task system.  All of 
those supplements are built integrally around the new task system.

Now a bug-stomped version of the rulebook comes out.  It says, oh, 
btw, that $250-300 you just spent over the last 10 months is now 
nearly worthless, because we\'ve replaced the task system, and combat 
system, but we know you\'ll LOVE the new one, and its so much 
better than the old one, and eventually we\'ll come out with new 
versions of the old supplements for you to buy to replace the ones we 
just made obsolete.

This stuff goes on in the RPG industry often enough without doing it 
intentionally.  It is very dangerous for a new, relatively small 
company like IG, to promptly scrap the system that they released just 
a year ago, in favor of a new system, regardless of its merits.  The 
possibilities  just because of the possibility of alienating its 
customer base.  IG has released a stream of good to great products 
over the course of the last few months, and is building a good 
reputation that could easily be destroyed or damaged by such a 
blunder.

4) Saying you want a new task system is not a unified voice.

OK, I\'ll admit it.  I haven\'t read every word of every post regarding 
Ken\'s call to arms, but I\'ve noticed a lot of interesting responses.  
Yes, a lot of people on TML have said that they don\'t like the T4.1 
proposed task system.  A minority have said they like Ken\'s system 
intact.  Far more have told us about the variations of the MT task 
system, or Ken\'s system, or their own house rules, or whatever that 
they use.  

It is my considered opinion that probably any task system somebody 
could come up with is going to have a sizable number of people who 
want to "fix" it, because it is "broken."  This is not picking on 
anybody in general, but I\'ve seen about 20 different variations on 
the theme of task system come off the TML in the past week, all with 
variations on their variation of the T4 task system.  Saying you are 
against something is not the same as saying you are for something 
else.  

That\'s my feeling on things.  You can agree or disagree with it as 
you like.

I don\'t disagree.  One might think that intellegence would be a better
base for medical skills.  However, I wanted to make a point about
talent vs skill, not bring up the separate issue of what the best
attribute to base the skill on was.  (In fact, I agree with suggestions

stats based on what it\'s being used for...]

Isn\'t it a bit hard to launch a kite when drifting with windspeed. Lowering
into a lower windlayer might work though. The Swedish arctic explorer Andre
dragged an anchor on the ground in order to use a sail on his balloon (he
was trying to reach the northpole by balloon).

I\'m sorry, I don\'t see the point here.  If assume that stat increases
are training, then the current task system does favor training over
talent that step further.

I agree on that! The trouble with T4 offerings is that the authors seem
never to have actually played Traveller given the amount of canon trashing
they managed to put in so few volumes.

  I\'ve found that treating the grid as 1m instead of 1.5m makes this
deckplan work. I\'ve also created stats and plans for a real 400-ton
version for an earlier phase of the above mentioned Traveller game...
  The DGP version of the Free Trader has the same problem, and the same
fix.
  Worse than GDW, however, was FASA. The various ships in Adventure
Class Ships Vol. 1 & 2, as well as the individual ships released earlier
were bad or off-tonnage almost without exception. The much touted King
Richard, a 5000-ton liner, has almost enough fuel volume to fill a good
sized bathtub. Many of the designs are off-volume by much more than the
Empress Marava, and several break the rules for hardpoints (no longer an
issue, fortunately).

Glenn also said:

I\'ve been using 2D6 with a twist: Whenever you roll 2 or 12 you are allowed
to roll 1D6 and if it comes up as 5+ for 12 (2- for 2) add (subtract) 1 to
the result and keep rolling. So in order to roll 15+ on 2D6 you need to
roll 12 on the first 2D6 and then roll 5+ on three consecutive 1D6 rolls.
It may seem complicated but is actually great fun and only happens
occasionally. I choose 5+ as I wanted that going from 11+ to 12+ and 12+ to
13+ to be the same increase in difficulty (x3 harder).
I find this way of making a "bell shaped curve" more acceptable than the
FUDGE system. It also allows for arbitrarily good/bad rolls.

(saturday the Vargr PC Gvoudzon managed to roll -4 on a 4+ Sensor task. He
was scanning for gasgiants in system and I told him that the background
radiation for the unicerse seemed to be around 300 K as he had failed to
pop up his sensor and had basically been integrating the radiative feature
of the sensor armorcover = I forgot to remove the lenscap :)

  For the game I was in until recently, I produced a set of deckplans
for the (originally MT) 440-ton Corsair. Instead of having a cargo bay
capable of swallowing a Type-S, I gave it an external grapple and uprated
the drives so it could GRAB a Type-S (I prefer to ignore the required

difficult or impossible).
  As for why such ships exist, I defined the original design as a very
early Third Imperium design for a "large" independant freighter that
eventually lost out to the Vilani-designed Type-R. Solomani captains
love the thing even after a thousand years however because the lines
of the ship disturb Vilani architectural sensibilities.  This is
the hull depicted in silouette in the SOpM and in one or two bits of DGP
artwork.  The non-uprated version is common in the Solomani dominated
Marches, but the hull has an unshakeable reputation as a Pirate\'s vessel.
The hull is so well suited to modifications that few pirates can resist
one of these. It has become my equivalent of the Corellian Stock Light
Freighter.

  My version will soon (I hope) be available on a Website I now have under
construction. It will only be in TNE format for the time being, as I can\'t
yet fathom the ever-changing face of T4 ship-construction rules.  More

  CT DID balance things, sometimes to the point of overbalance in the
direction of the skills.  Check the combat DMs associated with each
weapon (Book 1:Characters and Combat, pg 44). To-hit rolls were modified
directly by the skill value, but stats only contributed if you were better
than average. In most cases the stats would penalize your attempt if they
were too low, at least in combat. The effect, however, is that skills and
stats had the same range of effect on the die roll.
  I will conceed that the desirability of balance is certainly a matter
of personal opinion. The last week of the TML proves it...

  In some cases, certainly, but I still prefer the wide open task system
of MT. The task at hand defines BOTH the skill and stat appropriate to
success.  This prevents skill-stat pairs that are ridiculous for many of the
applications of that skill. It also allows the relationship between the
skills
and the attributes to _change_ depending on the situation.

  Gee. Make that one little change to T4 and nearly everyone goes home happy:
The domination of stat or skill is situation dependant, not system dependant.

IMHO the MT task system suffered from the following problems
(not in order of severity):

1 Automatic success on 12 and automatic failure on 2. This rule and all
otherv rules with fixed automishap/success are generally there because the
task system designer couldn\'t figure out a way to generate differentiated
results with arbtrarily low propabilities. OK I\'ll try to play a violin
piece from Paganini: The -DMs and task difficulty would be mind boggling
but I\'d still have 1/36 chance of success.

2 The 3,7,11,15 progression made tasks to coarse you had basically an:
always succeed, 50% chance, always fail progression which was no fun.

3. The time roll. Whenever you roll a task you should be told by the
referee BEFOREHAND how long it will take as the task roll is done at the
end of the task attempt. Joe Bazooka is trying to disarm the bomb before it
goes off (5 minutes). He succeeds at the task but he fails to do it in
time?

4. The Exceptional success thing. Most of the time a Exceptional success
was more common than a regular one! What does Exceptional really mean?

5. Uncertain tasks had entirely different propabilities and outcomes than
regular tasks therefore making it impossible to convert a task between
normal and uncertain. When I tried MT I let the ref roll 1D6 secretly and
the player the other which worked fairly well as I didn\'t tell the player
the result.

6 A characteristic was only interesting as to wether it was a 5, 10 or 15
in value. Anything in between was ignored.

The reason why so many of us talk fondly of MT Task system is that we
really mean the MT days with excellent quality DGP products and good
quality GDW products.

High stats should make the unskilled penalty less severe and also make it
easier to GAIN skills. Enough said.

Agreed. It\'s no biggie. I have a half inch strip on the bottom of the

and Traveller task names. Let your finger do the walking...

I don\'t see the problem. Why is a 50 percentile point on the curve so 
desired? Why should the large jump in the middle of the range be 
bothersome? An average person doing an average task should have a better 
than 50% chance to *equal* Average or do better. He should have a *less* 
than 50% chance to do *better* than he usually does, but not Average. 
Therefore, why do we need a magical 50% data point?

If you really think somebody has *exactly* a 50/50 chance to succeed at 
something, flip a damn coin and move on! ;->

I must point out that the "flaw" of granularity in the mid-range is due 
to the Bell shaped distribution curve with relatively few (9) data 
points. This is a *good thing* imho. If you wanted less granularity in 
the middle your choices are: (A) Roll mitfuls of dice (eg. 7d6) and get 
absurdly low probabilities on the extrema, or (B) Roll few dice (eg. 2d6) 
and get an inelegant (imho) "chevrony" curve.


BTW, if you\'re looking for different FUDGE dice curves, there are 22 
varients ranging from 2DF to D10\'s to D20\'s, along with the percentages 
at:

<http://www.iccom.com/usrwww/bing/frp/fudge/dice.html>

Maybe one of the alternate curves is more to your taste... I think 
2d10.3.1 is interesting... where d10.3.1 = [-2,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,+1,+1,+2]

Agreed. 2d6 gives a chevron, at least 3d6 comes a little closer to a 
regular bell distribution, with more results clustered in the middle.

Careful on the definitions, though. "Normal" tasks, if they are 
"Average", should have a greater than 50% chance for Joe Average to 
achieve. If the difference in feel was superior, it was because the most 
*common* tasks in that scenario were "Difficult" to perform for Joe 
Average...

    'body' => 'The recent thread, Re: Anders FUDGES a Task System, got me thinking whys. 
I began thinking of the "meta-issues" with respect to Task Systems. The 
big picture, instead of getting mired in the details.

Why do I like bell curves? Why do I think FUDGE\'s die mechanic seems 
inherently elegant? Why do 2d6 based systems seem clunky? Why do I 
dislike Die modifiers? Why do I think the Task System as it stands will 
never live up to my expectations?

What\'s a Task System supposed to model, anyway?

And the answers came to me... I hope I can express my thoughts.


Thought experiment: Why Joe is Average
======================================

What does skill level represent? Answer: a general level of competence. 
If Joe is an average carpenter you expect him to do an average job "most" 
of the time. If Mike is an excellent carpenter you expect his wooden 
dinette sets to be of excellent quality, "most" of the time.

You would expect a histogram of the quality of Joe\'s work to be roughly 
bell shaped, with the peak centred on an average quality rating. On a bad 
day, he might have substandard results, on a good day they tend to be 
outstanding pieces of furniture.

The problem lies in defining "most" [of the time]. (sidebar: This is my 
view of what, in general, task systems are designed to define. I think 
Traveller\'s biggest problem at present is defining how to calculate (ie 
define) Joe\'s actual skill level in the first place... Which is why I 
advocate "decoupling" skills and characteristics so that skill level is 
absolute. I digress)

If you\'re modelling Joe\'s "tasks" using a 2d6, with the peak "7" 
representing an average job, I think you\'re falling short the "correct" 
typical distribution. "Most" of the time, in the case of 2d6, Joe\'s work 
is better than, or worse than, his level of competence.

Throw in more dice, say 5d6 or so, and the curve becomes more bell 
shaped, results cluster in the middle better, Joe churns out fewer 
outstanding or crappy works, and more easily falls into his routine of 
churning out average wooden objects.

(Before people rush down my throat and say "But it\'s a game! We want to 
do better or worse than expected or it gets really boring!" I say that 
it\'s more important to have some idea of what to expect. I expect that at 
least, say 60 or 70% of the time, I will achieve a result slightly more 
or less at the level of my competency. That\'s not boring, because the 
exciting part is when the unexpected happens! If everything is unexpected 
or totally unpredictable, then things get unruly and unrealistic. What\'s 
the point of a task system in that case?)


Data points are irrelevant, or It\'s the result, stupid!
=======================================================

Now, with more dice you get a bunch more data points. You can refine to a 
great degree exactly how good Joe\'s work is. But -- most judgments of 
people\'s success are very subjective. It\'s usually unnecessary to be 
overly meticulous about "grading" performance. A task succeeds, or 
doesn\'t. Or perhaps it succeeds or fails spectacularly.

Traveller has 4 outcomes: Succeed, Fail, SS, SF.
The Babylon Project has eight. FUDGE has nine results, or levels of 
success.

The reason why people seem to get hung up on having those data points is 
because it allows "tweaking" with many smallish DM\'s, or it allows 
granularity in defining someone\'s skill level, through a range of 13 or 
so in characteristics, and 6 or more in skills. About 20 data-points!

But does that granularity accomplish anything? Can you really line up 20 
carpenters, and grade them in such a way, where their difference in skill 
is significant enough to require so many data points?


How much detail is required?
============================

OK, so some people like having their skills rated on an exact percentage 
scale down to 4 significant figures. But does that really contribute to a 
better game, or better roleplaying? And others like to throw in a 
table-load of Die Modifiers and so forth. But is that really fine grain 
tweaking necessary just to nudge the probability in the result a couple 
percentage points?

What\'s the point of defining a base difficulty for a task? You want to 
figure out what level of competence is required to achieve success.

You could say, as a GM, "This is a FORMIDABLE task, but since you\'re 
standing in freezing mud up to your knees, and mosquitoes are buzzing 
around, I\'ll give a +3 DM to the roll."

or... "Under normal circumstances, this is a FORMIDABLE task, but since 
there\'s mud and mosquitoes and such, it\'s a STAGGERING task."

Either way, it\'s referee fiat. In the first case, you pull Die Modifiers 
out of the air. In the second case, you make a judgment call about what 
level of competence should be required. At least with the second case, 
you have some idea of what results can be expected. With the first case, 
you\'ve got to do the calculation of target numbers and percentages and 
how much a +3 DM changes things and whether that\'s reasonable... yadda 
yadda


Making a Bell Curve
===================

There are many ways to simulate the Bell Curve. You can use a table and 
straight percentage dice, or determine values required with some other 
combination of dice. You can roll a bunch of dice and determine ranges of 
success.

You make a bell shaped Attribute distribution by rolling more than one 
die, in D&D 3d6 is more bell shaped than Traveller\'s 2d6, but at least 
it\'s a distribution with a peak in the middle.

The peak shifts up a bit, during generation, but that\'s OK, as the 
seasoned veteran is a cut above the rest.

FUDGE works well because its bell shaped task curve is exactly the same 
as the bell shaped distribution of skill and attribute levels. It\'s easy 
to determine the level of competency required, because it\'s exactly the 
same as the difficulty level of the task!


Tieing Apples and Oranges
=========================

There is great debate in the Traveller realm, over this task system thing 
because of two major problems. (My humble opinion, of course, no flames 
please)

1. Skill competency is not absolute

Success at a task depends upon Skill Level and a Characteristic. This 
isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, just a complicating factor. Joe\'s 
carpentry skill level isn\'t an absolute. If he\'s cutting wood, he\'s 
relying on his Dex. In another situation, he could rely on Intelligence, 
or Education, etc.

Therefore, Joe\'s Traveller Skill Level isn\'t really an absolute measure 
of his skill. And great debates ensue over exactly what formula should be 
used to convert that arbitrary skill level and characteristic to an 
absolute target value.

2. Attribute scales, Skill scales, and Difficulty scales are different.

Attributes are rolled using 2d6, making a chevron distribution, 
quasi-bell shaped. Skills are advanced one point at a time, making them 
linear in nature. Difficulty rolls become more bell shaped as more dice 
are tossed at them.

And poor Marc is trying to tie the whole mess together. A daunting task 
indeed!

Everyone is chiming in with their own band-aid solutions, trying to tie 
together these apples and oranges.


It\'s Just a Game, Glenn, Chill out!
===================================

So it\'s just a game. We\'re not trying to exactly model real life. 
Whatever works for ya, works. I\'m just trying to point out that all this 
hubbub over Marc\'s T4.1 solution is really sweating over details which 
inherently don\'t mean much of a rat\'s bottom. The above major problems 
put great limitations on the realism of the system, and the solution is 
purely subjective.

(BTW, I think he realizes this, and points this out from time to time. 
What difference does 10% really make to the playability of the game?)

Although it is just a game, I\'m glad Marc makes an effort to try and 
satisfy us, his customers. And the majority who believe his formula needs 
tweaking.

Me, I shall never be satisfied with the solution, I\'m afraid. I have 
reached a conclusion, had an epiphany, if you will. FUDGE doesn\'t have 
the problems of disassociation between Skill Levels and Difficulty 
levels. I feel it\'s a big PITA to use a non-absolute Skill Rating, that 
doesn\'t correspond exactly with difficulty. That\'s why I\'m rating skills, 
attributes and task rolls in FUDGE terms.

As for the "disadvantage" of not linking Attributes and Skills, I can 
fairly easily decide whether a task should be against an 
Attribute/Characteristic or a Skill. If it seems that it should be both, 
than maybe it\'s two separate tasks, one against the skill and one against 
the attribute. Or maybe another skill should be brought into play.


Well, I\'ve spent far too much time pontificating. I *meant* to catch up 
on my sleep tonight. I hope that I\'ve made my opinion clear, and perhaps 
assisted in bringing this debate down to earth a weeny little bit. I 
sincerely hope that the issue is resolved, and the best compromise 
solution is found and published.

"You can please some of the people all the time, or all of the people 
some of the time, but you can\'t please all of the people all of the time."

Doug (and Marc): Dividing att by three and dropping remainders (fractions)
is how I\'ve run the MT task system in traveller since before it was the MT
task system! (Anyone remember where it came from??? DGP\'s supps and mags
first showcased it thoroughly!)

I would reccomend having the task taget numbers increment in even multiples
of 4 (4, 8, 12,16, 20, 24), and limit to +12 DM (from any combination of
stat mod and skill levels). I HAVE playtested this. My players loved it. It
works well with t4 C-gen from rulebook as written.

BTW, if it matters, two of my players demanded that I ask to have them
added to the Task system list: Erik Pikey (No e-mail); and my wife,
Stephanie Hostman (Kenarik@asylumbbs.com); both vote for Mega-like task
system. If need be, score-keeper can e-mail steph for confirm.

developed their air travel independantly or regressed from higher tech.
The reason I note this is that it is possible to duplicate higher tech
equipment at higher cost and effort at lower tech levels.

  A good modern example of this is the gunsmith community of Afganistan. 
Since the last century, these highly skilled metalworkers have been able
to duplicate modern firearms, up to and including weapons like the Soviet
AK series, using nothing but hand tools and foot-powered lathes.  Now,
even totally modern firearms are arguably not that high tech (aside from
the plastics used in their stocks), but the level of metalworking is
certainly sufficient here to duplicate lightweight steam engines or even
alcohol-fueled IC engines.  This certainly argues for the idea previously
presented of small scale craftsmen making propulsion machinery.

  By the way, there is no reason parts could not be interchangable.
Interchangability is a "soft" technology, and depends on a mindset that
recognizes the need for building in tolerances between moving parts and
using standard gauges.  For example, the parts for weapons the Afgani
gunsmiths make fit weapons made in factories.  Thus, if one assumes a
society where airships are reasonably common and the need to fix them far
from home arrises, the use of standard designs and interchangable parts
is a real possibility.  More likely, though, is that the local blacksmith
would just copy the broken part and send you on your way.

I\'m not sure I follow your point. The *cost* of skills is linear (1
level per pick), but the process of aquiring them is iterative. Assuming
that a player is rolling for their skills rather than picking them, this
means that high levels of skill are a product of a statistically
dependant process. You need to get level 1, before you can get level 2;
level 2 before level 3 etc. If a given skill has a 1/6 chance of being
rolled from a certain table and a player makes five rolls on that table
during character creation then the probability of their character having
no level in that skill is 40%, whilst the probability of their having
skill-5 is 0.01%. The typical outcome of this scenario would be
something like three skills @ 1, one skill @ 2 and the example in the T4
rules bears this out. Captain Jamison has a total of 28 *levels* in
skills, but no individual skill is higher than 3 IIRC (and one of those
is Pilot, which includes a free level for achieving rank O4 in the
merchants).


David again:
<<In any case, you would still have to take into acount that
stats trail off at _both_ ends of the range rather
than just one.>>

Again, I don\'t follow you. The example I used took this into
consideration. A normal distribution groups roughly 60% of a population
within one SD of the mean (and roughly 90% within two SD). Thats one SD
*either way*. So if the mean is 8 and the SD is 3, then 60% of the
population will score between 5 and 11 (8 +/-3) and 90% will score
between 2 and 14 (8 +/-6). Stats *do* trail off in both directions, but
skills only trail off in one direction; that was my point. The
comparison of ranges between stats and skills that you made was not
like-with-like.

introduction of the charisma-altering entertainment video thingie - since
I don\'t have my Traveller stuff with me, I can\'t remember what product it
appeared in (Traveller Adventure?  CT Vargr Module?  Cogs & Dogs? 
Something Else?). 

  Anyway, the idea was that a Vargr watching this entertainment thingie
would be programed through subliminal suggestion that some person (Vargr
leader) was "Really Great and His Butt Smells Good" - high Charisma in
game terms - and this thingie thus enhanced the reach of a single
political group. 

  This provides the background of why all the Vargr get together -
they get hooked on these entertainment tapes, or at least a whole bunch of
them do, and they go out and kill Impies.

  As for equipment, well, although we think of the Vargr as disorganized,
there are some fairly large political entities, at least according to the
alligiance codes from the sector data and the info in the CT Vargr module.
No doubt they build big honking battleships just like all the other races.

  On the other hand, the AHL class cruiser that is a trader in Vargr space
has never had to fire its big guns in anger, so perhaps it is really big
by Vargr standards.  Or maybe only rational Vargr get to be in command of
large Vargr warships...

Heres a adaptation of the aforememntioned world.

Megacajoule (Mcj)- v. 1. The action of using unghodly amounts of energy to 
discourage a  munchkin from taking over an entire world, sector, or faction 
through the use of killing off of major storyline characters.  Original use 
was in MT, but has been known to be used in TNE.  2. n. One million

No problems with that scale for Intelligence (maybe E = Outstanding, 
F = Genius) but I have severe reservations about the Education scale.

If Education means the minimum level of Education possible to have 
that qualification, maybe this is a reasonable scale.  It all depends 
on what Education means; I\'ve always seen it as a function of 
ability to learn and study, level and breadth of knowledge, and 
perhaps adaptability of thought/knowledge.  Specific knowledge is in 
the realm of skills.

Formal education produces Education, and technical education skills.  
These two are not mutually exclusive in the same course, but time 
spent on one precludes time spent on the other.  I would like to see 
Edu and skills more of an either/or in advanced (post-18) educations.

Whatever my "intrinsic" Edu on entering college, I will tend to 
either gain Edu or skills.  If I can learn already, I\'ll gain 
background and depth; if I can\'t, I\'ll be taught to learn.  I\'d say 
the average would be +2 Edu / Skill-4, with extremes of +4 Edu / 
Skill-2 (very academic, elite college e.g. Oxbridge, Ivy League, 
Grande Ecole) and +0 Edu / Skill-6 (exclusively technical education, 
purely by rote.)  Note that academic will always include some skills, 
but tech. won\'t always educate.

Note also that +4 or higher Edu gain is possible in character 
generation in a year, so I don\'t see why college can\'t do it...

Note that if college provides an educational benefit of min_Edu 
(i.e., if your Edu is less than the min., you receive the min level 
of Edu, so an Edu 6 Masters student would get Edu 8 on completion)
rather than +n, college becomes attractive only to the low-Edu, which 
seems perverse!  I don\'t believe an Edu 6 student can become Edu 8 on 
a course which an Edu 8 person doesn\'t gain a point or two of Edu (in 
or out of the classroom).

IME, an academic post-18 education provides:
Edu
Specific skills
Social skills and contacts
"Hobby" skills

in something like that order.  I think college should have a Social 
table as well as an academic one: you can be good at your major, or 
you can have a life as well...

I cannot tell you how much I hate this.  I really think this is a 
totally false picture of advanced education, in all respects, and 
I fail to see how it improves the game.

First of all, there should be "social" options -- perhaps rolls on 
the appropriate tables from the Scholar career?

Second, I hope "major level" means skill+stat in the Major -- 
although it ought to be more or less automatic to have such scores.
Under *no* circumstances should it mean skill level in the Major:
higher degrees are not only about ability in a single field of study, 
let alone a monomaniacal concentration on one area.  (Not that you 
don\'t need the former, or some of the latter.)

To put together a PhD thesis, you need Research, maybe Writing, and 
appropriate skills for the topic.  You will have developed a number 
of skills of greater or lesser direct relevance.  You\'ll have been 
exposed to politics, bureaucracy, and scarce resources.  What I 
estimate I gained from mine was:
Research-1, Computer-1, Science-1 (Physics? Chemistry?), 
Instruction-1, Guitar-1, +1 or +2 Edu, Diplomacy-0, Fast Talk-0
and I\'m sure I needed Writing-1+ for my thesis.  Only the first 3 
were directly relevant to my work...


Thirdly, replace Performance by Bureaucracy skill -- far more likely 
to be developed in the course of a Master\'s degree.

I really hate the idea of a PhD (hons) but since it\'s science 
*fiction* I\'ll let it lie...

My quote, and some other agreed, was;

>>Personally I could never figure out why the Imperium would allow
>>construction of a purpose-built privateer in imperial shipyards, capable
>>of hijacking entire 100ton vessels whole hog (in addition to other,
>>strictly paramilitary modifications).<<

I was speaking of circa 1100 Imperial space, the only "real" wars of the
era (in the Spinward Marches) were with the Zhos, whose patrol ships would
make mincemeat of the corsair as designed, and could detect and outrun the
same ship easily by the rules of that game (CT).

The Corsair is a ship purposly designed to be able to capture Imperial
shipping (Type S mostly) and outfox imperial navy patrol vessels by
concealing its identity.  Zhos are unlikely to be fooled by such tatics,
assuming the prevalence of psionic navy officers implied in that era.  Some
have suggested "pirate shipyards" build them, which I find unlikely within
Imperial borders, others refer to privateers and letters of Marque, but I
find almost no opponents likely to be damaged by such a policy (except
perhaps the Sword Worlds - a good candidate for such tactics, but hardly
worthy of building an entire class of ship to defeat).

In the end, the corsair must be seen as a pirate vessel pure and simple,
and pirates in general do not have the resources or need to design and
build such a ship (much easier and cheaper to modify an existing ship
class).  In addition, governments do not generally condone the construction
of pirate vessels in their own shipyards.

Now, there is a significant likelyhood that the Vargr *would* build such a
ship in large numbers and export them to Imperium based human outlaws.  The
vessels would not be sold at your neighborhood Stermetal dealership though,
and would be an adventure in itself to acquire.  Oh, and if one arrived at
a starport where a closer look could be taken, seizure would be the norm.
("Oh and what do we have here...Nuclear missiles too! how nice of you to
drop in!")

All in all, the thing worked OK if you did not require the "big picture" to
be too focussed, which I think is an appropriate attitude for CT.  In the
same way the AD&D world could not usually be justified economically.  The
corsair, and most CT designs, were never meant to stand up to the harsh
light of economic analysis , they were meant to be fun and interesting from
an individual perspective.  Now, though we have the corsair in a T4
adventure...Ok, but I\'ll look at it as a Vargr made Import.

It really wasn\'t until some later supplements and, really, Megatraveller,
with its volumes measured in kiloliters and cubic meters, its specific
numbers of gas giants and planetary belts, and the somewhat more scientific
approach to space combat, that a hard look started to be taken of the
larger economic and other realities of the Imperium.

Something gained, but something lost.

Fortunately, the King Richard\'s ship stats has little or nothing to do with
any of the funfilled adventures which take place onboard her.  The deck
plans gave me quite a laugh when I saw them though.  5000 tons indeed!

Don\'t let the above keep anyone from picking up the aforesaid adventure if
available (for under $10 or so).  Its value is in the NPC descriptions and
descriptive sections of "The Most Luxurious Liner in The Galaxy".

I had expressed an opinion about the current task system and said that I 
would vote for a change similar to MT.  But having lurked for a while 
regarding this thread and seen all the argument sides I would like to hearby 
change my vote.

Before it was for MT.  Now it looks like I might be siding with the 
improved, tweaked T4.1 system.

It seems there is a new character creation process somewhere, where can I 
get a copy?  Must have missed it in the inrush of TML\'s lately :)

The old version in T4 I was using did not utilise the university or school 
process, basicaly like the Old CT/MT which made characters with skills and 
stats that were (somehwhat) compatable to MT.  This may have created my 1st 
opinion.  But if the CharGen system is going to be atuned to the T4.1 
system, then yes, I will use that system.

Yes ladies and gentlemen, he CAN be taught! :-)

It looks like T4.1 will work out after all(with some tweaking).  My vote is 
with the Marc group.

Oh,  here\'s an idea I got from one of my players to reduce muchkinism. 
 Instead of rolling for stats, where some people may tend to "luck out" with 
the dice, have them generate stats with a point based system.  I think 50 
points is a good number, it averages to about an 8 per stat with 2 left 
over.  Sure you can have a 15(F) STR but the other stats will slight for it. 
 This could be an \'optional\' generation meathod. Hell, that \'fantasy game\' 
has got 6 meathods to roll stats!  :-)

Yes, in my private collection are deckplans for the MT corsair. It was made
by looking at the few pictures of the ship that I know about, but I had to
make it somewhat longer than the silhouette pictured in Starship Operator\'s
Manual. It still has the same silhouette and look of the corsair, though.

The deckplans are fairly datailed and my players are quite happy about it.
Would people be interested in seeing them?

This is a problem, indeed, but there have been many suggestions for

7 and someone who has Edu 8??? I guess not!
Also it would be a possiblity to make ExSuccess Easier for those who 
are closer to the next "switch". Taking a three-based system, someone 
who has Edu 6 would be right on the switch, getting +2 on his task 
and +0 on ExSucc. Someone with Edu 8 would get +2 on the task and +2 
for ExSucc! That would take into account the difference in ability!

What exactly do you define as SS? Exceptional to me always meant: 
Better than average success.If something is very easy for somebody it 
is much easier for him to be "better than average". 
Example: I am fixing a stardrive that is broken. That should be a 
difficult task in all books!
Marginal Success: I jury-rig it to make the last jump it needs to get 
us home, but then needs general overhaul.
Regular Success: I fix it, and it works allright for a while, a 
checkup would be in order, however since the ride is still not 
without bumps.
SS: I fix it and there won\'t be any problems again for a while. It 
purrs like a kitten again!

Other Example: I want to retrieve information from a database: Should 
be fairly easy.
Marginal: I retrieve some info, but not everything i need!
Regular: I get everything i need!
SS: I get everything i need plus more, some intersting bits and 
something that might help me later!

There is nothing wrong with having lots of SS! If something is this 
easy to do for somebody, he will achieve SS very easily as well. 
After all, SS doesn\'t mean a result that is Exeptional for him, but 
better than average or needed!

I think Kenneth presented an unfair view of the MT task system, it does have

This is an extreme example of the problem of dividing stats by 5 and rounding
down. But you are right it is still a problem. Any system that divides stats 
will suffer this problem, the more it divides by the bigger the problem.
To reduce the problem the problem just divide by a smaller number.

William Hostman suggested dividing stats by 3 and increasing the target
numbers
to keep the difficulty levels about the same. If you prefer you could
divide the
stat by 4 or anything. You can place as much emphasis on stats as you feel 
necessary in your game (just remember to chamge those target numbers :)

This is a problem, but is easily solved make SS 3+ points higher,
or even more if you think SS should be that difficult.

Close, the doctor needs a 3 or a 4, and the NPC needs a 5 or a 6.
Rolling the exact number was a success. Marginal success rules were only used
for ranged fire in combat (The hit only did 50% damage), not in the main task
system.

>Our doctor, who is much more skilled than the NPC, has a 8.33% chance

You are talking about regular success and excluding exceptional success.
The chance of success of any type is 91.7% for the doctor and 83.3% for the
NPC.
the doctor has higher medical skill and a higher chance of success.

MT is simple (IMHO):

2D6 + Skill + (Stat/5)

And that only took me one line!
Stat modifiers can be calculated and written down on the character sheet
and theres no changes during combat because MT\'s damage system
assigns damage to stats after the fight has finished.

MT is also easily modifiable to the individual referees needs,
change the target numbers for various difficulties, change the number required
for exceptional success or change the amount by which a stat is divided by.
none of these required you to change any other part of the rules.

I\'m not trying to say that returning to MT tasks is the way to go forward with
T4, but it\'s not as bad as Kenneth is trying to make out.

J.

p.s. I guess that means I vote for a return to MT.

Given the constraints on Vargr society that canon establishes, it might be
possible, but it wouldn\'t hold together very long. 

Rebellion Sourcebook discusses (IIRC) a technology that was widespread in
the Vargr extents, sort of \'synthetic\' vargr, in entertainment tapes, who
could be tailored to fit their audience quite well. Once that\'s done you
can influence them, quite well. If you have several thousand different
manifestations of the \'same\' vargr riling things up, you could probably
mount such a large scale invasion. They don\'t need lots of capital ships,
since they would probably still run an enormously decentralized campaign;
the invading forces would just flow around big fleets. Sort of a
Vargr-wave/blitzkrieg attack.

If they were riled up to go plunder deep in the Domain, then you could
potentially overrun the domain pretty badly.

How long they\'d stay in control is another thing entirely.

But, (hee hee hee) Non-Vargr pulling the puppet strings of Empire from th
back of the pack, so to speak, could provide the strategic direction and
cohesive loyalty to a single leader. Hmmm, who might be pulling the
strings ;->  

But, at the risk of sounding barking mad, I think the Vargr could give the
Domain a very ruff time if they were organized into such a large pack, and
could hound the Imperial fleet to the very ends of the Domain, treeing
them among the cats, rimward. Ok ok, I\'ll stop, I know this was completely
gratuitous.

have the time to sit and calculate odds and standard deviations and what not.

I do think we are going arround this the wrong way.

Stats represent the nateral aptitude of the person, while skills represent
copentacy in a skill.

Take the old hory chestnut medicine. In Australia , a person needs to be in
the top 1% of the HSC (Leaving certificate or High School Deploma
equivelent), do 8 years of training and university , then intern in a
hospital for a period of time before he/she is legaly allowed to practice
medicine (or apply for a specialty this is where it gets screwy , so I will
leave off here).

So this means by default, the person would have a high EDU, proberbly high
INT (but not nessasary, the criteria here is the abillity to past tests,
not for thinking.) [Sorry Med students]. At the end of his/her training, a
doctor would have a skill level of 3.

A nurse however has an easier time. He / she has to pass the HSC at a
reasonable level, go to Uni for 3 years and get licenced. A nurse can (and
generally does) learn a massive amount of medical knowledge over time (My
father is a Director of Nursing who hasent work a ward for over 20 years,
but he can still diagnose people from rudamentry information and generally
be right). But a nurse can not do certian things that a doctor can,
becauser of legal , ethical and poltical reasons. 

In Trav Terms , a nurse can have any EDU and INT she/he cares for, (higher
the better though, as they too have to past tests). It doesnt mean swat.

So, lets look at the old CT skill levels, where 1 was basic cometency, 3
profesional and 6 was guru propellorhead.

A doctor with INT 10 and Med 3 and a nurse with INT 13 and Med 2 both have
a person sick before them.

Both can make a diagnosis (and in Traveller, with the technolagy of M0, it
should be as simple as entering data into a calculator).

Say the person person had a protrusion in the skull. A Nurse would only be
allowed to either prevent further injury, proscibe pain killers or "assist"
in the removal. Even though he/she has Med 2 , he/she can not do more. If
he/she did, he/she would risk everything (including her job , and most of
he/her assets and her licence) 

A doctor can remove it, and is protected laws to do this (he/she may be
able to over ride the next of kin or whatever). The octor would laso have
financial protection and would generaly only risk his/her job if she riped
the stake out and bludgeoned the patient with it.

So, when we do the nerw task system, lets have some guidelines on what the
skills represent, so that we dont have the Medical 1 vs Mediacal 3 debate. 

Maybe we can have a part in Advanced Chargen listing licences (ie Drive,
Pilot, Medicine, et al) , where a character can be reconided in the
imperium to be able to legally practice those skills, whith lesser skills
representing hobbies, and other things.

Kenneth is right. I\'ve snipped out his reasons, but each of them,
especially #1, "the stat problem," are true. The MT task system did not
account *at all* for stats.

Don\'t make your choice based on nostalgia. The MT task system, while a step
up from CT, was far from perfect.

The best solution is either KBv2.0 or some facsimile thereof that weighs
stats/skills equally or somewhat in favor of skills.

Finally, I\'ve written a brief addendum to Kenneth\'s list of problems:

Problem #4
==========
If you are highly skilled enough at certain tasks, say Gun Combat, you can
achieve impossible tasks that simply should not be possible. For instance,
you have good marksmanship skill, say Combat Rifleman-5. If you roll high
enough on your task roll, using a gauss rifle or whatever, you can
penetrate battledress and wound or even kill its wearer with one shot or
burst.

This should simply not be possible. TNE accounted for this and T4 needs to
find a way or it defies reality too much.

Best,

One of my favorite aspects of Niven\'s _Ringworld_ series is the Machine
People\'s alcohol-fuel economy.  Theirs is pure ethanol, and they\'re
forever helping their clients get past the social crises that ensue when
people discover they can drink the fuel supply...

On the low-tech airship question, I strongly recommend John Barnes\'s
_Washington\'s Dirigible_, sequel to _Patton\'s Spaceship_.  It\'s set in the
context of a cross-timeline war, in which each side interferes with
lower-tech/past alternate worlds trying to \'grow\' powerful allies for the
real fighting up around AD 2800.  In this particular novel, airship
technology is introduced circa 1770 (TL 3ish, IIRC, though rapidly being
manipulated into 4+ in this timeline).

The lifting gas used is "producer gas."  Apparently, if you pass water
vapor over furnace-hot coals, a chemical reaction ensues which yields a
mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas.  This mix is a fairly good
lifting agent, as both gases are lighter than air (though CO not by much).

I usually play that you should get both, in roughly the ratio that they
affect the target number.  After all, people are very familiar with what
works in the real world, at least in aggregate.  If one class helps a lot,
but three are not that much more helpful, you end up with a lot of people
with one class in a subject.

Since I use T=Stat+Skill*3, most of my players who play my (modified)
college career come out with +1 EDU, +2 in major, +1 in minor skill, with
honors adding up to another skill and another EDU.

As I understand it, supplemented by the Traveller Adventure, very few Vargr
bands had anything like a decent destroyer, by Imperial standards.  (A
major point of that was a vargr band about to make the jump from minor
player to major force was building the equivalent of a light cruiser or
large destroyer, and was hunting up weaponry for it.

The corridor fleet, in my universe, was mostly carriers.  Small fighters
and gunboats are usually acceptable for patrolling a system if you have a
tech advantage or if the average target is a civilian or paramilitary
vessel.  As soon as something with decent point defense shows up, you are
doomed, but this is not a common experience.

Scott canon begin: This all changed in 1116 - yes, many Vargr bands started
raiding, but many more saw the implications.  With the Imperium in turmoil,
Vargr could capture systems along the fringes, and possibly even keep them.
 This required capital ships, and thus an accelerated building program
began among certain major clans.  These ships took a good five years to
finish off, but some clans had already started such construction over the
previous decade or so, but had not finished.  This meant a steady stream of
ever larger threats by ever nastier vessels, meeting ever smaller resistance.

Where they fall down is in support vessels.  It is very hard to build a
fleet in a society like that, but it is not that hard to build a single
nasty unit.  Thus, a well run fleet can still expect to flatten a similar
sized Vargr collection of independent ships, but each ship will tend to be
fought pretty well, and quite aggressively.

In my universe, the Vargr could have been run out of Deneb in a fairly
short campaign early on, but they have since had a chance to get
established, so even if you could smash their capital ships, they would
have significant populations left on many planets in Deneb, and most
leaders other than Lucan are a bit loath to start a black war that they do
not have to.

I like this kind of table a lot.  If you include a similar one for the
other stats, as well as one for the various levels of skill, I will be
quite happy.  Having a table like this in the rules is a great idea.

Now, on to the specifics of what is in the table.

I have a minor quibble - the average 18 year old character is going to have
an EDU of 7.  Something like 30% of them have an EDU of >=9.  Is this what
we want, or should there be a corresponding change in the determination of
EDU?

This brings up another idea:  perhaps should EDU start out low, like 1D6+1,
and then get raised according to chargen and background skills, with EDU
being a possible background skill.  One of my players brought this point up
- - regardless of background, it is pretty likely that a Sylean will have a
higher EDU than any person from a TL9 or less culture.  The resources it
costs to give  every Sylean the equivalent of a modern day PhD in
information is likely too trivial to notice - witness the section on
poverty - they all have wallscreens, and have been using databases to look
stuff up for a very long time.

Oh, about 70% Nitrogen, 20% Oxygen,some CO2, and few piddling other things
for flavor, depending on where I live. Higher Oxygen concentrations can
harm or even kill me, depending on the situation. We NEED that nitrogen
for a diluent, even though it\'s toxic, too, at higher pressures. Running
pure O2 at low pressures isn\'t toxic but it\'s one heck of a fire hazard.

The oxygen is \'useless\' in that unless the ship is carrying great hulking
tanks of nitrogen or helium with which to generate a human friendly
atmospheric mix, the excess oxygen is merely a waste product that
generates a severe fire hazard. 

We had a fire in southeastern Arizona a couple of months ago, when a
truck carrying a tank of LOX caught fire in a residential neighborhood.
The truck pretty much melted, as did the 5 or 6 houses surrounding. 

You REALLY want to lug that kind of stuff with you during jump?

This is something I\'ve been considering for an extended M:0 campaign I\'m
writing (and hope to publish).  A Vargr with an extremely high Charisma and
delusions of Godhood proclaims a jihad against the new Imperium.  He
inspires fervent loyalty in his subordinates, who in turn keep the lower
ranks in line.

The image of thousands of TL9-11 Vargr raiders breaking out along the
Vland/Lishun frontier just appeals to me...

That\'s because in MT, the importance of statistics is much less than the
importance of skills in resolving a task. Edu is much more generic than
Medic - it\'s the total sum of a person\'s Education, and includes many, ma=

things that are not entirely relevant to the task at hand. The Doctor mig=

task.

My understanding is that the stat division in MT reflected that
characteristics
were generic in this fashion. Ok, wait a minute, what about the physical
stats ?
Surely they are not generic ? Think again. Consider that using Dex for a
Surgery
task involves manual dexterity. Using Dex as a modifier on acrobatics is
different
entirely - I know of dancers who would never make good surgeons !!!

So ? This is for an Average task, remember. I would expect a high
proportion of results
to be better than regular success with a skill level of 3 on an average
task. You are
confusing/equating the T4 skill level of 3 with the MT skill level of 3
here - they aren\'t
the same. T4 characters often get high skill levels during character
generation, whereas
MT ones do not. The result is that Skill Level 3 in MT is worth more than=

the same in
T4 ; This means that the guy is _very_ skilled in MT and should perform
well in average
conditions. This is why I suggested capping skill levels at 5 if the MT
system was used in
T4.1

No, it just means he\'s good at his job.

You are missing the point ! The doctor has a HIGHER chance of spectacular=

success,
and a better chance of success OVERALL. All that happens here is he has a=

lower
chance of performing in a mediocre fashion, whereas the NPC is far more
likely to
do so \'cos he ain\'t so good. That does not seem wrong to me at all.

No, we have the "problem" of a lesser skilled character performing in a

fashion more often than a highly skilled character. Er ... I don\'t think

What I would dispute here is the plural "skills".  I would say that,
given equal ranges, *a* skill and *a* stat are balanced - but there are
far more skills than stats, so overall a stat has far greater weight.
The system very strongly encourages generalists.

[GURPS suffers from the same problem in some circumstances, but this is
 normally minimised by the high cost of stats.  I know *you* know this,
 David, but I thought it worth mentioning here anyway.]

I would say it is a desire to see skills weighted more heavily in their
limited area of effect to counter the broad effectiveness of stats.
This makes specialists more desirable characters.

> But that is matter of personal opinion.

Agreed.

In another thread, you wrote:

I agree too.  This is, of course, the GURPS approach.

I think in an ideal world, this would be my preferred method of dealing
with the situation.  Although I would (for preference) emphasise skills
a little more anyway, I wouldn\'t be unhappy if that didn\'t happen under
these circumstances.  However, changing the task system is more limited
in scope and appears to be happening anyway; Changing chargen in such a
way opens up a much bigger can of worms...

Sorry if these are old arguments - I\'ve skipped a bit to catch up.

You design it, and I\'ll tear it apart to see if it is a good system.

Or, we can go with something that is not broken...like KBv2.0.

You list some very good reasons why the MT task system is not a good 
choice for T4, but I think you\'ve touched on why so many people are 
looking towards it now.

Many just remember fondly the days of MegaTraveller.  The task system 
was simple, and it seemed to work.

If you look at the facts, though, the MT system has just as many 
problems as T4.

Yes, I did agree with you that if we put skills on a 1-15 scale, the 
rest of the discussion would be moot.

To me, the real problem is the skill vs stats issue.

But, I did not agree that changing the value of skills that radically 
is the best answer.  It seems to be that T4 will become a new animal 
at that point more akin to TNE than to T4.

I personally like CT\'s and MT\'s influcence on T4.  I like being able 
to use my old supplements almost completely interchangeably.

It seems to me that it will be easier to tweak the task system (with 
a system like KBv2.0) and leave the rest of the game alone rather 
than having to create an entirely new task system and go through the 
whole game re-writing all of the CT era rules that are included in 
T4.

I think we should work within the confines of what Traveller has 
given us--that is stats that range from 1-15 and skills that range 
from 1-6 or so.

KBv2.0 is the simplist fix.  I\'m keeping my mind open for other 
systems and fixes, but I keep coming back to the one I designed.

I spent months tackling the problems presented in T4.  I did my 
homework, and I did a good job on the system.

KBv2.0 was specifically designed to make the changes in T4 with a 
minimal amount of changes--keeping the rest of the game as is.

It is still the best choice we have.

Yep, one of the most amazing things I ever saw was on a Discovery Channel
show about railroads in Africa.  A train needed a new hex bolt, so it
stopped in a village, and the local blacksmith, using hand-made tools and
an open forge with a goat-skin bellows (ie TL 1 equipment) made the new
hex bolt in under 5 minutes.  From what I\'ve read, a lot of the less
industrial parts of the 3rd world run this way.  I\'d imagine lots of the
lower TL worlds in the Imperium would run this way too. 

Similar thoughts occurred when I watched a show with a TL 1 sailboat sail
between Africa and India, with a radio and GPS system on board.  Low tech
worlds in the Imperium could be fun places indeed.

1. Why are there short tons (2,000 pounds) and tons (2200 pounds). Answer:
because the 2200 pound measure works better as an expression of 2,000
kilograms. We see the same effect with statute miles and nautical miles.

2. The grid squares on deck plans are 1.5 meters on a side. A cube 1.5 meters
on a side is 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 = 3.375. Four such cubes = 13.5 cubic meters.
Assuming a deck height of 3 meters, that means that two squares stacked with
cubes to a height of 2 equals 13.5 meters or one ton.

3. I think the measure has to be 13.5 cubic meters.

   The conversion process tended to make some characters into
superheroes in TNE who were just good characters in CT/MT.  There are a
few paragraphs at the end of the conversion process that talk about that
subject, and go on to state that it is up to the referee (in
consultation with the player) to take adjustments as required.  One
wonders if Dave wasn\'t rewarding people for converting to TNE...

   Starting from *scratch* with character generation (and having
creating characters in all the various systems), I\'d say that a
character with Pilot-7 in original classic Traveller (pre-High Guard) is
someone who makes Chuck Yeager look like a novice.  On the otherhand, a
High Guard/MT Pilot-7 would be on a par with Chuck, while a TNE Pilot-7
would be just your run-of-the-mill member of an elite fighter squadron
(Blue Angels, Thunderbirds, etc.).  TNE skill levels count for slightly
less than CT/MT, but I would argue the ratio isn\'t 2:1, it\'s more like
5:3 or 4:3.

I don\'t know what other people have experienced, but we just generated 5
characters for a new PE campaign and the lowest EDU any of them had was
D.  Looking over the rules, we concluded that EDU bonuses were just too
damn easy to come by.  We had two characters maxed out at EDU F, and
still getting 4 or 5 gimmes of EDU from skill rolls.

As a result, we decided on a simple patch:

If a character washes out of a higher education path, he or she only
gains +1 EDU, regardless of how many years spent in the path.  To gain
the full EDU bonus, the character must persevere.

Yes, but, that assumes two things about the high tech society:

1. The populace actually use the wallscreens for educational purposes,
and don\'t spend all their time watching the latest holovid soap opera,
or playing Duke Norris Nukem\' in 3D. Brain candy does not an EDU
increase make.

2. Is being able to look info up on huge databases condusive to
encouraging EDU increases? The arguement could be made that High Tech
people become dependent upon their KnowledgeBases, and don\'t bother
actually absorbing factual content.

I guess a lot depends on the definition of EDU, but it seems to me that
there are factors in a high tech society that might impede the advance
of EDU.

As an aside, in TNE, higher tech citizens received an EDU bonus during
character generation...

Well, since raising it one level gets them skill-1, it is for

Because each of those measures was based on a different standard; and then
messed with to match another standard. This is a kludge and a recipe for
confusion.

And in my system of 1 x 1 x 3.5 blocks, we end up with 4 in a square = 14
m^3 = 1 ton.

Arguably the difference is minor (The difference between the two
standards is 3.6%), but it is an annoying one because the
two are a pain to interconvert.
 
> 3. I think the measure has to be 13.5 cubic meters.

Well, then they changed the definition of what a \'displacement ton\' is.

Admittedly, I\'m hampered about CT stuff, and I\'ve done all my design work
with FFS, QSDS, and SSDS (and FFS2, soon;), and they have all defined a
displacement ton as "The volume of one metric ton of liquid hydrogen",
which works out to 14.28 m^3, or rounded to 14 m^3

All of this matters little, UNLESS the NAH is going to come out saying
that a displacement ton is 13.5 m^3. Then, the design system and the
mapping system are going to be based on different $@#!$@ definitions, and
there will be no end of hell to pay from the gearheads on the list.

FOEX, my 200 Td Yugobox design becomes 207 Td under the CT system. While
it doesn\'t sound like much, that changes things for that ship quite a
bit...that\'s three more staterooms that I get or seven more tons of cargo,
\'for free\'! At standard cargo and passenger rates that adds a _lot_ to my
monthly bottom line.

That would make a difference in running the ship, hearkening back to the
"Can a Free Trader Make It in the Imperium?" flamew^H^H^H discussion we
had a while back.

So, we make the change from T4 to MT, and THEN we have to tweak MT.

That\'s backwards thinking.  We need to tweak T4 and be done with it.

I agree with you here.  I think the MT time roll should be 
implemented in T4.  I already use it.

You can _reduce_ the problem by dividing by a smaller number, or you 
can_eliminate_the problem by going with KBv2.0.

Why reduce when we can get rid of the problem all together?

That won\'t fix it.  On your more difficult tasks, because we are 
using only 2 dice, characters won\'t have a chance in hell of rolling 
SS.

Example:

Stat-5, Skill-3 character attempts a Formidable roll (15+).  His 
target number is going to be 11+ on 2  D6.

If we make SS 3+ over target number, this character cannot even roll 
SS.  There is no chance he will do it because he cannot roll over 12 
on 2D6 (modifiers are already figured into the target number).

Of course, with KBv2.0, this problem is eliminated too.

No.  In MT, rolling the target number exactly is called Marginal 
Success.  I stated that in my post.

But, this is moot.  Either way, the lower skilled character has a 
better chance than the higher skilled character.

Like I said, this is moot.  The example still stands.

I do recognize that the higher skilled doctor has a better chance.  I 
knew that when I wrote the example.

My point is that the Med-3 doctor should beat the Med-1 NPC in all 
three areas--by SS, by regular success, and by total success.

Why are we forcing a system that has so many loop holes in it when we 
can go with a T4 tweak, like KBv2.0, and have EVERYTHING fixed?

It doesn\'t make sense to me.  It seems that we are trying to 
institute another system that has to be tweaked as well.

Why not just tweak the one we have?

That, it seems to me, is the easiest approach, and I have already 
done all of the work with KBv2.0.

Well, not quite.  You have to list target numbers too, but I won\'t 
quibble over this.

But, in T4, we don\'t.  Damage is instantaneous.

T4 is not MT.  T4 is CT with tweaks.

T4 is to CT like MT is to CT.  But, T4 is not to MT like either T4 or 
MT is to CT.

If you can follow that confusing line, you\'ll see what I mean.

Why are you trying to replace the T4 system with another one that 
must be tweaked as well?

It is clear that the MT system must fixed to operate well with T4.

Why don\'t we just fix T4 and be done with it?

I\'m telling you, KBv2.0 is the answer.

 Take Carlos 3-based system. Now every third

There is a difference between an Edu 7 and a Edu 8.

It might be a small difference, but there is a difference--that\'s why 
there is a different number in the score.

T4, T4.1, and KBv2.0 all recognize this.  In these systems, you get a 
benefit for every point of stat and skill attributed.

In the MT dividing method, this will never be true.

T4 had it right the first time--the system just needed to be tweaked 
a little.  KBv2.0 is that tweak.

Write down exactly what you are proposing.  Then I\'ll take your 
specific system and show you, specifically, where the holes are.

Then, I\'ll show you how KBv2.0 doesn\'t have this problem.

> - > -> Problem #2:  Spectacular Success Problem.

> Then maybe there should be a 3+ necessary...

That won\'t fix it.   On your more difficult tasks, because we are 
using only 2 dice, characters won\'t have a chance in hell of rolling
SS.

Example:

Stat-5, Skill-3 character attempts a Formidable roll (15+).  His
target number is going to be 11+ on 2  D6.

If we make SS 3+ over target number, this character cannot even roll
SS.  There is no chance he will do it because he cannot roll over 12
on 2D6 (modifiers are already figured into the target number).

With KBv2.0, you don\'t have this problem.

> What exactly do you define as SS?

I defined it, mechanically, by what is in the MT rule books.

Exceptional to me always meant: 
> Better than average success.If something is very easy for somebody it 
> is much easier for him to be "better than average". 

Yes, it is better than average success, but you shouldn\'t have a 
better chance of rolling SS than you do regular success.

SS is when you roll that near perfect roll.  It should happen only a 
fraction of the times that you roll regular success or failure.

I think that most would agree on this point.

 
> There is nothing wrong with having lots of SS!

No.  SS should be that rare time when you roll really well.  The 
perfect hit, the better than average roll.

Your way (and the MT way), SS is the average roll.  

This is wrong for T4.  You should have a chance to roll regular 
success and regular failure.  Then you should have a smaller chance 
(much smaller) to roll SS or SF.

Read the example.  I am comparing a Med-3, Edu-9 character to a 
Med-1, Edu-9 character.

All factors are the same except the skill level.  The Med-1 doctor 
has a better chance of rolling regular success than a Med-3 doctor.

And that\'s just not right in anybody\'s book.

Why is it better than rolling 2-7 dice?


> So youre saying that multiplacation is no math???

I\'m saying that the multiplication in KBv2.0 is done very rarely.  
You do it once--when the character is created.

You don\'t have to do it again until your character goes up a skill 
level.  This will happen, what, once a game year?

In MT, you are constatly dividing stat by 5.  If you are wounded 
(using the T4 wound system, not the MT after the fact system), you 
have to recalculate stats.

This is not necessary in KBv2.0.  You always add your stat to your 
attribute (whatever it happens to be at the time of the task), and 
that\'s it.

In MT, you have a generic target number and skill and stat modifiers 
to make up a final target number.

In the T4/KBv2.0 systems, all of that is done with one simple 
addition:  stat + experience.

walaa.  KBv2.0 still remains the superior system.

It is clear that you did not do your homework.  There are still 
problems with the MT task system.

All I see criticising KBv2.0 is the personal preference of too many 
dice.

There are no areas where the mechanics of KBv2.0 fail--like in MT.

Show me a way that KBv2.0 fails in the game mechanics.

> Ditto. ;-)

I\'ve used the MT system extensively through out my MT days.  I also 
used it as the my task system of choice before T4 came out.

It is not better than KBv2.0 (or the idea behind the T4 system) for 
the fact based, game mechanics reasons I have listed in my post.

KBv2.0 doesn\'t have these problems.  It is simply the best Traveller 
task system designed to date.

I also like the table.  Having this might cut down on some of the 
"definition" arguments we have here on the TML and take a lot of the 
subjectivity out of exactly what an EDU 7 means.

I second Scott\'s recommendation that this is done for the other stats 
in T4.1, but I would also like to see something similiar done for 
skills.

Something like:

Level      Definition
=====     ========
1             Novice
2             Skilled
3             Professional
4             Expert
5             Master

etc.

Eris has listed a good description of what skill levels should be 
defined as some time ago.  I remember agreeing with what he had to 
say.

Maybe if we ask him nicely, he\'ll repost it.

How about it Eris?

I agree that the system should it more difficult to get a stat
than a skill.  After all, it is a more fundamental number.  But
to me this is clearly a change for the character generation
system.

Exactly, it makes stats harder (more costly) to get.  I amazes me that
some claim that any system that uses stat+skill must be "broken" since
so many very decent systems work this way.

I don\'t know that it has to be so hard.  Just stat that you have to
save up 2 or 3 normal rolls to get on roll on the stat table...

Exactly the point.  In T4, stats were valued too much.  In MT, stats 
are not valued enough.

KBv2.0 weights them equally.  That\'s how it should be.  One part 
natural ability and one part experience.

OK, let\'s look at the same example but change the skill level to 1.

Average task.  Stat-9.  Skill-1.

Character needs 5+ on the dice.  If he rolls a 5 or 6, he as rolled 
regular success.  If he rolls a 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12, he rolls a 
SS.

That\'s about a 25% chance to roll regular success and a 42% chance to 
roll SS.

You said that the guy with a level 3 skill should have a better 
chance of rolling SS than he does for a regular success.  I don\'t 
agree with that, but just to humor you, here\'s the same example with 
sombody with a level 1 skill.

And look at that--his chance of rolling SS is still better than his 
chance of rolling regular success by almost a 2 to 1 margin.

MT is busted, and it does not work in T4 very well.

KBv2.0 IS the better choice.


> You are missing the point ! The doctor has a HIGHER chance of spectacular

I am not missing that point, and I can see that the doctor has a 
better chance overall.

What I am arguing is that the doctor should beat the NPC on all 
levels--regular success, exceptional success, and total success.

This is not happening in MT.  But guess what, it does in KBv2.0.

What!?  Support you comments with an example.  You are unclear here.
I\'d like to see where, with KBv2.0, that is true.

Please do.  Take the KBv2.0 challenge.  Look at that post and send a 
MT vs KBv2.0 challenge to me.

Let\'s see how the two systems fair against each other.  If I were a 
betting man (and I am), I\'d put my money on KBv2.0.

Take the challenge.  We will all see the outcome.

Well, originally, I cast my vote in favour of the KBv2.0 system. 
However, after hearing many arguements, and critical analysis as well as
testing both in scenarios with my players (along with, I might add T4.1,
T4, and TNE) I have changed my KBV vote (sorry Ken).

Now, my vote is cast in favour of an MT-inspried system.  The reason you
ask?  Well, the main complaint I got from my players,a dn the main one I
face is too many dice.  Both KBv and T4.1 have lots of dice, not the
simple, tried and tested MT version.  I\'m not asking for a perfectly
MT-like system, but a return to the days of few dice, and the Universal
Task Profile I loved so much.  MT was my introduction to Traveller
(although I own all versions now) and I definitely think it\'s the best
task system.

But, this is MY opinion.  I\'m not too sure if I\'d like to see Marc and
the IG crew publish the revised T4  with a completely different system
as that would saure confuse and annoy a lot of people with such
supplements as Pocket Empires.  I suppose it could work out, but I\'m not
quite sure myself.  Regardless, my vote is for an MT-inspired system.

I do not recall with fondness the MT days because of just the great
supplements, as suggested by a list members, but also because of the
simplicity of thhe excellent task system.

Excellent point!  Education DOES represent the sum total f your
education, not specific to one course, or area of study like a skill
is.  Education represents my entire highs chool and college knowledge,
not just that one year of study I did in auto repair (to get a technical
skill or whatever).

But, we are talking about SEVEN DICE!  I\'m getting visions of the STar
Wars system by West End, and there\'s a horrid game system, KBV is using
just as many dice as you in that game, whihc, incidently turned me off
Star Wars, and turned my players and I off KBV.

That\'s not entirely true, and I\'d say that bost systems have the same
complexity, each of them requriing a calculation before play (in MT the
stats division and in KBV the skill multiplier).

MT = stat\\5 + skill
KBV = stat + 3*skill

Each takes one line, so that\'s a mute point.

Gave it a shot...didn\'t work out.  I\'m not directly destroying KBV
either Ken, I do thin, it\'s an alright which certainly accounts for the
lack of importance that T4\\1 places on skills.  However, MT can do that
without the hassle of the extra dice, and also with giving me much more
such as the time, mishap, etc.

MT is tried, tested and true...to quote a commercial :)

Yes, but the iteration isn\'t random.  Players will tend to
want to have some skills at higher levels and pick them over
and over.

Additionally, this process holds true for both skill and
stat selection while stats have, in _addition_ the
effects of the bell curve.

Another way of looking at it is that characters have a
base of 0 for skills and 7 for stats.  It just that the
random part of the generation system gives characters 
a chance of having a bonus or penalty (this will be a
+2 to a -2 for 2/3 of the characters) in certain types
of skills to reflect talent.

Very true.  Since I went shopping for a NorrisNuken cartridge today, I can

Also true, but given the sheer number of facts out there, and the
organization of them, someone who has grown up in a high tech environment
is likely to have encountered a given fact than someone at a low tech
point.  Whether they have absorbed any of them is arguable, but one still
has to encounter a fact before it can be absorbed.

The point I did not make well was that EDU is used as a modifier for a lot
of skills, and always in places where the clear implication was that high
EDU was a proxy for your likelihood of having read an important fact
relevant to the problem.  Given this, it seems like a good idea to either
add a technology component to the EDU score, or to the skill writeups.

For example, to answer a physics question on artificial gravity is an EDU
task, typically.  I suppose one should note the tech at which you received
each level of skill, and if you have not gotten a level of skill at a TL
that knows about grav fields, you cannot use your physics skill to solve
the problem.  You might be able to solve a much harder INT problem, though.

>I guess a lot depends on the definition of EDU, but it seems to me that

Verily.  They have some barriers, but they also have at least a chance of
having heard some of the facts that would go into some of those skill
writeups.

Rather than worry about nature vs. nurture, I will likely just go this way.

What I was thinking about contemplates that stats should be eliminated
altogether from most task rolls.  You can attain skill level equal to 2x
your stat; if it is a skill associated with two different stats, use the
higher one.

The advantage of this is that you do not have to flip through the book
every time you use a skill in order to see what stat it is associated with.
 I have found that slows down play quite a bit, especially for new players,
much as having to look up the combat modifiers for various weapons and
armor in CT did.  I also think this approach is fairly realistic:  skill is
determinative of success, but people\'s characteristics limit how good they
can become at something, and everybody\'s limit is different.

The ability to differentiate between the doctor who is good at diagnosis
(high Edu) and the excellent surgeon (high Dex) is lost with this approach.

Seems that quite a few people don\'t agree with you, Kenneth.  By 2.5x,
people still seem to prefer an MT variant over a KBv20 variant, and 16%
more like the MT system than KBv20 and T4.1 combined.

You\'ve got a lot of convincing to do.

No, you got it half right:

2d6+Skill+(Stat/5) vs (4 x DiffLev)-1

I suggest a modification

2d6 + Skill + (Stat / 3) -vs- (4 x Difflev)

DiffLev is # of levels of difficulty, with Easy being 1, Routine =2, Diff

Marc, 

I agree with Bob, here.  Your presence and attention is greatly
appreciated.  I hope our posts were more helpful than harmful in your
design efforts.

Oh, and I promise, no matter what, I won\'t flame you.  If that darn half
dice is still in there, I\'ll use house rules to get rid of it, but I
*won\'t* flame you.  ;->

An easy and workable alternative that I use is 1x1x3.5m regular
parallelipeds mapped to squares, this makes each square exactly 1/4 ton.
The 3.5m deck height is better than 3m because it gives you good head room
(2.5m), and a generous crawlspace (1m) between decks.  It also allows nice
sized double high decks (1x1x7m=1/2 ton per square) for engineering and
cargo/ship bays.  It *also* allows easy scaling up and down from large to
small scale maps, compress each block of 4 1m squares down to 1 square and
you have 1 ton/square and have a summarized deckplan, expand them back and
you have a detailed one.  This seems to work well for PC sized ships.


Eris,
    yes, I guess I do *everything* differently. <sigh>

Hum, well just double the levels in the old CT and MT supplements that
should do it.  Maybe even triple them...that\'s the same *effect* as KB2,
just a different process.

Yeah, we all know you do Ken. ;-> 

KB2 was a nice fix for T4, but maybe not for T41.

If Marc *is* doing a complete rewrite then he should look at how all the
new parts he is designing fit together.  The new Character Generation
system should fit with the new Task system and the new Experience system
and the new combat systems, etc.

I think, after the past week, Marc knows our concerns about the task
system, stat vs skill ratios, the high stat coming out of CharGen problems. 
I sure he\'s heard the desire to keep skill levels at CT levels from many
and the belief from folks like you and I that they go up *somehow*, I know
you prefer multiplying, but you also know I\'d prefer just having more skill
levels.  He\'s likely heard *much*more* than he expected..or wanted to hear. 
;->

What we probably should do now is back off on this particular issue and let
Marc work.  He\'ll let us know what he decides to do...he might even let us
know pre-publication if we don\'t bug him too much.

Eris,
    the great compromiser! <yeah, right>

Good post Stu. I agree with *all* of your comments.

I\'m a Traveller Task System Agnostic. There should be a task system. How 
it\'s implemented is irrelevant (to me).

The Task "Framework" (ie. description, difficulty progression, format, 
etc.) should be well defined, so that a common "language" for 
communicating task parameters is clear. That is the most important part. 
As long as the results have some cohesion, the actual percentages don\'t 
matter as much, they can be tweaked to individual taste.

Lets be careful.  There has been alot of uncritical "counting"
going on here.  I\'m supposedly in the "change" camp.  Yet I
don\'t think the T4.1 system _must_ be changed.  I just don\'t
happen to like numerous and variable dice (and would also tweak
the character generation system).

> Let\'s stop all of this quibbling, and start looking at the facts.  
> Let\'s get behind one, good change for Traveller.

The problem is that you have taken at least some people who
have incompatible beliefs in what needs changing.  For example,
I don\'t think that the task system needs to be changed to
favor skills more.  I do favor sticking with 1, 2 or 3 dice
for all rolls.

> I strongly believe that KBv2.0 is the answer.  I believe this so much
> so that I am offering a challenge.

For example, I would go with T4.1 before I would go with KBv2.0.

Just because a number of people don\'t exactly agree with T4 doesn\'t
mean they don\'t have even greater differences with each other.

	Glad I\'m not the only one thinking that ... frankly, it turned me off
early. I got the distinct feeling they were trying to erase TNE as quickly
as possible by bringing in new people, but wound up doing worse damage.

	Or assume a deck height (floor to floor) of 3.5m and a 1mx1m grid. The
deck height of 3.5m allows for the "\'tween decks" stuff, such as
power/control/communications cabling, ventilation, waste and water piping,
nifty crawlspaces for PCs, etc. while still allowing decent
floor-to-ceiling spacing (to allow for taller folks ...).

	Or just approximate on your deck plans, it\'s close enough usually. If it
bothers you, you can keep track of how many 0.5m3 chunks you\'ve lost, and
add it in where you need it. That\'s how I always did it in CT.

	I\'ve really got heartache with tying this so tightly to formal
degree-equivalents, unless you clearly and unequivocally state these are
only guidelines. There\'s a lot more to knowledge than formal education.

	And that\'s how I\'ve always seen EDU--a measure of how much disparate
information a character knows, that can\'t necessarily be pigeonholed into a
specific skill. So a Bachelors\' degree, to me, should mean a couple of
levels in a specific skill (in my case, BS in Aerospace Engineering = about
Engineering-3), plus a few collateral skills (Computer-1, Research-1), plus
an EDU bonus. The increase in EDU means I\'ve learned a lot more than just a
few specific skills--I\'ve been exposed to new ideas and thoughts, ways of
thinking, and a bunch of learning "below" the Skill-1 level; things like
history, the arts, etc., etc.

	Also, you\'ve completely buried the abilities of self-taught people, who\'ve
gained a huge body of knowledge without formal education. They may not be
able to stand up to an expert in any one area, but they know something
about a much wider area (definition of expert: somebody who knows more and
more about less and less, until he knows everything about nothing).

There are alot of possibility with this plot, as a matter of fact
I am working on a few similar ideas myself.  You can have all sorts of 
things happen.  From in fighting, to Corp attacks as they try to 
regain the planet.  How will the rest of the Imperium react to this 
right before a moot.  Will another noble try to move in and claim the 
world.  What about the people on the planet it self, who are their 
leaders do these leaders have loyal followers?

    'body' => '	Just thought I\'d stand up and be counted in favour of KB v.2.0
again, especially as how Volker seems to have missed me the first time
around.

	I\'d also like to add, as I\'m currently using KB v.2.0, that it
really does work for me.  It is well integrated with the game, is dirt
simple, and IMHO fixes everything that stunk about the vanilla T4 system.

	A point to consider is that newbie Trav players such as myself,
who\'ve bought T4, will instantly be able to understand it: "ohh... I see;
you make the skill count for more and you roll more dice and nuked the half
die; otherwise it\'s pretty well identical.


	People here have been saying that the TML isn\'t representative of
the "Traveller community at large" because we\'re all 20-year veterans with
three copies of every supplement ever written, and that therefore we ought
to be careful about making changes based on what the list says and see what
the vast majority of newbie Traveller players thinks.


	I AM a newbie Trav player; started playing last fall in an abortive
campaign run by Ross Coburn (he\'d told me about the list last summer, so
I\'ve actually been around for a little while longer than that).  I played 3
sessions of MT before that campaign blew up.  I then decided that this game
ruled (although I had reservations about the mechanics; I preferred
StoryTeller) and that I had to run a campaign.

	After buying the manual and borrowing all of Ross\'s stuff, I ran a
four-session campaignlet in order to teach myself and my players the game,
which I posted to the list as Traveller: Long Day\'s Journey.  Those four
sessions were enough to convince me that the T4 system was grievously
flawed.  So I decided to give KB v.2.0 a try in my next campaign.

	Two gaming sessions into the new campaign (we play on Friday next;
expect a new instalment then), KB v.2.0 has performed as well as Ken
advertises; my players, most of whom are Traveller newbies, have adjusted
to it perfectly.  I am very happy with it, and unless whatever is used in
T4.1 is superior (which it\'s hard to see how), I\'m going to continue with
it in future.


	So, as an example of a newbie Traveller player, I can say that I\'ve
playtested KB v2.0, am perfectly content with it, and rather than be upset
at having to ditch the task system in my (somewhat overpriced) manual, am
very happy that Ken has come up with the fix.  It\'s vastly improved the
game for me.

	So Marc; please give it a thorough looking-at; it\'s simple, it
works, and involves only minimal alterations of all those existing manuals
out there.  I\'m sure that a load of non-TMLing newbie players out there
will be overjoyed to be able to use Ken\'s fix.

	Arguing about which characteristic to use wasn\'t my main point, although
it was my starting point. Going back to my argument ... again, in the
real-life example I stated the greatest contributor, in my perception, to
the various medical tasks undertaken by the ER staff, was their medical
training. Not dexterity, although that would have aided in any surgery. Not
intelligence, although that helped them pull together the relevant bits of
their training. Not education, which I\'ve always viewed more as the breadth
of a character\'s knowledge (as opposed to the depth represented by a
skill). It was their medical knowledge, pure and simple.

	Now, I\'ve got a reasonable education, even though I\'m not one of the
renaissance men on the list. I had a childhood fascination with history,
biology, rocketry and computers. I have a degree in aerospace engineering,
various technical training courtesy of the USAF in systems engineering,
R&D, acquisitions, and contract law, repeated first-aid and CPR training,
half a masters degree in CS/systems engineering, and a breadth of
continuous reading. Nevertheless, I would never expect that my Medical-1
(first aid training, CPR, buddy aid & self care, etc.) combined with my
education (C according to the test at GenCon; probably more around A
according the the scales bandied here) would grant me a gnat\'s ass chance
of performing open heart surgery. The medical skill MUST be the primary
weight here.

	Likewise, simply by virtue of my reading Scientific American, Science
News, Aerospace America, etc., the flat "Skill+Attribute" says I\'ve got
decent chances of succeeding at:

	In real life, even somebody with half my EDU, but with training (even
skill level 1) should outperform me on ANY task in which I don\'t have
enough training to qualify for the skill. Period. Sheesh! I remember people
squawking about how unbalancing JOAT was ... screw JOAT, gimme a skill
level of one or two in the critical areas, and then concentrate on stats. I
can do anything!

	I would much rather have an average-intelligence medical school graduate
(Int 7, Med-4) than a genius first-year med student (Int 15, Med-1) get
ANYWHERE near me with a scalpel, or even diagnose me. Any system that
doesn\'t work that way, to me, is fundamentally flawed and unuseable. That
path basically leads to the "Wesley Crusher" taste for the game ... a
decidedly unpleasant taste.

	Oh, BTW, I firmly reject the notion that this will come down to a tradeoff
between playability and believability. You don\'t have to go with a broken
system that\'s playable--find a believable system that\'s playable.

And despite Kenneth\'s unrelenting championing of KBv20 ("he never, even
gives up"--any relationship to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ken?), I don\'t think
that\'s it, either.

Kenneth, Fellow Sophont: 
	I will be the first to admit that the KBv2.0 system is pretty neat, and it
does what it sets out to do.  I will also be the first to admit that I
don\'t really like it, and neither I nor my players will use it to play
Traveller.

Why? (I\'m glad I asked.)

	KBv2.0 system does extremely well modeling a task system that is based on
its fundamental assumptions.  The problem: not everyone agrees on those
fundamental assumptions.  This is why people play different games, or why
they use different systems to play the same game.  I\'m not saying that the
assumptions are wrong, just that they aren\'t right for everyone.  Let\'s go
through KBv2.0 and discuss them.  Follow along kids!

**Fundamental Assumption #1: Skill vs Stat**
	KBv2.0 assumes that skills and stats should be weighted the same.  A quote
from KB himself states:

	"KBv2.0 weights them equally.  That\'s how it should be.  One part natural
ability and one part experience."

	Not all of us agree with this.  Some people think that stats should
dominate skills, while others think that skills should dominate stats.  I
happen to fall into the latter category (believing that skills are *much*
more important than stats) but a blanket statement of "That\'s how it should
be" does *not* appeal to everyone.
	However, if you believe in KB\'s FA#1, then KB works.  If not, the system
is already "broken".

**Fundamental Assumption #2: Success vs Exceptional Success**
	KBv2.0 assums that a character should always have a higher chance of
rolling success than exceptional success, regardless of the level of
difficulty of the task.  A quote from KB:

	"What I am arguing is that the doctor should beat the NPC on all
levels--regular success, exceptional success, and total success."

There are two parts of a successful task roll:
	a) did you succeed at the task? and
	b) did you Exceptionally Succeed at the task.

	KBv2.0 FA#2 says that, if you succeed at a task, your chance of getting
regular success should be higher than getting exceptional success
regardless of the difficulty or the skill of the character.

	Not everyone agrees with FA#2.  If a highly-skilled character is
performing a very easy task, who shouldn\'t he have an exceptionally good
chance of performing an Exceptional Success, even to the point that he will
*most of the time* perform Exceptional Successes?  i.e. A highly-skilled
character performing an low difficulty task should be able to get SS more
often than he gets just regular successes.  (Imagine asking Feynman to take
an algebra test, or Pavaroti to sing \'Happy Birthday\' - these guys should
almost always succeed at the tasks, and get Exceptional Successes in them
almost always)  Contrariwise, a low-skilled character performing the same
task would have a greater chance of performing at the regular success level
than the more skilled character, and a less chance of Exceptional Success. 

	KBv2.0 also allows a character the chance to achieve Exceptional Success
for any skill+stat, at any difficulty.  Some of us believe that at very
high difficulties and low skills, if the character does succeed, it will be
as a \'skin of the teeth\' maneuver, and at these high difficulties a
character *shouldn\'t* have a chance in hell of rolling Exceptional Success.

	Note: There is a related Fundamental Assumption that states much of the
same, but for Exceptional Failures, low skills, etc.  It is just the
opposite side of this assumption, so the two are counted as one Fundamental
Assumption.

**Fundamental Assumption #3: Rolling Handsfuls of dice is OK in Traveller**

	This is definitely the most subjective of the FAs.  For most of
Traveller\'s existence, it has relied on 2d6 (CT and MT) or 1d10 (TNE) or
1d20 (TNE ver 2).  Traveller does not have the right feel when I and my
players are rolling scads of dice.  It feels two much like _Star Wars_.
	Of course, this is *very* subjective.  

So,
**What Does It All Mean:**
	It\'s very simple: if you can agree with the FAs of KBv2.0:

	FA#1: Skill vs Stat - "KBv2.0 weights them equally.  That\'s how it should
be."
	FA#2: Success vs Exceptional Success -  "the doctor should beat the NPC on
all levels--regular success, exceptional success, and total success."
	FA#3: Rolling Handfuls of dice is OK in Traveller**

then it is definitely the best task system I have ever seen, and I will
never touch it again in my entire gaming career.  

Why?  

	Because I completely and totally disagree with all three FAs of KBv2.0. 
What ever example I post, from whatever system, KB will tear it up because
I do not subscribe to his FAs, and because of that his task system will
always be \'broken\' to me, and mine to him.

> I want to see, comparing apples to apples, where KBv2.0 is inferior 
> to any system yet proposed for Traveller.

	It can\'t be done, because other systems fail on one or more of your
Fundamental Assumptions.  Given different assumptions (that many people on
this list subscribe to) your system would be as broken as T4, or MT, or
TNE.  Given the assumptions above, KBv2.0 is a very good system,  but is
\'broken\' for those that do not agree with one or more of your FAs.

>Now, who will step up to the plate?

	We\'re stepping to different plates, Kenneth.

    'body' => 'I got the feeling that this is one of those things where people aren\'t
gonna budge...but here\'s my take:

The problem is our differing definitions - every point that someone has
offered to support MT has been true - and every rebuttle by Kenneth has
been true as well.

Skills vs. Stats
- ----
In KBv2, skills and stats are "equivalent". In MT, skills outweigh stats.
So which is better? That depends entirely on your philosophy of gaming. I
favor the MT view. I can provide no concrete, statistical reason - it just
sits well with my definition. If you believe the two are equalent -- you
gotta go with KBv2.

The Stat/5 problem
- ----
Kenneth claims that the division during combat, as your stats change (from
damage), detracts from the MT system. He may see it that way, but I have NO
problem remembering 1-4 = 0, 5-9=+1, 10-14=+2 and 15-19=+3. Again, opinions
may vary.

The spectacular success problem
- ----
Kenneth seems to have a problem with the fact that his doctor has a smaller
chance for a "normal" success than the medic, even though he has an overall
better chance of any kind of success...I must admit that this one stumps
me...I simply don\'t comprehend it as a problem. The doctor is good...heck,
he\'s great! Most of his procedures, when of average difficulty, are going
to be spectacular. This is exactly how I envision it.

The number of dice
- ----
This is purely an opinion thing - just like the half-die. Some people don\'t
mind it. OThers hate it. Some people don\'t mind rolling seven dice. Others
want only two. While you can do some statistical handwaving to support a
particular dice system, peoples desires are important as well. I prefer 2
dice. No other reason other than I like it.

Added details
- ----
In my final bid for MT, I\'d like to say that I love the rules for time,
uncertain tasks, hasty tasks, cautious tasks, etc...true, these could be
added to KBv2, I imagine. But their with MT right now.

Kenneth has challenged someone to show up his KBv2. I suspect that it
cannot be done. Not that Kenneth is short sided - quite the contrary, I
have found most his posts to be intelligent and insightful. The problem is
that we have reached the point where our differences are based in the
perception of definitions and situations. I personally feel that I have
shot down every one of Kenneth\'s attacks on MT. Just like he feels that he
has defended against every attack vs. Kbv2. Both of us are right. And
neither will convince the other.

What I recommend is this...let\'s continue our dialogs for the purpose of
showing Marc our views and feelings. Eventually, he\'ll make a choice for
SOME system (perhaps not any of ours).

Whatever the choice he makes, I recommend that we take the time to publish
on the web (and perhaps in JTAS ) the alternatives.

I can guarentee that when I play traveller, my task system will be more
like MT than KBv2 or T4.1...and I suspect that kenneth is gonna use his
system no matter what too :)

IfI have offended Kenneth or anyone else, I appologize.

Well, after rummaging around here\'s one description I posted way back in
March.

Level 0 - You saw somebody do it once, and if you\'re lucky you won\'t
          hurt yourself trying.

Level 1 - Novice apprentice or beginning student after a few months
          of study.

Level 2 - Advanced apprentice or student after a couple years of
          study.

Level 3 - Journeyman, BS/BA graduate, Medical Student.

Level 4 - Journeyman nearing Master status, a Professional with
          on-the-job experience, someone with an advanced education
          like a Masters or even PhD, or a practicing MD.

Level 5 - A Master of a craft, an Expert in a field, or a medical
          specialist with the training and experience to back it up.

Level 6 - A Grand Master, a leading authority in the field, or a
          Guru.

Level 7 - Yoda, Steven Hawking or Michael Jordan.

Level 8 - "...in the beginning..."

If Marc *is* going to make higher Skill Levels normal, we\'ll want to change
my descriptions from Level 4 on up not hitting "ghodhood" until Level-15,
with demi-ghodhood at 13-14, and so on. ;->

Now, I liked BL. I liked the mechanics, I liked the feel, I liked the level
of detail. For running through a simple combat coming up during a
roleplaying session, it was a bit too complicated, but not much. Well,
during the FF&S2 work, some of the fundamentals of BL got shaken up a bit,
so I decided to sit down and take a hack at rolling my own detailed space
combat system for t4, with the intent of "collapsing" it down for
quick\'n\'dirty as well. I\'m a gearhead, so I started with some fundamental
analysis--what are the rough probabilities of hitting a target at a given
range.

Well, I\'ve already run into a slight difficulty--the range bands are WAY
too granular. First estimate of hit probability for a 100Td sphere is 86%
at 50,000km. The next range band, 500,000km, the hit probability drops WAY
down to 1% ... that\'s MUCH to large a drop between range bands ("Hurry up
and hit him, before he reaches 500kkm!"). Linear, tenth-light-second bands
work much better.

For those who are interested, and want to discuss creating a detailed
system, my first cut at the calculations are posted at

	http://www.pcisys.net/~goldendj/Traveller/SpaceCombat.html

This is just the first, back-of-the envelope (or spreadsheet) analysis, and
I intend to flesh it out some more. Please pardon the unfinished appearance
of the page. I\'m doing the original document in Word97, and the Mickeysh*t
Word to HTML converter sucks. I tweaked it a bit manually, but not much.

Hm. Third suggestion.

3) Keep the present task system, renaming it the "space opera" style. 
(Because a character can be good at everything with high attributes.)  Make a
new system that can use the same task descriptions (in terms of
skill/attribute/level) but has a different balance, and call that the "hard
SF" style.  BOTH systems would be official, and which one is used would be up
to the gamers.  Then gaming groups can pick a task system to match their
style, and it will still be Traveller.

Actually, _is_ there a lot of TL13+ relic stuff around, or have we just had a
lot of adventures with it in?

This is rather like the old Virus argument in TNE, in which a plot device
intended to be rare (and stated as such in the rulebook) figured in a great
many of the adventures (about a third).  My opinion is that Virus is rare in
the TNE setting, but a great many authors wanted to write a Virus adventure,
so a lot of Virus adventures were published.

In the same way, the TL13+ relics could well be extremely rare, but because
adventures are by definition not routine, we\'ve seen more of them.

That said, I haven\'t read Anomalies yet, just glanced through it.  If anyone
can give me a page reference that contradicts my opinion, I\'ll happily
relabel my opinion "<varient setting>" :-)

Oh yes, I\'m filling out failure reports.  If anyone can think of a tactful

This was, by far, the most coherent, well-written, logical post on this
topic
I\'ve yet seen, including my own. I heartily agree with Vanya on this
one.

KBv2.0 isn\'t broken and neither is MT. They just work from different
assumptions,
with predictably different results. 

Originally I had favored KBv2.0 to replace T4\'s task system. Now, having
paid
close attention to all the posts on this thread, I came to this post. It 
forced me to ask myself if I was comfortable with the three FA\'s
mentioned.
Regrettably, I am not. I must now support the MT system over KBv2.0.

Above all else, we must consider that Marc is 99% UNlikely to change
the general framework of the Traveller task system.  This will most
likely be the final crack at the T4.x rulebook and I doubt IG will
survive if they have to put out yet another revision.  Products have
already been released that feature a task system using multiple dice,
and reverting to MT, no matter how many list members request it, will
simply not happen.  Otherwise, IG will most certainly be pressured
into issuing new releases of *these* products too, just like everyone
demanded with FS.

Someone mentioned that TML has possibly 300-500 members.  While I
don\'t have official information regarding this figure or the number of
T4 master rulebooks that IG has sold, let it be simply said that IG
stands to lose more my alienating T4 players that are *not* on this
list (and are therefore, unaware that their precious T4 is about to
undergo a major change) than the 30 or 40 TMLers that have expressed
their interest in using a MT-style task system for T4.1.  I\'m pretty
positive that Marc\'s intentions are not to provide a better game for
*us*, but a better game for Traveller players *everywhere* (on or off
the mailing list).

Eris posted a task system earlier this week.  Although it was less
than well received, it _did_work_ with the current T4.1 system (and
would have worked with previously released T4 products, also).
Merrick, too, posted a system that could work with T4, albeit in a
somewhat unique way that few other people have thought of.  While
these two systems may not become the new T4.1 Task System, their
authors at least were thinking realistically as to what type of task
system could be meshed with the current T4 system.  Any task system
proposed MUST be backwards compatible to some extent, or you risk
angering potentially thousands of non-TML Traveller players.

While Marc may have mentioned that he wished to model T4 after Classic
Traveller, the *primary* goal of the new task system most certainly is
that it works with previously released T4 material *first*.

I know my opinion is my own, but it is also an opinion "untarnished"
by any MT experience.  I have never played MT, having jumped from CT
directly to T4, with a short stay in TNE-land.  Needless to say, while
I don\'t have anything bad to say about MT, I don\'t have anything good
to say either.

I guess what I\'d like to ask Marc is:

"How far can our task system proposals be from what is currently
printed in T4.0?"

No. The doctor, because he\'s an expert in his field, has a lower
chance of performing mediocrity. That is, he has a better chance
of excellence. That\'s why he\'s a doctor. Of course, this applies to
Routine/Average tasks.

A fighter pilot has a poor chance of doing an average barrel roll
with a Cessna. That same guy has an excellent chance of doing a
really nicely executed barrel roll.

You fail to address his point about time to perform tasks, mishaps
and the like. How does KBv2.0 deal with this? Don\'t get me wrong;
I\'m not attacking you, I\'m just curious.

	Anybody ever checked how badly the deckplans in Judge\'s Guild\'s 
"Doom of the Singing Star" are off-tonnage? I never got around that 
myself, but somehow thinking of a cruise liner with a spinal mount 
meson gun, J5 and pretty many maneuvering Gs wouldn\'t carry thousands 
of passengers, 37,000 tons or not.

	BTW, one of the best adventures I ran was a variant of "Argon 
Gambit", set aboard Opal Nova (A Singing Star -class liner). To make 
the deckplans match I reasoned the ship was originally an Imperial 
light cruiser, salvaged from drifting in the Alpha Crucis sector by a 
group of free traders, partially demilitarized and fitted with 
luxury accommodations. Opal Nova makes frequent runs between hi-pop 
worlds in the Wilds. Still, no sane pirate is going to attack a 
37,000 ton ship armed with 6 100-ton PA bays and about 50 120Mj 
lasers... 

	7 months later, the PCs are still in trouble with Naval 
Intelligence. :) Sold out to SolSec, the traitors!

	I second that. However, a certain particularly ruthless and

Well thank you. There obviously has to be more range bands than 50 000 km,
500 000 km and it seems to me that 50 000 km, 150 000 km, 500 000 km seems
OK (the original range bands for the sensor calculations Bruce did
methinks). There\'s a minor error in a formula at the website: s = (amax
t^2)/2, you forgot to divide by 2 at least in the formula as I haven\'t
checked your numbers yet. BTW when doing calculations for a range band do
you use the upper limit of the band or the average range? For the
5,15,50,150 progression I use 3,10,30,100 for my calculations (I use the
5,15,50 progression for personal combat, vehicular combat and space
combat).

If you add in a small constant time delay for computer calculations be it
image analysis from sensors or vibration compensation for the
sensors/weapons the propabilities flattens out a bit. One could set a
timelag addition based on the ships computer power (=calculation ability).
As computer factors scales as +1 = x10 faster. The computers effective
factor would be reduced by 1 if more than 1 target was tracked, -2 for more
than 10 targets tracked and so forth. I\'d say that a target should be
considered anyt ships/missiles with the same vector and locations ie task
group in BR. As Fleet tactics govern the number of active task groups a
side can have this equates to a clear to hit advantage as the commander
with low fleet tactics will have to group his ships thus reducing the
computer timelag and increasing to hit propabilities.

	Bleh indeed. The plans in TD #15 p.9 have pretty little to do with 
the external view illustration of the corsair (MT, Imperial 
Encyclopedia). The adventure, "Krimm\'s Paw" is one of the weakest TD 
adventures anyway, so it\'s not such a big loss. IMO, plain pirate-

online. In return, I have TNE stats and deckplans for two ships 
designs; a Stratocaster -class 400-ton Far Trader (TL 11, Solomani) 
and a Tuareg -class 200-ton scout (TL 12, the same).

Well, I guess I\'d better make my vote known (I did _very_ early on in this
debate, but it didn\'t seem to get counted).

My preference is KBv2. I have no problem with multiple dice, nor the
assumptions that Ken has made (although some of the arguments made by Vanya
in the KBv2 challenge thread, in particular the success vs exceptional
success part, were food for thought).

However, given that several products have already been published using the
proposed T4.1 task system, I would be willing to settle for that system if
the SS and SF from KBv2 were used (I\'m not sure how the percentages for
this work out though). The current proposed method for SS/SF is, IMHO,
wrong. (Note: willing to settle for the system doesn\'t mean I\'d actually
use that system - but then I\'m sure most people on the list will use there
own system no matter what the final task system published in T4.1 is.)

Well that\'s pretty darn easy:

A PC with a skill of 5 and a stat of 11 is quite skilled, but also quite
easy to generate.  Such a character has a target number of 26.  The
average of 7 dice is 24.5.  This character has over a 60% chance of
succeeding at an impossible task, and will succeed 90+ % of the time with
all other task levels.  In MT impossible tasks were difficult for even the
highly skilled. Why make a PC with this level of skill roll tasks at all.
A very similar result would be obtained by simply saying "You succeed in
all tasks you attempt with this skill".  KB 2.0 makes tasks *far* to easy. 
In many ways its even worse about this that T4.1 (under the system
described in the game screen the same character has a target number of 16,
the average of 5 dice is 17.5.  The PC has around a 40% chance to succeed
at an Impossible task.  This is IMHO still too high, but not insanely so
(unlike KB 2.0). 

Under MT, the same character would have a 3% chance of succeeding at an
Impossible task.  That does not seem unreasonable to me, especially since
taking double the time needed for the task (ie making a cautious attempt)
would lower the level to Formidable and allow the character to have a 42%
chance of succeeding at a cautious attempt (Impossible tasks are damn
hard, so cautious attempt make sense under MT) Even if they were allowed
in KB 2.0, why bother.

First of all my post about MT weaknesses dealt with the fact that a lot of
people say they prefer MT before T4.1 or KBv2.0 but the question/answer
become meaningless if the preferrential tasksystem has to be remade before
being useable. I could say that I prefer T4.1 but that it has to change a
bit rolling only 2D6 etc etc. Marcs problem was that he wanted our input as
to what task system to use of EXISTING ones.

Yes time is a factor but that should be figured INTO the task roll. You get
into all kinds of timetravel like strangenesses when a guy succeeds at a
task despite not having the time to complete it. What has really happened?
Did he spend as much time as he had and stopped there but miracolously
knows that IF he had had the time he\'d succeed. In order to use the time
roll it had to be rolled before the task began and then the player could
try a hasty task NOT rerolling the time but cutting the time in half or
something.

I suggest looking it up. Exceptional is the exception to the norm, out of
the ordinary etc and should therefore NOT occur more often than regular
success. The reason DGP did it was that when they were doing the combat
system taskbased it didn\'t "feel" right with 4 above required as they
originally intended, 3 above was wrong for aesthetic reasons(!) and so 2
above it was.

>No, the task system was a stroke of genius as well, not perfect, but

>Ad Astra,

As a final note: I use and have used a task system similar to MT with 2D6
rolls, no characteristics factors at all, the progression 1+, 4+, 7+, 10+,
13+ etc and Total fail on miss by 4 or more, Fail result on miss by 1,2 or
3, Fair result on success by 0,1 or 2, Good result on 3,4,5 and Very Good
result on 6+ above. Whenever a 2 or 12 is rolled I let the player roll 1D6
and if 5+ add 1 to result and continue rolling (2- and subtract 1 for low
roll) thus getting away from the automatic success/failure thing. One could
say that I use MT system but I wouldn\'t vote for it as the standard MT
system is only slightly better than T4.1 - not enough for IG to change the
rules.

I don\'t really think you could have "wildly different tech levels" as TL is
extremely interrelated. A reasonalble variation of +1 to -1 is OK but more
than that seems both unrealistic and Trecky (if that isn\'t exactly the
same).

Isn\'t it the partial pressure of O2 that does it. 1 ATM air (20% O2) is the

Given declining educational standards in US public schools lately maybe
charecters at TL 6 to 7 have the best education and as TL increases the
educational standards go down.  This could also explain Travellers
(vilani influenced) very slow rates of increases in technology.  Many
people who could increase technology if well educated are not educated
enough to do do. :)

Many ( most ?) people today pursue higher education not for the sake of
learning but because college graduates earn more money.  As the TL
increases and standards of living improve with it maybe fewer people
bother to go.  The increasing number in the number of people who go to
college will not necessarily continue forever, and many colleges do not
provide much in the way of education bonuses but instead teach skills. A
college education also seems to increase SOC in todays society (although
not nearly as much as it used to), as the nature of SOC in society
changes (Nobles at the top of the SOC scale in the 3rd Imperium as
opposed to 20th century Americas movie stars, politicains, and very well
paid professionals) maybe these removes another incentive to go to
college.

I don\'t understand, of the Med-3 doctor has a smaller chance of regular

Hurray, applause. As Marc asked us to come up with alternatives to the
broken T4, T4.1 systems instead of bickering about this and that and
dreaming wishful dreams about MT (the PERFECT systems if we only change
that, and that, and that=8A)
I\'d say keep T4.1 as the Space Opera system and add KBv2.0 as the Hard SF
system.
This should be the end of the discussion except the endless
bickering/flamewar that will drag on until something new to bicker/flame
comes up.

   This is the second reference I\'ve seen to this.  So I pulled out my
copy and sure enough, there it is on page 34.  I officially stand
corrected (I had previously indicated that the TL of the RoM had been
strongly hinted at, but not actually stated).

Below is a chart of the tech levels achieved by the major interstellar
powers.

THE FIRST IMPERIUM

Imperial  TL  Comments
- -9235      9  Vilani discover Jump1
- -8900     10  Vilani sphere reaches about 10 parsecs in size
- -5430     11  Vilani discover Jump2

THE SECOND IMPERIUM
(Originally the Terran Confederation)

Imperial  TL  Comments
- -2431      9  Terrans discover Jump1
- -2408     10  First Terran/Vilani Interstellar War ends
- -2398     11  Terrans discover Jump2
- -2210     12  Terrans discover Jump3

THE THIRD IMPERIUM
(Originally the Sylean Federation)

Imperial  TL  Comments
- -1776     10  Syleans maintain minimal interstellar trade
 -650     11  Sylean Federation established
 -150     12  Robot manufacturing reestablished
  300     13  Vargr Campaigns taking place (210-348)
  700     14  Xboat system being built (624-718)
 1000     15  Solomani Rim War taking place (998-1002)


Further analysis:  Now, it is considered canon (a dirty word to some
people around here) that TL 16 worlds existed in the Imperium c. 1117. 
Given that it took 450 years to go from TL 12 to 13, 400 years to go
from TL 13 to 14, and 300 years to go from TL 14 to 15, a time frame of
about 250 would not be out of the realm of possibility for the advance
from TL 15 to 16.  However, it is only a little over 100 years from 1000
to 1117.  What happen?  Well my theory is that the Imperium was able to
import higher tech from surrounding societies (electronics, robotic
components, and computers from the Hivers, a variety of items including
ship building technology from the Darrians, medical technology from the
Solomani, etc.) which accelerated the process on some worlds, allowing
them to cross the TL 16 threshold just as the Rebellion was starting to
heat up.

   In the case of the Terran Confederation/Second Imperium, we have a
planet (Earth) desperately trying to catch up technologically with a
vast empire that could swat it like a fly if the empire could bring its
muscle to bear on the situation (fortunately for the Terrans, it doesn\'t
do it until it is too late).  The Terrans had previously rapidly
progressed through TL 5-7 (20 years each level), stalling briefly at TL
8 (claim is 20 years, more likely 50) before advancing to TL 9 and
stalling again prior to first contact (c. -2431).  After first contact,
they achieve TL 10 in about 20 years, and TL 11 in about 10 years after
that (undoubtedly benefiting from captured Vilani technology, and crash
development defense programs).  It is another 188 years before TL 12 is
finally achieved.  For the 400 or so years, there is basically no
further advancement of technology within the Second Imperium.  

   Why?  For one, with the war won, there simply isn\'t the pressure to
advance that there used to be.  For another, the Terran
Confederation/Second Imperium proceeded to absorb billions of sentient
beings, the vast majority of which were very conservative about
technological development.  This undoubtedly had a significant impact,
as did the new rulers desire to broaden the narrow base of technological
development that had been created during the war years.  While there
were new discoveries, new inventions, and basic R&D going on, the
efforts of Rule of Man were toward horizontal rather than vertical
technological development.  

   While it is possible that a few worlds achieved TL 13 at some point,
these worlds would have been located in the Solomani Rim or in an
adjacent sector, away from the central region of the Second Imperium,
and their impact of the overall economy of the Rule of Man would have
been rather insignificant.  It is also possible that they would have
been the object of fighting between various factions at arose in the
latter stages of the empire, and their technological supremacy been
relatively short-lived.  

   Still, the Rule of Man would have likely achieved TL 13 at some point
(perhaps c. -1600) had the empire\'s economy held together, and that
would have opened the door to further experimental technologies even
approaching TL 14 (as in the infamous vacc suits).  But the evidence is
clear that the Rule of Man was well on the way to disintegration by
- -1776, and the likelihood that items could be mass produced even in
small quantities at TL 14 is simply outside the realm of possibility for
the Rule of Man.

Well, I simply don\'t agree.  I have met a lot of people I would
_never_ want to treat me in an ER.  A smart guy with a minimum of
training will know enough not to do something that will kill me.
I\'m not sure I have the same trust in an incompetant who will messed
up what he never really got down in the training. The point is that all
that training was applied to people who already had some ability.
Sure, the training wasn\'t important.  Nobody disputes that.  But
so is talent.

Well, the problem is that you have skill-0 in heart surgery.  You
could also be a highly trained dermatologist and not be the person
to perform heart surgery.  Also, you could be take someone with
shakes in his hands and who couldn\'t even handle high school
and give him training heart surgery and I still wouldn\'t want
him to do it.  I certainly would pick a first year med student
or an EMT over him.

What you are doing is poking holes based on the fact that, as
in any game, you have to generalize skills.  This can lead to
problems but there is not really any way around it and leave
the game playable.

Well, no.  Even with reading you still have skill-0.  You need
skill-1 to suceed (in general, of course GM can make exceptions).
 I would rather have an intellegent person who has only 1/4 year
of training (or whatever skill-1 means) than Forest Gump with
several years of experience.

Do you really know just how many systems you have just called
"fundamentally flawed and unuseable"?  This maybe your opinion,
but I would consider the fact that much of the gaming world outside
of Traveller before you state your opinion as fact.

Well, some of you nits are so picky that they do (even for nonskill+stat
systems).  But know, skill+stat based systems aren\'t sacrificing
believability for playability.  For many of us they are providing
both.

The winner is the one that does it all MOST differently. I use dTons that
are 5m3 (1 square = 1x1x2.5m). I changed all Striker I prices to comply
with HighGuard prices and then made my own design system based on that. My
ships are much smaller, lighter than canonical ones and yes, my cars weigh
less than a metric ton. While fidgeting with the design system I did some
TL changes as well

TL     Gravitics
================
9-     No gravitics tech yet
       This was in order to have jump-capable non grav systems so that
       I could play T2300 style campaigns if I wanted to.
10     Gravitic floater. This can only negate gravity but it can be used for
       space launches by centripetal acceleration by planetary rotation, tangent
       vector of planetary orbit etc.
       Floorfield. The rate changes pretty slowly and cannot generally be
used for
       evasion compensation.
11     Gravitic thruster. Produces thrust proportional to local gravity.
       Consumes twice as much power as Floaters. Most gravvehicles have floaters
       for lift and gravthrusters for thrust. This makes it easier to rationale
       the slow Air/rafts: They have floaters for lift and turbojets for
thrust as
       they\'re available at TL 10.
12     Small gravitic thruster/floater enabling gravbelts.
       Inertial compensators. Fast ratechange systems that can be used to negate
       violent maneuvers.
       Super weak tractor beams that can move dustparticles etc. They\'re only
       useable in labs until someone discovers that they can be used as
sensitive
       mass detectors. Their power use goes up with the mass to be tractored and
       by measuring their poweruse they can be used as detectors.
13     Impulse drives. Thrustproducing engines that break the conservation of
       momentum and energy.
14     Smaller impulsedrives
15     Short range practical tractorbeams used to deflect missiles and dock
ships.
16     Long range tractor beams. Used to stear ships into planets etc.

Stop blurting and get back to work (I say to myself)

Put your money where your mouth is, David.  Post your system of

Yes.  I told Marc that too.  If you have skills and stats on a 1-15 
scale, you\'re looking at target numbers like KBv2.0 has.  

You\'ll have to use 2-7 dice to get the percentages where they need to

I think you\'d better wipe off your glasses.  I kept the first 73 
posts that came in about the task change.  I still have them, and I 
can quote from them if you like.

Here\'s the break down:

Of the first 73 votes for task change, there were only 8 that voted 
for MT.  Those people were--

Now, I know that some of these people have changed their vote or made

But, clearly, KBv2.0 has a significant number of supporters--I\'d 
wager much more than the MT system does.

This is a big plus for KBv2.0.  It fits in nicely, with minimal 
changes, and you can use the rest of T4 the way it is.

Not so with MT.

Actually, I use the MT system for time.  I don\'t think that aspect of 
MT is busted at all.  And, it has nothing to do with either task 
system.  We could be using the TNE task system and use MT\'s elegant 
time roll to find time.

But other systems that use Stat + Skill have the two factors
contributing roughly equal portions to the target number. For example in
Ars Magica 3rd, stats ranged between +/-5 and skills generally went up
to about 4-5 (unless the character was very focused). Interestingly
there were a lot of people who felt that that over-emphasised the stat
(even though its much less extreme than T4); so ArM4 has toned down the
stat range (you need to spend virtues to get them above +3 now) and
beefed up skill progression rules (so skills can now much more easily
reach the 3-6 range).

I don\'t think anyone went so far as to say that ArM3 was \'broken\', but I
saw plenty of comments (both within the online ArM community and over on
rec.games.frp.misc) to the effect that it undervalued skills.

I think you\'re on to an important point here. To give a computer analogy,
Pseudocode - clear textual definitions which are converted by the programmer
into the language they are using. One of the great advantages of defining
tasks as text as opposed to numbers is they become very easy to convert from
one system to another. The author of the source product is after all giving
a guide as to the difficulty, which you as gamemaster have a right to
change,tweak or ignore.(Honest, a group of balaclava clad I.G. thugs will
not come round to your house - "We are the Traveller inquisition....."
[author looks over his shoulder just in case]). The main thing is your
players go home thinking "That was a great game, I can\'t wait for next one."
and always has been. This should be dependent of the quality of the game
content not the mechanics used.

The first half of \'The Reality Dysfunction\' includes a similar plot (the

couple of other near-future, post-global warming novels set in East
Anglia of all places...). The book itself is 80% great. The revelation
of the who precisely the main adversaries were was a bit of a let down
and the last third of the book had some really *stupid* situations that
broke my suspension of disbelief entirely. A pity really, because there
were lots of well done Traveller tropes otherwise (and some really
*mean* enhanced mercs with extremely big guns :). I\'ve already decided
that Kinetic Lances are coming into any Traveller campaigns that I run
in future.

Recommend with reservations.

I think I see a mismatch in assumptions. Are you basing your analysis on
permitting players to *pick* from the skill lists? IIRC thats an
optional rule in T4 (and not a great one IMO, since it invites all sorts
of mini-maxing abuses unless heavily policed). I might allow *one* skill
per term to be picked during chargen (so that players can focus their
efforts into a skill that they really want their characters to have at a
useful level) but that would be it. The rest get rolled and if they\'re
rolled then its an iterating probability, which severely curtails the
number of high skill levels that characters end up with.

David:
<<Another way of looking at it is that characters have a
base of 0 for skills and 7 for stats.  It just that the
random part of the generation system gives characters 
a chance of having a bonus or penalty (this will be a
+2 to a -2 for 2/3 of the characters) in certain types
of skills to reflect talent.>>

True. Or +3 to -3 from a base of 8 (if we are being true to the 1 - 15
range that represents the limits of human possibilities). But skills
will still tend to range from 0 to +3 if they are being randomly
assigned (from groups of six admittedly). Which means that they have a
smaller typical range and thus will contribute a smaller proportion of
the typical target numbers used by T4, even though stats are a more
fundamental attribute and therefore contribute in many more areas than
skills (unskilled tasks, stat checks etc). I agree with you about the
need to make stat increases more expensive in chargen BTW, although the
need becomes less pressing if stats are toned down in the task system.

This is a *great* idea.  The distinction between Space Opera and Hard SF
could be made in another way too.  T4.1 and KB 2.0 both allow very high
degrees of success with Staggering and Impossible tasks. A high skill,
high stat character (5-6 skill 10+ stat) will have an 80% chance with
Staggering tasks and a 40-60% chance with Impossible tasks.  This is fine
for Space Opera, but is wholly unreasonable for anything resembling hard
SF. 

I\'d recommend that one system be T4.1, it\'s Easy to use, and the essence
of Space Opera (highly talented beginners can accomplish wonders). 

For the Hard SF system use some version of MT (the Skill+Stat/3,
4,8,12,16,20 system works for me, but the old MT system could be used.  
You\'d need to add in Staggering tasks, but that wouldn\'t be too hard.  

In this system, like in real life (but unlike Space Opera) the skilled
doctor (or physicist, or marksman) will beat the brash beginning most of
the time, and some tasks have a very low chance of success for even the
best people unless they are very careful (ie drop the difficulty level by
one by taking extra care). 

Include both systems in the main rule book, right next to each other.
clearly label each as to what results it produces, and let folks decide on
the basis of what type of campaign they want. 

Marc, does this sound reasonable?

Its been an interesting ride so far and I look forward to hearing about
how Marc\'s redesign goes. I haven\'t had a chance to properly evaluate
the various contenders that folk have been posting, so I\'m a Task System
Agnostic. What I think a final framework should do:

1	Declare its assumptions (does skill 4 represent an MD in
practice or a commercially qualified pilot? Then say so.)
2	Match those assumptions. Skills represent knowledge in depth.
Stats represent talent in breadth. The mechanics should favour the
skilled specialist over the talented intern IMO. If I\'m flying into
combat; I want a graduate of Top Gun as my wingman, not some kid off a
farm who\'s dusted a few whomp-rats from the back of his speeder (sorry
Luke....).
3	Retain compatibility of terms (at least) with existing T4
products. There\'s an installed base out there folks. I\'m blessed with a
high disposable income and no other expensive addictions, so I can shrug
off spending UKP20 on a book whose guts are invalidated within 6 months.
I am an exception. IG should not base their marketing strategy on
deluded fools who will buy anything (not that they will).
4	Integrate the task framework with the chargen framework (obvious
I know, but these things should be stated). Someone coming out of a 12
year hitch in <blah> should have skills to reflect that experience. They
should be professionally competant (according to the declared
assumptions from point 1) in at least one skill cluster related to their
previous employment. Possibly two or three if they are exceptional.
5	Recognise that no system is going to be a complete solution that
will satisfy everyone (or even most people). As far as possible it
should provide a clear statement of principles (see 1 above) and
definitions so that the inveterate tinkerers have a common base to work
from. If those principles are expressed in natural English then it
should be possible to have many different flavours of Task resolution
that retain compatibility in their descriptive terms ( Rob\'s idea of a
hard SF system, a space opera system etc.)
6	Dice? I don\'t care. I\'ve used any number of strange dice in my
time. Traditionally Traveller is a D6 system, so I\'m inclined that way.
But I\'ll use anything and everything if it gives me a useful (and
readily comprehensible) probablity distribution. Hell, sometimes I go
diceless, use cards or toss coins.

Thats all for now folks....

  I can\'t say I really care what sort of task system actually gets
published - I\'ll likely use my own version of the MT task system, since
that\'s what i prefer.  The recent discussions I\'ve heard have convinced me
that that\'s the way to go, especially since I tend to favor a system that
stresses skill over stats.  This list should convince anyone of that - the
degree of knowledge shown by individuals here is due to training in a
specific area, rather than the polymath idea - while I consider myself
rather well educated, especially as a historian, there are areas that I
would never trust myself to do as well as someone with even the most basic
of training.  Any system, KBv2.0 or otherwise, that gives equal weight to
stats as to skills just does not work for me.

  One other comment - while part of my dislike for KBv2.0 comes from the
large number of dice and the way it treats skills vs. stats, I must admit
I get really turned off by the way Kenneth goes about making his
arguements.  I\'m sure he\'s a nice guy in person, but he sure comes across
as a jerk when talking about his task system on TML.

  Anyway, put me down for a vote for a MT-like system, one that stresses
skill over stats, and a firm no to KBv2.0 and the T4 systems.

Indeed.  But those skills are just as easily obtained in a career 
(with far more choice).  And it certainly seems as if it will be 
easier to get an Edu increase from that career, for a 
decently-educated character...

I heard a couple of days ago that English Lit. and History graduates 
were in enormous demand by employers.  I have some major doubts about 
the statistic, but in general employers are looking for adaptability, 
ability to present a reasoned argument and social skills in their new 
employees -- even relatively technical firms IME.  These summarise as 
high Int, high Edu, and "social" skills; assuming the first is more 
or less unaffected by education (debatable...) college is providing a 
little technical training, some social opportunities and some general 
Edu.  Part of the reason for "graduate only" jobs is the 
self-selection of graduates as high-Int and (on entry) relatively 
high Edu, but in general it\'s the Edu increase which makes them 
valuable; the company will teach relevant skills.

Now this is entirely consistent with characteristics being more 
important than skills -- I\'ve always said it was true in real life -- 
and also more general.  That\'s why a college education is so 
important: it *reliably* gives a boost to Edu (and can be exploited 
to improve it enormously -- it depends on what else you do).

    'body' => 'Hi All,

Kenneth, you asked me why I and others had found KBv2.0 unsatisfactory. H=
ere goes -

* Kenneth asked me for the various reasons why people did not like the KB=
v2.0 system. There were
  several -

  (a) That KBv2.0 ( and T4 for that matter ) did not preserve the look an=
d feel of Traveller.
      Traveller uses 2D task rolls. Anything else ain\'t Traveller. It\'s l=
ike playing RuneQuest and
      making task rolls on 2D - RuneQuest is a percentile game.

  (b) They wanted to get on and play the game, not spend any time learnin=
g a new task system
      when they already knew one thoroughly which WORKED.

  (c) They wanted to have estimations of how long things took to do, and =
they wanted fine resolution
      of failures to enhance the possibilities for role-playing, and to g=
ive them a consistent
      and fair evaluation of that failure rather than relying on the refe=
ree\'s arbitrary decisions.
      MT\'s time increment and mishap system provided that. KBv2.0 has no =
such systems except for
      SF, which was just ONE level of extreme failure.

  (d) Some of them pointed out the x56 flaw below, which destroyed their =
confidence in the system
      overall. They saw this as highly unbalanced compared to MT.

  (e) Those players who had low stat characters felt considerably disadva=
ntaged amongst their fellows.
      Suddenly Int 5 was a major handicap for a character. Characters tha=
t had been played for years
      were altered overnight ; no one wanted their character "crippled" i=
n this way.
      =

  (f) At the other extreme, it devalued things. A player whose favourite =
character had Gun Combat-6 and Dex 7 =

      felt a real sense of achievement whenever he made an Impossible tas=
k roll ( 19+, +6 for skill, +1 for Dex is
      12+ ). With KBv2.0, his needed to roll less than 25 on 7D, where th=
e average roll is 24-25. In other
      words, he would now succeed half the time. The sense of achievement=
 went out the window - Impossible
      was no longer Impossible for him. There was no "challenge" in the g=
ame anymore.

* Multiple dice systems have a serious flaw, as follows -

  Consider the following individuals. One has Edu 2, Medic 1. The other h=
as Edu 2,
  Medic 2. Under KBv2.0, their target numbers are 5 and 8 respectively.

  For a 2D task, the chances of success are 10/36 for target number 5 and=
 26/36 for
  target number 8. So far so good. The Medic-2 has roughly twice the chan=
ce of the
  Medic-1. This doesn\'t seem unreasonable.

  For a 3D task, the chances of success are 10/216 for target number 5 an=
d 56/216 for
  target number 8. In other words, Medic-2 now has FIVE TIMES the chance =
of succeeding on
  a 3D task as the Medic-1 guy.

  For a 4D task, the chances of success are 5/1296 for target number 5 an=
d 70/1296 for
  target number 8. In other words, Medic-2 now has FOURTEEN TIMES the cha=
nce of succeeding on
  a 4D task as the Medic-1 guy.

  For a 5D task, the chances of success are 1/7776 for target number 5 an=
d 56/7776 for
  target number 8. The Medic-2 guy now has FIFTY-SIX TIMES the chance of =
success as the
  Medic-1 guy.

  Get the picture ?

  This is actually a fundamental flaw of "variable" dice systems. The "ga=
p" between skill
  levels varies considerably per difficulty level and _widens_ both unfai=
rly and rapidly.
  Medic-2 should never be 56x as good as Medic-1, and certainly not as th=
e difficuly increases.

  Here are the results for Edu 7 ( average Education ).

  Dice           Edu 7, Medic-1        Edu 7, Medic-2          Skill Gap
                 Target is 10          Target is 13

  2              33/36                 36/36                   x 1.09
  3              108/216               181/216                 x 1.676
  4              206/1296              575/1296                x 2.791
  5              252/7776              1182/7776               x 4.690

  Although the trend is not so pronounced, it is _still_ there. Why shoul=
d a one point difference
  in skill give higher relative chances as difficulty increases ?

  Now, let\'s compare that with the MT system. I am doing this from memory=
, so please excuse any
  errors that may creep in -

  Edu 2, Medic 1, Average Task - Basic Roll 7+ , +1 for skill, +0 for sta=
tistic =3D 6+ ( 21/36 )
  Edu 2, Medic 2, Average Task - Basic Roll 7+ , +2 for skill, +0 for sta=
tistic =3D 5+ ( 25/36 )
  Medic-2 is x1.19 more successful than Medic-1 ( compare to x2.6 for KBv=
2.0 )

  Edu 2, Medic 1, Difficult Task - Basic Roll 11+ , +1 for skill, +0 for =
statistic =3D 10+ (  6/36 )
  Edu 2, Medic 2, Difficult Task - Basic Roll 11+ , +2 for skill, +0 for =
statistic =3D  9+ ( 10/36 )
  Medic-2 is x1.66 more successful than Medic-1 ( compare to ~x5 for KBv2=
=2E0 )

  Edu 7, Medic 1, Average Task - Basic Roll 7+ , +1 for skill, +1 for sta=
tistic =3D 5+ ( 25/36 )
  Edu 7, Medic 2, Average Task - Basic Roll 7+ , +2 for skill, +1 for sta=
tistic =3D 4+ ( 28/36 )
  Medic-2 is x1.12 more successful than Medic-1 ( compare to x2.6 for KBv=
2.0 )

  Edu 7, Medic 1, Difficult Task - Basic Roll 11+ , +1 for skill, +1 for =
statistic =3D 9+ (  10/36 )
  Edu 7, Medic 2, Difficult Task - Basic Roll 11+ , +2 for skill, +1 for =
statistic =3D  8+ ( 15/36 )
  Medic-2 is x1.5 more successful than Medic-1 ( compare to ~x5 for KBv2.=
0 )

  So, while there is an increase for MT, it is much smaller than the incr=
ease for KBv2.0, and
  is much more believable. Also, the ratio of Medic-2 success to Medic-1 =
success for MT never
  exceeded the ratio of Medic-2 Skill Level : Medic-1 Skill Level. Allowi=
ng for rounding, the
  two ratios are pretty much the same !

  C\'mon Kenneth, are you seriously expecting me to believe that for a 5D =
task roll, a Medic-2 guy is
  56 times as good as Medic-1, yet for a 4D task roll he\'s only 14 times =
as good ?? =

  =

  NO WAY.

* MegaTraveller has a built in method for determining how long a task tak=
es. KBv2.0 has no such
  method. This is useful for time-critical tasks - the character can esti=
mate how long something
  will take ( 10x the time increment on the task is the AVERAGE time take=
n ) and whether it\'s
  worth doing or even possible. Also, the time for a hasty task or a caut=
ious task can be determined, =

  and the bonus/penalty for this can be easily determined.

* KBv2.0 equates 1 point of characteristic with 1/3 of a point of skill. =
MegaTraveller is more extreme
  and equates 1 point of characteristic with 1/5 of a point of skill. Per=
sonally I feel that
  MT is closer here than KBv2.0 - consider that Education is the SUM TOTA=
L of a person\'s education,
  and includes much information that is irrelevant to an individual task =
attempt.

* Kenneth claims that because the chance of regular success can decrease =
in MT as skill level increases,
  MT is flawed. Actually, the OVERALL chance of success increases in MT a=
s skill level increases,
  and the chance of Exceptional Success likewise increases. This means th=
at our Medic-2 guy gets
  ES more often than our Medic-1 guy. This is surely correct.

* MT has the Mishap system, which provides referees with a guideline as t=
o how badly someone has
  screwed up and the time taken to effect repairs. KBv2.0 has no such sys=
tem. Also, MT allows for
  Hazardous and Fateful tasks, which affect the expected level of mishap =

  just has one level of screw-up, the Spectacular Failure. MT is therefor=

  don\'t have to accept an arbitrary outcome from the referee each time th=

  there is a consistent mechanism for such things.

So, I put it to you that KBv2.0 is NOT the answer. MT is much better.

Just a quick response as to where I think KBv2.0 is broken (I think
T4.1 handles this better, but still not right).

Consider a top athlete, about to undergo his first aging crisis:
His dex drops by one, but in the same year he gains a skill point in
athletics.
Using KBv2.0 he\'s now performing better than ever before.  Those young
whipper snappers have nothing on him.  So long as he keeps going to
the race meetings and practicing he\'ll be beating them until the day
he dies...

The bits of the Imperium interested in Moot politics will probably be
surprised at it, but it is a world with a representitive recognized
by the Imperium, so it is a member world. If another Noble, Corp or
whatever tries to take over by force, then someone cries "excessive extra-
planetary influence" and/or "use of local conflict as an excuse for
interplanetary aggression" and call in the Imperial Marines.

The people on the planet would probably sort out some sort of social
structure ... anything from "Broken Hill in Space" to "Lord of the

ship out on the first transport available, and have a planet with
a constantly transient population.

I\'ve decided that all deck plans should be based on 4 dimensional
tesseracts measuring 2.83 smoots in all height dimensions, 1.2 smoots and
three ears in width, 2 smoots in length, and, of course (figred using the
4th dimensional equivalent of Pythagoras\' theorem), 1.78 smoots in the 4th
dimension measure which I call "petes" in my game.

All volumes must be multiplied by the value proportional to the distance of
the earth to the sun on game night, multiplied by a factor to make it come
out to between 1 and 10 such that the plane of ecliptic of the third
dimension is parralel to the ground (different rules apply on planets
without flat surfaces, of course).

Oh and I converted the supplement "Things You Will Never Need" by Georges
Game Shack into canon TNE measurements such that all the components will be
usable in this scale.

So throw out all your 14m^3 deck plans *and* your 13.5m deckplans.  I have
the system of the future!!!

I can\'t speak on this one with any great amount of knowledge.  This 
would be a better question for David Burden.

OK, here was my thinking on it when I did it.  Agree or disagree with 
it as you wish, but here\'s what I felt factored into it.

First of all, this is truly foreign investment.  This is not a 
foreign aid third world/first world giveaway situation.  It 
represents a situation where corporate interests on World X are 
investing in improvements on World Y.  The cost as reflected includes 
all of the following:

A) Shipment of materials to world X from world Y.
B) Shipment of engineers, architects, scientists, construction 
workers (and their families incidentally, since most of the PE scale 
construction projects would be multi-year affairs).  
The additional cost associated with supporting all of these extra 
workers, and storing/utilizing these extra materials.
C) Transportation costs
D) Incidentals and unforeseen costs
E) A certain amount of equity in (or in many cases, perhaps even 
outright ownership) of the newly constructed assets in question.
F) Development of support network, infrastructure, etc. to 
effectively utilize the development in question.

Why did I go with the formula I did?  

Four reasons:
1) I wanted the costs to reflect equity in the development of World 
Y, not just the raw cost of shipping materials to World Y.  As the 
basis of Traveller is economics, World X has a compelling reason to 
develop World Y only if economics, or to a lesser extent politics 
dictate a pressing need.

2) Play balance.  At a certain point, a larger pocket empire, with 
3-4 HiPop worlds could develop every world in the empire quickly and 
cheaply, without regards to realism if costs were lower, and then 
gobble up his opponents.  

3) A better fit with the Traveller universe.  If it is free and cheap 
to develop worlds within a pocket empire in Year 0, how come every 
world in the Imperium isn\'t TL 15, high population, etc in year 1100? 
 There has to be one or several compelling economic reasons why every 
world in year 1100 doesn\'t look like Capital.  I felt the high cost 
of development relative to return in a lot of instances provided a 
compelling reason why.   The relatively high cost makes the pocket 
emperor choose the targets for development more carefully, because he 
can\'t afford to develop them all.  This is more fitting with what the 
Imperium eventually becomes by year 1100.

4) Playability.  1 of the things I notice about a lot of questions 
regarding why this or that wasn\'t done with PE, is that these 
questions are asked in isolation.  I wish the system lent itself well 
to that sort of tinkering, but it really doesn\'t.

The interesting phenomenon that Joe Walsh and I noticed in working on 
PE was that we couldn\'t tweak one variable in isolation.  There are 
about two dozen independent variables in the economic portion of the 
book, ALL of which were highly interdependent.  We\'d tweak something 
minor in the name of realism.  The next thing you knew, we\'d 
run the model on Excel, and then we\'d have 20 hours worth of 
arguments on IRC over exactly how to proceed in fixing everything 
we\'d wrecked in the name of adjusting one variable for the sake of 
realism.  

A prime example of this was the table which translates the Trade 
Classifications into modifiers to the resource roll for the economic 
extension.  I know for a fact that that was the subject of at least 
20 man-hours of development time.  That was one table...now look at 
how many tables were in PE\'s economic chapters, and you get a good 
idea of how daunting this task really was.  

There came a point where we had to simply stop tinkering with the 
system, and just get it cast in stone in time to be playtested so 
we could meet deadlines.

I considered it, but rejected it for simplicity.  In addition, there 
is a very real cost to shipping all those materials in faster (but 
lower cargo volume) J2-3 ships.  I figured that much of the savings 
would probably be lost in the smaller cargo holds, and greater fuel 
expense.  Not perfect, I admit, but workable.

	David: strangely enough, I\'ve been slowly, in the one or two
uncommitted hours a week I have, been trying to kitbash a few modifications
to RPSCS.  I started out with the following, which assumes a proportional
movement chart rather like StarFleet Battle\'s.


	Essentially, What the following is is an attempt to render RPSCS
movement a little bit more Newtonian, and add a little bit more granularity
to the resolution; movement and attack/defence gets resolved on the minute
level.  It also tries to incorporate USD Size Rating at several levels (I
knew that had to be good for something :>).  Where I encountered problems
was with resolving damage; the USD weapons rating is, I believe an
aggregate abstraction of the amount of damage the weapon does in a turn.
RPSCS resolves hits and damage once per turn.  I wanted to resolve them
once per minute, but had no clue as to how to unaggregate the hits/damage.
Any suggestions?


	The Movement Chart referred to in the text would look something
like the table below: velocities (in hexes/increments of time) are placed
in Velocity columns, and increments of time in rows; the Caller reads down
the rows for each increment and each player moves his ship counter as each
increment is resolved. This is a crude example of what I\'m talking about:

	Velocity Columns
		6	5	4	3	2	1
Increments

1		1	1	1
2		2	2		1
3		3		2		1
4		4	3		2
5		5	4	3
6		6	5	4	3	2	1


	This chart only assumes speeds of up to 6 hexes/increment and only
6 increments/turn, but you get the idea.  The finished version will be able
to handle ludicrously high velocities and be divided into 30 1-minute rows.
The Movement Chart Counters referred to below are simply placed along the
top, on the appropriate Velocity Column.

	Oh yes: I wrote this assuming the use of KB v.2.0, but I\'m sure
that any other task system could be adopted.


Darroch\'s Vaguely Newtonian RPSCS Movement Rules.

"Things in motion tend to remain in motion, things at rest tend to remain
at rest"

1. Movement

1.1 Movement Points: As with RPSCS 0.9, Movement Points are used (MP).  MP
reflect the change in the ship\'s kinetic energy that its drive is capable
of making in any given turn.  Each ship has one MP per turn for every G of
acceleration it is capable of; thus a 1G ship may spend one MP per turn,
while a 9G Famille Spofulam Crescent-class (the one that\'s like the
Moonshine but with a big PA gun) will have 9 MP to spend in that turn.  One
MP may be considered to be the amount of energy required to accelerate 1
hex/turn.


1.2 Facing Changes: As with RPSCS 0.9, hex sides are labelled A through F.
There is no MP cost for changing faces in most cases; changing ship\'s
attitude is done by the ship\'s attitude control system.

1.2.1 Larger Vessels: Some vessels are so large that they take a
significant portion of a turn to rotate 60 degrees; this will affect the
time they are able to spend boosting and thus their total time
accelerating, therefore reducing their number of MP.  To determine whether
a vessel suffers an MP penalty for facing changes, take the displacement of
the vessel in tons and divide by 5; divide this result by the vessel\'s
G-rating* and round up; this is the time required to rotate 180 degrees.
Divide this result by 3 to obtain the time required to change a single
facing.  Then, divide 30 (the number of minutes in a turn) by the vessel\'s
G-rating; this is the amount of time needed to spend an MP.  If the time
required to make any given facing change exceeds 33% of the time required
to spend an MP, the vessel loses an MP for making that facing change.


Example 1: 50Td 6G Fighter:

Time to 180: (50/5)/6=1.666 rounded up to 2.
Time to 60: 2/3, or .666 seconds.
Time per MP: 30/6= 5 minutes.
33% of Time per MP: 99 seconds.

	Thus, a 50 Td 6G fighter suffers no MP penalty for a facing change.

Example 2: 700Td 4G Patrol Vessel:

Time to 180: (700/5)/4=35 seconds.
Time to 60: 35/3= 11.666 rounded up to 12 seconds.
Time per MP: 7.5 minutes.
33% of Time per MP: 148 seconds.

	Thus, this vessel suffers no MP penalties for facing changes either.

Example 3: 5,000 Td 1G Bulk Carrier

Time to 180: (10,000/5)/1= 2,000 seconds.
Time to 60: 2,000/3= 666.666 seconds or 11 minutes.
Time per MP: 30 minutes.
33% of Time per MP: 10 minutes.

	Thus, this vessel will suffer a 1-MP penalty per making a facing
change.  In fact, it\'s so darn slow and bulky it takes a full turn just to
do a 180.


1.3 Acceleration:  A vessel may accelerate by spending MP.  Acceleration is
along the vector in which the vessel\'s bow is pointing.  It is announced at
the beginning of each turn.  The effects of the acceleration during the
turn are reflected by moving the vessel\'s Movement Chart Counters onto the
appropriate Velocity Columns after it has spent each MP.  This movement is
made the minute _after_ the velocity in question has been reached.

Example 4: The 6G fighter above, spending all 6 MP\'s on accelerating along
Vector A (without any facing changes) from a standing start.  At Minute 6,
it will be moving at 1hex/turn: its Vector 1 Movement Chart Counter is
moved onto the 1 hex/turn Velocity Column.  At Minute 11, its Vector 1
Movement Chart Counter is moved onto the 2 hex/turn Velocity Column.  At
Minute 16, its Vector 1 Movement Chart Counter is moved onto the 3 hex/turn
Velocity Column.  At Minute 21, its Vector 1 Movement Chart Counter is
moved onto the 4 hex/turn Velocity Column.  At Minute 26, its Vector 1
Movement Chart Counter is moved onto the 5 hex/turn Velocity Column.  At
Minute 1 of the next turn, its Vector 1 Movement Chart Counter is moved
onto the 6 hex/turn Velocity Column.  All the while, the Caller has been
instructing the fighter\'s Pilot when to move.


1.4 Vectors:  The Hex map is split up into 6 Vectors, A through F, which
are plotted from the facings of the same letter off the bottom right hex of
the map.  Thus, Vector A is straight up the map; Vector D is straight down
the map.  Vector B is 60 degrees clockwise from Vector A, and Vector E is
its opposite.  Vector C is 120 degrees clockwise from Vector A, and Vector
F is its opposite.  Each vessel has three Vector Movement Chart Counters;
the Vector 1 Movement Chart Counter represents velocity along Vectors A and
D, the Vector 2 Movement Chart Counter represents velocity along Vectors B
and E, and the Vector 3 Movement Chart Counter represents velocity along
Vectors C and F.

	Acceleration is declared along the Vectors.  Thus, in example 4,
above, the fighter\'s Pilot would declare that he was spending all 6 MP\'s
accelerating in Vector A.  This would result in the fighter having a
Velocity of 6 along Vector A at the beginning of the second turn.  This
vessel would then have only one Movement Chart Counter on the Movement
Chart, at Velocity Column 6.

	However, for pressing tactical considerations, he could amend this
declaration partway through the turn; he could make a 60 degree facing
change so his vessel would then be facing along Vector B.  Assuming he made
this change immediately after attaining a 2 hex/turn velocity, he could
spend the remaining 4 MP on accelerating along Vector B.  His velocity
along Vector A would remain with the fighter\'s Vector 1 Movement Chart
Counter would remain on the Movement Chart on Velocity Column 2, and the
Caller instructing him to move on the appropriate Minutes.  However, by the
end of the turn its Vector 2 Movement Chart Counter would be on Velocity
Column 4, and the fighter would be moving 2 hexes along Vector A and 4
hexes along Vector B.


1.5 Deceleration:  Deceleration works much the same as acceleration; if the
fighter in the above example wished to cancel its motion along Vector A, it
would have to rotate so as to face down Vector D, and spend 2MP and the
time required thrusting along Vector D.  Acceleration would be treated as
above, save that the fighter\'s Vector 1 Movement Chart Counter would be
moved down to Velocity 1 after the first MP was spent, and down to Velocity
0 after the second was spent.  The fighters only remaining motion,
therefore, would be at 4 hexes/turn along Vector B.


1.6 The Role-Playing in All This: The Pilot\'s task in flying the ship is
computing vectors and velocities, and pointing the ship in the appropriate
direction, applying the proper amount of thrust, and so forth.  In most
circumstances, as the shipboard computer will be of great assistance,
facing changes, acceleration, and deceleration are simply made with Easy
rolls.  However, stress in combat can take a toll on the pilot\'s
effectiveness.  These modifiers apply:

Ship is in combat: task becomes Average.
Ship is in combat against superior odds: task becomes Difficult.



1.6.1 Staying in Control: Weapons hits can make life difficult by damaging
attitude control systems, by explosions throwing the ship off its heading,
by lost systems and boiled-off armour shifting the ship\'s center of
gravity, by ship\'s atmosphere venting to space, thereby acting as an
unexpected thrust in an odd vector, and so on.  Therefore, the following
rolls must be made whenever the following systems are damaged by (refer to
the damage effects table) enemy fire:

Staying in Control following a hit: a Difficult test of Dex and Piloting,
with the following DM\'s applying cumulatively:

For points of armour vapourized by a single hit: a negative DM of (number
of points of armour hit/2)-(ship\'s USD size rating).

Exterior System: a negative DM of 10-(ship\'s USD size rating) to stay in
control.

Weapon Mount: a negative DM of 12-(ship\'s USD size rating) to stay in control.

Launch Facility: a negative DM of 14-(ship\'s USD size rating) to stay in
control.

Weapon Battery: a negative DM of 14-(ship\'s USD size rating) to stay in
control.

Fuel Tank: a negative DM of 16-(ship\'s USD size rating) to stay in control.

Maneuver Thruster: a negative DM of 18-(ship\'s USD size rating) to stay in
control.

Failure on a Staying in Control Roll means that a Restabilization Roll, a
Formidable test of Intelligence and Piloting, must be made in order to
restabilize the ship without loss of an MP.  Spectacular failure on a
Staying in Control Roll means that an MP is lost and the Restabilization
Roll is made at Staggering difficulty and will take 1d6 Minutes to
Restabilize.  Failure on a Restabilization Roll results in a lost MP; the
ship will take 1d6 minutes to Restabilize following a subsequent successful
Restabilization roll.  Spectacular failure results in a lost MP and means
that the ship will take 2d6 minutes to restabilize following a successful
Restabilization Roll at Staggering difficulty.

	While a ship is Destabilized, i.e. tumbling like a shot pigeon,
Weapons Firing Tasks are made with a negative DM of 18-(ship\'s USD Size
Rating)

* The vessel\'s G-rating will generally reflect how strongly its structure
is built and hence its ability to withstand centrifugal stresses.

designed to be a "companion race" for adventures with the Geonee. It has
been revised since the first post. Thanks are due to Joseph "Chepe" Locket
and Nick S. Munn for very helpful comments.

        Carlos the Geonee-maker ;-)

================================================================================

The Llyrnians

	One minor alien race plays an important role in the Geonee Confederation.
Its homeworld, Llyrn (0931 D333AA7-A Na Po HiPop  933  F8 VI)  is a cold
world, a satellite of a gas giant orbiting a small star. It\'s upper crust is
full of huge natural caves. Life appeared on these caves around geothermal
energy sources, and most of the native life forms are subterranean,
cave-bound or tunnel-dwellers.
	Life processes are mostly based on sulfur consumption for energy
production, leaving sulfur-rich waste products. The higher life forms in the
planet, such as the Llyrnians themselves, have in addition a secondary
metabolism which uses oxygen from the atmosphere to convert the waste
products back to organosilicates and sulfur. This latter process produces
SO2 gas as a waste, which is exhaled in order to cool the organism, and is
the reason of the typical brimstone smell of the Llyrnians.
	The Llyrnians are based on a trilateral symmetry, with three "legs" on the
bottom part of a cylindrical "body" from which three "arms" spread. Three
"mouths" open under the arms for feeding purposes. The body is covered by a
tough external coat made of organosilicates, and the arms end in tough
claws. The Llyrnians dig the tunnels "upwards" using all three claws. They
are able to make the arms and claws vibrate in order to loose the rocks.
	The main sensorial organs are three "ears" built into the arms, which give
Llyrnians a broad vibration-perception which makes them able to sense both
vibrations in the rocks in which the tunnels are drilled, and the faint
noises that are transmitted by the very thin atmosphere. Also, three
vibrating membranes on the upper part of the body give them a limited
"sonar" capability.
	The body ends in a "head" which holds the secondary sensorial organs,
basically three breathing orifices which also function as smelling "noses"
and are able to produce noises for communication, and a visual band which
circles the whole head. The vision centers on the infrared part of the spectrum.
		
	The Llyrnians biology is based on a triploid genetic system. They have
three sexes, usually referred to as "Warrior", "Delver", and "Feeder".
Feeders give birth to one or two newborns (almost always of the same sex)
after a gestation period of 112 standard days.
	Genders are specialized. Warriors defend the community, Delvers build the
tunnels and Feeders take care of the children.
	The average weight of a Llyrnian is 60 kilograms for Warriors and Delvers
and 80 for Feeders. The average height is 1.5 meters for the three sexes.
	Special rules: The UPP for Llyrnians is different for the three sexes.
Dwellers: Str= 2D-2, Dex= 2D+1, End= 2D, Int= 2D, Edu= 2D, Soc= 4+1D
Warriors: Str= 2D, Dex= 2D+1, End= 2D, Int= 2D-1, Edu= 2D-2, Soc= 2+1D
Feeders: Str= 2D-2, Dex= 2D-2, End= 6+1D, Int= 2D-2, Edu= 2D-2, Soc= 1D

Society and Culture

	The Llyrnian society is built upon the community, a group ranging between a
few hundreds and ten thousand individuals of the three sexes. The community
leader, always a Delver, has almost absolute powers. The members of the
community instinctively accept its authority.
	The measure of the power of a community is the extent of the tunnels and
caves it controls. So, Delvers are constantly planning new tunnels while
taking care of the stability of already settled ones, while Warriors
perpetually try to capture those belonging to rival communities, while
defending the own settlements.
	The "tunnel fights" are ruthless battles fought in narrow, dark tunnels.
The Warriors rely heavily on their vibration perception, infrared vision and
their sonar sense during the fights.
	The planet has been ruled as a whole by a central authority as long as
historical records exist. This central government takes the form of a
Charismatic Dictatorship in the person of the Supreme Delver, which is
designated by the previous one among the leaders of the most influential
communities. Succession takes place when the Supreme Delver reaches an
advanced age.
	The Supreme Delver does not usually interfere with the fights between the
communities, as long as they do not evolve into large-scale wars through
alliances and coalitions of communities.

History

	The Llyrnians were first contacted in year -9,070 by the neighboring
Geonee. Llyrn was then at TL 3, but the population had already exceeded the
one thousand millions figure.
	The Geonee contacted Llyrn sporadically and helped the Llyrnians to upgrade
their technology, introducing heavy machinery which allowed the Delvers to
build larger and deeper tunnels. Over the following centuries, the Delvers
acquired more and more technical knowledge, and a population explosion occurred.
	In -4,900, the Geonee were defeated by the Vilani and incorporated into the
Ziru Sirka. The Llyrnians, then at TL 7 in environment control and heavy
machinery, experienced a technological regression. Although they were
formally also incorporated into the Ziru Sirka, the few Vilani who ever
ventured into the tunnels never came back, and Llyrn was, for all practical
purposes, interdicted. Geonee historians speculate with the possibility that
some Geonee refugees spent their lives in Llyrn as technical advisors.
	In -2,235, the Nth war between the Solomani and the Vilani made the Geonee
revolt against the Vilani. During the war, thousands of Llyrnians were used
by the Geonee as starship troopers, thanks to an agreement with the Supreme
Delver, in exchange for heavy machinery. The effectiveness of the Llyrnians
in boarding operations and infiltration operations was fearsome. Low-G
adapted and relying in vibration perception, infrared vision, and sonar, the
Llyrnian Warriors easily beat the humans in a fight on the corridors of a
boarded starship, when the light goes off and the artificial gravity fails.
In addition, the Llyrnians\' vibrating claws easily drill big holes through
vacc suits, and have some possibility of breaking even combat armor. The
Geonee were able to capture hundreds of Vilani starships thanks to the
Llyrnian troops.
	The Nth war started a tradition of using Llyrnian Warriors as Marines in
Geonee ships.
	In -2,200, the Rule of Man created the Geonee Autonomous Region, which
included the Geonee worlds and Llyrn. Llyrn reached TL 8 and a population of
dozens of thousands of millions.
	In -1,776, the Long Night started. Llyrn fell to TL5 in a few centuries,
but although most tunnels had to be abandoned when the environmental
controls failed, the planet managed to retain a population over ten thousand
of millions.
	In -177, Llyrn was recontacted by the recently founded Second Geonee
Confederation. Geonee technical advisors and heavy machinery were once again
exchanged for Llyrnian Warriors.
	A century later, the Geonee Confederation offered membership to Llyrn, but
the Supreme Delver declined the offer. Nevertheless, in -81, a full
Confederation Embassy was established at Llyrn, and, in year -73, a detailed
commercial treaty was signed. Llyrn slowly became a Client State of the
Geonee Confederation.
	In Year Zero, Llyrn retains, from the commercial point of view, a heavy
dependence from the Geonee Confederation. At TL 10 and with an incredible
population in excess of ninety thousand of millions, the planet is an
excellent market for machinery and agroproducts. On the other hand, Llyrnian
Warriors can be found not only in the Geonee service, but also working for
other planets or corporations. And not only as starship troopers, but also
doing ground work in Low Gravity worlds, for example in Kiimda, the
conquered colony of the Geonee Confederation. Llyrnian Delvers also work in
several worlds with underground environments, for example in the Geonee
world of Dreva.
	The commercial balance of Llyrn is only equilibrated thanks to the
long-term contracts of Warriors and Delvers out of Llyrn, all of which have
to be negotiated through the Supreme Delver or its representatives.

> It is clear that the MT system must fixed to operate well with T4.

I think this is true.  The basic premises of the T4 task system are 
different from those of MT, and this extends beyond the task system 
proper, to e.g. the combat rules.

This does not mean that an MT-derived system cannot be or is not 
better than T4.1 or KBv2.0.  It does suggest that using an MT-based 
system in the T4 rulebook would require a large, and perhaps 
unfeasible, amount of work.

> Why don\'t we just fix T4 and be done with it?

That may be the only sensible solution.

> I\'m telling you, KBv2.0 is the answer.

We\'d noticed you telling us 8-)

Of course, the question could be "What breaks horribly for relatively 
high skill levels?" ;-)

> There is a difference between an Edu 7 and a Edu 8.

Matter of personal taste: is that difference significant?  As Ken 
says, T4.x and derivations imply yes, MT no.

That is *a* definition, but not the only one.  SS can also mean
"doing something as well as it can be done".  The effect of that is 
that easier tasks are easier to complete perfectly (like high school 
algebra tests for Feynman, as someone said) but the difference 
between perfectly and OK is small (high school kids can get 90%+ on 
algebra tests).  The harder the task, the more scope for "completion 
with complications" -- you fix the drives, but they\'re never the same 
again, for example.  Spectacular success could be running "as well as 
might be expected", more or less OK despite the damage.

The T4.x definition of SS is the "rare piece of sheer luck" Ken 
describes.

> I think that most would agree on this point.

You may be wrong.  Let\'s not take a vote, though: save the bandwidth!

And the 60%+ success rate for stat-11, skill-5 characters at *any* 
task difficulty that several people have mentioned isn\'t a problem?
It is for me, which is why I\'ve come to prefer T4.1 over KBv2.0.

Having said that, a number of the tweaks in and around KBv2.0 would 
improve and adorn T4.1, IMO.

Some of the MT ideas like the time rules, hazardous tasks, careful 
and hasty tasks, etc. are also great ideas which worked in their 
original setting and may well adapt easily to T4.1.

IYNSHO.

I dunno, there\'s a lot of people who\'ve said they\'d *like* it to be 
changed, but that\'s not the same thing.

> Now, we must all get behind one system to replace it.

I vote for TMM\'s modification of T4.1, which he will produce having 
had ample chance to consider the merits of other systems.

Handgun of some sort, aimed fire at short range (+2 because handgun 
range is short).  Joe Trooper is Dex 9, Handgun-4.  Base totals:

T4.1   13 +2 aimed
KBv2.0 21 +2 aimed

Basic task is Difficult, average roll 9 on 2.5D or 14 on 4D.  He will 
not miss under either system (unless he rolls 3 sixes under KBv2.0).
That\'s roughly equal.

Just to make life difficult, Joe\'s aiming at the gloves of a 
BD-wearer, which he can just about damage (perhaps his handgun\'s a 
Famille Spofulam design).  This makes the "to hit" task Formidable.
Average roll 10.5 on 3D, 17.5 on 5D.  Joe won\'t miss often in T4.1
(target number 13+2 = 15, max roll 18) or in KBv2.0 (target 21+2 = 
23, max roll 30) tho\' a bit more in KBv2.0.

Let\'s turn the lights out.  At short range, this gives a DM of -6.
We\'ll also make this a snapfire burst (-1 DM at short).

Target numbers are now T4.1 = 6, KBv2.0 = 14.  Under KBv2.0 Joe will 
hit 50% of the time, whereas he\'ll be lucky to do so under T4.1 
(17.6%, I make it, or roughly 1/3 the chance.)  I think T4.1 is the 
more realistic here.

Let\'s take a more extreme example, the sniper Sixten (Dex A, 
rifle-6).  Target numbers are T4.1 16, KBv2.0 28.

Sixten fires his rifle at a target at Medium range (Formidable), in the 
dark (-9 DM) at a target under partial cover (-4 DM) while on the 
move (snapfire, no penalty).

Targets: T4.1 16 - 13 = 3 (barely possible on 3D)
         KBv2.0 28 - 13 = 15 (requires an average of 3/die on 5D)

Again, I think T4.1 is more realistic here.


What this shows is that T4.1 penalties do not transfer directly to 
KBv2.0, and that this can have un-physical effects.  KBv2.0 is not as 
compatible with T4.1 as T4.1 is...

Having said which, they\'re pretty close for sensible numbers.


The reverse of the above case would be Pete Plod, stat-4 skill-1, 
firing an aimed rifle shot (+4) at a car (+3) at Short range.

T4.1 score 5, +7 = 12, hard to miss on 2.5D (car 20m away, stopped)
KBv2.0 score 7, +7 = 14, 50/50 on 4D

At medium range, Pete still hits over half the time under T4.1, and 
about 25% of the time under KBv2.0.


Norm Normal (skill-2, stat 7) has scores of 9 and 13.  Difficult 
tasks are 2.5D/4D, giving him an average chance of achieving success 
(50:50 ish) under either system.

T4.1 beats KBv2.0 on the extremes and is the same in the middle (I 
was surprised by that!).  KBv2.0 renders the high-stat character less 
superhuman, but only by making the high-skill character extremely 
powerful.

I thought this was a great idea. Then a thought occurred to me (don\'t worry
it doesn\'t happen very often :)

Why restrict it to two task systems?

Look at all the task systems that have been suggested and look for the
similarities. Each each task system the difficulties are roughly the same.
Easy, Average, Difficult, etc.....
Stats remain a constant throughout all the traveller editions (in TNE the
stats
ranged from 0 to 20, but there were still the same 6 stats).
Skills remain a constant too, roughly the same skills exist in each edition of
traveller (Vacc suit skill is always vacc suit skill).

So the constants are Skill names, stat names and difficulty levels, 
my suggestion is whenever a task is printed in an adventure or supplement
or in JTAS print it only using these things, for example:

        To put on a Vacc suit
        Average, DEX, Vacc suit
        increase difficulty level if in a confined space
        decrease difficulty level if another character is assisting

It\'s easy to understand and it\'s not specific to any task system. It\'s usable
by everyone regardless of rules system without modification (I haven\'t had
chance to check the details).

T4.1 can be printed with a single task system inside. Printing more than one 
task system may be confusing to new players (particularly to people who have 
never played an RPG).
Also the task system in the rulebook could be revised from edition to edition 
without making old supplements out of date (Like pocket empires would be if 
the task system changed now).

Common Imperial Bulk Transport.  
Originally designed for Mega Traveller and presented in the Rebellion Sourcebook.

This ship is one of the most common in the Imperium.  It forms the
backbone of most of the megacorp merchent fleets.  It is idealy suited
to hauling vast amounts of material from point a to point b, and that\'s
about all that it can do.  This ship can haul more material in one
trip, then most tramp freighters will haul in ten years.  

The ship is a cylinder, with two engine pods mounted on small
outriggers, at the front of the ship.  The bridge, living quarters and
jump drives are all mounted on the front of the cylinder, almost all of
the cylinder is taken up by cargo and fuel.  The ship is fairly
spartan, the crew quarters are nice, but nothing spectacular.  The
worst that could be said about them is that they are bland.  In fact
that goes for the ship in general, it doesn\'t even have a interesting
nick name.  But the ship is doing a bland job, moving large amounts of
material between the worlds of the Imperium.  

Here is a version of the ship using T4 rules, and one using TNE rules. 
The T4 version has more jump fuel and less cargo, but fewer crew
members. I tried to follow the original MT version as closely as
possible, the only significant thing I changed is that the orignal had
a fuel purification plant and fuel scoops.  But the ship is
unstreamlined, and can\'t use its scoops.  I also figure the megacorps
will have enough ships that they will have established their own fuel
purification plants at the starport, so they can purify fuel for many
ships.  Why have each ship carry its own purification plant, when for a
whole week it is just sitting there useless.

Well, Eris, I think Doug Berry has a _much_ better description of
skill levels at his web page, so without permission...
from http://www.hooked.net/~dberry/housrule.html, which is pretty darn funny:

An explanation of how skill levels work, from The Space Bozos

In CT, Players wanted to know what capabilities came along with
each skill level. I used Vacc Suit skill as an example.

Skill Level 0 
  Character can figure out which are the arms and which are the legs.
  Manages to hook up the plumbing with a minimal chance of messy errors.
  No meaningful repairs or maintenance possible. Took a Vacc Suit 
  familiarization seminar (1 day) at the local Hilton. 
Skill Level 1 
  Plumbing fixtures are recognized as the really important aspect of
  comfort in a Vacc Suit that they are. Can slap a patch on a hole.
  Arms vs. Legs are no problem at all. Experienced at cleaning out
  vacc suits in which the plumbing was hooked up by a level 0 user.
  Took the Vacc Suit course at the local Technical school (got an easy credit). 
Skill Level 2 
  Can hook up plumbing so well you almost don\'t notice it.
  Stitching and patching is Routine. Assigns cleaning up mistakes to
  level 1 newbies. Can make a vacc suit with the proper materials 
  and supervision. Minored in Vacc Suit in College. 
Skill Level 3 
  Plumbing can be used as a sexual aid. Knows all the tricks of messy
  clean ups (just reverse the vacuum system so...oops, sorry Jack!).
  Can make a Vacc suit with some non-standard materials. Has a B.S.
  in Vacc Suit technology. 
Skill Level 4 
  Plumbing can be an ecstatic experience. Can make a vacc suit with
  Improvised materials like Rubber Gloves, Glass fishbowls, Condoms, Super
  Polydent, Final Net hairspray, a seltzer bottle, reflective Duct
  Tape, etc. Has gone to Vacc Suit Graduate School and been in the Vacc suit
  industry. 
Skill Level 5 
  A true Demi-God of Vacc Suit technique. Occasionally hooks people
  up to vacc suits for a fee (Vacc Gigolo). Teaches at Vacc Suit University.
  Can make an improvised Vacc Suit with a case of condoms (ribbed,
  lubricated), a jar of KY Jelly and several rolls of Duct Tape. Can
  make you a tailored vacc suit that looks like a Gold Lame dress. 
Skill Level 6 
  Vacc Suits are this person\'s Life. There are still people hooked up
  to the plumbing by this person in a comatose orgasmic state. Runs Vacc Suit
  University. Always wears a vacc suit (although you\'d never know it).
  Can improvise a Vacc Suit with One condom, One Roll of Duct Tape, and a
  jar of KY Jelly. Makes Sector-wide Fashion news with their daring
  new Vacc Suit designs. 

Again, I take no credit except for having the sense to post it.

WHOAH !!! Skills on a 1-15 scale ? I don\'t think so.

Marc stated that "one skill point a year" was the target for T4. If you h=

Specialisation is for insects. Most people will allocate those 16 skill p=

 fact, a lot of
people would go further than that, and have upto 10 skills. That\'s Skill-=

Unless you are using a highly strange character generation system, Kennet=

As I proved in my earlier posting, this just isn\'t so. Multiple dice caus=

in relative skill levels - i.e Edu 2, Medic-2 is 56x as likely to succeed=
 on 5D as Edu 2, Medic-1,
but only 14x as likely on 4D. As things get harder, the gap widens.

Also, KBv2.0 makes it too easy. Gun Combat-6, Dex 7 makes an Impossible t=

In KBv2.0, you need 25- on 7D i.e. about 18x the chance under MT and actu=

Not to mention that the Terrans were probably busy doing things that,
in hindsight, were totally foolish, like trying to upgrade massive
amounts of Vilani technological infrastructure to bring it in line
with Terran "standards". For example, the massive deployment of
"Windows 2298" across the former Empire of the Stars may have single
handedly destroyed several worlds that depended heavily on computer-
controlled climate systems...

IIRC, the "capitol" of the RoM moved steadily away from Terra,
going coreward as the war front pushed farther and farther away
from Terra. At one point, the capitol of the RoM was about halfway
between Terra and Sylea, again, IIRC. No doubt the corridor between
Terra and the current capitol would contain a lot of worlds that had
signifigant high TL production capacity. In the end, at least some
of these worlds would be closer to Sylea than Terra.

Everything you say makes sense, Harold. It certainly is possible that
the RoM could have achieved TL 14 capabilities in a few fields for
a number of years, but this was all lost as the Empire crumbled. On
a historical chart, a 20 to 50 year period of partial TL-14 on a few
worlds would probably barely register, but it could result in a lot of
TL-14 vacc suits, rifles, etc being present in caches, depots, etc.


I don\'t, personally, have a big problem with throwing relic TL-14
equipment into adventures, sparingly. It\'s just that authors should be
careful that they don\'t accidentally re-write history or things like that.

Chris, as a former sniper, I was able to put 3 rounds through a half-inch
target at 150m.  Doesn\'t it stand to reason that someone with a phenominal
level of skill could find the weak point (visor, joints, etc..) and put one
round where it counts?

Plus, the game is supposed to be *heroic*.. I don\'t want to have to have to
tell a player that it\'s impossible to stop the charging Consular Guard.. I
want him to know that he has a 1-in-a-hundred chance of making the shot.. I
want to see sweat on those dice..  :)

I know this has been mentioned before, but I hope that the above example
makes it obvious:

The relationship between Characteristics and Skill *depends upon the
nature of the task*.

In gymnastic-related tasks, in general, young whipper-snappers with high
dex and lots of energy outperform the most seasoned professional.

In tasks such as auto-racing, (wheeled vehicle), many older seasoned
professionals can still hold their own.

Other tasks in the specialized sciences, physics for example, the
characteristic (Education) doesn\'t really count for much IMHO, you need
the specialized knowledge in the skill, general education won\'t help you
solve the Grand Unified Theory.


I get very tired of people insisting that their formula, or the formula
of their favourite system, weights Characteristics & Skills *correctly*.
There is no "right" way. It\'s all a matter of taste.

Personally, I\'m using Skill as an absolute measure to avoid the whole
problem. If I feel characteristics should come into play, It can be
handled as a separate task against the particular characteristic.

Hohoho!
Waitaminnit, right there, we\'re talking about average tasks here, so 
about something that\'s not outside ones experience and not very 
difficult to do! In these tasks it is not very difficult to achieve

To those of you who still think that J-drive range is the sole measure
of tech level, answer the following questions.

1) What tech does it take to Terraform a size 8 world?

2) What tech does it take to genetically alter homo-sapiens into a
   self-reproducing, stable, water-breathing variant (i.e. make a minor
   human)?

3) What tech does it take to genetically alter a non-sapient species to
   sapience (i.e. dolphins)?


All of the above were accomplished by the Terran Confederation BEFORE the
Rule of Man.

I said "not perfect"! No task system is perfect. 
Suggestion improvements does not imply that the system is broken. 
No offence, but i just don\'t like KBvXX as much as i do the MT

I love that idea, i think that this idea is one of the best things to

This is it!!!
Just print a generic desription of the task and everyone can use 
their pet system! Did i say i love this idea. Printing it out right 
now.
Good job Jonathan!

The biggest problem here is of cause in some moduals (I think it was JTAS
where they had an issue on Terra), where they go into bio-engineering
dolphins and chimps (al la David Brin Uplift). 

The assumption is that this happened before or during the RoM. (I may be
wrong, flames to thier usual adress).

I shudder to think where that level of bio-engineering fits into a TL.

Jump technolagy seems to be the defining trend with tech levels, as they
are the only thing mention in Alien Modual : Solomani. Again I would point
out that it is concevable that Terra could have been retarded compared to
the vilani when it came to discovering Jump tech, or they may have been
ultra advanced. I have no idea :-)

Again lets look at the whole Interstellar War period. It would be quite
apparent that both the Vilani and the Terran Confederacy where fighting
different wars, the Vilani fighting British colonial style, while the
Terrans used total war mentality. In fact it took the 8th Interstellar war
for it to progress to include the whole Vilani empire.

The truth is , we dont know what tech was available due to the lack of
canon material regarding the Terran Confederation. We do know they did not
use fighters (T4), but appart from that we dont know how the Terrans did
things. We have a better idea of the Vilani as the RoM and the Third
Imperium are Vilani empires with a veneer of Solomani (which is more than
likely a bastardisation of Terrans anyway (Alien Modual : Solomani, where
it mentions the Solomanisation of the Vilani)

I have always been interested with the Interstellar War, and maybe we can
use PE as a base guide on the whole period.

I enjoyed your post Harold, and maybe somehow the TML can actualy codify
the Interstellar war period, so we can stop this darn RoM artifacts flamewar.

What i don\'t understand is this: 
Do the new supplements fail to state the task difficulties and 
relevant skills and stats? If not, there is no reason not to change 
to MT, as MT doesn\'t require ANYTHING else (apart from fewer
dice!)

Why? There should always be "That one lucky shot". Of course a BD can

such is MT.

I agree. "J.", however posted a perfect solution to the dilemma: Use 
generic task desciptions in future products and offer alternatives in 
JTAS or other publications. The more people argue for another task 
system, the more willing will IG be to consider at least that! I 
don\'t need to see the MT-System in the T4.1 rulebook, (although i\'d 
be all for that!)  a one-line reference to other publications would 
be enough by all means.

Again, KBv2.0 emulates the *T4* task system as closely as possible but
addresses the skill/stat and half die problems.

In case you hadn\'t noticed, MM\'s original T4 task system was also *not* a
2D system, so I don\'t see how you can criticize KBv2.0 for this. It was
modeled after the current game, not CT or MT as you seem to be doing.

Yes, there has been a certain level of support of an MT-like system on
*this* list (which we must remember is not the come-all, end-all of
Traveller players), but MM has to consider the effects of throwing an
entirely different task system at the market. People bought T4 and have
read and are conceivably using the T4 task system, broken or not. KBv2.0
attempts to stick with the new task system paradigm but with repairs.
You\'re proposing a complete retrofit of the task system based on MT rules.
A risky business proposition when you consider the number of newbies you
risk pissing off with such a switch.

I\'m afraid you\'re wrong that "anything else [besides 2D systems] ain\'t
Traveller." TNE was most certainly Traveller (it was published by GDW) and
it used D20. T4, in its original dysfunctional state, used multiple dice
and half dice and it most certainly *is* Traveller.

You seem to have certain prejudices here based on your commitment to the
MT-like task system that are clouding your ability to offer valid and
unbiased criticism.

MT did not thoroughly work. It was satisfactory and worked well, but it was
far from perfect. T4 attempted to establish a new paradigm. If you throw a
*completely* different task system into the game now, you risk alienating
newbies and people who have just reentered the Traveller fold after sitting
out TNE or whatever.

They bought T4. They read the task system. If they buy T4.1 and see what
may be to them an *entirely* new task system (which an MT-based system
would be to newbies), there is a high possibility they won\'t be pleased.

KBv2.0 attempts to stick with the intent of MM\'s T4 task system but it
corrects the flaws.

Again, this is part of the task paradigm established by MM, not KBv2.0.
You\'re misplacing blame here. It was MM\'s T4 who decided to place dispersed
weight between stats and skills, not KBv2.0.

Your players were "crippled" by MM\'s T4, not KBv2.0. And besides,
characters with an INT 5 *should* be somewhat crippled. That\'s part of the
game. If you\'re not terribly bright, you\'re not going to be as good at a
task that requires intelligence as someone who has a much higher
intelligence. However, if you are considerably more skilled than someone
with a higher INT, you will be as good or better than him.

It sounds more and more like you\'re just trying to get the MT task system
in its original state as the official system. Your criticism would all be
better levied against MM\'s T4 rather than KBv2.0.

At higher difficulty levels, *everyone* has a reduced chance of success.
It\'s meant to reflect that a certain amount of luck is involved for anyone
at the higher difficulty levels.

You can use fractional range bands - 5000/16000/50000/160000 for some
improvement (there\'s some provision for this in my sensor rules.)

level then the player take over rolling their dice and ultimately announcing
whether or not they have succeeded.  I prefer a system where the players make
their rolls and then the GM tells them the outcome.  This not only allows the
GM to build up suspense over the outcome of the task but also allow the GM to
fix the results if they want to.  I\'ll admit that my preference does result
from many years of successfully running Champions this way.  If Marc\'s final
choice for a task system doesn\'t allow for this type of GMing then I will
probable use an variant of MT or a simplified version of CORPS.

IMHO, TL13-14 relics should be exceedingly rare.  The analogy I came up
with was Pompeii... much of what we know of Roman daily life comes from
*one* site that had the misfortune to be buried by vocanic ash.
Considering the size of the Roman Empire, and how little of it is usuable
by archeolgists for whatever reason, you can see that a cache of working
high-tech goodies will be a once in a lifetime find.

Your children enjoy an active social life, and are always open with their

work, however.

A short reminder:
One of the very first reasons you gave when you created KBv1.0 was:
"Get\'s rid of the half die!" 
So who is critizizing for preferences? 
KBv2.0 is broken as well, if you read ealier posts, just look at the

that first before you call MT broken!

I have reached the point where I am about to set a filter to remove *any*
mention of KBv2.0, and send it to the trash immediately, because I am so
offended by Kenneth\'s tone.  Mr. Bearden, I don\'t need to justify what I
like and use in my game to you, Marc Miller, or anyone but my players.  I
have played and run Traveller since 1977 and I resent your constantly
insisting that yours is the only way.

I liked MT\'s task system a great deal, but I realize that it won\'t be used
for T4.1.  What I want is to see some of the better features from that
system (task time, fateful and uncertain tasks, etc.) applied to the new
task system.  This would help me in putting together a task library that I
can use over and over again.

At this point, I think we have given Marc (remember him?  The guy who
WRITES the game?) enough feedback and opinions to allow him to make his call.

A few facts as I see them:

1>  Neither KBv2.0 or MT is going to be the new task sytem.

2>  The new task system has to be compatible with what has gone before,
since there are several thousand Traveller players who are not on the TML
who need to be able to use T4.1 without invalidating all their prior
materials.

A final note.. Several of us on the list have taken the opportunity offered
by the release of T4 to start writing for the game we have enjoyed for so
long.. Stu and Joe most notably, but a couple of us have had JTAS articles
published, or are working on things to sell to IG.

If you truly feel that your pet task system is good enough, get it
published somewhere.  Try Shadis or Pyramid or Valkryie.. they are always
starved for articles.

In this manner, you can submit you ideas to the court of public opinion,
the final arbiter of what is good in gaming.

This will be my last post on the task system arguement.  If you wish to
discuss it further, please email me.

A man after my own heart! One of my favourite periods to design 
spacecraft for is "low TL9" - societies with every aspect of TL9 except
gravitics. (For example, I like to assume the Terrans didn\'t independently
discover gravitics but copied it from the Vilani...) It\'s lots of fun to
design TL9 spacecraft without grav - I had some FFS AZHRAE shuttles I was
very proud of. My first TTA project will be a TL9 shuttle - probably 
using a gas-core NTR since AZHRAE is gone.

I have used all traveller task systems. I didn\'t like T4\'s task system so
I played with it much as many of us have. I tried the KB\'s during all
stages of their public development then settled on my own weighting.
Finally I find myself strongly in favor of a MT like 2D6 versus set target
numbers modified by DMs. This, I think, gives the referee greatest control
while allowing the player some estimate of his or her chance of success.

Having said this I am confident that Marc will develop an execellent task
system, with all of our concerns considered.

Then, of course, I\'ll test it, tweak it, toss it and forget to roll the
dice as I announce the result that provides the best dramatic plot point.

What!?

In MT, you have your generic starting target number.  You have to 
divide your stat by 5 every time you do it and get a modifier.  Then 
you use your skill as a modifier.  And, your target number has to be 
recalculated every time for every difficulty.

After you\'ve got these 4 things together, you come up with a task to 
roll.

In KBv2.0, there\'s one step--add experience and attribute together.

That\'s it.  It\'s elegant.  Your skill, stat, and target number all 
rolled up in one easy, elegant calculation.

Granted, MT is easy.  I like the system, and I\'ve used it for a long 
time.  It was my system of choice before T4 came along.

But, KBv2.0 is much easier.  One simple addition, and you are rocking 
and rolling--not fiddleing with modifers and target numbers and such.

This is a problem specific to the way that TL is defined in Traveller.
TL\'s were defined pretty much before the ongoing revolutions in genetics,
small computers, and even to a some extent materials technology. These
other things were introduced as plot devices and background as the game
and the official history evolved, and didn\'t always follow the \'rules\' for
defining TL, what there were of them.

This means, I think, that we can really only use TL to determine a few
things, primarily starship jump capability, some weapons technology, and
some transport technology. Other areas such as terraforming, geneering,
cybernetics, etc are much more nebulously associated with any given TL.

This would work GREAT if only the COMBAT rules were crossed over to using
modifiers to difficulty level, rather than target number... thusly freeing
combat from being task-system specific (as it is in T4.0).

Obviously, Kenneth has been totally *B*L*I*N*D* to the goings on of the
past 2 years on TML. T4 is NOT CT, it is NOT MT, it is DEFINITELY NOT
TNE... but mingled pieces of each, and some new stuff. Note, ken, that FF&S

Logically Flawed. Thanks to Eris, Harold, Dave, and others T4 is much more
a hybrid of CT & TNE than a revision of CT. The task system is new, and
combat is effectively new; CGen borrows more from MT than CT, and ken is
rabidly ignoring reality.

How about "Your offspring is a fine example of what the American
educational system seems to want to produce, despite the honest efforts of
the decent teachers in the system."  (Is Canada suffering from this?  I had
a friend in the American system recently get severely castigated for giving
a trig problem in which one measured the height of the mast on a yacht,
given a length of rope and an angle, as the problem was not "properly non
judgmental about economic status, and gave excessive advantage to coastal
students."

Alternatively, "Your offspring is best used as fertilizer."

I was playing an introductory adventure last night designed to get my
players into the bowels of Pocket Empires, and to soon be running their
own interstellar nations, so that, I could bring my own empire into the
fray and enjoy it thouroughly.

In coming up with an idea for how to get them to be colonizers without
using the Pocket Empires book\'s patrons etc. I came up with the
following.  Now, I don\'t have Milieu Zero so this is probably very
off-canon etc. but still, I like it.

SIRS (The Sylean Internal Revenue Service, pronounced "Cy-Ris") is
sponsering colonial expeditions into the wilds outside the Federation
(BTW, my campaign is set in -40).  Why, you ask?  Because all new
colonial regions will be under the auspices of the Sylean Federation (in
theory... I figure my players will peacefully coexist with the
Federation until Cleon declares Empire in 40 years, so I\'m giving them
some time to build a power base) and SIRS is looking to expand it\'sd tax
base.  Through skillfully manipulated deals with prospective Pocket
Emperors SIRS funds their missions, and provides that a large debt will
eb incured, as well as annual shares of the profits of the aspiring
Pocket Empire.

While, it is of course not canon, I thought up some really great
adventures for both single character and Pocket Empire play involving
SIRS, including the threat of the Revenue Service, or a faction of it
splitting off from Cleon after the declaration of Empire.  As well as
this, through into the mixture the Sylean Courier Service, Colonization
Agency and organized crime and I\'m cooking up a hefty pot of political
turmoil in the pre-Imperium days.  

What does everyone think?  And, BTW, how far is this away from Milieu
Zero \'canon\' to have several Syelan government agencies break away from
the Federation when it declares Empire.  I figured this could be true
for those who felt that their jurisdiction would be cut down, or that
their power would eb amalgamated into some new \'alien\' system.  I plan
on having the Sylean Colonization Agency take off with it\'s members
worlds as a peaceful, but relatively strong opponent to the fledgling
Imperium, as well as the Courier Service taking a few of it\'s far flung
worlds in a loose-knit Confederacy.  Organized crime\'s going to have a
hand in the pot somewhere, though I\'m not sure what they\'re cover will
be.  Then, you\'ve got SIRS with all this planets and small empires in
debt, they will have a small, but consolidated core of planets, as well
as all these debt-plagued empires to call as allies, forming a
formidable front against the Imperium, one which Cleon may not surive.

As you can, I\'m really thinking my own universe, but, regardless, it\'s
fun! :) :)  Thanks for listening, and send me comments and ideas! :)

Here are a few anecdotes from a few of the real on-going campaigns I am

1. In a TNE based campaign the hot shot pilot from the wilds, who would
rather be lording around the poor untrained crew in engineering, is often
heard responding to questions with the statement "Oh yes, _____  was an
important 2nd Imperium Emporer." Never fully realizing that the 2nd
Imperium was dominated by Solamani descended rather than his much loved
Vilani kin. All this despite the fact that he has almost no Vilani blood.

2. In a alternate Traveller universe based on a referee\'s idea of the 3rd
Imperium circa 800 a former Imperial Marine major moodly moves about the
ship slipping back and forth between Manic and Depressive states. After
having been the hero of an on-planet violent encounter, and after having
been rebuffed in an amourous proposistion to a fellow crew member, warning
buzzers go off in the bridge as an unautorized cycling of the airlock is
detected. Members of the crew rush to check on the intrusion only to find
the major unconcious on the starport tarmac. Seems he was never aware that
the ship had landed and had entered the airlock intent on ending it all in
the vast emptiness of space.

When I\'m in production, I have little time for anything else.  
Shooting and editing can sometimes be a 24 hr. a day job, and this 
will be a big shoot where I film some of the video in Houston\'s 
largest concert venue.  I also need to capture the band at different

thinking is superior to the 2 dice MT system.  I wish I had time to 
prove it to you and answer some of these well thought out and written 
posts by the MT proponents.

When I get back, maybe you will all have found the answer--whatever

I know that a lot of you think that I am a hard headed one-way 
thinker, but this couldn\'t be farther from the truth.

When I designed KBv2.0, I looked at all the options.  I believe that 
I have covered them in the system.  It is because of this (that I 
believe in the system) that I promote it--not because I designed it.

If somebody else would have designed it, I would have promoted that 
just as hard.  I can cite some examples in the past where I have done 
this--Glenn Hoppe\'s theory on Jumpspace, Glenn Grant\'s wonderful hit 
location system.

When I see something I like in Traveller--something that makes 
complete sense, I adopt it and use it.

I think that sometimes I get flack because I am perceived as pushing 
KBv2.0 only because it is my system.  This couldn\'t be farther from 
the truth.  I am man enough to admit when I am wrong, and I have done 
this most recently with my comments about the MT SS system.

That system is different from what I\'m looking for in a system, but I 
can now certainly see how some would be attracted to it.  It\'s a 
different way of looking at things, but I can see that it is viable.  
I noted this in my reply to that issue.

What I\'m trying to tell all of you here is that I am not close 
minded.  On the contrary, I am very open minded.  I promote KBv2.0 
because I believe it is the best system for Traveller--not because I 
am closed minded at looking at other systems.

Here\'s what I\'d like to do.  All of you MT proponents--put together 
the best 2 dice system you can.  Stop quibbling, band together, and 
instead of arguing moot points, do something constructive for 
Traveller and design the best 2 dice system you can.

When I get back, I\'ll take an honest look at it.  If it is good, it 
might have a chance of being adopted by T4.1.  If it is, and it is 
good, I\'ll probably use it myself--because I like to use official 
rules as much as I can.

So, stop all of this bickering.  Get organized and do something 
constructive.  

When we had the first Task System debate, this is what I did.  
Instead of endless arguments over the TML, I worked for a month or so 
to combat the issue.  KBv2.0 was the result.

Now, you can do the same thing.  You would like to see a return to 2 
dice in Traveller?  OK, fine.  What exact system would you propose?

Do something about it.  Take the initiaitive and design the best task 
system Traveller has ever seen.

Would you rather argue about moot points or do something 
constructive?

If you\'ve got something good going when I get back, I\'ll probably get 
behind you.

Good luck,

Let me start off by saying I currently use a variant of the task system that
relies rather heavily on T4/KBV. I like what the system does. I admire the
work you\'ve put into it. I appreciate that your constant championing for
change was one of if not the major reason Marc got involved in this whole
task debate. And I mean the following in the friendliest, most non-flammable
way possible, OK?

Please, give it a rest with KBV, OK? Pretty please, with sugar on top?

Your original intentions of trying to provoke a consensus that T4 needed
fixing was excellent, and quite successful. But you have since strayed into
fanaticism on this point that "KBV is the best Traveller task system ever."
That is your opinion. Others are entitled to theirs. Constantly slapping 
us in the face with it is not going to create converts, no matter how often
and loudly you shout it. Please give it a rest; you have successfully 
gotten Marc to take a look at the Task System and its problems, and you
have successfully put forth your opinion as to how to fix it. I don\'t think
there is one person on this list who is not now aware of how your system
works and why you think it is the best. Now sit back on your laurels and
let the rest of the folks state why they think that their systems are the
best.

As I said, I like your system and use it heavily in my personal variant. But
your constant championing of it has seriously gotten me to the point where
I just as often page on past your posts as read them if I see your name at the
top. I don\'t like this, you have good things to say and good ideas. But I
have gotten so irritated by your actions that I just can\'t stand to see
another
"KBV is the best thing for Traveller since Mercenaries"-toned post.

The gods know that I am not trying to stomp on your right to post whatever
you like on this list; and by all means you have every right to post KBV 
3 times a day in a dozen languages if you wish. But please, and this is
meant in the friendliest manner possible, give it a rest and let Marc hear
other peoples opinions and make up his mind so we can get back to
discussing ANYTHING ELSE on this list :)

I was wondering if there were still people on this list who were working out 
problems with the M:0/FS sector data.  It seems the Great Task Debate has 
preempted it somewhat.

In any case, I submit for your approval, my own unofficial personal changes 
to the Core Sector Data, to make it somewhat reasonable to play with the M:0 
Book.

In preparing for my campain, which takes place in Core, I did
some major homework.  Using Imperial Atlas, 1100 data off of ccjoe\'s
archives, and what MM e-mailed me, and then trying to fit it with the
M:0 background info,  I came up with a reasonbly useable Core sector.

Here are the changes I made.

First of all, Core sector needs Naval Bases, Cleon and the 3rd Imp DO
have a navy right?  I based my judgements on the aforementioned sources
and if the world had a "A" or "B" starport and if the TL was 10+.  Those
seemingly "barren worlds" with high technologies (TL-D+) I red zoned as
Naval hi tech research and other FNORDY type things, but officialy the
navy states that they are just "military training and target ranges".

Here are the systems I think should have Naval bases:

0416 Sanches
0624 Giirud
0806 Gaage
1123 Guurik  (Red Zone)
1124 Imkhasham
1134 Aursis
1518 Uungii <-- Future site of Core Depot!
1524 Shibashliim
1539 Dimanaam
1724 Guurma Sa
1736 Mished
1821 Shar (Red Zone)
1822 Anga Ke
1921 Kamiila
2008 Khekaa
2021 Shaashsha
2115 Zimiin
2118 Sylea (they should have a scout base too)
2136 Kiir (Red Zone)
2209 Nimluin
2401 Erkiim
2624 Idas
2640 Dishadshii
2709 Kimule
3028 Duuguu
3033 Ashmelam
3040 Unlakhar
3218 Kaskii (Red Zone, TL-14?)

Some worlds mentioned in the background and history of M:0 need to be
addressed.

The worlds mentioned about the Interstellar Confed are fine.

The Capital of the Chantestin Kingdom is NOT Keshi, It is obviously
CHANT!  In the 1100 data there is a Chant sector and a world called
Chant. This is one sector rimward of core sector and makes logic sence, as 
this is how it is mentioned in the M:0 text.
In the data it is 2224 "Kuula Iish" B160323-B 203.  I changed this to
2224 Chant B160664-B 203, yes it is a captured world, captured by the
Imperium!

Fornol and Shudusham, two worlds involved in the historic Shudusham
Concords, need to be addressed.

1715 Fornol was changed to another random name in MM e-mail data, change
it back.  Fornol in 1100 is an important hi pop world, and I believe it
would be in year 0 as well, and even before in circa -100 when the bomb 
killed the premier.
I used my system to change it.  It should be

1715 Fornol C5819CB-8

What is Shudusham in the M:0 book is not right.  The correct location is
2214 "Laruursha" just change the name as the UPP data is fine.

"Shudushamm" in the M:0 book should be "Nimluin" and was corected by MM

I am still trying to figure out where Santry and Cordova are supposed to
be, they don\'t seem right where they are in the M:0 book, mind you with
Keshii no longer the old Chantestin Kingdom, it makes it easy to place
them where they are in the M:0 book.

Hopefuly this is a start in the right direction :-)

John, exhibited good ability to communicate in informal situations with
peers, however he was much less adept at socialization skills required to
successfully compete in class or work environments.  John shows a good
understanding of personal stress-reduction techniques and leisure
activities, and works to provide challenged learning and work environments
for those around him.  During the term, John produced such small quantities
of work as to make it impossible to ascertain his true comprehension of
required course material, and this trend continued through his presentation
of a near pristine Final Examination. Therefore, I strongly recommend John
remain in this class for another term so his comprehension can be better
discerned.

In summary, I believe at this point, John is best suited for a career in
Government Services consumption, but with continued growth and application
of his displayed life skills he is a likely candidate for early
incarceration and frequent recidivism in our fast growing Penal System.


Hope this helps...<wink>,

Especially a Vacc Suit, as there are a lot of different systems in 
one, and IIRC TL14 is a big break-point for materials tech, and O2 
storage tanks, and self-sealing, and skin-suits. Thus to make even a 
TL14 suit implies (to me, anyway) a full range of TL13 readily 
available to the manufacturers, and a wide range of this new TL14  
stuff. All you need for the spaceship is a shiny new TL14 Jump-5 
drive.

IIRC it only moved twice. First from Terra to Dingir. And then later from
Dingir to Hub/Ershur in Massilia sector.

Yes, but the MT rules allow you to make that shot while the individual in
battledress is moving at full speed. No sniper can make that shot without a
*serious* amount of luck. Now if the battledress wearer is moving slowly or
perfectly still, sure, a shot could be made at a joint.

Consider the shot that felled that first bank robber in L.A. a couple of
months ago. The sniper nailed him in the head because he had virtually
stopped moving. If he were running or even trotting, all the sniper could
hope for would be a lucky shot.

I hear ya, but the odds with the MT system, unfortunately, are much better
than 1-in-100.

As for the game being heroic, what about when the *PCs* are the ones
wearing the battledress? They\'re subject to the same rules. This whole
scenario that I brought up was from a real gameplaying experience. One of
my players back in the MT days worked very hard to save up enough credits
to buy a suit of light battledress. Once he acquired it, he soon became
frustrated with the fact that he was still getting hit and seriously
wounded with great frequency.

The game can be heroic and realistic at the same time, but what\'s the point
of heroism if it wasn\'t earned? If you\'re facing a guy in battledress, you
better have some form of heavy weapon or man-portable high-energy weapon at
hand or the best form of heroism should be to run like hell! <g>

While I do not think I am as annoyed as the above paragraph implies, I am
starting to get a bit tired of the evangelical tone of Kenneth\'s posts.
There are a few on the MT side as aggressive as well, so I am not trying to
single Kenneth out, but can we let this debate die?  Everyone knows the
sides, and now Marc has to decide what he will do about it.

Let me put one more plug for what I really really really want, far more
than a ne task system - player/ref background color.  It looks like Marc is
going to do that, but I want him to know that this gets unalloyed approval
from me.

1.  Definitions like the one Marc posted for EDU, expanded for all six
stats.  I liked it when he did it, and I think it is a great thing to have
as a ref or a player.  This tells someone just what their stat actually
means.  Note: in examples in the following, use whatever numbers work out
for your task system.

e.g. EDU A is a chap with a master\'s degree, or other work representing
several years of dedicated adult study.

2.  A similar list for skills.  Once again, it helps playing if you know
your Pilot-3 should act like a seasoned flyer, but not a Blue Angel.

e.g. Skill 3 is a professional level.  Most doctors, lawyers, brokers, and
so on, who have passed beyond an entry level are going to be this good.
They will be very impressed by 4s, and will consider a 2 as an entry level
slot, or a trainee, but someone who can perform the job in normal times.

If it is not obvious, a third list for task difficulties, IN WORDS.

e.g. An average task is one that a professional faces regularly, and they
rarely fail at it.  (This implies things about the rest of the system, but
words can be vague enough that minor fiddling is not needed.  For example,
rarely fail could be 80%, or 90% with a careful task, or 70% with two
attempts.  All up to the system designer how he or she wants to play it.)

J, it looks good to me.  The GM can take this description and put it into
the format required by a specific task system very easily. It makes tasks
much easier to use across systems and with house rules.

Douglas, I think that you are right in this comment.  I get so tied 
up in what I believe that I come across too strong.  If I were saying 
these words to you in person, you would see that there is no malice 
in them.  It\'s just an honest passion for something.

I do recognize that I have become tiresome to some people and am 
being percieved as a jerk.  Not all list members feel this way, and 
I\'ve gotten some private support for the comments I make.

But, for those that are offended by my tone, I apologize, and I 
promise to make more of an effort to come across more polite when I 
make my posts.

We should agree to disagree on some topics--not let the conversation 
devolve into a personal attack.  Although this discussion is not 
there yet, I fear that it is headed that way.

I guess it is a good thing that I cannot be on the list for a while.

These two statements are more correct than you probably know.

Again, I apologize to anyone who has perceived me as being a jerk.

William, 

It is people like you who degrade debates into personal flame 
wars.  There is no call to make personal attacks against me.

You are more than entitiled to disagree with what I say, but you need 
not try to get under my collar with this type of verbage.

I haven\'t been attacking anybody personnally.  There is no call to

Well, "mine" is GURPS (I play GURPS Traveller).  However, I, in fact,
basically agree with the posts advocating T4.1 and MT as both better.

Well, this is true.  First let me point out that this still contridicts
those who say that any system that lets stats and skill have equal
weight
is "broken".  Also, I will point out that there are also such systems
where the stat is based on a bell curve (like Hero and GURPS) where they
work because the "effective" range of stats (ie the range among a
typical
group of players) is comperable.  For traveller you need to compare
the effective range, rather than the 2-15 range so often quoted.
If you just teak the character generation so that you stats are
harder to get than skills, then thing will work out.

Well, yes.  I\'ve seen posts like this for GURPS to.  And, in fact, you
see
posts on both sides and it becomes clear that each side is arguing their
own gaming preference and not some objectively demonstatable postion.

Consensus will *never* be reached, so what\'s the point of keeping track?

This whole "faction" bit is reminding me too much of MegaTraveller. Is
this some kind of task system civil war? Coming soon... "T4.1: The
Shattered TML."

In any event, the whole vote tallying is pretty moot. Marc was looking
for opinions and input, reasons for the dissatisfaction of T4.0. He
wasn\'t looking to decide what Task System T4.1 will have based on our
vote!

Newsflash: MT task system will *not* replace T4. Neither will KBv2.0,
though it *might* influence it -- Marc seemed to indicate that he might
nudge skill levels into the 1-15 range somehow, to give skills more
weight. I also suspect he\'ll change SS & SF, too. (The Swami speaks! ho
ho ho... heyo!)


When news of the final decision on T4.1 reaches us, some people will be
happy, some will be disappointed, but I for one will be relieved. People
who don\'t like it will "roll their own" and life will go on.

Lets stop this Task Warz stuff. Discussion is welcome. But silly vote
tallying and flamefests aren\'t constructive and are a waste of
bandwidth.

Glenn Hoppe,
Task System Agnostic :)


PS. I also think these emotional religious crusades, without logical
reasoning, against non-2d6 systems, and the insistance that skill levels
should stop at 6 like the good ol\' days are silly. Lets move on you
crazy Luddites! ;-P

Whew! I\'m glad I got all that off my chest.

OTOH, it gets hard to make a rational character design if you
keep getting assigned randomly distributed skills.  In any
case, the fact still remain that his applies equally to
stats and skill and that stats have an additional bell
curve distribution from the roll.

Um no.  I\'m talking about the base going into the experience
section of character creation.  This is fixed at 0 for skills.
You get a distribution of increases from that, but that is
true for both skills and stats.

I would say that it is better to change the system where you use
it once (character creation) rather than where you use it every
time you roll (task resolution).

1) TNE had some of the best MT supplements ever (Survival Margin and the
Regency Sourcebook), if you get what I mean. Erasing TNE wouldn\'t work - I
also liked FFS (but gimme Thruster Plates!).

2) The stuff from Core has stuck v. close to \'canon\'. CSC/EA seem to suffer
from the same error about the RoM\'s TL - easily remedied. I bought EA and
CSC, but any references to RoM TL>13 I assume is M1100. Anyway, when you
normally play at TL15 it isn\'t a problem.

I agree. That\'s why I suggested keeping T4.1 and putting KBv2 in the
sidebar... I just want a more skills based system available. How I treat it
is dependent on my game and players.

MT was one of the best games I have ever played, but turning back the clock
is not going to solve the problem. If T4 is trying to attract newbies, it
needs a degree of consistency to be held. Change to MT, and even with the
task names the same you have a fundamentally different system. T4.1 isn\'t
*that* different...

We need compromise, we need to minimise the changes to T4 (for Marc\'s sake,
if not our own), and we need an alternative system that isn\'t skill-lite.
Traveller is the background, and the task system is the physical framework
over which the background is slipped. If we change it dramatically (T4,
T4.1 (PE), T4.2...) we risk losing new players, and with them any future
development of the game if IG goes under.

Unless DGP try and buy it again... <g>

Now, I thought that this was what was already being done, but if it
isn\'t then it should be!!

I mean, while MT\'s task system used 2D, etc, etc, did the actual
task descriptions ever actually say much about numbers? Well, I don\'t
really care what they did, I think that in the future, they shouldn\'t
talk about numbers at all.

And, on an off topic, while I can see that Kenneth\'s posting style
bothers a number of people on the list, it doesn\'t bother me that much,
so I can only assume it\'s somehow possible to read his posts without getting
worked up. Personally, I find them more sleep-inducing than annoying.
I realize that Kenneth is pretty, uh, vigorous in his, ah, "pushing"
of his task system, but I figure that Kenneth is less annoying than
television, lots of people watch television, therefore Kenneth should
be tolerable by lots of people.

I don\'t love the man or anything, but I think people should be fair.

There is a small effect due to the heat capacity of the diluent nitrogen - 
the presence of nitrogen means that auto-ignition temperatures are higher and 
flame speeds lower than they would be in a low pressure pure oxygen 
atmosphere.

 You can use fractional range bands - 5000/16000/50000/160000 for some

I appreciate the work you are doing on the task system. While I find the
current system to be far from perfect, and would like T4.1 to have a
system more like MT (or even KB 1.1, if MT is not possible), I love the
character generation system. 

Currently, GMs can (if they desire) use everything in T4 except the task
system.  Char Gen is close enough to CT & MT (not identical, but close
enough) that scenarios can easily be adapted back and forth.  One GM can
adapt _The Traveller Adventure_ to T4, while another can play T4 using the
CT or MT task system.  The whole point of T4 was compatiblity. 

Kenneth Bearden mentioned some type of rumor about skills going from 1-15.
*Please* do not do this.  Such a move would remove all compatibility in
both directions.  I would cease to buy T4.1 products because it would be
too much trouble to adapt them to the MT task system (which is what I
prefer and use in my own games).  Similarly, other people could no longer
easily adapt CT & MT characters and adventures to T4.1. 

I have strong feelings about the task system, but I have much stronger 
feelings about the issue of compatibility.  I for one will accept *any*
of the task systems suggested over a radical change in character generation.

Sincerely-

Does anyone have plans to put this into either Galactic or Hexmap?  Or just

If the target is moving directly towards you, it becomes that much easier..
a target moving across your field of fire is *very* difficult.  Of course,
if I even think that the BD equipped trooper doesn\'t know where I am, I\'m
not going to shoot.

A big part of sniping is knowing when to shoot, along with knowing how to
shoot.

Police snipers will always wait for the perfect shot.. in the LAPD
fire-fight, the numbers of civilians in the area precluded the quick
application of effective return-fire.  (That and the need to borrow weapons
from a local gun dealer!)  The person in my scenario doesn\'t have that
luxury, she needs to shoot.. NOW.

So the characters survive a little longer..  I really don\'t like games
where PC death is caused by anything short of gross stupidity.  I never let
random event kill off well crafted PCs.

He\'s learned the Tanker\'s Lesson:  You are not immortal just because you
are surronded by 60 tons of armor.  That player had to learn (the hard way)
to use sound tactics in conjunction with the improved abilities conferred
by his armor.

    BINGO!  I\'ve been listening to the Task System debate and, with growing
desperation, wishing we could... "Now Return To Our Regularly Scheduled
Programming" STS. ;) But as I\'ve listened in I\'ve been swung back and forth as
each person in turn has made their points, and quite ably too I might add.
But, I still have problems with the T4 System, and that\'s before anyone brings
up the subject of that $&%*#@! HALF DIE.
    The real problem with the Task System in T4, and what a great many are
objecting to, is the handful of glaring errors/problems.  I\'ll yank out the
most basic, Medical 3, as an excellent example.  I don\'t care if Joe Munchkin
the MedTech has FFFFF7 & Medical 1, he\'s NOT going to be a better DOCTOR then
Joe Average 777777 & Medical 3.  Why?  Because being a Doctor is a LEARNED
SKILL, it has very little to do with Stats.  Sure, being highly educated and
intelligent helps, but those only SUPPORT the SKILL of being a Doctor.
    Let me put this another way...
    You, PERSONALLY, have just taken three large calibur bullets to the
chest... in REAL LIFE.  No armor, no warning, YOU are on your back, staring at
the sky, and your body is racing to see which kills you first; the shock, the
internal organ/tissue damage or blood loss.  Now the Rescue Team manages to get
you into the hospital in time for an opperation to remove the bullets and patch
you up so you don\'t bleed to death internally or elsewhere.  Question!
    Do you want the MedTech to perform the Surgery?  Or the Thorasic Surgeon
with ten years experience, five in an Army MASH unit, and three before that in
Emergency Medicine?  In RL if you pick the MedTech... PLEASE make me the
beneficiary of your Estate! ;) In RL the fact the MedTech is brillant and is
working on his third Phd is not important, in RL you want the Doctor.  After
all in RL it\'s YOUR LIFE that\'s at stake.
    Now while T4 is a game and I can handle quite a number of flaws to increase
playability and the like...  What T4\'s Task System does is create a paradigm of
How the world works, it\'s a loose one, but it\'s a paradigm none the less.  And
like any paradigm when you run into something the paradigm can\'t handle that
doesn\'t mean the problem is wrong, it means the paradigm is flawed. ;) And I\'ve
just demonstrated that the T4 paradigm of handling skills is badly flawed.
    Some how we have to decouple what a skill does or allows you to do, from
any specific skill level it\'s self.  Because otherwise High Stats can really
screw things up and you get a MedTech that\'s a better Doctor because they
rolled Medical once on their career path and have Stats of A\'s; then a Doctor
who\'s career path IS Medical and who\'s Stats are 7\'s.  Perhaps we can just say
that to be a Doctor you have to be Licensed and you automatically are if you
have...
    Edu 8+ & Medical 3+
    Off the top of my head no less, and say to be Licensed to perform major
surgery you need...
    Dex 8+ as well, or maybe Int 8+ ::shrug:: I don\'t know, but this would
solve a lot of my problems with the T4 Task System and provide a LOT of
roleplaying potential to boot.
    What ever is done though... GET RID OF THAT &$%*@#$! HALF DIE!!!!!

	Which equation? Distance=1/2 * a * t^2; time lag is 2R/c, which works out
to 0.5 * a * (2R/c)^2 = 0.5 * a * 4 * (R/c)^2 = 2 a (R/c)^2, right?

	I was using the upper limit of the band, just for rough analysis purposes
for now. More refined calculations come as work allows me time. That\'ll
include constant time delay for computer calculations (based on computer
factor like you suggested would be an excellent idea!), errors in the
sensor fix and velocity calculations, accounting for the fact that the
evasive maneuvers won\'t be uniformly distributed in the perpendicular
plane, etc.

move to the beta list to avoid being swamped by the rising heat emanating

	No, I was using the 500/5,000/50,000/500,000 progression we used in FF&S2
... if that\'s not the correct set of bands, we need to go back and redo all
the sensors and communicators...

	For those not interested in surfing the web to find the derivation of
these numbers, or the numbers themselves, here\'s the summary:

	Assuming you have a perfect lock on the target (perfect knowledge of
position and velocity), allowing for lightspeed lag, and not knowing which
way the target will dodge, your chances of hitting a 100Disp Ton sphere
(radius: 6.9 meters) that can evade at 1G are around:

      50,000km    86%
      500,000km    1%

	That\'s a pretty big jump! However, 30,000km range bands work just fine.
Here\'s the percentages, along with generic difficulty labels I\'d expect

      30,000km    94%  (Easy)
      60,000km    80%
      90,000km    63%  (Routine)
     120,000km    47%  
     150,000km    34%  
     180,000km    24%  (Difficult)
     210,000km    17%  
     240,000km    12%  (Formidable)
     300,000km     7%
     500,000km     1%  (Impossible)

	Note that I slapped my analysis together rather quickly and haven\'t had a
chance yet to refine it. There may be minor errors in the percentages
above, for a purely random shot, but they should be close. Next plan: add
in sensor errors (NOBODY can get perfect sensor data), computer processing
time, etc.

	Oh? If he hasn\'t had the training not to do something, how will he know

of training in the first place.

	If he\'s incompetent then he won\'t have skill-4, and I wouldn\'t want him
treating me either. Skill levels don\'t represent how much training you\'ve
*received*, they reflect how much ability you\'ve *gained* from the
training. Otherwise I could sit a chimpanzee down in front of a VCR for
four years, and give him his medical degree.

>Well, the problem is that you have skill-0 in heart surgery.  You

	No, I don\'t. I don\'t have any skill in heart surgery, and every version of
Traveller so far has made a clear distinction between "Skill-0" and "No Skill"

	But this theoretical feeble-minded palsied person would never be able to
LEARN heart surgery, and hence wouldn\'t have the skill level-4. And that\'s
what I\'ve been saying over and over again: I\'d rather have Dex-7 Med-4 do
the surgery than Dex-15 Med-1. The Med-1 won\'t even know where to start, or
much about the anatomy of the heart, or anything.

	And what you seem to be doing is redefining skills. To me, a skill is "the
ability to use one\'s knowledge effectively and readily in execution or
performance" (Websters). Not how much training somebody has ignored.

	How can it be nitpicky to say that a first-year med student with little or

evangelism.  I\'ve tried not saying anything, but it\'s getting to the point
where it\'s ruining my enjoyment of the TML.

Here\'s my vote, and experiences with task systems to date:

4.1 doesn\'t sound all that hot, as I loathe .5d and am not fond of
multiples of dice-rolling in Traveller.  (I have been a WW Storyteller for
as long as there has been a WW and find many dice fine there, but as I have
also been Travelling for most of its life, I have come to associate this
game with 2d6, for better or for worse.)

KB2.whatever is just as bad or worse, in that it has even MORE dice,
annoying skill multipliers and someone doing their level best to ram it
down my throat every time I log on.

Megatraveller (as descended from CT) wasn\'t perfect either, but dammit, it
FELT right.  It had an elegance that the other systems lack completely,
sans exception.  (Glenn Grant plays with me, and I love him dearly, but 2d6
to get a range of 11-66 is just as awful to me in Traveller terms.)

In designing a system, elegance is of extreme importance to me; as much so
as statistical gobbledigook.

As a player in Roderick Elliott\'s game I have reluctantly gone with his use
of KB2.whatever, but would drop it in a heartbeat for MT or some tweak
thereof that kept the original\'s simplicity.  I\'ve seen a couple of
suggestions posted here, some intriguing.

(As an aside, I am well aware that I am saying that dividing a stat is
acceptable (a la MT) while multiplying a skill isn\'t.  Damned right.  I
have a highly developed sense of esthetics, and the latter simply doesn\'t
cut it for me.)


This is not meant as a flame to anyone, but rather as a personal expression
of dissatisfaction with the present regime.

As to the individual who mentioned that he was thinking about setting up a
bozo filter (generic term) for Kenneth\'s posts, I heartily agree.  Were I
not receiving this list in digest form, I would have already done so.

Sorry Darroch, your favourite system doesn\'t agreee with me.  I\'ll still be
there Friday though, as anyone who thinks that the system makes the game
doesn\'t know much about roleplaying.  <- Inflammatory personal opinion.  I
don\'t recall being under any obligation to be nice or PC tonight.

This has nothing to do with skill and everything to do with weapon &
ammunition design (unless you forgot to mention that your aim point
was known to you as the target\'s "weak spot").

Only if the game system *has* weak points in such armour (which T4
does not... well, not as written, anyway).  To push the above example
even further, a skilled target shooter with a body pistol should be
able to do the same.  In other words, such a task should be limited by
the physics of the situation, not the skill of those involved.

If the target *did* have a weak spot, and its armory value was still
higher than the body pistol could penetrate, it would still be an
impossible feat.

But if the task truly is impossible (eg: driving a screwdriver through
the side of an APC), the game system should reflect this.  I actually
snapped the T4 rulebook shut and didn\'t look at it again for nearly a
week when I read the following phrase:

"Because the dice code for ranged combat tasks is dependent upon
distance rather than weapon type, it is theoretically possible for a
character to hit a target at 1500 meters with a pistol, though very
unlikely."

This makes absolutely no sense.  No matter how skilled you are, an
M-16 will not penetrate the hide of an M1 Abrams (one of numerous
"perfect defenses" vs small arms).  Such is life (but not so according
to MT).  BD is supposed to be the pinnacle of personal portable
defense.  Since the MT task system doesn\'t particularly care whether
you are using a gauss rifle or a body pistol to perform the above
task, both have the same chance of succeeding.  Now the referee has to
decide where to draw the line.

That is fine.  To be a responsible game company, however, all proposed
task systems should generate roughly equal results (regarding
percentages at certain tasks for success, failure, SS, and SF).
Otherwise, tasks using one task system could become easier (or harder)
than others.  Things then become complicated when you have to include
DMs for a particular task system because it generates results that are
radically different that whatever appears in T4.1.

The problem is: MT\'s system doesn\'t produce results anywhere close to
the current T4.1 system.

I\'ll get to this as soon as I can.  In the meantime, you\'ll just have
to trust me.  The problem is, that these things are _so_ obvious, and
I am certain that some people have their minds made up already, so I
am not sure it would help them.  As for you, as I said, I\'ll get to it.
In the meantime, here\'s some perspective.  I have been running a campaign
in the Rim since the Solomani Rim was published.  Anyone who has _really_
researched the region knows what J.P. and I have posted to this list.

I am interested in any more discussion that we can have here.  I am in
the middle of 15 semester credit-hours worth of midterms.  Since the
chatter has kind of died down, I\'ll respond to much of what has been
said since my original post.

Actually, the Darrians were contacted by Terrans from the Rule of Man.  It

Like I told JL above, just trust me for now.  I would like to hear any
comments _before_ I reveal my exact sources, but they are firm and _clearly_
in context.  Only if you _don\'t_ want to consider a POV that has been
substantiated in print through most of Traveller\'s (the game) history, will
you want to argue with our premise.

I have always figured that there were a lot of people out there who _had_

that period in my own campaign.

You raise an interesting point inadvertantly.  The _only_ sources of the
Vilani bureaux actually running things (directly) in the First Imperium
are in the MT Vilani & Vargr references.  CT sources hint at influence
within the VI (much as megacorps influence(d) the TI).

I have never denied this somewhat sensible view of the nature of things

The problem is that Book 8 and 101 Robots _PRECEDE_ the MT references.

I stated earlier that the table in ImpEncyc is the only supported reference
to a RoM TL of 12.  Actually, I\'m not surprised given MT\'s reputation.
Nothing has been published which countermands any other sources, except the
IE entry, and that is only one contradiction versus a list of things to
support a high TL RoM.  Personally, one _exact_ reference that disagrees with
numerous others is not canon.  Read my previous posts for more details,
rather than my repeating them here.

I have thoroughly researched the Solomani Rim material, so I am very much
aware of what the canon says.  I\'m not counting T4 as a source because I
am doing proper research.  I am glad to see that T4 is at least in line
with what has been established as precedence.

Right on target there Garry.  I\'ve had HCI classes, and have not yet taken
my AI requirement.  But, I know enough about computer systems to know that
you are right in your assessment. (I can also agree with most of the reasons
why Virus really sucked for a TNE plot device, but that is another story. :)

>May not be errata, just an imprecise selection of terminology.

Actually, Harold poorly worded his comment there.  Unless his position has
changed from a year ago, he maintained that there must be errata somewhere
that changed the AI reference to \'self-mobile\' or somesuch.  Personally, I
doubt that anyone would have bothered with errata for a Chronology entry.
The MT sources are fraught with contradiction, so we are being careful when
weighing their material for research.  That does not mean we have ignored
them though.  We are examining everything that we find of relevance.

Thank you and J.P. thanks you. :)  Actually, I have maintained for
quite awhile now that much of the debate over RoM tech level can be
explained by Third Imperial relativism in historical view, rather
than the Terran relativism which has not yet received much press.
Something we are actively pursuing. It is pretty easy to see how the
TI would want to claim legitimacy by tracing back to the RoM, but
not want to face the facts about what they (RoM) were capable of.

I have to disagree.  Not with the logical premise you point out in
chronology, but with the fact that these problems only arise when people
start "anchoring" from the rather backward (TL7/8) perspective.  Only
when people started complaining because computers were "so big" in High
Guard, did we get this kind of thinking.

I used to say, "Take an IBM mainframe (3084) and assume that one of those
is half the duplex of a Traveller (HG) Model/1 (ignoring issues like size
of programs which are too generic to truly fit to a properly undetailed
rules set).  Now build up a cluster of those duplexed 3084s to, say give
us a Model/n (or whatever you like greater than 1).  A High Guard computer
hit produces a Computer-1 damage result.  What cluster of any amount of
IBM mainframes is going to take a damage hit, and keep on ticking."

This is the kind of thinking that has not generally been done in looking
at the sizes of computers.  Unfortunately, I still see thinking like that
today.

Well, that is quite a dodge, but I don\'t think it would hold up with any
reading the rules books for this game. :)

Well, that\'s everything I wanted to respond to.

I would like to see reasonably direct answers to the above questions,
which Bruce has artfully dodged.  (Maybe I\'m getting through to him
too. :)

I do promise to get the sources out to you all eventually.  I am just
_extremely_ busy now, and want to keep any discussion going if there is
still more to say that is relevant (of course :).  We should reward this
kind of behaviour.  Many of us have long been frustrated to find that
something had the wheels of canon roll right over what we had always known
to be fact.

Now, don\'t get me wrong I agree with the points you made in your post,
but...

I read a magazine article several years ago about a fellow that really
*could* hit a man sized target at 1 mile (~1600m) 3 out of 4 shots.  He
used a hand built long barreled 44 revolver, firing from the side of hill
across a valley at a target on the other side.  If I remember correctly, he
sat down to fire, balancing the gun\'s barrel and sighting between his feet.

I don\'t remember the article too well, it *was* over 20 years ago, and it
only stuck with me at all because of the sheer improbability of such long
range shots with a pistol.  It seemed impossible to me at the time, but
well I *did* read it.  And no, it wasn\'t in The Star.  ;->

This is something that definitely needs to be done.  As the T4.1 rulebook
takes shape, now is the time to fix some of the little details as well. 
Make T4.1 a truly task-based game, in all respects, and get rid of many of
the tables with row upon row of combat modifiers.

Below is quoted a section of text from Joe D. Fugate, in MT Journal #4 (pg
98).  Although most have probably already read it, I feel that his words
are much better at explaining my beliefs than my own:

"A prime motivation behind the task system was to eliminate rolls like the
following:

Need 8+ to hit the grav tank.
DMs:
if excellent visibility, +1
if poor visibility, -1
if night, -4
if raining, -2
if snowing, -3
if foggy, -4
if using electronic sights, +2
if using maser sights, +3
if target moving, -2
if attacker moving, -2
if light vegetation, -1
if dense vegetation, -2

Yukl People have tried to do this with the task system like this:

To hit the grav tank:
Routine, gunnery (Confrontation)
Referee:	Also apply the following DMs to this task:
if normal visibility, -1
if poor visibility, -2
if night, -5
if foggy, -1
if using electronic sights, +1
if using maser sights, +2
if target moving, -2
if attacker moving, -2
if light vegetation, -1
if dense vegetation, -2

No, no, no! The problem is either: you are doing too much with one task, or
you need to alter difficulty levels in place of throwing in a bunch of DMs.
You should limit you rself to two DM items max per offender or defender.
For example, I would rewrite the above task as follows:

To hit the grav tank:
(varies), off-gunnery, sensor DM; def-terrain, def DM
(confrontation)
if defender stationary: Difficult,+4
if attacker or defender moving: Difficult,+2
if both moving: Diflicult,+O
Referee:	Increase this task by one difficulty level if ...itisnight
it is bad weather (e.g., raining, snowing, or foggy) These increases are
cumulative.

See how much simpler this is? The difficulty increase for night and/or bad
weather is intuitive enough I could almost guess how to do it. And with the
technique of "fine-tuning" difficulty levels, the moving/not moving problem
is nearly intuitive too. However, a variable difficulty task is more
complicated than a task with only one difficulty, so use the variable
difficulty task sparingly. If possible, refer the gamer to a simple chart
with the difficulty changes noted on the chart (like the MegaTraveller
direct fire difficulty tables on page 72 of the Players\' Manual). Ideally,
keep the changes consistent from column to column so the chart is easy to
commit to memory."

A good point.  Whatever system that appears in T4.1 must bear a
resemblance to what appeared in T4.  The MT task system generates
results that an *NOT* compatible with the T4 task system.  How do you
write a module if one group of gamers (using a MT system) generates SS

I agree that this is a personal decision, but nearly all RPGs today
(that don\'t simply use d%) roll more than 2 dice at some point.  I
don\'t see multiple dice deterring newbie Traveller players from
purchasing a copy of T4.x.

This may be true, but there can only be _one_ (possibly two) task
systems printed in the new T4.1 master rulebook.  To add more would
simply be confusing, just like there is only one included character
generation system and one included space combat system.

I believe what Ken meant was that stat *points* and skill *points* are
weighed equally.  KBv2.0 multiplies skills by three (3).  MT divides
stats by five (5).  *Both* systems assume that skills dominate stats.
The multipliers might be different, but that is only due to the
fundamental differences between the two systems.  If Ken\'s system is
broken because of this, so is MT.

I agree with this statement, even though I am currently listed with
those voting for KBv2.0.  Perhaps Ken\'s system can be tweaked to allow
SS to appear more frequently.

Rolling more or less dice shouldn\'t alter your perceptions of
Traveller.  If they are, you might be spending too much time within
the mechanics of the game and not enough time playing in the Traveller
universe :)

Please don\'t view me as Ken\'s pet lap dog.  I am speaking for his
proposed system, not for him.  His system is not without its flaws,
but it *is* "backwards-compatible" with the T4 system (with only a
minor amount of tweaking).

MT is not.  For Marc to adopt the MT system, he would also have to
rewrite the personal combat, space combat, and psionics systems as
well.  I am not interested in buying MT2.

    'body' => 'First, I\'d like to say that I haven\'t purchased a copy of T4 yet, and that
I probably won\'t be able to in the near future, but I\'d like to offer some
comments to the debate:

  1.  What I really liked about the MT skill system was the following:
      a.  A simple task was highly likely to succeed.
      b.  Given average attributes (7-11) and a level two skill, routine
          tasks became simple.  Okay, so I did prefer rounding, and
          that skews my perception slightly, but so be it.
      c.  The most that exceptionally high or low attributes could do was 
          confer one skill level bonus or penalty to a trained individual.
          Stats were nice to have, but not overly important.

  2.  Point 1c seemed to go allong with the atmosphere of the game and the 
      character sheets (which were supposedly TAS informational forms).
      Along with some of the interpersonal tasks (which were slightly 
      annoying to use, but a nice try) where one could reasonably expect that
      testing could be carried out using the games mechanics, along with the
      occasional horrible data entry/testing errors.

  3.  If T4 can convey the same sense that MT did about the relationship
      between attributes and skills (average attributes and 2 or 3 skill
      points constitues professional ability, so that you don\'t worry about
      carrying out day to day tasks), then it doesn\'t matter to me how
      the task system is implemented.  What really matters to me as a ref
      is how quickly I can get used to the task system, mainly so that I
      know what stats to throw on the NPCs for the desired level of difficulty
      in my campaign.

      If for some reason, T4 decides that stat+skill>=10 is professional,
      then that\'s fine.  If difficulty reduces by one level for each
      additional 10 points of the total, again that\'s fine.  Its not like
      I really bothered to write numbers down ahead of time anyway.

      Of course, more importantly, the faster I can develop an idea of how
      the mechanics of the task system behave, the sooner I can explain
      to the players what\'s really important, and the more they can get
      out of the introductory session (the one where people largely mess
      mess around, start fights, etc., just to see how the physics of this
      new world behave).

  4.  Just one important point:  Unless the task system is constructed 
      just right, there is no way that exact compatibility with CT or MT
      is possible (which would mean, of course, having exactly the same
      task system as CT or MT, which by the way, don\'t either).
      Just please don\'t try to tell the CS/EE/Math/Gearhead readers of your
      material by stating that the new task system does something that it
      doesn\'t do, since that only leads to unsound systems and confusion.

   This would not have been foolish at all, at least for Terran
industrialists.  Upgrading everything in the Vilani Imperium would cost
untold amounts of MCr, and the only source for the upgrades (at least
initially) would be worlds that were part of the Terran Confederation. 
This would make the Vilani economically dependent on the Terrans for
many years to come.

   The first capital of the Rule of Man was Dingir in the Solomani Rim,
though many bureaucratic functions were still handled on Vland.  Hiroshi
II and his successors later moved the capital to the more centrally
located world of Hub/Ershur.  The capital remained there for many years,
but by -1776 the location of the capital was largely dependent upon
where the various claimants to the throne where headquartered.

   While it is true that a flood of settlers entered Diaspora sector,
and other regions of the former Vilani Imperium, we need to define "high
TL production capacity".  True TL 12 industrial worlds (if that\'s what
you are talking about) would have taken decades to upgrade to that TL 12
standard.  TL 13 would have pretty much been out of their reach, perhaps
for hundreds of years.

   I think you misunderstand what I\'m implying--there wasn\'t time for TL
14 equipment to appear.  

   I would argue that even TL 13 was basically a novelty--on a par with
TL 16 in the Third Imperium.  While it is likely that there were few
worlds in the RoM had the capability to produce some TL 13 items, it in
*no way* should be implied that such worlds could produce even
experimental TL 14 equipment, in much the same way that the TL 16 worlds
in the Third Imperium were incapable of producing TL 17 experimental
equipment.  For example, I\'ll believe somebody saying that they found a
small cache of holographic storage crystals (TL 13 technology) dating
from the Rule of Man buried in some ruins on Kaggushus (a world near
Ershur), but if they also find an experimental meson communicator (TL 14
technology), I\'d be very inclined to believe it was a fake.

>I don\'t, personally, have a big problem with throwing relic TL-14

   I have a *tremendous* problem with relic TL 14 equipment, since it
basically invalidates a fundamental fact of RoM history.  Really, saying
that there were a few TL 13 worlds is *non-canon* in and of itself,
since it assumes that, as in the Third Imperium, there were worlds that
were the exception to the rule on the high side of technology.  There
are absolutely no valid references that I\'ve been made aware of (as in
sourcebook and page number) from the GDW era that say there was a TL 13
anything in the RoM, let alone TL 14.

Harold

Oh yeah (sarcasm) and all Traveller players roleplay their characters
in combat this way :)

Was that a .44 Magnum revolver, or a .44 Winchester single-shot,
target-shooting pistol?  If the task can\'t be replicated by a Glock
23, Beretta 92F, SIG-Sauer 226, Walther PPK, or any of hundreds of
other pistols, the rules shouldn\'t allow it *except as a special case
for that particular weapon*.

I like 3G3\'s or EA\'s optional rule defining a weapon\'s maximum range
at either one or two range bands beyond its listed Range for aimed
shots.  I can read my T4 rulebook again!  :)

Global terraforming is not so much a technological thing as it is an
economic. We\'re working our asses off to create a runaway greenhouse world
right now which is on the scale of terraforming albeit in the wong
direction. If terraforming means huge space based mirrors etc I\'d say Tl
8-9 is enough and then all you need is cash - LOTS OF IT!

smells like Solomani propaganda and is not consistent with MY view of
Solomani (Military inclined, clever but aggressive and oppressive - kind of
like the US during the 50:s)

Not what I said at all.  He has training and he is smart enough

That\'s why you don\'t allow some rolls unless you have at

Exactly, and that is one reason why some people find the whole idea
that someone with low stat and skill-4 should beat out a guy with
a higher stat to be wrong.

I see.  And where does this distinction come from?  And if so, why
do you get a skill every year, regardless of how bright you are?

What you are doint is trying to include the effects of stat
into skill, which supports the idea that talent _does_ make
a difference.

There is no distinction.  GM\'s are allowed to _sometimes_ allow
rolls against skill-0 for thing that can be accomplished by
an untrained person.  In this case, heart surgery, wouldn\'t
be that case and so you wouldn\'t be allowed to roll.  No
problem.

I\'m not.  You are.  The difference between Stat 7 and Stat 4 isn\'t
what you can do.  It\'s how well you can do it.  The current rules
allow someone with Medical-1, regardless of whether his stat is 8
or 11, to try heart surgery.  If you have a problem with that then
you need rule that you need a minimum skill level to try it at
all.  If you don\'t, then I see no reason why the more talented
person shouldn\'t have a better chance.

It was gratuitous because you could have just refered to them
rather than listing every one out.

I\'m sorry.  In Classic Traveller rolling against skill-0 is
explicitly mentioned as only being allowed at the GM\'s discression.
In any case.  I agree that certain task would require a minimum
of training.  I also find it obvious that people with equal
traiing are going to exhibit a huge range in how effective
that training is.

Shouting your points doesn\'t make them any more true.  If you

"training".

This is obvious.  Unfortunately this attitude leads to this sort
of automatic negation of new ideas for the game.  Most people would
say that the idea that other games have tried stat+skill and found
it to work means that it can work for Traveller too.

45 degrees shot angle (mortar style).

In sweden there was a man shot to death 4 kilometers from a shooting range.
The bullet entered through the open left cardoor window and hit him in the
template. The man died instantly but it took some time to figure where the
bullet came from.

   Terraforming can be done on a regional level at TL 1, given the
proper circumstances.  As for global terraforming, easy jobs could be
done as early as TL 11 or 12.  Probably the only reason no one got
around to terraforming Mars until the 1000s was because it was much
easier just to hop in a starship and go to a natural occuring habitable
world.  One wonders why they even started terraforming Mars at all,
except that the sci-fi community kept hounding them to do it.  :-)

   Given that humans can be cloned late in TL 8, and that we can
genetically alter plant and lesser animal species now, I would assume
that such a thing would be possible late TL 9, early TL 10.

   One much lower than you seem to be implying--given the above,
probably about TL 12.

   We like our genetic science.  The Vilani were way behind the Terrans
in that regard.

   Tech level 12, with perhaps a small handful of borderline TL 13
worlds.

   BTW, the number of your jump drives is only one measure of
technology, there are many. many others.  It just so happens that jump
technology is one of the best indicators of relative technological
advancement, which is why it is used as an example so often.

No they are not. Robots are different from todays computers not only

I divide my Traveller Robits into three(four) categories:
DumBots: Smart as a trained dog ie often requires special skills to
instruct and has a VERY limited view of the world. A cleaning bot would be
very good at separating things to trash from imporrtnat stuff though.
RoBots: Can be instructed by the layman and knows some things about the
real world. You can have them run a cab etc without supervision.
SmartBots: These are quite good at mimicking humans with gestures etc (they
have a charisma score) and grasp the real world. These bots could fool a
human if their exterior was pseudobio enough.
AI: This type doesn\'t exist in the 3d Imperium yet except for the Carlo
Rossum AI that got sentience unawares to his builders. He consists of 125
networked smartbot brains which fills a cargo container (including cabling
etc etc).

   Given the advances in genetic engineering we\'ve seen late in TL 8,
this really shouldn\'t be a problem.  I can easily see bio-engineered

   Then we have another problem, since my copy of "Imperium" comes with
fighter squadrons for both the Vilani and the Terrans.  Maybe they were
just scouts with really mean dispositions.  :-)  This is yet another
example of why Fusion Plus sounds like an interesting plot device, but
it doesn\'t work when you try to put it into the existing storyline.

   Okay kids, here\'s a challenge: using the existing FF&S II rules (or
what we know of them), design a TL 11 fighter craft capable of
operations outside the atmosphere.

ps

Scientists at the UNCLA Education Centre high energy physics lab have today
released their results reguarding a newly discovered particle. This
particle, known as the Learnon, is beleived to be responsible for the
ability of any intelligent being to learn.
Learnons are exchanged in a student teacher interaction, creating a
learning field. This field strength is increased or decreased, depending on
the number of learnons possessed by the target (or student). A higher
number of learnons allow for a more efficient exchange of knowledgons, a
particle closely associated with the learnon.

Recent studies have also shown that there are also a finite number of
learnons in the universe, and so if someone possesses a large number, that
is balanced out by others possessing fewer. 

In order to increse the educational possibilities of low performers in high
school, the administration at the UNCLA Education centre have recomended
that all high achievers should be instantly terminated by lethal injection,
and that middle of the road leaners should be randomly culled. This would
allow for a fairer concentration of learnons.

***addendum

Authorities are still at a loss today trying to explain the complete
distruction of the UNCLA Education Centre Administration Department.
Experts on the scene say that the destruction is also accompanied by
residual radiation. They hope that inspectors will be able to finalise
their investigation shortly.
Authorities are also trying to explain a hole that appears to have been
blasted in the brick wall of the High energy Physics dept in the building
across the park.

Chris, didn\'t your player ever witness individuals in BD being taken
down by non-heavy weapons during the campaign?  If it took your player
a while to save up for the armour, surely he would have encountered
units wearing them prior to plunking down his money.  Not to sound too
harsh, but the system didn\'t really fail your player, since *everyone*
wearing BD in CT or MT is subject to the same rules.

CT and MT were both flawed, IMHO, regarding how easily the most
advanced personal armour available could be penetrated.  I would have
figured that the less armoured areas of a suit of BD would have been
more vulnerable-- but not to the extent that CT and MT made them
appear to be.

If they *really* were that vulnerable, why didn\'t the Imperium build
even heavier suits of Anime-style powered armour that could lug around
the necessary armour to be truly impervious to small arms?

TNE and T4 both describe BD and ABD as being "proof against most small
arms".  With both systems it is a simple matter of comparing Armour
Values and Penetration Values.  While SS do result in delivering more
damage to the target, it all boils down to whether or not enough
damage is caused to penetrate the armour.  If your hero rolls a SS
with his black powder rifle and it still isn\'t enough to hurt the
target, it shouldn\'t be allowed to penetrate-- period.  Perhaps he
could borrow a weapon from a local gun dealer :)

    'month' => '06',
    'index' => 'bq463',
    'topic' => 'Notes Toward a New Task System',
    'body' => 'Marc and other Task System Wranglers,

Just to sum up my feelings on the Task Debate:

Suggestion 1: Use the entire applicable characteristic, not a fraction of it.

Reasons: Dividing is Math and Math is Bad. Moreover, effective
characteristics fluctuate due to fatigue, wounds, and recovery, and thus
dividing the stat requires recalculation after every change. Also, each
point of stat should have an effect on the TN, not every other point, or
every fifth point.

Suggestion 2: Balance stats & skills by increasing the effect of skills.

Reasons: This seems to be among the few things most TMLers agree upon. Some
want a stat:skill ratio similar to MT\'s (1:5); some have suggested 1:2;
some like 1:3 (KBv2.0, my D66 system). I prefer 1:3, as a \'happy medium\',
but this is purely a matter of preference and opinion.

Suggestion 2: Don\'t increase the stat:skill ratio by increasing the number
of skills awarded in CharGen (so that skills have a range of 1-15 or more).

Reasons: PCs will end up with an even broader collection of skills (and not
necessarily higher skill levels), making the PCs more generic. In CT/MT/T4
(I never played TNE), it\'s important for the various characters to have a
variety of skills. It\'s no fun if every PC has some Pilot skill, some
Astrogation, some Gunnery, some Broker, etc... they would no longer have to
rely on each other.

Besides, the current T4 CharGen system is just great, and T4.1 looks to be
even better, so I don\'t see why they should be further mutated just to make
the Task System work. 1 skill per year seems to produce a good mix of
skills and skill levels. It would become tiresome to have to roll ~3 skills
per year, just to bring skill levels up to 1-15+ range. The same effect is
much easier to achieve by simply multiplying the skill by 3.

Suggestion 3: Decouple all Task Statements from the mechanics of the Task
System.

"J." <Jonathan@hccm.co.uk> recently made this suggestion, and it\'s a very
good one. If the text of an adventure or rule book speaks only of
\'Difficult Tasks\', and not \'3D Tasks\', for instance, any of several Task
Systems can be applied to resolving the Task.

Suggestion 4: include at least one alternative task system in the book.

If it doesn\'t take up a huge amount of space, why not please both of the
major camps? I would suggest a variable-dice system such as KBv2.0 or T4.1
as the \'official\' system, and, as a sidebar or appendix, a fixed-dice
system such as MT for the die-hards who refuse to believe 2D is the True
Traveller Way.

I can see no compromise between the two approaches. A fixed number of dice
(usually two D6) requires multiple TNs - one for each Difficulty Level -
while a variable-dice system has the advantage of requiring only a single
TN. Multiple-dice systems are therefore more \'elegant\', and easier for
newbies to understand and memorize. But a fixed 2D system is attractive for
those who dislike adding together lots of dice.

I feel pulled both ways. To complicate matters, there\'s a lot to be said a
system that requires no additive dice at all, such as a D100, D20, or D66
system, abandoning the bell curve entirely. (I\'m even tinkering with an
idea for a MT-like system that uses the full characteristic + (skill*3),
different TNs for each Difficulty Level - and a fixed roll of 4D10! I\'m
calling it "Heresy 1.0".  My hope is that it will achieve the right
probabilities at all Difficulty Levels, will work without modifying DMs
already printed in the T4 books, and will be easier to remember and use
than MT - no dividing the stat, FrEx. If I can get it to work, I\'ll post it
here.)

Taking all of the above into account, I still feel that KBv2.0 is probably
the best way to go *as the official T4 Deluxe Task System.* I do not
believe that it\'s the Holy Grail of Task Systems; better systems can be
found, as well as systems that would prove more popular with TMLers, but
they will not be as back-compatible with published T4 material.

	5		+3	gritty, attributes minor
	4		+3	Also gritty, but more favorable breaks.
	3		+5	Makes attributes important, but not
overwhelming
	2		+7	Space Opera. Even the unskilled have good odds
				with high attributes. Compares with KBv2.0

Difficulty Target Numbers:
I kept MT\'s progression by 4\'s, but raised them 1 point to compensate for
the higher level of attribute bonus.

Changed Time Roll from 3d6 to 4d6:
Under T4 (MMT), level 2 skills are more common, thus I based the expected
time upon Att 6-8, level 2 in skill, and the mean roll is 14. So the DM-4
on time makes the average guy in field give the expected times. For the
really slimmed down dice rolls, use 2d10 instead (mean is 11, so average
roll will be a 7, but who\'s really counting on wacko stuff like this).

Listing Expected time instead of time increments to be multiplied:
makes the time system optional. Slip a decimal place.

Doubled time on unskilled tasks:
makes them represent the "bumbling along" approach.

Defined Research differently than MT:
Streamlined it and made it a meta-task.

Uncertain:
Kept it the same, cause the concept is the player is rolling to see iof he
knows he\'ll get SOME TRUTH. If he fails, he knows he\'ll get some lies. how
much is still uncertain, as the ref shouldn\'t be rolling in the open.

Half-levels of difficulty:
Increased granularity at the expense of more to remember. I\'ve used it, but
I prefer to not use it. It\'s in there for the nitpickers, as an option.

Combat notes: To show how little really needs to be changed in combat to
make it work with an MT-like system.

System uses 2d6, plus skill level, plus attribute/3. Max DM=+12

Referee\'s may instead call for two skills, or two attributes in a task; all
tasks should have only two sources of DieMod\'s.

(For more gritty game, use att/5 or Att/4, for more free-form, epic gaming,
use att/2)

Time Rolls (if used) are [4d6 -(skill) -(attribute/3)] *(expected time/10)

On a natural 2: If task would otherwise succeed, induce a complication (ie:
			it works, but....) or subtract 1d6 from DM\'s
		if task would have failed, it is a critical failure
		if task would have critically failed, it is a Botch.
No auto-success rule; Optionally, however, if PC rolls a 12 that fails,
allow PC
		to add 1d6-1 to roll, and a natural 17 that fails allows
adding
		another 1d6-1. No more than 4d6-2 is ever rolled.
Unskilled Tasks: Increase difficulty by 1 line. JoaT/2 may be added. (so Jack
		9-10 is equal to actual skill level 1, and 11-12 is level 2)
		Also, double the time roll (Before modifiers). Only tasks that
		use a skill take the unskilled penalty (No substituting
JoaT for
		Low Attributes!) Tasks that use two skills only take one
		incresed level of difficulty, but JoaT may only be added
ONCE on
		any task.
Exceptional Failure: Fail by 4 points. This is usually a crit fail.
Exceptional Success: Make by 4 points.
cautious/hasty: decrase/increase by 1 line for double/half time

Task Modifiers
Fateful: Any Failure is a mishap
Hazardous:  mishaps are worse.
Low Risk: Mishaps are less severe. Directly opposite of Hazardous.
Safe: No Mishap can occur, except possibly on an aggrivated crit fail (Botch)
Absolute: No time roll may ever be made; the time is fixed to the expected
time.
Combat: Actions takes one combat round, and no time roll.
Unskilled OK: Unskilled task takes no penalty.
Uncertain: The player is not informed of the result directly; see detailed
	explanation below. Used for research, Opinion based items, or tasks
	where the reliability of one\'s knowledge is uncertain.
Meta: Task does not occur in directly tracked action, but represents many
	actions over much time. See PE.
Confrontation: You get to add your mods, but somebody else gets to subtract
	theirs from the task dice.
Experimental: A variation on Uncertain, pertaining to experimental research.
	See details below. Also, all experimentals are assumed to be Meta.
Blind: The Ref sets the difficulty, but does not let the players know what the
	Diff Level is. They roll, as normal, then the ref simply tells them
	their level of success, based upon their total roll.

Mishaps: On Failures, certain types of bumbles can occur. On any failure on
a fateful task, or any crit-fail, roll 2d6. On a botch, roll 3d6. Hazardous
tasks add another 1d6 to the roll. For a botch on a safe task, the Ref
might want to have the player roll 1d6, but this is strictly optional

	Normal	Haz.	Fate.	Haz+Fate	Safe	LowRisk	LR+Fate.
Fail	-	-	2d6	3d6		-	-	1d6
CrFail	2d6	3d6	2d6	3d6		-	1d6	1d6

16-20	Destroyed	Not Field Repairable	7d6 Damage or 3 Atts to 0
21+	Rubbled		no salvage value	9d6 Damage or DEAD.

Uncertain Tasks
On an uncertain task, the player and the Ref both roll the task dice (but
only the player rolls time dice).

If both succeed, the task results in Truth Only
If one succeeds, and the other fails, Partial Truth should be given, as
well as some lies.
If Both Fail, the task results in No Truth, and may generate some lies.

Mishaps only occur based upon the PLAYER\'s roll.

Research Tasks
On a research task, the player and the Ref both roll the task dice (but
only the player rolls time dice). The player\'s roll determines whether or
not data is gained; the Ref\'s roll detemines whether it is useful or
flawed. Research tasks are automatically meta-tasks.

Player	Ref	Result
CrSucc	Succ+	Total Truth
Succ	Succ+	Some Truth, some bogus
CrSucc	Fail-	some truth, some bogus
Succ	Fail-	some truth, some bogus
Fail	any	no data
CrFail	any	no data, mishap

Exactly, and as Marc says economics is everything in Traveller.

But according to World Builders Handbook some TL 15 worlds were capable
of producing items of up to TL 18 and some TL 16 worlds were capable of
producing items of up to TL 19 !

The documentation for this claim is found in the Technology Related
Details section (pg 83-86) of world builders handbook.  WBH defines what
is usually refered to as the TL of a planet as the High Common Tech
Level.  It then produces seperate tech levels for the fields of Energy,
Computers/Robotics, Communications, Medical, Environment, Land
Transport, Water Transport, Air Transport, Space Transport, Personal
Military, Heavy Military, and Novelty.

The upper limit for these TL\'s is equal to the high common tech level
(what other less specialized publications refer to as the TL) + high
common tech level over 5 (drop fractions).  Thus the highest Tl any
planet might be capable of in some field, if you roll high is equal to:

High Common	Highest Possible
Tech Level	Specialized Tech Level

	0		0
	1		1
	2		2
	3		3
	4		4
	5		6
	6		7
	7		8
	8		9
	9		A
	A		C
	B		D
	C		E
	D		F
	E		G
	F		J (TL 18 the letter L is skipped as too easy to 			   confuse it
with the number 1 )
	G		K

For example here is the detailed Tech Level breakdown I use in for the
planet Depot/Deneb circa year 1084.  The references for items producable
at those TL\'s are from MT\'s Referees Companion (pg 28-29)

UPP A 100644-G  D   Na Ni Va    220 Im F9 II

Area			Tech level	Example Technology		

High Common Tech Level		G					
Low Common Tech Level		F
Energy Tech Level		G 	Fusion plants 80 liter minimum	Computers/Robotics
Tech Level	G	Artifical Intelligence Robots
					Common	
Communications Tech Level	H	Pseudoreality Commonplace
Medical Tech Level		H	Partial Memory Transfer (Dupe)
Environment Tech Level		J	Terraforming of Worlds up to Any 
					Size

At this Tech Level Land, Water, and Air Transportation have merged

Land Transport Tech Level	G	Experimental Matter Transport
					(Raw Materials Only)
Water Transport Tech Level	G
Air Transport Tech Level	G 
Space Transport Tech Level	K	Antimater 1 Mw/liter
Personal Military Tech Level	G	FGMP-16, Neural Gun/Shield
Heavy Military Tech Level	G	Short Range Tractors
Novelty Tech Level		K	

Please note that the items of TL 17, 18, and 19 will _not_ be mature
technology.  WB\'s says (page 95) Achievement Tech Level Greater than
High Common "This represents a technological area in which the world is
forging ahead through experiments and research. Breakthroughs are
occuring but little practical use has yet to be made of the discoveries
or inventions.  Charecters may be able to locate and make use of this
technology in an adventure if they are desperate, but this technology
likely consists of a handfull of prototypes of dubious reliability."

Thus we can explain away the TL 17 in Communications and Medical, the TL
18 in Environmental, and the Tl 19 in Space Transport and Novelty as
secret Imperial Naval projects going on at the Depot. 

The Tl 16 in High Common, Energy, Computers/Robots, LAnd/Air/Water
Transport, Personal Military, and Heavy Military do represent mature
produts.  "This represents a technological area in which the world has
local manufacturing and design."

These particular sub tech levels are not canonical but the way they were
rolled up was canonical in MT and the book used to create them (world
Builders) is still the best source of detail for worlds.

But if the sttements in the rules saying "The Rule of Man was Tl 12."
are read as "The High Common TL of the Rule of Man was 12." then
according to WB\'s they could indead have had TL 14 items.  Please note
that I am not saying that T4 does not use to much TL 14 (I think it
does) or that these items should have lasted 1700 years in quantity (not
likely) but thatthe Rule of Man _could_ have had them.

Yes they should be more careful & mindfull of past canon but TL 14 items
from planets with a High Common TL of 12 _is_ past cannon & they are
abiding by it.

No I am not aware of any either but WBH\'s MT rules can be used to
explain why "Tl 12" can (maybe should) be read as  having a "High Common
Tl of 12" which does allow for items of up to TL 14.  On the other hand
maybe it just never came up before.  Mileau 0 is 1100 years closer to
the The Rule Of Man than what we are used to. 

Maybe The Second Empire made consumer products with atomic clocks in
them designed to self destruct after 2000 years so they were all
destroyed by 1100 but worked fine in year 0  :)

Who says Dolphins _are_ sentient :)

Besides whether or not they are in the real world in not important (nad
off topic) for Traveller.  Traveller states that they were uplifted. 
Therefore in Traveller they were not sentient or they would not have
_needed_ uplifting.

The real world data is open to interpretaion but my (laypersons)
interpretation is that they are very smart animals, possibly approaching
primate levels, but are not sentient.

Actually it isn\'t. PE includes the number of dice next to each task 
desription. It\'s in brackets next to the difficulty level. This is a 
good idea, it saves players/referees haing to look up how many dice to
roll. But if this wasn\'t included then the task system could be modified 
without invalidating PE. Currently if the task system is changed the task
descriptions in PE will be confusing rather than helpful.

This is a good point. The official systems should produce roughly equal
results (there may only be one official system of course). Other peoples 
systems don\'t have to, if someone wants to run a star wars style game where 
characters do the impossible every day then they can make their task system 
reflect that, if they want SS to be really rare then they make it rare.
Any alternative systems printed in JTAS or whatever should contain a note
saying "this system will make task easier for ......." or "this task system
has more emphasis on skills." So that Referee\'s are aware of the effects of
changing the this system without having to work out the probabilities for 
themselves.

SS and SF seem to exist in most task systems in one form or another, So
i\'ll add them to my generic description (See below).

DM\'s are going to be a pain, a +1 DM in one system is different to a +1
in TNE etc. etc. Thats why in my previous post I avoided using them, I used
increasing/decreasing difficultly levels instead.

In fact I have a better idea. Change the description to:

        To put on a Vacc suit
        Average, DEX, Vacc suit
        more difficult if in a confined space
        less difficult if another character is assisting
        SF: Vacc suit is ripped and must be repaired

Each task system could define "more difficult" in a any way it sees fit.
It could mean an increase in 1 difficulty level or a modifier of +1 or +2
or -1 even.

I\'d be interested to here peoples views on this.

I would like to see Traveller 4.1 published with a MegaTraveller like
system in it even if only as an optional system.  It would only need to
take up a few pages, and these pages could have a border around them
saying Warning ! Optional Advanced Rules ! or some such. If the main
body of the book refered to tasks by difficulty level this would not be
a big incompatibility problem.

I would prefer something like 2d6 + Skill + Stat/3 (round normally)
versus 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 task difficulties with no maximum DM.  This
system could be very similar to many of the variants posted here & tried
& playtested by many.  I posted a similar system as did many other
people, probably the best I saw was Carlos Ferrers.

I support the paradigm that skills are more important than stats.  I was
impressed with the alternate task systems that said "This task if of
this difficulty for this level of skill, add or subtract 1 level of
difficulty for each level of skill above or below that level." but I
think this may be too radical a change.

	Well, actually, KB v.2.0 isn\'t my fave system.  StoryTeller is.
However, IIRC, you got all prima donnaish when I threatened to use ST, so
now we\'re stuck with KB :).  BTW, did you brush up on that combat handout

I was thinking on this instead of working today, and it occured to me 
that there\'s really no way of exlaining how the RoM could make TL14 
Vacc Siuts, and yet didn\'t have fusion plus - a TL12 invention. And 
don\'t tell me that Vacc Suits have nothing to do with fusion 
reactors, because a Vacc Suit is a very sophisticated piece of gear, 
so making a TL14 one is going to require good, mature TL13 - plus all 
your TL14 materials, chemical and electronics tech: unlikely you\'ll 
have all this and no TL12 fusion tech.

	Now this got me to thinking in and of it\'s self because we all do tend
to think in terms of TL = J-drive.

> 1) What tech does it take to Terraform a size 8 world?
	Counter question.  How long do I have to do it in and at what levels do
I start/finish at?  Another point too, the very IDEA of altering a world to
suit Humanity is a fairly arrogant and speculative one to begin with.  Given
the Vilani\'s conservative mindset... would they have even thought of it?  And
what would their reaction have been to the Terrans that casually planned for
it?

> 2) What tech does it take to genetically alter homo-sapiens into a
> self-reproducing, stable, water-breathing variant (i.e. make a minor
> human)?
	Point here, the Vilani never had the medical and genetic knowledge the
Terrans had.  Wouldn\'t this have made the Terrans seem MUCH more powerful and
threatening when verifyable reports of this sort of technology reached them?  I
mean manipulating Humans was something the Ancients did!

> 3) What tech does it take to genetically alter a non-sapient species
> to sapience (i.e. dolphins)?
	You know Terrans must have appeared rather magical to the Vilani in
certain aspects.  Especially as time passed and they not only kept on coming
but got consistantly better technically at a, to the Vilani, frighteningly fast
rate.  Also there is the fact that the Terrans were the first Humans they
encountered who had developed Jump drive independently of themselves.
	I\'m reminded of the reaction of the Celts to the Romans and their
ability to put up and then take down bridges.  The Celts couldn\'t figure out
how the Romans did it so they simply called it magic.  A lot of what the
Terrans did must have been the same way to the Vilani.  Even worse must have
been when the Vilani got their hands on Terran technical and scientific
databases.  Their own culture prevented them from using most of the radical
ideas contained therein.

> Again, what Tech Level was the Rule of Man?
	Very Good Point!

Exactly. The Task system determines to an extent what type of game 
the group wants to play. Therefore, different probabilities are a 
good thing. It changes the Adventure to a different style of game, 
but this isn\'t bad! If a certain probability is what the players 
want, they caqqn desiggn their own task system with entirely 
different probabilities, which works for them. Sure, it\'s not what 
the designers intended, but is sure works for those players!

Nio you don\'t. The results sure will be different, but that\'s not 
bad at all It just reflectzs a different style of gaming.

Sounds great! Please Mark, think about it and use this system in 
future products and include instructions how to use these 
descriptions in the main book of T4 along with the Task system you 
see fit for T4.1. Do this and i think that many of us will stop 
pushing their own system and cracking down on the official one 
because they can use whatever system THEY like with any new products!

A What!!!  Where did you find it, LaBrea?

More importantly, what do you use it for?  I recently sold (yes, I got real
money for it) my Apple IIe to a gent at MIT who collects old machines.  It
had previously served as conversation piece and paperweight.

This reminds me of a joke:

It is a dark stormy night at sea.  An Admiral on a huge, heavily armed and 
armoured air craft carrier gets a message on the radio demanding that he 
change course.

"Who is this?", says the Admiral.

"This is Ensign McGyvers sir, we humbly request you change course..."

The Admiral thinking that it\'s a lowly Ensign on a PT boat is not amused by 
the "order". "What, how dare you. I am an Admiral and this is a Carrier, you 
change course or I\'ll see you slapped down so hard you\'d think you were a 
first year cadet!

"I can\'t do that sir..."

"What?  This is insubordnation! I\'ll see you in chains for this..."

"Where a lighthouse sir!"

"Ulp!"

You got a point there but what about the opposite?
The Vilani grew up in an alien ecosystem where most everything had to be
carefully prepared in order to eat etc. The view that they didn\'t belong to
the plant/animal kingdom must have been much stronger in them than in us
and perhaps it was also easier to come up with the idea about changing the
environment to suit them as well. The Vilani view of nature would be devoid
of the animism we terrans universally embraced before the kings forced
monotheism upon us.

This might even be an interesting division in Vilani/Terran thought:
The Vilani will easily exterminate local animals/plantlife if they aren\'t
productive which we terrans find unacceptable thinking while we remodel
ourselves with geneering which look extremely disgusting to the Vilani.

Well, I did say "in hindsight". It probably seemed like a _great_
idea at the time. Its final effect was probably to hurt Vilani
infrastructure more than it helped it though.

Oh, crap. My apologies Harold, I seem to have confused the numbers
"13" and "14". You can ignore everything I said.

This statement is only true if the RoM had a TL of 13, which I thought
it did for a moment... the "TL-14" above should have said "TL-13".

Yes, of course. Finding TL 13 artifacts would be possible. I don\'t think
they\'d be so shabby either... anything that still works after a thousand
years or so is to be respected, regardless of TL. TL 14 is right out
though.

Now, the RoM did have some areas where their technology was higher 
than anything ever seen in the mainstream Imperium, even in the 1100s,
like genetic and medical technology, possibly robotics as well. It
might be possible for travellers to find some interesting robotic
goodies towards the rim... hmmm...

Less confused now,
Ethan

Sure, but those are fairly specific circumstances. The difficulty is
reduced in this scenario because the target has effectively stopped moving
in three dimensions and for the sniper\'s purposes, moves in only two as he
either moves directly *toward* you or *away* from you. But this describes
only one scenario.

If you want a good set of sniper rules for Traveller, refer to Harold
Hale\'s TNE sniper rules at the HIWG home page. They\'re at:

http://home.sn.no/~starwolf/HIWG/

Follow the HIWG ftp archive to the Rules folder and download sniper.zip.
Great stuff. It can be extrapolated to use for any Traveller game.

Yes, but tankers need only fear artillery rounds or shots fired from other
tanks. With MT rules, a guy with an ACR can penetrate BD with astonishing
ease. Definitely a problem.

The problem becomes even more acute if you\'re running a mercenary or other
military campaign. In a merc campaign, you have a high incidence of these
encounters. The problems of the reality-flouting MT rules multiply
expontentially because you have a lot more people running around in combat
armor or BD. In a less militaristic campaign, you can get away with it
because such encounters may be few and far between.

I don\'t have a problem with trying not to kill PCs, but I\'d rather show
mercy for them when using realistic mechanics so I know more accurately
what I\'ve allowed them to survive.

Cool! I saw a Kaypro 3 at the swap meet (giant organized permanent garage

And the reason why the Vilani lags behind should be obvious. They are a
foreign species introduced to Vland. They have close relative to compare
themselves to, genetically.

We on Terra can experiment with Simians, sheep and whatnot to perfect
genetic techniques.

Actually, afaik in T4 there is a distinction. The default skill list

You make a very valid point. But if Chargen was designed to avoid this,
it wouldn\'t be a problem.

Forex: Characters get the same number of skill *choices* they do now,
they just get 2 skill levels up to skill-6, after which skills advance
by one level...

or:

Characters get a certain number of free skill levels (say 4 per year)
which they can choose to use to advance a skill choice by up to 3...

or:

Characters roll a task to advance skill levels, spectacular failure
means they don\'t advance, failure means they advance one skill level,
success means 2 levels, spectacular success means 3 levels... (or some
other formula)

or:

Characters advance 3 skill levels for the first choice that term, 2
skill levels for the second and third, and 1 skill level for subsequent
choices...


I guess I\'m just trying to say that there are ways to avoid problems
like this, and keep the number of skills awarded similar to what it is
now, while nudging the actual value of skills into a slightly higher
range.

I don\'t think we should be wedded to the 1=novice, 6=expert skill scale
we were accustomed to in CT & MT, because T4 already changed this in its
first incarnation: it was quite possible to get double digit levels, or
nearly so.

If a skill range 1-15 improves the task system, I say "Make it so."

Amen Brother vanya! Testify!

This is always been a craw in my side, errr. or something like that.

If you\'re using a difficulty based task system, for goodness sakes,
adjust the difficulty levels only! Result modifiers (+1 to die roll et.
al.) are useless, complicating, and create inaccuracies in the carefully
constructed probability charts.

They also make it difficult to plug in a different die rolling
mechanism. (like MT or KBv.20 or FUDGE or your own pet system)

for example: a -1 to the roll creates vastly different probabilities for
2d6 tasks compared to 4d6 tasks. Lets not use apples to modify oranges
here. (I must stop mixing metaphors...)

I did some research once a while back, as I was going to do my own version
of Core sector...

Subsector G (Core) is in TD#8, I (Bunkeria) and J (Cemplas) are in #9, and
K (Chant) and M (Cadion) are in TD #10; in addition, the library data
from all three TDs has other worlds defined, and a couple are "post-Imperial"
colonies, from that information.

The only other Core information I can find in other products deals with 
Shudusham (TD #8) and Capital (TD #9), except for a reference in Challenge #30
detailing that the world of Ushra (1016 Core) has an Imperial Duke who is
the leader of the Moot when Emperor Strephon\'s double was murdered.
There are some references in "Arrival Vengeance", which I don\'t have, but
as it\'s TNE, it probably doesn\'t matter anyway.

Anders, You are missing an opportunity to incorporate this stuff into
your view of canon exactly as Solomani propaganda.  The Solomani & Aslan
entries are perfect examples of _how_ the Solomani rest on the laurels of
their Terran ancestors, rather than their own achievements.  Especially,
if you accept the _clearly canonical concept_ of a high TL RoM. :)

With this new perspective, it wouldn\'t hurt anyone to reread some of the

Actually, I have been thinking about this a little more lately.  I am
withholding sources (for now) because I want to get reasonable opinions
on the subject.  I do see a consensus forming here, rather than a debate
about canon, and that pleases me quite well, thank you!  The canonality
of my sources are not some obscure quote taken out of context, but very
clear references.  Last I knew, even _you_ had the sources I had, so
until I am ready, be content with doing your own research (like we did).

>far a great deal of evidence has been presented that contradicts your

Sorry Harold, but the only evidence you have presented was what was already
pointed out on the list.  The rest is what I would deem suitable for your
own campaign.  TKO yes--but not against those who are being open-minded. :)

I am still working on my Python script to come up with a more reasonable,
though not identical, distribution of worlds, population, etc.  Right now,
I am happy with the three physical stats.

Now, I just need to write my main finder, Hi pop parceller, and colonizer
to do the social stats.

I also need to write something that will determine the economic UWP as
well.  Since I am going to use a slightly different approach than Stuart
and Joe, anyone adapting this will need to fiddle with it a bit.  (labor
vanishes as a computed stat, to be replaced by a life rating.  Ag/Na,
In/Ni, and Ri/Po are all descriptions of stats in the economic UWP,
summarized for use.)

I am very, very interested in fixes, though, as I do want to keep any
canonical data, such as the Geonee home worlds, etc., as published.  This
maximizes the chance that I can use published adventures, etc.

Anyone else working over various sectors, do drop me a line.

A lot of this has to do with how things are invented but also with how 
you use your resources.  Let me take some imperfect analogies from 
current day:

Inventions:  The "Black & Decker Workmate(TM)" was invented 20 years 
ago, approximately.  The TL of this invention is around 4.

Resources: The soviets build high-tech rockets (subject to some debate, 
I know), but their automobile design is a TL (or more) behind the rest 
of the rocket-building countries.

If you look at modern chemical plants (for bulk chemicals like methanol 
and ammonia) all of the main equipment is TL5.  The electronic controls 
are better than those used on the shuttle!  The real advance since TL 5 
has been in lots and lots of research into how to make better catalysts 
- - the advances in materials (metals) technology is relatively 
insignificant in comparison.  If I gave the "recipe" to a TL 5 
engineer, I can assure you that they could build a "modern" plant - 
there is nothing in the manufacturing process that requires higher than 
TL 5, just time to research things.

The time spent on research is why there should be (IMO) a big 
divergence in Solomani TL 13 and Vilani TL 13.  For Traveller races, 
particularly during a war, the TL will be characterised by Jump in 
preference to anything else.  Inside the Imperium in M:1100 there is 
much more similarity of tech between world, with the differences due to 
how people spend their R&D time - better anti-rust coatings for TL 6 
vehicles or cheaper chemicals production so that they can sell for low 
prices into the interstellar market.

"History is decided by the victors" - one of the ways to "define" each 
TL is "what the <prefered race> achieved at the same time as Jump X".

I see the Traveller (referee\'s view) of TL as being "what can be 
readily reproduced by a society that can achieve Jump X <or other key 
defining technology>".  Thus, once the "secret" of gravitics is out, 
any TL 9 society could build them.  Left to its own devices a given 
culture may never have discovered gravitics, as grav tech may be 
irrelevant to their world.


I have no problem believing that one culture failed to develop Fusion 
Plus while achieving TL 14 in other areas (beam weapons? batteries? 
figher pilot training?).  Similarly one race may decide that fighters 
were not viable for space combat (see earlier TML rules wars) while 
another culture came up with a brilliant way of using fighters for 
space combat ... when these two races go to war, one of them is likely 
to revise their opinions!

   Any design system for a game that pretends to be 3.5% accurate is
   fooling itself.  The only reason that Traveller (or any RPG) has
   design systems at all is to put a hamper on munchkin abuses.  In CT,
   the claim on the designs were that they were accurate to within 20%,
   as far as deckplan layout went.  That is a reasonable claim for a game,
   especially a game with such simplistic rules for designing things as
   complex as starships.
   
   If you want to add seven tons of cargo to your design, the only thing
   stopping you is referee fiat.  A 3.5% change in the definition of a
   ton is well below the game\'s realism resolution, and won\'t cause any
   realistic problems at all.  It will mereley inflate or deflate the
   dimensions inside your starship by 1% and will have no effect on
   roleplaying.  A more reasonable 20% uncertaintly corresponds to a 6%
   slop in your ship\'s dimensions.

I quote from "The Long Way Home" page 7:

    To detect a gas giant 1 parsec away (12 hours)
    (Education+Survey)+DMs < Difficult (2.5D)
    Uncertain (1D)
    
    DM\'s depend upon the contents of the target system:  -1 if only one
    small gas giant is present, +1 for each gas giant beyond the first,
    -2 for each parsec beyond he first, -1 if the target star is size I,
    II or III.

end quote.

This format follows that laid out in a post Marc presented to the list on
97/02/22.  I *like* Marc\'s layout and the processes it follows, but I think
it could be made a little more generic without losing important
information.

My understanding of J\'s suggestion is to remove as many system specific
details as possible.  In the example above, you would remove the + signs
and the (2.5D) because not all task systems would add the full stat to the
full skill level and not all Difficult task levels would use 2.5D.
Additionally, as many DMs as possible should be expressed as changes to
task level rather than flat +/- numbers to maximize cross-system
compatability.  

Concerning the DMs, I suggest dropping the number, but retaining the + and
- - signs.  A single + or - would indicates a minor DM and ++ or --
indicates a major DM, for whatever task system being used.

A more generic Task Description:

    To detect a gas giant 1 parsec away (12 hours)
    (Education,Survey,DMs) < Difficult, Uncertain 
    
    +DM for each gas giant beyond 1
    -DM if only one gas giant present
    -DM if target star is I, II, or III
    --DM for each parsec beyond 1
    
I\'m not going to say my suggested layout is *better* than Marc\'s, but I
think it is more generic, and it still gives all the information you\'d need
to use it with T4/T4.1..and I *think* MT.  

You can take the components and plug them into systems that divide Stats,
multiply Skills, or don\'t use the Stat at all.  You can take the DM\'s and
use them as task level modifiers, or target number modifiers whichever you
choice of task system requires.  How much each DM affects the outcome is up
to the task system, but *relative* importance is given as a guideline.

	OK. Let\'s go back and rehash AGAIN what I said, instead of twisting it.
The example I used he DIDN\'T HAVE TRAINING! There\'s a big difference in
training  between a first year med school student (Med-1?) and a graduate
(Med-4). And I never mentioned a low intelligence person. PS: If he never
got it right in training, how did he get the skill? This isn\'t like the
american education system, where you can get a piece of paper meaning
absolutely nothing. The skill is an absolute, gaming measure of your level
of knowledge or training in a specific field.

	I repeat: If you give me a task system where a very bright first-year med
student (Med-1, Int-12) is a better doctor than an average MD (Med-4,
Int-8), it reflects not at all reality. In fact, it goes against reality.
The Med student HASN\'T HAD ALL THE TRAINING! There is quite a bit he
*won\'t* know not to do , simply because he hasn\'t learned not to do it, and
it\'s not intuitive.

	Anything else doesn\'t pass my common sense test. Albert Einstein, with
Int-99, couldn\'t do heart surgery until he\'d gotten thorough training.
Med-1 doesn\'t provide that level of training.

	Every version of Traveller prior to T4 has allowed ANYBODY to take a shot
at a task. Lack of skill simply means you don\'t have much chance to do it.

	If he\'s got skill-4, he\'s competent. He may not be brilliant, but he\'s
competent. Certainly better trained than Skill-1.

	I\'m not arguing talent doesn\'t make a difference. But it\'s not the
overriding point. Int-12 Med-1 will never ever match Int-8 Med-4 over the
range of tasks a doctor performs.

	I don\'t have a problem with Stat-8 Med-1 trying heart surgery. But Stat-12
Med-1 doesn\'t mean he\'s more "talented" at medicine than Stat-8 Med-4.

	If you really would prefer a first-year med student to treat you when you
come into a hospital, that\'s fine. I\'ll go with the licensed MD...

	OK, I must have missed that one. It\'s only been a decade since I\'ve played
CT. And frankly, when I did, I let people roll regardless, just penalized
them.

	We are obviously talking at right angles here. I\'m treating skill as
absolute, you seem to be treating it as a relative. The range for me comes
in with how well that person can apply the skill, measured by attribute.

	I\'m not automatically negating new ideas for the game, or I wouldn\'t be
bothering to discuss it. I could equally fling out the irrelevant charge
that other people are automatically accepting anything new and different as
good, which is just as ridiculous.

	I\'ve got no major problem with rolling multiple dice, and I can accept the
half-die, even from the original task system. Rather than automatically
negating the new ideas, I\'ve looked at the EFFECTS of the new idea of a
flat stat+skill, and they don\'t work for me. I could care less how many
other games use them, that doesn\'t mean it works for me.

	It\'s obvious we want different kinds of games here. In your game, skills
aren\'t really important. Players would be much better off concentrating on
increasing their stats, with low skills (you\'re the one who claims Int-11
Med-1 is better than Int-8, Med-4). Why waste time trying to get more than
skill-1 in anything? That same point could be applied to a stat, and boost
a whole RANGE of skills.

	I prefer a game where you have to balance your skills to get the kind of
character you want. I don\'t want a game to be "OK, we\'ve got our
high-strength character and our high-int character. Now we need somebody to
roll up a high-dex character." That smacks too much of D&D\'s "OK, we\'ve got
a fighter and a mage. Who\'s going to be the thief?"

	Instead, I want the players to try to get a good mix of abilities. "OK,
Joe\'s a good pilot and navigator, we\'ve got a gunner with some medical
ability. I\'ll try to pick up some trading skills and admin, and maybe a
little engineering--maybe I\'ll try the merchant career field. Nobody\'s got
high weapons skills, so let\'s avoid personal combat, folks..."

>say that the idea that other games have tried stat+skill and found
>it to work means that it can work for Traveller too.

	Other games also have different feels. Traveller generally has not had the
"Ultra-Heroic" feel of the Lensman series, where a single character could
do everything well simply because of characteristics, while another average
(note: don\'t twist average to mean moron or clumsy, please) character could
never hope to match him. And there are very few people in real life who can
do everything well.

	BTW, please don\'t take any of this as a personal attack. I disagree
strongly with much of your rationale, but that\'s simply because I prefer a
different style of game. Not that mine\'s better than yours--well, for me it
is, but not in an absolute sense--but we\'re obviously not getting through
to each other. Our underlying assumptions are different, which means we\'re
thinking at right angles.

Hm.  This one could be very easy to explain.  Unless a vacc suit _requires_
Fusion Plus (or unless the factory that makes it requires Fusion Plus) then
you could have advanced vacc suit technology without the energy technology.

Not to restart the whole TL debate/flamewar again, but tech levels aren\'t
monolithic, and many times alternate technologies can provide the same
effects.

Thus, for HTL flight you need a power source with a good power-to-mass ratio.
 Better materials technology will help to lower the mass (of both the engine
and the plane), but there is no restriction on _which_ power tech you use,
provided that it can meet the power-to-mass requirements.

A society could have cars, trains, etc. without internal combustion engines -
just use external combustion engines instead.

Modern tanks don\'t have holes.  They are completely sealed to combat
the use of chemical and biological weapons.  They do have armoured
periscopes for manual viewing, but these are armour plated and even a
.50 calibre round will not be able to pierce the bullet proof glass,
ricochet around inside the periscope body (which contains even more
bulletproof glass, I believe), and enter the tank through the eye
piece.

If you are talking about a tank commander that pops the hatch to get a
better view of the battlefield, this is more akin to removing one\'s
helmet when wearing BD, not a lucky shot that somehow manages to
penetrate a TL12 visor or articulated joint.

But was the shot intentional?  I think not.  Your confusing exactly
how far away a pistol can lob a piece of lead (on a good day, with
ideal circumstances) with how far away a shooter can hope to hit a
target (without relying 100% on pure luck).

The handwaving crew (at least this one ;-) suggests that minimal
pressurization is required, but that the system pressurizes itself via
evaporation. More than likely, allowing some of it to evaporate and vent
helps keep it cool...you don\'t really want your cryogenic systems
_completely_ sealed, since then a cooling failure leads to explosive
pressure levels pretty quickly. I\'ll bet that LHyd systems on starships
are kept cool through a combination of passive (evaporative cooling+
radiators) and active (refrigeration systems) The problem with cyogenic
systems, is that the efficiency way down there at 20K isn\'t so hot, (so to
speak).

It wasn\'t a joke.  It was part of an actual transcript between a US
naval vessel and Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in
October, 1995 (I happen to have the article right in front of me...
what a coincidence).


US ship: "Please divert your course 0.5 degrees to the south to avoid
a collision."

Canada: "Recommend you divert /your/ course 15 degrees to the south to
avoid a collision."

US ship: "This is the captain of a US navy ship.  I say again, divert
/your/ course."

Canada: "No.  I say again, divert /your/ course."

US ship:  "This is the aircraft carrier USS Missouri.  We are a large
warship of the US Navy.  Divert your course NOW!" (you can almost
/feel/ the arrogance)

Canada:  This is a lighthouse.  Your call.

My only suggestion would be to change the "increase difficulty level" to
"increase difficulty", thus emphasising that the choice between a +1 Dm and a
level change is up to the referee (and each task system should have a default
choice)

Actually, I would suggest that T4.1 is printed with several task systems
inside, each one corresponding to a definate game style.  This way the game
appeal is broadened (several styles, one game) and if the book is properly
written it will be _very_ clear that the gamers should pick one system and
stick to it.

I\'d even like to see the \'skill sets difficulty level\' system that Eris wrote
of; I think we could do this by specifying that the difficulty in the task
profile is for a person with skill-3 (or some other standard level). 
Although in this case I think that I would allow alternate attributes, with
penalties.  For example, a task may require intelligence but a really well
educated person might be able to apply some of their generalized knowledge,
thus I would let a player use Int or Edu/2, their choice.

The problem I have with this arose when we were trying to figure out
whether that free traders we could design _using the rules in the book_,
could be economically viable _using the rules in the book_!

If by referee fiat, I can just magically add space as needed, why have a
design system at all?

Granted, this degenerates rapidly into a Rule playing vs. Role playing
argument, in which I fall firmly on the side of the Role-playing camp.

But the truth is all I want is that a consistent set of units be used. If
one book says a Td is 14 m^3, another says that it\'s 13.5 m^3 and yet
another says that it\'s 10 m^3 or whatever, there is an undeniable problem
no matter WHAT the \'slop factor\' on deckplans is.

They also have to worry about ATGMs like the TOW-2 being fired from every
bush, land mines, Infantry firing AT-4s into their tracks for a mobility
kill, and the ever popular greande through the hatch.  This is why, much to
the Armor\'s disgust, they still need to work with the infantry.

At Ft. Irwin, I kept a T-72 crew pinned inside their disabled tank for over
an hour by simply popping of a round everytime I saw something move.  It
was about 100F outside, I hate to think what it was like in that box...

For military style combat, I use systems like Stargrunt II or Dirtside II
(both from Ground Zero Games).  For more abstract large combats, CORPS has
an excellent mass combat system that I would love to see Greg Porter adapt
for Traveller.

BattleDress isn\'t just the armor, but the sensors, commo, and ability to
bring near-vehicle class weaponry into the infantry enviroment.  A Marine
wearing TL12 ABD and carrying a RF-Gauss rifle is going to be a match for a
modern US rifle platoon.  However, he has to work as part of a team, since
all it takes is one lucky shot (the "golden BB") to render him combat
ineffective (dead, wounded, or just disable the armor.)

I have spent 20 years on a quest for the best combat mechanics.  IMHO,
CORPS comes closest.  For the kind of Traveller combat I tend to run
(pistols and shotguns mainly) MT worked well.

Oddly enough, I don\'t run many military/Mercenary games.. maybe it\'s a case
of been there, done that..

Either post the relevant quotes from a Traveller product (GDW or DGP) that
states clearly that the RoM reached higher than TL12, or give it a rest.

Since you have time to respond to everyone in this thread, I find it hard
to believe that you don\'t have the time to look through the few books that
mention the RoM for this info.

Yeah, but we can\'t go too far here.  Afterall, the Vilani did pay the Terrans
much attention until it was too late.  At the same time, the grunts in the
trenches might have been totally demoralized by what they saw, and by then it
would have been too late to tell any leadership about it.

OK.  This fits with the TL19 MT reference for terraforming a size 8 world.
It is easy to explain the relatively lagging Jump Tech level for two reasons:

  1) the Terrans were new on the scene and were just getting used to the
     idea of how this new-fangled jump drive really worked. In fact, their
     tech was so good that some of the things they didn\'t really understand
     well.  They used the J-drive for quite a time just in-system around Sol

  2) when the _did_ realize what they had, they met Vilani and pretty
     quickly had themselves in an Interstellar War.  Further research,
     except that deemed critical, on J-drive would have been delayed until
     the wars could be prosecuted.

That last part is reminiscent of the American War Production Board of WWII
era:  the railroads got all orders that had been made, reallocated to what
made the most sense, so some railroads that were not transcontinental and
reaching pacific coast ports got the Steam engines, while roads like the
Santa Fe got the whale\'s share of the newest Diesel engines.  New development
was postponed until after the war was prosecuted.

>But if the sttements in the rules saying "The Rule of Man was Tl 12."
>are read as "The High Common TL of the Rule of Man was 12." then

Yeah, but the achievements (in MT\'s own definitions) strongly suggest
that Terra was a High Common of 16.  I can see this remaining until
the 3I takes care of the rim in prosecuting the Rim War, explaining
why Terra, after all of that, is TL15.

I like the comments (which give direction to someone just breezing through

gives players more latitude to decide on the relative difficulty to be

Of course the mechanic then says, "Well, I\'m being cautious, which negates

The assisting part is really just making this a co-operative task.

Suspect it\'s apocyphal or urban legend...the USS Missouri is a

I am looking over Twilights Peak to modify and run in my campaign.  When
we played it before (oh so long ago) I remember we had a question that
now one in our group could answer well...so I would like to hear how
some of you dealt with it.  The question is:  what is this "ancient"
base doing at the end of some tunnels under one of the octagon
buildings?  The base was built long before the building was even there. 
So did the builders stumble upon the "big metal door" while they were
digging to put in the well...wouldn\'t it have been worth a lot more
money to the Octagon society to sell off the location of an ancient base
(to further their cause) rather than to just build the structure and
move on.  Did some previous resident (without all his marble stumble
across the door while digging near the well and brick it up and put in
the secret doors in the octagon building.

Its not that I\'m knocking TP.  Its long been one of my favorite
adventures....and not half bad just or a good read.  I just wondered
what some of the opinions were about this.

Sorry to distract you from the GTB (great task debate)....well not
really too sorry. :->

I would use
"More difficult if in a confined space"
"Less difficult if another character is assisting"
"Much More difficult if character if suit is damaged"
"Much Less Difficult if characters has an E-Z-Use suit"

Where Much More or Much Less is a two level shift, while a mere More or
Less represents a single level shift.

	Uh... just nitpicking again. Imperium did produce experimental TL 17 
technology. 

	MT Rebellion Sourcebook, adventure "Nail Mission" features
Voroshilef-class battleships "with a highly experimental
Disintegrator-A spinal mount, which convenietly fit into the space
left by removing the particle accelerator-R" (Rebellion Sourcebook,
p.92).

	MT Ship Design sequence in MT Referee\'s Manual states on p. 71 that 
Disintegrator-A spinal mount is TL 17 technology. Since the PCs are 
sent to retrieve spares for these crucial weapons from 
Depot/Corridor, it must be assumed that the weapons were of Imperial 
manufacture, not any Ancient artifacts or Vorlon imports. :P

	Maybe they didn\'t tell us when else they came up with...? ;)

   Chris, you are obviously missing the Tanker\'s Lesson.  Tankers can not
stay in the tank all the time.  They have to get out sometime.  When they
get out to empty the honey bucket or grab a bite of hot chow, the sniper
then blows their head off.  This is why tanks don\'t operate without
infantry.  This goes double in non-armor friendly areas such as cities.
Too many rat holes to hide a rocket launcher.  The rocket doesn\'t have to
penatrate the armor.  Just blowing a tread off is enough to cost the tank
it\'s mobility.  Pillboxes are easier to destroy than tanks.

At last someone has the guts to say what I have felt a long time.
As I have lurked and read some (far from all) of the post in the 
Task-War I have gotten angry at the many attacks Ken has gotten 
because he advocates one system. At least he has gone to great 
langht to fix the things he didn\'t like about T4.0 tasks. Some of
you out there see that T4.0 is broken but still sit on your asses
screaming for the return of the MT system. Hell open the MT books,
read the system and use it. If you would like Marc to include it
in the T4.1 book, listen to Ken and others problems with the MT
system. These are players and DMs having trouble with your favorite
system, and their problems are your chance to make the MT system better.

And for all out there. Stop the personalized attackes. To us lurkers
out there, (at least to me), the attacks of the creative persons on
the TML is scary, depriving me and surly others from having the guts
to make something, post it and then be man or woman enough to stand 
for what we have posted. Creativity should be encourage, not beaten down.
There is a difference between creative critizisme and attacking someone.

Yes and no.  Its a matter of (dis)liking either the mechanics of the
system (eg: dividing character stats "on the fly") or the results it
produces (eg: SS should outnumber regular successes on easy tasks).

If you want to include two different task systems in T4.1 for the
reason of "offering players the choice of running two different styles
of campaigns (Space Opera vs. Hard SF)", then DMs become less of an
issue.  Big deal if one task system gives me a far greater chance at
success than the other.  Compatibility between task systems is no
longer the main issue.

But if you plan to include two task systems so that the players have a
choice based more on the esthetic appearance of their of mechanics,
then DMs become an issue.  Players on TML don\'t seem to be arguing for
task systems that provide them with results specific to their style of
campaign; they are arguing over the mechanics of the task systems (eg:
"half dice suck", "2d6 is the only way", etc.).

While it might be rather confusing to a novice gamer to see scads of
task systems in print every where s/he turns, it is probably the best
way.

Anyways, I thought it was fun. I found one of my first Xboat

Also, as a point of reference, there are 6 digests in the archive
dated today (June 27), there will probably be 7 or 8 by the time
the day is up. Way back then, you got one digest a day, almost
every day. Sometimes you only got one every two days. They were
also a lot shorter, as the digests went out at midnight regardless
of size, unlike now, when they go out due to "filling up" almost
every time. There are numerous digests from the past week in
the 35Kb range, while in 94/95 I don\'t think I saw a single
digest top 30Kb, maybe 25Kb was the top.

Too bad TML activity doesn\'t translate into better Traveller sales.

I can\'t take credit for that idea. You can praise (or curse) Merrick for
that one. ;-> Personally I had trouble getting my brain around it.

The one I posted was the compromise between Marc\'s and Ken\'s systems where
you didn\'t multiply skills or divide stats, just increased the number of
skills earned.  BTW, that doesn\'t *necessarily* mean more skills picked or
rolled, one of the procedures mentioned earlier today could be used: get 2
levels per skill; get 3 first time, 2 second time, 1 every other time; roll
a task and get variable levels depending on the success; etc.  The "1-6
Skill Levels or Bust" bunch are the ones that squealed like stuck pigs when
I posted it. ;->

Hmmm...
I was working under the M:0 text, something on the lines of "...was located 
in Chant subsector, 1 subsector rimward of Core."  When i wen looking for 
"Keshi" i noticed it was in the subsector 1 subsector rimward of Chant. 
 \'Chant\' was the closest name I could find, and built my asumption on that 
premise.

Mind you if it is Chant, that would explain why Shaaak, a world 1pc from 
Sylea with a hi pop wasn\'t incorporated into the Federation.  It would lead 
to the Chant arm of the Sylean main.

Mind you my theories have been known to be proven wrong before :-)

Two points:  the USN has never to my knowledge had an *aircraft carrier*
USS Missourri.  A BB, yes, but not an aircraft carrier.  Also, I have
a book of \'Humor in Uniform\' columns from Reader\'s Digest published in 
the 1950s with this same story in it, with extremely minor differences.
It\'s your call, but I\'d say that the transcript is bogus.

Now, task systems anyone?

 I\'m a little surprised that I\'m listed first; as I recall, the
 inspiration to that debate and the final rework/summarization

 interesting discussion it was.  These are the rules that
 eventually got incorporated into Jim\'s GALACTIC program; as I
 recall, Jim also included the text of the thread with the
 program.  I suspected that this was what you were thinking of
 when you mentioned the "life stat".

 I\'d like to mention that I always felt that that discussion was
 an absolutely shining example of what I always hoped for from
 the TML - and actually got, more often than not.

The rule I use is that the deackplan can have a maximum 20% off value,
since there seldome is a constant height value. The total volume of the
compnent, cargo space, or what ever is still the value given in the
design rules.

One should really differ between the values in the spreadsheet and in 
the dackplanes as I said over. Your arguement hits home the day the 
players want to design ship. Then you really need a design system that 
is consistent with all ships you have used in the campaign so far, or
you\'ll have to make some real handwaving.

Not necesseraly a rule vs. role, but a design system makes it easier to
stay consistent. Can a jump 2 vessel have 90% cargo space or not. 
One should always remeber that players remember more than the GM of what
has happend so far in the campaign.

The Td is 14 cub meters in my game no matter what others say and will 
stay that way. Both QSDS and SSDS is based on this value and as long 
as these are the design systems, it really doesn\'t matter what NA or 
other guides say. It then becomes only a conversion problem for deckplans
and so on.

I generally think of it as the stuff published by GDW (and later DGP

included, but at the same time I think of those more highly than other
fan press sources, at bottom of which I find Judge\'s Guild.

My approach is to research _everything_ I can find, see if a grand
hypothesis is to be found, and then assess that hypothesis for general
playability, suitability, and how it fits into how I see the (Traveller)
universe.  Then, I determine if it stays or goes.

How about you all?

What are the no-no\'s on your lists (i.e. casual reading, but no room
in your campaign)?

How are discrepancies (beyond obvious typoes) reconciled?

Now I can get back to that test for tonight. :)

Ah, but I\'ll render that periscope pretty useless by shattering the outer

Important difference is that a BD equipped trooper is able to swivel his
head, turn around, and enhance his field of vision without sacrificing his
protection grossly.  To achieve this, the swivel points in the armor can\'t
be as heavily protected.  In my view, most BD comes with a
Kevlar-equivalant kilt to cover the hip and groin area, since you need to
flex tose areas with some freedom.  (This also lets me justify my Marines
wearing kilts as part of their dress uniforms.)

A tanker needs to remove himself from this protection entirely to achieve
the same level of tactical awarness.  He takes a risk, but his incredibly
narrow view has been replaced by a complete range of vision and hearing.

Hope this doesn\'t get lost in the Task Crusades. :)

A bunch of us on the TNE mailing list, thought the THUDD contest was a
really nifty idea.  So with the idea  that imitation is the best
flattery we thought we would start a design contest using FFS I, and
TNE assumptions.  With a minimal amount of work they can also be turned
into T4 ships.  

Contest Rules

1)Fire Fusion and Steel (the first one, not FFS2) should be used with
all associated errata.  
 
2)All ships should use standard TNE universe technology.  ie no
Thruster plates, cold fusion, subspace or other optional
technology.  Jump fuel should be calculated with the formula in FFS,
not 10% per parsec.  Crew requirments should be calculated as printed in FFS.

3)Its fine to use spreadsheets, or other design aids.  
 
4)Designs should be sent to me; lewis@chara.gsu.edu by July 14th. 
After that I\'ll mail them to the mailing list and allow voting for a
week. I will also put up all the designs on the BARD pages
(http://www.chara.gsu.edu/~lewis/roberts.html) (though it might take me
until after voting to get them all up, depends on my schedule)
and once a winner is announced I will put up a special icon on the
winner.  At least for the first contest, the icon will be of the Ring
Nebula.  After that maybe I\'ll rotate nebulas or come up with another
idea.  If you want to look at the icon it is at:
http://www.chara.gsu.edu/~lewis/graphics/nebula.gif

5)Ships should have some sort of text piece to go along with it.  With
out a text explanation, ships tend to be just a list of numbers.

6) Voting will be done by the members of the Traveller and TNE mailing lists. 
(I guess if anyone else sends in a ballot I\'ll count that too, but I
doubt anyone will)

Feel free to tell any other people about the contest. The more the merrier.

When this idea was kicked around most people wanted to build
a Wilds Trader, so that will be the first ship to be designed.  After
that other ships usable in the Regency, Reformation Coalition as well
as ships produced during the Rebellion and other eras.  (Basically what
ever people want)

Here is a small intro paragraph to explain the story behind the Wilds
Trader.  I used the idea in Guilded Lilly of the RC buying old ships for new ones.

The RC has decided to institute a program of buying older highly worn
vessels from Free Traders, and replacing them with a new ship, which
can be maintained much easier and with Coalition supplied parts.
The benefits to the Coalition are that there will be a demand for
Coalition spare parts, the Free Traders will have to come to Coalition
space for repairs and annual maintenance.  The Free Traders will also
provide a means of communication between the Coalition and the Wilds.
This will start a base for further expansion of the RC. The RC will
also be able to salvage what ever remaining high tech parts these ships
have. It will also provide numerous jobs in the RC, and help spark
starport upgrades on worlds with only a B or C starport.  

The benefits to the Free Traders are that their ship will be much newer
and easier to maintain, there will be less down time, which will
increase profits.  They will have a steady supply of spare parts, as
opposed to the current situation of scrounging to find new parts at
every planet and starport.  While the Free Traders will have to come to
Coalition space to get the spare parts and maintenance, this will allow
them to purchase high tech merchandise that is unavailable in the Wilds,
further increasing profits. 

The RCSA feels that the standard Jayhawk Far Trader is unsuitable for
this task, for several reasons and is soliciting designs for a new Wilds
Trader.    The new ship can be built at any of the Coalition\'s shipyards,
at any associated Tech Level,  Jump Drives from Aubaine will have to be used  
and are available at the standard price.    At this time the RCSA
doesn\'t want to impose restrictions on the design of the ship.  It feels
that starship architects best know how to design ships, but it
encourages companies to interview Free Traders to get a feel for what
they want in a ship. 

The winning design, will be chosen by a panel of experts.  They will
judge the ship on affordability, survivability, profitability and general
usefulness.  Designs should be sent to the RCSA headquarters on Aubaine
by 14/VII/1202.

But the basic assumption that Characters are going to get 1 skill per year
means that the CT level of skills truly does fall out. CT just didn\'t have
tasks... its basic assumption was a special case for every situation, with
definitions like Med-3 = Doctor. Now, that has to be shifted to more like
Med-5 or Med-6, with expert doctors at Med-9 or Med-12.

I just don\'t see how we can keep thinking that the CT skill levels apply. The
roots of the change were in Mercenary, which gave people so many new skills
and in such higher proportions.

Indeed, the CharGen pieces I have posted all assume that characters get 1
skill (or slightly more) per year. No one has said, let\'s go back to 1 skill
per 4 years; they want the higher skill levels.

With that, then the task system needs to reflect skills at levels 0 to 15 or
so.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, folks! I think we\'re losing sight of one BIG thing that has
been mentioned on this list in recent times: we are trying to attract new, 
*NEOPHYTE* players to the game and make things as easy for them as 
possible. I think it is not only acceptable for the task DMs and number of
dice to be in the task description like the first example, but should be
expected
as well. While I know what you are describing in your 2nd example, if I was
a beginning ref, I don\'t think I\'d have a real clue *what* exactly I was 
supposed to do with those things. Add, subtract, multiply? Time to dig out 
the main rules (and the latest upgrades and variants in the Journal: this game
does remind me of _Star Fleet Battles_ on occasion <g>) and try and remember
what page all this was on... But give me a task like the first one, and the
memory
prompts are there already to help me remember what it is I\'m supposed to be
doing.

And the thing this ignores *most* is that there *is* going to be an OFFICIAL
task system for this game... So why not set up the examples to make it as 
easy as possible to use the official system? All of us out here in codgerland
who have been playing rpgs since the Carter Administration can very easily
translate what we need out of that first example into our own version of the
task system; far easier than I feel a beginner could translate it correctly
and
with the least amount of trouble into the official system (and most probably,
the only one he/she knows about). Let them get a campaign or two under
their belt before expecting them to care whether a Med-5 should get 
Spectacular Success more often than Regular Success. <g>

I\'ll be quiet now <g>.

Unless some big changes have happened in the USN since I last did business
with them, something\'s been garbled here.  The Mighty Mo is (was) a
battleship, and not active in 1995.  I\'m almost certain there\'s no carrier
using the name; states seem reserved for boomers and battleships by Navy
tradition.
 
> Canada:  This is a lighthouse.  Your call.

ROFL!  Reminds me of a story my former coworker the ex-Admiral told me,
about the day (in the late 70s, I believe) a CVN ran aground off the coast
of Southern California. It hit some just-under-the-surface rocks...with
several lighted warning buoys on top!  Seems there was a shift rotation on
the bridge just minutes earlier, outgoing crew figured the new guys would
deal with it, incomers spent a few minutes chatting before checking the
charts, *crunch*.  A team of top fleet brass jet-helicoptered out to the
scene to investigate.  Quite a few careers ran aground that day, too...

Also (more peripherally) reminds me of my favorite WWII naval story.  USN
squadron was escorting a convoy of merchants across the North Atlantic,
and entering an area known to present a high threat of U-Boat activity.
One of the US subs accompanying the group signals over to the command
cruiser, "In the event of an attack, we plan to remain on the surface."

Moments later, the cruiser signals back, "So do we." :)

I was pretty sure as well, but I posted it word-for-word, just the

As long as it is recognized that skill levels above 8 or so approach
renowned experts or legendary operators.  Most people will have many skills
in the 2-4 range, and function quite nicely in society.  Someone with
Rifle-12 should be a legend on the scale of GnySgt Carlos Hathcock.. A man
who *never* seems to miss.


In my games, I will continue to encourage players to develop characters
with a wide range of abilities.. not to the point where everybody can do
each other\'s jobs, but to reflect that people pick things up as they go
along in life.  I know very few mono-maniacal types who focus on one skill
to the exclusion of any other.

Also, I would like to see a return of the skill ceiling.. some method of
keeping players from amassing every skill in the book at level 5.  The
INT+EDU limit, the suggestion of making every skill point beyond a certain
level "cost" double, all of these would work well, IMHO.

This may make that particular sighting device unusable, but it does
not resulting in wounding the human operator(s) inside.  This thread
originated from the discussion regarding how easily BD was penetrated
by small arms using the MT task system (by adopting such a system and
allowing such events to take place, one would have to go back and
rewrite everything regarding the imperviousness of BD in T4, CSC, EA,
etc.).  But I digress...

I\'d imagine driving a 60-ton tank by braille would be kinda fun...
specially like that US Army soldier that commandeered one and lead an
entire police force on a chase sequence rivalling OJ\'s!  :)

Ever see one of those Newt Suits used in deep-sea diving (designed
just across the inlet in North Vancouver)?  They do not have flexible
joints *anywhere*; just a series of rotating hemispheres.  Although
their very construction technique means that the materials that the
suit is made from don\'t have to be very strong, I don\'t see why
similar technology couldn\'t be used in MCr0.5 BD to protect joints,
etc.

Kilts!?!  Do they all wear the "Berry" tartan?  Do they carry golf
clubs as melee weapons, too?  :P

This is true of any form of protection.  Unfortunately, it has little
bearing regarding how the MT task system allows hits to be inflicted
on BD occupants when much of what is written about battledress in TNE
and T4 describe BD as being nigh-invulnerable to small arms (just like
"The Tick").

I went to the Naval Academy (US that is).  I can tell you INT played a
very minor roll......what mattered was (DEX/n)+(SKILL*m) in athletics.
8-p      {where the values of n and m are adjusted to whatever task

Now, James! ;->  If you were quoting the article then it *was* a joke. The
USS Missouri is a battleship, not a carrier, and in 1995 had been recently
decommissioned.  I rather suspect this is just another "urban myth", but it

The movie _The Beast_ is an excellent example (and a wonderful movie)
about just how desperate and paranoid a lone tank/jump trooper/mech/etc.
is when it\'s lost and alone deep in enemy territory.

Again, you are missing a point here.  The differnce you are
talking about is that a first year med student shouldn\'t
be able to do open heart surgery _no matter his skill_.
Yet if you let Medical-1 people roll to do heart surgery
they only have a modestly small chance (-2 to roll) than a full doctor
(skill-3).  The problem here isn\'t that stats are overvalued.
It\'s that you are letting someone roll when they aren\'t trained.

The solution is not to deny that a talented person with Medical-1
will be better at Medical-1 appropriate tasks than a less talented
person.  It to not let _any_ Medical-1 people (regardless of
target number) roll against Medical-3 tasts.

Um no.  GM\'s in Classic Traveller do not have to allow rolls
against skill-0.

I don\'t agree.  A person with Stat-12 Med-1 will be better at many
things that a Stat-8 Med-4.  I\'ve seen this before.  A young
talent starts learning and as soon as a subject is covered
he\'s doing better than it than a mediocre hack who never really
understood it in the first place.  So you don\'t let him
roll against things he hasn\'t trained yet (ie heart surgery
is a Medical-3 proceedure) but you don\'t just deny that
he _can_ be better at more basic proceedures than the 
hack with more training.

No.  I got it.  It was just expressed in a bandwidth wasting method.

I don\'t expect that.  I just want people to realise that this
oppositoin to stat+skill as "broken" is hardly a universally
accepted idea.

Um no.  In my games _both_ skilsl and stats are important.

I have agreed that, for game balance, stat increases should be
harder to get.  After all, this is a more fundamental aspect
of your character.  I just think both talent and skill need
to be equally expressed in the skill resolution.

Actually, stat+skill does _not_ equal "heroic".  Gurps is one
of the more realistic games and it uses stat+skill.

moment, but I think the ship in RS is too big
to be the same one. However, if it follows the 
same principle, the cylindrical section is a
standardized, detatchable, and interchangeable
fuel tank/cargo pod.

It seems high that you need higher Int to get into a Tech school than a Med

Marc, I\'ll second Doug\'s request.  I\'d *really* like to see Medical
*officially* become a cascade.  I already do it like this with 4 skills
cascading as follows:

 Medical
    First Aid - the skill of EMT\'s and trauma care specialists
    Diagnosis - the skill of figuring out what\'s wrong
    Surgery - the skill of cut and paste
    Pharmacy - the skill of preparing and administering drugs

I\'ve got a copy of Word 6.0, and I think it can read the Word 95
format..isn\'t that what Marc has the draft in?

Anyway, I\'d like a copy too.

What I like with this isn\'t the higher skill levels, its the ability to
get more skills.  My SF visions have always been of characters with a

I have finally found another group to play Traveller with (we\'re playing
MegaTraveller - all the other ones pale in comparison (I guess I just
expressed my opinion on the GTB)).  Interesting that you mention that since
my first group (a long time ago in another city) said exactly the same
thing.  I have decided to make it differently this time.

If you read the story found at page 55 of the book, I have decided to make
the room with the buttresses at the eigth corners a different room than the
rest of the building.  I have decided that the original crew, by putting
down the fusion heater (again page 55), caused the floor to collapse and the
rooms below to appear.  As to the bones and the altar, I believe they might
have been left by Droynes that were not in the base when the war ended and
simply died away.  the bones are those of the human servants who have since
gone instinct.  As to the Droynes, they either left or simply vanished
without a trace.  What do you think?

Sorry, Somin, but I think you\'re wrong.  The main thing is your players go

Uh, yuck!  Exponential range bands may be OK for a quick&dirty system, but I
prefer something with actual distances for gaming out a situation.  As soon
as Azhanti High Lightning came out I dropped the CT range bands and never
looked back.  

In fact, range bands are one reason why I haven\'t converted to T4 rules yet. 
Is there a way of finding the effective/long/extreme ranges of the weapons in
Emperor\'s Arsenal?  I dislike the granular range-band system for T4, but
can\'t use these weapons with MT/TNE rules (my current house system for
combat).

could work something like this.

Take the Attribute*DM involved and then add

The result would be a number that would have

I haven\'t calculated any #\'s (anyone up for
this?) but a difficulty scale could go
something like this.

Difficult		1

Impossible	.25

I will point out that this system becomes
VERY difficult VERY fast.  I won\'t pretend
its the best system but it couldn\'t hurt to

    'body' => '	Just ran the third session of my latest campaign, titled Traveller:
Beyond The Pale.  Here\'s the post-game summary:

The Cast:

Amr Santayema: a young and clever merchant, played by the TML\'s own Ross
Coburn, who after long experience in my campaigns, has decided that his
character is not leaving the ship come hell or high water.

Lt Kehaaarl: An Aslan ex-marine.  Visualize Catbert, Evil H.R. Director, on
steroids and bad acid with a big gauss rifle:
<purrrBANGpurrrBANGpurrrrBANG...>.

Sir Loreni Vilash: Vilani merchant from a poor family whose trading acumen
led him to a knighthood.

Dame Iliana Berek\'san: a prominent chanteuse; tall, pale, beautiful,
dressed in the cutting edge of Sylean fashion, with a blue & purple topknot
reaching down to her knees, coloured contacts, and a Famille Spofulam
Fashion Accessories designer laser pistol to match, who\'s slumming it in
the company of...

...Perlis Dalal: a muscular female ex-scout.  Played by the TML\'s Glenn Grant.

They\'re joined this week by:

Elo Lezaar, a highly geeky Vilani ex-Navy sensors and electronics tech,
who\'s Dame Iliana\'s stage manager.  He mumbles, collects meditation rugs
and keeps bees, and is played by Sebastien Normandin, who will be joining
the list shortly.

	This bunch of intrepid adventurers is presently assembled, along
with a growingly large number of fellow fortune-seekers, on Mishegaan III,
an LSP mining colony, waiting for an Imperial interdict to lift on a nearby
cluster of main-sequence stars.  In the first game session they
incorporated Quintana Speculative Ventures LIC and bought all three Jump-3
ships on the planet; last session they went on a fruitless chase after some
revolutionaries who stole their cargo of Fusion+ generators from a
spaceport warehouse.  Upon their return to the spaceport, the investigation
having been taken over by Ling\'s security forces, they recieved a call from
Liontzel Huutzaa, their lawyer and Ling\'s CLO. He informed them that Ling
had just lost contact with the security detachment sent out to chase the
revolutionaries, a hefty percentage of their total forces on-planet.
Huutzaa informed them that he was to be moving on-board as things were
looking dicey in the colony.

This week:

	Hanging around the spaceport concourse after seeing Dame Iliana\'s
concert gear offloaded from a shuttle, Elo witnessed the rest of the
party\'s return, their ship (the Locust-class Frontier Trader, which Ross
still hasn\'t posted.  He should; it\'s a great design: J3, 300 td, armed and
profitable) scarred by a SAM hit on the port bows.  They disembarked,
discussing their plans and the preceding events in great detail, much to
the interest of passerby in the crowded concourse (rumour mills kicked into
high gear, but they didn\'t see this happening).  Elo joined up with the
group and was introduced more-or-less by Dame Iliana.  Fortunately for the
group, before they could finish discussing the chase after the
revolutionaries and their business plans in public in great detail, and
move on to discussing their no doubt highly colourful sexual preferences,
Huutzaa and his luggage showed up and convinced them to continue the
converstation in private, on board ship.

	Discussion in the lounge on board the Locust-class eventually
turned to the group\'s choice of ship.  They decided to hold a shareholder\'s
meeting.  Much bickering and discussion ensued, which, summarized, involved
deciding to keep the Recollet-class Exploratory Trader (FSY\'s last THUDDD
entry) and selling the Locust and Lalemant-class vessels.  After
discovering that "Recollet" was a word from the Terran language French,
they decided that a French name would be a good thing and settled on
"Versailles" (ghod only knows why) after a cursory language database search
(I tried to steer them towards calling it the "Poodle", after the dreaded
breed of fierce war-dogs, but they didn\'t bite).  Crew details were bashed
out.  Huutzaa then left, to discuss the purchase of the Lalemant-class ship
with the captain of the bombed-out Far Trader (Huutzaa had taken advantage
of his position to expedite his insurance settlement under the Imperial
MegaCorporate Insurance Claims Settlement Mutual Assistance Agreement; he
also rushed through Sir Loreni\'s claim <since Sir Loreni hadn\'t filed it
yet, this was somewhat irregular>).

	After a long and trying day, they then all tucked in for the night.

	The next morning began with everyone shifting personal effects on
board the Versailles.  Dame Iliana took charge of selecting the interior
decor, and had her manager look into the possibility of staging a concert
locally, that evening.  She then recieved a call from the secretary to
Vought Hendaar, Ling\'s colony chief XO, inviting her to dinner.  She
accepted, and proposed an additional meeting earlier that afternoon, to
discuss the possibility of a concert.

	Sir Loreni concluded the sale of the Lalemant-class vessel to the
captain of the blown-up Far Trader, making a healthy 12% profit.

	Elo began his day with a diagnostic inspection of the Locust-class;
it proved to be in good health, so he moved on to repairing the missile
impact dent on its bows with some TL-12 BondHex Multipurpose Starship Body
Filler.  He then went to inspect the Lalemant.  This ship was in much worse
condition, not having recieved annual maintenance for several years, so he
began to see what he could do about tuning it up so that its purchasers
wouldn\'t be too upset.

	Meanwhile, Lt. Kehaarl, having moved on-board, recieved a comm call
from Huutzaa, asking him to do some bodyguard work overseeing the loading
of some sensitive cargo that he wanted moved from Ling\'s administrative
offices to the ship for safe-keeping in the event of a revolution.  Kehaarl
agreed, and shortly thereafter Perlis recieved a similar call.

	Kehaarl, not being a stupid little Aslan Death Machine, then
informed Sir Loreni of this; Sir Loreni called Huutzaa, who asked him to
meet with him and Perlis and Kehaarl at the entrace to the tunnel
connecting the spaceport to the colony, as it was too sensitive to discuss
over a comm link.

	Perlis, Kehaarl, and Sir Loreni met Huutzaa at the tunnel entry.
In response to Sir Loreni\'s inquiry as to the nature of the cargo, Huutzaa
informed him that it was some administrative records and the colony\'s cash
reserves, which he wanted stored somewhere the authors of the imminent
insurgency couldn\'t get their hands on.  He was convinced that a revolution
was imminent; the remnants of LSP\'s security forces were hard pressed to
guard both the worker\'s dormitories (all miners were confined to quarters,
but a large number were still unaccounted-for) and the minehead.
Therefore, he wanted the colony\'s books and cash reserves secretly removed
to the ship where they could be whisked away in case of revolution.

	Sir Loreni, smelling a large rat at the vocal insistence of several
players whose characters were not even present, insisted that the material
be given to the spaceport authorities for safe-keeping.  Huutzaa
acquiesced.  Sir Loreni thus mollified, Huutzaa then proceeded to drive
Perlis and Kehaarl into the Ling colony.  Taking a side maintenance
passage, they entered the huge, stadium-sized minehead and took a cargo
elevator to the bottom, where they found that many of Ling\'s remaining
security personnel were entrenched protecting the various elevators and
such.  Huutzaa spoke to the officer in charge, who let them drive through
the security cordon.  After driving through various mine corridors, they
came to a cleverly concealed passage connecting to the colony\'s massive
main ventilation shaft; riding up a maintenance elevator nearly to the top
of the shaft, they entered a side duct, which proved to lead over the
colony\'s administrative sector.

	Stopping at one floor vent grill in particular, they met up with
two individuals in Ling uniforms, who placed a ladder underneath the vent.
Descending, they realized that they were in the front room to Ling\'s main
vault.  While his flunkies installed a ceiling hook and chain hoist in the
vent, and wheeled a dolly into the room, Huutzaa opened the vault, with
Perlis and Kehaarl  standing guard.  The inveitable happened while the
dolly was being loaded up, and an explosion, gunfire, and screams were
heard nearby... at which point, being an evil GM, I cut to Dame Iliana.

	Dame Iliana was picked up on time by a grav limo, and was driven up
to Hendaar\'s quarters up on the uppermost level of the colony.  Waiting for
Hendaar to arrive, she enjoyed the view out over the spaceport and crater
floor (the colony, if you recall, being built right into a large crater
wall overlooking the spaceport.  Hendaar arrived shortly thereafter,
looking like everyone\'s nice old fascist grandfather; greetings took place,
and Dame Iliana broached the topic of her throwing a concert in the colony.
As Hendaar was waxing rhapsodic over the idea of fleets of starships taking
flight into the unknown, to boldy exploit where no man has exploited
before, to the tune of heroic arias to the glory of the Imperium, a large
explosion took place at the main entrance to his quarters, blowing debris
into the living room.

	It being late, we called the game there.  We\'ll be playing again in
two weeks.  Will Perlis and Kehaarl save the colony\'s cash reserve?  Will
Dame Iliana escape the hordes of rampaging disgruntled Rye-Ben miners?
Will Amr and Sir Loreni space the lawyer?  Tune in next time!

	Dunno whether you\'ve heard about it, but there\'s this game out for
the Mac and PC called TacOps.  It\'s written by an retired USMC Major.  It\'s
basically a modern-day tactical combat simulator.  The graphics are
rudimentary; they could probably have been implemented on a mid-80\'s Mac no
sweat.  The game engine is viciously, brutally good.  Chillingly so.

	It\'s made me dead certain that not going into the army was a good
thing.  If this is anything near realistic, a ground war in Europe would
have been a bloody nightmare...

	It\'s also made me regret that it\'s not mroe modular; player-defined
units would have been cool... gaming a TL-7 OpFor BTR regiment going up
against a platoon in BD would be interesting :).

	But anyhow, I\'d strongly recommend taking a look at TacOps if
you\'re into that sort of game.

   Absolutely.  If we wanted to, we could be up at Mars right now
raising the atmospheric pressure, and starting up a nice colony.  Of
course all that would take many years and cost about as much as the
Gross Domestic Product of several larger European countries for a year,
but hey!  It\'s where you want to spend the money...

   In the CT Solomani Rim supplement, there\'s mention of a world,
Hephaistos, where there was "one of the few completed terraforming
projects in the Imperium".  The impression you get is that global
terraforming is not something outside the capability of the TL 15 Third
Imperium, it was just something that wasn\'t done on a regular basis.

   Truth is, the scientists don\'t know *what* pumping a bunch of extra
greenhouse gases (CO2 being the primary) will do to the ecosystem. 
There are indeed models that point to the possibility of massive coastal
flooding and palm trees in New York City, *but* there is also the real
possibility that nothing much will happen at all, and that the ecosystem
will find a way to absorb the greenhouses gases faster.  It could also
be that Earth has been warming all on its own for a couple hundred years
and will get warmer no matter what we do.

   Don\'t get me wrong, screwing with the ecosystem too much is a *bad*
thing because of the uncertainty of it all, not because of any specific
threat of global warming.

   Sorry for the commentary.  Back on topic...

   My impression of the Solomani Confederation is that while there are
worlds and groups of star systems within it that are "free", overall the
State is Big Brother, closely monitoring those it considers a threat,
and keeping an eye on everyone else just in case.  True enough, the
Solomani people don\'t think of it as an oppressive regime, but then they
consider all the security checks and I.D. stuff to be part of normal
life.  Also, the central government is *very* careful to maintain the
veneer of a free, open society, taking strong measures in public for
reasons of "state security", and in private to maintain their control. 
"Dr. Carter was arrested yesterday for treason against the Solomani
people" or maybe Dr. Carter has an unfortunate grav car "accident" or
doesn\'t return from vacation.  The public suspects nothing, but the
truth has all the hallmarks of a totalitarian regime.

   The US was not particularly oppressive in the 1950s, though I\'m sure
Hollywood has given you a different impression.  Were certain people
monitored secretly because of their activities (most of which were
perfectly innocent)?  Certainly.  But overall people here experienced
freedom, certainly more freedom than they are now in a lot of respects. 
If you want to draw parallels between the Solomani Confederation and an
ancient Earth culture, a better comparison would be with the people who
used red stars on their vehicles, not white (come to think of it, they
used red practically everywhere, even on their flag).  Called themselves
"People\'s Republic" and stuff like that...

   That explains why I keep seeing the Starship Enterprise (tm) in
certain sections of Traveller illustrations.  It\'s kind of subtle, I
think it was using a captured Romulan cloaking device.

   I\'m familar with what DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook says.  I\'m also
certain that no one intended for upper limit for any world\'s technology
to exceed TL 16 (the highest TL within the Imperium, if you exclude the
Sabmiqys of course)--if for no other reason than it throws game balance
out the window.

   Wrong.  Past canon is that the RoM had TL 12, and that WBH presents a
system that allows you to create a more detailed tech levels for worlds
of the Third Imperium.

   In matters of canon, GDW material always takes precedence over DGP
material when there is a contradiction.

   Or maybe those who are trying to rationalize what is a pretty
obvious, but easily explained bit of errata ("the vacc suits were in
fact TL 13 not TL 14 as stated") should spend less time dancing an Irish
jig and more time helping Marc Miller (and those providing him with
canon material that *fits* the existing storyline) fix what\'s wrong with
T4.

   There were probably Vilani worlds that managed to upgrade to TL 12
standards without having to resort to importing Terran stuff to the
point that it shut down local factories, but you\'re probably right--many
industrial worlds in former Vilani territory looked like an old East
German factory town after reunification (or Cleveland c.1978 for those
of us in the US) after a few decades of Terran "marketing" and
"assistance".

   TL 13 artifact equipment (especially if you could find working
examples) would be of tremendous value to the Syleans.  Think of all the
technological deadends they could avoid.  I\'m rather suprised that it
would take the Third Imperium some 450 years to progress from TL 12 to
13, so there must not have been all that much of it that survived.

   I\'m afraid not.  The essay in MT\'s Referee\'s Companion on Robotics
was pretty clear that robotics in the RoM didn\'t progress beyond TL 12. 
And as for genetic and medical technology, well you should be able to do
some pretty advanced stuff at TL 12.  

   That of course shouldn\'t stop myths and legends from developing about
ultra advanced RoM technology (sort of like the urban legends about 100
mile per gallon/kilometer per liter carburetors, U.S. Air Force aircraft
that look and perform like flying saucers, etc.).  I would have no
problem with that, so long as those myths and legends didn\'t turn out to
be real (well game real anyway).

If it can, please make a copy (and Marc, please let him) in a different

Marc, (and others),

Check our Eris\' generic task format, derived from both this and Marc\'s
original T4 task layout.  It works the same, but, IMHO in a more elegant
fashion as opposed to the \'more difficult, much more difficult\', etc.

Well, I love it personally, and would like to see it adapted.  The use
of +, ++, etc. lets more be in the description in a less verbose
fashion, plus it cincludes, time, the situation, the information etc.
needed for all task systems.  The next step is for the task systems

I definitely support this!  It gives people the chance to choose their
task system, to choose how to calculate additions and subtractions due
to difficulty (i.e.. DMs or Level increases\\decreases).  Also, it
includes time, which is definitely a major thing needed in the task
system.

I think I disagree with this Paul.  First, I think you can assume that
even a first-time referee (never played an RPG in his/her life) should
be able to remember a one-line formula to figure out target numbers for
the task system (i.e.. stat+skill, stat+3*skill, stat\\5+skill, etc.). 
Also, they could have target numbers worked out before game too if they
figured remembering a one line formula was too much.  Even the simplest
of RPGs require some memorization of something.

Secondly, as the variants, they\'re completely Ref dependent.  If the Ref
can\'t remember or understand the variant rule...don\'t use it!  Most
games will not undergo a task system change mid campaign, or mid
adventure so all that is needed to remember is the one formula to task
creation.

The last part of the task layout (see above) may cause confusion, as to
the amount of adjustment (positive or negative) to apply to the task
roll.  However, I think it can be assumed that a Referee should have
some degree of skill in this kind of area, relative difficulties, and
most will catch on after a while.  If you think back to your first games
of RPGs they didn\'t exactly go off perfectly, you and your players have
got to expect some difficulties.

Also, i don\'t think it\'s too much to ask that the new Traveller does
cater to (not saying be subservient too) the older generation of
Traveller players, who want the ability to modify the rules.  After all,
most RPGs say \'change the rules if you want\', so therefore there should
be some way to change the rules to your liking without destroying your
ability to easily use published materials.

Anyhow, that\'s all just my opinion, feel free to tear it apart.

   As stated elsewhere, I have no problem with rumors and myths
surrounding the true TL of the RoM, particularly in the M:0 Third
Imperium, where it isn\'t even certain yet that Terra is the homeworld of
all of humanity.  Sending the PCs chasing off after some supposed piece
of TL 17 RoM equipment, only to get their ship and themselves shot up in
the process, would make a cool M:0 scenario.  But we need to make sure
that rumor and myth don\'t get confused for fact (OK, in the end it
wasn\'t TL 17 equipment, it was only TL 13--but didn\'t you have fun
tracking it down?  Why are you looking at me like that?  It\'s only
paper...).  This is not AD&D, it\'s Traveller.

30000 km range bands/hexes are great. Unfortunately, when we were putting
together FFS2/TTA, with only vague notes on a combat system, we were pretty
much told to use 5000/50000/500000/5000000 km range bands; so FFS2/TTA
sensors are all based around that (tweaked a little to allow intermediate
range bands - you can buy a 50000km sensor, or a 160000km, or 500000 km, etc.)
and weapons designers are encouraged to rate weapons at 50000/500000km only.
If T4.1 space combat is going to use 30000km hexes rather than the log scale
of range bands - which I personally would think is good (using 30000km, that
is) - much of TTA is wrong and needs to be fixed. This is one of the perils
of doing the design system before the combat system, which various people 
tried to warn IG of...

      Ah yes, good call.  *But*, that could easily be explained as stuff
they got from the weapons labs of the Darrians.  Since the Imperium and
the Darrians were allies, it is only natural that the Darrians would
hand over a few prototypes every so often so that the Imperial naval
types could tinker with them.  How would you like to be the Imperial
logistics officer who had to explain to the admiral *and* to the tech
rep from the Darrians why it is you sent critical components of an
experimental weapon to a testing facility that\'s now in a war zone...not
exactly good for career advancement.

So it was Doug that originally put forward this request, not Eris.
Well, count me in.  Since Medical is used almost as frequently as
combat skills, it deserves to /cascade/ as well.

It really brings a tear to your eye if you\'re a Canadian-- or a

   To rationalize this interesting tidbit as well as others mentioned in
   this adventure, I posited that the Octagon Society was actually a
   front for the 62nd-century equivalent of a UFO cult.  The founder had
   stumbled across an ancient site while he was stranded on Beck\'s World,
   and used its facilities to survive there for so long.  He gave himself
   up to be rescued after he got locked out of the ancient octagon on
   Beck\'s World, and then founded a front to help finance his search for
   more ancient sites in the Marches.  He and his wacko followers
   worshiped the ancients as gods, and when they found a new site, they
   would plead to them to readmit them to their dwellings.  Sometimes
   their pleas took the form of human sacrifices.  They never
   successfully entered the site at Twilight\'s Peak; that honor was to
   fall later to the crew of the Gyro Cadiz.  Eventually, the massive
   diversion of funds to their archeology, and other abuses as well, led
   to the scandals which ultimately destroyed the Society. (IIRC, this
   occured around the same time as the psionics suppressions. ;)
   
   Other rationalizations are possible and encouraged, but the hints in
   the adventure make certain that there is some link between the Octagon
   Society and the ancients.  As usual with CT products (Shadows, Annic
   Nova), the referee and players are left to wonder at the implications
   of the adventure they just completed.  Further details are left to the
   imaginative referee, or are left as enigmas in an increasingly
   mysterious universe.
   
   Have fun with Twilight\'s Peak; it may just be the greatest
   RPG adventure ever made.

More specifically, "the Stat-12 Med-1 character will be better than
the Stat-8 Med-4 character *only* while performing tasks that can be
covered using Med-1.  He should not be able to perform any task
requiring Med-2+ (if he could, he\'d have the experience or training to
do so, and this would reflect as a higher skill rating)".

Here you are making comparisons between two different skills.  IMNSHO,
Med-x covers too much, since there are simply some skills that nurses
and paramedics are better at than doctors (based on what type of work
they *normally* perform).  I believe someone out there has already
raised the point that Med should /cascade/ again, but I forget who
(Eris?).

I don\'t think it was a waste of bandwidth, although perhaps it should
have gone under a different Subject header, like "EDU covers too many
skills".  Listing every EDU-related skill like Dave did has a far
greater impact on *this* T4 problem than simply stating "and 36 more
EDU skills".

Unless T4 adopts a play-balanced character generation system, the
referee is the only one that can prevent munchkins from abusing the
rules (FFFFF1 JoT-10).  Although I greatly prefer a play-balanced
character generation system, Traveller\'s past history will probably
make such a system highly unlikely for T4.1 or future versions.

(Un)fortunately, GURPS is based *heavily* on play-balance.  It
permeates both the character generation and experience point reward
system.  It is a better system than HERO, however ("what do you mean I
can\'t buy a sword until I\'ve obtained enough XPs?").

   And let me guess, the Rule of Man Navy ran around in these huge wedge
shaped ships, and the soldiers wore white combat armor, and the Emperor
(there was more than one of course, but that doesn\'t matter, afterall
you don\'t have to use it in your campaign) was this really nasty guy
that wore robes all the time, and he had this hatchet man (well actually
he carried a sword, but I digress) that wears a portable ventilator and
this really cool helmet.  All was well until this farm boy, who really
turned out to be the son of a noble, helped to cause the Second
Imperium\'s downfall.  He did this by getting together with a bunch of
co-conspirators and they blew up this moon, no two moons! and in the
process they killed the Emperor and the guy in the really cool helmet. 
Now, The ironic part is, see, that the farm boy who really turned out to
be the son of a noble had a crush on this cute princess with bad hair,
who is really his twin sister!  Say, this is *great* stuff!  And to make
it even *more* ironic, both the farm boy and the princess turn out to be
the offspring of the guy in the really cool helmet!  Truly classic
stuff, I wonder why no one had thought of it before?

   Seriously, nice variant Leroy.  Not canon of course, but a good try.

   TL 16 indeed!!!

www.urbanlegends.com (great site, by the way) and checked out this
supposed transcript thing.  It was not in the FAQ, except for a reference
in a book review, but the book was published in 1993 and mentions the
lighthouse story, so I think that pretty much proves the transcript is
bogus.  The book it self, _Corporate Legends and Lore_ by Peg C.
Newhauser, sounds pretty interesting - I\'m going to have to get myself a
copy.

  I then went to Deja News, and found a number of recent postings on the
topic.  Consensus is the story is an urban legend, with at least one
reference to a joke collection published in 1992, and undated references
to various naval publications where it was published as humor.  The same
transcript has been published before with different ship names and
different lighthouse locations.  

  The documentation was not complete (I decided not to spend a great deal
of time looking), but passing references seem to indicate that the story
may have its origins in the American Navy battlegroup that ran aground
near a lighthouse on the California coast in the 1920s due to fog and
navigational errors at night. One important note - the battlegroup was
observing _radio silence_ at the time - wonderful how urban legands grow
and are propigated. 

  In any case, I think we can safely assume that the transcript is not
authentic, and that the whole story is an urban legend.

Gasp!  Choke!

I\'m not certain whether or not an order of magnitude difference between
ranges makes sense for everything, but I _know_ that different weapons (and
sensor and communications) systems will have different depths to their range
bands.  OK, maybe a quick-and-dirty combat system would have these ranges (in
fact, it might not be a bad idea), but to force the equipment designer to use
them limits all future combat systems.  This is a Bad Thing.

I _hope_ it isn\'t too late to change this.  Even if the basic ship combat
system is already set, at least the design system can be fixed so that
incremental differences between weapons/sensors/communications are reflected.
I know they were there in FFS, so they won\'t have to be reinvented.  After
all, FFS2 is supposed to be the _detailed_ design system, isn\'t it?  It
shouldn\'t have to be replaced when a more detailed combat system comes along.

Now how do you build TL16 robots without TL16 computers, batteries 
(or micro-fusion recators), materials technolgy, gravitcs & 
machanics? (among other things). With this sort of technology around 
in the RoM the whole future history would have to be revised, because 
even a few relics would stuff up canon even more than TL14 Vacc-Suits 
will.

I\'m not too sure how you\'d get solid protection for the hips, but 
complete rigid armour for the head and neck, without great weight and 
complexity is availible at TL2, just take a loot at some of the late 
medieval plate armour (and admire the chainmail boxer-shorts :)

I realise that making a Vacc-Suit doesn\'t directly need Fusion Plus, 
but it does require such a large range of technologies that making a 
TL13 (let alone a TL14) Vacc-Suit would nessesitate a very broad 
range of TL12 technolgies to work from.

I\'ve come to the conclusion that Vacc-Suits are a very bad high tech 
relic (is there a good one?) to be handing out. They have such a lot 
of very sophistocated tech in them. A quality TL14 suit is going to 
be made of some awesome material (it has no effective encumberance), 
have a TL14 Hand computer, TL14 batteries, TL14 air tanks (they give 
twice the air per unit volume of TL12 tanks), somewhere there\'s bound 
to be a Homopolar generator (for say a small laser rangefinder or an 
emergency beacon) - which has clear military applications. I shudder 
to think of the effects of half a dozen of these in a government or 
mega-corps\' lab.

I agree with you here, I just think that a Vacc-Suit represents a 
very wide range of technologies.

I like your line of thought, but I don\'t think it applies to the 
Terran Confederation/RoM and Fusion Plus. The Confederation grew out 
of a modern Earth similar to ours, and one of the key areas of 
interest today is minaturization and volume efficiency (to the point 
where we now have cellphones with keypads _just_ big enough for 
average sized fingers - not my slightly wider than average ones). I 
can\'t see a society like this missing out on such an important piece 
of minaturization technology.

IIRC there was a comment by someone from GDW in a late Challenge to 
the effect that the TL needed for AI kept rising overtime, so that it 
was always just beyond the Imperium\'s reach. I note that the TL12 
Terrans used robots that were called intelligent (but are now assumed 
to be expert systems), but all the TL charts place that at TL17. I 
get the impression that the comment about the RoMs robots was felt to 
be a mistake, and they were down-rated. Mind you if you use Vampire 
Fleets even a non-virus TL12 robot brain can be quite skilled and 
clever.

	WHOA! The equipment designer is NOT forced to use them. You\'re told how to
rate a weapon at any given range, and then told "Table XX lists the
standard Traveller ranges." So if you want to rate your weapon\'s
performance at the TNE SR/2*SR/4*SR/8*SR ranges, you\'re free to do so, and
have the information necessary.

	Thanks :).  However, I can\'t take credit for the purring bit; that
was the idea of Jason Jones, the guy who\'s playing Lt. Kehaaarl.  During
the second game session, after Kehaaarl started blasting away at the
Mishegaan United Worker\'s Anti-Suppression Front with the ship\'s laser, I
was describing the whine of huge capacitors charging up to fire the
laser... and then Jason interjected with "... and you hear constant purring
from inside the turret".

	That was one of those high-point-of-the-campaign, everybody cracks
up kinda comments :).

I don\'t have TD8 but I have TD10.  Yes, it includes data on Core:

1. World map of Capital.

2. The feature adventure is set on Reference/Cadion/Core 0140 D100100-B,
   formerly called Mamatava, and includes First Survey data - the above
   UWP applies directly!  It was renamed at the time of the Second Grand
   Survey, so should be Mamatava in M0.  No system info.

3. Library Data for Core sector.  Of possible interest:
   Bellham/Dunea 1838 D989620-7: "the TL of Bellham has been steadily
     decreasing since it was first catalogued".
   Bogustin/Cemplas 1323 A3105AC-F: Heavily colonised in 958; nothing
     about what was there before.
   Gandar/Ch\'naar 1633 B300666-D: Moon of only gas giant, colonised by
     Salo Merchant Line of Zimmel/Dunea 1733.
   Hiilev/Ch\'naar 1635 C62757B-A: colonised first "early in 1st
     Imperium", descendants fought newcomers arriving after 420.
   Okefir/Ch\'naar 1035 B581666-A and Vala/Ch\'naar 1034 C553762-6: owned
     by Aursis since colonisation in 57.

4. Subsector listings for Cadion and Chant subsectors (M & K).

That\'s enough typing for now - if you need more (like UWPs or presence
of gas giants for the subsectors) let me know.

Just reading through the chronology of the Imperium in the MT
Encyclopedia last night, and something occured to me, that I\'m not sure
has been discussed.  Where will Milieu 0 end?  That is, what time in
Imperial history will it go up to?  

The best possibiltiy, I thought was up to 420, as that is when the First
Survey was completed.  Thus, all of the systems in First Survey will
have been conquered by the Imperium.

Also, is it still a plan of IG to do the M200 next?  Personally, I don\'t
think this Milieu is truly needed, being still to close to M0 an I\'d
rather see either the Interstellar Wars Era (M -2235, or 2283AD?) or
perhaps the M1100 setting revisited again.

Any ideas?

	Where (if at all)in T4 does it call out the rules for repairing spacecraft
battle damage?  (My players have just gotten into a scrape with a couple of
planetary fighters and set down/crash landed on a glacier.  They are trying
to figure out how to fix the damage to their drives and sensor arrays so
they can get the hell out of their before the locals show up again.)

I can\'t seem to find any reference to it, but I might simply be looking in
the wrong place. If it isn\'t included, is the a de facto system that
everyone seems to be using?  I have considered adopting the TNE rules into
the T4 system, but this would take a fair amount of revision.

Any help would be appreciated.

Anyway, I remember sending Marc mail about this a few months ago when it
was announced that the new hardcover would be coming out.

I figured hey, include both the MT and the T4 task systems and let
players choose which one they want.  Both systems center around a
word-based task description.  Both have similar levels and can use the
same language (simple, difficult, impossible, etc...).  So hell, take up
the extra two or three pages, describe the pros and cons of each system,
describe each system and be done with it.

No, I\'m not vascillating, but the simple truth is that this game has
gone through four revisions in the past 20 years.  Fact is that there
are too many factions with their own preferences.  Hell, and I remember
people saying that The Rebellion wasn\'t feasible because everyone would
line up behind the obvious choice.  8)

We can look to redesign or tweak the wheel one more time, but that will
still gain us nothing.  I\'m sorry, but I\'m getting the impression that
people don\'t want a breakthrough system, they want Traveller (uhm,
sorry, that didn\'t come out as I intended, but you all know what I
mean).

If T4 is suppossed to be the game where we\'re innovative and have
learned over time, then give the people what they want.  Fact is that
some of us probably were waiting for some type of rehash of CT, and some
for a rehash of MT.  Fact is that new players will choose whatever
mechanics they desire.

Don\'t believe me?  Remember, it only took three days after the release
of T4 until I saw MT task for T4 on this list.  And then it only took 10
minutes until I saw someone calling the poster a crack-smoker for
wanting a MT system instead of the CT/T4 system.

Is it really going to be any different this time around?

I think I have been pretty clear about why I have not posted the quotes.
For one, to cross-integrate other relevant quotes, takes some time (the
proper way to do research).  But, tell you what.  Harold has opened up
only part of some relevant info, and I am going to get to that next.  See
my next post.

As for being busy with tests, etc., I am.  I aced the one last night, but
I am only through one of four more (one is the second one in a week for
the same class!)  Rather than being perturbed, you should be complimented
that I am so addicted to following this, and you all have provided some
very interesting viewpoints.

Harold, if you are going to "quote sources", you should at least tell
everybody the _WHOLE_ story, not just what you want to see. That is the
most out of context quote I have ever seen.

FroM, CT AM6 Solomani, p.21, CT Sup10 Solomani Rim, p.38:

   "Hephaistos is one of the few terraforming projects completed
   by the Imperium. Begun during the Interstellar Wars, the
   project was alternately abandoned and resumed several times."

The lines that follow do, as you suggest, allude to the _fact_ that
is somewhat out of the Imperium\'s reach to do terraforming--no surprise
since they are only TL15/16!

  Further, according to the MT Referee\'s Companion, pg.28, the required
tech to do Terraforming (worlds less than 800 Km) is 17, (worlds to
4000 Km) is 18, and (any sized world) is 19. Complex Terraforming is
at TL 15, and Global Terraforming is at 16.  Which ever version you
want to go with, the TC (pre-RoM) was TL 15+!!!!!!!!

  I\'ll admit that the MT Tech Table references are a little hard to
swallow, especially if you don\'t want to believe this. :)

	The FS Jump Ship is a mere 5000-ton design and can haul around up to 
5000 tons of cargo, in a "jump mesh" (I\'d imagine a superdense metal 
webbing with lathanum core to extend jump field over the cargo). The 
following pods are available: Cargo pod, 1000 tons; Passenger pod, 
(no mention of tonnage, holds 225 staterooms); Low pod (the same, 
1900 low berths).

    This depends on what the uplifting was for.  If you were messing around
with their brains to increase the gray/white ratio that\'s one thing.  If you
were fiddling around in there to allow them to use cybernetics and/or allow for
language centers more like those in humans... that\'s a completely different
story.

    Let\'s keep one thing in mind here, Dolphins live in a VASTLY different
environment then Humans do.  And Humans have a definate bias towards tool users
with oral languages.  Dolphins don\'t need tools in their environment and they
do use elements of language that we can identify.  But all lot of that signal
we don\'t have a clue as to what it\'s for and Dolphins really don\'t need to
worry about objectifying the world around them like Humans do.
    All this means that Dolphins could quite well have a complex and
distinctive culture we simply can not plug into because it\'s so radically
different we can\'t comprehend it.  They very well could be sentient already and
we just haven\'t stepped out of our very focused and narrow view point of
sentience to realize that yet.

    And to help yank this back to Traveller...  Any ideas on how to make truly
Alien aliens?  The kind that are incomprehensable because they and humans share
almost no common frames of reference?

	Just because there are a variety of mechanics already extant, or people do
things this way, or that way, is no reason NOT to strive to have the best
system possible in the new version. "Good Enough" is the enemy of excellence.

	And why do I want a good system? After all, I\'ve got CT, MT, TNE, T4 and
my own ideas, so I can brew my own.

	Because I want help keep Traveller alive by seeing if my FLGS will let me
run a demo to attract new players. I cannot, in good conscience, run a demo
using a "house system" just because I don\'t like the one in the book--I\'ve
got to use what I\'m trying to push. But if I can\'t stomach the one in the
book, I can\'t in good conscience try to convince somebody ELSE it\'s a good
system.

	And despite the ongoing arguments I\'m involved in elsewhere, the current
stat+skill system, with stats and skills on different scales, doesn\'t work
without a bunch of arbitrary restrictions on attempting tasks at low skills.

	That was the whole idea of a task system in the first place! Simplify
things so you can describe _anything_ and let _anybody_ roll against it. If
you\'ve got the right skills, you\'ve got a good chance of succeeding. If
you\'ve got high attributes, you might be able to pull it out. If you\'ve got
neither, there comes a point where you don\'t succeed.

	But a "Difficult" task should be the same for everybody. If you\'ve got
"Difficult, min Skill A-3 or Skill B-2, or EDU+INT>9 and Int>6, or
Day=Tuesday," sure, maybe it covers special cases better. But it\'s a lot
less fun & easy to play.

	I disagree. There\'s nothing in the structure of reality or the laws of
physics that will prevent him from attempting it if the situation is right,
or if he\'s desperate enough. He\'s got a little knowledge of anatomy,
probably knows the theory of what\'s done in open heart surgery (crack the
rib cage, remove a section of vein from the leg, cut out the block section
of heart artery or vein, splice in the leg vein, close). Maybe he\'s
observed one during orientation. His got little chance of success, but I\'d
grant him a tiny, teeny chance.

	So now we have to add to all tasks "Only for Skill-x and above," or we
have to go back and pull up the descriptions for each and every skill when
we use it to see what levels are and aren\'t allowed to do. And creating new
tasks means the referee not only has to decide how hard it is, but what
level you have to have to try at all. I\'d rather have that rolled into the
task difficulty itself. Obviously, a Formidable task is going to require a
higher skill to have a chance of succeeding than a simple task.

>I don\'t agree.  A person with Stat-12 Med-1 will be better at many
>things that a Stat-8 Med-4.  I\'ve seen this before.  A young

	Yes, a Stat-12 Med-1 will be better at SOME things than a Stat-8 Med-4.
But ON THE WHOLE, the Stat-8 Med-4 will be a better doctor. It\'s just
something that comes from trying to roll a wide body of knowledge into a
single skill. Perhaps we should throw out medical skill entirely, so we can
distinguish the fact that a thoracic surgeon will be better at open heart
surgery than a general practitioner with the same stat, and a
otolaryngologist can deal with a ruptured eardrum better than a podiatrist,
etc.

	It\'s just part of the abstraction you have to accept to play the game. I
cannot accept something that means a gifted beginner is better at
EVERYTHING than a skilled Joe Average, even though the beginner may be
better at a FEW things. Like it or not, Medical covers the entire gamut of
medical tasks. There are only a few of those where the Stat-12 Med-1 should
be better than the Stat-8 Med-4. But a straight addition results in the
Stat-12 being better at EVERYTHING unless you start making arbitrary
restrictions or special cases.

	Again, you can come up with reams of tasks and the minimum required skill
level if you want. I find it easier to use a system that provides,
built-in, a check on beginners outperforming experts.

>Well, I would rather have a talented nurse put an IV in me
>than untalented doctor.

	Again, you\'re the one who first raised the argument about trying to
shoehorn all kind of things into a single skill. Agreed, I\'d rather have a
talented nurse put an IV in than an untalented doctor. But medical skill
covers quite a bit more than just putting IVs in. I refuse to let a nurse
near my chest with a scalpel, no matter how intelligent/dexterous/educated.

	I don\'t want a system with multiple exceptions, special rules and
arbitrary distinctions to ensure that Stat-12 Skill-1 doesn\'t beat Stat-8
Skill-4 over the whole range of tasks. It may sacrifice a little bit that
the Stat-12 Skill-1 would be better at a FEW SPECIFIC TASKS than the Stat-8
Skill-4, but in general it ensures better balance. And the task system
certainly should be geared towards the whole range of possibilities,
because that\'s what it\'s going to be used for. Not just the special case
where a task happens to fall into the sub-subcategory of the skill that
earned the character the Skill-1.

	We\'re obviously not connecting here, because the more you support a
straight stat+skill AS IT EXISTS (with stats and skills on different
scales), the more I\'m convinced it doesn\'t work right. Now, if you bring
stats and skills onto the same scale (i.e. both 1-15, instead of 1-5/0-7)
so that a trained MD becomes around Skill-7 or -8, then I\'d have no problem
with it.

"I have in my hand here a document of containing evidence the
Darrians do not have sufficient technology to produce
disintegrators."
                                  RFXn


	Weapons labs? unlikely. Sticking to canon again:

	"The Yorin light tank is the highest tech level vehicle currently
produced by the Darrians. When equipment of higher tech levels is
required, they procure tech level 14 equipment from the Imperium, as
well as some occassional tech 15 gear."
				101 Vehicles, p.12

	A society producing only TL 13 ground vehicles is unlikely to
produce even experimental TL 17 weapons, let alone sell such
high-tech miracles to anyone, even friendly powers. The Darrians are
not particularly militaristic, and I don\'t see any reason why
Darrian ground transportation tech level would lag behind.

	Besides, a world\'s heavy military tech level is heavily based on
its Land Transportation tech level (World Builder\'s Handbook, p.86).
Although the TNE Regency Sourcebook features a TL 16 Darrian ship of
recent manufacture, 101 Vehicles is a much older source.

	Not pulling any punches, "The Darrian starship construction yards 
are capable of constructing [Solomani-influenced] tech 15 starships. 
Jump-6 capability is also possible, although ships are most often 
constructed with jump-3 or less". Also remember that "Top ships of 
the line are now imported from the Imperium (under an Imperial 
military aid program), and some technicians with them to 
maintain them." (Alien Module 8: Darrians)

	While "the Darrian Navy maintains two or three squadrons of tech 
level 16 warships of pre-Maghiz manufacture" (see above), it is even 
more unlikely that Darrians would give these precious artifacts for 
Imperium to study, since those ships are reserved for delivering the 
Star Trigger.

	I would much rather do that, than having to explain Lucan\'s MoJ 
_where_ the disintegrators _really_ came from, and why didn\'t we know 
about them sooner.

This is not how the TML works.  We don\'t play "I know something you don\'t

We state our sources, lay out our arguements, and *discuss* these things

This is really beginning to tick me off, since I own everything printed

anything else I have in a rather extensive collection of Traveller material.

All I can say, is that when I was playing with ship weapons, I calculated
their DV/PV\'s based on 30kkm hexes(10/20/40/80), not 5/50/500/5,000kkm
range bands. The numbers aren\'t tied to a specific scale, so you should be
able to scale them, as you please.

Might not be true for sensors, though.

Combat needs to be rewritten anyway, for at least clarity. Not from
scratch, but cleaned up. The haste of the t4.0 rulebook shows (and confuses
players).

Psionics doesn\'t use any task rolls anymore... and the T4 psionics are
totally portable. THey will work just as well in Mega or TNE as either
system\'s task mechanics will work with them: flawlessly. Matter of fact,
I\'m going to run an MT/T4 hybrid in the fall... using t4 psionics, MT-like
tasks (as posted), T4 skill acquisition rules on MT tables, MT combat. Just
for reference, though, the MT combat rules are just revised striker rules...

Space combat is almost task based; it needs a clean-up, too. Not a "from
scratch", but a removal of dice codes and substitution of task descriptors.

Ahh, but you forget:
	If Pen is less than 1/10 AV, damage is x0
	if Pen is less than  AV (and above 1/10) damage is x0.1
	if pen is less than 2x AV, and above  AV, damage is x0.5
These were cumulative with pinpoint accuracy damage bonuses. MT Pen and DMG
were NOT linked like they are in TNE or T4

So said gauss pistol (Pen 4 out to short range, pen 2 to long, it\'s max,
damage 3) is going to do little damage to AV 12 Cbt Armor (BD)... 0.3 dmg x
bonus for good hit. So, to get one mt die of damage, you needed to hit by
at least 4 (x4 dmg), giving a single MT dmg point. Said 1 point, after
combat, becomes 1 CT/T4 damage die. That said, the minimum damage from such
a sepctacular hit is 2 MT points... or 2d6 in CT/T4. Not bloody much for a
weapon that, given the same rolls, would do 12 MT points aka CT/T4 dice to
the poor schmuck in a flak vest.

So that 1/36 chance seems more like soft-tissue bruising from armor being
knocked into the wearer at key points than actual "Penetration"; any SCA
fighter can tell you that a cup hit hurts EVEN WHEN it isn\'t dead on and
penetrating!

No, Av is the last MT supplement and is pre-Virus. Aside for Hard Times,
it\'s one of the best GDW MT releases, and has a dark streak of pathos.

I am as firm a believer in keeping your background materials consistent
as anyone else, and I agree that IG has not been doing a very good job
of this; but it is really becoming clear from the postings over the last few
days that the Canon Police are going to have to come to the painful
conclusion that the writers of the Traveller products from the good old
days that we are basing our arguments on weren\'t really any better at
keeping TLs and such consistent than the new guys are; it may just be
our faulty memories of things we think we know so well since we have
used them so many times, combined with the Holy Glow that we seem to
imbue [almost] any Traveller product from the CT and MT period with
that is causing us to believe in "one background, under Marc, indivisible."

Personally, I read this as "the Solomani tried to terraform Hephaistos,
but kept over-reaching themselves economically and technologically,
and it eventually got finished when some BuCol bureaucrat thought it
seemed like a good idea at the time and authorised the expenditure of
way too much money to finish it."

Terraforming isnt *that* hard ... we have reasonable plans to terraform Mars,
basically involving "add ice asteroids+solar mirrors+algae and wait" ...
problem is, it takes 2-300 years minimum, and thats a killer when the
colony needs to return at least 3% of the investment per annum on the
terraforming investment. Far easier to take the money, build some Jump-3
colony ships and fly them and the colonists to some nice world in the
Spinward Marches. Heck, you can then fly the ships back and do it again and
again ... a fast transport does 2 parsecs/week, so in a four-year round
trip you could go 200 parsecs away. The TL12 Exploratory Traders in last month\'s
THUDD competition would be a good base for such Long-Range Colony Ships.

But thats an aside. Given the amount of "elbow room" in the Imperium,
terraforming research would be seen as a complete waste of time and effort.
I have no problem with long-duration terraforming being a TL9 technology,
taking a base 500 years, with a reduction of 50 years per TL advance in
terraforming. If you want to do it quick-n-dirty, with times in years,
rather than centuries, then you need TL16 plus.

I dont have a problem with the Imperium having social mores against genetic
engineering that lead to social pressures on genetic research ... I have
a much bigger problem with the idea that there was major technological 
regression between the Terran Confederation and the Long Night. Sylea
was more-or-less untouched by the Long Night, it was a major center in
the RoM, so it would have subscribed to the various Terran scientific
and technical journals, so the back rooms of the library of the USylea
should be chock-a-block with useful pointers on what one should be
working on to get to the technology of the Good Old Days. 

Secondly, the best available source on the early Terran Confederation is
the venerable GDW wargame Imperium. In this (a) the Terrans and the Vilani
use similar weapon systems, although ship designs differ (the Terrans
like beam weapons, the Vilani like missiles) and (b) the Terrans cant
terraform worlds - only white box/habitable worlds can develop into
"worlds" as opposed to "outposts" (if they get 16 consecutive years of 
peace, that is). From memory, there was an optional rule that you
could terraform non-habitable worlds but ... given the normal distribution
of habitable worlds in and around the Solomani Rim, I\'d say the Terrans
didnt do it.

The original version I had heard was using signal lights. And was referenced
back to a late 40\'s or early 50\'s Humor in Uniform in Reader\'s Digest.
Either way, it does amply show that assumptions about authority and
precedence usually lead to disaster. There is probably an Imperial Navy
equivalent excahnge between a Tigress and some buffered planetoid defense post.

through some stuff I\'ve been doing in real life, in the hops someone
can (a) make some sense of it so they can explain it to me, and (b)
use it in a political intrigue type campaign.

I just got a copy of a secret document. I got my copy off John, a 
lobbyist. It is basically a retyped copy of another document, which
Evan (my ally) has told me he got off Brian (a Senator, who is a traditional
enemy, but a friend on this), who got it off Amanda (the Minister ... 
our undying enemy). Evan wouldnt give me a copy. John says he got it off 
Evan. John told me not to let Evan know I got it off him.

Now, Anna (my boss) told me that Andre (a fixit man brought in by Amanda)
knows we have a copy of the original document.

The document involves a very stupid plan by Amanda that will not work,
and will result in great embarressment and expense to the poor schmuck
who will have to implement it (ie Andre). The reason the plan is needed,
is that Amanda\'s original plan was defeated in the Senate by a coalition
of forces, with Brian as the vital "swing vote".

The document was edited and retyped to disguise it\'s real source if it
needs to be passed around (always a good idea).

Now, what are the odds that Evan was lying to me when he says he got
the document off Brian, but in fact had got it off Andre (who knows
Evan quite well) in the knowledge that he would pass it onto Brian 
in an effort to make the implementation of the plan impossible ?

        PROGRAM NAME: "GALACTIC" [v2.2] {June 1997}
        GAME SYSTEM: Traveller/MegaTraveller
        AUTHOR: Jim Vassilakos  (jimv@empirenet.com)
        FUNCTION: Sector Viewer/Generator
        SIZE: 2,854,580 Bytes
        OPERATING SYSTEM: IBM (MS-DOS)
	      (but windows will also run dos-applications)
        COMMENTS: Allows user to randomly generate sectors, displays
	      the maps in VGA, translates the UWP code to English,
	      and keeps campaign notes in text files which can be
	      accessed directly from the map. The maps all mesh
	      seemlessly. Includes lots of official and non-official
              sectors. Even includes some world mapping software.
	      Note, you must use the "-d" option when unzipping:

                  >>>>>>>>    pkunzip -d gal22.zip    <<<<<<<<

Oh, and make sure you\'re using pkunzip 2.04g to do the unzipping.
If you have trouble getting Galactic, unzipping it, or whatever,
let me know. I\'ll be happy to postal you a set of floppies.

For those who have been using version 2.1, here some of the new
stuff:

  * Charles Collin contributed several alien names files for world
    generation
  * Dakin Burdick contributed the Magyar Sector
  * Michel Boucher contributed the Beyond Sector & Vanguard Reaches
    (these two sectors originally developed by Paranoia Press)
  * Lewis Roberts updated his TNE galaxy, revising the Old Expanses and
    adding Spica & Diaspora, also contributing a Classic version of the
    Spica Sector (Spica data for both eras created by Leroy Guatney)
  * Andrew Vallance contributed his Greater Magellanic Cloud galaxy as
    well as the Ley Sector and Glimmerdrift Reaches (these two sectors
    were originally developed by Judges Guild)

Here are the software upgrades:

  * Nearly all of the UWP stats separated into user-modifiable UWP.DAT
  * Added non-world objects to map (see Variant-1:Gythios/Idhra subsector)
  * Added insertion/deletion feature on the subsector map (use Ins/Del)
  * Added world mapping feature (use F4 from the subsector map)
  * Added data-strainer for PBeM-GMs (use F5 from sector or subsector maps)

And here are a few extras:

  * Incorporated Traveller Copyright Archive v0.2 into help section
  * Incorporated information on the Galactic Mailing List
  * Included section2.exe (dgp-sector sectioner) in section2 directory

That\'s all for now... let me know if you run into any snags...

Ack! Bullocks, says I.

If Skills go from 1 to about 15 in T4.1, and if in MT & CT they range up 
to 6 or 7, then all you do is chose a conversion factor, say divide T4.1 
skills by to to get MT equivalent.

No big deal.

If a skill level range similar to characteristics would improve the 
char:skill ratio, give better task results, and if it can be worked into 
chargen easily and fairly, I say, damn the past! Do it. If it improves 
the game, of course.

Just MHO.

    The USS Missouri is a Battleship.  Here in the US of A we have this strange
custom of naming capital ships after States.
    If memory serves is was the USS Nimitz and a US Lighthouse.  I believe this
example is used in US Navy Ship Handling Schools to teach prospective Captains
to NOT be arrogant. ;)

nursing.
    Just one example; In the early days of the US Civil War mortality rates in
US Army Hospitals was 90%.  A year after the nurses arrived and set to work
they dropped, with variations, the mortality rate to around 10% to 15% and
redeemed the entire medical profession. ;) So shall we add to the cascade...

    That\'s... an extremely good and interesting point!  You know this might
help as well to explain why the Vilani became so ordered, cooperative and
unrelentingly conservative; and remained so for millenia.  Because everywhere
they went they found the same thing, even with other Humans they discovered
when they began to travel in space.  Thinking on this the Terrans must have
appeared truely alien at first.  Perhaps there were even questions amongst the
Vilani if the Terrans were truly Human so alien would have been the mindset in
comparison.

    I don\'t think the Vilani could handle the Terran\'s genering of themselves.
Think of it, the one constant the Vilani and the other Humans they encountered
had was themselves.  Then they discover the Terrans could change that?  This
alone probably drove the Vilani to nearly religious levels of dispair and
frenzy.  Imagine the impact on the Vilani of Terran medical science and/or
cybernetics.  Totally alien stuff to them!

    You know this is an interesting subject, perhaps we could try and figure
out some more of the major differences between the Vilani and the Terrans in
terms of society, culture and mindset.  The Solomani party and the like may
make more sense if we do so rather then just appearing to be an abberation or
game designers pretext to set up a bunch of bad guys.  Certainly it\'s better
then more religious debate over the Holy Task System. ;)

The Beyond and Vanguard Reaches data is not anything like the book form
that I have, it is been vastly FUBARed, not the fault of M.Boucher he just
got the data from the Parania Press web site. The data there was
slagged/changed back in 94 stars moved, planets disappearing, names
changing.missing, for those of us that have the two books this data has no
appeal.

   As there was never any reason (canon or otherwise) *why* the
terraforming projects were abandoned, or the nature of those projects,
we do not know what tech level was used or was required.

   The text in the Referee\'s Companion states that terraforming becomes
possible at TL 12.  The kind of \'global terraforming\' you are referring
to involves transforming worlds with atmosphere type \'A\', \'B\', or \'C\'
into worlds with atmosphere type \'8\', \'6\' or \'5\'.  Unless you\'ve got a
canon source that states that such a transformation took place to a
world during the RoM, you\'ve got a problem with your theory.

   In any event, all of this debate about whether or not C-3P0 ripoffs
and Adamsesque (as in Douglas) world terraforming is canon so much horse
crap under the bridge unless it gets the stamp of approval from The Man
Himself (that would be you Marc).  If he is so inclined, I\'d love to
hear what he has to say about it (it would be a change from task
resolution talk...), or for that matter what Loren Wiseman or some of
the other GDW alumni present here have to say.  It would certainly save
everyone a lot of time.

Stephen, I knew it when I wrote it.  ;-> I don\'t know if Nursing..the
specific skill of Nursing..does fit in there.  Nursing *should* be a listed
skill, but it probably should stand alone.  Nurses have Medical skills, the
same as EMT\'s and MD\'s, but they have skills that the other health care
professionals *don\'t* have and don\'t get.  

Maybe all heath care workers *should* be taught patient care.  And
although, I think Nursing probably should be a seperate skill, I wouldn\'t
object to it being a fifth skill in the Medical cascade.  I guess it would
go something like:  Nurses specialize in Patient Care; EMTs specialize in
First Aid (or Trauma Care); Pharmacists specialize in Pharmacy; MD\'s
specialize in Diagnosis and/or Surgery and EVERYBODY gets a little in their
non-specialites.

>I\'m not going to repeat the... pungent comments with in a conversation
>I had with a Ladyfriend and Nurse upon her seeing this.  ;)

I can imagine.  ;-> 

Assure her I don\'t discount the role of the nurse.  I\'ve actually got more
respect for nurses than I do doctors.  They deal with the patients "up
close and personal", working every bit as hard as doctors for a *whole* lot
less money.

bands...but interpolated intervening range bands. So you can buy a

The sensor rules (which I should really post to TML sometime) make it easy
to calculate actual range at which you can detect someone for a given 
target signature, background, etc. 

Using these sensor ranges with 30000km hexes isn\'t too bad; you\'ll have to
look up the range in hexes to the target on some master table that converts
it to range bands, but that\'s a fairly quick step, and everything else
will be addition/subtraction.

Weapons are more worrying to me becaus eall the *published* designs will end
up using the standard range bands, so converting them to hexes will be more
awkward, since the standard range bands are so coarse. Anyway, we\'ll see
what happens...

   A vehicle is not a spinal mount weapon, or at least that\'s what I\'ve
been told.

   Darrian policy was to share technology of *all* kinds with the
Imperium.  The one bit they refuse to share is the Star Trigger (RSB
tells us why that might have been the case--up until the 1120s there was
nothing to share).  As for the ground transportation lag, maybe they
like the style of the older models better.  :-)  Given the GDW sources
on this, it kinda makes that one DGP reference look out of place.

   Since you have access to the Regency Sourcebook, you know that the
Darrians have concentrated a lot of effort into "pushing forward the
frontiers of advanced starship design" (p.85).  Spinal mount
disintegrators would be part of advanced starship design IMHO.  GDW
publications, particularly those that come after the DGP stuff, take
prescedence in all cases.

   This information is to a degree superceded by RSB, which indicates
that the reason the Darrians import starships is because their yards do
mostly R&D work (as stated above).  The vessels that are coming into
Darrian space were constructed using Darrian blueprints.

MT Referee\'s Companion, page 28 (Technology Chart 1) Major Terraforming is
TL 12.  *12*, just like the maximum RoM TL. 

Leroy, your "I\'ve got a secret attitude is beginning to get a bit old." 
The only consensus I see evolving here is that you are being deliberately
secretive, and are beginning to get mildly annoying. 

I\'m perfectly willing to go along with most other folks and agree that a
few RoM worlds were TL 13.  The TL 15 Imperium had a few TL 16 worlds like
Vincennes, the RoM would likely have had a handful of TL 13 worlds. 
Further, I\'m willing to admit that maybe a few such worlds would have kept
or rebuilt their tech during the Long Night, and that by Year 0 there
might be 1 or 2 TL 14 worlds out there.  However, I feel there are too
many TL 14 worlds in First Survey, and I see no evidence that the RoM had
anything remotely equal to TL 15 or 16.  At *best* they were TL 12 with a
little bit of TL 14 genetics, and maybe, towards the end of the RoM
handful of TL 13 worlds (which might well have been the ones doing the
genetic engineering).  I\'ll give you that the Terrans were likely a TL or
2 up the scale in medicine, it was, after all, their specialty.  However,
even here, I\'d give them TL 14 as an absolute maximum, and much of this
world was likely highly experimental. 

Finding an experimental TL 14 genetics lab would be a reasonable (if
amazingly rare and impressive) adventure.  Finding a few cases of TL 14
vacc suits or laser pistols is simply a munchkin-fest. 

TL 12 gives you fully practical, mass produced Low Autonomous robots,
major Terraforming and all the other advances the Terrans had. 

Leroy, if you have vast quantities of data proving this wrong, please show
it to us.

        Totally agreed by the mathematical community of the TML ;-) Please

extremely forceful ones as well) I find that I really don\'t care
anymore.  I just want it to go away - If this was happening in a bar I
be calling the cops some of these comments are nasty.

I\'ve been resisting wasting space on my own thoughts but I have to add
this.

Is Intelligence 12 fifty percent higher than intelligence 8?  Is Int 12
six times higher than Int 2?
I do not think that this is so!  And the same for Dex - yet this is the
effect some are arguing for with Stat + Skill Systems.

I agree with the skill "rates" higher than the Stat because good stats
can\'t simply replace the equivalent training/experience that a higher
skill has.
I realise and I hope that every one does as well, that skills as
presented in Traveller are abstractions to allow a gaming system to work
and any references to real life can only be broadly made.  Nobody has a
skill of 4 in anything (in real life) and modeling the actual experience
of a medically trained person with the skill medical doesn\'t really work
except that to try a more accurate measure would introduce far to much
complexity.  Maybe Eris would.... :)

We equate values and job types to skill levels (EMT at Skill 1, Nurse
and 2, Doctor at 3... or whatever) and this is also false but allows us
to adequately communicate the world we play in to the others playing in
it as well.

To expect that a Dex 12 person is 6 times as dexterous as a dex 2 person
is plainly wrong (IMHO) and I would hope that such a range is not
present in the real world.

To forstall some of the arguements about world class Gymnasts compared
to a couch potato such as myself I would have to say that I have a low
Dex and _NO_ Gymnastics skill (nor any desire to try getting some) and
that this World Class Gymnast would have a higher dex of course but it
is thye skill in gymnastics that would make the difference.  I may be
able to drive, or shoot, or perform card tricks better than them and I
would expect it to be because I had some skill in these field and they
do not.   Even if game-stat-wise they had double my dex score I feel
that it is plainly obvious that training in a skill provides for a much
greater component for success than the raw stat.  
I think that a dex 12, skill 1 driver would be at a massive disadvantage
against even a Dex 6, Skill 3 Driver.

In fact while a stat 12 should not equate to double a stat 6, a skill 2
should be double a skill 1, and skill 6 should be 6 times a skill 1 (and
expert at that).
I do not believe that skills should be capped at 6 but I feel that a
skill of 6 should be exceptional.

I care not what task system is used.  I hope that Marc Miller is swayed
at least a little by the level of discussion on the TML - Not much gets
everyone yacking about the same thing in such quantities and I hope that
the task system that results reflects a little bit of balance as I see
it and prevents these sad high stat good at everything little problems
that I felt existed even in TNE.

Now I suppose this is a little long but I hope you managed to wade
through it and I hope it made sense.

This would also explain the general prejeduce and revulsion towards 
heavy use of cybernetics that the Third Imperium showed. After all 
despite its high TL it was basically Vilani in character (after the 
Solomani Rim war, anyway).

How about:

No skill level may exceed the lower of character\'s Int or Edu.

Won\'t have any effect for most people, but it\'ll stop average people getting 
really gross skills.

Lets say a character gets 1.5 skills/year, and serves 4 terms. 4*4*1.5=24 
skills. Lets say he spreads them across only 4 skills, that still only gives 
him level 6. He *could* stick them all in one skill-24, or 2 skill-12s,  but as 
a Ref I\'d throw it back at the Player and tell him not to be so stupid. More 
likely would be 3*skill-4, 3*skill-2, 6*skill-1. I *still* believe skills 
above, say, level 6-8, should be rare and considered exceptional.

Hear hear!  My mother was a nurse.  At times she got quite frustrated 
with newly-qualified Housemen who were convinced they knew much more

Back when I was still using the Traveller character generation system I
tinkered quite a bit with it. One thing I tried was to have one or more 
of the slots on the skill acquisition tables labled <specialty>. The first 
time a character rolled <specialty> the player was allowed to select any 
skill useful to his profession. Thereafter that was the skill he got 
whenever he rolled <specialty> again. It worked quite well.

You forget that Fusion+ is supposed to be a genuine invention never before
thought of in the history of mankind. There are other such instances. Drop
tanks appear to be TL 9, but they are not invented till around 1080. There
are plenty of examples from from history of things that could have been
made with the current technology, but wasn\'t, simply because no one had
thought of doing it. The telescope is one such. Lenses were available long
befor that German chap made the first telescope.

Tired of wimpy windowed front ends and icons?

Hold that any true program runs from the command line?

Man, have I got a deal for you *g*


Two Short Planks software announces the next version of TRTOOLS, a set of
command line utilities for Traveller.

Version 0.93 of TRTOOLS covers the following:

* Sector and subsector mapping
* Hard Times effects on sector data
* TNE Collapse effects on sector data
* Regression of sectors from M:1100 to M:0

and comes complete with source code (in Pascal \'messycode\' format)...

How much for such an ill-omened piece of software, you ask?

ABSOLUTELY BUGGER ALL...all I ask is that you send me bug reports, so I can
fix problems as they arise...

Version 0.93 will be ready on about 14 days...email me to reserve your copy

have had many TL 13+ technologies:

The universities of Sylea would have had records of any mature TL 13
technology available in the RoM up to, say, -1800 (propably longer; just
because trading becomes impractical there\'s no reason to believe that
Sylea was completely cut off from the rest of Charted Space).

The only reason Sylea would not implement a useful technology is economic 
(ie. they couldn\'t afford to) (Well, of course you can always come up with 
a specific technology that there may be cultural and/or political reasons
to suppress, but that would not apply to the bulk of TL 13 technologies).

The capital of a huge interstellar empire would be able to afford to
implement any technology they cared to implement.

So if Sylea didn\'t reach TL 13 until Year 300, they didn\'t have much TL 13
knowledge before that.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been writing several rather lengthy replies to this whole discussion,
but I\'ve not been happy with any of them, so I\'m just going to go ahead and
sum them up in one brief note that doesn\'t address anyone in particular.

First, it seems to me that some of the folks who have read the adventures in
"Anomalies have missed a key point of the theme of that adventure anthology.
It\'s a theme that\'s spelled out right there on the cover. It\'s actually the
title of the anthology... "Anomalies"!

There\'s *nothing* in that collection that indicates *anything* standard about
tech levels or the Ramshackle Empire or otherwise. The region of space where
the characters find the tech is part of a series of planets that had a higher
than average technology in some areas, just like there were probably worlds
in the Second Imperium that had *lower* than average tech in some areas. The
galaxy is large. The cultural and technological variances should be at least
as great--if not greater than what we find on our own Earth... particularly
since communications in "Traveller" is no faster than the speed of travel.
Where were these worlds located? Beats me. That\'s up to the referee.

Second, the discovery of higher tech doesn\'t neccessarily mean faster
technological advancements. Even if the PCs hand their discoveries over to
the Imperium, for all they know, their discoveries go into a "Raiders of the
Lost Ark" style warehouse where, due to a paperwork fubar they become lost
for five centuries. And finding some vacc suits and guns *does not* equal
higher jump tech, much like a space alien wouldn\'t be able to reverse
engineer a microwave oven and come up with an internal combustion engine. A
does not equal B in this case, folks. And if tech does take a sudden leap
forward, well, then that\'s the call of the individual referee.

As a designer, I think it\'s my job to facilitate Referee creativity, not
limit it. "Anomalies was, in part, an excersize in providing referees with
stuff to build on for their own campaigns... if you can\'t use any of it, my
apologies. Perhaps you need to take a step back from adherence to a mythical
"canon" and realize that your campaign is *your* campaign and that you should
choose Truth and not rely on game designers to do it for you... some of us
will bend Truth every chance we get.

But, as far as "Anomalies goes, I don\'t even think I bent Truth. Upon looking
at my draft of "The Ancients" [I still have yet to see the actual published
book] and T4 again, I don\'t think I violated the All-Holy Canon. I am guilty
of imprecise terminology--the Droyne and the Ancients aren\'t *quite* the
same--but the events of "The Ancients" is in total step with Canon:
Grandfather *had* all the bodies he needed. How was he to know he got
out-smarted? And as far as the unleashed Ancient goes, the way the ending
works, there is no impact on the campaign setting one way or the other...
unless the Referee chooses to make one.

I agree with you (I\'m a chemical engineer); however, the refrigeration 
duty needed to condense the hydrogen you scoop out of the gas giant is a 
lot more than would be needed to maintain the inventory (see Bruce 
Johnson\'s reply above).  However my view of this sort of science is too 
closely bound to my real-life job, and I was hoping that one of the 
hand-waving gang could come up with a better solution.

As far as I know, the liquifaction of the cryogenic gases (nitrogen / 
oxygen / hydrogen / helium) is not be achieved with compression + 
cooling, but uses compression + cooling + mechanical expansion.  The 
mechanical expansion is the key stage ... the cool gas at high pressure 
is used to "do work" by driving the expander (exactly like a compressor 
in reverse).  The work removed gives the cooling effect required.

In a normal domestic refrigerator the cooling part actually condenses 
the refrigerant medium (freon or some non-CFC replacement), as the 
maximum pressure is below the critical point of the freon and the dew 
point is close to ambient conditions.  To use the same mechanism for 
nitrogen you need to be able to cool to -150 F (which is unlikley to be 
achieved with cooling water!).

<technical note (simplified): above the critcal point pressure there is 
no distinction between gas and liquid, so you can\'t "condense" 
the gas>


I was hoping that the unified hand-waving theorists would point out 
something such as:

(a) the ability to manipulate the weak nuclear force allows direct 
cooling of any substance, or

(b) low temperature semi-conductors allow the use of the Peltier effect 
to directly cool the hydrogen; the "hot junction" of the circuit is 
integrated with the fusion-based power plant, or

(c) although thermionic devices are first used to convert high grade 
heat directly into electic power, a similar effect can be used "in 
reverse", as it were, to produce very low temperatures.  Hydrogen is 
ideal for use in these "cryonic" devices, which are used as part of the 
fuel scoop system on startships. 

I\'ve no idea if any of these ideas are viable, but I would much prefer a 
high-tech-sounding mechanism to a more efficient version of TL 6 
designs.

From what Michel Boucher (alsandor@lords.com) told me, I was
under the impression that the Beyond used the original (booklet)
data while the Vanguard reaches used the new (web site) data.

I don\'t know Chuck\'s reasons for wanting to revise the original
(booklet) data on these sectors. About 80% of me agrees with you
and says that once published, they shouldn\'t screw around and change
stuff. However, the other 20% of me says that it\'s their baby,
and if they want to make changes, so be it. In short, it kind of
reminds me of the minor-uproar that occurred when Marc Miller
revised the Core sector data for T4, rendering much of the Classic-
Era (mainly DGP) info obsolete. I was against that, I admit, but
then again, if he\'s the person doing the work, then so be it, let
him make the decisions about what goes where.

Anyway, I\'m just glad we got permission from Chuck to include these
two sectors w/ Galactic, and incidentally, I think Michel did a damn
fine job with them. He did all the work, from contacting Chuck and
getting permission, to entering and/or importing the UWP data, to
attaching all the world notes, not to mention typing in and/or
importing the various essays and library data. Put it all together,
and you\'ve got a serious time-investment, but that\'s one of the cool
things about this "Galactic" project... there are so many people
working different angles and really throwing themselves into it that
you\'re going to get a huge hodgepodge of campaign fodder. Take the
best and toss the rest... we\'ll make more.

We\'re finally getting close to the point that the published data has
been exhausted, and it\'s time to strike out new territory and just
develop entire sectors from scratch. What I\'d really like, right now,
is for everybody who\'s developed a sector to send me their stuff.
I want David Burden to send me the jumproutes to his Gushemege Sector.
I want James Burdick to send me his Fornast Sector. I want Stu Dollar
to send me the sectors that he\'s been working on (Dark Nebula, Diaspora,
Dagudashaag, Massilia, Reavers Deep, and the TNE version of the Spinward
Marches). Leroy Guatney has also been working on a whole host of sectors.
Lots and lots. I want Grant Sinclair\'s Yiklerzdanzh Sector to be
converted to Galactic format, and Allen Shock\'s Foreven Sector, and
Jeff Zeitlin\'s Amdukan Sector, and Andrew Vallance is still working on
those Judges Guild sectors (he\'s gotten two to me already), Scott
Galliand is working on a few sectors as well, and then there\'s Mark
Ayers and Derek Stanley and a whole mess of other people. I mean, if
every person using Galactic developed just one sector, by the next
version we\'d have a sh*tload, and who really cares how much of it is
"official" and how much isn\'t. The way I see it, we\'re the folks who
are playing Traveller. If we like it and use it, that\'s all that really
matters.

Oops... how did I end up on this soapbox?  :-)

I\'ve just been looking at them this afternoon. It is basically GS & GC in 
the same book) There a small changes but nothing you wouldn\'t miss. The 
resources tables are slightly different in WBH eg. no gravitics and more 
generic resourses added. The heavy world core has been added (it was also 
in a TD so you might have that info). The main thing for me is that the 
tables in WBH are in the text, not stuck at the end. I\'m sure there are 
other differences but nothing major. WBH is a much better laid out 
product.

I think you missed the point.  This thread took a turn when someone
stated that the MT task system allows penetrating hits on people
wearing BD with eerie frequency.  I\'ve always viewed BD to being
impervious to at least some level of firepower, just like armoured
vehicles are immune to small arms today (the MT task system sees it
differently, however, allowing "mission kills" with body pistols if
the shooter is skilled enough).  Skill has absolutely *no* effect when
trying to penetrate a car windshield with a snowball.  What *does*
come into effect is the composition of the snowball and the design of
the device used to propel it.  There is a point where weaponry does
become effective at incapacitating BD, but we just disagreed as to
where that threshold actually lies.

	Heh. I think I just did that. :)

	This evenings Traveller session finished, I started thinking how
the PCs reacted to the "Lobsters". If you don\'t know what I\'m
talking about, read some of Bruce Sterling\'s Mechanist-Shaper
stories; the novel Schismatrix (sp?) featured cybernetically
enhanced humans who lived in hard vacuum; they had faceless,
featureless black shells around them, filled with cutting-edge
nanotech, wide-frequency antennae for ears and PRIS systems for
eyes... No need to take acid mon, just look at dat open cluster
dazzling on IR, UV, X-ray, Radio...

	Naturally, the "Lobsters" loathed the "havenots" (=normal, 
unenhanced humans) and going into life-supported areas of the 
Arbitela asteroid belt was a taboo. And, they were not just 
stone-faced, they didn\'t even have a face.

	Yup, I think I\'ll sleep well tonight after puzzling the heck out of 
the players! *smile*

Hmmm well from what I saw of the map that Gal22 had and the hardcopy copy

I agree I think it was due to GDW "persuading" him to change it ie too many
high tech worlds, ringworlds etc. Either way it not the same a the books. I
don\'t like that!!!!!

Electrolyzed hydrogen from waster is actually easier to deal with, because

The \'raw\' fuel from a gas giant scooping run may well be stored under

Why go to all the trouble of liquefying H2, when storing it as

gaseous H2. Even then it doesn\'t make too much sense.

When you get a skill with specialties (such as Medical), you choose a

use your plain skill level in other areas.  

This would have the net affect of increasing skill levels.

Quickly, since this is off topic for this list.  For GURPS realism
is playbalance.  It\'s fundamental approach, at least as I read it, is
that if it does everything realistically (things like psionics
excepted), it will be balanced (after all, life is not unbalanced).

Well, you can\'t have it both ways.  Everything you have just said
is a rationalization why the most talented med student might be able
to do the proceedure as well as a mediocre hack.  If the just hasn\'t
been taught some fundamental aspect he needs to know, then you should
just not allow a roll.

Um, this just isn\'t that difficult.  The problem arose that the
Medical skill covers both prefessional and non-professional usage
regardeless of level.  This doesn\'t apply to most skills.

In any case, changing the relative contributions of skills and
stats doesn\'t change the fact that you are letting someone
with Medical-1 have a chance at open heart surgery.

If the Terrans had taken on the _whole_ Vilani Empire, it is very easy
to see why they might get interrupted from time to time, and then, there
is that historical event a while later--the Long Night.

Funny, then, how AI went from TL17 in CT (see Trav Book Tech Tables)
to TL16 in MT (see "IIRC" Tech Tables, the _same_ book you mention).

Well, except for the fact that the TC AI robots employed are _also_
in the MT "IIRC".

The biggest problem I see with declaring all of this extremely advanced
Terran Confederation technology at TL12, is that the Third Imperium is
then just as capable at doing all of these things, so why didn\'t they?
I\'ve read of no edicts that declared AIs or terraforming anti-Imperial.

And besides, if we _did_ push all of this stuff down, all we would be
left with at TI TL15 would be anagathics that make your face all knotted
and "rot your balls off."  B-)

Like I have already said.  I _am_ busy.  I can not help the fact that I am
(like others are) enjoying this discussion.  I haven\'t tried to set your
agenda, so please don\'t do that for me.

I may _not_ know all that much about the TML since I am new here, but I
recognize basic freedoms:  we don\'t have to read what doesn\'t interest us,
and we don\'t have to do what others tell us to do.  As long as I am not
impuning someone\'s character (I have complained about characteristics of
some, but named names, especially since I don\'t know many), I feel that I
am not out of line on this list.

Well, I haven\'t decided exactly, but without contravening published rules,
I have not seen a convincing argument to accept anything less.

Nothing obscure and hidden.  We have touched on a lot of this issues.
Dolphins first appeared as a JTAS article, and was heavily built upon in
Rat&Cats.  I\'ll get specific when I have the time to do so in the fashion
that I am comfortable with.  You\'ll just have to wait the couple of weeks
for me to do so.  I am sorry, but I want to do this well.  In the meantime,
I tune into anything that people have to say on the subject.  I also know
that two weeks is a _long_ time on the TML. :)

I didn\'t plan this.  When I started it, I hadn\'t even looked far enough
ahead at my school schedule to see that exams were coming, and fiercely so.

Well, do what you want as long as you still have an open mind when I get
the rest out. Please.

Thanks.  I made a mistake by suggesting the TL16 until the Rim War.  It was
J.P.\'s suggestion, off the cuff having read some of the irrational opposition
to facts here.  He (or I) had not done enough research to back that one,
though I have to admit it was an interesting enough suggestion to just
throw it out here.  Thank you for pointing out additional sources for the
Terra tech quesiton.

I am not trying to torture anyone here (except one, no that\'s a joke :)
so please don\'t attribute attitudes to me that just are not true.  I just
wanted to start and listen to a discussion on this subject.  I _know_ others
have enjoyed this, though I have yet to post the magnum opus on it.  Afterall,
this did start from people complaining about TL14 vacc suits, so in one sense,
I didn\'t start it. :)

Andrew,

Unless you\'ve seen what Marc is actually planning *right* now, then your
*guess* is as good as mine. ;->  From what Marc has written, though, I do
think the average skill level is going up, and *exceptionally* high skill
levels up in the double digit range are going to be possible...not common,
but possible.

Trying to calculate total number of skills, right now, is guess work. With
the first guess being how many background skills the character gets
*before* his/her first turn.  I suspect there will be quite a few...*I\'m*
guessing 8 to 10. Then there\'s the possibility that Marc might be
considering a change where the PC automatically gets 2, 3 or 4 levels in 1
or more skills for completion of certain educational programs..it sort of
looked like that from one of his posts. There\'s also the "1/year (or a
little more)" to consider..just how much more is a little more going to be?

Well, anyway my guess is your 34 year old will have 34 to 40 skill levels
to distribute.  From this there might be 2 or 3 skills in the 6-8 range, 3
or 4 in the 3-5 range, and 4 or 5 in the 1-2 range. Yes, I know you can add
those numbers up to get *way* above 40, but I\'m just guessing here. ;-> It
could just as reasonablly be lots and lots of 1-3\'s and a few 4-5\'s, we
don\'t know yet..and even when we do know we\'ll have to decide on whether
generalists or specialists work better in gameplay.

And ,of course, if the PC stayed in for 8 terms (that\'s still reasonable)
he/she would have around 68 to 75 skill levels to distribute. With that
many levels I can see people having a double digit specialty skill.

Of course, we\'re just guessing here, but in any event I don\'t think we\'ll
see very many double digit skills. They will be rare, specialist skills, I
think. However, I do think the average is heading up to the 4 or 5 level.  

IAC, we\'ll just have to see how Marc works it all out.

But if you compress H2 far enough, it will transfer into a liquid,
will it not?

This is exactly how "The Babylon Project" handles this.  Since TBP is
in direct competition with T4, however, I doubt Marc will be making
any changes to T4.1 that borrow from TBP :)

Maybe Psychology, based on _SOC_ instead of INT or EDU.

I usually prefer a system that has a few too many skills over one that
has too few.  Here\'s my view of cascading  the "Carousing" skill:

Carousing (cascade)

  Belching The Alphabet - the skill of picking up chicks (or hunks)
  Sitting Bare-Assed On The Photocopier - the skill of being "the life
	of the party"
  Driving The Porcelain Bus - the skill of finding one\'s house keys
  Hangover Recovery Remedies - the skill of making the little voices
	go away

You misunderstood what I meant by play-balance.  What I meant was, the
character generation system in GURPS is fully play-balanced, assigning
points for various things like stats, skills, and special abilities.
If two characters built with 75 points seem imbalanced, it is probably
due to the way the players spent their points.

Since raising stat and skill points isn\'t linear with regards to a
system like GURPS, it can be quite expensive to create a character
with high stats or high skills.  It is still possible to build a
character with a high IQ and 1/2 point invested in each IQ-related
skill, though.  I\'ve played a few IQ=15 characters and the number of
skills that you can acquire with "15 or less" (on 3d6) success rates
can be a little scary.

Basically, GURPS puts a limit as to how you can build a character so
you do not have to deal with task problems like those that Dave Golden
is currently fighting against.  Any problems people might have with
"stats vs skills" with GURPS would be with the character generation
system, not the task system.  IOW, you are comparing the GURPS
character generation system with the T4.x task system.  GURPS handles
"IQ=15, Genetics 14 or less vs. IQ=12, Genetics 14 or less" no better
than Traveller handles "INT=13, Medical-1 vs INT=10 Medical-4".

Of course, the form of munchkinism that can take place in Traveller
character creation can also take place in GURPS, although in a
different way.  A person rolling up a Traveller character generates
random numbers at first, after which s/he tries to roll on the
appropriate tables to gain the skills and stats desired (although some
referees allow skills to be picked to a certain degree).  Because it
essentially costs the same to raise a stat or skill by one point,
regardless of its rating prior to the increase, stats and skills
progress linearly.  I, for one, do not believe that approaching the
pinnacle STR=15 or Med=6 (for humans) should be as easy as lesser
increases.  This is where I appreciate a play-balanced character
generation system like GURPS or Shadowrun.

But unlike Shadowrun, GURPS is so anal about assigning points and
point fractions that building characters becomes more of an exercise
in building the best character given the points allowed.

The problem I see here is that if serendipitous discoveries are 
excluded from the standard TL advancement, then TL will tell us even 
less than it does now, because of the large number of new things that 
are discovered by \'accident\'. If these \'special\' discoveries are not 
part of the normal TL societies are going to look so at the same TL 
because of diferent \'strikes\' in their histories that TL would 
totally meaningless. Besides isn\'t advancing in TL about finding out 
things you\'ve never done before?

As much as I despise "me too!" posts, I agree with this request. Medicine
is a huge field of human knowledge; lumping all of it into a single
"Medical" skill is unrealistic and undramatic in game play. Consider all
the books and TV shows which show doctors, paramedics, nurses, coroners,
health scientists, and medical administrators interacting. They are not
portrayed as clones of each other. A lot of drama can come from the
different agendas of skilled medical professionals. Doing this would also
allow more variation in non-combat personnel, which I feel would broaden
interest in Traveller without alienating the military gamers.

As for "Nursing" skill, while I agree nurses are highly trained
professionals, I dislike skills based on job descriptions rather than
capabilities. IMHO a professional nurse would probably have higher First
Aid, Administration, and Diplomacy skills than a doctor; skills all highly
useful in a medical bureaucracy.

I have already added several new skills to my campaign, and will definitely
add the suggested Medical cluster. Other skills I use in my campaign which
could fall in the medical cluster include:

	Cybernetics - designing and implanting technological augmentation
to biological structures.
	Genetics - analysing and altering organisms\' genetic code
	Xenobiology - knowledge of alien biology. Any medical task on a
creature not of your own biology is against the lower of your Xenobiology
and the controlling skill.

That *is* a good idea. RTF was supposed to be a cross platform standard,
after all.  

Ob, Traveller let\'s talk cross-system compatability.

How, do all you folks handle hardware, software, and data compatability
across multiple star systems? OK, inside the Imperium there could be *a*
standard, but once outside the Imperium, what then?

I agree, up to a point.  In my game..and Bruce that applies to AKU..the
jump fuel and fuel for the fusion power plant is, as pure as you can get,
H2 with all the other isotopes and impurities extracted as "waste." I\'m
going to use the CNO cycle, and you don\'t want D2 or T2 in that reaction. 
The scavenged D2/T2 will be used to "kick-start" the power plant.  Jump
fuel needs to be "analyzed" before use to determine the proper settings for
the jump drive, otherwise you risk misjumps.  Extra pure H2 is the easiest
to analyze, and is called "refined jump fuel."

>Why go to all the trouble of liquefying H2, when storing it as compressed

My understanding is that you can store more H2 per m3, and store it in a
more stable state if you store it as slush.  That\'s just what I\'ve read,
I\'m no expert, so I could be wrong.

  >>

A typical is Med School, where people get basically 2 skills per year.

MEDICAL SCHOOL
	Medical school attendance is required for an individual to become a doctor.
Prerequisite: BA or BS.
<snip>

Academic Skills	Honors Benefits
	1	Jack of all Trades		Degree carries
	2	Medical	the suffix Lishun
	3	Medical	(meaning Health).
	4	Medical	
	5	Physical Sciences		Receive +1 Edu.
	6	Computer	
	Roll once per year.

	Declared Major: Medical.
	Education Increase: Edu increased to 9
	Academic Degree: MD. Degree is not granted unless Medical is 6+.

	Automatic Skills: Medical-1 for each year of attendance (in addition to
other skills).
	Time Served: 5 years.

(implies Doctor is Med-6+ (up from Med-3+ in CT).

More typical are the careers, where people get approximately 1.25 skills per
year (1 per year + 1 per term for people with no commissioned rank). Its much
the same for those who do have commissioned ranks, and automatic skills don\'t
really skew it too much.

Note that Grad School requires level 6+ for a Masters, and 9+ for a Ph.D. And
that takes some owrk/attention, rather than being easy.

My guess is a non-educated 34-year-old will have (34-18)*1.25=20 skill levels
plus homeworld skills. 

Education gets you 1 skill per year, except Med School gets you 2 per year
(for 5 years, with a lot being Medical). OTC and NOTC get 2 skills extra over
4 years of college. OCT gets 2 skills for a year; OFS ditto. Technical School
gets 2 skills per year for 2 years. That still all seems close to 1.25 skills
per year.

>>
Of course, we\'re just guessing here, but in any event I don\'t think we\'ll
see very many double digit skills. They will be rare, specialist skills, I
think. However, I do think the average is heading up to the 4 or 5 level.  
<<

Double digit skills are possible, but at the risk of not knowing how to drive
a car, or being real old. If Skill-9 is the equivalent of a Ph.D, and that
takes 7.2 years to get to, I don\'t expect to see a lot of Skill-10+\'s.

Nurses would, in my opinion, have levels in Psychcology, Medical (Trauma),
Admin, and Liason.

Experince: Receive 1 skill (or level) every year on your birthday (it has to
happen sometime; maybe use New year\'s Eve?). In each session, the game master
(at session end) notes what one skill was most used, learned, notable, etc,
and awards 1 ":point" in that skill. On your birthday, total up all session
points (if you had 10 sessions, you had 10 points (unless you were in Cold
Sleep all evening or something); if you had 30 sessions, you had 30 points.
On your birthday, you get one skill level increase in the skill you most used
in the previous year.

Note: this makes it possible to pick up real levels in default skills, or in
currently held skills. Non-default skills are harder to learn (you pobably
have to go back to school to get started in them).

This approach takes care of those who play fast (many sessions) or slowly
(few sessions) per character year. It also reflects the same eligibility that
is experienced in CharGen.

What about +1 more level every 4 years?

Are you willing to move to San Francisco?  I am starting a game soon.. :)

The kilt thing came from two and a half sources.  I\'m writing a history of
the Imperial Marine Force, and have the current crop of jarheads trace
their lineage to the RoM\'s marines, and through them to the USMC and the
Royal Marines (UK).  This allows me to give my Marines pipers!  (As an
aside, the game Dirtside II defines bagpipes as terror weapons, *snark*.)

The second reason is that I\'m a costumer, and I want to do the dress
unifrom of a Marine Force Leader (0-3) for a con, and I like kilts.

The 1/2 reason is I\'m taking up the bagpipes, and would love to march the
halls of GenCon playing "Scotland the Brave" in an appropriate uniform.

I didn\'t like that paragraph when I first read it, so I immediately
introduced a house rule. For every range band above the weapons effective
range (given in the rule book), increase the task difficulty by one
(instead of the totally pathetic/useless -1 or -2DM in the rulebook). An
example will make this clearer (I hope)

Staple Gun (effective range = v.short)

Target Range     Norm. Task     Final Task
- ----     ----     ----
Contact          Easy           Easy
V. Short         Average        Average
Short            Difficult      Formidable (1 range band = 1 level increase)
Medium           Formidable     Impossible (2 range bands = 2 level increase)
Long             Staggering     n/a

As you can see, once you get past the effective range, it gets very
difficult very quickly to put the bullet where you want to - which is how
it should be. It is also interesting that in most cases shots become
impossible (notice the small i) at two range bands past the effective range
of the weapon, giving the same effect as EA.

Jason

New point in the old tech level argument.
Leroy, Harold your both right.
Leroy, if you look at evidence in MT sources it difinatly suports your
view.

Harold, TNE and to a lesser extent CT suports your view.

Hell, I researched the same question and came up with that finding. What
feels
right? I would tend to tread between the two views. Prefering TNE Tech
levels.

This isn\'t completely true. There are some flaws and contraditctions in the
GURPS point system. 

First, attributes always cost the same (strength costs the same as IQ), 
regardless of how useful they are in a particular milleu; ST is more 
valuable than IQ in a non-magic low-tech world, IQ more valuable in a high-tech,
but both cost the same.

Second, GURPS rates the cost of skills based on how *difficult* they are to
learn, not how useful they are in a game setting - learning Physics costs 
many more points than combat skills. Contradictorily, it rates 
advantages/disadvantages based on how useful they are, not how rare; the result
is that you get lots of characters with (say) Eidetic Memory - because it\'s 
priced to be cost-effective - compared to real life.

	Carefully dodging the questions I don\'t have smart answers for, 
here\'s some ideas I\'ve used with drawing deckplans in regard to fuel.

	Starship fuel is consumed by either a) Jump Drive or b) Maneuver 
(HEPlaR) drive. This we all know. Fusion rectors use so small amounts 
of hydrogen that the necessary deuterium may be extracted from the 
huge loads of LHyd that pass through the ship\'s fuel processing 
plant. The rest of main reactor fuel requirements are coolant; argon, 
nitrogen, what have you, and needs to be replenished annually.

	Jump fuel then. I had hard time imagining how damn fast fusion
reactor - no matter ho high-yield - it takes to consume five times
its volume in LHyd per jump. I reasoned 99.something% of Jump fueld
LHyd is coolant - cheap, expendable and all that.

	The rest of the fuel is reaction mass, then. The way I look at it, 
fuel processing plants do not need to refine all of the fuel into 
fusionable material. They just remove the excess methane, ammonia, 
nitrogen, water vapor, Jgd-I-Jgd pieces etc.

	Although most ships have pretty big fuel tanks, at least 20% of the
LHyd is circulated around the ship\'s hull to keep it at uniform
temperature (also explains the hundreds of fuel hits! :) ), to give
some extra radiation protection and to make the floor freeze the poor 
spacer\'s toes off in the morning.

My (and others on the list) interpretation of these questions:
The Octagon society was supposedly formed by a marooned traveller but in
reality he found an ancient site and was using the society to search for
others. The tower was purposefully built atop the ancient site. They did
not sell off the location of the ancient site for the same reason your
players would NEVER do it. The potential of exploring it yourself is much
more interesting than the peanut money the Imperium will offer you. The
base was (in my Universe) a very secret and dormant base for one of
Yaskoydroys children: Tsiotstroy. Tsiotstroy faked his own death and went
dormant to escape grandfathers wrath but the freezers didn\'t wake him when
he wanted. instead he slept for 300 000 years accumulating serious
radiation damage by background radiation (his bodycells had no time fixing
the damage while being frozen).

When the PC awoke him he thanked them but didn\'t tell them much about the
ancients story (he wasn\'t shure about the humans current relations with his
father). As his cells were hard to clone, he lacked reproductive organs and
was infact strangely incapable of biological thinking (geneered by
grandfather that way to keep the children from cloning themselves) his time
was limited. He set about destroying Yaskoydroy by locating some serious
computer horsepower (the experimental but online financial AI at Pallique).
He allied with the AI who built a pseudobio robot to easier deal with
humans. Then he started searching for possible locations for entry into Ys
universe (he knew Y had fled this universe after the final war for reasons
I will tell later). With the aid of the AI (who now calls himself Carlo
Rossum, financial genius) he came across some physics research about
gravity wave anomalies from certain gasgiants that (unknown to the
scientists investigating it) seemed to indicate the locations of gates.
Tsiotstroy and Carlo Rossum banded together a group of well payed
individuals including the leading scientist in gravity anomalies and they
set forth to find the door to Yaskoydroys universe (most of the crew are
unaware of the real purpose). Tsiotstroy is kept frozen most of the time to
prevent is lethal radiation damage from continue degrading him. The PCs who
got the two teleporter disks from Twilights Peak are enrolled by a job
offer that fits the PCs perfectly (Tsiotstroy and Carlo R need the disks in
a scheme to kill Yaskoydroy).
Well they manage to capture the PCs, steal their teleporters, buy some
experimental craft from the Ansing expeditions and force the PCs to
investigate the located Gate (they have some captured friends of the PCs
kidnapped to force them do it). the PCs are instructed NOT to enter the
gate which the of course do but unknown to them behind a fake
instrumentation rack one of the teleporter disks is hanging. Thus the PCs
enter Ys universe, gets picked up by his orbital defense mechanimsm and
rudely put down on a small artificial island together with other jumk that
the gate has tranported during the illenia. Grandfathers main interest
today is homemade ecosystems with artificially created lifeforms so the
island is a perfect grassfield with sim dungheeplike lumps here and there
(large floating gasgiant animals that accidentally got teleported by the
gate). At the north end of the island there\'s a HUGE tower (1 km thick, 85
km high) that is acually a huge "tree" served by geneered dogs that
constantly climb it with gravthruster fruit (the gravthruster fruit is
needed to keep the tree from collapsing as no biological material is strong
enough for 85 km towers even on 0.6 G planets).
Inside the treetrunk floats Yaskoydroys small home from which he conducts
his experiments.

Sorry for the length of this and possible uninterest to most LISTOIDS but I
thought it would be at least as interesting as another "=8AKBv2.0 is worse
than Txx because mumble, rumble, religious stuff=8A"

I have maps of the island, the tree and the home of Yaskoydroy plus
rendered views from the Island as well as inside the tree. I\'ve also got a
(pretty crappy) QuickTime movie of Ys home descending to capture the
players. Anybody interested can drop me a line and I\'ll mail them to you
(I\'ll skip the QT movie unless specifically asked for). the maps are in
MacDraw II format easily read by ClarisDraw and I can also convert them to
PICT if you like (PC guys: you\'ll have to find some conversion software for
this - we Mac users do it all the time so once in a while you should have
to as well ;)

Pretty similar but better laid out, easier to use and much better graphics.
It pretty much includes everything from Book 6(+) Scouts as well. Nice
deckplans of the Donosev Survey Cruiser. the temperature calcs etc are much
easier to do than in Scouts and the geological activity stuff is less
strange (but they err in tidal effects from gasgiants and the illustration
on elliptic orbits indicate that the artist at least has no idea how
planetary orbits work)

A must have if you can find it.

Nope. There were long-ish chunks of peace between the Interstellar Wars,
and the Ramshackle Empire/Rule of Man lasted a couple of hundred years -
well and truly long enough to finish the job *if* the technology was 
sufficient to allow the project to be finish in a reasonable time on a
reasonable budget.

Yup. And that is why they were both able to recover to the RoM high common
TL of twelve in a relativly short amount of time, but then took much,
much longer to get to TL13.

Terraforming isnt illegal, it\'s just uneconomic aka pointless.

I *think* AI\'s would be granted the same legal status as any other sentient
in the 3I, so their slavery would be illegal. So why pay gigacredits to
develop an AI if you have to pay the damn thing a salary just when it
gets smart enough to be useful ?

No, you are left with a 3I that stayed at a TL of eleven to twelve for
bioengineering, cybernetics, terraforming and so on. It is something the
3I just doesnt do, and thus doesnt get better at ...

  As for really alien aliens, that\'s one of the best things about 2300AD.
I always thought that game was Traveller done right, with an interesting
background and science that was just on this side of reasonable.  I\'m
talking 2nd edition, by the way, and I must admit I like the background
better than the rules set.  In any case, I think the Kafer were one of the
best developed and interesting aliens in any science fiction setting - I
was especially fond of why they wanted to kill off the human race, which
in their own terms was a highly sensible response.

  In any case, the material from the game supplements and articles in
Challenge gave you a whole set of aliens for 2300AD who were more than
Star Trek style humans-in-rubber-suits.  In part it\'s a function of the
original design, which made the Traveller universe a human-centered one,
but aside from the Hivers, and maybe the K\'kree, the aliens in Traveller
are just not that interesting.

[Stuff about GURPS deleted.  I obviously like GURPS since I wrote
and posted a GURPS Traveller article.  I\'ll just say, to try and
wrap this up since it\'s off topic for the list....]

Yes.  I do think that GURPS handles stats and uses a stat+skill
system well.  It is true that you can gain a bit with character
creation by alwasy going for optimal tradeoffs, but that is true
of any system (for example the munchkins had all established
that 40 years old was the optimal target for Classic Traveller
character generation).  Unless you give a munchkin no choice
in creation, he will be able to use every decisions to do what
is most optimal.  GURPS is about such choice and I prefer it
that way (I was hoping that traveller would go to point based
system).

>But unlike Shadowrun, GURPS is so anal about assigning points and

>in building the best character given the points allowed.

GURPS isn\'t anal about points.  Some _people_ are (just like some
people can be anal about serving the optimal number of terms)
but I don\'t favor screwing up a fine system because some people
are more interesed misusing the system than roleplaying.  A lot
of people like GURPS because is allows them to roleplay the
characters they want.

Other folks can do the same, and maybe everyone can learn a new trick or
two to use in their own campaign. 

In our group we have used T4 Char gen (with additional MT professions
modified for T4 (1 skill/year...).

MT Task resolution and MT combat (combat is debugged and mildly modified).

TNE Psionics (ie no psi points).

Special Rules:

Players work out the basic character conception before the begin character 
generation.

Characters get 50 points to spend on stats.  No stat may be above 12 and 
no stat may be below 5 w/o a good reason (both are applied before any 
modifications for species are made).

Enlistment is not rolled, but the PC must have reasonable stats (GM
discretion) for the profession chosen. 

All Skills are chosen.  These choices must make sense and the player must
describe (roughly) how their PC learned these skills.  Skill choices must
make sense for the character conception.  Skills range from 1 (novice) to
6 (sector-wide champion).  No PC may have more than 1 (or if very good
reasons being given) 2 skills at level 6. 

No more than one skill choice may be used on stats in a term (However,
automatic education gains in college are still kept.  I greatly prefer the
new T4.1 Edu system, previously we simply halved all T4 education
increases from college and grad school). 

Injury, Commission, & Promotion, are all rolled as normal. Continuance is
rolled or automatic at the players discretion.  Cash and other mustering
out benefits are rolled normally. 

Personally I\'ve never seen the appeal of rolled stats or (especially)
rolled skills.  Randomly generated PCs are little fun to any of the folks
in my group. 

Comments?

So, what do you use?

I realise people are getting sick of the task discussions, but I think we
have (finally) got somewhere.

Eris and Scott Ellsworth\'s both posted ideas about multiple shifts in 
difficulty. Both of these idea\'s I like, Scott\'s is easier to read (and less 
prone to typos) Eris\'s is probably quicker when you get used to the system.
IMHO, I think that scotts will be easier for new players and referees.

Douglas Berry and several others suggested including time in generic task
descriptions. I think the best way to do this is print the average time taken
with the task description. For most task this is all thats needed, time isn\'t
usually important. Referee\'s and players who want to use the MT 3D6 time
system 
for variable times for tasks (or some other system) can do so using this
value 
as a base.

So we now have a task description that looks like:

     To create a Traveller task system
     Formidable, Psychology, Int, 20 Years
     Referee: SS Credit in T4.1 for TML
     SF starts a flame war on the TML
     Less difficult if designer has experience with other game systems
     Much more difficult if designer is a munchkin

This will work well with the MT system, I\'m sure kenneths system is either
already compatible (or can be easily modified so it is), T4.1 task system
(whatever it is) can be written so it is compatable. I think it\'s even 
compatable with TNE (I\'m not sure though).

The only real disadvantage is that the description is a little vague when it 
comes to rules, because it is generic. To get round this the new rulebook
could
contain a 1 side "Guide to tasks" including how to interpret a generic task 
description. A nice touch would be "permission of photocopy for personal use"
in small print at the bottom of the page :)

	As a real-world aside, so did the traditional hereditary mortal
enemies of the Scots, the Scots, as well as the *other* traditional
hereditary mortal enemies of the Scots, the British.  After the Brits
finally managed to conquer Scotland in the mid-18th century (after 600
years of trying and they were right next door, ha!) they banned the pipes,
as well as gaelic and the wearing of the tartan (and I\'m tempted to say
something about Buchanan tartan also being a terror weapon but I\'ll stop
now :>).

	Coolness.  I took a few years of lessons when I was in the Black
Watch Cadets in high school.  Still have my pipes packed up down in my
basement.  I never really got very good at it, probably because I was
approaching the pipes as a musical instrument rather than a martial art,
but I had a lot of fun.

The DeFacto system would be as follows;

Step 1: Determine Plot Requirements
Step 2: Establish need for either A). Quick resolution to go on to next
plot section or
B). Desire for Job-like suffering on the part of the players.
Step 3: Assign probabilities of success as appropriate.

This method has been described elsewhere on this list (See Thread about
"Being Honest")

In all seriousness, damage should be pretty much based on what hits the
ship took in the battle that preceded their crash (or landing if you
prefer).  If the components damaged are redundant, then the duplicate
components can probably (Say, with a difficult task, failure meaning they
have another chance that takes twice as long, second failure ruins the
component) be jury rigged to allow the ship to limp home.  Skill used
should be appropriate to the component (Engineering for engines,
electronics for communicaitons parts, etc.)

If components are not redundant, a determination needs to be made about the
likelyhood of carrying this partucular item as a spare, or something
similar enough to be jury rigged.  This may result in cannibalizing
something else (Well, captain, we can take out the main laser reflector
dish to use as an active EMS array...of course, then we wont have any
laser...) to get a primary component working.

This task should be formidable, with great emphasis put on enabling skills
and high skill levels;  For example, if a character repairing the drives
has Engineering-4 alone it would be a normal chance to adapt the ship\'s
boats parts to the parent\'s engines, relative to if the character has
ship\'s boat-3 as well, which allows her to be more aware of the relative
characteristics of the two different engine pods as they perform.

In any case, the task should be relatively uncertain so that when the craft
finally lumbers into the air (if it does) there is much trepidation,
punctuated by the fact that "ominous noises come from the direction of the
drives, the whole ship shudders a moment and seems to hang
motionless...then flies on, the engines adopting a strained, higher note."

In any case, **your plot requirements** are paramount and should be looked
at to determine whether the damage cannot be repaired here at all, or is
relatively minor and requires just a bit of reconnecting fused or destroyed
wiring.

Traveller adventures are not usually random wanderings whose plot is
determined by the success or failure of specific tasks or rules.  It is a
tapestry, whose general pattern is outlined by the GM, but whose specific
threads are stitched by the individual players.  If keeping to the general
pattern requires that the players leave their glacier without delay, they
must be able to do so.  If it requires them to explore and discover that
the glacier they landed on is, in fact, the secret base of the fighters
that shot them down, then their engines are pretty much shot, perhaps
requiring only a small, specific part which could be easily stolen from the
bad guy\'s base.

Ok I\'ll bite on this one.

Most of what you say make good sense.  The part I can\'t figure out is, if
you use the H^2 (or H^3 as some believe) to cool the ship, what do you use
to cool the H^2?  You\'ve got to be running a damned good compressor to keep
the stuff liquid if you are running it through the power plant all the time
to keep the fusion containment chamber from melting.  Suppose this is part
of the fuel purification system (which leads to the question...what do
ships without purifiers do?).

Perhaps there is some way of using the cold vacuum of space to compress and
cool the H^2, but I\'ve heard the chemists and physicists on this list
(which I cannot claim to be) talk about how difficult it is to cool things
in space before.

It\'s propably not a large number. Most sophonts in the Traveller Universe
seems to be perfectly happy with the knowledge their great-to-the-nth-
grandfathers invented.

Surely it would be a lot worse to require all societies to fit into just
16 different molds? IMO the chance that two TL X societies happened to be
exactly alike would (and SHOULD) be very small.

>Besides isn\'t advancing in TL about finding out things you\'ve never done

Say that you arrive at a new planet. They have factories, cars, and railroads.
"Aha!" you say. "TL 4 or 5. Let\'s go buy a gun." "Gun? What\'s a gun?" your
friendly native guide asks. Do you immidiately revise your estimate of the
TL down to 1? Or do you smile and start planning the firearms company you\'re
going to build? And do you plant to build laser and gauss rifles, or do you
plan to build TL 4/5 rifles and pistols?

A society can easily be of TL X without having _all_ TL X technologies. I
mean, a desert planet may not even know about rafts, but that dosen\'t make
them TL -1.

OK, so a starting PC who is 34 years old will have around 22-24 points in
skills, and one 38 (5 terms) will have 27-29 points in skills.  If we are
calling 6 levels of skill professional (equivalent to 3 skill levels in
CT) then I think T4.1 characters will go back to being as vastly
underpowered as CT characters were.  An average (and I\'ve always found 4-5
terms to be average for Traveller characters) will have (if they take
nothing else) 4 skills at professional level.  More likely, that same
character will have 2 skills at professional level and 4-5 at hobbyist
(level 2-4) level.  This looks much like CT where PCs generally had around
8-12 skill levels (except each skill level was worth twice as much).  If
the PC has any skills at expert levels (9+) they are likely to have almost
no other useful skills. 

The one thing I *really* liked about T4 was the fact that PC\'s finally
received a reasonable number of skills.  24 skill levels under the old CT
skill values (level 3 = professional) allows a character to have 3 skills
at professional level (level 3) one skill at expert (level 4-5) say 7
skills at level 1-2 (beginner, mildly trained).  This does not make for
any overpowered character, this makes for an interesting, competent PC.
Taking those same number of skill levels and cutting their value in half
does nothing except render characters semi-competent at best. 

If you want to play an adventurous Archeologist (ala Indiana Jones) You
could have Archeology 9, Linguistics 3 and Research 3 (likely the absolute
*bare* minimums for any practicing Archeologist), Grav Vehicle 3
(moderate, unexceptional driver) Gun Combat 3, and one other skill at 3. 
This isn\'t a hero, this is a barely component individual who is a fine
archeologist, and is entirely unexceptional at *everything* else. 

The new skills guidelines sound like a great way to roll up Bob the
accountant, and Martha the local cope, but leave a lot to be desired if
you want to play James Bond, or anyone else who is even slightly heroic.

That page lists Terra as a TL 15/16 world.  *However*, that page is a
write-up of Terra in *1121*.  This in no way proves that Terra had
anything comparable to this TL during the ROM.  In fact, it rather argues
against it, since if Terra had a TL of 16 during the Rule of Man and (as
our data seems to indicate) it was not invaded, bombed, or otherwise
greatly messed up during the Long Night, then it should have been able to
recover its alleged TL 15/16 tech much easier, and would likely be at TL
17 or 18 by 1121.

Your TL stats are *way* overrated.

The suggestions you\'re making would have resulted in ridiculous advantages
for the Terrans. *No one* had reached TL 16 in any given field by the time
of the RoM.

Your statistics would cause ridiculous distortions in canonical Traveller
history.

The statement that we think of TL in terms of jump drive only carries so
far. Jump capability is part of the equation and different groups have some
variance in the levels of technology they have achieved over various
fields, but 4-5 levels higher than their jump capability?!

Preposterous. A munchkin\'s wet dream.

Exactly.

I hate to waste bandwidth with a "me too" message, but I\'m so annoyed by
Leroy\'s ridiculous assertions that the Terrans had TLs of 16-17 (in limited
fields or not) that I *have* to voice my agreement with Douglas.

Leroy, back it up. The simple fact of the matter is that you can\'t because
everything you\'ve written on this subject flies in the face of what has
been written in the past in Traveller publications. Only with the most
outlandish rationalizations can you possibly assert that the Terrans had
this kind of technology.

You throw the entire balance of power into chaos if you put this into your
campaign.

iirc, Iolanthe is Strephon\'s wife.

Strephon\'s wife.  She gets a pretty good write in TD #9, and is present
along with the Grand Princess when Dulinor opens fire.

That\'s for Earth in the MT Era.  The date of preperation is 009-1121,
almost 2900 years after the RoM.  Also note that in the same book, pg. 41
under World Generation it states that the absolute max for Solomani TL is
15.  Hardly the kind of restriction a people who once rivaled the Ancients
would have..

MT Referee\'s companion, pg 35:

"In -2389, the Terran Confederation Navy commissioned a line of
mass-produced tech level 12 robots as support staff for military personnel.
 These were not warbots as we know them today.  A few of the robots were
expert medical robots or served as administrative support, but most were
heavy duty, hard working construction robots, used to build temporary
installations for advanced bases."

We can see here that the Terrans are using TL12 robots as first line
military support soon after the start of the First Interstellar War
(-2408).  This speaks highly for an experimental TL of 12 during this period.

Ibid, pg 34: "-2210 Terrans discover Jump3"

So by -2210, the Terran Confederation is solidly TL12.  It takes the Third
Imperium 450 years to go from TL12 to TL13 (-150 to 300).  Assuming it
would take the Solomani as long, we should see TL13 coming to be common
around -1760.

Oops.

By that point, the Ramshackle Empire was faling apart at the seams.  If the
collapse into Twilight was like any other interstellar conflict we have
seen, the high TL worlds would take it on the chin.

I can accept that one or two worlds might have reached experimental levels
of TL14 before the Long Night.  But not enough to justify more than the
very rare artifact in M:0 days.

There is my evidence for a RoM tech level of 12 edging into 13.  If anyone
has any contrary evidence, please quote it by book and page.  Condescending
comments will be forwarded to dev/null.

Perhaps also detailing *why* there is a generic task description (ie.
that many Traveller players favour the different task systems shown in
the various editions of the Traveller game). This would let newbies know
that there are many different systems for Traveller, perhaps say that
they will be shown in JTAS articles.

Quoting from MT Imperial Encyclopedia:

Iolanthe (1052 to 1079): Empress of the Imperium.  Iolanthe, the daughter of
the senior duke of Gushemege sector, and member of a prominent Vilani noble
family, married Strephon in 1079.  Her primary avocation is the preservation
of developing cultures within the Imperium.  She was murdered, along with her
husband the emperor and her daughter the grand princess, in Dulinor\'s
assassination attack of 1116.

(Mis-print for the date range?? - I guess it should be 1052-1116.)

Hum, that\'s a little lower than I\'d like, but it\'s easily modified by
anyone that wants to boost the skills a little.  Instead of 1/year +
1/term, use 1/year + more/term, where more can be as "heroic" a number as
the sort of campaign you want to play.

John, I *hope* the PC will get more than 2 to 4 homeworld/background
skills.  I\'m still thinking that ought to be 8 to 10.  If it comes in much
lower than that, I\'ll seriously consider boosting it in my games.

Same here.  I like PCs to have more skills, and with the Task System I\'m
useing they need higher levels too.

>does nothing except render characters semi-competent at best. 

I don\'t think it\'s *quite* that bad...remember Marc hasn\'t told us if (or
how) he\'s changing the Task System yet.  I\'m sure he\'s playtesting all the
parts to make certain they work together and produce competent PCs.

Although, the skill guidelines *seem* a little low to me, it\'s too soon to
say.  As for what kind of PCs you\'ll end up with, well I\'ve always thought
that *official* Traveller rules gave you characters that could be described
as "ordinary people doing extraordinary things."  If you wanted your PCs to
be James Bond - Agent 007, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, or Captain
Wallop of the Space Patrol you alwyas had to juice up the Character
Generation system.  It looks like that\'s still going to be the case.  

Me, personally, I like games where the PCs are a cut (or two) above
ordinary in some fields, but ordinary in most.  What I have to do to get
that kind of PC will depend on what Marc decides to do.

I\'m not quite as worried about coarseness in weapon ranges since I

I think I once managed to get ~50 skills out of High Guard (or it may have 
been Mercenary - ISTR it was more generous) for a 4-5 term character...

A quick look at the last version of 4.1 gives:

Homeworld skills: max=5
University w/OTC: 6
Army Officer 3 terms: 17

Total=4 terms, 28 skills (goes up to 34 skills after 5 terms)

I *think* this is the most you can get (BICBW).

Your hypothetical 8-termer would have 54.

This seems okay to me, but I wouldn\'t like to see it go up any more.

I figure the Imperium has a mandated open-sysetems-platform which is used
for all imperial government computing. Most stuff is distributed in
compileable source in one of the dozen or so languages.

Imperial Hardware must use the same basic op-codes for the CPU, with a
trade restriction for non-compliant processors: No Imperial unit may
purchase, use, or sell such non-standards. Independants can, but must
clearly label them, and they may be barred by the recieving world.

The solomani Confed I have taking a similar approach, but with different
standards, and higher standardization. They can cross-compile much with
little real work (Routine, Computer, Int). No cros-run binaries, tho.

Zhodani stuff I make as one smooth, plug-in based OS, good for laptops to
megaframes. Totally incompatable with imperial processing equipment, but
some software can be run using emulators with special and expensive
hardware and software plugs.

    'body' => 'I\'m currently playing a quasi-CT campaign in a homebrew sector located
"somewhere near the Spinward Marches". The Sector is a sort of buffer zone
between Zhodani and Imperial borders, and the two powers are currently
trying to regain influence on the sector\'s worlds, mostly by covert
actions and political or economical support to local factions (a lot like
USSR and USA efforts in third world countries during the seventies).
Most of the local planets were originally controlled by the Imperium, but
became indipendent after the third frontier war (current year should be
around 1073).

Anyway, here is the question.

So far the PCs didn\'t have access to a ship, and their adventures were
always located on some planet\'s surface. Now I\'d like to change that: one
of their next adventures will be a mines-clearing job.
I know that mines in deep space don\'t do a lot of sense: I was thinking of
a mined asteroid belt. I.e, mines (or perhaps missile racks) built just under
the asteroids surface, which will release payload when a ship comes near
enough to the battery.

This would allow for placing some interesting surprises beyond the mine
fields: a small belters group which remained insulated after the war,
and/or an hidden space pirates base.
As I said, the sector is mostly free from direct Imperial control, so
Space Pirates may exist in the area, and they could have access to an
hidden cache of weapons/stuff which Navy thought to be lost during the
war.

Here is a list of ideas I\'d like to see discussed/dissected/flamed over by
the TMLers:

Mapping:   How would you map a group of asteroids to allow for continued
           campaigning inside? The obvious choice is no map, and just
           detailing some of the more interesting rocks. Any other option?
           Also, not being an expert on Astonomy/Astrophysics, would someone
           please give me more details on "realistic" asteroid belts... all
           I know about asteroids comes from the _Empire Strikes Back!_
scenes.
           The most important question would probably be "how near is
near?" i.e., in
           an asteroid group, which will be the typical distance among the
asteroids?
Mechanics: I would like to use the Roleplaying System for ship actions.
           Any other stuff you would care to suggest?
PCs:       I\'ll probably have a couple new players for this.
           Suggestions on career/specific skills choice/party composition?
The Mines: Which kind of devices would you use to defend an asteroid belt?
           How would they work? How can they be disabled? Consider that
           they should still work (at least some of them) after decades.
Economics: How many ships besides the PC\'s Scout? How much should the Patron
           (probably a Megacorporation) offer for the job?	
Equipment: Any special stuff for this mission? Would Air Rafts work in this
           environment? (i.e. can you use the air-raft to move from the
           ship to the asteroids and vice-versa or would you need another
           type of vehicle?)
Other
references: Any other source on this? Novels, movies, old adventures,
            other games (i.e.  Star Wars RPG)...


Thanks for your input. As usual, I\'ll be a little slow to answer mostly
because I prefer the digest.

Good.

<sum up skills most used in session>

Good plan.  I am using something similar, and it has worked out ok.  What I
do is, at the end of the session, allow the character to pick from the top
3 or so, and say that those were the skills that were most used.  At the
end of a three month period, they get a third of a level in skill they used
the most overall.  Particularly stressful or important experiences get them
a number of "most used" points - the skill-0 engineer who helped reboot the
jump drive got a dozen sessions equivalent, so it is pretty likely that
they will get a third of an engineering skill level in a few weeks.

I handle training in much the same way - if the character is training in a
skill, they can get level zeros pretty easily, and can push a skill that
would otherwise not have been the most used one up.

I have occasionally allowed particularly stressful experiences to produce
six such third point adds in a year, but this is not a happy person who is
living through it.

>What about +1 more level every 4 years?

I do 5 and a third every four years, and it works pretty well.

OK, I most definately didn\'t want to start a round of GURPS bashing

leave it at that I think I\'m not trying to tell everyone to switch

This isn\'t a big deal.  I run both Fantasy and SF games and
sure, players may push a few steps higher in one than the
other.  Big deal.  If it really bothers you, you can always
just institute an Unusual Background advantage or disad?

Um, things you are born with can\'t be more or less difficult.
(You just have them) and are limited in a way skills are
(they are impossible or difficult to get after character
creation).  Also, advantages are cost to be balanced.  (I
don\'t know what you mean by "cost-effective" or how point
costs can be compared to real life).

I agree it was more suited to TD9 - there\'s almost nothing else

What\'s the copyright position on this?  I\'m perfectly happy to do 
it, but I don\'t want to step on anybody\'s toes, particularly now 
Roger Sanger has a chance to revive DGP\'s legacy.  I want an 
opportunity to get some of the DGP books I missed, like Rats &

The problem is the heat lost in vaporizing LHyd is not that great.

If you have reaction mass, aren\'t you taling Heplar?

I always figured that what happened is that when you jumped
you needed a lot energy in a short period of time.  For
that reason Jump drives have their own reactors that are
capable of creating huge throughputs at low effeciency
(thus the reason you need all that hydrogen is inefficiency
and that you need a lot of energy to get into jump space).

	I still have a problem with fixed EDU levels. What if a character already
_has_ a high EDU? He learns nothing more than the specific skills while
he\'s in med school? Learning in other areas _still_ goes on.

	PLease give us all a rest, Leroy. This "I know something you don\'t, but
I\'m not gonna tell you, but you\'re wrong and I can prove it, only I don\'t

	I didn\'t say "as well." I said the talented med student ought to have a
miniscule chance, while the average person (NOT a "mediocre hack") has a
higher chance of succeeding. *IF* the student succeeds, he\'ll have done a
good job (that\'s the definition of success). But odds are long against it.

	I\'m not even addressing the professional/non-professional nature of the
skill. With ANY skill, a trained average person ought to have a better
chance at the whole range of tasks, whereas the talented newbie should only
be better at a few narrow tasks--for simplicity I\'d rather skip that.

	No, it doesn\'t, and that\'s my point. All it does is reduce the chance of
the Med-1 succeeding, which is the whole idea. Again, anybody can try
anything. With a good reference, I can try open heart surgery. I\'ll wind up
charged with murder, unless a one-in-a-million miracle occurs, but I can
try. And I want my players to have those options.

	If you restrict people to only trying tasks where they have a reasonable
chance of success, you take some of the thrill out of the game.

	Again, you\'re focusing narrowly on the Med-n example, but this
illustration applies to ANY skill. Stat-12 Skill-1 will be better at a few
tasks than Stat-8 skill-4. But over the long run, the Stat-8 Skill-4 will
have a better chance of succeeding at the full gamut of Skill-related tasks
than Stat-12 Skill-1

But, as a datahead, I can\'t help myself...

The answer to this question is that, very likely, the future will look
somewhat like today; (I just hope that it doesn\'t turn out to be Microsoft
Imperium ;-) there will be a welter of file formats, more or less
interchangeable with each other. There are ample references to \'Standard
Imperial Data Package\' stuff in canon to make me think there are commonly
used data formats, which make access and utilization relatively
transparent.

Once you go beyond the Imperium, I suspect that situation will change
somewhat, but not all that much, and \'lowest common denominator\' formats
will be readily shareable by all. By the time of the TL-12 Imperium,
\'lowest common denominator\' just MAY have moved beyond ASCII ;-)

When you get into other empires, you could well run into alternate
computing paradigms, making interfacing quite complicated. But, this is
one of the roles of the Scout Service and the Imperial Diplomatic Corps,
since formal relations with the Imperium will have to involve some large
data transfers, as will conducting business with the Imperium. 

Imperially mandated \'Standard Data Formats\' to do business with the
Imperial Government will go a long way to standardizing things.

But, all of this is akin to the idle speculations of a couple of guys
sitting in ancient Babylonia, staring at some drying clay tablets, and
wondering how the people in the far future may manage to read each others
clay tablets.

My guess is that simply saying \'yes it works\' will do.

British includes Irish AKAIR and the Irish had no problem conquering
the far north of the British Isles. 

The Scots where an Irish tribe who came, saw and stayed.
Not often that I care to admit to this side of my background.
That is being half Irish, not an invader of Scotland.

British does include Scotish as well.

All in jest.

In M1100, I assume that everyone uses the Imperial Data Package (IDP)
standards, both in the Imperium and around the borders. As my campaiagns
haven\'t gone that far beyond the borders, it hasn\'t been an issue. I assume
that the Aslan etc have different protocols (even at clan level).

In M0, it bears some thinking about - isn\'t there a comment in the M0 book
that talks about the Imperium imposing standards on worlds? Maybe they make
high technology or obsolete Imperial standard equipment available at a low
cost to make the new/potential Imperium members hook into the empire\'s
standards, and thus impart a degree of economic dependence.

A not unreasonable idea.

I would be very, very happy to get any of the old issues of TD/MJ that Mr.
Sanger feels like rereleasing.  I suspect that he could make a quite nice
product with minimal effort (assuming he has the source files) by stripping
out all but the data, the maps, and the (non topical) articles.  For
example, it would be worth a reasonable amount to just get the entire stack
of articles on the Grand Tour printed up in a thick stack, sans ads, and so
on.

You could always just tell your players to double the number of skills
called for under the normal chargen rules and sit back with a smile at
the cheers.

Then see if anyone stops cheering and starts wondering why you\'re being

Or would the Imperium\'s economic impact reach far enough that everyone
around would follow suit?  IIRC, one of the reasons that Virus spread so far
and so fast, into Solomani, Aslan, K\'Kree & Hiver space was that all
interstellar shipping used Imperial transponder suites, so Virus had a home
already in place on every ship around. 

An 11,000 world economic engine will have a wider impact that any military
force.

Nursing should be the top of a cascade of skills, just as Doctor should be,
neither is a \'one skill covers all situations\'. Being a medic is not the
same as being a doctor or a nurse by a long, long, long shot.

Perhaps the whole problem with the task system is that the skills are not
sufficiently granularized to make proper application of attributes and skill
scores meaningful, as the last few exchanges about doctors, nurses & Medical
skill would imply.

I like this!  It goes a long way as to describe exactly *what* one
level in a skill really is (if it takes you one full year to gain one
level).

If you are planning to increase skill maximums above 6, though, you
might have to award two such skill levels per birthday or New Years.
This is because a single skill level would no longer be as valuable if
the ceiling on skills is raised above 6.

> What about +1 more level every 4 years?

I\'d say yes.  Traveller has always awarded very few skill increases
compared to other game systems and my players sometimes complain about
how slow it takes to improve skills :)

Try http://www.davtechsys.com/traveller.html I just did a little logical
searching and came up with that URL.  The old one is still there for some
reason, but it points to an invalid ftp account.  This one points to their
on FTP server.

I get a communications exception when I try to download any of the files,
but that might be because I\'m trying from a Macintosh.

Glad to hear it\'s been turned into freeware so it doesn\'t pass into total
obscurity.  Now if someone could just tell me where I can get the old Apple
II software, now that I finally have an Apple II :^)

Quick question, does the Central Supply Catalog have new armours in it? 
I found the list in the main T4 rulebook lacking, and there\'s none in

Recently, in the first Traveler adventure I\'ve referred with the use of
Emperor\'s Arsenal something came up of interest.  Many o the weapons in
Emperos\' Arsenal have damage ratings above 3D, and therefore, their
extra damage is wasted.  I\'m not quite sure on the point of having the
damage rating of, say a acr-12 be 5 or Gauss Sniper Rifle-12 be 8 when
this damage can only be applied up to a 3D maximum.

In the instance of more than 3 dice of damage, is the total roll made,
with the best results being kept?  

I was quite perplexed by this, and my players were as well, so any help
would be appreciated.

Yet anothert question.  In the main T4 rulebook, on  page 58, it states
the following about called shots:

"Called Shots:  Characters may make nearly any sort of attack as a
called shot, targetting a specific body location, or attempting to
increase or decrease damage, or attempting to hit an unarmoured
location."

The following entries tell of modifiers for trying to produce minimum,
maximum, triple, etc. damage, as well as disarmament, but nothing gives
a modifier for the attempt to tagret a specific location on a person\'s
body.

If this was errata not included in T4, or just not included altogether,
I\'d love to hear someone\'s house rule to cover it.

BTW, just as a related question, where can I find the latest version of
T4 errata?

I noticed that while looking through the T4 experience chapter it
mentions the learning of new skills, as split into "two categories:
zero-level skills and professional skills".

Exactly what is the definition of a professional skill?  I guess I may
have missed it, but does this apply (I believe) to scientific, and other
skilled \'skills\' such as engineering, etc.  

And, as for the zero-level skill, does this mena the ability to learn
any skill at zero-level or just non-professional ones?

If I\'ve missed something, could someone please point out a page
reference in the T4 rulebook for me?  Thanks,

    'body' => 'Hi,

While writing up a quick adventure for my players, I had them make up
their characters, informing them that they didn\'t have to roll random
skills, but instead could pick and choose as they wished.  basically, I
hoped that they would pick out skills they had seen necessary in
previous adventures to provide a well-rounded character.

Unfortunately, when we came to play I didn\'t have time to review their
characters before play (I know, bad reffing, but we were running short
of time, and one of my players was only here for the weekend), and when
a situation came up requiring the mechanics skills, something no one
had, one of my players asked if they could use JOT.

My first reaction was that you couldn\'t use JOT to repair a damaged
sensor system, as that was quite a specialized job, but I decided to
show some leeway, and allow the player a roll.  Realizing that we hadn\'t
played all too much, I went through the procedure for JOT, asking what
his skill level was, plus half the applicable attribute to get a target
number.

What I found out was that this player had put many skill levels into JOT
during chargen, and had come out with a skill level of SIX!  Jack of all
Trades at SIX!  Not wanting to slow down game play, and make him make
mid-game changes to his character, we went along through the game, and
it became clear that this player was quitw a powerhouse.  With an
average stat of as low as seven (his are higher than that due to some
lucky rolls) it still makes his average TN with JOT a whopping 10 (9.5
rounded up) meaning that he\'ll suceed using his JOT roll on most avergae
and even some formidable rolls!

I decided immediately after to place a cap of JOT-3 in my campaigns,. as
well as limit the extents of what players can use the skill for to
non-professional skilsl only.  This downplays it being able to become a
powerhouse munchkin skill.

1)Did the builders of the octagon not notice your revised room just
under the lowest floor they constructed?  If so why?  If the fusion
heater could fall through to this room it would seem that they would
have found it laying the foundation.  (BTW this is not an attack on your
idea--its just that I\'m interested and I want to understand.)  Was this
room built after the octagon was complete and the builders gone by the
"Droynes that were not in the base"?  Where these Droynes still living
in the wilderness around the octagon?

2)  Who built the catacombs and the well?  These Droyne?  Others?

3) Why did they wall off the passage to "the door" and build the large
barred wood door separating the well and the door?   It seems these
Droyne would want to rejoin the others, not seal them away.

I\'m merciless I know but allow me to pick your brain one more time--How
much easier this would be if I had Zho. blood!

Thanks to all for your ideas.  I hope that someday some of mine will be
of use to you.

	True... Actually it\'s not such a bad idea. Water would be available 
from oceans, most gas giants (at least on some level of gas giants 
there\'s H2O rain) and comets. The down side would be it couldn\'t be 
used as emergency fuel for extra G-hours.

	Yup. I\'m still using FFS1 with Brilliant Lances, with a twist: On 
most ships, the fusion power plant is specifically designed so that 
is can be used as a fusion rocket of equivalent size, allowing for 
longer interplanetary trips.

	However, the bright flare of a fusion rocket is a sure way to
invite every pirate in the system...

	Wouldn\'t this inefficiency be countered by higher technology? Or 
does this happen at only at TL 17+? I\'d imagine a TL 9 Jump-1 drive 
could be inefficient enough to consume five times its volume in LHyd, 
but a TL 16 Jump-1 ?

There was a largish discussion on this several months ago. What I tend to
do is roll the damage dice for the weapon (all of them), remove the highest
dice for armour, and then apply the next 3 highest dice as damage.

Some examples will (hopefully) make the above a bit clearer. Bob shoots
James with a cP005, which has a damage rating of 5D. James, luckily, is
wearing Diplo (armour rating of 3). The damage rolled by Bob, in order, is
6,5,4,4,2. Removing the highest three dice (for armour) leaves 4 and 2,
which is applied as normal.

If Bob now shoots James with something that does 8D damage, and rolls
6,5,5,4,4,3,2,1, the 6 and two 5\'s are removed (armour), and the next three
highest (4, 4, 3) are applied as damage. The 2 and the 1 are wasted.

Note that these examples ignore blunt damage (which I cant remember if is
in the rules or not). Also, some people take armour into consideration
before rolling the dice.

[eg: in the first example, because James is wearing Diplo armour, only two
dice are rolled. In the second example, "only" 5 dice are rolled, and the
highest three tallied.]

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Jason

MR. SNEAD!! (sounds great when you say in a Capt. Hook sort of way)
I was just pointing out the only place I saw a listing of such
a high Terrain TL. Forgive me it was late at night. But if you read
the rest of that post, I indicated the FFS has a lower TL threshhold
for Genering and cybernetics. This change brings major chunks of 
Rats and Cats into Cannon Tech Level wise, IMHO.

Of course he makes the same roll as similarly talented medical-3,
at a -2.  Hardly the kind of absolut distinction that you are
talking about and not the kind of chasm that talent is unable
to gap.

Well, as I\'ve said before, as far as I\'m concerned someone with only
average talent is the lowest I would even consider for a doctor and
and _is_ mediocre.  Also, rolling at a -2 is hardly a miniscule
chance.  To get what you describe, one must not allow a roll
at all below skill-3.

Well, as I, and others have said, there a those who simply don\'t
agree.

I don\'t.  I\'m just pointing out that if the difference between Medical-1
and open heart surgery is as great as you describe, then it is rediculous
for anyone to try it.  But you are really just saying it\'s big enough
that only skill can bridge it, which is just another way of saying
that, in your opinion, skill counts for more than talent.  That\'s
fine.  I just don\'t happen to agree. But this doesn\'t make skill+
stat objectively absurd, it just is absurd to you.

>	Again, you\'re focusing narrowly on the Med-n example

You are the one who was focusing on it.  Generally, I just don\'t
agree that skill counts for more than talent.

If they put out a M1100 supplement I\'m shure most people on the list will
buy it unseen and then when they see all the gross errors (Spinward marches
completely redone, not even hexlocations the same) they\'ll start filling
the listservers.

I\'m only halfjoking and I think that given the lack of background knowledge
posessed by the IG authors they\'d better stick with items far in time from
M1100 such as Aslan border wars (that ought to be fun), Interstellar Wars
(thank god Nilsen et al didn\'t do that one) or my favourite The (first)
Civil war with no genocide, nuking of planets etc just snobby fleet
admirals clashing it out all over the galaxy and lots of noble derring do,
jumping from balconies, hiding under the beds of laadies etc -> Traveller
the Swashbuckler Era.

These skill divisions always seem to come from some one group or other
feeling that their particular work is looked down upon. I\'d say that the
usefulness of skills and the entire RPG goes DOWN when more skill types are
added.
Why doesn\'t somebody mention the fact that there isn\'t a skill for Duck
hunting or Life support maintenance or Vargr written pornography etc. If
you feel a PC/NPC shoould be very good at nursing but totally lacking in
surgery skills etc give him/her Medic-4 but note that it should be treated
as Medic-0 in pharmacy, surgery tasks.
The same note goes for Recon and Hunting: What is really the usefulness of
dividing them up? One skill type that REALLY need to be broken up long
before the medical ones above is Streetwise. It can be used to find dealers
in illegal stuff, reaction modifier when talking with bad guys, detection
of tailing, identifying controlled substances (by tasting them as all cops
in Hollywood seem to do) etc. I\'d say we don\'t break any of them up but
instead put our energy into defining tasks for them so that as little as
possible need to be dreamt up ad hoc.

All the above holds up to about TL 9 I think. In computer development we
have seen an ongoing trend both in performance increases and in harware
abstraction. The old crude Solomani language Java which ran on an abstract
CPU made the Solomani comps totally hardware independent sometime in their
early 21:st century. Then came the abstract state machines etc. All
Solomani computers work together as does all Vilani, Zhodani etc given more
or less the same TL. The big hurdle is cross-race-compatability. One of the
main reason the idiot Solomani failed in their so called empire was their
insistence in converting to the Solomani computational model. When Vilani
were forced to adopt their smooth running (for milennia) bureocracies grind
to a halt and started to fall of the Ramshacle Empire.

You shoot at other things besides humans and there it would help. Vehicles
and large animals would have larger max damages right? And the 3D max
damage is after armour calculations I think. the 3D maxdamage is a very

There is lots of nifty info on railguns here.  The top speed they list for
railguns which might be usable by the military is 4-6 km/sec.  That\'s
pretty damn fast, but still somewhat reasonable.  However, the person I
got the URL from said that the folks building these things are making
other ones which are warehouse sized.  These ultravelocity railguns are
being made both to see how fast they can get one, and for possible use in
fusion research (to accelerate deuterium pellets...)

The test this individual saw had a small projective accelerated to _0.15
C_, [yep almost 1/6 the Speed of Light] (into vacuum, the 0.15 C was only
muzzle velocity, the vacuum was not thin enough to let it travel far at
that speed).  The goal of the project is to accelerate a small projective
to 0.5 C. 
	
This exists *now*.  Maybe lasers & Meson guns aren\'t the best weapons... 
A few 0.15-0.5 C gauss cannons on a ship would do wonders in a battle. 

I want my ship to have one of these things.  At 0.15 C an impact would

Why the jumpfuel is a big question for Traveller and I think as sseveral
others on the list that the coolant explanation/handwave is a bit
unbelievable. AS J-fuel requirement is such a big issue in both military
and civilian ship design a lot of research must have been spent to improve

So displacement to refers to jumpfuel mass and the term fuel is a

All hinges on efficiency. If yoy can accelerate matter with less loss than
lsers then railguns are preferrable if you get close to C and by close I
mean real close like 0.9C or something. At 0.5 C youd get 50% longer
lightlag compared to laser (radiation to sensor + beam to target). This
allows the target to evade for 50% more time which give it about twice the
uncertainty radius and thus four times tha angular area of the uncertainty
disk where to place your shots. Pretty much worse I\'d say and therefore
you\'ll have to stick close to C.

Well, i\'d think not quite legal, as it already is in violation of 
copyright and falls out of the for owners use only category, 
however it would be so minor that i think nobody would care... Nobody 
looses the copyright because one page out of a book is copied and 
nobody is goinjg to sue because of it (although in the states they

Take a look at:  http://www.utexas.edu/research/cem/sd03/el.html

There is lots of nifty info on railguns here.  The top speed they list for
railguns which might be usable by the military is 4-6 km/sec.  That\'s
pretty damn fast, but still somewhat reasonable.  However, the person I
got the URL from said that the folks building these things are making
other ones which are warehouse sized.  These ultravelocity railguns are
being made both to see how fast they can get one, and for possible use in
fusion research (to accelerate deuterium pellets...)

The test this individual saw had a small projective accelerated to _0.15
C_, [yep almost 1/6 the Speed of Light] (into vacuum, the 0.15 C was only
muzzle velocity, the vacuum was not thin enough to let it travel far at
that speed).  The goal of the project is to accelerate a small projective
to 0.5 C. 
	
This exists *now*.  Maybe lasers & Meson guns aren\'t the best weapons... 
A few 0.15-0.5 C gauss cannons on a ship would do wonders in a battle. 

I want my ship to have one of these things.  At 0.15 C an impact would
cause radiation damage and large clouds of plasma.

Why the jumpfuel is a big question for Traveller and I think as sseveral
others on the list that the coolant explanation/handwave is a bit
unbelievable. AS J-fuel requirement is such a big issue in both military
and civilian ship design a lot of research must have been spent to improve
it and the fact that it stays flat until about TL 17 seem to imply that
something less tweakable than cooling has to be at work. Someone (Hans
Rancke-Madsen?) mentioned the jump mass displacement or something. A
certain mass has to be dumped at jump entry (otherwise drop tanks wouldn\'t
work) and the efficiency goes way diown as the atomic mass of the stuff
goes up thus the use of hydrogen. Or there might be the special properties
that the single proton nucleus has thus the bonus for purified fuel (no
Deuterium, Helium etc). The term jump displacement mass was used in early
Solomani experiments and got so common that the term displacement ton

So displacement to refers to jumpfuel mass and the term fuel is a

Nope. If a gas is above its "critical temperature" *no* amount of
pressure will liquefy it. For example, it\'s impossible to have liquid
water at a temp above 370C. 

The critical temp for H2 is under 100K....

Easy. Aside from the fact that LH2 *will* be denser than compressed H2,
there\'s the small matter of hydrogen molecules being so small that they
tend to *leak* through tiny cracks or even diffuse right through
metals. 

Also, hydrogen that diffuses into metal tends to make it brittle.

LH2 is the easiest way to store *large* amounts of hydrogen.

	1) if you\'re a jealous and vengeful old-testament GM, have the
player impaled, drawn and quatered, burned, and shot.  Unfortunately, at

  Hmm, from memory that is one area that isn\'t covered too well. I would
suggest looking at the new price for the item, and taking a percentage of that
based on how badly damaged the part is.

  So, if the drives are worth say 8MCr, and they have minor damage (say 5%),
then it might take 400,000 Cr to fix. Repair time is really guess work though,
pick a number that floats by :-). Of course depending on their engineering, 
you might let them jury rig something up so as to do it cheaper. Maybe even 
let them use second hand parts at half price. This makes it more fun because 
the bodgied part might be a bit temperamental, failing when they can least 
afford it

  Yes, TNE had a damage/maintenance level. Another source which I just
recently picked up is Star War\'s (gasp, sorry the opposition) Tramp Freighters
book. It has a huge amount of info on tweaking and jury rigging ships. It also
has some fun stuff on things getting temperamental when they are fiddled too
much - you know the Millenium Falcon\'s hyperdrive not activating when the
button is punched, but then kicking in 30 seconds later sort of thing. I am
going to try and convert this over to T4 sometime. When I do, I will post it.

Zero-level skills are those listed as default skills on page 38. 
Page 37 has a couple of paragraphs on Default (Level-0) Skills.

Hope this helps.

> Thanks for information

The muzzle velocity of a .357 magnum rnages from 1400 fps with a 158 
grain bullet to 1900 fps with a 125 grain bullet - for factory loads 
in 8+ inch barrels. Handloads would go a bit higher.

For the metric users there are 3.28 feet in a metre, and approx. 15.4 
grains in a gram.

At 1900 fps the .357 is the fastest commercial pistol round, aside 
from some specialty varmint and sillouette rounds (and .308 
Winchester chambered sillouette pistols). A .44 magnum is the next 
fastest at 1625fps with a 240 grain bullet.

With riles things are a bit more ambigous, as there are some very hot 
wildcat cartirdges out there. Amoug standard commercial loads the .17 
Remington makes 4040 fps with a 25 grain bullet (very light), the 
.220 Swift 4111 fps with a 55 grain bullet (fairly heavy for this 
calibre), and the .300 Weatherby magnum 3900 fps with a 110 grain 
bullet (light for a .308 calibre weapon). Remington makes a 
discarding sabot round for some .308 calibre rounds, which fire a 
.224 (5.56 mm) 55 grain bullet (the same as the .220 Swift\'s) at up 
to 4080 fps (using the .30-06\'s stats).

Note that all these stats are from the manufacturers, and thus it\'s a 
good bet that you can knock off about 200 fps still be a little high. 
Also in any calibre the Weatherby Magnums almost always have the 
hottest performance (among factory loads).

This reminds me of an idea I had for a campaign inspired by Babylon 5, 
basically because those big Earthforce destroyers with the rotating 
sections look really cool. It would even work if the technology of 
gravitics had just recently been discovered and only worked on smaller ships
i.e. scouts and small traders. Fun fun fun for all those adventure groups 
out there as this is the point when small ships really become practical 
for more than a short period of time. Well anything smaller than a Lab 
ship as this is only ship I\'ve ever seen than operates without grav for 
long perios of time (when its in orbit to save power).

BTW does anyone know if FF&S supports alternative technologies like the 
original does as I quite like FTL comms and other such non cannon stuff.

   Actually, I would imagine that the Vilani were even more animistic
   than the Terrans they first encountered.  The cause of animism has
   nothing to do with the genetic relationship between the worshipper and
   his totem; animists routinely worship rock formations, mountains,
   astronomical bodies, and waterfalls in addition to animals and plants.
   Animism is no less prevalent in harsh environments than in congenial
   ones.  One can surmise from CT sources (the short adventure "Divine
   Intervention") that the Vilani of M1100 (and, therefore, of the Ziru
   Sirka as well, given a strong conservatism) worshiped stars, which is
   a sort of animism.  One could also easily imagine that the shaman-like
   millers of Vilani society would be tempted to give animistic
   interpretations to their activities, driving the beligerent spirits
   out of the food and invoking benevolent spirits to settle into it.

   This outlook will depend strongly on the details of how the Vilani
   managed to survive in their alien environment.  They may have only
   hung on by filling a very small and tight ecological niche on Vland.
   The delicacy of this ecological balance may have made them very much
   aware of the dangers caused by change, and may have severely inhibited
   the trait of adaptability which is so distinctive of humans on earth.
   All this could foster an inborn predilection to conservatism.

The key is that the stat-12 skill-1 person will be better at things
that skill _shares_ with skill-4.  That\'s why I like setting task
level based on what skill level performs that task routinely.  As
far as I\'m concerned many skill-1 people shouldn\'t have a snowballs

person (a small chance, though, these are PCs :-).

The 3D limit is only for _unarmored_ human targets hit with somple ball
ammunition, anything else takes all the damage(as does any other type of
ammunition). Why so much damage? To get through battledress, car doors,
buildings, etc. of course. 

How you count the damage is really up to you and how damaging you want
combat to be. Me, I would score it as you roll all the dice, and you keep
the high scores, unless the targets are armored, in which case you roll
all the dice, get through the armor, and add up the highest three dice of 
what\'s left(or whatever\'s left, period, if it\'s three or fewer dice).

Serves \'em right for getting into firefights with gauss rifles ;-)

If only you could see what I\'ve seen with _my_ eyes. :)  It\'s not an

Sheesh!  Doesn\'t anybody listen around here?  (rhetorical)

That reminds me, for those of you who have written me offline to ask
privately for my sources, I apologize.  I never meant this to be torture
for anyone.  But if you consider, for me to do what you ask, I would have
the time to get everything compiled, with the accompanying analysis, and
then I could send it to you.  Right now, everything is a compilation of
fragments.  If I _could_ get the references off to you, I would just post
them to the list.  Another week on something that _few_ of us cared about
two weeks ago is not going to hurt anyone.

Mark your calendars for July 10th (and that is being generous, but I\'ll

About the maximum you\'ll be able to achieve is around 4500m/sec.  At that
point the round will begin to melt from the heat.

Most modern sniper rifles have velocities in the 750-850m/sec range.  The
RAI-500 .50cal has a MV of nearly 900m/sec.

In the years of the beginning of the potato famine in Ireland there was a

incursion of their Irish cousins escaping Hunger.

One intrepid Scotsman had an idea.  The Scots would send food relief in the
form of a meal so disgusting and gross that the Irish would be convinced to
stay far away from Scotland, and in fact flee to America instead.

So they took blood and intestines, guts and organs and boiled it up in a
big pot.  To this they added oatmeal, for texture, and put the whole mess
in a sheep\'s stomach for good measure (some thought that was a wee bit over
the top).

And that\'s how Haggis was invented.

Excuse me?  First of all, I do have a life.  Quite a full one.  I work ten
hours a day, deal with cancer recovery, and am in the process of buying a
car.  None of this prevented me from grabbing two books off my shelf,
spending ten minutes doing some very basic research and simple maths, and
finding several sources clearly pointing to a RoM tech of 12/early 13.  You
are apparently unable to something this simple without complaining about
your horrendous schedule.

I take the above as a personal attack.  I have shown my case, backed it up
with references from GDW material, and in exchange I\'m told to "get a life."

How petty can you get?

You haven\'t said *anything*, except to make wild-ass claims that you refuse
to defend in the slightest.. when called on it, you whine about your
schooling and being pressured, and then sulk and bitch about your
detractors.  This is a list populated by adults who all share a love of the
game Traveller and its background.. You think that we don\'t disagree with
each other?  You should have seen the fighter debate, or the wars over
Virus a few years back.  

In none of the discussions or flame wars I have seen or been involved in
here has there ever been someone with your attitude.  You seem to think
that you\'re being oh-so-clever with this ploy of making us all wait for
your announcement.  Guess what?  All you are doing is pissing people off.

Post which books you are using for this bizarre claim.  No quotes, not even
the pages, just tell us where you have canonical evidence of the RoM
possessing TL16 as a common TL.  We can look it up.

I don\'t think you can do it, since I\'m convinced that you are only a troll,
trying to look important by starting an arguement.

Post, or shut up.

To the rest of the list:  Sorry for my tone, but I am sick and tired of

You have insulted all of us.  There are people on this list whom I dislike.
 I still read their posts, and even when they disagree with me I don\'t sink
to your level.

There is a precedent for trouble-makers being dropped from the list.. when

I have found no way to do this except the hard way;  Go over the stats of
each planet involved and make some obvious guesses and/or develop the
system\'s environment in an abstract manner (no need to go through the long
process of Scouts or WBH, just start making assumptions).

101 Cargos, partly reprinted in JTAS 26(?or 27?) has a trading system as
good as (or a bit better than) any of the others, plus a lot of good ideas
for cargo lots.  Most are adventures in themselves, others spin off really
good ideas for more mundane cargos.

If you have the time and are inspired, examine a cluster of planets and
determine abstractly some logical economic relationships.  An obvous
example is an Agricultural world next to an asteroid belt or otherwise
nonagricultural high pop world.  The players can always rely on getting a
small profit (since the route is so regular, prices are low) speculative
cargo on the agric world to go to the hipop world.  Similar relationships
exist betwen high and low tech worlds, water worlds and vacuum worlds, etc.

Population works well as the driving factor in cargo availability.  Worlds
with populaitons over 6 should always be able to provide cargos in my
opinion.  It is ridiculous that in some of the trade systems a Pop 3 or 4
planet provides as much available cargo as a pop 9 or A planet.

I usually determine the most likely cargos for a given world and generate
them according to the lot size and price rules for the system I\'m using (Jo
Grant\'s from 101 cargos, specifically, or Glen Hoppe\'s  from his Craft MT
Hypercard Stack (for Mac) which is the MT system).  I then get a bunch of
"random" cargos to round things out, discarding any that do not fit the
planet\'s characteristics as I\'ve interpreted them.  Always I turn
"Electronic Parts" into "Handheld Game LCD screens" or somesuch.
Specificity is a very important aspect, and almost impossible to automate.

Developing a cluster is truly the best modelling you can do.  One planet\'s
economy is dramatically effected by the ones nearest it (as far as the
import/export business is concerned) and players will look for rumors of
what imports are good for what planets. they intend to visit.  Wherever
they go the players in my campaing deal with a "friendly neighborhood
commodities dealer" who finds them cargos for a commission (based on
purchase price) and tries to sell them stuff they may or may not be able to
sell at their next stop (although grudges and loss of business keep them
mostly honest).

Do not go too deep into the planet.  you\'ll spend a lot of time designing a
planet the players never visit.  At the moment I have contropl over the
players such that they will not be leaving the immediate vicininty (The
Traveller Adventure sees to that), find a way to do this using the clues
and plot of the underlying plot.

Do not forget that a system has the mainworld and several other planets
which can be exploited for their resources.  Gas mining on the Gas
Giant(s), ice mining in the asteroid belts, collecting heavy metals from
the surface of mercurial planets, etc. can provide other cargos for
out-of-system shipping.

Hope this gives you some ideas.  I have a list somewhere of specific cargo
names (such as "Groats, Live" or "Yucca Root, Powdered" as examples.  It is
incomplete, but might be useful.

   Well that clears up one mystery.  I vaugely recalled it being stated
somewhere in some fashion, but eventually concluded that it was one of
those bits of canon that was just sort of worked out amongst the general
populace.  Unfortunately that reference doesn\'t tell us how extensive TL
13 had spread (a few worlds or common high tech).  So was TD #17
published before or after 1987?  It could be that it is superceded by
MegaTraveller.

   This makes two things vitally important:

1) Marc needs to get up to speed on what has been published before on
the subject.

2) Marc needs to make an official ruling as to exactly what the max TL
of the RoM was and let everyone know what his decision is and the
rationale behind it.

   Note: Now would be a good time for those who are concerned with this
issue to post what bits of evidence they have to the list so that Marc
can be better informed.  Were I in Marc\'s shoes, I would appreciate
bibliographic citations so that I don\'t have to rumage through
everything, and it would be nice to be able to interpret passages myself
rather than relying on someone\'s less than biased opinion.

   Note: Now is not the time for political propaganda designed to fog
the issue or nattering designed to get Marc to change canon.  Let\'s get
the evidence out there and let him make up his own mind.

Ye lads ever hear of the Calidonian Principality? A little known pocket 
empire that settled in Reavers Deep Sector in which most of the populace is 
of Solomani/Scottish decent?  They beat back the Reavers during the night 
and still managed to be independent by 1100!  The Thisle bows not to even 
the Starburst!

IIRC Traveller Chronicle did an article on the Caledon subsector a while 
back.  And they were mentioned in Far Traveller (FASA?) #2.

Scotsmen not Traveller, indeed! :-)

of the barrel, the weight of the bullet, and how hot a load you are
using. (To further obfusticate matters, your most accurate load in a
given weapon is liable to be far, far below your super-max hot killer
one). As a happy medium for gaming purposes, however, a plain vanilla
158-grain bullet seems to move roughly 1200 fps out of a 6" test barrel,
according to my Speer reloading manual. 

A superhot .44 Mag load will move a 240-grain bullet about 1400 fps, but
an ordinary person will have difficulty controlling the thing even in
the beefiest of handguns. I have not yet heard of any smallbore or
magnum handgun with a muzzle veolcity of greater than 1600 fps out of a
pistol barrel, although there are long-barreled (12" or so) single-shot
pistols that fire moderate-power rifle cartridges.

The highest muzzle velocity of any PRACTICAL 20th-century firearm is the
22-250 Swift, which poops out a 40-grain bullet at 4000 fps even. The
biggest round to give you 3000 fps+ out of a rifle barrel (the de facto
\'high velocity\' benchmark) is the .340 Weatherby Magnum, which sends a
200-grainer at 3260 fps... but that is a superpowered magnum guaranteed
to rip your arm off. I hate Weatherbies, and consider that whole family
of cartridges to be of very little real-world value. (A sniper in
battledress might find it ideal, however).

For role-playing purposes, I can tell you that such a cartridge would
leave very little of the torso of the human being it shot; it\'s more
along the lines of a lightweight elephant gun. Anybody shot with a gauss
rifle on full-auto is going to simply explode (in ALL directions, not
merely away from the shot) like a big bag of Jell-O, and be dripping off
the walls and ceiling, with perhaps a few identifiable body parts and
bone chips and scraps of armor laying around. In zero-G, the mess will
be even worse (obscuring the vision until they can wipe the blood off,
and perhaps acting as an anti-laser aerosol for a bit. Gross, but
effective). 

I once shot a gallon milk jug full of tap water from 40 yards away with
a 25-06, and it blew small white pieces of plastic all over the yard and
created a perfect wet spot on the hillside 30\' across like a heavy dew
had come down. And an acquaintance pf mine knows of a slob hunter who
shot a big bull elk in the chest with a .375 H&H magnum -- both front
legs were blown completely off from the impact. This is a 400-lb. animal
being hit by a 300-grain softnose slug at about 2400 fps. So if you
wanna be \'realistic\', bear ALL of this firmly in mind.

Frankly, I know of no design-your-own-bullshittium wannabe-realistic
game design system that distinguishes between conventional and magnum
rounds, but if you like I can provide you with representative samples in
energy, bullet weight, and velocity in any existing cartridge, along
with cartridge dimensions. Suffice it to say I\'ve tried to design some
of the rifles and rounds I own using an FF&S Excel spreadsheet, and all
have been grotesquely off-base.... hence my increasing disenchantment
with the hopelessly anal-retentive notion of trying to reconcile game
design and \'real-world\' engineering.

My personal peccadillos aside, I hope some of this info comes in handy.

I assume that the Saga is flawed in a few aspects (remember the story of
Troy and Shlieman\'s (if this is the way to write it), the fact that he used
Homer story doesn\'t mean that the actions described therein are all true).
I assumed that the Droynes that were not in the base rapidly lost
civilization, slowly turning to the Chirpers aspect after a few generations.
They slowly died away.  I determined that the ruins of a city could be found
somewhere else under the dirt (with multiple layers of chirper bones
everywhere).  Among these bones could be found human bones from the
servants.  These servants were disposed off when they became a nuisance.  

As to the room under the octagon, it was built a few centuries after the
base was "abandonned".  The ceiling fell because of water infiltration in
recent years that ate away at the stone, destroying the work of the original
Droynes.  The building of the Octagon was not something the original Droynes
had thought of.  In fact, the location was perfect for their ceremonies
since, even after the knoledge of the base had been lost, the area remained
somehow sacred.  The same location was perfect also for the building of a
shelter by the octagon society founders.  The building caused small fissures
(I hope this is also a word in english) or cracks in the stone that caused
water infiltration in the caves and sealed rooms below.  

>2)  Who built the catacombs and the well?  These Droyne?  Others?

I never found an answer to that question.  I hope the players I have going
through this scenario (the third group I run through it) will not attempt to
find an explanation :-))  I suggest however that the catacombs were built
through many centuries by the population of Droynes (then Chirpers).  I
suggest that a close examination of the walls will reveal that they have
been built by "hands".  If you consider the huge size of these catacombs,
your players should be sufficiently impressed by the time it took to build them.

>3) Why did they wall off the passage to "the door" and build the large
>barred wood door separating the well and the door?   It seems these
>Droyne would want to rejoin the others, not seal them away.

I don\'t have an answer for that one.  Think of the fact that these Droynes
must have been aware of the destruction that occured everywhere.  They must
have been awed by the sheer power of the war.  If they decided to find
refuge in the forest (because they thought they would be attacked perhaps),
then they could have been blocked from the base.  I assume that they sealed
it because they didn\'t know how to operate it.   I will have to think about
that one I must admit.

Thank you for your questions, you are asking questions that I should have
asked myself before (at least three times anyway!!!)

I own almost every book evey published about traveller but I must say I am
missing the second book of the Skyraider trilogy.  Could anyone give me
enough information so that I can use it for my group the next time.  The
last time I gm\'ed it, I decided that the action occured in the Old Expenses
sector.  What a great scenario.  I believe however that the best traveller
adventure was the one found in The MegaTraveller Journal 4 and entitled
"Lords of Thunder".

Feel free to define tasks for any and everything!  I\'d love to see us all
share a ton of tasks all posted in here.  However, I\'ll still keep my more
detailed skill list, thank you, and I don\'t really like the idea of
defining *anything* so ridgedly that "as little as possible need to be

Grav plates need a source of gravity to push against - so they\'d be of 
little use in an asteroid belt (perhaps a milligee of acceleration.) You\'d
want a air/raft modified with thruster plates, or (for the cheapskate)
chemical rockets. (In fact, the mines might have grav sensors to detect
thruster plates - PCs would have to approach using chemical rockets, which
is *very* slow. The mines might also have neutrino sensors, so they\'d have
to shut down their fusion plants...the PCs would have to move their ship to
10000km or so, deccelerate with chemical rockets (strap-on solids mounted
on the hull), go accross in spacesuits...and then if they set off a mine
they\'d have a minute or so (as it deploys its targeting sensors and rotates
to aim the lasers at the ship) to desperately slip away on their suit jets,
bring up the power on the ship so they can evade or fire back...the mines
would also have sensors to detect weapons fire and fire back; and would 
probably be indistinguishable from rocks at ranges greater than 10000km or so.
(Feel free to twiddle the ranges to make things exciting - the goal is to make
sure the players just don\'t laser the mines from well outside the mines
weapon range.) Some mines might be full-fledged missiles with working
drives that would lunge towards the PC spaceship when a first mine detects
it or detonates...

I always use for new groups.  It is a very open ended adventure that allows
for a large campaign with small adventures in the middle.  It is perfect for
a group of players that has been traumatized (;-)) by AD&D and GMs that can
only create dungeon crawls...

That\'s off the continuing-time list, isn\'t it? 

The idiot who\'s posting it is completely, totally, 100% wrong. THe Texas
railgun stuff is real - velocities of a few km/s - but relativistic railguns
do not currently exist and are unlikely to in the near, or far, future.

Important lesson: never trust anything you hear on the \'net. Especially if
someone posts something unbelievable (0.5 c railguns), has bad spelling and
grammar, makes obvious scientific errors (he didn\'t think elements could
burn, and didn\'t think carbon was an element) and is contradicted by
several knowledgeable-sounding people.

    'body' => 'Since a couple of people asked, here are my TL9/non-grav shuttle designs
(original FFS):

- ----
As an exercise (and to go with some starship designs I\'m working on) I 
tried to design TL 9- (TL 9 without contragrav) ground-to-orbit shuttles.
It mostly worked, without breaking the FFS rules more than slightly.
The only major difference in fact was that I used the real delta-V
formula rather than the simplified FFS one
(see http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/thrusters.html, especially the
article from cyhiggin@usa.pipeline.com, though her transfer orbit
formula looks wrong to me.) I did use FFS engines (see below.)
Ways in which the design changes with alternative rules, or CG, are also 
discussed at the end.

TL-8 versions of these designs would look almost identical; if anyone is
really interested in the subtle differences I can post them.

The one major difference to published TNE rules is of course the delta-V
to orbit. The TNE rule-book number-of-G-hours to orbit, as has been noted,
are completely wrong. Delta V from earth\'s surface to a 150km orbit
is 8.00 km/s. (Not 0.64 G-hours, which is 22.5 km/s.) Getting back
from orbit requires much less delta-V, too; all you have to do is
change your orbit so it scrapes the atmosphere more, and then aerobrake
(like the Space Shuttle does.) This raises total delta-V to 8.04 km/s.
If you start near the equator delta-V goes down; 7.64 km/s is the figure
I used, appropriate for a 30-degree inclination takeoff. 
For a size 9 world of normal density delta-V is 8.52 km/s, for a size 7, 6.72
km/s.

These are delta-V in a vacuum and assuming very high instantaneous 
acceleration. Real atmosphere and gravity complicate this somewhat. 
FFS talks about non-CG spacecraft using 1-g of their thrust to negate 
gravity until they reach orbit, which is spectacularly nonsensical, even by GDW
standards. *Anything* that\'s moving is in an orbit; a thrown baseball is
in an orbit - just a *very* long and skinny elliptical orbit that 
happens to intersect the Earth\'s surface. The trick for a rocket is to
make sure your orbit never actually reaches the ground. For finite
accelerations this means some amount of delta-V is spent going upwards as the
spacecraft lifts off, which is less efficient than a pure Hohmann
transfer orbit. In addition, you lose delta-V due to atmospheric friction.
Together these add about 1.5 km/s to the delta-V requirements for a classical
rocket, and require that the takeoff acceleration be significantly higher
than 1G.

The shuttle designs below are horizontal-takeoff designs which use their
airbreathing AZHRAE engines for takeoff and to climb to high altitudes
(and, in the case of the first design, for some extra delta-V.) This is similar
to the (now-cancelled) X-30 Aerospace Plane. This approach has been pretty
much abandoned in the real world, but FFS makes it easier to design than
most other single-stage-to-orbit designs (see below.) It also means that
the acceleration required of the engine is only 1G (or even less.) I\'ve
allowed 0.6 km/s delta-V for remaining atmosphere drag (8.1 km/s round trip
to 150-km orbit from 30 degrees latitude), which is typical for the Pegasus
air-launched rocket. There\'s a huge range of operational parameter space for 
these vehicles depending on the atmosphere, density and diameter of the world 
they\'re operating on; I\'ve designed for an Earthlike world.

Terminology for those who don\'t have FFS: AZHRAE is the acronym
for a combination turbojet/ramjet/rocket engine. HRF is hydrogen
rocket fuel. HCD is hydrocarbon distillates (petrochemical fuels.)
EAPlaC is the incredibly efficient solid-rocket-like TL-9 engine in FFS,
normally used in missiles.

Passenger Accommodations: 14 adequate seats
Cargo: 140 m^3 (120 tonnes)with one large cargo hatch

Notes/operating mode:
  The shuttle takes off and lands like an aircraft. It uses 4 minutes of 
turbojet fuel to take off and climb, then fires the ramjets for 2.2 
minutes, accelerating to 0.64 km/s and punching through most of the
atmosphere, then firing the rockets for the rest of the trip to orbit.
It de-orbits with a brief rocket burn (0.05 km/s), aerobrakes like the
shuttle, glides most of the way to its landing sight, then activates
the turbojets for the last part of the landing. Enough turbojet fuel
is available for four minutes of full thrust at landing, but since it
weighs much less while landing and doesn\'t need to run the engines at
full thrust it can run for more than half an hour at 350km/h during 
landing, a comfortable safety margin.

  Operating costs are dominated by fuel (HRF costs Cr 1000
per m3.) Cost to orbit for commercial service would therefore be around
Cr 10,000 per tonne of cargo and 2,000 per passenger (possibly somewhat
less if there is enough traffic that shuttles always fly full both to
and from orbit.) Compare to the EAPlaC disposable discussed below - 
shuttles would probably only be used for people and fragile/urgent cargoes.

material volume, and requires a minimum acceleration of 0.5G, which the
turbojets satisfy.) 
The AZHRAE engine burns hydrogen in its airbreathing modes rather than 
hydrocarbons. Since hydrogen is so bulky, it\'s no longer efficient to use 
the AZHRAE engine for any delta-V beyond that needed for takeoff and landing,
but this makes the shuttle completely field-refuellable.

The shuttle normally starts in orbit, carried by a starship. It de-orbits
(0.05 km/s delta-V) and aerobrakes, then glides towards a carefully pre-
selected landing site. It activates the turbojets for 5 minutes at
0.1 G (350 km/h) to find the landing site, then 3 minutes of hovering at
0.5 G for landing. Vertical takeoff uses another 2 minutes of 0.5 G, then 5.5 
minutes of full thrust are left to climb to altitude before firing the rockets.

For field refueling the shuttle would carry down a fission reactor
(60 tons) and then a fuel refining plant, modified to refine both 
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, and several fuel storage tanks.
Using some of its HRF tanks, and the cargo hold, for  plain liquid hydrogen 
the shuttle can carry 295 m^3 to a 150-km orbit.

Operating purely as an aircraft (with the HRF tanks full of hydrogen
for the turbojet) it has an endurance of about one hour, plus a margin for 
vertical takeoff and landing.

Since it only has one electronics operator, it can only operate a total of
two sensors or communicators at any time.


Notes:

FFS engines have low thrust-to-weight but also lower fuel consumption than
the Real World. This is actually an advantage for craft like this one which
have quite low accelerations. Using more realistic engines (see the URL
above) bites heavily into the payload; designs are available if anyone is
really interested.

One can argue that craft that aerobrake should have higher armor values
than normal craft, but one can also argue that AV=1 and especially the
internal structure is far heavier than real world craft needed, so I\'ve
just left it at AV=1.


EAPlaC:

   These designs don\'t use EAPlaC for a variety of reasons:
(1) I started with the exploration shuttle, which needed to be completely
field-refuellable.
(2) I wanted them to be basically practical at TL-8
(3) I wanted the commercial shuttle to emphasize rapid turnaround, thinking
that this would decrease operations costs. (I was wrong.) 
(4) Even though the rules implicitly assume EAPlaC rockets can be turned off
and re-ignited (unlike solid rockets in the real world), they\'re still a
type of solid, and no-one in their right mind uses solid rockets on a 
manned vehicle. (The NASA Space Shuttle is a case in point.)
(5) EAPlaC is poorly-explained magic, not extrapolated technology.

   However, EAPlaC has an *incredible* ISP. It\'s very tempting. If the safety 
considerations don\'t apply, TL-9 shuttles would probably at least use 
expendable strap-on EAPlaC boosters. A shuttle that gets part of its delta-V
4 ton (28 m^3) strap-on EAPlaC boosters can carry 390 tonnes into orbit at a
fuel cost of MCr 1; commercial shipping charges would be about Cr 2500 per 
tonne.

   Additionally, pure EAPlaC unmanned rockets would almost certainly dominate
the bulk cargo market, where safety is irrelevant. A 100-ton unmanned 
disposable EAPlaC cargo carrier can carry 1280 tonnes into orbit, and costs
MCr 0.42! It\'s so cheap - dominated by fuel costs - that it\'s not even worth
reusing. Commercial cost to orbit would be about Cr 500 per tonne.




The Real World:

   In the real world, SSTO\'s are unlikely to look like this. Partially this
is because we don\'t know how to make an AZHRAE engine, and partially it\'s
because of various details like landing gear that FFS doesn\'t model.
Without AZHRAE engines horizontal takeoff has no advantages and in fact
is a net disadvantage, because you have to design the wings and landing
gear to lift the whole loaded weight of the spacecraft, not the empty weight.

   Current SSTO paper designs are either VTHL (vertical-takeoff/horizontal 
landing) rocket takeoff/glide-landers, kind of like the Space Shuttle with no 
external  tank or boosters, or VTVL (vertical-takeoff/vertical landing) craft
which look a lot like 1950s science fiction and hover/land using thrust from
rocket engines (the DC-X and proposed follow-ons.) See sci.space.policy
and s.s.tech for perpetual debates as to which approach is better.
Neither works well with FFS engines. Also, a VTVL doesn\'t work very well
for a shuttle that starts in orbit - it has to land/hover while carrying 
all the (heavy) fuel it needs to get back into orbit. Realistic rather than
FFS engines are better for these high thrust-to-weight designs, but they\'re
still very hard to do (I suspect because the interior structure mass in FFS is
too high for small craft.)

I\'m comparing the effeciency with the main power plant.  The
idea that, at all TL\'s, a very high throughput reactor
would work at a lower efficiency seems reasonable.

Much of this stems from two definitions in T4, both of which use the same
abbreviation. DM can mean Die Modifier, or Die Roll Modifier. DM +2 means
increase the THROW +2 and then compare against the dice, or it means increase
the DICE roll +2 and compare against the required outcome.

I am proposing two distinct statements:

DM: +2 means throw the dice and then increase the result by +2.

RM: +2 means increase the target number (what you\'re rolling to get, etc) by
+2.

Both of these statements allow for statements like DM x2 or DM /2 (or I
suppose DM ^2).

(I thought of TM for Throw Modifier, but it sounded too much like Trade
Mark).

Now the problem is that RM or DM mean (or produce) the same net result if
phrased correctly. Do we scrap one, or do we retain the potential for each?

Yeah, but if you are talking about carring massive amounts of

the simplest way I can put this comes off of one page in the MT Ref\'s
Companion (pg 34).  Under the "Other Tech Level Notes" section, it shows
the RoM achieving TL12 in -2210.  My *assumption* is that this the
approximate year that the technolgy became the standard for RoM Naval
units, high-end civilan systems, etc.

In the 3I section of the same passage, it is noted that it takes from -150
to 300 for the 3I to progress from TL12 to TL13.. a period of 450 years.

Assuming that there is no significant difference in the advancement rate
between 2nd and 3rd Imperia, the RoM will achieve a coomon TL13 society in
- -1760.  Alas, this comes almost 100 years after Rats & Cats (pg22) states
that society had fractured badly, and 16 years after the recognized start
of the Long Night (-1776).

On terrafrorming:  At TL12, "Major terraforming projects covering thousands
of square kilometers become commonplace."  (MT Ref\'s Companion, pg 31.)
This is akin to turning the Sahara Desert into a grain basket, or draining
the Amazon river basin.

IT IS MY OPINION that the terraforming mentioned for TL16 and above refers
to the complete rebuilding of the world from the crust up.  It is
interesting to note that the one global project mentioned (it\'s name
escapes me) was only finished in modern times...

Hey Jeff--how about sharing "Return to Twilights Peak" with the list.
I\'m sure I would not be the only one interested in hearing your take on
"whats really going on" and "what happens next" in TP.

Also, just a tidbit for the JOT discussion.....even when I first
startred with CT way back when, JOT levels were never directly applied
as a DM.  They were use more as an indicator of how "well read" the
character was.  The higher the "skill level" the more likely the PC was
to know a bit about what he was trying to do.  It was the refs choice as
to what the final DM would be or even if the characters past experience
would even allow JOT to be applied.  If it was determined that the PC
might have come across a similar situation in the past the DM applied
was usually only the skill level divided by 3 or 4.  (by way of example:
a PC from a desert world would get significant help from JOT skill for
surviving desert conditions even if he had no survival skills--however
the benefit from the same level of JOT would be almost negligable in
underwater welding (any benefit being dirived from something the PC read
at some time in the past at the refs discretion)

I have heard of several people who use GURPS as the ruleset for

GURPS background in Traveller.  I bought GURPS: Aliens, which is a book
of write ups on Aliens. Each Alien gets four pages, with some pictures
and a sample NPC.  Some of the races aren\'t very Traveller like, being
more like Star Trek or pulp sci-fi aliens. 
But some of them fit very well into a Traveller campaign.  I have
adapted the An-Pharr, Pachekki and two others, which I can\'t remember
the names of, as members races of the Hive Federation.  

Has anyone else done something like this? If anyone has the book and is
interested I have a conversion write up of the aliens.

Thanks, Mark. Actually, before I ever even saw any responses, I looked it
up at Joe Heck\'s site and found what I was looking for. Then I realized
what a fool I was and reread the assassination information in Rebellion
Sourcebook.

I jumped the gun when I asked this question. I should have checked a few
more of my references. Thanks to everyone for providing answers.

I\'d say stick with TM (aka: "Target Modifier").  "Trade Mark" is
hardly ever referred to in the rules text so I don\'t see how there can
be any confusion.  After all, DM sounds too much like "Dungeon Master"
and we still use *it*  :)

Hmmm... RPGs have traditionally gone with the method of modifying the
actual dice throw rather than the target number, if that is the sole
method of including modifiers (even though many roleplayers go ahead
and subtract a positive DM from the target number instead).

By modifying the DICE RESULT instead of the TARGET NUMBER, not only
can you make tasks easier or harder, but you can consult tables and
charts as well.  Tables can be referenced with DMs shifting up or down
a particular column.  This cannot be done using RMs (or TMs).

If you *do* decide to use only one definition/method, I\'d use the
"modify DICE RESULT" technique over the "modify TARGET NUMBER"
technique.  I\'d prefer both, however.

The rimward half of Far Frontiers was detailed by FASA in an issue of
_Different Worlds_ (sorry, don\'t have a number). It was reprinted in
several issues of _The Traveller Chronicle_. Most of FASA\'s adventures
took place on worlds in that area too.

A star map of Foreven was published in _Imperiallines_ #1. The sector was
laid out as a "Referee\'s Preserve" at the same time. The intention was
that no further official material would be published about it, so that
Referee\'s could feel free to do anything they liked there with no fear of
subesequent material contradicting it.

Some years ago Steve Higginbotham, Scott Kellogg, Arthur Green, Jurgen
Kirsh, and I began detailing Foreven and Beyond as a frontier area 
suitable for an exploration campaign. The work was never finished, but I
did do quite a lot of work on Foreven. The Beyond was drastically altered 
from the previously published material; for one thing we placed a nomadic 
culture that controlled six subsectors right in the middle. The plan was to 
have the area opened up by making the Weltenbund, a 90-world interstellar
empire in Foreven, defeat the massed nomad fleet decisively. Enough nomads
would escape to make life interesting, but it would enable courageous
scouts and traders to push into the former Nomad Domain and have a chance
of getting out again.

Here\'s a map I made of the situation:

I have seen that happen often enough to like that it is in the system.

One minor concern - his chance to succeed at task rolls goes up, even
though he may have used waivers to get through.  I am willing to write that
off as a vagary of the task system, though, and let it lie, but it might be
worth a side bar note, titled something like "Idiots with Degrees."

Good idea, Marc.

As I\'ve stated before, I think that if TL 13 had been common during RoM then
the Sylean universities would have had details of these technologies, in
which case Sylea could have advanced quickly to TL 13  --  if not before,
then certainly once they had the wealth of an entire empire to draw upon.
Since it took them 450 years to go from TL 12 to TL 13, this cannot be
the case.

TL 13 developed on worlds far from Sylea after the collapse of RoM, sure,
that\'s perfectly possible (as long as the Imperium don\'t reach that far
before , say, 250). But the closer to Sylea, the more unlikely it becomes.
And experimental TL 13 that was never published (and was lost again before
the Imperium reached that far), that\'s perfectly possible too.

A public atta-citizen to Sam Thomas!!!  After I posted the preceding to the

I\'m devising a race of buggy aliens for my future T4 campaign, and I
need to know a couple of things:

1) What element or biological do-hickey would an alien require to
communicate via LF (low-frequency) radio? Can you have an LF radar? and
conversely, can this be jammed? How would this compare in size, power,
etc. with a regular radio? How do you power the thing? Some kind of
bio-chemical battery? Am I talking nonsense?

2) Assume an insectile critter about the size of a Cape buffalo. What
are its jaws going to have to be made out of, and what sort of strength
will have to be behind them, to have any hope of breaching modern armor?
(Think of a giant army ant attacking an M1 tank. OK, so the first 99 get
squished or blown into bite-size pieces. What is the hundredth going to
have to have on the ball to rip off the treads? or the hatch? or the
main gun? or even punch into the hull? Some kind of potent acid combined
with abrasive pads, used normally for tunnelling through rock, say....?
Again, is this physically possible, or am I whistling into the wind?)

3) What physical characteristics would a giant buglike critter have,
generally? I\'m already presupposing it has an internal skeleton to bear
its internal weight; the exoskeleton can be pretty much armor. Can
biological material stand up to smallarms fire? The life sciences aren\'t
exactly my long suit; I\'m really not sure, even given a billion years of
evolution for my critters, what is and ain\'t physically possible. Any
and all random thoughts and input freely solicited.

Oh... if anybody thinks I\'m trying to come up with a Traveller analogue
to Heinlein\'s Bugs... you\'re right. I\'ll post the results.

Not arguing with the rest of what you say but IIRC \'British" refers to
Scotland, England and Wales.
You need "British Isles" to include Ireland. Yes this *still* has nothing
to do with Traveller! ;-)

I think this is a very american, "land of the free, home of the brave",
way of thinking. Education is not a privilege for the intelligent, but 
a human right. I would think that a soceity as wealthy as we have
in Milieu 0 would give everybody the oppurtonity to attend college,
university or other schools, with an exception of medical school.
In my humble opinion you should ditch the INT prereqeust for school
but characters need the degrees from lower schools to attend.

Hey Jeff--how about sharing "Return to Twilights Peak" with the list.
I\'m sure I would not be the only one interested in hearing your take on
"whats really going on" and "what happens next" in TP.

Also, just a tidbit for the JOT discussion.....even when I first
startred with CT way back when, JOT levels were never directly applied
as a DM.  They were use more as an indicator of how "well read" the
character was.  The higher the "skill level" the more likely the PC was
to know a bit about what he was trying to do.  It was the refs choice as
to what the final DM would be or even if the characters past experience
would even allow JOT to be applied.  If it was determined that the PC
might have come across a similar situation in the past the DM applied
was usually only the skill level divided by 3 or 4.  (by way of example:
a PC from a desert world would get significant help from JOT skill for
surviving desert conditions even if he had no survival skills--however
the benefit from the same level of JOT would be almost negligable in
underwater welding (any benefit being dirived from something the PC read
at some time in the past at the refs discretion)

I see space mines as basically det-lasers with no drives. They just sit 
there, passively scanning for a target. When they find one, *ZAP!*

And TL15 is a fairly recent gain - the original Alien Module (set ~10 years

Bagpipes (and kilts if you must, but only for the pipers) for the Marines 
get my vote. I\'d give them red berets, too - that\'s the traditional symbol 
of paratroopers, and drop troops are really just paras who got a bit carried 
away.

Did you try looking on pages 47, 69, 70, 77, 84, 91, 97, or 103 of
Emperor\'s Arsenal?

Ultimately, though, If you want armor for Traveller, you want Central
Supply Catalog. CSC has a variety of Flex and plate armors; low-tech
leather, chain, and plate armors, concealable "diplo" armor, and a design
system for powered battle armor at a variety of tech levels, including
sample designs for TL 11 and 12.

Buy now, and you get a large selection of Imperial Scout surplus equipment,
customizable vacc suit designs, explorations tools, computers, and robots
at no extra cost.

Now how much would you pay? But wait, there\'s more! A complete Vehicle
Design System, with sample designs for air, water, land, grav, and space
vehicles, all much better designed than possible with the wretched SSDS. If
only they could have got the guy who did the illustrations for EA in this
book, it would have been the best Traveller supplement ever published.

This is my problem with the new University Concept: 
Do you really believe that anybody has the same benefits from 
studying in university. I mean, there are people who really use their 
time and come out greatly improved (intellectually), and others who 
don\'t learn a thing in all the time! 
With the new education system, everyone of the same degree becomes an 
intellectual peer, all become the same...
So i rather feel that giving Edu bonuses is more appropriate than 
raising Edu to a certain level!

Vacsuit skill is obvious.  Strong Navy experience would be real good as well
as they would have exposure to the type of weaponry you are talking about.
Strong gambling skills might be good to help choose one asteroid over
another or when/how to disarm an unfamiliar weapon.  I\'ve always held that
gamblers have an inate ability to "sense" the odds on performing almost any
act....  Demolitions skills would be good for getting rid of old equipment
too dangerous to get close to.  Survey and Technical would also be valuable
in the environment you\'ve described.  Finally, I would throw in computer as
these things have got to have some sort of computer control if they are
going to go after decades of non-use.

To handle the pirates, Infiltration and/or Intimidation would be really
valuable I think.

If you are going to live and work in an asteroid field it is guaranteed to
be underground with a fair amount of crust between you and the outside.
This would be true for several reasons...micrometeorites would be a serious
problem and proximity to a star would bathe the asteroids in all kinds of
stuff you don\'t want to have to face on a daily basis.  Given this, I would
set charges in small asteroids spread throughout the portion of the belt you
wanted to protect.  The charges would blow the small asteroid to bits
sending small kinetic weapons all over the place whenever they blow.  I
would then treat the asteroid belt as a mine field with a known in/out path
which would prevent you from getting blown up.  Stray from the path and your
gone.  The small asteroids would, ideally, be too small to land a craft on,
requiring an individual to jet over as opposed to a whole space craft.  This
would also make removing the mines really hard as they would be buried in
these small asteroids and there would be lots of small asteroids to look at.

I would set up dummy mine shafts on some asteroids, or abandoned asteroids
which have been mined out.  This would make it really hard for an attacker
to guage whether or not he has hit the home base.  Last, I would do my best
to most heavily fortify one of the dummies.  Let\'s face it, if a big gun has
found your home base you are dead regardless of the precautions.  On the
other hand, if he goes after a dummy which explodes at him before he is
ready you have a chance.  Thus your defenses are better used as a ploy then
as straight defenses.  This would be fun as a GM too, because your players
would be busy tracking down dummies for a while.

Depends on whether or not the PCs need to figure out where the big hauls
are.  Were the asteroid miners paranoid who told no one where their stuff
was...maybe they only met freighters at lagrange points and had some
excellent radar jamming so that no one could track them...If the PCs have to
find the big haul, the Megacorp should offer to pay very well and then do
its best to weasle once the big mine has been found.

The M0 society does seem to have a fairly aggressive understanding of Rank
Has Its Privileges.  My group is now debating just how far they want to
extend this, but it is clear that 3I society is in no way egalitarian, save
that the Emperor may choose to elevate anyone, plus there are implications
that important jobs will also tend to get the holder elevated.

>I would think that a soceity as wealthy as we have

I would actually be surprised.  Look at the fraction of life that many
people spend now in education of arguable merit.  I suspect instead that a
wealthy society would have a higher baseline of facts at each educational
level, but that there would still be levels, and that they would be a
limited resource.  Figure that TL12 can probably put more in grade school,
if they desire to, than we do in an entire undergraduate education.  That
still might not mean that everyone would have the same number of years.

My suspicion is that they could afford to educate everyone forever, but
that they cannot afford people not working and producing stuff for most of
their lives.  (I conclude this because of the heavy usage of people in
menial jobs, repetitive jobs, and advanced jobs.  If they need to have a
human loading cargo, then it is cheaper to use a human than to use a robot.)

 Your assumption was correct - she was the wife of the male
 Emperor, Strephon.  There were the two Princes, Varian and
 Lucan, and the Crown Princess, Iphegenia.  All of these
 individuals are mentioned in the MegaTraveller background
 material that describes the Assassination that led to the
 Rebellion and then the Collapse.  Dulinor murdered Strephon
 (really his clone; Strephon himself was on a secret mission
 [AV]), Iolanthe, and Iphegenia in the Audience Chamber; Varian
 was murdered in his apartments by an unknown individual (but
 unspoken suspicions fall on Lucan).

Yeah, but did NASA have to meet the expectations of the THUDD voters?  I

Very true, this is the best 31st Birthday present I could ask for.. other
than a 1947 Harley-Davidson.  My only fear is that the landing and the
Boston Pops will be on oppisite each other..

Yes....He is the M.M.....and on this list....lucky we are to have him
here.  Which gives this Traveller fan yet another chance to say "Thanks"
to Marc for taking the time to listen to the opinions of the TML
concerning Traveller issues.  (Now he has the task--pun intended--of
wading through all the opinions he\'s received and deciding which, if
any, to use.--Good luck Marc!)

I\'m sure glad there was no TML when I first started way back when.  When
my players disliked jmy interpretation of a certain rule, my standard
reply was, "Well if you don\'t like it, you\'re going to have to talk to
Mr. Miller about it."  Seeing as how no one was going to do that, my
interpretation prevailed.  If I used that system now I would probably no
longer be able to retain my position as the "all-knowing, all-powerful
ref."

That\'s MAROON Berets.  As opposed to the cute Girl Scout hats worn by the
Special Forces.

I was going to use kilts for all officers at least to hammer home that this
is not a US military formation that has moved into space, but an evolution
of multiple traditions.  I was going to homebrew a Marine Tartan, with a
provision for Noble Marines to wear an appropriate family tartan instead.

BTW: I meant to mention the Highland Regiment(s) (I seem to recall while
watching the Edinburgh Military Tattoo that there was only one left..) in
my original post, nut my brain slipped gears.

so here goes...

As I read the books it appears that thruster plate technology confers
contra-gravity as well,  ContraGravity drives "...are included here so
that ships below tech level 11 (thruster plates) can hover and maneuver
in an atmosphere" \'The Standard Star Ship Design System\', Ok.

Now, if a ship or small craft is constructed using fission, fusion,  AND
it does NOT have ContraGravity installed does this mean that the vessels
must include lifting surfaces (wings etc.) as well as streamlining in
order to land, take off or otherwise manuvuer in atmosphere or is it
limited to straight up and down flight (single stage to orbit
tecchnology)? If this is the case then how is the fuel for such a ship
figured? Has anyone addressed this for T4, or is TNE FFS the only
source?

Also if wings are used would this then include "rolling" take-off and
landings? How much tonnage should be allocated for retractable wheels or
skids. In the same vane on ContraGravity equipt vessels do most people
consider struts of other landing gear and how much room/tonnage s
usually allocated for them in the designs?

One more before I go, do Star Ships and or small craft float, typically?
Would water landings (ala Jerry Pournelle\'s Falkenburg novels) be an
alternative?

 I think none thruster, non-ContraGrav equipt shipd MUST use wings or
SSTO technology. In the first case then skids, or (preferably) wheels
are needed and  must be alocated for. The water landing technique is an
alternative, but could have a big effect on the design of the vessel.
Also with these limitations I would think that larger vessels (over 1 or
200 td) would never land and be restricted to small craft tenders. If
that\'s the case a set of rules for fuel usage, wings and landing gear
would be needed to generate the proper designs.

I\'m interested to see what ideas others are using out there. I\'m working
on an alternative campaign set to rimward/spinward of Terran space about
a colony placed before the conquest of the first Imperium and just
moving back into space at about the time of Millieu 0 (less chance of
breaing canon that way!) and I\'d like to incorperate some alternate
technology.

Not to get into a cultural flamewar here, but it\'s my RIGHT to go to the
Naval academy???

I suppose anyone on the street in Oslo can walk in and get admitted to the
Institute of Astrophysics with no entrance exams at all, right? Even
people who need to take their shoes off to count above ten?

(Begins to sound like the Tom Lehrer routine about "Not only has the Army
stopped discriminating on the basis of race, creed or color, but on the
basis of ability, as well")

Remember, this is a society with hereditary noble classes. I doubt there\'s
universal guaranteed college education.

Why except medical school? I\'m sure that if you\'re willing to fly on a
starship astrogated by someone with a 3 INT, you won\'t mind at all
getting operated on by a Doctor who can\'t count to ten either!

The utility of higher education to any individual in any society is
directly proportional to the economic vale of that education over that of
not getting said education. This is a prolix way of saying, if you can get
a good, steady, well-paying job without having to have a college
education, then the universal access is less important. If, on the other
hand, as you see some places, you need a degree before they\'ll hire you to
sort the mail, then it\'s very necessary.

Finally, coming from a land-grant college where state law mandates that
the colleges accept any state resident who graduates in the top 75% of
their high school class, I really resent your snide implication that
Americans (Alone amongst the \'civilized\' world, of course) are somehow
exclusionary about who can and cannot go to college.

Actually, there _was_ a surviving witness to what happened in Varian\'s
chambers that day, a relatively low ranking Naval Intelligence officer.
The details are either in Rebellion Sourcebook or Survival Margin,
probably the former.

Said officer wasn\'t stupid...he boogied, covering his tracks, using every
trick he knew, and he didn\'t STOP boogieing until he was out of Imperial
space.

Being the only known witness (and the publically accused killer) to a
regicide is a verry hazardous operation.

RPSC is certainly nice...although, from a sensor standpoint, I hope that the
improved sensor rules - based on some detailed simulations of infrared
signatures and sensitivity - that I wrote (based on Anders\' stuff) for
FFS2 will make it into T4.1

I\'ve been playing with Galactic 2.2 for a few days now, and other than the
lack of M:O material (can you say v2.3?), it remains at the top of
Traveller software.  I especially like the mapping software, since I can
quickly make maps when I need them, and spacers are only going to need
basic maps anyway.

One question:  What format is Galactic saving those maps in.. I\'d like to
print them/transfer them to .gifs for my web pages

It was nice to see the archieved material about the copyright/trademark
see-saw that went on last year.. rathar than a simple copyright statement
this was illustrative of what has been happening in the industry.

All in all, Michael Bailey and Jim Vassilakos deserve a standing ovation

You are correct, but it is more than simply your opinion:

From the MT Referee\'s Companion Global Terraforming (TL 16) can take a
world with an insidious atmosphere and transform it into a world with a
standard atmosphere. 

Total Terraforming (TL 17+) involves taking a barren vacuum world and
turning it into a lush world with lots of water and a dense atmosphere. 

(both examples paraphrased from MT Referee\'s Companion page 32).

There is no evidence that the ROM ever did anything like this.  Turning a
world with 15% water into a with 40% water is a much easier process and
sounds more like the process described under TL 12 terraforming.  I\'d
imagine that removing a taint from a atmosphere would also be TL 12
terrafrorming. 

As you said TL 12 terraforming is making the Sahara bloom, TL 16
Terraforming is making Venus habitable.  We have no evidence that that the
ROM ever did anything like this.

Well Jeff--I guess that we should allow you to post to the list anyway.
I only worry about arguing canon when I\'m not playing and when I\'m
playing I have yet to let canon stand in the way of a good idea.  I have
now become fodder for the TML canon-crusaders, but hey, if its the worst
beating I ever take I\'ll consider myself very lucky.

I look forward to seeing your "not entirely canon-like" ideas.

	Half a year ago I had a theory that a civilisation need a
	pop level >= tech level to sustain without trade. Even if
	you know what TL-15 is, you need the synergy to build it.

	Sustaining TL-13 on world which have mostly a pop level of 5-9,
	would need a enormous freighter fleet. Here we have the 450 years.

	So perhaps TL-13 was not uncommon in RoM because the RoM was
	a technokratic/militaristik invader who had won a war, and now
	has had the synergy to build TL-13. They where unable to rule
	the vilani, but they where able to press the production for
	their expensive TL-13 enclaves.

	Perfect ! Hiden mines. Why not thinking straight: Mines are

I don\'t know, it must be some kind of e-mail thing.  It takes about 5 min.

Holy Cow!  I just realized that this whole thing has got me talking Us vs.
Them.  Why does it always have to be that way?  (I asked that not too long
ago on another list, and of course got no reply.)

As for the comments further up, I must tell you that I am sorry.  I guess I
was just kind of responding to being told how to run my life, and by some
other than my own standard.  I was not trying to offend _anyone_.  My
Traveller group has known each other for a long time, and we often razz each
other.  The "instant gratification" quote comes from us all laughing at
ourselves, being the sort who can\'t wait for anything new in the way of
Traveller.  We want it NOW, not when some hobby shop gets it in.  When
it first came out, J.P. and I once (literally) ripped the only copy of
JTAS#3 here in Denver at Bonnie Brae Hobbies. You should have seen the
looks on our faces at that moment. :)

I guess I just confused _this_ environment with one that I have fun in.

Look.  I _started_ this off on the premise that I wanted opinions.  I never
promised (until later) that I would even _provide_ my sources.

As to what I _have_ said, what you judge to be relevant is only of relevance
to you.  I have been in this game since \'77 also, and I have never lost
sight of the fact that I find it fun.  I am not sure from your posts that
I want to be on your TML, but I have some pleasure in knowing that I have
reached others like myself.  I am an adult too, but a kid at heart because
I can recognize that the best thing about role-playing is not being myself,
but being "someone else."  Not that being myself is all that bad, mind you.
It is just a great escape.

I may not have been around the TML before.  To tell you the truth, I read
nothing of your "etiquette and protocol" on the FAQ I ftp\'d from the site.
If this is a place where hounding of the newest newbie is commonplace, you
won\'t be too happy with me.

I doubt that everybody here has the vast libraries that we do.  I want for
_anyone_ interested, to be able to voice opinions, not just for someone
to be dominating over any discussion, with some set of rules unilaterally
imposed.  I may have made some mistakes, but I have explained what I meant
by everything I have posted, and why I did.

J.P. attributes it to the fact that my favorite cartoon character was (is)
Bugs Bunny. :)

Anyway I doubt that everyone here is so unforgiving, but if _everybody_ is
that way, then I don\'t have to lose any sleep over any tumult I may have
had something to do with.

So fractious?  Come on.  E-mail is _so_ tenuous that I can\'t say that anyone
except those I have met in person would I be able to sum up an opinion of
whether or not I like them.  And that even goes for Harold, the only one
here whom I\'ve ever had a disagreement of the magnitude you suggest.

Sorry, but my philosophy is that _nobody_ insults me!  Only _I_ can do that!

Well at least he\'ll be back from vacation and hopefully in good spirits.

Why should we make this assumption ?  The 2nd Empire was more dynamic
than the 3rd Empire (which is probably part of the reason it was shorter
but that is another issue) and could have gone up TL\'s faster.

Look at how little time the Solomani spent at TL\'s 5-11 for instance.

Yes this data would tend to suggest that they did not have enough time
to have achieved TL 13 but they could have gone up faster.  I do not
believe that they _did_ but they could have if thats the way Marc wants
to do things.  If we (Solomani) can pass through some of the earlier
Tl\'s in as little as 30 years we could go from TL 12 to TL 13 in a _lot_
less than 450 years.

It took the Solomani influenced Darrians much less than than this for
instance.  AM8 Darrians says (pg 9)  "It took only a short time to go
from the Solomani tech level of 10 to 16." and (pg 25) that this took
from -1511 to -924 (587 years).

Now you could argue that the @nd Empire was too shaky & overextended to
advance in technology but I disagree.  It is true that the 2nd Empire
was _politically_ overextended but they did not necessarily have
problems in the scientific community.  Even if all the Vilani scientists
were totally useless (unlikely) the same home grown Solomani scientists
that they had always had could have made developments.

I am not saying they did.  I am only saying they could have.

I use 4 m3 to 8 m3 from small Japanese to large American car.

One design system idea I\'ve been toying with is to more specifically choose
the form of the vehicle and then setting its base volume by
lengthxwidthxheight and thereafter reducing a certain often large
percentage of that based on the hullform. Most delta wing aircraft for
instance have the same proportions and the same can be roughly said about
cars. It is far easier to visualize the vehicle if given its dimensions
rather than some volume number. Just me blabbing my mouth off really.

  I believe no errata exist as such or are needed. The 1990\'s
re-release with hard map-boards deleted the third star w/o a
system box (near Apishal/Zaggisi) IIRC, but I can check that.

  The only variant I\'ve seen was rewriting the combat charts
(for ships, at least) for 2d6 resolution, but still as a 9x12
factor listing. I\'ll see if I can present that. Apparently the
purpose was to address a tendency towards the small ships
predominating, and to bring the extremes of the CRT\'s to more
believable levels.

Personally, I think all modifications should be made to the target number
and the dice should be left alone. Target numbers are already calculated
values, modifiers won\'t change that. DMs are too ambiguous (Die modifier?
Difficulty modifier? What about opposed tasks?) and should be abolished.
Also, a positive DM on a task roll is bad and a negative one is good, which
is the opposite of what people expect. I would prefer only to have RMs (or
whatever they will be called).

Low frequency means hard to pinpoint by triangulation, low resolution for
radar and pretty high minimum size of targets. In order to evolutionary
develop LF radar in a biological organism they or their prey/enemies need
to be huge. Low frequency seems to be pretty hard to jam. In my army stint
I was a short wave telegraphist (the last ditch when all other comm fail)
and during all our training whe never got jammed despite the opposition
always trying to do so. If an animal has developed radio comm with pretty
low frequency (short wave) they could use it to communicate around an
entire planet if the atmosphere/ionosphere works as our. This could be cool
for the ref with Traveller PC doing som bad stuff to the aliens and soon
after every alien on the globe knows about it despite TL-0.

I\'d say biological matter can be similar to kevlar but in order to evolve
it has to have some reason why that particular feature is beneficial.
Perhaps predators who swallow small rocks and shoot them out through some
violent chemical reaction as a weapon need be countered. This could also
mean that some of the smaller animals have fast enough reflexes, muscles
etc do dofge slow bullets!

I think they state that those were the maximum achievedcTL for the

Yeah, I use them as minor races (of which there are clearly
a huge number).  I recently had a Cidi show up as an official
at Regina star port.  They had just started taking jobs off
their home planet and were establishing a community there because it
look like a good place to find Clerical and Technical jobs.

The Third Imperium is not actually big on human rights... free market 
economics predominates, and local governments can do whatever they 
like on their own turf.

I\'d say education was a privilege for anyone who gets it, and the 
"right" to education is balanced by a duty to take education 
seriously, which many simply don\'t do.  I don\'t believe Syleans would 
be much different.

Like it or not, a college education requires some background in 
learning (EDU) and enough INT to understand the necessary concepts.
I must admit INT A for a technical school seems a bit high -- I\'m 
thinking car mechanic school, not aero engineering or MIT -- but I 
haven\'t seen the explanatory text.

Two points: firstly, money will be spent only where it does good, and 
if Sylean society doesn\'t hold with the value of education for all, 
it won\'t happen.  Secondly, much education will be available in the 
home via vid-screen, rather than at college per se, and so colleges 
might become even more elitist institutions than many are at present:
many are part-time students, and few are full-time.

Sad to say, there is a minimum intelligence required to cope with a 
certain level of schooling -- you\'re putting it at INT 1, I\'d put it 
at rather higher levels... INT 6 or 7 for a degree in the UK, even 
given our rather devalued university system.

I disagree whole-heartedly.

Nice idea, but increase the roll to 3D (ie this is something that only 
high-SOC characters will have much chance of succeeding at (on average, 
only a Noble will succeed), although Joe Average *might* get away with it).

With traitrous sentiments like that you\'d better start running too :) 
The Emporer himself saw the murder, commited by the very man who has 
the gall to accuse his rightful ruler of this horrendous act. 

And if you belive this there are a number of politicians here who\'d

I am trying to use the design sequences in Starships for T4, but I have a
problem when it comes to adding armor. According to what i can make out
	ArmorVolume=VolumeFactor*ArmorLevel
	ArmorMass=ArmorVolume*MaterialDensity
Actual armor rating is then looked up on the USP table.

The problem with this is that as you go up tech levels, armor masses more
but gives the same protection value. Surely there should be an armor
modifier on the material table. Also, if you cross reference armor level on
the USP chart to get Armor Rating you are going to need a lot of volume to
get decent armor ratings. Is this right?

Any info gratefully received.

Yes, but the resolution of radars is always limited by the diffraction 
limit: for a radar dish of diameter d, at a distance r, the smallest
detail that can easily be resolved is given by 

res = l*r/d

where l is the wavelength of the radar - so a 20-cm wavelength radar with a
100-cm antenna will have lousy resolution. (Alternatively, you can think of
it as the angular resolution of the radar/width of the radar "cone"
being broadcast, which will be given by

angle= 57*l/d

(angle in degrees.)

An interesting possibility if the creatures are telepathically linked is that
they could act like a big interferometer, with several bugs working together
to make one big high-resolution radar - in that case, replace d with the
distance between the furthest-appart bugs (and hence you might end up witha
biological radar that can see aircraft or spacecraft.)

Biological IR is a neat possibility - the creature might have some 
mechanism for cooling its eyes so it can see into the thermal IR.

Eating through armour is hard, but you can imagine a critter that sprays
adhesive gunk into vents, over sensors and cooling radiators (fusion power
plants don\'t need intake vents but do need cooling radiators to avoid
overheating and shutting down...cover the radiators with insulating gunk and
the power plant will have to shut down.)

I\'ll go for something by Mahler or Wagner, especially from Mahler\'s 
2nd Symphony. However I\'ll place bets that if it\'s any \'classical\' 
piece it\'ll be either \'Mars\' or \'Jupiter\' from Holst\'s \'The Planets\'.

Of course all this will probably go by the wayside when the 
Solomani\'s power at court is broken.

Problem is the Terran Confederation was using elements of TL 12
technology as far back as -2389 (synaptic programming in robots) and
had Jump 3 *before* the start of the Nth Interstellar War (-2235).

Possibly a bad assumption. The 3I has a significant Vilani influence, the
RoM has a much stronger Terran influence (note, not Solomani but
Terran). The Terran Confederation was TL 9 in -2431 (discover jump
drive) and was starting into TL 12 by -2389 (use of synaptic programing
in robots), definitely reached TL 12 before -2235 (Terrans had jump-3
during the 9th Interstellar War which was followed by the Nth
starting -2235).

The way I see it is that the Terrans were TL 9 when the 1st Interstellar
War started (-2431), rapidly absorbed Vilani tech (the refs companion
puts them at TL 11 in -2398) and pushed on from there. Given that they
were facing an opponent with overwhelming strength, they would have
started a crash research program, developing odds and ends of TL 12
over 150 years; only bringing it altogether at the end. With the end of
the Wars and the conquest of the Vilani much of the urgency would
have gone and many resources would have had to have been diverted
to holding the Empire together. However, they were still facing major
external and internal threats (e.g. the Vargr) and they would have built
up a fearsome momentum. The Terran portions of the RoM just didn\'t
have the ingrained technological inertia that the Vilani (and later 3I) did.
The Syleans took 500 years to go from TL 11 to TL 12, the Terrans did
it in about 150 (jump 3 before -2235).

So to put it altogether. I think you have to divide the RoM into two areas
in regards to TL, the former Ziru Sirka which has massive technological
inertia and probably wouldn\'t advance much beyond it\'s TL 11 (say
TL 12 is max in this area); and the former Terran Confederation which
could quite convivably have pushed to TL 13, but would have had the
technology widely spread (never developed jump 4, but pushed to
TL 13 in other fields, maybe even TL 14 in medical/biological). Taking
the figures from the Ref\'s companion you get 300 to 500 years for the
3I to advance a tech level, but I\'d say 150 to 300 for the RoM.

If you would just tell me the name of the book(s) that you are getting this
from, I would be satsified.  That\'s all.  Is that so impossible?

Why am I not surprised?  Let me give you an example.  You may have seen the
end of the Great Task Debate, and heard about an alternate system called
KBv2.0.  When Kenneth proposed his system, he backed it up with pages of
detailed probability charts, expalnations for why he thought his system was
best, and invited commentary.  Another:  We have a semi-regular ship-design
contest (THUDD) run by my brother.  People who enter are expected to be
able to provide expalnations and commentary on their designs.

This list exists for the free flow of ideas.  It is one thing to ask a
theoretical question about jumpspace, quite another to announce that
everything we know is wrong and you have the truth but won\'t tell us until
it suits you.

We are not telling you how to run your life, just asking that you abide by
the conventions of the TML and back up your statements.

I don\'t know about you, but I am more than capable of having fun without
annoying everyone around me.  Post your sources, and you\'ll get a lively

product printed in 1981 as your source.

If I wasn\'t having fun, I wouldn\'t role-play.  This however, isn\'t a game,
it is a forum for discussions of the game.  Most of us are Referees, some
of us write for the game, all of us are interested in the free and open

You are the first newcomer I can remember who immediately started making

some of the people here have become very good friends.

You are not taking part in this.  You are trying to control the debate,

You\'d be surprised.. many of the frequent posters seem to have massive
libraries with some very rare items.  How can I give an opinion on
something when you won\'t give me your evidence?  *I* have presented,
several times, canonical sources showing the RoM reaching at most TL13.
You have ignored those posts utterly.

After calling Dave Golden a sheep and insulting me, Harold Hale, and God

that you are one of those people whom I don\'t like to have in my games.
Self-centered, overconfident, and rather immature.

Before I get jumped on by them, I should point out that the cargo generation

    'body' => '  Love to read those technical and military magazines - great ideas for
Traveller stuff.

  The latest issue of Jane\'s Defense Weekly has a feature story on the US
Army\'s plans for the next generation Main Battle Tank.  Oh, excuse me,
Main Battle _System_ - since it is going to be able to fire in indirect as
well as direct mode, it is now a system rather than a tank.  The major
design constraint was, apparently, a 40 ton weight limit and some size
limits, so you could fit two at a time in the new C-17 cargo plane.

  The picture of the mock-up was interesting - similar to the current M-1
Abrams, but much smoother.  According to the article, this was because all
the defensive systems, like reactive armor and smoke grenades, were
mounted flush to the hull surface.  The smoke grenades, for example, were
distributed around the hull evenly, rather than in little racks as they
are now.  They did not say why they did it this way - maybe so when they
mount the grav plates it\'ll fly faster due to less drag.  The one oddity
about the appearance was that the barrel was not round, but rather diamond
shaped in cross section. 

  The reason for this was in the article, and was perhaps the most
interesting thing from a Traveller point of view - the Army is seriously
considering using a rail gun as the main armament rather than chemical
propellants (they are also considering missiles).

  Aviation Week & Space Technology served up a couple of interesting
stories.  The first was about a new, low cost launch system being
developed by an independant company.  It\'s two stage to orbit, and uses
cheap and simple slightly modified Russian rocket engines in a new
structure.  I thought the mission profile was interesting - the first
stage lofts the second to a great height, separates, and then does a
second short burn (about 45 seconds), turning it back around toward the
launch site.  It then lands using a parachute and big air bags on the
bottom to absorb the shock.  The second stage then proceeds to orbit,
launches the payload, and deorbits itself.  It then lands in the same way
as the first stage.  Claim is both stages will land on land within three
miles of the launch site (about 5 km, which is probably the actual
specification).

  The company claims a two week turn-around time, and from 50 to 100
flights before major rebuild.  If it all works out, the cost per launch
will be much less than other current low orbit systems.  They already have
one contract for launching that would pay about 100 million - they say
they need about 500 million to finish system development and launch in the
late 1990s.

  A second story in the same magazine concerns a new artillery projectile
with the rather unfortunate acronym BLAM, which stands for something like
Barrel-Launched Airguided Munition.  It looks like a conventional
artillery warhead, kind of cone shaped, but in two pieces - a forward cone
and a skirt.  The two are connected by piezolectric "tendons" which allow
a small computer to alter the angle between the two halves and so steer
the round.  You can launch it from a smooth bore tube, and then guide it
to the target.  The steering mechanism is apparently very shock resistant,
so you can fire it at really amazing accelerations (thousands of Gs, I
seem to recall).  The steering also extends range considerably, apparently
since the round can be oriented for minimum drag when fired in an indirect
role - something like doubling the range with the same accuracy is
claimed.  Although more expensive, it is more accurate (in theory, I
suppose), so you can either carry less and make your platform lighter, or
more lethal for the same weight. 

  Finally, the New Scientist had an article on Mars expeditions, and it
seems NASA is working on - hold on - fuel refining!  Yes, it costs too
much to send the fuel all the way to Mars, so they are developing a system
that can make a fuel on Mars from Martian materials.  I only skimmed the
article, since I was late for an appointment, but it sounded rather
complex with all sorts of design questions about operating in temperature
extremes and so on.

  Anyway, all of these sound like interesting sources from the Traveller
point of view - hope you find them intersting.

I had always assumed that DM in T4 refered to modifying the THROW (Target

Marc,

I\'d scrap the DM - if you start to modify the dice roll, the phrase \'target
number\' starts to be inappropriate. Modifying the target number felt (to
me) to be in line with the roll less a number system we have now. You
already have to calculate the target number, so why not just mod it as you
do it.

In any case, keep one or the other but not both - it avoids confusion.

Additionally, please consider dropping all the multiple of 3 DM\'s (in
combat) etc. and replace them with an increase task by one difficulty
level... I admit this idea comes from an explaination of the philosophy in
the MT system that was in a Traveller Digest, but it made sense.

Even geneering animals will have its limits. Evolution gives an animal
armour, it takes away reaction speed and flexibility. Even with geneering
you can\'t have it all. It takes too much "evolutionary energy" to get
everything. Life, like technology, involves at least some degree of
tradeoffs. Geneering can reduce this, but tech reduces the tradeoff as well.


Evolutionary energy is my abstract term for tradeoffs, it is not an actual
measure of ergs
An example, if you had an armoured (read: bulletproof) carnivore the size of
an elephant that had lightning reflexes, fantastic senses, intelligence and
could run 60 mph and fly, it would quickly drive everything it ate into
extinction because of what would be, to say the least, a tremendous
appetite. Before it even evolved to the point as listed above, it would have
specialized. Thus, you would have one or two of the above at most. The
energy requirement for high speed and high mass are easiest to take away.
Carnivores are rarely armoured. Because of its size it will be able to move
fairly quickly (larger stride), so it will stay large. Good senses are the
hallmark of the carnivore. But it will probably specialize in one or two,
based on environment. (in water smell and hearing, in arctic sight and
hearing, etc) It would then specialize (or not, some species never do) and
develop huge jaws to take down large prey. Or more likely, because it
requires less effort, scare smaller predators away from their food and/or
eat carrion. It specializes in sight and smell, to spot camouflauged prey
and smell to find carrion.
And budda-bing...you have the Tyrannosaurus Rex
In short, an ecosystem has to support this creature. Evolution is about
fitting into niches, not striving to be number one

 The question mark is probably an umlauted "u" - , if you can

 No clue on these, although the first looks intriguingly Droyne.

 This one is definitely coreward of the Julian Protectorate.
 The JP is Mendan, Amdukan, and Star\'s End sectors; 3EG is in
 the three sectors directly coreward.  Amdukan is directly
 coreward of Antares.

 DGP _Solomani_and_Aslan_ volume for a more exact location; my
 gut feeling says that they\'re rimward of the Hierate proper,
 near the Sol. Confed.

 This is definitely a Vargr name; I can\'t close in better than
 that without digging out semi-inaccessible references.

Sequence of play, Imperial maintenance and Production (clarification):
Income
Production & Imperial replacement
Imperial Attention
Apeals to the Emperor
Maintain Old ships
Purchase new ships

Ships that are in a Tertiary hex, with a tanker, are considered to be 
fuelled and may break off combat as long as the (friendly) tanker is 
present at the beginning of the combat phase.

Combat: immediately after range is determined termination of combat is 
determined.  the attacker first must announce if he is breaking off or 
remaining to attack.  then the defender declares.  It is possible for 
both sides to break-off, inwhich case no side fires.

Terminating Combat: break-off may be to more than one system, if 
desired.  If multiple destinations are used, all must be of equal 
priority

Terminating combat: Ships that are not able to break off (such as 
monitors and fighters not in motherships) may not fire in the round 
that their forces retreat, but may do so in subsequent rounds.

Planetary bombardment: only ships that did not use high-intensity 
missile fire may participate.

Planetray defense fire: ships that both bombard and attempt a landing 
are attacked twice by each world, outpost or planetary defence marker.

Fighters: fighters may use capital ships as a base.  Each capital ship 
counter (M, B, B1, B2, BB) can support one fighter unit.  Fighters not 
inside a mothership cannot retreat from combat, but must remain.  At 
the conclusion of space combat sub-phase, all fighters without a base 
are eliminated (they run out of fuel).

Economics (Terran):  A world is connected to Sol for income purposes 
only if the path contains no empty systems, other than tertiary hexes.

Economics (Imperial): A world is considered connect for the initial 
set-up if it can trace a path to Gashida, the path must contain no 
empty systems, other than tertiary hexes.

Recover from disruption: disrupted ships do not get a dice modifier for 
being at a friendly outpost.

Ship production: monitors may only be placed in space, never on a 
planet surface.

Imperial replacements: these appear through Ishkur, Dingir, Kinunir or 
Gashida.

Victory levels (clarification):
Turn   Win   lose
 4     9     1
 5     8     2
 6     7     3
 7     6     4
 8     -     5
 
Appeals to the emperor: these may not be attempted if they would reduce 
the glory to or below the "lose" level.  i.e glory 0 on turns 1 to 3, 
glory 1 on turn 4, etc.
 
Territorial exchange (outposts):  A tenable path may contain empty 
systems (i.e with neither world nor outpost), unlike a connected path.
 
Territaoral exchange: if a binary stellar hex is occupied by both terra 
and the Imperium, then the hex is considered tenable by both sides.  
However, players may wish to agree to a "mutual withdrawl" in which 
case both outposts are removed from play.  Note that worlds are always 
tenable. 

Starting the first war: For the initial set-up (only) all worlds and 
outposts must be connected to Gashida.

Terraforming: If there is always an outpost present, past turns of 
terrforming are not lost.  Thus it is possible for a world to be 
terraformed alternately by Imperial and Terran players, with only 50 
total turns (150 RU) required.  Each turn 3 RU is not spent will "undo" 
one D6 worth of terraforming turns.

===============
One of the nice things about the errata is that the Imperial set up is 
restricted so that all the ouposts and worlds must be connected to 
Gashida.  The Imperial set up can include Procyon (plus Ys and Sarpedon 
if you want), but at the risk of exposing the left side of the board to 
terran expansion.  This is one of may favorite "high risk" strategies 
as it takes the fight right to the Terrans while allowing them to 
expand to the rich worlds on the lower left of the board.  This set up 
gives a very different game to the usual bottlenecks of Nusku/Dushaam 
and Sirius.  The drawback for the Imperial player is that the outposts 
"beyond" Sirius do not generate income on the first turn, unless his 
reaction ships happen to place a tanker there <evil grin> during the 
Terran\'s first turn.

I would suggest that the Emperor and the Empire might have separate
musical \'signatures,\' perhaps more than one each.  Consider as a parallel
the use of "Hail to the Chief" for the US President, as opposed to "The
Star-Spangled Banner" for the US itself.  As the 3I does not seem strongly
involved in the symbolic identity of monarch and nation, having separate
music for each seems reasonable. 

For the Emperor, I would suggest the need for an instrumental fanfare; an
ideal example would be "Fanfare for the Common Man" (Aaron Copland).  Not
only are the title (and inspiration) pleasingly ironic, it\'s one of the
most stirring pieces of music ever written, and the initial fanfare
segment would stand well on its own for grand entrances and exits.

    'body' => 'OK, a couple of clarifications... and a few more questions:

1) My Bugs are vegetarians.

2) My Bugs are NOT genegineered. They are, however, a race of warriors
(no workers per se; just drones to do the digging) that have a
billion-year evolutionary path behind them. (I think I already
mentioned, and will reiterate, that they do have internal cartilaginous
skeletons to support their body weight. The exoskeletons supplement
this, and serve additionally as armor).

3) They evolved in parallel with another intelligent race that lived on
the surface and grew food crops for \'em. The Bugs in turn protected
their "workers" from the native nasties, which are numerous and as
hellacious as the Bugs themselves -- hence the need to evolve all that
armament. Food supply is theoretically not a problem. They can tailor
their own population from generation to generation by only hatching
enough eggs to meet the existing food supply.

(FYI: This sort of symbiotic relationship is not unknown amongst Terran
insects. There is a species of ant in South America that feeds,
protects, and grooms these big fat grubs who in turn produce enough
nectar for the entire colony. Another, the African Amazon ant, is
comprised of 100% warriors, who have to go out and steal workers from
other species\' colonies to work for them).

4) The reason I want LF radio communication is so they CAN communicate
planet-wide and not get jammed, as someone else thoughtfully pointed
out. Their intelligence is low by human standards, but they network
together to solve difficult problems (massive parallel colonization?) As
far as senses go, since they live primarily in a subterranan
environment, they usually get by on touch, smell, and rudimentary
eyesight (any body knows how well a spider can see with those little
eyespots? What if there\'s a half-dozen eyes each the size of grapefruit?
How far? and in what spectrum)?

5) When they charge an opponent, they have an umbrella-like cape that
flares just behind the head and sends out a burst of radar energy. It\'s
a fighting reflex that makes them looks bigger and lets them get an
exact fix on the location of their enemy. At least, that\'s the
concept... I\'ve been told that LF radar is low-resolution. OK. How big
would you guesstimate the target has to be if the \'dish\' is two meters
across? An apartment building? A Hereford steer? Can you increase power
and get greater resolution by using short, powerful bursts?

6) What would the night sky? or an approaching starship? or an enemy
army? look like to a bunch of critters who are in constant communication
with each other, and who are all born with 2m radio receivers lashed to
their heads? Can a bunch of Bugs act in concert as a composite sensor
array of some kind? Does their \'eyesight\' suck less if there\'s more of
them? Can they see farther? or with greater resolution?

That\'s about all for now. I\'ll doubtless think of some more. I\'ve been
working on the concept for a long time; I\'m just trying to find out
whether what I\'ve been working on is biologically possible...

This must be because of China and India\'s large population..hence Labor
stat, right?  I haven\'t gotten into the details, but I\'d expect their lower
TL and much lower infrastructure to offset their population advantage.

Rather than get into the specifics of the rules..as I said I haven\'t done
more than a scan yet..let me say I\'m impressed by what PE is bringing to
the table!  Having stats for Resources, Labor,
Infrastructure, Culture AND all the extended world characteristics brings a
lot of economic, social, and curtural flavor to worlds we haven\'t had in
the design sequences before.

Yes, the rules are called Guns, Guns, Guns by Greg Porter of BTRC. the
section in the back with the conversions has the details of RF and VRF
bonuses. He has a web page at:
http://members.aol.com/btrc/index.html 

It is very good system also he has spreadsheets available take most of the
work out it for you. He used it for CSC and EA.

These rules are available in Greg Porter\'s "Guns! Guns! Guns!" (or
3G3) from BTRC Games.  They are based on "rounds/second" and translate
into a DM of +2 for RF and +4 for VRF.  Greg also triples damage from
a RF attack and quadruples it for a VRF attack.

As to "where" these rules were meant to appear in T4, I couldn\'t tell
you.  Hopefully they will be included in T4.1, as well as some of
Greg\'s optional 3G3 rules (like weapon initiative modifiers).

   Actually you could argue that just the opposite was the case--that
the drag that absorbing all those Vilani placed on the Terrans slowed
them down to the point that TL 13, which may have seemed so close at
hand, kept getting pushed further and further into the future, until
finally internal strife and civil war made it impossible to achieve.

    'body' => 'The recent thread regarding biological low-frequency radar has reminded me
of a bunch of questions I\'ve been intending to post for some time now:

In the CONTACT newsletter, worldbuilding expert Martyn Fogg wrote: "The
bones of terrestrial vertebrates...are made from calcium phosphate.
However, shellfish make their shells out of calcium carbonate and some
worms have teeth made from goethite, a hydrated iron oxide (FeOOH) which is
hard and (this is why I like it) can be magnetized." But that\'s all he had
to say on the subject.

This got me thinking about designing an alien sophont whose bones were made
of goethite or some similar organometallic substance. I\'ll outline some of
my ideas here, but my grasp of physics and biology are admittedly shaky, so
I would like to call upon the list\'s expertise.
 - Exactly what are the properties of goethite?
 - What advantages or disadvantages might come with a goethite skeleton?
 - What abilities might such a creature evolve?

Some of the ideas I\'m considering are drawn from existing Terran organisms,
but others are highly speculative and require reality-checking. Also, I am
very probably re-inventing the wheel. If you know of any Traveller aliens,
or aliens in SF, that are similar to these, I\'d be interested in hearing
about them (sadly, I don\'t have a vast library of Traveller material I can
consult).

The species I\'m designing are fully amphibian, more at home in the ocean
but capable of breathing and crawling about above the water line. Their
surface bears electrophores which discharge electricity (under water) for
both defence and communication. Would goethite bones be able to store
electricity, and thus act as capacitors for these discharges?

These sophonts have highly evolved electromagnetic senses, used to orient
themselves to the geomagnetic field, and to detect the movements of nearby
sea creatures in the dark. Over eons of evolution, these senses have been
augmented by specialized bone structures that generate and detect
electromagnetic signals. Assuming an adult body size of about 1m, or up to
3m with forelegs and hindlegs fully extended, what frequency range would
they be sensitive to and capable of transmitting? Would they be more likely
to use amplitude modulation or frequency modulation? 

I\'m assuming that their homeworld is basically Earthlike, with a higher
gravity (1.8G), rich in heavy metals and light volatiles, a strong
geomagnetic field, and an ionosphere. Given this situation, what kind of
range might the sophonts\' bio-radios achieve?

Would they be particularly sensitive to interference from lightning? Solar
flare activity?

Would they be able to adapt to a high-tech environment full of electrical
and electronic gizmos, power lines, and a densely occupied radio spectrum?
I figure their technology would have to involve a lot of careful RF
shielding. I also suspect that they\'d develop electronics very early in
their social development, perhaps even before inventing agriculture. Their
equipment would also have to be protected against possible damage from
their own electrophoretic discharges.

Would a group of these sophonts be able to link together to extend their
sensitivity and range? Perhaps even form distributed arrays? And maybe do
interferometry? Imagine a species that developed radioastronomy long before
they invented fire...

I rather like the social and psychological possibilities inherent in a
species who are naturally interconnected via radio networks (even if their
range were limited to a small area, a lot could be done by a repeating a
message from village to village). As Anders said recently: "This could be
cool for the ref with Traveller PC doing som bad stuff to the aliens and
soon after every alien on the globe knows about it despite TL-0." My
thinking exactly, Anders. 

Any ideas, caveats, critiques, and suggestions would be most welcome.

Thanks,

Sorry but the interference generated by previous posts did not allow that
simple message to get through.  The _main_ sources are not some obscure
off-the-wall product (no offense to those of you out there that like a
particular product).  Primarily, GDW Supplement 10/Alien Module 6: Solomani,
MT (DGP) S&A, MT (GDW) Ref\'s Companion, Imperial Encyclopedia.  That is the
_core_ basis for what I have said previously.

Unfortunately, what I have said previously has been ignored in the context
of which I originally framed this thread.  If you can\'t check TML Digest
#1448, I\'ll be happy to forward you a copy offline.

Let me say this.  I have a point in making the posts I have written, but
it would not necessarily be obvious to the casual observer.  Some people
here have enough info to possibly understand.  I have a team of people
working on this kind of stuff.  I wanted to make a comment which got lost
_way_ back there and never got out.  I do not particularly advocate any
particular Tech Level for the Rule of Man.

I do know that there are aspects to the idea that have never (except in
one place) been considered in a forum for Referee\'s (myself for one) and I
just wanted people to be aware of several rather obscure aspects of the
past history of the Traveller universe.  The fact is, the tech level of
the RoM just doesn\'t matter too much, even in Milieu:0.  We are talking
a span of time that is so far in the past, that the only _tangible_ outcome
is in capturing the imagination of Terrans "out there."

Yes, you will have *anomalies* where things are found from the past that
might be unexplainable (at least to the players).  Yes, there are (read
PE) Pocket Empires that survived through the Long Night, but they are
less likely to have anything in the way of ramifications for the present
(M0) or the future (M1100, M1200).  As I said, it is capturing the
imagination of those Terrans, out there forging a new Empire.

Yes, the TI (especially the New TI) might not want knowledge of this out
to the general population.  Yes, it may be difficult for players (playing
their characters) to sift through what is the truth and what is not.  Hmmm,
the making of an adventure. (I\'ve had that one in mind for awhile now.)

I love this game so much, I\'ve gotten off topic.  My point is this.  I
_do_ think that on some subjects, it is possible to find incredible latitude
in the published products for a wide range of interpretation.  Here on TML,
(for the short time I have been here), it seems that opinions get cussed,
discussed, and chewed a bit, and then everything seems to stratify, into
one, two or more "camps" and people sit around remembering that last time
they got insulted by someone.

If I am going to write T4 material for Imperium Games, I must 1)  get a
handle on how "this place" works (at least I\'m a quick study), 2)  figure
out what the general reaction is to ideas my group has, and 3)  sort out
what is reasonable and what is not, given the body of evidence and
opinion.

Perhaps I should have stated that last paragraph more forcefully before,
but Marc and Tim have not yet had a chance to get back with me on the
proposal they have before them.  Seems they are busy right now. :)

I only followed that Great Task Debate somewhat.  I sallied forth an opinion
when they were sought.  I don\'t know the principles, nor have I looked
through digests to figure that out.  I followed things a little here and
then jumped in when I saw something I disagreed with.  I turned it into a
thread and stated (or didn\'t state) what my intentions were, as I knew them
at that time.  I have no idea what you mean starting with "Another: ...".

Don\'t take my comments so seriously.  At the point that I weighed in, I did
so because I wanted to point out certain things.  I admit that I had always
heard exemplary comments about what goes on here (not the flaming part, but
the exchange of ideas) but I have had only an impression of what "canon" is,
which perception I admit may be flawed.

Like I said, I am trying to learn because I do want to participate.  Do not
confuse any enthusiasm on my part for insults.  I do not try to insult
anyone and more than anyone else, want to do things for this version of
Traveller that we are seeing formed before our eyes.

>We are not telling you how to run your life, just asking that you abide by
>the conventions of the TML and back up your statements.

Willing here, but you are going to have to tolerate a ramp-up on my side.
I may not have a chance to respond to everything here, but I do keep up on
the posts on this subject, and I rely upon my team to mention things that
they think I should know about.  Hopefully the info I provided above will
take care until I can get the post promised for 7/10, through the TERRA
mailing list for comments.

There were willing participants, and others.  They may have known what they

That sounds like the TML I was looking for.  I look forward to any time
that I can spare here in the future.  However, I am not sure what to make
of all of this "quoted sources" protocol.  I guess I\'ll just say that I
have noted the irritation it raises.  I have some perceptions that I
_know_ are valid about the Traveller universe, but I don\'t carry a brief-
case of annotated references.  In this case, it happens that part of the
research we are doing has provided us with a working list of sources that
one of the researchers made note of along the way.

I am being sure that we are not blamed for \'you did this to the Traveller
universe.\'  I think that those who have come before me (T4 I refer to
specifically) have done a good job, and I only hope that we can rise to
the occasion.

>You are not taking part in this.  You are trying to control the debate,
>lord over everyone, and set yourself up as some sort of uber-guru.  Sorry,
>not a chance.

Definitely not a chance.  I hit an entrance ramp only to find at the end
that the right-hand lane is moving at 85, and I only entered doing 40.  I
do see what I was participating in was a "what if" exercise.  If I don\'t
write a RoM sourcebook, I will have had the pleasure of participating in
something that I personally am interested in from the Traveller perspective.
By the time I need to be, I\'ll be up to 150 in the left lane. :)

Since the sourcebook is only an idea now, I am indulging myself in some
participation on the TML now.  Nothing more.  I am more than willing to
tolerate misimpressions, but I won\'t stand for a continuing assault.  Keep
the temper on the low burner and take the time to figure out (or ask me)
what I mean or am up to, and I\'ll be happy to clear up any misunderstanding
immediately.

OK, so I got a little tired of having someone "conclude" something about
me, and then hear it echoed from elsewhere.  I did say that I respected
Dave\'s opinion.  Insulting you?  I seem to have broken through the commo
barrier between us.  Can we get back to being civilized, no name-calling
and discuss some Trav?

As for Harold, I defer to one of his past quotes after an argument over
on the HIWG list.  Something like, "So we are opinionated bastards."
Leave Harold and I to ourselves, and it will work itself out.  The last
(recent) argument we had resulted in my deciding to "get more involved"
in the game that I have loved since 1975 (when I learned D&D and figured
out that I wanted Traveller).  I see Harold has taken a page from my
latest book (going for the TC editorship) so I am glad he influenced me
to influence him (I hope).

Well, we are talking civil like and all.  Sometimes (in my experience),
it just takes try, try again.  I did it and I am feelin a little better
about this whole thang.  Has this exposure done anything?

As for the "insulting, rude and no concept of netiquette", that is probably
J.P. coming through in my posts. :)  (I had to say that J.P., you know
what I mean--come on smile. :)

Well, at least you are persistant.  Like me! :)

All right.  This note took a little longer, but the ray of light was there. :)
I ran this note through the insult filter.  I wasn\'t annoyed, so nobody
else should be either. :)

Due to the flawed nature of infrastructure cost NOT depending on population
large nations/planets will always have as much infrastructure as they want.
China and Inda IMHO have less infrastructure and cannot therefore utilize
thir people in the same way as US can.

Rattlesnakes have small pockets on their heads sensitive to IR. By scanning
with their heads they can "image" in IR in a crude sort of way.
Rattlesnakes attack warm lightbulbs entered into their cage even if they
can see them with their normal vision which to me implies that they rely on
that sense a lot.

occured to me that a custom designed ship, mostly a military ship, would
want to pool their HPG resources.

You could take the total available HPG output to "overpower" some weapons
in order to get better diff mods.

The other advantage is that the HPG can be more than 50% of the volume of
the mount, which corresponds to a overly large mount when you dont want the
height to be 3 or 4 decks.  I\'ll explain:

A TL15 Laser 175Mj Turret has surface area of 10 m2 and a vol of 42 m3

A Modified TL15 Laser 175Mj only needs a surface area of 5 m2 and a vol of
10 m3 and HPG vol of about 31m3

The big advantage is in surface area, and on a military ship it can get
tight.  The other is the sub-location of the HPG.  Protecting it deep
within the ship instead of having it so close to the outer hull.

I agree that there should be some sort of trade off for having to route
that much power around a ship.  How about 10% of the volume that would
normally be used for HPG vol added to the mount vol and still requiring the
full amount of HPG sub-located somewhere else on the ship.


Architects please take some time to try this out.  If you have ever custom
designed a ship this would change the way you look at things.

I will not raise the subject of how many weapons are fired at one time vs
HPG capacity as that would be another can of worms.

I only raise these questions because to me it would be the logical way to
do things.

always bothered us when playing the game was the ability of the Imperial
player to make appeals to the Emperor.  Now, you might think that the
penalty of -1 on the victory index for each appeal is enough of a
disincentive, but one of the perverse things about the game is that if you
win a war, you lose the peace.  For those not familiar with the game,
Imperium simulates the series of wars (1st through 9th interstellar)
between the Terrans and the Imperium - you fight until one side loses, you
then have a period of peace, and then war starts again.  The side that
lost the last war gets a larger budget and is better prepared for the next
war.

  The problem is the Terran player has no way of manipulating the outcome
of each war, other than on the battlefield.  The Imperial player, who is
actually the local commander, not the Emperor, can manipulate the outcome
both by battlefield performance and by making appeals to the Emperor.
Thus, just by fighting the Terrans to a standstill (not an unreasonable
objective, since the game is well balanced) the Imperial player can lose
every war and eventually win the game by winning the peace periods.

  Now, one might argue that this is simply an accurate measure of reality
- - if the local authorities had called for Imperial aid the nasty Terran
upstarts would have been crushed.  However, the local authorities didn\'t
want to appeal to the Emperor that often, since they might lose their
jobs.  This is nowhere reflected in the rules - there is no disincentive
for the Imperial player appealing to the Emperor, and when we played
the Imperial player would routinely do it every turn of war.

  Now, we never came up with a fix for this - I had a couple of stubborn
Solomani friends who kept telling me they could win with the Terrans, if
they could just find the right strategy.  They didn\'t, and we moved on to
other games.  Damn, I just realized that was over fifteen years ago - my,
how time flies when you\'re playing Traveller.

  I\'m just curious if other folks had this same problem, and if they
developed a method to deal with it.  I remembered joking we needed
something like making the Imperial player drink a shot of vodka every time
he made an appeal - we figured that would be a fair handicap, but we never
tried it.

Supposedly Catchy Title: Some Really Dull Underlying Theme.


Despite not even getting close to 100 TML posts, I do pay attention
to what goes on, and as Leroy G. is bringing us close to another
canon dispute I thought I\'d share with you some insights from another
hobby of mine: religion.  (Or do I mean hobby-horse?)

The debate on canon in Christianity centres on the Bible, and views 
may be divided into three camps: canonist, moderate and syncretist.
(These are not the usual labels but as good as any.)

Canonists take the fundamental position of the Bible as normative: 
the text defines their beliefs.  This doesn\'t imply an unthinking 
attitude: many canonists devote considerable time to studying the 
text in an informed way.  Apparent self-contradictions in the text 
will be explained in sophisticated ways, with roughly equal emphasis 
on retaining a belief in canon as normative and getting a plausible 
resolution, in practice.

Moderates accept the text as guidelines, to be followed as a default 
and assuming some underlying content and theme, but if they see a 
sufficient reason for assuming something else to be true, that\'s not 
usually a problem.  Some contradictions in the text are expected, and 
either dismissed as unimportant or resolved in favour of one or the 
other.

Syncretists accept many sources of truth -- the reader, not the text, 
is the norm.  (Yes, I know this is postmodernism.)  The text is a 
useful source of ideas, but there is no need for any two people to 
draw the same conclusions from it: all readings of a text are valid.


How is this relevant to Traveller?  Well, there\'s a lot of muttering
about canon on TML, so it might be a good idea to understand the
range of views: is there One Traveller Background (canonist),
A Distinct Traveller Theme (moderate) or A Whole World Of
Possibilities (syncretist)?  You get the idea, anyway.

It might be helpful if you wanted some realistic religions in 
Traveller that weren\'t either obvious frauds or utter weirdos to have 
some relatively rational patterns of belief, a/a.  A moderate 
religion might be one which believed sharing meals to be an 
appropriate symbol of harmony and celebration, for instance, and 
engaged in nothing more sinister than the odd pot roast.  Their holy 
writings might include recipes!  (Fish Friars? Chip Monks?)

The K\'Kree are definitely canonist.

These aren\'t labels to beat people over the head with, but I can\'t 
help thinking that there\'s a nice ring to Eris the Syncretist 8-)

Actually there are four Highland regiments: (In order of seniority)
     The Royal Highland Fusiliers
     The Black Watch
     The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)
                    (formed in 1995)
     The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders
  Plus two Lowland Regiments:
     The Royal Scots
                  (the senior line infantry regiment)
     The Kings Own Scottish Borderers
                  (senior to all the Highland regiments except the Royal
                   Highland Fusiliers)
The Lowland Regiments don\'t wear kilts, but tartan trews which are
almost as good.

This does not include the many other Highland and Lowland regiments
in other commonwealth nations, or the ones in the Gulf States (the Royal
Omani (camel) Mounted Police Pipe Band is a sight to behold).

The other kilted British Regiment (with pipes) is the Royal Irish
Regiment. The Scots Guards and The Irish Guards both have pipes
as well. That\'s 9 regiments out of the total of 30. Plus several other
regiments (The Light Infantry springs to mind) have some anticedants
from older Highland and Lowland Regiments.

Given the popularity of Highland regiments, I\'d say there would be a
large number of 3I regiments which would trace their ancestry to
ancient Terran Scottish regiments. I wouldn\'t go as far as to say the Kilt
is part of all Marine No 1\'s, but I\'d say it would be for a fair number.

Leroy, there is a little invention called writing that allows one century
to affect other centuries millenia down the road of time. Information is
quite hard to lose. To paraphrase L. Sprauge de Camp, not even the most
dedicated barbarian can destroy a book when the minimum edition is 5000
copies. When information is confined to a few hundred hand-written books 
it can be done fairly easily. Once you start printing them it becomes
more difficult, but as long as it\'s confined to one world it can be done.
With electronic media it can be temporarily rendered unavailable. But to
lose it copletely takes a concatenation of unfortunate events. Once the 
information is spread out across a few dozen worlds it becomes even more
difficult. Of course, if _every_ world in a galaxy is thrown back into
barbary long enough for even permanent data storage media to deteriorate
then you can actually lose it. And if it is confined to a few places 
(like secret, proprietary recently developed technology) then you can
lose it. But in the present case, every _mature_ technology known to the
RoM would also be known to the Syleans. That they were temporarily down
to TL 10 during the Long Night must be down to economic factors, because
there\'s no way a planet-full of universities is going to lose the
information once they have it.
 
Hence the TL of the RoM cannot have been higher than TL 12 going on 13.

It didn\'t take the Syleans 500 years to invent TL 12, because they already
had the knowledge. It took them 500 years to advance economically to TL 12.
The problem is that you can\'t use the same argument to explain why it took
them 450 years to advance to TL 13, because in the meantime Sylea became
the central world of the vast economic engine we call the 3rd Imperium.

One thing we might as well resign us to once and for all is that wrt
scientific progress things don\'t work the same way in the Traveller
Universe as they do in the Real World. The massive scientific spurts of
the Terrans and the Darrians are freak occurences. (Or possibly the Terran
scientific progress from TL 3 to TL 8/9 is normal enough, but there\'s a
"wall" around TL 9/10 which we\'ll hit soon (the problem with that one is
that we\'ll have to revise it as the real world progresses). In any case,
in the Traveller Universe, independent scientific advancement above TL 10
or so is evidently horrendously difficult (and the Darrian progress was a
freak occurrence).

Hi just a quick question for the list. Is there a way to convert
CT NPC stats to T4 stats? I need to crew a couple of Corsair\'s,
a pirate base and a merc assault team. I don\'t have time to roll
up the NPC\'s but I have a couple of CT books full of NPC stats
for various useful vocations. Or should I use the stats out of the
books?
Thanks in advance
Dave

No simply killing is much too lenient.
Have your "friend" play "Exit Visa" over and over again - that\'ll teach

That might be the bugs own term. Anything non-sentient can be eaten and

not then they are vegetable and might be eaten.

This is a good idea if you want to have a customized ship. Beware of the
fact that integrated HPG turret (and barbette) are designed to be standart
and to adapt any socket. The only need is to have the correct power
ressource on the ship.

Personnally I could use such special intallations, but the lasers may be
hard to find. You need turret sized lasers without HPG banks. the price
maight be severly increased if you want such items. 

I would use such device on warships (because they are more effective). But
not on regular ships.

I don\'t know, Must ask a specialist. This depends of the easyness to carry
energy peaks (MJ) through wires.

I agree with out that it\'s logical. But if you use such device you have to
decide if they are standart weapons or not. If they are does the regular
turret (with HPG) still standart?

Up to you!

Hm, well, I guess you could say that the RoM was "more dynamic" in the
same way that Canada or the US would be "more dynamic" if their
respective governments liquidated themselves and told their populaces
"well, you\'re on your own now...". The RoM was, for the most part,
a period of chaos, socially.

> Look at how little time the Solomani spent at TL\'s 5-11 for instance.

This could be attributed to Terra\'s rather perfect climate with
respect to humans. The Vilani had a slightly less forgiving homeworld.
Then again, the Vilani had computers when a lot of Terrans were just
getting the hang of chipping flint spearheads.

Ah-ha. Now, this is one of the best arguments for having a higher
RoM TL than anything else. If the Solomani brought their tech to the 
Darrians and propelled them from Tl 10 to 16 in ~600 years, then
the influx of new Terran technical information should have done
_something_ to the Vilani Empire.

Yes. The Vilani technology control laws were largely related to the
_commercial_ aspects of technology - i.e. who got paid for it. Now,
while no technology is going to develop much without commercial
backing, it could be possible that Vilani scientists (such as they are)
could have developed technology quite ahead of the Vilani "mainstream",
but which was never put into major commercial production.

When the Terrans arrived, the loosening of these control laws would
have cause a massive flood of new technology onto the market,
from both Vilani and Terran sources.

Well, the second doesn\'t necessarily imply the first... research into
the unknown was a social taboo (for the lack of a better word) in
Vilani culture. This manifested itself in laws which severely controlled
the deployment of new technology and who got paid for it, which was
pretty important to the mercantile Vilani. (Contrast this with Terrans,
who are currently harvesting genetic material from small gene pools,
like "lost jungle tribes" and Amish communities and using it for research
without even consulting the donors of said material, much less paying them
based on useful findings).

This doesn\'t imply, however, that there were no Vilani scientists
and that research wasn\'t being done. Obviously, the Vilani built
a strong technical base for themselves before moving out and conquering
the universe. I think that all those scientists-types, who had been
somewhat, but not completely supressed under the "old regieme" of the
1st Imperium would have not only come out and flourished, but been
welcomed by the conquering Terrans. After all, exploration and research
are much more important to the Terrans, who would likely put these
scientific types into positions where they could finally put their
research into action.

No wonder the Vilani hated the RoM so much. Without trying to sound too racist,
imagine aliens conquering pre-WW2 Germany and putting Jewish people
in charge of everything. Heck, imagine any situation where a disliked
minority population is put in a position of leadership across the board.

There\'d be social unrest and upheaval, along with a lot of scientific
and technological advances. No wonder the Vilani call it the "Ramshakle
Empire".

thanks for the info.  that\'ll let me kludge something together.  as a word 
to IG, can you please get some better editors ?  mentioning rules that 
don\'t (yet ?) appear elsewhere in the system is BAD form.  also, little 
things like leaving stats for some weapons blank and placing them under 
other entries are BAD form as well.  the books are more expensive than 
comparably sized rpg books (a larger GURPS book would run $17.95 or so).  
i\'d really appreciate some of the greater expense to go into editing.

Dang! Sounds almost like a Bolo Mk.5 from one of Keith Laumer\'s books.
If
General Motors ever gets to build this thing, it would be just too
creepy
(GM built the Bolos).

One explanation for the flush mountings would be to minimize the
possibility of damage from fragmentation and non-catastrophic direct
fire
and to provide 360 degree coverage for the defensive systems. As weapon
systems get smarter and smarter, their point of attack "window" on the
body of the target is going to increase. Case in point are tactical 
missiles which mimic the Harpoon\'s(?) capability of low-level flight
followed by a sharp gain in altitude and plunge to strike the top of a
target, a place lightly armored in comparison with the rest of the
target.

I\'d be interested in the power source for the rail gun and the size of
its
round. IIRC, a KEAP round doesn\'t have to be large to be deadly. Even if
it doesn\'t go fast enough to turn to plasma on contact, just penetrating
a
target can kill/disable enough crew members with spall for a "mission
kill".

I\'ve even heard that if a high velocity round goes completely _through_
a target, a vacuum effect occurs which can injure all the crew in an
affected compartment (burst eardrums, eye damage, etc). Don\'t know if
it\'s true, though.

Perhaps you should note that you only have PC software. Lots of good Mac
software exists for Traveller but to my knowledge there\'s no one place to
find it all.
If you\'re interested in hosting ALL software including Mac for Traveller
I\'ll gladly send you a copy of my starsystem-flesher-outer app.

About TL10 - TL12 with the following modifications -

* Detonation lasers rather than missiles for space based combat.

This feels about right. Remember that 2300AD is not set in the Traveller

descended from Twilight:2000.

	Nope. Marc felt it was too distracting from the core of Traveller, and we
were way over on page count as it was. Not that you\'re prohibited from
using stuff from the original FF&S, or even creating your own. Just that
official efforts are going to concentrate the limited available energy on
official technology.

	I\'d use much more than the flat percentage of damage to be
repaired--fixing part of a complex system is usually more expensive than
the original cost to install that part. As long as it\'s still cheaper than
replacing the entire system. Thus, if it cost Cr400,000 to manufacture and
install the broken part as part of the original manufacturing process,
it\'ll probably cost twice that to remove the damaged part (big labor
costs), buy the replacement part (repaired any cars lately? Mucho dineros),
reinstall the part, and put everything else back together around it (labor
again).

	So you\'re saying most of the human population is mediocre at best? That\'s
a pretty low opinion.

>chance.

	Again, you\'re assuming a specific task system where a -2 isn\'t a big deal.
Pull up, for example, the MT task system. Take a formidable task (roll 15+
on 2d6). Skill-1 Stat-11 has a modifier of 3--he\'ll succeed only on
boxcars. Skill-4 Stat-8 has a modifier of 5--he\'ll succeed on 10+. THAT\'S
the kind of task system I\'d like to see.

>  To get what you describe, one must not allow a roll

	Again, I don\'t like that. Part of the thrill of gaming is making that
"one-in-a-million" shot, because you\'re desperate. No, I wouldn\'t normally
let a Med-1 perform open heart surgery. But what if you\'re three parsecs
from the nearest hospital and Med-4, your jump drive is out, and the
Captain will die if you don\'t operate? You pull up the heart surgery
chapter on the computer, cross your fingers, and pray.

>agree that skill counts for more than talent.

	Who said skill counted MORE than talent? I just want them to count more
equally. When talent ranges from 2 to 15, and skill ranges from 0 to 7,
talent counts TWICE as much as skill. I don\'t care how talented you are,
skill is just as important.

prepare for the virus with their Domain of Deneb allies because the Virus 
had to cross clan boundaries on the other side of the rift. They all had 
different computer designs/software/connection protocols and this slowed 
virus propagation down through Aslan space.

Can\'t really be measured on the same scale.  2300AD has no artificial
gravity (ships and stations require spun habitats), and requires reaction
drives for planetary landings, but they have the materials science to
build beanstalks and laser & plasma weapons, though binary-propellant and
gauss weapons still seem to be common.  The jump-drive scale is useless,
since 2300AD uses "stutterwarp" instead, which is much faster and less
quantized in effect.

TL9 or 10 with significant variants?

OK, before I get going on this, let me say that I\'m
not holding the position that the RoM _did_ achieve
TL 13/14/15. I\'m saying that they _could_ have.
Just to make sure I don\'t offend any canon-mongers out there
(like myself...)

OK. Yes, information is hard to lose. Impossible? I think it\'s
easier than you imagine. There\'s already information that was
generated this century that\'s lost. The media is still good too.
It\'s just that there aren\'t any media-readers left to read the
information! Old tapes from mainframes, this sort of thing.
Now, most of this is data, not useful information, so this isn\'t
a big deal. However a lot of information, especially the really
high-tech cutting edge stuff isn\'t really "written down". If there
was to be a gigantic, global economic recession, which is essentially
what the Long Night was all about, a lot of businesses would 
fold up and the knowledge "contained" in these businesses would be
largely lost, especially the really leading edge stuff. If every 
technological device disappeared off Earth tomorrow, but every book
stayed, would our TL be affected? (More on this below).

Hm, well... for example, Sylea State might have had a large vacuum
studies department during the ZS and the RoM. The RoM falls, space
travel dries up to nothing over the next few hundred years. If there\'s
no space travel, how are you going to justify a budget for the Vacuum 
Studies dept? Several hundred years later, when space travel is going
along again, sure, the Vacuum Studies dept. will be doing great again,
but you don\'t think they\'ll have lost a single post-it note? They\'ll
be lucky if they can get back to where they were 1000 years ago, much less
700.

Also, the Darrians lost TL 16, for the most part. Why can\'t the Syleans
lose TL 13? Or 14 even?

Also, I think there\'s a big economic factor inside TL (as you allude to).
It takes a lot of infrastructure and supporting industries to build
things like Vacc Suits or any high-tech piece of equipment. While it
was failing, the RoM probably had a very stable, interstellar high-tech
infrastructure that wouldn\'t be duplicated until the mid to late
Third Imperium. If the Syleans are still ramping up their material science
technologies to TL 12, they can\'t do anything about TL 13 - they haven\'t
got the infrastructure. (Maybe I should go buy a copy of PE...)

As I said above, if every "technological" device on Earth disappeared,
would our TL drop? You bet! We\'d know how everything works, but we\'d have
nothing to build it with. It takes a long time to get to the point
where you can build a semiconductor chip-fab plant, even if you know
how to.
  
> Hence the TL of the RoM cannot have been higher than TL 12 going on 13.
> QED.

Hm, well, I don\'t think it\'s QED that easily.

For example, to re-hash the Vacc Suit example:

It\'s the RoM. Imagine a fairly populated vacuum world. They rely
heavily on imported food, but do well, as they export a large amount
of raw and processed metal goods, as well as various things that
require fairly hard vacuum for manufacturing purposes. They have no
raw material for plastics or the like though, as it is (like I said)
a vacuum world, but they do import raw material for... making
vacc suits. As a matter of fact, they\'re really good at making vacc
suits, they make the best damn suits in the whole sector. 

As the RoM begins to falter, the shipments of food and other raw materials
begin to come more erratically. People begin to leave the world
as its economy slows down. Eventually interstellar shipping stops
completely, leaving the remaining inhabitants to concentrate on keeping
themselves alive (if possible). Chances are, the knowledge of vacc suit
manufacture that they had would be lost, for a long, long time. It might
be lost forever effectively, until someone re-discovers it.

Anyways, I think you\'re being too optimistic Hans. The Long Night was
long, cold, nasty and brutish, to paraphrase someone who\'d name I\'ve
forgotten.

	I sorta solved this by photocopying them, and as I read PE for the first
time, I make notes of the relevant DM\'s and the page number where these
tables are mentioned.

	I think there should also have been a full synopsis of all die rolls and
stages of planetary development etc in one section. Also some more charts
for creating all this data would have been useful too.

	But I won\'t take too much away from PE, I too agree that it really is an
excellent addition to the Traveller universe. Congrats etc to all that
worked on it.

No there is a Traveller Quaternarty - CT, MT, TNE, and T4, four systems

If mass in Metric Tons is less than volume in cubic meters (aka

I think you might be overlooking some viable other alternatives:
        Multiple fully reuseable stages
        Lifting-body designs (No wings...)
        Thruster based VTOL craft (One died recently..forgot name)
        Dirigibles to high altitude, and thrust out from there...
NASA and ESA did some early think-work on a multi-stage, fully reuseable
craft. It was a rocket-glider 1st stage, and a lifting-body second stage.
Both had pilots.

You\'re a loony, is what you is.  :)

<story about piping golfers to the smurfs theme snipped>

When I was in the 197th Inf Bde, we ran past Brigade HQs every morning for
PT.  As we ran past, the loudspeakers would be playing appropriate martial
music, one of which was "The Liberty Bell" aka The Monty Python Flying
Circus Theme.  One fine morning we were directly in front of the building,
as the music was ending and the Colonel was walking past, and on that last
note all 225 of us went "Ppppllbbttt!!"  

We got the oddest look.  A few days later there was new music.

A great example of this, for anyone who\'s interested in archaeology and its
discontents, are the "ancient Celtic megaliths" in New England, like the
"sacrificial altar" at Mystery Hill.  It\'s been pretty clearly demonstrated
that these are the remains of 18th-19th century farmhouse foundations, root
cellars, and heavy tools.  The "sacrifical altar," for example, is a device
for processing lye into soap, of the sort built in the 19th century.  A set
of stone rings termed a "temple" by pop archaeologists is suspiciously
similar (well, all but identical) to horse-powered bark mills (for
producing tanning chemicals) as explained and illustrated in farming
almanacs and handbooks of the early 1800s.

In this case, these basic "household industrial" technologies simply fell
out of use so quickly and thoroughly in the late 1800s-early 1900s that
their remains became explainable only as mysterious, ancient artifacts.
Probably many of them were built and used by the great-grandparents of
local residents who, in the early and middle part of this century, assumed
they were prehistoric relics.

This happened in a highly literate civilization, with a stable political
structure and economy.  No collapse of political authority, no
disintegration of the wider economy, no cutoff from the centers of
knowledge and research and all that good stuff.  A couple hours\' train ride
to Yale, Harvard, Princeton, New York, Boston.  Yet, if those surveys of
college students\' beliefs in Bigfoot and UFOs and a nuclear-powered
Ramayana can be extended to this, a majority of the educated classes in the
USA is more likely to believe these stone structures were built by
colonizing Celts a thousand years ago.

Given the limits of social memory on one hand, and and the guidance of
popular mythologies on the other, it seems to me to be hard *not* to lose
knowledge of technology, in the broader sense of the term.

My inclination is not to allow this. As you\'ve noticed, the HPG is most of
the mass of high-TL weapons (especially lasers); if you allow them to be
shared it makes all the published starship designs completely obsolete.
The rationale for not allowing it is that the peak power transferred from the
HPG to the weapon is so high that the cables carrying it have to be very,
very short, otherwise you lose too much power in transit. (I suppose as an
optional rule you could allow it - with a 50% increase in the input energy
of a weapon for each other weapon sharing it\'s HPG - which would negate most
(but not all) of the advantage at a cost of increasing the power requirement for
the weapon.)

No, we do know how they were made. Pile a bunch of rocks on top of each other
and you get a pyramid. Try this in your back yard - very straightforward.

To build a *big* pyramid, you need square rocks, and tens of thousands of 
cheap labourers. Convieniently, in the off-season, such labour was indeed
available in Egypt.

Cathedrals - or buildings with open spaces in them - are hard; if the 
ancient egyptians had build cathedrals I would be willing to admit there was
some mystery. Mostly-solid pyramids are easy. To believe ET help was required
for the pyramids is (a) arrogant (only Europeans can build big buildings!),
and (b) requires you to believe that someone gave the Egyptians miraculous
anti-gravity rock technology but neglected to teach them, say, basic archi-
techture that would have allowed them to build something more intereting than
a pyramid. Sigh.

(Setting aside the question of how the original pyramids were made, we certainly
could easily build comparable ones today...)

A point J.P. has tried to make with me for years.  I\'ve been considering
doing a Master\'s thesis on just this subject.  (I\'ll concede that today\'s
analogies may not hold into the Traveller universe.  And overall your
point is well taken.)  I still have to run down a source one of my professors
gave me.  The basic idea is that as technology changes, so do the methods
of storage, etc.  I\'m not saying any of this is on purpose, but that it is
accidental.  A lot of data is used and then discarded because it becomes
too costly to keep, or transfer to the latest storage medium.  It takes a
dedicated storage plan to do what you have suggested.

You may be right, that universities accomplish this, but I don\'t see any
evidence today.  Look at the Internet.  Take my web page for example.  I
have a copy at home--my "development" machine.  The "production" site is
hosted on one of the numerous computer systems at CU Denver.  Backups are
taken.  There is no "coherent" system that would allow someone to look
through the backups and determine that there was this web page dedicated to
Scouts or High Guard that would be neat to recover and examine the content
of.  The whole image dump would have to be recovered and then sifted through
item by item to determine usefullness.  I\'m picturing the Monks of Technology
looking file by file to see what is where.

One of the biggest problems plaguing the field of Computer Science today is
management of data, archives, and object-oriented libraries.  We have the
stuff, but nobody can use it because they don\'t begin to know where to look.

Don\'t interpret this litany to mean that I challenge the basic point you
made.  I just want to point out that it may not be that simple.  (Maybe
J.P. will see the point I have tried to make for a long, long time now.)

>QED.

Well, you have an excellent basic premise, but I can not immediately jump
to the conclusion that you reached.  Here\'s why:

  1) If our little Tech 8 (?) planetary network is the shape of things
     to come (and I am not sure why it would not be), the nature of info
     on tech will be a more distributed version of things.  Your scenario
     works if the university is in the business of archive/retrieval
     systems.  There is a _lot_ of "stuff" out there that is strictly
     proprietary as well, and would not necessarily be available to a
     university.  NASA is an exception, and it is more and more business
     like.  I was a subscriber to the NASA Tech Briefs for a while, and
     you had to have a certain background before you could receive that
     brief.  So "free flow of info" goes only so far with governments.

  2) Even if you had access to the information, you would not necessarily
     have the required infrastructure to support it.  Two cases in point:
     Hub/Ershur, on the same J-1 main as Sylea and not too far from the
     future 3I capital, is Tech Level 13.  The Syleans don\'t have to even
     have this RoM archive, unless it is on Hub, which was a RoM capital
     even earlier.  You could make the same case for it, only now we are
     concerned with TL14 as a limiting level.  Now, same idea, Gemid is
     in the proximity of Vland and it (in M0) is TL14, so the why doesn\'t
     it have TL15 RoM knowledge?  (But see three [3] below.)

  3) What this assessment really comes down to is "Do we have the tech
     knowledge?"  Then comes, "Do we have the _ability_ to do something
     with it."  You make the argument in another post that we are talking
     about the vast economic sphere of the TI.  Well not quite yet.  It
     is the vast 3I in the formation.  It wouldn\'t have been the 3I at all
     if not for just a few years ago, an industrialist with a name that
     starts with a "C" starts organizing things.  Why?  Because it is good
     for business.  Not because he wants to be Emperor and start ordering
     people around (or having them killed).  Take a page from Pocket Empires
     as I suggested in the piece you tagged above.  It takes dedication and
     allocation of Resources to raise your tech level.  Perhaps having a
     vast data archive helps, but the basic choice is still there.  I\'m not
     so sure that it is in Cleon\'s best interests to be raising the tech of
     Sylea.  It may be, in the case of the early-TI, late-Sylean Federation,
     companies to do so.  It depends on a lot more complex factors.
     Remember, until Cleon came along, the SF was just a large economic
     sphere that he came to dominate enough to justifiably call himself
     Emperor.  That "long view" is just beginning to congeal around the
     time of Milieu 0.

     J.P. made the same mistake in talking about the Aslan Hierate with
     me not too long ago.  In M0, the Aslan don\'t even have "Hierate" in
     their vocabulary.  They have the Tlaukhu, but the Hierate we all
     know and love is the product of a thousand (or more) years of
     evolution.  The same can be said of the TI in M0.

Everything suggested so far has been composed within a timespan of less
than 200 years. Why would the Third Imperium ever use a 3000 year old piece
of music? More likely, they would probably have used a relatively
contemporary piece when originally choosing an Anthem. That\'s what happened
with most of the National Anthems on present Earth. So the Third Imperium\'s
or the Emperor\'s Anthem wouldn\'t probably be older than from -200 at the
max. It might even have changed several times in history (the Civil War
being a good bet).

Another point is this: Think about what has happened to (western) music in
300 years! Music in year 0 or 1100 would probably be completely
incomprehensible to us now. We might not even recognize it as music. One
wonders if J.S. Bach would recognize Front 242 (one of my favorites) as
music at all - my girlfriend has her doubts :-)

All in all, I think both Traveller and this mailing list has a tendency to
display not only ethnocentricity, but also \'chronocentricity\' (just
invented the word). This is not to preach political correctness - heck, my
campaigns too are populated by dominantly white/caucasian/whatever people,
because that is my frame of reference. It\'s just that I sometimes catch
myself in taking such thing for granted, which is actually completely
unrealistic. It\'s a damn shame, because I think the game could get much
more exotic and give a much better SF feel if you could avoid this. Anyone
else feel they have this problem? What do you do about it?

Howver, I disagree with some of the design decisions.

Specifically, I\'m with Anders, in that I disagree with Infrastructure
being dependant on World Size rather than population.

As an example, I\'d like to cite Australia, which has a population of
17 million people, resources of about 10 and infrastructure of about
three for 90% of the continent. As an example, except for the coastal
strip from Perth to Townsville, we have three sealed road links and
no railways. 90% of the outback relies on unsurfaced roads and dirt
airstrips for transport and portable generators for power. Education 
is via distance, or by one-teacher schools, except for a small 
university in Darwin and a couple of small technical schools.

The south-east corner, on the other hand, has a Infrastructure rating
of about seven (couple of steel mills, lots of power plants, sealed
roads, rail links, good ports, fibre-optic communication links, first-
world hospital systems, first-world education systems). For this part
of the country, the Outback is economically irrelevant, except for 
"islands" of development such as Mount Isa and other mining towns
(Australia\'s resource industries are poorly "articulated" into the rest
of the economy, except that foriegn income earned from them affects
the value of the Australian dollar, and thus affects the other import-
and export-industries of Australia).

Development of the Inland hasnt happened, essentially because of a
lack of water resources to support large populations. We have stuck
to the coast, because that is where the water is, and water for
Australia is the relevant constraint on development.

Imagine for a second Australia contacts a mob of aliens, who proceed
to uplift us from TL8 to TL10. Will this pattern of development change ?
I think not. 90% of the population will still live in the cities on
the coastal strip, and this area will develop even more infrastructure.
Islands of development will still occour in the Outback, probably
where resources are concentrated, but the spaces between the islands
will still remain undeveloped. In this, it doesnt matter how big the
gaps between the "islands" of development are, because you will put
the infrastracture where the people are.

I think this will be a fairly standard model of development. It also
fits with what I know of Alaska (another recently-colonized, high-resource
province that is still mostly undeveloped) and the development of
Siberia.

In short, infrastructure is a modifier on your labour force, so it\'s
cost should primarily be based on the size of the labour force, with
a modifier to reflect the tyrrany of distance.

Page 45 has the cost of infrastructure maintainence dependant on the
size of the economy (the GWP) not the size of the planet. This is correct,
but should also be more expensive for bigger worlds, to reflect the
increased costs in maintaining longer-distance transport links.

I dont like the military model - I would prefer to translate the military
budget into megacredits, and then buy and build ships and play a
"Trillion Credit Squadron" kind of game. This will better reflect the
advantages of high technology on starship combat.

As an aside, Fusion Plus is very very low on my list of 3I technological
advantages. Top of the list are the key military technologies of
Meson Screens and Nuclear Dampers. Fusion plus is merely an increase
in power-generating efficiency of 150% or so. Meson Screens and Nuke
Dampers allow what is impossible for a TL11 and below society to achieve
- - stopping Meson and Nuclear attacks.

At TL11, the size of military ships shrinks a lot, as navies build more
smaller ships to try and counter the Meson Gun super-weapon. A TL12
navy can thus get a size advantage, by building big ships again, protected
from those lethal automatic internals by having big, thick meson screens,
and sweep aside their technologically-challenged adversaries.

I have big big big problems with the idea of Resource Trade outside 
the framework of a Pocket Empire. Firstly, it is silly that a world that 
has no trade agreements with anybody for finished goods, but can still
trade raw materials for finished goods (ie extra GWP). This is the %$#@%
Long Night - there *is* no widespread interstellar trade. Resource
trade should only be possible within an economic structure, and should
have costs associated with the level of piracy and privateering in
that area, over and above the raw costs of moving the resources.

I am also surprised at the lack of rules for subsidizing the movement of
population. One of the things that moved Australia from it\'s pre-WW2
population of 6 million or so to it\'s current level of 17 million or
so was a government policy of assisted migration - the "ten pound Pom"
system. Assuming traveller standard costs of Cr8000 per parsec for
middle passengers, with 2 tons of personal goods - moving someone therefore
costs Cr10 000 per parsec. Therefore moving 1000 people 1 parsec costs
MCr10. So moving 50 000 people 10 parsecs would cost ... MCr5000. Or on or
about 1 RU, given the costings in PE page 41. Can anyone poke holes in 
this logic ?

OK, you *may* have problems when you get to the other end, with ethnic 
conflict and so on (as an aside, the postwar Immigration Minister, Arthur
Calwell, literally scoured the displaced persons camps after WW2 for
nordic-looking aryans, so that the first few boats of "displaced persons"
migrants would reassure the quite-racist Australians of the time that we
werent going to be taken over by Italians, Greeks and other such "wogs".
The Greeks, Yugoslavs and Italians who made up most of the postwar intake
were assigned to later boats), and it could be a good idea to build up
the colony\'s infrastructure first. But, heck, it beats waiting for the
slow growth rates on page 54, although once you have bitten the bullet
and bought that class C starport you can get pretty respectable numbers
of self-funded migrants, if you are a low-pop, high-tech, hi-resource
planet.

While speaking of colonisation, can you colonise a non-mainworld ? I am 
thinking of where you have a existing TL0-3 minor race that will take
forever to get uplifted, due to the p52 "No accelerated free uplift"
rules. So why not leave them there, and plant a colony somewhere else
in the system ? I mean, if they have an asteroid belt and a couple
of gas giants, why cant you leave the locals oblivious on their
planet, set the colony elsewhere in the system, and then say "g\'day"
once they get to TL, say, 4 ? If you are worried about the ethics
of exploiting "their" system, set up a "trust fund" for \'em ...
"Hi. We\'re strangers from the stars. We did a bit of mining in
your system a while back, and invested your royalties for you. Your 
broker got lucky, and you now own 3.2% of a commercial enterprise called 
\'The Third Imperium\'. This years dividends come to 2.2 teracredits.
Do you want that in cash or should we re-invest it ?".

I\'d better stop now ...

Sure, I\'d agree with that.  It means moderate or average, so by
definition most of the populace is mediocre (or worse, but at best
aboutr half assuming that as many people are bright as smart, for

Good point.  Besides, how would you ever get to skill-3 then?  A
skill-3 (or above) person shows you, and you try even though you\'re
skill-1.  After a few of these with the skill-3+ as a safety net you
get to skill-2, then 3.  So base the routine roll for skill-3, and
make it harder for each skill less.

You might consider that even if the skill-1 person has some small
chance of success (say 4%) that under "normal" conditions failure
means that they needed help (closer to making the roll, the less
help they needed).  After some number of tries they\'d get a
skill-increase (this is with a trainer around, obviously----though it
might be a computer...).

The "Great Gate of Kiev" bit, I guess? <G>  And also presumably Ravel\'s
pompous orchestration, rather than the plinketty-plink (but much easier on
the ear) piano original <G>.

Me, my preference would be for something simultaneously bombastic and
fretful... i.e. old Ludwig van, as nashy droog Alex would say <G>  Not sure
what piece, though.

The Zhodani Consular anthem should be by Phillip Glass...

IIRC in Iolanthe Strephon was only half fairy, from the waist up.  This
still caused him some problems however and his mother _Iolanthe_ pleaded
for help for her son.

I shudder to think what a freudian analysis of these name choices might
imply.... :)

We don\'t know how to make Greek Fire. There are some guesses, but the
Byzantine Empire kept the secret for centuries and it was lost when the
empire fell. There are some medieval techniques that can\'t be
duplicated. They were family secrets and when the family died out, the
technique was lost.

Scientific knowledge is hard to lose. But the means of implementing it
(technology) is actually not that well distributed. Every industry has
trade secrets that will take years to rediscover if the company was
destroyed. 

Sure, textbooks tell you how integrated circuits are made. But only in
*general*. It\'s the *details* that matter, and they aren\'t in the
textbooks. Recovering all the details after a major war or similar
catastrophe will take almost as long as discovering them in the first
place. Maybe longer, as the info in the textbooks may have been
"simplified" enough to be misleading.

The textbook says that you take a cylinder of properly doped silicon,
slice it into thin wafers, and etch circuits into the surface. Well,
from working in the industry, I can tell you that getting the cylinder
isn\'t as simple as it sounds. There are a lot of tricks to producing
the silicon and dopant that get melted. And it takes weeks for an
experienced operator to teach a new one how to produce the cylinder. It
takes several days worth of processing to go from cylinder to wafer
ready for circuit layout. All of that processing has techniques that
aren\'t in the books, but passed on inside the company. My experience
stops short of the circuit etching, but I bet there are a lot of
empirical tricks there too.

Science is *not* technology. And technology involves a lot of "rule of
thumb" stuff.

It sounds like a ferrite or magnetite. That makes it a magnetic
substance but *not* a conductor.

See above. It\'s almost certainly a non-conductor. Also, electrical
organs exist in several life-forms and are uniformly *huge*. Producing
the required charges takes a *lot* of biological energy. An electric
eel\'s body is 90% electrical organ!

They wouldn\'t be using EM. They\'d be using electric or magnetic
*fields*, not electromagnetic waves. So wavelength isn\'t a
consideration. The electrical senses of the critters on earth are not
like any sense humans have. They\'d sort of "feel" an object at a
distance by its effect on the electric field they generate. Pulse rates
are a few per second up to maybe 100. That\'s *pulses*, not a frequency.

Best analogy with a human sense would be the way you can feel a hot
object from a distance with the thermal sensors on your skin.

Magnetic senses on earth seem restricted to navigation. 

Note that the electrical senses require a conductive medium (water) to
work. They are found mostly in creatures that live in muddy water.

Actually, not so straightforward. If I recall from last semester\'s
Ancient Civilizations class, they still aren\'t sure how Egypt\'s
pyuramids were built.  Also, in a video we watched, they tried, using
TL2 technology to build a smaller version of the Great Pyramid, wwith
everything sized down accordingly.  They took the period of building the
great pyramid (which I believe took 22 years) and tried to build this
small, 3-5 metre tall replica in 4 months.  Well, they got (using TL2
tech, except to bring the rocks in) one corner finished in the alloted
time.

Factor in the ancient Egyptians having to bring the rocks, discover
methods of building, shape the stones, as well as line them up according
to all the different things (such as the Great Pyramid being on the
centre of balance of the contients or whatnot...I could get out my essay
on how they were built if need be), and I\'d say we are not sure today
how they built them.

Like you said, building a pyramid is easy, with our current technology. 
Try doing it in the middle of a scorching desert, with TL2 technology,
and the task becomes a bit harder.  Saying we know how the pyramids were
built is not entirely correct I\'m afraid.

Just to make this Traveller-related, what do you think the current (ie.
M0) condition of the pyramids are?  Have the Solomani kept them nicely
preserved.  Today they face destruction from construction projects,
Cairo\'s expansion, acid rain, pollution, etc.  I wonder how they fare
thousands of years into the future...I wonder if they\'re any closer to
knowing how they were built...

The Library suffered multiple fires, IIRC.  One was when Julius Caesar
took the city (c. 45 BC?).  31 B.C. would have been the fall to Augustus
after Actium.

The fire that destroyed all the books, though, was centuries later.  I
believe it was one of the Caliphs who decreed that, if the books were
not of Allah, they should be destroyed.  If, instead, they were, it didn\'t
matter since the Quran contained all important knowledge anyway.  So they
torched the whole collection.  I guess Islam didn\'t always act to foster
knowledge through the Dark Ages....

Make me acknowledged god-king over a labor force of untold thousands of

and I could make a good stab at it.  Thank goodness Houston doesn\'t have

Sounds like a semantic argument to me.  We haven\'t, \'tis true, recovered
Imhotep\'s SEVEN STEPS TO A SUCCESSFUL PYRAMID -- but McCauley and others
(including experimenters in the Egyptian desert using work gangs!) have
found perfectly practical means for doing what the Egyptians did, which
fit within our knowledge of their culture and technology.

In any case, ancient Egypt was a largely illiterate society, with poor
access to long-term media (stone carvings take longer than, say, laser
etching), and thus a poor choice of analogy for technical losses during
the Long Night.

Nope.  It takes a wide-awake ancient astronomer who can sit up all night
in the middle of a clay-walled palisade and make marks on the floor with a
stick.  Again, see McCauley.

Charles, I agree with your first point, but as to your second...I\'m not
sure. Maybe the operative phrase is "should even try", though, because I\'d
argue that he "could try"..with little chance of success.

Suppose, our second year med student is a passenger on a Free Trader
travelling to some place for some reason, and another passenger collapses
with a massive heart attack shortly after the ship enters jump space. 
There is no doctor aboard, nor any crewman with even a Medical-1. What
should our medical student do?  Let the passenger die?  Or shouldn\'t he try
to save the passenger\'s life?  I suppose something like open heart surgery
wouldn\'t be called for in this case, but *something* over our med student\'s
head would be, and if we fish around I\'m sure we could come up with some
procedure just as hard as open heart surgery that *would* be required in
some sort of medical emergency.  

As a GM, I would allow the med student to try the procedure, but he would
have an extremely poor chance of success.

   Hmmm...I guess that makes me a Canonist Heretic?  Actually there is a
religious parallel.  Several times in recorded history, would-be
reformers have seized control of the reigns of power within a faith,
only to have "true believers" split with the faith and go it alone ("I
didn\'t leave the Church, it left me").

   You might want to check out my write-up on Gabreelism which appeared
in Traveller Chronicle (and will be coming to a Web site near you within
the next week or so).  Some mysticism involved (the Priestess of the
Faith is a psion who can see the past, present and future), but for the
most part it is based upon the beliefs of many religions and is
organized in a coherant manner.  The "Sayings From the Book of
Gabree-el" are particularly enlightening.

Building the pyramids today would be far from "easy".  There are over
2 million stone blocks in the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the ancient
Egyptian workers/slaves would have had to position the 2,300 kg blocks
at a _minimum_ rate of one block every five minutes (24 hours a day,
365 days a year) to complete the structure in the 20+ years it
reportedly took to build.

Does it really matter?  I mean, if you don\'t own a Traveller adventure
that "officially" places pyramids somewhere in the Spinward Marches,
whose to say that you can\'t simply go ahead and scatter a few about
anyways.

That being said, the CT Adventure 1 booklet features an adventure
called "Shadows" that revolves around a pyramid site.  It takes place
on Yorbund (0703) in the Regina subsector and the pyramids aren\'t as
grandiose as those in Egypt (the largest being about 70 metres
square).

That should do you for a start :)

I would still include lasers under this rule since they are "pulse"

I thought it already was (p. 57).  Since PCMPs, etc. weren\'t included
in the basic T4 rulebook, no mention of a rule pertaining to them was
needed.  But since EA (with its arsenal of weaponry) is already on the
store shelves, it only makes sense to include any of the combat rules
from that volume in the new T4.1 combat section.

I thought PCMPs inflicted three kinds of damage... one for the impact
of the packet of plasma itself (max\'d out a 3D), one for the high heat
effects of the resulting explosion, and one for the heat of the beam
itself?  An unarmoured opponent would take 3D (max\'d) + 4D (from the
explosive) worth of damage from a TL 12 PCMP... with an additional +2D
using the optional back blast damage effects along the length of the
weapon\'s beam (since the target is essentially adjacent to the beam).

More interesting stuff on how to approach the minefield. See below on

Anyway, I think this is quite interesting per se. So Belters, pirates
and people which often work in deep space environment should use
modified air raft... i.e. a "space" raft for maneuvering. I\'ll try my
hand at one of these with my copy of CSC, perhaps.

At the moment the idea is that Zhodani Navy mined the asteroids in
order to slow down/hamper the Imperial Navy advance. Some years after
the end of the war, a group of Belters and/or Pirates (perhaps lead
by renegade Zhodani officers) discovered a data module which contains
a map of the minefield. They will use this knowledge to build a kind
of Fortified Pirate Haven in Space (not unlike the Imhyrr (sp?) city
in the Elric novels).
They will be able to use it as a base for raiding the nearby systems,
and be far enough from Imperial borders to avoid a massive siege.
The PCs could get a copy of the same data module and start wondering
about its contents (translating it from Zhodani to Imperial standards
corrupted some of the data, so they will have some difficulties in
puzzling out the contents).

And at last, Michael Koehne added:

So, the third take on the Space Mines concept. Very well. Plus
snipped ideas on a James Bond like assault on asteroids/moons.

Now, the new questions for the gentlemen on the list:

I\'d like to know more about asteroids size, placement and assorted info.
How big can an asteroid be? How small? How distant may an asteroid be
from its closer neighbors? How many asteroids in a belt? 
I keep thinking of the PCs ship slowly maneuvering among smaller
(mined) asteroids and approaching a larger rock, dotted with pirate
installations and placed deeply inside the asteroids belt, but
perhaps this is just my fantasy.

If you can give me some rough data on this, or perhaps giving me some
pertinent url...

    'body' => '  Well, others have said it already, Glenn, but I\'ll repeat it - your
touching faith in the permanence of technology is probably unfounded.
Since several examples have already been cited, I will not add specifics,
other than to point out that there is an entire academic discipline called
"Industrial Archeology" that is devoted to figuring out just how the heck
folks did things in the past.  Again, as others point out, there is an
awful lot of crucial technical information that never gets written down,
and is essential for actually duplicating a technology.

  Oh, what the heck, here\'s an example, not about forgotten technology,
but one about the difficulty of duplicating a known technology.  During
WWI, German exports of synthetic dyes to the USA were cut off.  American
companies tried to duplicate many of them, but could not, despite the fact
that they had the patents the Germans had filed, samples of the dyes, and
access to all the technical papers published in the field.  Leaving aside
the fact that some of the German patents were deliberatly deceptive, it
goes to show that technology transfer is harder than you might expect.

  One thing that most historians of technology and development specialists
agree on is the crucial role of experts in the transfer of technology.
That is, you can send as many drawings, technical papers, and machines as
you like, but the crucial element of technology transfer is person to
person contact with people who know how the technology works.  For
example, during WWII a new method for flush riveting aircraft was
developed at Boeing.  Despite the fact that technical papers and the
riveting machines were sent to another plant, it was not until the
inventor of the process went to the other plant that they were able to
make the process work.

  This is one of the reasons we have seen such an explosion of
technological development in Asia.  For years students from that part of
the world have studied in American and European universities and technical
schools, and now they have taken that know-how back with them and are
putting it to use developing new technologies and new methods based on
existing ideas.

  Now, I take no position as to the tech level of the Rule of Man (though
I\'m leaning towards the TL12, some prototype TL13 position based on my own
reading), but I find it perfectly reasonable that past cultures could have
had a higher tech level, and nobody can duplicate it later.  On the other
hand, I find it less likely that information about the existance of those
past technologies in the form of something like news stories in Popular
Science magazine would disapear.

  As a side note on the Darians, it is interesting to note how they have
evolved over time.  As I recall from their initial apperance in the
Spinward Marches supplement in CT days, their planet just had remnants of
TL16 stuff, and the actual TL of the rest of their culture was rather
lower.  Essentially, it was a tourist destination, where the GM could wow
the players with descriptions of cool stuff.  Their evolution to M1100
masters of high tech took place later, and as I recall was really cemented
by the Regency Sourcebook (though my memory may be off there, and I don\'t
have my books here to check).

  Oh, and as to the Library at Alexandria, its destruction was a loss to
world history, but to blame that one event for 500 years of stagnation is
a considerable exageration.  Much of the technological progress that was
made afterwards depended very little on books and academic science anyway
- - it\'s not really until the nineteenth century that one can really speak
of academic and scientific knowledge having much impact on technology.

impossible for a long term stable belt, if I remember what more
knowledgeable list members were saying - collisions between the rocks

  In my own PBEM Beltwatch, I got around this by making the creation of
the belt a very recent event, so that densities are still high and
navigation very dangerous.

of the oceans, but a few areas with particular historical value have
been preserved by seawalls.  One of these locations is around Giza, home

centuries, were easily discovered...The tour begins by leading the group
down into the room that served as the queens burial chamber....The
Burial chamber has been rebuilt to appear as it once looked... The
Egyptians who built the pyramids also built ... a tunnel from the
largest pyramid to the Sphinx.  ...it is unsafe because of milenia of
decay and erosion.

The Terran Psionics institute circa 356-1106 is located inside of the
Sphinx.  Its leader is really a Zhodani agent.  At the end of the
adventure incompetant Dolphin construction workers/terrorists working
underwater on the other side of the nearby seawall bomb a whole in it
and the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid are flooded.

I assume that this dammage is fixed by the Imperium and the tourism
eager Terrans in the next few years but that a similar event occurs
again 11 years later during the Solomani conquest of Earth.

Therefore we know that the Great Pyramid is in good shape in Milieu 1100
but it is a referee call as to what kind of shape it is in in Milieu 0. 
You could argue that it would be in poorer due to The Long Night or you
could assume that local tourism alone would generate enough money to
make restoring the Great Pyramid financially viable.

Can we compromise on 2.5D? :-)

If you make the roll too low (and at 2D, an average person will, on average, 
succeed), it makes the original requirements pointless. I have nothing against 
Joe Average going to school, I\'m just saying that if Phil Subnormal wants to 
get in, he\'ll only stand a chance if he has powerful friends/family.

A good example of loss of technology is Russia after the 1917-24 civil
war. Before the 1st WW the Imperial Russian Army had the most
advanced artillery fuses in the world (a true technological marvel of
the period), the Imperial Navy designed and built some of the finest
dreadnaughts and cruisers of the era, their aircraft technology rivaled
that of France (the most advanced in the world at the time). When in
the 30\'s the Soviets started to rearm they had to import virtually all the
technical know how from overseas, they had in just 15 years lost the
technological infrastructure to support a sophisticated arms industry;
they could not even match the achievements of the former Imperial
period. This was not the loss of specific items or industries, this was
the loss of entire fields of engineering capability. Sure they had some
of the worlds best scientists and access to all the scientific knowledge
of the Imperial period and much of that developed after, but they just
couldn\'t apply that knowledge.

Another way of illustrating this is: India has some of the finest scientists
and technicians in the world, quite a lot of them actually. They have
full access to an advanced scientific knowledge base, probably equal
with that of the US. Yet India still prefers to use steam locomotives
designed in the 50\'s, they produce for domestic consumption British
cars designed in the 60\'s; why? Their population lacks the knowledge
to use and maintain more advanced technology.

News Item, Imperial Defense Weekly 04-193

Dateline: Sylea, Famille Spofulam Orbital HQ

Title: Famille Spofulam Armaments releases new riot termination weapon


	"Yesterday, FSA launched their new OKA-SQ riot termination system,
a vehicle-mounted rotary 5-barrel 18X62E ETC VRF shotgun.  Leem Ladjen, our
police and paramilitary equipment editor, attended the launch, on board the
=46amille Spofulam Group\'s Orbital HQ:

	\'As usual, the reception for members of the press was nothing short
of lavish; greeted at the VIP disembarkment ports by liveried FS liason
staff, the media were quickly ushered into a large and tastefully decorated
reception hall.  The wet bar and buffet were up to Famille Spofulam\'s usual
megalomaniacal standards, and journalists, representatives of various
governments, and [censored] were given time to mingle and chat it up with
several FSA representatives.  Although most participants were extremely
discreet, a large delegation from Mu were noted, including Baron Erghaan\'s
notorious Chief of Secret Police, Looeehze Bodewoyn, who was most
remarkable in her peaked cap, riding crop, and fitted leather uniform.

	Eventually, after the remains of the buffet had been cleared away,
we were ushered into a nearby theatre/shooting range.  Once all had been
seated, Hengabar Spofulam, Famille Spofulam\'s hereditary patriarch, walked
to the podium and began his presentation:

	"Are your peasants or indentured labourers revolting?  Yes, of
course they are, but if they\'re in a state of insurrection against your
justifiably draconian regime, then they\'re even more revolting!
<chuckles>.  Bad jokes that have been stale since autocracy was invented
aside, however, it is clear that on many worlds, the combination of high
populations, when combined with the ungrateful resentment of justly severe
law levels or rabble-rousing by outside agitators, can lead to
reprehensible rioting and other forms of criminal mob violence.

	Up until now, there has been a relative absence of relatively
inexpensive weapons systems capable of putting a complete stop to riots in
short periods of time.  This lacuna in the law enforcement arsenal of the
Imperium has finally been addressed by Famille Spofulam Armaments.  Ladies
and gentlemen, I give you the OKA-SQ-18X62E(5) Riot Termination System!"

	The curtain behind Mr. Spofulam drew open, revealing a rather large
ammunition hopper feeding a rather hefty-looking multibarreled VRF weapon,
mounted for demonstration purposes on a cutaway turret mount.  50 meters
down-range were arrayed several dozen Imperial Standard Ballistics Testing
Dummies, colloquially known as Juice Bags to industry members, in life-like
poses brandishing placards and spray cans or poised to throw rocks or
primitive incendiary devices.  I quickly scanned the front row with my
opera glasses; there in the front row was one ISBTD bearing a marked
resemblance to Sir Arameth Gridlore of Gridlore Technologies, and wearing a
jacket with the Gridlore Technologies logo.  I turned to my counterpart
from Really Big Guns! magazine, smiled, and collected my 50 credit wager.
To his credit, Higubaa paid up cheerfully.

	Mr. Spofulam strode across the stage to the display, as a press
release kit and weapons data were being uploaded to the audience\'s
handcomps.  Seating himself at a control panel set up by the weapon, he
donned hearing protectors, and activated the weapon.  The gun\'s five
barrels quickly spun up to maximum RPM.  Then he depressed the firing stud
and traversed the weapon back and forth across the simulated riot for an
extremely noisy 10 seconds; 33.3 shotgun rounds per second makes a
tremendous din.  Then he ceased fire.

	The devastation wreaked upon the ISBTD\'s was horrific; not one was
left standing, and those in the front row had been pretty much shredded;
ISBTD Circulatory Fluid Analogue had been spread everywhere and was
dripping down from the range ceiling.  By my calculations, the ISBTD\'s had
been hit by something in the neighbourhood of 330 shotgun shells; assuming
24 pellets per shell, the OKA-SQ had fired approximately 8000 pellets.  The
delegation from Mu, led by CSP Bodewoyn, leapt to their feet in a standing
ovation"


Name: 		FSA OKA-SQ-18X62E(5) RTS (Riot Termination System).
Damage: 	4 (12).
TL: 		12.
Range:		Medium.
Shots:		4000 (ROF 2000 RPM).
Mass:		76 Kg empty, 246.5 loaded.
Reloads:	243 Kg (4000-round cassette)
Cost:		27860 Cr (includes 1 full cassette; bare gun is 3450).
Reload cost:	20960 Cr.

Notes: benefits from VRF +4 to-hit DM and my house rules give shotguns +2
DM at the cost of increased damage attenuation.  Thus, under my house rules
we\'re looking at a +6 DM to hit.  My house rules triple the base 1-round
damage rating for VRF weapons, so the 4 damage reflects the damage from a
single round, which as per my previous post I\'ve assumed to be identical to
the 4-damage-dice 18mm shotgun round in the T4 manual.  So, under my house
rules it would do 12 dice against an unarmoured target (splat!), or 3 dice
against a target with armour rated at 3; hence the damage rating of 12.

They\'re actually mentioned in Travellers Digest 13.

Apparently the Nile River valley is flooded by rising sea levels but some of
the historical sites have been protected by sea walls.  The pyramids are a
major tourist site, and extra sectret passages have been discovered using
densitometers (including a hollow Sphinx).

The sea wall actually gets bombed by dolphins in this adventure and the areas
gets flooded.

Super idea!

SOMEbody\'s gonna suggest this, so I\'ll go ahead:  The Imperial March (aka
the Darth Vader theme), from Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back, by John
Williams.  It\'s got power, presence, and, well, a certain finality to it,
and after all, it IS an Imperial March... ;^)

I really don\'t think anyone is seriously proposing that the 3I (or hell,
even the
ROM for that matter) used a piece of music from a period on a far away planet
3000 years in the past... I got the impression that suggestions being
placed out
here were for appropriate "background music" that could be used by us in
running our games. I would love to get a copy of the actual Imperial Theme,
but a) most of the products of the Sylean Philharmonic are incompatible with 
my current stereo system, and b) my local Blockbuster has a very weak
collection
of music from the Imperium, actually only a couple of pressings of "A Little 
Newt Music" and a large collection of "Marches of the Imperial Marine 
Pipers" in the remainders bin.

See my point above. Yes, using some of the more *cough* _abstract_ pieces
by Cage or Eno or the Butthole Surfers might add a type of authenticity as 
to what "classical" music might be like, but given a choice between 
realism and playability <rimshot> I\'ll stick with the stuff I can listen to.

This has come up several times on the list, and the standard answer (which
I more or less agree with) is that we have to keep it basically a late 20th-
Century Western culture to allow a reasonable amount of functional 
knowledge to be assumed in our players. Yes it is unrealistic, but to make
a realistic 50th century culture would not only be proven to be just as
incorrect over time as assuming that it will look just like 1990\'s USA, but
also it would require so much time to learn the background and basic 
ways that the world worked since they would be utterly alien to us, that
their would be no time left to play. I agree that many bits of exoticism can
be inserted, but I think that we have to have a basic background much like
our own in order to run the game with as little "jarring" between being your
character and having to think "Ok, now how does this work in the future?"
Plus, having a "modern" (ie. 20th C) culture gives the exotic bits you put
in seem that much more "wonder-full"

I don\'t for a moment suggest that the storage media of Sylea in the Year 0
HAS to be the same as that of Sylea in Year -1800 (though given the history
of the Vilani I could make out a perfectly good case for just that). But I
do think that if the 3rd Imperium had had some exoteric knowledge hidden away 
on an obsolete storage device they could easily have found some way to recover
it. A simple matter of cryptography. Do you really wish to maintain that they
would have any particular difficulty doing that. IMO we\'re talking a few
months of research. Not 450 years.

Well, it dosen\'t seem that the knowledge was lost after all since you have it.
What you\'re talking about is willful ignoring of facts rather than loss of
them.

Books that have survived to this day; knowledge that will survive for
centuries more now that a new book has been written about it. And the day
the book is transferred to a CD it will survive for millenia.

Leaving aside the point that dedicated storage plans is one of the things
that universities and libraries are all about, let me point out that as
technology progresses data storage becomes cheaper. The same politicians
who can\'t find the millions to restore deteriorating books could easily
find the thousands it takes to press a few CDs. Secondly, by TL 8 non-
volatile electronic storage devices become cheap and plentiful. I\'d be a
lot more inclined to believe in the process you mention if we were talking
about a culture that has been down below TL 7 before it started back up.
But Sylea never fell below TL 10.

No reflection of your web-page, but it\'s not really comparable to a technical
manual. It\'s more comparable to a diary. Nevertheless, you can ensure its
survival for millennia simply be having a CD with it burned. Even copying it
over to a 3.5 diskette will propably work, though the risks of deterioration
are higher.

How many textbooks published in the US, even about now-defunct technologies,

But how much of that stuff is more than a few decades old? That\'s one of
the basic points in talking about _mature_ technologies. As I was careful
to point out, experimental TL 13 stuff is OK by me. But if it\'s experimental,
it\'s not a basic part of the fabric of RoM. You\'ve heard about industrial
espionage, right? A company might manage to hold onto its secrets if it was
confined to a single world, but I find it hard, devilishly hard, to believe
in a product available across the width and breadth of RoM, yet still so
secret that it could disappear completely.

No it isn\'t. Well, of course, I have to admit that according to the
"Newest Testament" (or "Testament 4" as it were) it is. But that\'s IMO
a grievious mistake and for exactly the same reason why RoM cannot have
been TL 13. The same applies to the TL 14 world you mention. Such worlds
are not compatible with the fact that the 3rd Imperium didn\'t reach TL 13
till 300. And if Marc insists on keeping these paradoxical worlds (as is
his right), I will begin agitating for revising the date when the Imperium
reached TL 13 to, say, 50 or at most 100.

Now, I think that would be a great pity, because one of the points of doing
different milieux is surely to make them different, if you take my meaning.
But that\'s by the way.

What this assessment really comes down to is "Do we have the tech knowledge?"

In Milieu 0, yes. But I\'m referring to the (canonical ;-) fact that the 3rd
Imperium didn\'t reach TL 13 till 300. I have no quarrel with Sylea being
only TL 12 in Year 0, regardless of how high a TL RoM or any neighboring
worlds may have had or have. And I don\'t regard it as impossible that it 
could take Sylea a few decades to upgrade to any new technology they may
dig up in their archives or "acquire" from some far-off planet. What I do 
not consider plausible (to put it mildly) is that it would take the 3rd 
Imperium 300 years (I\'ll repeat that: _300 YEARS!_) to implement this 
knowledge. 

(That it could take them 300 years to _discover_ it, well, that may not be 
overwhelmingly plausible either, but as I\'ve pointed out previously, there
appear to be some horrendously difficult research obstacles to surmount
above TL 9 or 10.
 
>I\'m not so sure that it is in Cleon\'s best interests to be raising the tech

In PE terms it most certainly is. In any terms I can think of, actually. But
I suppose that is the weakest part of my argument. I just can\'t find it in
my heart to believe that anyone could have an entire spectrum of TL 13
knowledge (not just a few things that may be too expensive, like terra-
forming, or contrary to public opinion, like gengineering, but the whole
enchilada) and not WANT to implement it. As I said before, you can always
come up with one or two technologies with specific reasons why Cleon might
not want or need them, but across the board? Not in my credo, I\'m afraid.


I guess that part is an article of faith.

Yeah, but that wasn\'t families that delivered their products to a few

I believe you. But would it take 450 years? And how many trade secrets of,
say, 50 years ago are still secret? If a "trade secret" was widespread
enough to affect the general TL of the RoM, do you really think it would
remain a secret for all that long?

I never said it was impossible. Just very hard. And harder the more it has

Contradiction in terms. If the media is still good, then the information isn\'t
truly lost. It may cost more than anyone is willing to pay today to access it,
but it isn\'t lost. And do you really think that someone like Zhunastu
Enterprises would hesitate to spend a few megacredits on recovering a lost
technology?

But the really high-tech cutting edge stuff dosen\'t remain really high-tech
cutting edge stuff. And IMO any technology that is mature enough to affect
the general TL of the RoM is also spread out across the RoM and written
down in scores and hundreds of places.

No. But they would have all the papers published by every major university up
to, at least, -1800. They would propably have every paper published within a
few dozen parsecs (Like Hub, for instance).

No, space _trade_ dries up. That is, sector-wide space trade dries up.

What budget? A few 100 credits to have the information encoded on a small
metal disc?

They will propably have lost a lot of private web-pages, but they won\'t have
lost any serious textbooks. They may have to spend a bit of effort to learn
to read the now-obsolete storage media, but it won\'t cost them much or take 
them very long.

First of all, the Darrians lost theirs in a catastrophe. (And there are some
problems with that, actually). Sylea wasn\'t in a catastrophe. Secondly, Sylea 
lost a couple of TLs in capacity. That\'s a bit hard to swallow too, but 
that\'s the way the Traveller Universe works. If your economy deteriorates, 
your technology falls. What I dispute is the notion that 1) The Sylean lost 
the knowledge AND 2) everybody else lost it too.

I find it highly unlikely that the Ramshackle Empire had a very stable,
interstellar high-tech infrastructure. However, my point is precisely that
Sylea would have the resources to build up any infrastructure it cared to
once it became the center of a vast interstellar empire. So if they didn\'t
build up their TL to 13 until 300, then it was because they didn\'t have
the knowledge, not because they didn\'t have the resources.

>It\'s the RoM. Imagine a fairly populated vacuum world. 

Yes, any knowledge held only by a single world could plausibly be lost. But
in order to build TL 14 vac suits, that planet would have to draw on a vast
body of TL 13 knowledge. And where did they get that? Did they develop that
too and kept it a secret?

>Anyways, I think you\'re being too optimistic Hans. The Long Night was
>long, cold, nasty and brutish, to paraphrase someone who\'d name I\'ve

It\'s not that I\'m optimistic. It\'s that I have a small knowledge of how
propability works. Try a small experiment. Define some chance that the
whole body of common knowledge held by a planet would disappear completely
during the Long Night. Not just be forgotten, but all traces of it actually
lost beyond recovery. Say, a 2 on 2D6. Now roll the dice for every world of 
the RoM (5000?) Or perhaps just the top 10%. If you can roll 500 2s with a
set of true dice, then maybe the knowledge of the RoM could be completely
lost. Heck, say that it would take a 12 to avoid losing the knowledge and
see if that will do it.

The problem isn\'t only coming up with a reason why any particular planet like
Sylea lost the knowledge, it\'s coming up with one that wipes it out on _every_
world where it was once available.

The rationalization I have always used is that technological increases
require exponentially greater investment at higher tech levels.
Lower-technology breakthroughs can be done by individuals or small nations,
but stellar-scale technologies require the combined brainpower and economic
resources of interstellar empires. If there is a hard limit on the speed at
which information can be shared, like 1 week for interstellar travel, then
there will be a point at which further improvement will simply require more
time, no matter what resources are available.

I\'m not saying this is really true, but it is certainly plausible for game
purposes. The breakthroughs in optics and mechanics, for example, were
largely done by single individuals. The breakthroughs in nuclear physics
and computers were achieved by a generation of the greatest living
scientists and engineers supported through massive expenditures by the
wealthiest nations on Earth. Why not assume that jump drive and thruster
technology require centuries of effort by entire planets? I can suspend
disbelief for that and it fits Traveller canon. It makes an interesting
game, too, with vast amounts of raw data, scientific equipment, and
engineering prototypes requiring shipment across interstellar distances.
Governments and megacorporations may resort to clandestine research
stations or entire planets working on a single project, while pirates and
hostile governments will be searching for ways to enrich themselves by
stealing the hard work of others.

Average the PC\'s STR and END.  Round up.  This is his Damage Limit.  A PC
can take up to his DL from guns and pulse (hand-held) lasers, and up to
3xDL from plasma waepons. DL does not lower with wounds.. it is a measure
of a character\'s bulk and toughness. Any to-hit roll made by 5 or more will
ignore DL and do full damage -OR- the wea[on does 2xdamage, DL applies.

For example, Joe the Marine has STR 9, DEX 5, and END 12.  His DL is 11.
Fred the Wimp has STR 4, DEX 7, and END 6.  Fred\'s DL is 5.

Fred and Joe both take hits from an ACR doing 4d damage, and both roll
14pts of damage.  Fred only takes 5, while Joe takes 11.  Since this is the
first wound either has taken, they roll randomly to see what characteristic
is affected.  Joe takes it all on STR, Fred on DEX.  Lucky Fred!

Fred shots back with his small pistol at Pierre the Pirate, and makes his
to hit roll by six (Fred may be a wimp, but he\'s damn good with a
pistol...)  Pierre normally has a DL of 8, and Fred decides to bypass the
DL.  He rolls a 9 on two dice for damage, putting Pierre down.

I believe this system is a nice compromise, and it it zots those
mega-characters how have "letter" stats in every category; they\'ll be
sucking more damage!

The damage is repaired within a year or two, and the Institute re-opens 
shortly after. Unknown to most people, it\'s now under the control of 
INI, who use it to a) train their own agents, and b) monitor who else 
is getting training. In 1113, a new Director is assigned, a Captain 
Gail Knight. Unkown to INI, she was in fact a *SolSec* deep cover 
agent. She remained in this post for nearly 4 years, until her cover 
was blown (spectacularly!) when she, along with 2 other agents, 
attacked the Luna Naval Base prior to the Solomani Fleet\'s invasion.

You really have 3 distinct areas of knowledge to consider:

1) Public domain - published papers, journals, reports, books etc.

2) Protected technical documents - patents, copyright designs etc.

and

3) In-house knowledge.

Now (1) will require a careful search of a wide body of material to ensure
that you find what you want. Knowledge of the jargon in the industry will
help here. This is the kind of information you can use your university
library for.

(2) is a smaller body of knowledge, and usually confused by the patent
process, which tends to make definitions unclear through use of legalese.
However, this information is usually obtainable.

(3) is, as Leonard suggests, the killer in trying to recreate technology.
The in-house secrets that give a competitive edge. To give another example:
I work for a company that is developing a flywheel system using composite
technology. The principles of flywheels are known (indeed have been known
for years). The principles of composites are known (although IMO they are
still more of an art than a science). You could give one of our flywheels
to another composite manufacturer, but it wouldn\'t do much good, as reverse
engineering is nigh impossible. Yes, you could say what materials we use,
and the layout, *but* the actual process is the key to the technology. And
that is the information kept in-house, and the information most likely to
have been lost in the Long Night.

	I started playing Classic Traveller back in 1980 and I have been
rather excited looking at T4 over the last couple of weeks. In trying to get
back into things (I still have my Classic rules) I\'ve been looking for
computer program support and have been very surprised when I haven\'t found it.
I find it difficult to believe that Traveller\'s fans (especially Traveller\'s
fans) haven\'t come up with more computer programs to help them.

	I\'m specifically looking for Macintosh computer programs that would
assist with generic character creation, starship, and world and star 
system creation.

	I\'d also like to find forms, especially Sector Maps, Subsector Maps, 
and World Maps in GIF or JPG format.  

	I have Rob Prior\'s MegaTraveller Character HyperCard Stack, but I 
was hoping there might be more.  Can anyone give me any pointers?

	Thanks folks!

	I know I don\'t post much, but rest assured I keep up with the list. 
Even when it is grinding a subject into the proverbial "particle
accelerator", so bear with my ignorance on this one and help me out if
you can.

	I am running the new module "the long way home", and it occurred to me
that the standard rules for "Starship Economics" would not be of much
use.  First of all, the crew has Imperial Credits.  Very ugly
considering that they are now three subsectors from the nearest Sylean
Bank.  Second, they have a badly bruised starship, the 300 ton extended
voyage scout ship suffered immensely upon impact with the gateway
platform.  Third, they are on a tech level 2 world with no starport.  In
order for the voyage to continue Life support must be replenished. 
There are six crewmen and the ship is built for 8 so I guess
accomidations could be made to have purchased the additional food and
air needed for the voyage.
	Now the question.  Supposedly it costs 2,000 thousand credits for each
crewmember per 2 weeks.  Either they are eating very good or the air is
expensive, or I am missing something ( this is probably the answer).  
	Using my common sense, I think they could muster up some local grub and
pump in air, but what will they do when they get to a system without
breathable oxygen?  Purify what they take out of a gas giant ( if
available)?  And the million dollar game balance question, if that is so
then I see players saving a potential 12k credits per jump.  Even when
they return to the imperium.  Unless of course the answer is to make it
prohibitive in time (how much time?)

There\'s a few good sites out there, but I\'m not quite sure about their
exact contents.  One you definitely should check out is the Missouri
Archive (http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/archive/).  It\'s got a
tonne of Traveller stuff ranging from PDF (Acrobat) deckplans,
worldmaps, etc. to spreadsheets, programs, fiction and more.

Some of the better files (I thought) that I pulled out of the archive
recently were some wonderful deckplans in Acrobat PDF by Glenn Hoppe of
a Far Trader, and some of the smaller space-only Traveller ships
(launch, etc.).  YOu can of course get PDF versions of QSDS 1.5
(corrected and better laid otu than the T4 rulebook version) as well as
character sheets, referee\'s screens, and some of the best alternative
rules out there (personal favourite...RPSC!).

Also, as to star system generation, mapping, etc. you\'ll want to get the
absolute king of all Traveller programs....Galactic 2.2  (just released)
by Jim Vassilakos.   You can fnd the latest version, and bug-fixes at
http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/progs.html  This program ahs tonnes of
official and created Traveller sector data, an excellent way of
inputting your own universes, etc. and is just brilliant, get a hold of
it.

Lastly, another suggestion:  Surf the webring.  Seriously.  I travel
along the Traveller webring every so often an never come back
disappointed, always finding something that catches my interest enough
to be saved, and printed out for inclusion in my big binder of Traveller
stuff :)

Hope I\'ve been of help somewhat...great to have you aboard.

tell me at what point a machine gun or assault rifle becomes an RF or
VRF weapon. Presumably this is in one of the TNE rulebooks, which I
never bothered to buy and are now long out of print.

Accordingly, my questions are severalfold:

1) Since ordinary automatic fire in T4 burns up 5 rounds for each target
attacked, what rate of ammunition consumption constitutes an RF or VRF
weapon?

2) What advantages are conferred by RF or VRF fire, as expressed in T4
stats? Does it do any extra damage? or merely make it easier to hit?
(I\'ve heard to-hit bonuses of +2 and +4 bandied about, respectively).

3) Is there any increase in the weight or expense of an RF/VRF weapon?
And is it possible to create a weapon with variable rates of fire? (You
know -- single-shot, five-round burst, full-auto, Dump The Clip).

4) I presume in the original TNE rules that excessive recoil gave you
minuses to hit. So how many foot-pounds of recoil gives you what minus?
(OK, so it isn\'t part of the T4 rules... but I shoot and hunt on a
regular basis, and am keenly aware of the effect on your aim of a .338

seen it applied to Traveller before...

I\'ve just been reading A. E. van Vogt\'s _The_Weapons_Shops_of_
_Isher_, and while psionics in the traditional sense plays no
significant part in the story (a very good one, by the way),
there _is_ an element that could be viewed as "psionic".  Below
I have included the rules for using this element in Traveller.
AEvV called it "callidetic", btw; so shall I.



- - Psionic Talent: Callidetic

Slightly less than one in two hundred people with significant
psionic potential will not show up as having this potential
when tested, and if psionic training is attempted by these
people anyway, the training will not be productive of results.
These people are nevertheless psionically active, and may in
fact be influential.

Callidetic psions are people for whom certain things always seem
to "work out" in their favor.  There is no overt evidence of
psionic activity, and a "traditional" psion will not be able to
detect any psionic involvement in these individuals\'
"unbelievable luck".  Nevertheless, it\'s there, and it _does_
have an impact on the callidetic\'s life.

Note that callidetic potential _seems_ to exist even among
sentient races in which psionic potential has not been detected,
although it is significantly rarer among these races than among
psionically active races.  The level of acceptance of psionics
in a society does not appear to correlate with the likelihood of
callidetic potential; all apparent correlations have been due to
better reporting among societies with a higher level of
acceptance and integration.

- - Determining Callidetic Potential

The referee should roll the PC\'s psionic potential normally
(including variations for non-human sophonts - but see below
for non-psionic sophont races). If the result is 9+, it is
possible for the PC to be callidetic. Roll 3D for 18 exactly, no
DMs.  If 18 is rolled, the PC is callidetic, and any testing
will reveal a psionic strength rating of 0 or negligible.

For sophonts with no normal psionic capabilities (for example,
Hivers), roll 18 exactly on 3D, then, if this roll succeeds,
roll for a psionic strength rating as per the normal rules for
humans; if this roll is 11+, roll 3D for 18 exactly. If this
last roll succeeds, the PC is callidetic, with the indicated
psionic strength rating. Otherwise, the character is not
psionic.

- - Using Callidetic Potential

Callidetic potential influences events to favor the character\'s
aims and goals - but only in a narrow field.  If the character\'s
callidetic potential exhibits itself in gambling, it will affect
_only_ gambling.  (This prevents it from becoming unbalancing
in the game.)  The referee should secretly determine where the
callidetic potential exhibits itself.  Some suggestions are:
gambling, combat survival, personal interaction/charisma,
ambition, mechanical, computer, electronic, or almost any skill.

Callidetic potential provides a favorable DM on all tasks
related to the area in which the potential expresses itself.
This DM is equal to one-third of the character\'s psionic
strength rating (PSR/3).  _Don\'t_ round; instead, apply a
variable DM so that over time it averages out to the required DM
- - a DM of 2.5 should be treated as alternating DMs of 2 and 3.
This rule may optionally be extended (recommended, if the
referee doesn\'t mind a little extra bookkeeping) to integer DMs
as well, so that a DM of 2 may be played as DMs of 1, 2, 2, 0,
3, 2, 1, 3, 4, ... on successive related tasks, averaging out to
2 over time. This represents the variability of "luck" (and may
include the _very_ rare negative DM - but negative DMs should be
compensated for in reasonably short order.  The average is
everything).

Also, callidetic potential can affect activities that don\'t
involve specific tasks performed by the character - for example,
a Noble who is a passenger on even a badly maintained ship, who
has callidetic potential expressing itself as "personal
survival" will affect the _engineer\'s_ roll for a successful
jump - the jump may be successful when otherwise it "shouldn\'t"
have been, or the results of a misjump will place the ship in a
stellar system (though not the intended destination, perhaps),
fairly close to the mainworld (instead of disabled in the outer
system or in deep space).

Callidetic potential is NOT CONTROLLABLE.  The player has no
control over where it expresses itself.  There is no cost to
using it; it is always active.

Callidetic potential CAN change its mode of expression, under
certain circumstances.  Change is possible under the following
circumstances:

        1. The character is the target of a successful psionic
        assault. Callidetic potential will change its expression
        on a 2D roll of 6+.

        2. The character uses psychoactive drugs (other than
        fast, slow, or medical drug). If the use is under the
        direction of a medical professional, callidetic
        potential will change on a 2D roll of 8+; if it is
        recreational use, on a 2D roll of 7+.  Apply a DM of +1
        for each month in which the character has used these
        drugs (either medically or recreationally) for more than
        ten days.

        3. The character uses fast drug, slow drug, or medical
        drug.  Callidetic potential will change its expression
        on a 2D roll of 9+.

        4. The character enters cold sleep or Low Passage berth.
        Callidetic potential will change its expression on a 2D
        roll of 10+, when the character wakes up.

        5. The character is knocked unconscious by pain or
        physical assault.  Callidetic potential will change its
        mode of expression on a 2D roll of 9+ when the character
        awakens.

        6. The character is "put under", as for a medical or
        surgical procedure, using ordinary means (not fast/
        slow/medical drug, not being hit on the head).
        Callidetic potential will change its expression on a 2D
        roll of 12 when the character awakens.

Callidetic potential is _not_ affected by ordinary sleep.

The Newt character Pawa-ba (_Aliens_Archive_, p77) is an example
of a sophont who probably has callidetic potential, which in
his(?) case expresses itself in business.

Note: It is up to the referee to decide how to make life
interesting in the rare event that two callidetics whose
potentials operate at cross purposes should be involved in the
same scenario.  _All_ callidetic potentials that have a direct
bearing/interest in the scenario should be taken into account.

I am watching this conversation with great interest, as I am attempting
to accomplish much the same thing -- create a believable alien (in this
case, really big buglike critters) that can use shortwave radio
communications to talk to their fellows & send out radar pulses to
detect their enemies. Which is why I am pouncing on this comment.

I just spent a fascinating 4th of July at a party with an electrical
engineer -- a friend\'s father-in-law -- and he thought the whole idea
was pretty neat. He explained the whole concept of frequency agility (a
LOT more than just hopping around individual frequencies), helped me to
understand the relation of length of antenna to wavelength of frequency
(thought 4 antennae as thick & long as my arm would make magnificent
broad-band transmitters; especially if you can crook them for good
transmission/reception as easily as you could wiggle your fingers), and
even posited on his own that if the Bugs could synchronize their radar
pulses so that they all went out at the same time in one big wave(a
toughie), a group of them could act as a gigantic phased-array radar!

The only stumbling block we ran into was generating the electricity to
do all this great stuff. For the radar burst, he settled on a working
guesstimate of 15,000 watts, operating anywhere from 300 to 3,000Mhz.
The question we ran afoul of was whether or not a creature of ANY size
could generate that much electricity -- even for an average of 1.65
billionths of a second.

Given your apparent knowledge of eel anatomy... what do YOU think? What
do they use? Some kind of biological battery acid? Is it enough to power
a radio... or a 15,000 watt radar dish, assuming you have an eel the
size of a Buick and can increase the EFFECTIVE power by unfurling a
(admittedly crude) radar dish about 2.5m across every time you get POed
at somebody?

Aha. Now this is just the kind of error-correcting feedback I need. Silly
of me to think a magnetic substance must be a conductor. My sophonts don\'t
need the electrophores anyway, so I\'ll probably just drop that idea - the

Okay, so you\'re saying that the aliens\' biological radio-receptors couldn\'t
evolve from prey-detecting electroreceptors (such as those in the bill of
the platypus). Correct? You also seem to imply that geomagnetic homing
senses couldn\'t evolve into radio senses either. Right? If neither of these
is possible, then do you think radio-senses could evolve naturally, and how
might they work?

Thanks for the feedback, Leonard,

ISBA REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS
New THUDDD Competition Announced

A syndicate of leading corporations offering goods and services to
the exceedingly wealthy, in conjunction with the Imperial Ship
Builders Association (ISBA), announces a new THUDDD ship-design
competition.  The winning entrant in this competition, and perhaps
other entrants as well, will receive lucrative contracts to produce
limited runs of their vessels over the coming decade; these vessels
will serve in *highly* visible roles, and could potentially provide
a good deal of free publicity for the firms involved.

The vessel to be produced is a yacht, 300-500 dt, atmosphere-capable,
minimum performance J2/M1, only minimal weaponry (or none at all). 
This is intended as a toy for the wealthy, or as a vessel of state
for political or corporate leaders.

Contact the ISBA THUDDD office for more information, including full
contest rules and complete RFP document.

Notes and commentary, out of character:

The distinguishing feature of this THUDDD competition is that rather
than the numeric design side, the emphasis will be on the textual
description of the craft, exterior and interior.  Create a vivid
picture in the reader\'s mind of opulence and luxury; describe the
spaces and how they connect to one another such that role players
will feel that they have really been on board.

The limit for this descriptive section is 2000 words.  I had considered
accepting graphical deckplans and other images, but in the end decided
this would leave out those without the tools or skill to create them.
However, you may embed links to such in the text of your entry, and I will
make the links into operational HTML hyperlinks.

Also, in the interests of fostering right-brain-oriented entries to this
THUDDD, I will provide a sample 400 dt ship design with no description,
which others are free to borrow and detail.

Timeline:

  July  6 (Sunday)   Spec released, design phase begins
  July  8 (Tuesday)  Sample yacht design available
  July 19 (Saturday) Entry deadline
  July 21 (Monday)   Ballots released
  July 26 (Saturday) Voting deadline
  July 29 (Tuesday)  Results announced

As always all entries, questions, comments, and large cash donations
should be addressed to me at <cberry@cinenet.net>.

Good luck with THUDDD 5!

Jay,

In Guns,Guns,Guns 3rd in the T4 conversions it talks about Autofire which
cover RF and VRF

Except: page 105

Rnds/sec   Rnds/turn  Damage  RoF DM  Weapon Type

ROF is for "sustained" rate of fire.

1. Does this mean that plain ol\' text files sent via email are okay?

2. If I want to include artwork or diagrams, what data format do you
prefer for these?

3. In the submission guidelines of a recent issue, it says that
unsolicited manuscripts become your property. I object to this
insofar as I may want to make a submissions that I send in
freely available over my homepage or part of some freeware that
I\'m developing. What is your policy with respect to this?

4. I\'d like for you folks to provide some free ad-space for some of
the traveller-related, fan-authored goodies that are available over
the net. My guess is that it would get traveller-players more net-
aware and could boost the readership of the TML. Any chance that
this will ever happen? Are you looking for an article to address
this?

I would think that the state of the Pyramid wouldn\'t be too bad; Terra did
not suffer a collapse in interstellar trade over the Long Night, just a
contraction. The Old Earth Union maintained trade in the local stellar area
(see Solomani and Aslan for more details). I would assume that the tourism
value of the old \'wonders of the world\' would be high, especially if an
anti-Vilani attitude was developing on Terra. {Arguing that the reason the
RoM collapsed was the Vilani inertia to new ideas!} Maybe the Pyramids
would be used as an example or symbol of the lasting achievements that
mankind can achieve if it tries.

Isn\'t this a PC program, not a Mac one?

I\'d recommend revisiting Rob Prior\'s site
(http://www.interlog.com/~dmci104/GamingClub/Traveller/software.html)
and downloading Metator and IGS (Imperial Grand Survey). The former
generates systems (either expands them or from scratch) and the latter is a
star mapping utility.

Also - try visiting David Burden\'s site - (http://www.ftech.net/~innocom)
and downloading Atlas V0.3. To run it you\'ll need to obtain the demo of
MagicMac from (http://www.emulation.net/atarist/index.html) to allow you to
emulate an Atari ST (about 10x faster than the original beast). This
program should load DGP data files without any problems (I have had
problems with the carriage return format differences on the Mac and PC/ST).
It runs fine in 256 colours. Only problem (for me) is that the emulator\'s
menus are in German... Atlas is a mapping/atlas program!

	Hans, this is not a flame, but it\'s growing increasingly obvious that
not only are you unfamiliar with the subject at hand, but that you are also
almost clueless.  I repeat, this is not a flame, let me explain.  I\'ll use an
example, Reagan\'s Strategic Defense Initiative, better known from the
deliberately misinformed and willfully ignorant Press as Star Wars.

	When President Reagan first proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) there were many elements in the Scientific Community that wet their
collective pants at the idea of Self Defense Against Nuclear Weapons!!!  So
they promptly attempted to shoot it down by showing why it wouldn\'t work.
	More armor on the rockets - absorb more incomming energy
	Spin the rockets in flight - dissipate more incomming energy
	Disperse the launch sites - greater range of flight paths to defend
against.
	And there were more, all sounding increasingly impractical even to a
layman, never mind a Reporter. ;)

	Now all of these SOUND good... until you talk to the experts in the
field.  I only saw one Reporter for a major (US) Network do this.  I never saw
him on TV ever again, make of that what you will.  The experts agreed that the
above were good physics, but impractical given the technology in use at the
time.  And keep in mind that US balistic missile technology was at least a
decade ahead of Soviet technology so if we couldn\'t do they certainly could not
either. ;)

	More armor on the rockets - absorb more incomming energy
	Do you have any idea of how HARD it is to get the bloody rocket up off
the pad in the first place?!?  And you want to make it even harder?!?  I read
one aerospace engineer gave a ratio of 10 to 1 for rockets.  Ie. 10 pounds of
fuel for every pound of payload, and this was an ideal world, this gets
expensive real quick!  No engineer at NASA or in military aerospace took this
seriously.  They called it a "High School Physics" idea.

	Spin the rockets in flight - dissipate more incomming energy
	Do you have any idea of how unstable your average rocket is in the
first place?  And you want to make it even MORE unstable?!?  NASA engineers
said point blank that they couldn\'t do it and guarantee more then one in TWENTY
launches would be successful.  Military aerospace types laughed outloud at this
one, in fact a couple of AF types said they HOPED the Soviets would do it
because then the US wouldn\'t need SDI.  Another "High School Physics" idea.

	Disperse the launch sites - greater range of flight paths to defend
against.
	This one was emminently doable, problem was it would have required the
Soviets to restructure their entire Strategic Missile program and about a
decade of infrastructure investment to pull it off.  In the end this was termed
yet another "High School Physics" idea.

	See what I\'m getting at here?  Your points SOUND good, and in abstract
theory are valid.  But if you have any depth in the field it becomes obvious
you\'re dead wrong. ;) Let me continue...

	<SIGH> Go back and read what the first poster said Very Carefully ;)
because what he\'s talking about is a technical issue of how major institution
archive their DATA.  When you\'re talking about Large Quantities of Data you
lose the ability to find individual bits of information in the DATA.  Let\'s go
with another example...

	You are in a warehouse with 4,000,000 printed pages in tens of
thousands of books.  I\'ll be kind, the books are on shelves but there is no
organization to them.  On one shelf you have a repair manual for tractors next
to a cookbook next to a computer manual for the Apple II next to the Kama Sutra
next to a spy novel next to a romance novel next to a... ;) You get the idea,
it\'s random.  Now you KNOW that somewhere in this Warehouse of books is one
book with a chapter on... Oh Making Film for exposure and thus film negatives.
	Now go find that chapter!  Little daunted by the task are we?  You are
literally going to have to go through EACH BOOK IN TURN to find that Chapter.
It\'s going to take you forever, there are tens of thousands of books in this
warehouse alone!  This is the problem the first poster was trying to explain
and that you missed.  Fine, you have the DATA, and a LOT of OTHER DATA too.
Finding the specific items you want, the Information in the Data, is nigh unto
impossible unless... you organize it. ;)
	HOW you do that is one of the major problems in the Information
Sciences right now and we\'re really not getting anywhere very fast in terms of
solving it. :(

	Okay, unless you\'ve been involved in this in some way it is rather hard
to understand the impact of proprietary information and/or technologies.
Another example okay... ;)
	Few people are aware that the Coka-Cola Inc. is based entirely off a
Trade Secret, proprietary information essentially.  Only a handful of
technicians in a vault (I kid you not, Coke is very proud of that Vault) know
how to make the "recipe" the syrup that is Coka-Cola and has that Coke "taste"
95% of the world can identify blindfolded.  I\'m not joking about the 95% part
BTW, this has been tested, repeatedly.
	So what happens if the technicians, well... "forget" how to make the
syrup?  Well believe it or not back in the early twenties it happened because
the chief technician dropped dead of a heart attack.  None of the other
technicians had ever seen the whole process straight through.  Well they
kludged it together, each technician had seen enough pieces to put the whole
thing together, but the "taste" of Coka-Cola _changed_ for about a year as they
struggled to figure out EXACTLY when the now dead Chief Technician had done to
get the right "taste."
	Now the Coke formula is a "Trade Secret" which means that if anyone can
figure out how to make it they can.  Coke never has had a patent on the process
because OC patents do run out and then competators move in. ;) So right after
the Iranian revolution, the new Iranian government had something like
50,000,000 empty bottles of Coke and all that nationalized bottling and
distribution infrastructure in place.  Problem was they didn\'t have the syrup,
the proprietary product/Trade Secret stuff.  Well they did try to duplicate the
syrup, I mean they had a plant and the ratios, formulas and all the rest of it
in hand.  Easy right?  Piece of cake??  I mean they\'ve even got samples to
reverse engineer from for Heaven\'s Sake!!!
	Nope, they failed, just couldn\'t do it.  And they sunk quite a bit of
tallent and effort into doing it too.  So has Pepsi, which publicly admits they
STILL haven\'t figured out how to clone that bloody Syrup!  And Pepsi\'s been
trying for DECADES!!!  And if you want to talk about industrial espionage... it
doesn\'t get much hotter, ruthless or brutal then it does between Coke and
Pepsi. ;) These guys are out to Destroy the competition and dominate the
WORLD!!!!!  Soft Drink market that is. <grin>
	Now Coke has been around for what, just over a century at this point?
And if they can do it, and they have, then I suspect that other have and will
do so into the future.  Which kind of blows your generalization out of the
water. ;)

	I agree with you here 1,000% since it\'s utterly ridiculous!  The ONLY
explaination that I can make work in my own mind that makes sense is the bloody
Vilani technophobia.  Marc has repeatedly stated that the 3I is most Vilani in
population, therefore my guess is that the inherient cultural conservatism is
what slows everything down.  Though a case could be made for sheer inertia in
the infrastructure too.
	Take the automobile of late Twentieth century Earth FoEx.  Switching to
another fuel source would have tremendously positive environmental impact.
There are a couple of really good alternative fuel systems now available too.
Hydrogen, Natural Gas, heck the Brazilians use high octane wood alcohol for
huge chunks of their economy and made it work.  We KNOW we need to change it,
but we just don\'t.
	Why?  Because a LOT of people are making a LOT of money off the way
things are currently.  Also switching over to a new fuel base would require an
enormous investment of re/building a new infrastructure to support it.  No one
wants to bet the company on hydrogen if natural gas is going to be the winner.
So the infrastructure remains the same and "progress" gets stalled.
	Look at what\'s happened in the US Telecom sector.  The
Telecommunictions Act of 95 basically turned it into a free unregulated market.
Everyone predicted a bloodbath as new technologies took over and older
companies either adapted or died!  Two year later what have we got?  Everyone\'s
raised their prices and they snipe at each other, but nothing\'s really changed.
Too much risk for anyone to make the attempt.  This MIGHT be the restraining
factor that cause TL changes to take so long.  But there are problems with it.
;)

	Please don\'t take any of the above as a flame Hans, I normally look
forward to your post as very well thought out and highly intelligent.  It\'s
just this time...  ::shrug::

	Interesting... the thing is is that I dunno how this works in real
life.  In your example, I doubt that Joe Marine is actually physically
twice Fred Wimpy\'s size and bulk (which is why he takes more damage) but
his DL is more  than twice Fred\'s.  Maybe averaging the rounded-up square
roots of their stats and adding the rounded-up square root of the average,
with a minimum of 3 dice anyhow?

	I\'m visualizing something like this:

[sqrt(STR)+sqrt(DEX)+sqrt(End) all rounded up]/3=x.

x+sqrt(x) rounded up = DL(raw)

if DL(raw)<3 then DL=3
if DL(raw) is equal to or greater than 3, Dl(raw)=DL

	I haven\'t time to run any numbers; I\'ll try this PM.

	This feels just a little less extreme.  My own personal solution to
this whole question was to simply increase the 3 dice max damage to 4 dice,
and to have it as a special case only for mere vanilla non-explosive or
otherwise non-exotic slug rounds; shotguns and explosions and plasma guns
and lasers and so forth do their full damage rating.

	My rationale?  Apparently, getting shot really ruins your day ;).

Galactic uses a subsidiary program called Hexworld to do its world
mapping. You can enter Hexworld by hitting F4 on the subsector map.
Hexworld saves it\'s maps in a coded text format, and it puts these
maps in the <galaxy>\\<sector>\\hex directory, using p<hex#>.hex as
the file name. Just to show an example of one of these files,
here\'s var1\\gythios\\hex\\p2638.hex:

Thorp
GGGGGGGGGGGGPPGGGGGGGGGGGGGPGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
PGGGGGGGGGGGGGPPGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGPPGGGGGGGGGGGGGPGGGGGGDGGGDGGG
GGGGGGDDDGDDGGGGGGGGDJJDDDGGPGGGGGDJJDGDDDPPGGGGGDJJDDJDGDJJJJJDDDGGPP
GDJJJJJJJDGGGPGDDDJDDJBJDGGGGGGGDDGDJJDGGGGGGGGGDDDDDGGGPGGGGGGGGGGGGG
PPGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGPPGGGGGGGGGGGGGPGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGPGGGGGGGGGGGGGPPGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGPPGGGGGGGGGGGGGP
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGPGGGGGGGGGGGGGPPGGGGGGGGGGGG
Start at hex 149 
150 Downport:thorp1.txt

The first line, "Thorp", is the name of the world. The next seven lines
each contain seventy characters, comprising a total of 490 characters
when taken all together. These 490 characters represent the colors of
each of the various hexes on the map (there being a total of 490 hexes
on the map). The colors are coded as follows:

    A  Black    E  Red       I  Dark Grey     M  Light Red
    B  Blue     F  Magenta   J  Light Blue    N  Light Magenta
    C  Green    G  Brown     K  Light Green   O  Light Yellow
    D  Cyan     H  White     L  Light Cyan    P  Bright White

The natural question, of course, is which hex is which? You can figure
this out by going into Hexworld (by using F4 from the subsector map) and
hitting the F1 key once you are there. There should be a little
"Hex:000" on the left side of the map display. The "000" part will keep
changing as you move around the map using the arrow keys. In this way,
you can get a feel for the ordering of how the hexes are numbered.

Just as a hint, it starts out as something like this:

           29
       15   30
   01   16   31
    02   17   32
     03   18   33
      04   19   34
       05   20   35
        06   21   36
         07   22   37
          08   23   38
           09   24   39
            10   25   40
             11   26   etc...
              12   27   etc...
               13   28 
                14

The next line, "Start at hex 149", tells the program where to initially
locate the circle that you use to move around the map.

"150 Downport:thorp1.txt" simply writes "Downport" at hex #150 and
attaches "thorp1.txt" to that location. You can put quite a few of these
location markers on the map, and they don\'t all have to have files or
menus attached.

If you\'re looking for an easy way to turn these Hexworld maps into gifs,
there are a couple different techniques you can try out:

Henrique Vianna (snoopy@ufpel.tche.br) has written a program called
"Capture It!", which is a screen-capturing utility that runs in the
background under DOS as a terminate-and-stay-resident program.
"Capture It!" is available at the SimTel archive:

 ftp://ftp.uoknor.edu/pub/simtelnet/msdos/screen/capture22.zip

Included in the package is a program that converts the screen
captures to GIF format. From there, you can probably load your
GIFs into some paint-program and do your printing that way.

Another method is to use the grab.com and graphcnv.exe utilities,
which are part of the WordPerfect 5.1 package (they probably exist
in some other versions as well). If you have WP51, type "grab /h"
and "graphcnv /h" for more information.

Yet another method, which nearly everyone has at their disposal, is
to access Galactic via a DOS-Window from Windows, then to take a
screen capture via the Alt-PrintScreen function, and then to
Edit/Paste the map into some other Windows program. If you have an image
editing program such as Corel or Paint Show Pro, that would probably do
the job and should even let you convert the map into one of the various
standard image formats, but if you\'re just looking to print the map, you
could probably just paste it into "Write", which is under the
"Accessories" program group, and use the print function from there.

If you come up with any other methods which you think are pretty
straight-forward and fairly accessible for most people, please let
me know about them. Also, if you happen to know a lot about GIF-encoding
and want to write another program to handle all this (for instance, a
program that Hexworld could call to transfer the map into gif or bmp or
even jpg format) let me know. I\'ll be happy to assist in any way I can.

I understand this, but keeping people from attending college on basis of
grade average or entrance test results is in my view not going to happend
in the 3I. The excistence of Internet colleges, low status colleges and 
so on would ensure, in my view, that everybody has the oppurtonity.

I agree somewhat, but the way its becoming here in Norway is that
everybody gets the oppurtonity to attend university, supplimentery 
education for people that work becomes more and more common, all financed
by the state. Today here in Norway there is so many overqualified people
that getting unskilled workers is almost impossible. The only way to get a
job is to get an education, and everybody does that. You then have a
spiral that never ends.

Ok, I follow your aguments, but I disagree. As I said above, it soon
becomes dificult to get unskilled workers, so you hire educated ones.
The ones that don\'t get other jobs. But since everybody wants to 
become a sucsess, and education is the only way to get it, and with 
education, again in my view, being a very easly accesable commodity,
everybody will try to finish or atleast attend college. Even do they 
get a terrible poit average, they still have the degree.
