look at this.)

My apologies to the GDW folks if you don\'t appreciate the tone in which this
is written -- I don\'t like what is happening and I don\'t see any reason for
ME, as an aggravated customer, to mince words.

How stupid do you think I am? Perhaps it *IS* too late to complain about the
use of T2k in the upcoming revision, but I don\'t really care. Between this
little tidbit and Star Viking, I can only say that I haven\'t seen anything to
cheer about. GDW\'s track record is not much to crow about, in terms of
mangling a valiant attempt (MT) and in subsequent skunks (Fighting Ships and
COACC, for example). And, speaking as a person who enthusiastically bought
into first ed Twilight:2000, you botched that one too, which is why I never
bought any more t2k and will NEVER do so. I have absolutely NO CONFIDENCE in
your ability to deliver a product that I will find worthy of spending my
scarce hobby dollars upon.

I only reluctantly bought into MT, and if it hadn\'t been for DGP, would have
had a fairly negative view of the project. As it stands now, I fully expect to
be an EX-customer of GDW, shaking the dust from my feet, never to return. I
didn\'t care for AD&D 2nd ed EITHER, so that is when I stopped buying TSR
materials.

Obviously, you are going to do what you THINK the customer market wants. I just
wanted to let you know that you are creating a lot of ill will out here, and
speaking for myself, not only will *I* stop buying, but negative word of mouth
will undoubtedly have an effect. I have better things  this by apologizing if any of this has appeared on GEnie before,
since some of it has appeared on the TML awhile back.

  The first thing I\'d like to see in the new Traveller is the flavour of
\'classic\' Traveller. I belive that the flavour of the background is the 
number one reason for \'classic\' Travellers popularity, and the fact that 
there still are people who play the old black-cover adventures and start
new campaigns using them. I have run campaigns in the Traveller \'universe\'
using \'classic\' Traveller rules, MegaT, SpaceMaster and I have heard about
people who use this background but the GURPS rules. So while the rules may
change, the background is the most important part.
  Mike Mikesh suggested chaos in the centre of the Imperium and a normal 
situation behind the claw. I could go for that so long as there *is* a area 
that holds the flavour of classic Traveller.
  I think that this is what the \'old-timers\' are looking for in a new Traveller.

  The second thing is the most important one for the new players that 
hopefully will begin to play Traveller. This is that all the things one need
to start to play (except for dice, since Traveller use d6) should be in one (1)
book. I remember when I started to play Traveller. All we had was The Traveller
Book and the Kinunir adventure, and we did ok for several months.
  If it isn\'t possible to put it in one book, it should at least be in one
box, but even this is stretching it. New players is much more likely to buy it
and try it if they get all they need for trying it in one book. If they have
to buy several books they will be more hesitant because of the risk that they
won\'t like it. And if they don\'t buy it, they won\'t even get a chance of 
liking it. 
  I\'ve done this myself on at least one occation.

  The third thing is the general impression of it. This can be divided into
freedom from bugs and Art and slickness. When it comes to freedom from bugs,
GDW has a bad history I\'m sorry to say. Dark Conspiracy were acceptable from
this point of view, and I thought things were looking up, but then I saw the
Nautical/Aviation manual:(
  My personal suggestion would be to let people who know as little as 
possible about the game do the proofreading and playtesting. The reason for 
them doing the proofreading is that people familiar with the system tend to
\'fill in\' things that they know by heart. Cases in point is the lack of 
table of the availability codes and the lack of any mention how contacts make
it easier to find equippment in Dark Conspiracy. People like me who have 
both T2k and Merc know this already, of course. But if I was a newbie, I would
feel left out in the cold. It creates a bad impression.
  Art and general slickness is also very important. I know it shouldn\'t be,
but it is and we\'ve just have to accept that. From this standpoint I\'m sad to
hear that Rob Caswell won\'t be doing any art for it, since the equipment 
drawings are very important in defining the traveller \'feel\'.

  Now we\'ve come to the mechanics: The fourth thing is A Task System 
(capitalization intentional). One where *everybody* risks getting a very bad
fumble or very good success, not just those who are very bad/bery good at what
they do. One where there is some suggestion on the time different actions take,
and where even the non-skilled have some chance of succeeding in very easy
tasks. If I should compare existing task systems, I\'d rate MegaTraveller as
a 10 on a scale from 1 to 10, Spacemaster as a 2 and T2k&Co as a 5 (adequate
if it is refined and added to).

  The fifth is to have basic versions of needed parts of the rules, like
design-systems, world design, and a good selection of vehicles in the basic
rules (good selection as in The Traveller Book) and then put out expansions
with a detailed design system for vehicles and world, and a trade system that
makes sense. 
  One extra reason for design, exploration and commerce rules is that they
allow for solo play. A friend of mine even managed to get a program that 
auto-traded in the Spinward Marches accepted as a special computer project in
high school:)

  Five point five: I agree with Farstar about the level of the design-
systems. One basic level with large building-blocks like \'bridge\' (consoles,
sensors, and crew positions), \'weapon\' (turret and controls) and the like. One
more advanced roughly equivalent with todays MegaTraveller design system, and
one where I can design a 1500MW rapid fusion gun with a ROF of 340 and point
defence fire-control or a special purpose computer. The need for this last
level is there: Some of my MegaT vehicle designs have used weapons designed 
with Striker.
  The same applies for worlds, trade and small weapons (although I think that
Greg Porters 3G can handle small-arms with suitable conversions.)

  The sixth thing is Adventures. If the rules are the hardware, the adventures
are the software, and as Texas Instruments found out, putting out hardware,
in their case the TI-99 micro \'computer\' without the software is the A-number-
one best method of making it a total flop. Good adventures are essential to
the success of a game and *several*shorter*introductory*should*be*in*the*basic*
book!* (I\'d like to say \'as in The Traveller Book\' but I\'d come off sounding 
like a parrot then:)
  Maybe the return in dollars per hour really is greater for oneshot new 
settings like C&D, but lots of unsupported games lead to lots of players that
feel that their game is inadequately supported, and that just might make 
force them away from that company.

  The seventh thing is the importance of good advice. This is a resource that
is almost free for the taking both on the TML and (I assume) GEnie. Think of
this as a form of \'proofreading of concepts\' that will plug the worst cases
of potential for abuse like reactionless thrusters (should IMO be replaced
by the classic fusion rockets of bygone days and old 1ed High Guard).
  Together with the third thing, this means two playtesting groups: One that
don\'t know about the game that test if for ease of play and freedom from
abiguities, and one that do know about the game that test it for holes and
unessesary bad science.
  The secondary skills of the persons making up the companu making a game
shines through very well, the areas where they lack skills tend to stick out
to those who know something about that area. By testing the ideas with people
who have the skills those areas will be covered.
  And it\'s free.

  I\'m sure that there are several other things that I\'d like to see in it,
and I\'ll probably remember them all the instant after I press the \'s\' key,
but here is the eigthth (?) and last: I\'d like to see that Star Viking,
since it use the word \'viking\' in the name, manage to stear clear of all the
stereotypes of bloodthirsty-seven-feet-tall-blonde-bearded-horned-helmeted-
convent-burning-christian-babies-killing-sword-waving-barbarians. Read up a
little on the vikings, find out that the MiddleEast-European trade they
set up had a far greater importance than the scattered raids they mounted.
And please, please, please get the helmets right (hint: the last time anybody
wore a hored helmet around here was during the bronze age, which is some
time before the start of the viking era). That the vikings wore horned 
helmets is an invention by the late 19th century era.

  (And I managed to make number eight about what I\'d like to see in Nova-
Traveller and not what I *don\'t* want to see in Nova-Traveller:)

Twilight 2000 system since I am the Eternal Soldier (Twilight 2000 system)
newsletter editor.  However the Twilight system is one of the best systems
I\'ve seen.  I understand your fears about another system change, but the
system works.  The problems with editing and typos that caused such
problems with MT have been worked by the workshop and the recent products
have been at a much more acceptable level of error.  Personally I was
disappointed that 2300 and MegaTraveller weren\'t more Twilight like to
start with.  At any rate the decision to change to this system has been
made and we will have to live with it, however as has been pointed out
there are tremendous holes in Twilight which will need to be filled for
Traveller (i.e. space flight, trading, vehicle design...).  People should
make clear in letters to Loren what they like/dislike about the
MegaTraveller/Old Traveller systems since we can assume some hybred of
these will be used for the new system.
As for the Computer Virus associated with Star Viking, I have talked to
Frank and it will not be a computer virus as we currently think of the the
term.  (Although I will confess that that was his first thought).  Rather
it will be a program that takes advantage of a rather universal current
architecture flaw and attacks computers in such a way that main processor
replacement is required.  There is an assumption that computer production
is controlled by other computers which are vulnerable to attack.  I also
felt it was important that the failure be masked initially as a straight
production problem/flaw to allow the virus to spread.  It is the
combination of massive loss of main processors along with production 
shutdown caused by the loss of main processors (I love catch-22s) that
causes the long night.  Note that since the person initiating the virus is
the Emperor it could be dispersed by him from several key manufacturing
facilities as part of a technological innovation given free to
manufactures or at least something along those lines.

There have been several discussions of miniatures for Star Viking.  Our
current 25mm playtests have virtually all used Hasbro\'s G.I.Vehicles with
some minor modifications to crew compartments (most on sale for $3.00 or
so).  These work because most of the smaller vehicles are compact anyway.
My companies APCs started out as a one man tank with rockets at the back.
They took about ten minutes to fix up each (cut off the rockets and plate
over the crew compartment the result was virtually a Hammers Slammers
Combat car).  There were also a number of the larger Megaforce vehicles
with the most notable small stuff removed.  The big problems with 25s was
how much could fit on the table and look good.  Since Frank was simulating
several battle on a table at once the 25s were awful crowed.  For the
1/285th scale stuff I suspect that mostly Megaforce will again be used
(since it is about the right scale).   The bad part about these is that
they are die cast and not that easily worked with.

Two or three years ago I went whole hog and bought a new gaming system (MT)
which I thought I had played--I had experience with Traveller.  Within two weeks
   I fell in love with MT and waited patiently for updates (an by this time, err
   ata).

The game makes sense to new players--"Well that\'s a simple task-You gonna do it?
   " Well, they can deal with that kind of information--as opposed to ship desig
   n--which a new player can\'t.  Of course, I\'m not sure new players should need
    to
design ships.

Someone else suggested that GDW put out a ship-building book with cogent
examples of each category of ship to be built.  I like this concept--it is what
   I was missing until I found the TML.  I would also like to see this for robot
   s
and computers--if you compare MT\'s computers and book 8\'s robot brains to
today\'s real capability, MT comes up short.  The people I play with are the
ultimate techies, and spend most of their time designing.  So I NEED logical, up
   to date design rules.

I know a lot of other people have said what I am saying, perhaps more clearly,
   but I feel that we need to let GDW know how many of us want to keep the
Traveller concepts

Jay,

    I suspect that a lot of the negativity that shows up here and in Topic 29
is very simply because we, the current fans and players of
Traveller/MegaTraveller, don\'t see exactly what this new revision is going to
gain us.  I personally would be much happier with a revised and de-warted MT
than with a completely new system, because I have a lot of investment in
Traveller/MT.
    In my opinion, the problems with MT were not so much the rules (although
certain areas could use some fixing), but the lack of support from GDW and
company.  DGP tried, but they couldn\'t output enough stuff to cover the lack
of output from GDW, which was busy with 2300 and 1889.

    On the subject of design rules for starships, I think they\'re almost
required for Traveller because of the universe postulated: there is such a
wide variance in tech levels between different planets that you need lots of
different ships in each "class", and the spatial terrain of an area will also
heavily influence the ships in use.  Another reason its required in any
revised Traveller is because Traveller and MT had it: if you don\'t have new
rules available old Traveller refs will be less likely to convert, unless they
were willing to utilize the miniscule number of ships (mostly wrong, anyway)
that were available in MT or the larger number ships available in
Traveller/High Guard.
    I cannot comment on 2300, never having owned the game, but I found (and
find) the designing of starships/space craft/vehicles fun, rather than work.
Admittedly, I could be warped, but still...  Also, designing starships can
play heavily in some campaigns, especially if you\'re operating in the right
kind of enviroment.

Loren,

    Could you please say a little more about Star Viking, in particular
whether it will include vehicle/weapon design rules, a la Striker, or not? 
I\'m intrigued by it, being a long-time Piper fan, so...

    And to whoever said that the 800 ton Broadswords would be the obvious Star
Viking ship, I laugh heartily.  Try closer to 30,000+ tons, I\'d guess.  In
Space Viking, Nemesis is a 2000-foot spherical ship, and Piper\'s ships don\'t
have fuel requirements per se (it\'s all fission, and you can run for a good
while on a set of power cartridges).  My geometry is rusty, so I don\'t trust
my memory on how many displacement tons a 2000-foot sphere is, could someone
give us a rough estimate?

                   Scott

4/3 pi r cubed, right?  I just punched this through and come up with 8.8
million displacement tons for a \'2000 footer\'.  BTW--I\'m the one who made the
Broadsword comment.  I think it would be too unwieldy from a record keeping
point of view for a single player to try to run 8.8 million tons of ship plus
all the potential carried vehicles. I admit, it was a bit of an underscaled
remark. Rob Dean

Regarding Twilight:2000, I\'ll shut up now.  I do remember the Grenadier
miniatures, although they came out at one of my financial low points, and I
heard the Trav seminar at Origins.  I hope GDW gets them back on the amrket,
though I must add that 25mm will be a lot better for doing the routine work of
a role-playing game than for playing large miniatures battles.  The main
problem from a gamer\'s point of view with 25mm is that tanks and other
vehicles will be too expensive.  I\'m basing this opinion on the prices of 20-
25mm lead or resin tanks for WWII and modern, which probably are low sales
volume items for their manufacturers, and thus fairly comparable.  The
historical miniatures gaming world is engaging in a lot of complaining about
how hard it is to find and interest new people right now, and the second
biggest complaint you hear being discussed is the high cost of initial
investment in miniatures.  (The first is the unnappealing format and
complicated nature of the rules--assuming that Star Viking is comparable to
Command Decision or Combined Arms, this will be less of an issue than it would
be if you wanted to become an ancients gamer using the much complained about
WRG Ancients rules, a discussion for another topic--though there is no
miniatures discussion here, is there?). Anyway, as much appreciated as the
Traveller 25s will be, mass combat using  micro-armor type equipment will be
easier to hook newcomers with. (IMHO... and our local miniatures cabal has
recently snagged two new people for the group by starting a microarmor project
using Command Decision due to the comparatively low start-up cost.)

Jay, 
    You asked about why anyone would want a ship design system in a role-
playing game, and mention that you thought there were enough ship designs in
2300 to run the game.  I think that you may be close to right with 2300--I
havne\'t got the rules handy, but it seemed to me that the basic game needed
the details of a lander.  Mere quibbling.  At any rate, back to the question. 
The best answer that I can come up with is that there is a substantial
difference in the way ships are handled in Traveller and in 2300.  In 2300 a
ship is something which is so rare that players cannot really aspire to own
one.  Since they are issued to them by their bosses, they pretty much have to
take what they are given and work with it.  In Traveller, it is relatively
easy for a character to end up as the owner of a ship.  While a lot of ship
owners will use (and be content with) standard designs, the profusion of small
owner /operators is going to make slightly different customized ships quite
common.  After all, while you may want something like a Type M standard
merchant, if you know that you are going to be trading in a cluster where Jump-
2 is going to be sufficient, why pay extra for a jump-3? Also, ships are built
(I get the impression) as one-offs rather than mass-produced for new ship
lots.  Thus, the difference in background between the two games logically
leads to a situation where custom ships are more common in Traveller.  In
2300, too, extra engine capacity is useful, since it reduces the amount of
time between any two stars, while in Traveller extra jumop capacity is
expensive dead weight.  So, unless the flavor of the game is going to change
so much that the current level of ship ownership is going to be radically
different, it will make sense for there to be a ship design system at least as
capable as the old Book 2 system, which was pretty modular and very easy to
work with.  The level of detail given in the MegaTraveller referee\'s manual is
by no means necessary.  If, however, a revised version of the MT ref\'s manual
was used as a basis (i.e., a supplement), it would be a good design scheme to
ensure that the stripped down modular \'Book 2\' version remained compatible.  I
think it would be possible, even under the current system, to put together
such a \'book 2\' subset of the rules in no more than 4 or 5 pages, by leaving
out things like avionics, variable armor and most of the weapon and shield
data, and generating a table of relatively few options for standard hulls,
power plants and environmental suites.

"Historically" speaking, many players I\'ve seen have been as attached to their
ships as to their characters, and I tend to view \'the ship\' as another member
of the party.  (Albeit one that won\'t fit into the bar...)

I can vouch for that!  (hehehe)

Is it just my imagination, or haven\'t GDW and DGP been promising to do this
for years now?  Steve makes an excellent point.  Sure, the fact that in the
_Spinward Marches Campaign_ [sic], there is no way for diplomats to get liason
skill or rogues to get streetwise is amusing to those of us who already
possessed _Citizens of the Imperium_, but what of the newcomers?  Sad as it
seems, it appears to me as though the games houses don\'t really care what they
put into print anymore.  (Although Steve and I both agree that DGP has done a

Funny how Traveller lasted for fifteen years and developed a large
following... until GDW got all caught up with a _Perestroika_ of their own.
Let face it:  The game is better when there are lots of "villains" (?) for the
characters to match wits against.  The Zhos felt an aweful lot like the
Communists, while the Solomani (*my* personal favorites) were ruthless hoards
of Nazi, KKK, David Duke, Afrikaner fascists.  (You just can\'t make a better
villain!)  I mean, heck, they even wear armbands and talk about the purity of
the race!  The endless intrigues for Terra and along the border were always
fertile ground for adventure.  Now, it seems, either the Solomani will get
back their sphere, checked only by Daibei and Margret, or will be beaten back
by who knows what?  And if they\'re beaten back, will it be by a bunch of "Star
Vikings"?!  Sure, this New World Order does mean lots of little states, but as
anyone who studies the international scene can attest, it just isn\'t the same
as having a conflict between Great Powers.  In the real world, the collapse of
the Cold War is great.  In a game world, however, the loss in tention and fear
is less positive.

The current state of affairs of Traveller, MT, et al. is enough to make someone
who grew up on Classic Traveller cry.

I wonder, is it really any coincidence that Marc Miller is leaving GDW???  It
sounds like the Gygax coup all over again.

:I assume that some kindly soul will forward this to GDW.

:Mike Metlay expresses my feelings about New Traveller perfectly.
:By all means fix the bits of MegaTraveller that needs fixing,
:but leave the background alone. Throwing out 15 years of
:acumulated background material is a really really bad idea.

Mike, that\'s not funny.  I\'m in the midst of some work for a general systems
theorist out here who goes on for hundreds of agonizing pages showing 
precisely why, in evolutionary terms, we must do something NOW or lose
our place at the top of the Darwinian ladder to our machines.

So, I guess the response to the question (sorry, forgot the author)
"Where are the robot societies?"  Is - they don\'t want to associate

outstanding.  You gotta have good players.


Second: what failed

MT doesn\'t really handle five major simultaneous plot threads well.
Especially when they are five different major races, in different
places.  If you\'re considering a PBEM - keep it small and limit
the plot threads.

I invite discussion.  Now. let\'s move our pbemchat stuff back over

Thanks Richard, for a megatons of inspiring fun and creativity.  The
PBEM is indeed on permanent ice.

I just talked to Richard via telephone.  He asked me to impart some
additional comments.

The PBEM had become more of a time-consuming responsibility for him than
fun.  Richard wants himself and ourselves to be free to contribute in
other ways.  He feels it\'s important that he turn his attention to the
burning new issue of the Traveller Revision, and have free time once
again for the discussion of Computer Aided Traveller.

Who knows, maybe someone will be inspired to start another PBEM!

comments to be read by someone at least reasonably involved with this
new Traveller revision.

What would I like to see from MegaTraveller in the new Traveller?
   The character generation system, for one thing. One of the things
which creates the flavor of a Traveller game is the semi-controlled
nature of character generation. The Twilight:2000 system is, in my
opinion, too much under the control of the player. I don\'t think
there\'s a single Traveller or MegaTraveller player who hasn\'t got a
story about that character who rose rapidly to the top of his/her/its
service only to be kicked out or nearly killed at the peak of his/her/
its career, or that one level of instruction skill the character
picked up which just happened to save the party\'s butt when they
discovered that the new crewmember didn\'t know how to use a vacc suit.
If you take all the die rolls out of the Traveller character
generation system, you take out something of the game\'s spirit.
   A ship design system. I like the idea of having a system based on
"modular designs" in the basic rules and then a more detailed system
(I\'d prefer _very_ detailed) in a rules supplement.
   The combat system. The MegaTraveller combat system is one of the
best I\'ve ever come across, with the exception of the autofire rules
(see below).
   The task system. The Twilight:2000 task system is inferior, in my
opinion, and deserves to be taken out and shot. The MegaTraveller task
system is a study in elegance and ease of use. I had my players
talking and understanding the lingo of tasks inside an hour.
   DGP.
   The rich, detailed background. I personally liked the Rebellion,
but with the background in MegaTraveller you could play either during
_or_ before the Rebellion.

What I\'d like to _not_ see from MegaTraveller in the new Traveller:
   The disorganization and the typos. Need I say more?
   The tendency to underexplain rules. There are some parts of the
MegaTraveller rules which are extremely terse, almost cryptic at
times.
   The autofire rules. These appear to have absolutely no basis in
anything like reality.

What I\'d like to see in the new Traveller that wasn\'t in
MegaTraveller:
   A robot design system.
   A weapons design system.
   A supplement with examples of all types of vehicles (sort of a
combination of _101 Vehicles_, _Traders and Gunboats_, and _Fighting
Ships_).
   An index.
   A complete, comprehensive guide to the aliens of the Traveller
universe. Including minor races. There have been so many references to
the Vegans in recent Traveller products, but I\'ve never seen rules on
creating a Vegan character.

There. I\'m glad I got that off my chest! Now I hope the X-boat can get
this through before the new game goes to print!

Speaking as a computer scientist of sorts, I can summarize my
thoughts about the above-quoted "explanation" in but five words
- -- dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb!  "It\'s not a computer virus, just
a sort of program which attacks a common architectural flaw in
a wide variety of CPUs to physically destroy them after a
while..." may be a distinction, but it\'s certainly a distinction
without a difference.  And all the same arguments given
previously against the Dread Virus, plus some more, apply.  Just
for kicks, let\'s summarize some of the more persuasive of
these...

(1)  If the DV "isn\'t a virus", how the heck does it affect
the *existing CPUs* (assuming the Evil Emperor can seed 90% or
more of the existing production facilities, which seems
completely ludicrous to me anyway)???  Are we supposed to
believe that the typical failure rate for CPUs is 80-90%/year?
Face it, it was more plausible when it was a virus.

(2)  If all the computers are destroyed, how the heck are the
Star Viking ships driving around?  You want to jump a starship
under manual control?  Good luck -- you\'ll sure need it!

(3)  Given that the DV only destroys CPUs, how long do you
really think it would take to regenerate the technology?  I\'ll
bet me and 5 other carefully selected folks could go from TL6
TTL to TL8 SPARC in less than 5 years, by careful reuse of
non-computerized parts of existing equipment.  With no TL7 or
TL8 technology whatsoever, it would take about 500 people 10
years.  Neither is particularly prohibitive.  With any
reasonable extrapolation, the "Long Night" isn\'t, very.

(4)  Do you really believe the "common architectural flaw"
argument above?  If so, then answer these:  Do you believe that
all TL7 bridges contain a common easily exploitable
architectural flaw?  Is this more or less likely than that all
TL4 bridges did (HINT: think resonance)?  Is this a fair
analogy?  What other analogies of this sort might one draw
(IDEAS: automobiles, electrical devices, plumbing)?  Do they
lead to similar conclusions (SUGGESTED ANSWER: yes)?

Finally, riddle me this:  GDW is making noises about "listening
to customer input".  I\'ve seen at least 5 distinct messages
approving a suggestion that the Star Viking setting be
explained by simply putting it in another part of the galaxy
from Traveller -- an area with low max TL.  This seems to me to
be reasonable and practical while still allowing the SV
universe adequate latitude for development.  So WHY KEEP PUSHING
THIS VIRUS THING???  Take my word for it that the day this
utterly stupid concept appears on the shelves is the last day I
or anyone I know buys a GDW product.

One of your potential customers for a single-book
beginner-oriented revised Traveller, but *not* for SV, T2K,
T2K+, D&C, or other similar silliness...

on the books. When they are sold through the normal bookstores they create new
interest and when they are sold in game shops they promote conversion.
  Just as importat is of course that they are good, if the book sucks 99%
of those who read it first and look at the game later will become convinced that
the game sucks too.

  This goes for all the other eight things I listed too and it cannot be said
too often:
  "Do it ONCE and do it RIGHT!"

  On to T2k: When it comes to the combat system I am split in my opinion of it.
I like the 1ed damage system (personal and vehicles) so much that I have used 
it for Traveller. While I havent done it yet, I suspect that 2ed will be harder
to use this way, since the personal armors are much less diverse.
  The hit procedure on the other hand leaves things to be desired. I must 
confess to be the culprit Farstar mentioned that had dared to compare reality 
with game mechanics. What I did was ask a relative who worked for several years
with turning yokels into soldiers which system best represent reality. The one
where the hit chance goes up linearly from 0 to some percentage or the one 
where anyone has some chance to hit an esy target if they find the trigger, 
the first instruction gives a big jump in ability and later instruction gives
small adds to abilities.
  He answered that the second looked more like reality to him. And that was 
one of the reasons I kept the MegaT hit procedure even though I used the T2k
damage system.
  I like the recoil and autofire rules though and would probably use them if 
I\'d repeat it today. The autofire rules are by the way IMHO the best I\'ve seen
in any system.

  The one really bad point (but easy to correct, as opposed to the lacking
skill/task system) I can see about T2k in general is that people tend to 
absorbe incredible amounts of damage and keep going. The damage points for all
locations should at least be be halved, since \'juggernautism\' rewards gung-ho
munchkinism.

Thinking about a tech level for lightsabres, what would one be in

Maybe some sort of plasma/fusion reaction very  tightly  contained  (More
TL17+  magic) ? That would explain it\'s habit of slicing through anything
it touched, and if the Starwars \'Blasters\' use  some  sort  of  projected
magnetic /gravitic  field to fire bolts of plasma, then the field holding
the lightsabre together could possibly deflect them. 

Any Starwars fans out there got an \'official\' explanation ?  Anyone  want

Greetings, all. 

After several days of watching the discussions going on in this  category\'s
various topics, I think there are some important things  that need to be said
about our plans for a Traveller revision.  So  without further ado: 

(1) Frankly, we at GDW have let our involvement in the Traveller line  lapse
over the past several years.  Just look at how few new releases  we\'ve had
since the inception of MegaTraveller.  In my opinion, that\'s  a shame, and
it\'s high time for us to devote some serious company  resources to the line
again.  Which is exactly what we\'re doing.  Not  only have we hired Dave
Nilsen--a long-time Traveller player who  sacrificed a house and career to
take the job of Traveller line  manager--but ALL of us are actively involved
in our plans for  Traveller. 

(2) The fact that we\'re all excited, and that Dave is line manager  because
he\'s an absolute Traveller fanatic, brings me to an earlier  post about
customers being "cash cows."  No way.  We publish games  because we\'re gamers.
Yes, we have to make a buck at it, but we don\'t  sit and plan how to milk
customers.  Rather, we sit and plan products  that we\'re excited about
playing, and that we think will appeal to  other gamers.  If the products are
good, we\'ll make a living; if not,  we\'ll have to change careers.  And believe
me, there are always more  ideas we want to do than we can physically get
done.  There simply  isn\'t any need to try to milk customers. 

(3) Every game publisher I\'ve ever met cringes at the thought of  revising a
game.  But sometimes it simply has to be done. 

     MECHANICS: Original Traveller was fun, but it\'s old, and it shows  it. 
MegaTraveller can be fun, too, but frankly, it\'s entirely too  tough for
neophytes to learn unassisted.  And without new players, the  game is doomed
to die, even if it be a slow death.  
     In contrast, our current house RPG rules, beginning with T2K2  (Twilight:
2000, 2nd ed.) and as adapted for Cads and Dinos and Dark  Conspiracy, are
extremely easy for new players to learn, and they\'ve  been receiving very
complimentary comments.  Believe me, I understand  the appeal of the
MegaTraveller task system--I grew very familiar with  it during my stint as
2300 AD line manager.  And I understand that the  new "house" task system
FEELS different.  But honestly, the new task  system has benefits that the
other does not, especially when expanded  from the current D10 to D20, as is
planned in the new Traveller.  I  won\'t take the time or space to discuss
those benefits here (as I have  other topics to get to and don\'t wish to make
this a very long  message) but will in a future posting.  

     BACKGROUND: Another thing that puts new players off is the  incredible
amount of material that\'s already been published for the  line.  In
particular, the more fully the Imperium\'s history is  published, the more
daunting it is for a new referee to try to run a  campaign--and the less room
there is for exploration and discovery.   When Traveller first started, every
adventure was a new discovery.  It  is our intent to make that possible again.

     The good news is that we\'re convinced it is possible to make the  game
more accessible to new players WITHOUT making everything that\'s  been
published to date just so much paper.  The Star Viking era is the  way.  It
may not be the only way, but it\'s the one we\'re most excited  about.  As
characters re-explore what used to be the Imperium, old  knowledge will remain
valuable but not faultless.  The fact that an  old characters may say, "I
remember this planet used to be a theocracy  80 years ago," will be a clue to
its likely present condition, but not  an absolute fact.  In this way, new
characters can look to old ones  for information, but both will be facing
considerable mystery as they  re-explore.

(4) Concerning comments that a virus that selectively kills certain  tech
level computers is a silly idea, you haven\'t heard how it works  yet!  Without
giving too much away too early, let me at least point  out that the virus is
an idea that was given to us by a professional  computer designer projecting
logical future computer designs.  Please,  give us some credit.  We take
Traveller seriously too. 

(5) The Star Viking: Planetfall game will be an open-and-play set with 
miniatures rules AND figures and terrain.  It is our intent to make it  so
user-friendly that people who buy it at GEN/Con-Origins next year  will be
playing it immediately at the convention. 

(6) By the way, in the coming era, Star Vikings aren\'t so much reavers  as
explorers and merchants trying to re-expand a galactic  civilization.  

(7) CONCLUSION: I guess what I\'m really asking for is for you to trust  us. 
We admit that we\'ve let our enthusiasm for Traveller lapse, but  we\'re
extremely excited about its future once again.  Watch Challenge  magazine in
the next several months, and I think you\'ll begin to see  that excitement. 
Come talk to us at conventions, and I guarantee that  our enthusiasm will rub
off on you.  Believe me, it is not our intent  to leave you all in the lurch,
with a ton of useless old material on  your hands.  But neither is it our
intent to let Traveller become  nothing more than an old game that people
recall sometimes with  fondness.  

We have a dream, and it\'s going to be fun for all concerned.  Details  to
follow in future posts. 

Sincerely, 

     Lester Smith

Mac is right, the "virus thing" is real. Don\'t react until you hear the whole
thing, please.

Rob,
     "Are you sure that we can\'t interest you in a pool of very interested and
experienced people to playtest/comment before its too late to make changes?"
     Who ever said we weren\'t interested in such a pool. Rob Prior has offered
to review the vehicle design system, and Dave has decided that is probably a
good idea. Nobody else has volunteered....not in so many  words, anyway. If,
however, you are not willing to look at a game based on the T2K2 mechanics
(and that includes a variant on the task system...yes, T2K2 has a task system -
- - one that inspired that in 2300 and MT), I don\'t see that you can be much use
to us, as that is one of the few things we have decided upon.
     On the other hand, if you are willing to give us an even break, we\'ll
listen to what you have to say (we have already...Frank has put your
suggestion about stabilized guns into Sands of War).
     Let me explain one more thing: GEnie is not our only customer feedback.
If we went solely by GEnie, Twilight would not be a very important game in our
line, but as of last week\'s sales figures, it generates four times MT\'s 
dollar volume. How do I explain this? I don\'t...evidently Twilight players
aren\'t computer-philes, or at least not GEnie-philes.
     Carl,
     Thanks for the TML update.

     As an example of a modularized MT design system, I offer the following.
 It\'s hardly complete, but should give a feel for a basic system that would be
 completely compatible with the current MT design rules.  The trick here is
we\'re
 simply pre-calculating most of the important sections and allowing the ref or
 player to pick & choose, mix and match between them.

<You get the idea----I deleted most of the long wepaons lists since
this post is already long enough--Rob Dean>

     Sensors & comm are simple enough, they can be left as is.  Gives the
players
 a clear idea of what these systems do (and potential easy upgrades for their
 ship).  Since we\'ve already got a running total of CP\'s, the computer rules
 (with TL modifications added!!!) can remain as is.  Accommodations mostly
 consume space and add weight, on smaller ships anyway, so their power
 consumption can be covered in the "slop" in the above numbers.
     A potential improvement would be to combine the Hull & Manuever drive
 sections, so you\'re buying a 100ton 1SL hull with a 2G M-drive and power to
 operate the drive and life support.

Loren,

    I\'ll review the vehicle design system, any starship design system, and any
weapons design system that should happen to appear for you.  So there.

    Now, on to other stuff.  OK, on this "virus" thing, I\'ll hold my fire, but
I don\'t really think it\'s necessary: Star Vikings really only needs a slight
drop in tech capability to be plausible (remember, we\'ve got lots of
troops/ships running around in a very loose Command/Control environment (the
Rebellion)). The MT task system pre-dates T2 v2, and I think DGP was putting
tasks into some of it\'s stuff back when T2 v1 appeared, so.....

    There is a relatively easy explanation, in my opinion for the difference
in sales figures: support.  The last GDW MegaTraveller product that I can
remember was KnightFall, which came out over a year ago...

All of a sudden the MT `task system\' is God\'s gift to gaming (a 10 on a 1-10
scale?). Come on, give me a break. This system is the think I absolutely hate 
about MT most of all. It won\'t work for combat ---- the 4-point step range
bands are silly at best, and the gradations for stats (based on a reading of
the rules, for an unskilled task average task, a person with learning
disorders (IQ5) has a 72% chance of success, while a genius-level character
has a 83\\% chance -- big deal, and it gest worse at higher skill levels).
The time value is okay, but requires an extra roll, takes task difficulty
into account not at all, and isn\'t even very instinctive. I say scrap the
whole thing. If skills were 1-10, you could say time was 5(base)/SL just
as easily. The task system won\'t do weapon damage, has no success gradations
(oh... I forgot, the exceptional success rules... how silly of me) worth
mentioning, and simply dresses up overly large modifiers (+4, +8, -4) in
cute little named categories. 

The t2k2 system has stupid rules for exceptional success (why not use the
ones in the first version -- that a 1 is rerolled, with another success 
meaning exceptional, and the same way with a 10), the autofire rules are
suspect (a goat has the same chance to hit as an elite commando with a
machine-gun), damage needs some work (I think a man can punch through 20mm
of armor and do damage), but half skill/double skill are no less instinctive
than the MT tasks. Skills are way too low in t2k2 (but this is not very hard
to fix), but that\'s not intrinsic to the task system. 

Finally, has anyone tried playing MT ships using the personal combat rules?
Will the new version have one rule set for ships/men/tanks in combat? I sure
hope so, since I simply cannot stand the abstract nature of the current rules.
Why is this so? If the ship rules were simple, then hey, I could understand.
But they\'re not, and you get wierd results where the task system isn\'t used
at all (now you have to roll low instead of in every other game part), armor
becomes this weird abstract thing (as do weapons, btw), etc. Why? Why? Why?!?

I for one am glad to see the MT task system go. Save the universe, I say 
(though I too think that the rebellion stinks and would like to assume it never
happened), but kill the system. It adds nothing but confusion and bizarre
abstraction that neither first-time players or experience RPGes from other
systems have any desire to see or learn.

With an Isp of 6e5, these aren\'t going to have *big* drive flames. For
a 200-ton (mass) Scout, at 1g the drive is using 1/3rd *kilo* of fuel
per second! Sure, it\'ll still burn a hole in the tarmac. So did the
"emergency rockets" in Murray Leinster\'s Med Ship universe. But if the
main drive is burning a hole only a foot or two across, I\'d say that
you just *design* landing pads to have holes there already,. (bigger
than the ones the drive would make anyway)

This *does* make one major change to the way Traveller is currently
played. A fusion exhaust is going to be detectable at rather large
distances. For that matter, "clearing the throat" of the drive will
tend to discourage anybody messing around the aft end of the ship. (to
say nothing of blinding them!)

     At first, I figured that I would just sit quietly and watch the
debate on the proposed new Traveller revision rage back and forth.
There didn\'t seem to be any reason for me to add to it, since I figured
that everything I might want to say would be said by someone else.
Mostly, this is what happened, due in large part to Metlay\'s comments.
No surprise, since I agree with most of what Metlay says.

     However, there\'s at least one point that I haven\'t seen anyone
raise, and a comment that I want to make (maybe two).

     As everyone knows, there has been a great deal of controversy over
the upcoming new version of Traveller.  Like a great many net debates
I\'ve seen (in nearly ten years), there has been a great deal of heat
generated.  Unlike many, there has been a fair amount of light, too.
(On a tangent, I\'m sure that GDW and DGP are happy to see that so many
people care so much about the game.)

     I have a question, though:  Do people realize that you don\'t have
to play by the new rules?  I bought MegaTraveller when it came out, and
have kept up with it (I\'m something of a collector; I have a copy of
almost everything published for (Mega)Traveller).  I like MegaTraveller
quite a bit, and *really* enjoy the fine products from DGP, but I\'ve
never played using those rules.  I still use Classic Traveller.  I can
use the MegaTraveller publications as a rich supply of source material,
so I\'ve never seen the need to update.  My players don\'t seem to mind,
either (I mostly GM).  Whether or not I particularly like the new
edition, I can probably use it, with suitable adaptation.  Unless, of
course, it departs too far from what has gone before.

     A few years ago, I bought a copy of Twilight:  2000 (the first
edition), since I had some friends who wanted to play it.  I was, ah,
unimpressed with it.  Sufficiently underwhelmed that I didn\'t bother
to get the second edition.  Dark Conspiracy sounds interesting, but I
haven\'t purchased a copy yet (no excuse for not reading it--my roommate
has a copy).  Personally, I don\'t like the idea that Traveller is going
to be shoehorned into the Twilight system, but I can probably tolerate
it.  However...

     I have to echo several other people--*definitely* keep the current
task system (though you might want to include a more detailed
explanation with more examples).  Admittedly, I don\'t have second
edition Twilight:  2000, but what I remember from the first edition
doesn\'t encourage me.


     If Rob and/or Carl would be kind enough to transfer this to GEnie,
I\'d be much obliged.  For that matter, how does one get an account on
GEnie?  I have an information packet from GEnie, but the 800 number in
it (1-800-387-8330) only gets a recording saying that the call can\'t
be completed as dialed.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

  If everybody promise not to come with any nasty comments about space opera I
have a thing to reveal:
  There are something superficially similar to a lightsabre in my Traveller
campaign. It is a hollow length of very thin pipe, one inch across and seven
inches long with three buttons and one ring on the outer surface. One button
switches it on and off. When it is on, a black weightless tube extends from
one end of the contraption. The second button causes the whole thing to 
juggle around. A check revealed that this was done by gravitics. The third
has no effect. The final control is the ring: with it, the length of the
tube can be varied from about one foot to four feet. It appear that it
originally could go further than to the four feet position.
  The thing that intrigued the players was that the tube anihilated everything 
it touched, and it immediately found a niche as a tool and weapon.
  
  The real story is that this, of course, was an Artifact done for a very
different purpose than to be a handy tool to cut up walls with namely as a
survery drill. The second button originally locked it in place with regards
to the planetary gravitic field, the third button brought up the drill-core
(both the \'handle\' and the \'force field\' was hollow, remember?), and the ring
could originally lengthen the field to several kilometers.

  Voila, a gimmic complete with justification.

  I don\'t doubt that the T2k system CAN be done into something usable with 
Traveller, if what it lacks today is added. I think however that the current
T2k system isn\'t good enough to handle a SF-RPG of the semi-hard variety
that Traveller is (Traveller was at least, I hope it still will be).

     A better explanation for the "Long Night" would possibly be the sudden
advance of technology discovered from ancient sites and their use by the 
emporor in brutaly conquering the imperium once again followed by the sudden
return of Grandfather with a good deal of wrath.  After all, from all I have
read not much would escape in an attack made by Grandfather.  Perhaps the only
planets to survive semi-intact would be those with low tech levels.  This 
sounds somewhat more plausible.  (Compared to the virus idea.)  Matt Teets.

 ---- snip ----

Lester:

Some comments on your last GEnie letter, if you don\'t mind....

1. You want more Traveller? Great, so do we. I don\'t know if what you\'re
proposing qualifies just yet. 

2. To quote you, loosely: "If the products are good, we make a living; if
the products are bad, we\'ll change careers." This is bilge, and you know
it. If the products SELL, you\'ll make a living, and if they DON\'T sell, 
you\'ll change careers. Quality and salability are unrelated except in 
the most nebulous terms, even in the supposedly demanding game industry.
The fact that T2k, a morally reprehensible and utterly ridiculous post-
holocaust scenario, outsells MT by a factor of four is a perfect example
of this. You\'ll make your living if the new rules set is glitzy, well-
produced, readable, and chock-full of good art. The rules are secondary,
except to the people who read these bulletin boards-- and we seem to be
a sort of \'lunatic fringe\' to you guys, so why should our opinions matter?

You claim your company cares about our opinions. So far you have not 
demonstrated this at all. Between the lack of support given MT and the
refusal to budge on the single most important issue raised by the people
whose opinions you crave, the new rules system basis, you have only
shown a willingness to SAY you\'re listening. 

3. Revisions are worthwhile. What you\'re planning to do to Traveller
isn\'t a revision, any more than hitting someone with an axe is surgery.
A jump of eighty years of timeline is a barely tolerable patch to the
previous system\'s continuity, but I could think of a lot of others that
would work better. This appeal to the younger, less sophisticated gamer
(less intrigue and reading, more killing and mayhem) will probably sell
a fair number of games, but will sour older gamers on what used to be
a very interesting universe. But then, we\'re just the lunatic fringe, 
and our opinions hardly matter.

4. I\'ll believe your megavirus idea isn\'t idiotic when I hear it. You claim
that you have a computer scientist who backs you up on it. Big deal, I can
give you the name and address of an accredited physicist who wants to blow
up the Moon and drop a chunk in the Pacific to turn the Earth into a tropical
paradise. Your audience on the TML, and to a lesser extent on GEnie, are
the cream of the computer science world. If there are holes in your argument,
they\'ll find them, and FAST.

5. My argument with Star Viking is with the background, not the game. I won\'t
pass judgement on it until I see it. (See more on this matter below.)

6. Oh, so they\'re NOT reavers, they\'re explorers and merchants, eh? Then why
the heck are you calling them Star Vikings? 

7. Now we reach the meat of the matter: you\'re asking us to trust you.

Yeah, right. Uh-huh. 

Let me explain my position very clearly here, so I won\'t be misunderstood. 
I have been gaming for sixteen years, and have played Traveller since it 
was invented. I have played and run games and campaigns in at least twenty
different rules systems, from AD&D to Bunnies and Burrows. I am always, 
always, ALWAYS on the lookout for new game systems that do what I want to
do in a game in a better fashion: faster, more playable, more realistic.

When a rules system falls short, I don\'t just whine, I fix it. Trav Classic
had problems with personal combat and skill use, which I fixed. MT had
problems with the task system and starship combat, which I tried to fix
and (in the ship combat case) failed, going back to the Trav Classic system
which was long in the tooth but still usable. The TDR project was the latest
in a series of attempts to patch MT so it worked as easily as it should have.

I stopped trusting game companies in 1979, when an article I submitted to 
the JTAS for publication was removed from the To Be Published file by a GDW
staffer (I won\'t say whom here) and LOST. It was a lousy article, actually,
but the incident taught me once and for all that game companies are 
fallible. It remained for the invention of Email, though, for me to open a
dialogue with them and try to get them to listen to my suggestions. Their
record, to date, has been less than stellar, and I DON\'T think it\'s because
my opinions are poorly formed and without popular support.

So, in a nutshell, I DON\'T trust you. The proof of the pudding is in the
tasting. And you can bet that I\'ll be at the head of the line, with a 
BIG motherhumping spoon in my hand....

Loren:

You claim that nobody\'s actually volunteered to step forward and test the 
new rules. Well, you may well be right. Please allow me to rectify that
right now. I would be a worse-than-useless windbag if I were to rail at you
for what you\'re trying to accomplish, without offering anything constructive
in return; therefore I hereby volunteer myself and my current Traveller 
party as playtesters for any and all aspects of the new rules. My group
includes people who have published articles and rules supplements for GDW,
TSR, Chaosium and Steve Jackson, and who have a median age of thirty-one
and a median gaming experience of eleven years per capita. We play many
different rules systems, and enjoy them all to some extent or another.

I have a great deal of loyalty to the old Traveller universe, and a modicum
of loyalty to the old rules system (Classic, not MT). BUT any rules system
that is clear, logical, realistic and easy to learn and master will always
win my loyalty, no matter how much I play and love older systems. IF this
new rules system of yours is a substantial improvement over what has gone
before, I give you my word as a scientist and as a gamer that I will loudly
and vociferously support it, and GDW, against all comers. If there are
places in it that are NOT workable, however, I would request as a matter 
of common courtesy that my suggestions be considered, particularly if they
take the form of quantitative suggestions like "Replace such-and-such with
such-and-such, as it makes things flow more smoothly without impairing
realism" rather than flames like "The combat system sucks, throw it out."

I eagerly await your response.

Traveller Est!

Jay:

How much Traveller and MegaTraveller have you played and refereed, if you
don\'t mind my asking? Just curious.

- ----

Here\'s a question for all the GEnie readers interested in Traveller: are
you intimidated by the presence of GDW and/or DGP on GEnie? If so, please
feel free to post publically and indignantly that you\'re not, and send
private mail to Rob Dean, who\'ll forward it to me. One of the more interesting
metatopics on the TML these days is whether or not we benefit or suffer more
from having no direct link to the game companies-- Rob has received private]
mail from at least one GEnie reader who has said, "I agree with you in your
criticisms, but I can\'t say that on GEnie or GDW won\'t publish my work."

Comments?

metlay

PS. If I appear to be a thorn in anyone\'s (or everyone\'s!) side, please 
understand that I mean no personal offense. But dialogue and exchange
of information must be done between equals, and a situation where the
companies are regarded as somehow "superior" is unacceptable. And you
may as well get used to having me around... it\'s not nice of me to force
poor Rob to post all my messages and serve as a buffer between me and 
all the GDW-supporting munchkins out there who want to slip me a Dagger
(250 grams, not counted against personal weight penalty) between the 
short ribs, so I\'m getting myself a GEnie account. 

See you on the Net, folx. *nasty grin*

Well a few years ago, I ran a Vargr, the one from the Traveller
Adventure, in fact. Anyway one of the Characters, a female human, and
I were getting very close. The GM unfortunately stopped running the
game so I never will know what would have happened.

Let them, I think that since there are humans that find bestiality
appealing, then I would assume that Vargr could have the same type of
mind set, so what would be wrong with interacial relations. Sexual
relations would be possible, but you would have to think about it.
Are Vargr women the same as their Terran counter parts, are they only
receptive to sex when they are in heat? Or was this changed by
whoever did the genetic engineering on them. Just realize two things,
one, I would think that it would be impossible to have  children,  as
it is now, although you could change that if you want.  Two,  there 
would  prejudice from both Humans and Vargrs, the same as there are
with interracial relationships here on Terra at the present time..

1: We\'d like to see the \'Light Behind the Claw\' remain stable, with it\'s

\'classic\' campaign area. We\'d like to have a section where this \'Virus\'

frankly we\'re also nervous about this Virus Idea.

2: Most of us personally like the very detailed methods of building vehicles,
and weapons (circa striker) and we\'d also like to see such things in
supplements, rather than the basic modules. We don\'t want to wait forever to
do it up though.

3: We\'d like to see you keep the task system. Even if the rules change slightly
on how it\'s used, we really like the MT task system for everyday operations.
We all know Ship Combat was broke to begin with, so we don\'t even try to apply
it - we just fake it based on a combination of classic traveller, mayday,
and common sense.

4: I would be willing (THIS IS AN OFFER TO PLAYTEST) to playtest the
new traveller version. In Columbia, we have a wide variety of players and I\'d
also be willing to do something with Internet on a small scale (not as much
time as Richard had for the great games).

Er to be its just like christmas cause I just found this archive 

Since you people seem to be what you are, the traveller guru\'s I have some
questions concerning floorplans .

In the GDW versions they all seem to lack lifesupport, grav plates,
compensators etc . Do these count when creating floorplans . 

All my floor plans seem to never come out at the right figure, and all
look stupid . 

Also would anyone have a copy of the errata material put out by GDW about
megatraveller . Since I live in australia its a bit hard to send self
addressed envelopes overseea . I was wondering if anyone could possibly see
thier way clear to sending me a copy . 

Please 

Thats all I can think of . My account runs out on the 16th of dec and I 
believe this archive goes down on dec 1 .

Well, Don\'t sweat it.  I had one of those players too.  It was acutally
a lot of fun.  There was the time he went into the Vargr section at
Fredricks of Regina...  Man you should have seen those salesgirls!

The main problem is Vargr charisma.  If the human doesn\'t have sufficient
charisma the Vargr just won\'t be interested.  And the conversions of
human characteristics to Vargr charsima is quite low.  Thus I don\'t think
the Vargr will stay interested for long, if he/she manages to get interested
in the first place.

Actually, I have recieved permission from our glorious TML Admin guy to post
a story I\'ve been writing for a long time now.  (though I haven\'t touched it
in more than 6 months...)  The first chapter touches on this point.

Ooops come to think of it, I had a few of those players...  There was the
time the guys went into a \'cat house\' with an Aslan...

    'body' => 'As a Traveller player since second ed. High Guard (1980), I have been
watching the current discussion over the future of the game and the new
"StarViking" supplement being planned, whatever that might be exactly.
What concerns me is that this will just be a repeat of what happened with
the release of MegaTraveller -- a lot of new rule books and very few 
adventures or useful supplements.

GDW, in the past, has done a good job at releasing rules books.  There may
be ways in which people aren\'t entirely satisfied with them, but they are
available.  What concerns me is that GDW has been less able to release
adventures and information.  They aren\'t going to keep hooking me with new
rules books, but they might convince me to buy adventures or background
books that fit the rules that I have purchased.

I am concerned that GDW is going to try to help Traveller sales by printing
another set of rules and not new adventures or information for referees.
One nice thing would be a complete atlas of Charted Space, with Library
Data essay boxes.  This would be very helpful for preparing campaigns.
I can imagine that the new rules might be released with a lot of hoopla,
and then are supported to the same minimal amount MegaTraveller has recieved.
The current Rebellion background is rich in possibilites which have not
been exploited.  Why can\'t it be given a fair chance?

What I don\'t understand is why StarViking can\'t work in the Imperium in
the near future.  There are plenty of regions which are already wracked
by raiders:  Corridor, the Zarushagar no-man\'s-land, Lishun.  The Diaspora
region is cut off from central control.  Old Expanses is ripe for becoming
an anti-Solomani privateering center, resisting the thinly-stretched and
overworked forces of the Occupation.  If the Gushemege sector falls, I
doubt any one faction could hold it or enforce the law there.  The Marches
had enough troubles during the 5FW.  Eventually, the factions may give
up to lick their wounds and warily patrol the boundaries that they have
staked out, leaving large portions of the former Imperium to go their
own way into anarchy.  Then they might hire some of the emergent "StarVikings"
to use as mercenaries in battles against their neighbors, to augment their
fleets...hey, this is starting to sound interesting....

You could have Vargr and human groups competing in Corridor and Lishun, and
in Corridor they could deal with relatively vital factions making attempts
to stop them on the fringes of the sector.  In the no-man\'s-land, raiders
might be found with equipment salvaged from the hulks of the great Imperial
ships of the line destroyed in the continual conflict, and renegades from
both sides of the war.  In Old Expanses, freedom fighters play a trickier
game, as they don\'t know what worlds they can trust, worlds try to
surreptitiously supply them or ferry equipment from outisde the Occupied
Region, and Solomani commodores with too few ships and limited resources
attempt to deal with the problem under mounting pressure from Home.  To
liven things up, every so often, somebody makes a move against a neighboring
government, on scales from the interplanetary to the intersector.

Meanwhile, other regions are stable enough that one hardly knows the
Imperium has fallen.  Deneb -- the light behind the claw.  Vland and
Antares -- an uneasy peace.  Delphi and Daibei -- threatened on several
fronts, but hanging on.  Core and Ilelish -- waiting and watching for the
next blow.

I don\'t think this would require any Computer "Virus" or any major changes
beyond an advancement of a few years.  This could be a game that I might
play.  But it would need to be supported and maintained.  I am not against
a rules revision -- in fact, there are some things that it would be nice to
see changed.  But I am afraid that it might lead to the continued neglect
of Adventures and background supplements, which I would think would sell
better once players are established, as many players of Traveller are.

Trav III

I have NO idea how Twilight2 works.
>From what I hear, a person with no expertiese has zero
chance of success at anything.  Doesn\'t sound good to me.

On the positive side, somebody thinks Twilight2 works.  After all,
it is being bought.  How does this help us?  Well, maybe some of the
Twilight, DC, C&D game crowd will learn to play Trav if it is compatible
with the above.  If Trav\'s audience increases, maybe they will start
making more Trav stuff. I can see the benefits of having a common system.

But on the other hand, I don\'t like having to subsitute a system in that
is known to have problems where previously those did not exist.  Still,
I can live with it. (I can always come up with my own rules on how to
perform tasks)

Character generation.
On the experience stuff.  It sounds like a character is going to have
to have a high level of skill in order to perform well.  Can anybody tell
me how long it takes (in character generation years) for a character to
learn how to get that level of skill?

I think we need to compare skill level and performance against how long
it takes to learn that skill.

How long would a twilight character have to spend in medical school to
become a doctor?  An average person takes a few years (after college)
in trav (assuming 1 level per year increase) that\'s 3 years.

An average person can get a private pilot\'s license in 6 months of hard
work.  How long before a twilight character can take off, communicate,
navigate, land?  (in traveller I assume that a pilot-1 can do all these
things)

Now about combat.  I don\'t know about you, but I would guess that it
takes a lot less time to learn a skill like rifle-3, than it takes to
learn a skill like medic-3.  (physics-3?!)  I have only fired a fire
arm ONCE.  (can you say zero level?)  The one occasion I did, it was
pretty dark, but I managed to hit the target with the one round from
a 22 target pistol.  (This to my mind does not indicate a 0% chance of
success for 0 level)  (BTW, my dex is in the range of 2!)

Ship Design:
I agree with the people who are saying that there should be a basic set
that anyone can take and run with.  Buy one box which contains sufficient
stuff to play.  Maybe include an intro adventure?  Somthing like the old
Deluxe Traveller set or the Traveller Book.

Ok, In the basic set I think there should be some ship design stuff.
A simplified system that can produce simple ships.  This system doesn\'t
have to be able to produce battleships, cruisers etc.  just normal
ships that players are more likely to deal with.  The basic set doesn\'t
require spinal mounts, screens, armor...

There are lots of ways that ship design can be simplified for ships
like these.  You can eliminate rules dealing with armor, spinal mounts
screens, globes, TL-17+ systems and TL-8 and below.  Just concentrate on
the ships the players are likely to meet up with.  The rest can be delt
with in a more advanced suppliment.

The Suppliment can then deal with all those things left out of the basic
set.  It could potentially more detailed than the current MegaTrav
system which tries to balance simplicity with completeness.  If 2 systems
existed, one could get down to designing REAL systems.  I envision the
advanced suppliment dealing with being able to design its own weapons,
and computer systems as I mentioned before.
(I hope, I hope, I hope, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, hint, hint, plead,
beg, cagole!)

Part of the difficulty people have with MegaTrav is the number of choices
being put in front of them.  The basic system could make use of standard
units.  A \'unit\' of sensors/commo/avionics (add up the
weight/volume/cost/power of active & passive EMS add in the radios, etc.)

Since military and civilian ships may have different requirements for
sensors and environments, you could have a Mil-grade sensor/commo/avionics
suite, and a civilian-grade sensor/commo/avionics suite.

A percentage of the hull could be set up for environment systems. (add up
the Basic Env/Basic LS/Extended LS/Grav Plates/Inertial Compensators)

I also am hoping that someone will give some thought as to the fuel
consumption of fusion reactors.  The Fission power plant is totally
unrealistic.  I strongly suggest that GDW look at some real nuclear
powered vessels.  For instance the USS Nautilus had a reactor that
had to be refueled every 2 YEARS.  If you use the MegaTrav fuel
consumption it would have burned up 90% of the mass of the ship in
that time.  The N.S. Savannah (world\'s first nuclear powered merchant ship)
had enough fuel to sail for 2 YEARS on 110 POUNDS of fuel.  (If any
one from GDW via GEnie is interested in this I will look up the exact
figures, but the article was something like 3 days sailing on a teaspoon of
fuel!)

Rob Dean and I chose to use the listed consumption of a nuclear reactor
as the fuel requirement per Year as opposed to per Hour.  If you compare
with the Savannah, that works out pretty close.  But if that is true,
then Fusion plants consume MUCH more fuel than they have any right to.
(Hint:  Fusion is supposed to be more effiecient than Fission!)  And
even when the Anti-matter pods come in at TL-17, Fission is Still more
fuel efficient with the modification.

But I have pointed this out in previous TML messages.

On Star Viking
The Imperium ALREADY has a long night on the history books.  Why do we
need another?  Couldn\'t Star Viking be set back in the original Long
Night?  If it is set in stone, I strongly suggest you consider the idea
of leaving the Domain as the shining hope of the Imperium.  (applause
to the person who came up with this idea originally!)

Adventures
I can\'t emphisize this enough.  You can do what ever you want with the
rules.  I can live with just about any garbage set of rules. But it
won\'t work unless you have some adventures to go with them!  You can
come up with a truely easy and realistic game system and still it won\'t
work unless you give the refs something to DO with it!

If the rules are set to make the Ref\'s job easy, the biggest thing that
makes his job easy is an adventure to run!  Managing rules is easy!  The
hard part is finding something to do with them!

Well, it\'s a big Universe, and there will probably be a whole spectrum
of moral/ethical opinions on it from world to world, from being burned

for the characters, and not get stuffy or upset about it. The primary
reason I tend to discourage such goings-on is because it usually arises
not out of good roleplaying, but out of a juvenile need on the part of
players to do something "dirty" with their characters. See my earlier
comment on male vs. female gay Traveller characters.

The Value of Compatibility with T:2000 and DC supplements:
   I reserve judgement on this, but would comment that I\'m not likely to take
advantage of such compatibility.
   If NeoTraveller is seperated _slightly_ from the Imperial universe, this
compatibility allows other types of SF to be run.  With the right "variant"
technology in the craft design system, and a brief bit of explanation, 2300AD
can "live" again within the NeoTraveller rules. Non-Imperial backgrounds need
not get any support from GDW beyond this, but the seeds would be there to
attract players of other games. Layers of Complexity:
   I think _I_ started this train of thought, but I would support it even if I
hadn\'t.  With basic craft design in the first release, and a "hullplate-by-
hullplate" approach in a later volume, the game keeps both beginners and naval
architects happy, provided the two systems produce compatible (if not
identical) results. Computers-from-scratch:
   I LIKE this idea, but it should probably be at the deepest layer of
complexity (with custom weapons).  It would require some pre-publication work,
however, to ensure that the types in the Basic Book were compatible with such
a system (and made sense without it).

On checking the new Craft Design system, Loren says:

 "Nobody else has volunteered....not in so many  words, anyway."

 Well, I\'ll admit that I didn\'t come right out and say so, but I am more than
slightly interested in checking and testing the new system.
 (Yes, I know you have to write it first. <grinning>)

   In fact, I just posted a message to Topic 4 that could lead (with
cooperation; HINT! HINT!) to better definitions for ship hull configurations. 
The idea is to produce a range of examples for each configuration, then derive
a more rigorous definition of the configuration from those examples.  Go look.

 "...the "virus thing" is real. Don\'t react until you hear the whole thing,

   You mean it isn\'t some crazed cyborg whose hearing is so sensitive that he
gets headaches from listening to Holocrystals operate, so he travels from
world to world and mesons HoloComputers from orbit?  Awww.
   But seriously, computer infiltration techniques have to keep up with
advances in technology and security, so a virus (even if it isn\'t 6\'5" and
Meson-armed  ;) is at least moderately acceptable.  But, as you say, I\'ll have
to have the whole story first.

  Subject: Traveller state of affairs

All,

I know that I\'ve been silent for a while, but my hard drive decided to play 
52 pickup with my files and I\'ve been repairing the damage all week. Now  for
comments on the matters at hand.

I also echo many, if not all, of the comment made here so far. But I tend  to
agree with Mike when he says that in the end, GDW can and will do what  it
feels is best for itself -- it is after all a business (that didn\'t come  out
quite right, did it).

As for specifics, I have a few statements. First off, DON\'T CHANGE THE  WORLD
BUILDING RULES!!!! This is a personal like of mine, but for the area  of
campaigning, the compact format seems ideal plus leaves options for  detail
ala WBH.

Character generation could be tweaked a little. Decoration rolls and  brownie
points kind of add a bit to a character\'s background. I also  thought that the
semi-randomness of choosing tables brought into the game  (from real life?)
the reality of having to learn a skill that you may never   use because your
employer said so. Perhaps adding a "add 1 to a skill you  already know at the
cost of two skill rolls" rule is appropriate? Also, Geo  Gelinas had a Tw2000
variant in an old issue of TTT.

Vehicle/Ship/etc construction shouldn\'t be changed too much so as to avoid  a
3-way Trav->MT->NeoT conversion problem. I like the idea of  computer/robot
brain construction rules.

As for the SIGs, since I had originally wanted to work on Robots & Cyborgs 
for DGP, I\'d be happy to be on the appropriate SIG.

Although not a writer, I plan on trying my darnedest to attend the 
conference, if/when it happens. My only problem is that I am in a  wheelchair
and even though I have a van and $$$, I do not drive. If it is  driving
distance from Lansing, MI, perhaps some from the East Coast flying  by could
land in MI and drive from here. Personally, a GEnie conference is  better for
me, but I certainly understand the need for face-to-face talks.

More comments as the situation warrants.

 Lester -
      I\'ll go along with the "virus thing".  It sounded like the
 invention of someone without a good grounding in the Traveller milieu.
 I now assume its not an arbitrary notion but the basis for the new
 setting and the way Diaspora gets its \'cyberpunk\' flavor.
                                                                   MIKE

189 Les:

  Les, thank you.  That post has almost turned me around on the revision. 
While I\'ve still got a lot of problems with choice of mechanics, your comments
show that there\'s been a lot more thought put into to it than it originally
seemed.

  Why do I have this funny feeling that the NT rules are going to be a lot
closer to Twilight _1st ed_ than the second?  A good thing, IMHO.

  The background is now making sense.  And I\'m liking it more and more...as
I\'ve mentioned before, I grew up reading H. Beam Piper, and Space Viking\'s one
of my favorite novels.  I\'m still not sure about the virus thing, but I\'m
willing to keep an open mind right now (is this one of the Manhatten Projects
the factions were workin on..?)

  The upshot is I\'m still not entirely convinced this is a good thing, but
you\'ve got me feeling a lot more postive towards it.

Thanks for the post, Mark. I can honestly say that the things we have  planned
for Traveller have me really excited, and that that excitement grows almost
daily as some new aspect of the plan emerges. No jive.

As much as possible, I\'d like to keep the developing plot changes secret so as
not to rob the thunder of the products they\'re planned to be  revealed in. If
I, or someone else from GDW gets kind of cagey about a  particular question in
the months to come, it\'s largely for that reason.

Yours, 

 Les

I will go on record with my personal desires on the "new" Traveller:

Ruleset: I would prefer a single basic rules package, ala the Traveller
Book or the original boxed set, with detailed add-on products.  The
detailed add-ons would include a Vehicles/Starship package (operation,
design, examples), and a World guide (extended generation, world
building and mapping, and imperial large-scale maps and local data).  I
feel this approach allows players to get started with the basic game,
then add details and extensions as desired.

Tasks: I prefer the MegaTraveller task system over all other
success/failure mechanisms I have used in the past, because it is an
easy concept to communicate and resolve situations with.

Personal Combat: I\'d like it kept brief, easy to play out,
unpredictable, usually incapacitating and often deadly.  Non-lethal
combat where the goal is incapacitating your opponent is important to
me.  If you haven\'t guessed, I don\'t rely on personal combat as a large
part of my Traveller games.

Adventures: A small adventure example in the basic ruleset would be
nice.  I like brewing my own adventures, so adventure support is not
critical to me and I tend to not purchase them.  However, I do enjoy
scanning adventure concepts and "Amber Zone" sorts of small adventures
to give me fresh ideas for plots, gimmicks, twists, and NPCs.

Characters: I prefer MegaTraveller basic character generation, and enjoy
the extended generation provided.  I like the character\'s unique
situation of being dragged into recieving some skills, but choosing
others.

Starship Construction: In the basic ruleset, I\'d like to see
off-the-shelf starship building, ala Classic Traveller Book 2.  I feel
that an in-depth fully-compatible detailed add-on, perhaps A MegaTrav
construction rehash, should be published in a seperate volume.

Starship Combat: I would prefer colorful, imaginative, and fun,
well-suited to small vessel combat, like the Classic book 2 System.  I
would like to see vector movement brought back too.  Large-scale combat
can be left to the extended starship package.

Vehicles: A brief basic common vehicle compendium ala Classic book 2 is
nice.  I think that a scout or merchant ship should have small but
complete deck plans in the basic set.  Detailed piles of extra designs,
etc. should reside in the detailed starship package.

Technology: I\'m not fussy about thrusters vs. fusion rockets.  I would
like to see good support for different technological paths; for example,
jump vs. stutterwarp vs. ramscoop, rockets (fusion, fission, chemical,
electric) vs. thrusters vs. light sails, etc.  These fringe concepts
need to be planned for in the basic ruleset, but can be expounded upon
in a detailed starship volume.  I\'d be happy for a default technology
(thrusters + jump drive) set of drive packages to be part of the basic
rulebook starship construction set.

Worlds: Leave UPPs and their generation as in MegaTraveller and DGP\'s
World Builder\'s Handbook.  This is a finely tuned imaginative system
allowing basic or detailed generation.

Trade and Commerce: I\'d like to see an amalgam of Classic and
MegaTraveller ideas, because the Classic system was colorful and had a
high variance in price/volume, and the MT system was comprehensive.

Index: an exhasutive compendium of planned for, plus out-of-print but
applicable Traveller materials, is somethings I\'d spend some money on.
Maybe an appendix to the basic rule set, with short paragraphs
(Adventure 1: Kinunir - 1980 (out of print) - short description).

Philosphy: refereeing and play philosophy is welcome in the basic set
(how to be a good referee/player, general plot ideas, etc).

Aliens: a general introduction to the alien races, their homes, and
proper character play is essential to the basic ruleset, as the aliens
and Imperium history set the flavor of Traveller.

Artwork: excellent for visualizing the flavor of the universe, as well
as providing a mental map for concepts and rules organization.

Gee, I was speaking as a real computer scientist.  Sorry to be so
sarcastic, but your article has a attitude problem. I\'ll grant that
the idea of a virus that could do what was described falls totally in the
realm of science fiction, but being allowed to make any pre-assumptions
you choose how would you make the Traveller universe stop?  Frank thought
that computers were the way to go and I made some suggestions.   If you
don\'t think it will work then present something better in this forum with
the same effects.  Personally my choice of attack would be the jump
drives, but I don\'t know the physics to figure out how to do it.

The program is transimitted machine to machine similarly to computer virus.
It is the part of the computer it attacks that is different.  Rather than
atacking memory it destroies the CPU.  There is a big assumption that the
existing viral safeguards could be circumvented which would be no easy
task.  My assuption was that this would be feasable because those programs
were guarding against memory assaults.  Hey this is a big gimme, but then
so is most science fiction.  At any rate, the lag time before the program
takes effect is similar to a virus and is how it gets so widely dispersed.
CPU failure should look very small when the virus is first introduced but
increase exponetially as the virus takes effect.  "Seeding" production
facilities insures their shut down leading to the lack of replacement
CPUs.  All of this spirals with the social collapse causing lack of
transport to provide manufacturing materials and food for the people.

 As for regenerating technology in 5 years maybe, but you would starve to
death in under one.  Also who will pay you for those five years the
government is to busy surviving to care and most business went bankrupt in
the massive economic collapse.  Oh wait this is post recovery: where did
you go to school there\'s no such thing anymore as a university and how can
you read all those computer stored books without the computer?  Let me
make a wild but current analogy with our society. Let\'s assume that I run
the CIA (or something) and have found a virus that would turn oil into  
useless but corrosive sludge that would over a period of months destroy
the engines that use it.  I\'m crazy, my parents lived next to a tollway
and died of Carbon Monoxide poisioning (at least so I think) so stopping
all engines seems like a pretty good idea.  The virus lives in the tankers
(I seed), it lives in the factories (I seed), it lives in the gas tanks
and the build up will destroy the engine that burns it (not right away but
in a month or so).  How am I doing this I\'m sending operatives out with
kits to check for someone doing this to us and doing the test seeds the
oil/gas.  I told my reasearch team to go figure out a way to do this to
Iraq now that we have the virus and they came up with the kit.  Suddenly
tractors don\'t go farmers can\'t plant crops and the world starts to
starve.  Yeah they can switch to horses, but a farmer with a horse can
support far fewer people than one  with a tractor.  They know the problem,
they know the solution, but most of the internal cumbustion engines no
longer work.  Worse most of the planting didn\'t get done.  How do they get
the raw materials to the factory to make the new engines without them?
How do they get decide who gets fed (oh they could get by this year by
depleting seed stocks and breeding stock, but they would certainly starve
next year without seeds to plant or animals to breed)?   How do they get
the food they have to where the people are?
   Frank\'s assumption is that Traveller societies are pretty close to that
dependent on computers.  The fall is not from TL15 to TL6, but from TL15
to TL0 and then the problem is how far can the survivors come back. Also I
have always interpreted Traveller TLs as being the TL that a planet could
support on its own.  I could go one step further and even say it is what
the planet can support given the support it gets from other worlds.  How
many worlds do you think it takes to support a TL15 world?  I wouldn\'t
think most TL15 worlds are self-sufficient and if space travel is
interupted they will suffer economically.  For lower TLs it is almost
certain these planets import higher TL stuff to make their life easier and
are vulnerable through these imports.  Want an analogy I remember seeing a
program recently on the Amazon Basin Indians where they live extremely
primitive lives, but the chief still has a motorcycle to get around on and
most villagers now use bicycles.

>(4)  Do you really believe the "common architectural flaw"
>argument above?  If so, then answer these:  Do you believe that
>all TL7 bridges contain a common easily exploitable
>architectural flaw?
They do.  Use of Aluminium superstructures as shown in the Falklands.
We are currently in the process of changing them all back to steel.]

>Is this more or less likely than that all TL4 bridges did (HINT: think
>resonance)? 
They did.  That\'s why we made TL7 bridges with so much electronic garbage,
TL4 radios are so easy to jam once you know how.

>Is this a fair analogy?
>What other analogies of this sort might one draw
>(IDEAS: automobiles, electrical devices, plumbing)?
Haven\'t you noticed recalls of new ideas across auto corperations to fix
such flaws e.g. the change to timing belt rather than the timing chain
several years ago caused numerous engine failures which the manufacturers
paid for when they broke.  What about the Hinsdale fire several years ago
Mother\'s Day and its effect on telephones service for the entire Chicago
area.  Plumbing how about Legionare\'s disease and its relation to the
new vent system in the convention hotel.  We are vulnerable to disasters
the examples abover were just pulled off the top of my head.

>Do they lead to similar conclusions (SUGGESTED ANSWER: yes)?
Yes, you bet i.e. system normal all f***** up.  Flaws like this exist in
all human societies and most of what we produce.  The ability to exploit
them may well be in the realm of science fiction, but that\'s part of
Traveller isn\'t it.  We tend to be dependent on some bit of technology and
if it fails or we streach it too far, our society will fold up and go
away.  For the Mayans this was slash and burn agriculture vs population
pressures. For the Sumarians it was irregation vs salt buildup in fields.
For our current society it may be the internal cumbustion engine/pollution
/progress vs the atmosphere.

You get the same amount of support either way.  They get much more reuse
by just leaving things where they are.  So the decision is probably based
on keeping R&D costs to a minimum.  What I\'m trying to say is the impact
of the reuse of the Traveller universe is the same on you in either case.
For example, even if they put it in another part of the universe then you
won\'t see anymore updates for MT anyway so you will have to exist with
what you have and if they put in the existing universe then you will have
the same effect by ignoring it.  Where you choose to go with Traveller is
up to you, not up to GDW.  None of my Traveller running was ever done in
the Imperium or even the same universe by my choice and to avoid these
problems with not liking someone elses dicision about the game.  
Personally I agree with some of your statements above, I thought 2300 +
1000 or more years or putting it so far in Travellers future that MT is
unaffected might be an even better way to go.  But if for business 
reasons GDW has decided to drop support of MT then you have to make a
choice about whether or not you will continue your support or MT.  Its not
that bad of a decision either way you pick its just a matter of preference.

*One* computer designer?  You\'re basing this whole [deleted] concept on the

Give us a reason.

> We take Traveller seriously too.

Uh-huh.  Pull the other one.

WHEW!!  OK, now that I\'ve gotten that out of my system (for the moment),
let\'s look seriously at why a \'universal virus\' is unlikely to work.

Historically, computer viruses (or other forms of invasive, non-productive
computer code) are small, tightly constructed programs, written for a
specific SPU (sytem processor unit) instruction set, introduced into a
computer system through loopholes in the computers security.  Since the
attacking program is SPU specific, it can be arbitrarily small (in total
number of bytes), allowing it to take advantage of a broader variety of
digital transport mechanisms (E-mail, X.25 packets, LAN packets, etc.).
The larger the program, the harder it is to introduce into a system,
and the more likely it is to be detected.

Another characteristic of computer viruses (and I\'ll use the term \'virus\'
from now on to be any generic deliberately destuctive program) is that
they only damage software (date and other programs, including the operating
system).  Very little potential exists for a virus to actually damage
hardware (although a virus designed to take advantage of some specific
disk driver characteristic could cause head crashes by overworking the
read/write heads on the disk).  Therefore, even if the virus completely
destroyed a computers operating system, all it\'s programs, and all it\'s
data, the physical computer hardware would still be undamaged, just
waiting for it\'s storaged devices to be re-formated and re-loaded with
uncorrupted software.  BTW, what little potential currently exists for
malignant software to actually damage hardware will completely disappear
once all moving mechanical parts in a computer are eliminated.  Optical
and holographic digital storage techniques are bringing this state
closer to reality every day.  (Suggesting that software can \'attack\'
hardware, is like suggesting that water can attack a hose.  And before
anyone starts making noises about the electrical equivalent of \'extreme
water pressure\', I\'ll mention just two items: surge protectors and fuses.)

If a virus is to be effective on more than one type of processor, it would
have to incorporate multiple \'versions\' of itself in it\'s own instruction
space (the \'body\' of the virus), with each version written in a different
SPU instruction set, resulting in some versions being bigger than others.
So, if a virus is capable of attacking N different types of processors,
and the smallest version of itself is size M, then the *minimum* size for
the entire virus program is (M x N) + sizeof(the switching code).  What\'s
the switching code?  Well, the virus needs some way to determine which
version of itself to use for the attack, doesn\'t it?  This isn\'t a
trivial problem, so the \'switching code\' portion of the program will
also be fairly large.  Hmmm, this litle tiny virus is starting to assume
the dimensions of a dumptruck awfully fast.

For a virus to attack every computer architecture on good, old TL8 Earth,
it would need to be able to install itself on every different type of
processor architecture currently in use.  Even if we are generous and
assume that one version could attack a whole family of similar processors
(say, all Motorola M680xx processors, or all Intel x86 processors) the
virus would still need *hundreds* of different versions of itself (my
employer, Hewlett-Packard, alone uses almost a dozen different architectures
in it\'s computers, including Motorola, Intel, HP PA-RISC, and a number
of other proprietary designs).  Multiply that by all the different
CISC, RISC, and other proprietary processor vendors in the world (what
kind of virus would attack a Cray?), and you\'ve got one *HONKING* big
attack program.  And if you think just one planet is a big target, consider
the Imperium.  Worlds from TL6 to TL16, with lots of different computer
designs to go with each TL.  Also, who\'s to say the processor architectures
on a TL10 world in the Marches look *anything* like the designs on a
different TL10 world rimward of Terra? This virus starting to look less
like a virus and more like a planetary-wide database! :-)  (BTW, I know
there are Imperial worlds with TL\'s below 6, but they won\'t have any
sort of computer techology to attack, will they?)

Now, just for the sake of argument, let\'s and say that some software genius
discovered a way to make a digital \'palimpsest\' (look it up), so that the
virus can remain small and still be capable of attacking all known processor
architectures.  Quite a stretch, but let\'s be generous.  What does this
leave us?  It leaves us millions of computers with totally corrupted (or
erased) software, and *totally* undamaged hardware!  Let\'s also ignore
the fact that any big entity (MegaCorp, government, or military structure)
is going to have software back-ups going back *decades* at least.  For
example, virtually software R&D facility within Hewlett-Packard maintains
what are call \'PANIC\' disks, just in case a system crashes.  If this
happens, you just lug the PANIC disk over the your dead computer, hook
it up, re-boot, and clean up the trashed system disk.  Since the PANIC
disk itself is never written to during this process (just read from),
it doesn\'t ever get corrupted and can be used over and over again.

So, we\'ve got all this undamaged, but empty computer hardward, with no
safe software to load onto it.  Does civilization fall?  Maybe?  Does
it stay fallen?  Probably for no longer than a year or so, max.  You
see, the concept of computer science won\'t have died with the operating
systems.  There\'ll still be a lot of source code around that can be
checked for bugs *before* it\'s compiled and run.  No compilers, you say?
a decent team of compiler writers could toggle a brand-new compiler
into a computer via the front panel in a month or less.  The first
compiler doesn\'t have to be very smart or efficient.  Follow-on versions
will be.  An operating system would be necessary before that, but a
simple, dumb OS could be reintroduced into a computer by the same
method and in not much more time.  (Look the concept of a boot-strap
compiler, if you\'re interested.  These exist for virtually every known
processor architecture in existance, and are small enough to hand check
for bugs, byte by byte, before they are ever even loading onto a system.
Most UN*X SPUs also allow you to run init mode from the ITE.  Since this
is a primitive OS, built right onto the mother board, it is immune to
any sort of software corruption.)

The result is that even if one virus trashed the entire Imperium from
end to end, the worlds hit early on would be back up and running before
the virus even made it to the far end of known space, at jump-6!

.... And *THAT\'S* why the whole idea is too bogus to even consider without
laughing.

[ As a total aside, the only virus I can conceive of that would do the
  job GDW *wants* theirs to do, would be a real, *organic* virus that
  has an appetite for doped Gallium-Arsenide (or the TL15 equivalent),
  ala the \'Andromeda Strain\'.  Now *that* would not only be nasty, but
  also almost, *almost* believable. ]

If GDW *really* wants to re-introduce the Long Night into the Traveller
universe, would somebody *PLEASE* upload Steve Bonnevilles\' TML posting
No. 3181 to GEnie.  *THAT\'S* the way to do the job.  Way to go, Steve!!

     You know, that\'s right (at least, it was when I read this the first
time; several people have volunteered in the interim).  In that case,
let me be the Nth to volunteer to help in any way I can.  Playtesting,
certainly (I can also offer the able help of my roommate, who\'s been a
gamer since 1972), as well as my professional opinion (though that\'s not
as important--the TML enjoys an embarassment of riches when it comes to
my profession--I\'m a programmer).  At one time, though, I was an
avionics engineer in the employ of the US Navy (guided ordnance, as it
happens), experience that might come in handy...


 >Maybe we should start a TML list for anyone who would like to be involved,
 >including phone numbers and postal addresses.

     That works for me.  My address and phone number (as always) is in
my signature.


     But, enough of this (you\'d think that my military experience would
have taught me not to volunteer, but noooo... ;-) ).  I have another
suggestion.

     I\'ve been thinking about this for a while, and I\'ve decided that I
really like the Shattered Imperium as a background.  If the new milieu
is supposed to be 80 years in the future of the current timeline (hmm...
does that make it "Traveller:  The Next Generation?"  Sorry, I digress),
would it be possible to keep up with the events in the Rebellion as
well?  I\'m not asking for any new products (though I wouldn\'t refuse
them ;-) ), just a little event-line detail, ala the Traveller News
Service (another benefit of membership in the Travellers\' Aid Society).

     Ideally, this should come from one source, in order to keep things
as consistent as possible.  If the people at GDW and DGP don\'t want to
do it, perhaps another source could be found (I\'m not volunteering--I\'ve
used up my quota for today ;-) ).

     I\'d just like to see the current environment retain some life.
Of course, I could just continue to use it in my games, but I\'d also
like to think that it hasn\'t been totally abandoned.


     Another thing I\'d like to see is a result that bears enough
resemblance to the previous editions that I can hybridize it without
too much trouble (that\'s what I did with Classic Traveller and
MegaTraveller--mixed and matched until I had a result I could work
with).  However, that\'s just my personal desire...  ;-)

     I was fortunae enough to walk into my favorite gaming store (in
Indianapolis, there are two) on the same day it arrived, so I had my
copy in my hands last Friday.  I\'ve read about half of the Solomani
section so far, and skimmed the Aslan section, and it certainly
stands up to the high standards that I\'ve come to expect from DGP.
Wow, Aslan deck plans...  ;-)

     It does lead to a question, though, in view of the impending
changes in the Traveller universe.  In the introduction, the next
three volumes in the MegaTraveller Alien series are named.

     Will these books be published?  Will DGP divert all its resources
away from MegaTraveller and leave this series hanging?

     Personally, I hope not, since I want to have the entire series.
These books are so good that they\'re worth buying just to *read*, let
alone use in gaming.  That\'s just my opinion, of course, but that was
what I felt about the original three-book Traveller set and got me
started on this merry-go-round in the first place.  ;-)

 >Now I need to come up with a good nickname for it.....

     "Lamers and Lions?"  ;-)  Sorry, but I don\'t much like the
Solomani.  ;-)

    'body' => 'Well having read all the comments so far I thought I would add a few more,

First when MT came out I thought I would have a look at this, yeah I
like the idea of the Rebellion (Images of the Decline of the Roman empire came
to mind) and thought that this would be a good setting to bring some new
players into the realm of Traveller, and to get some bad habits out of other
players I know, now being (as he put it) the top, Top Gun pilot of the navy
demanding instance respect on any planet (he was also a baron), he had to watch
what he say how he acted towards others, in order not to get himself killed, he
was also used to belong to the "lets block that bullet with my body" group. MT
provided the lethal combat that I like (and as it should be) in order to
encourge players to think of interesting and different ways out of trouble.

        But as I read the errors were terrible and started to drive me crazy,
(I have to thank TML for providing me with access to the errata sheet as when I
first purchased MT roleplaying support in my home town was zero). So MT was
used just to provide characters and history, and this worked well. I am not
into designing ships but design planets and when the DGP produced the World
Builders handbook I loved it. Most adventures I did were planet based, with
space Traveller a small but still required part. As more supplements arrived I
purchased them and these all provided me with a better system to run my
adventures, I even purchased COACC, which I liked as a concept and it provided
more ideas, as a whole I liked MT and have put a lot of money it to it. The
task system is good, it what I had been using with the group I played with for
a long time but had never written down.

So if GDW are going to get me to spend money on the new version I would like to
see the following things (some of these have been mentioned by others, I am
just adding my weight to the course. I should just add that I have never played
TW:2000)

     (1) A simple basic rules set, in a boxed set (aka classic Traveller) or a
single book providing enough to sit down and play the game if you are a complete
begineer.  Simple starship construction rules, simple System construction rules
and character charaction should all be in these rules, easy to find and use.

     (2) Supplements for more detailed starships and systems should come later
in order not to swap the starting GM with rule upon rule for just background
details. It is my preference that supplements considering history on background
should contain few or no new rules but a coherent source book for provide
background and ideas for adventures.

     (3) Combat did not feature much in my adventures but what I used of the MT
combat I liked, it might not be the best (or the most realistic) but if you
start trying to get combat to be more like real life, most systems I have seen
fail as the rules expand and get more complex. I like my combat to fast and
deadly, just like a real life firefight. In most cases you don\'t know what has
happened until its over (Speak from experience in Cadet training corp)

     (4) The GDW should not destory the history of the Imperium, every thing
that has happen in the Imperium should still have happened, and be coherently
linked in with the next timeline. (A jump in time would not effect me greatly
as I am not currently running an andventure, and will not be for sometime to
come).

     (5) If possible the new system should allow a bit of backwards
compatabilty in order to allow me to use the rules I already have, don\'t change
the star system structure. I like it - IMHO it is the best method I have seen of
designing star systems I have seen in any SFRPG.

I hope this has provided some constructive comments and I will wait and see
what GDW brings out (but I am not holding my breath as I thinking about buying
a car and the insurance rates in Newcastle equal about 16 copies of the basic
MT set for just third party)

   Then you can answer the one question I had about it:
Did they follow the Vi&Va precedend and have both races present on the cover?
If so, did they find a situation for the cover art where an Aslan and a 
Solomani is in the same place and not obscured by the plasma-flashes? :)

Mark makes a very correct (if somewhat heated) treatise of why a "computer
virus" never could achieve the aims of GDW. This article reminds me of nothing
else than a physicist fuming about how a fusion gun (as in Trav/MT) could never
work, or how FTL violates relativity! Just as a conveniently disregards their
opinions, I would disregard Mark\'s.

As a computer scientist, I would be very careful about saying what could and
what could not be done at the TL 15-16-17 region. Going even higher in the TLs,
I just defines this as \'magic\', and who knows, maybe the perpetrator (the
Emperor?) has access to some fancy artifacts? Of cause, with \'magic\' anything
is possible.

About Neo-Traveller in general:

Actually, I\'m thrilled about the revision. I never liked MegaTraveller, and
have never bought a single MegaTraveller product (except Challenge). Frankly,
I hated the box art, and could never get in the mood for the very chaotic
Shattered Imperium. When the errata appeared on TML, I resolved to stay with
my classic set.

But from what I have read here on TML (forwarded from Genie), I think that
GDW is serious this time. But they DO need to do something about their proof-
reading department.

Hello,
 
        I, too, am one of those \'77 crowd. Actually - the \'77 Traveller
got to this misbegotten place in \'82... But, I got the books, finally and
played. I got the Mega-Traveller late, as usual, but played with that
some, too. Again - I am among the VERY few in Israel who uses non-TSR
rules... This is self-advertisement, please pardon me.
 
        The rule changes... Well - I would like to have a PROOFED vehicle
design system... I am not Rob Dean (i.e. I _AM_ like Rob Dean, but I have
less time) and have disigned only tens of vehicles, not hundreds... But,
in ANY game I have ever purchased, I first ran to the design system. Same
for weapon design.
 
        Combat should be quick and very deadly. I usually take a single
hit as incapacitating... So, I can fudge the rules if I need, but prefer
the rules to be ready made.
 
        World Generation? Well - WBH sounds very good, I have not seen it
yet. But I would like to see it come out at the same time as the major
alien races, atlases and so on.
 
        No galactic super computer virii, please.
 
        And, I hereby solemnly promise that I will NOT BUY Neo-Traveller
if it uses TWILIGHT/2000 SYSTEM.

I have uploaded a character generator for MEGATRAVELLER. It uses the Basic
Character Generation System. It is written for IBM PC and compatibles using
Borland Turbo Pascal. It\'s freeware and you can download it from sunbane
(129.100.100.12).

Some additions to the discussion about MEGATRAVELLER successor:

I like the MT system, but I see two major disadvantages:

1.) Get rid of the 6g max. maneuver drives. I don\'t like this restriction,
    especially because most of my starship designs have enough energy
    resources to get more acceleration.

2.) Try to create a 3D starmap system. I don\'t like the simple 2D Hex
    system used now. It is easy, but the average distances between the
    stars are to short.
   
A remark to the layout of the rulebooks:
    It is really hard to find an important point if you search for it.
    I think a register would help to find the rules you need.
    Suggested words:
    Weapons: list, price, availability
    Skills: Admin, Broker...

make a few comments as well.

Scrap the MT task system.  As someone pointed out, the only difference
between someone with INT 2 and someone with INT 15 is a DM of +3.  In
reality, the INT 2 person is going to have trouble figuring out how to
use a chair, never mind how to use a computer, while the INT 15 person
will not only write a program but probably redesign the computer.  Or,
using DEX instead of INT, a DEX 2 person will either have the gun the
wrong way round, or drop it before getting a finger near the trigger;
a DEX 15 person will draw the gun, fire a few shots, twirl it a few
times round the finger, and put it back in the holster.  This is what
a DM of +3 means?

Bring back the old tables of weapons, in which each type of weapon had
its own DEX modifiers associated with it.  "He\'s too clumsy to use a
rifle.  Give him a shotgun."  For melee weapons, substitute STR for DEX.

Space combat: I would favour a variant of the old Book 2 system, with
expanded damage tables.  Something like the High Guard damage tables,
but adjusted so that small ships can do more than shoot pieces off each
other\'s manoeuvre drives and fuel tanks.  In fact, the way I handled it
was to replace the standard DM of +6 for all non-spinal mount weapons
with a DM of +target USP size code, -weapon USP code, maximum of +6.

Background: forget the virus idea.  I support the suggestion that
someone else made, to the effect that if you want lower technology
and an anarchic galaxy, set the game in the time of the Long Night.
The concept of a computer virus wiping out the whole Imperium just
doesn\'t work for me.  For a start, as has been said, it would also
wipe out all interstellar travel.  At least, it would until the
Zhodani realised that this was the chance they had been waiting for,
and took over the whole Imperium, probably meeting the Solomani
somewhere in the middle.  Unless someone is going to try to convince
me that the virus also affects their computers, all that happens is
that all Imperial computers are scrapped, and replaced with Zhodani
or Solomani machines.  And that assumes that someone with INT > 7 has
not hit on the idea of buying computers from any other race that can
supply them, and selling them in large quantities to the Imperium.

    'body' => '        I\'ve been out of touch for a while, and haven\'t yet had the
time to wade thru the massive file of backlogged TMLs that accumulated over
the last 2 months, so forgive me if my comments don\'t quite hit the mark.
        It is my understanding that GDW, for whatever reason, wishes to
establish a Traveller milieu that is several TLs lower than the current
Hi-Stellar Imperial levels, a Long Night of sorts.   As a computer
scientist
who has cleaned more than one virus off of infected machines, I gritted
my teeth at the "Computer Virus" notion that has been mentioned, but
instead of dismissing it, my husband and I put our heads together to
come up with a plausible scenario for wrecking Hi-Stellar computers
around Known Space.  If you like it, use it; pass it along to GDW, they
might like it.
 
        This scenario is based on two assumptions:
        1) High Stellar computers have some important material that is not 
used at lower tech levels; perhaps a better superconductor that enables
faster
processing at a greater bandwidth or something.  This material is one of
the
boundaries of Hi-stellar technology; you must have Hi-Stellar technology to
fabricate it.
        2) It is possible to use nano-technology at Hi-stellar TLs, BUT
that
particular technology has been neglected by the Imperium for whatever
reason.  
(Other paths were developed for the likelier applications, as in tailored 
commensual organisms for medical applications, etc.  Use your imagination.)
 
        I have also assumed, based on Lester Smith\'s and other\'s comments, 
that whoever developed the "CPU Virus" had vast R&D resources to work with,

and sufficient resources to implement this scenario.
 
        Scenario: A nanomachine is developed with a two-stage program.  
 
        Stage 1 causes it to reproduce itself and spread itself across the 
Imperium and beyond.  The nanomachine is in the size range from bacterium 
to amoeba; it obtains material for reproducing itself by scavenging from 
its environment.  It has a self-limiting feature in its reproductive
program 
such that it will not reproduce when the local population density of
nanobugs 
is over a certain level -- this is to prevent it being prematurely detected
and eliminated on an Imperium-wide basis due to hardware failures from it 
scavenging excessively from the electronics.  The nanobug is attracted to,
and reproduces in electronic equipment and computers using the "hi-stellar
superconductor" (The material mentioned in Assumption #1, above).   Further
details are left to your imagination: the idea is that this nanobug is
spread
with Imperial electronic technology to every piece of electronics
contacting
it, over the next X years.
        State 2 kicks in after some number of years have passed,
predetermined 
by the designer of the nanobug, but long enough to allow the nanobug to
spread
across the Imperium and beyond.  In stage 2, the nanobugs aggressively
attach 
the "Hi-Stellar superconductor" wherever they come in contact with it, and 
breed explosively.  Any given infected computer will be destroyed in
minutes 
to days, depending on the intial level of infection (and I wouldn\'t bet on
it 
taking days...).  Hi-Stellar electronics cease to exist; the effects of
this 
have been adequately described by other posters.  
        Assumption 2 is necessary for two reasons: (1) nanotechnology has 
never been implied at any level in previous Traveller, MT, etc. material, 
except possibly by the Ancients, and yet it is a technology we (TL8) are 
starting to build the first primitive tools in, and (2) if it were common, 
there would be ways to detect and prevent this sort of thing from happening
in 
the first place.  The scenario depends on this sort of attack being totally

unexpected and unlooked for, which seems plausible given the implied lack
of 
nanotechnology use in the Imperium.
        If you don\'t want to permanently limit TL expansion to TL 13, tops,

you can assume that (1) there are alternatives to the "Hi-Stellar 
Superconductor" that weren\'t developed because it was better, cheaper, 
whatever, that could be developed during the Recovery, or you could assume 
that the nanobug itself uses the "Hi-Stellar Superconductor", and, tho 
programmed not to attack other nanobugs, depends on the stuff to duplicate 
itself -- eventually, it will all be locked up in other nanobugs, and the
bugs 
will just sit there until they wear out and "die", thus removing the threat

over time.  It could be a long time - how long does it take for a well 
designed nanomachine to wear out?  Or you can (3) use your imagination and 
come up with your own excuse for reviving Hi-Stellar, if desired.
 
        Credit where credit is due department: this scenario came out of 
trying to figure out how to make a version of Larry Niven\'s Superconductor 
Plague from Ringworld that could be programmed to start after a delay time
for 
spreading... Steve thought of the nanomachines.

Here are a few ideas/thoughts on Traveller III.  I would greatly appreciate
it if someone would pass this along to GDW via GEnie.

Semiconductors:
A few words about the next generation of semiconductors.  I worked for a
couple years on diamond growth techniques at the Naval Research Lab.

Problems with silicon:  Well, it does not perform very well under high
temperatures.  When the silicon gets too hot your computer will crash.

Now, powerful computers require a LOT of circuitry imprinted into them.
The larger the number of circuits, the more heat generated by them.
When it gets too hot, it will crash.  Some of the more powerful computers
today require extensive cooling (liquid nitrogen) to keep them operating.
The avionics of the F-15 must be cooled by passing the aircraft\'s fuel
over the circuits!  Silicon based sensors must be placed far from the
aircrafts engine heat in order to function.

So, in order to get a really powerful computer (model 3?  Model 4?) the
semiconductor used must be superior to silicon in regard to its heat
characteristics.

The next projected semiconductor is going to be silicon carbide.  I\'ll
guess Silcon Carbide is going to be the TL 9 semiconductor.  The have
already begun to get single crystal wafers of Silicon Carbide.

But, an even better semiconductor will be Diamond.  Right now all we can
manage is polycrystalline diamond wafers which are no good for computers,
but give it a few years (decades at the outside) and single crystal
diamond wafers will be available.  (Say at TL 10)

Diamond (doped with boron) is an EXCELLENT semiconductor.  Durable, able
to withstand high temperatures and still keep functioning, radiation hard,
and on some scales of semiconductor quality I have seen is THREE orders of
magnatude superior to silicon.

Ok, so now we have a \'BUG\' (virus?  Nanobug?) that attacks CPUs.  Well,
I gather it doesn\'t destroy software, but somehow physically damages the
CPU of a computer.  Well, let me tell you diamond is pretty hard to damage.
There have been tests conducted with diamond circuits (yes they have been
made already on good old TL8 Earth)  For instance, a transistor circuit
printed onto a diamond.  They put an Acytelene torch on it!  And in the
middle of the flames it still worked very nicely.

This CPU \'BUG\' is going to have to damage a circuit like that.

A more likely senerio is that rather than attack the chip of the CPU, this
\'BUG\' would try to attack the connections of the chip.  They would probably
be more vulnerable than the chip itself, disconnect the chip and you have
destroyed the CPU.

But!  If his \'BUG\' attacks the basic wirings of the chip, it will be
attacking all the wirings of the computer system.  That means that all
wiring of all electronic devices is going to be subject to attack.  Thus
it would not only wipe out all computer CPUs but every other electronic
device extent.

No maneuver drives, no jump drives (even if they had a computer capable of
guiding them, they would still be dead), no fusion reactors, no lasers,
no gauss rifles, no plasma guns, no ACRs, not even combat armor and battle
dress with horns on it, nothing left for the good old Star Vikings to play
with.

Computers in Traveller:
I keep mentioning this, but I really think that a revision of Trav needs
to define what the computers are, and what they can do.  This is why I feel
a computer design system (from the ground up) will help enourmously.  I
have seen people asking the same questions about Traveller computers since
it came out.  So, I\'m not the only one who has some confusion on the subject.

A question I have often seen asked is \'What is all the volume taken up by
the computer?\'  Some maintain that it is work station volume, but given the
fact that we are now taking control panels and holotanks into account, this
is obviously not true.  After all, a grav speeder is not going to have
room for a work station.  Furthermore, multiple computer installations would
not increase the demand for a computer work station volume.

On the other hand, a TL 11 hand computer Which is equivalent in power to a
model one takes up considerably less volume than a normal model 1 computer
and costs FAR less.  But the TL 8 and TL 15 model 1 computers take up the
same volume.

Computer Power:
Another frequently asked question is \'How powerful is this computer?\'
There is no clear answer to this question.  For years, I used the guideline
that the computer listed was the most powerful computer that could be built
at its tech level of introduction.  Thus the most powerful computer at TL 8
(model 2/bis) would have the equivalent computer power of a Cray
supercomputer.  (That sound about right to you folks?)

Now if you look at the model 2/bis, it doesn\'t do a heck of a lot for you in
combat.  I think having a Cray as part of your gunsight or radar installation
would get you much better results than the old model 2/bis.

On the other hand, lets look at the old Model 1.  It is first introduced at
Tech Level 5 (World War 1 computer?).  At that low tech level, it is 100
times larger and costs 100 times as much as it does at TL 8, but it\'s there.
Well, the old mechanical computers didn\'t have a whole lot of power.  I
would bet the scientific calculator I carry in my briefcase could easily
outperform it.

Now, lets look at what a model 1 can do in Traveller.  Well, it can control
a one parsec jump!  (On the other hand, we don\'t know an awful lot about
interstellar jumps, maybe the math isn\'t so hard...)  That\'s not a very
good indicator of it\'s power.  What else can it do?  Well, according to
GDW\'s adventure \'Knightfall\', the ship\'s model 1 computer, can TALK!  Hmm!
Well that makes it more powerful than my calculator.  And I never heard of
a computer built during the early part of the century that could talk!
Some of it could be explained by the fact that the ship\'s computer is
TL 15, and not 5, and advances in programming techniques will certainly
advance by then.  But if a TL 15 model 1 is more powerful than a TL 5
model 1, then why do they give the same performance bonuses?
Wierd, Wierd, Wierd...

Maybe someone else uses a different guideline to come up with an idea of
how powerful these computers are?  If so, please let me know.  Help!
Metlay?  Rob?  Anybody?

You see the ambiguities here?  These are things that needs to be cleared
up for first time gamers trying to understand.  Heck!  I\'ve been playing
Trav for years and I don\'t know the answers!

Thus, I think a new revision of Traveller really needs to address this.
I think a computer design system would give people a MUCH better idea
of what we are dealing with here.  If nothing else it would define just
what a computer can and can not do.

Lester,

    RE: bell-curves & modifiers - the fact that a +1 doesn\'t mean as much to a
high-skill character as it does to a low-skill character is one of the great
ADVANTAGES of the 2d6 vs 1dX system.  Law of diminishing returns, and all
that.  If you\'re good at something, an improvement of 5% isn\'t nearly as
noticeable as it is when you\'re bad at it.
    Auto success is also a concept that should be avoided, if possible: there
are some things that someone who isn\'t sufficiently skilled simply cannot do.
Luck\'s great, but there are times when it\'s not enough.  Somebody with a skill
level of 1 should not be as able to perform Very Difficult tasks as someone
who has a skill level of 4, but under the current proposal that\'s the way it
would work.
    What types of dice are we talking here?  One of the things that I always
(after encountering D&D) liked about Traveller was that it didn\'t make you
carry a whole pile of dice around with you.  4 six-siders were usually
sufficient.  Now we\'re talking d20\'s, d100\'s, probably some d6\'s, etc.

    RE: Virus - This idea is, still, unnecessary and a cause of great
heartburn for those of us who make our livings using computers.  If you were
somehow determined to destroy the computers of the Imperium from the inside
you\'d have to start working 100+ years in advance, and you\'d have absolutely
no guarantee of even moderate success.  The job\'s simply too big.  The worst
part of this thing is that it isn\'t necessary to do the job, and has the nasty
effect of making things look all to much like T2K v1.

    RE: Intimidation - Truth.  If this bunch is intimidated, we\'d really be
bad off on our own.  I can see how someone with a project on the bubble,
though, might be a little bit circumspect.


Mark,

    RE: Stat ranges - Actually, for certain races, stats went as high as 20
(Virushi Str & Dex).


Kevin,

    RE: Task level names - Good point.  Average can easily be misconstrued,
and probably shouldn\'t be used here.

 Les -
      <In T2K and D-Con, things never really get better, I suppose. Or
 more accurately, the PCs can make things better, but they can never
 really FIX the way the world is. In Traveller, on the other hand, the
 Star Viking era is just one part of the overall history.>
      But there\'s no real difference here.  In T2K, things also get
 better, at least by 2300. I think of Neo-Traveller as \'dark future\' in
 that its set in a future setting where the history is pretty bad for
 at least the span of a typical adventuring career.
      <We have already sketched out a time line reaching beyond that
 era and into the future--a time line that will keep us extremely busy
 with adventures, sourcebooks, and novels>
      A word of caution: In talking with Traveller players, a lot were
 excited by the Rebellion and the glorious conflict among Lucan,
 Dulinor, Margaret, and so on.  They were disappointed to realize that
 the activities of their characters had no influence on the outcome.  A
 lot of this probably stems from REBELLION SOURCEBOOK.
      I\'m not sure if gamers really want a dynamic setting, dynamic in
 that major events are controlled by the game company, changing the
 background under them whether they like it or not.  Under classic
 Traveller, things weren\'t that way.  Sure, the Fifth Frontier War came
 rolling in.  But it rolled by out again leaving things largely
 unchanged.  It was actually useful in that the ref could tie a lot of
 things he invents to the recent war, and do so at his leasure.
      So, I think this would be a good thing -- a largely static
 setting beset upon by temporary conditions that could have a large or
 small effect on a campaign depending on the referee.
      Parallelling the AD&D product line might not be a bad idea.
 Novels could involve these \'temporary conditions\', giving color to
 worlds and subsectors.  Adventures and subsector sourcebooks could
 then provide game related details to what the novels covered, and fill
 in other things for parallel adventuring.
                                                                   MIKE

Regarding the virus:

  All else aside, it\'s not that unreasonable for such a thing to be  CAPABLE
of affecting most computers within the Imperium. Remember,  Challenge #54
mentions standardized IDP\'s for weapons, etc., so I\'d  expect that computer
architecture is also standardized. 
  Now, if it affected ALIEN computers I\'d think it was stupid...
  (Note that this does not mean that I approve, just that varying 
architecture is not likely to be a problem within the Imperium.)

    <Bertil> Glad you got my late return letter and glad to hear from you.
Right now I\'m hoping that GEnie adds an Internet Email link if things work out
okay.

    <Couple this with the fact that new system characters tend to consolidate
their skill points, rather than dispersing them quite as much> Yes, but some
of us like that wide dispersal of skills.

      <3) Having generated several T2K2 and DC characters, I question the
likelihood of them having many skills at level 8. Look at  Dara Schwartz in
DC, or both sample characters in T2K2. I see a  lot of 2\'s, 3\'s and 4\'s, but
not many 8\'s. (OK, ONE 7). The other sample character in DC has a few high
skill levels, but is a  total klutz outside of Empathy related skills. Are you
sure that  we won\'t get a universe of bumbling fools, especially now that 
sucess chances have been reduced still further?> Having created one of those
characters I somewhat agree, though perhaps if I had just concentrated on 2 or
three areas I would have been better off :)  (If I were GMing DC my first
official rule change would be doubling the skill points given per term)
    James King I believe had a review of DC in which he stated something about
GDW\'s 50-year old characters (to paraphrase very loosely).
    Of course that one of the reasons, I like going over to DC/T2K character
generation (it\'s easier to increase the skill points).
    <Due to Les\' recent comments, I have to say that my opinions of the
revision are radically changing.  A lot of my fears have been have been
soothed and I\'m actually feeling that this will be something positive and
worth waiting for, instead of an inevitable to be dreaded and lived with.> It
sounds good, but does it look good? Still waiting to see.............


DEFINITION:
    Computer Design Scientist: A person who specializes in the ART of
designing computers.


 <As for the Computer Virus associated with Star Viking, I have talked to
 Frank and it will not be a computer virus as we currently think of the the
 term.  (Although I will confess that that was his first thought).  Rather
 it will be a program that takes advantage of a rather universal current
 architecture flaw and attacks computers in such a way that main processor
 replacement is required.  There is an assumption that computer production
 is controlled by other computers which are vulnerable to attack.  I also
 felt it was important that the failure be masked initially as a straight
 production problem/flaw to allow the virus to spread.  It is the
 combination of massive loss of main processors along with production 
 shutdown caused by the loss of main processors (I love catch-22s) that
 causes the long night.  Note that since the person initiating the virus is
 the Emperor it could be dispersed by him from several key manufacturing
 facilities as part of a technological innovation given free to
 manufactures or at least something along those lines.> I presume a better
concept has since come to mind? This idea really bites the big one.

<The program is transmitted machine to machine similarly to computer virus.
 It is the part of the computer it attacks that is different.  Rather than
 atacking memory it destroys the CPU.  There is a big assumption that the
 existing viral safeguards could be circumvented which would be no easy
 task.  My assumption was that this would be feasable because those programs
 were guarding against memory assaults.  Hey this is a big gimme, but then
 so is most science fiction.  At any rate, the lag time before the program
 takes effect is similar to a virus and is how it gets so widely dispersed.
 CPU failure should look very small when the virus is first introduced but
 increase exponetially as the virus takes effect.  "Seeding" production
 facilities insures their shut down leading to the lack of replacement
 CPUs.  All of this spirals with the social collapse causing lack of
 transport to provide manufacturing materials and food for the people.>
    Oh goody goody, I\'m supposed to take my TL8 floppy disk and stick it in a
TL5 computer, and of course I\'m somehow supposed to also transfer this
material to a F-16 fighter at the same time. Please give me a break. And I
could have bleeploads of fun toggling this virus into my Altair or IMSAI 8080.

< Let\'s assume that I run
 the CIA (or something) and have found a virus that would turn oil into  
 useless but corrosive sludge that would over a period of months destroy
 the engines that use it.  I\'m crazy, my parents lived next to a tollway
 and died of Carbon Monoxide poisioning (at least so I think) so stopping
 all engines seems like a pretty good idea.  The virus lives in the tankers
 (I seed), it lives in the factories (I seed), it lives in the gas tanks
 and the build up will destroy the engine that burns it (not right away but
 in a month or so).  How am I doing this I\'m sending operatives out with
 kits to check for someone doing this to us and doing the test seeds the
 oil/gas.  I told my reasearch team to go figure out a way to do this to
 Iraq now that we have the virus and they came up with the kit.  Suddenly
 tractors don\'t go farmers can\'t plant crops and the world starts to
 starve.  Yeah they can switch to horses, but a farmer with a horse can
 support far fewer people than one  with a tractor.  They know the problem,
 they know the solution, but most of the internal cumbustion engines no
 longer work.  Worse most of the planting didn\'t get done.  How do they get
 the raw materials to the factory to make the new engines without them?
 How do they get decide who gets fed (oh they could get by this year by
 depleting seed stocks and breeding stock, but they would certainly starve
 next year without seeds to plant or animals to breed)?   How do they get
 the food they have to where the people are?>
    Guess I\'ll have to use those local LPG vehicles for one.....but than
admittedly gasoline has a bit less variety than CPUs. Admittedly, it would
probably be a tough couple of years as engines are rebuilt to use other fuel
sources. And if you want you could always use ethanol in the meantime also
(with associated problems).

    <Frank\'s assumption is that Traveller societies are pretty close to that
 dependent on computers.  The fall is not from TL15 to TL6, but from TL15
 to TL0 and then the problem is how far can the survivors come back. Also I
 have always interpreted Traveller TLs as being the TL that a planet could
 support on its own.  I could go one step further and even say it is what
 the planet can support given the support it gets from other worlds.  How
 many worlds do you think it takes to support a TL15 world?  I wouldn\'t
 think most TL15 worlds are self-sufficient and if space travel is
 interupted they will suffer economically.  For lower TLs it is almost
 certain these planets import higher TL stuff to make their life easier and
 are vulnerable through these imports.  Want an analogy I remember seeing a
 program recently on the Amazon Basin Indians where they live extremely
 primitive lives, but the chief still has a motorcycle to get around on and
 most villagers now use bicycles.>  This is interesting as ALL PREVIOUS
PRESUMPTIONS I\'ve seen indicate the reverse of that. And while Amazon  Indians
might use a motorcycle or bike, they don\'t necessarily die if they lose it. 
And not all worlds are TL15 either. If this level of trade is correct, the
Rebellion should have f__ked up trade so severely, that your virus would have
definite troubles traveling anywhere, let alone between factions. After all,
all the starport capacity went into constructing warships basically, and all
those merchant ships out there are limping along on old parts, those that
don\'t get shot-up anyway. Gee Whiz, guess I might been right about trade being
important, but even I never thought it was that important.

<[ As a total aside, the only virus I can conceive of that would do the
   job GDW *wants* theirs to do, would be a real, *organic* virus that
   has an appetite for doped Gallium-Arsenide (or the TL15 equivalent),
   ala the \'Andromeda Strain\'.  Now *that* would not only be nasty, but
   also almost, *almost* believable. ]> I was hoping you were using something
like this at least (those favorite little critters of Mike\'s), though this
still has the problems of what materials to eat.

<All else aside, it\'s not that unreasonable for such a thing to be  CAPABLE of
affecting most computers within the Imperium. Remember,  Challenge #54
mentions standardized IDP\'s for weapons, etc., so I\'d  expect that computer
architecture is also standardized. 
  Now, if it affected ALIEN computers I\'d think it was stupid...
  (Note that this does not mean that I approve, just that varying 
architecture is not likely to be a problem within the Imperium.)> Actually,
running a more homogenous type universe than most Traveller GM\'s, even I never
assumed this except in the different computers used aboard STARships, even
than I\'d have severe doubts thinking on it some more (while we don\'t have the
Mark XII standard processor we do have one that is configured to communicate
like one with your other processors, or lets watch a 680xx imitate an 80xxx
processor via code).

    Having played/worked on more variaties of computers in my first 7 years of
dealing with said (including a two year hiatus from the beasts), than most
have in 25 years (not my opinion). I have yet to find an easy way to transfer
information between the suckers. Plus I\'m still waiting for that paperless
office (all I\'ve seen is more ways of generating paper). Anyway, I\'m wondering
what all those practice hacker runs and maintenance cycles are for (yes, there
are companies out there that hire companies to break into their computers, and
some companies even run weekly and monthly maintenance checks on their
equipment).

    And no this is not a very good rebuttal, but than computer design is not
my specialty, I just try to keep up with all their different arguments of what
design is best. I guess once they make this a science we won\'t have to worry
about that problem, will we?

    I actually too pissed to bother forming good rebuttals.

    Signed,
         Computer Artist (and don\'t tell me Programming is a science, only
some of the tools are).


P.S. IF YOU REALLY WANT A VIRUS, USE NANNIES. Of course the problem with this
is the years to cross the Imperium P.P.S. The other problem you have with the
virus is also the time it takes to cross the Imperium, and granted Emperors
are not necessarily intelligent, but why would his subordinates allow him to
sabotage their own computers (well, granted humans are dumb at times)?
P.P.P.S. Didn\'t someone say something about secrets not being secret once two
people knew about it (let alone more than 2). Let me see, the message goes
something like this to let\'s say only 200 worlds "Dear Admiral (or those
concerned), we want you to have all computer CPU manufacturing companies to
install defects in their structures so that we can destroy them."

P.P.P.P.S. Please feel free to ignore my comments, I can always feel free to
have the Rebellion be the cause of the Dark Night, or remember KISS (or
perhaps even Occam\'s Razor).

P.P.P.P.P.S.   And of course, what are all those other alien races gonna be
doing in the meantime (okay guys, the Imperium\'s fallen, now remember, we
can\'t open hostilities with them till they pick themselves back up again). I
presume you have something going on here too. I just hope it\'s more
intelligent than the proposed virus (not that viruses are intelligent you
understand, at least not under normal circumstances).

Kevin,

    RE: Virus & Standardized computers - The IN and Imperial bureaucracies
_MAY_ have semi-standardized systems (though not likely, look at the mess in
the US armed forces and agencies), and the big megacorps _MIGHT_, nobody else
will.  Why?  Because trade simply isn\'t that important in the Imperium, and
because each local world that has the population needed to produce these
beasts will do so themselves.  And when they do that, they\'ll introduce
various changes to any standard design (to take into account any special
circumstances) and pretty soon they have their own system.  After all, if they
were all producing the identical computer, then you\'d a) have no competition,
and b) have to pay license fees to somebody for the use of their design.  And
if it\'s old enough to be unlicensed, then it\'s probably not worth the bother
of producing.
    Trade in the Imperium has ALWAYS, from day 1, been said to be primarily
luxuries.  Yes, Ag worlds export agricultural products and In worlds export
finished (or partially finished) goods, but most worlds (excepting the low-pop
worlds) can survive just fine without imports.  They might have some rich
people\'s toys break down, and life might not be as pleasant as before, but it
certainly won\'t collapse.  I mean, look at the Long Night!  The collapse of
the Rule of Man didn\'t result in everyone suddenly going back to square one
and starting over.  Things just slowly crumbled, and the various planets
slowly lost contact.  Read Piper\'s _The Cosmic Computer_ and _Space Viking_
for a very good explanation of what happens.
    Even if you use the "eater" concept of a virus, most of the big-ship
computers that you really want to get are going to be at least partially
optical.  Now, this is a problem, because now you need something that eats
glass.  It\'s doable, but it will leave the normal computers alone.  And just
how are you getting all of these things into position?  And what about those
Hiver computers the IN\'s been buying.......


                   Scott

P.S.  This isn\'t to say that Star Vikings doesn\'t interest me, because it
does.  All I\'m saying is come up with a better way to explain it.  Anyway, the
way\'s already sitting there looking at you: the Rebellion.

      Wooh.  Its really hard to digest all this.

      Bertil Jonell: "My personal suggestion would be to let people who
 know as little as possible about the game do the proofreading and
 playtesting."
      I really like this idea.  Joe Fugate has mentioned on occasion
 that Traveller writers tend to write from the perspective of familiar-
 ity.  While I agree there\'s no point in trying to draw in entry level
 players, Traveller needs to attract established players from other
 game systems.
      Bertil\'s suggestion sounds like a great idea to catch slip-ups.
 To this end, I\'d like to offer the Washington Metropolitan Area
 Gaming Society (WMAGS).  They sponsored the lion\'s share of RP
 tournaments at Origins \'91.  They already do official playtesting for
 other companies, something the organization wants to do much more of.
 They\'d love an opportunity to assemble groups for Neo-Traveller
 playtesting.

      Steven Bonneville: "You could have Vargr and human groups
 competing in Corridor and Lishun, and in Corridor they could deal with
 relatively vital factions making attempts to stop them on the fringes
 of the sector."
      Steven does have a point.  Why does the new setting have to
 involve all of Imperial space?  Like TRILLION CREDIT SQUADRON,
 narrowing the scope to a single sector or smaller sounds like an
 attractive option.
      Under classic Traveller, all GDW did was the Spinward Marches
 till later.  We had the wall map that showed where the rest of the
 Imperium was and the other interstellar states.  But we didn\'t really
 know much about all that, and it didn\'t really matter.  (I loved
 Traveller Digest\'s sector series and the expanded scope brought by
 the Rebellion.  But I think it got the game into a lot of trouble.)
      The same could be done with Diaspora or some other sector.
 Here, things are pretty bad right now.  Elsewhere, who knows?  Let
 a licensee work that out.  But here be the setting for STAR VIKING
 and Neo-Traveller, and this is what the products for the next year or
 two will support.

      Computer Virus:  Whether DV be plausible or implausible by
 today\'s understanding, keep in mind that Traveller does incorporate a
 number of gimmes.  One of these is that simple wetware can create a
 spectrum of psionic effects.  Swallow that, and DV isn\'t so far
 fetched.  (I bet I just opened another nasty can of worms.)
                                                                   MIKE

 Also, I really DID want this to be a place to say what you wanted to
 see in the new revision... If you can\'t edit out some of the more offensive
 messages to post elsewhere I would appreciate the entire batch going
 elsewhere. Most of the stuff seems okay but some of the messages aren\'t
 very constructive at all.

 As long as I\'m on the subject of these messages - I would be really
 curious to find out a few things about the people who DON\'T want
 the T2K 2nd ed. rules type system: A) Have they ever used it, read it,
 or know anything FIRST HAND about it. B) Do they use the MT task system
 (most of the people have said yea or nay on that subject but I am 
 curious about the others).

Re: Smaller chunks...

The last was about the smallest that will come through.  What\'s the difference
between one large message and 20 smaller ones???  Seems to me one larger one
is preferable.

Re: Posting elsewhere and Editing...

1)  I will _not_ edit the posts.  They are a service to the GEnie, the TML
members, and GDW, and (I thought) DGP to see their customers\' reactions.  I do
edit non- NeoTraveller articles out of the TML but I will not edit the basic
article.  Nor do I necessarily read the articles prior to post.

2)  Since this isn\'t a _one_ person show, how many others want the TML stuff
stopped??  How many want it to stay for the time being? Be aware that the
appropriate articles are showing up on TML (without editing I might add).

At least the efforts of Rob and I are appreciated on the TML.

Heck, since DGP is discontinuing Traveller support, why is this topic so
worrisome to DGP?

Mike,
    <CPU\'s creating psionic effects> Granted, but I don\'t think so at the TL\'s
available, in any case you still have a dispersal problem (for the area they
want to cover).
    Though you could say it was an Ancient discovery ala Black Globes.

Jay,
    Well, sometimes offensive things need to be said, just so long as they
don\'t get too personal (though I would say the Computer designer is taking a
bit of flak for his idea, and well, all I can say is that the idea stinks,
it\'s too complicated, when there are simpler solutions).
    Anyway this area seems to be just as much for what people want to see as
well as what they don\'t want to see.

    T2K, read parts of it, used it never, played it never. But than I don\'t
like the concept, anymore than I did Aftermath\'s (though with some alteration
I could probably survive it).
    DC, read it, have not really used it yet, played it once. For a horror
type RPG I love it, for an RPG in general, I\'m still undecided, though I\'ll
probably like it. I know the first thing I\'d do if I used it would be to
increase the skill points available by double.

All,
    I think we all can settle on some points from the discussion/arguments so
far:
    1st:  No virus, let the rebellion be the cause.
    2nd:  Light behind the claw (spinward marches stay roughly intact).
    3rd:  No errata (i.e. probably no more than one pages worth at least,
            people make mistakes, the idea is to make only a few and not
            to rush things).
    4th:  A complete set of vehicle building rules, with perhaps a fast
          system for just starships(?) in the main rules (possibly ships
          under either 5ktons or 1ktons in size).
    5th:  MTA\'s and WBH still available.

    (Care to vote on it?)

   I KNEW that I should have typed that message about computers offline - I\'m
always a bit rushed when I don\'t.

   Anyway, about IDP\'s (from Challenge #54, p. 54):
   "Sorku\'s comments refer to the widespread adherence to  Imperial Data
Package designs as the standard for widely used  designs of weapons, vehicles,
and heavy equipment.
   "While use of IDP designs has never been required or urged by the Imperium,
most member-systems have used these data packages  as blueprints for the
production of crucial systems.
   "In addition to being very user-friendly and well-supported  with
supplementary programs and inexpensive industrial start-up programs, most
worlds have found that the use of IDP\'s aids their economies by enabling them
to be conversant with, and capable of meeting, the maintenance and equipment
needs of visiting  starships and crews."

   Granted, the article doesn\'t refer to computers, but I\'d be  willing to bet
that the same thing applies. Also, Traveller literature has never mentioned
compatability problems when  computers communicate.
   Before this, I had assumed that weapons, vehicles, and heavy equipment
varied wildly. In fact, all three seem (to my  admittedly non-expert mind) to
be far more subject to local  variation than computers.
   Now, if you accept this, it still doesn\'t mean that the virus idea is
necessarily a good one, just that it\'s possible. There  are still many, many
difficulties to be overcome:

   Distributing the thing: Technological innovation? I think not. A TL 16
blueprint would only be useful to TL 16 worlds, and if  it\'s any lower in TL,
it\'s not an innovation. Besides, won\'t some of the billions of computer and
software engineers notice  something? And, if it has only a few release
points, it could indeed take centuries to circulate. And I might question if
it  would ever spread to the other factions, who might be using incompatible
computers by this time.
   (Actually, having it fail to destroy the other factions sounds like a
pretty good idea to me. Without the Solomani, Vilani,  Antares, and Daibei,
the ex-Imperium is going to be overrun by  Aslan, Hivers, and Vargr. The
factions, OTOH, don\'t have the  resources to conquer what\'s left. Also, for
what it\'s worth, I\'d be much more willing to play in this universe.)

   Security: The "First Law of Security" states that the chance of a given
secret leaking rises proportional to the _square_ of the number of people
aware of it. I think this is what Bryan was looking for.
   I concur with Bryan and Scott about trade: most worlds appear to be largely
self-sufficient.

   However, our disagreement about the homogenity of computers is partially
tied to the fact that we\'re arguing from different  starting points. I am not
discussing what I think the situation  _should_ be; I\'m just discussing what
the literature suggests it  is and what I think GDW is assuming it is.

   Basically, I think any argument that ignores these points will  not
convince GDW:

   1) They want Imperial civilization to collapse.
   2) They want it to collapse over a year or two.
   and 3) They want it to be done with a computer virus.

"Why is this so worrisome to DGP?"

It\'s not. It\'s annoying to me PERSONALLY because I started this topic with a
specific goal in mind. I don\'t ask that those messages not be posted, only
that they go elsewhere. I don\'t want anybody censored but my original
intention was for this to be a CONSTRUCTIVE discussion of things people want
to see in the new Traveller revision. This way, the GDW folks can look through
here without having to wade through alot of nonsense messages from people that
don\'t have much to ADD. 

Carl, if you\'re not even reading those messages and don\'t know what they
contain then DON\'T post them here. Topic one or the Publication  Development
topics will get read as well as this one. Personally, I don\'t think personal
attacks on GDW belong ANYWHERE in this BBS but I\'m not a sysop and don\'t have
any control over that. Saying that GDW should by covered with meat by-products
and thrown to the carnivores is NOT what I consider appropriate and I\'ll bet
that the folks at GDW will take stuff like that into consideration when
measuring peoples comments.

Jay, the point being that there is a lot of information gathered and I don\'t
have the time to wade through it all and I will not selectively edit.

Oft times topics go a different direction than originally intended. This is
not a bad thing in general.

Anybody who reads any topic or BB or email or mailing list has to realize that
the burden of content is on the writer, not the person or company providing
the service (this has already been borne out in a court of law, I might add.)

With the good comes the bad.  If there is a person writing offensive things
that are already covered in the rules for GEnie then, when it has been pointed
out, I will remove _all_ articles from that person.

Again, I will not selectively edit a post.  The bad comes with the good.

BTW, how do you propose I determine what is "good" vs what is "bad"? I think
we have already seen several long messages that you would have determined to
be "bad" and not posted while I would have thought they were "good".  GDW can
ignore the "garbage" as well as I or you can.

Due to my own time constraints, I will not divide up the TML to conform to the
Topic list.  What I can recommend is that you treat the individual posts in a
TML post as being from the person who wrote it and if you have something to
say, say it to that person.  I will even go so far as to forward email so long
as the number of messages doesn\'t get too large.  Remember the old adage,
"Don\'t shoot the messenger."

1) Keep something _like_ the MT task system, it was reasonably easy to
use and gave people with a little skill to do something easy with a
reasonable chance of success, but even the most experienced character
needed to work on the hard tasks.  I\'ll admit it needs work, I\'d
reccomend: 
	a) Less variation in task time (perhaps none?) if any it
should be skill-modified.

	b) Multiple "pre-requisites" without which you get big minuses

EX:

Task, to fire a shotgun, Routine, Required: Dex 4+ Shotgun 0+, 1
round, DM+ shotgun skill, Dex.

2) Keep the world generation system.  (Actually I prefer book 6\'s
physical world generation, the math is harder, but the physics still
works in pathological cases (I *like* trinary systems...))

3) Keep the character generation system.  This and the world
generation system I feel are the neater features of Traveller, You
can\'t imagine (OK, you can) the fun I have trying to extract my
characters personality from his service history....

4) Combat should be simple (Kill the "High Pen" and "low pen" stuff,
needlessly complex, pen > armor = full damage, pen < armor damage =
damage -armor + pen would do.  Or something of that complexity.)

5) Combat should be deadly.  Pudditat get shot, fall down go boom.

6) Hand to hand with blunt instrumens should *not* be deadly.  My
first MT game a player hit someone with his pistol, instead of
shooting him (didn\'t need a murder rap too...).  Poor victim died....
(At least the rules thought so...)

> Tom Harris
>> Me (Bart Massey)
]

First, let me thank Tom Harris for providing us with much new
detailed information on the DV!  This was the kind of thing I
was hoping for in response to some of the earlier TML queries...

>>Speaking as a computer scientist of sorts

> Gee, I was speaking as a real computer scientist.  Sorry to be so
> sarcastic, but your article has a attitude problem.

Sorry -- I didn\'t really want to get into my qualifications in
detail since I didn\'t think that they were that important to the
discussion, but since you sort of asked, let me just mention
that I\'ve been programming computers for almost 15 years now,
I\'m about 6 months from my MSCS here at UO, I spent 3 years as a
professional computer programmer and system administrator, I
spent two terms teaching undergraduate CS at Portland State
University, and I\'ve done a lot of hobby electronics, both
digital and analog.  Hopefully, this is adequate background for
understanding some of what computers do and can do.

You\'re right, I do have a bad attitude about the proposed
virus.  Let me explain again the fundamental reasoning behind
my earlier letter:

	Several people on the TML described a trivial method
	(moving the setting to another part of the galaxy) of
	obtaining a desired effect in the setting for SV (low to
	medium technology, but with starships).  They also
	voiced what I feel were valid complaints about the
	method GDW proposed to obtain this effect (a "Long
	Night" caused by computer viruses).  The responses I
	saw to these complaints from GDW didn\'t seem to me to
	evince *any* sentiment other than "we\'re smarter than
	you give us credit for, and so you should trust us when
	we say our way is superior" (although this may have
	been a bad reading on my part) and I am frankly hesitant
	to "trust" GDW after the MT debacle.
  	
It was based on these perceptions that I wrote earlier.

Distance, distance, distance!  Just put the SV setting far
enough away that it could be reached from "known space" only
through *extreme* effort, if that.  Then set it up however you
want.

If you want an analogy, consider 14th century Europe, 14th
century China, and 14th century America.

Well, assuming that I *did* want the effect you\'re intending to
achieve, I would probably just adopt the method used by one of
the all-time great sci-fi classics, Asimov\'s Foundation
Trilogy, and let the mysterious forces of sociological
"psychohistory" do the job.  Heck, the post-rebellion MT
universe already looks enough like the fallen Roman Empire to
me to make the whole thing plausible anyhow.  If you wanted to
be really faithful to the original you could use
specially-trained telepaths as psychohistorians.

But I sure wouldn\'t use this or any other idea without having a
bunch of independent and qualified people review it first for
obvious problems.  And I\'d sure listen closely to what they had
to say about it.

Well, for example, as several of us physicist sorts (my
undergraduate degree is a BA in Physics) have noticed
(particularly Dow Reider, if memory serves) it is possible to
build perpetual motion machines out of thruster plates -- I
believe I could build one with the jump drives as well under
the current rules.  Assume for a moment that this is so.

Let\'s assume, then, that this energy being produced during jump
doesn\'t come from "nowhere", but from some source unknown to
the builders of jump-drives.  Now, let it run out :-).

Note that this is an off-the-cuff idea which might not work out.
So what\'s the first thing I\'d do with it (once I\'d fully
elaborated it) if I wanted to use it?  I\'d *run it by the
physicists on the TML* and see what they thought of it...

OK, first of all, let\'s agree on some common terminology.
First, let\'s call this thing a "worm" instead of a virus --
maybe then we can both agree that this is what the DV actually
is.  For the purposes of this discussion a "worm" is a computer
program which spreads by copying itself from computer to
computer.

A "CPU" (lit. Central Processing Unit) is a collection
consisting of "memory" together with a permanently hardwired
"control".  "memory" is storage which will be altered during
normal execution of computer programs (thus, the CPU contains a
bunch of internal "registers" (both directly user-visible and
otherwise) which are a form of memory, but the CPU typically
also runs with some larger amount of "peripheral" memory
attached).

Now one of the more straightforward things to do in TL7-8 CPU
design, as I understand it, is to check that no possible memory
state can lead to the CPU hardware or control being physically
damaged.  Why is this in principle so easy?  Because one uses
existing computers to do "worst-case" analysis, and
over-engineers the hardware and control to handle the worst
case.  Why is this almost always attempted?  Because it\'s not
possible at TL7-8 to determine that there is no path from the
initial memory state(s) to this worst state.  Indeed, there are
sound computer-theoretic reasons why this latter problem is in
general insoluble at *any* TL.

Which isn\'t to say that CPUs aren\'t built which are vulnerable
to the sort of worm described above.  But I\'d be willing to
wager that there\'s no "common architectural flaw" in current
CPUs which makes them all vulnerable to the *same sort* of
software attack, and that there never will be.  (EXERCISE: find
out how to damage the CPU of the machine you\'re reading this on
from software.)

Better yet, make the worm activate the destruct code everywhere
at once, using global clocks.  ("real" viruses with long lags
must affect the host populations exponentially rather than
instantaneously because they have no global clock available,
and would probably "choose" to do so anyhow because destroying
their entire host population is an "undesired" side-effect
rather than a goal.)

Seeding production facilities shouldn\'t be *necessary* for the
worm; I assume you just want to *make sure* the worm reaches
these spots, which is sensible.

Ahh, but you can\'t have it both ways (at least not easily).
IMHO the most plausible "protection and recovery" scenarios
would lead to a mixture of TLs from the low to the high end.
If *any planet* in the region manages to retain TL13, it could
bootstrap the others to that level in a straightforward
fashion...

OK, there\'s two distinct interpretations of planetary TL in two
sentences.  We\'ve had our own discussion on the TML about what
planetary TL means, and one thing I thought we pretty much
decided is that the planetary TL is some kind of average over
various planetary technologies, which raises additional
questions.  One thing it would be nice to see in any new GDW
rules is a very detailed discussion in a single place of TLs
and what they represent.

I\'ve always wanted to use that quote somewhere :-).  But I agree
that if you could destroy all the computers in a TL15 culture
simultaneously you might well send the culture back to TL0.
Seriously, reread the Foundation Trilogy -- it\'ll probably give
you some good ideas about more *subtle* ways of doing what you

Oops.  I should have made myself clear -- I was using "bridge" in
the Webster\'s II sense (1) "a structure spanning and providing
passage over an obstacle, as a waterway", not (6) "a crosswise
platform above the main deck of a ship from which the ship is
controlled".  An understandable misunderstanding, given the
Traveller milieu :-).

BTW, we knew how to jam TL4 radios at TL4, so I would call that
more of a "unavoidable technological difficulty" than an
"undiscovered architectural flaw", but maybe I\'m just
quibbling...

Here, I think, we reach the crux of the argument.  For me, and
IMHO for many in the TML, a variant of Occam\'s Razor is an
important tool in SFRP game design and play.  I\'d phrase it
like this: "One should not multiply unexplainable entities
without cause in the design of SFRP games or adventures".  So
far, there\'s really only been a few "Big Black Boxes" in
Traveller -- jump drives, antigrav, and thruster plates, for
the most part.  Note that many TML respondents (count me in)
seem to hate the thruster plates for the very reason that
fusion rockets would achieve the same effect in an
*explainable* way.  I oppose the BBB DV idea because I think
the idea of simply moving SV elswhere physically allows one to
achieve the effect desired much more "simply".

I think what you\'re trying to say here is that by setting SV in
the near-future in the "known space" of MT/Traveller, GDW gets
the ability to re-use much of the background material from
Traveller.  I agree.  I think they\'re also giving up an
important thing which hasn\'t been much discussed, namely the
ability to do Trav/SV crossover adventures, but let\'s assume GDW
doesn\'t care, for business reasons, ever to be able to do so.
They\'re also giving up the ability to *change their mind* and
start supporting MT again, which is not a trivial thing, but
again, assume they don\'t care, because they made the right
decision the first time.

Given all that, I don\'t think that it\'s the *idea* of setting
SV after a "Long Night" which bugs me so much, it\'s that I
still don\'t like or believe the whole DV *mechanism*.  I think
others may still be hesitant as well (anyone?).  So invent
another one!  "Long Night" scenarios are millicredits per
kiloplot in SF, and I personally am much more inclined to
believe in Niven/Pournelle\'s "superconductor virus" or even
your own "oil-damaging virus" than in the DV.  All I\'m
suggesting is that whatever scenario you come up with, run it
past us first.  We\'d be happy to criticize it, and even suggest
ways to improve it.  But once it\'s set in stone it\'s no fun for
us anymore.

Finally, assuming that you\'re still dead set on a computer
virus, here\'s an alternative scenario you may find appealing:
a disgruntled TL21 scientist writes a complicated collection of
programs which spread through galactic computers in spite of
being detected and understood, because they simply don\'t cause
enough trouble to be worth the effort (e.g. a program which
broadcasts jokes on a ship\'s intercom in the evenings -- or
imagine software Tribbles, if you will).  These programs *very
slowly* get more troublesome (e.g. the program is replaced by
one which sometimes starts broadcasting jokes just before a
complicated jump), but by the time people begin to realize how
annoying and dangerous the whole thing is getting, the
debuggers, repair robots, everything is full of them.  Further,
the higher the TL, the more troublesome and common the programs
are.

As a result (insert complicated sociological forces here)
everybody begins to use higher TL computers only in "safer"
situations.  Eventually, *usable* computing ends up at some low
TL, and the rest of society follows.

The prettiest bit of the above scenario is that you can still have
TL18 computers, robots, etc.  They will just act strangely and
unreliably, making it iffy whether it\'s better to work with them
or without them.  Endless fun for the Ref.  (See e.g. a TML
description in an earlier volume of a repair robot which tended
to go batty, or the classic Terry Carr SF short "The Robots Are
Here" ...)

But is the above scenario at all plausible?  I\'m sure the TML
members will let me know, and if they say not, I\'d sure invent
something else...

At any rate, it\'ll be interesting to see how the whole thing
turns out.  Thanks again for your feedback, and if I\'ve
offended you or anyone else who\'s been reading our exchange, I
hope that you will accept my humble apology.  Please take my
word for it that I have only my own best interests at heart :-),
and that it is very much in my best interests for GDW to do the
best SFRP games possible.  Take care,

 Lester -
      <Jeez, Mike: Diaspora isn\'t even out of editorial yet. What makes
 you say it has a cyberpunk flavor?>  Sorry, allow me to clarify.
      I didn\'t mean Diaspora the book, but Diaspora the sector.  In
 phone conversations with Chuck Gannon, it sounded like GDW would aim
 to create a density of support for Diaspora Sector, rather than
 scatter it all around the Shattered Imperium (Vland, Daibei, ...).
      I didn\'t know how far the "virus thing" would spread.  It could
 envelope all of Charted Space, or range only 100 parsecs from, say,
 the Hive Federation for all I know.  But it seemed a safe bet it would
 get Diaspora, so I mentioned that.  (Perhaps I should have said \'new
 setting\'.)
      By \'cyberpunk\', I don\'t mean hard core cyberpunk (netrunning and
 cyberspace), but fringe elements like the \'dark future\'.  That GDW
 chose a computer virus also seems to suggest cyberpunk.
      Like Mark Turnage, I am more confident from your message in the
 direction things are taking.  I see possibilities.  My single biggest
 concern remains, though, is if the virus spreads into the Corridor.  I
 explain why in Tiffany Star 29 which should arrive there Friday.

Thanks for the clarification, Mike.

Dark future, huh. Hmm. I suppose I ought to be quick to say that while T2K and
D-Con are definitely dark future games, we are NOT taking that turn with
Traveller. In T2K and D-Con, things never really get better, I suppose. Or
more accurately, the PCs can make things better, but they  can never really
FIX the way the world is. In Traveller, on the other  hand, the Star Viking
era is just one part of the overall history. We  have already sketched out a
time line reaching beyond that era and into the future--a time line that will
keep us extremely busy with adventures, sourcebooks, and novels (yes, even
novels) for at least the next decade. Of course, exactly how that time line
proceeds will depend a great deal  upon input from Traveller players as it
unfolds. 

The important thing, I think, is that we have a plan, and that the plan
excites us and spurs us on. I only wish the things we have in  production were
already out and on the shelves. 

Later, 

 Les

Greetings again.

I\'d like to take a minute to talk a bit about the D20 task system we\'re
planning for the Traveller revision. 

First, the skill or attribute level you have is your target number for an
Average task. Easy is vs. twice that number; Very Easy versus four  times the
number. Difficult is vs. half the number; Very Difficult vs.  one-fourth. For
instance, a character with a skill level of 8 would be rolling for the
following numbers or less: 
 Very Easy: 32
 Easy: 16
 Average: 8
 Difficult: 4
 Very Difficult: 2

If you don\'t have any skill at all, you roll percentile dice vs. your 
controlling attribute. For instance, an Easy test of Observation, for a
character with no Observation skill but an Intelligence (Observation\'s
controlling attribute) of 14 would be 28% (percentile roll vs twice the
attribute level).

A roll of 20 always misses (5% chance), and a roll of 1 always hits ( (again a
5% chance), unless the referee decides otherwise.

Now for task philosophy. Mundane, everyday tasks are not rolled for. Does the
character have an applicable skill? Yes? Then he or she succeeds.  Every day
tasks with some risk of failure involved become Very Easy or  Easy. Success
means PERFECT PERFORMANCE; failure means less than perfect, depending upon how
badly the roll missed by. Example: I make my Navigation skill roll exactly,
and I enter the system right on target; I fail it by 2 points, and I miss my
window by enough distance to make my landing 2  hours late (or some such
determination by the referee). 

Now, some people have been arguing that a character with skill level 1 in
Traveller has roughly a 50% chance of succeeding at an Average task, while a
character with a skill level of 1 in T2K2, for instance has only a 10% chance.
That\'s very true. But given the change in task philosophy, a character from MT
trying for an Average task with a skill level 1 would,  when converted to the
new system, be making a Very Easy task roll with a  skill level of 2--a 40%
chance of success. Couple this with the fact that new system characters tend
to consolidate their skill points, rather than dispersing them quite as much,
and that reasonable tests can be made vs  the related attribute, and I think
you\'ll find the new system works very nicely. It certainly won\'t leave a
universe full of bumbling fools, as  might have been suspected.

As I\'ve said before, I realize that the new system FEELS different from the
2D6 one. And that\'s a valid point. But the 2D6 system has some  problems of
its own. My own complaints about it have always been that  tough tasks price
low skill levels right out of the market, and that  doesn\'t feel right to me
to have no chance at all if a character has at least a modicum of skill. For
instance, a MT character with a skill level of 2 has no chance of succeeding
with with a Difficult task. But the equivalent character in the new system
would have a skill level of 4,  needing a 2 or less for a Difficult task and a
1 or less for a Very  Difficult task.

Also, the 2D6 bell curve has always bothered me. (I realize I\'m treading upon
sacred ground here, for some, but it\'s the truth.) A +1 modifier  does not
mean the same jump for a character with skill 10 as for one with skill 6, for
instance. In the new system, a +1 is a +1 is a +1.

Those are my comments for the moment. Any questions or comments? I\'d be happy
to respond.

Sincerly, 

 Les

I don\'t know if this has been mentioned before (it\'s hard to keep up with all
this), but how long after the rebellion does this virus event take place?
About the new task system: I always liked the fact that I never needed to buy
any "fancy" dice for Traveller, but, as you said Loren, I was terribly
frustrated when a character had no chance of making a difficult roll. 
  Does this mean that the new character generation system is non-random? 
Somewhat like DC? I wouldn\'t mind that one bit, since the fact that one can
customize his character in DC appeals to me.

Thats all for now... Jim

(heck, I was about to upload my own to the DC topic...grumble, grumble...:).

  I\'ts going to take some time to play with this one.  I\'m assuming skills are
remaining at 1 to 10 ranges, with stats remaining as they were in the old min:
2, max: 15 range.  Please correct me if I\'m wrong.  If you could give some
examples of tasks (especially combat- related ones...that\'s where the
mechanics of a system sink or swim), that\'d be helpful.

  I appreciate your concerns with system mechanics and, frankly, agree with
them.  Les, its so refreshing to hear a designer that has _any_ real worries
about game mechanics.  After some of the kludges that have come out from
various companies (Not to name any names...), at least some thought\'s going
into this one.

  And I\'m even more confident after your comments about the direction being
charted...frankly, when this was first announced it sounded VERY arbitrary,
spur-of-the-moment and, well, idiotic.  Not anymore.

  I think this is gonna be good, folks.

   Les, I can see several problems with the new task system  right off. Taking
it point by point:

   1) First of all, I suggest that you rename the task levels, possibly using
the MT pattern (Simple, Routine, etc.). Not only does this allow for easier
task conversion from MT stuff, but it eliminates a _very_ confusing aspect of
the current setup.
   GM\'s who look at the pattern you\'ve got there will tend to assume that
Average tasks are average and assign them to tasks  that are, well, average,
like the Jumping example you mentioned.  In short, most tasks a character
attempts will get an Average difficulty rating.

   2) Aside from your mention of a character with an Int of 14 which I assume
means that the stats are getting reworked, I can see problems with the
unskilled tasks. That character will get  WORSE at Observation if he acquires
any skill level below 3.  While I like the idea of allowing characters to
attempt tasks  without necessarily having the skill, should they really be
less  competent once they learn something?

   3) Having generated several T2K2 and DC characters, I question the
likelihood of them having many skills at level 8. Look at  Dara Schwartz in
DC, or both sample characters in T2K2. I see a  lot of 2\'s, 3\'s and 4\'s, but
not many 8\'s. (OK, ONE 7). The other sample character in DC has a few high
skill levels, but is a  total klutz outside of Empathy related skills. Are you
sure that  we won\'t get a universe of bumbling fools, especially now that 
sucess chances have been reduced still further?

   4) Whaddya mean, a character with skill level 2 has no chance  of
succeeding at a Difficult task in MT? They need to roll 9+ on 2D6, and that\'s
only if no characteristic mods are involved,  which they usually are. Might
you have been thinking of a  Formidable task, perchance? <g>

That\'s all for now, but I\'LL BE BACK...

  Oh yeah, one other thing. Be careful with the conversion system. A 
character from MT should not be vastly superior or inferior to one in the new
system. 
  That was a problem in T2K2, where my converted mechanic was better than a
SAS character generated under the new rules. MUCH better. At everything.

And a happy Thanksgiving to all you Americans...

Another thing to the wish list, the name of the game. I never did like the
name MEGATraveller. It makes the game sound kind of.. silly. It would be great
if the name goes back to Traveller.

    Oooh, Metlay must have fallen out of bed on Wednesday to spark all that.

    On his point #6 about the name "Star Vikings", even if they are sometime
explorers and merchants, that fits exactly with the real Vikings (as a people,
not in the actual use of the term amongst the Scandanavians).  It also fits
quite well with Space Viking, in particular the later sections, where actual
reiving wasn\'t a prime goal.

    In response to the question about possible "intimidation", I don\'t feel
intimidated, but then I also have not really concerned myself with being
published either.  I make lots of noise when I find something wrong (any of
the old GEnie hands can report my reaction to FSotSI), and give credit when
it\'s due.


    On Scott Kellogg\'s stuff -

    RE: rifle-3 vs medic-3 - Somewhat true, although not as much as you might
think.  Shooting is a skill that is easy to learn up to a certain level (which
varies by the individual) and gets much tougher after that.  People seem to
have some level of innate skill (hand-eye coordination and ability to judge
leads and distances) in this sort of thing and progress to that level is easy
and requires only a limited amount of practice.  Getting over your innate
ability limit, though, is something that requires a lot of practice.  The
people who shoot for Olympic teams and so on are shooting 75-100 rounds a day,
just to stay where they are.....

    RE: fuel requirements - Yes, we should, but no, we shouldn\'t.  Clear? 
What I mean is that I agree that the fuel consumption is way out of whack for
the high-tech fuel sources.  A problem I see is that if we fix it, then we
(again) throw out every old design and start over again.  Hmmmmmm.  Maybe if
we doubled J-fuel requirements we\'d stay something close to current designs,
but still...


    Loren, I think you\'ve got critical mass on designers willing to help.  Any
suggestions?  (Maybe I should test-run this fuel consumption change....)

         ***************ALERT!!! ALERT!!!***************
         ***************TERRORIST AT WORK***************

    WELL SORTA,

    <Virus> Well I was hoping this was just a rumour that would die. And I\'ll
leave it at that for now, though Metlay has some points on that area (Seeing
the theory might be believing, I presume the computer designer has taken
courses in alien computer design? The virus will work on all computers TL5-16?
On each different worlds computer systems? On analog and digital systems?
etc.... Let\'s say computer treatment in Traveller has never been a strong
suite, though the change in MT was a big improvement).

    <Scott Kellogg> On DC character generation (which I\'m most familiar with,
as versus T2K). It probably takes roughly as long to get a decent character in
the system as it does in MT or Traveller, maybe a tad longer, the advantage
lies in the fact that you can increase the skill points given per year quite
easily, which is probably the first thing I\'d do (for DC or MT), as I prefer
characters who are skilled and in their prime (early to mid-30\'s).
    It does take the character a higher skill level to perform well though,
but as the player gets to allot the points in the skill areas available this
problem isn\'t to bad, and it\'s easier to pick up skill levels too (at least I
think so).

    Okay all, I have sent GDW the TML bundles I have, which is through 212.

    <being intimidated by having GDW/DGP on GEnie> Not particularly,
especially as they seem uninterested in the MT section most of the time
(actually DGP being on GEnie was the only reason I signed on in the first
place, HIWG and FASA being the primary reasons I stayed on).
    I would have to say once again, that sometimes I wonder if these guys know
what their doing on occasion, I understand some of the problems they\'ve run
into, but others seem to be self-inflicted (FSotI, lack of adventures, MT\'s
errata). Sometimes I wish they where more activist like FASA and WEG, although
they seem to be doing so with DC currently.

Loren,
    What I mean by more activist in the above paragraph, is that FASA and WEG
ask for advice, you guys just seem to sit around and wait for it to drop into
some sort of black hole.
    FASA also started a playtest area for selected GEnie users.
    It\'s not that I expect GDW to drop everything and listen to us
exclusively, or even listen to us all the time. But some of the time would be
nice. GDW\'s attention to the MT area on GEnie has been poor till recently,
DGP\'s has been to, but at least they had an excuse (that being only part-
timers).
    In the meantime the MT area here has been drifting along on the sufferance
of HIWG support (which I think says alot, as it makes the MT area the only
Category that doesn\'t have the support of the company that makes the game).
    If it hadn\'t of been for HIWG, I probably would have lost interest in
Traveller a long time ago, heading in my own direction as far as Space RPG\'s
go (which might still not be a bad move).
    TRAVELLER in my opinion is still the best overall rules set and universe
around in my opinion (although I still have a large tendency to alter both,
it\'s the only one around I could survive with as is, well, except for the
errata).
    As for Star Vikings, well, let\'s say it\'s something I always wanted to do
with the right bunch of players, although on different scales. It sounds like
fun, it sounds exciting, but I\'d probably ignore it, if I were going to do
something like that I\'d do my own, if I used the current Traveller universe,
I\'d probably use one of the previous Long Nights. But that\'s my problem not
yours, I\'d say go for it, I\'m always free to ignore it if I want.
    In the meantime, I\'d like to do what I can to make sure that things work
out okay, currently the only axe I have to grind is to make sure that whatever
rules come out, come out okay.

Metlay: Thanks for the post. Thanks for your frankness. I\'d sincerely  rather
have you saying such things (and with such emotion) out in the open as you
have, than to have someone boiling over inside and polite on the outside.

Let me repeat, though. We\'re in this business because it\'s fun.  Honestly, I
set aside a career in business writing or teaching writing  in order to take
this job, despite the fact that it pays less and  takes longer hours. What
makes it worthwhile, though, is that it\'s fun.

Next, when game rules are less than good, sales slump, no matter how  slick
the product looks. And if a company gains a reputation for poor  rules, that
reputation becomes very hard to reverse. If you think we\'re relying upon
selling slickness, you\'re plain wrong. 

Are people intimidated that we\'re on-line? I certainly hope not. You,  Metlay,
seem to perceive some sort of gulf between us and gamers. That\'s why I keep
insisting that we ARE gamers. The only difference between us is that our
livelihood depends upon games. But game store owners and  employees are in the
same boat. Do you perceive a gulf between you and them, as well? 

Jeez, if the posts here are those of intimidated gamers, I\'d hate to have to
deal with them when they\'re feeling free to speak openly. 

I\'ve said it once, and I\'ll repeat it: We let our interest in Traveller lapse.
We got involved in other things. But we\'re back in the Traveller business,
both feet. 

We ARE listening to the posts here. Loren and I are both on line just  about
daily, and Loren has been capturing these posts and taking them to work, where
we discuss them with Frank, Dave, and Nick. The posts ARE  shaping the way
things are being done. 

Now, all things considered, Star Viking is coming. The virus is coming. And
we\'re revising Traveller\'s character generation and task systems to  make them
compatible with our other games. As we see it, T2K2\'s systems  are a natural
outgrowth of the original Traveller system, just as MTrav\'s are. We need to
bring the two branches into one again, and the T2K2  system is better, so
that\'s the way we\'re going. (More about the task system in topic 26--I think
it is--where I normally post.)

Loren is currently working things out for GDW to have an on-line, face- to-
face discussion of the coming year for Traveller. And I encourage you all to
mail us your rules variants, comments, criticizms, and whatnot (preferably
ground mail, so we have paper to hand around without the  intermediate steps
of capturing and printing). 

In conclusion, Metlay, you say that the proof is in the pudding, and  that
you\'ll be convinced when you have the final product in your own two hands.
That\'s all we can ask. 

Sincerly, 

 Les.

  Due to Les\' recent comments, I have to say that my opinions of the revision
are radically changing.  A lot of my fears have been have been soothed and I\'m
actually feeling that this will be something positive and worth waiting for,
instead of an inevitable to be dreaded and lived with.

  I still stand by everything I\'ve said before.  Do I still have problems and
doubts: you better believe it!  We, as gamers in general, have been burned
before.  And this is a BIG step...there\'s still a lot that can be flubbed. 
The proof, as Metlay said, will be in the final product.  GDW _must_ be open
to our feelings if this is going to work, but we\'ve also got to understand
their posistions and be willing to listen to them as well.

  That said, back to the wish list and reiterating some things.

1)  The consensu view on here is that the original publication MUST BE
COMPLETE.  We\'ve got to have enough to cover all the classic areas...in
general detail; this means system building, character generation, equipment,
background, *starship/vehicle operations and design!!!*, trade/merchant rules,
etc.  With the Basic Neo-Traveller set you should be able to handle any of the
classic travelling situations, including the areas covered by the supplements,
to some degree...admittedly abstract in many areas.  This especially includes
large combats and fleet actions.  This doesn\'t mean I have to have Neo-Striker
or High Guard III -The Wrath of Meson Cannons; it does mean I should be able
to tell the players "Well when the Reds with their fourteen cruisers fought
the Blues with their ten cruisers and light carrier, the [insert color here]\'s
won..." after two or three die rolls.  Leave the gory details to the specific
supplements.

    I think the idea that should be aimed at here is the "Levels of Detail"
one that came up in the discussions about AI way, way back. GMs should be able
to go into as much detail as prefered.  Let the basic system handle a general
level of detail sufficient enough to provide compelte play: ie, if I never
want to pick up a supplement I can still run the game.  Let supplements handle
more specific areas; if the GM or players want to go to the trouble, have the
material there...but don\'t make it impossible to run the game if they DONT
want to go to the trouble.

    A good breakdown could be:  Basic rules.  Detailed Vehicle/Equipment
design rules.  Detailed System rules (ala World Builder\'s).  Detailed mass
combat/military campaign rules (Mercenary/Striker).  Detailed Fleet
combat/Strateic level rules (High Guard/Trillion Credit Squadron).  Ultra-High
Tech technologies (TL 16 +)  Detailed racial rules, and so on.

    With the detailed supplements could also come the non-Imperium genre items
(particularly all the various technologies bandied about for Starship
Operator\'s Manual Vol 2).  Alternate genre/historical period settings...a
popular one would be a "Prologue" source book that covered the period between
the end of the Rebellion and NT.  As someone suggested, 2300 AD could live
again.  Maybe even Space:1989? This\'d also have the big plus of allowing GDW
to have more than one SF game...meaning *licenses!* (Its estimated that so
many books are being licensed by SJG at this point that in ten years, world
books\'ll be coming out for novels not to be written until sometime in the mid-
21st century :)

I\'ve been watching this discussion for a while with no intention of adding to
the confusion, but I\'ve changed my mind.  This may be of some small interest to
the TML, but is primarily aimed at GDW via GEnie.

First some background to let everyone see where I\'m coming from:
I\'ve played in several different gaming systems (D&D, RuneQuest, Classic Trav,
plus GM-modified versions of the above).  In addition, I attempted to Ref
a short MegaT campaign.  About four years ago I created a character in T2Kv.1
but never had a chance to run him in a game.  This is the extent of my gaming
experience.  In particular, please note I have no experience with T2Kv.2

1. With that out of the way, let me start off by saying I like the task system
   in MegaT and I would be sorry to see it go.  It\'s not totally realistic, but
   no skill resolution system is (and if they were, the game would likely be
   nearly unplayable).  It is one of the aspects that makes MegaT different
   from other gaming systems.  The explanation of how it works allows the ref
   to create his own tasks very nearly on the fly in a gaming session.

In case that isn\'t clear enough, let me state it directly:
   -- Please don\'t remove the task system.

2. The ship design system:  I have not used it extensively, and so I don\'t feel
   I am qualified to comment on it IN MY OWN KNOWLEDGE, but I\'ve heard many
   negative comments about it.  I like the idea someone put forth (I think it
   was a TMLer) about modular ship design, i.e. I\'ll take one 400 ton hull, one
   standard sensor package, one model 9 computer, 2 triple beam laser turrets,
   etc.  Where the costs and attributes (power consumption, volume, etc) of
   each item is enumerated in a single table.  I like this idea.  It makes ship
   design easier for those of us who aren\'t into the details of it and only
   need a quick ship encounter for our party.  Another specific complaint I\'ve
   heard about the ship design system is the lack of variation in price due to
   tech level (such as in GURPS).

3. I don\'t like the virus idea.  The arguments already put forward by other
   members of the TML go for me also.  Assuming I like the new system, I will
   NOT use this senario, at least not as I\'ve heard it so far.  If the official
   senario is different from what I\'ve heard so far, I will reconsider using
   it.  If you absolutely HAVE to collapse the Imperium, I think a MUCH more
   likely reason is economic collapse due to the Rebellion.  But remember, if
   the Imperium collapses, for whatever reason, what keeps the Zhodani, Hivers,
   and the other interstellar cultures from taking it over?

4. Let me close by saying I am very interested in playtesting your new system.

Classic Traveller ---- A Good Start

If we are to try and truly *GET IT RIGHT* this time, I think a brief look
into the well-loved game that started it all is in order. After all, if I
hadn\'t bought a LOAD of Traveller stuff (and loved it all), I probably would
never have tried MT (and I nearly didn\'t, but thank the PBEM for that.)

What did I love about Traveller? Simple (perhaps too simple), playable rules
that never got in the way of the play. Logical rules organization. Convenient
packaging. (I never had problems \'porting Traveller!) Classic style in the
presentation. (Basic black with the print in a one-color shtick was a nice
way of doing things. Certainly made them stand out, IMHO.) And MODULES!

LOTS of modules. FUN, interesting, playable! And yet informative as well,
building up the background as they came out. I have extremely fond memories
of Kinunir, Leviathan, Prison Planet, and even Murder on Arcturus Station.
The regular does of JTAS helped as well.

MegaTraveller -- Running in Place

A few steps forward, a few steps back. There was enough here for me that I
don\'t consider any of my MT spending wasted (except for my shameful weakness
in buying the COACC abomination), but at the same time, I am now very much
aware of its shortcomings. A multitude of opinions have gone over the ether,
so let me use a legal conceit and add my own.

MT: Concurring Opinions

The task system. One of the best ideas, I like it immensely, together with
the fleshing out of the skills system.

World Builder\'s Handbook and the Alien modules. Great stuff, especially for
all of us people who get tired of a universe with so many humans. I liked
Starship Operator\'s Guide because it helped to fill in information that is
important to understanding -- helpful when you are trying to GM or play a
situation where the rules aren\'t of help, and even more, give some more
clues about \'day to day\' character existence. (When you consider just how
many characters spend significant amounts of time aboard ships, the more
this can be fleshed out, the better.

The design system -- I like an integrated, detailed design system. When it
comes to starships (especially), I really enjoy building ships from the
ground up and tailored to suit, with significant detail. (I do agree that
a quick-design system might be useful in some situations, reminiscent of
the classic traveller system - one from column a, one from column b, put
the pegs in the holes, and voila, instant starship. just add water...)
I liked Striker, so naturally I appreciated the MT design system, with
one caveat -- as has been expressed, when I want to, I like being able
to design lasers and missles, etc. while also having some prepackaged
systems to choose from otherwise.

MT: Dissenting Opinions

Frankly, I never was real excited about the Rebellion background, as I am
a decided "Behind the Claw" person, obviously going back to Classic Traveller.
I *liked* the idea of concentrating on a one or two sector region and doing
it *in depth*. Anything more was nice. (I wouldn\'t really mind if the rest of
the Imperium & Co dropped off the face of the universe - just keep the Zhodani,
Aslan, Vargr, and such. We need more aliens, not fewer.)

I can see the usefulness of a totally die-based character system, but I tend
to prefer player-dictated character generation. When I play a character (as
in the mammoth TML-PBEM), I generally settle on a concept after some thought
and then create the character\'s skills and history based on that idea. It is
part of the reason I liked T2k (1st ed) ---- some randomness in personal
characteristics, then skills are bought and allocated.

On a related note: more descriptive material in terms of the character
generation would be useful to me: i.e. some more information on educational
institutions (does it work on the BS/MS/PhD system we have?) and the like.

An intuitive (if that is possible) space combat system with a better flow
and a real feel of excitement (personal combat too, I suppose.) I think that
some more detail would be nice, as I think it\'s a little too abstract in
both cases, and when that\'s so, you just don\'t get as worked up about it.
The design system lets you build ships down to the bunkbeds, but you can\'t
destroy it quite that way... Combat is chaotic, lethal and dangerous, and
decidedly so if you are talking about FGMPs and Meson Guns, armor
notwithstanding.

- ----

As to the question directed to us T2k skeptics, I read the system as it
was presented in 2nd ed, and didn\'t much care for it (along with other
parts of the new ed) so I never wasted my money on it or any other system
which has used it.

(I have to comment on the complaints about some comments not being
constructive. It seems akin to a situation where somebody says "We are
going to rip up the Constitution. Taking that as a given, do you have any
constructive comments on what we should replace it with?" If you want to
make a fundamental shift in Traveller, no doubt you will do so, but you
have to grin and bear it when outraged people speak up.)

If the idea is to create a Long Night situation, I think you should put
it IN THE LONG NIGHT! Why go to the trouble of aggravating everybody
(especially those in the know) to create a situation when you\'ve already
got the situation set up? I for one would be interested to see materials
that are set in Traveller\'s past, somewhere in between early spaceflight
and "modern" 1000-1100 era history. If you did that, I for one just might
stick around and even buy it. The KISS principle is valuable here -- or,
to put it another way, why open a new can of worms that aggravates people
when you don\'t have to? The virus idea is per se stupid.

Enough for now. (And if Traveller 3 gets botched up, I suppose I can always
go back to wargaming....)

	Most of the suggestions I\'d like to make about any future
version of Traveller have already been made, and I won\'t waste your
time repeating them.  I have two points I\'d like to make.
	The first is simple:  the task system should remain more or
less the same, except with regards to combat.  Edit that to your
hearts\' content.  That is the one part of the task system that needs
improvement, from what the martially inclined have said.
	The second point concerns the changes in setting.  I have the
impression that the reason that the powers-that-be want to change the
setting is that the one we use at present is too highly defined, and thus
too confining.  I can see how one might feel this way.
	The source of the problem is, however, that it is assumed that
there can only be one official Traveller universe.
	Consider this:  publish a basic game book that describes the
rules, and that includes an appendix describing, briefly, possible
universes in which a Traveller campaign may be set.  This could include
a description of the "classic Imperium" as well as the "Star Viking" era
that has been discussed, and perhaps a few other alternatives as well.
	Supplements describing these universes in more detail could be
produced, but the idea should be that they are optional supplements, not
the "official" definitions of what the universe is.

one big thing we noticed that was lacking was a design system for the game -
something we feel will be required in some form for Traveller.

Is there anything you can tell us about the specifics of the design system

Good Comments, Bart.  (Bart Massey and his long-ish analysis of
why ahd how computer TL could or couldn\'t fall.)  I feel, however
that any time you have a system set up where the speed of 
communication is limited to the speed of locomotion, you have an
anarchy brewing.  Again at any TL.

That is, it is *MUCH* easier to justify total collapse of the 
Empire because of the sheer physical limits of information transfer.
The economics brining it forth seem fairly elementary and obvious.
No intergalactic computer breakdown is needed.

However (and this is a BIG "but") I think that out here are many of
us who might actually enjoy playing an RPG set in a universe where
there is a fairly consistent, fairly high TL.  Consider the "Star
Wars" RPG as an example.  Destroying the Empire would have a cooling,
though not chilling, effect on our playing.  Please leave us a place
in the universe to play.

One final nit-pick.  It\'s about the "TL7 Architectural Flaw" of
using Al rather than Fe for the major component of materials for
bridges of warships.  It\'s not actually being replaced.  It isn\'t
really a flaw.  Aluminum is lighter and cheaper than Iron.  Its
use enables more and better fire control and anti-missile defense.
Its use enables the ship to be faster and more maneuverable.
And this design flaw was never employed universally.

The flaw noted was was that some ships were not designed to 
contain fires.  The Al alloys used in the Sheffield class 
were themselves flammable.  The correction being employed is 
to provide better compartmentalization, better fire resistance in 
the alloys, and rework of through-bulkhead runs (cables, pipes, etc.).

Then there is also the doctrinal flaw of switching off your fire
control radar when you suspect incoming terminally-guided missiles...
=======
Please continue to keep us up-to-date on the design changes, and
we\'ll continue to whine and bitch until we see the new boxes.  :=)

Actualy I am not inquiring about this but about something else

The Traveller errata contains alot of stuff I was querying about, but
there are somethings I was wondering about . 

1) In the advanced mercenary section it claims that promotion for
officers is only allowed for those number listed under paratheses (what
ever) . However the paranthses is not listed . In what assignments can

a mercenary (or a naval officer for that matter) be promoted . 

2) There is no guideline for other races . Does this assume that UUP is
standard for all races . What about a + 1 to Str and End and a -1 Dex - 1
Educ for an aslan ?? It makes sense . 

3) If a player from a low tech world joins the imperial army, wouldnt he
be exposed to higher forms of technology, and thus have access to shipsboat,
grav vehicle, and gauss rifle skill . 

4) At higher technologies, it assume (according to the referees companion) 
that all (or most) of the combat military wears battledress and fights with

energy weapons . But the only people who have access to this are army comm
andos and marines on ships troops . 

5) Is there anything on the imperial army in the rebellion (or at anytime)
the rebellion sourcebook is very sketchy . 

6) When creating a world it gives a + 4 DM for any with an atmos of 4-9 and

a + 4 dm for Pop 8+ . This mean that these worlds stand a very goo chance of 
belonging to a dwarf star systme, which means that they are automaticaly 

outer system planets and habitable . 

7) If the world is in a habitble zone and is the moon of a gas giant, then
the other moons stand a dam good chance of having a population in excess (by
a great margin) of the homworld . The same thing occurs for moons of
the home planets . 

8) Merchant characters have no access to \'bulding\' stats such as end or str, 

and no access to Jack Of all trades which I assume would be a standard skill
for merchants . Nor do they have access to naval architecture . 

9) Can mercenary characters from low tech worlds who have combat rifleman
skills use a gauss rifle 

10) Does a person in the army have to be in the imperial army (couldnt he
belong to an independant military force of the planets government) . 


11) What if the character wishes to join the army but comes from  a world

with a pop of 4- . According to the rebellion sourcebook, a world of a pop of
4- has a little chance of having an imperial army presence.

12) What exactly is meant in the naval career of strike, battle, and so forth

I mean it would be rare that a member planet would become so bad the imperial
government would send the navy in ?

13) What is exactly meant by social class . I mean it doesnt really do 
anything in the game except mean a higher montly upkeep cost . 

14) I adapted the sailor occupation to enhanced status by changing the
naval enhanced characters skill a bit (ie vacc suit to wet suit) . However
would a high tech world actualy need a wet navy (I assume they have coast

guard) and with the adaption where would the assignments come into it (as 
12 above) . 

15) If you fail to get into the occupation of your choice you get drafted . 
To the military careers no less . How does this fit into the \'imperium\' 

universe taking unwanteds and putting them in the military . 

16) If you do get drafted you can have a possibility of coming from an 

asteriod belt and becoming a sailor !!!!!, pretty stupid . 

17) Thats all I can really think of right now . Im not hassling the game
I believe it to be the best sci fi games on the market . Its just that the
rules clarification is a bit misty at the best . If you could get some
answers for me I would be gratetful . I cannot access FTP anymore cause our
UNI just took those rights away from us . I hope I havnt been to pressumtous
asking these questionms but challenge and the journal are to far away to 
post to (mail) and the regularity of magazines arriving here is best to none 
(I am still waiting on the aug-oct issue) . 


Anyway ask your friends etc what they think and please furish me with some
answers . Oh and tell scott kellogg his vehicles are brilliant (cause 101
vehicles simply cannot be had in australia, it just does not exist on the
shelves) . Also ask him exactly how he designs floorplans (Please if that
is not too much to ask) 

Thanks, Thanks, Thansk

Er I am not sure how to do this, but I have a few questions anyway ......

1) When can a \'mercenary\' officer get promoted ? . The book says that they
cannot when the promotion number is listed in parenthises, yet none of them
are (save for garrison) . 

2) The referees companion states that the majority of combat troops at tech

14-15 wear battledress and use energy weapons . Yet the only way theses troops
can gain access to the battledress skill is if they are a marine on ships
troops or a commando . Why not say that army and marines from tech 14+
planets gain the battle dress skill on the infantry column instead of vacc
suit ? 

3) Merchant Characters : Have no access to stat building skills at all . 
More importantly they cannot gain access to Intelligence building skills, or
Jack Of All Trades . Why not in the merchant life have no 2 as Physical 
intead of carousing, have no 5 as mental instead of + 1 Edu, and have
the cadence skill column of leader, jot, instruction, and carousing instead
of just carousing . 

4) Naval Characters : What does strike, battle, and the others actually mean ?
In the current period of the rebellion I can understand but most naval 
characters would have had thier careers before this ? I am sure that strike and
siege missions would have been fairly rare before the rbellion . Could

some one give a description of this for me ?

5) When can naval officers get promoted ?

6) Imperial Mercenaries : Wouldnt they have access to higher tech level 
weaponary . Surely the imperium woulndt have thier troops stationed on 
planets at that planets tech level (look at the marines in vietnam) .

7) Does the player have to belong to the imperial army . Some planets would
have thier own military forces surely, as would many megacoprs (ling standard

products fit in here) 

8) Sailors : Where do sailors fit into the scheme of high tech planets . I 
mean I made up a capitol character who got drafted into the wet navy when
he lived on Glisten !!!! Wouldnt the army at higher tech levels cover this ?

9) Where do flyers fit into the world of the high tech planet ?

10) What are the rules for other races in character generation ?

I will post my other questions shortly

I would appreciate any answers quickly cause I loose my account real soon


Thanks in advance ?

Edmund

Thanks for your recent letter. I wasn\'t able to respond before this, as
my feed from GEnie to the TML was slacking off and actually SPENDING TIME
WITH HIS FAMILY FOR THANKSGIVING! The bum. I\'m having him shot, of course.
|->

Regarding my emotional outbursts, well, I\'m an emotional guy at the core.
It makes me a better scientist, a better gamer, and a MUCH better musician.
If I can\'t throw myself into a game with a reasonable amount of intensity,
then I won\'t bother with it at all-- there are better pastimes out there,
like Traveller, or composing, or (for that matter) kissing my wife. |->
My misgivings remain, and I am unsoothed by your reassurances. But even as
no one can make me support a game I hate, no one can make me castigate a
game that I like. So I want to see whether I like NeoTraveller....

Now, on to substantive matters. From the recent post on the task system,
which (on the face of it) seems workable, I\'ve divined that the very
basics of character generation will be altered. Well, whatever. But there
are a few problems that should be addressed. First of all, as was mentioned
before here, an "escape clause" should be included that allows not only
unskilled characters to default to Intelligence-based rolls, but also anyone
whose training can\'t give them as high a plus as the default roll can. It\'s
silly to lower your chances of success by getting trained. Second, the 
bell curve aspet of the task system in MT was one of its best points, because
it more closely resembles reality than a flat continuum. However, with a d20
roll (POLYHEDRA in TRAVELLER?! My HEART! |-> ), at least there\'s enougreh 
resolution for reasonable skill shadings. In the interest of simplicity,
I would concede the flat scale, but not entirely happily. (My vote would bwe
for a 2d10 system, which is what my home-brewed rules use for skills.)

The statement that the future of Traveller is part of a larger timeline
that is not as ultimately "futile" as DC or T2K2 heartened me somewhat,
but the fact that y\'all are unwilling to budge on the supervirus despite
a welter of less-than-enthusiastic, and well-reasoned, responses is still
a major source of worry for me. You might convince me otherwise when I see
what you\'re doing, but it really does sound ill-thought-out and highly
impractical. So many better ideas have been put forth here....

I am also still awaiting an answer on my offer to playtest the rules. The
surest way to get me on your side is to let me see what you\'re planning
to push while I still have a chance to improve it. Not necessarily wrench
it around to my point of view; IMPROVE IT. What are the odds that I\'ll
get that chance?

metlay

Loren:

A couple of years ago I approached you and Marc about the possibility of
a Traveller novel. Well, I\'m still sitting on the manuscript, never having
heard whether or not a deal was struck between GDW and a publishing house.
Now that the Rebellion and the pre-Rebellion years are no longer going to
be supported, I doubt that my current work would be publishable, so I\'ll
probably make it available on GEnie or the TML in installments. But I *am*
still interested in writing Traveller fiction, so if novels are in the 
works, I\'d like a crack at one....

Let me throw out my application as a rules tester for world generation,
ship and vehicle generation and general mechanics.

(is this going to GDW?  I hope so)

Some comments on some of the rules I would like Loren at all to see...
===============================================================================
1) Worlds
   Time to chuck the 1d6 mentality.  If, as you say, Traveller is heading
   toward a d20 system, world design and generation should be more detailed,
   at LEAST as detailed as variety allowed by 2300ad, with some of the 
   World Builder\'s Handbook thrown in as well.

   One of my big gripes with the old system was the VERY FUDGY Size-Atmo
   connection.  Have the new system generate Size and Density at least.
   Mass and Gravity can be calculated via lookup chart (like in 2300ad).
   
   I have a set of formulas I Palmed off (someone\'s, Mr. Brudick?  I
   can\'t remember) STARFORM program.  This program generated random star
   systems, any I grabbed and reworked some of the formulas to allow the
   feeding of 2300ad data to get useful information.  For Example, given
   Size and Gravity, with a slight random factor and taking into account
   how much solar energy the world receives (this process is actually
   simpler than it sounds), you can come up with a single number representing
   molecular escape velocity.  This MEV can be compared to a simple table
   of elemental MEV ratings...If the world MEV is less than that required
   for O2, then you will obviously not have a T-Norm world.  If not 
   high enough for water vapor, the world will be dry and desert like.

   I can create some of these charts if you (at GDW) wish, in a d20 or
   whatever format.

2) Ships
   For god\'s sake, relegate the G-maximums to the circular file!  While the
   Jump idea is nice, I think the Stutterwarp Idea is better.  However, to
   keep the same flavor as traveller, you CAN make a balance -- Jump ratings
   indicate Cycle rate.  A J-1 ship can cycle 1 Parsec/week, a J2 can
   cycle 1 Parsec in 4 days, 3 days for J3 and J4, 2 Days for J5 and J6,
   1 day for J7 to J9, 12 hours for J10+, etc.

   Power required is based on "guestimated" ship surface area (for the
   jump field, a surface effect) times the cyclic power drain based on the
   J rating.  This WOULD explain why small craft are not suitable for
   jump drives (area goes down a LOT slower than volume due to the power
   laws)

   G rating is, of course, based on mass divided by reaction drive thrust.
   Ships CAN use grav plates for secondary propulsion,
   thus avoiding the need to make holes in the tarmac.  However, thrust
   should drop off as a factor of "current" gravity.

   Example: Grav Tank 100t, produces 200t of grav thrust for 2G\'s on a 1G
   world (total accelleration = 1G).  At 3.3 planetary radii the gravity is
   now 0.1G.  Thrust is now 20t.  The generators now provide 0.2G thrust, vs
   0.1G, for 0.1G net accelleration. 

   Obviously, PROPULSION grav generators are largely ineffective when
   out of the gravity well, but great for getting your ship off the pad and
   a couple thousand KM out before you turn on the fusion drive.  I would
   think this would be REQUIRED procedure for any civilized world (who
   wants a fusion lance pointed in your direction spewing all sorts of evil
   things -- give me a couple score KM of atmosphere, thankyou)

   This gravity requirement does not effect grav PLATES, which
   magnify the gravitational effect of the ship.  

3) Vehicles
   Definitely, as Scott Kellogg mentioned, have a very detailed vehicle
   design system (including bits of Striker and MT, with additions from
   COAAC and palming of ideas from 2300ad.  Keep this system as the BASE,
   having it in a supplement book.  However, crank out some basic module
   rules and incorporate them in the main rules so that we can design vehicles
   form DAY ONE without a Cray.  Since the modules are built using the base
   rules, compatability is assured...

4) Science
   Yeah, I know some tradeoffs have to be made to keep the SF flavor
   (FTL, Anti-grav, etc), but please please PLEASE watch the bad science used
   to make the rules fit.  For example, in the MT Ref Guide, Radios are
   a BIG botch job.  I can accept that radios might very well get lighter
   with TL, even with increasing range. (hell, I can accept that Grandfather
   has radio\'s the size of chicklets that have a parsec receptive range).
   But don\'t expect me to swallow that with decreasing mass you get a linear
   decrease of power.  Be it back pack or walkie talkie, it\'s still going to
   take X watts of power to transmit a clear signal Y miles.  Mass isn\'t the
   limiting factor, distance is (with it\'s spreading of the EM signal).
   
   I talked with someone from the SCI.OPTICS internet group about power
   requirements for laser communications.  I have the formula somewhere and
   can get it to you if you wish, but it basically boils down to 
   "Power equals Signal frequency", increasing via the square law IF the
   laser beam "spot" is larger than the receiver.  A Gigabit laser will require
   1000x the power of a megabit laser, no matter how you slice it.

5) Characters
   Like I said before, I like the "resume" feel of old traveller, but feel
   that character\'s are shafted when you compare them to what comes out of
   Mercenary, High Guard or Scouts.  The latter three require TOO much
   rolling of dice, however, so a happy medium between the two systems, AND
   ONLY USING THIS SYSTEM would be ideal.

   Remove SOC as a characteristic.  The characters can roll for a basic
   social level, if you so desire, but I think titles are best left to
   career mustering out or career effects.

the latest Traveller revision, and I figure that its about time for Marty the
TML Spectator to transform himself into Marty the TML Contributor. So here
goes....
    
     I\'m not going to go into which parts of the rule should be kept and
which parts should be scrapped. Enough has been said about this by countless
others. Oh well, what the hell; I\'ll keep it short. Keep MT task system and
character generation rules. Scrap ship design and ship combat rules. As far
as the rest of the system, I\'m not too concerned.

     What really needs work in my opinion is *format*. I\'m not talking 
about the sloppy way the MT books were put together; that\'s more of a tech-
nical boo-boo, rather than a philosophical problem. (Nevertheless, get it
*right* this time!) What I want to see most is a division of all new
Traveller materials into one of two topics: rules-related information (ie
character generation, tasks, combat, world design, and so on), and official
campaign-related materials (for example, Imperial Encyclopedia info, maps 
and UWP\'s for the Imperium, Aslan/Vargr/Vilani/Solomani sourcebooks, and
info on the Rebellion). KEEP THESE MATERIALS SEPARATE. I hate to shout it,
but if neccessary, I\'ll yodel it from the top of Stone Mountain (the closest
mountain I know of). I run my own alternate campaign universe and have almost
no need for the official universe. I might sprinkle in bits of it that
pop up in magazines like The Megatraveller Journal, but I don\'t want to shell
out bucks for sourcebooks which are half-full of useless information. Two
examples are The Imperial Encyclopedia and The Referee\'s Companion. Both of
them have some useful info, but they have just as much junk (at least, for me
its junk). Why not mix \'n match the two books to make the IE and the RC just
what their names imply?
     An avid fan of the official universe might not mind, and perhaps that
puts me in the minority. But it really chaps my buttocks (if you\'ll permit
me a colorful colloqial expression) to have to buy stuff I don\'t want just  
because its mated up with something useful. I\'m a bit upset with GDW in this
respect--it seems like they\'re trying to get that extra buck out of those of
us who operate outside the official universe. Maybe that judgement is too
harsh, maybe nobody at GDW ever though to look at it from an maverick\'s point
of view. But they should. It certainly wouldn\'t hurt the aficionados of the
official universe if the two topics were kept separate, and it would surely
increase my likelyhood of investing more cash in Traveller products. The 
big question here is: am I a minority of one? I hope not!

enough people say the same thing, it might have some influence.

I\'m more or less totally ignorant of MegaTraveller -- the only time I have
ever played it was in the TML pbem, and mechanics and such were almost
entirely absent from the players view.

I do run a 2300AD pbem, but again in almost two years I have hauled out the
game mechanics ONCE, made a couple of die rolls, and then went on with the 
game.  I have nearly all the worldbooks--I kept buying them because they were
GOOD, and I enjoyed reading them even if I never got a chance to use them.

The only MegaTrav book I own is the Rebellion Sourcebook, and it seemed like-
wise well-written and well-thought-out. (Never having seen old Traveller, I
have no particular emotional reaction to "what\'s been done to The Empire".)

If I buy any of NeoTraveller, or whatever it is to be called, is going to 
depend on two things: a reasonable price, and the quality of the background
material.

I don\'t know--maybe you will be able to present this virus thing with enough
explanation to make it plausible. I won\'t prejudge the issue.  My big
question is WHY?

There seem to be some terribly fundamental objections to this virus--not
arguments based on current understanding of computer science, but things
like "how can every computer everywhere in the Imperium be vulnerable to
one attack form?" "why hasn\'t the military (e.g.) thought of it before? and
why aren\'t there defences?"  It seems awfully improbable that any attack
form could be developed to the total perfection required to destroy trillions
(quadrillions?) of computers WITHOUT CONCURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF DEFENCES.

Anyway, I won\'t beat that argument any more.  I\'ll grant that with sufficient
ingenuity, a scenario could be devised.

But why? It\'s practically a Law of Nature not to use two explanations when
one would do.  AND YOU ALREADY HAVE TWO PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE EXPLANATIONS,
JUST SITTING THERE.

(1) The Imperium apparently already has a Long Night in its history (I\'m not
    an expert). Why create another one?

but better yet,

(2) practically my first thought on reading the Rebellion Sourcebook was, "how
    the hell can they clean up this mess?". Simple answer: they can\'t. The
    various factions exhaust each other in fighting, contract on themselves
    and abandon vast swathes of space.  Petty empires arise, bombard each
    other, and die, dragging the tech level down.  All organisation fails,
    and gradually Man\'s space presence in these forsaken regions is reduced
    to lone raiders and reavers, preying off of nearly defenceless planets.

Voila, Star Viking.  Practically a historical inevitability, and no viruses
to insult anyone\'s intelligence.  Also, fractured regions of the Imperium
remain, for those who like things the way they were, and in the frontier
reaches, virtually any degree of tech and chaos is possible, for those
who like such things.

It sounds fantastic to me.

First some back ground on me.  I consider myself a wargammer who does RPG\'s. 
Keep this in mind when you flame me.  My latest traveller campain had the players
running a TCL 15 marine platoon.  I used a lot of Striker in the campain.  Anyway
for my problem.  One of the players was something of a munckin and abused
medical slow drug.  To resole that problem I have written the following set of tasks
for use of medical slow drug.  I would like your CONSTRUCTIVE criticism of them. 
Note: I used 7+ instead of routine. (or what ever the word is for a roll of 7+). 
Note I can post my vehicle & robot designs if people are interest, but be warned

      The time of the Slow Drug Reaction is uncertain.
      Without a Diagnosis and Preparation skill roll, a Slow Drug Reaction roll

      For each No Truth result on skill rolls add 1D6 to the failure table.  For each

On AECO Starport/Deepsite:

When I saw this in Invasion: Earth, I always figured that it meant
something like "Africa-Europe Cooperative Organization", since it is
the only starport in the area, and it is in North Africa on the Med.
I really don\'t know for sure, though.

On Zhodani invasion of a weakened Imperium:

I really doubt that the Zho\'s _want_ the Imperium.  Their focus is really
much more to coreward, and the territory and resources they have committed
to that focus is simply staggering.  As it is they have their hands quite
full with the Expeditions.  A total collapse of the Domain of Deneb would
lead to an invasion -- but only one far enough to secure their own borders.
The Frontier Wars have been claimed to be a Zho attempt to get the Imperium
to leave them alone, and not try to move in on them.  Now, they might get
tangled up in a war they don\'t want, but I don\'t think they plan on driving
into Deneb if they can help it.
That\'s not to say that the Aslan, Vargr, and Solomani, as well as anyone
else in the area, won\'t give Imperial conquest a shot....

You\'re right.  Unfortunately, many of us also have time constraints.
I, for instance, have a great deal of catching up to do at work
(having just returned from vacation).

If we really want to provide REASONABLE and CONSISTENT alternatives,
then someone will have to take some time to compile people\'s ideas.

I think that many of us have similar, or at least compatible, ideas
about what to do with Traveller.  If someone would be willing to
look at my ideas and incorporate them into a "proposal" of sorts,
I\'d be willing to put my name on it.  Then, we could present it to
GDW and say "The following x people talked about it and would like
collectively to see these things: ..."

So, would you like to do such a thing?

To get you started, I\'ll name a few of my preferences:

o PROOF-READ it and have a few dozen non-gamers try to learn the rules
  by reading it!!!!!!

o The name "Traveller", or "Traveller, 3rd edition".  No fancy prefixes
  or suffixes or whatever.

o A good task system.  The MegaTraveller system is good (although not
  quite so perfect as some have been claiming recently).  I haven\'t
  seen the T2k2 rules, so can\'t comment on them.

o The Traveller background.  Don\'t totally ditch everything that is
  out there now.  Moving the timeline forwards is OK by me, though.

o A STABLE background.  We don\'t need galactic revolutions taking
  place.  It\'s nice to be able to create campaigns in the official
  universe without having to take such things into account.  It\'s
  OK to have a section of the galaxy in turmoil, but not all of it.
  A Long Night is also OK, since it is at least stable.  It could
  even be preferable, since it allows GMs freedom when designing
  their campaigns.

o Realistic and CONSISTENT science.  This virus thing seems to be
  REALLY stretching it, even if it\'s got abilities such as Iasic of
  the PBEM.  I\'ve got to see it to believe it.  Also, stick to
  conservation of energy.  Even with the OLD Traveller rules, any
  player with a small spaceship could single-handedly decimate a
  world.  Jump drives and grav drives are OK as long as you explain
  them and don\'t get a free ride w.r.t. energy consumption.  Grav
  drives must use as much energy as the difference in gravitational
  potential energy.  Jump drives cannot jump to a higher point of
  potential energy without a commensurate cost.  By the way, this
  is a very good reason why jumps can never be into open space,
  but only into a star system, and wouldn\'t crash you into a star
  or planet.

o Rules for construction of vehicles/spaceships/robots/guns/whatever.
  They don\'t need to be in one place, but this is one aspect of
  Traveller which many people seem to like.  They also MUST be easy
  enough to do without a computer and in a reasonable amount of time.
  This is rather important -- there are many GMs and players who love
  to spend time designing things.  It\'s a form of solo play.

o Keep detailed character generation.  It really adds to the flavor
  of the game.  It\'s also good to have some randomness, although
  this may be optional.  From my experience, random generation of
  characters and character backgrounds leads to better role-playing
  and less munchkinism, even with experienced gamers.

o Don\'t make any one character type or character generation method
  vastly superior to any others (if there are different methods).
  The original Traveller fell into that trap starting with Book 4.

o Don\'t make Traveller or MegaTraveller stuff obsolete.  Provide for
  conversions to the new system.  Where things are changed in the
  new system, don\'t make them so different that you can\'t simply
  "fake it" with old characters/designs/etc.

o Does anyone else out there like the 6-sided dice?  I always
  identified Traveller with 6-siders and the 2d6 bell curves used
  for everything.  I\'m really sorry to see this go.  I mean it.
  The whole feel is different.  Somehow, the fact that you don\'t
  need any special dice or equipment gave Traveller a FEEL unlike
  any other RPG.  It sounds strange, but I think that this really
  makes a difference.

Could someone (please) offer to compile a list of these and other
similar ideas and send them to GDW?  Barring that, I hope someone
will at least forward this to GEnie.  (I really wish they\'d hook
into the Internet.  They should realize that they would actually
be gaining customers, not giving away their services.  Once people
on their net started getting into more and more mailing lists and
such, GE would have more business than they could handle.  And
people would still use GEnie.  The business they gain would vastly
outweigh the few they lose who have both free access and pay for
GEnie.  I doubt they\'d even lose those people.  OK, enough ranting
for now 8-).

they plan or by moving somewhere else or even going back to The Long

able to use the new material in my campaign, which is set in the
Spinward Marches in the year 1113. (Why, I haven\'t even decided yet
if I\'m going to use the Rebellion at all!) A starspanning game
universe needs an inordinate amount of background data and IMO the
Traveller Universe had just about reached an adequate amount  -
at least in the Deneb Domain and a few other places. But apparently
GDW consider the large amount of background data _detrimental_ to
new players\' enjoyment of the game. If that\'s the way their minds
work then I\'m not going to waste my time trying to persuade them to
support my campaign, and I\'m not going to buy any of the new
background material (Now, if they come up with some good rules
and package them seperately, then I\'ll propably buy the rules.
But that\'s another matter.

What I\'m really anxious to know is: Will DGP drop Megatraveller too?
I gather thaty they are not involved in Traveller III, but will they
retain their licence to do Megatraveller stuff? And do they want to?
Or will they switch to that new game of theirs, AI?

One part of my concern about this "virus destroying the centralized CPU
factories of the Imperium" is two-fold.  First, if the Imperium is reliant
enough on computers that their loss would cause a crash, one would think 
that there would be *MANY* production sites -- surely, not all of them
would be seeded.  One would think that elementary concerns about security
and safety of a proprietary production line would lead to the production
CPU being isolated from outside interference and the planetary network,
just to avoid corporate espionage and tradewar sabotage.

Second, the Imperium did have a lesson about the dangers of concentrating
industrial facilities at the end of the Solomani Rim War.  According to
an old Trav.Digest I saw, part of the reason the Imperium was unable to
follow up after Earth was the destruction, by deep-penetration commandos,
of one of their rear-area Industrial worlds.  You see, it had a highly
centralized life-support system for the populace, since it was located on
a hostile world, and the commandos just went in and blew it away. This
might not be common knowlege, but in the 110 years from the war to the
Rebellion, you\'d think that INI, IISS/IB, or IRIS would attempt to suggest
some doctrinal changes to the Emperor, and implement them.

I won\'t be using this virus in any campaign I might run, because it is 
unnecessary and changes the character of Lucan from understandably 
incompetent, if perhaps a bit crazed, to STUPID.  After all, Lucan is the
only "Emperor" who is likely to try this, what with his "Super Weapons"
(gag) and all.  Can anyone see Norris, Brzk, or Margaret trying this?  Or
the mercantilist, conservative Vilani?  (What, destroy our own megacorps!?!)
I don\'t think Dulinor would, simply because he believes so strongly in
improving the lot of those in his Domain.  After all, that\'s how he got
his title.  Would the "Strephon" supporters, or the Brothers of Varian?
Perhaps, since we know so little about them...a darn shame too.  I doubt
it, though.  Or Daibei, a former Sector government?  No.

After all, without a latter-day Arbellatra, the empire will fall all by
itself.  It\'s already halfway there.

      <If you can\'t edit out some of the more offensive messages to

      It almost seems as though Topic 26 has turned into what you
 intended Topic 29 to be.  This seems workable, rather than dumping
 to Topic 3.  But if you have an objection, maybe Rob Dean could
 establish another topic specifically as a GEnie/TML interface.

      A) Have they ever used [T2K], read it, or know anything FIRST
 HAND about it.
      Yes, as a player, not a ref.  Too combat oriented for my tastes.

      B) Do they use the MT task system.
      Definitely.  Its an excellent system, but I won\'t have a tantrum
 if we loose it.

As the person who asked Carl to post the TML messages, I feel responsible. 
Perhaps the solution is to start a separate TML topic, or to post the 
messages in the library. In any case, I am with Carl in that I don\'t want to
read only good remarks...I specifically asked him to give me all comments
about Traveller. I appreciate what Carl and Rob have done for GDW so far, as
all feedback is useful, even highly critical feedback. 
     I take issue with some people\'s remarks, but I find I agree with some
others...

I\'ll be reading it myself. I\'m sorry if I\'ve been sounding terribly pickey
about this because I don\'t want to give the wrong impression. I think that the
TML stuff SHOULD DEFINITELY be posted in this category. Since those folks
can\'t participate in these conversations directly, this is the next best
thing. It also increases the amount of input GDW gets on the new revision
(which is a BIG help I\'m sure). The more voices heard, the more of an overall
look they can get at people\'s perspectives on the subject. My ONLY complaint
is about where the messages are ending up. Most of the stuff seems like it
fits in fine but some of the really vocal folks who have NOTHING positive to
contribute make me cringe because that\'s not why I started this topic. Again,
they should all be heard, but I didn\'t think that this was the place to do it.
Since I seem to be the only one who thinks so though, go ahead and keep
putting them here.

78 Jay: I seem to be one of the few, but I\'ve been there all along through T2k
1st _and_ 2nd, and seem to be one of the very rare few that\'s run it more than
once.  I\'ve also been running MT since it came out.

  I was one of the first to come out against the T2k system...I\'m less wary
now, but still casting a VERY critical eye.  My two main problems have been A)
Its lack of a task system and B) Compatibility of characters -- The UPP is a
nice and simple concept, plus I like the idea of being able to do a
character\'s stats in less than a minute.

  A) is not so much of a problem now, though I\'m still playing around with the
task system Les posted in a DC game I\'ve been running -- I figure if it works
for the original system, it should work when modified for Traveller.  BTW,
I\'ve done some number crunching...I actually like its probabilities more than
the MT task system\'s in a lot of ways.  Be warned: It\'s a linear system of
probabilities instead of on a bell curve: Routine tasks are harder, while
Formidibles and Impossibles are easier.  I\'ll upload a detailed analysis soon.

  B) I\'m not so sure...if we must see a change in basic statistics, I\'d like
to see a simple linear change ie. just add +3 to everything.  I\'m not too sure
if I want to see anything added, though I would like to see a Charisma stat;
Social Standing should be kept, but I\'d like to see it determined by something
else.

Actually, that should probably be put on the wish list: A more realistic
determination of social standing.  With the end of most large interstellar
governments, this will become much more subjective.

RE the Virus: I may have missed something, but my impression was that the
"virus" quickened the collapse, but wasn\'t the cause.  I also got the
impression that this didn\'t get rid of all the computers,only certain ones at
the high TL\'s, say 14-15.  This hurts the real high-tech planets, but doesn\'t
directly effect the majority of mid-range TL planets (Tl 9-12).  It also wipes
a lot of the remaining high tech fleets.

   Most probably it _doesn\'t_ effect non-Imperial computers, and once its
existence is known precautions can be taken.  However, the major damage is
already done.  And every so often, a backwater world gets ahold of a piece of
junk or salvaged computer from one of the higher TL worlds...

    'body' => 'In all this talk of how to improve MegaTraveller, and Traveller, The
New Edition, many of you have stated that you have not seen the
Twilight 2K system. Here is how it works in a nutshell. BTW, I have
only read thru most of the rules, not all of them and it was only one
reading at that.

There are three levels of Difficulty. 

Easy, Normal, and Difficult.

The roll for Easy is your skill level X2 or less. So if you have
Wheeled Vehicle 3 an Easy task would be to roll a 6 or less, on a D10
I believe, I could be wrong about the dice involved.

For a Normal Task the roll is your skill level or less. So in the
above example you would have to roll a 3 or less.

For a Difficult Task, the roll is half your skill level, rounded down. In the above
example you would have to roll a 1 or less.

I think this Elegant in and simple. It is easy for the both the GM
and the players to learn. Someone mentioned that you have no way of
succeeding in something that you don\'t have a skill in. I disagree
with that, this is a role playing game, and the first thing that I
learned about role playing games is that the GM makes the rules.

So I don\'t have the skill to fly that airplane, if I am foolish, or
desparate enough, to try then the GM will have to assign a task such
as possibly my computer skill because I played lots of flight
simulators. Of course with my Computer skill at say five, I only have
a 20% chance of getting that plane off the ground, and probably less
of a chance to land the sucker. I personally think that my own
chances of taking off and landing a plane, would be less than 20% but
then this is a game, not real life, and our characters are the
exceptional people in this world not the normal ones. If we were
playing normal people then this wouldn\'t be role playing it would be
life. :-)

Anyway that is the basic Task system. I like it, I never really liked
MT\'s never could remember which number was for which difficulty
level. Also Combat drove me insane, and who runs all there Traveller
adventures with out combat.

The combat system is just as easy, auto-fire is handled separately.

To hit a Close range it is twice your skill in the weapon that you
are using. 

To hit a medium range it is your skill level.

To hit a long range it is half your skill rounded down.

All weapons do the same damage no matter what the range. The theory
being that with modern weapons you don\'t lose much in power in these
short ranges. We\'re talking for the most part less than 1000 meters.

I forget how to handle body armor, but it is easy, and I understood
it on the first reading. I just can\'t remember and I don\'t have the
book with me.

Auto-Fire is better than the first edition of 2K, but I still think
needs a little work. The way I think it works is you roll the number
of dice and anything that misses is rerolled on adjacent targets.
Like this:

Your auto-fire rate is 5 that means that you roll 5 d6, every 6 you
roll is a hit on the primary target, any dice that are not 6\'s are
rerolled and any 6 in that group is a hit on an adjacent target. What
limits auto-fire is the recoil rate of the machine gun being fired.
If you are stronger then it is easier to control the recoil of the
gun. I don\'t know if this is the way it is in real life, I have only
shot a .22 at tin cans, and a shotgun, also at a tin can. I am sure
that if it is not like real life, someone will tell me. :-)

 it would help if you kept the old MT naming systems for difficlty though as has
been pointed out \'average\' can be misleading.

2) More modules! and I say again more Modules! The two (count them! 2) that were
produced for MT were good, if you can keep the quality and up the numbers then
so much the better.

3) I have said this before and I\'ll repeat it again Why not let us poor schmucks
know what is going on in the universe ahead of time? By which I mean a GM can
plan out a campaign ahead of time without having it upset by TAS that comes out
during the campaign, this way TAS can be figured in as part of the ongoing 
flavour eg. To take a rebellion example if my party were on Antares they could
find out about the nova prediction 1st hand from a scientist BUT it would help
if the GM knew there was going to BE a prediction so he could set it up.
y\'know "foreshadowing"...... the mark of quality literature?
 The 2300 example being the Kafer war books being out so\'s a GM can run the 
war at his own pace without running out of info halfway.

4) A more convincing long night inducer than the DV.
   but I supose needs must when profit drives....... Sorry I am being unfair, it
is probably a well thought out idea BUT from the "trust us we know best" type
comments from the Mob in charge it is hard to make a fair assessment (and THEY
can\'t tell so\'s not to spoil the surprise... right lads?).

5) If the number 13.5 crops up quite as often in neo trav\' as MT there may be
a good few of the local Roleplaying fraternity coming over to the states with
large quantities of bacon fat! PLEASE PLEASE make sure the ship design system
is easier to use! Maybe (as has been put forward) a simple fast\'n\'dirty way and
a long\'n\'precise way to achieve similar results, that way you can knock up a 
quick trader type in half an hour (with no computer aid!) and for that extra 
special adventure hook ship that little bit of extra effort......

6)  The deadlyish nature of MT combat is Ok but from my experience of 2300
that system is it is a trifle more realistic, so maybe that system would be
an asset & one one my moans in MT is the lack of a decent hit location and 
damage system (mind you with a PGMP who cares!)

7) More aliens! The galaxy is BIG and the imperium can\'t be the only large 
state maybe a few new neighbours, the rimward borders for example now THAT
would quiet the Solomani down a bit wouldn\'t it!??! 
And if there are new aliens make them as good as the Hivers or K\'kree,
like actually ALIEN (unlike the pseudo samurai moggies from kuzu).
How about the Primordials from Knightfall? more evidence of them..... new
sites to explore and puzzle at..... (I am toying with using my Gurps Uplift
book for a similar purpose)

been mulling over a few things.....

1) The sexual mores of various races for a start.
It is fair to exclude K\'Kree,Hivers and most other non humanoids from this but
has anyone wondered what the base racial attitudes to sex etc. IS for various
races?
  Eg. The leonine Aslan who if they are ecologically like lions will have a part
of the year when females are insatiable, an interseting possiblity in so rigid
a soceity, the social saftety valve could be some ritual.
 Or Vilani whose soceity might suggest some high degree of prudery (don\'t ask me
why but thats my impression) with again some outlet in soceity.
 The total honesty of Zhodani soceity lends itself to all sorts of setups espec-
ially among the psionic classes, a good example to look at are the Darkover
books By M.Zimmer-Bradley.
  
2) The cop out of the imperium having cultural postulates of Tech 8 earth......
Which bit exactly? Middle class America? East end of London slums? Arab Shieks?
try acting out the postulates of one of those in the other situation and see 
where THAT gets you! Ok so it\'s a conveinience for us (mainly) European/Us
 priveleged (eg.able to afford games) types to be able to play it But the
year is 5400+ things change! 5000 years ago most peoples ancestors were into
\'cultural postulates\' a wee bit different from now! Even 20 years ago......
Not all traveller characters are going to have the same basic viewpoint on
life just like even near neighbours on earth.

3) How interfertile are most human races? the kind of havoc 240,000 years of
different selective pressures will have played with fertility between Hom. sap
sub species..... Ok so tech 15 fiddling could put it right but it\'ll cost to
have kids.

4) The starship crew lifestyle is worth thinking about, hardly ever on your 
homeworld... in lose quarters with the same crew for often years, the kind of
Starship-starport subculture that could spring up. One of my party see\'s the 
universe as a procession of bars where the drinks and licensing laws are all 
that change.  The kind of bond a small ship crew can form esp. a warship like
a t-type, gazelle or fiery and the fact that the trav\' universe is apparantly
an equal opportunities employer meaning sex ratios are roughly equal.  I have
a party that is 60% female human 30%male human and 10%vargr female and that
is an entertaining mixture.

5) Re: the players wanting to \'dirty\' things with their PC\'s? how many of you
get that? Mine don\'t incidently (of my player group 3 are female 5 male and
males play women females also play men).  Not a terribly relevent point but  
I thought I\'d ask while I was on the subject. I find MT and Sf gaming seems
less prone to a that sort of thing than fantasy which I have seen get a bit
\'quaff and wench\'  maybe it is the civilised nature of imperial soceity that
makes that kind of \'lecher gaming\' impractial? Anyone willing to comment?

    'body' => 'Hi folks,

Ok, here we go:
Here are a few areas where the MegaTrav design system is off by
orders of magnatude.  These are things I would like to see
corrected in a revision of Traveller.

Fission/Fusion/Antimatter fuel requirements.
- ----
A few days ago I put out a note about how bad the fuel
requirements for a fission reactor are.  Well, I looked up the
actual figures and here we are:

The N.S. Savannah, (world\'s first [only?] nuclear merchantmant)
carried 49 kg of uranium fuel.  According to the article, this
would power the reactor at 80%-20knots for 300,000Nm.  15,000 hrs
at 20.1MW output.  According to MegaTrav rules that same reactor
would burn 7537.5 metric TONS!  Now I don\'t mind a factor of 2
error here and there between freinds but that is FIFTEEN MILLION
percent error!
(source: Aug 1962 National Geographic "Aboard the N.S. Savannah")

Ok, now how do we revise this without throwing every traveller
fusion reactor out the door in the revision?

Answer:  Simple.  Fusion reactors don\'t burn Hydrogen, they burn
Tritium/Deuterium (hydrogen isotopes).  It is present in the
hydrogen fuel but in extremely small quantities.  (No I don\'t
have the figures with me... {Metlay?})  This could account for
the discrepancies in fuel consumption/energy output.

Jump drives make use of hydrogen for cooling as well as a power
source.  Thus they need the extra hydrogen in the mix.

Advantage of this idea:  Now, one could fill a starship\'s fuel
tanks with deuterium/tritium and have 1000+ times the endurance
for the power plant.  (refined deuterium & tritium would of
course COST a lot more, but military ships could afford it.)

Of course they would still need to carry jump fuel, and dumping
deuterium and tritium into the jump drive when hydrogen will do
would be expensive!  But that would explain why hydrogen was
used.

(Please note:  With the above change in fuel consumption: ie
vastly reduced fission fuel consumption, fission powered
starships are indeed feasable within the MegaTrav design system. 
I have put a few onto the TML and they should be available from
the TML vehicle archives.  I created a minor-{major?} argument
when I pointed out that a Nuclear Damper should be able to
increase the output of a fission reactor dramatically by speeding
up the fission reaction.  Anyone interested in this see the
"Highguard" Class experimental cruiser in the TML archives)

Of course this makes the anti-matter fuel consumption stuff look
absolutely rediculous... But I haven\'t seen anyone use it.  I
tried a brief experiment and saw that a TL 16 fusion plant was
much more desirable.  In any case, changing the Anti-Matter
consumption isn\'t going to ruin anybody\'s day.  I haven\'t seen a
single design that used it.

Batteries:
- ----
The batteries are much too expensive.  I have turned out a few
Diesel/Electric submarines (using a similar system to the
recently published Wet Navy) and the subs ended up costing about
as much as a heavy Battlecruiser of the same Tech level.  (a U.S.
Fleet type sub cost as much as the Graf Spee!) This was due
solely to the cost of the batteries.

Admittedly, I\'m not sure of the power it stores, but the battery
in my car is about 5 liters in volume and cost me $25.  Well a 5
liter battery in MegaTrav costs about 1500 Cr.  Something is
Wrong here!

Ok, now the battery table is converted from Book 8 Robots.  So,
I\'d guess that the writers figured these were high storage/light
weight/small size/high quality batteries to fit inside a very
sophisticated electronic device.

Perhaps, there should be a chart of batteries meant for large
storage as opposed to high quality?  After all, filling a
diesel/electric sub with camera batteries is going to be Quite
expensive...

Maximum Speed
- ----
Has anybody looked at the max speed table?  The thrust/weight
ratio and it\'s correspondance to maximum speed is WAY off.  I
strongly suggest that the people revising the stuff take a look
at the actual thrust to weight ratio\'s of aircraft.
(all speeds below are in kilometers per hour)

Thrust/Wt	Aircraft	Speed	MegaT	COACC
..2G		C-135A		965	240	240
..3G		A-6		1100	360	360
..4G		F-5		1700	480	480
..5G		F-8		1930	600	600
..6G		F-105		2235	720	720
..7G		F-106		2455	840	840
..8G		F-14		2485	960	960
..9G					1080	1080
1G		F-15		2655	1200	1200
2G					2120	2000
3G		X-15		7274	2850	3000
4G					3400	3200
5G					3840	3750
6G					4200
(Note that the SR-71\'s thrust to weight ratio is .3824 max speed
is unknown but around 3100 kph {Bertil?})
(The X-15 thrust/wt ratio is about 1.15 increasing to 3.3 as fuel
is burned)
(I complied a list of thrust to weight vs max speed which anyone
is welcome to, just ask)

In the light of the above, I think grav vehicles and starships
max speed should be VASTLY higher than they are.  COACC\'s
aircraft engines have vastly exaggerated thrusts listed, and so
that the aircraft\'s speed comes out about right.  But any 1G
merchant ship should be about Mach 2+, and any grav vehicle/ship
with an excess thrust of 3G would be about as fast as the X-15! 
(Mach 6+!!)

Rate of Fire
- ----
Wet Navy/Design and stuff.  The Rate of Fire for big guns is off. 
Perhaps the Ref\'s handbook doesn\'t take the loading equipment in
a turret into account, but according to what I have found about
the Bismark, and other TL 6 heavily armed ships, the ROF of a
38cm gun should be 2 rounds per minute, not 1/4; ROF of the 28cm
is also 2 rnds/min, not 1/4, and the ROF of a 20cm gun should be
3 rnds/min not 1.
This of course is only a minor quibble...

If we can hammer these out this revision would really be great!

Falicitations,
Scott S. Kellogg

PS.	One extremely minor quibble:  Challenge 54 gives us a whole
lot of new weapons (YEA!  TL 2 Cannons at last!  Yippee!)  But it
doesn\'t give us the prices.  A missile launcher weighs 110% of
weight of missile... but no cost or volume.  A torpedo tube takes
up 110% of the volume of the torpedo, but no weight or cost...

Anybody out on GEnie have those figures?

PPS.	The TDR folks had an idea which makes sence:  Have the
chassis damage points of a vehicle be related to the weight of
the chassis.  Thus a heavily armored chassis would be able to
take more low penetration damage than a light one of the same
size.  (The example was one of school bus vs. main battle tank)
But I don\'t know much about it.  {Rob can you give us a run down
on it?}

Thanks,
Mr. Scott

	Well, DGP is putting all the plans they have on MT on hold.
They are even selling all MT manuscripts, drawings, etc they have to other
people. They do still have the license, but that\'s about it. 

	MTJ #3 is their last MT product, I think.

similar to earlier ones from him -- James]

Okay I have a few general questions on character generation .....

1) The Mercenary

- - What assignments can a mercenary character be promoted on ?
The book says on all the assignments NOT listed in paratheses, however
none of them are listed in paranthses .

- - The rules assume the character joins the imperial army . Yet he would
not be able to fly grav vehicles if he came from a tech 9 planet or less .
This does not make sense . Are the rules assuming that the imperial 
government lower thier tech levels of the military depending on what world
thier garrison is on ? The americans certainly did not do this in vietnam !

- - Why cannot the character belong to the army of his homeworld ? Or why
not the security forces of a megacorp ? 

- - The referee\'s companion state that tech 14+ planets arm and equip thier
troops with battledress and energy weapons . Yet the only way battledress
skill is gained is if the character is a commando, or a marine on ships
troops . Why not say instead that a character from a tech 14+ world gain the
battledress skill in place of vacuum suit on the infantry MOS skill table .

- - The rebellion sourcebook states the imperial garrison numbers (average)
for member worlds . But those (on average) with a pop of 4- dont have any ? 
Does this mean the character cannot join the army ?

- - The mercenary assignments table gives basic descriptions of assignments 
Does this mean the assignments assume the following ?

Police Action : Garrison from planet is stationed on another world eg : 
US marines in vietnam .

Counter Insurgency : Worlds garrison fighting against rebellion or civil 
strife ?

Raid : A \'war\' situation ?

Internal Security : ???

2) Merchants 

- - The merchant character has no access to increase his stats of Str, End,
Dex, and Int (Dex if he were not a FT) . He gains no access to Jack Of All
Trades Skill . He has no access to naval architecture . Why not do the 
following . 

Replace Carousing (gained with a roll of 2 on the life table) with Physical 
Replace Blade Combat (gained with a roll of 2 on the shipboard table) with
hand combat . 
Replace + 1 Edu (Life : 5) with Mental
Replace CCarousing (Life : 6) with the skill branch which allows you too
choose from Leader, JOT, Instruction, and Carousing (Sorry dont have my 
book here) .

3) Naval Characters

- - When can naval characters get promoted ? 

4) Marines

- - Do marines function at the tech level thier base is stationed on or 
at tech 14/15 ?

5) Other Races 

- - What differences are thier between humanti, Aslan, Vargr etc when making
up a character, and what bonuses do thier races gain ? (Please dont say
none cause thats pretty shallow !!) 

6) Scouts

- - What justification is there in giving a member of the tech branch a
scout ship ?

- - Do high ranking IISS members gain a bonus mustering out ?

7) Can brownie points be spent on mustering out rolls ? I say yes cause
it allows hopless characters (such as those who have an Int:2) build up
stats (depending on the roll), but this can be abused eg a rank E2 merchant
getting a vessel ? 

8) Can brownie points be spent \'At any time\' . eg a character gained a 
level 3 heavy weapons skill (by rolling a 4 on the command table) . But at the
ebd of the characters generation he wants to have leader skill so he spends a
brownie point to upgrade it to leader ? 

9) Can you spend a brownie point to gain a special mission and recieve a 
brownie point for it ?

10) Do scouts gain a brownie point for training/special/war missions . Do
merchants gain it for having bonuses ?

Thats about all I can think of . I have access to the errata published
already but they dont cover the thinks I wanted to know . 

Please If you have any comment, no matter how small please tell me 

Edmund

DGP is definitely dropping support of MegaTraveller, according to the latest
on GEnie.  I should go back and post the note from a few days ago, in which 
they state _That they are looking for a buyer for their files_.  Dropping
it, and then throwing out the pieces it seems.  All DGP efforts will be
devoted to A.I.  )-:  I just got my copy of Cats and Rats last night.  What
a loss...I was especially saddened to see a projected Vol. 5 for minor
races advertised.

Edmund,

A lot of your questions are indicative of the proofreading in
MegaTraveller.  MT was written by Traveller experts for Traveller
experts, and was never really shaken out.  So, as a self-appointed
Traveller expert, I usually observe these little inconsistencies and
decide what *I* would do with them.  I\'ll shoot from the hip without my
sources today.  To wit...

I figure anyone in an interstellar organization can learn skills at the

Because this is a fine detail not included in the rules.  Feel free to
take a few liberties to set this up on your own, based on the Imp. Army
character generation.

Population indicates the civilian RESIDENTS of a planet, not military or
transient population.  So, a system with a resident population of 16
people could still support a garrison of a few thousand troops.  It\'s
just that there won\'t be a lot of movies or shopping for the troops to
induldge in, off-duty.

Sound good to me.

Military Police?

Sounds good to me.

I go with the latter.

Refer to the ethnic sourcebooks for the races.  Vargr, for instance, do
not even have a Social attribute - they have a related attribute instead
that indicates their relative influence in Vargr society.  I think there
are some additional adjustments.

I don\'t think so.

I haven\'t used them for this, but I could be wrong...

I don\'t use it this way.  I feel it needs to be applied at the time the
roll is made.

I would probably allow this.

Dunno.

I\'m running a naval campaign in which the players are officers and crew
on an Imperial warship. When I started I thought a bit about what rules
the Navy would have about shipboard interpersonal relationships. What I
came up with was \'Rule 37\':

        "The formation of close emotional bonds detrimental to the
        discipline and efficiency of the ship is punished by..."

This puts the burden squarely on the ship\'s captain. If he says something
is allowed, then it is allowed. If he forbids anything, then it\'s forbidden.
The catch is that if anything _does_ go wrong, then it\'s his responsibility
too. Note that the rule includes, but is not limited to, sexual relations.
I also decided that over the years several rules of thumb had been arrived at:

        1) Relationships between people directly above and below
           each other in the chain of command is problematical.

        2) Relationships between people with too disparate rank
           is problematical.

        3) Relationships between people with approximately the
           same length of service is less problematical (So an
           officer and a CPO would probably be OK, as long as
           they weren\'t in the same line of command).

I\'ve never had occasion to use this though. The thoughts of my players
dosen\'t seem to run that way. They\'re more interested in blasting pirates
and getting promoted!

But of course...I\'ll append the appropriate sections of "TDR Vehicle
Design V1.1" below.  The basic idea is, as Scott says, that the current
damage point system is easy, but strange.  An M-1 tank is smaller
than a school bus, therefore it is easier to destroy in MT, where damage
points are equal to hull volume in kl divided by 6.  When I made up the
rule suggestion below, I arbitrarily decided that 1 ton of weight should
be exchanged for 1 kl in the old system...probably because the default
weight of any object in MT is 1ton/kl.  This would have the effect of making
a heavier object harder to destroy than a light object of the same volume.
The reason that the numbers below use /1.5 and * 1.7 instead 
of /15 and /6 is an errata which said that damage values
should be multiplied by ten for use in personal combat (by which they meant
everything except the High Guard derived starship combat system).  You\'ll
see that /1.5 = /15 *10 and *1.7 = /6 * 10 (rounded off).

COACC is a terrible offender in this regard, and I recommended using a weight
based approach to aircraft damage (cribbed from Striker, where else?) at
the same time.

        This section can be retained as is, with the following excep-
        tions.  
        
        Damage:  Calculate based on weight, not volume.  Also figure in 
        the factor of ten for personal combat rules to allow more differ-
        entiation of vehicles at lower sizes.  So new hull values become 
        Weight/1.5 (inoperative) and Weight*1.7 (Destroyed).  Values for 
        power plant and locomotion are figured as before, on a percentage 
        of the weight rather than the volume.
        


Well, that\'s all there was to it...

easily get behind something close to this if it had slightly more
resolution.  That is: everyday=85% (of die used), routine=75%,
normal=50%, difficult=25%, formidable=15%  (success percentages)
or something like this.

Here\'s the reasoning:  I, as a GM, want to know, by looking at the
roll, just how badly mangled the task was.  This can affect the
outcome.  "Oh no Fred! The reactor is starting to run away! -
Fred\'s player rolls a (whatever) and *almost* shuts it down. -
Okay, it\'s going out of control and you now have ten minutes to
get yer party as far upwind as they can manage."  Rather than 
letting his slip of the control knob destroy the party utterly.

Otherwise, GDW might just be right in using dice with more sides.
As much as I like the simple 2D6 profile, more resolution would be
really nice.  Especially in the Trade and Commerce Rules.

** What\'re the goal and status with Trade and Commerce? **
I\'m especially interested in this part of the new design, and offer
any and all info and assistance I can give.


Finally -- Virus...
Yecch.  It\'s not that it\'s such a repugnant idea (although it is 
to me).  It\'s that it\'s totally unneccessary.  The fall has come.
It is probably irreversible.

Unless you are using this as a way to introduce a superior computer
technology that doesnt take 10 tons of volume for a ship...  I\'d
support that in the drop of a pin.

Keep struggling.

    'body' => 'I just finished reading Greg\'s post about the TW2k system and since I have
been actively playing it since it came out I figured I\'d clarify a few items
and put my own comments in.

If you aren\'t interested in the Twilight:2000 system you should skip this
message.

Overall I like the game very much because it does a good job dealing with
the activity most likely to kill a character, combat.  Of the remaining
activities, in any good game, 90% can be resolved by the GM without the need
to consult any rules.  And let\'s face it, a good GM is what makes or breaks
a game.

My first requirement for a rule system is playability.  Realism, however
cannot just be thrown out the window, the game has to basically \'feel\' right.

That said, a few things about the Greg\'s post that could use a little
clarification.

To hit determination: there are two types of shot: "quick" or "aimed"
aimed shots make the task one level easier.  All shots are considered
quick unless the character uses the preceeding phase to aim.

Example: given a character with skill 7 in a weapon. Roll 1d10, a 10 is always
a miss, a 1 is always a hit.

Shot type	Range
		Close	Medium	Long	Etc.
Aimed		14	7	3		(round to nearest & .5 = 0)
Quick		 7	3	2

Recoil:
All weapons have 1 or 2 recoil values.  1 for single shot(SS) recoil and
another for recoil when firing a burst, if the weapon is capable.
You take the total number of shots fired in a round times the individual
recoil value to get a total recoil.  If the total recoil is greater than the
characters strength, you subtract the difference from the to hit die roll.
Example: recoil of M16A2 SS is 3. Fire 3 shots for total recoil =9. Character
strength of 7 results in a -2 on all to hit rolls in round.

Damage: In the first edition of TW2k weapon damage used to drop off with
range.  In the second edition they just left the number constant. I like
it, much more playable.

Auto weapons fire: Weapons capable of automatic weapons fire have a Rate Of
Fire(ROF) value: standard values are: 10, 5 & 3.  Ignoring recoil for the
moment, this is the number of d6\'s you roll at close range. Each \'6\' that 
comes up means 1 hit on target.  Half of all remaining dice rolled are rolled
again if there are any other targets adjacent to primary target, again \'6\'s
hit.  Modifiers: each range band reduces the number of d6\'s rolled by: 3,2,1
respectively, minimum of 1; total recoil greater than strength reduces number
of dice by difference, 1/6th hit chance stays same.


Problems with the system:
A supplement, Infantry Weapons of the World(IWW), is available and fixes some
of the weapon statistics problems and introduces some of it\'s own.

IWW finally makes pistols deadly, previous damage numbers were so low that
  no character would use one.
IWW adds the "instant kill rule". Simply put characters can now die from
  smaller arms with just one shot.
IWW`s problems: It gives the formulas used to calculate damage and recoil
  values and then goes on to use numbers that don\'t fit the formulas given.
  Inconsistent damage numbers: ie M16A1 does 2 dice damage while M16A2 does 3.

Some skills should have an initial level based on the characters attributes.
The worst situation we\'ve run into is the thrown weapon skill when using a
grenade.  Basic military skill give you a level 1 in the skill.  According to
a strict interpretation of the rules, throwing a grenade successfully, ie
threw a window 10 feet away requires a roll of 1 on a d10.  This means that
90% of the time the grenade hits the wall and doesn\'t go through the window.
PC\'s stopped using grenades for a while since standing 10 feet from one was
not healthy.

Shotguns: uhhh, "interesting", nuff said.

Anyone who wishes to discuss the TW:2000 system is encouraged to email me.

    'body' => 'Here\'s some of my thoughts on what needs revision in Traveller.
 
- - Dice: using 2d6 is an interesting concept from wargaming. It works
  ok but I prefer the percentile method (d100). It allows for all 
  sorts of adjustments better than 2d6.

- - Character generation: incomplete. The generation system needs to 
  be refined. College is one of my biggest complaints. Four years and
  all a character gets is MAYBE an EDU +1! This leads to my second
  complaint, skills. Classic Traveller, the way I see it, was designed
  with roleplaying as the main point in the game. The few skills that
  are there just add a little variety. It was up to the GM to resolve
  character actions and it worked. Then other RPG\'s were developed and
  brought with them skills buy the bucketfull (e.g. Rolemaster). Now
  MegaTraveller came out but didn\'t know which way to go. So you get
  a task system, a few more skills and still trying to merge old concepts
  with the new but it doesn\'t work very well. If you\'re going to add 
  skills then add skills. Granted the example cited above goes overboard
  but it helps shape the character. So when a character goes to college 
  at least something is learned. And the same goes for graduate school 
  (which isn\'t in the system now, anyway). How are Ph.D.\'s created? Not 
  very easily by MT! In Classic Traveller a skill of 1 actually meant 
  something, 2 was very good and 3 was outstanding (it also conferred
  a medical degree to doctor characters). In MT skills of 4,5, 6, etc
  are common. And still using the 2d6 system!

  Character generation is one of the high points to the game. The 2nd
  MT computer game is great for developing characters. Now all that\'s
  needed is to include other races and there career choices as well. 

  If there is going to be an advanced generation method then include 
  the other career types, not just the basic 4. 

  Most non-military careers start with a college education.
  
  What about skills from high school! Wasn\'t anything learned, tech
  skills, academic skills. Might be pushing it but characters are not
  run of the mill. 

  Drop Education and Social Standing as characteristics. They are 
  conditions not attributes (as an aside, I use 13 attributes to
  describe characters in my games, 6 physical and 7 mental). So, add
  other characteristics that describe a character not something that
  is influenced by outside sources. Or, better yet, develop a class of
  secondary characteristics (actually conditions) that are used to
  expand the generation process.

- - Task systems are needed in any game that allows for a character to
  do any type of research or analysis. I have yet to find one that I
  really like. The MT task system is as good as any I have seen so far.

- - Combat. Again I have yet to find one I really like. In MT why have
  a skill for a weapon if you make a task out of using it.

- - Equipment design. Having an all encompassing system is nice but very
  unwieldly and looses some of its flavor. Split design into separate
  areas: computers, robots, starships, ground/air/water vehicles, weapons,
  etc. Current designs follow their own rules that sometimes don\'t make
  sense. Energy use being one of them, other aspects of physics too.

- - Pat answers such as "It\'s best for the game." or "Because that\'s the
  way it is." show poor salesmanship. Rational explanations get better
  converts.

- - Traveller Universe. One area that I find troublesome is economics. In
  In a universe that has limited communications how does credit work?
  Or electronic funds transfers? Seems like an easy way to counterfeit.
  Better explanations on existing aspects of the universe need to be
  done. This is a general statement that needs to be stressed. Everyday
  workings are not very well described and need to be improved. 

- - Modules collating existing published information. I would love to
  see a complete compilation of the Traveller News Service that appears
  in Challenge. The same goes for equipment. Background information on
  people, planets, systems, etc.  A 3-Ring binder format would work 
  very well.

- - Get a real editor. Not to be sarcastic but proofing has been poor.

     Since no GDW rep has had anything to say (Trust us, you\'ll like it) for
a number of days, I\'m not sure if they are reading any of this.  I wouldn\'t
say that they are exactly receiving overwhelming support.

     You know, I just fully realized this evening (as I was reading my Classic
Traveller Book 3) that by the time that GDW changes the rules system and 
the background, there is no reason left for them to use the name Traveller
except to capitalize on whatever good will they have left.  (And since I think
that we old Traveller grognards _are_ what good will is left, I don\'t think
it will work.)

     By the reasoning that they are using at GDW, 2300AD was really the same
game as Twilight:2000 (1st edition)--they had about as much in common as
our Traveller is going to have with New Traveller.  Scary, isn\'t it...or
maybe just sad.

     Okay, I\'ve been reading along here, trying to form my opinion about
what\'s going on. First, let me give a little background about me. 
     I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1980 with no breaks. I own just about
everything published by GDW, DGP, Judge\'s Guild (well, it was official at the
time!), and Seeker. Aside from an occasional round playing AD&D, Traveller is
the only game I play. It\'s also the only RPG I own.
     I am trying to keep an open mind about what is going on. I am personally
adopting more of a wait and see attitude. I\'ll try to organize my thoughts
around the themes that have been circulating here on GEnie and in HIWG, with a
little of the TML concerns in here also (I have only read what TML stuff has
been u/l here recently).

TRUSTING GDW
     Unfortunately, I can\'t honestly say that I do. My personal dealings with
GDW have been _very_ negative. I find it hard to believe that GDW is really
willing to listen (as opposed to pretending and doing what they want anyway)
when they refuse to answer inquiries concerning published articles. It took
six months to get payment for an article I wrote. My three snail mail letters
were ignored! (It took a lot of GEnie email to get this straightened out --
I shudder to think about what would have happened if I weren\'t on GEnie. I
never have figured out what happened and GDW didn\'t send any letter of
explanation or apology, just a check in an envelope five months late.) Now
they expect me to trust them??? And we all agree that recent Traveller
publications leave a lot to be desired. 
     I was very disappointed with the Rebellion setting, particularly
disliking all of the unknowns that this introduced. It just got to be too much
to handle. The Rebellion has shown us that there really isn\'t anybody left in
the hierarchy of the Imperium that can be trusted. Intrigue and excitement are
what the game needed; darkness, conspiracy, and political stupidity are what
GDW delivered.

NEW PLAYERS
     GDW believes that they need a new influx of players to Traveller in order
to continue supporting the game. I can\'t comment on this because I have no
real feel for how many people play Traveller, or any other game, to compare it
to. I\'ll grant them the fact that attracting new players means more money and
I don\'t begrudge them trying to make a credit or two.
     I, too, would like to see new players. I\'d be interested to know how much
Traveller picked up when GDW changed the name. However, I\'m not sure how loyal
the classic Traveller fans will be to this new game. GDW is going to have to
gamble that they pick up enough new players to offset the classic players that
won\'t buy the new game. Which leads me to my next point....

T2K2 RULES
     I am vehemently opposed to this change for several reasons. First, no
conversion from classic to \'neo\' Traveller can take into account the nuances
that the old system gave our characters. The two systems are different!
     Second, if I, as a Traveller player, had wanted to play with T2K rules,
then I would be a T2K player not a Traveller player. I don\'t agree that T2K
\'is better.\'  Yes, it\'s different, but both systems have their strong and weak
points and *I* like Traveller\'s system better than T2K.
     This has been a topic of discussion recently in my group. The consensus
reached was that we would probably end up converting \'neo Traveller\' rules to
fit into classic Traveller. We probably aren\'t going to bother buying into the
new game rules. We will make independent judgements about the support material
that will presumably follow.
     Fortunately, the ability to take another system and make it fit Traveller
(and I mean the classic Traveller here) is part of what has made the game so
much fun over the years. Back in the spring of 1981, before there were any
\'official\' sectors published, I rolled up my own complete sector -- all the
worlds, starports, x- boat routes -- and have continued to fill in details
over eleven years. (In fact, my original sector was only 3x3 subsectors. I was
doing this on the fly and had no info to the contrary. Then GDW published
something, don\'t remember what, that said a sector was 4x4 subsectors. So I
rolled up another 7 subsectors to fit!) This is the sector that I use for my
solitaire playing. My group has used the \'official\' stuff because then we all
have equal access to the information printed.
     GDW\'s talk about making their system generic to their product line will
only make all of their games look alike and play alike. One of the ideas of
having a game is the uniqueness that it has when playing it. Making similar
rules over fairly different games/backgrounds will take away much of the
flavor of different games. This idea is akin to a restaurant that serves only
one dish, but \'the spices are different.\' It\'ll have a different flavor, but
will still be the same dish.
     GDW is fooling itself if they think people are buying 2300 and T2K
because of the character generation system. HA! Most people who buy the game
are getting it because of the background and/or basic premise of the game.
Since they come in a sealed box, how does a buyer (particularly a new gamer,
which is what GDW wants to attract) know what system is good and what isn\'t
before he/she spends several hours studying and playing with these new rules?
What sells the game is advertising and word of mouth, both of which have not
been very good for Traveller of late. With no advertising to speak of, and
poorly edited/written material, Traveller has suffered greatly. It\'s only the
die-hards like us that have kept the game alive and brought what few new
players there are into the game. For example, my local hobby shops have
posters of T2K and 2300, but none for Traveller. Why?

LOSING MARC AND JOE (et al)
     I\'m very disappointed that Traveller has lost the two people who have
probably meant the most during the first fifteen years of its existence: Marc
Miller and Joe Fugate (and the rest of DGP). It\'s seems to opportune that Marc
leaves and Traveller is scheduled to be changed into T2K with another name.
Joe\'s comment says much of the same thing that I\'m thinking, that the upheaval
caused by and/or around Marc\'s departure will mean lean times for Traveller
players. I also am skeptical of GDW\'s commitment to Traveller now that Marc is
gone as opposed to when he was there to champion the game himself.

TRAVELLER IN THE NEW ERA (Dave Nilsen\'s comments)
     Dave says, \'...Traveller is back!\' As far as I\'m concerned it didn\'t go
anywhere (pun intended). That is, I\'m still playing it as are many others, and
GDW didn\'t support us much during the last couple of years. Now, all of a
sudden, here they are telling us they are willing to listen to us as they
prepare another onslaught of new rules (instead of what we really want, which
is well written and edited _extended_ rules and more background/adventures).
On the other hand, they tell us that they\'ve already decided to change the
game in the most major way you can change a game, i.e. the character system
and they won\'t except any inputs here. As far as I\'m concerned, I\'d rather
they call their new game something else and leave Traveller well enough alone!
     I\'d like to know how many letters GDW has received in the last couple of
years begging them to change Traveller to the T2K system. My bet is *zero*. I
haven\'t seen much to substantiate the rumor that the T2K system is _better_
than the Traveller system. They are different, and everyone has their likes
and dislikes, but I hate it when someone comes along and tells *me* that \'THIS
IS BETTER.\' In my experience, this is usually the opening speech of someone
who doesn\'t know what they are talking about or is out for a cheap thrill.
Soon after the whole thing collapses like a black hole, never to be heard
about again.
     I think Dave is out in left field when he says "...will not require you
to buy time on the MIT mainframe to generate a fleet of starships." Maybe Dave
can\'t generate a ship without a computer, but I can. Rob Dean has generated
over 300!!!!! He also says that starship combat will be more fun and detailed.
This is also an opinion that has absolutely no substantiation behind it. Fun
is a relative term, like better!
     I also definitely get the feeling that Dave *is not* reading the same
GEnie and TML notes that I\'m reading. Most of what I hear is against a major
change such as GDW proposes. I\'d like more detail about how Dave thinks that
they are \'right on target.\' It sounds to me like we may be looking at two very
different targets (both moving diametrically opposed in opposite directions!)


     Now that I\'ve got that out of my system, I will say that I will consider
the new system if I think that it improves the game that I like to play. If it
doesn\'t, then I won\'t buy it. My decision will be based on the merits of the
system and the reviews that I read. I will definitely *not* buy it as soon as
it hits the shelves! After the last couple of years I\'m much to gunshy for
that.
     It\'s also too bad that GDW thinks that they have to support the move to
the darker themes that seem prevalent in today\'s RPGs. I, for one, play
Traveller for precisely the opposite reason, i.e. the escape from the real
world into a world of fun and exploration, not one worse off than the one I
live in now. 
     I think GDW is still shying away from the very thing that made D&D a hit
when it came out: playing aliens is fun. Every time we get close to having
enough info to really play aliens well, the system collapses and we have to
start all over. They seem to get close to where we, the players, want to go
and then say "Ooops, here\'s something BETTER FOR YOU! All you have to do is
buy all these new books, read all this new background." 
     GDW, why don\'t you try learning from TSR. D&D (all versions) support
several different backgrounds in pretty much the same universe. The Traveller
universe is also big enough for all of us too. My suggestion is to move the
new Traveller somewhere else while maintaining support for classic Traveller
as well (like TSR). Otherwise I\'m afraid that you will kill Traveller, or at
best make it into Twilight: 5700.
     Thanks for listening (reading) this diatribe. I feel much better now,
don\'t you?
     All together now, nice and loud.....

TRAVELLER........"

<<<Faint rustling from the electronic bushes as a lurker moves into the
light>>>

  I\'ve been following the discussion here for some time, both before and after
this big revision talk started, and I thought  I would join in and put in my

  First, a bit of background.  I\'ve been playing Traveller/MegaTraveller since
1977, and I figure in that time I\'ve averaged about one game a week.  My
current campaign has been in operation for over 25 years of  game time, and
that doesn\'t include various side adventures and campaigns. I have been
running tournaments at conventions for 8 years now.  In the real world, I am
an engineer designing control systems for an electrical utility.

  Having said that, how do I feel about MT v2.0?  First, what parts of the
MegaTraveller system would I like to keep?

   1)  The Skill/Task system.

  I could live without just about everything else.  I have never been fond of
the vehicle design system, the trade and speculation system is completely
worthless, and the only thing saving world generation is the DGP WBH.
  I am not even attached to the Imperium background.  When I started my
campaign in 1977, there was no Imperium.  I developed my own universe, and
never saw any real reason to switch to the *official* one.  For that reason, I
am really not concerned with how "logical" the Space Viking background is. 
I\'ll probably ignore it anyway.

  What would I like to see in a new system.  A logical trade and speculation
system for one.  Has anyone besides me ever noticed that a ton of iron ore, a
ton of refined steel, a ton of steel machine parts, and a ton of completed
equipment ALL COST THE EXACT SAME THING!!!  Or that I can sit at a Starport
and buy and sell cargo and make a fortune ALL WITHOUT EVER MOVING MY SHIP!!! 
(Sorry, got a little heated there.)  I designed my own system some time ago,
but would be interested in seeing an *official* one.
  I would also like to see a better ship design system.  Yes, I know some
people here really like designing ships, but I designed two or three then gave
up on the whole thing.  Starship combat also needs work.  (Right now, I use
Star Strike as my ship design/combat system.)  I would like to see a
simplified design sequence, perhaps using the component system someone
described earlier; something that would let me design/modify a ship during a
game session, as opposed to having to devote an entire evening to one design.
  A new and improved robot design system would be nice too.

  Someone asked if we were familiar with the T2K/DC system.  I have played T2K
v1.0 a few times, and have DC.  I like the character generation system in DC,
but that\'s about it.  I felt the task system was inferior to the one in MT,
and really didn\'t like the combat system.  (And while I\'m at it,  can someone
*please* tell me why in DC gun combat is a Strength related skill?)

  That looks like about .02Cr...

    'body' => 'Howdy,

There is an interesting article by Chuck Gannon in the latest challenge
on Tech 9 ships.  As an avid design nut I thought I wouild just voice a
few observations on them.

He goes on at length about the use of centrifuge systems in TL 9 ships.
But there is no cost/weight/volume/power requirements of such systems.
(Sigh)

The utility/necessity of artificial gravity is gone into in some detail.
However, In my opinion, TL 9 and above do not always need such systems.
Ok, in order to keep the crew and passengers comfortable, you need to
keep your standard maneuvering at 1 G of acceleration.  This would mean
that the crew will be standing on the \'floor\' (the plane perpendicular to
the direction of acceleration)  And the crew would feel perfectly normal
doing so, as long as the instrument panels are so aligned.

It has always been my thought that all military ships would have their
interior setups in this fashion.  There may be exceptions as seen in
ships deck plans (scout ship, Kinunir, and other published designs)
but the majority would be more in line with the Broadsword and Azhanti
High Lightning type plans.  The reason for this is that an accelerating
ship need not turn on it\'s internal gravity, and needs only partial
inertial compensation to have a simulated 1G to keep crew/passengers on
the floor.  (It would save power to do so, and in case of environment
systems failure, the crew wouldn\'t be suddenly plasterd to the walls, they
would only feel pressed into the floor)

Regardless of military designs, a ship without internal gravity must orient
their floor patterns this way.  I would guess that most maneuvers by such
craft would be made at 1G so as not to expose the crews to higher than normal
accelerations.  (2G\'s isn\'t so bad when you\'re sitting down, but I wouldn\'t
care to walk under that if I didn\'t have to.)  Given the endurance of the
ships involved (30 days) you don\'t need to be a super 3G speed demon to get
where you are going.  Thus 1G sounds just fine to me.

Ok, now when is such a ship going to be in zero G?  Well?  The only time
you wouldn\'t be firing your engines is in Jump.  (Actually I have never
read anything that says you can\'t use your maneuver drive in jump, but
there is no reason to except in this particular case.)  {maybe our TML
historian knows of a reason I do not...  Metlay?}

At all other times a ship may fire it\'s engines to simulate gravitation.
Even if the ship is just stationkeeping in orbit, the engines may be
fired.  Just put a slow spin on the ship and accelerate at one G.  You will
essentually be flying in a circle, but that won\'t affect a ship in orbit
too much.  You might annoy some guy in the starport control tower with
maneuvers like that, but then again it should be a standard tech 9 station
keeping maneuver.

"Regina Tower, this is Six Eight Alpha Charlie, requesting clearance for
non-gravitic station-keeping maneuvers..."

"Six Eight Alpha Charlie, this is Regina Tower, clearance for station
keeping maneuvers is given, when are you guys gonna get that internal
gravity fixed?"

Another problem I noted in the designs was a difference of opinion on what
is needed for navigation in a Tech 9 ship.

When I had worked up The Horde, I had a few ideas about the minimum
necessary sensors needed by a space craft, and starship.  The Horde
had active All Weather Radar with a planetary range.  I figured that the
ships mightn\'t always be having to land under clear skies, and certain
types of planetary atmospheres would require it.

The designs in Challenge all have only radar.

I hadn\'t really given much thought to ducking radiation belts as is covered
in Challenge, and hadn\'t included the radiation and magnetic sensors.
These of course only cost about 1000 Cr a piece and so may be considered in
the noise level of the ships.

But the sensors I did included that Challenge didn\'t had good reason behind
them.  I included a radar direction finder so that the craft could easily
locate navigation beacons at interplanetary ranges.  For interplanetary
travel to planets/asteroids that do not have such radio beacons, I included
a Light Amplifier (which is about as close to a telescope as the sensor
lists get)  (The Light Amp is noise level, but the RDF cost around 13,000Cr
which is starting to get into the range that counts)

Now military ships are definitely going to want a radar direction finder,
and probably a laser sensor as well for defensive purposes.  But the
Cruiser included does not have either of these.

I would also think that a starship would need some sort of sensors that
are capable of pinpointing the star to which the ship is going to jump
to.  Radiation & Magnetic sensors just aren\'t gonna do it.  I think you
are gonna need at least a telescope (light amplifier) and possibly a
radar direction finder to locate the destination star by it\'s radio
emmissions.  (I don\'t know much about astronomy but I do know that a
radiation counter will not pinpoint a star against all the background
radiation.  A magnetic sensor will be equally useless)

Mr. Gannon includes an active audio sensor (sonar) in all the ships with
the justification that this is a replacement for the Neural Activity
Sensors in higher TL craft.  Well, that\'s an interesting idea that I never
thought of, but I would question the utility of such a sensor on the ships
that can\'t land!  According to GDW, unstreamlined ships can not land
on a planetary surface.  Therefore an audio system is NOT really useful.
	On the other hand, a ship which is capable of putting out 1G of
acceleration for 30 days should be able to enter a planet\'s atmosphere at
any speed it chooses (max speed 300kph? fine!)  Perhaps Mr. Gannon will
persuade GDW this is possible.

My last complaint with the designs may be just a typo.  But None of the
ships have fuel scoops.  Why worry about the radiation belts in a gas
giant if you don\'t have scoops to use in there anyway?  FUUUURRRRR!!!!!
I think that here we have another example of GDW\'s FAMOUS WONDERFUL
editing/proofing that we will doubtless see more of in Traveller 3.

Which reminds me...I mentioned yesterday that I have been re-reading the

that the GDW sales system of Books, Supplements, Adventures and Games was
probably the best organized (that is, the most \'user friendly\') system that
has ever been published.  More recent GDW publications (say, COACC) have
certainly forced one to buy material that may be of very marginal use
(such as the Eddum Campaign) in order to get material that was considered
desirable (like an aircraft system, however badly flawed, which is a
related issue).  Is there anybody else out there who strongly agrees or 
disagress about this business of organization?

Well, if GDW is going to dump MegaTraveller and DGP is too, how do you people
feel about trying to keep it alive by ourselves? I don\'t suppose we could
manage an actual business-type game company (even if GDW would grant us a
license), but we might be able to do some sort of ideas exchange or something.
I\'ve several pieces lying around that I planned to whip into shape and sell
to GDW or DGP... someday soon ;-). If I won\'t be able to do so, I might as
well share it with someone who will enjoy it. (Of course, I may not take the
trouble to cross the i\'s and dot the t\'s). I\'ve a good deal of information
about the Five Sisters Subsector (Mostly Mirriam, Karin and Iderati) and I\'m
currently working on The Weltbund, a small interstellar state in the Foreven
and Beyond Sektors spinward of the Spinward Marches. (Actually, it would be
fun if we could get the license to those areas. They used to belong to
Paranoia Press and FASA respectively, and the PP stuff at least is no longer
official. It\'s the one place where it would be possible to create a genuine
unknown frontier (as opposed to the settled-1000-years-ago frontier of The
Spinward Marches. I always felt that GDW mad a mistake in placing huge
interstellar states on all sides of the Imperium)).

The last bit is just a pipedream, of course, but what about the rest of it?
If each of us works out one or two planets in detail (and have them vetted
by some of the others) then we could each get a lot more background material
than we could manage on our own.

It is a room-temperature super- conductor!

Furthermore the equipment they use to make it could have been built 50
years ago. That means that we now know of a Tech 6 room-temperature
superconductor. Neat, huh? Whatever will they think of next...

  Personally I doubt wether GDW will issue any licenses for anything Traveller-
related if they themselves are trying to push Traveller: TNE. It is called
destroying the market if we start to sell to all the old dogs.

  I think one of the reasons behind the less-than-stunning success of MegaT
(besides the bugs and all of that) was that there were no overall plan of
publication. Somebody felt like doing a indepth look at starships and we got
the Starship Opman Vol 1 [sic!]. Somebody else had always wanted to do 
something about aircrafts and we got COACC when we hadn\'t even got a good look
at Dulinors home domain, to paraphrase Metlay.

  This is no way of publishing a game. To do that, a plan is needed that
identifies which areas the players need and fills them in.

  I\'d hate to sound like the Devils Advocate but I think that to do something
like that, a core in physical contact with eachother is needed. And at least
one of them will have to work full time with it.

  There is a lot of inventions that theoretically could have been done much
earlier in retrospect. When something appears seems to hinge on the society 
and culture.

  [Roleplaying games for example could have been done as soon as paper, pencil
and dice were invented:) ]

  This had very interesting consequenses for Traveller with its combination of
high and low tech world. For one thing it means that the TL tables are wrong;
A planet who, if they get the information that it exists, can produce jump-
drives or antigrav from TL9 might not invent either jump or antigrav until
TL 11 or higher if they had to discover it on their own.

  Sure, *some* planets might discover jump at TL 9, just as some might invent
roleplaying at TL 1 (Odysseus the RPG! Travel the Greek Islands in the Golden
Age! Smash hit everywhere in Rome!  \'Nice Game\' says Scipio Africanus!), and
in the contect of Traveller, those planets will pass this information on to
their neightbours and everyone else. Even the knowledge that something is
possible to do means that more than half the work is done.

  So the Traveller TL tables are only really usable within the Imperium. The
WBH achivement TL\'s are a step in the right direction but no enough.

Message 200       Thu Nov 28, 1991

Greetings again.

I\'d like to take a minute to talk a bit about the D20 task system we\'re
planning for the Traveller revision.

First, the skill or attribute level you have is your target number for an
Average task. Easy is vs. twice that number; Very Easy versus four  times the
number. Difficult is vs. half the number; Very Difficult vs.  one-fourth. For
instance, a character with a skill level of 8 would be rolling for the
following numbers or less:
 Very Easy: 32
 Easy: 16
 Average: 8
 Difficult: 4
 Very Difficult: 2

If you don\'t have any skill at all, you roll percentile dice vs. your
controlling attribute. For instance, an Easy test of Observation, for a
character with no Observation skill but an Intelligence (Observation\'s
controlling attribute) of 14 would be 28% (percentile roll vs twice the
attribute level).

A roll of 20 always misses (5% chance), and a roll of 1 always hits ( (again a
5% chance), unless the referee decides otherwise.

Now for task philosophy. Mundane, everyday tasks are not rolled for. Does the
character have an applicable skill? Yes? Then he or she succeeds.  Every day
tasks with some risk of failure involved become Very Easy or  Easy. Success
means PERFECT PERFORMANCE; failure means less than perfect, depending upon how
badly the roll missed by. Example: I make my Navigation skill roll exactly,
and I enter the system right on target; I fail it by 2 points, and I miss my
window by enough distance to make my landing 2  hours late (or some such
determination by the referee).

Now, some people have been arguing that a character with skill level 1 in
Traveller has roughly a 50% chance of succeeding at an Average task, while a
character with a skill level of 1 in T2K2, for instance has only a 10% chance.
That\'s very true. But given the change in task philosophy, a character from MT
trying for an Average task with a skill level 1 would,  when converted to the
new system, be making a Very Easy task roll with a  skill level of 2--a 40%
chance of success. Couple this with the fact that new system characters tend
to consolidate their skill points, rather than dispersing them quite as much,
and that reasonable tests can be made vs  the related attribute, and I think
you\'ll find the new system works very nicely. It certainly won\'t leave a
universe full of bumbling fools, as  might have been suspected.

As I\'ve said before, I realize that the new system FEELS different from the
2D6 one. And that\'s a valid point. But the 2D6 system has some  problems of
its own. My own complaints about it have always been that  tough tasks price
low skill levels right out of the market, and that  doesn\'t feel right to me
to have no chance at all if a character has at least a modicum of skill. For
instance, a MT character with a skill level of 2 has no chance of succeeding
with with a Difficult task. But the equivalent character in the new system
would have a skill level of 4,  needing a 2 or less for a Difficult task and a
1 or less for a Very  Difficult task.

Also, the 2D6 bell curve has always bothered me. (I realize I\'m treading upon
sacred ground here, for some, but it\'s the truth.) A +1 modifier  does not
mean the same jump for a character with skill 10 as for one with skill 6, for
instance. In the new system, a +1 is a +1 is a +1.

Those are my comments for the moment. Any questions or comments? I\'d be happy
to respond.

Sincerly,

 Les

Flying the ship in circles would "plaster" the crew to the walls not the
floor.  Centripetal force and all that.  Spinning the ship won\'t work
either since it can only be spun about an axis passing through its center
of mass.  You could have two sections of the ship counter rotating thus
providing a nearly zero net angular momentum.  Access would only be possible
along the zero-g axis at the center but you could simulate gravity even
during orbits and in jump space.  2010 had a sample of a ship that used
rotation as a "artificial gravity" generator.  This still leaves the problems
of acceleration but you can\'t have everything.

Radio emmisions are not that useful due to poor resolution - visible light
is better - stick with the telescope.  Radiations sensors - I don\'t remember
what kind of radiation these detect is it particle radiation (electrons
helium nuclei etc) or EM.  If its EM these will work fine.  Do the detection
in the UV - IR ranges - not problems.  Particle radiation would suffer
from cosmic background and non-linear flight paths.


Every now and then I just have to take some time to toss my 2 cents into
the ring! :-)

Quite true...I _usually_ work under the assumption that Tech Level in Traveller
refers to the repair/manufacture level of the world, rather than the _use_
or _discovery_ level.

Aside: In 1987, I visited the British Museum in London on my honeymoon.  My
wife of four days (at the time) was a gamer, which was fortunate, because I
came to a display case in the Roman culture section containing ancient Roman
_20-sided_ dice.  I had to sit on the floor for a few minutes because I was 
laughing so hard.

If you consider the tech levels to refer to the level of industrial support
needed to manufacture large quantities of the items, most of the problems
will disappaer.  At least I think so.  As you say, TL9 means that you have
the ability to _build_ jump drives gvien a blueprint--deciding whether or
not the planet has heard of them is a job for the referee.

TRADE AND COMMERCE REVISIONS

     I have been thinking about trade and commerce again in the last few 
days.  I don\'t have any solutions to the problem to suggest right now.  In 
fact, what I\'m trying to do is to define the problem.  (-:

     Would we agree that the purpose of a trade system is to allow the 
referee to put enough money into a game to allow the players to maintain 
their own starship?  To do this, the system should not be so unbalanced as 
to make it too easy to win vast quantities of wealth, nor so difficult as 
to cause the players to go bankrupt every time they try it.  Ideally, it 
seems to me that it ought to be set up in a way that will make the profits 
proprotional to the risk...safe and steady will keep you eating, but a new 
starship will require some risks.  

     In order to design a new system, I think that it would be necessary to 
set the background with some decisions about Imperial economics.  Are 
planets mostly self-sufficient?  Do \'balance of trade\' issues affect indi-
vidual merchants by making it difficult to sell things on backwater worlds 
with few trade connections to gain Imperial money?  Do the megacorporations 
tie up all of the steady trade in items with very high profit margins, 
leaving only occasional deals of this sort for the little guys?  Do planets 
routinely pass trade-restricting (or trade enhancing) legislation?  I think 
the answers to all of these questions are probably \'yes\', but we\'ve never 
been told so explicitly.

     I think it would also be very nice to get some idea of the volume of 
shipping available in various regions of the Imperium--even something as 
simple as the \'battalion strenght of armies\' table from the Rebellion 
Sourcebook or the 5th Frontier War articles in JTAS would be a help.

     Hmmm...maybe I do have a few suggestions after all...if I was piecing 
together rules from the existing versions, I\'d use something like the 
original Book 2 rules with tech level effects added in for manufactured 
goods.  I\'d also modify some of the products to reduce the potential prof-
its from them--if you ever played with the old system, you\'ll remember that 
machine tools, radioactives, gems, and computers were the cargos of choice.

Quite true.  The ship gained potential energy w.r.t. Sol and lost
potential energy w.r.t. Alpha Centauri.  It also gained and lost
potential energy from a number of other stars and various celestial
bodies.  Since gravity drops off with the square of distance, the
energy differences w.r.t. Sol and Alpha Centauri should (I think)
dominate the equation, though, especially if you assume a roughly
uniform distribution of stars in the vicinity.  This might not be
valid near a nova cloud or black hole or quasar or similar such
phenomenon, I guess.

: This, of course, is going to be a real neat trick, given that you want

True, but I don\'t think Traveller was THAT broken.  Some of the
stats might have to be altered or given further constraints.

The physics violations may not be as much of a problem as you
think, though.  For ships, I\'d settle for having all of the
types of equipment and weaponry carried over.  Then, if I\'m
not too concerned with the physics behind what\'s happening
(I know that my ship is capable of a two parsec jump, carries
five triple beam laser turrets, and is capable of four G
acceleration from rest, for instance), I can go with what
I\'ve got.  If there are enough example ships, I should be
able to guess at values that I didn\'t already know (such as
damage points or batteries bearing, if these systems change).

If I am concerned with everything being correct in the new
system (or matching physics better, or whatever), then I\'m
going to want to convert the ship to the new system anyway.
It\'s still important that I have a starting point, though.

Characters are similar, but a bit more difficult.  I should
be able to look at an old Traveller character and know what
his stats and abilities roughly are in the new system,
without being forced to convert the character by hand.  This
could mean, for instance, doubling ability scores and adding
three to stats (as a rough approximation).  Again, if you
are converting characters to the new system, this is probably
not sufficient, but is a good starting point.

: 
: Me too.  I\'d settle for xD6 instead of 2D6, because then the piles of
: dice I\'ve accumulated for use with Star Wars will have another use.

I\'d settle for xD6 also.  Years ago, a friend of mine and I
invented a system for game based on TRON (right when the movie
came out).  We used 4d6-4 (or 4 dice labelled 0-5) for every
roll, in order to get a steep bell curve from 0-20.  From the
word I\'ve been hearing, however, it seems like it\'s already
been decided to use d20\'s.

Actually, if you want realistic rolls, you should provide for
open-ended die rolls.  For example, use a d12 numbered from
0-11, where 11 means roll again and add 10, and 0 on the first
roll only means roll again and subtract from 0.  This makes it
possible for anyone to succeed or fail tremendously at any
task.

I think it\'s a matter of taste when it comes down to it.  I
prefer good old 2d6, but would live with a d20 roll.

If GDW decides to use d20, however, they should NOT make the
low rolls mean success.  People naturally tend to think of
high rolls as success.  IMHO, although I remember somewhere
(was it the TML?) where a study/survey was made and they
found out the same thing.

This is my first post to this topic since my machine failed 11/9/91.

   1) Adapting the rules to the T2000 system is not going to kill MT. Changing
to the task system did not invalidate ANY classic Traveller adventure.
   Changing the world generation system is the only thing that would
fundamentally invalidate previous work. All those world descriptions, hand-
generated subsectors and sectors, etc., becoming invalid would alienate
current players.
   The ship design and combat system is under severe attack from several
directions. Power from fission and fusion plants is said to be way too low,
and the new agility rule isn\'t liked by many. I would be happy to see jump
plants and fuel swell back up to classic Traveller percentages, with a
compensating increase in power plant outputs.

   2) Traveller has always been more action-oriented than setting oriented.
Someone referred to some RPGs as being "poetry"-based. In Traveller, this has
meant that Imperial society was remarkably siimilar to twentieth century
Earth.
   To me this threw away half the wonder of science fiction. Sure, you have
alien races--outside the Imperium. The Alien Modules and Books were very
significant because they provided flesh-and-blood outsiders to interact with.
   By comparison, RL: Legionnaire goes the other direction of playing
characters in a specified society: the Latinized Galactic Empire. This could
be too specific for many tastes.
   I prefer the ability to tailor the rules to a different universe than the
Third Imperium, in case I want to run a campaign based on a particular si-fi
universe. This permits me to run the Imperium as more feudal than most
referees do.
   This point isn\'t sharp, but the "modern-day society" view colors many
people\'s conceptions and deserves people\'s attention.

   3a) The Rebellion is not an overthrow of the Traveller storyline. It
appears so if people think in terms of modern nation-states. Historic FEUDAL
empires often fell apart with startling suddenness. (They also reformed if
there were only two sides...)
   View the Imperium as a Holy Roman Empire cemented by modern education and a
strong central army. It\'s feudal, and people consider themselves from
Vland/Vland or from Spinward Marches as much as they consider themselves
Imperial citizens. YOU DO NOT HAVE MODERN DAY NATIONAL IDENTITY WITH THE
STATE. If the central military weakens itself fighting a civil war, large
regions become self- governing.
   A rump central state surrounded by local powers was not unheard of. It
USUALLY took one or more generations to reconquer the old frontiers, if the
separation did not become permanent.
   3b) The growth of the factions is sometimes said to be sudden and hard to
rationalize. The division of Alexander the Great\'s domains shows how fragile
feudal organizations can be (although that was scarcely an established
empire), and how several factions can quickly arise. (Yes, two is more
normal.) Still, the first Chinese empire collapsed when three clan leaders
killed the Emperor, and then fought over the spoils.
   3c) Without development of trains and telegraphs, the United States would
almost certainly have splintered asunder--and stayed asunder--long before
1860. The Imperium only has an xboat courier net and no courier system ever
kept an empire together.
   Given a sufficient shock, like 1117, the Imperium floated apart. And
because the issue had not been decided in 1117, there wasn\'t enough central
power to bring the pieces together again. So, I don\'t accept that Star
Viking\'s setting--a specific period in history--is wrong or a corruption of
the Traveller storyline.
   Yes, a government collapse can be depressing. Ask a white Russian living in
the Ukraine. Most of these territories are at peace internally, however.
   Yes, dividing formerly unified territories can be violent. Look at
Yugoslavia and at the India/Pakistan partition.

   4) A computer virus destroys all computers in Imperia. Is this possible?
   RINGWORLD\'s history involves development of a bacteria that attacked the
Ringworlder\'s metaconductors. Due to the nature of the Ringworld, the
inhabitants could not restore their civilization. Such events could happen or
be made to happen in Imperia.
   Imperia, however, has a diversity of technologies reflecting a diversity of
races. No logical or biological virus could affect all branches. However, the
Imperial government use standardized TL15 equipment, and could afford to
import same to lower tech worlds.
   An attack on the hi-tech computers would drastically weaken the navies,
bureaucracies, communications, and power of all factional governments. They
would lose control of border regions and areas that weren\'t self-supporting.
Recovery processes would develop locally and would fragment Imperia\'s economy
and culture even more.
   It is noteworthy that HIWG-UK development postulates a cyberpunk culture in
parts of Gushemege, and recent TNS items suggest the residents of TL16
Shakumash bear Lucan little goodwill. Developing a nannite/bacteria that eats
TL15 silicon wafers sure wouldn\'t help Lucan or Dulinor. (And TL16 stuff may
be safe... Hmm...)

   I\'m back after a long absence. (Since 11/9.)

LOREN
   I would be willing to contribute/test/evaluate any revised ship design
and/or combat system.

THE COMPUTER VIRUS
   See the end of my post in Topic 3. It\'s a suggestion.

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE REVISION
   Constructive ones only, too.

   Leave the world generation system alone. Too many players and referees have
rolled up individual systems (extended generation), subsector and sector
listings (basic generation), and programs based on them. Changing it would be
a critical discontinuity that would hurt sales of the new rules.
   Years ago I noted the original basic system\'s unscientific bias toward
nitro-oxy atmosphere worlds. The later extended system, for example, produces
very different results in the number of habitable worlds. There\'s an article
in an old Colorado gaming newsletter titled "It\'s a Cold Universe Out There."
   My opinion is that this section works for users, and should not be changed.

   I would like to see a "World Book" in the new rules. Players Manual,
Referees Manual, and Imperial Encyclopedia was one way to organize the rules.
I prefer world generation and development in a seperate book like in the black
books.
  This World Book would include elements from WBH, if possible, and I like the
"Aspects of Culture" from Challenge magazine. (I bet GDW can find it faster
than I could.)
  Front section: for players, would have the comparative technology charts and
sample vehicles (planetary transportation).
  Second section: the basic generation system, subsector and sector mapping
forms.
  Third section: the extended generation system and the forms to record it.
  Fourth section: generating a technology profile, "Aspects of Culture,"
government form, generating a religion.
  Fifth section: rules for mapping planet surfaces and forms for surface maps.
Generating animal encounter tables. (Face it, if they aren\'t on the surface
and out of a city, animal encounters don\'t occur to PCs.)

  Revise starship design, and put it in a supplement. I strongly support this
idea.
  I favor increasing power plant output to match engineering estimates made by
those with some training in that area. This may also involve reducing fuel for
fission plants and such: I don\'t know.
  Make jump drives and their fuel larger. Actually, MT reduced fuel
consumption from the black books.
  Relate agility to maneuver drives. With the black book\'s formula, I
rationalized that agility represented the ability to supply power to the
maneuver drives while powering weapons. Also, limit maximum agility to the
maneuver ability.
  Limiting craft to 6-G has generated controversy. Yes, modern fighter craft
can achieve much higher speeds. Modern aircraft CARRIERS, however, do not
maneuver at even 1G! Emphasize the role of inertial comp in big craft, and
provide rules for G effects that would permit craft with _everyone in couchs
and everything tied down_ to design for higher speeds. Then you will have very
fast _small craft_.

  TWO LEFT FIELD OPINIONS:
  1. I do not think design sequences need be strictly compatible between
vehicles and starships. Aircraft and mechanical engineers who design engines
for similar output produce different results: the aircraft engineers make
smaller, lighter, but much more expensive engines.
  2. Limit meson weapons to the same ranges as energy weapons (currently two
hexes in space combat). Meson decay has very short time spans, and even
"accelerating mesons to relativisitic speeds" will not give the same range as
particle accelerators.
  This would have major effects for starship combat, and for planetary defense
and bombardment. But I think the science supports it far than it supports the
current system.

Clay speaks at last:
 <Virus suggestion up in Topic 3>
   I like it.  Now we have to convince GDW.

   Still, Loren and Co. have told us to wait for the whole story.  How long we
have to wait will influence the nature of our response (if it doesn\'t affect
the actual content, it will make certain opinions rather irate).

 <Make jump drives and their fuel larger. Actually, MT reduced fuel
consumption from the black books.>
   MT Jump Drives are exactly the same size as High Guard J-Drives.  Only the
fuel comsumption has dropped.
   For a 100-ton example:

               J1     J2     J3     J4     J5     J6
 Book 2        ?+10  10+20   ?+30  15+40   ?+50  20+60
 High Guard    2+10   3+20   4+30   5+40   6+50   7+60
 MegaTrav      2+10   3+15   4+20   5+25   6+30   7+35

   The Book 2 and High Guard numbers are deceptive, since a certain power
plant rating was also required, while MT Jump Drives operate in isolation. 
Because of the current explanation of Jump Drive, I prefer the isolation
approach.  Alternate (non-Imperium universe) technologies might do it the
other way.
   As for increasing fuel consumption of J-Drives:  If you must, as long as
overall starship fuel requirements stay about where they are. Again, I prefer
the MT version.  Since J-Drives are not rated in specific power terms, any
revision of Powerplants need not touch Jump Drives.

 <Relate agility to maneuver drives...>
   Unlike a great many folks who have argued this point before me, I do not
see a big problem with MT agility.  Or rather, I don\'t see the same problem. 
The ship Rob Dean posted to Topic 4 recently is a good example.  MT does not
tie Agility to Maneuver rating, but DOES limit it to 6.  Unlike the
technological reasons for a 6G ceiling to Thrusters, there is no reason for
such a limit on Agility.  None.
   To solve this problem, look at the description of Thruster technology in
SOpM.  Here we are told that M-Drives can overload to 400% for brief periods,
and that they can produce reduced thrust in directions other than \'forward\'. 
Elsewhere in SOpM we are told that Artificial Gravity technology is unstable
over 6G, and only useful for industrial purposes which do not require a
sustained field (this leaves out M-Drives, I think, and is the reason for the
6G limit some people are complaining about).
   Based on this, I would define Agility as the ship\'s ability to produce
overdrive thrust IN ANY DIRECTION.  Agility is thus limited to 4 times the
normal rating of the drives, with no other limit (no stopping at 6).  Note
that since the drives are being run AT 400% (not +400%), Agility is limited to
3 times thrust unless no normal thrust is being generated (100% to thrust;
300% to Agility).
   There is a catch, however.  Agility would be based on LOADED weight (or
\'current\' weight for advanced types), and would almost certainly do bad things
to the Thrusters if kept up for any length of time (those of you with SFB
experience: think \'Orions\').  The SOpM says that a good Engineer is required
for any serious overdriving, and I must agree.
   If the circumstances of too much overdrive can be added to whatever becomes
the combat system, then all Agility become \'Emergency\' Agility. This will
counteract the ability of highly specialized ships to potentially dodge lasers
(Agility 15+).  Oh yes, Inertial Compensation is also limited to 6Gs, so high
Agilities will throw things around regardless.

 <Limiting craft to 6-G has generated controversy...>
   I agree with this entire paragraph, but would point out that (according to
SOpM) Thrusters are unstable over 6Gs, and Fusion Rockets cannot thrust
sideways (without blowing up), thus limiting both as Agility Generators at
high G (see above).  By giving Fusion Rockets a different Agility Limit, the
high possible thrusts are balanced out ("He may be fast, but he can\'t dodge
like a Thruster ship.").  Doubly unstable Thrusters are their own reward.

 <I do not think design sequences need be strictly compatible between vehicles
and starships...>
   Agreed.  The goal is to able to USE them together.  As long as I know what
to do if that Destroyer shoots at aircraft (or cars, or boats), then having
several design systems is not a big problem.

 <Limit meson weapons to the same ranges as energy weapons...>
   YES!  YES!  YES!
   This change would give meaning to the PA again.  By the way, High Guard PA
weapons had better to-hit numbers than the Meson Gun.  This should be
reinstated over the fiasco of the MT ship combat tables. MT made a laughing
stock of the Spinal PA (not that it wasn\'t a problem in High Guard, but MT
made it worse).
   On a general note, the ability of small ships to affect large ones needs to
be addressed.  The current system does not reflect the \'reality\' of TAS News
items and other Imperial literature.  The Neo system should be true to its
background.

     The problem I and most others seem to have with the virus runs
 into the following:
     1.  Designing/making it (easiest to solve, I\'d vote for nannites
           aside from the fact that Imperial tech quite apparently
           doesn\'t have this capability yet, though it could be explained
           away as an ancient find perhaps, this makes it hard for the
           Imps to combat, but easy for the Ancients, it would also
           be versatile enough to effect imperial TLs and capabilities.
           Of course you still might have the below problems, except
           for 4).
     2.  Keeping it secret
     3.  Spreading it and having it work at similar times, or at least
         not be identified for years.
     4.  Different TL\'s

     Clay mentioned the Ringworld semiconducter as an example, while I have
 previously considered this, there is still the problem of options
 2-4 above. While the Ringworld is somewhat as large as the Imperium, in
 number of worlds contained, the Ringworld is a lot faster to travel around.
     It takes years to cross the Imperium from end to end with jump drive,
 doing this on the ringworld would take about 10 days max at a leisurely
 pace using jump.

29 Loren,
  And the reason they were returned was because I hadn\'t lived at that address
for over three years.  Someone there failed to update my address -- one of the
reasons that I cancelled my sub to Challenge, I didn\'t get any when I moved
and repeated attempts with letters (4) and phone calls (5) failed to get my
address changed over a one year period.  
  My point is that if GDW can\'t input a simple address change into a database,
it\'s no wonder we have MT!

A bit more time to consider things have led to the following additional
thoughts... Scale: I think that it is important to give careful consideration
to scale going into this revision. The Imperium is large to the extent that it
would be totally impossible to provide a density of support for the entire
thing. As the new rules are intended to provide an INTRODUCTION for NEW
PLAYERS, remember that pages devoted to the big picture (such  as most MT
material) take away from the space that can be devoted to  material ready for
immediate referee use. I would like to see any  background material in the
begining rule set focus in great detail on at best a couple of worlds. Just
something to get them into the game and playing UNTIL further enlarged
material comes out. If you want to put a few spaceships into it make them ones
produced at local yards and give full background and deck plans. If you want
trade to go on develop an economic background that gives the referee something
to work with and reveal to the players. Vehicles in the basic rules should all
have  obvious uses in the limited setting in the rules. Don\'t have a mis mash
of material equipment and background from all over the Imperium. Make it
totally complete and totally unreliant on any other published MT or Classic
material. Combat: I think that it is important, especially in introductory
adventures to have combat always be the last or worst choice of resolution
series.  Combat tends to come natural to players (especially ones who have a 
strong T2000 background), but in most cases it should not be the preferred
method. Highlight what ever mechanism is used to resolve conflict with out
resource to arms. Set a strong tone for the game.

Thanks,

Dave Cheever

Are these numbers supposed to be roled with a d20 ? Then very high skill
levels are going to be needed. What about attributes - do they add to the
number ?

28% chance without any skill for an easy task. That is better chance than
skill level 2 - almost skill level 3. If these numbers for some reason are 
to be rolled with a d10 (maybe he forgot to convert from T2000) then it is
still better than skill level 1.

Does he mean that :

Very Easy ~ Routine
Easy      ~ Difficult
Average   ~ Formidable
Difficult ~ Impossible 

This would give very roughly the same chances - but it is a very strange
naming they have given the new task levels.

Yes a +1 is a +1 one with the new system. Still some times a +1 cuts your 
chance of failure to half. The 2d6 system is also an unfair, but at least
it does look like a probability bell curve. Bell curves are good enough
for The Real World (TM), but not for GDW ?  :->

I have read the task system in DC and now these suggestions for the new
traveller revision. I am afraid they are changing the best skill resolution
system on the market to something very inferior.

I am also afraid that everybody who matters on GDW already have made up
their mind on this subject.

they didn\'t match up with COACC.

  The normal way an aircraft work is that the thrust of the engine decrease
or is constant while the counterforce from the air resistance grows. When 
they are equal, the plane stops accelerating. Some aircrafts, like the
fuel-guzzling Saab JA-37 Viggen will be at bingo fuel long before this happens,
so their real top speed is unknown in a way.
  Different engine types have also different thrust vs speed charts, which is
why ramjets/after burners are such a good idea at great speeds.

  Thus you can reach very high speeds with a low thrust engine, if the a/c has
low air resistance and the thrust of the engine don\'t decrease. The anti-grav
of Traveller gives a thrust dependent on power input (ref Striker). Exactly
how they manage this non-physical feat is unknown, but a vehicle using it 
should have a top speed only dependent on the relationship between air
resistance and thrust.

  As for aircrafts, it would depend on air resistance versus thrust and the 
type of engine used.

It\'s exactly because of centripetal acceleration that this works.  The

These are some strong recommendations that I have for the new
Traveller.  I\'m not going to go into ALL of the scientific
detail, but I hope that the folks at GDW take the time to do
so.

o Correct fusion and fission power plant output and fuel
  consumption.  It should be simple to get the correct
  numbers for fission plants.  For fusion plants, you
  must find the energy gained from a fusion reaction.  A
  science textbook is probably a good source for this --
  if I had the information handy I\'d post it.

  For fusion, there is a problem with fuel -- ordinary
  hydrogen does not have enough (or any) neutrons to fuse
  into helium.  Thus, current fusion uses heavy hydrogen
  (deuterium or tritium) which is found in SMALL amounts
  along with normal hydrogen.  Refinement of fuel could
  then mean either selecting out all of the heavy hydrogen
  or better yet MAKING most of the hydrogen "heavy".  It
  could also be possible to burn normal hydrogen, but you
  would need to find a way to "donate" neutrons to the
  reaction.  Note that this would probably be harder and
  more damaging to the reactor than pre-treating the
  hydrogen in the first place.

After adjusting the power plant output, you\'ll HAVE to make
this next change:

o Correct fuel amounts required for maneuvering.  It is
  currently possible for a ship to gain more kinetic
  energy from its maneuver drives than it puts into them.
  This makes impossible things such as perpetual motion
  machines not only possible, but you get energy to boot.

  The formula for kinetic energy is:

             1   2
         E = - mv
             2

  where m is the mass of the ship and v its (relative)
  velocity.

  It MUST cost MORE than this much energy to accelerate
  a ship of mass m to a new velocity v.  Currently it
  costs LESS in many cases.

  I could convert this equation into a more usable
  form, but the idea is the same -- you can\'t get energy
  for free, or else the whole universe falls apart.

  It\'s been a while, but I once used this equation to
  determine how much fuel would be required for a
  fusion plant to accelerate a ship to 0.1c.  Assuming
  all deuterium, I think that 1/2 of the ship needed
  to be fuel.  That drops down to about 4% (I think) of
  the ship if antimatter is used (assuming total energy
  conversion -- I don\'t know what the real output of an
  antimatter reactor would be).

  By the way, fusion powered ships should have an
  exhaust -- all of that helium being created as a
  by-product.  It would be dead weight otherwise.  Of
  course it doesn\'t have to be coming out of the ship
  at 20,000 degrees -- the fusion reactor could even
  use cold fusion, or the energy from the excess heat
  might be tapped somehow.  In fact, it doesn\'t even
  have to be helium, in theory.  You could even put
  out "normal" air, if your reactor is capable of
  enough control over the fusion reaction.

  I think you\'ll find that if you make the energy
  costs for propulsion reasonable, you won\'t need to
  play around with 6G limits -- simply limit the
  power output of power plants and make maneuver
  drives capable of high-G thrust inefficient at
  lower G\'s.  Then it would be POSSIBLE to design
  ships with high accelerations, but only FEASIBLE
  for smaller ships.  Sure, someone could build a
  dreadnought which is all power plant and high-
  consumption drives, but it would need to be
  refueled hourly and would be exorbitantly
  expensive.

  Also note that grav drives must ALSO use more
  energy -- they must use more energy than the
  combination of difference in gravitational
  potential energy PLUS the difference in kinetic
  energy (the same is true for all drives, but I\'m
  assuming that maneuver drives simply impart a
  vector of acceleration, to which gravity must be
  added).  This post is long enough, though, so I
  won\'t go into the gory details.

I hope these suggestions are taken in earnest.

commerce. RPG\'s  don\'t explain it very well and sf authors don\'t
write about either (except for a few, of which Jack Vance\'s Demon
Princes novels offer one of the better explanations but only for
money not credit).

How is credit handled? Credit cards would present major problems
outside of a star system. Who would honor them? Granted the megacor-
porations would have a system for their employees but what about the
average citizen or player characters. Once you\'ve mustered out you\'re
on your own. I still have problems with the retirement pay. There is
no way to keep track of payments from one system to another.

The same for paying the notes on a starship. What prevents anyone from
saying that they paid their note at their last stop a jump or 2 away.
By the time they could check it out the ship could be gone. Or the
simple fact of a late payment. At the time and distances involved
minor mistakes could have major repercussions.

Well, anyway here\'s some of my comments on Rob\'s posting.

> Would we agree that the purpose of a trade system is to allow the

> maintain their own starship? 

I wouldn\'t say this. The trade system is an important part of the
economics of the system. Businesses look at cash flow. When money,
goods & services exchange hands that\'s when profits are made. The more
money introduced from outside the system the greater the chances of
profit.

> set the background with some decisions about Imperial economics.

Definitely. Now how do we do it? Designing the basic mechanics of a
game is relatively easy. It\'s the background info that requires
detailed research.

> Are planets mostly self-sufficient?  

I think they are. However, since there are higher tech level planets
they would need to import the higher tech level goods to support the
high tech level starships that visit and to raise the general tech
level of the planet. Generally the higher the tech level the better
the living conditions so lower level planets would want to become
like their higher level counterparts.

Actually, that needs to be modified a bit. Established planets would
be mostly self sufficient. The newly colonized or mining worlds would
be highly dependent on outside sources because the industrial base
is not yet complete.

> Do \'balance of trade\' issues affect individual merchants by making it 
> difficult to sell things on backwater worlds with few trade connections 
> to gain Imperial money? 

Backwater worlds would probably be happy they get visited by starships
and would buy everything they could afford. Most sf literature is
written under this assumption. These planets are not profitable for
the big outfits but are for the little guys, the \'typical\' tramp
freighter ships that have lower overhead.
 
> Do the megacorporations tie up all of the steady trade in items with
> very high profit margins, leaving only occasional deals of this sort
> for the little guys? 

I would think this depends upon the particular items and the quantity
involved. If a market produced only a small quantity of something it
probably wouldn\'t be worth it even if it was very profitable (Piper\'s
Cosmic Computer novel had a planet that produced brandy that was
very expensive on Terra but they could only sell it to the infrequent
ships that passed through the system and then at a very reduced rate.
They also salvaged military equipment but again couldn\'t sell it for
what it was worth.)

> Do planets  routinely pass trade-restricting (or trade enhancing)
> legislation?

I think this would depend upon the government type. A Dictatorship
would want to keep the populace ignorant so would enforce strong
import conditions (i.e. keeping all the high tech goods for its own
use).
A more liberal govenment would want to better the conditions of its
citizens and would be probably have less severe import conditions.
But even in this type of system imports would be monitored so as to
lessen the impact upon society.

> I think the answers to all of these questions are probably \'yes\', 
> but we\'ve never been told so explicitly.

I\'ll agree with this. I have yet to see a good explanation anywhere
on trade and commerce.

> I think it would also be very nice to get some idea of the volume of
> shipping available in various regions of the Imperium...

I would probably say it is very similar to the conditions today.
Heavy traffic through the main trade routes by the everyone with 
lighter traffic to the outlying regions by small subsidiaries or
small independents.
Look at any major city. Planes, for instance. Every airline in the area
has flights into the city so connections can be made. But only the
small airlines service the smaller regional airports.

To pin down actual numbers would take some time. But even in the 
Imperium scheduled flights would be an integral component of
communications.

Since there would be frequent flights, one per day per major planet
for the major lines might be appropriate, would necessitate cheaper
travel costs. Travel costs, as they are now, seem to be too high.
Which is another point I find irritating. I would think that the
average or at least the above average citizen would want to take
a cruise offplanet. As it is now it would take a major portion of
a citizens income just for the ticket!

This little drone with the massive agility and supposedly no propulsion
unit doesn\'t make sense, though.  To be able to dodge, the craft will need
to be able to apply a thrust in some direction, right?  In zero g, unless
a counter-force is applied, the craft will continue to move on its new
vector caused by this thrust, due to inertia.  To be really agile, the
ship would have to be able to make many such dodging motions quickly,
perhaps even repetitively.  If it did repetitive dodges in the same
direction, thrusting the same way again and again, couldn\'t the vessel
be considered to be applying a maneuvering thrust?  It would probably be
higher than the thrust caused by the Challenge #45 ion drive....

Someone mentioned making fusion rockets less maneuverable than thrusters,
but allowing them a greater acceleration.  What if someone mounts BOTH
systems on their ship?  I had a vargr corsair captain in a campaign that
wanted to do this to his ship -- he liked the thought of having a backup
engine system that could be used for emergency power and a little extra kick
in an emergency.

The comment was made that fusion rockets couldn\'t be used for high-gee
agility because they couldn\'t provide "sideways" thrust without blowing up.
But what is to stop people from mounting secondary rockets on the hull
perpendicular to the main axis of thrust?  That rocket, perhaps a quarter
the size of the main engine, could be used in order to augment "sideways"
motion as well.  Maybe I\'m missing something here.

Here\'s something I thought about after reading the Starship
Ops Manual...

OK, it says the jump drive generates this enormous amount of
energy, and sends it to the Lanthanum hull net, where just
the flowing of energy is enough to tear a hole in our dimension
and enter jumpspace.

Question: how does all that energy get from the drive to the hull 
without mangling space inside the ship?

Come to think of it, how does it manage to flow through the net 
without vaporizing it, the hull or the entire ship?  If there\'s
any resistance, the heat would be enormous, and if not, it would
be impossible to direct, wouldn\'t it?  (OK, I stank in physics.
Maybe some physicist/MegaTrav-fanatic could tell us all how the
Jump Drive is built.  :)

I bet you thout you had heard the last of me (HAH!) I know when I am onto
a good thing .

Question 1

Can you give me an extended description of planetary governments 

Question 2

The vilani / vargr and solomani / aslan books wont be ordered by my book
store cause they suck 

So I dont suppose you have (very brief so as not to piss you off) any info
regarding of character generation of vargr and aslan 

Question 3

If your world is in a habitible zone and is the moon of a gas giant, you run a
a GREAT risk of having neighbours with twice the population of the homeworld

Question 4 

The moon sizes for another planets seem  a little wierd . I mean according
to those rules there is NO WAY the moon (ours) can be the sixe it is .

Question 5

If a world is both atmos 4-9 and a pop of 8+ it runs a HUGE RISK of being
near a dwarf star which actually makes it uninhabitible . 

Well outer zoned anyway .

Question 6

Are nuclear weapons illegal for everybody

Question 7

When does the imperium interfere in a member worlds affairs . So like when
the mysterious strike assignment from the naval characters generation comes 
into it . 

Question 8

Wouldnt a naval tech have a good chance of gaining the admin skill ?

Question 9 

Does an aslan male character whose social is about 6+ usually join the armed
forces 

Question 10 

I hope you are not getting sick of all these BLOODY NIGLEY QUESTIONS 

Question 11

Whose the guy who regards himself as an expert on military affairs in 
traveller (as in the one who has access to email)

Question 12

It took me an average 5 hours to make up a vehicle . How does Scott Kellog 
find the time, I mean geez .....

Question 13 

The power (in megawatts) in the vehicle creation system is really unclear ....
I dont suppose you have a clearer definition . 

Question 14

I tried to make a scout vessel (as the one from the encyclopedia) and
absolutly nothing was acurate . As it turned out the power listed for vessels
in the encyclopedia were on average 3 times the power I worked out for them

Question 15

How different is the robot rules in book 8 different from the ones published
in 79 in the best of traveller journal . (Which I have a copy)

Question 16

Thanks for ALL your help, I mean THANKS . I have been sitting in the dark

Guess what !!!!!

I though of some more wonderful questions .......

Okay are you ready ....

1) Officers get promoted once a term, and not dependant on assignments (
except say garrison . So an army lieut gets promoted on an internal sec)

2) College : 4 yours at college to recieve a pidling extra educ points . How
about instead of gaining educ points, gain levels of academic . So a character
could have studied history, or genetics or something like that at college . 

3) Flight School : Is this one year or 4 . Could you spend brownie points
to gain extra pilot skills, The descriptions and tables seem to be different
from each other for advanced characters (I mean in naval academy, flight 
school etc) 

4) Traveller Aid Society . The description in the book isnt all that clear ...
Do travellers members pay for accomodation while travelling, How do they prove
thier identity as a traveller member . 

5) Naval Bases and Scout Bases

How big is a naval base (very roughly, like how many ships etc) 
How big is a scout base (as above)

Do the staff at bases count as members of the population 

6) Non Imperial Military Bases : What exactly are they ????

7) Do you know where I could pick up info about merc companies

8) What exactly are the official guidelines for vehicle creation . It 
seemed that all the creators in the archives (well the bundles) had thier own
idea

9) How far out are the vehicles in the encyclopedia from the truth ?

10) What is mike metlay (???)\'s email address . I would like to ask him a 
few questions ?????

11) Geez I hope you arnt getting sick of me .....

I skipped the source-related questions as I haven\'t got my sources
with me.

Yep!  This problem has been around since Book 6.  I just treat the
basic system generation as gospel and the expanded as a suggestion
which I discard :-)

In the Imperium they are (it\'s a high crime to possess or sell one).
Only the Imperial armed forces have nukes and they only use them in cases
of extreme injustice.

Only when interstellar trade and commerce is grossly affected, or a
violation of imperial law (like use of nukes) is involved.

Yes! :-)

There are a few.  Like maybe Rob Dean?  I let them speak for
themselves.

I think they rework existing designs a great deal.  I agree it\'s a
formidable task (uncertain)

I try.  Sorry for the spotty answers.

    'body' => 'Hi,

Flying in circles to simulate gravity

Ok, This is assuming that when the ship is accelerating @1G, the floor
is set up so that the crew feels 1G of acceleration on the aft bulkhead
making that the \'Floor\'.  So, flying from planet to planet, you would
walk around on the \'floor\' and feel perfectly normal.

Now, we want to stay in orbit, or just stay in one location.  By putting
a slow rotation on the ship you are pointing the drives in a varying
direction.  When you have made a full circle, your net acceleration is
zero.  Thus you haven\'t moved anywhere.

Well Tony, I did say a SLOW rotation now didn\'t I?  Acutally, I was
considering flying in a circle say... a couple kilometers in diameter...
I\'m too lazy to figure out what the coliosis forces would do, but if
1 km is too small, then 2 km should be ok.

Think about it like this:  1kg Bead on a string.  whirl the bead around over
your head so that the bead is feeling 9.8m/S^2 in centripetal acceleration.
Ok, now imagine your bead is now a 1kg spaceship.  Instead of the string
pulling on the spaceship with a force of 9.8 neutons, the ship\'s engines
are pushing it with 9.8 neutons.  As long as the ship\'s nose is pointed at
the center of the circle and is accelerating at 1G, you will stay right there.

Ok now expand the scale.  Now you have a 30 meter long ship accelerating
at 1G.  Sure you\'d want the diameter of the rotation to be much longer.
But you are not rotating in such a way that the center of rotation is within
the body of the ship.

Trust me it works.  (Hey you\'re at MIT!  I\'m at Auburn!  You\'re supposed to
be smarter than me!) :-) :-)

BTW, it was always my impression that a Radiation counter in megatrav would
detect particulate radiation.  Thus it is useless in finding stars.  In
order for a TL 9 ship to jump, you will need some sort of telescope, and
the closest thing in MT is the Light Intensifier.

PART 7

Terra: The AECO Starport

	"RUN, DAMMIT!"
	"Can\'t--<huff>--keep up!"
	"Come ON! We\'re DEAD if we slow down now!"
	The running footsteps echoed in the long tunnel, splashing water in 
the dim light from the coldlamps hanging in the air like a mist of silver.
Faint and far away, a strange sound was heard for the barest instant, like a 
sudden roll of thunder.
	<whoom>
	"What was THAT, f\'Godsakes?!"
	"I dunno! RUN!"
	There was a splash and a curse, as a body went sprawling in the 
water. In a final disgusting indignity, the puddle was sticky and warm to
the touch....the sound reverberated in the tunnel again, louder this time.
	<Whooom>
	"Get UP, damn yer ass!"
	"What the hell IS that!"
	"Who cares! RUN!"
	Echoing footsteps, light after light passing by overhead in an 
endless stream. Again, the sound. And again, louder still.
	<WHOOOOM>
	"THERE!" Grant skidded to a stop, nearly bowled over from behind
by the others. He pointed at a dim shadow, barely visible on the ceiling
in the darkness between the ill-spaced lights. 
	"Access hatch," he panted. "Kherk! Footstool!"
	The huge Vargr hunched down in the corridor, and Sanchez scrambled
onto his back. Fell and Jaeger steadied his legs as he reached up above his
head and began to work at the lock....
	<WHOOOOMMMM!>
	"What the hell is that NOISE?!" Fell threw a glance over his 
shoulder. "It keeps getting louder...."
	Jaeger stiffened suddenly. "Oh, no," he muttered. "They wouldn\'t.
Not even the SOLOMANI would stoop that low!" He shuddered quietly to himself. 
	"What? WHAT?!"
	"They\'re blasting the tunnels in sequence with live steam from the
main fusion plant," Jaeger gritted. "They mean to boil us alive."
	"Hey, HOLD STILL!" Sanchez teetered for a dangerous moment, then 
recovered himself. "Trying to WORK up here!"
	<WHOOOOOOMMMMMMMM!>
	"Sorry," Kherkhoulloth muttered, trying to still his shivering.
"Boiled alive," he whispered softly. 
	"Straight out of a Fleming novel," Jaeger sighed. "What a positively
TACKY way to die...."
	"Tacky." Fell seemed to be desperately trying not to laugh. Or maybe
scream.... "Tacky." He sighed. "Well, SORRY, Jaeger. These things--"
	<WHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMM!!>
	"--happen." 
	"I FELT that one." Grant touched the curving wall. "In the rock...."
	"GOT IT!" Kherkhoulloth rolled to the side as the access valve
clanged open and Sanchez rode the retractable ladder from the open access
tube down to the floor. He swarmed up the ladder again, panting, "Gotta get
the upper hatch, now...." 
	"Go! Don\'t wait for him! GO!" Grant hustled Fell and Jaeger up the 
ladder after Sanchez.
	"You next, chief," Kherkhoulloth rumbled. "I can take the heat on my
fur better than you can." 
	"Kherk--" Grant was cut off by the rumbling roar of steam, deafening 
now. Chips of plaster fluttered down from the ceiling. 
	"That one was right next door, we\'re NEXT! Don\'t argue!" 
	Grant went up the ladder, three rungs at a time. Kherkhoulloth
hurried after him, pausing in the narrow hatchway to reach down and begin
hauling the ladder back up. Three pulls, four.... 
	The ladder jammed.
	Growling angrily, Kherkhoulloth reached down out of the access hatch
and grabbed the ladder\'s lowest rung. In doing so, he had to poke his muzzle
and head back down into the corridor. "I must look like an idiot," he
snarled. Upside down in a narrow tube, hauling on a stuck-- 
	His eyes widened. A boiling wall of flame was hurtling down the
tunnel toward him. The crash and roar was earsplitting. With a howl of sheer
terror, Kherkoulloth let go of the ladder and grabbed the hatch, hauling
upward with all his might. It hit the ladder with a clang, jarring it loose,
and slammed shut just as the dim tunnel suddenly turned hellishly bright.... 
	Kherkoulloth wasn\'t brave, but Tsogukh was. And if there was one 
thing an Urzaeng Vargr did well, it was enduring pain stoically. He hung 
upside down for a long minute, muscles straining against the slipstream that
was trying to haul the hatch open and suck him into the boiling maelstrom
below, gritting his teeth and whimpering softly as the hatch handle grew 
warm, then hot, then scalding....
	And then it was over. There was only quiet below him. Gently he 
turned the hatch handle a half turn, hissing as the skin peeled away from
his hand. Gingerly he let it go. It held.
	He resisted the urge to faint, forced himself around in the narrow
tube, and began to climb the ladder, hind legs slipping on the rungs, burned
hand clutched to his chest. There was light above him, and a breeze....
	And then they were hauling him out of the vent shaft and easing him 
down onto the hard concrete floor. "You okay, buddy?"
	"I burned my hand," Kherkhoulloth whimpered. "See?" He held the
wounded hand up for the others to inspect. 
	Fell whistled as he gently turned the Vargr\'s hand from side to side.
"Second-degree burns for sure," he said. "You got pretty cooked, furball."
He grinned. "But compared to us ALL getting parboiled, I\'d say that was a
pretty good tradeoff."
	"You would." Kherkhoulloth began licking the wounded hand gingerly.
	"Where are we, anyway?" Fell looked about him with interest. The
wall in which the access tube was set was an interior one, and the ceiling
was high and dimly lit in the stifling heat. The tube opening was well hidden
behind piles of crates, grouped to allow easy access with grav lifters.
	"Storehouse for offshipped items, I\'d guess," Jaeger ventured, 
examining a crate\'s shipping label. "Pah," he muttered disgustedly. "All
computer coded. Nothing to read. Why didn\'t we keep Hector with us?"
	"Because they know we have him," Sanchez sighed. "He can travel 
faster on his own, and meet us when we get the hell out of here." He fumbled 
through the pouch at his waist. "Nope, no code reader," he shrugged. "I guess 
the guy I slugged wasn\'t a stevedore...."
	His voice trailed off at the sound of whistling. Someone was coming 
down one of the aisles.
	Jaeger smiled wickedly. "Methinks I have an idea, gentlesophonts."

	"Ah, \'scuse me a moment!"
	The Transshipment Inspector turned around at the unfamiliar voice.
He saw a somewhat unkempt man in a TI uniform striding toward him across the 
cargo dock. The new arrival was obviously a senior bureaucrat of some kind, 
the Inspector thought with an inward sigh. He carried himself with that 
certain air of arrogance that officials in positions of power tend to 
develop, and he was having a terrible time staying out from under the cargo 
haulers as they rapidly unloaded crates from the AECO monorail cars.
	The Inspector saluted smartly. "What can I do for you, sir?"
	"I\'m ah, really sorry to disturb you, Mister," the bureaucrat said
in an gravelly snarl, "But my partner and I--" He flicked a thumb over his 
shoulder at another man in a TI uniform, poking about the crates with a code 
reader, "--are looking for a mixup in the AECO shipping register for this 
run." He leaned closer to the Inspector. "Probably nothing, but YOU know what
it\'s like dealing with The New Boss, right?"
	The Inspector\'s carefully neutral look faded to a small frown. "Watch 
what you\'re saying, friend," he said mildly. "You KNOW they could be 
monitoring us, right?"
	"Yah, sure," the official grinned, shrugging. "But who cares?" He 
bellowed at the ceiling, "IF THEY\'D LET US DO OUR JOBS!" --his voice returned 
to its previous growl. "--We\'d have a lot less to worry about."
	The Inspector gulped audibly.
	"Here\'s the problem," the official said, handing a codesheet to the 
Inspector. "There\'s been a shipment of carbon film, YOU know, for fusion 
cleanup crews, that\'s gotten mixed up with a shipment of CARTON film, the 
stuff you wrap around piles of crates to keep\'em on the dolly, you know?"
He gave the Inpsector a playful dig in the shoulder. "Simple mixup with the
parser, probably, but you can\'t be sure, so me and the guy in Moscow are 
busy trying to make sure the right shipment went to the right place, see?"
	"Ah." The Inspector nodded, and retrieved a code probe from his shirt 
pocket. He ran the probe over the sheet. "Hmm. That\'d be over here, in the
stuff I haven\'t inspected yet." He pointed down the tube toward the tail of 
the monorail. "I\'m not supposed to skip over any part of the shipment, but 
this doesn\'t look like it\'ll take more than a minute...."
	"Great. I appreciate it. I\'ll mention how helpful you were to your
supervisor...." The official wandered down the bustling dock beside the 
Inspector. Behind him, his partner walked quickly up to a pile of crates
that was being readied for inspection by a stevedore in a cargo lifter, 
and cleared his throat loudly.
	"Yah? So whatchawant?" The stevedore leaned out of the lifter\'s cab, 
chewing on a narco and looking over the official doubtfully.
	"We could use a hand with a quick inspection check, friend," the 
official said mildly. "My partner over there is with your supervisor, 
preparing to crosscheck codes on a shipment that may have been misdirected. 
Would you mind giving them a hand?"
	"I got crates ta move," the stevedore said surlily.
	"Very well," the official shrugged. "I shall find someone more 
willing to help his superiors when a crisis arises." He turned away.
	"Waitaminnit!" The stevedore spat out his narco and gunned the
lifter. "I\'m goin\', I\'m goin\'. Sheez! Humpin\' bureaucrats...."
	The second official watched him go, a small smile on his lips. He
nonchalantly reached down to the customs tag on one of the crates the
stevedore had been about to lift and stack, and yanked it off with a snap.
	"Go," he whispered.
	The lid of the crate opened, and Grant, Kherkhoulloth, and Sanchez
staggered out clumsily. "What a ride," Sanchez managed, as he and the others
slumped down behind a stack of crates, out of sight of the stevedore. Quickly
the official attached a new tag to the crate, and looked up nonchalantly as
his partner returned with the Inspector.
	"Well?"
	"All clear," was the reply. "Damn stevedore had the crate we wanted
on the bottom of the stack, but I was able to do a spot check by lot number.
Looks like the parser did okay, so they\'re NOT gonna get carton film at the
Moscow Power Authority!"
	The Inspector chuckled. "Thank heavens for that. All we\'d need was 
another scandal for the monit--" His mouth snapped shut. "You know," he 
mumbled lamely.
	"Uh-huh," the first official said soothingly. "Thanks for 
everything." He and his partner walked smartly away toward the exit. The 
Inspector watched them go, shaking his head. Then he returned his attention
to the crates....

	"I never never NEVER wanna do that again," Kherkhoulloth muttered
as the group, mingling with the crowds, made its way out into the glaring 
sun. "What a RIDE! Even WITHOUT Sanchez throwing up."
	"That\'s unnecessary," Sanchez snapped uncharacteristically. "When 
one has been (a) interrogated (b) starved (c) subjected to severe physical
and emotional--" He stopped. "Whoops," he smiled sheepishly. "Seems like
there\'s still a little Newton left rattling around in here." He clapped a 
palm to an ear several times, as if knocking water from the other ear.
	"Well, of COURSE there is," Fell said irritably as he stuffed the
official\'s uniform into a trash bin. "He\'s mostly YOU, isn\'t he? Just a
set of fake memories and habits spliced onto your old training. Like 
Tchorgin, or Newton, or...." 
	His voice changed tone suddenly. "AL-JEET!" He began pushing to the 
edge of the air/raft ramp, waving. The others followed him, mystified.
	"Aljeet?" Sanchez scratched his head. "What does--"
	A battered, rattling old air/raft swerved out of the neat lines
of vehicles at the monorail station entry, nearly causing a number of 
accidents. Other drivers leaned out of their cabs and shook their fists
at the cab as its gull-wing doors swung upward to admit the party.
	"HEEYIKE!" Kherkhoulloth yanked the door shut behind him with his 
good hand as the raft rocketed upward, heeling over on one side like a
starfighter. "ARE YOU CRAZY?!"
	Fell rattled off a few quick words in Arabic to the driver, who 
grinned through rotten teeth, sang, "Kham, effendi!" and sent the raft 
shooting across the desert toward the distant towers of Cairo.
	"Do ALL taxi drivers in Egypt go hell bent for leather like this?"
Grant frantically struggled with his seat restraints, trying to strap 
himself in as the raft lurched and stalled, dropping a hundred meters
before it recovered its lift.
	"Of course not, Captain," Fell grinned. "Only the ones who take 
inordinate risks delivering passengers without allowing them to be picked
up by SolSec monitors-- at a price, of course." The driver nodded, grinning.
	"But how could he--ah!" Jaeger nodded understanding. "A code word!"
	"Al-Jitni," Fell nodded. "Jitney. Unregistered hired transport."
He spoke a few more words to the driver, who nodded, his dark face suddenly
serious. The raft swooped downward to one of the Cairo arcology towers, its
vast expanse of terraces and windows looming huge before them.
	"Are we gonna HIT?" Sanchez looked ready to vomit again.
	"Be ready to bail out," Fell barked, popping his seat restraints.

	"I don\'t care WHAT your supervisor says," the young woman sobbed 
tearfully as she blew her nose on her napkin. "It\'s our ANNIVERSARY! You
can\'t just go packing off to, to," She blew her nose with a honk, "To 
CLEVELAND for a week!"
	"Sweetheart," her husband sighed, pouring another cup of coffee,
"If I thought I could ask for a delay, I WOULD have! But I just don\'t know
if he\'d let me get away with it. If I had some sort of sign--"
	His voice was cut off by a shrill scream from his wife. Like a 
breaching whale, a creaking old air/raft had risen to the level of their
balcony, close enough to touch.
	It unceremoniously tilted to one side, a door opening and dumping 
an odd assortment of people onto the balcony next to the tea table. Four 
humans and a Vargr. A HUGE Vargr, at that.
	"Beg pardon." A tall, sharp-faced man tipped an imaginary hat to 
the couple as he made his way inside. The portly fellow in the lead didn\'t
even speak to them.
	"Sorry about this," said the pale blonde man as he ushered the Vargr
through the door. 
	"We really must drop in again," said the foppish-looking youngster
who was last through the door. The husband leaped to his feet and charged 
after them, but they had already gone out the front door of the apartment.
	He turned around and looked at his wife, who was staring in shock at
the rapidly-fading outline of the air/raft as it streaked toward the horizon,
three SolSec speeders in hot pursuit.
	"I\'ll call my supervisor," he whispered. "Now."

make a stab at answering about 2/3 of the questions you ask, and give 
CORRECT answers on about 3/4 of those, but I\'m in Oak Ridge right now
preparing to run an experiment and my mail time is limited. Still, it
can\'t hurt to ask, so send me your questions. 

(We should have a sign up system so everyone gets to answer one question

  In the best of traditions from Monte Python, I\'ll not talk about that, but
about the feasability of doing some serious Traveller work over the TML with
regards to how electronic groups work.

  There has been laboratory studies of how different electronic forums perform
in comparision to face-to-face meetings and even, belive it or not, studies
of the frequencey of flames in different forums.

  The results were that in discussions done through electronic mail there are
less \'stool pigeons\' than in fact-to-face discussions. More ideas were
proposed in them, but they took *much* longer to reach a decision. From the
diagrams they took between three and five times as long time to get something
done.

  I belive that we have seen this in action at least once, and that was one
of the reasons behind why I said that unless a core group of persons in
physical contact with each other is placed as the spiders in the net, there
is no way anything comm*rcially successful will come out of TML.

  (Also note that I have a nagging suspicion that the site that most graciously
lends their resources to serve as the hub of the TML would object rather
strongly if anything comm*rcially successful came out of the TML)

just a couple tidbits that grabbed my attn. -- some of us are supposed to
be working on final projects, not reading mail! :)

On Imperial Colleges:  My opinion is that the Educ increases that we\'ve seen
    in the recent rules for College indicates a liberal-arts style emphasis
    in Imperial education.  The varied courses or whatever the students do
    results in a broad range of knowlege that can best be simulated by an
    increase in the Educ score rather than any particular skills.  Somehow
    it makes sense that IISS Admin would want highly educated officers to
    supervise what must be an insanely complex service, involving a rich
    knowlege about Known Space, how to learn, how to understand a new
    culture, the history of technology, of Imperial philosophy....  It also
    helps explain the initial IISS neutrality in the Rebellion.

    However, I have also used an alternative system which is little-known
    and dates to the 1977 Traveller rules.  Any character may take four
    years off for "college", at a cost of Cr70000.  Instead of the Educ bonus,
    the character may take EITHER one level-two skill OR two level-one skills.
    The player is allowed to select ANY SKILL or skills.  This isn\'t 
    necessarily a college, but simply someplace the skill could be learned.
    (I can\'t imagine learning just Equestrian-2 at college, but you never
    know.... :) )  If College is done as part of generation, I usually waive
    the fee. (Although it might be interesting to have a young character
    with some nasty college loans! :) again!)

On Credit:  I don\'t think the Imperium operates on an interstellar credit
    system like ours.  Travel time would make collecting payments (or for
    that matter, reciepts!) a bit dicey.  Didn\'t an old JTAS have an article
    about Imperial and megacorp sponsored debit cards?  The debit cards are
    very similar in appearance to credit cards, except that they are 
    encoded with a specific balance in credits at the bank, and transactions
    are encoded on them.  Data encryption security for those are even
    tighter than a starship\'s black box -- it takes some hellish levels of
    Computer, Electronics, and Forgery to rig one up.  If the bank decides
    to audit your card, it can take up to seven years to get all the 
    transactions verified by xboat!

It\'s not clear to me either.  Make a ruling.  I\'d allow TAS members get
free basic lodging and food at TAS hotels.  Shipboard it\'s part of the
High Passage.

For naval base size, one might want to go back to the Trillion Credit
Squadron game to get an idea.  Scout base is anyone\'s guess, although I
think there are some published adventures with example scout bases.

No.

That\'s right.  The "official" guidelines are in the 3 boxed MT books of

Well, not exactly.  Usually my systems are first generated with the

mainworld into an extended system generation.

Sigh.

The only info I have is from GEnie, forwarded to the TML archives.  The
only really concrete thing is that they are replacing the 2d6 task
system with a d20 task system, that it is set in about TI 1195, that a
computer virus has contributed to the fall of the Imperium.  I know that
as far as game mechanics go, there are no sacred cows.  I suspect the
history of the imperium will be unscathed, but the mechanics will be
derived from Twilight 2000 in part and MT in part.

No, there is no TML newsgroup, nor does the TML want there to be a TML
newsgroup.  You MUST either subscribe via direct mail or have a site
administrator gateway the incoming mail into a local newsgroup.

===============================================================================
Revised Starship Combat Rules (v1.0) 

[0] Combat Ststistics
    Each ship must have it\'s combat characteristics defined (generally done
    after the design process). 

   * Critical characters (pilot, gunners, etc) must determine their base combat
     efficiency:
        Skill: (none)  0   1  2-3 4-5  6-7  8-9   10
        Effic:   -4   -2  -1   0   +1   +2   +3   +4

   * Hull Capacity: Ship hulls have a limited amount of punishment that they
     can take before becoming incapacitated.  This value is based on hull size
     and armor type.
        HCS = 2 x (Displacement/100)^0.6666 x Armor modifier (below)
        HCD = 12 x (Displacement/100)^0.8333 x Armor modifier (below)

           Soft Steel ........................ x0.248
           Hard Steel ........................ x0.310
           Composite Laminate ................ x0.705
           Lt. Weight Composite Laminate ..... x0.815
           Crystaliron ....................... x1.000
           Superdense ........................ x1.148
           Bonded Superdense ................. x2.214
           Coherent Superdense ............... x4.429

     HCS (Hull Capacity, Streamlining) indicates the number of hits to reduce
     a hull rating one level (Hypersonic-Supersonic-Transonic-Subsonic-Simple).
     Dropping one level indicates a breach -- two levels indicates a serious
     breach.  At three or more the ship has too many holes to be pressurized.
     
{note: Airframe = Hypersonic, Streamlined = Supersonic, Partially Streamlined =
 Transonic.  All others = Unstreamlined rating.  Ratings and speeds from 
 STRIKER}

     HCD (Hull Capacity, Disabling) indicates the number of internal structural
     hits a ship can withstand before becoming a delilect (i.e. cannot maneuver
     else she breaks up).

{Note: These hull damages are meaningless when using a divisional damage
  system, in the notes later on}

[1] Pre-combat
    Before combat, determine the readiness modifier of each critical
    character (pilot, gunners, etc).  The result of an open-ended roll is
    checked to determine their readiness:

    ... -7,-6  -5,-4  -3,-2  -1,0  1,2  3,4  5,6  7,8  9,10  11,12  13,14 ...
    ...   -5     -4     -3     -2   -1   +0   +1   +2   +3     +4     +5  ...

    The open roll is performed as follows: roll 1d6
    a) if 2-5, use that number
    b) if 6, add 5 to the roll of 1d6.  Subsequent 6\'s add 5 and another roll.
    c) if 1, subtract 5 from the roll of 1d6.  Subsequent 1\'s subtract 5 more.

    Thus, rolling a 6 means you get 5+1d6.  However, if you roll another 6,
    on this second roll, you get 10+1d6, and so on until you do not roll
    a 6.  The same process goes for 1\'s.  Once the "direction" is determined,
    you do not consider the other end (i.e., if on a 6 chain, ignore rule "c"
    above).

{Note: Joe Gunner (Gunnery 3, base of 0 (from above) rolls a 6.  Using rule
 "b" he rolls again, getting a 4.  His total is 9, which converts to a +3.
  His gunnery modifier for this encounter is +3.  Fred Gunner (Gunnery 6,
  base of +2) rolls a 1, then another 1, and finally a 5.  Using rule "c"
  his roll is 5 (last roll) -10 (for the two 1\'s) for a -5 total.  On the
  table, this is a -4 modifier, so he starts combat with a -2 rating.}

    Thus, on average, critical characters will operate at or near their
    normal efficiency.  However, some will start off very well, while some
    will be having a very bad day.  

    As combat turns go by, the readiness will improve (if negative) or degrade
    (if positive) at a chance determined by the quality of the position
    (cramped vs. roomy, no HUD, HUD or Holo-HUD, etc).

{Note: As combat turns go by, the ratings are improved or reduced to the base
levels.  Thus, as combat goes by, Joe will tire and eventually have a +0
rating, while Fred will eventually get the kinks out and be operating at his
normal +2 rating.  How fast their levels change will depend on the equipment
they have to work with.  Good equipment will eliminate negative penaties faster
and slow the rate of degredation.  Likewise, Poor or primitive equipment will
hasten a loss of "edge" and make "getting up to speed" longer.  In addition,
small or cramped workstations or cocpits will increase the rate of degredation
and slow the rate of improvement.  (However, unlike the equipment, they do
not have the opposite effects if large and roomy)}

    For small ships, one readiness check is made per gunner.  For larger
    ships, one is made per section (laser weapons, missile weapons, etc).

{I really like this system.  It adds a bit of "readiness" to combat encounters.
To simulate combat readiness or laxity, one can ignore rules "b" and "c"
as required. (thus, "Ship \'O Fools", with a Lax crew, would not reroll and add
on 6\'s, but would reroll and subtract with any 1\'s).  If used with the proposed
d20 system, add the values above to the skill rating before calculation
of skill level.}

[2] Combat Sequence
[3] Damage Resolution
[4] Post-Combat

{Note: I never got to this stage.  The following are notes I made, to be
chopped up and placed in the above document.}

    2) In combat, 2d6+(gunner rating)+(weapon accuracy rating)-(pilot rating)-
       (agility rating)-(defensive rating) is cross-checked on a firing table
       corresponding to the number of weapons fired (may use HG numbers for
       space saving) to determine the number of weapon hits.  The amount of
       computer resources devoted to the weapon system improves the basic
       accuracy bonus.  Likewise, the amount of resources devoted to evasive
       actions will determine the computer add to the ship\'s defensive rating.

{More detail below on this}

    4) Weapon accuracy\'s are based on ease of tracking and hitting (i.e. 
       beam lasers are +1, while pulse lasers are +0).

{Yea, standard stuff}

    5) Computer Power is "allocated" for different tasks.  Using the Maximum
       CP input as a "power rating", "allocate" these CP\'s for combat tasks.
     
       example: The ship\'s computer has <what ever fits, I don\'t have my book 
       with me> a limit of 15CP.  If the ship has two gunnery positions, the
       pilot may allocate 5CP to each gunnery position and reserve 5CP for
       evasive action control.

       This simulates the computer power dedicated toward target location
       prediction (i.e. Predict programs from book 2) as well as "Jinking"
       and "facing" changes for defeating such programs (i.e. Maneuver/Evade).
       
       The number of CP required for each bonus is some power function,
       not linear.  The power function for evasion ramps up faster and starts
       at a higher number.  [Note: Somebody good at "does it look reasonable"
       math please come up with some functions...I was thinking of 
       2+CP^2 for gunnery and 3+CP^3 for evasion.

{Note: This needs to be rewritten as it is kind of confusing.  Basically,
for a +3 Evasion, 3+3^3 (or 30) CP are needed.  For a +3 gunnery, 2+3^2
(or 11) CP are needed.  Evasion requires more CP due to the need to swing
a whole ship around instead of just a turret.  Presumably, Evasion bonuses
are limited to maneuver G rating.  Targeting bonuses could be limited by
sensor\'s available or TL.  Spinal mounts would use the Evasion formula.}
  
{Note: This rule above was to bridge the gap between the old Book-2 programs
and post-HG combat with "computer Model" modifiers.  This Method allows a
starship commander to determine how computer resources are allocated.
Conceivably, each gun position COULD have it\'s own computer and dedicated
CP allotment, with the ability to be augmented by the main computer.  I agree
that this system could very well be unweildy with HG style ships, but in
"player-scale" combats, I think it is a good balance.  This system could be
extended to include sensor tasks.}

    6) The Hit tables correspond to the HG ratings:
   
               ---- Roll ----
       Beams:  0-  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 ....
          1    -- -- -- -- -- --  1  1  1  1   1  1 ....
          2    -- -- -- -- --  1  2  2  2  2   2  2 ....
          3    -- -- -- --  1  1  2  3  3  3   3  3 ....
          6    -- -- --  1  2  3  4  6  6  6   6  6 ....
         10    -- --  1  2  3  6  8 10 10 10  10 10 ....
                  
                  etc...  This chart is in no way accurate, just a
                     guide to what I was talking about.

{NOTE: This was an attempt to get around the "30 lasers fire at the ship,
and one hits" bugaboo in High Guard.  The "Roll" above is the
base roll (on 2d6, before modifiers) to hit.  I agree this still needed work.}

{end of notes}
===============================================================================
The rules above were my (initial) attempt to make traveller combat more
personal and less abstract than HG (and the botched MT hack of it) version.
My multiple laser rule was an attempt to add some sort of "bracketing" 
ability without having to roll for each laser, yet allow for more than
"one" hit.  

One change I mentioned a while ago (which may have been sent to you in the
packets, but I am not sure) is the "Gal Force" style lasers.  To re-cap:

             //
  Laser     //----
  Vane --> //+----
          //++---- Reflected Lasers, to target ---->
         //+++----
        //++++----
       //|||||
#################################
########## Ship Hull ################
###########################################


Lasers are arranged in banks, with anywhere from 1 to 30 lasers per
bank (usually in a line, but in a rectangle for large numbers).

The vane, with is movable for targeting, focuses the lasers on a single
impact point (each vane has a targeting mirror for each laser in the bank,
in addition to the vane itself being able to rotate and move).
Damage to the target ship equals number of lasers - armor protection
(note: this is different from my above "Note 6".  In that, the number of
lasers hitting depends on how well you bracket the target.  In this
idea, a hit is all or nothing.  Note, however, a 30 laser hit is NOT a
single point of damage, but 30x damage).

Laser vanes can be folded down for atmosphere operations and to protect
the mirrors from normal travel damage (microdust, etc).  

As I stated in that old post, Missiles need not be in turrets.  At TL 9+
they can target on their own, given aquisition data from the gunner and
the ship\'s sensor array.  So missile banks are simply tubes along the sides
of the ship (like torpedo tubes).  Computer CP in this case is used to
provide a clearer sensor "picture" for the missile before launch.
Damage from missiles, being individual objects, would use my "Note 6" above,
since with 30 missiles flying at the target, it is possible for all, none,
or some to hit the target, depending on how agile the target is, how smart
the missiles are, etc.  Missile bays simply allow either more of the smaller
missiles, or larger ones (which are harder to kill with sand, see below).

Sand is handled similar to Screens in 2300ad.  Sand banks provide a metalic,
ablative screen around the ship.  In HG terms, the ship requires one factor
of sand for every ship size. (i.e. while a 100t Scout can get by with 1 
sandcaster, providing Factor 1 protection, a 1000t escort requires 10
sand banks for the same protection.  However, the actual scaling should
be based on the AREA of the ship\'s increase, (i.e. .6666 power law), so the
1000t excort would need (10^.666) or 4.6415 (round to 5) sand banks.
Sandcasters are not a Single unit, but spread over the ship (i.e. 1 Sandcaster
might actually be 100 seperate dispensors over the hull).  The other half
of the Caster is the hull grid that generates the magnetic fields to keep the
sand screen around the ship.  The sand rating is considered when determining
how many missiles hit, and reduces the amount of laser damage.  Sandscreens
will obviously require more power now.

Particle beams are handled as they are now, as turrets.  However, they
too add the number of particle beams to get the particle damage (before
being reduced by sand or armor).

Armor has the effect of reducing weapon damage.  I suggest a divisional
method, as used in STRIKER for breaches.

(Note that this system already allows some abstraction (for lasers).  While
missile damage is handled on a per-missile basis, you could just break the
damage into 2 or 3 hits (for large volleys) and then apply the armor.)

A simple fractional table could be given for quick reference.

beyond these levels are the extreme armor ratings, where the ship is basically
all armor...

 1/18   ...   AAA    (A3)
 1/24   ...   AAAA   (A4)
 1/30   ...   AAAAA  (A5)
 1/36   ...   AAAAAA (A6)

Armor determines effectiveness of any attack.

(Example: Ship Alpha has B rated armor, while Ship Beta has E rated armor.
  Both ships, armed with laser vanes, attack.  Alpha (a gunship) gets 2
  laser hits (each vane has 10 lasers).  Beta also hits with its one vane,
  containing 5 lasers.

  For beta, each 10x laser hit translates into a 5x internal hit.  This
  leaves 5x external energy, which converts to a 3x surface hit.  The remainder
  is lost.  Obviously, beta suffers from two of these.

  Alpha takes a 5x laser hit, which translates to a 1x internal hit.  The
  remaining 4x energy becomes a 1x surface hit.

Internal hits damage Drives, crew areas, power, etc.  Surface hits knockout
external weapons (i.e. non-spinal), sensors and external screens (Sandscreen
grid), communications, streamlining, jump drive grid, etc.

High-energy weapons (Particle, X-ray laser, fusion/plasma) reduce armor
rating by one level.  Very High Energy Weapons (Nuke Missile, Antimatter)
reduced it by 2 levels.

Screens can use the same chart, if given ratings the same as hull armor.
Basically, if the two defenses are the same rating the mutual protection
is one level greater.  If there is too much difference, there is
no significant change.

(Example: A Gunship has B Class Armor and B Class screens.  Being the same
level means the ship has an effeective protection of Class A.  If the screens
are damaged, and are reduced to Class C, they no longer provide significant
protection over the armor, and the ship now has Class B protection.)

This idea would definately work better with a larger armor spread (from 15/20
to 1/20)

===============================================================================
I used 12 steps on the above chart, because 12 is a nice number.  You can just
as well use 10, 20 or some other number, but remember that useful armoring
doesn\'t begin until the 1/2 mark.  Unarmored ships, on the above table, would
be rated at EE (3/4) armor.  Armor rating, of course, is based on Armor
Hardness and thickness.  Higher numbers allows greater variation with
regards to High-energy Pentration (i.e., with a a table based on 1/20,
Fusion/Plasma could have -1 rating, Particle and Xray at -2 ratings, etc).

===============================================================================
Weapon Limitations:  I suggest that surface weapons be limited based on 
surface area, not ship size.  A 1350kl ship has a surface area of 732 M^2 if
a cube, 590 if a sphere.  Split the difference for "normal" ships,
you get 661 square meters.  From this, configuration can alter this basic
rule of thumb (-10% for spherical or disk ships, +10% if close structure
or box, +20% if dispersed structure, +40% if open frame)  As volume increases,
area increases to 
the .666 power (this can be tabulated), so a 2700kl ship (200t) has an area of
1049 M^2.  After lopping off X% for drives (based on G-acceleration) and
Y% for Jump Grid (based on jump number), and a reasonable amount for general
ship stuff (air locks, landing jacks, windows, etc), the remainder is
available for weapons, sensor arrays, sandscreens and commo equipment.

This allows the removal of the "hardpoint" limitations.  If you got the
hull area, you can put on the weapons. 

In my games, I gave each race a specific style of ship.  The Imperium used
mainly wedge and cone forms, the Zhodani used close structures.  Aslan
prefered Needle forms.  K\'Kree used Spheres or Disks.  Hiver ships were
usually irregular shapes.  Vargr used everything, but also tended toward 
needles, wedges or disks.  These form preferences are for capital ships and
orbital-only ships.  Landers or other atmospheric ships tended to be
more similar.  If these new rules are used, racial preference could make
a difference in ship effectiveness, so to offset this perhaps a "bonus" could
be assigned to prefered configuartions, at the expense of a loss in other
configurartions. (1/2 the bonus or penalty of the shape, or 5%)

(Example: Imperial Design prefers wedges and cones, so an additional 5% of
hull area is given.  However, Spherical ships are the least prefered, so
they are further penalized by losing 5% more for a -15%.  
Zhodani ships, being more
close structured, get +5% (giving +15% total over "normal" styles), but
dislike dispersed styles, losing half of the normal dispersed structure
or open frame bonus, for a total of +10% and +20%, respectively).

Note:  Because hull volume goes up faster than hull area, this idea makes
SDB\'s and Battle Riders much more viable (i.e., no need to leave room for
a jump grid)

This rule also means that a 1,000,000t ship cannot have 1,000 times the number
of weapons (only 100x).  Because of this, large capital ships will not have
multitudes of small guns, but instead have larger ones.  The purpose
of smaller guns, to shoot down missiles and fighters, is left to escort
ships.

Since, in the above rules, AREA has to be calculated, it should be the basis
of any to-hit modifiers based on ship size.
===============================================================================
Well, there are some of My ideas to y\'all at GDW.  I hope you can get 
something useful out of them.

That is another general complaint of the MT rules.  One of the things that bugs

TL14.

I am trying to remember those books.  I think book 8 was an expansion of the
JTAS artical.  There was another robot system in one of the Dragon Magazines
that we used alot which was totally different.

>What does exactly NOE mean ???

Nap Of the Earth.  It is used in aircraft which describes flying an aircraft
close to the earths terrain.  It is typically listed as NOE speed, or the speed
in which the craft can fly and make flight adjustments based on the terrain.
For example, an FB-111 with it\'s terrain following radar has a much higher NOE
speed than an F-4 without.

That is true, but the promotion is not automatic.  And they only get one

Flight School is 2 years unless you wash out, in which case it is one.  You
can\'t just spend brownie points to get skills.  You could however, use them to
modify your chances to get the skills you role for.

Yes, they have to pay.  Think of TAS as the AAA of space.  There is free

you out of trouble at times.  I would assume that TAS issues an ID card.

As the designer, I quite agree.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  It is, however,
_legal_ by the current rules, and as the folks on GEnie insisted to me, _the
way the rule is intended to be_.  I wrote the ship up as part of a protest
to show how stupid the rule is.

I guess a card debit system would work but what about non-Imperials
or non-megacorp employees? Or for that matter visitors from those
small out of the way planets? My brain is rusty this morning, but is
there a banking megacorp? And does it extend beyond the Imperium(i.e.
into Vargr, Aslan, Solomani, etc. territory).

I would assume that each system used would be different from the 
others. Each would have their own \'best\' method of implementing
the security features. 

On a similar note. How are identifications achieved? As in, how could
anyone prove who they are?

I wouldn\'t say they would have to be in physical contact (it would help
though) but someone, the project leader for instance, would have the
final decision as agreed upon by the others. 

I made a similar observation in an earlier posting (msg 3131 Nov 20)
about putting together some house rules. The TDR seems to be the
closest thing to this but from what I read it is very sketchy at best.

If a commercial product was produced I would think some sort of
corporation would have to be formed in order to operate. However,
that would create another set of problems.

I have an idea but I\'ll save it for later. :-)

No, not really.  There is a slightly extended sequence in the World Builder\'s 
Handbook, but it really doesn\'t tell you much more.  It\'s one of the things you
pretty much have to make up if you want detail.

Hmmm...well, they\'re making a mistake, because they are quite good.

Not really.  I mean, you could always just add +1 to Aslan Str and -1 to Aslan 
Dex, and do the opposite for Vargr, and then run them through the normal 
system, but that doesn\'t have much flavor.

Only when they absolutely have to.  There are not really any examples that I
can immediately think of in the existing Traveller literature to support
much more of an answer.

Not me, really.  Adrian Hurt, Marc Volovic, and Bertil Jonell are all vocal

Scott definately uses a spreadsheet.  However, since he just headed home for
Christmas, he won\'t be around for a few days to give details.  I just use
a pad of graph paper and start putting things down in columns.  You get faster
the more you do, and you figure out pretty soon which things can be safely
ignored, and how to plan ahead a little bit.  I\'ve got a set of \'guidelines\'
I wrote up once before, which I\'ll dig out and repost.

Probably I can, but you\'ll have to be a little more specific.  The first thing 
to do is to check out the very important little chart on the lower right corner
of the power plants page heade "Economies of Scale" or some such.  Any large
fusion plant delivers three times the listed basic output, which is critical
in ship design although a little less so for vehicles.

Regrettably the ships in the I.E. are full of flaws, errors, and typos.  
Regarding the 3x business, though, might it have something to do with the
economy of scale chart?

As I recall, it\'s more of an elaboration than a replacement, with the exception
of the section on design of brains.  Certainly as an approximation, anything
built using the rules from the old JTAS articles can be duplicated with Book 8.

In a nutshell, yes.

Most scout bases shown in the literature have been quite small--no more than
four or five landing sites plus a repair/refueling facility.  I figure that
most naval bases that are not located on high population worlds are also
rather small, with few ships permanently based there.  Their refueling 
facilities may be substantial, though, based on the Fifth Frontier War board
game rules.

There are no official guidelines, except for the design rules.  You are right,
we designers all have our own pet theories and standard methods, but most all
the stuff posted here has been legal under the rules.  I expect most work along
the lines of:

     1. Consider what the vehicle needs to do.
     2. Consider whether price or performance is more important.
     3.  Consider if any special features are needed due to intended use,
        such as sonar for a sea vehicle, or heavier than usual armor for
        corrosive atmospheres.
     4.  Start designing.
     5.  Evaluate completed design...was it fast enought, did it carry enough 
         cargo, or whatever.
     6. If not, start over at step 4.


> 9) How far out are the vehicles in the encyclopedia from the truth ?

Pretty far in some cases.  Sad but true.


Others have handled some of the other questions...

Well, it depends on your definition of decent.  Personally, I think of 13 as 
the bottom end of \'what\'s militarily useful\', given the present Imperial
situation, and TL11 as the bottom end of \'what\'s commerically useful\'.

What did you mean?

After reading through the numerous files that people have posted,
here\'s a vague synopsis. I\'m sure I\'ll probably not match what everyone
had in mind, so if there\'s something you severely disagree with, say so.
(Like I have to tell this group anything about speaking out). Anyway, here
it is.

The largest compaint/recurring thought was the proofreading and format
of the publications from GDW. The ideas are often presented poorly, and
information is often hard to find. The general thought behind this was:
please proof your publications better, and ley them out in a consistent
format.

The second hotest topic to recur was the idea of keeping the same task
system. Barring that, the next biggest round was for keeping a good task
system, although few people have posted anything about it since the
system that GDW had in mind was explained.

Beyond this, everyone began to shatter into their own ideas of what was
really needed in Traveller 3. Some of ideas were:
>Keep the basic rules simple, but include complex designs in supplements
>Revert the desgin process to Striker type rules for the serious
ironmongery
>Include details and thoughts as to life (economics, robots, medical)
in the future and make rules to keep up with this.
>Fix the science rules so that it is reasonably consistant with some basic
ides, like conservation of energy. Mostly this revolves around Power plants
and propulsion systems.

Hope this provides something of use,
                                             Joe

Subject: (1529)  Thoughts on Vehicle Design

I\'ve been at the drawing boards again.  After thinking about it, there seemed 
to be a few useful(?) reminders to those who want to do a bunch of designs.

SO:

How to Design a Traveller Vehicle Quickly (Rob\'s Rules)
       (without using a computer)

Rule#1: If it doesn\'t matter, don\'t worry about it.  The most critical example 
of this is power consumption for electronics on most vehicles.  Unless a 
vehicle is extremely small, the total of these values is almost always negli-
ble.  Thus, you can size your power plant at the beginning of the process 
based on an estimate of power required for weapons, environmental controls 
(only if grav plates are being used), and grav/thruster use.  There are a 
couple of rules of thumb to remember.  "Full environment" (basic env, basic 
and extended life support, grav plates and inertial compensation) uses 
1MW/displacement ton.  If your vehicle is heavily armored, the three most 
massive components are likely to be the hull, the grav drive, and the power 
plant.  You can fuss with these numbers to get a good estimate of grav per-
formance.

Rule#2: Decide what is critical first, and set your hull size accordingly. For 
example, I wanted a TL12 small vehicle carrying a Plasma-B gun.  Energy on 
that is 13.5 MW, dictating a power plant of at least 6kl.  Usually I build 
vehicles around 1)the weapon 2) The accomodations (i.e., if you need roomy 
seats for 16 people, this will drive the rest of the design) or 3) The speed.

Rule#3: Decide what factor is being optimized, and ignore the rest--this 
usually means that in working on a combat vehicle I set the armor and weapon 
and let the speed come out to be whatever it will be, or in building an inex-
pensive vehicle I don\'t add any "chrome", or in building a fast vehicle I 
avoid as many massive add-ons as possible.  

Rule#4: Having one vehicle makes a variant very easy--something like the 4 
Tiger class vehicles I posted a while ago took 40 minutes to do the first, and 
maybe 10 minutes apiece for the others, even including the time to write 
everything down again, because 95% of each one was copied from the previous 
one.

Rule#5: Unless it really doesn\'t work, finish every design:  Real governments 
have put some dreadful designs in the field, based usually on a false concept 
of the conditions the vehicle would face, and there is no good reason that  
things should be any better in the future.  So unless the hull is too small to 
stuff everything into, or you\'ve put so much armor on that it can\'t possibly 
fly, finish it.  (And assign it to that country/world you don\'t like...)

Rule#6: Governments don\'t care what it costs.  I have the dubious pleasure of 
working for the U.S. Army as a civilian engineer, and this is certainly true. 
So when I\'m doing military vehicles, I pile in the sensors and other chrome. 
How much is 5% extra capability worth in combat???


SOME NOTES ON THE DEAN DESIGN COLLECTION

Since quite a few of my designs have accumulated by this time, I thought I had 
better assemble a few comments on the unofficial changes I have made to var-
ious elements of the design systems to allow people to reinterpret them to 
taste. 

These notes include interpretations, changes, presumed errata corrections and 
miscellaneous comments, and are keyed to the design system flowchart. 

Basic Hull Design:

I generally ignore the ambiguous maximum armor rule from the narrative, for 
two reasons- it makes no sense as there is really no limit to how thick a 
piece of steel can be, and increasing price and weight cause their own penal-
ties.

On many vehicles I ignore the turret rules if I can fit all my components into 
the base volume.  If the hull weight/cost tables were linear instead of dis-
continuous, there would be no difference between the cost and weight (the 
important factors) of a hull 10 +40% turret and a hull 14.  Power requirements 
to move the turret are almost always neglible in the overall design, unless 
you have a very large turret on a small vehicle with a tiny power 
supply--which has never come up in a "realistic" design.

Power Supply:

The incredible fuel consumption for fission plants given in the book has been 
discussed at some length on the list in the past.  Let it suffice to say that 
I usually use the .003 kl/year rule that I suggested, and anyone who disagrees 
may apply an appropriate fudge factor to the endurance of any of my fission 
designs.  Fuel cells are the best high tech power system for anything up to 
about 2 or 3 megawatts.  If you need more, go fusion--small fusion plants are 
useless except as technological curiosities. I generally have no problem with 
installing more energy consuming devices than the power plant can run at one 
time, so long as important limits are noted (e.g. no maneuver drive and energy 
weapons at the same time) and all important systems can be powered at the same 
time (maneuver and life support at a minimum). There has been discussion in 
Traveller\'s Digest and on the list regarding fractional use of power plants.  
I consider this to be reasonable, and recent designs list endurance at typical 
power settings as well as at maximum power.  Fuel usage is  considered to be 
proportional to energy output, an assumption which should possibly be modified 
for small vehicles whose lower energy levels are below the "economy of scale" 
factors.  Batteries should probably have their control point requirements 
ignored, and should also probably be rated in terms of hours at the expected 
output requirement.  Thus, if you have 1-MW/hr of batteries, you could figure 
a ground vehicles speed either on the basis of 1MW of output with a 1 hour 
endurance, or 0.5MW output with a two hour endurance, or some other reasonable 
combination.  My feeling is that there would probably be a  design limit to 
the speed with which the batteries could be discharged. Starship power re-
quirements can usually be estimated at the start of a design by figuring the 
desired life support (all goodies works out to 1MW per disp ton), the maneuver 
drive requirment, and any weapons and shields you want to be able to use at 
the same time as the maneuver drive.

Locomotion:

My recent designs have been listed with two sets of statistics for maneuver
drives, one being the straight Maneuver=3 or whatever, and the second being
(Thrusters=3250t) or the like.  Those numbers are calculated on the basis of
one thruster or anti-grav maneuver unit = 650t thrust, which corresponds to
equal energy consumption for anti-grav units.  In this rationalization  
thrusters require more energy to do whatever double talk allows them to oper-
ate beyond gravity wells at full efficiency.  Although I haven\'t done it, my 
extrapolation would permit thruster units to be placed in any size craft, so 
long as the unit is at least 0.4 "units" large. (5.4kl minimum). For most 
player-class craft, these rules result in approximately the same amount of 
total acceleration capability.  I have a disagreement with the rules over the 
agility question, which I have discussed at great length before.   In essence, 
I have always played that ships may have multiple devices which use the "same" 
power (but not at the same time), so that maneuver power can be fed to the 
weapons as long as you are willing to accept a reduced or zero acceleration as 
a result.  Between that habit, and some calculations about vectors, angles and 
so forth of space combat, I am firmly convinced that the most important factor 
in a ship\'s ability to avoid being hit in space combat is dependent on the 
gross effects of its maneuver drive, and that agility should therefore be 
equal to drive rating, provided that you are not "double dipping" the drive 
power for weapons.  I have always believed that this was the intent of High 
Guard, and I think it works well with the thruster tons suggestion above for 
acceleration, since it has the desired effect of making heavily armored ships 
slow and non-agile.  More comments on this under weapons.

In the thrust based suspensions for smaller vehicles, it should be noted that
the minimum thrust for standard grav is one ton, the minimum for low power
heavy grav is 0.4 tons, and the minimum for low power light grav is 0.1 tons.
Except at the very lowest thrusts and power levels, a tradeoff analysis will
always favor standard grav.  Example tanks in 101 Vehicles using LP-HGrav
could have their overall costs reduced by 50% by using std grav, even includ-
ing the need for additional fusion plant and higher thrust to maintain per-
formance.

In contact based suspension, the minimums for volume of wheels and tracks as
revised by the errata (1.5 and 2% respectively) are fairly generous.  Striker
heavily penalized high ground pressure vehicles (reasonably), and although
the complexity is probably not merited in MegaTraveller, I have always aimed
to keep my ground pressures around the 5-6 dividing line between high and
low off road performance in deference to reality.  The rules are also unclear
as to whether P/W should be figured using total power or power after all other
devices are powered.  Because of the method of calculating transmission size,
I have assumed the former, which means that the "power requirments" of the
wheels and tracks can pretty much be ignored.  If there is any doubt, the
power plant must supply at least enough to power the suspension, but I\'d
figure that into the P/W.  Thus, it\'s only effect is to put a lower boundary
on a vehicles power plant size, which is unlikely to be a problem unless you
are trying to use batteries or some such.

Communications:

In almost all cases, except for very small vehicles and low tech level de-
vices, the only important factor for communicators in the final design is 
price.  I usually don\'t get too worked up over having .03MW of power used for 
electronics in a craft with 2MW of power, so I frequently ignore them when 
adding up power requirements. I also usually like to have a back-up communica-
tor on board all spacecraft. Just a matter of taste.  The credits saved by 
leaving out the  backup are usually negligible in a starship design.

Sensors and Electronics:

As with communicators, most of the time price is the only important factor.
Lower tech large EMS arrays may end up using enough power to worry about, and
military vehicles sensors may be important.  Don\'t forget that active and
passive EMS include all the smaller single purpose electromagnetic sensors.

Weapons:

The meson gun is the king of starship weapons.  Nothing else available at
Imperial tech levels will kill a ship with one shot.  Armor is irrelevant
to meson guns, and screen are really only effective against the smaller
ones.  Thus, no battleship needs to be bigger than necessary to carry and
serve the meson gun.  Since agility is one of the better defenses, and my
version of agility calculations places a premium on light armor, I\'m finding
that there may be some limited utility in large particle accelerators to
damage and inhibit the construction of unamored meson gun carriers.
Lighter armor also gives fighter and SDBs something to do, though they had
better have large computers to be effective at TL15.

While the rules are clear about turrets taking up 13.5kl regardless of the
number of weapons installed, the TD example starship construction from
issue #14 incorrectly shows triple laser turrets taking up 40.5kl.  I also
usually figure that the turret weight about the same regardless of the 
number of weapons, which is probably not what is intended.  On most ships
the difference is not significant.  Any of my ships without specified missile
magazines need to load missiles in cargo space.

I have used turret mounted direct fire mortars in some designs of TL8 and 9
military vehicles.  These are not permitted by the rules, but exist in the
real world, so I extrapolated.

Cluster bomblets, tactical missiles, and rocket launcher artillery should be
put back into the game from Striker for use in military adventures.

Mass driver gun calculations should give rate of fire in rounds per second,
not round per minute.  (Error in Striker translation).  Without making this
change, MD guns are probably not cost effective.

Point Defense rules need to be put back in from Striker.

Screens:

All meson screen power consumptions should be divided by ten according to
Trav Digest#14. (e.g. UCP1=.015, UCP2=.03)  I have left specifics of 
obscuration devices off of recent military vehicle designs.  Their power,
weight and cost are negligible, and if needed I would specify a reasonable
number before combat (say 3 or 4 dozen maximum).  I don\'t like the little
sandcasters because I don\'t think the particles would stay airborne long 
enough to do much.  No rules for any of these gadgets are provided, either.

Bridge:

I usually go ahead and put in basic env, basic ls, ext ls, grav plates and
inertial compensators for the entire volume of a starship.  I haven\'t found
that it drives power requirments up too horribly for merchant ships.

To maintain consistency, I do calculate the control point requirements for the
hull, despite my difficulty with increased armor requiring more control.

For a military starship, there can be no excuse for not putting in the biggest
computer available at your tech level.

Based on the Starship Operator\'s Manual descriptions, I almost always use 
holographic linked panels when available, because I figure the using character
would want them.  I try not to install more add-ons than I have crew members
to use them. 101 Vehicles has an implied rule change allowing you to use 
linked panels without a computer, which I have never taken advantage of.

Accommodations:

Rule 3, reduced vehicle gunners, still looks bad after the errata: (C+S)/W,
since S is usually substantially larger than C, and I\'d think that your
computer would have more to do with it.  What I use is X=C/(W/S) and some
common sense.

Rule 4, supplanted vehicle commander says X=(T-S)/C, which has the effect of
making it impossible to get rid of the vehicle commander if the total cost
of the vehicle apart from the sensors is greater than 100,000C/TL.  The best
value of C/TL is 8 at Comp 9, TL15, and Cr800,000 doesn\'t buy much of a
TL15 grav tank.  I think that X=(T/S)/C, plus some common sense works better.

In very light vehicles, I usually calculate the weight of seats at 0.1t rather
than 0.02t to allow for the weight of the passenger.  This is almost always
ignorable on large vehicles.

Starship command crews look awfully bloated to me, especially in cases where I
am carrying a 130 man marine company on a small vessel.  I usually reduce them
with the same formula as the bridge crew, which satisfies my prejudices.  If
the total was less than 10, there was no reduction.

Fuel:

If necessary, ships could jump as soon as the fuel processor had done enough
fuel for the jump, rather than waiting for the full load to be processed.
Fuel scoops and purifiers are almost always economically justified.

Design Evaluation:

For all of my vehicles unless otherwise noted, the prices *do not* include
a bulk discount.  Cost of small craft is included unless otherwise noted, or
a generic description (e.g. 1*4ton vehicle) is the only mention.
In grav vehicle speeds, I usually give them in terms of the "vacuum" speed,
so they should be multiplied by .9 for standard atmosphere, to taste.  I have
also interpolated values on occasion.  If you tried to use the rules as 
written, many airframe configuration craft could go faster in thin atmosphere
than in a vacuum, which doesn\'t look right.  Purists might wish to recalculate
lift requirements for grav vehicles based on local gravity. I don\'t usually
bother.

I don\'t remember the formula either.  I think that there is a certain
amount of energy which is enough to overcome ALL of the gravitational

energy, then you can divide out mass from the equations and get an
escape velocity.  I would say that for a jump drive to land you 1/2
way between Sol and Alpha Centauri, it would have to expend more than
enough energy to bring the ship to escape velocity.

Also, I might have misled you by saying that both Sol and Alpha Centauri
dominate the equations.  This would be true perhaps if a ship jumped
directly from Sol to Alpha Centauri.  Jumping only half way, though...
Hmm...  I guess that you do lose potential energy over that 2 lightyear
span.  I don\'t know how much it would account for so far away from
Alpha Centauri, though.

I was thinking along the lines of Larry Niven style jump drives, I guess.
In that case, jumps are made between stars, not into open space.

OK, so maybe altering the stats won\'t be enough.  But Jump-4 and

You\'re right, and open-ended rolls can be made on d6\'s (6 means
roll again and add 5, 1 means roll again and subtract 5 -- once
you roll a 6 or 1, the other (1 or 6) loses its special meaning).

I\'m not sure exactly what the objection is here.  As you know,
the primary solar fusion reaction involves purely light
hydrogen.  The key observation is that a hydrogen *atom is* a
neutron -- QUESTION: what\'s the difference between a
proton-electron pair and a neutron?  ANSWER: a mass defect and
a bunch of empty space.  A free neutron will eventually decay
into a proton and electron, and release a tiny bit of energy.
If the objection is that the barrier potential to overcome to
squeeze a p-e pair into a neutron is very large, I\'ll concede
this, but I\'ve always assumed they could just do it, at least
by TL14 or so...

A comment or two on the rules:  It\'s been pointed out here that the rules 
state that a starship should have three computers.  They do not, however,
say that these three have to be of the same model.  I\'ve used this dodge 
once or twice before, and when I do, I almost always calculate the control 
and crew requirements based on the worst computer, and the combat modifications
based on the best computer.  I made a small exception with the Starflare
shown below.  If the gunnery crew is figured on the basis of the Model 5 
computer, 19 gunners are needed to operate the four turrets and the damper.
This seemed a little excessive--1 per turret plus 15 for the damper?  After
all, these things are \'optimized\' because by TL15 they are old and well
understood technology.  Using the Model 9 resulted in 5 gunners--one per
turret and one for the damper which seemed a little more reasonable.

Trying to shoehorn everything into the Starflare was a bit of a mess.  In
the process I decided that I had better give the detailed fuel use numbers,
in case anyone actually wanted to use one of these things.  (I think it
would work nicely as the main ship in the adventure from MTJ#2.)  I see
no reason why the maneuver drive should be running in Jump space, which
means that a detailed fuel use calculation should probably allow for 
power only for life support in Jump.


Good Gaming,

Kontos class Fighter-Launch TL15

     The Kontos class is the result of a design project sponsored by the 
Planetary Navy of Mora in 1110.  The prototype was completed by the notorious 
Moran branch of TrinTechnics in late 1112, on time and slightly under budget.  
Flight testing was satisfactory, and the Moran Navy contracted with TrinTech-
nics for a full scale production run beginning in 1114.  Several hundred 
craft were completed when news of Emperor Strephon\'s assassination reached 
Mora.  The production line was expanded shortly thereafter, and sales were 
permitted to registered armed vessel operators (Starmercs).  By 1121, over 
two thousand had been produced.

     The Kontos is popular among small AVOs due to its clever multi-purpose 
design, which gives a great deal of operational flexibility without impairing 
the craft\'s usefulness as a fighter.  For most operations the relatively 
short endurance is not a problem.  Bunks are installed to provide a minimum 
level of long-term accommodation for the regular two man crew if a multi-day 
patrol is necessary.  The asymmetrical computer installation allows easy 
operation in routine conditions and good combat responsiveness at a low cost, 
with some loss of damage capacity. The Model 7 computer installation accounts 
for nearly 50% of the cost of the base model.  Some production models have 
also been sold with a down-sized battle computer installation--a Model 5 set 
up at a total cost of MCr27.58, and a Model 3 set up at a total cost of 
MCr21.69.

Starflare class Close Escort TL15

     The Starflare was designed and produced by the Mora branch of TrinTech-
nics.  The first test model was completed in early 1114.  The Starflare 
exhibits a number of typical TrinTechnics design features: the asymmetrical 
computer installation, short endurance, and general multi-task design in 
particular.  TrinTechnics designers attempted to wedge as many useful fea-
tures as possible into the Starflare, with the nuclear damper installation 
perhaps being the most unusual in a  vessel of this size.  This was prompted 
by a perceived need to defend against small Vargr vessels with easy access to 
nuclear weapons.  A small troop contingent, a slight surplus capacity in 
accommodations, and provision of cold sleep chambers for prisoners allows a 
Starflare to engage in boarding and capture operations.  As of 1120, no navy 
in the Domain of Deneb had ordered more than a few test examples of the Star-
flare, usually citing the low endurance as the cause of rejection.  However, 
23 of the vessels have been produced for private purchasers.

What do you need to maintain life in space?  Food (cheap), air (cheaper),
water (cheap), power (lots of it on a ship), specialized equipment (already
included in the cost of the ship--extended life support isn\'t real cheap,
plus we pay annual maintenance on it.)

Hortalez et Cie is primarily involved in banking and such things, as is
Zirunkariish to a lesser degree.  That\'s one reason they appear so often
as part owners of large portions of other megacorps.  I\'d suppose that
both they and the Imperial government\'s central banks would be involved
in the exchange of foreign currency -- including reputable foreign debit
card withdrawals.  Anyone with this JTAS able to help me here?

Or Vargr.  Or Aslan.  :)  I\'ve been toying with this adventure idea where a
travelling theater troupe, running out of cash, decides to try it\'s luck
bringing ancient Shakespeare plays into the Extents.  They might have to
be careful which plays they pick on some worlds, but it might go over well....

The way the debit flashes worked in my campaign is that you had an

with the proper amount. If you don\'t want to use debit cards so that
that shipment of guns that you just bought is harder to trace, then
use cash. You can do one of two things in that case. You can have
them go through the exchange rate on world, or you can use Imperial
currency through out the Imperium. I have used both. The former is a
lot more work than the latter.

Otherwise you can always not worry about it. That is the easiest
solution of all. Money just gets transferred to and from accounts and
you never have to worry about how.

I guess this is just another symptom of trade and commerce needing fixed

The physics convention is that potential energy is NEGATIVE, so that it 
increases (gets less negative) as you increase the separation. At 
infinite separation, the PE rises to zero. (A common definition is that 
PE represents how much energy has to be added to bring two objects to

Yes, there is. If a ship\'s total energy ( KE + (-ve) PE ) is greater 
than zero, the ship is not bound by Earth (assuming PE is measured with 
respect to Earth).  The escape velocity is about 11 km/s--any ship 
moving this fast with respect to Earth has enough kinetic energy to 
escape to infinity--ie, it will never return.

Almost certainly. By that distance, the 1/r factor has made PE with 
respect to Earth so small that almost any kinetic energy will tip the
balance.

There are two other very important factors, Sol and Alpha Centauri, 
however.  At those distances, Earth is completely negligible. A fair
approximation is to assume 2 light-years is a sufficient approximation 
to infinity, and call the potential energy zero. The energy required
to make the jump is then 

	(final energy) - (initial energy) = 0 - (-GmM/r) = GmM/r,

where r is the initial separation. On the other hand, if you were to 
jump from a distance r from Sol to a distance r from AC, then the net
cost of the jump is

	G m M(AC)/r - G m M(Sol)/r = G m [M(AC)-M(Sol)]/r.

A first approximation calls M(Sol) about the same as M(AC), so the net
cost of the jump is ~= 0, plus the drive energy to make a jump of twice 
the distance. On the other hand, GmM/r is the escape energy of Sol, 
which is the kinetic energy required to produce a velocity of ~30 km/s.
For a ship weighing say, 1 T, that\'s 4.5e11 J, or 450 000 MJ. Not to
be sneezed at.

You\'re right, and I thought about that after I mailed my last
post.  Of course, that means that if (hopefully when) the GDW
folks decide to make the plant output realistic, they should
subtract the energy needed to create the neutrons from the
energy output of the power plant.  Also, fusion power plants
when first introduced would likely not have this ability, and
would have to use heavy hydrogen as I suggested.  Also, a
plant fusing only heavy hydrogen would have a higher energy
yield than one fusing normal hydrogen (I don\'t know what the
overall difference is -- I don\'t have the numbers handy).

This does not invalidate my suggestions, though.  The p-e pair
combination is simply a way of "donating" neutrons that I said
would be needed to fuse normal hydrogen.  Also, it might NOT
be feasible to duplicate this inside of a power plant.  It
still might be easier to use another means to donate neutrons
to the hydrogen before fusing it.

By the way, where does the electron come from?  I was under the
impression that the Sun, at least the part that is fusing, is
very positively ionic.  If this is so, then where are the
electrons coming from?  Is there another form of mass decay
taking place?  Or is this simply one of the means by which the
Sun regulates its rate of fusion?  Or am I simply misinformed?

2000 cr/jump is the _passenger_ rate, is it not?  The crews\' lifesupport
is already figured in the cost of the ship expenses.  When I was running
a merchant with a crew, I did not charge the crew for passage.  The cost
of the crews\' life support is figured into the cost of the ticket for
a passenger.

The big item contributing to the cost of a passenger ticket is the ship
cost.  Also, I always assumed good fuel being bought and if I was able to
get fuel skimmed off a gas giant or from an ocean, that went into my pocket
as part of the profits.  Also, I had to be able to maintain and depreciate
the purification plant.

It is not so in-expensive as it seems to be able to run a ship.  I\'tt try to
remember to post my balance sheet and calculations used to figure out what
it takes to run a merchant ship.  Let me say this, it was fun.

Good folks,

I  have  read  with  some interest all the  various  comments  from  people
regarding  GDW\'s  proposed moves to redesign Traveller and thought I  would
throw my hat in the ring.

Like  a good many other correspondents to this thread, I first  encountered
Classic  Traveller  in  the early eighties, laying my  hands  on  virtually
everything  that  GDW put out - the "Little Black" Boxed Set, the  reworked
Big Boxed Set with the improved artwork, various Traveller-associated games
(Snapshot,  Mayday  and  Invasion  Earth), a host of  Traveller  Books  and
Supplements, the GDW-produced Adventures and Double Adventures and numerous
copies  of JTAS.  Even Referees Screens and Traveller posters didn\'t escape
my notice. In short, GDW produced it, I mostly bought it.

I  took  part in various adventures - Leviathan, Twilight\'s Peak (IMHO  the
best  there  was)  and various custom adventures to boot.   When  I  wasn\'t
adventuring,  I was using most (not all) of my Traveller gear to design new
worlds,  ships, peoples etc., modifying those rules I didn\'t like, couldn\'t
work with, or thought were "just plain dumb".

So  why  the dedication to the Classic Traveller game and game materials  ?
Am  I  one of those "anally retentive" types that  psychologists  sometimes
speak of, who collect anything from cigarette cards to Faberge eggs ?

No,  not at all.  Classic Traveller was compact, had a rules system  which,
once  understood  in  broad terms, would allow your average user  to  start
playing/designing  fairly  quickly.  I liked the modularity of the  game  :
You  want Mercenaries - buy Book 4.  You don\'t, don\'t.  You need more  info
on  the  Spinward Marches ?  Well, here it is ...  and so on (I  think  Rob
Dean made this point earlier this month).  Even the GDW Adventures were, on
the  whole,  well thought out.  They meshed in with the  already  published
materials  whilst, at the same time, allowing the GM a certain latitude  in
adding new twists to the adventures.

So  why  then didn\'t I move to MegaTraveller or T2K2 or whatever ?   Simply
put,  none  of  it added any value at all to the work I had  put  in  using
Classic  Traveller.  I smelt a marketing rat back then which, to be honest,
I can smell again.

My  belief is that GDW\'s current moves are influenced by little more than a
need  for  quick revenues, and they view a rewrite of the  Traveller  rules
(because,  all said and done, that\'s what it is) as the most expedient  way
to  do this.  IMHO, in this they are mistaken.  GDW could quite easily  put
most of their resources into bringing out some high quality, *well-proofed*
adventures, supplements whatever, in the same format as they used to be.  A
new  JTAS,  new  supporting  materials, more software ...   all  these  are
options  which they should consider.  (I would be interested to know  where
most  of  TSR\'s  revenues  are  derived.   New  players  ?   Supplements  ?
Adventures ? Can someone please shed some light on this ?)

I  also feel (but am willing to be proved wrong) that GDW will have extreme
difficulty  winning  the  hearts, minds and (most importantly to  GDW)  the
wallets of new gamers when there are so many competitive products out there
(Star  Wars,  GURPS etc.).  If they want to compete with these people,  the
materials  should  be just as glitzy, *better proofed* and  easily  played.

The  last  point here is crucial :  I find it hard to believe  that  people
want to read through tomes of rules to resolve game situations ("OK, you\'re
wearing  Cloth  when you\'re suddenly hit by a blast from a FGMP  at  medium
range.   Now  if we could just turn to page 18 ...  or is that 23 ?   Aaah,
but it\'s London and it\'s raining, so for weather effects I think we\'ll turn
to  ..."  and  so on).  You see, there has to be  this  constant  trade-off
between realism and playability - a very fine line to tread, and one which,
up until now, GDW have abjectly failed to negotiate.

My parting shot for all you GDW-type folks reading this :  if MegaTraveller
was an admission that Classic Traveller was wrong, and MegaTraveller is (by
GDW\'s admission) also flawed, what confidence can I have as a mere customer
that  Traveller - The Next Generation, won\'t also be brain-dead ruleswise ?
When  can  I expect the next rules change after that ?  Can GDW  assure  me
that this is the last rules change they will make and that this will really
be IT ?  I await a reply.

Oh,  and  *please*, GDW, don\'t expect me to believe that you have  my  best
interests  at  heart  because you are gamers.  Just because you  do  for  a
living  what  you  do  as a pastime does not  necessarily  instil  me  with
confidence.  A friend of mine is a brain surgeon, but he isn\'t a better one
because he talks brain surgery or lobotomises his cat come the weekend.

BTW,  I  know it sounds like a flame, GDW, but it ain\'t.  More of an  unlit
Molotov Cocktail. Now if you\'d care to bring some matches next time ...

All the best everyone,

Hugh.

again.

First some back ground on me.  I consider myself a wargammer who
does RPG\'s.  Keep this in mind when you flame me.  My latest
traveller campain had the players running a TCL 15 marine
platoon.  I used a lot of Striker rules in the campain.  Anyway
for my problem.  One of the players was something of a munckin
and abused medical slow drug.  To resole that problem I have
written the following set of tasks for the use of medical slow
drug.  I would like your CONSTRUCTIVE criticism of them.  Note: I
used 7+ instead of routine. (or what ever the word is for a roll
of 7+).  Thank you.

Notes:
      Alien Species raise the difficulty one to two levels
(Referee determined).  Hasty attempts raise the difficulty level
by one & the lower the time factor.  Cautious attempts lower the
difficulty level by one and raise the time factor.  A Hasty Slow
Drug Reaction can not be made.  
      A Cautious Slow Drug Reaction can be made.  The time factor
is doubled. The time of the Slow Drug Reaction is uncertain.
      Without a Diagnosis and Preparation skill roll, a Slow Drug
Reaction roll becomes a 11+ roll, and failure automatically
rolled on 3D6.  For each No Truth result on skill rolls add 1D6
to the failure table.  For each  Some Truth add 1/2D6 to the
failure roll.  ie: a No Truth on the Diagnose, Preparation, and
Reaction roll requires a 3d6 roll on the failure table.

As to my own preferences vis a vis this "new Improved" Traveller:
 
1)  Keep the existing character design system with trivial mods.
 
2)  Keep the existing task system.
 
3)  Dump the Starship Design system, and start over with the 2300AD
    system as a basis.
 
4)  Rebuild the world generation system to include the good points from 
    2300AD, specifically the atmosphere rules, and the 
    colony/infrastructure elements.  MT really desperately needs a 
    quickie world infrastructure guideline.
 
5)  Upgrade the power systems to realistic levels.  I have served aboard
    a Nuclear submarine, and the existing fission plant rules are a bad
    joke.  The Fusion rules produce power outputs per liter of hydrogen
    fused which are pathetic.  The anti-matter rules are only off by 
    a factor of a thousand or so, though.
 
6)  Dump that 6G limit.  If you want a 20G battleship, build one.  It 
    would require that 59% of your ship be maneuver drive, and 17% be
    power plant for that maneuver drive, and the remaining 110% would 
    provide fuel for 30 days, but what the hey?  You want it, don\'t 
    put arbitrary restrictions, let the system provide it\'s own 
    restrictions.
 
7)  And how about an economic system that works this time????

They sure would.  Unfortunately, lack of credit or items salable offworld
would leave them able to buy just about nothing.  Notice that there are 
several worlds in the Spinward Marches (Nakege/Jewell/Spinward Marches 
for instance) that produce no goods salable anywhere within a dozen 
parsecs.  Since it wants to buy anything brought in, it must do so with 
Imperial Credits.  Where do they come from?  In the real world, you get 
foreign currency by selling things to the foreigners, but Nakege has 
nothing anyone wants to buy.  It\'s a mystery to me!  Government subsidies?
Not likely, the Imperial government is too Laissez faire to do that.   
Magic??  Probably.  The GDW people don\'t seem to be capable of adding, 
much less doing economic (or any other) analysis of their system.

Probably they do, on major worlds, anyway.  See Andre Norton\'s Free 
Trader stories.
As to the Cosmic Computer analogy, consider that the average merchant 
ship  being dealt with in those stories was about 9,000,000 MT tons.
There was a ship (approx. 1,000,000 MT tons) described as too small to 
make it worthwhile to put FTL drives into.  So the average ship like that 
could buy up the entire wine harvest, store it in one corner of Hold #10, 
and then finish loading later.  The economic parallels between Piper\'s 
works and MT are virtually nonexistant

Interestingly enough, trade restricting legislation seems to be a 
crucial part of many published adventures, most GM\'s arsenals, etc.
HOWEVER, any such trade would pretty much violate Imperial Law on 
interstellar trade (there are supposed to be no restrictions on such).
Odd, isn\'t it?

Hmmm.   One Tukera Long-Liner per day landing at Efate.  So we are 
talking about 90 passengers arriving at a world of 6,000,000,000 
or so per day.  Atlanta has several hundred arriving flights per 
day, at 300+ passengers per flight.  Atlanta also has a population 
of 2,000,000 or so.  Trying to match traffic patterns would result 
in about 10,000 Tukera Liners per day arriving at Efate.    
Because of the high cost (similar to Cruise Ships, as opposed to 
airplanes), divide that by 20.  That would leave about 500 Tukera 
Liners per day at Efate.  One per 3 minutes.
It would also result in about one per 20 seconds at Terra or Muan 
Gwi.
Note that travel by starship parallels travel by merchant ship 
early in this century, rather than air travel.  Note also that when
using the city/planet analogy to compare the real world to MT, you 
should include air transport, water transport, rail transport, and
highway traffic to get a good picture of amount of trade between 
cities/planets.  The analogy is really pretty poor, anyway, so try 
using the country/planet analogy.  You still have to consider ALL
cross-border traffic, but the picture is probably more realistic.
 
 
To Rob Dean:
 
>system.  Along those lines, let me ask if anyone else thinks that Cr2000
per
>person per jump seems to be a bit excessive as a life support cost.  In my
 
The life support costs are a joke.  Everything, except possibly airline 
food, should be covered by the life support systems you pay for when
you buy the ship.
 
In response to the discussion of Potential energy in MT, the maximum 
potential energy relative to anything is equal to the energy of escape
velocity from the thing.  Therefore, the potential energy relative to 
the Sun when halfway to AlphaCent is slightly less than KE of escape
velocity from the Sun (which is about 1.905 E 11 Joules per Kilogram)
Note that the PE with respect to the Sun of someone on Terra is about
- -1.887 E 11 Joules per Kg.  The actual PE needed to get anywhere
relative to the Sun from Terra is only 886,000,000 Joules per Kg.

   I\'ve been reviewing my letter file from Roger Myhre. Following is my
summary of his wish list for starship combat. (I\'ve left out some specifics.)

OVERALL COMMENTS
    Lack of tactics is biggest issue with Traveller combat. Ship velocity and
heading have no bearing on what you may fire at. Armor is basically unitary;
it does not matter which facing was hit.

SCALE
    Smaller time scale for time and movement. He suggests 1 minute turns and
15 km per square/grid.

EASIER DAMAGE SYSTEM
    Easy-to-use, generic damage record form for all types of craft. If it\'s
impractical to use one form, then as few variations as possible, and they
should be obviously different. (Try finding destroyer #3 in a stack of
Leviathan ship forms.)

    Faster task resolution for hit and penetration. Compare offensive to
defensive factors and roll D100. (Adding a +11DM on a dozen weapon factors
seems bad.)
    One table to roll hits.
    Special tables for spinal mounts rather than rolling umpteen times.
Perhaps compare weapon factor to ship size: results would be ship-kill,
cripple, or damage. Cripple or damage would involve one die roll, and give
guidelines for allocating damage.
    Regard internal hits as criticals, where internal hits are nasty no matter
what weapon type inflicted the damage.

    Use a damage point based system, the same as personal combat does. Compute
damage factor for a ship\'s battery from the damage and penetration factors
given in Player\'s Manual so that entire system is consistent.


ANOTHER TWO CENTS FROM ME, (Clay Bush, not Roger Myhre)

    Someone in recent discussion noted that Aliens were getting dropped during
each revision of Traveller. MT made obsolete the Alien Modules, and now a
T:2000 conversion will invalidate important parts of the two MTA books.
    Aliens are very important to any si-fi game, and deserve careful attention
in GDW\'s marketing plans.
    I feel that the best way to handle the major non-human races is to
consolidate character generation for them into one big, bound book. Feature
character generation and role-playing aspects; cut back on history and
physiology as needed to make them fit.
    While one big rule book may be a bad idea, I feel that one _comprehensive_
treatment of the major alien races is workable. Most everyone who bought MTA1
is buying MTA2: the common interest is there. Also, this is supplementary
material.
    The one big rule book is a problem, because then you have character
generation, animal encounters, starship design, etc., all in one place, and
readers have to page through it to find anything during play. With aliens, you
aren\'t trying to find different sections during play.
    A release after the revised rules come out (and early comments on the
rules in) would provide important, general background for developing
campaigns. After MT, how many referees sidestepped Aslan waiting for the MTA?
I think quite a few judging from the number of HIWGers who put off projects
waiting for MTA1 or MTA2.
    Drop the "bomb" and then referees will feel free to run with the ball. Any
lack of written adventures in the product is made up in the number of referee-
generated adventures it supports.

    (Personally, I blame Americans\' obsession with not making mistakes.
Perfectionism and fear of mistakes cripples many people\'s initiative, but
encouragement to "wing it" doesn\'t help many. It\'s too close to the problem.
    (Since supplements are meant to support, the ones of most use to referees
should receive the highest priority. Aliens is the first place to look at
supplements in any si-fi system.)

   While I doubt that this will make much difference, I\'d  like to point out
that the MT/2300 task system works  perfectly well with the T2K2 skill levels -
it\'s been used  in the local Twilight campaign ever since the new edition  was
released. (And note to Lester - an automatic success  rule could be added,
though I personally don\'t feel it to be needed, since it only comes up on
Formidable or Impossible  tasks. I won\'t insult your intelligence by pointing
out that the 2300 version uses a d10, so bell curves are not  necessary ;->).
Actually, I think it works much better than  the "real" T2K2 task system, and
intend to do this unless drastic revisions are made.

   I agree with Clay that a _NeoTraveller Alien_ book would  be a good idea,
and somerules for generating alien characters (for everyone with the old
background) should be  in the basic book. 

   While I\'m here, I\'d like to point out once again that interstellar anarchy
(Twilight: 2000 with spaceships) is of  absolutely no interest to me. I don\'t
know yet if that\'s  what GDW is aiming for, but it certainly sounds like it so
 far. My campaigns require interstellar goverments  (preferably large ones,
who don\'t always get along but are  not at war) to be playable, since they are
based on  intrigue, with very little violence.

   In Traveller, it\'s hard to do that without organization  on an interstellar
scale, because the characters are less  likely to get involved in local
intrigues and find it too  easy to escape their enemies. If the factions
around Lucan\'s Imperium remained intact, I\'ll find it a lot easier to  accept
the revised universe. (Frankly, my main concern with  the rules change is how
much stuff I have to throw out. It\'s  the setting that makes or breaks a game
for me).

   I generally agree with Bryan Borich\'s "five points",  though I don\'t really
expect to see 1 or 5.

   Foreshadowing Dept. (TNS, Challenge #47): "An anonymous  source close to
Emperor Lucan said that the recent `super- weapons speech\' does relate to
these naval successes. `The emperor would not have put his technical staff on
the spot unless he knew that real breakthroughs were being made. What our
scientists have accomplished is, in a word, startling.  The emperor expects a
complete cessation of hostilities as  soon as his ultimatum is delivered to
the leaders of the  various rebel factions\'." Hmmm...

One other small matter that I hope will be addressed by the new character
generation system in TNE: multiple career changes as a legal part of the
rules. The average person in our society changes careers over twenty
times in his or her life; in Traveller you\'re not allowed to do it at all,
unless you\'re a Vargr. You\'re a Navy man when you\'re 18, and the only way
you can try something different when you\'re 26 is to muster out and 
become an adventurer, with a big set of gaps in your skill lists as compared
to the 42-year-olds out there. My personal bias would be to state that a
person can only serve in one MILITARY establishment in their career, and
would then need to move to paramilitary or civilian organizations. This
would lead to careers like the following:

"Well, I was a bomber pilot in the War-- got a bunch of decorations. Then
I decided to give civilian life a try, so I used my piloting experience
to hire on as a commercial pilot hauling passengers and cargo. After some
years of that, it got kind of old, so I decided to give writing a try.
And now I make a living doing writing and mass media production, with my
skill base as a means of qualifying me as a technical consultant."

Sound like the typical sort of random hashing around that you\'d expect 
from an easily-bored Vargr? Well, surprise surprise: as anyone who
wears plastic ears to conventions could tell you, that was Gene Roddenberry\'s
resume at any point in the last two decades of his life. Think about it.

I believe the escape velocity is the velocity you need to have initially,
so that gravitational deceleration will not prevent you from getting to
an infinite distance, where the gravitational force of the Earth upon
your ship will be zero.  Of course, other factors will probably prevent you
getting to an infinite distance from Earth in reality.

Well, it will have to expend some energy in order to make up for the
potential energy it will gain due to its increased distance from Sol.
But it will get some of that back because it loses some potential energy
due to the reduced distance from Alpha Centauri.  There\'s also the matter
of what the ship\'s potential energy due to its distance from Regina will
do.

This messes up the trick of a ship with a jump-1 drive but enough fuel for
two jumps, which executes one jump-1 into empty space and then a second
jump-1 to the destination, thus making a 2 parsec journey possible.

Yes, but the snag is that a ship capable of Manoeuvre-3 under the old
system will either no longer be capable of it (because the drives are
now bigger), or be capable of it but now have some new cargo space
(because the drives are now smaller).

I wonder if they will use the same sort of trick they did when they
introduced High Guard, whose calculations for drive size and fuel
consumption were different from those in Book 2 - the old drives are
standardised models, suitable for use on small ships if it is an
advantage to do so.

No, but you may have to give up your repulsor bay because the new
rules say it uses more power than the old rules, and your ship can\'t
provide the required power.

Ah, this makes things a little easier.  In effect, if you are a long way
from something, your potential energy due to its gravity is approximately
zero; if you\'re sitting on top of it, your potential energy is large and
negative - you have to expend a lot of energy to get away.  If you\'re at
distance 0, you\'re in big trouble, but that\'s really only possible if the
something that you\'re trying to get away from has radius 0, i.e. it is
probably a black hole.

Why twice the distance?  (I assume that in this sentence, "distance" means
"distance from Sol to Alpha Centauri".)  If the energy require to make a
jump of this distance is E, then you\'re saying you need to expend 2*E.

A ship accelerating at 1-G will achieve that velocity in less than an hour,
using just its manoeuvre drive.  (To get to 30000 m/s using an acceleration
of 9.8 m/s^2 will take 3061 seconds, i.e. 51 minutes.)  Maybe not to be
sneezed at, but that\'s the sort of figure that all spacecraft play with
routinely - that\'s why you don\'t want to collide with anything!

So the ship expends its 4.5e11 J, and get into jump space.  One week later,
it emerges from jump space near Alpha Centauri, and gets 4.5e11J back -
what happens to this energy?  Presumably it gains this energy as it emerges
from jump space, and the energy ends up back in the ship\'s jump capacitors.

Rob,
  What I ment was that based on the trade and commerce rules and the cost of a
ship vs the available cargo/passenger space, you cant build a usable ship.

Look at the Vehicals in the MT Imperial Encyolpedia:

Air/Raft:     TL 15
GCarrier:     TL 15
Speeder:      TL 15
All Ship\'s Boats: TL 15
All Star Ship\'s:  TL 15  (Including a Type S scout and a Type A free trader)

If it requires TL 15 to build a Free Trader to have that little passenger space
and cargo space, there is no way to afford the payments if it is built at a
lower TL.  Try building a Free Trader at TL 12.

The only space vehicals below TL 15 in the IG are the Gazelle Close Escort and
its attached gig.  They are TL 14.

Can\'t agree with you more. Especially the last sentence. Therefore,
has anyone seen a commercial game/publication that has a decent
economic system?

Two things jump at me here. In the Trav/MegaTrav universe either the 
ships are too small or the planets don\'t produce as much as in Piper\'s
books. I would assume that planetary production is relatively similar
in both universes therefore it leaves ship size. Why aren\'t there big
freighter\'s in Trav/MTrav? It would seem to be a very economical way
to ship goods. As it stands now, speed wouldn\'t be affected much because
most ships travel at jump 1 or 2 anyway. Or it could be that since GDW
doesn\'t understand economics planets don\'t produce much therefore small
ships are adequate.

As another point. To me there is no way any ship no matter how big
(as in 9,000,000 MT tons) could store the harvest of a planet. Unless
that planet had only a small colony of a few thousand people or so.
The harvest would be so large that it would take several ships of that
size to move it. Of course that is assuming that a significant portion
of the harvest is for export. Otherwise you wouldn\'t get anyone to come
if the harvest isn\'t going to make them a profit.

I\'m not sure how you managed to build that up to 500 per day when I
already stated that 1 per day per major line would be appropriate.
Granted that is probably too small but that was referring to Rob Dean\'s
original question on trying to get a handle on traffic.

I obviously didn\'t put enough qualifiers in my original statement.
Of course in order to get a more realistic picture all forms of
transport need to be included. I was using airports to illustrate
the size of the companies and the aircraft  involved not what they 
carried. I don\'t know of anyone that ships bulk goods by air! So that
would be a pretty poor example.

I agree that sea travel is the best form of transportation to use when
making comparisons or using as a model. It includes most of the 
necessary components used when making calculations; time, life support,
cargo types, etc.

Although I admittedly don\'t have the numbers in front of me
either, as I recall the energy required to create a neutron is
pretty negligible compared to the energy gained in 4P + 4e ->
He4 .  Be careful not to confuse the mass defect, which
represents the total energy gain of a nuclear reaction, with
the barrier potential, which represents how difficult it is to
start a fusion reaction (sort of).  The latter number really has
little to do with the former, and the former number is the
interesting one for power output.

My guess based on current results is that heavy hydrogen fusion
for power production is TL9.  I would guess at least TL10 and
probably TL11 for light hydrogen fusion.

Practically can\'t be!  Remember the huge difference between the
universal electric constant C (per particle charge) and the
universal gravitational constant G (per particle mass)...  What
this means is that any object which is even slightly charge
unbalanced is blown apart by the repulsive force of its own
electric charge!

Perhaps that is one answer -- require all ships entering jumpspace to
have enough kinetic energy (speed) to escape from the local star\'s
gravity well.  Then, a ship jumping from Sol to empty space would end
up with (almost) no kinetic energy after the jump, then after jumping
to Alpha Centauri it would gain as much kinetic energy as potential
energy that it lost.

Of course, there will have to be extra energy expended for the jump
itself.  Probably that energy would be expended as lost heat energy
or something.

As I mentioned, the energy could just as easily be transferred into
kinetic energy.  Or it could go into the jump capacitors.  As long
as you aren\'t getting free energy from the jump, I don\'t mind how
it is modelled.

When I played Traveller regularly, the GM that I played with used an
old White Dwarf article that allowed a character to change careers.
As you got older and depending on your last career choice your
choices got less and less. 

This has lead me to have characters that spent times as a Bounty
Hunter and a Rogue, some folks may say that is the same thing. 

The system used your age and then gave you choices to make and
the rolls required for entry. There were die modifiers depending on
your previous experience. Some things were automatic. If you had a
social standing of >10 you could always join the Nobles. Rogues was
also always a possiblity, you can always turn to a life of crime. :-)
My GM used Other as skills that you learned in prison life, when
being a Rogue was not entirely successful. The number of terms
determined by your sentence. Isn\'t that what reabilitation is about?

:unless you\'re a Vargr. You\'re a Navy man when you\'re 18, and the only way
:you can try something different when you\'re 26 is to muster out and 
:become an adventurer, with a big set of gaps in your skill lists as compared
:to the 42-year-olds out there. My personal bias would be to state that a
:person can only serve in one MILITARY establishment in their career, and

I disagree slightly. It is possible today to leave say the Air Force
and then enlist in the Army. It is unusual, but not unheard of. 

:would then need to move to paramilitary or civilian organizations. This
:would lead to careers like the following:
:
:"Well, I was a bomber pilot in the War-- got a bunch of decorations. Then
:I decided to give civilian life a try, so I used my piloting experience
:to hire on as a commercial pilot hauling passengers and cargo. After some
:years of that, it got kind of old, so I decided to give writing a try.
:And now I make a living doing writing and mass media production, with my
:skill base as a means of qualifying me as a technical consultant."

:

Well let\'s see, I went to college for Music Education. Dropped out
after realizing that I didn\'t want to teach. Then attended and
graduated Piano Tuning and Repair School. Was self-employed for 5
years. Got married and found out that Piano Tuning would not pay the
bills alone. Got a part-time job as a School Bus Driver, and tuned
pianos. Then landed a job as a Housekeeper, (read Janitor) at the
local VA. Then quit that job to enter Customer Support at a computer
company. After two years in Customer Support, I got a job in the
Product Assurance Dept. So here I am. Seems reasonable to me. I am
teaching myself how to program in C. So maybe my next step will be as
a programmer somewhere.

OK, so maybe it will be impossible to design the 1000 ton merchant
ship that you are carrying over from MT.  But you COULD put the
same equipment on board a 2000 ton ship now.  Big deal.  When you
do the conversion, change the ship tonnage.  Some of us don\'t use
ship\'s statistics in normal play.  Also, if it is difficult to
build large ships with high maneuver ratings under the new rules,
then I would just drop the maneuver rating a notch or so.  I\'m
sure that I\'d eventually get around to changing the ships to the
new rules.  I just don\'t want the new rules to replace jump drives
with warp drives and missiles with photon torpedoes or other such
drastic changes which would make conversion impossible.

A funny thought.  On my X-windows display, the configured icon image for
my shell windows is an Imperial starburst, not a shattered sun ala

  Don\'t forget that there are *two* decay routes which can change a proton
into a neutron: beta absorption (proton plus electron -> neutron plus
neutrino) and inverse-beta decay (proton -> neutron plus positron plus
neutrino); I believe the latter is much more common, because the proton is
not at all dependent on "finding" an appropriate electron which allows the
decay. Also, being a nuclear physicist, I should point out that a free
proton will not decay to a neutron in any case (not energetically favor-
able). However, in a nucleus containing a large number of protons (relative
to the number of neutrons) *will* undergo such a decay.
  So, look at a collapsing interstellar gas cloud composed entirely of
hydrogen-1. As it collapses, grav potential energy becomes kinetic energy--
the gas heats up. Eventually, the gas reaches a temperature (or energy)
high enough to let the protons (which make up the hydrogen-1 nuclei)
overcome their electrostatic repulsion. Somewhere in the cloud, two
protons come close enough to experience the strong nuclear force. This is not
sufficient, however; the di-proton is energetically unfavorable and will soon
fall apart. But, before they fall apart, it is possible for the weak nuclear
force to cause an inverse-beta dacey of one of the protons--bingo! We have a
deuteron. At this point things get more complex, but we see the basic 
procedure:

  p + p + 0.5 MeV  -->  He-2*  -->  d
   \\ /      |             |         |
    |       |             |         +--> deuteron
    |       |             +----> excited di-proton (unstable)
    |       +----> coulomb barrier (rough calc.)
    +----> two hydrogen nuclei (protons)
 
  The number 0.5 MeV may be dead wrong; I used a guess based on about
thirty seconds worth of thought.

You realise what you just said?  A spacecraft with a 1-G maneuver drive

Constant-acceleration drives are scary.

Depending on how jumpspace is supposed to work, I shouldn\'t think the 
hundred billion joules of GPE would have to be \'spent\'.  The only 
relevent number ought to be the difference in initial and final 
energies.  If the energy did have to come from somewhere, it would be
a very blatant violation of the 2nd law of Thermodynamics to get it back 
in the capacitors. More plausible would be to get it as kinetic energy,
but physical reality would almost certainly produce it as heat. Which
would vapourise the ship, very quickly.

Jerry Williams Notes:
[]It\'s been a while, but I once used this equation to

Perhaps T:TNE should draw upon the Niven "Known Space/Kzin Wars" idea of
ships.

In "Man/Kzin Wars" (post hyperdrive) Ships are equipped with a contra-gravity
drive as well as the hyperdrive.  Ships have a maneuver reserve in
deltaV (i.e. in the thrid book, one character noted that Kzin standard warships
have a 1.5c DeltaV reserve for maneuvering.

However, no fuel use was mentioned for this reserve (but I presume it was
something low).

===============================================================================
When I recently ran Traveller, I modified my system generation program to
figure Tech Levels differently.  My system assumed a "General TL" and
worked down based on Starport.  For the Imperium, GTL was 15, 16 in the core,
the Zhodani had a GTL of 14, Sword Worlds has 12, etc.

A Starports reduced GTL by 1d2-1 (i.e. 0-1), B-starports reduce it by 1d3-1
(0-2), C ports by 1d4 (1-4), D by 1d4+1 (2-5) and  E by 1d6+2 (3-8). X ports
were a special case. (straight 1d6-1 or soemthing).

In the case of fringe areas (spinward marches, etc) the variance was increased
by 1 (thus, in the marches, a B-starport rolls 1d4-1, not 1d3-1).  In the
core variance is reduced by 1 (in the capital sector, B-starports roll 1d2-1).

Tight collectives (Darrian, Sword Worlds) reduce variance by 1 as well.
Very tight collectives (small, 5-world federations) reduce variance by 2
(never below 1d2).

Within the imperium and Vargr areas, roll 2d6: a 12 indicates +1 TL.

This system gets a littl sticky when rolling random systems outside any normal
collective body, but I think it handles the idea of technology following the
heavy-traffic planets better.

I started to work on one a few years ago, but put it aside as too big a job.
I did analyse the trade tonnage in a couple of subsectors and got unmanagably
huge numbers. Glisten subsector (not one of the high-population ones at all)
wound up with 44.000 ships of an average tonnage of a 1000. I based this on
the naval budgets of Trillion Credit Squadron as showing a bare minimum. (I
assumed that in order to pay the few planets who actually built these ships,
the rest of the planets had to deliver goods to other planets (Glisten will
hardly be satisfied with an IOU for umpteen billion akian guilders unless
they can buy something for those guilders AND have it delivered)). The one BIG
assumption I made was that every ton of military ship "represented" two tons
of commercial ship (I got that number out of a fantasy RPG. Does anybody know
what the numbers are for real-life nations? That is, what is the proportions
between America or Britain\' or France\'s naval and trade fleet?)

The fix I came up with consisted of dividing trade ships in two categories:
bulk and luxury. Bulk carriers are huge ships ranging from 10.000 T for the
very smallest to 1-200.000 T on the average to millions of tons for the
largest. They are engaged in long-term haulage of food and rew materials
between the worlds. They have regular routes that don\'t change from one year
to another (You don\'t build a super- or hyper-carrier unless you have a
guaranteed employment for it for the next several decades). Luxury trade is
evrything else. Everything we\'ve seen in any Traveller and Megatraveller
publication to date, up to and including the 5000 T Akerut freighters from
"The Traveller Adventure".

Bulk trade is boring (which is why we\'ve never heard of it before :-). It is
also 99.9% of all trade. I originally choose 99% as the number and then
checked with the trade of Aramis subsector. In "The Traveller Adventure" we
get a considerable amount of information about the companies trading there. I
made a few interpolations and a couple of rather big (but not unreasonable)
assumptions and came up with a number that was almost exactly the one I got by
calculation, except it was off by a factor 10. So 99.9% is what I use now.

Yes, if you use them all the time. Imagine the capital loss (I think that\'s
what I mean) of a 1.000.000 T ship standing idle. That\'s why I feel justified
in making bulk trade tightly bound to loooong-term employment.

Another advantage of long-term haulage is that you know in advance what size
jump you\'re going to need. Whereas I consider Free Traders with jump-1 quite
silly. (The ability to bypass an unprofitable or even dangerous star-system
is IMO indispensable for a roving trader. Forget about trading mains. A planet
that dosen\'t buy or sell anything is a barrier to jump-1 ships in itself.)

It was amazing the way naval ship sizes changed when GDW produced Trillion
Credit Squadron. In "Twilight\'s Peak" the squadron that enforces the Algine
interdict consists of a Kinunir class "cruiser" and a couple of Gazelle
class escorts. In "Fighting Ships" the squadron that enforces the interdict
of Andory consists of two Tigress class battleships! Not to mention the way
a Kinunir before TCS was a mighty 1200 T cruiser and afterwards was a puny
1200 T "cruiser". Nowadays cruisers are spinal-mount carrying ships of between
20 and 75.000 T and are produced by the hundreds, but back then a Kinunir was
a ship to be reckoned with and had been produced by the dozen. It is a pity
that GDW didn\'t stop for a moment and think about the consequences of
upscaling the naval ships.

I wonder how the 400 T corsairs make out nowadays. They used to be a threat,
at least in the 1000 year old authentic frontier sector Spinward Marches. It
sure is lucky for us referees that the Imperium never decided to build just
one less battleship and place a squadron of Gazelles in every star system,
empty or not, thus ending piracy forever...

BTW. I\'ve also decided to reduce the naval budget of high-population worlds.
I haven\'t worked out the details, but the main idea is to introduce an
_optimum_ population for each star-system. Once you exceed that, the extra
people won\'t generate extra naval revenue (that is, any increase in
productivity from having more people producing is swallowed up in having
still more people not producing, but still requiring support). After all,
the proportion of telephone sanitizers and bureaucrats are higher in a
society of millions than a society of thousands. So a system with an optimum
population of 1.2 billion and an actual population of 4 billion would have
it\'s naval budget based on 1.2 billion and not 4. Of course, a sliding scale
would be better, perhaps even one that resulted in a _lower_ revenue the more
the population were above the optimum, but that would be more complicated than
I care for.

How to determine the optimum population? That\'s the bit I haven\'t had the
time to work out yet. Something based on the physical characteristics of the
system\'s main world, plus a random roll of 2D* 100 million to reflect the
value of the rest of the system (the last factor only for sufficiently
high-tech societies, of course). Come to think of it, tech level would
come into the first part too, wouldn\'t it?

I agree. I have a half-finished article with rules for career changes lying
around somewhere. My character for the PBM game spent a term in the army
before beginning his main career. The (NPC) doctor in my naval campaign is
an ex-doctor merchant purser who joined the navy during the 5th Frontier
war and stayed.

One of the rules I have is that you can\'t join the law enforcers if you\'ve
had a dishonorable discarge (I use a missed survival roll as an involuntary
career end and a missed reenlistmint roll as a voluntary one). On the other
hand, ex-military with good papers recieve a bonus on the law enforcer
enlistment roll.

Of course, things don\'t balance out quite so neatly when the destination
star has more or less mass than the departure star.  Maybe part of the jump
calculation involves arranging that you exit jump space at a distance such
that the escape velocity from the destination star at that distance, is equal
to the escape velocity from the departure star at the distance at which you
entered jump space.  Using distance from the star to balance out the different
mass of the star ensures that the escape energy at each end is about the same,
and the jump drive doesn\'t get overloaded trying to compensate for the
different energies.

The jump drive would then convert the ship\'s kinetic energy into jump energy,
and back again when the ship exits jump space.  Kinetic energy would probably
be meaningless or totally different in jump space.

That\'s accounted for by the huge amount of fuel which has to be burned by the
jump drive.

And now you know why you have to be at least 10 diameters away from the
planet before you jump, preferably 100 diameters.  (And probably some
significant distance away from the star, too.)  If you\'re too close to
a gravity source, the jump capacitors or jump drive get overloaded.  Boom.

And now for something completely different:

            SUGGESTIONS FOR DISCOMFORT RATINGS IN MEGATRAVELLER, or
                Putting Some Teeth in the Accommodations Rules

     The MegaTraveller design sequence rules have always been full of  flaws, 
holes,  and  inconsistencies, which GDW has regrettably not yet  made  right.  
The level of detail of various sections is incongruous, with \'agility genera-
tors\'  of zero mass and volume (but using hundreds or thousands of  megawatts 
of power nevertheless) side by side with communicators smaller than your fist 
whose volume we are supposed to track in a ship the size of an office  build-
ing.  Enough of that.

     MegaTraveller  introduced  the use of seats of varying sizes  (from  \'no 
access\'  to \'roomy\') for the crew and passengers of small vehicles, but  gave 
no rules for their use.  What difference can it possibly make, do I hear  you 
ask?  Well, as someone who does not like to be stuffed into a subcompact  car  
(\'cramped\'  seats)  for  eight hours at a stretch, I have come  up  with  the 
following  rules  suggestion.  Like most suggestions, this is  not  something 
that  I would keep track of on a regular basis, but rather something  that  I 
would use when the players seemed to be abusing the system (or abusing  their 
characters!)

     I  would suggest that a task roll be made occasionally, with the  timing 
to  depend on the type of accommodation, to avoid discomfort.  The effect  of 
discomfort would be to reduce all applicable skills by one per failed discom-
fort  roll,  with a maximum reduction to an effective skill  of  zero.   This 
represents  fatigue.  Try checking for \'seats\' once per hour,  for  \'extended 
occupancy seats\' once every four hours, and long term accommodations daily.

     To avoid discomfort, <difficulty>, Determination, <time> (absolute)

Difficulties would be:

                    No Access seat, or Bunk: Formidable
    Cramped or Open Seat or Small Stateroom: Difficult
Adequate seat or Double Occupancy Stateroom: Routine
   Roomy seat or Single Occupancy Stateroom: Simple

Thus, a space fighter pilot on a six day patrol mission in a craft with small 
craft staterooms would roll a difficult task once per day to avoid discomfort 
related  to the length of his patrol.  The driver of a small ground car  with 
cramped seats would roll once per hour for a difficult task, and will  proba-
bly  be driving at less than his maximum efficiency as he approaches the  end 
of a ten hour trip.

The effects of discomfort would be ended when the affected character has time 
enough  to  rest in a \'larger environment\', let\'s say for at least  half  the 
time  increment of the seat type.  Thus, a driver could remove the effect  of 
one level of discomfort by spending a half and hour at a rest stop along  the 
highway.  I have to think about this section a bit more, but it\'s a start.

Judicious  application  of this rule should encourage players  to  spend  the 
extra  money on larger vehicles with spacious accommodations, which helps  to 
give that realistic feel to the game.

Sword Worlds Wagner class Close Escort TL12

     The Wagner class close escort is in service with the the Sacnoth Navy 
(in the Sword Worlds Confederation).  A few of the ships have been sold to 
Sword Worlds space mercenary units as privateers, but the Wagner is not 
popular in this service due to the limited cargo and accommodation space, 
which makes carrying loot, prisoners, and prize crews difficult.  Like all 
miliatary starships at this tech level, the Wagner is handicapped by the 
large fusion plant necessary for high performance.  In the trade-off determi-
nation, the design team of the Wagner elected to retain a high endurance at 
the expense of cargo space, accommodations, and fast fuel processing.  This 
is a reasonable decision for military use, but did limit the sales to private 
concerns anticipated by the navy as a source of extra revenue.  Similar 
vessels can be found in the Vargr Extents , and among the lower tech worlds 
of the Imperium.

In fact, all of these costs _are_ already included in the system.  (Well, OK,
bribes would have to implemented by the GM, but that\'s no big deal.)  My
objection is to paying Cr2000 per occupied stateroom, _just for the life
support costs_, according to the rules.  A little extrapolation at those sorts
of rates would probably be interesting when applied to something like a current
SSBN, which may remain cruising submerged for a couple of months.

Actually, according to the rules (and this goes back to classic Trav), you
are incorrect.  It\'s Cr2000 per occupied stateroom regardless of whether its
occupied by crew or passenger, and Cr4000 to stuff two people into a state-
room on a double occupancy basis.  See page 89, right column, Imperial
Encyclopedia.  Oddly enough, the MT rules are less restrictive.  In Classic
Traveller, you payed per stateroom, regardless of whether or not it was
occupied.

That was kind of what I was thinking.  If you think of stars and planets
as "gravity wells", then you would jump to a point with the same "depth"
as the other "well".  The 100-diameter rule would be to keep you clear of
planets and stars, no matter what their relative densities are.  I\'m sure
you can still imagine jumping from an near a small star into the inside
of a red giant since the gravity is the same (has anyone read A Mote in
God\'s Eye?  Hope that black globe is working 8-).  The biggest worry I\'d
have is being too close to the planet, and jumping out closer to the star
than I expected since the "gravity well" is the same depth there.

I like the idea of requiring that you be at escape velocity first, since
that means your ship is at "zero energy" overall.

Note, if you don\'t allow direct and immediate conversion of kinetic to
potential energy upon leaving jump space, then it would be impossible to
jump to a point of higher potential energy (further from the star), since
that would require you to add potential energy to the ship.  Also, if you
tried to jump to a point nearer to the star, there would be a great deal
of excess energy, which nature often expresses as heat.  Can you say BOOM?
And a vacuum is a great insulator!

(If you don\'t want Niven-style jump drives, then you still must account
for the extra energy.  In this case, simply start with enough kinetic
energy to reach escape velocity and end at near rest when well away from
any start, allowing kinetic energy to be converted to potential energy
by the jump.  Similarly, add kinetic energy when you jump towards a
star.  If you jump from deep space towards a large star, you\'d end up
hurdling towards the star when you arrived -- don\'t arrive too close!
Of course if you use this, there is the problem of momentum -- are you
allowing ships to store up momentum in different directions?).

Now, where does this energy go?  If it goes into the mysterious "jump
space", then jump drives are slowly leaking energy out of our universe.
I think more likely it would be radiated into space as heat.  Of course,
that heat had better be left behind, not brought with you (Have you ever
watched a ship enter jump space?  Well, the ship looks like it\'s
stretching for a split second as the jump drive activates, followed by
a great white flash when the ship disappears.  No doubt boldly going
"where no one has gone before". 8-)

        This is an intro post from the (dare I say it?) newest member
of TML.  James suggested it.

        After about three years of virtually loosing Net access since
I graduated State University of New York at Oswego and comming to
State University of New York College of Agriculture and Technology at
Morrisville (ever try to write something like that on the little
"employer" lines they give you on forms?) we here at Morrisville have
finally started connecting ourselves to the world.  Now, with our
kids on Xmas break I\'ve had time to do a little exploring and found
the TML.

        I\'ve been "involved" with Traveller since 1980 when I found
the Classic Traveller books.  Previous to this my role playing
experience was dedicated to D&D.  I took to the rules, seeing them as
flexible enough for nearly any scenario save, perhaps, Star Trek.
While GDW had a backround for the game, (the Imperium, of course) the
rules didn\'t require its use which was another plus to a poor PRE-
college student (Gods, has it been THAT long?!).  If I could make
something myself instead of buying it, I would.  So, I started heavily
using the Steller System Generation rules to create my own Universe.

        Upon comming to College I found one person ((!)  For some reason
I\'ve not found Traveller to be as popular as I think it should be.  I
mentioned to James that I might be hanging around the wrong crowd) who
liked to play.  Allison had worked out some extensive characters and plots
set against the Imperium backdrop.  We infrequently played for two years
using this backdrop until she left college.

        In 1985 that was the end of Traveller for me, except for the
work I continued to do with my Universe, the Terran Empire.  This was
broken for 2 months in 1990 when I ran a short Classic Traveller
campaign with 5 kids from the College I now work for.  It was short lived
but fun.

        Allison and I continued to keep in close contact over the years.
This last Thanksgiving I had to go to Long Island for a wedding and I
stayed with her, especially when she said that her gaming group was
starting a Traveller campaign and if I could make it down by such&such a
time I could play.  I did make it down and I did play.  Alas, it was only
to be for one session since I live in Central New York.

        Allison suggested continuing the game with me playing by email.
Reluctantly I agreed since I feel that email is a very poor medium for
role playing.  Also, during the game I was able to get my first serious
look at the MegaTraveller rules and found out the vast changes that had
occured in the game system in my absence.  As the email campaign started,
on a larc I went and bought a MegaTraveller set that I\'ve been going over
for the past couple weeks.

        While it seems that GDW has make the Imperium backdrop slightly
more intrigal to the rules, they still have that hallmark of flexibility
that I remember so well.  Between the email campaign and this list I\'m
hoping for a "rebirth" of my Traveller involvement.
=================================================================

        In going through even the first nights digest I\'ve come across
some questions that I hope the group will take time to answer.

1.      What is the current status of Digest Group Publications?  From
various rumors I\'ve heard they have either gone under or were cutting
back on their Traveller material development.

2.      Does anyone know what GDW\'s and/or DGP Traveller line will be
for 1992?

3.      I also came across some acronyms that weren\'t familiar to me.
I assume T:2000 was Traveller:2000.  This was a rule system that I
TOTALLY missed out on.  What relation does this rule system have
with Classic Traveller and/or MegaTraveller, if any?  I also came
across the acronym "TNE:" in a posting that suggested that
GDW was working on yet another revision of the Traveller rules
(Traveller V3.0?).  This is something I have heard nothing about.

                                May you never misjump,

Adrian Hurt Notes:
[]And now you know why you have to be at least 10 diameters away from the
[]planet before you jump, preferably 100 diameters.  (And probably some
[]significant distance away from the star, too.)  If you\'re too close to
[]a gravity source, the jump capacitors or jump drive get overloaded.  Boom.

When working on my 2300ad SYSGEN program (I seem to do a lot of these, don\'t
I?) I had some calculation to figure the stutterwarp limit fro a star.

Given that:
   (1) Stutterwarp limit for a world is 0.0001g influence. 
   (2) Due to the square law, for earth this is 100 radii
   (3) Ergo -- Safe Jump Range ~= Stutterwarp limit

With that in mind, should T:TNE have Jump Limits delimited by MASS instead of
SIZE?  No matter if you have 1 earth mass in one earth diameter or in half an
earth diameter, the 0.0001g radius will be the same from the center of mass.
The only effect size has is how much distance you have to cover before you
reach the limit.

Likewise, for any star, the Jump limit will depend on the solar mass.
I think I calculated the limit for sol to be around 2.44 AU (past Mars),
but that was based on other assumptions.  If SIZE/DENSITY (thus MASS) is 
generated in the world building system, you can simply plug it into the
formula:

   JD = SQRT(mass) * 642 - (size/2)

Where (mass) is earth masses and (size) is diameter (in 1000\'s of km).

Result is in 1000\'s of km.  A simple table can be figured (G-Thrust vs. 
JD) to give a simple look-up of time to Jump Distance.

For stars, simply ignore the (size) modifier (you don\'t care about landing
on the surface!).  Time can be based on star\'s JD - (world AU * 14900).
If negative, you can jump after reaching the world\'s JD.

That\'s nothing.  See what happens if the same ship leaves its drives on for
a week.  (Actually, I\'ll tell you what happens.  TML gets bogged down with
another discussion of how to destroy a planet.  :-)  But approximately
constant acceleration for about an hour should be possible; and even if it
isn\'t, a ship with 2-G acceleration should still be able to get to 30000 m/s
without too much trouble.  The ship in question is likely to be the good old
Type S scout/courier, mass at least 840 tons, kinetic energy 3.78e14 J.  Like
I said, these might be big numbers, but they\'re what you have to deal with if
you want to move starships around.  I\'ll let you figure out the kinetic energy
available to some of the big warships, mass in the hundreds of thousands of
tons, acceleration 6-G!

Not so much "spent" as "lent" for about a week.  The ship gets the energy
back (or at least, some of it) when it comes back out of jump space.

Why?  The jump drive converts energy, presumably electrical energy and lots
of it, into some sort of "jump energy", in order to get the ship into jump
space in the first place.  It may be able to convert it back into electrical
energy, although some energy will be lost in the process, either as heat or
left behind somehow in jump space.  Otherwise, what happens to all the energy
produced when the jump drive burns up all that fuel?

Great.  Every ship that executes a jump gets fried when it re-enters our
universe.  This ought to ruin the day of a good few traders!  :-)

Yeh, he WOULD. |-> Welcome, Doc. My name\'s Metlay, and I\'m the TML 
Historian, when not separated from my library by 600 miles like
I am now. |-P My credentials are sufficient for the job, IMO.

Now then, to answer your queries:

They\'re alive but preparing to push a game of their own, A.I., rather
than continue to support Traveller. Their loss will be missed, despite
the fact that Joe Fugate\'s blithe editorial comments have shredded any
resemblance between Traveller physics and real physics (Hot Topic #1).

>2.      Does anyone know what GDW\'s and/or DGP Traveller line will be
>for 1992?

Traveller: The New Era will be released in the fall. See below.

The last issue of the MegaTraveller Journal (3) will be out eventually,
then DGP sews up their Traveller line, maybe for good.

>3.      I also came across some acronyms that weren\'t familiar to me.

T:2000 stands for Twilight:2000, a postnuclear game with a different 
rules system than Traveller\'s and a different history, which leads
into Traveller:2300, renamed 2300AD, also no relation to Trav or MegTrav.

Traveller: The NEw Era is the latest rev of Traveller (v.3.0) that is 
currently in preparation. It will use a new rules system based on the
same principles as Dark Conspiracy and the 2nd edition of Twilight,
and will take place several decades after the Rebellion, in the midst
of another societal collapse. GDW claims to be listening to our input
on these matters; however, they have stonewalled on certain things
that look really terrible, and the outlook (for those of us who use
the Imperium, especially) is glum.

Efate
 
Spinward Marches 1705 / Efate A646930-D
 
    Efate is a Libertarian\'s dream and everyone else\'s nightmare.  The
dominant society on Efate was founded by Solomani, possibly of Terran
French or colonial French ancestry, judging from the French names in
common use, but after a thousand years of folklore and revisionist
history, who can tell?  The Charter of Efate established a Libertarian
society -- that is, minimal-to-no government and a totally free market
economy.  The end result has been that (1) anything that can be sold for
a profit can be found for sale on Efate; (2) self-defense is not only
encouraged, it\'s mandatory; (3) power is in the hands of those with both
money and the respect of their neighbors.   
    Corollaries to (1 & 2): No manner of goods are illegal, including
weapons, drugs, and body modifications.  Everyone is either armed, or
can afford to hire competent armed security.  Long-lived people are
polite.  Certain classes favor cybernetic enhancements; Efate Vargr in
particular consider "chrome" to be the most macho status/charisma symbol
imaginable.  (note: GURPS Efate is my off again/on again Cyberpunk
campaign).  "Jacked" equipment is common on Efate, almost unknown
offworld (many Imperial worlds, and the common Imperial "spacer"
culture, consider plugging computers directly into your brain
distasteful, to say the least).  "Decking" is a common activity on the
Net; Efate computer security tends to be second to none behind the Claw;
so too, run the skills and equipment of Efate "crackers".  Efate
Cyberdecks are highly illegal items on most neighboring worlds of
similar tech levels, and computer experts from Efate are regarded with
suspicion elsewhere.
   Corporations on Efate are utterly cutthroat with each other, but
almost universally provide excellent customer service -- the customer
makes or breaks an Efate Corp or MegaCorp branch office.  Efate has the
finest corporate security, espionage and counter-espionage personnel
behind the Claw -- there is no government protection of trade secrets,
etc.  What would be legal disputes, including criminal ones, elsewhere,
are decided by private arbitration or custom here.
    On the several northern continents, the cities are primarily
inhabited by descendants of the Charter colonists, and immigrants who
have adopted the Libertarian way of life, as well as a large Vargr
community and almost any human or non-human minority imaginable.  Vargr
find the Libertarian ethos most congenial to their way of life.  The
rural areas are controlled by vast Agricorp estates and Aslan land
holdings; Efate is home to three minor Aslan clans.  The Aslan clans
wield power disproportionate to their numbers due to the wealth of the
clan holdings, and the influence of their honorable and thus highly
respected clan leaders.  
    Franklin "Down-Under" is on the Southern continent, which was
settled by peoples of different background than the Charter colonists;
mostly Vilani and mixed Solomani.  These folk have different customs,
and pay lip service to the Libertarian charter but run things in a more
formal fashion, though they are allowed no higher government structure
than local community level by the Charter.  Most of the rural holdings
here are ranches; the grasslands and desert were more suitable for
raising livestock than farming in the early days of Efate.  However,
Northern settlers looking for land in an area not all locked up in
AgriCorp lands or Aslan holdings have been moving down here and
homesteading farms -- at TL 13, farming is feasible and profitable in
some very unlikely areas -- and bringing the Northern, libertarian
social order with them.  The result has been constant conflict between
the "Franklanders" and the "Northerners"; under the Charter, the
Franklanders have no real recourse save violence if they cannot work out
a compromise with the Northerners.  Unfortunately, certain influential
factions of the Franklanders considered any compromise further
corruption of their Way of Life, and resolved to secede from the Charter
of Efate.  In 1105 they attempted to form the Republic of Franklin;
creating a government on the Southern continent where there had been
none before.  This caused very bad reactions from all the other power
groups on Efate (except the Aslan), who saw any form of Government as a
threat to the status quo -- and their perogatives.  The result was a
full-scale war where before there had been constant low-level
terrorism.  Efate being the way it is, the war was waged entirely with
mercenary forces on the one side, and entirely by dedicated rebels on
the other side.  
    The Imperium intervened when the war started infringing on the
Imperial Rules of War, and when the instability on Efate threatened
Imperial strategic interests in the Marches -- Efate is a major
shipbuilder, armaments supplier, and lynchpin of the coreward Marches
economy, after all.  During the Fifth Frontier war, it was discovered
that the Sword Worlds sponsored Ine Givar organization had been involved
in encouraging the "Rebellion".  It should be understood that the
grievances existed before ever the Sword Worlds got involved; the Ine
Givar advisors found volk who had similar views and ethics and played on
their sympathies as brethren in a sea of corrupt and decadent scum who
threatened their Way of Life.  The Sword Worlds connection provided the
financing that gave the Republican forces a fighting chance for so long,
and the Ine Givar advisors provided training not available from the
usual sources on Efate, who were all committed to fighting them.
    One other cultural note: the deadly cold characteristic of Efate
nights has resulted in a deeply ingrained dread or fear of being caught
"outside" at night, with nowhere to take shelter.  It also means that
only the most depraved would refuse someone shelter from the nocturnal
cold.

Date: December 19, 1991
Subject: GENIE

About the new revision that is in the works. First let me explain
who/what I am. I have been gaming for a very few years (About 7-8
years) compared to most of people speaking here. I\'ve only recently
begun to look into Traveller, having bought the Megatraveller set
last May and "The Traveller Book" a couple of weeks ago. (Kinda
redundant, but it was a mere $10.) I have yet to acquaint myself with
much beyond character generation, having only played in two games.

Now, how does this relate to the New Traveller.

For one, it places me in doubt as whether or not to continue to buy
any Traveller materials (of any of the incarnations), whether to wait
for this upcoming set, or whether or not to even continue to purchase
ANY Traveller oriented products, including these that are using
related systems.

I have also, the Dark Conspiracy book. I see a vast potential for
loss when changing from the Traveller to the DC system. Despite the
good intentions, if the Task system in Traveller was so horrid, how
could it have last 15 years?  I\'m quite sure that Traveller, like any
system, has it\'s flaws, but it\'s better to patch a couple of potholes
then to tear up the asphalt and start again. You (GDW and DGP) have
at your literal fingertips access to years of many upon many gamers
who have numbers of different fillers for the potholes.  listen to
them. Not only do they know what they\'re talking about, they happen
to have a great deal at stake based on your decisions.

Another thought -  There is the possibility of alienating the older
and newer gamers from each other. Diehards from one system may treat
the newer players as players of an alien system, meanwhile, there are
also no old hands to show anyone the ropes - one of the risks of a
new system.

And this virus I\'ve been reading about. Unless you do a good job of
setting it up, you\'ll lose in the long run.


If it is possible to join a list of playtesters, I would enjoy doing
so. As was mentioned before, it may be better to have newcomers do
such things as a bit of bias is lost.

remove \'artificial\' restrictions on things like starship acceleration.
If you accept my rule of thumb (1 thruster/anti-grav maneuver unit=650t),
you can quickly figure what the maximum acceleration attainable at any given
TL is going to be.  At TL15, for instance, a \'large\' fusion plant gives 18MW
per kl, or 9MW per ton.  70/9 tons are required to support a 35 ton
thruster unit with 650 tons of thrust output.  650/(35+(70/9))=15.2Gs.

At 10.4Gs, the Shriek is pretty fast, and would require special missiles--
6Gs probably wouldn\'t cut it.  (Well, OK, it could _fire_ 6-G missiles,
especially on a different heading, but 6-G missiles would rarely be able to
intercept one...)  It\'s also up in the range of acceleration that might be
considered to require special couches and high-G tolerance for the crew.





Shriek class Missile Boat TL15

     The Shriek class missile boat was designed for the Imperial Navy by 
ConTech of Glisten in 1112, as part of a proposed test of an \'escort rider\' 
squadron.  The theory of course, is that what works well for larger combat-
ants should work well for smaller ones.  However, several delays in funding 
had pushed the projected test date into 1123 by the time that Glisten was 
overrun by the Aslan in 1121.  Only six Shrieks had been built, and they 
served with distinction racking up twenty three kills of smaller Aslan war-
ships at a loss of only one Shriek.  The five surviving boats were evacuated 
aboard a Lobachevsky class fleet tender during the Imperial Glisten Navy\'s 
final retreat from the system around 110-1121, and are currently (1122) de-
fending the now-strategic starport in the Grote system.

It seems that my haitus from this list (~1.5 yrs since I\'ve read it, but
only 6 mos. since I dropped it to keep mail-admin from complaining...)
has left me baffled.

Could some kind soul send me the scoop on T:TNE (Travller: The Next
Edition?)?  Information I would like to see (:-)):

	a)  What are they doing to the rules?
	b)  When will it be released?
	c)  Can I get my hands on a play-test copy?
	d)  Any and all rumors ;-)

The reason for the above questions is simple:

	I\'ve run traveller before, and I\'m starting up a new campaign by
	creating a universe for the players to explore/be from.  It\'d
	be nice to do so with a coherent set of rules, not the gook that
	is MegaTraveller (Yes, I\'ve run it.  Yes, I hate it :-().  And
	while Orig. Traveller is good (Yes, I\'ve run it, yes I like it)
	there are several holes in the rules.

So, anybody out there got any answers?  My mail box is waiting :-)

Thanx,

I\'d probably rate them as an inferior form of white globe.  Therefore,
TL=20+  I seem to remember personal white globes as being TL=21 so it
might be possible to put them in at high TL20.  I won\'t say anything about
how they work.  The cost is going to be excessive if you can even locate
the things.

It might be saner to rate them as even more advanced than white globes since
they have properties that white globes aren\'t supposed to have ---- transparent,
only allow slow things through.  I know that no players I GM for would get
their hands on a (fully) working version ;-}

The background. The detailed painstakingly-worked-on-for-15-years
background that GDW now feels is too intimidating for new players.
I dunno. Maybe it is. But I do know that a science-fiction game
set in a universe with many worlds is inevitably going to be pain-
fully short of data. The player characters should be able go get
lots and lots of information about any planet they visit. But in
Real Life (tm) the referee usually just don\'t have the time to
work out lots and lots of detail. So what can he do? He can fall
back on a computer-generated list of numbers ("Well, it\'s got a
class A starport, it\'s roughly earthsized with a dense atmosphere
and it\'s about 1/3 covered with water. What? A map? No, sorry.").
Or he can use what other people produce. The Traveller universe
were just approaching a reasonable level of information (at least
in a few select sectors). And now they\'re going to 1) not fill out
what\'s missing, and 2) invalidate half of what\'s already there...

copy of Cats and Rats for a friend.  I was pleased to see that Hard Times
is out.  Hard Times is a sourcebook which explains the outline of the 
Rebellion from 1120-1125, and provides rules for determining the course
of the break down of Imperial culture from 1125-1128.  In addition, a 
connected series of ten mini-adventures is provided to show the break down
in progress, and discuss the strategies that planets are using to cope
with it.  Discussion and rules mods for starmercs, trade among the the
\'wild\' planets, new encounter tables, pirate group creation, and a few
other topics are included.  In addition, the rules for pre-gravitic
spacecraft are repeated (with some modifications) from Challenge#45.
(No, the fuel consumption for fusion rockets isn\'t fixed--multiply by
100 for more reasonable values, and don\'t forget the house rule fission
fuel fix I use...1 yr/1 hr.)  Data at the beginning and end of the decay
period are provided for two subsectors of Diaspora, on the borders of 
Margaret\'s domain.

(Oh--new rules: cannibalized parts, trading in worn equipment...)

I\'m generally a fan of the work Chuck Gannon has done in Challenge, which
is one of the few things that keeps me buying the magazine, and this is
up to his usual standard.  In fact, I might go so far as to say that this is
possibly the best piece of MT support material to be issued by GDW, at
least as far as content.  (I have some quibbles with the format in some
sections--use of two columns on facing pages in such a way as to cause the
text to be read 1 x x 2 is potentially confusing, and a bit annoying to me
personally.  Your mileage may vary.)  However, some of you will not be
interested--it is dark and grim.  I find the release of this product
ironic in two ways: it shows marked improvement over previous GDW releases
at a time when they are just about to discontinue support of the game as we
know it, and it provides a reasonably well though out mechanism for providing
the \'Space Viking\' setting without using any superviruses, and in a time
shift which isn\'t so great as to make playing through the intervening years
completely unthinkable.  (Thus, it\'s what we\'ve been requesting, thrown to
us a bone to pacify us before the big change comes.)

plant manage the energy required to escape a stellar gravity well?

A:  Assumptions:  one 4p -> He4 reaction leads to 26.73 MeV of 
energy available to the power plant.  I don\'t know if this includes
neutrino losses, but Nuke phys. isn\'t one of my physics specialties.

Also, the biggest jump you\'d like to make is from Mercury\'s orbit
of a solar mass star to escape velocity.  This is reasonable to first
order because you don\'t want to get much closer to a star than this (at
least on a bound orbit) and as mass goes up, luminosity goes up and
you don\'t want to be close to that star.

Also, I\'ll use a naive starship of a HG type Scout ship which masses
100,000 kg and uses 20,000 kg of fuel to jump 2.  

The energy required to escape from the sun (GMm/r) at Mercury\'s 
orbit is 2.22 x 10^9 Joules.  I calculate that from 100% efficient
fusion (assuming the jump costs only escape energy) you could get
5.8 x 10^7 jumps from the Scout ship\'s required jump fuel.  Obviously
there are other costs:-)  

On a related note, I remember doing a calculation with Dow Rieder
(gods that was a long time ago) to find out whether such a scout
ship could thrust for 4 weeks (as the old rules seem to imply) on
its maneuver fuel.  We calculated 30% mass-> energy conversion
was required if all the energy were converted to acceleration.  
Obviously a problem.

The assumption that starship engines are 100% efficient is not
unreasonable, because if they weren\'t, the heat lost would fry
a starship in a fraction of a second (this is quoted from an
old Space Gamer, around #40 authored by a person whom I cannot
remember at this time.)  

Lastly, I like the idea about jumping from bound state to bound
state with the same energy around a companion star, but it has
some flaws.  How about transfer of angular momentum?  It may
not be possible to satisfy both in a jump.  Momentum would
have to take preference in the conservation laws as energy can
be released or absorbed by heat (and radiation.)  Note that
it would be theoretically possible to make a jump where the
energy released in the jump to be greater than the energy 
stored in the ship\'s heat, sending it below absolute zero in
temperature.  

One "physics nullifier box" solution may be absorption and
release of energy from additions or subtractions to the vacuum
zero point energy in the jump region.  Release would cause 
a lot of particles to appear and annihilate each other and
release a lot of energy.  Absorption is more of a problem.
Anyone want to consider wormholes?

  I believe that Efate is capitol of Tahiti or one of the other archipelago 
states in the pacific. I\'m resonably certain that it was a French colony once,
since I looked it up for usable names when I did my version of Efate, and 
most of them were French (BTW, the result looked quite similar to yours: 
Libertaria with cyberpunk although I had more internal differences between the
walled corporate blocks and the slums on unused land. Also, all spaceports 
were either corporate, imperial (IN & IISS), or pay-to-pay. There were ofcourse
the possibility of setting down for free in a vacant lot in the slums, if 
one felt very adventureous:)

  There is no official standard I think, but most people (Xfinger:) have access
to either Gif or postscript. I\'d think that postscript is more usable for maps
since it is easily printable.

  Since the original energy from the drives goes into the jumpfield, which is
held up during the entire jump to isolate from \'jumpspace\' and the nessesary
energy for compensating for kinetic differences between the two locally 
strongest gravitational sources and the difference in potential energy is taken
from it. Isn\'t it easy to assume that an energy gain will be deposited in this
field?
  If it is, it would probably be radiated as heat energy when the field breaks
down at jump-exit. Is this enough to damage the ship? The density of radiation
(in the IR band, probably) is the determining factor here, and I don\'t know
enough physics to compute it without a lot of litterature that I don\'t carry
with me.

Metlay:

Probably this isn\'t the place to discuss this, but maybe someone wants to 
hear something other than the (very legitimate) Trav: TNG concerns.

Let\'s assume we have a 400 ton Free trader like the one in the Traveller
Book.  It has a radius (wingspan) of about 50 m.  Let\'s also assume that
the wormhole must be a created singularity with a Schwarzschild radius
just sufficient to swallow the ship (50m.)  Don\'t ask about the details.

>From R = 2GM/c^2 we get that it\'s mass must be 3.37 x 10^28 kg, or 1/60
of a solar mass.  We can get a very rough (order of magnitude) estimate
on how far any orbit will be deviated (assume the distance travel equals
0.5at^2, remember this is a very crude approximation.)  Then we find that
the (maximal) distance from its original orbit is x = Gmt^2/2r^2.
Where t is the amount of time the wormhole is in existance.  This formula
won\'t be too absurd as long as t is "small."  For a radius of 1 A.U.
for the above singularity lasting for, say, 10 minutes the deviation
would be 45 cm.  Not a big deal.  At a radius of 100 planetary radii, 
the calculated distance would be about 8 x 10^5 meters (I suspect the
formula wouldn\'t be valid here, but you could calculate the total energy
change of the orbit.)  This would be very measureable.  

Now, a lot of large ships jumping from nearby would cause a big 
problem to a system.  A naval station would have real problems and
jumping with a fleet in formation would be impossible.  Is this
what you found?  Are there other complications I\'m overlooking?
(I\'m choosing to ignore the creation of 1/60 of a solar mass worth
of energy to create the wormhole:-)  

I thought others may be interested in this but maybe private communication
would be more appropriate.

  If it was, then TSR wouldn\'t sell any Forgotten Realms gameworlds and 
accessories. It is well known that I think that the background is the best
part of Traveller, and I\'ll reinforce that statement and say that Traveller has
the *best* background measured in consistency and amount of background
available for *any* SFRPG that I know of. 

  The trouble has been that there has never been any proper compilation of it.
No one source were you could go to find out if the stats for Norris had been
defined, or if the UPP for Deneb had been produced. So confusion and internal
consistency went down over time (IMHO, it started with MegaTraveller).

  For a good example of this, look up the UPP for Deneb in the Imperial 
Encyclopedia. I think it is under \'Travellers Digest\' or \'Digest\'. Compare
with the UPP given in the sector data from GEnie or in Digest the realworld
paper...

  The tactics adopted by the Traveller General Command seems to be "Make 
internal inconsistency the normal state" which looks to me as making morals
out of necessity (That was a poorly translated Swedish proverb:)

Not quite. There were a number of early Traveller ideas that were later
changed retroactively. One example is the scale of Imperial warships
that I\'ve mentioned before. Another is the concept of The Spinward Marches
being on the very edge of explored space (remember the mysterious unknown
Outrim Void mentioned in _Leviathan_? That turned out to have a sector-full
of aslans, some of them long-time trading partners, on the other side.)

Another example is the two sub-sectors of Trojan Reach published in
_Leviathan_. Whoever later generated the complete Trojan Reach apparently
couldn\'t be bothered to incorporate them properly but just generated
completely new stats for them. :-P

Btw. wouldn\'t that be an interesting project: A complete, collected-in-one-

course (except for such inconsistencies as might actually be in a library
data pack). I\'ve produced a number of library data for my players, some
corrections of existing (inconsistent) data, others completely new. We
might produce something really useful there. Hmmm... perhaps two sets:
One ca. 1110 for Old Traveller refs and one ca. 1120.

NATIONAL REEMERGENCE: Social and political phenomenon seen on scores of
solomani-settled  planets  in the wake of the fall of the 2nd Imperium.
During  the  400  years or so that the 2nd Imperium survived,  a goodly
number of the thinly settled planets in Delphi,  Diaspora, Massila, Old
Expanses and Solomani Rim sectors were colonised from Terra.  Emigrants
had  a  tendency to go to planets where people of their ethnic and cul-
tural  background were already established.  Nationalism as such was an
ill-favoured concept in the days of The Terran Federation and continued
to be under under The 2nd Empire.  Peaceful culturalism, however,  were
not,  and  different  groups  usually coexisted without any significant
trouble.
    But as the Twilight fell and  The Long Night  grew steadily darker,
ethnic and cultural sub-groups on scores of planets dug up old cultural
differences  and  used them as a rallying point to increase the group\'s
sense of identity.  These reconstructed cultures were usually extremely
romantizised, often twisted almost beyond recognition,  but all of them
focused  on a past glorious grandeur and a coming similar glory for the
group.  Examples  are the  \'truebrits\'  of Cymbeline/Solomani Rim,  the
\'inheritors\'  of Scandia/Solomani Rim and the \'neo-germanics\' of Funft-
reich/Diaspora.  Often an old forgotten language were reconstructed and
made the national language at the same time,  usually at the expense of
the anglic that had been the universal language of  The Terran Confede-
ration  and  The 2nd Empire.  On  some  planets anglic lingered on as a
second language,  on others it was vigorously suppressed.  Many planets
were renamed at the same time.
    Many  planets in the Domain of Deneb and beyond it was colonized by
neo-nationalists.  When their planets were reintegrated into  The Third
Empire  there  were usually groups that preferred emigration to staying
under the new regime. Thus Caledonia/Glisten was colonized from Duncan/
Alpha Crucis,  Ghandi/Lanth  from  Cathay/Vega and  Olympia/Lunion from
Athene/Ultima.
    Opinions about neo-nationalism is sharply divided.  On some planets
it  led to a greater sense of community,  prevented polarization of the
society  and  propably  to  a greater or lesser extent saved the planet
from regression or destruction.  On others,  especially on planets with
more  than  one dominant group,  it led to balkanization,  wars and de-
struction.

There\'s Victoria, written up in the _Journal_ #2 (and presumably
in _Best of Journal_ #1), and Fulacin, written up in Adventure 3,
_Twilight\'s Peak_. Both of these are very detailed. Knorbes has a
site that\'s mentioned very slightly in Adventure 1, _Kinunir_.
Pixie has one that\'s written up in _Traveller\'s Digest_ #21, but
before you place it there consider the likelihood of someone
coming from Trojan Reach on his way to Rhylanor with three friends
in cold sleep detouring to Pixie without consulting his friends
because he heard about an unknown Ancient site. If I ever run that
adventure I will change the planet to one more or less on the way
between Trojan Reach and Rhylanor.

Be that as it may, four more planets in Regina Subsector has
Ancient sites, though none are written up. Efate is one and I
forget the other three, but they\'re mentioned in Alien module
5, _Droyne_. Darrian was an Ancient planet (any planet except
Terra with a "native" human race was an Ancient planet), but
most or all traces are presumably gone. Andory and Vanejen were
Ancient planets too (any Droyne and Chirper world is). Any
asteroid belt in the habitable zone around a planet may be an
Ancient ex-planet. The Shionty Belt (where antimatter can be
found drifting around) is thought to be one such.

Incidentally, if a kilo of antimatter hits a ton of matter,
how much of the matter gets converted to energy?

Btw. I\'d be very interested in any of your own Ancient sites,
if you\'ve got them written up.

  I am under the impression that there were a period of a few years, in 
gameterms(*) just before and after the 5th FW, when the universe were stable 
and established. I can write off any inconsitencies before that as \'childhood 
problems\' for the game. But to step off this stable platform and jump into 
self-inconsistency is not a good move.

  Thanks. \'Virtue\' is the right word.

  This highlights one of the IMHO most interesting topics that hasn\'t been
mentioned except in passing: What happened on Earth during the Long Night?
  
  There are some shreads of data: The moon was never abandoned. Late during
the night there existed an interstellar state incorporating Terra, so some
interstellar communications must have been restored by then. Other than that
we know next to nothing about a several hundred year long period.

  The reason this is slightly more interesting than "what happened on this-
planet-or-that-planet" is that the accounts of Terra around 1000 Imperial 
gives me the impression that nothing happened. A whole planet was just low-
berthed in 2400 Terran and thawed up around 400 Imperial with all place-names
intact, all old nations still remembered. S&A seems to indicate that the
great geographical changes like the flooding of the Quatara depression 
even happened before the 1st Insterstellar War. And since the Long Night fell
in -1700 Imperial, and the next mention is around 100 Imperial, we are talking
about a period of time of 1800 years during which nothing important happened!

  I\'ll be the first to admit that technology-wise nothing important really 
happened. Earth just passed the same techlevels twice, once on the way down and
once of the way up. But history is so much more than technological achievements.
Where are all the wars that can happen in 1800 years? Where are all the new
nations? All languages mutate over time but anglic still remains? Where are all
the great Heroes and Villains of history that appear during 1800 years? Where
are all the writers and all the new cliches?

  Can anybody remember any official or semi-official source that mentions 
anything that happened on Earth during those 1800 years?

Is this inside information? As far as I recall Andor is merely
the prime candidate for Droyne homeworld. Nobody knows for sure.
The pattern of Ancient sites indicate a center "somewhere in
The Spinward Marches or Trojan Reach", but for all we know it
may be Shionty. Note that Andor falls outside the ideal Droyne
planet profile of size 4, atmosphere 8, hydrographics 4 found
on the Tirem rosette worlds. (I can\'t remember Candory\'s UPP,
but it has a lower population than Andor and a type 6 government
(captive government), so I assume that Candory was colonized
from Andor).
I don\'t recall any explicit mentions of Ancient sites on Andor
either (though I wouldn\'t be surprised if there were some there).

As an aside, here is the my (very unofficial) library data entry
for Andor:

- ----8X----

ANDOR (Spinward Marches 0236 C695735-9): Medium-sized imperial
planet with dense tainted atmosphere, 46% sea, high population,
self-perpertuating oligarchial rule, moderate law and early
stellar technology.
   Andor is inhabited by DROYNE. It was contacted briefly by scouts
during the First Survey. The inhabitants proved to have had jump
technology for several thousand years and had at one time explored a
number of planets in the surrounding area, but had not established
any permanent colonies anywhere, except on the neighboring world of
CANDORY, presumably because of the astrographical isolation of the
two star-systems (the next closest system being three parsecs away)
which makes contact using only jump-1 ships difficult and costly.
   The planet was placed under interdict by the Scouts in 602 for
[restricted reasons]. A treaty signed in 658, admitting Andor and
Candory to the Imperium, makes the inhabitants full citizens,
however, giving them, among other things, the ordinary \'right to
travel\' (see IMPERIAL CONSTITUTION), which means that in spite
of the interdict the inhabitants of the two planets can come and
go freely. [Last update 325-734].

- ----8X----

Notes: Words in capitals are references to other entries, some
of which, however, hasen\'t been written yet. I haven\'t worked
out the Imperial Constitution for example. I wanted to explain
the Free Trader from Andor, an interdicted planet, mentioned in
Book 8, _Merchants_. My explanation is that Imperial citizens
have the right to travel to any non-interdicted world. We know
from what we\'ve been told about Shionty that the Imperium allows
inhabitants of an interdicted world to stay on it even after the
interdict. Propably that is because they have a constitutional
right to stay there ("The Imperium shall make no laws requiring
the residents of any planet to leave..."). Of course it dosen\'t
necessarily follow that someone from an interdicted world will
be let back in once he\'s left, but I decided from the existence
of the droyne Free Trader from Andor that such was the case.

Note that non-citizens from interdicted worlds propably _dosen\'t_
have the right to come and go (Algine). Furthermore some kinds
of interdictions (like quarantines) may suspend even a citizen\'s
right to travel.

I haven\'t decided on what that restricted reason for the
Interdict is, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if it was because of
the presense of one or more Ancient sites. The Imperium cannot
explore them without permission from the droyne (not easily
obtained as anybody who\'ve read about the droyne will know) and
they daren\'t risk anybody else (like the zhodani) getting in there
ahead of them.

I still say, not quite. The fleet tonnage rose to reflect the
billions and billions of people in the universe, but GDW
failed to realize that this would apply to civilian shipping
too. The starports continued to accomodate mere scores of
ships, and the major shipping line in Aramis Subsector still
piddled around with a paltry 100.000 tons worth of ships. You
had mighty 100.000 tons warships protecting mighthy 5000 tons
freighters from deadly 400 tons corsairs. Tourists travelled
between planets with population level A in scores instead of
millions and the encounter tables let you meet several other
ships each week regardless of the of the population size of the
system you were in. No, I was forgetting: In MegaTraveller you\'d
add 1 to the encounter table if the system had population A...

Of course, the problem with making civilian shipping realistic
is that player characters drown in the crowd. They\'d have the
same chance of getting a cargo for their 200 T Free Trader that
you and I have of getting a cargo for the family car. Pirates
(in their 20.000 T Corsairs) would laugh themselves silly at
the thought of wasting time on capturing them.

    Hmmm, well, I tend to feel that is dependent on the economic situation,
and is not something that should be hardcoded into the design sequence.  Let
me put it this way: what you say holds true if the supplier has monopoly; in
a competitive situation, prices will lower as production costs lower.
Compare the prices of a PC today with the price of an IBM PC at date of introduction
in 1981, or worse yet, with that of CP/M machines (Gawd, I\'m dating myself!)
a couple years before that.  Not only that, compare the capabilities of 
a "standard" PC (386SX, 1 meg memory, 40 meg HD, VGA) with that of a "standard"
PC then (8088, 64-128K memory, 1 360K floppy (actually introduced with 1 
128K floppy), and monochrome text-only).  Capability has gone up and prices 
have gone down!  In a purely market-driven, competitive situation, this is
what will happen.  Personally, I think either prices are fixed due to collusion
between the megacorps and the Imperium, in which case small yards will offer
better deals just to get a slice of the action, or free market conditions
rule, in which case prices should probably be figured as they are for Vargr
worlds -- different each place.  You could calculate them randomly, or 
somebody could modify them for trade classes, etc.  However, given that we
want some baseline "book value" for our starships, said "book value" should
at least represent the actual change in value of things due to technological
improvement in the item itself, and in the production process.

Scott Kellogg:

    There are various bizarre reasons why the price of American military
equipment is artificially high.  These have to do with the high R&D costs to
secure a government contract, and the need to recover those costs even if
Congress or the Pentagon decides to cut off the production run after 1
plane/ship/tank has rolled out of the factory; the often very short production
runs (how many Kennedy class aircraft carriers are we building?) that 
disallow any of the advantages of mass production; and so on.  Perhaps
you could represent these factors by disallowing the 80% discount from any
military craft that aren\'t produced by the thousands.  Or, you could rule
that my modifications do not apply to military production.
    I tend to look at ship design from the point of view of building civilian
and Scout service vehicles, rather than Navy/Army/Marine stuff.  From the 
non-military point of view, the pricing is completely cock-eyed.  You compared
the cost of a B-2 to a starship; compare the cost of a small Great Lakes
freighter to a starship.  A long time ago, you all discussed the fact that
a Free Trader can barely make bank payments, let alone enough to let the
owner retire in comfort.  No real conclusion was reached.  Let me point out
that in the real world, people don\'t start businesses that they don\'t expect
to make money at; and if they fail, 100 other people don\'t immediately follow
in their footsteps in the same business.  For the MT universe to function as
depicted, starships must be profitable to own and operate, or there will be
no interstellar trade.  The problem is, as written, the profitability of a
merchant ship DROPS as size increases.  I now turn this post over to Steve,
who has been sitting in a corner quietly running numbers through a  calculator.

Steve Higginbotham:

Cynthia mis-states the basic problem - profitability decreases as PERFORMANCE
increases.  A free trader (jump-1, 1-G) will be MARGINALLY profitable even if
your free trader is 5000 displacement tons.
HOWEVER, let\'s look at the basic unit of passenger transport in the Imperium -
the Tukera long-liner (why is it the basic unit?? because the various published
information about Tukera over the years all say so.  In the Core, there are no
other passenger ships.)

A Tukera long liner (Type RT) costs 247.08MCr.  Therefore it requires an
initial investment of 49.4 MCr.  Note that if this money were deposited into a
bank at 4.5% per annum, it would earn the owner MCr 2.223 per year.
The starship owner must make the following payments (per year) : 

               ship payments : MCr 12.354
               maintenance   : MCr  0.247
               crew salaries : MCr  0.144 (approximately - this is the most
                                   variable part - salaries are a function of
                                   skill levels, among other things)
               life support  : MCr  2.500 (this cost requirement is silly,
but
                                   the rules use them, so I will, too)
               insurance     : MCr ??? (let\'s ignore this, or subsume it into
                                   the ship\'s payments - too many variables)

               total         : MCr 15.245

The ship\'s revenues are as follows (with various loading assumptions listed)

               passengers : (100%) : MCr  8.400
                            ( 90%) : MCr  7.650
                            ( 75%) : MCr  6.250
                            ( 60%) : MCr  5.100

               freight    : (100%) : MCr  3.247
                            ( 90%) : MCr  2.922
                            ( 75%) : MCr  2.435
                            ( 60%) : MCr  1.948

               Totals     : (100%) : MCr 11.647
                            ( 90%) : MCr 10.572
                            ( 75%) : MCr  8.685
                            ( 60%) : MCr  7.048


Notice that the best case assumption produces losses of MCr 3.598 per annum.
I personally disbelieve in the 100% assumption.  I prefer the 90% assumption,
since I believe that there would be more ships running the route if there was a
higher demand, and I disbelieve that the ship was created with the EXACT size
to move the people that want to be moved all the time.  However, I digress.

Using the 100% assumption, at the end of the mortgage period, the ship-owner is
in debt to the tune of MCr 193.32.  With the ship payments removed, that debt
will be cleared in 22 more years.

So, at the end of 62 years, your starship will BEGIN to make money for you. 
Note that this discounts the need to amortize the debt induced over the years. 
If that assumption is made, the ship will break even after 75+ years.

After that, the ship will make the owner MCr 8.755 per year.  Since the
effective life span of a ship is about 100 years (source : old Traveller),
the ship will make the owner MCr 332.7 over it\'s lifetime (IF he has a full
load EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE 2500 FLIGHTS.

Over the same period, the owner would have made MCr 3981.073 by putting the
initial investment in the bank at 4.5%.

I have never heard of an investor getting rich by putting his money in a
savings account.  I have also never heard of an investor getting rich on an
investment with a LOWER return than a bank (by a factor of SEVEN).  I can\'t
even recall ever hearing of an investor who MADE an investment like that
twice.  I suspect that they are all collecting Welfare now.

In fact, that analysis can be applied to EVERY merchant ship ever designed for
MT.  Virtually all J-3 ships will tend to suck up money for generations. MOST
J-2 ships will also.  Given that the J-2 ships are primarily passenger ships,
with adequate stewards, they can come out slightly ahead.  They don\'t come out
ahead of the savings account, but that is someone else\'s problem.  J-1 ships
will mostly make a little money.  They even make more money than a savings
account.  Not quite so much as most Money Market accounts, but, again someone
else\'s problem.

Note that fuel costs were ignored in this discussion.  It can be demonstrated
that it is more cost-effective to buy fuel at a starport than to use wilderness
refueling.  Therefore the profits indicated will never actually be achieved by
a ship.  ALAS!

Cynthia has just suggested that passenger/freight fees could be raised. 
Possibly.  In a normal economy, doing so would encourage local development of
resources, rather than interstellar trade.  More people would stay home, and
ships would be in worse shape than ever.  Besides, there are indications that
the Imperium regulates passenger/freight fees to the existing levels.

As to the suggestion that the starships operate by spec trade rather than
freight consignment, this IS possible.  It is also possible (probable, in fact)
that the smart investor will buy the stuff up WITHOUT pouring money into a
starship, and ship it as freight.  Let some other fool lose money by buying a
ship.  There will always be idiots who go broke doing this, who can be milked
by an alert investor.  Note that in the case of a subsidized route, the
government is the idiot in question, and the populace is the entity being
milked by the alert investor.

Therefore, most investors will NOT invest in a starship, which will lose them
gobs of money, but rather make use of someone else\'s starship (so someone else
can lose gobs of money, while you MAKE gobs of money).  There is every
indication (from the tables) that only a small ship (400 tons or less) can make
any significant amount of money by spec trade.  Significant in terms of
starship payments.  If there was that much money to be made, Tukera would get
an exclusive contract, and the profit to a starship owner would vanish.  

The upshot is that no ship will ever make enough money to convince the buyer to
buy it.  So either there are NO ships, or the government buys and runs them
all, to the detriment of the private sector (read: PCs).  Or we lower ship
costs.  Which we did.

Notice that in the Vargr Extants, ship prices can be as much as 30% lower than
normal.  This might lead one to suspect that virtually all ships are made in
the Extants, or that there is a major black-market in Vargr ships (if the
Imperium tries to control ship prices at that arbitrarily high level).

Actually, in the real world, roughly 2/3 of all small businesses fold
within three years, because they weren\'t profitable.  I\'ve been told
that the single biggest reason for this is that they expected to make
a profit too quickly, and hence didn\'t have enough starting capital.

>The problem is, as written, the profitability of a
>merchant ship DROPS as size [Jay: actually performance] increases.

Actually, this was a problem that I saw back in the original Traveller,
and have corrected every time I was GM (and in most games I wasn\'t).
Basically, it would be more consistant to charger freight and
passengers for distance, rather than jumps!  In the real world airlines,
the cost of a ticket is related to the fuel used by the planes.
Real world freight charges are for distance.  In special cases, fast
delivery costs MUCH extra.

In the traveller case, a ship that goes Jump-6 distance should get
the same base rate if the ship is Jump-1 capable or Jump-6 capable.
Actually, the Jump-6 ship should get a premium for certain types of
cargo (anything which is time-specific); even without the premium,
it has fewer expenses and can make more distance during a year than
a Jump-1 capable ship.

I haven\'t run the numbers, but even with this system (but without
a premium for faster delivery), I\'m not sure that a J-6 ship would
be the most profitable.  It would have much less cargo space, due
to increased fuel and engine sizes.  I have the feeling that the
most profitable merchant ship would be around J-3 or 4, but that
is mostly guesswork.

[Please forgive me if I am wrong about how freight charges work; the
GM who ran the only MegaTraveller game I was in told me this was
the way things worked, and he had never seen the original Traveller.
I figure if he thought it worked this way, he read it in the rules.
I do know that it worked this way in the original rules, and I thought
it was stupid then.  Please email any flames.]

There are several things that have been missed in the discussions of the
levels of technology in the Imperium.

First, and most important, is that you must always bear in mind that the
Imperium has an extremely diverse range of cultures.  I have been considering
writing an article about it, but I\'ll summarize my ideas here.  We know that
there are forty-two branches of the human race, each of which possesses several
cultural strains within it, which have their roots in their pre-stellar
histories.  These cultural elements, in most cases, have not completely died
out, and many human cultures continue to develop and thrive.  Most such
cultures are dominant on only a handful of worlds each.  Some minor human races,
the Darrians, for example, have a wider influence.  The two most widespread
human cultural traditions are, of course, those of the Solomani and the
Vilani.

Now, each of these cultural traditions carries with it a complex of attitudes
toward the nature and purposes of technology.  The Imperium has developed
a super-culture, which is what we generally think of when we talk about the
Imperium, but this super-culture is participated in by a relatively small
number of Imperial citizens:  the nobility, officials of the Imperial
government, members of Imperial services (the Scouts, especially), and
merchants.  Most others do not have the need or resources to participate in
this super-culture.  But I\'m digressing.

The Imperial super-culture is made up of many disparate cultural elements, but
especially of Solomani and Vilani elements.  And we know how radically different
the Solomani and Vilani attitudes towards technology are.  The Solomani tend
to believe that technological advancement is inherently good.  The Vilani tend
to be much more suspicious of technology.

You can see the effects of these disparate attitudes manifested in many ways
in the Imperium.  There are High Stellar worlds distributed throughout the
Imperium.  But most TL 16 worlds are in Massilia sector--the rimward side of
the Imperial core.  Old Expanses sector has, if I remember correctly, more
TL 15 worlds than any other Imperial sector.  Vland sector, on the other hand,
has a wider distribution of technology levels, and several subsector capitals
aren\'t even in the High Stellar range, though Vland sector is the longest-
settled sector in the Imperium.

The difference between Solomani and Vilani attitudes is even more striking if
you look at worlds in the Solomani Confederation.  MOST WORLDS IN THE
SOLOMANI CONFEDERATION ARE HIGH STELLAR!

According to the World Builder\'s Handbook, by Tech Level 10, it is possible to
create cities in ANY environment.  Thus, in a sense, there is no need for
technology more advanced than TL 10.  Thus, I think, the Imperial attitude,
growing out of the Vilani attitude, is that it is a waste of effort to raise
the level of technology on a world above that required to meet the conditions
of that world.  That technology does continue to advance is due to the
neccesity of possessing the latest military technology, and the universal
desire for better medical care, as well as the Solomani tendency to love tech
for its own sake.

BTW, I suspect that an additional consideration is that worlds in the Imperium
tend to desire considerable autonomy and self-sufficiency.  The Solomani 
Confederation is willing to sacrifice self-sufficiency for nearly universal
high levels of technology.  This, I believe, made it relatively easy for the
Imperium to reconquer the Solomani Rim in the Solomani Rim war, and relatively
difficult for the Solomani to seize Imperial worlds in the Rebellion.
