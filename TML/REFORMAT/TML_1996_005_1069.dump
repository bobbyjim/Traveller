[On the use of Imperial Marines]

Well, if you want to interrogate anyone, to try and shut down the local Ine
Givar, you really need to take prisoners and collect intellegence material.
Also, what if the Ine Givar leader slipped of to the corner store for a
six-pack before the impact?  While you try to figure out who was killed
through DNA testing, he\'s out there rallying the troops *and* cranking up
the press release about the heartless Imperial Navy, killing innocent civilans!

If you want to take prisoners, give the Marines flash/bang grenades and the
TL-15 equivilant of tear gas.  Have the grav APC hovering overhead using
passive sensors to track movement inside the base, and then hit them hard
and fast.  The sight of men in battledress, spraying the room with tranq
rounds from Gauss rifles, combined with the effects of the stun grenades and
gas, will take the fight out of anyone.  You now have prisoners who can
stand trial, an entire base for the kids at Naval Intellegence to take apart
in loving detail for hints about other Ine Givar activity, and since you did
this with mostly non-lethal weapons, good press for the Imperium.

If this is a decapitation raid, then the Marines carry plasma weapons and
Gauss rifles.  You still want the intel from this base intact, so the only
major difference is the substitution of lethal force for the more restrained
capture option.

And if the guerrilas happen to occupy an inhabited area?  Or are operating
in a major city?

Your arguement reminds me of the Army Air Corps claim that it won WWII..
despite evidence that the massive bombings really prolonged the war. Even
today, the Air Force can\'t guarntee that it will hit a target more than 50%
of the time, and you are proposing striking small guerrila units with
orbital stikes?  the guerillas are *winning*, since they are tying down your
assets, and causing you to have to act in an overbearing manner.

Of course the Imperium gives a damn!  The Imperium isn\'t the absolute
dictatorship you seem to see it as, it is responsible to the Nobility, and
to its citizens.  I cannot see that many Admirals who would be willing to
carry out orders that amounted to unrestricted warfare against civilans.
(Even in the Rebellion, it took years for the major powers to get that
desperate, and I imagine that quite a few of Lucan\'s Flag Officers were
executed for refusal to obey those orders.)

Okay, quick test:  name the four US Navy bases that house ballistic missle
subs.  Hint:  two of them are so secret the President doesn\'t know where
they are!  We only know that there are four because of a leaked budget
report, and that could have been disinformation.

Your comment about tech superiority makes me smile and remember the parades
we had on Vietnam Victory Day, after our technologicaly superior force, with
almost uncontested air superiority, defeated the Viet Cong and their North
Vietnamese allies..

Because the war isn\'t over until you *occupy* the enemy\'s territory.

No. I, as the defending commander, scatter my forces, hiding everything I
can, put my equivilant of Special Forces into area that are likely to be
landing/occupation zones to organize resistence.  My armies blend into the
civilan population, with orders to wait for the word to come down.

I\'m not going to give you much to shoot at.  Except of coure for the vehicle
parks filled with my outdated and shop worn vehicles, EM noise makers that
sound like headquarters radio traffic, and a few token PDM launches.. Yep
we\'re real helpless down here..

And I get on my radio and order my troops out to start repairs.  I have a
planet.  You have a starship.  Let\'s see who runs out of spare parts first.

I think you underestimate the spirit of the people involved.. my father
survived the Blitz, and he stands a little taller when he talks about how
England came together as one during those days. People are going to get by,
they have in the past, and they will through this.

>At this point, I simply demand their surrender. What can they do to
>resist? Damn all.

Say "Nuts!"  The mission statement you mentioned above says the following:

">I have a mission to take and hold a
>particular planet and certain installations and cities on its surface"

>Do I need to garrison the planetary surface? Nope. Simply designate a
>government down there to be in charge and let *them* do my dirty work. If

So you\'ve set up you Vichy government, and still there is insurgent
activity.  Your puppets are screaming for help... And you massacre civilans.
Congrats!  You now have government troops defecting to the partisans, and
your own puppets might be looking for a way to backstab you. If you keep
issuing orders from on high without any support, you will be ignored. 

>And this assumes that there is something down there that I *really* need.
>If there isn\'t, well, all bets are off!

Ah.  Genocide.  Why waste the assets?  Just ignore the world, refuel at the
Gas Giant, and leave.

You know, somebody once figured out that for every 250,000 rounds of rifle
and machinegun fire directed at aircraft from the ground in WWII, one plane
was destroyed.  there were a large number of planes shot down by ground fire
during that war.  All it take is *one* spear in the *right* place.. and the
battledress equipped trooper is in trouble.  Or better yet, use longbows..
and get him in the back of the knee, or right in the visor slit, or under
the arm while the arm is raised..  throw a net over the guy, trick him into
chasing you into a trap where you can drop a 16-ton boulder on him.. Lo-tech
does not equate with stupid.  Ask the US Cavalry or the British veterans of
The Boer War about that.

As for the spear carriers breaking and running.. please read the history of
the battles of Saipan, Tarawa, and Okinawa during WWII.

Sorry about the length of this.. I felt it was better to take this all in
one post, rather than several.

That all makes sense to me.  It\'s a good rationalization.  :)

It looks to me like someone might have played some kind of joke on you by
subscribing you to a mailing list. I\'m a member of the mailing list you\'ve
been sending messages like the one above to, not an administrator of the
list, so I can\'t tell for sure. But you\'ve been replying with messages like
the one above all afternoon, so I\'m pretty sure all of the messages you\'ve
been receiving are messages posted to the mailing list.

You can unsubscribe from the list by sending mail to
majordomo@mpgn.com and putting these words in the body of the
message:

   Like others here, this is a style I prfer unfortunately the players are
pretty demanding in that they expect the GM to do everything for
them...and, as always, the players NEVER do what you expect them to.

   I tend to write up the general parameters of the scenario, along with
important NPCs (assuming the Players will totally trash any plans I make
for the adventure) and free associate the adventure from there -
frequently free-associating when I get particularly well derailed.

   One of my most memorable adventures _was_ a "story telling" adventure
GMed by a sociologist who was fascinated by RPGs and the people who played
them. He was an s/f writer and fan who knew next to nothing about gaming,
and relied on the players (3 students, and me) to keep him abreast of the
rules.

   I had a character called Saavik (No, I didn\'t generate or name this
character - the GM was also a Trekkie) who was a "General Systems
Specialist" and I soon parlayed this character into the position of being
the most adaptable and shrewd character in the group. Another character
was a Psionically active feline named (I kid you not) Gar F. Eild. 

  For a short time we also had a military character nick-named "Ironteeth"
that was (among other things) Homophobic and very violent. One time we
went into a "grotty" bar for info and Ironteeth was, err, "accosted" by a
male prostitute. As the GM put it, "At the prostitutes funeral..." ;)

Interesting thoughts.  I guess this is as good a reason as any :-), just
really hadn\'t though of the TAS as snooty.  Must be a Traveller version of
the "Adventurer\'s Club".

You could be right, but I thought the suite included on-line
documentation, data files, spreadsheet files, graphics (like deck plans),
as well as programs.  If I\'m right a lot of the stuff could be
cross-platform and *new* programs could take multiple platforms into
account.  

You said something about speaking up if software wasn\'t coming out for your
chosen platform, right?  Well, I use OS/2, others use AmigaOS or some *nix.
I\'m just trying to speak up for us.

Well, I\'m not breaking down doors, but I *am* working on Traveller software
using the Sybil (the OS/2 Delphi clone) beta.  Sybil claims it will be able
to cross-compile for Win32 and OS/2 when it\'s
released too.

I\'d *really* rather stay with Pascal (Sybil/Delphi), but Java is looking
better and better.

Drat you, Tom Ellis!  You got into the Merlin beta program and I didn\'t!
;->

I\'ll be putting Merlin on my machines at home as soon as it comes out, and
the Java support is one of the big reasons.  I much prefer Pascal to Java
as a programming language, but for cross-platform development it\'s probably
the way to go, so I\'ll have to grab Visual Builder for Java or Latte or
something and start bashing with a new language.

You work for Lotus and Lotus is owned by IBM, so you should be, at least,

So, I was wrong?  You\'re not talking data files, on-line docs, graphics,
etc?  You\'re talking about a suite of executables only?

As long as it\'ll run in WinOS2 I\'ll be satisfied, but I\'m afraid our Mac
friends and Amiga buddies won\'t.  Here\'s hoping you *are* able to make
versions for us all.

I\'m pretty comfortable using my Windows products under OS/2.  The startup
is a little slower, but they all run fine.  Of course, the Windows stuff
still gpf\'s all the time <g>, but at least they *ususlly* don\'t take the
whole system down.

Maybe, *I* misunderstood.  I thought Jo was talking about a whole range of
items from data files, to documents, to programs.  If the programs were
already in existance then they wouldn\'t be
cross-platform..probably, but the rest could be.  

I\'ll contribute OS/2 and Windows versions of the Traveller Dice Roller
program I\'ve already done if anyone is interested.  Sorry, Mac, Unix, and
Amiga buddies I don\'t have versions for you..yet. If I had a
Delphi/Sybil/RAD developer that handled JAVA I would though.  <g>

That\'s the key distinction that all these discussions of high-tech 
warfare keep hitting:  There are two major categories of war, limited 
and total.  And their methods are *very* different.

In limited war, you concern yourself with collateral damage to civilans, 
refrain from using weapons of mass destruction, follow international 
conventions regarding treatment of prisoners, and so forth.  Most of 
these considerations are aimed at (a) maintaining the "moral high 
ground," that is, having your cause approved (or at least not actively 
opposed) by the wider community of nations; and (b) not tempting your 
opponent to escalate to use of total war against *you*.

In total war, the aim is absolute destruction of as much enemy 
population, equipment, and resources as possible, with no other 
constraint.

Needless to say, a force with space superiority engaded in total war 
against a planet wins, period.  Exclamation point.  See rock-dropping 
threads for details.

> Your arguement reminds me of the Army Air Corps claim that it won WWII..
> despite evidence that the massive bombings really prolonged the war.

In what sense?  Interesting, but I\'d like to see the reasoning behind 
this statement.

> Even

As recent Gulf War revelations have shown, targeting isn\'t what it\'s
cracked up to be at TL8.  However, the 50% rate depends on the target. 
Ask the Air Force to shut down an airport, and they\'ll do it, no problem. 
Ask them to to turn a large command post to rubble, ditto.  Ask for a
precise hit on a mobile SCUD launcher the size of a moving van, things get
trickier.

> Your comment about tech superiority makes me smile and remember the parades

Here was a classic example of one side (the US) waging a (very) limited 
war, while the other side (Viet Cong, NVKD) fought a total war.  If Hanoi 
had found a stray nuke, there\'s no doubt in my mind they\'d have lobbed it 
into Saigon...or Los Angeles, given a delivery system.  Meanwhile, the US 
was hamstrung by massive restraint in type, quantity, and target of force 
applied.  Hence the low-tech win in this case.  If we\'d been willing to 
aggressively bomb every factory, supply point, road and rail junction, 
and military camp in the North, we\'d have won.  Easily.  Now, as for 
stopping it from all happening again the minute we pulled our troops out, 
that\'s a *very* different question...

See also the Jews under Roman occupation, the French under German 
occupation during WWII (which Doug alluded to), Plains Indians during the 
19th century, the Afghans during Soviet occupation...

There\'s a *lot* a low-tech, massively outgunned people can do to make life
utterly miserable for the occupying force.  And the more the occupiers
grind the people down, the more start joining the partisans.

Unless you\'re waging total war, and you want to deny the world\'s assets 
to the enemy.  In which case, shove a rock, or three, or a hundred.

The Soviets pioneered a form of air defense called "The Golden BB."  Many 
of their client states had *very* low-tech air defense weapons, from 
badly outdated SAMs all the way down to machine guns.  The Golden BB 
approach involves *filling* the air above the target with bullets, 
missiles, AAA shells, *anything*...not even making much of an attempt to 
aim, just shooting up.  With 15 tuns of junk in the air, odds are that at 
least a few planes will run into some of it.  The Iraqis used this tactic 
during the initial raids on Baghdad during the Gulf War.  As it happened, 
they didn\'t peg any planes...but they *could* have.

Now here\'s another question / thought.  

Given mustering out benefits are taken at the end of each career and go onto
the next.  Also TAS dividends provide a High passage every two months with a
value of Cr10,000.

Now the situation.

I was rolling up my first character he spent his first term in the Marines,
failed his continuance roll and got one roll on the Mustering out table.  I
roll a 6 on the Benefits Table and get TAS (of all things).  Now the
character is only 24 and going to continue in another career or more.  Does
he receive a High passage even during the creation time period.  Using
conservative figures you could sell a High passage for 25% of is face value
and have and income of Cr15,000 per year.  Over a 20 year career the
character can garner Cr300,000 in addition to any other benefits.

Any thoughts or comments?  This appears legal although unbalancing.

Even if it did get through, I missed it, too (I sometimes read the TML with

I didn\'t write the combat rules; but I think that\'s a hold-over from High
Guard, and doesn\'t really mean much in T4.  Just as an (untested)
suggestion, allow the ship to jump as soon as it accumulates enough energy
(that is, as soon as Power Plant Number times Number of Turns Charging is
greater than or equal to twice the Jump Distance in parsecs).

The "power plant number" in QSDS/T4 is just a made-up thing that
more-or-less abstractly represents the size of the plant in relation to the
size of the ship.

You\'re looking at the Military Laser Batteries.  For a cheaper weapon, take
a look at the Civilian Laser Batteries.  The main difference (other than
rate of fire), is that the "Military" batteries contain a large and
expensive Master Fire Director (expensive, complicated fire-control
equipment) that\'s probably a waste of space and money on the fighter.

Again, take a look at the civilian weapons; they\'re not as nifty as the
military ones, but they\'re cheap (down in the low single digits) and they
still do damage.

As I recall, all of the starships are valid QSDS designs, done by one or
another of the members of the GDW-Beta list (thanks!); the small craft are
at best approximations ... the small craft and vehicle design system wasn\'t
written at that point.

I\'m hard at work on a definitive errata list (well, if truth be told, not
quite _that_ hard at work), and a revised and improved design system.  I\'ll
let people know when it\'s ready.  In the meantime, the current version (1.4)

    'body' => 'Hello Lan,
  Your question regarding income kinda smacks of GM judgement call.  Since
one person\'s answer regarding Muster Out Benefits indicates that it is
wise to roll the benefits as you muster out - your reasoning is sound.  On
the other hand, if you consider the lucky "captain" in the merchant
marines who gets receipt of a ship, the logic indicates otherwise.
Consider: how is it possible that all of the "captains" benefit rolls get
the +1 for having captancy rank?  More importantly, the Captain gets
enough rolls on the benefits chart that he could conceivably get more than
one "ship" benefit.
  In the end, despite the fact that this "mythical" captain gets multiple
chances at owning a ship despite the fact that he may have been a captain
for only one term, it is likely that the "storyline" of the captain isn\'t
that he got 4 chances at owning his own ship, but that he saved enough
money to get enough money massed together to pay for the ship.  Think of
the character as winning the planetary lottery, or perhaps the character
won the money gambling, and then invested it in a ship.  Perhaps the
character\'s great uncle died and left him the ship, plus a lot of debts
that must legally be paid off...
  Were it me, having to decide upon this, I would state that the TAS
benefit came at the end of the character\'s generation.  Why?  Aside from
the fact that it presents complications that were not envisioned in the
original game rules, you could easily rationalize that the military sat on
the decision to reward the player character by some lengthly amount of
time.  I suspect you have heard tales of medals awarded pothumously by
many years, or that a man charged with some specific crime in the military
has been proven to be right some 20 years ago, and that Congress has
finally recognized that fact after 30 years - awarding his survivors some
benefit...

So, if you want to give Scouts a membership in TAS, do it.  It\'s not
especially hard to plug TAS into position 7.  Of course, you\'ll have to
decide when to let the character have the +1DM on her mustering out roll. 
The answer is to organize your scout service into ranks, they really *must*
have some sort of organizational structure after all.  <g> The structure
can be looser than the Navy\'s more like the Merchant service.

Yes, i Believe there has been a Kiwi Boot POlish Company in France for 
some years also. I understand that the origin of the Kiwi Boot Polish is 
Australian. I understand that its use spread during the two world wars 
in which Australians and New Zealanders fought alongside soldiers of 
many other nations. 
I can safely say that I used Kiwi polish Black to shine my school shoes 
when I was growng up and still use it to shine my black shoes today. And 
it still has the Kiwi on the front.

a player asks, "So, can I jump this lunar chasm, or not?" I\'m interested in

The problem is of course very complicated and interesting to think about.

to the hilt.

So he\'s playing Call of Cthulhu with a group he\'s never gamed with before.
His character is a psychotic New York cab driver (a redundancy, I know).
The other PCs have to be really careful to keep him away from weapons,
because he cheerfully admits to being somewhat "unpredictable." In the
interest of group solidarity, he\'s very helpful and doesn\'t mind if the
others search him regularly. He has a tendency to carry sticks of old
dynamite around in his coat pockets...

"Oh no no no. Heck, no. Me? I ain\'t got a thing on me, honest!"

Another PC is a stuffy English professor, who insists on constantly
correcting the cabby\'s terrible English. "There is no such word as \'ain\'t\',
you incredible cretin."

They\'re out in some woods (no doubt full of horrible, blasphemous,
unspeakable things), and they come across a big standing stone which, when
touched, gives one psychic visions of a strange, spiritual world of
intangible beings. The professor is entranced by these visions, and says he
wants to stay all night, leaning against the stone and dreaming of another
world. Everybody else wants to leave him there, go home, get some sleep;
but the cabby says, "We can\'t just leave da Professuh here. Somebody\'s
gotta stick around, keep watch over \'im."

"Okay," they say, "_You_ stay here and keep watch."

"O-oh, n-not me. Uh-I get a cold, I stay out all night. Why\'nt one a you

"Nah, we need some sleep. You\'re so concerned, you stay."

"B-but we don\'t know what\'s out there... in the woods. A-and I don\'t got a
gun or nothin\'." He\'s really sincerely giving them every chance to think
twice about this.

"Okay, take the rifle." They hand him the rifle, over his protests, and
leave him there with the professor, who\'s still dreaming of weird alien
unspeakable somethings...

After a while, the professor is jerked from his revery by the light touch
of cold metal against his forehead. The cabby is pointing the gun between
his eyes, grinning maniacally.

"Cold night, ain\'t it professuh?"

"ISN\'T."

According to the old law written by that old guy with the wild white hair,
"every action has an equal and opposite reaction".  Once you accept this,
you have to ask "what is the reactive force in a gauss weapon after the
projectile has been fired in one direction?"  Simply put, the magnetic
field "moves" the projectile down the weapon\'s barrel.  For it to do this,
the magnetic field must have some sort of "presence".  Since the projectile
has mass and resists movement, this resistance acts to push back on the
presence of the magnetic field, thereby producing the felt "recoil".  The
magnetic field cannot act to move an object in one direction without
becoming the target of the "equal and opposite" reactive force which pushes
the field (and, therefore, the field generator) in the opposite direction.

As a further example, if you let your car idle for awhile (until it idles
smoothly) and you switch on the wipers, headlights, and rear window
defrogger, you will notice a drop in engine RPM.  Without getting into the
technical mumbo-jumbo, this sudden demand for electricity will actually put
a "physical" load on the alternator (and the engine RPM will drop).

Not sure about this one... it might have something to do with how fast the
tranq rounds can handle being loaded during the weapon\'s cyclic action; or
perhaps involve the high temperatures resulting from continued autofire.
Nah!

I think early Galanglic would be more of a \'lingua terra\', based on 
English, and spoken by the educated, being the language of commerce, 
diplomacy and international government.  Many, if not most, of 
Solomani at the beginning of the Rule of Man would have spoken 
another language as their mother tongue.  As well, many of the 
planets in the rimward half of the Solomani Sphere were colonized 
differing ethnic groups - jump drive opened up a vast vista of 
possibilities not seen in centuries for groups to find space away 
from real or imagined persecution or interference.  And the Solomani 
are notorious for defending their particular way of life.  And so 
many to choose from. :)

If you mean the name itself, probably.  The person or entity under 
the name, however, could be anything.  Many Vilani and others took 
Solomani names after the First Imperium was conquered, to emulate 
their \'betters\', and a few thousand years of intermarriage has 
muddied the waters.

Actually \'Sternmetal\' seems to be a mixture of German and English.  
\'Stern\' (in German) is \'star\' (in English) and \'metal\' (in English) is 
\'Metall\' (in German).  Thus it probably would be called
	\'Sternenmetall\' in German
or
	\'Starmetal\' in English
if nothing is mixed.  And yes, I\'d say that for us native Germans it also 
sounds somewhat inspired by the german language.

Greetings from... yes, gotcha, Germany!

Gauss weapons don\'t give you much advantage with regards to recoil.  
All the accelerating of the bullet is still done in a very short 
period of time within the barrel of the weapon itself.  The Gauss 
pistol has a fairly high muzzle energy for a light pistol, so has 
greater kick.  It gun itself will be quiet, but the bullet\'s passage 
will not be silent, since the bullet is supersonic.  No muzzle flash 
though.

I\'d like to put in my two cents worth for Perl as well.  I *know* that Perl
is currently available for Unix, Mac & Windows, but I\'m not sure that all
of the above languages (except Java) are available on all the popular
platforms.

Perl has the added advantage that you can do things like write an http
server in perl that listens on your local machine and does database lookups
so you can do things like have a form that allows the user to search for a
specific piece of library data.

Sounds like most of the third world today; dirt floors, plowing by animal

>Myself, I intend to handle it as a split level

I don\'t see much as an alternative. The only other mechanism I can picture
is to have external trade done only thru the tech 10 site, making the tech
3\'s invisible to other planets. Every now and then the tech 3\'s could
generate a special cargo for the tech 10\'s to sell.

Agreement. Added complication: what about the Tech 3\'s that get comfortable
at that level and resent the Tech 10\'s attempts to raise them for their own
good?

Have fun.

     Y\'see, if they dessicate, they\'d make much better hood ornaments \'coz
they wouldn\'t thaw out every time you landed somewhere where the temp was

Its a simple matter of physics, you fling a metal dart or slug out at high
velocities, you get recoil, its a matter of kinetic energy. Nobody ever
said a gauss weapon was low recoil, they are quieter than chemical powered
slug throwers and have no muzzle flash, but they defiitely have recoil.

Though if there\'s a Mac version (Motorola 680X0 CPU) it\'s fairly easy to =

Actually, high-tech worlds will still have libraries. They may have
books on display (much like some libraries might have a sumerian clay
tablet on display) but they\'ll mostly be a bunch of computers/terminals
for public use.

Sure, you can access the data from your hotel room or from your home.
But there will still be people who can\'t afford the charges, so they\'ll
go down to the free terminals. And it\'s a lot harder to track just what
you are researching if you do it at the library (on worlds with
reasonable levels of personal freedoms, the libraries make it a point
to *not* keep records of who accessed what)

Serious suggestion here:

The CD should include file format data for all data files, so that
folks can write their *own* interfaces. As an example, if I can track
down the odd network cards required, I may be able to link my old
TRS-80 gear into my LAN. And they\'d do ok as platforms to run some data
search & display functions.

Or I may just prefer to use more modern gear to have a customized
interface.

Please keep in mind that Windows 3.1 will run on a 286. So the software
either needs to run ok in standard mode on a 286, or you need to add
"386" to the "required hardware/software" list.

Also, please include an ASCII file or files documenting data file
formats well enough for those of us with "odd" systems to be able to
access them. You\'d be amazed at what a sufficiently twisted person can
hook into a LAN...

You are assuming that "kill \'em all, let God sort \'em out" is an
acceptable solution. In which case, why did you *wait* for a guerilla
attack?

If you are trying to suppress guerilla activity, it is because you
either need the people for their production capability, or because you
are supposed to be *protecting* the non-guerillas from the guerillas.

This complicates things greatly.

Believe it or not, aside from insulation, the way you fill an LH2 tank
isn\'t that different from the way you fill any other fuel tank. You
take a cover off a fill port, insert the nozzle on the end of the hose,
and start pumping. The details of the port and nozzle may be a bit more
complicated, but not all that much. So access to the tank isn\'t much of
a problem.

As for the gizmo to drop in, that gets supplied by your high tech
allies. The OSS came up with a lot of nasties that got shipped off to
the Resistance to use for sabotaging German fuel supplies during WWII.
I\'m just following the same model. Something small, cheap and
relatively reliable that can be provided to the guerillas to help them
fight.

To put it another way, do you think the Afghans built their own Stinger
missiles?  Guerillas will have high tech aid for the things they can\'t
figure out how to sabotage on their own.

:)  Actually, I like the idea of ships that spin for gravity...Never used 
that method in Traveller, but it is appealing.  Less hand-waving 
involved. :)

Makes sense to me.  I\'m involved with a shared-world sci-fi writers/artist 
project--Tales of the Tai-Pan.  The Tai-Pan is a free merchant, has a crew of 
around twenty and is described as an \'interstellar UPS truck.\'

(However, I tried creating a USP from the MT/FFS rules--the Tai-Pan, 
streamlined wedge 400 meters long displaces 200,000 tonnes!!!  Obviously the 
Traveller universe\'s tech doesn\'t match the Tai-Pan\'s tech)

The Tai-Pan has a great advantage over her competition...salvaged MilTech 
engines.  Whoo boy can she burn for orbit.  And there are (undefined) 
advantages when she uses her Jump Drive (a _true_ jump drive--near instant 
transit to your destination, however you have to get about 50AU out before you 
can use it.  Travel time is around two weeks--one outbound, jump, one inbound)

Roleplaywise, I agree--maybe the membership papers for Lan\'s marine had been 
sitting under his C/O\'s lamp for twenty years, and _just_ as Lan\'s character 
decided to travel a bit, he got it in the mail...
...or maybe it took n-terms for the TAS to decide  (Gee, Bartholomew, I don\'t 
know.  He _was_ just a marine.  Why does the Corps keep sending these 
applications anyway?)  <grin>

Well, the article at this link is invalid.  It turns out the rate of neutrino

Eric, they charge a _MILLION_ Creddies to get in!  They _are_ a snooty bunch!  
<grin>

I suppose the real difference here would be if your Traveller universe was 
more or less class oriented.  Nobles, entertainers, \'heroic\' Marines, Naval 
officers, Agents and even a daring Rogue can get in.  As for the common Army 
soldier, Researcher, Merchant and Scout, sorry--out of luck, unless you cough 
up the cash.  And then only if nobody minds.

Hmm.. that\'s interesting.  The Rogue gets a shot at it (Fast Talk the local 
TAS??), but the rest of the folk who get dirt under thier fingernails (Army, 
Reseacher, Merchant, Scout) don\'t.

Actually, my plan was to get the hardback to keep and a softback to use up
and replace.  I had every intention of getting a softback from a FNGS ASAP
anyway.  <g>

The fact that I had to wait almost a month before ONE copy arrived in town
put a twist in my shorts, though.  BTW, when I did get my copy it wasn\'t
from that not so FNGS, it was from a comics store. The game store *still*
doesn\'t have the copies they TELL me they ordered.  (You think they could
be lying to me about ordering them? Nah! They\'d never do that would they?

Folks, not to put too strong a point on it, but "Sternmetal
Horizons" could just have easily started as "The Stern Metal
Fabrication Company", founded by Lou Stern and then later merged with
"Horizon Shipyards" to become "Sternmetal Horizons." <g>

Slightly off subject, but...  Is it true that the Afghans got hand made
20mm *rifles* from craftsmen in Pakistan.  And that they shot down a number
of helicopters with them?  Lie down on the side of mountain, balance the
rife between your feet and pop Hinds flying by.

While Sir Isaac Newton is *now* old (about four centuries), he was quite 
young when he formulated his Three Laws of Dynamics.  And, in every 
portrait of him I\'ve ever seen, his hair was immaculately coiffed in 
proper Elizabethan-upper-class style.

You wouldn\'t be thinking of some later punk kid who spoiled Sir Isaac\'s 
physics, would you? :)

Of course.  In any projectile weapon, the weapon gets pushed back as it 
pushes the projectile forward.  In a gauss weapon, as you note, the 
magnetic field mediates this momentum transfer.  In a chemical firearm, 
the expanding gas in the barrel of the weapon does so.  In a longbow, the 
physical contact between weapon and round does so.

Heck, watch a shot-putter some time.  As they release the shot, they\'re 
in a position in which they\'d fall face-forward onto the ground if they 
*didn\'t* release it.  They use the throwing of the ball to impart 
backward momentum to themselves, thus keeping their balance.

The alternator works like any AC generator, by turning a magnet inside a 
(set of) coils.  The spinning magnet induces a voltage (and hence 
current) across the coils.  Conversely, the voltage difference tugs 
backward against the magnet\'s rotation.  More action and reaction.  Ain\'t 
no free lunch. :)

Geeze, you\'re Canadian you ought to know this.  I know it\'s cold up there
and being so far north I\'m sure there\'s very little air. <wink>

I\'d say, first they:  freeze - if in the the shade or far enough out or fry
- - if close in to the sun.  Then they desiccate.

I suspect the longterm result would be pretty bad.  When the water freezes,
the cells, blood vessels, etc would break and you\'d have pretty much a bag
of pulp that would then desiccate into the
consistency of jerky.

Hum, well, to give you some scale...a WWII battleship (Missouri class)
would come in at around 8,000 tonnes, a present day big carrier would be
somewhat less then 20,000 tonnes.

Seaships are rated in "register tons" where a ton = 100 cubic feet of
volume.  A Traveller tonne (14 M^3) is approximately 500 cubic feet, so 1
traveller tonne ~ 5 register tons.

What does a supertanker rate..about 1,000,000 tons?  So, in Traveller terms
that would be 200,000 tonnes.  The Tai-Pan is equivalent size-wise to a
supertanker. <g>

Because of the size of these ships I require them to keep their CG\'s on
while on the ground...or (as is more usual) berth in a harbor. My
spaceports are usually right next to the seaports, and there is the same
feel to them.

I like that!  <G> I have ships jump *in* within 20 stellar diameters of the
local star.  They have to travel out to the interesting planets using their
maneuver drives.  To jump *out* they have to sail out to beyond 300 stellar
diameters.  So in my games the star type has a decided impact on travel.

There\'s still room for debate, though, until *their* findings are confirmed
by somebody else.

Nah, in a universe where an air-raft costs 600,000 cr a million cred is a
couple years savings!  <g> Anyway, the million is just to keep the finances
in the black.

In my universe, TAS is not as elite as you seem to make it.  It\'s more than

Here\'s one who bit the financial bullet.  Although it took three weeks.  The
supplier in this area sent back most of his shipment damaged and had to
re-order.  At least that\'s his story as confirmed by three game retailers
here in SA.  Just for the sake of the whole truth I will put the Hardbound
on a shelf and savage the softbound.  I will probably purchase the second
printing and second edition and so forth. :-)  A fool and his money???

Subject: re: Ignoble death(s)

[Here is another case of ignoble deaths,
 IMHO, the best I have ever heard.
 It comes from Mark Steuer, a friend of mine at work,
 who gave up D&D, but has not yet seen the light of GURPS,
 instead playing (I believe) RoleMaster these days.]

Mark Steuer <steuerm@nichols.com> recounts this tale:
Many years ago (back when we all were still playing D&D), I ran a game
where I pitted two groups against each other.

     Several members of Group One came up with the idea of luring Group
Two into a trap.  You remember the Hand of Vecna and the Eye of Vecna that
were artifacts in the old D&D world where if you cut off your hand (or
your eye) and replaced it with the Hand of Vecna (or the Eye) you\'d get
new awesome powers?  Well, Group One thought up "The Head of Vecna." 

     Group One spread rumors all over the countryside (even paying Bards
to spread the word about this artifact rumored to exist nearby).  They
even went so far as to get a real head and place it under some weak traps
to help with the illusion.  Unfortunately, they forgot to let ALL the
members of their group in on the secret plan (I suspect it was because
they didn\'t want the Druid to get caught and tell the enemy about this
trap of theirs, or maybe because they didn\'t want him messing with
things). 

     The Druid in group One heard about this new artifact and went off
in search of it himself (I believe to help prove himself to the party
members...)  Well, after much trial and tribulation, he found it;
deactivated (or set off) all the traps; and took his "prize" off into
the woods for examination.  He discovered that it did not radiate
magic (a well known trait of artifacts) and smiled gleefully.

     I wasn\'t really worried since he was alone and I knew that there
was no way he could CUT HIS OWN HEAD OFF.  Alas I was mistaken as the
Druid promptly summoned some carnivorous apes and instructed them to
use his own scimitar and cut his head off (and of course quickly
replacing it with the "Head of Vecna"...)

     Some time later, Group one decided to find the Druid and to check
on the trap.  They found the headless body (and the two heads) and
realized that they had erred in their plan (besides laughing at the
character who had played the Druid)...The "Head of Vecna" still had
BOTH eyes!  They corrected this mistake and reset their traps and the
"Head" for it real intended victims...

     Group Two, by this time, had heard of the powerful artifact and
decided that it bore investigating since, if true, they could use it
to destroy Group One.  After much trial and tribulation, they found
the resting place of "The Head of Vecna!"  The were particularly
impressed with the cunning traps surrounding the site (one almost
missed his save against the weakest poison known to man).  They
recovered the "Head" and made off to a safe area.

     Group Two actually CAME TO BLOWS (several rounds of fighting)
against each other argueing over WHO WOULD GET THEIR HEAD CUT OFF!
Several greedy players had to be hurt and restrained before it was
decided who would be the recipient of the great powers bestowed by the
"Head"...  The magician was selected and one of them promptly cut his
head off.  As the player was lifting "The Head of Vecna" to emplace it
on it\'s new body, another argument broke out and they spent several
minutes shouting and yelling.  Then, finally, they put the "Head" onto
the character.

   Well, of course, the "Head" simply fell off the lifeless body.  All
members of Group Two began yelling and screaming at each other (and at
me) and then, on their own, decided that they had let too much time
pass between cutting off the head of a hopeful recipient and put the
"head of Vecna" onto the body.
     SO THEY DID IT AGAIN!... [killing another PC]

     In closing, it should be said that I never even cracked a smile as
all this was going on.  After the second PC was slaughtered, I had to give
in (my side was hurting)... 

     And Group Two blamed ME for all of that...

   Java is _real_ nice for x-platform stuff, and safe too, but it just
takes too much machine to REALLY use it currently. My dx2/66 w/8MB just
barely handles the runtime (let alone the development environment) and woe
betide the user that "only" has a 386!

   Wait until the tech matures, and everybody and his brother are running
Pentium equivalents before getting too excited about this.

Cynthia wrote a program called "section.exe" which did this for the
sunbane data. Didn\'t always work, however. I ended up writing my
own version (which I called "section2.exe") for the purposes of
dividing up the sectors files so they could be processed by Galactic.
I can send you both versions as well as the sunbane (dgp) data
if you like.

For those who still haven\'t seen it, Galactic is still available
from my homepage:   http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv

And for those of you who were hoping on typing in some "official"
sectors for the program, Marc Miller still hasn\'t gotten back to
me on my question as to whether or not he\'d allow this. I was
basically hoping for an e-letter of permission, but so far, dead
silence.

While those of us involved with the design and development of this system 
(on GDW-Beta) have done playtesting, and we\'ve argued various issues out, 
it still needs to be tested on a wider scale.  It needs your scrutiny! :)

For those unfamiliar with the system, here is a brief description:

RPSC is a miniatures-based _role-playing_ ship combat system.  Every 
aspect of the system has been created with role-playing in mind.  
Character skills are more important than equipment ratings in many cases 
- - although you\'ll always get the benefit of your equipment\'s 
capabilities.  Players will role-play their character\'s actions, 
including: piloting, sensor operations, gunnery, damage control, and more!

If you are interested in such a system, or if you are just curious as to 
what we\'ve come up with, please download RPSC.  After you\'ve spent some 
with it, post your comments.  Help us make this the best space combat 
system ever developed for a role-playing game. :)

RPSC has been uploaded to Wildstar\'s web site in WordPerfect and Word 
formats.  Wildstar is also going to translate it into some other 
formats.  Once he has done so, and has made them available, he will post 
a message telling you where the files can be found on his web-site.

RPSC has been formatted to print out as a booklet, including a title page, 
credits page, and table of contents.  Just print it out double-sided, 
bind it (either by taking it to a local copy center, or by simply 
stapling the sheets together) and you\'ll have a nicely-formatted booklet, 
ready for play.

I look forward to seeing your comments about RPSC posted to the TML.


Thanks for your time,

I\'m not so sure about the origins of the National Geographic Society, but 
maybe we can explore the origins of the TAS.

I think of the TAS as a privatized combination of American Express and Hilton Hotels on 
steroids. The TAS may well have started out in the Mists of Time(tm) as a "strategic 
alliance," or perhaps a shotgun wedding, between two travel-industry megacorps -- one 
offering information and financial services and the other offering hospitality.

Does anyone have anything to add??

The US _did_ bomb the living snot out every worthwhile target in the North in late 1972. 
Operation Linebacker II in December 1972 brought the North Vietnamese to the table 
knowing that the US could blast them into the Stone Age if it so chose.

North Vietnam did this, too. Everybody and his brother had an AK, which was fired into 
the air whenever an Imperialist Air Pirate(tm) flew over.

No.
My reason can be summed up in three words: Newton\'s Third Law. The electromag 
acceleration mechanism _does not_ dampen out the reaction to the bullet going out the 
barrel of the weapon. Given that gauss weapons impart a lot of velocity to a small 
round, the energy of which is proportional to the square of the velocity, it would stand 
it reason that gauss weapons -- unless the propulsive energy is dialed down, would be 
high recoil.

Yes, the gauss is a silent, but _hard-hitting_ slugthrower, but the EPR (electromagnetic 
propelled round, as a contrast to chemically-propelled round) weapon still has to deal 
with ol\' Issac Newton.

As to your question with tranqs . . . I\'d imagine that tranq rounds, because they 
deliver a chemical, do not feed as well in automatic-weapons actions.

Hope this helps!

Hi,

My feedback on this is a big YES!!!!!

We ,out here, (who have not got T4) still must dream of other things. This
would be a great bonus and be very handy.

After reading it and playtesting it, it\'d be really nice if you could 
post any errors you find.  For example:

1)  Any typographical or layout errors
2)  Anything you feel isn\'t clearly stated or sufficiently explained
3)  Any errors of logic
etc.

Naturally, after spending 37 hours on the document in the last six days, 
there remain errors.  After spending that much time on it, there just 
HAD to be errors.  Grrr.  \'Course, that\'s why this is version 0.90. :)

The known errors include:

1)  On page two, the sentence that begins "Unless directed otherwise, 
look up the range..." should read: "Unless directed otherwise, look up 
the range at which the action is taking place by using the Range 
Description and Scale Table, then find that range in th first column of 
the Range-Based Task Difficulty Table."

2)  On page four, in the fourth paragraph under Step 1, about 1/2 way 
through, it reads "The Armor Rating for the each is simply..."  That 
should, of course, read, "The Armor Rating for each," in other words, 
delete that second "the."

There are also a few formatting errors - missing carriage returns, titles 
at the bottom of pages, etc.

Why?  Well, since we corrected all these errors at one time or another, 
the only thing we can figure out is that when Windows crashed (it crashed 
five times today, for example - and we have 32MB of RAM!), we loaded the 
wrong automatically backed up copy, getting a previous version without 
knowing it.

I apologize for this.

Rest assured that such errors will NOT be in the final copy.  The 
reason they exist at this point is simply that I wanted RPSC to be 
available today, and I knew that it was only version 0.90.  So, we didn\'t 
do a final edit.  When it comes time for version 1.0, I\'ll try very hard 
not to let such errors creep into it. :(

TAS as being a sort of National Geographic meets travel agency, it can show
you all the best sights in the universe, and help you get there with the
least fuss and most comfort.

>Isn\'t this a club for "Travellers"? Aren\'t scouts really good at that sort
>of thing?
Yes, this is true, but the type of travelling that Scout do is not like
that of normal travellers. You join the Scout service because you have an
undeniable urge to explore and adventure, where else is better to do this
than in the great "unknown of unexplored space. A retired navy admiral may
like a bit of easy R&R fishing or game hunting, but in a controlled type
environment. A Scout goes for the uncharted wilderness for his/her thrills.

The TAS has information and data on all the popular and uniquely different
planets. I figure Scouts will prefer to holiday in areas where there is
little knowledge of the area, certainly, detached Scouts from the
exploration branch do this.

Also, it is in the best interest of the Scout service that many of its
detached duty members keep exploring and adventuring. This way, the Scout
service would slowly build up a database on the unexplored regions, and
depending on the information brought back, a major exploration mission
could be launched. Therefore, the Scout service would have its own TAS type
service at each Scout base and Waystation. This would provide scouts with
information on regions were the service is wanting to expand into and would
like some information on. This information could be sold for money, fuel,
maintenance or parts. Therefore keeping up the desire for exploration
amongst the detached duty members.

I kind of envisage a Scout character entering a Scout base, checking the
bulletin board for places of interest, and then heading off into the deep,
dark unknown. On his/her return, he goes to the information centre,
undergoes a type of debrief. Depending on the type and amount of
information given, an amount of Scout-credits or vouchers are given out to
pay for things at Scout bases.

These are just my thoughts on this matter.

I know how you feel.  Me friendly store owner (I think I bought so much stuff
there that he doesn\'t have a choice but to like me) told me a friend of his
cancelled his order for a hardcopy and bought a softcover.

I wonder if the people of IG read what is going on here but if they do, they
should know by now that the hardcore traveller player are getting unhappy (and
they are supposed to court us into accepting their game!).

I feel cheated at this point and let down.  I bought the hardcover (ordered it
is more proper) with the impression I would be getting it in advance.  I am 
disappointed.  Maybe the folks at IG should come forward and explain to us what
the problem is instead of leaving us in the dark.

 One thing jumps to mind. It may be the the effect of multiple doses of
the tranquilizer on the target. One round might do the job but a three
round burst may be fatal.
 On the Pistol it might a question of barrel lenght, more energy is
required to bring the slug up to speed over the short barrel lenght, so
more felt recoil.

This makes me wonder...  are there "junk yards" in the Traveller universe?

I\'m not sure about other countries...well, really I don\'t know about
anywhere but here in the south, but anyway, down here in the south, we have
auto junk yards where cars that have been "totaled" (wrecked beyond
reasonable repair) are taken and you can go there to get the useable parts
off the car.  That is, a car that got rear ended and the back of the car
(including the axel) is crunched, is gonna have some good engine parts.  I
wonder if there is something like this in the Traveller Universe where ship
owners could go to buy used upgrades for their ship at discount prices?
Comment?

Well, I haven\'t heard about helicopters being taken out, but there were a 
number of reports about handmade rifles chambered for the 14.5x114 round 
that the Soviets used in their KPV "Machinegun" (well, small autocannon 
really).  IIRC, the mujahadeen were stealing the ammo from the Soviets and 
their Afgahn allies, but not getting it in enough quantity to waste as 
machinegun ammo.  The round in question is particularly nasty; it could 
easily blow through an engine block of a jeep or truck, and in many cases 
would punch right through the armor of a BTR or BRDM.  Kind of an ultralight 
ATR for use against light armor.  I\'ll have to root through some of my old 
"Janes"; I seem to recall that somebody from the West brought one of these 
back for analysis as a possible sniper weapon concept.

As for the Pakistani gunmakers; they had (and probably still have) an 
amazing cottage industry there making copies of any weapon you might bring 
in to them.  The interesting part was that the Afghans would bring in 
weapons made largely of stamped and machined parts, and get hand-made 
duplicates that worked as well or better than some of the originals.

As I was reminded today, this isn\'t quite accurate. Actually, the cabby

I\'ve always pictured tranq rounds as being low velocity rounds with a
reduced propellant charge.  The reduced recoil isn\'t enough to work the
action properly, hence the single shot.

Tell me about it! I ordered mine in late May! I do know, from a phone
conversation I had with a very nice woman at IG, that the reason they were
not at Gen-Con and were late was due at least in part to a printing error-a
fairly major one, I\'m told. I also have heard that the printers just
flat-out didn\'t have the books done on time. Then of course there\'s the wait
for Marc to sign umpty-odd hundred copies. I\'m sure he has other things to
do than to hang out in Lake Geneva all the time. I beleive he still lives in
the Chicago area.
        That still doesn\'t make me any less unhappy about the delay, and yes
I did buy a softcover. I was actually planning to anyway; I\'m not letting my
players get their sweaty palms on my hardcover! But I bought it when I did
because I was eager to begin playing my Year 0 campaign, and couldn\'t wait
for the hardcover.
        They\'ll arrive eventually. But if this is what we can expect from
IG\'s printer, I have some serious advice;
        Get a new printer!

I\'d basicly say that at anything under 1/10th g "running" is out of the
question, instead you do a bunch of kangaroo hops, but only if you\'ve
had lots of practice. Otherwise you move very slowly and clumsily. That
solves the "running jump" bit.

And nobody is gonna want to try jumping at more than three gees, as the
odds of breaking something are too great.

Standing broad jumps can be scaled the way you were doing it. It ain\'t
correct, but it\'ll do well enough. For high jumps, you scale it
according to gravity, but remember that what counts is not the *total*
height, but the change in height for the relevant part of the body.
That scales linearly, but you have to take the character\'s *size* into
account.

Remember my example for jumping up to grab something or jumping over
something?  It\'s not that complicated, but it does get across the truth
that you can\'t make 20 foot jumps in low gee.

Recoil depends on the mass of the weapon, the mass of the projectile,
and the muzzle velocity. Gauss weapons have a somewhat smoother recoil
because the projectile is being continuously accelerated for the full
length of the barrel. So the shorter the barrel, the worse the recoil.

As for silent, *any* supersonic projectile will *not* be silent. And
the higher the velocity, the less silent.

> Also how come most guns that fire automatic can only fire SS with tranqs.
> Any thoughts or answers would be appreciated.  

This one is easy. The mechanism on an automatic uses the recoil from
one round to load the next and cock the action. Since tranq rounds
*must* have a much lower muzzle energy (or else they\'d punch large,
ugly holes in the target) they don\'t provide enough recoil to work the
action. Same thing goes for blanks in most semi-auto rifles unless you
put a special partial plug over the end of the barrel.

One further note. As I noted, tranq rounds don\'t provide enough recoil
to work the action. The same is frequently true when using a silenced
weapon. Since you need to use sub-sonic rounds, for may have to work
the action by hand for each shot.

Also, forget about trying to silence a revolver. You can\'t get a good
enough seal between the cylinder and the barrel.

If the temp is low enough to let them freeze, they\'ll freeze. And given

        True, but we\'ve got this wonderful atmosphere plant up in Quebec
City that churns out megaliters of superheated air every legislative
session.  Admittedly, it\'s rather badly tainted air, but at least we\'ve got
the pressure problem solved that way :).

        Interesting... so you could just put\'em in a net, leave\'em hanging

Once again, just watch them try and collect the payments. Call it 
organic adventure material. In the words of Lenny Bruce: "Screw \'em. 
They can afford it!"

- --end pasted material--

The problem is banks (and the Imperium) should have already thought of this
or they\'d quickly go broke!

For the Imperium I envision that all through your training you
are--ahem--brainwashed--into thinking how nice it is that the Imperium lends
you this ship. When you muster out you sign all sorts of nice legal papers
allowing the Imperium to freeze your bank accounts (hey, they\'re the
government--they probably don\'t even need your signature!), etc., if you
don\'t return during a declared emergency.

So, unless you are of poor moral fiber to begin with, you\'ll obey the calls.
If I remember correctly, at least in Classic Trav, couldn\'t ex-Scouts always
refuel at a Imperial Scout Base? That would provide the Imperium of a way of
tracking you. If you failed to obey a summons for a major situation, they
could get you by issuing a wanted message via the Jump Boats to each world
along the jump boat routes. Then the Navy could practice interception
techniques and the Marines could have some fun doing boarding!

As for banks, I can think of many ways of screwing up your life if you fail
to make payments. I envision many banks in the Imperium as having connections
with the Imperium (like banks in the US have connections with the Federal
Reserve, etc.). If you fail to make a payment on your ship, several things
could happen. First, the next time you jump into a system that is serviced by
a X-Boat and try to draw some money from your account--your account is
frozen. The shipyard that you landed in to do repairs has locked you ship--as
salvage! Even the hotels don\'t recognize your credit cards, debit cards, cash
cards, etc. The local stormtroopers are eying you as a means to get a
promotion. The skip tracers (and other bounty hunter types) hired by the bank
are checking your face versus a list they carry.

There could be other high tech means of prevention as well. Look at cars
today--ID numbers are engraved in several areas to help trace cars when they
get stolen. A bank might install a tamper-resistent (I say resistent, as
there\'s always the good old FGMP lock remover!) device on the ship. You have
to make your payment to the bank each quarter (or other time period). If you
do not, a signal is sent out activating the device. Again, as bank branches
along the X-Boat route get notice of you being a skipper, they could start
broadcasting it in their respective systems. When you enter a system with the
active broadcast and your ship\'s code, boom! Your jump drive goes down! Or
your ship starts broadcasting a beeping noise on the IFF band that indicates
payment failure, salvage me!

Or even simpler, the device that the bank installs is like a lock on a bank
vault. Every quarter (or so) you pay the bank. The bank rep visits you and
resets the lock. If you miss a payment and he or she misses their visit, the
locks clicks and and one day--boom! No jump drive! Weird signals emanating
from your radio! Hot showers running cold, food processors spewing endless
tuna sandwiches (and leaving out the mayo), until you pay up and the clock is
reset...

If you have credit and debts, peace of mind comes with maintaining payments.
If you are a lone ship, I can think of no worse fate than always looking over
your should for that bank rep or the person from the megacorp that you
shortchanged...

Actually I\'ve GOT! the hardback! And then I lost it!

It was the most amazing thing. I was sitting in my home office, reading TML,
and bemoaning the fact that the hardback was not yet here. Then the doorbell
rang. This was strange for two reasons. First, we don\'t have a doorbell.
Second, the dogs weren\'t reacting to the noise (usually the first stage of
canine hypermode).

I answered the door. My jaw dropped in amazement. Standing on the stoop was a
man with greased-back hair, razor sharp sideburns, sunglasses and a sneer
plastered on his face.

"Elvi..." I started to say.

His hand snacked out and clamped over my mouth. "Shhh!!!" he said. "Don\'t say
a word! They might hear you!"

Quickly he explained that he wasn\'t really "him", but his clone. It seems
that E was captured by aliens some years ago and cloned. He was touring
interstellar nightclubs, fronting a group called Dred Zepplin, playing reggae
versions of Led Zepplin songs. Then he escaped and made his way to the Land
of RPGs, in the West/Central US. He\'s now working for Imperium Games (on the
sly, of course).

He handed me my two copies of the Traveller hardback. It was more than I
dreamed! Not only were all the typos fixed, but they managed to fit Starships
and the revised FF&S in the book! And in the back was a CD-ROM, readable by
both MAC and WINDOWS machines, including copies of every previously published
item for Traveller! And the (in)famous Traveller Suite--also readable by
multiple platforms!

"Than..." I started to say.

"Shhhh!" he interjected again. "Not a word, not a whisper. Enjoy. Keep the
Flame." And with that he sped off on his Imperium Games motor scooter. (After
the dust settled, I noticed that it had no wheels, nor did it touch the
ground. My watch had also stopped.)

I settled down to read the book in detail. While working my way through the
expanded Library Data, the doorbell rang again. Once again the dogs did not
bark. I went to answer it.

Two men were standing there. Both wore black--black suits, black socks, black
shirts, black shoes, black hats. There faces were shadowed. One was very tall
and wide, the other average in height and build.

"Where is it?" the large one demanded.

"Gah!" I managed to squeak out as I failed my initiative roll and his hand
grabbed me by the throat. He lifted me off the ground by several inches, not
unlike Darth V. in the first SW movie.

I managed to point towards the coffee table. The second man moved in and
scooped up both copies of the book.

"Tell no one! Trust no one! We will be watching!" the tall one shouted. He
let go of me and I fell to the floor, gasping for breath. As I fell, I
knocked the hat off the average looking man.

It was Alex Trebeck! Of Jeopardy!

He bent over, giving me a cryptic smile, scooped up his hat and jammed it
back on his head. They turned and went into their car--a black (of course)
extra-stretch limo with reflect windows. They backed out of the driveway and
sped off. Of course, when the dust settled, I noticed that their car had no
wheels.

So they warned me not to tell you. But I had to get the word out. If Elvis
delivers, hide the goods! Watch for the men in black! They are following and
they are wat

What I didn\'t know was wether the Gauss weapons had recoil suppressors or
something of this type.  I say this because I was reading in a book (I
believe \'High Energy Beam Weapons\' circa 1988) and it mentioned a military
interest in spacebased railguns (ie. Star Wars). Suppossedly it was favored
because it was reusable and had little or no affect on the satellites orbit
(thus I think little recoil).  According to the authors specs of the weapon
it didn\'t appear to have much more than an ammo pod, barrel, powersource,
and correctional thrusters.  While I realize that perhaps the thrusters were
used to negate the affect I should think this would be uneconomical.  This
system was supposed to stay up for years thus sending up repeated missions
to refuel the satellite would get quite expensive.  

To reiterate this is to confirm something a book said (should have said that
in the first place :) not my own thoughts.  Any of your thoughts?

Ps.  What about capital ship gauss cannons?  I\'ve heard talk of using
Kenetic Kill Missles . . . Imagine, the power supply of a ship that high
accelerating a KKM to speed then launching it into space.  Phase to the KKM
makes course corrections and activates its own boosters.  This I would think
would boost the damage rating and the endurance of the missle although since
I do not have FFS I cannot confirm.

I know where they were last used, not sure if they are still around.  The
casting of all the Citadel Traveller stuff was done by RAFM in Canada.
Always frustrating to me that although the figures were produced closer to
my house than the Martian Metals I couldn\'t leagally buy them in this
country because of the licencing agreements.  Of course as a good friend of
several of the RAFM and GDW staff actually getting them was never a
big problem.  For those of you who have never seen these the difference
between them an Martian metals is the difference between Wargames Foundary
figures and the worst comparable figure you could find.  They were
animated, had wonderful character and basicially just kick butt (they were
much better than the other 15mm line some of the people here have raved
about).

During the character creation process for "Marc Miller\'s Traveller," we
discovered several problems we would like you to address.  No, this "we" is
not the Imperial "we", but just my gaming group. <grin>  Okay, here they are:

1.  Does the Flight School (T4, pg. 28) endow +1 to Education to reflect the
year spent in school?  All the other "post-graduation" schools do.

2.  In T4, pg. 31 in the first merchant table, the first "skill" is listed
as -1 Dex.  Is this right, should a "benefit" ever hurt you?  This same
problem occurs on pg. 33, in the first Noble table (-1 Str) and on pg. 34 in
the first Scholar table both -1 Str and -1 Dex.  Maybe this was the
intention of the authors, but it just seems inconsistent to me.

3.  In T4, pg. 31 on the Benefits Table, in the Mustering out section on
item 6.  Is this supposed to be "Low Passage?"  Many of the other careers
have "High Passage" listed in that slot, should this be changed to "High
Passage?"

4.  During the Mustering out process, if someone rolls Traveller\'s Aid
Society twice what should happen?  I have also encountered a problem of when
a person\'s characteristic has reached maximum (F) and they have rolled to
increase it again.  I think I am going to handle it by just having them
re-roll on the table.  Am I missing something in the book that clarifies this?

5.  Small suggestion about "Injury" during the character creation process.
I\'ve begun thinking of these as "Career Crises."  This seem to capture what
is actually happening to your character.  Injury implies a lost
characteristic to me, and this is never the case.  I created a Merchant last
night, that went through the Merchant Academy with honors only be kicked out
of the Merchants during his first term.  I think this character was caught
sleeping with the daughter of a high placed corporate type, and that is why
he had to leave a promising career in the Merchants and enlist in the
Scouts.  <grin>

Still, Fred\'s excelent post inspired me to produce more silliness regarding 
the cause of the delay, so I humbly present:


The Top 10 Reasons the T4 Hardbacks Haven\'t Arrived Yet
- ----
10.  The hardbacks were shipped three months ago.  The
     Postal Service just hasn\'t gotten around to 
     delivering them.
 9.  Everyone at IG is too busy playing Traveller to
     do any shipping.
 8.  Everything in IG\'s warehouse was confiscated by TSR,
     which claims Traveller infringes on their "Role-
     Playing Games" patent.
 7.  Joe Walsh, worried that four copies of the softcover
     wasn\'t enough, broke into the IG\'s office and stole 
     all the T4 hardbacks and now is hoarding them.
 6.  IG has hired Elvis to personally deliver them, and
     he plans to do so right after he visits a few more
     Quicky Marts in Iowa.
 5.  The printing presses were infected with Virus.
 4.  There aren\'t really any T4 hardbacks.  It was all just
     a Zhodani conspiracy.
 3.  Ever alert for changing consumer demands, Ken Whitman 
     stopped the presses so he could add a 24-page chapter 
     on Drinking Establishments.
 2.  The monks hired to transcribe the manuscript are on 
     strike.

And the #1 reason the T4 hardbacks haven\'t arrived...

 1.  To avoid causing a flame war on TML, Marc Miller won\'t
     be signing the hardbacks until he\'s researched what 
     the "canon" indicates his signature should be.

Although a weapon exclusively designed to use these types of rounds would
have its recoil spring replaced with one that was much weaker, thereby
allowing the ammunition to work the action.

This doesn\'t seem to stop Hollywood from trying, however (I seem to
remember at least one silencer-toating-revolver in one movie, although I
can\'t remember which  :-)

Speculative at best.  I believe that the US Apaches are capable of
substaining a direct hit from a 23mm shell (used by the Hinds) so I don\'t
see why the same wouldn\'t be true for the Hind struck by a 20mm Anti-tank
rifle.  A lucky shot might pierce the canopy, however, but I doubt a belly
shot would do so (the pilots of the Apache sit in the equivelent of a
titanium bathtub 1" thick to guard against this type of thing).

I (when I rated the weapons) assumed that tranq rounds would
be less robust than normal rounds, and wouldn\'t feed very well in
automatic weapons.

Part of the problem is that FFS doesn\'t distinguish between muzzle energy
(which causes damage to the target) and projectile monentum (which causes
recoil) properly; energy goes as mv^2 while momentum goes as mv, so a 
low-mass high-velocity projectile like a 4mm gauss round *should* have
lower recoil for a given DV than a 9mm round, but in FFS it doesn\'t.

I don\'t know WHY but I was thinking of old Albert-buddy (please don\'t hurt
me!).  Kind of strange since I seemed to know what I was talking about
later in that particular posting.

Actually, it might have been "Yahoo Serious" in that Aussie movie a few
years ago, depicting Einstein as a young rocker type... rent it sometime

It would be possible to design the satellite with *two* railguns, firing
directly opposite each other.  With two projectiles (of the same mass)
being fired at the same time, there would be virtually no recoil.

The Citadel line was the source of my query about the possibility of new
15mm Traveller figs some time ago.  In August 1989 I ordered a BUNCH (about
20 packs) of them from RAFM - they filled the order completely but advised
me they\'d not be able to supply them for much longer.  In light of the HIGH
quality of these figs, of the fact that RAFM produced the most recent (TNE,
very nice) 25mm figs and the ships, and of the possibility that the 15mm
molds are stashed away in RAFM\'s storage closet, is there any chance that
FFE might contact them to negotiate a rerelease of the line?  If the molds
exist, it\'d be the least expensive way (for FFE and RAFM) to get a \'new\'
line of Traveller figs off the ground... and a very nice one, at that.

I sat down last night to start an article for Freelance Traveller.  It
involves outlining a bunch of explanations for UWPs which seem
contraintuitive (e.g. unbreathable atmospheres with low TL, little
rockball worlds with huge populations, etc.). Basically, I was picturing
it as a resource for those GMs suffering from imagination burnout.  I have
few questions regarding this topic: 

1) Have there been any previous articles published on this?  I\'ve
only seen "Preventing complacency in Traveller", which was an article in
(hiss! spit!) "Dragon" on how to spice up "normal" UWPs.

2) What explanations for odd UWPs have you come up with in your games?
What are your favorites from published sources?

3) Who\'s running Freelance Traveller and how do I subscribe, submit an
article, etc.?  (Yes, I know this info has been posted already, so email
me directly please and thank you).

The Martian Metal\'s miniatures were ok...  Some were very good some were,
quite frankly, awful.  The Citadel\'s were uniformly excellent.
Unfortunately, I was only able to find one local Chicagoland source for
these figures, which has long since gone out of business.

I would hope that the original moulds are around somewhere waiting for some
lead alloy to fill them...

Several of these monsters made it out, traded for Stingers in many cases.
The weapons differed depending on who made it, but they were generally
single-shot or bolt action cannon, which did sucessfully engage BRDMs at a
distance (for the military impared: a BRDM is a Soviet armored car, light on
the armor).  I have read one account of this weapon being used to drop an
older SovCopter, a Hip perhaps.

This idea has found new life as the 15mm Anti-Material Rifle.. I can\'t find
my sourcebook right now, (getting packed for a move) but as I recall, the
sabot round will reduce a Chevy engine to metal shavings.

It, and the .50cals, are far to heavy for military snipers, but have an
application with police units.

One of the best weapons I ever fired was a 1903 Springfield that a Pakistani
living here had restored.  He learned the trade from his father, who had
learned it from his father...  He explained that somebody was always
invading Afghanistan, so somebody had to be good a weapons work.  :)

Yup, but given the value of spaceships over cars, my bet is that such
yards

are owned by governments or megacorps.


Such organizations would employ salvage teams, and probably pay
freelancers

for salvaged ships and parts.

There\'ve been some complications in getting RPSC up on Wildstar\'s web

So, when Wildstar makes his announcement that they are available, 
everything should be fine (assuming no errors in transfer, no random bit 
twiddling....yeah, I\'m a worrier[G]).

Thanks for being patient with us as we get this stuff worked out.  
Shouldn\'t be long now, though.

Not the belly, James, through the overhead or sides.  They were supposedly
on the sides of mountains firing *down* into Hinds flying through the
valleys.  OC, all this is probably just an ex-urban myth.  <g>

I would expect there to be junk yards of many kinds. It would depend on 
the tech level to some extent obviously and the type of world. In my 
games there are such things as starship graveyards where hulks and 
wrecks are towed in the same way one would a car. I expect that there 
would be a big deal made of hulks just left drifting in free space or 
left abandoned in orbit. I allow for policing of this by sugesting that 
there are fines and potential imprisonment for not correctly disposing 
of hulks. Spacejunk is already an emerging problem on earth. Imagine the 
potential problems in a starfaring society that hasn\'t properly tackled 
the issue of spacejunk.

Spacecraft graveyards are also a good setting for weird adventures. I 
once had a group of players misjuump into such a graveyard to find that 
many of the ships there had been strung together like a necklace and at 
the end of the line was a B-17 bomber and an old sailing ship.

Fred,

I agree with everything you have written, some of which I hadn\'t already 
thought of. Thanks for that.  

I too can think of no worse fate than having to watch your back all the 
time and I believe I can speak for my players in that respect also. That 
is the great thing about Traveller - it is justa game and the players 
can do things that they wouldn\'t normally do in reality. Otherwise they 
may as well never even leave there homeworld. I certainly hope players 
in your campaign don\'t come back from the service, settle down with 
their high school sweetheart, get a house in the suburbs with a 
mortgage, raise 2.4 kids etc. Its fun to do things that you wouldn\'t 
normally do and you know that you just forgot it for a moment.

My players get great fun out of this kind of natural adventure material.

I must say that I also add in a bureaucracy factor into my Imperial 
government and its relations with its member worlds and colonies. This 
acts like the option one has in a flight simulator to add realism by 
reducing the instrumentation and control system efficiency from the 
ideal 100% efficiency. It is kind of a fuzzy logic things that reflects 
my own knowledge that people, groups of people in organisations, and 
institutions, aren\'t 100% efficient. It reflects the facts that there is 
almost always incomplete information when making a decision, almost 
always more than two options, and almost always more than one answer.

Incredible as it may seem to you not all places under the control of an 
empire are entirely thrilled about it and some would actively or 
passively seek to undermine its authority. I suggest you reflect on what 
happened in the history of your nation in 1776 that has made it a 
bastion of free-thinking people for many years. Do you think that Paul 
Revere was of "low moral fibre"? 

Fred, I\'m sorry I\'m not counting MAC users. It means nothing to me. 
Computers are just a tool for me. A means to an end not a religion.

And we negotiated such favorable terms when they got there!  We got to
flee the country, under fire, in disarray, abandoning lots of equipment
for them to salvage; they got to take over the South.  Somehow, I can\'t
build up much enthusiasm for the results obtained through Linebacker II et
al.

Yes, and they were more successful with it than Iraq was.  They also had 
insane numbers of highly obsolete Soviet SA/8 (I think it was) 
heat-seaking SAMs, which had to get within about 500 yards of a plane to 
get a decent tracking lock.  So they\'d launch dozens of them, more or 
less straight up, from sites about a thousand yards apart, all over the 
target area...and there was no way the US pilot could avoid flying within 
500 yards of *one* of them.

Try "Military Small Arms of the 20th Century (6th Ed)" by DBI books.  The
15mm Steyr AMR lists a penetration of 40mm armour steel (not cast-iron like
typical engine blocks) at 800m!  That far exceeds anything else I have data
on (including the 20mm Lahti, 20mm Solothurn, and .55 Boys).

Both weapons actually *are* used by military snipers, just not the type
that usually go for the softer targets like officers :-)  Its ideal purpose
is taking out sensitive enemy equipment (aircraft, fuel/supply dumps, radar
installations, communications centers, etc.) at distances up to 2km away.

I\'ve got one I\'d like to add.

4) At what point does a planet\'s hydrosphere become sufficient enought to 
earn it a black dot on the map rather than a circle?  I ask this question 
because I\'ve noticed some worlds have Hydrospheres of 2 or 3 and are 
still listed on the map with the circle not the dot.

  I\'m glad to see discussion on the list, however, please remember the
list is for discussing _Traveller_, not advocating various computer
systems over one another!
  To channel our replies to the many questions that are coming up we
will be hosting a Question and Answer section on the upcoming web-page.
There will be forms that will allow you to automatically submit questions.
In the meantime,though, you can submit your questions via e-mail to
"jo_grant@crd.lotus.com". Please put "Question for Dulinor" or "Question
for Alpha" in the title. 
  Here is the list, so far, based on previous statements and questions that
have come up recently...

- ---- Alpha Q&A ----

Q. What is Alpha?
A. Alpha is a Concept Prototype that was presented to Ken Whitman and
English distributors at EuroGenCon. The software is free but unsupported
and we can\'t guarantee upward compatabilty.

Q. Why was Alpha done?
A.  The main reason for putting together and releasing Alpha was to garner
user feedback to drive our development and release cycle of Project
Dulinor.

Q. How close is Alpha to Dulinor?
A. Alpha contains a number of modules similar to ones that may appear in
the final of Dulinor.  The code base, in most places, will be completely 
different.

- ---- Dulinor Q&A ----

Q. What is Project Dulinor?
A. "Project Dulinor" is the code name of the effort being conducted
to bring a Suite of software for support of Traveller-4 referees and
players to market.

Q. What is the Dulinor release strategy?
A.  Dulinor will be released, itself, over the course of three major milestones.
This is to ensure rapid delivery of a product (as opposed to far off promised
vapourware).

Q. What will be in the first milestone?
A. The first milestone\'s major features will be character creation and 
maintenance,
an astrogator, and a planetary map editor. It will also include the Alpha
prototype.

Q. What is the first milestone likely to be available?
A. The target release date is at OrkCon on the 1st of November. No promises
though!

Q. What about the other milestones?
A. For the other milestones we have tentative feature lists and project 
schedules
for these releases but they are not firm enough  to release. Instead we are 
releasing
the Alpha, which contains representations of most of the final feature set, for 
free and
based on your feedback we will adjust our development plans.

Q. What platforms will Dulinor be released on?
A. Dulinor is being developed with Windows 3.1, 3.11, NT and 95 as the primary
release platform.

Q. What about other platforms?
A. Upon completion and release of the first milestone we will begin looking at 
what is
required to port that over while work progresses on the second and third 
milestones.

Q. Will it contain hyper-text versions of the Traveller rules?
A. Although Alpha has placeholders for on-line rules, this was removed for 
Dulinor.
Whereas TSR can produce five rule-books on-line for a price much cheaper than
buying them separately, T4 only has one rule book in print at the moment. The 
increase
in price to the end user for including this information (mainly due to the time 
and cost
of processing it into proper HyperText and lisencing) we did not feel was 
balanced
by the benefit. When there are a larger number of T4 books in print, it may be 
different.

Q. Will the data file formats of Dulinor be made public?
A. It is our desire to publish the data formats for our software within a month 
of each
milestone release. This will depend on final lisence agreements. There is a 
small
chance (depending on work schedules) that we will also produce object-code to
read and write from these data formats. What is more likely is that we will 
accept,
validate, and distribute code produced by the hobbiest community for reading and
writing these formats. We will not be garunteeing that the format will not 
change. However
versioning information will be built into the data so differences can be 
detected.

Q. Will this be released on CD?
A. Because of the scope of the project, initial releases will almost certainly 
be on
Floppy Disk. It is desired, then, to set up a commercial web-site for sale of 
the 
software over the internet. When the final product is achieved we may consider
a release on CD. We do want to distinguish this product as a aid for referees 
rather
than a multi-media entertainment release.

    'body' => 'Hi Matthew (et al).  Here are my (not "the") answers to your questions.

======Matthew Mactyre said:==========
1.  Does the Flight School (T4, pg. 28) endow +1 to Education to reflect
the year spent in school?  All the other "post-graduation" schools do. 
=====================================

It doesn\'t say that it does, so I don\'t think so.  Intuitively, this seems
quite reasonable since the focus of the school would be quite narrow and
not lend itself to broad education.


======Matthew Mactyre said:==========
2.  In T4, pg. 31 in the first merchant table, the first "skill" is listed
as -1 Dex.  Is this right, should a "benefit" ever hurt you?  This same
problem occurs on pg. 33, in the first Noble table (-1 Str) and on pg. 34
in the first Scholar table both -1 Str and -1 Dex.  Maybe this was the
intention of the authors, but it just seems inconsistent to me. 
=====================================

In classic Traveller, they had careers which recieved -1 Soc as a "skill".
This reflected the fact that individuals in these careers tended to lose
social standing due to their criminal nature.  I think the minuses to
physicals which you see here represent the sedentary nature of these
professions.  Though I have to admit that whole table looks a little
"odd".

======Matthew Mactyre said:==========
3.  In T4, pg. 31 on the Benefits Table, in the Mustering out section on
item 6.  Is this supposed to be "Low Passage?"  Many of the other careers
have "High Passage" listed in that slot, should this be changed to "High
Passage?" 
=====================================

Not sure.  I would take it as is and assume it represents something about
merchant payoffs being lower.

======Matthew Mactyre said:==========
4.  During the Mustering out process, if someone rolls Traveller\'s Aid
Society twice what should happen?  I have also encountered a problem of
when a person\'s characteristic has reached maximum (F) and they have
rolled to increase it again.  I think I am going to handle it by just
having them re-roll on the table.  Am I missing something in the book that
clarifies this? 
=====================================

Rolling a benefit twice in this fashion leads to no further benefit in
Classic Traveller (e.g. Rolling a Scout, Lab ship or Yacht twice gives no
benefit).  I don\'t have my old books to quote that rule, but it does say
on page 24 of T4 (second column, first paragraph) regarding TAS
membership: "Only one membership per character".  Regarding stats going up
to F, again no benefit is gained for any pluses above that.  (Basically,
if you\'ve got an ability at F or you\'re rolling TAS memberships all over
the place, you deserve to lose out a bit, cuz you\'re obviously rolling
_too_ well :-) 

======Matthew Mactyre said:==========
5.  Small suggestion about "Injury" during the character creation process. 
I\'ve begun thinking of these as "Career Crises."  This seem to capture
what is actually happening to your character.  Injury implies a lost
characteristic to me, and this is never the case.  I created a Merchant
last night, that went through the Merchant Academy with honors only be
kicked out of the Merchants during his first term.  I think this character
was caught sleeping with the daughter of a high placed corporate type, and
that is why he had to leave a promising career in the Merchants and enlist
in the Scouts.  <grin>
=====================================

I like your treatment of this.  I\'ve always interpreted survival rolls
very broadly.  However, I don\'t think you should rule out injury
completely just because the character doesn\'t suffer permanent lowering of
attributes.  It could just be a serious injury from which the character
makes a full recovery.  Besides, this sort of injury can lead to
interesting roleplaying possibilities.  A character might have a
prosthetic arm (lower dex, but immune to pain and such).  Or he might
explain his already low dex as an old war wound.

Basically, I don\'t think there are as many typos as all that.  When you
see a rule or modifier which looks a little odd at first, try to think of
what the author might of had in mind before assuming its an editing error.

Hope this helps,
Charles.

        Quick question here: what is the maximum length of time that
humans can withstand high accelerations (say 10G) without grav
compensation: 

a) unaided?
b) in an acceleration couch?
c) in a grav tank?
d) in a low berth?

        I\'ve got this TL8-9 ship design I\'m working on, and I\'m just
trying to figure out how big an engine I can put in it without killing the
crew :)? 
=========================

Unaided I\'d say the highest gravity you could stand for periods of
days/weeks would be 2g.  Maybe 3g with limited movement and a lot of time
spent on acc couches.  Humans can stand pretty high g maneuvers (up to
about 8g) for periods of minutes or seconds.  Their time to
unconsciousness can be greatly increased by the use of a "squeeze suit"
(official term anyone?).  These are basically suits which inflate to
squeeze your lower extremities (and in more recent versions, upper
extremities as well) to force blood into your head.  Using those, some
individuals can stand up to 9 or 10 g for very short periods.  In
primitive navies, such systems would likely be built into Vac suits.

Not sure what you mean by a Grav Tank.  Do you mean one of those big
nasty, heavily armed grav vehicles? :-)  In the more likely event you mean
some sort of liquid suspension chamber or soemthing like that, my answer
is "good question!"  I have no idea.  Ditto for the low berths: It depends
if an individual in the low berth is frozen or not.

Doesn\'t gravitics come in at TL 8 now anyways?

I know, I was being provocative - for further information see
my little black book no.9 \'Data and Loremasters\'.  (Well
actually, it is still being revised and refined and might as
well wait now till T4 arrives in Southern England, but if
there *is* anyone still playing CT rules...!)

I\'ll be interested to see what the new T4 book says about
libraries/data access etc but is there anyone else who feels
that (much like money in the Third Imperium perhaps) this is
one area which is fairly critical to the needs of the average
Traveller player/game and yet has been sadly neglected by the
rules?

What I\'ve been trying to work out is a system whereby the
state of information access/provision/etc. for any
particular planet can be generated
given a world\'s UWP.  (Or from scratch for those who want
their libraries to exist in a vacuum!)

Would anyone find this useful or shall I save my time for
something more constructive?

I\'d like to know what are the efects of a short exposure to vacuum and what
you die for if you get a hole in the vac suit or if you are spaced.
Some movies sugest that a fast descompresion would cause your corpse to
explode due to the greater presure of blood and corpse fluids.( i think the
film was called \'zero atmosfere\' but maybe the title in spanish was bad
translated)
In other places (some Asimov\'s books) it\'s said that you die frozen
first.But if you are in a vac suit inside a starship without a functioning
life suport you may die due to asfixia faster...

I\'ve refeered CT, MT and TNE and only MT has a section explaining these
efects (1 damage point per round exposed to vacuum). I\'d like to know hou
do you handle this situations in TNE and if they are covered in T4.

That\'s the first time i write to this list i hope you\'ll have no problems
with my poor english.

With all this discussion of Traveller figures, I would recommend looking
at the range of 25mm (and I think 15mm) stuff done by Ground Zero. They are a UK
company with a US distributor. They do quite a large range of SF figures, including
marine types, civilians, and quite a large range of resin vehicles which are really
nice - ranging from small hover jeeps, through tanks, APC\'s, police cars etc, to an
impressive \'drop-ship\' (which I think would do for a 100 ton scout ship), which is
about 15 inches long. Plus \'atmospheric\' casts like computer terminals, rubbish skips,
cargo pods, etc,etc.

A recent addition to their range are troopers in \'Powered Armour\', which look
really nice.

They also do their own SF wargames rules, \'Stargrunt II\', and \'Full Thrust\', for
ground and space battles. I\'ve not read these, so I don\'t know much about them I\'m
afraid.

I haven\'t got the UK Ground Zero address with me I\'m afraid, but I can post it later,
or just look through a copy of \'Wargames Illustrated\', or \'Miniature Wargames\'.

Ground Zero stuff distributed in the US by:

GEO-HEX
2126 North Lewis
Portland
OR
97227

GEO-HEX also make nice terrain stuff, as far as I remember...

time has passed to resubmit;

In CT, Players wanted to know what capabilities came along with each skill
level.  I used Vacc Suit skill as an example;

Skill Level 0 :  Character can figure out which are the arms and which are
the legs.  Manages to hook up the plumbing with a minimal chance of messy
errors.  No meaningful repairs or maintanence possible.  Took a Vacc Suit
familiarization seminar (1 day) at the local Hilton.

Skill Level 1 :  Plumbing fixtures are recognized as the really important
aspect of comfort in a Vacc Suit that they are.  Can slap a patch on a
hole.  Arms vs. Legs are no problem at all.  Experienced at cleaning out
vacc suits in which the plumbing was hooked up by a level 0 user.  Took
the Vacc Suit course at the local Technical school (got an easy credit).

Skill Level 2 : Can hook up plumbing so well you almost don\'t notice it.
Stitching and patching is Routine.  Assigns cleaning up mistakes to level
1 newbies.  Can make a vacc suit with the proper materials and
supervision.  Minored in Vacc Suit in College.

Skill Level 3 : Plumbing can be used as a sexual aid.  Knows all the
tricks of messy clean ups (just reverse the vacuum system so...oops, sorry
Jack!).  Can make a Vacc suit with some non-standard materials.  Has a
B.S. in Vacc Suit technology.

Skill Level 4 : Plumbing can be an ecstatic experience.  Can make a vacc
suit with Improvised materials like Rubber Gloves, Glass fishbowls,
Condoms, Super Polydent, Final Net hairspray, a seltzer bottle,
reflective Duct Tape, etc. Has gone to Vacc Suit Graduate School and been
in the Vacc suit industry. 

Skill Level 5 : A true Demi-God of Vacc Suit technique.  Occassionally
hooks people up to vacc suits for a fee (Vacc Giggilo).  Teaches at Vacc
Suit University.  Can make an improvised Vacc Suit with a case of condoms
(ribbed, Lubricated), a jar of KY Jelly and several rolls of Duct Tape.
Can make you a tailored vacc suit that looks like a Gold Lamay dress.

Skill Level 6 : Vacc Suits are this person\'s Life.  There are still people
hooked up to the plumbing by this person in a comatose orgasmic state.
Runs Vacc Suit University.  Always wears a vacc suit (although you\'d never
know it) . Can improvise a Vacc Suit with One condom, One Roll of Duct
Tape, and a jar of KY Jelly.  Makes Sector-wide Fashion news with their
daring new Vacc Suit designs.


I invite others (as I did last time) to submit their favorite examples of
"What can you do with skill in...".

Tranq rounds are low energy (ie low velocity) - the idea is to do as 
little damage as possible. The rounds probably don\'t have enough recoil 
to re-cock the gun.

You could, of course, design a gun that *could* autofire tranq, but if 
you tried to fire normal rounds from it, it\'d probably blow up.

I\'ve seen those posts, and the guy is clearly full of crap.  We just need
to make sure we shout louder than him.  At the risking of spamming the
newsgroup, maybe we should take turns posting a basenote (each day) that
is entitled "IMPERIUM GAMES IS DOING JUST FINE, THANK YOU" and include
a short note about them moving and all.  After a couple weeks, we can
stop. :^)

    'body' => 'I\'ve been doing a little work here and there on the Basic Ship Combat System
in the T4 rulebook. It had the right idea, but I felt it was not as well
integrated with the T4 rules as it could\'ve been. Don\'s response to my
statements tried to explain where it was coming from, and I understand that
realism is not the issue. In fact, I wouldn\'t care about realism at all. I
just want a system that fits well with the RPG and uses the characters
skills. So, here are the fixes I\'ve come up with. As I go through, I\'l try
to explain my rationale for the changes I\'ve made.

STEP ONE: TASK FORCE ASSEMBLY
        No changes here.

STEP TWO: INITIATIVE
        Each side rolls an Average (2D) task against Tactics (those who
don\'t have Tactics use it as a 0 level skill) with the following Die Roll
Modifiers:
        +1 for each level of Leadership the task force Commander possesses
        -1 for each ship after the first in the Task Force.
The side that succeeds by the most has the Initiative for that turn.

STEP THREE: RANGE STEP
        Winner of the initiative can increase or decrease the range by one band.
Task forces cannot go beyond very long range unless they break off.

STEP FOUR: BREAK-OFF
        There are two ways a ship can break-off; by jumping out, and by
accelerating away.
        JUMPING OUT: Going to jump during a battle requires an Difficult
task roll by both the Astrogator and the Engineer. If successful, the ship
jumps out in the Pursuit phase in (Jump distance x 2 / Power Plant Rating)
turns. (Thanks to Wildstar for that idea!) If the result is less than 1, the
ship can jump out that turn.
        ACCELERATION: If a ship is at Very Long range from it\'s closest
pursuer, it can leave the battle in the Pursuit phase.

STEP FIVE: SENSOR STEP
        Sensor rolls are made using the Sensors skill and INT of the sensors
operator, with modifications for range and size. You must declare whether
you are using Active or Passive Sensors.
        The sensor ratings indicate the ranges at which the sensor can be
used; compare the rating to the Range table; this is the Short range. Add +3
range bands to determine the maximum range. (EX: A4 is a Very Short range
sensor. It\'s maximum range is Long. Anything beyond this range cannot be
detected by this sensor.)
        If a target is using Active Sensors, it is automatically detected.
        Once the target is detected, it must be LOCKED to be fired on. This
is +1 Difficulty Level easier than the detection task, and is not automatic
even if the target is Active. If attempting a target lock with Active
sensors, you get +1 Difficulty level (i.e. it gets easier, going from say
Difficult to Average.)

STEP 6: DECLARE FIRE
        Both sides declare what weapons they intend to fire, with the side
that lost the initiative declaring first. They then declare what defenses
they are employing.
Lasers not declared as firing offensively may be used to shoot incoming missles.

STEP 7: WEAPON FIRE
        All weapons fire is simultaneous, so if a weapon is destroyed, the
damage takes effect the NEXT turn, not the current one. Fire is conducted
using the Gunnery
ability of the characters manning the weapons, using the Range tables and
Size modifiers listed above. The Fire Control rating of the ship is added to
the Target Number. Spectacular successes do double damage to armor and
result in TWO rolls on the Surface Damage table if the ship has armor, or
two hits on Structure and two rolls on the Internal Explosions table if it
does not. Hits that breach the armor get only one roll on the Internal
Explosions table. Spectacular failures have no effect.

STEP 8: LAUNCH AND RECOVER VESSELS
        As per the rulebook

STEP 9: BREAKTHROUGH
        As per the rulebook

STEP 10 : PURSUIT
        Ships beginning the turn at Very Long range from their closest enemy
and who are still at that range can now leave the battle.

        Go back to step 2 and repeat until the battle is over.

The major alteration, besides using the task syetm a little more, is in the
Initiative step. Under the published system, the side that got initiative
had it for the whole fight. This way, adversaries with equal ability will
trade off now and then
while those with clear superiority will generally do better. Also, it seemed
to make more sense to use Tactics than leadership, but leadership ability is
important, thus it is used as a modifier.

Please let me know what you think of this version! I decided to post it
publically so I could get some wider feedback, and so that those who wanted
it could use it.

Yes, no sonic boom but you *still* get quite a bit of noise.

The political results sucked, but the _tactical_ ones didn\'t. Basically, the goal was to 
show the enemy that we would destroy his nation if he didn\'t negotiate. He did, but we 
were so anxious to disengage that the US made concessions. The _treaty_ didn\'t permit 
the North to take over the South; the subsequent invasion by 22 divisions of NVA in 1975 
did. The treaty allowed the US to disengage and get back the POWs.

Youch! Who needs AEGIS when you have Pack-o-SAM(tm) ;) I thought the SA-9 was the cheapo 
heat-seeker . . . .

There\'s also the fact that VN-era aircraft were much less robust in terms of taking 
damage than modern planes.

	Hi, all.  I\'ve been a lurker here for years now (long enough to smile 
when the Rock Dropping topic comes up again!), but latest talk on vacuum 
exposure has inspired me to de-lurk and ask a question that has 
been bugging me for ages:

	How long does it take for a punctured vacc suit, hull, etc., to vent 
to vacuum?  Specifically, given a certain volume of air, and a hole of a 
certain area/size, how long does it take to vent to 0 atmospheres? 

	This comes up often with my group, usually because of bullet holes 
in non-sealing vacc suits, etc.  Once or twice the _Aliens_ huge hole in 
the hull situation has come up as well.

	I have never been able to believe that the airlock in _Aliens_ could 
be open for 30 seconds without any ill effects...

	I have posed the question to some mechanical engineer friends, who 
shake their heads, tell me the problem is a very complicated fluid 
dynamics problem, depending heavily on the size and shape of the hole, 
etc etc.  No answers.

	Does anyone know of a good ballpark way of estimating this?  
A handy equation using volume and area of the hole would be ideal.  
Suggestions?

	George

Only trouble is, there are a lot of people who will read a rumor or 
spam off of Usenet off of a newsgroup, take it out of context, and 
repeat it (misquoted slightly) as the gospel...

That\'s the reason people are still falling for the Good Times virus 
after all these years...

        Or perhaps the fact that firing tranq rounds means you want the
target alive ... and an overdose of tranq from a solid automatic burst will
be just as fatal as lead.

        Here\'s a factual answered I have stored away in the bowels of my

After continuing on in the T4 rules I have some more questions:

1.  In T4 on pg. 70, the Medical Drug is listed.  What effect does it have
on a wounded person?  Does it heal 1D per wound?  In the same vein, what are
the cost of the separate drugs?  Their cost doesn\'t appear in the narrative
or tables?

2.  I would really like to see play examples, especially melee combat,
ranged combat, vehicle combat and ship combat. I come from a GURPS
background and the "Tasking" system is a bit alien to me; these examples
would serve to answer a lot of my basic questions about game mechanics.

3.  In T4 on pg. 69, the "Survey Shield" is listed, but it does not have the
weight or volume listed.  Since this piece of equipment is stowed in the
hold, that information could play an important part in determining cargo space.

The problem is that the projectile *will* have a shock wave, simply by
virtue of being supersonic. The shock wave is due to the air only being
able to get out of the way at the speed of sound. And the "crack" will
occur when the shock wave passes an observer.

A commonly asked question. Here\'s the best answer I\'ve seen, posted to the
rec.arts.sf.science newsgroup by SF writer and physicist, Geoff Landis:

Every six months this question gets asked.  Consult the sci.space FAQ;
it\'s discussed in great detail there.

Briefly, survival in vacuum is probably possible for a minute or so. 
Consciousness will go away much more rapidly than that.

 from _Bioastronautics Data Book_, Second edition, NASA SP-3006, edited
by James F. Parker and Vita R. West, 1973, in the article "Chapter 1:
Barometric Pressure," by Charles E. Billings:

page 5, (following a general discussion of low pressures and ebullism):
[on decompression to vacuum] "Some degree of consciousness will probably
be retained for 9 to 11 seconds (see chapter 2 under Hypoxia).  In rapid
sequence thereafter, paralysis will be followed by generalized
convulsions and paralysis once again.  During this time, water vapor will
form rapidly in the soft tissues and somewhat less rapidly in the venous
blood.  This evolution of water vapor will cause marked swelling of the
body to perhaps twice its normal volume unless it is restrained by a
pressure suit.  (It has been demonstrated that a properly fitted elastic
garment can entirely prevent ebullism at pressures as low as 15 mm Hg
absolute [Webb, 1969, 1970].)  Heart rate may rise initially, but will
fall rapidly thereafter.  Arterial blood pressure will also fall over a
period of 30 to 60 seconds,  while venous pressure rises due to
distention of the venous system by gas and vapor.  Venous pressure will
meet or exceed arterial pressure within one minute.  There will be
virtually no effective circulation of blood.  After an initial rush of
gas from the lungs during decompression, gas and water vapor will
continue to flow outward through the airways.  This continual evaporation
of water will cool the mouth and nose to near-freezing temperatures; the
remainder of the body will also become cooled, but more slowly.

"Cook and Bancroft (1966) reported occasional deaths of animals due to
fibrillation of the heart during the first minute of exposure to near
vacuum conditions.  Ordinarily, however, survival was the rule if
recompression occurred within about 90 seconds. ... Once heart action
ceased, death was inevitable, despite attempts at resuscitation....
[on recompression] Breathing usually began spontaneously... Neurological
problems, including blindness and other defects in vision, were common
after exposures (see problems due to evolved gas), but usually
disappeared fairly rapidly.

"It is very unlikely that a human suddenly exposed to a vacuum would have
more than 5 to 10 seconds to help himself.  If immediate help is at hand,
although one"s appearance and condition will be grave, it is reasonable
to assume that recompression to a tolerable pressure (200 mm Hg, 3.8
psia) within 60 to 90 seconds could result in survival, and possibly in
rather rapid recovery."

        They\'re called G-suits.  Apparently, fighter pilots are also taught
this particular rapid-fire grunting technique that also forces blood to the
brain...

        Ye gods no :).  The SDS document that Ross loaned me has this item
called grav tanks in lieu of gravitics at tl-8.  Apparently you put the
crew in them during accelleration.  I was just wondering what effect they
have

	Someone answered your question about vacuum, but gave you the
standard data on what happens once you reach vaccuum.  If I read you
correctly, you want to know how long it takes for the ship/vacc
suit/whatever to empty, right?  Well, I\'m no engineer, but here\'s my
(grossly oversimplified and possibly just plain wrong :-) take on it:
	Air will move out the hole at about 330 m/s (I\'m just intutively
assuming it will move at the speed of sound if not faster).
	So, take the area of the hole and multiply it by 330 for the
volume of air that will leave per second.  This means that a 1 m2 hole
will vent 330 m3 of air per second.  An entire scout courier full of air
will be gone in a little over 4 seconds.  A vacc suit with a 1 cm2
(.0001 m2) hole would vent .0330 m3 per second.  Assuming that the suit
has about .33 m3 of air volume, you\'d have about 10 secs before it emptied
(of course, that\'s not taking into account the fact that the tanks are
feeding more air in as air is leaving).
	Now, this ignores a ton of factors such as the fact that the air
will move faster as it gets thinner, and all those fluid dynamic things
your engineering buddies mentioned, but it should give a decent ballpark
figure (At least they "feel" right to me).

I have just one question on this passive versus active debate...

  Granted that certain objects are visible to the mark one visual sensor
that might not be available to the mechanical.  My main question is the
quality of the sensor data.  The average mark I visual sensor cannot "map"
the surface of Venus, whereas the radar can.  The mark I eyeball can see the
planet Venus, but can it give the speed, and relative position of the object
moving etc with enough accuracy for the purpose for which sensors are needed? 

  In short, rather than watch this "debate" go any further towards useless
debate - perhaps the concentration of what sensors do is more important.  If
active sensors can give you dimensions, mass, direction of travel, as well
as other information, and perhaps do it faster, then that is why Active
Sensors are "better" for the purpose of navigation and warfare.  On the
other hand, maybe passive sensors are better in resolution than active, but
the time it takes to get the "fix" or the value of the data is not precise
enough - well, then passive sensors will have to remain as a secondary role
sensor...

  One thing that I suspect that passive sensors should be better than active
sensors is the concept of (I think I have the right term here) "occlusion".
Have a computer "fix" all light sources in the "memory".  Then watch for
when some object moves in front of a light source.  Then, "flag" the sensor
operator\'s attention when that happens.  9 times out of 10, it will be an
asteroid or some such nonsense.  But that 10th time might be the enemy ship
attempting to sneak up on your position...

Just thinking...

 Nope!  That\'s not a question that Freelance Traveller can
 answer - at least not "Canonically".

 When I am generating my own maps, I generally say that a 3
 should be a filled in circle (or a blue dot on color maps).  A
 2 is generally an open circle/white dot.

 Freelance Traveller is not Dragon.  Repeat that to yourself
 every time you have such an obscene thought.  Freelance
 Traveller is not any other magazine.  Repeat _that_ to yourself
 whenever you start worrying whether a magazine other than
 Freelance Traveller has published an article on a subject.

T::>2) What explanations for odd UWPs have you come up with in your games?

 I never read any such explanations from published sources - and
 the ones I\'ve made up no longer sound plausible, even to me.

 Yours Truly is the Editor-in-Chief (and the entire editorial
 staff, at the moment); you can submit an article to me by
 emailing it to jeff.zeitlin@earth.execnet.com with a subject
 line that starts [FT SUB].  Also, while I can\'t claim to
 rigorously enforce them, you might want to visit the magazine
 (http://www.dragonfire.net/~FreelanceTraveller/) and check the
 submission guidelines.

T::>1.  Does the Flight School (T4, pg. 28) endow +1 to Education to reflect the

 I would rule not - the other schools are all multi-year
 schools, where general knowledge is an important component of
 the curriculum, even where the school itself is a specialty
 school (e.g., Med School).  Flight School is really just
 intensive training in matters pertaining to ship operations and
 navigation; it\'s not really broad enough IMO to warrant an
 additional +1 EDU.  I\'d rule the same way with regards to a
 Police Academy postgrading, incidentally.

T::>2.  In T4, pg. 31 in the first merchant table, the first "skill" is listed

 It does seem strange, doesn\'t it?  But consider - all three
 occupations potentially entail a large number of assignments
 where physical activity is at a minimum - and when you spend
 your time sitting at a desk, your physical training is likely
 to suffer.  These reflect that.

 Or at least, that\'s how I\'ll play it until I see something that
 indicates that it\'s Yet Another Missed Editing Error.

T::>3.  In T4, pg. 31 on the Benefits Table, in the Mustering out section on

 This one I\'m pretty sure is YAMEE.  I\'d read it as High
 Passage.

T::>4.  During the Mustering out process, if someone rolls Traveller\'s Aid

 Not that I\'m aware of.  I\'m also a "crueler" GM than you are -
 a "wasted" roll is just that - wasted.

 Not a bad alternative.  Just a "color" issue, rather than one

Welcome back, Dave! :)


> -1 Does the Imperium pay out salvage for ships that were abbandoned, 
> found and returned to them ie the Rubicon, and if so at what percentage?

IMO, it would be a judgement call by the referee as to what would be done 
about such ships.  Ships are expensive - so truly abandoned ships that 
are in working order are going to be awful rare.  Plus, if someone still 
retains legal ownership of the ship, that will be a factor.

If a ship is found which is Imperial property, /my/ Imperium wouldn\'t pay 
a single credit to the person returning it beyond perhaps the expenses 
associated with doing so.  The local branch of the Imperial government 
would probably do some intense questioning and investigation to determine 
if the people who "found" the ship might have been the cause of its being 
"lost" in the first place.

Those who find ships which belong to others (megacorps, individuals, 
whatever) may be greeted with reward money, mistrust, or anything else, 
depending on the personality of the owner.

Found ships may be turned in for scrap and/or resold and/or used by the 
finder(s), but as with automobiles, they\'d better be careful not to get 
caught doing these things to a ship they don\'t own.  However, there are 
undoubtedly underground organizations that would "file off the serial 
numbers" (so to speak) for a fee...with varying results depending on a 
variety of factors (skill of the individual(s) performing this service, 
for example).

But that\'s just in MY game.  I haven\'t seen a difinitive answer in any of 
the published material...but I don\'t own the MT/TNE stuff.


> -2 My group has a problem with the weight of the reload for the laser 
> rifle we think it is too heavy maybe a misprint?

The "reload" for a laser rifle is actually a power pack which is 
connected to the rifle by a cable.  So, the weight doesn\'t seem 
to be out of line, IMO.

Not to be a total curmudgeon, but I like the old way as well as the new.  
Without a unified task system, you get the freedom to design specific 
rules however you want.  Not that a having a task system disallows 
this... it just makes it "un-canonical." :)

Both methods have their good and bad points, as with anything.

I can see your point here.  Interestingly enough I have a friend in the
police academy who is receiving 30 college credits for his training.  Flight
School probably doesn\'t warrant a plus one for education.

I was poking around in the classic Traveller books and came across several
examples where you receive a negative modifier during the character creation
process.  I guess I would feel better if all the character types had some
sort of negative modifier during the character creation process.  Once again
my GURP\'s background rears its ugly head.

   Do you know how fast 3000m/sec is?

   Modern tank rounds are *devastating* at lower energy levels. _I_ would

   I\'m not sure this is a valid assumption - gut feeling tells me airflow
will _slow_sown_ as pressure drops, not the reverse. Air escape is fueled
by random brownian motion of the molecules within the container, and the
lower the pressure, the fewer molecules you have banging down the doors.

   As a mind experiment, picture a balloon full of air. It stands to
reason that a tighter balloon is going to spew air faster than a "loose"
balloon and as the ballon empties the airflow will slow down and
eventually stop.

   I\'m sure that the speed of sound enters into the equation, but as a
limiting factor not a "prime mover".

This sort of thing can happen with _any_ printer...since there are a
finite number of printers in any given area (a finite number capable
of doing 4c process, anyway), if you keep moving on after each
screw-up, you eventually run out of printers.

I don\'t know the exact dynamics but have always understood that 
explosive decompression occurs when a non-sealing vaccum suit is 
punctured. The pressure difference between the inside of the suit (and 
the inside of the occupant of the suit for that matter) is so great that 
the escaping atmosphere bubble would certainly quickly enlarge the 
puncture and possibly tear the suit open. A similar fate would be the 
occupants despite his/her efforts to deflate lungs and contract muscles. 
The pressurised contents of the occupants body would soon cause the body 
to explode.
Huge holes in the hull are serious also for the same reason. Again, I 
have to say I don\'t know the specific dynamics of this process, but 
should the hole in the hull not be large enough, and the surrounding 
material not durable enough, to allow the rapid escape of the 
pressurised air bubble the hole may be enlarged. A small hole in the 
hull could result in a huge hole very quickly - hence the term explosive 
decompression. A similar thing happens in aircraft flying at high 
altitude if one of the portal windows is blown out or the like.

It is common for ship entering a combat situation to decompress all 
sections of the ship to avoid possible explosive decompresion should the 
hull be breached.

I tried making one up a few years ago so I could get an idea of the 
thrust that would be generated by the explosive venting of a section of 
a ship. This was because of the actions of a few players who were 
determined that would be their plan B of escape from having their 
dead ship draged into a planet.
I\'d have to pass on a formula. sorry.

This reminds me of a bit of film I saw once. One of the most
interesting examples of "technology transfer" I ever saw, and something
for refs to keep in mind.

It showed some North Vietnamese villagers collecting pieces of downed
aircraft and melting them down to make cookware!

Consider that any culture from the Bronze age on (TL 1?) can likely do
similar "salvage" work on the remains of your high tech military gear. 

A scenario. A ship has crashed on a low tech world, and your players
have been hired to investigate the crash. Picture their reactions when
they find the natives busily converting evidence into tools and pots.
And picture the natives\' reaction when these outsiders want them to
give up all this lovely metal!

Do note that the radar maps of Venus were *not* generated by bouncing
pulses off it from Earth. The most we could do from earth is get a
rough idea of surface roughness, and determine the rotation rate. 

The radar maps came from an *orbiter*.

But those light sources are a *long* ways apart. Quick! How many
visible stars are blocked by the moon (on average)?


The odds are 30 to 1 *against* there being *any* visible stars occluded
by the moon at any given time.

Likewise, ships block *really* small areas of sky, because they are
small, and far away. Again, the odds of one blocking a source you can
detect are slim. 

There have been a few attempts to get data about asteroids by having
amatuer astronomers attempt to view occulations of stars. It\'s a major
pain to observe such, and we know where the stars are an have a fair
idea of where the asteroid ought to be.

More to the point, have the sensors look for "light" sources that move
or are interrmittent. Most will be known objects (easily filtered
ought). More will be space junk and known ships. And most of the
remainder will be sensor glitches. But you will discover new objects.
And some of them may be ships.

For those looking for a combat system that is somewhere between a fixed BSCS
and RPSC, check out the combat system that I designed/modified from RPSC:

  http://www.cs.odu.edu/~garriss/t4/sscs.htm

SSCS (Simple Space Combat System) is designed to be a space combat system
for use with PBeM Traveller games, so much of the complexity of RPSC has
been abstracted.  If you like RPSC, you\'ll be pleased to find several of
it\'s components in SSCS.

Sorry. I\'m still playing with the format, which is why many things still do
not work. The majority of the links are not even in yet! I think that I will
remove the full http address and simply reference the pages by relative
reference. This will make it easier to use offline. Also, I will rationalise
things later - for example, I plan on combining "Battleship", "Battle
Rider", "Cruiser" etc onto one page. I won\'t make one page per alphabet
letter - this will slow loading, especially when I start adding pictures -
but I will try to combine things that logically belong together.

>On a lighter note, perhaps you can tell me what the

This is a hangover from the Amiga. To get the Library Data to fit in the
Amy\'s memory, I had to create one page per item. The AREXX macro called
"GetPageAndGo" scans the current Hyperbook pages. If the page is found, it
jumps to it. If not, it loads the page first, and _then_ jumps to it.

I have left these here as a reminder to me of what I have yet to link! Yeah,
I could have made them comments, but (a) I\'m lazy and (b) if they are
visible, sooner or later I\'ll get so annoyed at them that I will complete
the links! (nice theory, anyway ;-)

	Current (1996) practice is that Loyds will pay 10% of
	ship and cargo. A friend of mine got rich this way.

	I dont think that this whould change in the Imperium.

	Of course there will be investigations, Loyds is a bank
	and have you ever seen a bank, giving money without asking
	questions ;-)

	I found something in the Double Adv. 1 "Annic Nova"  reguarding salvage
of the Annic Nova. It says," This artifact (ship) is allowed in Imperial
commerce under the salvage laws provided the ship is registered with the
Imperial authorities (typical registration fee: Cr 100,00)."
	So for any ship you may only have to reregister the ship and it yours.
I do not know what the Ruicon is or who it belongs to, but if it was an
Imperial ship, I am sure they would want it back but would have to pay
you something. 
	I am sure under salvage laws, if you find it floating around it\'s
yours. The hard part, would be proving you were not the ones who caused
it to be floating around in the first place.

if IG was to reissue _updated_ versions of the original adventures, I\'d
probably bite, even though I already own them all.  That said, here\'s what
I\'d expect in an updated CT adventure:

1) Rules compatible with T4 (obviously).  Lots of new equipment changes the
play balance of some adventures, while the task system can streamline play. 
(For example, densitometers made a hash of Twilight\'s Peak, because the
players could explore the complex first.  Well, I actually ruled that the
Ancient machinery botched their readings, so they had to go in person,
but...)

2) More artwork, especially scenes that can be shown the players.

3) Italicised descriptive passages that the referee can read to set mood.

4) Play aids in ready-to-use/photocopy format.  Maps, plans, and so on
shouldn\'t be left to the referee in a full adventure.  If combat is expected,
give serious thought to a fold-out/pull-out set of plans in 25mm scale (or
15mm, if that will be IG\'s standard, although I personally prefer 25mm).  A
nice ship counter for a new starship, maybe a front/back view of a
significant NPC (suitable for using as a \'miniature figure\'), and so on.



That said, here\'s a list of my favourite adventures:

1) Shadows: perfect for a one-shot convention-style adventure.

2) Murder on Arcturus Station: Nice little mystery. Could have used some
enhancement (see above) but useful for making players think.

3) Bellerophon: Lovely diplomatic adventure.  Could be nicely updated to
Milieu 0 - players are Imperial diplomats trying to get voluntary allegiance
from sea nomads.

   The SA-7A and SA-7B are the older man-portable SAMs. 

   The 7B is "improved", while the 7A is the version that was popular in
Vietnam.

Well, my Imperium isn\'t quite so nice. :)

If the ship belonged to the Imperial government in the first place, they 
aren\'t going to pay a finder\'s fee.

But, as I said in my post, a bank or other institutation or individual 
would treat it according to their own policies, personality, etc.  In 
other words, the Imperium has one policy, and each other entity will have 
its own policy.

That\'s just the way I play it, of course. :)

        Instead of using an "*" to mark the center, how about using a "+" to
mark the corners. Example:

          this                becomes this        instead of this

        I like it.

        Yes. I much prefer a well detailed floorplan to a blank set of black
lines

        Depends on what the subject is. A "One-of" floorplan for a single
adventure, I\'d maybe be interested in a color hardcopy, maybe $US0.25 to
$US0.50. If it\'s a generic, reuseable plan (i.e. starport office, bar, etc.)
or a common ship, I\'d be interested in a plastic-laminated version, around $US1

        Maybe.

"FIXES" TO THE BASIC SHIP COMBAT SYSTEM Ver 3.0  By Allen Shock

	I\'ve been doing a little work here and there on the Basic Ship Combat
System in the T4 rulebook. It had the right idea, but I felt it was not as
well integrated with the T4 rules as it could\'ve been.  I  want a system
that fits well with the RPG and uses the characters skills. So, here are the
fixes I\'ve come up with. 

STEP ONE: TASK FORCE ASSEMBLY
        No changes here.

STEP TWO: INITIATIVE
        Each side rolls an Average (2D) task against Tactics (those who
don\'t have Tactics use it as a 0 level skill) with the following Die Roll
Modifiers:
        +1 for each level of Leadership the task force Commander possesses
        -1 for each ship after the first in the Task Force.
The side that succeeds by the most has the Initiative for that turn.

STEP THREE: RANGE STEP
        Winner of the initiative can increase or decrease the range by one band.
Task forces cannot go beyond very long range unless they break off.

STEP FOUR: BREAK-OFF
        There are two ways a ship can break-off; by jumping out, and by
accelerating away.
        JUMPING OUT: Going to jump during a battle requires an Difficult
task roll by both the Astrogator and the Engineer. If successful, the ship
jumps out in the Pursuit phase in (Jump distance x 2 / Power Plant Rating)
turns. (Thanks to Wildstar for that idea!) If the result is less than 1, the
ship can jump out that turn.
        ACCELERATION: If a ship is at Very Long range from it\'s closest
pursuer, it can leave the battle in the Pursuit phase.

STEP FIVE: SENSOR STEP
        Sensor rolls are made using the Sensors skill and INT of the sensors
operator, with modifications for range and size. You must declare whether
you are using Active or Passive Sensors.

	SENSOR RATING           SENSOR RANGE
	0-5                     Very Short
	6-10                    Short
	11-20                   Medium
	21-40                   Long
	41-80                   Very Long

Sensors can detect ships out to their range class at no penalty. For every
class beyond that, there is a +1DM. Sensors cannot detect any object farther
than 3 range classes beyond their own. (Thus, Very Short sensors cannot
detect objects at Very Long range.)
        If a target is using Active Sensors, it is automatically detected.
        Once the target is detected, it must be LOCKED to be fired on. This
is +1
Difficulty Level easier than the detection task, and is not automatic even
if the target is Active. If attempting a target lock with Active sensors,
you get +1 Difficulty level (i.e. it gets easier, going from say Difficult
to Average.)

        RANGE TABLE     DISTANCE                       RATING
        Very Short      5 hexes (150,000 km or less)   Average (2D)
        Short           10 hexes (300,000 km)          Difficult (2.5D)
        Medium          20 hexes (600,000 km)          Formidable (3D)
        Long            40 hexes (1,200,000 km)        Staggering (3.5D)
        Very Long       80 hexes (2,400,000 km)        Impossible (4D)

The mention of "hexes" is for conversion from other TRAVELLER combat
systems, and shows how big the "range bands" are. This system does not use a
map, although one could be used to show relative positioning if the players
find this helpful.

	SIZE MODIFIERS

	HULL(d tons)    SIZE    MODIFIERS
	<1              5       -4
	1+              6       -3
	10+             7       -2
	100+            8       -1
	1000+           9        0
	10,000+        10       +1
	100,000+       11       +2
	1,000,000      12       +3



STEP 6: DECLARE FIRE
        Both sides declare what weapons they intend to fire, with the side
that lost the initiative declaring first. They then declare what defenses
they are employing.
Lasers not declared as firing offensively may be used to shoot incoming missles.

STEP 7: WEAPON FIRE
        All weapons fire is simultaneous, so if a weapon is destroyed, the
damage takes effect the NEXT turn, not the current one. Fire is conducted
using the Gunnery
ability of the characters manning the weapons, using the Range tables and
Size modifiers listed above. The Fire Control rating of the ship is added to
the Target Number. Spectacular successes do double damage to armor and
result in TWO rolls on the Surface Damage table if the ship has armor, or
two hits on Structure and two rolls on the Internal Explosions table if it
does not. Hits that breach the armor get only one roll on the Internal
Explosions table. Spectacular failures have no effect.
	Missles are handled differently than other weapons in that they don\'t hit
automatically, but must travel to their target. A missle "moves" one range
band per turn (if launched at Long range, it will be at Medium on the second
turn, etc.) and detonates when it enters the targets Range band. It could be
destroyed at any point along the way by OFFENSIVE laser fire, DEFENSIVE fire
can only occur when the missle is in the same range band as the target and
before it detonates.

STEP 8: LAUNCH AND RECOVER VESSELS
        As per the rulebook

STEP 9: BREAKTHROUGH
        As per the rulebook

STEP 10 : PURSUIT
        Ships beginning the turn at Very Long range from their closest enemy
and who are still at that range can now leave the battle.

        Go back to step 2 and repeat until the battle is over.

        The major alteration, besides using the task system a little more,
is in the Initiative step. Under the published system, the side that got
initiative had it for the whole fight. This way, adversaries with equal
ability will trade off now and then while those with clear superiority will
generally do better. Also, it seemed to make more sense to use Tactics than
leadership, but leadership ability is important, thus it is used as a modifier.

Hi all.  I have a question about computer model numbers, the answer to
which I find inobvious from the MT/T4 rules.

With regards to computers, what the heck is a /bis model.  I\'m familiar
with the term used in conjunction with modems (from the French word

THIS is why I said we ought to step on this Usenet rumor-mongering. Say Joe
Gamer goes into his favorite game store and says "Gee, I heard on the net
that Imperium Games had already gone under!" Joe Game Store owner relays
this information to Joe Distributor, who decides not to carry IG\'s stuff
anymore. He passes this stuff along to his distributor buddies, who do
likewise...get the picture?
        Anybody ever hear of an old radio children\'s show personality called
"Uncle Don"? (his real name escapes me). According to Kermit Schaeffer\'s
Bloopers and other sources, he was overheard saying "That oughtta hold the
little bastards" when he thought he was off the air. Before too long, he\'d
been blackballed and never worked in radio again (AFAIK). Except that he
never SAID it! The "blooper" on the Kermit Schaeffer album was a RECREATION
based on the rumor. The man\'s career was trashed by someone\'s rumormongering.
        I\'m not trying to be alarmist, I just know how nasty rumors can get. 
        I saw Marc Miller\'s response to the bozo on USENET (and Steve Miller
of TSR toasted him, too.) Hopefully this will take care of that guy.

Starport Official
Suitable for any size group of characters
Required skills: Demolitions or Engineering/Electronics
Required equipment: Any spacecraft

Players information:
While on a world with a class D spaceport, the 
characters are offered a job by the starport authorities. An old 
mothballed spacestation\'s orbit is beginning to decay, and there is 
considerable danger that the wreckage could hit a populated area when 
it finally comes down. The starport authorities offer the characters 
Cr50,000 to dispose of the station. They supply an orbital 
demolitions kit composed of a number of demolitions charges, and a 
large foam shield, which is deployed over the station before 
demolition to capture any debris which is thrown upwards. The shield 
and the small fragments should then burn up in the atmosphere. 

Referee\'s information:
1. The situation is as presented above.
2. When entering the station to place the demolitions charges the 
players discover that the station was being used by a group of 
smugglers as a drop off point for narcotics. The smugglers on the 
planet will be notified by proximity sensors when any ship 
approaches the station, and will send three fighters to investigate, 
which will arrive within ten minutes.
3. As in 2. but there are smugglers actually on the space station 
when the players arrive. They will try to ambush the players and 
drive them off. 
4. The space station which the players approach looks nothing like 
the one in the technical information they have been given. A number 
of large hydroponics gardens fan out from a enlarged residential 
area. The station has been taken over by a community of squatters. Of 
course, the station\'s orbit is still decaying, and the players will 
have to either persuade the station community to organise an 
evacuation, or try to tow the station into a stable orbit (dangerous 
as the structural strength of the station may have been compromised 
by the settler\'s additions)
5. When opened up, the station is found to contain hundreds of large 
purple drums with hazard markings on them. The authorities have no 
idea how they got there. They can eventually be traced to a small
company/government on the planet.  The players will need to find out 
if they have to be removed before the destruction of the station 
(nerve gas which would dissapate in the upper atmosphere is not a 
problem, radioactive waste might be). If any players try opening a 
container to find out what is inside, then perhaps a biological agent 
might be released, which would make tracking down the people who 
dumped the barrels in the station even more time sensitive.
6. Instead of demolishing the station, the authorities request that 
the characters tow it into a higher graveyard orbit, among several 
dozen other rotting hulks of stations and SDBs. In reality, the 
starport officials are part of a group of privateers, who will try to 
capture the players\' ship, ambushing them in the graveyard.

Now that I\'ve finally got T4, I\'m working on some slightly longer 
adventures, which should appear in a week or so.

The /bis models date back to CT and it stands for \'built in storage\'. 
Essentially these models had only one memory space, no separate storage 
space.  I won\'t go on about how brain dead Traveller computers are in 
general...this laptop I am on right now has more power than a model 2/bis ;)

Hmmm... I\'ve always had the Imperial government pay a salvage fee of 10% of
the ship\'s worth.  This allows them to recover lost ships and serves as an
impetus for entrepreneurial types to recover lost and damaged ships at
little or no cost to the Imperium.  In my game Imperial officers are hardly
ever incompetent and investigate thoroughly salvage ships.  Woe be the
person who attempts to sell a ship they had pirated as salvage or who
attempts to use an Imperial Ship on a finders keepers basis.

I\'ve been yapping with Marc Miller these past few days about whether
or not he\'d grant permission for traveller fans to incorporate official
sectors into Galactic or other sector-viewing freeware. I let him know
that four people on the TML were already hard at work on a few sectors:

Dakin Burdick (burdickd@hamlet.ucs.indiana.edu): Magyar Sector
Stu Dollar (sdollar@goodnet.com): Dk. Nebula, Diaspora, Dagudashaag
J.D. Burdick (JD.Burdick@t-online.de): Fornast
Michel Boucher (alsandor@netcom.ca): Beyond, Vanguard Reaches

El Marc did spaketh:
"OK. You have permission to include that subsector data with the
appropriate disclaimers and acknowledgements."

I went on to ask:
Great. Will you extend this to "official" sector data in general,
so I don\'t need to ask your permission every time somebody wants to
type in another Traveller sector?

So far, he hasn\'t responded, but I\'m encouraged enough by his initial
email to put out this "Call for Sectors" as it were. I\'m guessing that
there are a lot of you out there who have been working on various
sectors and world write-ups, either for the official setting or for
a completely homebrew galaxy. If _you_ are such a person, and you\'d
like your work to appear in the next release of Galactic, then please
send me email letting me know.

I\'ve currently got a bit of work to do on the program, so even if
you\'re only halfway done, there\'s still time to get your work in.
But please contact me so that I can put you on the list of who\'s
doing what, just so that two people don\'t end up sending me different
versions of the same sector for the same era.

Later...   jimv@empirenet.com

PS: For those who haven\'t yet seen Galactic, it can be downloaded
from my homepage... http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv

PPS: I\'m also working on an archive concerning Traveller and the
copyright issues. So far, the archive is pretty light on the legal-speak.
It\'s more a collection of articles dealing w/ GDW\'s & IG\'s policy, along
with some speculation from TMLers and some additional files showing
major transition points in the lives of the two companies as pertains
to the Traveller RPG. I\'ll try to get this initial version of the archive
finalized enough to distribute once I hear back from Marc about my
question regarding the use of official sector data in sector-mapping
freeware. If anyone wants a copy of the archive, I can send you a
uuencoded/pkziped version along w/ instructions on how to deal with it
if you need any help.

Lets try not to repeat anything shall we?

Heinlien, Robert A. "Methuselah\'s Children", "The Menace From Earth",
"Moon is a Harsh Mistress" (Rock Dropping!), "Green Hills of Earth",
"Spaceman Jones", etc.

Zelazny, Roger  "Flare" (Co-authored with ??? - can\'t remember), "Coils"

Weber, David  "Insurrection" (one of two, can\'t remember the other) and
the Honor Harrington series.

Cherryh, C.J.  "Cyteen" Parts I-III, "Downbelow Station", "Heavy Time"

Asimov, Issac  Robot Series ("I, Robot"), Many Others

Drake, David  "Hammers Slammers" and related materials (flame bait:
he\'s never written anything as good as the Hammer\'s Slammers series
IMNSHO)

Gibson, William  "Neuromancer", "Mona Lisa Overdrive", et al (he\'s got a

Frank, Herbert  "Dune" (I wasn\'t as impressed with the others in the Dune

I\'m sure the folks working on various "rail gun" designs would be
surprised to hear this. 

There are two types of "electromagnetic guns".

First is the "coil gun" which is essenmtially a linear accelerator or
linear electric motor. it has limits due to requiring a magnetic
projecctile, and switching current between sections of the coil in
synch with the projectile. Even so, I think a searcch of the literature
will show velocities a lot higher than 3000 m/s.

Second is the rail gun, which is much simpler. It uses a steady
magnetic field, and a pair of conductive "rails". The projectile
completes the conductive path between the rails and the current flow
reacts with the magnetic field to push the projectile down the rails at
a constant, *high* acceleration. Railguns are producing velocities more
like 6,000-10,000 m/s. 

The problem is that high velocity prohectiles will slow down rapidly in
air. The lighter the projectile the faster the speed drops. On the
other hand, at these speeds they\'ve gone quite a ways before the speed
drops.

There\'s a *vast* body of "admiralty law" that deals with this sort of
thing. If you come across a ship on the high seas, with no crew aboard,
and you board it and bring it to port, if the original owners want it,
they have to pay you salvage fees that are set by law unless you you
are willing to accept something less. And as I recall, the fees start
at 10% of the value and go up. Heck, you can get a major fee just for
towing a disabled vessel.

This body of law will *not* get left behind when we go into space. And
it fits spacecraft a lot better than the rules for aircraft do.

Besides the mandated fees for salvaging an "abandoned" or "disabled"
vessel, there are also rules about how long you retain the claim to
things like sunken ships. These would likely get extended to "lost"
ships. And As I recall it\'s something like 20 or 30 years. After that,
if you locate it, the original owners can go piss up a rope. 

ps. if you want to look this up, it will not be under the laws of your
country, it\'s one of the many forms of international law. Ask the
librarians about "Admiralty law" and "salvage".

Now I see what the problem is: your Imperium is logical. :)

Seriously, what you\'re doing here makes a lot of sense, and it works 
IRL.  The one (and only one) time this came up in my game, I played it as 
I described it.  \'course, since my Imperium is a vast beauracracy (in the 
1100\'s, that is), something entirely different might happen the next time 
a similar circumstance occurs - given that the PC\'s would be dealing with 
different beaurocrats in a different jurisdiction. :)

Your method, as I said, works well, and is a better rule-of-thumb for the 
referees.

Yeah, but can your laptop calculate jump vectors, target MFDs and maneuver a one

Whilst I don\'t disagree with what Michael is saying, I feel that a 
couple of small corrections are in order.

The insurance /salvage market which he refers to is Lloyds not Loyds. 
It was named after a coffee house where maritime trade was carried 
out in London.

It is not a bank - it has no connection with the British bank Lloyds. 
What it actually is is a complex group of syndicates of (usually) 
wealthy people who underwrite insurance companies. Many have lost a 
lot of money there in recent years  - these are the people who underwrite 
the risks for the insurance companies. The terms Lloyds operates under
mean that these risks are technically unlimited - an underwriters house 
and all other property is on the line if their syndicate backs too many bad 
risks.(Mind you before we get too sympathetic to these people they can 
also make a lot of money when disasters don\'t happen).

Larry Hadley said:

One of the ship losses went like this: the targeted ship did not have the
close-in weapons system fitted, but another did. This second ship was
performing overwatch for the squadron. It detected the missile and locked
on, but then its line-of-sight was blocked as the targetted ship moved into
the way. Seconds later, the targetted ship was hit by the incoming missile.

Was this the Sheffield incident, or one of the other ships?

Two lessons from the war (among others!) were (1) ensure that each ship has
its own defences; and (2) don\'t build superstructures from aluminum alloys -
the metal _burns_.

3.   NICE PC\'s

Glenn Grant said:

>*survived*. Ludicrous.

Hmm. I still think that the PC\'s are meant to be "heroes". I don\'t want to
set them up for a "Die Hard" scenario and have it turn out as "Die Quickly".
What\'s the point? I have seen scenarios where a (badly wounded) high-level
AD&D fighter made the decision to jump from a 200-ft cliff rather than face
the 20 stone giants coming for him - he survived, but just barely. No, I
*don\'t* want the same thing happening in Trav, I want it to be more
realistic - but it is still a *game*, and people are there to have *fun*!
The system needs to be "realistically playable", if you see what I mean.

Not all of our games are "tongue-in cheek", but:

...the funniest thing that happened in our Trav game was when the PC\'s had
just rescued Sergei Oberlindes from Ruie ("Rescue on Ruie"). They were
rewarded with a Subsidised Merchant, and stayed at Ruie (well, in orbit
above Ruie) to do some trading. Now, one of the PC\'s was a Pirate character.
Being a good pirate, he decided to rip off the ship and space the others. To
this end, he hired a number of theatre groups to create fake cabins (like
partitioned crates), which he placed inside the _cargo hold_ before the
group arrived back. When the PC\'s arrived, he went on ahead to "ready the
ship for departure". In reality, he climbed up to another deck. While the
PC\'s were admiring the new "rooms", the pirate activated a program that
switched off grav in the hold, opened the rear doors, and switched grav on
again - but with "down" pointing out of the doors. The entire theatre set -
with the PC\'s inside - gently fell out the back of the merchant!

Fortunately, the PC\'s were still wearing their vacc suits/cbt armour/battldress.

The pirate was laughing so much he nearly missed the explosion aboard his
ship! He forgot that one of the other PC\'s, a paranoid Demolition-6 ("it is
a beum") noble, mined the engines of *every* ship he ever boarded - "just in
case". While floating around in the "crates" (Zero G Env-0, sorry!) he
managed to find the button for his precious "beums" and set them off!

(Two, totally-independent, absolutely unrelated, simultaneous double-crosses!)

Ah, me. The Droyne didn\'t worry - they just teleported back to the ship and
booby-trapped the flight console (which later blew up the pirate), nudged
the now-defunct ship into a decaying orbit with the ship\'s boat, and rescued
the other orbital PC\'s. The ship went on to crash into the Ruie-equivalent
of Fort Lauderdale (or something equivalent in size, I had just seen _Flight
of the Navigator_), causing Ruie to become very xenophobic and be declared a
Red Zone two full years before the 5FW broke out!!

The two Droyne (Ervmisbe and Realtelsupremo) are still running around
(currently aboard a ghost ship in the Abyss), while the "Beum Squad" are
trying to steal the ultimate bomb from Darrian (they plan on setting off
Sol, preferably while two particular Droyne are sauntering down the steps of
the Ritz dressed in top hat, white tie, gold jockstrap and tails).

...But that\'s another story.

4.   IMPERIAL CREDIT CARD

Mark Ayers asked about cash and credit cards. This will eventually make its
way to my Library Data pages, but the short answer is that both are
available. Cash is in polymer notes made up of multi-colour plastic threads
melded together thru heat and then sliced into almost unforgeable currency.
Cards are "smart", containg the users DNA and so on for ID. These are
generally accepted, but discrepancies can takes weeks to months to clear up,
depending on the distance to the sector capital (ie. message travel time).

It probably could to be honest, a P133 has lots of cycles to spare.  Not
knowing the \'realities\' of caculating a jump I couldn\'t say, but as for
coming up with targeting solutions or interfacing with process contol
systems to maneuver a starship, sure could.

And its alot smaller than a multi ton CT computer.

I do NOT want to revive the computer thread, all I will say is that
computers in my Imperium have more power than stock CT models.

Logical yes, but not with unlimited resources.  With the Vargr, Zhodani and 
Aslani surrounding the Spinward Marches, the Imperium cannot devote massive 
amounts of men and ships to track down every pirate or criminal.  I\'ve 
always thought of the Spinward Marches as being a frontier with all the 
potential such a vast frontier can bring.

The Imperium in my game also is a ponderous bureaucracy, but there is more 
than a hint of a meritocracy in the Navy and other services.  Just look at 
the character creation process.  However, like all games each circumstance 
must be handled on a case by case basis.  BTW:    What is IRL?

Thanks, I\'m sure that our game mastering styles are based on our own 
experience.  I come from a military background, and spent four years in the 
Navy.  I\'m sure this has both colored and skewed my view of the universe.

Computers in my Imperium are ubiquitous, powerful devices that range in
size from the near microscopic, special purpose processors, to massive,
parallel systems. Ships computers are actually a myriad or sub processors,
linked together in multi gigabit or terabit networks.  There is generally
alot of redundancy (hence a computer taking a hit in combat and suffering
a reduced rating, not a total failure).

In game terms, the computer rating (1,2, etc.) in my games is used along
with other factors (existing software, operator skill, etc) to calculate
DM\'s for various ship operations (targeting, navigation,etc). Storage
space is generally not an issue, but there are limits in place to stop
overzealous programmers from trying to code a +10 targeting program into a
model 1 ;)

That\'s the way I play it as well (Marches having a frontier feel), and it 
is probably the biggest reason we stuck with the Marches after Solomani 
Rim and the other sectors (by DGP and others) came out.  It\'s exciting in 
a way that appealed to my group.

I agree with your view of certain organizations being meritocracies in 
the Imperium.  I try not to make the universe a homogeneous place at all 
- - lots of different things makes it more fun. :)

IRL = In Real Life, BTW.

Yeah, but then I saw the fool\'s responses.  To say the least, he certainly does 
not seem to be constrained by logic or reality.  Still, I\'m glad Ken and Marc 
sounded off. Since somebody suggested we take turns explaining reality in the 
news group, I\'ll post a response tonight if the stupidity continues.

One very suspiscious thing:  We had Marc Miller, Steve Miller and Peter Miller 
all posting a defense of Imperium Games.  What is this; are they related?  Are 
the Millers like the Carradine or Baldwin  family of the gaming industry?  I 
sense some deep-rooted plot.  Maybe this is how Marc is going to sign all of 
the harbacks without having his hand permanently cramp up into a ball.

Not knowing about this alternation idea, I posted a review of Traveller 
(at the suggestion of a TMLer who frequents r.g.f.m) and a response to 
one of the more level-headed objectors.  Hope I didn\'t throw a monkey 
wrench into the plan. :(

I noticed the overabundance of Millers as well.  It is certainly 
suspicious.  I was thinking the latter two might be very-transparent 
pseudonyms.  But your theory sounds more plausible. ;)

Mr. Berry is correct.  I Saudi Arabia (less than 2 km away from Kuwait,
circa early Feb.1991, I was with a few STA (Surveillance, Target,
Aquisition- i.e. Marine snipers), putting rounds downrange, more often than
not into Iraqi troops and equipment.  The big guns are heavy, but they are
man portable, given a soldier/Marine in excellent physical condition.  Heck,
the Brit. Royal Marines carried some heavy stuff during their march across
the Falklands (I immagine the Paras and other Army personnel carried heavy
stuff, too, but I haven\'t talked to any of those guys).

About 6,710 mph, or mach 8.8 (yes Virgina, there will be a sonic crack with

As a comparison:

M-16A2 (5.56mm assult rifle, USA)  945m/sec
AKM  (7.62mmS assult rifle, USSR)  715m/sec
FN-FAL (7.62mm assult rifle, Belgium) 823m/sec
UZI (9mmP submachine gun, Israel)  400m/sec

3000m/sec would almost be overkill against personal armor; not to mention
what happens when it hits bone...

 Has it occured to anyone else that the person who captured this ship
would just clear all the identifications on it, and sell it to someone ?

 On a related note, how much would used ships go for in the traveller

Here\'s something to take away your speculation...I\'m that Peter Miller!!!  I
read the posts, and, seeing this idiot start to slag off on IG and
Traveller, including specific office personnel, I decided to get involved,
telling him of how great I thought IG has been, and they have!  THey\'re the
best company I\'ve ever dealt with. 

The only mistake I see, was not announcing their move on their web page,
but, then again, they never promised to.  Any serious Traveller fan should
be subscribed to this list anyway and therefore would have known!

Contrary to many "SF" movies, and even more books, bodies don\'t explode under
a mere 1 atmosphere of pressure differential.  Open your mouth, keep
screaming (to empty your lungs), and don\'t hold back any farts, and reach an
air supply within 10-40 seconds (depending on your lysical condition).  Oh
yes, and close your eyes to prevent them freezing open.

Someone posted a really nice description based on NASA data last week.  Refer
to that for more details.

Actually, under existing salvage laws the owners are required to pay you a
settlement (determined by a court - in Britain I believe the Admiralty
Court).  If they don\'t pay, the vessel is your\'s.

Seriously, I\'m glad people are taking on that nattering nabob of 
negativism over on r.g.f.m.  But, I worry that the person who said that 
all the attention will just make it worse. :(

	The file originated from the above person, but was still a long way from
being a complete sheet. I have added some calculations and i suggest you
study the outline before trying to do some creations.
	You only fill in the blue cells with the red outline. Some of them will
need some exact spelling. The green areas in the tables are my own input
suggestions.
	Sensors, weapons, facilities you will have to fill in manually because of
the stupid table configuration...

contained  within the body by the surrounding atmospheric pressure. Our 
bodies are unique in the since that the muscles are tuned to hold our 
organs etc together under the pressure of earth atmosphere, just as our 
muscles are tuned to be able hold ourselves erect under the pull of 
earth gravity. Put a human body in a different pressure or gravitational 
environment and we don\'t simply adjust. For example, when one gets into 
heated pool one immediately feels the pressure of the heated water 
around our bodies pressing on our abdomen. Suppose there was no pressure 
at all surrounding our bodies, the pressure inside our abdomenal cavity 
and inside our skull, and inside our heart would be significantly 
greater than the zero pressure outside our bodies. Since our bodies, as 
I have said, are not designed to contain such a pressure difference, 
something has to give. If the pressure change is instantaneous the 
effect is more dramatic. 
Even more gradual changes in pressure can be dangerous. When diving 
crews move from depths underwater to the surface they have to make a 
gradual adjustment to the pressure difference in a decompression 
chamber. If they rush this process it would result in the conditions 
mentioned by a previous post on this list, to which I am responding. But 
that is an adjust from a situation where the outside pressure is greater 
than the internal pressure to a normal situation. The body is never in 
the dangerous position of having less than normal pressure outside the 
body.
I hope I have made it clear enough for people that getting bullet holes 
in ones suit in a decompressed environment is pretty much the ball-game 
unless one is able to patch it quickly.

According to the formula that Dv^.43-1 converts to the damage rating of
T4, a Gauss submachinegun created with FF&S, converted into GUNS GUNS GUNS
DV of 26.something, with a round weight of 1.54 grams and a muzzel
velocity of 3000 meters per second, created at TL 12 will only do 3 dice
of damage.  When compared with the Super Magnum pistol, which also does 3
dice damage, I don\'t see too much difference between the two weapon
types...

Heinlein juveniles also get my vote and are VERY Travelleresque.
(Some wit once said the Golden Age of Science Fiction was about 14...)

I strongly recommend Poul Anderson\'s stories of the Polesotechnic 
League and, later in the same history, of the Terran Empire.  Very 
Travelleresque in architecture, and GREAT aliens -- both exotic and
believable.  

I also recommend the "Sector General" stories of James White, for the

[Raises hand wildly] "I do! I do"

I\'m preparing a document on adapting NetRunner the CCG to a traveller
intrusion function.

I do not advocate Turning traveller into Cyberpunk, but direct connections
from the brain to a computer seem as important a sci-fi concept to me as
Jump Drive.

Most citizens of Glisten (TL 15, Asteroid world) have a "Jack" for
accomplishing routine tasks that can interupt the connection from the
brain to the senses and body and substitute "virtual" experiences and
perceptions.

The addition of artifical memory or enhanced eyes or ears (or just signal
processors between normal senses and the brain) seems a genuinely small
step from there.  In fact, devices such as "miracle ear" are primitive
versions of this.

Let me know if there is any interest in expanding on these rules.

P.S.  I think the Virus would make any such implants extremely dangerous.
There is no Virus as published in my campaign.

   I have some players that love shadowrun, so yes I do occaxionally allow
it. You have to be careful, though, because I don\'t believe the Traveller
"feel" takes this too well.

   It can work if you justify it right, though.

I think your figure is excellent provided that the pressure in the cabin
doesn\'t change very much. It stops working so well closer to vacuum.

If you assume an ideal gas of constant temperature with no impedence
inside the ship (not a bad assumption close to vacuum), the
formula for the pressure reduction is:

P(t) = P0 * exp(-t * u*A/V )

where P(t) is the pressure as a function of time, P0 is the initial
pressure in the ship, t is the time since the hull breach in seconds,
A is the surface area of the hole in square meters, V is the volume of
air in the ship in cubic meters, and u is a constant depending on the
kind of gas and the temperature:

u = 160 sqrt(T/m)

where T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin of the gas (room temperature
is about 300 Kelvin) and m is the molecular number of the gas (Oxygen
has m=32, Nitrogen has m=28). So air at 300 Kelvin has around u = 500 m/s.

So a cabin with 500 cubic meters (about that of the old CT scout
courier\'s) of air (m = about 30) at 300 Kelvin with a one-square-meter
hole punched thru it will be down to half of its initial atmosphere in
about 0.7 seconds. About 0.7 seconds after that, it will down to one
quarter of the initial pressure, then one eighth, one sixteenth, etc.

Granted, the ideal gas and constant temperature approximation are very
crude, but this may be better than nothing at all.

PS ---- The formula for the half life of the atmosphere may be more
useful than the formula I gave above. It is:

Half life (in seconds) = 0.7 * u * A / V

More than once. The most memorable was a PC, clad in battledress, who ran into a

victim, horsed him on his shoulder and jogged out through the fight.  Of course,
poor ol\' Kilpatient was utterly riddled by the time they reached safety...

Actually, no, but more through luck than judgement.

Divine retribution? <g>

It all depends on the characters - and the players. From a character POV, if the
killing is widely OOC then I\'d have a moan about innacurate portrayal; on the
other hand if the players start getting uptight then I\'ll step in to try and
calm things. But I wouldn\'t level retribution on players simply because the
character they killed was a PC.

That said, I wouldn\'t like it to happen every week...

Is there a 3G3 conversion for T4 yet?  I know Greg Porter promised one..

The difference is that the 4mm dart is going to fly much farther that the
blunt .357M round travelling at ~350m/sec.  Also, since the gauss ammo
weighs 1/8th one magnum round, I can fire more than you.

    'body' => 'Hello list,
  I have been trying to discover the formula used for creating the hulls
in QSDS and in T4.  As yet, I am unable to do so.  Also, I would like to
know why certain hulls listed in T4 have an armor rating of 0 as compared
with others.
  In some cases, the Max G rating listed for one hull type (such as
cylinder) at one volume level as being a max of 4, while a slightly larger
version of that same hull type is listed as only being a 2.  Specifically
speaking - the 200 ton version versus the 600 ton version.  Why does an
open frame structure ship of 2000 tons have the exact same structural
value as the 400 ton unstreamlined wedge hull?

  In short, examining the values printed in T4 seem to indicate that the
ship building rules does not work in T4 - at least to me.  My initial love
affair with T4 is rapidly cooling in light of what seems to be typesetting
errors, as well as developement errors.  

  Could someone on this list help salvage a potential customer for IG?  At
this point, I suspect that I am rapidly becoming discouraged with T4 and
any supporting materials that may come out in the future.  If it doesn\'t
make sense, I generally either "fix" the system with homebrewed fixes, or
I drop the system entirely.  Since I don\'t understand the formulas - as in
I can\'t even see that they exist, I can\'t "fix" the system.  As for
dropping it, I would be sorry to see it happen, since I have a strong
enjoyment of CT from years gone by...

One last note:
  It is my hope that the Naval Architect\'s Handbook does away with the
"ablative" effect of armor in T4.  A well armored ship should be able to
withstand battering from lesser energy weapons.  On the other hand, a
small ship should not be able to generate an armor rating that competes
with Dreadnaughts!  Setting it up such that armor has a numerical level,
and that weapons have to overcome that numerical level or be "ineffective"
would seem to be the most "realistic" path to follow.  In short, I would
hope that the system sets the standard where armor is rated at some value,
that weapons are rated at some value - with overpenetration of weapon
value versus armor value grants some form of damage effect.  High Guard
had the right idea in that higher firepower in a short time period would
grant a higher chance of getting a "hit".  On the other hand, a ship with
an armor rating (pulling numbers from thin air here) of 25 should not be
able to be penetrated with an attack that has 26 1 point lasers.  On the
other hand, that same 25 point armor should be overcome by one 26 point
Laser to the tune of one point\'s worth of damage.  One way this could be
achieved is by having the "damage" rating of the ship equal the number of
dice rolled for damage effect.  Any damage rolled that is higher than the
armor rating gets through, while any damage that doesn\'t get past, is
surface effect only.  Example: a ship with an armor rating of 10 needs to
have 11 points of damage rolled before anything gets through to the
interior.  If a weapon is rated as being a 4/0/0/0, and a roll of 4 dice
yields 14 points of damage, then there will be 4 internal hits, and 10
surface hits.  The surface hits chart might look like:

 2 - drive hit
 3 - Sensor hit
 4 - empty hull hit (ie nothing is damaged except paint and surface finish
 5 - empty hull hit
 6 - turret hit
 7 - empty hull hit
 8 - turret hit
 9 - empty hull hit
10 - commo dish hit
11 - sensor hit
12 - drive hit

  In any event, I don\'t know where the ship combat rules are going, and I
sincerely hope that I am not looking at "jumping" ship on this one - it
deserves better...

  Thanks in advance for any help that I might recieve...

Stripping identification will probably be quite difficult.  Lots of parts to
have serial numbers, molecular analysis to location planet/company/lot number
of manufacture, etc.

Keep in mind that technology aids the detectives as well as the thieves.

Now, a dishonest buyer might well take the ship - at a major discount - but
an honest buyers will demand papers and so forth.

This is one of the reasons *for* the salvage laws. It makes you have a
choice between the 10% salvage value which is 100% *legal*, and the
risk of trying to black market the ship. Remember, ships are produced
in small enough quantities at any given location that they are at least
*somewhat* unique. That means that it\'ll be possible to look at a ship
with *all* serial numbers removed and pin it down to a small number of
ships from only one or two sources. And the rest of those ships are
likely to be accounted for, making it pretty obvious which one this is.

And if you think you can get as much as 10% of the value of *anything*
selling on the black market, I\'ve got a bridge to sell you.

And in that case, your Imperium will never get any ships returned to
it. It isn\'t worth the trouble for honest ship owners (at most, they\'ll
*mail* in a notice about where they spotted it from their next port).
And dishonest shipowners will strip the ship of parts that can\'t be
traced easily, sell those, and then either abandon the remains or, if
convenient, turn it into scrap and sell it as such.

Governments have to be realistic about such things.

        All QSDS hulls were designed using FF&S. There\'s no "simple"
formula, because the QSDS hulls included many separate components lumped
together:
        - The hull itself (armor and and internal structure, for a specific
armor rating and Max G)
        - Controls
        - ContraGrav
        - Life Support (I believe but am not certain).

        That\'s because one hull was designed for a MaxG of 4 and the larger
one was only designed for a MaxG of 2.

In a nutshell, energy.  A projectile that hits a target, and doesn\'t
bounce or go right through deposits nearly all of its enegy to the
target.  Bouncing leaves some kinetic energy in the round, as does
over penetration (going through the target).

Kinetic Energy (KE) goes as the square of the projectile\'s velocity:

KE = 1/2 * m v^2

m is the mass of your projectile.  You can either make a bigger
bullet, or increase the velocity.  As you can see, you get more out
from each unit velocity increase than you do from each mass
increase.

Some effects of projectiles depend more on momentum, which looks
like m*v.  In this case, you get as much out per unit velocity as
per unit mass.

So, if you can leave the bullet in the target, you want KE to be as
big as possible so you increase v.  That\'s another reason for
hollowpoint bullets (aka dum dums).  They expand, making a bigger
wound, but they also stop the bullet in the target so it doesn\'t go
right through, taking energy with it.

I suspect that this was one of the other incidents.

The accounts that I\'ve read/seen seem to indicate that HMS Sheffield was
using satalitte communications equipment at the time of the missile attack.
For some reason this prohibits or interferes in some way with the air search
radar or vice versa. Either way the air search radar was not active at the
time of the strike.
When coupled with the lack of an effective point defence weapon system, (I
don\'t think manually aimed 20mm cannon or LMG\'s count !) the ship bearing my
city\'s name was sent to the bottom because of budget cuts and compromised
design.

I suppose it didn\'t help when you don\'t have any AEW aircraft. Primarily
because the last carrier large enough to support them had been scrapped 5 or
6 years earlier. It\'s intended replacement, CV(N)-01, Britains only planned
N-Powered surface vessel had been axed way before that, but thats another story.

BTW, after the attack on Sheffield, the Argentine\'s had only 4 Exocets left.
Three of these sank the Atlantic Conveyer about a week later.

If anyone takes a look at most Soviet designed vessels, including those in
the roles envisaged for the Type 42 Destroyers like Sheffield, they seem to
have a far more hetrogenous mix of weapon systems. I\'ve no idea if they\'re
any better, or any more effective, it just seems sensible.

There must be alot of aircrew who\'ll atest to the latter !


Meanwhile, back to Traveller !

I\'ve finally sucumbed. I couldn\'t wait any longer for my hardback to arrive,
so I was forced, unmercifully, to by a softcover. Ok so I didn\'t need any
pursuasion really. Once I found that the small games store outside the city
centre had already had a shipment of T4, in and gone in a matter of days !
When the next delivery arrived, hardbacks included, that was that.

It\'s very nice. The drawings are good, colour and B&W, I\'ve always liked
Chris Foss\'s artwork anyway so the colour plates are a bonus. The quality of
the content is just as high as it\'s always been and my appetite for the next
additions is wetted....but ?!

HERESY MODE ON (Stand by with the NOMEX suit)

It feels that there\'s something missing. Yes, apart from the rather obvious
bits like jump potential tables and the rest of the things that are on the
errata page at IG\'s web site. There seems to be a lack of.. substance for
want of a better word. Not in the strength or flexibility of the rules, but
in the product as a whole.
I know that a return to the "simpler" ways of CT are envisaged and thinking
about it, the feel of the T4 production is more akin to the three small
books in the black box than MT and certainly TNE are. But that was what
seems like an age, yet not two minutes ago; it\'s nearly 20 years.

Ok, all the essential rules are there, as you\'d expect and it\'s obvious that
a quick return to the market was needed to ensure survival later. But if IG
are expecting to encourage real newbie players into the fold, then dangling
the Milieu 0 carrot won\'t work, without more background, tie-ins or
generally explanation in the basic set. It\'s ok for the "Vets", we\'ve spent
years playing and amassed bookcases full of endless expansions, magazines
and the rest, sufficient to tide us over until the latest new official, I
daren\'t use the "C" word, offering appears.

T4 is predominantly preaching to the converted.

HERESY MODE OFF (Just call the fire brigade now)

Now don\'t get me wrong, I like it, it\'s great to have the one true game back
on the shelves. News of my death was premature and all that. It\'s just,
maybe , I don\'t know, I was perhaps expecting more ? Or should that be to much ?

I had to dust off some of my old physics books on the definition of pressure, so
someone should check my results. I\'ve ignored several factors like the change in
the temperature of the air, etc. The results are very approximate anyway because
bulkheads, door ways, etc. will change the results considerably (slowing the
pressure drop). Charles Collin wasn\'t so far off in his estimate.

(Old timer war story coming.) All of this reminds of the time I was in an
airlock in a jumpsuit when it was vented to (near) vacuum. (True story!) The
first indications were the noise and what felt like a punch to my chest as the
air in my lungs escaped. The airlock then filled with a cloud of condensing
water vapor. 

The airlock was the airlock of an Air Force altitude chamber where I was taking
flight training. It was vented to the main chamber to demonstrate an explosive
decompression. We went from sea level to about 40,000 ft in seconds. I had
plenty of time to locate and don my oxygen mask. (I wonder how long someone
could survive in a real vacuum with an oxygen supply? Pressure breathing is an
acquired skill, but the mask would seal the mouth and nose.) 

I\'m sure there are some Air Force or NASA studies on the subject. I\'ll do some
digging.

[tired sigh]  It /has/ been a long time, indeed.  It\'s ... weird ... to

Soap-Box Mode ON

Possibly.  Maybe even probably (I\'m not just a stick in the mud - I\'m 
wishy-washy, too[G]).  But, darn it, I like it that way!  I\'m probably 
being very selfish thinking this way, but I think it\'s about time someone 
put out a role-playing product targeted to /me/!  I\'m sick and tired of 
RPGs being nothing but background with a little bit of rules thrown in 
for color, or a collection of rules that is so immense that one can\'t 
possibly play "correctly" without first going through the equivalent of a 
college course in game mechanics.  Admittedly, Shadowrun strikes a nice 
balance in this regard, but the trend has been for quite some time now 
toward rule-less games.  I want rules books to be 90% rules and 
to be reasonably short - don\'t give me a rule for everything.  Campaign 
books should be 90% background and of a reasonable length (96 pages or 
thereabouts) as well.  I like it that way.  It was good enough for 
grand-dad, and it\'s good enough for me. :)

Nah, you\'re probably right.  Although T4 has sold well, it is probably 
true that many, many of today\'s gamers look at it and become disgusted at 
the old-fashioned approach IG has taken.  "What, no clans?  No drawings 
of scantily clad women?  No supernatural beings?  Aaarrrghh!"  Heck, the 
lack of the "grunge" feel will probably turn a lot of people off, too.  

Oh, well.

Soap Box Mode OFF

BTW, I\'m not implying that YOU want those things (clans, etc.).  It\'s clear 
that you want a product that has more Travelleresque background in the main 
rulebook, not a bunch of garbage added on to attract the White Wolf 
crowd.  You just happened to give me an opening to go off on a rant, and 
I was bad and took it. :)

There\'s not exactly a "formula" ... but the hulls are all designed with a
consistent system, that _will_ be compatible with forthcoming products (such
as the Starships suppliment, and the projected Naval Architect\'s Handbook
previously known as "FF&S2").

The QSDS/T4 hulls are put together strictly according to the rules from FF&S
for such things.  They all include:

1) A basic hull
2) Internal structure braced to the hull\'s G rating.
3) A life-support system.
4) Control systems.
5) Artificial Gravity with acelleration compensation.
6) Airlocks and cargo doors based on the hull\'s size.
7) A contra-gravity system that can nullify the hull\'s rated mass.

There isn\'t a "formula" in the sense that there\'s only one correct 400-ton
streamlined cylinder hull.  There are lots - dozens, once you count the
combination of G ratings and armor values.  From a sheer size perspective, I
had to pick only a few.  I tried to pick interesting ones.

Some hulls include:
8) Additional armor.

If you want more hulls (probably more hulls than you know what to do with),
you can download the Big Table of Hulls from my Web site.  This is a _huge_
table that lists a complete cross-section of the possible hulls.
It\'s at http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds/

Because that\'s what the designer specified.  There\'s no reason why (for
example) all of the hulls could have been designed to 6G and 80 points of
armor - except that 1G free traders would be hauling around six times the
internal structure, and a couple dozen times the armor, that they really
needed.

I chose different specifications for different hulls in anticipation of
their "most likely" use, and to make things interesting.  I included all of
the hulls I could think of from Classic Traveller, so you\'ll find a 100
ton hull that\'s perfect for a "Type-S" Scout/Courier, a 200-tonner that\'s
just right for a "Far Trader", and two different 400-tonners, that happen to
match the Classic "Fat Trader" and "Patrol Cruiser".  The patrol hull, of
course, is designed for more G\'s and has more armor than the trader hull.
On top of the classic hulls, I added a bunch more that I thought would be
interesting or useful (the 300-tonner is, for example, just the right size
and shape to be the Millenium Falcon).

They work, it\'s just that you didn\'t get them in T4.  QSDS is a lot like the
old Book 2 ship design system - you\'re picking "off the shelf", pre-designed
and pre-fabricated components and assembling them.  You can\'t always get
what you want, and you sometimes have to accept less than perfect efficency.
On the other had, it\'s fast and cheap (which is why you get a discount).

When your players ask why they can\'t get a 300 ton hull that has 80 points
of armor and is stressed to 6Gs, you can play the part of the shipyard
foreman, shrug, and say "because Ling-Standard doesn\'t make \'em that way."


> this point, I suspect that I am rapidly becoming discouraged with T4

I hope this helps; I can understand your frustration, but the QSD System
that\'s in the T4 rules is necissarily incomplete - we didn\'t have enough
space, or time, to present a more general, do-anything system.

> It is my hope that the Naval Architect\'s Handbook does away with the

That\'s something that was built into the T4 "basic" ship combat system, and
really isn\'t a feature of the ship design.  The Naval Architect\'s Handbook
isn\'t completely hashed out, but it\'s looking like the NAH will provide you
with a complete data sheet on your design, and then give you rules for
converting it to make the numbers that you\'ll need for the various combat
systems.  For example, the NAH design might say that the hull is armored
with 1cm of Bonded Superdense armor, and then note that it has a T4/RPSC
armor value of 80.

I see this primarily as a combat-system issue, not a design system issue.
The QSDS designs were all originally done with the FF&S system, so the
design parameters are available to rate the design for combat systems other
than the T4 basic combat system.  If you have Battle Rider, and wish to use
that, simply divide the T4 armor values by 10 to get the BR values.

This isn\'t a bad idea at all; particularly if you like to roll lots of dice,
Champions-style.  I\'m not sure it\'ll work with the numbers that QSDS/T4
gives you for weapons, but you might be able to make it work by
approximately halving the armor values.

Indeed, Traveller does; the T4 "basic" ship combat system isn\'t very good.
A better one, IMHO, for role-playing sessions is the Role-Playing Space
Combat System (RPSC).  Although I\'m not the author of that system, I
contributed heavily, and host it on my Web site:
Get RPSC from http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/rpsc/

RPSC still has ablative armor (sorry), but has a re-designed damage system,
a new movement system, and is in general way superior to the combat system
that came with T4.  RPSC is still in testing (version 0.90), but looks good;
if you\'d like to take a look at it, try it in your game, and give us
feedback, I\'m sure it could be even better.

Still under development on the GDW-Beta list is a detailed, boardgame style
combat system that _will_ feature non-ablative armor and may other sublties
(including full rules for missiles).  I\'m sure that the detailed system will
be announced on the TML as soon as it\'s ready for testing, too.

The battle was extremely interesting; I am now a convert to the armor system

the side that has the initiative get to CHOOSE whether they go first or
last. That way, they could have "held their fire" until the enemies got
close enough to do some damage to. Perhaps have both sides move
simultaneously a hex at a time! Then they can fire at any point in their
movement as they "dance" around one another. Since Movement and fire can all
be combined anyway, why not have all of it (for both sides) happen
simultaneously. I\'m running Traveller again Friday night; I\'ll test this
idea and get back to you with it.

I don\'t know about the dophins but intelligent buildings and complexes 
are a common theme in my Traveller games. There seems to be nothing 
worse than a smug AI to piss off my players. 

If cybernetics are to be included in a Traveller game there would have 
to be some house rules developed to recognise the equivalent of loss of 
Empathy (Cyberpunk) or Essence (Shadowrun) that occurs with the addition 
of items of cyberware. In my Traveller environment, both cybernetics and 
psionics are considered of an alien nature and are considered to be 
extremely condusive to a low ability to empathise with fellow human 
beings. Only cybernetic devices of a critical medical nature are freely 
available.

a one square meter hole. The correct times are:

8.1 seconds for pressure to drop to one half current value

13 sec from earth sea level to the top of Everest (29,000 ft) equivalent
pressure
23 sec from sea level to   50,000 ft equivalent
47 sec from sea level to 100,000 ft equivalent
and so on until you reach what you consider vacuum. Because the pressure drops
exponentially, it will never reach exactly zero. The times for larger or smaller
ships scale directly with their displacements.

The caculations still ignore some of the higher order effects. The presence of
internal walls, doorways, equipment, etc. will have a larger effect and will
slow the pressure drop significantly, except in the immediate area of the
breach. If the ship is functional, automatic hatches will close to seal off the
undamaged areas. 

Drills should be conducted routinely to improve the chances of the crew and,
especially, the passengers to locate and don their vac suits quickly. A DM
should apply, maybe based on the number of drills and/or the time since the last
drill. Some consideration also needs to apply for a person\'s location relative
to suit storage areas or being able reach a secure, sealable location. Emergency
"beach ball" survival equipment throughout the ship would not be a bad idea. As
in some WWII submarine movies, at some point a decission may have to be made to
close off a damaged section of the ship that still has people in it.

I agree with the earlier comment that decompressing the ship prior to combat has
some advantages. In particular, everyone would already be in their vac suits.
Some consideration would have to be given, however, to a reduction in an
individual\'s ability to operate his station in a vac suit. An alternative might
be to leave the ship pressurized and have vac suits on with helments and gloves
off, but within easy reach. All hatches should also be closed. There would most
likely be a variation in procedures between navies and, perhaps, between
captains.

All in all, a hull breach is a nasty thing.

Velocity affects how far a round will travel with any accuracy, and how much
energy it will transfer to the target.

Ammo design is the art of finding the right balance between weight and
velocity to give the desired effect.  Pistols tend to use large calibers
with fairly low speeds, since the design of the weapon doesn\'t allow for
much bracing by the firer against recoil.  Rifles use smaller rounds with
much higher velocity.

Gauss weapons use very small rounds (4mmx25mm) accelerated to very high
speed.  Since the force of impact is concentrated in a very small area, the
round penetrates light armor with ease.

This is why modern bullets are still made of lead.  Since most hand weapons
still rely on the brute force impact of the "heavy", slow projectile, that
bullet must be made out of a dense metal.

One of the NPCs remembers a story about how a secret criminal organization

Formula for distance displacement is 1/2 accelleration times time in
seconds squared - correct?

  IF correct, and each gameturn is 30 minutes, then each gameturn is 1,800
seconds.  If 1 G accelleration is equal to 9.8 meters per second per
second, and we want to determine how far a ship has travelled in 30
minutes, the plug ins for the formula would be:

Distance in Kilometers is equal to (.5*9.8*1,800^2)/1000 correct?

If so, the numbers work out to be 15,876 Km.  If that is the case, why are
the hexes measured in 1/10ths of a light second (approximately 30,000
Km)?

  In looking at MAYDAY, the game states that short range for High Guard
combat is 5 hexes, and long range is at 15 hexs, where anything beyond 15
hexes cannot be hit.
  Now in MAYDAY, the rules are such that 1 turn is 100 minutes, and hex
distance is approximately 1 light second (or 300,000 Km).  And yet, using
the formula above, I wind up getting the distance for a 1 G accelleration
to be 176,400 Km (or roughly .58 light seconds in distance).
  In short, all of the distances per turn seem to be magnified by a factor
of two.  What gives?

nope. It\'s from the Latin or Greek "bis" meaning "two". In both

I\'ve been waiting for someone else to answer, since that\'s one of the
things *I* never got a good answer to. I will say that the velocity
will be more like the average molecular velocity. 

I could probably figure it out except I don\'t have my reference books
(I *hate* having all that stuff in storage, but I can\'t afford the time
to sort thru the boxes and find the right ones.)

All I know about gas behavior is the PV=nRT which if I recall correctly
is something like P=pressure, V=volume, R=energy, T=temperature, and
n=some constant.

At that speed, unless it is a AP round, it won\'t *matter* if it hits
flesh or bone. Take a good look at what a .223 caliber "varmint round"
does at 3000-5000 *feet* per second. Small animals like crows, gophers,
maybe even rabbits turn into a cloud of grease. Watermelons turn into
mush. 

And with an AP round you\'ll *still* get nasty wound because of the

Yes and no. The Navy has huge "mothball fleets" on the off chance that
they might need the ships again. That\'s where the Iowa and New Jersey
had been sitting since the Korean War. Eventually, they decide that
ships are *too* obsolete and they scrap them.

Merchant vessels tend to get used until they are not economical, then
either sold to somebody how thinks they can make a go of it, or sold
for scrap. 

We used to have vessels getting scrapped regularly here until the
salvage outfit (Ziedel\'s) had a fire that burned their dock to the
waterline. They still salvage some stuff, but not as much as before.

Unlike cars, ships have large enogh chunks of steel for it to be worth
your while to cut them up. Beams and plates of reasonable size get
stack up out in the "yard" for buyers. Ones of odd shapes and sizes get
sold as scrap to a steel mill (you get a lot less for a ton of scrap
steel than you get for a ton of 1 inch plate, even *used* plate!). 

And the various fitting get piled up to be sold to folks who need them.

That\'s what will happen to ships that aren\'t worth repairing. But
functional ships will be in use *somewhere*, or they *may* be sitting
in a yard waiting for a buyer if the areas where they\'d be economical
are too far off.

You *could* have some "dead" ships there if the market is such that
scrapping them for parts isn\'t worth the effort. One *big* gfactor in
favor of this is the fact that unlike on the ground, stirage space in
orbit is essentially "free". You park the ships in a high orbit (so you
don\'t need to worry about orbital decay for a century or two. Tie them
together loosely with cables, and hang a radar beacon onto the mess.
Since orbital installations will be common, you *won\'t* be in any of
the "prime" locations, such as synchronous orbit. But you\'ll be
reachable without too much trouble (maybe an hour or so in a low power
shuttle). 

If the system is busy enough, there\'ll be an office there (or if the
owner is poor enough to live "on premises" :-)

BTW, another argument in favor of the graveyard setup is the way
airliners are treated. They wind up in "graveyards" too. Mostly to be
stripped, sometimes you\'ll have someone buy a "dead" airplane just to
get the rights to the airframe registration number (you\'d be amazed
what an airframe and powerplant certified mechanic can sign off on as a
"modification". :-)


It\'s quite possible that players could manage to find a restorable ship
that was *centuries* old in one of these places. If they get lucky,
they can restore it, and upgrade a few of the more important systems.
Picture a Space Shuttle with the power system replaced by a small
fusion plant and a few other upgrades operating as a in-system cargo
craft. The owner *could* land it, but he doesn\'t dare except in an
emergency, because he couldn\'t afford the CG unit it\'d take to be able
to launch on it\'s own. He can\'t afford to replace the external tank
he\'d have to jettison either.

Hmmm. Anybody got specs for the Shuttle online? I\'m feeling tempted... :-)

Anyway, *that* would open the eyes of some players. Or take some ship
from an old SF story and do something similar. It\'s old, it\'s obsolete,
but somebody got a good deal on it and managed to scrounge enough stuff
to get it working. Remember my post a few months back about the Free
Trader with a NERVA manuever drive and a nuclear reactor to power the
rest of the ship? This sort of thing *will* be out there.

And while these ships might be easy prey for pirates, most of the time
they aren\'t carrying anything worth the trouble of hijacking, and they
pirates will be able to take one look and *know* that the ship can\'t be
sold for enough to cover ammo costs. So they mostly won\'t get attacked.
(Besides, with no thrusters, no CG or artifical gravity, and no Heplar
exhaust, they\'ll be a lot less likely to be detected).

These are the "banana boats" and "copra freighters" of the Imperium.
Carrying low profit, low priority cargoes they\'ll boost into orbit,
then make a *burn* to aim for the jump point and *coast*. So they\'re in
free fall? They\'re used to it and the cargo doesn\'t care.

Heck, given the low priority nature of bulk cargo, some of these could
even be the huge bulk carriers that folks keep wondering about. Why
waste the energy on that sort of cargo? Why bother butting new ships on
such runs except to handle more cargo, and replace ships that can\'t be
repaired anymore. Check out how long sail powered vessels with steel
hulls were in use after the steam engine came into general use. You\'ll
be surprized. Only reason that they *still* aren\'t being used is that
they didn\'t scale up very well. Spacecraft, especially those designed
to stay in space, don\'t have that problem.

Do realize that surviving a 200 foot jump is *not* as ridiculous as it
sounds. The news media made a big thing of the guy in Florida who
screwed up a parachute jump and dropped that far and was able to *walk
away*. There are a lot of other instances on record. It\'s not something
you want to count on, but as long as you aren\'t heading for hard flat
ground, there\'s a chance.

They guy in florida hit some trees. In another case, the guy hit
snowdrifts on a *slope*, and one guy in WWII just hit a slope with
brush and lots of loose gravel. He broke a few things, but was able to
hobble away.

Unlikely? Yup. But given the choice between those big uglies and a
stream (maybe shallow, maybe not) or some trees, the unlikely starts
looking a whole lot better than the certainty of getting munched.

Not *that* dramatic. You forget that the skin is rather hard to

Wrong again. When a scuba diver goes down, his internal pressure adjust
to the external pressure. They come up slowly to allow the pressures to
equalize as they come back up. Mostly to allow dissolved gasses time to
get exchanged in the lungs instead of forming bubbles in the blood. 

A diver who panics on the way up and holds his breath will rupture his
lungs, but not show much other obvious damage. A closer look will show
things like gas bubbles under the skin, but that comes later.

Sorry, wrong answer. Check the sci.space faq or the item that has been
posted to the lists several times regarding the shuttle astronaut who
punctured his suit AND DIDN\'T KNOW IT! The skin on his hand acted as a
patch for the hole in his glove and they only realived it later.

Simple. The damage done by a projectile depends on both the mass *and*
on the velocity. At the same speed a heavier projectile does more
damage. Twice as heavy, twice as much (roughly). And for two
projectiles of the same mass, the faster one does more damage. Twice as
fast, roughly *four* times as much damage (you square the velocity).

I say "roughly" above because the interactions between a bullet and
what it hits are *very* complex. It\'s a field known as "terminal
ballistics". 

Oh yeah, the recoil, or "kick" also depends on mass & velocity, but
both are linear effects (ie twice the mass twice the kick, twice the
velocity twice the kick). 

So a higher velocity is definitely desirable.

 "Comments?"

I agree that neural interfaces are a lot likelier than jump drives --
after all, we have *some* neural interface today -- and I realize we 
are dealing with fantasy future-tech, but it always struck me that 
ANY enhancement of skill by cyber-implant is a HELL of a lot trickier 
than replacing or backing-up sense organs or limbs.

After all, the human brain does have "ports" for limbs and sensors, 
but there is no anatomical equivalent to slots for more memory boards 
or auxilliary processors.  And human brains don\'t have skills loaded 
in like software; so far as we can now tell, a skill or a memory is 
GROWN in the brain by new or modified neural connections; it\'s our 
"hardware" that "re-writes" itself when we learn, not the "software."

Which means that, to me, replacement eyes, radar eyes, IR eyes, replacement
arms, driving a car or flying a ship by neural jack, internal media 
hookup, and things like that all sound a lot easier than loading in 
new skills or memories.

I wouldn\'t forbid the more intellectual cyberwear from an SF universe, 
but I\'d introduce the sensory-motor cyberwear much earlier in the 
history, and therefore make it much more reliable, available in a wider
range of prices and functions, with side-effects much better known, sooner.

Also, I think there\'s a lot to the objection just posted that people don\'t
like gouging their eyes out and cutting their arms off, even for upgrades.
As cyberwear becomes a mature technology, I\'d expect to see some kind of 
non-surgical interface.  You just slip on the visor or the man-amp suit, 
and hey-presto, it reaches into your nervous system with clever, non-
invasive EM fields or something and becomes your new organ until you take 
it off.

Granted, this might take some getting used to.  It takes some practice 
to drive a car, too.

The problem with cybernetics is this....
Take a picture of the Grand Canyon, and look at it
Does it convey the awesome landscape?
No, it is just a picture
And that is the dehumanizing aspect of cyberware, remember your eyes are not just a 
body part, they are modified nerves (ie they are an actual part of your nervous system, 
ergo part of your brain (actually the brain is part of the nervous system , not the other 
way but bear with me)) Your natural parts are both software and hardware. Every scar 
on your hand is a memory, there would be no such memories with cyber parts
Natural organs and limbs are shaped and designed by evolution to fit you, cyber has to 
be fitted. 
As for voluntarily hacking off a limb to replace it with the Tin Man\'s, that is ridiculous
Unless there was major screwing with the human psyche, losing a limb requires years of 
therapy, especially if you get an artificial one.

As a comparison, if you\'d like to feel your body implode
from having 2 atm of pressure on it instead of one, go sit under
about 20 feet of water. I, like many other people, have personally
withstood 5 or so atm of pressure on a "deep dive". Real commercial
and professional divers have withstood much, much more. If you can
withstand 10 extra atm of pressure, one atm less shouldn\'t be a big deal.

The only reason that divers have to descend and ascend slowly is due
to gas solubility being different at different pressures - in higher
pressures, more nitrogen can dissolve in your blood, so if you ascend too
fast, you\'ll end up with bubbles of N2 in your blood forming, which
would be bad. If you only go to a 1 atm difference though (~20 feet I think)
you won\'t notice the problem. The most likely problem with decompression
would be sinuses, ear drums, those tender bits.

Mostly due to the fact that they\'d have nothing to breathe about
30 sec. after the hold formed, not because their heads would explode.

The ship worked well, but the character did not.  This was probably due to
other factors, but I blame the player.

Robots have tremendous advantages in normal situations (i.e. reaction
speed, accuracy of senses, ability to \'load\' skills instead of learning
them) that make them difficult to balance, and the usual disadvantages
(Extremely logical personality, behavior limitations, etc.) associated
with robots in traditional SF literature are very difficult to implement
or roleplay.

As an NPC, a ship with its own intelligence worked out better.  Since the
AI had its own agenda apart from the party\'s they didn\'t often agree, and  
eventually parted ways.  Who wants a ship, after all, that doesn\'t "jump"
when you call?

While it\'s not realistic, it\'s easy, fun, and assists in player-character

That makes a certain amount of sense, and doesn\'t break anything IMHO.
What do you think, Joe?

> Perhaps have both sides move simultaneously a hex at a time!

Maybe.  I can think of two ways of doing that:

1) The easy way:
The side with initiative selects which ship (any of their own, or any of
their opponents) will move first.  That ship moves, and (optionally) expends
MP.  The other side (from the ship that moved first) selects one of their
own ships, and it moves (one hex, with optional MP expenditure).  The two
sides alternate moving ships until all ships have moved one hex, at which
point the whole procedure begins again for the second hex of movement.

Note that if one side has more ships than the other, that side will move
the "extras" after the other side has moved all of it\'s ships.  Similarly,
the fastest ships will continue moving after the slower ships have moved
all of their hexes.

This isn\'t realistic, but it works - it\'s easy to explain, and it\'s not
_too_ slow, particularly if there\'s only a handful of ships on the board.

2) Phased movement:
This is complicated (maybe too complicated for RPCS), but it\'s actually
faster than the easy way, as long as all the ships have their own pilots to
move them.

During movement, the referee calls out the phase number.  Ships which move
that phase take their movement, and expend any MP desired.   Gunners call
fire, and it is resolved in the order called out, before the referee
announces the next phase.

Ships moving at speed 9 or less move one hex on the indicated phases.  Ships
moving at speed 10 (exactly) move 1 hex every phase.  Ships moving faster
than speed 10 subtract 10 from their speed: they move one hex every phase,
and two hexes on the indicated phases.

Here\'s the phase chart:

Phase #	1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10

Speed 1                            X

Well, William Gibson is usually credited with the "Cyberpunk" movement
which uses the idea of Virtual Reality as provided by sight and sound
inputs via video and audio inputs.  I think the Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. rules
book takes the next step I mentioned above (connecting directly to the
brain, that is) but I\'m sure someone else had thought of it first.  It\'s
been a theme in Science Fiction since at least the 70s (more and more I
have discovered that what I thought was a "new" idea has been published
in, like, 1850 or something).

There are no traveller materials (that I have found) which deal with this
subject in any detail.

The rules I am preparing are for using the NetRunner Collectable Card Game
(CCG) and the Cyberpunk 2020 materials for GMing computer intrusion tasks
in a quick and interesting fashion.

I recommend getting the Cyberpunk 2020 Rules Book (damn, I\'m starting to
feel like they should giv me a sales commission). This provides basic
information on the netrunner type, equipment, programs, cybernetic
implants (some of which are silly) and the design of the \'Net in general.

For our purposes we could come up with some ideas that would implement
cybernetic enhancements in characters.  I do not feel that there is any
need for a "humanity factor" such as another poster suggested, which
balances enhancements with a loss of "humaness" and social stigma.  On the
other hand, I see no reason not to harass characters with substantial
implants when they try to pass through starport weapon detectors.

I\'ll compose some stuff off-line for surgical electronic organ
replacements and post it here after the weekend.

	You are absolutely right on both counts. These pressure
differentials are what I referred to as impedence in my origianl post.
In addition there will be turbulence (unless it\'s a very small hole)
and temperature drop. These will tend to make the "half life"
longer than what\'s calculated. I have no idea how much longer, tho 8^(.

P(t) is measured in whatever units P0 is measured in. If you measure
P0 in atmospheres, the answer you get for P(t) is in atmospheres. If
it\'s in pounds per square inch, the answer is in pounds per square inch.

u is about 500m/s for breathable air.

To get the current thrust, multiply the current pressure by the area of
the hole. For instance, if the pressure of the ship is currently 10
pounds per square inch (reduced from atmosphere of 14 pounds per square
inch) and the area of the hole is 80" * 40" = 3200 sq. in., then the
thrust is  F = (10 lbs/sq. in.) * (3200 sq. in.) = 32,000 lbs. This will
cause a 32,000 pound ship\'s boat to lurch at one gee.

If you prefer metric (like I do), then multiply the pressure in pascals
(1 atmosphere equals about 100,000 pascals) by the area of the hole in
square meters, and you get the thrust in newtons (about 5 newtons in a
pound). This has the advantage that if you\'re using the formula I gave
above, you\'ve already calculated the area in square meters (about 1,500
square inches in a square meter).

Hope this helps.

On page 73 of the rule book it states that "Then there is everyone else,

>From the weapons table Page 80, it states that a Rifle, Laser has a mass

If this is the case there isn\'t a character that would be able to lift or 
use these weapons. The most that your characters "strength" can be, 
initially is 12. This would make the combined mass of the rifle and 
reload to be about 3 times the charaters strength and would restrict the 
use of these weapons to characters with powered battlearmour only.

I believe that there is an error with the placement of the decimal point.
The weight of a modern day back-pack radio is about 5 kgs and the 
heaviest rifle/LMG is about 6 kgs. While this combination may still be 
more than some characters strength, it is not beyond reasonable.

	Hi John.
Perhaps you could have it like it is very misfit-like to use cybertech.
Perhaps only some companies spend money to enhance their employees. Perhaps
people sees them as misfits and because of it they give enhanced people a
cross eye. On some worlds it may even be seen as an insult of the worst
kind to even begin to alter themselves. Perhaps it may be illegal in some
worlds because of echo-criminals use the technology to rob people blind..

	So, in the long run it would even be dangerous to have cybertech.

	Don\'t worry about it. I do have works 4.0 too and it is great to hear that
i can be able to oblige you. Of course it will be a much simpler sheet and
you will have to feed the info from the tables in the FF&S manual, but it
will do the same as the excel stuff. I will get right on it and perhaps it
will be finished Sunday night and implemented onto my web page.

	The reason i am doing this:
When i first got the traveller and Megatraveller RPG i choke on all those
formulaes i encountered. My first spaceship took me 8 days to manufacture
and i swore to find a better and faster way. 
	With the sheets i am proud to say you are down to perhaps 30 minutes max.
If i can do this for the rest of you as well, i will be just as happy as i
know you all will be. :)-

fast, but not all that strong.  He\'s very agile, but he might not 
have been, for the same reason he\'s not strong -- money.  He does 
have total recall, but the game is psi-heavy and he\'s lousy at that;
he can receive a telepathic contact, but he hasn\'t learned to initiate
them and, when he does, he will improve at the skill very slowly.

The issue of shoving in skill software has not come up, but if I were 
GM, I\'d rule against it.  For an AI, I would rule, a data file is not 
(subjectively) like an installable memory but like a book or video -- 
a record external to your mind and self.  Similarly, a program is not 
a new skill you suddenly have, but a kind of tool you must learn to use.
In short, the AI\'s mind is not the whole computer but just the operating 
system.

I also don\'t let AIs migrate around the net.  The rationalization is 
that AI software is so huge, it is always found running on an amalgam 
of many processors in parallel -- so many that there are always lots 
of idiosyncracies in the local architecture that the AI adapts to 
as it "grows up."  The result is that it is not copyable or transportable.

Above all, AIs don\'t heal; they have to be repaired.

I would impose those strictures for game-balance, but I think they 
at least sound plausible.

Correct.

Correct.

Because the formula you cite gives the distance that the ship travels
_during the acelleration_.  That 15,876km is _NOT_ the distance the ship
will travel in the _next_ 1800 seconds, and every 1800 seconds thereafter
until it acellerates again.

The velocity change formula is: Velocity = Acelleration * Time.
SO, while the ship was acellerating, it changed it\'s velocity to 17.6km/sec.
The _next_ game turn, it will travel: Distance = Velocity * Time
or 31,752km.

Since ships spend most of their time coasting at a given speed, it\'s better
to choose a hex size that\'s related to the _VELOCITY_ a ship gains after a
turn of acelleration, than it is to size the hexes to the distance a ship
travels _during_ the acelleration.

It\'s a trade-off - the choices are:
1) Accept a half-hex error for every G of acelleration and deceleration
   used, or
2) Accept a one-hex error for every point of speed the ship has, or
3) Accept a complicated system where each G of acelleration changes the
   ship\'s speed by 2 hexes a turn, only one of which apply this turn.

I\'ll take #1; the error isn\'t large (compared to the hexes) and it
simplifies movement enough that you can do it on the gameboard.

Same reason.

   The velocity of the projectile is the biggest factor in determining the
projectile\'s energy. According to Newton:

ke = mv^2/2

   Where "ke" is the kinetic energy (the hitting force) of the projectile 
in Joules; "m" is the mass of the projectile in kilograms; "v" is the
velocity of the projectile in m/sec.

   Obviously (as it is an exponential factor) having a projectile at, say
for example, 10 grams and 3000 m/sec is MUCH better than having a
projectile at 20 grams and 1500 m/sec. (The former has 9e4 Joules, the
latter has 4.5e4 Joules)

  Oops! Forgot to divide by 2; these figures should be 4.5e4 and 2.25e4

<h1>			Lunion Subsector 1083
</h1>

	This scenario is intendet for game Coconventions.  It
	should be played with the predefined characters.  It takes
	place in the Spinward Marches, subsector K - Lunion, not far
	from the border worlds.  Date: 1083.
<p>
	The scenario involves three crew and three passengers of the
	Windfall (a 40 year old, 200 ton Jayhawk far trader).  Various
	encounters and trading opportunites will lead them to Ianic
	where they may get involved in the first Jonkeereen rebellion.
	See "The Regency Sourcebook".
<p>
	The scenario can unfold in several different ways as each
	character has his or her own goals.  A lot of groups will not
	get to Ianic in the 4-6 hours of normal convention scenarios
	but they should at least arrive on Sharrip.
<p>
	Six players are required: 3 for the crew and 3 for the
	passengers.  Establish how old the players are and assign
	them appropriate characters.  Ten minutes will be needed
	for each of them for the briefing, the character
	description and the rules.
<p>
	Each PC should choose a name and fill in the right hand side of
	the character sheet with what they want to take on the trip.
<p>
	The bounty hunter has an Imperial Licence for a laser
	pistol and, of course, has his own weapon.  The captain
	could have weapons in the ship\'s locker and should decide
	what freight is being carried. Inform the captain that taking
	fertilisers to Ianic will bring 2kCr per displacement ton due
	to handling.  Inform the blind passenger to hide as long as
	she wants.
<p>
	You also need 2 tables, they should stand side by side,
	one for the passengers and one for the crew. So if a
	crew member (e.g. the stuard) wants to enter the
	passenger staterooms she should change the table,
	and vice versa.
<p>
	Start the scenario with the crew on board, and the passengers
	arriving.  Two scenes give the crew an opportunity to learn
	about ship combat rules. The first is a fat trader on a
	collision course. The second is a meteor storm while the
	referee should fake the wear value role of the thusters. 
	You should make all sensor rolls uncertain to make this
	interesting. 
<p>
	The *main* fight will be at Ianic against a
	Fast Courier.  The Ine Givar psionic will befuddle the sensor
	crew for two rounds (one hour) to make such a David and
	Goliath battle possible.
<p>
	At Ianic the players need to arrive on the planet quickly as there is
	also a Cruiser in the system.  The Jonkeereen will hide the
	Windfall underground so the players can help their
	revolution.  (Double Adventure 6: Night of Conquest can be
	used for this.)  They will also have to refuel at one of the
	gas giants and certainly have to leave the Imperium.

	Sharrip belongs to the Al Morrib Line.    Nobody lives on
	the surface as a deadly virus exists on the planet.
	The planet has an obital starport with a small crew of
	50 people.  Four of the crew are happy to be leaving for a
	vacation on Strouden, the rest start unpacking brand new
	equipment.
<pre>
	Departure :
	Ship.Eng/Easy: The thrusters get hot and need repair
	Sensors/Easy: One big meteor crossing flightpath
	Astrogation/Difficult: the metror will be 2 kms away
	Sensors/Difficult: it\'s not just one big one - its lots and
		lots of little ones!  
</pre>
	The referee should manage to fake the wear value roll of the
	thrusters so the ship can not maneuver.  PCs will need to
	destroy the meteors.  You should start your clock running and
	remember that lasers recycle every three minutes.  You should
	roll 2d6 for the number of small meteors that are *really* on
	a collision course.  Any of them need a difficult sensor roll
	to lock on to in the first 15 minutes and an average roll in
	the last 6 minutes.  Every meteor has a 10% chance of
	actually hitting the ship in a random location.  (Thus, the
	situation is not as dangerous as it should seem to the
	players).  Ensure that all sensor rolls are uncertain, e.g.
	by asking whether it is even or odd and rolling a hidden die.
	There should be only one sensor attempt per minute, leaving
	the players with a feeling of uncertainty, helplessness and
	fear.

	Lunion is the capital of subsector K of the Spinward Marches.
	Ling Standard is also building warships here.  Like
	Strouden, Lunion has a tainted atmosphere because of an
	environmental disaster. Two ships are orbiting and two others
	are arriving.  The captain will need to use communications and
	admin skills to avoid long orbit times.
<p>
	A lot of people on Lunion are talking about the civil war at
	Ianic, that Ianic has been declared a red zone and that it
	is forbidden to land there.

	Two weeks ago you purchased the Windfall.  As it is known
	that a Jayhawk will not operate on the usual 1kCr per
	displacement ton, you are searching for a good trade route
	and found Ianic, a non-industrial, rich, desert planet with a
	population of nearly 9 million.  Water will fetch a price of
	10kCr per ton.
	So it would be possible to pay for the Windfall (57 dt cargo
	hold) in just a few months.

	To keep your finances in the black, you hare hoping for
	passengers and have refitted the staterooms and the bridge
	section.
<p>
	You were lucky with the crew.  As a stewardess you hired a
	medical school graduate.  She is young and agreed to a crew salary.
	The chief is an old hand, took a quick look at the ship and said:
	"OK, I\'ll get this beast flying."

	You have been hired on whilst on Strouden and are happy that
	the captain only asked about technical things.
	He seems to be a bit green.  The Windfall is not a wreck but
	it\'s not far off one.  The power plant has a wear value of
	at least 4 and the thrusters, jump drive and contra-grav are not
	looking much better.  The bridge section and passenger
	staterooms were refitted recently, but the rest of the 40
	year old Jayhawk needs a lot of rust chipping.

	You have caught a glimpse of the chief engineer, a man in his

	Anyway, things being what they were there wasn\'t much
	work for a ex-Marine Colonel who had seen lots of action
	to do.
<p>
	You visited the office of a local bank and did some
	discreet inquiries.  Yes, they said, they paid 0.75% of the
	principal on the loan for ships recovered. Yes, we keep lists
	of skipped ships with holographs of their skippers...
	Oh.. but you need to have a private investigator\'s license.
<p>
	Of course you had one, so now you\'ve got the list of skipped
	ships.  You\'ve heard rumours that a well known pirate has recently
	hired on the Windfall, a 40 year old Jayhawk, and you think
	this would be worth investigating.  It would be interesting
	to compare the serial numbers of some of the more expensive
	items such as the power plant, jump drive, thrusters,
	contra-grav, computers and weapons.

	The *Disciples of the Bright Way* are a sect that believe their deity
	exists in jumpspace, and communicates directly with people while they
	are in jump. They call the sight of J-space *The Face of the Deity*
	and have a secret combination of drugs and meditation practices that
	reduce (but not eliminate!) the insanity impact of viewing J-space.
<p>
	They are generally not dangerous, but their disturbing practice of
	shooting up  drugs and staring out of an open porthole into J-space
	during the week of a jump means that most captains will refuse to
	allow them on board under *any* circumstances.
<p>
	However, the Disciples will pay an *obscene* amount of money for
	passage on a ship, and since they don\'t care about bodily comforts
	they are quite happy to bunk two to a stateroom under middle passage
	conditions, and pay up to Cr25,000 each for their \'pilgrimage\'.
<p>
	You are a noble count so you don\'t need to worry about money. You
	haven\'t asked the captain yet to be allowed a place in front of the
	porthole in the air lock.

PIRATE

        Pirates are the scourge of the spacelanes. Whether operating in
large organizations or as independant vessels, pirate ships account for
siginifcant losses of cargo and ships.
        Most pirates are not the swashbuckling adventurers of holovid
legend. They are often desperate individuals, living on the fringes of
society, with no family or friends to speak of. Ruthlessness is a hallmark
of the successful pirate. Every now and then, though, you will run accross
the "gentleman buccaneer" type of pirate.
        Pirates often attack small unarmed merchant ships, or ships that
don\'t present much of a threat. Their high-G acceleration ships (called
"corsairs"; usually modifications of existing ship designs) are to allow
them to run away from the inevitable Patrol Cruisers and SDB\'s that show up
in response to their victim\'s distress calls.
ROUTINE TASKS: Attacking ships, stealing cargos, starting fights in cheap
starport bars, maintaining and operating ships, stealing ships, saying
"Arrrr" a lot for no apparent reason.

Reminds me of the time that I hit a squirrel with a round from a Barret
Light .50...  squirrel plasma..

My point about the gauss round hitting bone was that in a soft tissue hit,
the chances are high that the round will blow straight through with minimal
deviation/keyholing;  Hitting bone would likely shatter the offending
obstruction causing massive secondary trauma.

Shock waves and hydrostatic shock are secondary sourcs of damage at best,
the primary being the immediate destruction of tissue.

The gentleman in WWII was the tail gunner in a RAF bomber who decided that
falling 24,000 feet was preferable to burning to death.  He jumped out
without a parachute, and through an amazing series of factors (updrafts,
steep slope, heavy snow, fir trees to break his fall) had only a sprained
ankle and abrasions on his hands and face.. injuries sufferd *before* he jumped!

   In a conversation I had with a friend, he referred to T4 as "Vogue
Traveller" (in reference to the women\'s fashion magazine)--lots of slick
color illustrations, but very light on content.  While I\'m not sure that T4
is *that* light on content, when you compare it to TNE, T4 certainly makes
the TNE basic manual look like a college History text.

   Which is what Marc, Ken, et. al. were shooting for, or at least that\'s my
understanding of it.

   With a release schedule of one new sourcebook a month (shouldn\'t we have
seen the first one already?), loading up the basic set (actually book) with
background is unnecessary.  That having been said, it makes it imperative
that IG release new sourcebook material on Milieu 0 in as timely a fashion as
possible--as in when they say they are going to do it.  Forcing players to
wait month after month for material that was promised to them does not
encourage game loyalty.

   As for Vets, Milieu 0 makes the vast majority of your old material
irrelevant, or at least it does if you plan on using a setting in that
milieu.  If you plan on using some other milieu, there are the new game
mechanics, but little else of interest so far.

   By way of example, IMGGHO (in my gaming group\'s humble opinion), T4
currently lacks the depth of detail we are used to in our TNE games,
particularly when it comes to combat.  As we don\'t plan on using the Year
Zero milieu (we currently use the "Children of Earth: The Solomani Rim In the
New Era" material I\'ve generated), and we will not be using T4 game mechanics
until they\'ve matured a great deal more, my fellow gamers aren\'t exactly
breaking land speed records in getting to the local hobby store to pick up
T4, though I have purchased it and will be purchasing additional products for
use as source material for my writing.

>T4 is predominantly preaching to the converted.

   I disagree.  If it were, it would have been set in the Spinward Marches,
and it would have used a *slightly* revised FF&S as the basis for all
technology.  Instead, we are given some details on a completely new setting
aimed at younger players, and while parts of FF&S appear to be in use in T4,
it is a "dummied down" version, and some of the technology has been altered
(thruster plates, etc.) or ignored all together (cold fusion power plants at
TL 12, etc.).

>HERESY MODE OFF (Just call the fire brigade now)

   I would, except they won\'t respond to an e-mail address.  :-)

   After buying TNE and/or MegaTraveller and getting what amounts to the
basic and advanced rules up front, T4 does indeed seem like it is missing
something.  Vouge Traveller references aside, it\'s really not fair to do a
content comparison between T4 and the other systems, at least not until we
see more T4 sourcebooks with advanced rules published.  Expectations of
Traveller fans everywhere were raised to new heights when it was announced
that Marc Miller would be leading the effort to revive Traveller (actually
he\'s more the power behind the throne than the king).  It is probable that
your expectations were raised as well.  Actually seeing T4 now has brought
you back to reality.

        The system seems to be based in the velocity you get when you use fuel.
If a starship uses 1G-turn of aceleration during one turn it\'s moving at a
velocity:
        v = a*t = 9.8m/s2 * 1800 s = 17640m/s = 63500 Km/h = 30000
Km/halfhour (aprox)

        So when you use 1GTurn in 1 turn you get a final velocity of 1 hex/turn
        But as you said the starship has only travelled 1/2 hex. For
simplicity in the game they have decided to count the full hex moved. Thats
the same as considering the acceleration has taken full efect in the turn
it\'s being aplied as in the CT rules is said.

        And note that when you aply 1Gturn the distance travelled depends
on the way you have accelerated (constantly or not) while the final
velocity is totaly determined by the number of Gturns expended.
        If the starship whoud have expended the full G-turn very fast at
the begining of the turn ( with 6G during the first 10 minutes for example)
the final velacity would be the same but it would have travelled nearly one
hex.

The sentient Dolphins in Traveller were genetically engineered by the

In a word, why?  I\'ve always hated such artificial rules.  Is a person
with a pacemaker or an artificial knee-joint less human than one without? 

These rules exist in CP and SR because there needs to be some limit on
keeping PCs from becoming deadly Robocop-like hulks.  If the social system
and medicine of the Imperium is not set up so that numerous people want to
be robocop-like hulks, and if doing so earns you stares of disgust and
fear then artificial limits aren\'t needed. 

"You aren\'t comin\' into this bar, you clank when you move, and you look
like trouble." and similar comments, can swiftly discourage going
overboard with cybertech.  However, a neural jack or one or two other
discrete implants would add to many characters.

Capn\'! Capn\'! Canon off the Starbd Bow!"

	Several entries in Survival Margin mention salvage crews swarming in 
after large battles to pick over the wreckage.  In fact, during the 
later parts of the Rebellion, there were several TNS reports of 
salvage crews being fired upon by Naval vessels, basically, in 
competition of the wrecks (AKA Spare Parts)

	Also, old obsolete ships will abound.  There is no reason to believe 
that the Imperium is all like modern day \'use it up then bury it\' 
USA.  Far more likely, given the costs of a new ship, buying old 
creaky and in dire need of repair will be the only way most people 
ever own their own ships.

	For a good idea of the range of transport on this planet, watch the 
PBS series \'Michael Palin\'s Around the World in 80 Days\'; our local 
public library has copies to check out.  He crosses the Indian Ocean 
on a commercial dhow.  TL-3, maybe! No radio, no radar, no head 
(there is a plank sticking out of the side of the ship with a hole in 
the far end, and Palin had dysentery for part of that trip!), a sand 
filled pit with a fire in it for a galley.  This is a major form of 
merchant traffic in the Indian ocean, too.

	Actually, it wasn\'t TL-3 at that...it did have a diesel auxilliary 
engine, making it TL-5, but most of the trip was covered under sail, 
since the mechanic was repairing the engine most of the time.

	There are a number of them being built that have no engine, just 
sails.  Wind, after all, if free.

	The last time this came up on the list (I think it was sometime
around December 95), Andy Lilly (I believe it was him...) posted a
delightful TL-12 design for a Naval refuelling tanker called the
Orrimot...jump tapes, hamstercages and all.

	This led to an interesting discussion of who would use such 
things...and the answer was, the bannana boats, the copra boats, the 
tramp spacers, or the neo-hippies travelling the galaxy in a wildly 
painted one called \'Furthur\'...

	My Imperium\'s going to have such critters, just to keep the local 
color up.

I would say the art is good, but it seems like too much.  This is one of my
  problems with the book.  I counted at least 36 full page illustrations, out
  of 190 page book.  This is nearly 20% of the book being art - pretty, but
  ultimately useless for gaming.  That is not even counting the illustrations
  of ships and weapons, which are not completely useless.  I would have rather
  seen about 10-15 pages of art and 20 more pages of material.

I get the feeling that there is something missing.  What\'s worse, I get the
  feeling that it is *intentionally* missing.  I\'m not saying that is what
  happened, but that\'s how it feels.  It seems like the book is saying "Here
  is the bare minimum of ship construction rules... Want more?  Buy our next
  book."  "Here is the bare minimum of campagin background... Want more?  Buy
  our Milieu 0 book."  Etc. with alien rules, equipment rules, and so on.
  It just gives the feeling of trying to generate further sales of sourcebooks.
  I\'m all for good sourcebooks, I just don\'t like feeling like I *have* to buy
  them to get a complete game.

I would agree with this, except that the rules don\'t seem complete either.  
  You can have a basic set light on background if it is heavy on rules; but
  this set seems light on both.  Those of us who are familiar with the system
  can "fill in the gaps", but I would be curious to see how people who have
  never encountered Traveller before are handling it...

I also am glad to see the Traveller name back on the shelves - don\'t get me
  wrong.  I think it is an improvement over the basic set in terms of
  complexity - it just seems a little light when compared with today\'s games.

Thanks for listening to my comments.  (Assuming that you did.)

They are poorly worded, not artificial
People with any replacement parts go through therapy to learn to live with the fact that 
they are not 100% human (we try to tone it down by calling it adjustment but it is a fact 
that people regard any flaw as inherently dehumanising, even something as simple ( and 
necessary) as eyeglasses)
However the typical result would not be the psychopathic killing machine but rather the 
clinically depressed semi-human

According to my CT set:

\'There are two bis (meaning second, or improved) models of computer 
available. Each is treated as the next higher level for jump support, 
but as the next lower level for software selection\'

This is actually what the \'bis\' in modems means as well, v32 is 
9600baud, while v32bis is 14400baud. v34bis will be an improved 
version of the v34 standard.

  Dear Diary,

  Called IG from work today - WI Bell finally had listing
  (414-249-9430)!  Asked friendly young lady about T4 HB, when?
  She said was putting labels on "as we speak", going out
  PrioritySnail. Goodygoody!  Mentioned inability to get thru;
  she apologized, explained abt move; didn\'t get reconn till
  9/25.

  Also asked about JTAS - going to printers soon; expect subbers
  to have mid Oct, stores end Oct.  Asked for KW et al to keep
  TML up to date re product releases; asked for KW, MM to visit
  FT pages and give feedback.  She said would pass msgs on.

  Feedback last couple nites re FT - must change color of
  unfollowed link!  Otherwise, gen\'ly + recept.  Lots of comps
  on Chris Cox\'s logo; must thank him.  Again.

Michael is German (I presume), and I think some things occasionally don\'t get 
translated into English -- although he does a fairly decent job most of the 
time.  Unless there is an alternate Vrage (sometimes he says Vrag) I think he 
means Vargr -- if otherwise, then please excuse my presumption, folks.  

At any rate, I\'m glad we on TML don\'t get into lengthy discussions about

I think that this shows a fairly limited experience with the world, it may be 
that you are young.  People who lose a limb don\'t feel "less human" because 
part of their anatomy is missing.  They may experience a trauma, but their 
humanity is more than their mass.  With your logic it would seem that a 6\'7" 
tall person is _more human_ than someone who is 5\'11".

The therapy that folks go through is as much to learn how to use the 
artificial device and to heal from any physical trauma associated with it.  
The psychological trauma is no doubt extremely difficult to overcome, but a 
patient in such cases is NOT semi-human!

While I do not wear prosthetics I do wear eyeglasses; and your words to the 
effect that they are dehumanising is ridiculous.  Am I suddenly "semi-human" 
because I wear metal frames set with lenses on the bridge of my nose?  (...I 
am not an animal.... I am huuuman...!").  What about folks who have to wear 
braces on their teeth?  Do they take a vacation from the human race for a 
while?

That makes sense to me.  Does anyone have any objections to allowing the 
winner of initiative to choose which side goes first?

Hmmm.  Simultaneous movement....probably beyond the scope of the RPSC 
rules..but it has definite promise as an optional rule.

History: Archon Song was given to the Purple Wind Monastary by his parents. 
The Monastary raised him, and upon turning 18 he joined the temple guard.  
Here he served with distinction for 16 years.  Late in 1201, he got into a 
fight with a fellow guard, over a bottle of whiskey, the argument turned 
physical, and Archon ended up killing the guard.  The monks, sentenced 
Archon to exile, he would never be able to return to Spires.  He regrets his 
action, and accepts his punishment, he has taken a vow to never 
kill another human being.  He has taken it upon himself to wander the Galaxy,
spreading the word of the Purple Wind Monastary, maybe one day he will
settle down and form a new monastary, but for now he wanders and always 
preaches the evils of violence.

Hi Joe,

I got my hard-bound copy of T4 today as well, however mine was not signed.
Did I misread the web site?  I thought they said that all the first printing
hard-bound books were to be signed.  Hmm...  Anyway, I\'ve written Imperium
Games about it.  Just asking...

Vernor Vinge wrote a novella, _True Names_, which predates Gibson by a
couple of years.  It\'s also a far more realistic view of what CyberSpace is
likely to be like.  The last time I saw it in print was in _True Names and
Other Dangers_.

Another good book from a technical point of view is _The Long Run_, by
Daniel Keys Moran.  I want one of his inskins, badly.  His PKF Elite are
also something I\'ve been waiting to inflict on some players for a while now.

  Here is a question for you guys...

  Instead of making the sand caster function in only one mode, why not set
up a secondary mode for it:

1) use as per normal rules

2) use as a floating armor

The use of option #2 is based on CT\'s version of Sand casters.  If you do
not make any course changes, and thus, no defensive use of MP\'s, then you
may use sand as add on armor.  The bad part of this is that your enemy
gets a bonus to hit due to the fact you are on a predictable courseline.
What sayeth thou?

Again, you misunderstood my words. The eyeglasses are a noticeable deficiency, as they 
show a weakness (eyes) which deep down frequently limits us. How many people with 
glasses take a smaller role in physical activity becuase their playmates see their glasses as 
weakness. Children spot this weakness quicker than adults and happily torment the 
wearer. Humans tend to associate weakness with weakness even if the two are not 
related

I have a mental picture of bulk carriers as large dispersed structures with
cargo modules, like a modern cargo vessel.  This allows for faster
turnarounds as well - jump in, take a day to drop off it\'s cargo mods and
pickup preloaded cargo.  Might as well make the drive systems and crew
areas modular as well, so you can easily upgrade within the spaceframe\'s
designed g-limits.  Makes for cheaper repair for the big corps as well - if
the j-drive needs major maintenance every X jumps, you can just unbolt it
and ship it to a high tech starport for depot maintenance.  If you\'ve done
the design right, you just take off a pair of adjacent cargo pods and you
don\'t even need a special ship to transport the offlined drive pod.  Once
the megacorp decides a module is too old, or just too lowtech, off it goes
onto the market.

I see some of the large tramp spacers as a century or two old frame with
modules of varying age and provenance.

The modular approach is also great for naval vessels - why not make all the
100ton bays and 50ton bays standardised modules?  Minor battle damage is
thus easily & quickly repaired at navy bases during wartime.

I\'m surprised that Pournelle isn\'t being mentioned more often - John
Christian Falkenberg is a major inspiration to me for Mercenary campaigns.
Prince of Mercenaries is especially relevant in a year 0 campaign.

I agree. One of the old JTASs (#22) had an article by W.H. Keith called
"Computer Implants" which describes some of the effects of being "jacked
in". He expands upon it greatly in his recent Warstrider novel series
(good stuff). I allow any PC to increase technical skills up to 4 levels
(TNE; 2 levels Classic) but if they want to link to equipment to control
it, they can suffer physical damage if the equipment is damaged.

gunner\'s brain...

As I understood it, everyone who placed their order for a hardbound by 
July 31 would get it signed by Marc Miller.  If the order was placed 
after that, then Marc wouldn\'t be signing it.

When did you place your order?

The referee of the campaign I\'m currently running in ran a short
campaign in which the PCs were citizens of a low tech world who know
_nothing_ about the Imperium/Regency.  They could throw spells ala D&D,
fight orcs, etc.  The campaign ended when they discovered they were all
actually androids on a Regency "theme park" world which had been taken
over by Virus.  All spell effects had a tech-based cause.  Great, great
fun when subsector naval forces landed to fight Virus and the players
were programmed to see them as orcs, dragons, etc.

Most modern assault rifles are in the 5-6kg range, but *machine guns* are a
different matter entirely.  From the 10kg M-249 to the nearly 20 kilo M-60,
machine guns are barely portable under the best of circumstances.

Take a good look at the laser rifle in comparison to the cR898 rifle -
better damage, longer range, at a relatively small increase in price.

Needless to say, once I get my hands on the design sequence (3G3 preferred),
I will design vast numbers of lethal goodies for my web site.

Hmmm.  Did you mean 08, or 07 as the month you ordered it?  Because if 
you meant 07, then I think your copy should have been signed (but I could 
be wrong - wouldn\'t be the first time[G]).

  On page 7 of the RPSC (using the word v.7), it states 

"A motionless ship (velocity of 0 hexes per turn) may change facing by
spending 1 MP which will allow a change to any facing desired."

  The problem I have with this is that a ship moving at a velocity of 9
gets to turn a 180 degree turn, and decellerate up to the max
accelleration rate of the ship - without having to pay any cost in doing
so.  Thus, a ship with a drive rated at 4g moving at a velocity 9 can in
one turn, decellerate to a velocity of 5, rather than a max decelleration
as implied by your rule that it takes a full G MP to turn to any hex
facing.  If I might suggest, unless the discussion regarding "slew rate"
comes into play, that any "facing changes" cost zero, while heading
changes cost either the current vellocity value, or 1/2 velocity assuming
a successful piloting roll.

Thus, the new ruling might read 

"A motionless ship (velocity of 0 hexes per turn) may change to any facing
without cost, just as a ship in motion may change to any facing without
cost.  It should be noted that a heading change is not the same thing as a
facing change..."

  The reason you might want to clarify this is due to the newer "facing"
hit location, as well as the ability to change the facing in which you
take your hits.  I am assuming that you must be facing in the direction of
the heading changes that you desire to make.  Here I am assuming that a
heading change by definition is:

HEADING CHANGE: the ability to change the velocity vector in some
meaingful fashion by use of MP.

FACING CHANGE: the bringing about of the "nose" of the craft to any one of
the six sides of a hex.  Could be done in preparation for the application
of a HEADING CHANGE, or as a tactical issue for either firing of weapons
or defending versus enemy fire.


  How quick does a facing change occur?  Can I move on a "heading" of A
(as per your diagram on page 7) at a velocity of 5, increase my velocity
by expending 4 MP to a velocity of 9, and then change my facing towards C
in preparation for the shot that will hit my weakest armored section of
the ship unless I change my facing to C?  Even if I don\'t have any MP\'s
left?

Yes, sort-of; the Keiths always did draw it that way.

On the other hand, I scaled a model of the Falcon, and it worked out to
about 314 displacement tons.  I used to have a complete set of Falcons (both
the stock light trader and the pirateship versions) for Classic Traveller.

I\'m not sure I understand what you\'re saying.  But, it seems that you 
are treating facing and heading in a different way than RPSC does.  In 
RPSC on page 7 it states, "Facing is the term used to describe the 
direction of travel."  Thus, RPSC does not allow for a ship to point its 
nose in a direction other than its heading.  Facing IS heading in RPSC.  
It\'s a simplification.

Hope this helps.  If I\'ve misunderstood you, please let me know and I\'ll 
try again. :)

Ah, I understand what you\'re saying now.  And the answer is: RPSC ignores 
the need to flip the ship 180 degrees in order to decrease velocity.  
Another simplification. :)

Perhaps it is an over-simplification?

Considering that each "turn" is 30 minutes, I don\'t think that the ability
to turn from a "facing" of "north" to "south" is all that difficult.  If
you have maneuvering plates set in the sides of the ship to help turn it
from side to side, it won\'t take 30 minutes to turn around.  As I stated
earlier, as turning from a full forward facing, and then turning around to
decellerate shouldn\'t cost a full g\'s worth of accelleration - especially
if it can be done in less than a 3 minute\'s time (which is about 1/10th of
a turn).

Solution: ignore the "cost" to turn in place.  Keep the cost to turn your
velocity vector from one "heading" to another as is.  If you want to make
the rules closer to reality regarding vector movement - limit the number
of hex-sides you can turn from 2 to 1.  This way, you won\'t be violating
the spirit of hard-core science too much.  On the other hand, being able
to make a sharp turn does add to the drama.  In this case, the ability to
turn more than one hexside at a sitting is either:

a) fun, and thus in the game for that reason, or
b) unrealistic, and forbidden.

PLayability verus realism - which?

 No, not at all. The fusion plants and computers alone would be worth

I think it\'s doable even in the basic rules.  Wildstar\'s phased movement is
the most realistic, but simply alternate movement, hex by hex, would work
OK.  Faster moving ships get a *real* advantage at the end of the turn, but
that needs to be played out a few times to see how it goes.

Long enough to develop some nasty edema on all unsuported skin. Ask
Col. Kittinger about what his hands looked like when he lost the gloves
to his altitude suit when exiting the capsule at 100,000 feet (capsule
was suspended from a balloon). The results aren\'t fatal, but resemble

If you are wearing a "skinsuit" (aka fancy elastic leotard) the answer
is quite some time.

Access to information (data) is easier *if* you have a good search
program. Otherwise you get buried in data. Calculations and the like
will be faster. 

Skills get *real* tricky. You can get "expert system" type stuff, but
*skills* are a different matter. What most of the cyberpunk stuff
overlooks is that any *physical* skill does *not* solely reside in the
brain. A lot of it is "muscle memory" (ie learned reflexes), and unless
you\'ve replaced the spinal cord and a lot of the sensor and motor
neurons that connect to it, you *can* use a chip to get that. 

So you can know *exactly* how to make that killing martial arts move,
but not be able to actually *do* it.

Also, you couldn\'t get me to touch a commercial "combat skills" chip
with a ten foot pole. Why? Because there might just be bugs or
backdoors. How\'d you like to be up against someone and have his AI
implant determine from your style that you were using a Ryko Industries
Model 5 mod 4 chip, and then proceed to nail you by exploiting a bug in
the routines. Or even just by knowing what your *programmed* response
to a sequence of moves would be?

And just think of the screams when a character discovers that the
combat chip has a "police override" that won\'t let them fight a cop. :-)

One story that players and refs should read, just to get the feel of
what things were like *before* thruster plates is "The Cold Equations"
by Tom Godwin (I think that\'s the author\'s name).

The plot is quite simple. A young girl stows away on a one man courier
ship carrying something important (vaccine for a plague?). Only thing
is, the ship doesn\'t have enough fuel to match orbits and land at the
destination with her aboard, so say the cold equations of orbital
mechanics. Thus the title. 

You\'ll have to read the story to find out how (or if) the problem is

Given the shorter time intervals involved, it\'s likely to be a case of
sealing the hatches first, then trying to rescue anybody inside who

Don\'t forget that suits don\'t have to be *quite* that cumbersome.
"Skinsuits" will be a lot easier to move around in, and the gloves will
be less bulky. 

The areas that keep atmosphere may run at reduced pressure. This
removes a lot of problems, but increases fire hazard due to the higher
percentage of oxygen required to keep the air breathable.

One *major* problem with decompressing a ship is the life support
system. Especially given that much of the life support system may *be*
alive (plants, some small animals). This is more likely to be a problem
on non-miltary vessels.

Re: the recent discussion of implants, jacks, prosthetics and other body
replacements and enhancements: seems to me that some TML posters are
perhaps basing their conception of these technologies on a couple of
William Gibson novels and a number of trendy but poorly-conceived games
based on them. To my mind, the exemplary cyberpunk exploration of these
themes was not written by Gibson, but by Bruce Sterling.

For inspiration in these areas, you can\'t beat Sterling\'s series of short
stories set in his "Shaper/Mechanist" universe, collected in _Crystal
Express_. Check these out, and if you like them, read _Schismatrix_, a
novel set in the same future history. All the stories and the novel have
are collected in one volume, _Schismatrix Plus_, a trade paperback due out
in North America next month (IIRC).

As for loss of humanity through prosthetic enhancement, Sterling\'s
characters would ask, "What\'s so great about being merely human, anyway?
Why limit yourself?" The Shapers and Mechanists represent rival ideologies
vying for control of the future evolutionary direction of the human
species. The relatively conservative Mechanists believe genes should be
inviolate, but are willing to extend their lives and abilities through
prosthetic enhancements of any kind. The radical Shapers design each new
generation from the genes up, willing to mess with their biochemistries and
neural wiring, whatever will give them the competitive edge.

Not surprisingly, some readers have trouble identifying with many of the
characters, who simply aren\'t human any more. They\'re evolving into
"clades", varieties of descendent species. While Terran society has turned
its back on both sub-species and has ossified, the space-colonizing
post-humans are no longer confined by old cultural, moral, or ethical
limitations. It\'s all rather Nietzschean and scary, but very plausible,
possibly inevitable.

The non-Imperium Traveller setting I\'m working on will include a variety of
post-human Clades, as well as entire cultures of sentient machines, clone
societies, Uplifted species (both Terran and alien), anagathically-enhanced
life spans, and sundry hybrids between. In a vast galaxy of inhabited
worlds, natural biospheres, synthetic ("Terraformed") biospheres, and space
habitats, there are ample opportunities for experimentation of every kind:
new technologies, new societies, new cultures, ideologies, bodies, minds.

This does present a lot of problems in game terms. Every change in the body
suggests a new variety of rules, character types, and background
implications. Every new culture requires some exposition and explanation,
and the action could grind to a halt while the players are brought up to
speed on each and every new planet. But, as you may have guessed from my
earlier list of favourite SF novels (few of which are very Travelleresque),
my taste in SF runs toward extrapolation of strange cultural possibilites.

Thus, I\'m looking forward to reading TML postings from anyone working on
Traveller rules for sentient machines, body mods, artificial life, extreme
longevity, cloning, etc., and their implications for Traveller societies.
As I work up my campaign, I\'ll be posting here anything I think might be
useful in these areas.

Basically, I\'m trying to push Traveller out of the realm of Golden Age SF,
where the future is essentially a re-run of the past wearing a spacesuit,
and into the world of contemporary, post-modern speculative fiction, where
the future is deeply strange and ultra-diverse, where the frontier is as
much within us as out there among the stars.

I\'ve been saying go for "fun and playable" over realism for weeks. A ship
should be able to turn to any facing in a small fraction of a 30 minute
turn, so for simplicity sake just ignore "slew rates" for RPSC.  

Of course, a turn to a different facing isn\'t the same as
accomplishing a change in course.  I\'ll defer to the team of
Wildstar and Walsh for that explainations of that. ;->

The fusion plant is likely to be pretty old and cranky. Not worth much.
Ditto for the computers. We aren\'t even talking about your typical
"tramp freighter" here, we are talking about the African Queen or
worse.

Pirates aren\'t going to be equipped to remove powerplants and
computers, they\'d have to take the whole ship. And that\'s not worth it.

There was a story in Analog a few months back that took the idea about
as far as it could go. But as I understand it, you *must* have a
registration number for your aircraft, just to file a flight plan.

Mechanics have to be certified to work on aircraft. There are various
sorts of certifications. "Airframe and Powerplant" basicly means that
the guy is certfied to be able to do a complete rebuild of the plane
without losing it\'s airworthiness certificate. If somebody else does
such a rebuild, an A&P certified person has to sign off on it stating
that the work meets the applicable regulations.

So if you have a "hulk" with a serial number that\'s still good, an A&P
can just "repair" it, and you can use the registration number.

If you have a sufficiently *flexible* A&P person (and they are willing
to risk getting their certification pulled) they can sign off on some
pretty amazing modifications as being "minor" (ie not requiring going
thru the process of getting things inspected and certified as ok by an
FAA engineer). The essence of the situation is whether or not the can
plausibly argue that the mods were allowable under the (rather complex)
regulations. If they get called on it, they get to argue things before
an administrative law judge, and he decides....

I\'m thinking of things like ships originally built to use rocket
propulsion (probably, nuclear, but still *still*) to do the equivalent
of haul stuff back and forth from the asteroids, or even haul stuff to
the outer planets. Ships like that would *have* to be huge (and not
dispersed). But when Jump drives come into use, they\'d be able to be
refitted for one easily enough, and since they\'d have *millions* of
tons of cargo space, why not?

The modular approach has the built-in disadvantage of needing a lot of
extra support structure to allow for the adding and removing of modules.

What you are actually describing are the equivalent of seagoing barges,
with tugs to move them. There are runs where that is done. And in
space, give the lack of storms, it\'d get done more.

For this, you\'d have "barges" which are a *huge* hull with nothing but
holds (or tanks), some minimal life support (maybe), a minimal power
plant (to help run the loading unloading gear, and a jump grid in the
hull. It\'d have fittings for a tug to clamp on and tie the grid into
the tug\'s grid. The hull won\'t be braced for more than a g or so, but
it\'ll be braced to take that with a full load, and do so from *any* of
the "clamps" for the tugs.

The tug would have a small crew, fittings to match the "barge", huge
fuel tanks, and ther biggest jump and manuever drives you ever saw!

Without a barge, a tug out to be able to jump half a dozen or more
times. And the only reason it can\'t accelerate at 50g or so is that the
grav compensators can\'t handle it.

Tugs can also be used (with care) to move asteroids or the like in
normal space, it\'s just that you have to rig a docking clamp for them
somehow.

I don\'t know if the ship design systems will allow such a tug, but if
they won\'t, I submit that they\'ve got some flaws.

Possibly not. The Starship Operator\'s Manual by DGP explains thruster
plate technology as being able to project its "thruster" effect through
a 360 degree sphere (including _through_ the starship its attached to
without damaging it).  This could be one explanation (uh...yeah, yeah,
that\'s it, that\'s the ticket...) but is it \'gasp\' canon?  If so, chalk
up a reason for selecting thruster plates over HePLaR.

	ok I hav\'nt uploaded it yet, but there is alot of more TNE

	a Jayhawk like far trader, which is under production since 1072

	It looks like a Jayhawk or Marava class on the first look,
	but tech level 13 offers a lot of tricks.
	Oh yes of course its capable for flying through the rifs.

Put a tiny laser on them. Even the threat of potentially EXPENSIVE damage
to a would be corsair is often enough to deter routing piracy.  A small
laser, one just big enough to do some damage, makes a potential target
MUCH less desirable.

I recommend looking over "Ringworld" and "Ringworld Engineers" by Larry
Niven and the Warstrider series by William H. Keith (of JTAS #22 fame, I
believe). Niven goes somewhat into the social effects of longevity while
Keith delves into the combination of man and machine.

Interestingly, I believe that the US Navy *still* has a large "National
Defence Reserve" fleet of (mainly) WW2 era Victory and Liberty ships in
mothballs at various sites around the US. AFAIR, some of these vessels
were to be reactivated for use in Desert Shield/Storm and actually were,
tho I recall that some of the older ships took longer to reactivate than
expected.

Assuming that the Imperial Navy is anything at all like the US Navy and it
will also have mothballed freighter equivalents sitting around somewhere.
And, of course, there\'s the evidence of the Scout Service allowing surplus
Type S Scout/Couriers to be placed in the hands of ex-Scouts ... and, it
is stated in a number of sources, there are lots of them sold into private
hands. Presumably a lot of Naval vessels that are basically freighters
will also be sold off into private hands when the navy decides that it
wants something newer and shinier - but, naval maintenance standards being
higher than civilian ones, they will be a significant bargain to anyone
who wants to buy them for civilian use.

True.

1.	LIBRARY DATA (A-M/L-Z) VS MT ENCYCLOPEDIA

The main differences are (1) new entries and (2) some minor tightening of
the text in the old entries.

I found this out when typing it all (well, most of it) onto the Amiga five
years ago. Belive me, I _know_.

2.	KIWI POLISH

My can of "Kiwi Neutral" says "Kiwi - Since 1906". Kiwi Australia is in
Warrigal Rd, Chadstone, Victoria (that\'s Victoria, _Australia_).

3.	GAUSS RECOIL

Tom Ellis said:
>Nobody ever said a gauss weapon was low recoil, they are quieter than
chemical powered

Maybe not in TNE, but the gauss rifle was _the_ weapon of choice in
MegaTraveller. One reason was that is was low recoil. I though that was due
to in-built recoil compensators (this is a TL 12+ rifle, after all).

4.	WEIRD UWP\'s

Charles Collin asked:
>2) What explanations for odd UWPs have you come up with in your games?
>What are your favorites from published sources?

The classic standard is "the planet has enormous [fill in appropriate type
here] resources and it was easier for everyone to live on-planet than
anywhere else".

The _best_ I have seen was the explanation for one of the worlds in
_Leviathan_. It was TL 1 but Atm 0 (or 1?). An article called "Aboard the
Leviathan" (_Space Gamer_ #40 [a special Traveller issue!], USA, June 1981)
provided an explanation. The natives were descendents of the survivors of a
starship crash. They lived in underground caverns with an "airlock" to the
surface consisting of hundreds of hanging blankets. Frozen air (a tribute to
Fritz Leiber\' brilliant "A Pail of Air") was brought in and left to sublime.
These kept in the air, to a certain extent. The natives had degenerated to
wild, carniverous humans.

...Oh yeah, the author\'s name is familiar: "Marc Miller"!

    'subj' => 'RPSC: Thoughts on Suggested Changes',
    'from' => 'Joe Walsh ransom@connect.iconnect.net',
    'body' => 'Hi,

There have been several changes and additions to RPSC posted to TML and 
GDW-Beta, and although I\'ve responded to some of them individually, I 
want to put my current thoughts on those subjects into this one post.  

First, though, let me say that I\'m saving all the RPSC suggestions and 
comments.  At some time in the future (when there has been a lot of 
discussion and suggestions), I\'ll review it all and make a final 
decision.

For now, though, I want to get my own thoughts out there.  I\'ll try to 
summarize each suggestion, then respond to each in turn. Here we go:


1)  Facing Vs. Heading:  

How it is now:  In RPSC, heading and facing are always the 
same.  That is, if you are moving in a given direction, the nose of your 
craft is always pointing that way.

The Facts:  This is unrealistic.  As just one example, in order to decrease 
velocity a HEPlaR-using craft actually would have to flip 180 degrees and 
burn in the opposite direction from the heading.

Suggested Change:  Make facing and heading two separate things.  Facing 
changes should cost 0 MP.  Leave the cost of heading changes as they are.

My Comment:  While that is more realistic, it takes away from the 
tactical fun of the game, IMO.  The damage effects system uses hit 
locations, and an armor value for each.  Keeping the 
most-vulnerable/most-damaged side away from enemy craft is a real 
challenge when facing=heading.  If facing changes are separate from 
heading changes and cost nothing, every ship will spin to keep the 
least-damaged side toward the enemy.  This would decrease enjoyment of 
the game, IMO.
Also, it adds another complication - something else to keep track of.  
Presently, everyone knows where his ship is heading by simply looking at 
the figure; it\'s heading in the direction the nose is facing.  If we make 
facing separate from heading, then heading will have to be kept track of 
by another counter or by notes on paper.  I\'d like to keep the 
record-keeping down.


2)  Ablative Armor:

How it is now:  Armor ablates (that is, the armor value is depleted) 
based on the damage value of the weapon.  Once all armor on a side is 
gone, further hits to that side do interior damage.  

The Facts:  Armor shouldn\'t ablate so easily.  While it is certainly 
possible to blow away enough armor to affect the overall effect of armor 
on a given side, it isn\'t as easy as the armor ablation rules make it.

Suggested Change:  Get rid of armor ablation by weapon damage rating.  
Make armor ablation one of the critical hit results.  Divide USP armor 
values by 10 (to get them back to the FF&S armor values T4 armor values 
are based upon).  When a weapon hits, compare the weapon damage rating to 
the armor value.  If greater, do an internal explosion.  If lesser than 
or equal to, do an external explosion.  Don\'t subtract the weapon damage 
ratin from the armor value.

My Comment:  The T4 ship design system, and thus all T4 ship USP\'s, 
include the increased armor values based on the idea of armor ablation.  
In other words, armor ablation seems to be part and parcel of the T4 
starship systems, whether ship design or combat.
While I lean towards wanting to get rid of armor ablation for 
simplification reasons in addition to realism, I don\'t want to make that 
great a change from T4\'s approach to starships.  Changing the BSCS rules 
is one thing, but ignoring the principles underlying the ship design/USP 
system is another.
However, if IG has re-thought this and Starships comes out with a system 
that doesn\'t use armor ablation, I\'ll almost certainly make this change 
to RPSC.

3)  Initiative

How it is now:  The initiative winner moves and fires first.

The suggestion:  Let the initiative winner decide who moves and fires first.

My comment:  It\'s more playable, and it isn\'t a complication.  Makes 
sense.  It\'ll be changed.


4)  Movement and Firing

How it is now:  One side does all its movement and firing, then the other 
side does all of its movement and firing.

The Facts:  In real life, of course this wouldn\'t happen.  Everything 
happens at once.  

The Suggestion:  Either structure the movement and firing systems 
similarly to how it was originally (every action has a step, and task 
forces alternate in performing each step:  one side moves, then the other 
side moves; one side fires, then the other side fires; etc.), or make a 
partial movement/firing system wherein everyone moves one hex, then 
everyone fires, then everyone moves another hex, then everyone fires, etc.

My Comment:  In a game, no matter what, you\'re going to have to do things 
differently than they\'re done in real life.  Games need some sort of 
structure, and real life (especially combat - whether on the ground or in 
space) has little of that.  The difficulty is finding the right balance 
of realism and playability to achieve the _feel_ you want your game to 
have.
I think the way RPSC handles movement and firing right now is right for 
the purpose of RPSC.  But, that may be simply a reflection of my own 
role-playing style.  It\'s the way my group has always done it, in fact, 
since we\'re not wargamers.  
I think that this issue is one that will be resolved only after many 
detailed alternatives have been put forth, and each has been widely 
playtested.  So, if you have an idea in this area, write it up as a rule 
(and consider all the other aspects of RPSC that will be affected and 
write them up, too) and share it on the mailing list.  Then we\'ll find 
out what others think of it.
Those who don\'t want to write up rules are encouraged to offer their 
support for one methodology or the other (in this and all areas under 
discussion, as a matter of fact).  
We\'ll see what comes of this discussion.


Thank you all for the comments (and keep \'em coming!),

they can benefit from your idea.

The sandcasters rule that is being discussed is a good example of this.  
In fact, early on in the design of RPSC it used a system whereby launched 
canisters effectively added armor to the ship (but only vs. beam weapons 
such as lasers, of course).  For role-playing purposes, we decided to 
change it.  The change made defensive gunners far more important (and I 
want EVERY PC, no matter what position, to feel important during the 
battle if at all possible).

While I\'d rather not have the "official" version of RPSC use two 
different rules for sandcasters, individuals are certainly welcome to 
change it in their own game - as with any other part of the system.

I would think a more suitable location would a LaGrange point around a
planet or gas giant.  In this way the ships would be reasonably close at
hand but far enough away to avoid them being in the way of regular system
traffic.  Being in the LaGrange points they will tend to stay put and you
wouldn\'t have to worry about orbital decay at all.

In fact it leads to some interesting adventure possibilities...  Hiding out
from pursuit from Pirates/Authorities in the graveyard, transporting hulks
from dirtside to storage, scavenging needed parts for a repair in an
emergency, etc...

A couple of things that I remember reading ten years ago about WWII was that:

A) For at least a portion of the war the British did not equip their
paratroops with a reserve parachute.  The cost/expense of a piece of
equipment that was 99+% of the time not used was deemed to be a "luxury"
and unnecessary considering the shortages of material at the time.  The
lack of a reserve \'chute was deemed just another of the risks that the
paratroops had to bear...

Cold?  Yeah, but the Brit\'s apparently weren\'t the coldest...

B) I remember reading that the Russians during the heights of winter would
bundle paratroops in the slowest flying aircraft they could find and the
planes would swoop in as low and slow as they could and the troops would
jump off into the snow drifts...

As I said it\'s been ten years or so since I read about this and I do not
remember the book\'s title or author, so I would not consider it "canon".
It sounds almost unbelieveable but still reasonably plausible in a crisis
situation.

admittedly based on the order of turn in BRILLIANT LANCES.

1. LAUNCH PHASE
        Launch any small craft and all missles. This allows them to move on
the turn they were launched. Targets must be declared for missles at this time.

2. INITIATIVE
        Each side rolls 1d6 and adds the ship commander\'s tactics (or
leadership, if you prefer) skill. High roll is the winner.

3. MOVEMENT
       The side that lost initiative performs all movement. Then the side
that won moves.

4. SENSOR PHASE
        Sensor status (Active or Passive) is declared. Then detection rolls
are made (this produces the "bogies"). Then locks are rolled. Both of these
are only done once per battle unless a.) the target is destroyed, which
produces a "white out effect that cancels any locks in the LOS of the other
ships or B. ) the target is hit by missles, producing a small white-out that
just breaks the locks on that ship.

5. FIRE PHASE
        Both sides declare what weapons they will fire and what defenses
they will use. Fire is conducted and damage assessed. Fire is simultaneous.

6. DAMAGE CONTROL PHASE
        Both ships attempt damage control as needed.

Start again and continue until somebody goes boom.

Transhumanist Traveller, I love it!

I\'d be very interesting in a discussion of such variant Traveller games. 
I\'ve often thought about trying to run such a game, but the problem I\'ve
found is that the setting can be simply too alien for many players.  As
for literary inspirations, I strongly recommend (in addition to the
Shaper/Mech books): 

All of  Gregory Benford\'s "galactic core" novels:

The Great Sky River, Tides of Light, Furious Gulf and Sailing Bright
Eternity. 

Also try Eon and Eternity by Greg Bear and Michael Swanwick\'s novel Vacuum
Flowers. 

So, how would you run a post-human game which players can truly grasp and
be a part of?  I\'d also love to see some more of your ideas on what such a
setting should be like. 

I recommend that nanotech be avoided in such a setting.  It has the
potential to very easily become the "everything device" and make most
gaming scenarios rather pointless.

If you\'re talking 3 minute turns it is, but with a 30 minute turn it
shouldn\'t really matter.  How much time does it take a ship to slew 60,
120, 180 degrees?  We\'ve got to be talking about turning rates not much
worse than 1 degree/second, right?  At 1/second a 180 turn is 3 minutes.

It\'s probably not, but it still looks good to me, <g> and solves the
problem.  The ship can physically turn at it\'s leisure, but the *thrust*
changes vector instantanously.  BTW, I know what kind of problems that
would be for the bracing in the ship, but you could either ignore that or
"hand-wave" it away by saying that TPlate ships have 360 degree braceing
built in.

Very good. <g>

I believe they said that they were going to take orders up until June 30
for the limited edition "signature" series hardbacks, but wouldn\'t be

Best check your credit card statement Jerry...

I ordered by phone back in May when they first put up their web 
page...  At that time they were saying they would bill at end of July 
for the things.  My Visa statement showed them billed on July 25th.

I can\'t say for credit cards, but I paid by check and IG cashed it sometime
around the first of July.  I got the canceled check back with my bank

months..<grumble grumble>..and I haven\'t gotten squat.

I checked my other hardback, and it has that sheet only once.

Both copies have a boo-boo on page 12: the title "What\'s in this Book"

since it is in both copies, perhaps the plate was messed up somehow?).

Finally, on pages which face B&W illustrations, and the page facing the

This is true for both copies.

These errors, combined with the lengthy delay, makes me hope IG will use 
a different printer for future products.  Or, if they must use the same 
printer, I hope they are very careful about checking the products before 
they ship them.  (I\'m not trying to heap more abuse on IG, by the way -

It\'s a simplification.  In RPSC, we treat the ship as if it was always
facing in the direction it is moving, just because it\'s easier.
It\'s more fun to have firing arcs and damage according to arc, so RPSC uses
those, although (strictly speaking) the ship\'s facing is frequently not the
same as it\'s direction of travel.

The 1MP cost for a motionless ship to turn to any facing is in there to
prevent abuse of the turning rules.  If a motionless ship were allowed to
change it\'s facing to any point desired, as often as it wanted, there would
be a great advantage to being motionless.  This wasn\'t desired, so a simple,
easy-to-play limit was put on it (and tying the cost to MP means that ships
with bigger drives can turn more often, and ships with dead maneuver drives
can\'t maneuver, even in place).

As Joe states in the introduction, the point of RPSC is to have a relatively
simple, easy-to-understand, and fun and quick to play rules set.  If the
choice was between playability and realism, then playability is in, and
realism is out.  In particular, a great many parts of the RPSC movement
system don\'t really correspond to physical law, but _do_ roughly (sometimes
_very_ roughly) approximate it most of the time.

There _will be_ rules systems for Traveller space combat that accurately
account for the ship\'s facing as separate from it\'s velocity.  These rule
systems will specify how much, and how often the ship gets to change it\'s
facing.  These rules will also have a lot more rules, and be a lot more
"boardgamey" than RPSC.

No, you can\'t.  In RPSC movement, your heading and your facing are always
the same.  It\'s a simplification meant to keep the game more playable.
If it bugs you too much, try using the Mayday movement rules - which are
much more accurate, but require three counters for every ship on the board,
and a lot more bookkeeping.

Same here. I\'ve been in this hobby longer than most of my _adult_ players have been 
alive; started playing AH wargames in \'68 -- almost thirty years ago, and I\'m 37. I 
also have teens in this game who are younger than CT, too ;)

I\'ve gotta agree here. Pournelle\'s entire Falkenberg "series" is excellent fodder for 
even an _Imperial_ campaign what with the CoDominium and the relevant Laws of War. 

How \'bout SM Stirling\'s _Go Tell The Spartans_?

The major literary inspiration in my RC campaign was _Starship Troopers_. I made it 
_required reading_ for my players much the same way muchkin D&Ders make the Forgotten 
Realms and DragonLance novels important guides to orienting the 
players. They grew to appreciate power armor and meteoric assaults! I also drew upon the 
two novels GDW managed to publish for direct inspiration, and FASA\'s _BattleTech_ for a 
fine old time on the Viral hell of Promise (a Virus-controlled BattleMech, anyone?).

A Wolfie\'s reaction to Traveller (I was there!):

"What? No Nature/Demeanor rules? No Merits and Flaws? And I wanna play a suffering 
_Artist_, not some kind of technogeek driving a space-truck! \'Pay the Bills or Starve,\' 
my ass! I wanna wear lots of black, look cool and rip throats!"

Nuff said. There _is_ a generation gap in the hobby. 

Well, for those sf gamers looking for pretention in their sfrpg, the Kings of Pretense, 
White Wolf, are going to produce a series of sf storytelling-type games starting next 
year. All I can say is: be afraid; be very afraid.

The disgusting details are on the Wolfie\'s web page. I won\'t pollute the TML with it\'s 
URL; if you want to see it, fine.

There\'s also another product out already: _Fading Suns_. _FS_ is by a couple of 
ex-Wolfies. It is full of World of Darkness-like factions (clans), history/background, 
and the same kind of stuff you\'d see in a WW game (yep, I\'ve played Those Games -- just 
so I could have an _informed opinion_ of them). Technology is gone over very lightly, as 
are ships and the other hardware so beloved of Trav fans; the focus is on people. Space 
travel is via stargates. There is an Imperium that makes our beloved(?) Third Imperium 
of 1116 looks like One Big Happy Family. Religion is a significant factor; the Church is 
as riddled with factions as the nobility. The feel I get is one that resonates with me, 
that of Byzantium. A powerful empire built on the ruins of an earlier, greater 
Empire, one wracked with dissention within and threatened by alien invasion while a Dark 
Age threatens the galaxy.

The mechanics of FS _very closely_ resemble those of the Storyteller System. If you 
don\'t know the system -- good for you.

Why not?  Given the high cost of ships and ship components, I would assume
that pirates _would_ remove the more valuable bits, unless they were
deliberately leaving the ship intact so that they could steal from it again
in the future.  Even if the whole power plant or computer isn\'t worth/easy to
remove, some bits of it will be. (I\'ve had the strangest stuff stolen from my

	It would also be nice to have a Postscript subsector header
	file, so that a :

		cat traveller_sub.ps lunion.sec | lpr

	would print a subsector. As anybody written such a postscript
	program ?  Or has anybody written a C program which converts
	a dgp subsector to postscript ?

	The first one would be more portable, as the header interprets
	the dgp file to draw the hexes. But the later would also be
	ok.

<grin>  I ref\'d _one_ session with a couple of bohemian-types, y\'know what I\'m 
talking about, goatees, body-piercing, lots of D&D, Ars Magica and "Vampire 
the Mass-Parade" playing.  I like it when my players add some input into the 
game (I think someone called it "cooperative GM\'ing" or somesuch).  Anyway, 
these guys so defined their characters that I found myself making massive 
changes to the scenario just to oblige them.  I may be an old fart, but I\'m 
just not that used to wholesale sharing of background development with the 
players.  I usually like to create a scenario and drop them into it to see 
what they do.  What these guys wanted was to help develop the story themselves 
- -- it was wierd and not much fun.  We played an adventure, but definitely not 
the one I spent so much time developing.

I like the players to assist, but their suggestions and additions usually fit 
in the the game.

Yep, one of the guys wanted to work for a "house" (read: clan) and I gave a 
concession allowing him to work for a mega-corp.  He wanted to have all these 
special weapons and skills that, frankly, he wanted to lift right out of 
Cyber-punk.  It\'s also difficult to play with folks that are constantly 
comparing the various internal systems (combat, chargen, etc.) with those of 
other games.  I was distracted from actually "jacking in" to the game itself 
by the complaining, etc.  The other guy wanted to play a character who was in 
an organization that was a cross between the Cosa Nostra and, uh those 
Japanese gangs, I forget what they\'re called.  Before I knew it, we were 
sitting around the table speaking in our New York/Italian accents and using

Those sorts of things just would fit in my Traveller backdrop.  Part of the 
enjoyment is that there is no "cosmic" scale threats (except maybe 
taxation--<g>).  That is why I\'ve ignored activity on that scale since I 
recieved the JTAS issue about the 5th Froniter War and all subsequent events 
after that.

Actually, the rules say it a bit more clearly than that...

Anyway, as the 2nd die roll will ALWAYS be one or greater, the result is
that the chance to go skill level 7 is the same as that to get to skill
level 6 (e.g., a 6 on the first die roll) and all higher skill levels are
attained at 1 pip less on the die than they *should* be wrt the 1st 6 levels...

Suggestion:  Add 5 to the 2nd die roll (instead of 6) to keep things consistent.

many PCs with level 7+ skills, but I thought you might like to know...

whether to move first or last.

FIRING PHASE
        Weapons fire is performed according to initiative order; the winner
attacks first, followed by the loser. I do not advocate choice here,
especially if firing is not simultaneous; I can see no situation where
firing last would be advantageous.

In fact, each phase should be performed by both ships, rather than Task
Force A doing all their stuff and Task Force B doing all theirs. Everybody
moves, everybody performs sensor tasks, everybody fires. This reduces the
boredom factor of waiting for some slow guy to finish his complete turn
before you get to do anything.

My friend Ian has a book about Gurkhas, in which the following stories are
recounted:


A British officer, in charge of training some Gurkhas for a parachute drop,
was pleased to find a film in the base, so he showed it one evening.
Unfortunately, he hadn\'t previewed it first...  The opening scene showed
hoards of men leaping from airplanes, while a voiceover recounted "A
parachute attack. If you do your job properly, not one of these men will
reach the ground alive." and went on to describe all the ways to kill
parachutists.  Fortunately the Gurkhas\' command of plummy English wasn\'t so
good, they all signed up for parachute training because it looked like jolly
good fun!

Another British officer called for volunteers for a night raid, explaining
that it would be dangerous because they would be jumping from 300\'.  The
entire unit volunteered, but the senior NCO ventured that the men would feel
better if the plane was flying at 100\'. When the officer explained that the
parachutes needed time to open, the Gurkha NCO replied "Ah, parachutes. You
didn\'t tell us about the parachutes."

Then there\'s the story of an enlisted Gurkha who was separated from his unit
in the jungle and left "missing presumed dead". Not being dead, he set off to
rejoin his unit at their base camp, which was over a nasty range of
mountains.  When he arrived amid shouts of surprise, he explained that he
hadn\'t been worried because, like the officer, he had a map to follow, and
proudly produced a plan of the London Underground!

There\'s no unit like the Gurkhas for insane bravery, or (one suspects)
maintaining their reputation at the expense of their officers.

Wars, either, for the same reason: felt like a WW2 air dogfight.

At the cost of an extra counter per ship (not a problem with only a few
ships), this can be fixed.

The ship model represents current position, with its nose pointing in the
direction the ship is facing.  A future position counter represents the
ship\'s position next turn.  If the ship thrusts (changes the location of its
future position counter) then it must face in the direction of the thrust.

You do not need a past position counter (and we never bothered using them),
just use a die to mark model location, put model on future position counter,
project future position, remove die, and then thrust if desired.  The past
position counter just clutters up the playing area.

And of course, the fact that they\'re designed to take more damage than
civilian craft is a plus for folks trading on the frontier.  And while they
may disarmed, they do have hardpoints built in with power and data runs in
place, making it easier to add armaments later.

1.  What should I be on the look out for to add to my collection?  (IE, what

2.  Is there anything I can pick up for anyone and mail to you?  (Or if you
want a price first, I can do that too.)  eMail to:  tiger@datasync.com

I usually will only get to go to the store on the weekends, but the items
they had, they had a number of each one (they are a distributer after all).
Just as an example, I got one of the GDW books I have been looking for,
_Rebellion Sourcebook_ for under $15.00.

    'body' => '     After spending the past few days perusing the T4 softback that I
eventually broke down and purchased (2 days before the HBs shipped, but
I\'m not bitter because I realized that the people who mentioned the benefits
of having two copies- one to trash, one to keep nice, had a point), I\'ve
got a couple of questions/observations about TL\'s as presented.
     Firstly, I\'m working on the assumption that the 3I in year 0 is at
TL12 with a little bit of TL13, and that TL14+ are extremely rare to
nonexistent.  If I\'ve misunderstood something, please set me straight.
     The first issue is the Random PC Homeworld Generation tables, which
will have a significant portion of PCs coming from TL13+ worlds (I don\'t 
have the book in front of me to quote from, but the straight 2D roll goes
up to 12=TL 15 with numerous +DMs).  How does this mesh with the Milieu 0
setting, with its lower technology base?
     The second issue (same page) concerns the fact that PCs at TL7+ get
automatic skill in Grav Vehicle.  This isn\'t a simple typo \'cause it\'s
repeated at least one other place.  Unless I\'ve missed some pretty major
scientific advances in recent years, we don\'t have Grav Vehicles in RL, and
yet the US in 1996 is TL8 in most other areas.
     Then we come to the world generation chapter.  Admittedly, I haven\'t
looked too carefully at the chart, but it seems to be pretty much the same
as the standard CT/MT one, which produces worlds up to TL15, with occasional
TL16 thrown in.  This raises the same issue as the Homeworld Generation chart.
     Also, on THAT same page, is the chart with "descriptive" TLs, which
(seemingly directly from "The Traveller Book") lists TL7 as 1970-1980, TL8
as 1980-1990, and TL9 as 1990-2000.  This HAS to be a sloppy editing
mistake, \'cause there\'s no way we\'re in mid-TL9, especially if Grav Vehicles
have been re-assigned to TL7 (or TL8 as in the Ground Vehicles chapter).  
The definitions need to be re-worded to something closer to what (IIRC) 
MT had, with TL7 c1970-1985, TL8 1985-2000, and TL9 "21st century".
     While I\'m perfectly willing to write the last bit off as an editing
error, the other ones are a bit more problematic.  How should differing TLs
through history be reflected in the charts?  Should the referee, when
generating worlds, just decide to have TL13 be the absolute max, regardless
of dice results, should the charts be changed (which is really a non-solution
unless they plan to re-write them in every new Milieu book), or is there 
some other, obvious, solution that I\'m just overlooking?  Has this been
raised already?  If so, feel free to ignore (\'though if you could email me
a summary of what was resolved, that\'d be great too).

Liking what I see, but strongly considering telling friends to wait
until the 2nd printing to buy it,

intro to the Psionics chapter specifically mentions that Psionics are 
socially accepted in the early 3I, finding a Psionics Institute is just as
hard as in the 1100s.  Considering that we all (well, most of us) know all
about the Psionic Supressions and the [Hiver-type Manipulation, I can\'t think
of the specific word] therein, I began to wonder.  Is the book implying
that the Supressions weren\'t as big a deal as we\'ve been previously led to
believe, and that psionic study was never very common or socially acceptable,
or is this just another case of game-balance-concerns combined with sloppy
editing?  If the former is the case, it\'s very interesting; if the latter
(which I fear probably is), well, I hate to say it, but it seems to be par
for the course.
     As an aside, I don\'t want to seem petty or clutter up the list with
what\'s essentially useless, but is someone at IG keeping a record of all 
the typos and incidental mistakes in the T4 rulebook?  For example, in the
discussion of the TAS in ch 10 it mentions that membership can be given out
to Naval and Marine characters.  Of course, it can also be given to Nobles,
Entertainers, Agents, and Rogues.  Nothing big that should cause anyone major
confusion or make the game less playable, but nevertheless stuff that should
really be cleaned up in later printings.
     Lastly, I got to wondering about T4 deck plans, such as will presumably
be included in "Starships" (and other future supplements).  Will they be
newly designed to match the ship illos by Chris Foss (and lend Milieu 0
distinction) or will they be reprints of the same things we\'ve been seeing 
since "Traders and Gunboats"?  While presumably (hopefully!) it\'s too late
to do anything about "Starships," I want to state that I really hope for the
former: publishing sets of deck plans that are not only repeats but also
visually incompatible with the "official" ship designs would be a very bad
move by my reckoning.  I know that a lot of potential naysayers (on USENET
and possibly lurking here) are putting a lot of weight on "Starships" as
a measure of Quality Control and I don\'t want to see them given any freebies.
     Lest I begin to seem like one of those aforementioned naysayers, I\'d like
to state for the record that, all typos and sloppy errors aside, I really
like the new book, and am particularly enamored with the char-gen system.  
I created a sample PC last night and had loads of fun seeing a wonderful
personality develop over the course of the die rolls (I don\'t know how good
a PC my college flunk-out, fired agent noble with high skills in Equestrian,
Fencing, and Carousing but mediocre in all other respects would be, but I
absolutely fell in love with him and plan to make him a recurring NPC if
nothing else!)

It\'s against the law to charge your credit card if the item isn\'t
delivered in under 30 days. So the ethical mail order outfits don\'t
submit the charge until they ship the item.

Jump tapes are precalculated jumps between systems, available for a
small price. They let you make jumps with a computer system not capable
of doing jump calcs.

Hamstercages probably refers to rotating ship sections that provide
gravity via centrifugal force.

Those are slightly different. They are there so that the armed forces
can ferry troops and equipment overseas in time of war. It can\'t be
done via airlift, and we can\'t rely on what\'s left of the US merchant
marine fleet (we have *damn* few ships left with US registry, most have
foreign registry, and thus can\'t be nationalized in time of war).

Only trouble is, the Lagrange points require either a *huge* moon, or
they are an orbital radius away. That\'s a long, long ways. For example,
the *Earth\'s* trojan points are 1 AU ahead and behind us in our orbit.
That\'s a long way to go at 6g, much less 1 g (28 hours at 6g).
Jupiter\'s are much farther.

And in systems where they are practical, they\'ll be valuable locations,
just like synchronous orbit is. So the junk yards won\'t be there.

Contrary to popular belief, most orbits are quite stable. As long as
there\'s no atmospheric drag, and it\'s something like a gas giant\'s moon
system (all those moons make the orbits of smaller object really
complex).

There\'s a story about the Ghurka units in the British Army. Seems that
one time someone wanted to demonstrate how fearless they were, and
asked for volunteers to jump from a copter at 1000 feet. Only half the
Ghurkas volunteered. And the Sargeant Major (also a Ghurka) approached
the officer apologizing for the men, and asking if the altitude could
be lowered to 500 feet. The officer said "But that won\'t give you
parachutes time to open!" The Sar-Major brightened up and said "We get
parachutes? Then all the men volunteer, Sir!"

These days that\'s a *standard* trick. You open the back of a low flying
plane, fly along at 30 feet or less, over a semi-soft surface
(grasslands, bruch, etc) and jump and roll. 

It\'s *not* as hard as it sounds. I\'ve jumped from a trailer that was
moving at 20 mph (or more) onto a gravel shoulder. My "protection" was
a heavy coat and a pair of jeans. I didn\'t even get bruised. With
training, it\'s not as bad as it sounds.

I\'ve seen film of Navy Seals in full scuba gear jumping out of a
*moving* plane into the water. Likewise for Special Forces (or some
similar group) doing it from planes onto your typical scrublands.

People do. It helps to remember two things. First, that it was an
*emergency* run. Folks willreally push saftety margins when doing
things like delivering badly needed medicine, or trying to rescue
someone. 

Second, I seem to recall that the ship did have a safety margin.
Unfortunately, that got used up during the *launch* thanks to the
stowaway.

It\'s sort of like hijacking a truck and stealing the engine. It\'s
messy, it takes time, it occupies a lot of space, and in the end, the
price you\'d get for it isn\'t worth the hassles.

Also, there\'s the problem I only realized today. You have to *disable*
(destroy or at least badly damage) the drive to be able to board the
ship. That eliminates *that* from salvage considerations.

As for the powerplant, since it was kludged on later, first you have to
*find* it, then you have to determine how to "un-integrate" it from the
ship. Remember, this is a haywired rig.

On a more current ship, you\'ve got the problem of removing the item.
The ship will have been built *around* the powerplant. 

The engines in a modern freighter are worth quite a bit. But they are
*not* worth the hassle of trying to get them out of the hull unless you
are at a shipyard. The parts that come loose easily are the *cheap*
things. The expensive parts are the massive gears, turbines, and
castings that hold things together.

And on the old relics I was talking about, for all a pirate knows, the
powerplant is some really weird thing the owner managed to scrounge out
of something else. Since the ship is in no way "standard", that kinda
changes the situation. You don\'t know *what* to expect. Picture
discovering that the powerplant is a bunch of radio-isotope
thermoelectric generator units. A typical unit like that has a power
output that drops by half over a 50 to 200 year period. If you are
crazy enough, you can reprocess the isotope filler from a bunch of old
ones to get enough "pure" isotope to get a few of them back to full
power. As long as you don\'t plan on *landing* the thing there won\'t be
any problems getting it certified. If you do, you have to get the
casing certified.

I can see the pirates looking at this mess, and all the "danger:
radioactive material" signs, as well as the radiation counter cheerily
ticking away, and deciding that they\'ll let the guy *keep* his
powerplant! :-)

Or maybe he\'s using the fusion equivalent of some of the "portable"
generators like the Army uses for field hospitals. It\'s worth a few
grand, but by the time you figure the price drop for selling on the
blackmarket, you are back to having a *lousy* profit margin. 

Pirates can\'t afford to make attacks that net only a few grand. It
won\'t pay expenses. But the tramp captains can afford to haul cargos
worth tens of thousands, because their expenses are so low. They are
just making enough to get by, and pay for parts (very, very *old*
parts). 

Remember that anything a pirate gets is going to get sold at about 10%
of actual value. And "bulk" cargoes aren\'t worth stealing. When was the
last time someone hijacked a truckload of *paper*? Alcohol, cigarettes,
designer jeans, *those* get hijacked.

Actually, after thinking on it more, the drives/power plant are the
last thing the pirates would expect to salvage. Why? Because until they
knock out one or the other, how are they going to dock with the ship to
loot it?

*Destroying* a ship is easy. Merely disabling it is a lot harder. And
getting close to a ship that isn\'t disabled is a good way to get *your*
ship destroyed. There are an awful lot of cheap weapons that\'ll easily
kill a ship that has laid alongside you to board you.

Trent,

Remember that the T4 rule book is meant to be used with /all/ milieux, 
not just Milieu 0.  You should either apply some DM\'s to the various 
tables, or design new ones (perhaps, as you said, each milieu book will 
have its own set of such tables).

Like you, I don\'t believe these are fodder for errata.  It was 
intentional, as limiting the tables to TL12 would have made the book 
geared only to one milieu.  Since it covers TL\'s up to at least the Virus 
era, the T4 rule book will mesh nicely with many, many milieux to come.

Hope this helps.

	I realy like his 3d drawing, but I prefer more technical
	looking plans. I\'m also working on some deck plans (using XFig,
	transfig2gif and Netscape as a viewer) and I have an old
	deckplan for a Yacht form an old german fanzine. I think its CT.

	BTW CT, I\'m just working on the Marava and the Jayhawk 200t
	far trader, they have nearly the same design, but are quite
	different (if you compare Traders&Gunboats and Guilded Lily)

	Are there any other "canon" Jayhawk/Marava deckplans than
	these two.

I wouldn\'t say Tom is wrong, just old fashioned, like myself.  He\'s using the 
location of Vior as given in CT Adventure 4 Leviathan.  Hex 0805 would be it\'s 
position on the subsector map of Egyrn, as opposed to 1605 for it\'s location in the 
sector.

Naturally, I had to buy T4, but I have a question about the armour

Are the armour values for personal armour, vehicle armour and starship 
armour all the same scale? If they are, does this rally mean that I can 
blow holes through the skin of a Free Trader , armour value 0, with
a body pistol?
I ask because eventually my players will be asking me what happens

Sorry, Fritz, but I\'m unlikely to _finish_ anything before next week.  I
typically have an hour or so a week for drawing deck plans - just happened to
have a few more this weekend (which is, alas, nearly gone).

I guess I\'m trying to get a consensus on which order to draw the ships in
(keeping in mind I\'ll be using the CT/MT/TNE plans, not T4 which doesn\'t have
any yet).  I\'d like my first product to be useful to the most people.

Most of the stuff is the same; here\'s some information to get you started;
if you need more, don\'t hesitate to e-mail me (or the GDW-Beta list) with
more specific questions (please don\'t just post to the TML and hope that I\'ll
see it; I frequently just skim the TML if I\'m busy).

Armor: Divide the T4 armor value by 10 to get the Battle Rider armor value.
You can use the Brilliant Lances -> Battle Rider conversion chart to get an
idea of what the Brilliant Lances armor values are.  If you want specific BL
armor values for the hulls, here they are - from my QSDS spreadsheet:

Config	MaxG	Armor	StdTons
2 S	2	20	100
1 S	4	40	100
2 A	6	60	100
6 S	2	20	200
4 S	1	10	200
3 S	4	40	200
1 S	6	120	200
6 S	4	40	300
3 A	1	10	400
1 A	3	30	400
2 U	6	120	400
8 S	4	40	500
3 S	2	20	600
0 U	1	10	700
6 A	1	10	800
5 U	2	200	800
5 S	4	80	800
3 U	2	20	900
1 S	3	30	1000
1 A	6	60	1000
0 U	1	10	2000
8 A	4	80	2000
7 U	2	20	3000
4 U	1	10	4000
2 U	4	40	5000

Sensors: The sensor ratings (A# P# J#) are the BL/BR short ranges of the
Active EMS, Passive EMS, and Jammers respectively.  The hull size
restriction on the sensors was fudged to make the length and area work out
"about right" most of the time.

Computers and Electronics: Avionics and computers appropriate to the TL of
the rest of the design are included.  "Military" avoinics includes
fiber-optic computers; civilian ones don\'t.  The communicators suites all
include a radio (30kkm for basic and improved, 1kAU for advanced), a laser
(1kAU, basic and advanced only), and maser (1kAU for improved, two of them
for advanced).

Weapons: The weapons listings are all based on BL weapons (well, for the
most part), converted to Battle Rider with a mutated scheme.  First, the
weapon\'s damage value was found at 10, 20, 40, and 80 hexes.  If the weapon
was part of a multi-weapon battery, the damage was multiplied by the number
of weapons in the battery.  This value was converted to the Battle Rider
scale.  If the BR value was non-zero, then the ROF DM - 1 was added, and
that\'s the final value.

Here\'s a table from my spreadsheet, identifying the weapons and giving their
Brilliant Lances damage values at 10, 20, 40, and 80 hexes.

TL	Volume	Power	Area	Price	1.0 Ls	2.0 Ls	4.0 Ls	8.0 Ls
BB	10	6.806	20	11.46	39	26	13	7
CB	6	6.6665	20	3	39	30	15	7
B	3	2.2	10	2.08	20	0	0	0
C	3	2.66666	10	1.44	24	13	7	3
D	3	2.9	10	1.45	26	20	10	2
E	3	4.2	10	0.72	30	0	0	0
F	3	4.2	10	0.86	30	30	30	30

"BB" and "CB" mean TL-B Barbette and TL-C Barbette, respectively.

The Civilian lasers have ROF-50 (the low-powered ones at each TL) or
ROF-100.  The Military lasers are all ROF-100, and all batteries have a
beam Master Fire Director of the appropriate TL.

That should about do it -let me know if you have more questions!

Since I purchased the T4 rulebook yesterday I seem to have stumbled upon 
another omission not clarified in the official errata sheet.  In the 
chapter about World Generation at least one line seems to be missing from 
the Systems Contents Table.  The line for Naval Bases at the bottom of 
the table starts with \'Do not roll if starport C,\' and suddenly ends.  
Obviously something was truncated.  What is missing?

Another thing I was wondering about?  Is there any time during a trip 
from one system to another when the Astrogation skill would be used (to 
plot the course or something like that)?  Currently it seems to be pretty 
useless...

And yet another list of things I\'d like to have answered/covered in the 
errata:

* How is the target number for animal attacks calculated?

* Page 142, the section on Filters: \'ID\' probably should have been
  \'1D\' (in other places it is possible to differentiate between a 1
  and an I, so why not here?).

* The last word on page 146 is lacking a \'-\'.

* The trade and commerce rules nowhere mention the standard brokerage
  fees.  The example makes me believe that the fees would be 5% per
  level of the broker -- is that correct?

And a few other questions suggestions for later supplements and/or
printings of the rules:

* Are there any simple mass combat rules available for Traveller
  (e.g. to quickly handle boarding attacks, ...)?  Considering that
  many pages were partially empty it probably could also be fitted
  into the basic rules.

* One overview map of the empire would have been nice to get a general
  impression about the Empire (similar to the one in the Empire
  boardgame [is this the correct name?  In only own the german version
  of it]).  I really believe that this would belong into the basic
  rulebook.

Today I finally bought my softcover T4 book in my local rpg shop (over 
here in Germany).  I\'m currently reading it and having reached page 85 
would like to offer some more things to note in the errata:

On page 25 (right column, fourth term for Jamison) the example for the 
saving rolls for aging obviously is wrong.  In his fourth term Jamison is 
34, thus he\'d have to roll against a 3 with 2d6.  Given the numbers in 
the example his trength would drop by 1 point.

On page 27 there is a minor typo in the table for the military academy: 
the perseverance entry says \'DM +2 if Int 9+5\' -- the \'+5\' obbviously 
should be deleted.

On page 80 the weight for the laser rifle probably is a bit of (the text 
says that it weighs but 5 kg, which seems more appropriate).

Things I have been wondering about:

* How much can a character carry (I seem to remember reading Str times 5 
in kg but can\'t find it any more).

* What happens if a character with a non-military background is carrying 
more than Str * 2 in kg while in combat (or a character with military 
background carries more than Str * 3 in combat)?

* Where\'s the armor table?

* Why are there no more specific explanations for attribute values (e.g. to 
what social status does Soc value of 4 relate, ...)?  Very annoying.

I\'ll post my personal review and comments about the rules when I\'ve 
finished reading everything.  Right now my feelings are somewhat mixed, 
since the rules editing is pretty sloppy and (as was mentioned previously 
on the TML) the rulebook seems to be lacking a lot of information 
necessary to be able to run a game "out of the box" (especially for 
newcomers).  Several sections (including equipment and background) are 
simply too vague/short.

This is a review of Mark Miller\'s Traveller (Traveller 4th Edition; in
this review it will be referred to as T4).  I wrote it while reading
the sourcebook and afterwards changed nothing so you get my first-hand
impressions.  Especially the IG crew might want to read it since it 
mentions some problems not yet covered in the current errata sheet.

Some facts about me, the reviewer, beforehand: in 1982 or 1983 I
played in a couple of Classic Traveller sessions, but the campaign
died due to a variety of reasons.  Since then I remember Traveller
fondly and always wanted to start a campaign of my own.  My first
attempt to do this was with Traveller: The New Era, but since I hated
both the background and the rules I nuked this idea.  Now T4 provides
another chance to go for it and I\'m very excited about it.

First of all I\'ll summarize my general impressions (part 1) and
afterwards you\'ll be able to see my detailed comments and rants (part
2).  A summary concludes my review (part 3).


- ---- PART 1: General Impression

LAYOUT: Overall very clean, if somewhat sober.  For me a clean layout
is more important than a stylish but confusing layout (White Wolf at
times comes to mind).  One minor quibble: the page number is displayed
at the bottom of the page in the center, which makes is a little more
difficult to search a certain page than necessary (you have to see a
larger part of the page while flipping through the book).  Displaying
them at the outer side of the page would have been a better choice
(and as far as I am concerned I like page numbers at the top of the
page but that\'s a nitpickers\' detail).  Could have been done with
Winword the way it looks.
	In most (all?) sections the necessary tables are collected at
the end of the sections which at times makes it somewhat difficult
to reference them (especially since the tables are not numbered).  A
table of contents for the various tables would have been nice.  Also
this seems to be a modification applied in the later stages of
editing since some sections still refer to a table "on the next page"
(e.g. page 92, step 2).  Last but not least the tables are somewhat
arbitrarily ordered at times (not according to the order in which
they need to be referenced).
	Rating: 7 out of 10 (-1 for the page numbers and the missing
table index and -2 for placing the tables so far from the text where
they are referenced and the vague references [no tables numbers,
...]).

ARTWORK: I love the art of Chris Foss.  Great work.  I also was very
excited about Larry Elmore doing some of the interior illustrations
(he\'s my favorite fantasy artist), but to put it bluntly: I was
somewhat disappointed.  In contrast to his fantasy art the pictures in
several places lack a lot of detail and look like what I usually would
consider to be "better Elmore sketches", but not full-grown Elmore art
(e.g. the picture on p. 118 looks more like a good concept sketch for a
full-color picture than like a good B/W illustration).  At times Larry
still seems to have a little trouble with high-tech weapons (the rifle
on the picture on p. 93 is a bit bland, the gun in the hand of the
front guy on the picture on p. 131 looks like a toy gun).  This by far
does not mean that the art is bad or even mediocre -- it\'s just of a
little lower quality than I had expected from Larry Elmore.
	Also I\'d have preferred to see some more B/W scenes taken from
Imperial cities, star ports, bars.  Generally more day-to-day scenes
giving a feel for the setting would have been nice.
	Besides that it was (as far as I am concerned) not necessary
to fill whole pages with those B/W illustrations.  This really makes
it look like an attempt to simply fill the 192 pages.
	Rating: 6 out of 10 (-2 for lacking flavor and detail, -1 for
being too large and -1 for not telling the complete story below the
B/W illustrations).

EDITING: Well, to put it carefully: the rulebook clearly proves that
it was put together in a hurry to be available for GEN CON.  There are
lots of mistakes (especially a lot of numbers seem to be wrong), there
is an annoying number of omissions and generally the editing could
have been a lot better.  Personal comment: although I was told that
Lester Smith is a very nice and competent guy who knows what he is
doing, the T4 rulebook shows the same editorial problems the Mythus
rules had (which also where edited by Lester).  I\'m slowly starting to
doubt his capabilities as an editor.  Imperium Games really should
have a larger number of people (not directly related to the creation
of the book) proofread it.  Since Tony Lee was also involved in
editing I won\'t (and don\'t want to) blame Lester alone.  Anyways I
guess that they did what they could in the given time frame (based upon
what I heard about Lester\'s abilities and given the general competence
of the IG crew).  I just hope that the upcoming supplements will be
less error-riddled (otherwise IMHO the future might look pretty bleak
for Imperium Games which is something I would hate).
	Rating: 3 out of 10 (grammar and spelling mostly is ok, but
otherwise...).

RULES: The rules are pretty simple, in some cases overly simple.  I
see some potential problems with the combat system -- especially with
the overly simplified armor and damage rules.  Also it seems to be a
bit too unrealistic to make it impossible with a normal hit from a
revolver to even have an opponent lose consciousness (except by making
a called shot, which is a little hard for the average guy with a
gun).
	In some places a few more examples would have been nice,
although generally the rules are easy to understand (at least in
those cases when they are not obfuscated by one or more of the many
errors that slipped in).
	Also some things seem to be missing: how does drowning work,
how is falling damage calculated, how is fire damaged handled, how
does suffocation in general work?  All these things would have been
handy in case of spaceship emergencies and exploratory trips to new
worlds.
	The nice side of the rules is that they are simple to grasp,
don\'t involve a load of tables and also don\'t introduce special
rulings for a number of situations.
	Rating: 7 out of 10 (-1 for being a bit too simple at times,
- -1 for the missing rules, -1 for obfuscation due to bad editing).

COMPLETENESS: The rules lack a number of things and at times look like
a patchwork stitched together in a hurry.  A prime example of this are
the rules for vehicle and robot combat, which are unusable in their
current state.  Things I am generally missing from the rules are
complete and usable vehicle and robot combat rules, a simple system
for handling mass combat, a section on robots in general, rules for
suffocation, fire damage, damage from falls, starship crashes and
damage to character during space battles, a more sophisticated
equipment list and more background for a basic campaign.  The
subsector sheet is a nice example but a few words about the various
worlds (to have a place to start) would have been nice, too.
	The missing table and the missing subsector sheet didn\'t help
either.  The inclusion of two adventures is nice, but doesn\'t overcome
the other omissions.
	Rating: 3 out of 10.

PRICING: $25 for a 192 page rulebook with many B/W illustrations and a
few high-quality color inserts.  As far as I am concerned this is a
little too much (Feng Shui e.g. costs also something like $25 [or $30
at most] but has 256 pages, glossy high-quality paper and is
full-color throughout the book). $20 would have been more appropriate
in my humble opinion -- note that I have no idea about printing costs
but simply relate the quality and quantity of the product to the hole
it left in my purse.  Since more supplements are necessary (priced at
$20 a piece) to run a campaign using the Traveller background the cost
really seems to be a little too much.
	Rating: 4 out of 10.

- ---- PART 2: Detailed Review

The detailed review will comment each section in the order they are
presented in the book (if I have to say something about it -- good or
bad):

The Foundations of the Traveller Universe
- ----
The whole section is pretty good except for one that that really
annoyed me: page 9 is about 60% empty and this space could have been
nicely used to expand the historical sections about the wars with
various alien races.  I barely remember which race is what from my old
Traveller days, but for a newcomer this simply will raise questions
and create confusion.  Each of the section really could have used one
or two sentences describing the alien race and it\'s basic nature, the
reason for the war and the outcome of the war (plus today
relationships to those races maybe).  This annoyed me somewhat.  An
old-time fan won\'t have a problem with this, but it\'s pretty annoying
in a basic introduction to the whole background.

Elaborating this section in a future printing a little bit would be a
very good idea.  (Minor reconciliation: the index points the reader to
a section about the various aliens, which explains my problems; ok, so
at least point the reader to that section in this introduction and
everything\'s fine).

Character Creation 
- ---- 

What I missed most in this section was a description of the meaning
of the various attribute levels (How much can a character with Str 13
carry? What meaning has Soc 3?  How educated is a character with Edu
5? ...).
	Personally I\'ve always felt that 4-year terms are a bit too
long (for the little you learn in them).  Maybe I\'ll try 2-year terms
(with two skills per year) or something like that.  This also should
yield higher skill values and somewhat downplay the importance of
attributes.  I also miss a reasonable way to learn some "hobby
skills".  Otherwise as good as ever.

Skills
- ----
The section seems to be pretty complete although somewhat generic.
This fits into the general "back to the roots" style of the rulebook
though.  Personally I would have preferred it if attributes would
have a little less influence on success chances when trying a skill,
but it\'s ok the way it is.

Task System
- ----
The good point about the task system is that it is very simple and
should be pretty fast to apply during the game (I yet have to play
T4).  The bad point might be having to roll a d3 together with some
d6.  I guess this won\'t be too much of a problem during the game, but
it\'s a little odd.  Also the 4D rating for impossible tasks seems to
be a little too low (someone with a good attribute, e.g. 11, and a
moderate skill level, e.g. 2, has about a 50% chance to succeed at an
impossible task which seems to be too high) -- on the other hand this
adds a nice cinematique feel to the whole system (a little bit like
Star Wars).

Combat 
- ---- 
The rules are simple and as far as I am concerned in some places a
little too simple.  Especially the low resolution for weapon damage
and armor could be a little problematic.  A quick hit location chart
with body coverage for armor types would have been nice (and you
already can do nice hit location charts based on 2d6 so this wouldn\'t
have added too much complexity).  
	The rules for multiple actions seem to be a little broken
when somewhat high skill levels are involved.  The given example (Str
7, skill level 5) allows (among other options) one attack with a
target number of 12 or 7 (!) attacks with a target number of 6.
While the one attack is almost guaranteed to hit, 7 attacks is pretty
much overkill (even with the reduced chance it is very likely that
two or three of them will be hits).
	The combat pools are a nice detail, although neither the
logic seems to be too obvious nor does it seem to fit into the other
pretty simple mechanics (since it requires bookkeeping for three
different pools for each character and maybe also for each NPC).
	I\'m not really sure what purpose the silly range band display
at the bottom of page 61 serves, either.  Appears to be pretty
useless.
	Finally the rules for vehicle combat and fights against robots
seem to be incomplete.  Many terms mentioned (and the referenced
vehicle sheets) are not part of the rulebook.  I suspect that this
section has been extracted from some upcoming supplement but sadly
important parts were left out.  Currently it is not usable.

Equipment
- ----
I just can state that I was pretty disappointed by the equipment
section.  It seems to be too short and really could have used a
larger listing of stuff for a variety of tech levels.  The omission
of an armor table is annoying, the number of typos is pretty makes
the section confusing to read.
	Not being able to find the maximum weight a character can
carry (the index seems to leave me alone on this one) also annoyed me
somewhat.  This might be my fault, but I generally attribute this to
failing to add a section about attributes and their game effects.

Surface Vehicles
- ----
My sole complaint about this section is the (to me) seemingly
arbitrary selection of four vehicles which are described in detail,
while all others are given a generic entry.  Speed modifiers for
various terrains would have been nice, too.

Spacecraft
- ----
Although this chapter seems to be pretty usable it suffers from
severe editorial problems.  The text contains a number of typos and
grammatical problems and the tables used throughout the ship design
process obviously have been moved to the end of the section without
updating the text (there is a number of references to "the table on
the next page"/"the table below"/...).  Also the tables seem to have
been mixed pretty arbitrarily so that looking up a table can be a
real pain.  A rigid way of numbering all the tables would have been a
great help and inserting an illustration in the middle the tables
part didn\'t help either.  Also the spacecraft examples (pictures and
corresponding textual description) seem to have been mixed pretty
arbitrarily.

Space Combat/Space Travel
- ----
These chapters are short and relatively simple.  Some formulations are
a little bit unclear (e.g. the section on skipping on page 116 could
have mentioned which dice to roll -- I\'ll assume 2d6; the last part of
the section on hijacking is also a bit unclear about this).
	The one thing I was wondering about after having read all the
rules about space travel and combat... is the Astrogation skill ever
used when trying to travel from one system to another or is it just
present in the system for flavor and completeness (I would have
figured that it would need to be used after a misjump for example).

Psionics/World Generation
- ----
These sections are pretty clear and contain only few problems (some
formulations again are not too clear but nothing overwhelming or
annoying).  The world generation system is as clean and fast as ever.
One minor quibble: the Systems Contents Tables seems to have been
truncated so that the last one or more lines are missing -- this is
not too serious since only some explanations are missing but annoying
nonetheless.

Encounters
- ----
Sometimes the descriptions reminded me of a board game (step by step
instructions on how to handle an encounter at times read like a
technical manual), but overall this chapter is average.  The texts
could have been more vivid and some examples of interesting encounters
would have been nice for new roleplayers.  The animal generation
system is pretty generic and thus very adaptable.  I can\'t seem to
find the target number of an attack, should an animal decide to fight,
but that\'s just a minor quibble.

Referee\'s Introduction/Running Adventures and Campaigns
- ----
Average... nothing exciting, no glaring omissions although a few more
comments on the transient nature of many Traveller campaigns could
have been helpful.

Trade and Commerce
- ----
A very nice addition.  The only other rpg I know, which has such
rules, is the Mythus game.  I wonder whether the payment for
performers is a bit too high, but we\'ll see.

Adventures 
- ---- 
I\'ll not comment about them before having them played.  Maybe "Exit
Visa" should not have been staged in the Regina subsector, which never
is tackled in the rules.  Something I was wondering about: "Exit Visa"
starts on 300-1105.  Does this date correspond to the year 5626 AD (=
4521 AD [Founding of the Third Empire] + 1105)?  Probably not, since
this would be after the Rebellion.  Did I misunderstand the time
tables (I guess I did).  Clarifications would be nice.

- ---- Part 3: Summary

The summary consists of two parts: an objective part (counting the
numbers and differentiating between inexperienced and experienced
users with and without Internet access) and a subjective part
summarizing my personal impressions.

Layout ........... 7/10
Artwork .......... 6/10
Editing .......... 3/10
Rules ............ 7/10
Completeness ..... 3/10
Pricing .......... 4/10

Overall rating ... 5.0  (30/60)

Objectively rated I\'d consider the T4 rules to be (slightly below)
average compared to other products.  The reasons for this have been
cited above.
	If this book is to be used by someone new to roleplaying
without Internet access I\'d lower the overall rating by a whopping 2
points to 3.0 (meaning a mediocre product), since there are just too
many omissions and problems with the rules.  Also there is not enough
"meat" included for a newcomer to get started.  
	For a newcomer with Internet access (and an idea where to find
support) I\'d rate it as 4.0 since some of the problems can be remedied
and there are people out there with an idea about what is going on.
	Now for the seasoned roleplayer: experienced players and GM
probably will be able to work around the given problems -- and if they
have played Traveller before they even might not notice some of the
problems.  Thus I\'d rate it 5.0 for experienced players.

Now for the subjective part (and personal comments): I was looking
forward to finally get my hands on this product and wanted to start a
campaign.  How do I feel after having read the rulebook?  I\'m annoyed
because of the many mistakes (this reminds me of Microsofts habit of
testing software by giving it too soon to the customer) but am willing
to give the benefit of doubt to the crew of Imperium Games.  As far as
I know they started in February to work on this and thus it\'s a nice
result to see the new edition after Traveller after so little time has
passed.  For the product it would have been better to receive some
more time, but for sales it probably was necessary to be present at
GEN CON.
	Thus I\'ll give Imperium Games another chance and will wait for
the next supplements to judge their quality; being pretty new to
Traveller the background omissions, unusable rules and lacking
equipment section mean to me, that I won\'t be able to start my
Traveller campaign for another couple of months since I\'d like to
integrate it into Milieu 0, about which I have little to no
information.  Very sad.  Also the pricing of the upcoming products
makes me feel somewhat concerned, since I\'ll definitely need the
equipment supplement, the aliens supplement and the milieu supplement
priced at $20 each (and maybe the starships supplement for another
$20).  I simply hope that those releases will enjoy better editing and
contain a lot more "meat".

Do you agree then that, if one were to fight the body venting (even

ruptured lungs?

I would love to read something about the astronaut who had a puncture in 
his suit. There are, of course, punctures and there are punctures.

Rob, does that mean that if the pressure is 1 atmosphere and the hole in 
the hull is a large hatch (2 sq metres) then the thrust in the first 
couple of seconds (with a 100 ton ship) is 200000N? Does this also mean 
that for approx two seconds, maybe longer, the ship could be thrust at 
2Gs from its course? 
This confirms what I had always thought but it had been previously 
denied on this list.

This leaves me wondering; 
Firstly, how much of the 1400 cubic metres of the 100 ton Imperial 
Scount/Courier (Type S) would be considered a life support area 
requiring pressurised atmosphere for the purposes of your calculations 
(since the time to vent depends on the volume to be vented). Secondly, 
the Type S Scout/Courier is divided into 6 sealable sections. If a 
breach was made in the hull into only one section, the time to vent that 
section only would be greatly reduced, giving the occupants even less 
time to react before suffering its effects. For example, the cockpit of 
the Type S Scout is roughly 27 cubic metres (not allowing for lost 
volume due to instrumentation), which is approx 2% of the total volume 
of the ship (not just pressurised life support area). Does this mean the 
pressure in that compartment would be halved in 0.16 seconds (if the 
hole is one square metre). If so, there isn\'t even going to be time for 
knowing glances and a quick prayer.

Do you have a formula (user-friendly) for us John?

They aren\'t artificial limits, they are purely a measure of the degree 
to which a character is cybered-up that assists the referee in being 
consistant when dealing out reactions such as you suggested. How 
different societies react to different levels of cyberware may vary but 
within a society the reactions to levels of cyberware should be 
consistant.

   The ship design section is a typical example.  It is bisected in a number
of places by full page illustrations, none of which had even the remotest
connection with starship design.  That in itself does not necessarily
constitute bad layout, but when the illustrations result in constant page
turning to get to the appropriate tables, it doesn\'t help.  It would also
appear from your illustration count that my friend\'s comments about "Vogue
Traveller" are justified.

   I think the intent was to go back to basics, and basics (with lots of
illustrations) is what we get.  Ironically, IG received a lot of input from
people saying that was the format they *wanted*.  As someone has said, "you
can\'t make everyone happy"....

>It seems like the book is saying "Here is the bare minimum of

   There are two reasons to take this approach: one is that you plan on
stretching things out so that you can get the maximum dollar from your
customer; the other reason is that you want to introduce things in various
levels of complexity so that the player/customer can tailor the game to their
needs  (i.e. those that are interested in ship combat but don\'t care as much
about ground combat will want more advanced rules for ship design, but fast,
light rules in case they get in a shoot out in the downport).  Marc Miller
has indicated that he favors introducing things in various levels of
complexity.  To someone such as yourself (who apparently plans on buying
everything), it can appear that they are simply looking for big bucks, but I
don\'t think this is necessarily the case.

   Assuming that you\'ve never played Traveller before, it will probably take
you a good month or two to get the basic rules down and get comfortable with
the game (I assume here that the players are meeting once a week or less).
 After that, sourcebooks should start appearing in the stores giving you more
scenarios, more equipment, more rules.  That\'s why timing is critical.  If
new players don\'t get these things, most will get bored and go play something
else.

   Absolutely.  Which is why T4 probably won\'t appeal to 16 year olds, but
will probably appeal to 24 year olds.  Yes, I know what I said about Milieu
Zero being aimed at younger players.  But when you consider that the average
age of a Traveller player is probably somewhere around 34, someone who is 24
*is* younger player.

   This also implies that young gamers (age 19 and younger) might look at T4
and say, "Whoa, how retro!"  Of course being "retro" can be a good or a bad
thing....

   Well at least you didn\'t "go native".  :-)  I will confess to having
played _Star Wars_, but it simply isn\'t as much fun as Traveller (sorry

   After all, if the technology is well defined, you can build your own stuff
and don\'t have to buy all the sourcebooks to get additional gear.  _FS_
sounds like a game that truly has its hand in your wallet, much like
_StarWars_.

Hi Thomas,

I enjoyed your review.  I just have one negative comment to make, and 
that is that I believe you may have misunderstood the combat system.  A 
revolver has a damage rating of 3, so it is very possible to knock an 
opponent unconcious with one hit.  Assuming the opponent is average 
(777777), and has no armor, and the attacker makes an average damage roll 
(3D average = 10.5), the opponent will be unconcious since the first 
attack is applied to a single, random characteristic.

Thanks for sharing your review with us.

Nah, if T4 was "Vogue Traveller," we\'d have 60% advertisements, 25%

I expect very strongly that there are legions of Traveller players, 
especially in Europe and Australasia, who would be turned-off by an 
appearance of "grunge" or any post-modern or gothic symbolism. 
Obviously it is a matter of taste, but I would much prefer Orbital, 
Leftfield, The Prodigy, or some other Techno-pop as a soundtrack to my 
campaign. Spare me any Sisters of Mercy.

I haven\'t even seen T4 yet but I certainly hope the books are 
silver-grey on sky-blue look like NASA Flight Manuals. 
I expect I will be disappointed also.

Well my take is that Lucifer has hundreds of weird political groups and
religous groups. I got this from reading the bit in Path of Tears.  But
most Lutalhans are pretty much normal, with a bit of a crazy streak. 
So along with the weird cults I wrote up, there are lots of as you put
it "...ganga smoking anarchistic rastafarians.."   
I guess a useful article would be on the different political parties of
Lucifer, extremist environmental parties, Pure Anarchists, Libertarians
and other groups.

I didn\'t have many ideas for the Spiri, and one of my players is from
there, so I let him have free reign and he came up with this idea:

"They follow many different
creeds and beliefs, but the most common is a version of Plato\'s idea of
forms, mutated through 5000 years of history."

I came up with the idea that the Spiri are very sectarian. The Spiri
live in small farming villiages. Everyone in the villiage follows the
same religous/philosphical doctrine, if a dispute arises, it is usually
resolved by the followers of the new idea going off to form their own
village somewhere else. This cuts down on religous strife and relieves
population pressure.

I\'ll try to put togethor what he and I wrote and send it to the TML soon.

I think perhaps in that one case they listed the weight of the weapon

Last weekend my players finished the first adventure I ran in my TNE
Refomration Coalition campaign. The mission was set on Tiniyd, the
players were sent to check out the status of an old Imperial Scout base
that was abandoned during Hard Times, but never fully evacuated.  My
players arrive in system, and listen to the radio chatter from the
planet for a day or so to get an idea of what is happening.  Then they
go down to the site of the old base.  While investigating they find out
that the base in currently occupied by a xenophobic terrorist group
which launches raid against the native Droyne, known as the Ilkahri. 
First my players just claim the entire base is theirs and demand that
the Ilkhari leave.  The Ilkhari of course refuses to give up their base
but offer some items in storage to the players if the players will blow
up a Droyne installation for them.  I never thought my players would
actually do this, but they accepted. They refused to blow up civilians,
but agree to  blow up an airbase and army barracks.  So they take their
ship into orbit and bombard the target. Killing several thousand Droyne
in the process.  They then get a cargo bay full of TL-15 starship spare
parts and go off on their merry way.  Talk about ruthless.  Of course
they never talked to the Droyne, or discovered the Ilkhari are led by
psions or anything, oh well I\'ll make sure it comes back to haunt them.  He he he. 

Well here is the write up I did on Tiniyd and the Ilkhari.

large satellite (1600 km) at 200,000 km

Society: Tiniyd is a broken up into 10 different nations.  Seven of
these are human nations, while the other three are home to the Droyne.
The human nations are ruled by the descendants of a psionic resistance cell
that took advantage of the Collapse to seize power.  Once they had
achieved power, they began to fight among themselves.  
	The human nations are quite xenophobic, both to human outworlders
and the native droyne.  Many of them have enslaved droyne, which have
reverted to chirper status.  Several times during the last seventy
years one nation or the other has declared war on the Droyne, and 
attempted to wipe them out.  The droyne have become distrustful of
any humans and have retreated to their cities.  The humans are also
quite technophobic and distrust all high tech devices.
	The Kingdom of Light: The Kingdom is the most technophobic of
all the nations.  The state religion of the Kingdom preaches that the
use of any electrical device damns the offending user.  The Kingdom
tries to help the damned on their way to hell, by executing any 
offending individuals.  This has caused the Kingdom to fall
behind in technology and it has fallen to TL-4.  The Kingdom rewards
those who find and turn in technological devices, often granting them
land or chirper slaves.  
    The Ilkahari is a group of fanatical guerillas fighters from the Kingdom
of Light. They hate the Droyne and all other aliens with a passion.  Their 
hate is so strong that they are willing to damn their souls, by using 
technology in their fight against the Droyne.  They are lead by Commander 
Lars Telgon, a former Baron of the Kingdom. Like all nobles, he is a psion, 
in this case a healer.  He has gathered two other nobles to his cause, Suza 
Lefla, a Knight of the realm, and Cleon Arrington, another KOR.  All three 
have renounced their titles and no longer use them.  
	The Kingdom of Light hunts the group, because of their use of techology.
The group is also pursued by the Droyne for their many attacks on Droyne
settlements, and installations.  The Ilkahari are currently based out
of an old Imperial scout base that Telgon found many years ago.  They
have restarted the base\'s fusion plant and scavanged about a dozen high tech
rifles, and two suits of Scout Look-a-bout armor. The base also contains
about 20 tons of TL-15 starship spare parts, which are of no use to the 
Ilkhari.  Their other equipment is of local manufacture, including several 
APCs, jeeps, trucks, and one light tank.  Their weapons include assualt 
rifles, SMGs, pistols, grenades explosives and several anti-aircraft 
missles.  There are currently 300 members.
	The Ilkahari believe that they are truly and irrevocably damned. They
are quite willing to die for their cause, and are willing to do anything
to accomplish their goal of exterminating the Droyne.  

Personal:
 Cmmdr Lars Telgon 77B87D-9-1	(Orignal social standing was higher, but
                                 he is now a wanted fugitive)
Slug Rifle 4/11
Electronics 2/9
Unarmed Martial Arts 4/11  Damage 2
Persuasion 5/18
Leadership 6/19
Psionics:
   Regeneration 5/14
   Psionic Healing 3/12
(He has more skills, but these were the only ones I have assigned him)

  Telgon is the leader and founder of the Ilkhari. He is believes like
all of his followers that their immortal souls are irrevocably damned,
and that they will suffer everlasting torment in the afterlife.  
As such, he is not afraid to add to his crimes, after all he is guilty
of the most heinous crime there is, what is a little murder.  He is even
willing to compromise, if in the end Droyne end up dead.  Once you get
beyond his xenophobia, he is actually quite a charming individual.  
He is able to take advantage of many years in court, to flatter and
persuade people.
   Telgon is a large hulking man, with striking features.  He is completly
bald.  Most nobles of the Kingdom of Light, who are psions depilitate 
their scalps. He dresses in neatly tailored robes and vestments. He uses
a 7mm ACR in combat. He has 400 rnds of HE ammo for it. He also wears
a balistic weave suit in combat.

Suza Lefla 946496-7-1
 Slug Pistol 6/10
 Stealth 5/9
 Thrown Weapon 4/8						  
 Interogation 3/9						  
 Psionics:
   Clairavoyence 5/11

	Suza is slightly mentally unbalanced, she is quite paranoid believing
that most of the members of the Ilkahari are out to steal her brain and 
powers. She is kept in check by Telgon. She never leaves his side, sleeping
in the same room as him.  She is totally devoted to him, but their
relationship has never been consumated.  This is because Telgon 
realizes that this gives him a certain amount of control over Lefla,
and he needs her for her abilites. She ususally carries two body pistols
and several throwing stars. (Same stats as throwing knife)
    She is bald, with several green tatoos on her scalp.

Cleon Arrington 799775-5-1
 Slug Rifle 4/13
 Ground Tactics 5/12
 Stealth 4/13
 Teleport 6/10
 Telekenisis 4/9

	Cleon is very quiet individual. He feels no need to make small
talk, and only says something if it essential. He is the tactical leader
of the Ilkahari, creating most of their succesful plans. If he is not
planning a mission he usually sits and reads from one of many religious
texts put out by the Kingdom of Light.  Cleon is a thin bald man.

    'from' => 'Trent Smith TFSMITH@POMONA.EDU',
    'body' => '     I\'ve been thinking about the soon-to-be-famous Article 5 in Marc Miller\'s
goals for Traveller (paraphrased: set a quality control standard that
specifically promotes wholesome adventure, eliminating sexually-flavored 
content or artwork, vulgar language, and gratuitous unnecessary violence).  
To my (albeit limited, I haven\'t bought a new rpg in a couple years before
now) knowledge, this is a first in an rpg.  While I applaud the condemnation
of gratuitous unnecessary violence, and have always respected Traveller for
being one of the only rpgs where combat is truly rare (although TNE\'s RC 
material smudged that record).  Vulgar language isn\'t something I\'ve ever
noticed being much of a problem in rpg products (now rpg PLAYERS are an
entirely different matter!) so I don\'t have much comment there.  What I\'m
really concerned with is the ban on sexually-flavored CONTENT (I\'ll be glad
not to see sexually-flavored artwork; I consider the cover of Avalon Hill\'s 
RQ3 to be a classic in sensible artwork).  Perhaps I\'m jumping to hasty
conclusions here, but is this Article implying that all people in the
officially-published Traveller universe are going to be essentially sexless?
     If this is the case, Mr Miller is cutting Traveller off from a wealth 
of potential scenarios, personality complexities, rp opportunities, and,
in effect, a major part of Real Life.  Now, I\'m not saying that I want to see
"Crusing for Chicks at the Spacebar" scenarios, but here are some perfectly
sensible-seeming scenarios that, by my reading, may be unacceptable: 
   Political blackmail: Someone has some type of sexually incriminating
material on a p[olitical figure (We needn\'t sepcify exactly what!) and the
PCs are supposed to keep it from leaking to the press, perform PR spin
control, prove that it was falsified, keep themselves from being implicated,
or many other possibilities.
   Romeo and Juliet: Two young folks want to get together (Which needn\'t
happen "on-stage"!) but someone else doesn\'t want them to.  Once again the
PCs can either help them, hinder them, get innocently caught in the 
cross-fire, and so on.
   Jilted Lover: Classic revenge-plot, with the PCs as possible tools of the
revenge-seekign Jiltee, friends/employees of the Jiltor (and therefore 
real, imagined, or even accidental targets themselves), third-party 
arbitrators called in to keep things from getting REALLY nasty, and so on.
   The Ex-Prostitute: Classic NPC-type; s/he may be on the run from past
employers (not only for seamy financial reasons, but possibly because of
something s/he knows, maybe without even knowing s/he knows it), may be a 
source of information or contacts, etc.
   None of these scenarios are necessarily smutty garbage if handled
effectively, and all of them (to my mind, anyway) would make pretty good
adventure-material, more interesting to my mind than a RC "Smash & Grab"
mission, but they are all distinctly "sexually-flavored".  Would such 
scenarios automatically be denied publication in, say, JTAS?  Sure, the game
could probably survive just fine without such scenarios, but it would be
missing out on a huge chunk of potentially interesting material which,
if nothing more, could serve as a great change of pace from the "traditional"
Traveller activities of exploration, trade, straight-ahead diplomacy, and
military actions (more scenario ideas based on those four: the PCs come
across a world where the long-isolated natives have developed strange sex-
based customs; how do the PCs react? There\'s a thriving business smuggling
porn onto a highly conservative world, do the PCs get involved (perhaps even
unwittingly)? An off-worlder\'s unfamiliar sexual habits are threatening to
derail negotiations with a conservative government, how can the PCs keep
everything on-track? Hostile Amazons- are the PCs willing to fight women as
equals?  Are they afraid of what happens to prisoners?).
    Anyway, my point is that "sexually-flavored" doesn\'t necessarily have to
mean smutty or perverse, and to throw out the potential good with the
perceived bad seems like an unfortunate decision.  How does everybody else
see this issue?  Do I have a one-track mind/ have I been polluted by too
much television, or do I actually have a point?

Try painting the critters in your desired base color, then washing them with
a darker complement: dark brown for browns, reds, and oranges; dark grey, or
black for greys and whites; or even dark blue... be creative w/your insects!
When dry, drybrush them with the base color or a lightened shade of the base
color.  Finish up by hilighting teeth, eyes, and other details, if they\'re
big enough for it to matter.  It\'s quick, easy, and gives the impression
that you put more effort into them than you did... - Bill

Assuming that they are using CT as a base ruleset, NO.  It was either Striker

No one knows at this point other than Marc Miller and perhaps IG what is 
and is not allowed, specifically, but my guess is that tasteful sexual 
material would be fine.  Something on the order of classical works of 
literature (which often deal with sexuality, but in a way different from 
the method used in today\'s popular media) should be fine.  Or, I would 
hope so.

I\'ll add my guesses as to what the 5th Article might have meant. :)

This would probably be a grey area.  It would depend on the treatment of 
th subject (as in all cases, of course).  This could easily go overboard, 
but could also be done tastefully.

Should be no problem, as long as it is treated similarly to how the play 
treated it.

Again, as long as it is handled tastefully, there should be no problem.  
No sex scenes, but references to the previous relationship would be fine.

This would be another case like the blackmail one.  As long as it was 
handled right, it should be no problem.

I think you have a point, in that you are correct that such topics can be 
extremely interesting without being of prurient intererest, if handled 
correctly.  The question is, what did MM mean when he articulated Article 5?
It may be a non-issue, depending on what he meant.

It\'d be nice to hear what Marc has to say on this subject.

I don\'t think Mr. Miller is intending to squelch the kind of things you were
making reference to. I think he\'s saying that he doesn\'t want Traveller
going down the road that White Wolf and some other companies have of having
artwork and themes that are, in the eyes of a lot of people, bordering on
pornographic. Traveller is not about these things. I\'m sure that (for
instance) Hiver reproduction will be discussed, and there is room for
"adult" (as in mature, not "sexy") themes in Traveller. It\'s just that these
things need to be done tastefully. I\'m not a prude, by any stretch. But I
feel that a hobby that has the Religious Right breathing down it\'s neck as
it is does not need the kind of drek that The Masters of Pretense and their
imitators have
put out. 
        I\'m actually quite encouraged by Marc Miller\'s intention of treating
women with respect in regards to the artwork appearing in Traveller
supplements. Remember BTRC\'s Macho Women with Guns? A lot of people like
that game for the wrong reasons. As I recall, MWWG was a LAMPOON of
companies who use scantily-clad females to sell their products (like a
certain company That Sues Regularly...). Traveller will not do this, and
that\'s a good thing; bikini\'s don\'t provide much protection against
corrosive atmospheres.
        I applaud Mr. Miller for taking this stand.

Traveller is THE sf rpg bar none. I\'ve been playing for over 15 yrs.  Much
of that time has been expanding one characters background, a TL18

when it first came out (honest no cheating), and I\'ve been playing him ever
since.

I dont get much time to play now. What time I do have is being spent trying

Does anyone have any TL17+ ship designs?

One of the side scenarios dealt with a surrogate

required her to be a concubine as well. 
 
Since *that* was done (tastefully), there should 
be no problems with Romeo and Juliet, or 
blackmail scenarios.

I  borrowed ideals from this trilogy for a Traveler campaign. Good
stuff.

 Cyberwear. I like the ideal of it but it should not rule the game. As I
remember T2300 had some interesting stuff in it. I don\'t have the rules
but I remember an alien race that made organic tools that were sort of
cyber like.

 PC vs.Death I used to play the game Aftermath! with A -large- group of
players maybe as many as 9 or 10 at a time. The sheer body count would
startle many of you. In one game there where over 8 Pc deaths some
players dieing 2 or 3 times ! Yet my longest living character went 22
games beforethe end. Another Pc went 33 before retirement. In such a
game nothing can beat that sence of accomplishment.

 Pc vs pc. I helped a Pc to his just reward by reloading one round from
his .455 webly with c-4. It did not actually kill him but the mutant rat
things he was fighting did. This is not the only time I\'ve  done for a
pc but it sticks in my mind as the first.

"Article 5" concerns have been encouraging-- agreeing with me that the 
types of scenarios I mentioned seemed like they\'d probably be acceptable, 
and that I\'m probably getting worked up over nothing.  
     I realize that you\'re probably right, and although my post may have been
both long and vehement, I\'m not really that worked up, honestly!  My
concern mostly grew out of vague memories of rumors (from, I believe, 
USENET; caveat emptor) about an RPGA submissions guideline that had a
list of unacceptable topics including such things as "bad guys profiting
by their actions" and "authority figures portrayed in a negative manner"
and other ridiculous-seeming stipulations which may have been written with
the best intentions but in practice seemed idiotic.
     Taken to it\'s illogical extreme, Article 5 could limit Traveller 
adventures to nothing but guys in white button-down shirts conducting their
business in an entirely "proper" manner.  I sincerely doubt that\'s what
Marc had in mind, but I\'d hate to see a misunderstanding arise which causes
it to become so (people afraid to send in certain types of submissions,
editors not wanting to push the limits by OKing anything "risky", etc).
     As a whole, Traveller probably has one of the most mature audiences of
any rpg on the market (and I don\'t just mean by age!), and I think we can
tastefully handle some of the "mature" issues (which, as someone pointed
out, isn\'t limited merely to sexually-oriented topics but includes such
things as Slavery, Racism/Speciesism, etc).  We shouldn\'t let fears of
exploitation keep us from mining such valuable and interesting areas, and I
hope that Marc et al have enough faith in us to allow it (on a case by case
basis, of course, as with anything else).
     Further speculation and rhetoric\'s not going to do anybody any good, and
will keep me away from other things that should be taking precedence, so
unless Marc comes forward and says "Actually, you were right the first 
time; Traveller will have absolutely nothing thought-provoking except
tactical combat decisions and trade-route mapping" I\'ll be willing to
consider this whole thing as a non-issue.

     (would somebody tell me please if Imperium Games are NOT reading the 
     TML, and give me their direct email address?)
     
     MMT ERRATA/SUGGESTIONS
     
     p9 dates confused: ie 3rd Imperium (4521 to 5637AD) and Rebellion 
     (5367AD). These dates are inconsistent. Looks like digits 6 and 3 
     transposed. 
     
     p11 The Players "make a character" 
     
     p13 & elsewhere more examples of skill use needed. Note that examples 
     should be checked even more carefully than the rest of the book, 
     because any errors in the examples will render that section of the 
     rules useless to beginner players. 
     
     p37 cascade skills - in many places esp. character generation, these 
     skills are not in bold type. This is very annoying because I have to 
     keep flipping pages to find out which are cascade skills. Also, Level 
     0 is *NOT* unskilled! It actually takes some effort to get to Level 0 
     in any skill. Level 0 designates a person with some level of 
     instruction or experience, sufficient to *avoid* the penalties that an 
     *unskilled person* would face. Otherwise, why bother with Level 0 
     skills at all? 
     
     p46 Stealth should be usable against machines, but only if the 
     character is aware of the machines\' presence (eg electric eye beams, 
     character has to use perception or Recon to find the beams, then 
     stealth to get past). 
     
     p50 2nd column: seems to be a font change partway down the page for 
     about 4 lines. 
     
     p56 assault rifle - "effective range" 
     
     p57 rethink the maximum wounds rule. It seems to be OK if applied to 
     single, penetrating attacks. However, I think you could do without 
     this rule, or at least make it optional - sure Traveller combat is 
     lethal, that\'s what makes it a good idea to negotiate/ambush/ etc 
     instead! 
     Also, it is possible to take only 5 points of damage from a 5d attack. 
     Couldn\'t this be the bullet that passes through doing only a little 
     bit of damage? The 5d attack that causes 30 points of damage will be 
     the JFK *magic bullet* - entering the wrist, going through the heart, 
     ricocheting up through the skull, turning in midair to go back and 
     lodge in the kneecap. 
     
     p70 Slow Drug - 5th para - "drug drug". 
     
     p73 Combat Gear - should be "latter is really needed to carry the 
     former" 
     
     p75, para 1 "TL9 Rifle"
     
     p89 HEPlaR is the only drive that requires reaction mass. Thrusters 
     only need power. 
     
     p123 Psionic Strength Rating - ratings of 13+ cannot be achieved by 
     *anybody*, before or after age 18, except, perhaps, a very lucky 
     Psionicist during character generation. 
     
     p124 Shield should be the first discipline under Telepathy, because 
     other disciplines (eg life detection, assault) are affected by Shield. 
     Also, under Assault - get rid of the word "wary"! (unnecessary)
     
     p125 under Regeneration, word should be "range" not "rage". 
     
     p126 Special is the rarest psi *drug* not *drugs*. 
     
     p132 high population worlds are pop 9+, not A+. 
     
     p147 para 6 full stop (period) missing; also Minor races are those 
     that have not indepently developed *Jump Drive* (there are examples of 
     minor races that have achieved interstellar travel via sublight 
     methods!) 
     
      Foreign words (eg Vilani or Vargr) should be in italics throughout 
     the book. For example, on p8 \'Ziru Sirka\' is in italics, but on p9 it 
     is not.  Usage should be consistent!

   Here I must plead my ignorance, arising from a general disinterest in 
most of the rpg stuff released in the past couple of years.  Of the games
and companies I am familiar with, I\'d like to cite a few anecdotal cases:
  R Talsorian\'s "Mekton": In attempting to recreate the soap-opera feel of
Japanese anime, romantic relationships (both happy and sour) are very 
prevalent in the published adventure campaign (Operation: Rimfire) which I
think is great, adding a much-needed "human" element to a game which teeters
perilously close to being a boardgame at times.  Everything is handled 
tastefully and discreetly, but the fact remains that the characters in that
campaign have and have had sexual relationships with one another.
  Chaosium\'s "Pendragon": Beinf based on what\'s essentially an account of
adultery and incest (the King Arthur legends), obviously sex figures into
this game, which includes a chapter on "Romance" (which boils down to,
basically, seducing married women).  However, this remains, in my 
experience, the most tasteful and mature rpg ever published, and (I don\'t
think coincidentally) a favorite among female rpgers.
  Chaosium/AH\'s "Glorantha" material (nee RuneQuest):  Recent materials have
become much more honest and up-front about sex-roles, sex-related rituals,
and sex-related behaviors which is fully fitting with the (newfound?)
focus on Bronze Age-equivalent cultures, mythologies, and communities. 
Since everything remains very serious and academic, there\'s very little
prurience or exploitation.  These people take themeselves VERY seriously!
  Phil Barker\'s "Tekumel" material (nee "Empire of the Petal Throne"):  This
is the only case I can think of where an rpg consistently skirts the edge
of decency, but, very much like the Glorantha-philes, it\'s all done with
a very serious tone and in an attempt to stay true to the source material.  
The prevalence of slavery, bloody and orgiastic religious rites, public
nudity, and a genarlly amoral society is frequently jarring to traditional
(ie- my) sensibilities, but, once again, it\'s done for reasons of artistic
and social itegrity rather than exploitation so even this is OK in my mind 
(although it doesn\'t belong in Traveller!)
   All of the above show, in my mind, that there is obviously a wide middle
ground between "pornography" and a flat-out ban on "sexually-related content"
which I hope will not be ignored.

   As I said before, I agree 100% about the stand against exploitative 
artwork, and wish more publishers would adopt similar standards.  I just 
don\'t want to see Traveller go too far extreme and treat women as nothing
more than "men in funny suits" which seems to be (if slightly more 
defensible) just as much of a male-adolescent error as the other.

I said I wouldn\'t belabor this issue any more, this time I mean it.

     berserk!  ;]
     
     This posting will give my opinion/ranting on various of the topics 
     discussed during the last two weeks. Sorry it\'s a tad long but I have 
     to get it out of my system! 
     
     
     WATER FOR THE DESERT SCENARIO
     Very nice - can\'t wait to check it out on the web site. I like the 
     mention of the *Disciples of the Bright Way*. Imitation is the 
     sincerest form of flattery! 
     
     FAVOURITE TRAVELLERESQUE SF FICTION
     My votes: 
     1. Poul Anderson\'s "Flandry" series, especially the later ones. I 
     consider "A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows" and "The Day of Their 
     Return" to be classics of SF literature. 
     2. Asimov\'s "Foundation and Empire" (book 2 of the Foundation series). 
     I don\'t really like the rest of the Foundation series, but I think 
     this book (really two novellas) presents two of the most *human* Bad 
     Guys (tm) that I have ever seen in SF (ie the Mule and the General). 
     3. Larry Niven\'s "Protector" and "Ringworld". Some excellent space 
     warfare bits, ramscoop and gravity-polarizer equipped ships equipped 
     with some of the nastiest weaponry in SF. Niven\'s universe seems to be 
     around TL17+, but I have lifted some great ideas for Ancient artifacts 
     from his work! 
     4. Greg Bear\'s "Strength of Stones". Not particularly Trav, but just 
     such a magnificent concept that I had to mention it! Mobile, deserted, 
     artificially intelligent *cities*, crisscrossing a devastated planet. 
     Come to think of it, this could fit into the Virus era with only minor 
     modifications...
     
     WATER
     If water is *that* expensive (ie 10Cr/litre), alternative sources will 
     become very important. Some suggestions: recycling (more sophisticated 
     techniques as TL increases), skimming hydrogen/water vapour from gas 
     giants, using icy asteroids and chunks from gas giant ring systems, 
     reclamation from biological material (dead animals, plant matter, 
     convicted criminals...), extraction from the atmosphere, digging for 
     subterranean water sources, extraction from certain rocks, capping 
     volcanoes/fumaroles for water vapour,...
     If water is very rare, the entire world population will probably be 
     concentrated around a couple of reliable sources, with interstellar 
     trade making up the shortfall. 
     
     IDEAS FOR ALTERNATE MEETING PLACES
     TAS hostel, office block lobby, library, hotel room, gymnasium, 
     Roleplaying game club, rifle range, martial arts dojo, vehicle, 
     starport hangar, private investigator\'s office, executive recruitment 
     (ie headhunter\'s) office, employment service, starport pension office, 
     scout/navy base, warehouse, drug den, power station, computer store, 
     air-raft retailer, broker\'s office, merchant captain\'s starship cabin, 
     local government representative\'s office, city council chambers, 
     barber shop, newsagent, bookshop, childcare facility (maybe?), 
     military barracks, private home, university campus, ... ? 
     
     SOME EXPLANATIONS FOR BIZARRE UWPs
     Some possible explanations for those really weird UWP profiles: 
     1. High tech and/or starport, low (or zero) pop: artifacts, small 
     facility (up to 9 persons; a research lab or military observation 
     post), robotic mining outpost, robotic starport facility, aftermath of 
     planetary nuclear/biological warfare. 
     2. High gov, low law: population is naturally highly structured, most 
     people wouldn\'t *dream* of hurting anybody else, taking property, etc. 
     Alternatively, the government is highly democratic/populist, with each 
     individual taking a great deal of responsibility for their own actions 
     and the actions of others, but with no formal legal structure. 
     3. High law, low (or zero) government: informal customs predominate; 
     these might be shared by all inhabitants of the planet or vary from 
     family to family. Individuals are expected to abide by a restrictive 
     code of conduct, enforced by other individuals. 
     4. High population, low (or zero) technology: a hellhole, possibly a 
     prison world where criminals are dumped to rot. 
     5. High population, low (or zero) hydrographics: people either adapted 
     to dry conditions (eg Bedouin, Jonkereen, Fremen) or using extensive 
     water production/reclamation techniques. Depends on Tech level. 
     6. Size zero, atmosphere/hydrographics present: Ancient intervention 
     (!), ice asteroids, frozen gas asteroids, terraformed planetoid, 
     volcanic outgassing on planetoid (temporary, v.thin, trace or exotic 
     atmosphere), facility floating in upper reaches of a gas giant\'s 
     atmosphere!

     GAMES WORKSHOP
     Idea: GW shops have rules that you can only bring GW stuff to their 
     gaming sessions. How about either: 
     a) take in some of the old licenced GW Traveller materials, "but you 
     said we could use GW stuff!" By the time they can check with their 
     head office in London, you can run off with half of their clients 
     (check that this is legal in your country). 
     b) take in handwritten Traveller combat rules to use with *their* 
     miniatures "so, the battledress trooper fires his PGMP at the Droyne

A problem I\'ve worried about myself. Novelists can get away with levels of
weirdness which GMs can\'t, partly because games are interactive:; they
players keep interrupting with "Huh? What?"

>I strongly recommend all of Gregory Benford\'s "galactic core" novels:

Ashamed to say I haven\'t read \'em; perhaps I will (_Timescape_ is the
greatest!). I must admit I have some difficulty believing in a scenario in
which the sentient machines are trying to rub out all the organic sentients
- - maybe it makes sense in context but I just don\'t get it (even though I\'ve
read reviews of these books). Are the mechs competing with us for
resources? They just don\'t like us? Huh? What?

>Also try Eon and Eternity by Greg Bear and Michael Swanwick\'s novel Vacuum
>Flowers.

Lots of influence from _Eon_ in the background I\'m working up; the Hexamon
is one of the best, most consistent ultra-high-tech societies I\'ve seen
dipicted in SF. Gotta have "picting" in my game somehow. And I liked
_Vacuum Flowers_ a lot. The orbital slums in particular. Swanwick clearly
knows something about cultural anthropology and does a great job of
inventing weirdly organized societies. 

>So, how would you run a post-human game which players can truly grasp and
>be a part of? 

The way to do it, I think, is to go slow. Don\'t throw everything at the
players at once. Start them off all playing orthomorph humans, on some
basically familiar Travelleresque spaceship/station/whatever, and let them
discover the rest of the universe bit by bit, one NPC, one world, one
measured dose of culture shock at a time. (That\'s the *theory*, at any
rate...)

It helps that many of my player friends have read many of the same books
I\'ve read  :)

>I\'d also love to see some more of your ideas on what such a setting should be
>like.

Well, I\'ll be posting my ideas here from time to time. For instance, I\'m
working up a document on the history of cloneworlds in my campaign. Just
scribbling notes yesterday I came up with about seven distinct variants of
clone-dominated societies. I can post it here when I\'m done if anyone\'s
interested. (For all I know I\'m reinventing the wheel for the sixteenth
time...)

>I recommend that nanotech be avoided in such a setting.  It has the
>potential to very easily become the "everything device" and make most
>gaming scenarios rather pointless. 

I agree completely. I wrote up a two-page tech level table (BECAUSE THERE
**ISN\'T** ONE IN T4 [ahem... sorry]) which I won\'t be posting here because
it\'s a Quark Xpress document and it\'s somewhat ideosyncratic. Anyway, I
worked it so that *limited* nanofacturing (molecular-level mass
manufacturing) appears at tech 12 or so, and something like Neal
Stephenson\'s "Feed" and "matter compilers" at tech 15. And there\'ll be bits
and pieces from Bear\'s _Queen of Angels_ and _Moving Mars_ (NOT Bell
Descriptor manipulation, of course!). But mature nanotech - universal
nanofacturing, replicators, mind-downloading, and so on - is still
speculative vaporware, maybe tech 16 or 17+.

I justify the slow development and spread of nanotech by deciding that
there are technical hurdles which Drexler et al. have not anticipated, or
conveniently handwave away. At Tech 12, limited STM-style nano-manipulators
can assemble nano-electronic devices, amazing materials, etc., but they can
only do so in ultra-high-vacuum conditions and at very low temperatures
(50-100 degrees K, perhaps). Other technical hurdles include unforseen
difficulties in programming assembler arrays; the notion of "evolved design
and manufacturing software" trumpeted by Drexler never quite panned out in
this future history.

Mind you, I don\'t believe a word of the above paragraph: I\'ve read debates
between Drexler and highly knowledgeable critics, and he either persuades
or demolishes them every time. The problems I\'ve cited will fade after the
first few generations of assemblers, a matter of mere decades. I have great
expectations for evolved software (have you read Kevin Kelly\'s _Out of
Control_? Good stuff. Or _Artificial Life_ by Steven Levy?). Genetic
algorithms and digital evolution are going to transform our world over the
next twenty years. I expect nanotech as advanced as that of _Queen of
Angels_ to appear with shocking suddenness, as early as 2015. Once
developed, it won\'t stay bottled up in one or two labs for very long. It\'ll
proliferate like wildfire, even without replicators (which are neither
necessary nor desireable).

A lot of claims have been made for nanotech which are just pure bunk. But
the reality is still going to be astonishing. Not to mention dangerous as
heck.

I think you\'re right, and I also think that Marc Miller isn\'t trying to

I\'ve been thinking that the chances "to hit" in the combat system seem too 
high.

Jo Average (Dex 7, skill 1) has 72% chance to hit someone 4-15m away (short 
range).  Remember, the default shot is a snapshot (no aiming), whilst 
moving, directed at another moving target.

I ran the figures through T4 and Phoenix Command (my "reference" for this 
kind of thing) for Mr/s Average & Professional, and found that T4 gives 
significantly better chance to hit.  Equalising the figures would require 
increasing the tasks by about two difficulty levels.

I think acceptable results could be produced by increasing combat tasks by 
1 level.  This would still be a bit unrealistic, but keep combat within 10\' 
(3m) using 2D6.

Comments?

Proot!

His figures have *got* to be way off. And in fact they are. While there
*is* a relationship between pressure and thrust, there are a lot of
other factors involved. 2,000,000 newtons is 400,000 pounds thrust.
That\'s in the same league as *large* rocket engine. A mere hole in the
hull *won\'t give those thrust levels.

Consider that by his formula, opening a bottle of pop (at something
like 50-75 psi) should knock you over. It doesn\'t.

Somebody posted figures for the average molecular velocity of the
molecules. If the interior walls and exterior hull were shaped such as
to form a DeLaval nozzle, then you could treat it like a rocket. In
which case the thrust is directly related to the exhaust velocity.
Which is that same molecular velocity.

Is it realistic?  I really don\'t know.  But I like it this way. :) 
I think it\'s boring to have a combat consisting of more misses than 
hits.  "Okay, so I fire at him....and miss."  "I fire at her....and 
miss."  "I fire at him....and miss."  "I fire at Gargon the Great....and 
miss."  "I fire at the little old lady....and miss."  "ARRGHH!  I give 
up!  My character puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger." 
GM: "Oooh, sorry, you miss." :)

Silly question from someone who doesn\'t have the book. Any chance they

The one our group mostly used, especially if the atmosphere value was
anything odd was "population isn\'t humans". That\'ll cover just about
anything, and it gives the imaginative GM room for all sorts of things.

Just picture the fun if the players made contact with, say Mesklin
(from Hal Clement\'s Mission of Gravity). It\'d be *worth* designing the
weird life support just to watch what happens when your forces start
deploying fighters that can manuever at 100g (or however much more you
can squeeze out of Traveller drives). After all Mesklinites think 200g
is comfortable, and don\'t mind 800 all that much. :-)

Can you say slaughter? :-)

It does mean 1105 years after the founding of the 3rd Imperium.
The Rebellion happened in 1116, eleven years AFTER the Exit Visa adventure.

Replace "G" by "meters per second squared."

This is true as long as your 100 ton ship MASSES 100 thousand kilograms.
Well, "duh Rob," you might say, "the definition of a ton is 1000 kg!"
Then I would have to remind that in Trav, a ton is a measure of VOLUME,
not MASS. According to MT, the "100 ton" scout courier MASSES about
1 million kilograms. (I always use the "1 ton = 10,000 kg" approximation
when the need arises to know a ship\'s MASS; it just feels about right to
me. These ships should float in water, but not be as buoyant as a beach
ball!)

If you find this confusing, that\'s because it is. (Sheesh, I have enough
trouble getting my students to differentiate between mass and weight,
because we use the same units for each. Now we Travllers use the same units for
mass and /volume/!)

So a two meter hole in a 100 ton, 1,000,000 kg scout courier would
(assuming 1 atmosphere pressure) accellerate that booger at 0.02 G.

    'body' => 'Hi,

I have a question for you all with regards roleplaying and skills in T4.

When a situation comes up where certain skills would be useful, how much
do you take into account the skill levels of the characters and how much
does the player\'s role playing come into account?

Typical skills I refer to include carousing, liason, diplomacy, bribery
and streetwise.  

How do you play out the use of these skills in your games?  I can see
situations which range from completely no roleplaying;

Player:  I bribe the offical with 1000 Cr
Ref:     Make a difficult check against bribery.
Player:  Made it!
Ref:     He takes your bribe and ...

right through to no real use of the character\'s skills and total
reliance on the player\'s verbal skills.

Where do you draw the line?  Do you give bonuses on a skill check based
on the player\'s role playing?  Do you set the level of difficulty of the
task according to what the player says his character says and does?

I am just about to start my first campaign in a long while and I think
I\'ll probably try to do it this way:

When the PCs need to use a skill of this nature I will get them to role
play exactly what their characters say and do, I will then determine the
task level according to their actions and make the task roll for them,
based on their character\'s skills.  I will then roleplay the actions of
the people they are dealing with according to the success of the task
check.

This way a good role player will be more successful with an average
character than a poor role player would be with the same character.  Is
this fair?  I can only think it is as otherwise traveller would end up
being a "roll-playing" game which we all know it is not.  Also I think
this encourages good role players to chose skills which require role
playing to help set the task roll level.  Those players who are perhaps
not so good at/interested in roleplay can play computer buffs/star
pilots/grunts and still have a good time (which is, after all, what it\'s
all about).

I would appreciate some comments/advice/good ole fashioned flames on my
thoughts.

(Sorry if this is covered in detail in the T4 rules, but I\'m still
waiting for my copy).

Regards,

Pete.

player says:

"I use my bribery-3 and 1000 credits to bribe the inspecotr"

I will basically rely on skill alone.

However, if the player also goes into some detail:

"Syd Spaceman casually approaches the Inspector as he is running down the

the officials in this starport are so efficient, and so dilligent. I do

This is admittedly transparant, but is an off the cuff example of what
might gain a player a +1 or +2 Dm to their bribery roll...provided of
course that they are playing in charracter.



As in all things as a ref, I have found that discretion and balance is the
key, I also don\'t want to penalize those whose role playing abilities are
not as advanced as others. I would rather help them and encourage them to
get more into character than to punish them.  Its all about having fun

In a general sense, I\'d have to say "it depends" (on the 
situation being role-played, on the interests and skills of the players 
and referee, etc.).  :)

But specifically in _my_ campaigns, role-playing tends to come into 
account in the overall planning areas, while roll-playing tends to 
resolve the individual tasks.  For instance, rather than making a 
task roll when a character is supposed to come up with a plan for 
infiltrating a secure building, the player will come up with the plan.  
The execution of that plan, however, will involve some task resolution 
(whacking the gaurd on the head to knock him out; picking the lock; 
disabling the electronic security system).  Such task resolutions are 
only rarely influenced by role-play in our games.  The execution of the 
plan will, of course, also involve role-playing of other aspects.  :)  
I\'m having a hard time nailing down exactly when each method is used, and 
when a combination is used, though.  Hmmm.  I just do "what feels right." :)

I agree...that\'s the approach I use as well.  I don\'t say, "Well, you 
didn\'t role-play that task, so you get a DM -2 on your throw."  Rather, 
when someone happens to come up with a good role-playing idea, or a good 
plan, or whatever, they get positive DM\'s.  No penalties for being unable 
to come up with good task-related role-playing, though.  And I don\'t ask 
my players to do that - I don\'t want to put them on the spot.

Call it subtle, positive reinforcement of behavior if you like. :)

player, following the tenents of the skill.  For example, bribery\'s
tenent is \'everyone has a price.\'

PC:  "H\'okay, I\'m going to have to bribe this merchant."
GM:  "What will you offer him?"
PC:  "I don\'t know.  I\'m going to use my bribery skill to figure that
out."
GM:  "Well, you don\'t speak the local language very well, but this _is_
an antiquities shop, the proprieter does seem well Educated, and you
have a History skill of 3 and a PhD...  It seems difficult, but not
impossible."
*clatter*
GM:  "Okay, you made it by a couple of points.  This shops crammed with
things, and the owner has more than a few crates of books stacked up
behind him.  He\'d probably be interested in a larger shop."
PC:  "Alright, I\'m going to make some small talk and pass myself off as
a rich offworld philanthropist, and offer to \'donate\' 1000Cr..."

Other skills work the same way.  Unless the situation is really trivial
(not plot related) I use skills this way.

recognizable), but it sets the mood nicely. All Foss\' art is on an enormous
_scale_, and it helps remind GMs not to set their scenes in 10\' square rooms...

I\'d never seen a single table with all the surprise mods on before. I\'ll use
_that_ immediately.

My primary problem, sadly, is with the task system. Because stats vastly
outweigh skills in the calculation of target numbers, the whole approach to
character generation changes. Unless I see it wrong, what results is a slew of
characters taking no more than skill-1 in any field and piling the rest into
stat increases. No, I have to side with those who suggested that something like
skill+(stat/2) would be better.

I like the idea of armour reducing damage - spot the RQ player! I never really
took to reducing stats as a damage mechanism tne first time around - too fiddly
for NPCs for a start.

One thing that would have been nice would be an analogue of "Survival Margin" -
a conversion system between MT and T4. Ostensibly to bridge the gap for those
converting an MT campaign, but also to allow us retros sticking with MT to
convert new stuff _back_! Maybe on the web page, IG?

It does feel a bit like losing an arm to be capped at TL12. And where have
droyne, gauss rifles, PGMPs gone?

All in all, it\'s nice to see Traveller survive, and I will buy the supplements -
of course! But I don\'t think I\'ll ever run T4 as a rule set. Our tweaked melange
of CT/MT works just fine. What we will do is plunder T4 for ideas, background
and so on.

    'body' => '    For the past couple of years I\'ve run RuneQuest almost exclusively, which
is based on a straight %-ile system, but when/if I run Traveller I plan to
keep my GMing technique the same.  I let everything run organically through
rp\'ing, until the point when a player tries to do something obviously
covered by a skill, from attempting a fast-talk to attacking someone, at 
which point I demand a skill roll.  In effect, this makes rp\'ing the catalyst
for skill tests, but the skill itself determines success.  For instance, if
Joe Merchant comes flat out and says "I want to fast-talk him" I\'ll respond
"well, don\'t say it, do it" at which point Joe\'s player will have to rp the 
attempt, even though the actual success is determined by the character\'s
skill.  This method tends to discourage players from coming up with
characters too different from their own personality types (if Johnny the
Player never initiates contact, it doesn\'t matter how Persuasive his
character is; likewise if Jack the Character has a Fast Talk of 05% it 
doesn\'t really matter how Persuasive his Player is) but I don\'t see this as
being a problem-- all of my players come up with characters that are 
compatible with their personality types anyway.
     I don\'t know how well such a system would work in general, but I\'ve
been playing with more-or-less the same group of people for the past 10 
years or so and it\'s always worked fine for us.

Ateempting an Orate roll right now,

If the player isn\'t up for this (some players can\'t run bribery to save

this description modifies the outcome of the roll.  We do lots of deep

Basically, I\'ve found that their is a limited place for diceless play in

are not needed.  If too many events out of the hands of the player,

Well, I think Joe has already hit on the point behind this.  The rule is
probably something like, "Do what your gut tells you."  While this is great
sounding, it doesn\'t really help.

My own (admitedly limited) opinion on the subject is that when someone tries
to use one of these skills, as in...

>Player:  I bribe the offical with 1000 Cr

You would first make sure that the player\'s background knowledge is what the
character\'s would be.  For example, in the above bribery example, you might
say...

Referee:  <character> would know that the minimum bribe is at least 2500 Cr
for this type of action.  Now tell me what you would tell the official.

Hopefully this will get the player acting in the role of his character, but
if not,

Player:  Duh, gee, I dunno, what do I have to roll?

you could keep egging him on till he comes up with something.  My experience
has been that most players prefer rolling their own dice, so rather than
tellingthem what they need to roll, just have them roll (after they have
role played a bit).  When they roll, depending on what the roll is, have
them role play out the results...

Player:  I rolled a 7, did he take the bribe?

Ref:  (Acting as official) "Well, Mr. <character>, Your offer sounds good,
but there are complications involved.  The law of Regina, expressly forbids
me from taking any bribes."

Player:  (Hopefully now acting as character) "I see, well since we are the
only two people here, and since I wouldn\'t tell anyone, and you wouldn\'t
tell anyone...  Well, what the law doesn\'t know about won\'t hurt anyone,
only help us."

Or something like that.  I think that you should be careful in penalizing
poorer role players for a playing a weak role.  I think excellent role
playing should be rewarded, and refusal to play a roll (ie, Player: Come on,
man, just tell me what I gotta roll), should be punished, but player ability
to "act" shouldn\'t change the outcome much.

So, as a rule of thumb, I would say encourage your players to PLAY their
ROLE and not ROLL their PLAY.

   Bear in mind that skills of this nature *should* IMO be used to bridge
knowledge (or poor role-playing skills) on the part of a player.

   For example, a player may not know how to approach some one with a
bribe, but a successful roll on a bribe skill will allow an attampt to
work. Likewise, a brilliant attempt by a knowledgable player should have a
significant chance of failing if he has no bribe skill. (In the former
case, the CHARACTER has the skill, while in the latter the CHARACTER is
clueless) To do things otherwise makes having a *character* pointless.

   Note that there are similar problems in other AOKs; for example tactics
skill. A militarily inexperienced player with a military character that
has tactics should be given a tactics to roll when making up a plan of
attack. If the roll succeeds, the GM should point out problems in the
players plan. A brilliant player that has no tactics skill will foul up
the op on details (GM intervention).

I\'m that kind of player: I like to make suggestions to the GM buried in the character 
background to develop detail-ey things the GM might not have had time to work out, and 
let the GM take it (or leave it) from there. An example: for my military characters, I 
always detail the decorations and the circumstances in which they were earned. Most 
GMs _love it_ for their players to think of these things, but if they don\'t want me 
to develkop it, I leave it alone and come up with a dramatic equivalent. What I _don\'t_ 
do is use my character background as a springboard for either power-gaming ("I was 
involved in top-secret research on the Ultimate Nullifier during my time in the Navy . . 
. and, BTW, I have Electronics-7, Gravitics-5 and Engineering-9. When can I build my 
working model?") OR for tweaking the story off the GM\'s intended track the way these 
co-op GM types do.

I did that with "mil-speak" in my Coalition game; littering my character\'s speech with 
the Complete Library of RC Military Slang From Hell: DZs, dustoff, C^3D, AFVs, ATGMs, 
and all the rest of the alphabet soup you find in a military environment. Good clean

I like playing with cosmic-scale threats after the players learn about the universe a 
little bit; in this we disagree. I think players like being, as an ad in the final ish

You could try using sculpy or fimo clays (bake to harden) and roll
out little rat shapes.  A big rat (I\'m looking at one right now next
to my desk----actually 4, but only the male is *big*) is maybe 6-8
inches long plus the tail, so call it maybe 2mm long (body).  Making
little rats like that wouldn\'t take too long.

You can get the clays in a ton of colors at an art supply store.
Epoxy putties would work as well, and are usually gray.

Good idea for the ants... remember that they will move in kind of a
line, darker in the middle, with a few outside the main path.

An attempt to kill two birds with one relativistic rock:

What if Traveller computers are so large due to the fact that they have to
be kept super-cooled for the nanobots inside them?  Figure to make a jump,
the computer has to juggle two sets of equations involving 36-dimensional
physics, the current state of the ship, and the price of tea on Vland for
all I know!  One could also say that since exposure to j-space has driven
people mad, there is an effect on the brain\'s delicate electrical field;
from here, it is a short jump to say that such effects are devastating on
ship\'s computers, and they must be shielded in some way, or risk computer
failure.

Just some thoughts pounded out while I sit here, I really don\'t know how
feasible this all is.

Just to provide a contrast example, I might roll here to determine 
whether the character knows what the bribe should be -- if the 
character\'s background doesn\'t indicate plainly that the character would 
(or would not) know this information.  (Note, I said "I might roll," not 
that I would ask the player to roll....I\'d provide the info either way, 
but the truthfullness would depend on the roll:).

Geez, it gets even more complicated.  I typically roll dice randomly 
throughout the game, so players don\'t know when I\'m making a "real" 
roll.  Sometimes I also roll and write down several 2D tosses before the 
game starts, then use them as needed.

And, again, as I originally said, sometimes I require a roll, and 
sometimes I don\'t!  

Sheesh!  Being a referee isn\'t a science, it\'s an art, and don\'t let 
anyone tell you differently. :)

Absolutely, positively correct!

Nice rule of thumb.  Suitable for framing, even. :)

Back in the old days...and I\'m goin\' way back here, now...back to the 
days when Traveller books were smaller (we couldn\'t afford bigger books 
back then - you young \'uns don\'t know how good you have it)...there 
actually was a Steward skill...\'course, these days you young whipper

you do!  Why, I mind the time a character with nothing BUT Steward skill

Uhmmm...looks like that one might have been left out.  Or maybe there was 
no such skill in Year 0.  Steward Skill is only possible at TL 14+. :)

Been there, done that! I was once in a combat under MegaTraveller where
most of the PCs actually ran out of ammo (really!) and they were average
military types. It\'s nice to hit something other than control panels and
fuel lines for once.

One thing I\'ve noticed is that it appears to be tougher in T4 (IMHO) to
get multiple psionic disciplines. Could there possibly be subconscious
anti-Zho sentiments somewhere out there? :-)  Remember...PsiCorps is
your friend.

It may sound silly but how about the U.S. Navy? Or, better yet, an Air
Force base? Just replace the docks/flightline with landing pads and use
building locations as is.  After all, most military bases have some kind
of family quarters (on the base or very near it), Bachelor Officers\'
quarters, a commissary, theater, library, health care facility, and a
ton of warehouses for equipment, ordnance, etc.  Keep in mind that the
"public" buildings will be considerably smaller than civilian versions
because of the somewhat captive but much smaller population base.

Civies can\'t come on base without some kind of escort or ID from a
relative stationed at the base, and a pass issued by base security which
must be placed somewhere on their person or displayed prominently on
their vehicle.  (The previous is based on my personal experience at
various Air Force bases here in the U.S. and in Japan.)

IMHO, you right on the money. In campaigns I\'ve ref\'d I\'ve always let
"role-playing" override "roll-playing"...for the most part. If players
try to rebuild a quantum computer from bailing wire and spit while
spouting off Einstein\'s General Relativity proofs, I let them *unless* 
the *character* doing this has an Int/Edu equal to that of an amoeba. 
At that point, it\'s obvious that "role-playing" has come to an end and
it\'s time to force some stat-based rolls.

   Be careful of the wording!  I didn\'t say that my players didn\'t like to
play characters different from their own personalities, but rather that they
play characters COMPATIBLE with their own personalities.  Since people seem
to be tossing out pithy sayings here, I\'ll add one-- my group is more 
interested in rolePLAYING than we are in ROLEplaying; in other words, we
get more enjoyment out of interaction, problem-solving, story-telling and
such than we do out of chewing scenery or challenging our acting abilites.
   As an example of what I\'m talking about, while specific goals, abilities,
and quirks will change from character to character, it\'s pretty much a given
in my group that the outgoing boisterous guy will usually have an outgoing
boisterous character, the sarcastic and cynical guy will usually have a 
sarcastic and cynical character, and so on.  Perhaps this is an artifact of
our group remaining basically unchanged since we were all in Jr-High 
together playing AD&D, but it suits us very well and adds to our communal
enjoyment of the game (plus it makes it more poignant when a player will
transcend himself and do something non-idiomatically heroic).

Trent Smith
P.S.  I\'ve come to terms with the fact that I myself am a terrible
roleplayer, almost always tending to paraphrase and summarize rather than
speak in-character, and so forth; which is why I both tend to GM (which may
seem like a contradiction, but it\'s easier for me to do a dozen shallow
"impersonations" than a single in-depth one) and also don\'t demand a lot of
sophisticated role-assumption from my players.

 You might Want to Look at the Steward as a whole package. What skills
dose He have which ones would He use in his job and at what level are
they.  His stats give You insights too how smart is He. Is his endurance
high so he has the ability to work those extra hours. How many terms of
service did He spend in His Field. What are the parts that make the
Whole.

     Traveller fans, and not to new players. Hell, if I weren\'t a member of 
     *this* list I wouldn\'t have known anything about it myself. 
     
     The games market is no longer like it was in the 70s or early 80s; 
     there are so many competing RPGs and other games (eg GW crap, not to 
     mention CCGs and computer games) that a new product needs a pretty big 
     marketing campaign to make any impact at all. Your average new gamer, 
     possibly mid-teens or junior university student (my assertion, anybody 
     done a market survey?) is looking for cinematic type action with 
     *guns* or at least strong storyline!  
     
     What is in our favour? Well, hard-SF games with a consistent, 
     extensive background are very rare. T4 has a good chance in this 
     niche. Leaving aside some of the Cyberpunk-type offerings, most are 
     either hard-SF, low background, or soft-SF/semifantasy with extensive 
     but inconsistent background. 
     
     What does Imperium Games need to do? I suggest *at least* two 
     promotional posters: one large glossy poster with your great Foss 
     artwork (I mean, *new* Foss artwork) and little content, to catch the 
     eye, one to each games shop, declaring that T4 is *here* and it is 
     *good*; and another (small glossy A3 poster or 4-page A4 leaflet, a 
     couple of dozen to each games shop) that outlines the product and 
     future releases. 
     
     I realise that this is going to cost, but good marketing *makes* money 
     even without substance. Just look at that crappy Independence Day 
     (ptooey!). I\'m sure ID4 games will be flooding the market around now. 
     
     What I *don\'t* want to see is T4 sinking without a trace, which it is 
     in danger of doing if we can\'t find new blood. Us remnants from the 
     Black Book era are married, dropping kids, getting into careers (well, 
     some of us) and generally well into the stage where so many other 
     demands crowd out gaming time. We are a handy nostalgia based fringe, 
     but *not* the main game! 
     
     An well marketed and errata-free (OK, errata-reduced) second printing 
     of T4, together with the Milieu Zero sourcebook and at a slightly more 
     reasonable price (teenagers/students don\'t have high disposable 
     income, guys!) is precisely *what we need* to reestablish Traveller in 
     the industry.

Yuck!  I\'ve been *in* games like that..didn\'t like \'em.  In games that I GM

characters.

..well not *quite* that far.  I\'m not a diceless GM..I swear! <g>

>the player\'s role playing?  Do you set the level of difficulty of the task
>according to what the player says his character says and does?

Tere are 3 kinds of skills/knowledges and how I handle them: 

1.  Interpersonal skills (bribery/carousing/negotiation)

    I insist on roleplaying here!  If you want to bribe the guard, or get
info out of the bartender, then you have to play it out. Convince me!  I\'ll
use the skill level to make up for any
shortcomings I see.  If I don\'t think you are pulling it off, I *might*
make you roll, I\'ll probably roll myself for the NPC\'s reaction. 
Regardless, it\'s the EFFORT the player puts into the task that I\'m looking
for.  Notice I said effort!  A shy or socially unskilled person might not
"smooze" the guard/bartender too well, but I make allowances for them. 
Mostly diceless.  Dice used to try to *save* a failing attempt more than
anything else.
    
2.  Technical skills (lockpick/intrusion/pilot/astrogation)

    I like a *little* roleplaying for this, but don\'t insist on it. Tell me
what you are trying to do and what skill you are using and we\'ll roll it
out.  The roleplaying adds flavor and provides a chance for the player to
apply some THOUGHT to the attempt.  Here\'s what I mean.."I\'m going to try
open the door with my intrusion skill, but I\'m going slow because I *think*
there might be an alarm and I want to be careful."..so the character gets
some (GM decided, and usually secret) additional DM on the task, but might
have some kind of (secret) time penalty applied.  Mostly diced, but player
thoughtfullness and creativity is rewarded.

3.  Creative skills (tactics/invention)

    Cooperation is the name of the game here.  I have the players involved
talk it over and describe what they want to do and how they want to do it. 
If they come up with a good plan, wonderful, and if they don\'t then their
skill affords them a varying level of \'help\' from the GM.  Mostly diceless,
but I often do rolling during
implementation to see how well things go.

Flying swarms, flies and wasps, could be a small loose wad of nylon or
cotton batting.  Sprinkles would do for ants.  You could use rasins for
small animals like rats and mice...and have a nice snack when you\'re done.

I was just in IRC with Suz Dollar, and she came up with the idea of simply 
using relevant skills, which is pretty much what you\'re saying, above.  
Things like perception, carausing, etc.  Make Steward a collection of 
skills and characteristics, rather than a single skill.  Anyone can be a 
Steward - their success at the task will depend on how many relevant 
skills/characteristics (and at what level) they can bring to the task...

To add another pithy statement[G], all that matters is that you have fun. :)

My group tended toward characters with personalities compatable with 
those of the players...but we also enjoyed playing other character 
types.  But that\'s just us.

I I weren\'t a member of this list, I wouldn\'t have known about it until the 
last issue of Shadis came out, with the review of Traveller....and even 
then I might not know, since the review is small and T4 isn\'t mentioned 
anywhere else in the mag (i.e., I might have missed it if I didn\'t 
already know the review would be in there).

I strongly agree with this approach.  The poster will catch their eye, 
and the leaflet will give them something to bring home to think about.  I 
asked MM about such an approach during the seminar at Gen-Con, but he was 
rather non-commital.

One saving grace, even without the posters, etc., could be that IG may 
get a lot of shelf space by second quarter 1997, with 1 book per month 
(two in December), assuming they stick to the schedule.  By then, T4 will 
still be relatively new (and I think there are enough of us to support it 
that far) but will have about a dozen books on the shelves....IF the 
games stores stock the books, of course.

Perhaps (shudder) a single book comprising both, at a $30 price?  I am 
one of the ones who urged IG to keep the background separate from the 
rules as much as possible, but....well, in this case, given the 
disposable income of the target market T4 must have in order to thrive...

Hey!  You do that too?  <g> Not only do I randomly roll dice, I\'ll also
check my notes, for no reason other than to keep the players paranoid..

<clatter, clatter>

"Six...hum...", says the GM flipping back 3 pages in his notebook.

"So, what happened?", asks the anxious player.

"Oh...well!", double checking his notes and then smiling brightly,
"Nothing.  Nothing..that you can tell."

You have to actually spring things on them occasionally, but once burned
they become *very* shy.  <g> 

Keep in mind I also will throw in little "red herrings" from some of these
rolls too.  I generally throw a handful of dice, but I\'ll have a couple of
dice that I look for (a couple of reds in a handful of whites, or the old
off white and the small red, or the two that land furtherest left)..decided
on the spot, and if I get snake-eyes something might have happened.

At that point I\'ll make something up to fit what\'s going on...

The PCs were sneaking through a mansion looking for a kidnapped boy, "You
hear a muffled crash from behind that door.", (it was a cat).

Joe, a PC, always kept the radio on while in Jump Space, he said the white
noise was soothing. Then one day while a couple of PC\'s were on the
bridge..."Through the static on the radio you pick up a signal for a few
seconds and then it\'s gone."  (had them franticly trying to reacquire that
impossible signal, they never did..I played that one dead serious.  They
argued that it was impossible, I shruged my shoulders and said *you* heard
it, make of it what you will.  They eventually gave up trying to find the
signal and accused me of a setup, I said "Can\'t say.", and knowing how
devious a GM I am they were left with a shadow of a doubt..exactly what I
wanted.  This one also made an interesting bar story at their next
port..got Joe several free beers out of it...and this bunch *always* leaves
the radio on while in Jump Space now. <g>).

How about taking one of the flat bases and put individual drops of elmers
glue on it?  Maybe use a pin to get small droplets from a big drop squeezed
onto a piece of paper?

Good idea.  Also, try a novelty/party supply store - you can buy bags of
ants (ok; in 25mm they\'d be BIG ants...) and other crawlers.

>You can get the clays in a ton of colors at an art supply store.
>Epoxy putties would work as well, and are usually gray.

Fimo and Sculpey are MUCH less expensive than epoxy, don\'t require mixing
(yellow + blue) have a nicer aroma, and the only downside I can think of is
that many (but not all) require low baking (200 deg. or so) to harden...

Yeah, and like all great ideas, it was an accident.  I meant to type

came up with that rule of thumb. :)

Well, this is what I\'m doing now.  The steward is a combination or his
Perception, Carousing, and Leadership skills, as well as his Endurance and
Intelligence.  I was wondering what skills others think might be necessary,
or adventageous for a steward?

Aw, you\'re just mad cause you got busted!  I can\'t help it if the best thing
I could think of to replace the Steward Skill was Perception and Carousing. :)

Seriously though, I have thought that adding it to the Charisma Cascade
would be an acceptable method, but I do think if you roll for skills it will
leave Steward with a bit fewer entries than perhaps it should have.


Any other ideas?

Gee, I am beginning to understand why it took so long for
the Solomani to achieve jump drive and reach for the stars. I
thought the problem was incomplete knowledge of  Einsteinian Physics
and the Universal Thereom compounded by a long period before
reaching out of the gravity well...but the price of tea on vland?

Early Solomani Jump Drive Researcher:
"Lets see, theory of relativity..check, universal theorem..check,
jump drive theory ..check, lithium..check, zuccahai zuchini whatever 
crystals...check, 36 dimensional physics...check...price of tea on
Vland...WHAT....OH no...What and Where is Vland, What inhabits Vland,
What monetary system do they use..How did they get tea, a terran 
substance..Were they the UFO\'s that came here. Did they bring
only a little tea back and make a killing, or did they bring so
much back its a glut on the market...does it taste terrible to
them, great, deadly poison, most addictive drug.., utterly boring...
how did they come here to get the tea, if they need tea on vland
to do jump drive..generation ships....oooh my head hurts...we\'re
never going to solve this problem...."

I used to think this major/minor race thing was just specieist
bigotry..But now, I see it really does separate the Adult
Gentle Sophonts from the Immature Reproductive Spawnings as
far as species go...  By the stars, the sophonts that solved
this problem, they were the Greats!....

  I experienced much the same thing at EuroGenCon. I took a straight

Now, this happened to work well for the scenario, and it could be made
to work in a wider setting, however, you have to remember one thing:
  THE NPCs HAVE THE SAME BENEFIT.
  To frequently, the player\'s run rife with a system like this because the
NPCs don\'t take the initiative. If you are running with a high-success system
like this you have to remember to be a little more proactive with your
NPCs. Bribe that guard, Hack the computer security, pull down those

how easily they can achieve success, but you have to make sure they

Yep, I have one. Try Megatraveller handbook. I know, it\'s out of date 
now, but I just started "travelling" and in Austria there isn\'t much 
stuff to get (-> Amber Zone).
Anyway, in MT there is a Steward-Skill. You can achieve it through nearly 
all careers, as it is part of the Interpersonal Cascade-Skill.

Description as on S.39 in MT-Players Manual:
The individual is experienced and capable in the care and feeding of 
passengers.
Steward Skill represents a general knowledge of cooking, personal care 
and attention, and other areas of experience which will make passengers 
and crew happy and content with their conditions of passage.

I hope this helps.
Cya.

  I think this is inarguable. Firstly, I\'ve had it said to me that the
Traveller Mailing List comprises 5% of the market for T4. That is
a titanic percentage. It doesn\'t mean there are loads of us, just
that there are not many others.
  Secondly here is an exercise for you to preform. Pick up almost any
RPG supplement or rule book you have lying around. Pick up T4.
Now turn them over and look at the back cover (we did this last night).
Your generic RPG supplement\'s back is probably crammed with text
in and around bits of artwork detailing what this is, what it contains, and
some things to get you excited about why you should buy it. What\'s on
the back of T4? Some nice artwork. THAT\'S IT.
  This product is quite clearly aimed at people who already know what
they are buying.

  Having established that, though, I\'m not necessarily saying it is a bad thing.
If you look at it a bit deeper you might conclude that it is the _only_ thing.
Many of your suggestions, Michael, about "What We Need" are prefectly
good and correct. However, they all require one thing: money.
  Can you imagine the difficulty Imperium Games must have had in raising
the venture capitol for this? The games industry is in a state of decline.
The previous publishers of this work couldn\'t sell enough and went out of
business. I wouldn\'t have touched it!
  If this is an accurate reading then it isn\'t surprising that their first 
actions are to
get out something with minimal cost that they know will sell a fixed number.
This bootstraps their cash-flow and gives enough to fund other projects.
I\'d say their first year\'s worth of projects will be in this line. At the end 
of it
they will have either made enough "legacy" money or else impressed their
investors enough to begin to do riskier things like advertising. (Seriously,
have you seen a single T4 ad? Reviews, yes. Ads, no. Ads cost money.)

  But my analysis could be wrong...

     Yeah, but I thought Traveller was meant to be a *hard* science fiction 
     game.  I assume that means that results should seem to be realistic.  
     I like the fact that the T4 task system is very simple to use, even 
     though that means that every nuance of every situation isn\'t modelled; 
     this give me more time to role-play (emphasis equally on the "role" 
     and "play").  I would like the system more if the results came out a 
     bit more realistically.
     
     Ayway, it\'s not really a problem.  I have my "work-around" of 
     increasing to-hit difficulties by 1 level (that\'s another thing I like 
     about the task system - I can tweak it to suit my tastes in a second 
     :-)).  I\'m still interested in other people\'s thoughts, though.
     
     Proot!

For mice, look for small egg-shaped (ie oval, but much more rounded at
one end) *seeds*. I\'d try some sort of thread for tails. 

For rats, larger seeds or maybe small beads.

Read the Retief stories by Keith Laumer sometime. Lots of "sexy babes"
only they are almost always what the aliens Retief is dealing with
consider to be "sexy babes" ("Wow, get a load of the eyestalks on that
one, eh?")

The result is *funny* and not at all offensive. BTW, the back of one of
the old books (either 76 patrons, or the one full of NPCs) *has* Retief
in it, as an un-named diplomat (one of 6 or a dozen characters that
they stated were drawn from SF, but left for the players to try to
identify. A JTAS much later gave the correct answers. Retief was one,
Earl Dumarest was another, Luke Skywalker was in there too)

For that matter, nobdy has mentioned Keith Laumer\'s Retief stories.
Jame Retief is an minor diplomat in the CDT (Corp Diplomatique
Terrestrienne). And he\'s usually solving problems in a decidedly
*un*-diplomatic manner. :-)

Laumer served in the US Consular Corps for a number of years, so it\'s
quite likely that the people he surrounds Reief with are based om
experience. 

You (and your players) will never look at a bureaucrat the same way
again (Is he Ambassador PlushBottom, or assitant 5th secretary Retief?
your life may depend on the difference!)

     BACKGROUND
     In the Year Zero, the Solomani Thesis (that humaniti had been spread 
     around the galaxy by the Ancient Droyne) had not yet been proposed. 
     During the early Imperium, dozens of academics, novelists and tabloid 
     journalists proposed competing theories about the identity of the 
     Ancients. 
     
     Few generalisations could be made from the vast diversity even within 
     the few Ancient sites in known space; however, it *was* known that the 
     Ancients had spread throughout known space, destroyed themselves 
     during a Final War that lasted over a thousand years, and that Ancient 
     sites appeared to be strongly correlated with the various subspecies 
     of Humaniti, both existing and extinct. 
     
     THE ARCHAEAN THESIS
     Probably the leading scientific theory of this period was known as the 
     "Archaean Thesis", a direct precursor of the Solomani Thesis. The 
     Archaean Thesis postulated that the Ancients were actually a race of 
     Humaniti (the Archaeans), who developed vast technology on Earth 
     hundreds of thousands of years ago. The minor human races across known 
     space were believed to be the *descendants* of the Ancient human 
     survivors of the Final War, who had been blasted back to a 
     pretechnological existence. 
     
     The Archaean Thesis achieved a level of public attention far greater 
     than its rather tenuous scientific basis deserved. Given the degree of 
     bigotry within the Solomani of the early Imperium, it is hardly 
     surprising that the Archaean Thesis attracted substantial support, 
     particularly among the Solomani nobility and some archaeological 
     scientists. 
     
     The Archaean Thesis acted as a powerful force for Imperial expansion 
     for three reasons. First, it transformed many scientists into 
     enthusiastic supporters of Cleon\'s expansionist plans; these 
     "Archaeanites" were keen to return to the known worlds of Humaniti 
     (particularly Terra and Vland) to search for further evidence of Ancient 
     artifacts. Secondly, since the Archaean Ancients could only have 
     evolved on Terra, the Archaean Thesis lent further force to the 
     Solomani nobility\'s delusions of grandeur. Thirdly, it led many 
     Solomani to claim, arrogantly, that they were entitled to rule the 
     galaxy, not merely as the former lords of the Ramshackle Empire, but 
     as the descendants of the Ancients themselves. 
     
     The Archaean Thesis died out around the year 150, when its 
     inconsistencies and contradictions became too glaring for even the 
     Solomani to ignore any longer. 
     
     GAME HOOKS & ADVENTURE IDEAS: 
     What is less widely known in Year Zero is that many of the scientists 
     favouring the Archaean Thesis are supported by Cleon himself, because 
     of the substantial political benefits that it brings the Emperor. 
     
     1. Intelligence operations: Cleon\'s agents attempt to \'silence\' an 
     archaeologist who is an outspoken critic of the Archaean Thesis. She 
     has raised a number of difficult questions, such as why many Ancient 
     artifacts appear to have been designed along clearly nonhuman lines 
     (tools and weapons designed for four-fingered hands, furniture far too 
     small for humans and made to accommodate protruding wing-like 
     structures on the back...), and why some of the environmental 
     conditions within Ancient sites (such as atmosphere, lighting, 
     artificial gravity and temperature) seemed to be significantly 
     different from those that humans would find comfortable. 
     
     The PCs may be intelligence agents of one of Cleon\'s political 
     opponents, whom the archaeologist approaches for protection. The PCs 
     could alternatively be Cleon\'s agents, in which case they will be 
     pursuing the archaeologist while trying to avoid further publicity. 
     
     2. Crime: Some nobles with more money than brains will pay large sums 
     of money to buy evidence of the existence of the Archaeans. 
     Unscrupulous PCs might decide to try their hand at fraud, by 
     fabricating \'artifacts\' for sale. 
     
     3. Exploration: A scientific team, filled with enthusiasm for the 
     glorious Solomani destiny, is setting off for Terra (or another planet 
     such as Vland) to search for evidence of the Archaeans. They require a 
     ship and crew to take them there. They do not seem to realise that 
     Sylea is a *very* long way from their destination.

capital ship into one as in the later Star Trek movies and TNG.

We are trying to prepare to play out a major space battle, where the 
purpose of the battle is to destroy, disable, or capture said naval 
base. Have any of the companies that owned Traveller ever actually 
published any sort of detailed information about a naval base as either 
part of a source book or an adventure?

If not, what is a reasonable displacement? 100,000? 500,000? a million? 
I am talking about a naval base for the Sword Worlds at this point.

Would you expect the Sword Worlds base to have sensor satellites for 
extended targetting? A space minefield of some kind to limit approaches?

Would it have a small number of very large weapons or a very large 
number of point defense type weapons? It is, after all, primarily 
defensive in purpose.

How large a fleet do the Sword Worlds possess? How large for the 
Darrians? What would be the typical squadron stationed at a naval base?

airframe hulls? Where can I find the configuration of a vessel, or how can 
I work it out?

2) Which ships have "dispersed structures" or are "planetoids" which
cannot land on any world? Which ones have streamlining, and can land on
any planet (again, does this include airframe hulls)? I cannot find this
information on the USP. 

3) Are the crew figures correct in the military controls table, p105 (ie,
all 0.0)?

4) In the USP description section, p96, it says that cotrols are military 
fibre-optics - fib, or standard control systems - std. On p101 it says the 
light fighter\'s controls are "Military Standard". Is this Fib or Std?

5) Again on p96, it says that a ships FCR is according to the FCR table. 
Yet the light fighter on p101 has an FCR of 1 and is TL12, while the FCR 
table on p112 says TL12 = FCR4. Am I doing something wrong here?

6) I assume when a weapon is 9-7-4-3, it does 9 dam at v. short range, 7
at short, 4 at medium and 3 at long. Is this right? Also, the TL11, 10
laser military battery has USP profile 9-5-3-12 (p110). What\'s going on
here?

Your technical school idea is good, and it is definitely something that 
most (all?) game systems overlook, yet which is very much a part of real 
life.  

I have one question, though - your system assumes that technical schools 
yield the same Edu benefit as college, on a year-by-year basis.  Is this 
correct?  Never having attended a technical school, I honestly don\'t know 
if that is the amount that should be added.

I also liked the skills write-ups you did.  They will certainly come in 
handy!

Actually, I\'m pretty sure that my figures are right on. BTW, the figure
calculated from a two-square-meter meter hole at one atm. is 200,000 N,
not 2,000,000.

>Consider that by his formula, opening a bottle of pop (at something

Hmm... Most of the pressure escapes when the lid is first cracked open
(very small hole area), before the top comes off. The pressure
disappears so fast, that the total impulse (force times time) is too low
to knock you over.

The same thing applies to starships, incidentally. The 0.02 G factor
that I calculated in my previous post (which, admittedly, you couldn\'t
have read yet when you posted your message) for a 2 m^2 hole in a 10^6
kg scout courier would decrease rather rapidly, providing more of
*lurch* than an accelleration.

If you did this calculation using the ideal gas laws, you should get the
same value for the thrust that I did (Thrust = Pressure times Area).
Because that is how pressure is originally derived in the ideal gas model.

	On a Jayhawk/Marava Far Trader the steward is also the gunner

An easy way for these skills, which almost always involve an uncertain task,
is this:

Have the player roleplay the situation.  Let them roll their dice as usual. 
But instead of rolling _your_ dice, you use your opinion of their roleplaying
to choose a number.  This lets their character\'s skill count for something,
without eliminating the most fun part of the game.

I\'ve just gotten a look at T4 (just a look It hasn\'t reached my part of the
U.K. yet - thank you Virgin Smegastore). I didn\'t get much time to look at it,
and as I was running what I hoped was a \'Milleau: 0\' adventure I concentrated
on examining the Core Subsector Map.

 My first problem with it was that it didn\'t match up with previous products -
DGP material and the Atlas of the Imperium. As I\'d spent quite a lot of money 
purchasing old traveller material I was quite annoyed. The old material was of
very good quality, had a lot of material to start adventures with, and IG 
decide to create their own Core Subsector. Will they redraw the rest of the 
imperium? Will they make the rest of my Traveller collection obsolete? 

The second problem I had with the Core map was the number of unexplored worlds
in it - surely the Third Imperium - encompassing more than a sector in the
year 0, has explored it\'s own back yard.

Does anyone from Imperium Games want to answer these questions?

Eamopn.

I was thinking of adding an area to my web page (Ants, that is) with
step by step mold making instructions for people without bell jars
etc..  Would anybody be interested in this?

There have been some good ideas posted.  Figure out how big the

My first impression is good.  I haven\'t had a chance to run through the

what Imperium Games was shooting for, congratulations!

I liked the earplug/comm unit combination.  It\'s a cleaned up
commdot/multicomm from MT.  Hmmm... does the implanted earplug count as
cyberware? :-)

I would have liked to see a gauss rifle listed.  They are mentioned as
being part of augmented battle dress (i.e. CT Battle Dress, T4 Battle Dress
is CT Combat Armor), but not as a separate weapon.  Odds are players won\'t
get \'em, but they probably won\'t get augmented battle dress either.
Also missing, IMHO, was the Combat Environment Suit.  A lower tech bit of
military tech that players are more likely to get their hands on.

Both of those will be in the equipment guide...right?

The color plates, were, well...colorful.  Personally, I would have
preferred color plates of the ships listed in the book, or even a Scout
team, or armored Marines, on foot.

The B&W plates, each set setting up an adventure, were great!

So, you would agree that +1 edu per year in a technical school is too 
much?  I\'d say just add the skills, and leave Edu alone...or, perhaps add 
+1 edu for 3 years.  What do you think?

2. When i do this i don\'t install any drives except some stationary
thrusters    to hold it in place. After all, a station is nothing else than
a ship       without any propulsion.

3. My guidelines concerning the size, i use this: S=(Sc*T)*15
	S=Station	Sc=Largest craft    T=number of Sc
   A station that takes crafts must have the capacity to accommodate the
crew of    the ships and act as a middleman when handling goods and cargo.
And how much    food and water does it take to feed them all. Perhaps the
station also is a             refueling depot for small to middle-sized
ships. In wartime there will be    troops and gunners also to consider.

4. Now we come to weapons!!
   I think the combination would be the best. A couple of tripple turrets
maxed    as a battery as long distance defense grid against middle to large
ships.    When dealing with attack fighters i would suggest a lot of single
fast    shooting turrets to secure the closest perimeter.
	
   An interesting idea would be a couple of satellites shaped as stationary
   crafts with spinal mounts against the larger cap ships, guided from the
  station.
   
5. Sensor satellites is very interesting if connected to the station using
beam communicators. It would take an instant to learn from any enemy
incursion. They don\'t have to be manned either. A standard long range
automated communications satellite would be enough.

Since i don\'t know anything about military strength i can\'t give you any
specifics other than to change the accommodations to cover the grounds sort
a speak.

Once i made a 2\'000\'000 T of orbital prison smacked into a planetoid
complete with heavy defense to repel assisted breakouts. As you might have
guessed this system was the prison for the entire subsector.

Hope you got some clues of how to proceed.

I\'m not from Imperium Games (obviously..grin), but I do recall their 
answer to this aspect.  You\'re free to use whatever materials you want 
with T4 - CT era, MT era, or Virus era - and from any publisher - GDW, 
DGP, Paranoia Press, whatever - but if you choose to use IG stuff, you\'ll 
be assured of support.

Meaning...they may change some things here and there, and there is no 
guarantee that their new products will support the old products\' view of 
things.  But nothing is stopping you from using the old products.

We had a discussion about this a few weeks ago....hopefully we won\'t be 
getting into that again! :)

Subject: More T4 Qs/Obs

     Reading ahead since my last post, I happened to notice that, while 
the intro to the Psionics chapter specifically mentions that Psionics 
are socially accepted in the early 3I, finding a Psionics Institute is 
just as hard as in the 1100s.  Considering that we all (well, most of 
us) know all about the Psionic Supressions and the [Hiver-type 
Manipulation, I can\'t think of the specific word] therein, I began to 
wonder.  Is the book implying that the Supressions weren\'t as big a deal 
as we\'ve been previously led to believe, and that psionic study was 
never very common or socially acceptable, or is this just another case 
of game-balance-concerns combined with sloppy editing? >>
     
Perhaps, in the early 3I, psionics were still not well understood. There 
was little organisation between Institutes, and not enough demand and/or 
money for a large number of them. As time passes, they will become more 
common, peaking immediately before the Suppressions (when was that, 
about 600?), at which point the numbers will rapidly drop off again.

   I recall a conversation with friends in which we came up with a new
career: Prostitute.  We even came up with ranks, survival rolls, and a new
skill--I\'ll let you use your imagination as to what it was.  We figured that
the Prostitute career broke down into two subcategories: Call Girl/Gigolo (a
high class Prostitute) and Hooker (a low class Prostitute).  Call
Girls/Gigolos received predominantly social skills (Carousing, etc.), got
more mustering out money, and had less chance of being killed.  Hookers
received a much more diverse range of skills, but had a higher survival roll
and little in the way of mustering out funds.  In addition to the survival
rolls that both subcategories had to perform, they had to make a roll to see
if they got busted for prostitution each term.  Getting busted resulted in an
immediate lowering of social status.

   Not something you could put in Challenge or JTAS, but it was fun to work
out.  I may still have the notes I wrote down on the subject, but they were
buried in the "Traveller notes and ideas to be sorted" box long ago, and the
Divine Being only knows where they are now.

   Official Traveller publications have remained Disney-like in their
approach to relationships and sex (and perhaps should--given the political
climate worldwide), but I\'ve never had a problem with the introduction of
more adult themes (as in mature not porno) into the game at the group level.
 It gives the characters more depth, and adds additional complexity to
plotlines without having to resort to cheap plot twists (that Vargr was
really a short Aslan, oh no!).

   And besides, there\'s nothing like a gratuituous babe in a skin-tight
spacesuit to distract a party of PCs while the bad guys are sabotaging the
PCs\' ship....

Joe,
	I guess that would depend on your interpretation of what EDU represents as a 
characteristic.  I mean what effect would adding a +1 EDU do to the character in your 
campaign?  If it isn\'t a big deal one way or the other then...what\'s the problem?  If 
it\'s general knowledge that EDU represents then I would change it to an additional skill 
than a +1 after 3 years.

Yeah, but they\'re ant-sized in 1:1 scale, not in 25mm scale!  Those
plastic ants are about a meter long in 25mm.

Subject: More T4 Qs/Obs

     Reading ahead since my last post, I happened to notice that, while 
the intro to the Psionics chapter specifically mentions that Psionics 
are socially accepted in the early 3I, finding a Psionics Institute is 
just as hard as in the 1100s.  Considering that we all (well, most of 
us) know all about the Psionic Supressions and the [Hiver-type 
Manipulation, I can\'t think of the specific word] therein, I began to 
wonder.  Is the book implying that the Supressions weren\'t as big a deal 
as we\'ve been previously led to believe, and that psionic study was 
never very common or socially acceptable, or is this just another case 
of game-balance-concerns combined with sloppy editing? >>
     
Perhaps, in the early 3I, psionics were still not well understood. There 
was little organisation between Institutes, and not enough demand and/or 
money for a large number of them. As time passes, they will become more 
common, peaking immediately before the Suppressions (when was that, 
about 600?), at which point the numbers will rapidly drop off again.

Mmmhhh... doesn\'t the timeline on page 9 mention that the third imperium 
lasted from 4521 to 5637 AD?  This would make 4521 AD the foudning year, 
wouldn\'t it?  4521 AD + 1105 = 5626 AD.  Page 9 again states that the 
rebellion starts in 5367 AD. 5367 AD < 5626 AD.  Am I totally confused, 
totally stupid or is this yet another ting for the errata :-} ?

Hmmm... if this is so, I have to take back my complaint.  The right colun 
on page 57 of the rulebook (\'The Effects of Wounds\') seems to be a bit 
unclear to me:

>>Wound points are applied to ... physical characteristics. _Each die_
rolled is taken as a _single wound or group of wounds_. ... Normally, the 
player of the wounded character may decide which ... characteristic 
receives a specific die of wound points ... The execption is the _first 
wound_ received ... The damage points of this first wound are all applid 
to a single ... characteristic determined randomly.<<

The parts enclosed in _..._ made me think that this just referred to the 
first wound die (wasn\'t it handled this way in CT or is my memory 
failing?).  Your explanation sounds more reasonable anyway.  I\'ll 
definitely use it that way.  Thanks.

There\'s not much out there about Naval Bases, and really nothing that comes to 
mind about big orbital bases.  The Traveller Adventure has some information 
about a Naval Base, and there was a MegaTraveller adventure with info about a 
Naval Depot (that might have been DGP, though).  Usually, when a base is 
mentioned there is a groundside element and an orbital element.  The ground 
element serves smaller ships and small craft (say 5000 tons or less) and has 
barracks and storage areas.  The orbital area would service the bigger ships, 
and have extensive repair facilities for those large ships.

>If not, what is a reasonable displacement? 100,000? 500,000? a million? 
>I am talking about a naval base for the Sword Worlds at this point.

If you were looking to build an orbital complex that would CONTAIN the repair 
facilities, I would say the bigger the better.  1,000,000 tons would not be 
unreasonable, but I would consider a multi-million ton hull (extrapolate the 
values from whichever ship design sequence you use).  However, I think it would 
be fairly wasteful to build a base like that.  Instead, you would probably want 
an open framework or dispersed structure, with lots of long arms to hang 
modules off of and to allow ships to dock.  You would have several adjustable 
frameworkds that would be moved to surround ships in repair like a scaffolding 
to allow ease of access for outside repair crews and heavy equipment.

Now, just because its a big, spindly open structire does not mean the base is 
weak in terms of defense.  You\'ve got all the room you need to add on crew and 
power modules.  You could realistically plug in however many spinal-type 
weapons you want or can afford.  You\'ve got virtually infinite places to dock 
squadrons of small interceptors, larger fighters or SDBs.  You could have so 
much sensor redundancy as to make blinding the station impossible (short of 
vaporizing the thing).   And yes, I would have networks of sensor satellites 
and unmannded sensor stations scattered around the system.  The Light Speed 
delay on the signals would make these tactically unhelpful, but on an 
operational/strategic level the data they would provide would be priceless.

For the very rich and ambitious, you could have a Balck Globe around vital 
areas, with lots of room for plenty of energy sinks to take up the power that 
the globe absorbs.  The base does not need to be one continuous artifact, 
either; it could be dozens of stations around some arbitrary point in orbit, a 
series of geosynchronous stations, or even a vast field of old retired naval 
hulls converted into a series of base modules (this is what I usually use).

Remember when designing your base there are a couple of limiting factors; money 
and personnell.  The bigger you make you base, the more it costs and the more 
crew it requires.  For a Sector Fleet headquarters orbiting the Sector capital, 
an expensive base makes sense.  For a Naval Base with a Heavy Cruiser Squadron, 
a large base is possible, but not nearly as big as the first one I mentioned.  
For a Patrol Squadron base on some C Starport world off the beaten path, the 
base is probably going to be fairly small and lacking in features or luxuries.  
The Sword Worlds is not a huge empire, and its bases are probably going to be 
on the lean side.  Given their history of warfare (internal and external) I 
would imagine their bases are literally armed to the teeth.  And the Sword 
Worlds people are heavily into personal glory and bravado from what GDW 
background I\'ve seen; give the base lots of small fighters and some really 
kick-ass SDBs.  Even in defense, I would expect the Sword Worlders to prefer 
more "aggressive" methods than passive shields or short-range laser batteries 
on the base.

>How large a fleet do the Sword Worlds possess? How large for the 
>Darrians? What would be the typical squadron stationed at a naval base?
In my campaign, I gave the Sword Worlds a fleet with a heavy Raider emphasis.  
Like the Germans in WWII, the Sword Worlds is badly outclassed in Naval terms 
by their neighbor (the Imperium).  They have some good ships, but their only 
chance of survival/success is to use tactics and methods not practiced by its 
adversary.  I only had a couple of Sword Worlds "Battle Fleets", but plenty of 
independant raider squadrons centered around a large (100,000 ton) Pocket 
Battleship or Pocket Carrier.  I gave the Darrians a smaller fleet, built along 
Imperial lines, but with several TL16 squadrons to help even the odds.  I don\'t 
have my notes, but IIRC the Sword Worlds fleet had two Battle Fleets each with 
a Battle Squadron (12 ships, 6 BBs or BCs), a Carrier Squadron (12 ships, 1 
Fleet Carrier, 6 smaller CVs), four or five Cruiser Squadrons (12 ships each, 
usually 4 Hvy Cruiser, 6 Lt Cruiser) and about a dozen escort, destroyer, 
support or transport squadrons.  Then they also had about a dozen Raider Groups 
of about 24 ships each.  About 12 of each squadron were smaller (5000 tons or 
less) and there was a Pocket BB and a Pocket CV in each squadonr.  All ships 
were Jump 4 minimum.

Hope this helps.  When you decide what to do, post your final result.  I would 
love to see it.

Well...Given that the creator of "Macho Women with Guns" is a member
of the IG staff... :-)

One of my MWG publications (I think it\'s the latest release, combining
Macho Women with Guns, Bat Winged Bimbo from Hell, & Regenage Biker Nuns)
has a SF section, complete with modified TNE character sheets!

Hmmm....I smell a tie in here!  Hey Greg, is there going to be a Traveller
based MWG module?  Perhaps the JATS will continue the Challenge tradition
of an annual swimsuit issue... :-)

  There was a "high port" traveller supplement in Dragon magazine, quite a
while back. I still have it somewhere but nowhere handy...

   I\'d say a *minimum* of 1MT, more like 4-5MT for a decent sized orbital
facility used for refits and manufacturing.

  *Any* major space power (and the Sword Worlds are arguably that) will
have extended sensor facilities, such as scout pickets and satellites at
an arbitrary perimiter (probably measured in AU)

   Any likely space minefield would likely be groups of SIMs deposited,
maintained, and *controlled* by a minesweeper type vessel. Power
requirements would be such that the minesweeper would have to keep station
near the missiles and probably keep a rotating maintenance schedule. (If
the \'sweeper has 60 missiles available, maybe 40 would be "on station" at
any given time, the rest being inspected and having their batteries
recharged) Because of the maintenance requirements, it isn\'t likely you\'ll
see a widely spread out "field", but rather a few densely packed
(relatively speaking) groups covering strategic approaches.

   SIMs (Semi-Independant Missiles) have their own passive sensors, and
are VERY small targets. The sensors would have EFFECTIVE targetting ranges
on the order of 100,000km, since they are passive in nature and the
missile is so small this makes them very difficult to detect. Since they
have their own sensors, the \'sweeper need not use it\'s own (revealing
itself) to fire the missiles.

   For logistical purposes, missiles displace 1/2 ship ton, and mass
seven metric tons. When designing a minesweeper, you should factor in
additional facilities for maintaining the "mines" and additional crew for
manning missile control stations.

   Go for point defence, main weapons would be provided by escorting
vessels on patrol. Use Adventure 5 (TCS) to determine how big the naval
budget would be, and how big the entire standing fleet would be.

I\'ll buck the trend here and say that this might be reasonable.  Do 
you know why they charge you a million credits to join up?  It\'s so 
that the Society can actually *afford* to get you those high passage
tickets!

The TAS pays out a high passage ticket every eight weeks, or six and
a half tickets each year per member.  The members are permitted to 
sell these tickets off -- it says so.  In classic Traveller, it said
you could sell a ticket for 80% of face value.  So, our young marine
could earn kCr 52 each year by converting all his tickets to cash 
and depending on working passages.  Not bad, and a 5.2 percent 
annual return on the original million.  In twenty years, that pays 
off the initial megacredit initiation fee, even assuming that you
don\'t reinvest the proceeds.  Of course, our friend the marine had
the initial million put up for him by someone; the Marines, the Navy,
the Society itself, or someone like that, so losing the initial 
megacredit isn\'t a problem.  Must have done something good.

This also means that the TAS has to find some way to earn six and a 
half percent interest on that million to pay for the tickets at full  
face value.  They can get some more money from service fees at the
hostels, of course, but those always seemed to be near-cost.  Also,
it appears that the TAS keeps the initial megacredit even after the
member has died, so these monies might be used to make it easier for
the TAS to keep within budget.  Perhaps the Imperial government, via
the Ministry of Transportation, sells the passes at bulk rate to the
Society -- part of the Imperium\'s mission has always been to foster
interstellar tourism and travel....

In any case, I wouldn\'t consider that it unbalances anything.  
Remember, some players come out of character generation with starships 
worth tens of millions of credits -- a single megacredit pales next to
that.

I got the following from Mr Porter (Greg that is)

3G^3 damage values are based on energy in Joules, and is:

I find it sort of odd that they didn\'t make any attempt to match the
old material. It is a very curious decision on their part. Clearly, they
must have had access to this material. I\'m sure GDW got a copy of everything
that DGP ever put out for Traveller, and when the rights transferred to
Marc Miller, it would only make sense that he\'d be the person to get the
huge pile-o-stuff that must have been piling-up in their library.

I\'m wondering if, after the terror of the GDW/T$R lawsuit concerning
Dangerous Journys, Marc Miller & IG didn\'t decide to abandon from the
"Canon" everything produced by a third-party (such as DGP) simply as
a means of self-protection from future legal tricks. After all, if my
facts on this are correct, IG doesn\'t own the old DGP material. Hence,
they might feel obliged to render all this material (which was quite
good, IMHO) non-official.

I\'m not saying that this is IG\'s or Marc Miller\'s mindset, but it would
explain their actions to some degree, particularly if it turns out that
the CT/MT "Atlas" was based on DGP-generated UWP data which might well
have been the case. I\'ve recently been asking Miller about his copyright
policy, particularly as concerns sector data. His response:

Marc Miller hasn\'t yet replied to me. I don\'t know if he\'s too busy or if
it\'s something else. The bottom line for myself, however, is that any RPG
that doesn\'t allow fans to share their own game-related material isn\'t worth
sinking money (much less time) into. I would be nice if IG would keep the
T4 universe compatible with previous editions of the official setting,
however, it\'s small-beans compared to the issue over whether or not they
will give fans like us the rights to share in the setting by sharing our
own world write-ups, character write-ups, adventures, starship designs,
etc., all (preferably) in the context of the official setting (which is
the reason behind my question concerning free-use of sector data). This
is the question that, in my mind at least, is _most_ pressing. It is a
question that we should get answered as soon as possible, so that we\'ll
know exactly where IG and Marc Miller stand when it comes to us, the
game\'s fans.

Sorry if this sounds like a rant. Other opinions would be most welcome.

!?!  What a strange place to draw the line  :-)

I would draw the line far before this.  I\'ve played in games like this
where the player\'s role-playing skills and REAL LIFE knowledge were used
pretty much exclusively (the character sheets acted more like a
"background" for the character as opposed to the limits of his or her
abilities).  This also meant that the characters in one campaign seemed
more-or-less identical to ones in previous campaigns because all of the
*players* were the same (even though the character sheets stated
otherwise).

Well, I didn\'t see the originals, they were all gobble-de-gook on this end,
but I do know that many many tech schools are only 2 year degrees.  Maybe
this would help limit the Edu stuff.

history of the Traveller Universe! And, incidently, coming up with
models that can explain the published "data."

Well, you asked for it (he said, hefting his flame thrower...) so here
goes...			8^)

Some weak points in your scenario:

1) The Solomani Hypothosis postulated that Humaniti originated on Terra, and
that they were scattered about known space by a technological power called
the \'Ancients\' about whom nothing was known. It wasn\'t discovered that
the Ancients and Droyne were the same until 1107 or so (by player
characters going on the adventure "Twilight\'s Peak"), five centuries
after the Solomani Hypothosis was proven.

Before the Solomani Hypothesis, it wasn\'t clear where Humaniti\'s
homeworld was, or how they got scattered about known space. Every human
race had at least one (often chauvinistic) theory about its origins.
(The Archaean Thesis is a beautiful example of one, but there were
probably at least 40 other theses much like it ---- one for each race.)

It wasn\'t until Terra joined the Imperium in the 7th or 8th century,
that Devroe\'s hypothesis was proven. 

2) There was no big push on the emperor\'s part to reach Terra. Heck, the
empire reached the Spinward Marches 60 years after its founding. During
this time it virtually ignored its rimward frontier. Obviously, the
Solomani Hypothesis did not loom very large in the minds of the
governing class.

		
Actually, I have my own model to explain point #2. You didn\'t ask to
hear it, but here goes anyway... 8^)

Cleon was so obsessed with pushing spinward because according to the
information of his archeologists and his IISS, the Spinward Marches were
the statistical center of the distribution of Ancient sites. He guessed
(correctly, as it turns out) that the Marches contained the Ancients\'
homeworld. And he wanted to reach them before the perfidious Zhodani
did. 

Why was he so impressed with Ancient sites? Perhaps he had some secret
Ancient technology that helped him gain or hold power. And he needed
more, MORE! Bwahahahahaha.

At any rate, the rimward frontier was (as far as I can tell) pretty much
ignored. (This impression of mine was recently reinforced when I saw T4
with its map of Core subsector in the back. Cleon wasn\'t exactly gung ho
for looking rimward!) This unconcern for Terra lasted until the royal
family, with its characteristic disregard for Solomani sensibilities,
sanctioned the marriage of Emperor Zhakirov to  a /Vilani/ woman.
<Hisssss>

After that, the Solomani nobility, in an attempt to hold power against a
rising Vilani tide, began pushing for Terra, and promoting Devroe\'s
Solomani Hypothesis as a rationale for keeping control of the reins of
government. This political movement culminated with the creation of the
Solomani Autonomous Region in the 9th - 10th centuries. But that\'s
another story...

I don\'t know who people guessed the Ancients were. I suppose some
Solomani extremists may have thought that /they/ were the Ancients.
At least until 1107, when they would have been proven wrong at
Twilight\'s Peak. (Assuming the PC\'s were successful, of course. 8^)

The Psionic Suppressions were basically a failed psychohistory experiment 
aimed at actually fostering greater acceptance of psionics.  The result 
of this experiment was the equating of psionics with Zhodani influence.  
Since there are likely very few people in the Third Imperium in Year 0 
who could tell you who/what a Zhodani is, this isn\'t much of a problem.  
The state of psionics before the Suppressions was pretty much as is 
described in T4 -- socially accepted, but somewhat rare; there just 
aren\'t that many psionics in Year 0, since it\'s only been a teachable, 
learnable science for a couple of centuries at this point.

The T4 editors weren\'t sloppy -- it\'s just that the Suppressions aren\'t 
going to occur for another eight centuries or so.

That\'s more or less exactly what happened prior to the 800s, near as I 
can recall.

I have to agree with Joe on this one.  Role-playing isn\'t meant to be
competitive like professional sports, so one player shouldn\'t necessarily
have a better chance at a specific task than another (when skill levels and
target numbers are the same), unless it specifically involves problem
solving.  I sometimes have problems with players that don\'t really know the
true definition of roleplaying ("acting in character" and not "acting as
YOURSELF acting in character") and try to use their own knowledge instead
of that of their characters.  Just last weekend, one player tried to use
his vast knowledge of concrete (strengths, weaknesses, etc.) to determine
how his character would breach a wall.  Or my personal favourite: a player
claiming that his character\'s willpower stat is at human maximum so they
*should* be able to naw off their own wrists to get out of a set of
handcuffs.  This type of behaviour is probably one of the hardest skills to
master as a roleplayer.  Try having your male players roleplay female
characters to the point that your female players find their performances
realistic.  Try playing a character with split-personality disorder and
keep the relative knowledge of each personality seperate.

ROLE-playing should reward creative thinking as long as it is within the
capabilities of the actual characters involved (eg: is the character
statistically intelligent enough to even come up with the player\'s plan?).
This also includes simple things like disallowing a player\'s knowledge of
the formula for gunpowder in a fantasy setting, even though the ingredients
may be readily available.

ROLL-playing should be fun and not favour anyone in particular, just
because one person\'s acting skills are better than another (eg: don\'t keep
insisting that every character of a particular player be the group\'s voice
in order to gain die modifiers, just because that player happens to have
good conversational skills).

Sorry, maybe I missed something, but where did the Hivers have an
involvement with the psionic supressions? I always thought it was the
Zhodani, but maybe I missed something... ?

That particular section was taken verbatim from the Wounding and Death 
section of The Traveller Book (and, for that matter, from Book 1: 
Characters and Combat).  So, I just went with what I\'d always assumed it 
meant.  Maybe I\'ve been wrong all these years...

Granted, it is poorly worded.  But, to me, it doesn\'t make sense any other 
way.  That "the exception is the first wound received" portion doesn\'t 
make sense unless it is referring to the entire total of all damage dice 
rolled for the initial hit.  If it\'s just referring to one die (as it 
appears to be since it uses the term "wound" as it does above to refer to 
a single die\'s value), then there\'s not much of an effect from the first 
hit. Big deal - one die is randomly applied.  

So, while you are definitely correct that it is poorly worded, I\'ve 
played it the other way because that is how I\'ve interpreted it all these 
years.

Was I wrong?

James,

I agree with what you are saying, and I\'d like to add to that, if I may.  

Judging where to draw the line is definitely a balancing act.  On the one 
extreme, you have players who (as you note) are just "acting" the role of 
themselves w/ perhaps a bit of imaginary background thrown in.  On the 
other extreme, you have a bunch of statistics and a bunch of die rolling.

Ideally, every role-player would be a superlative actor.  Since this 
isn\'t the case, we have to make compromises.  Your\'ve probably found a 
really good balance for your group, as have I for mine.  And, as has been 
said before, as long as folks are having fun, it doesn\'t matter where 
they draw the line on such things.

But, I would highly recommend that everyone at least /try/ the method of 
acting in character - pretending to know only what your character would 
know, pretending to have the mental limitations of the character, etc.  I 
also strongly recommend trying out different roles, rather than sticking 
to one or two standard personality "boilerplates," as we\'ve all probably 
done at one time or another.

If the role is played right, you can do away with a lot of die rolling.  
If not, you either end up with poorly portrayed characters, or a whole 
lotta die rolling and little role-play.

Is that similar to what you have found, James?

Yes!  This is what /I/ mean by "Referees should be sadistic."  Not that 
we should be "out to get" the PC\'s (unless one is playing Cthulu or 
Paranoia, that is[G]), but that one should keep them appropriately "on

Nice work. :)   Such things make the game a lot more interesting, IMO.  
They add depth.  The story itself may be riveting, but it still benefits 
from such side-lights.

Matt,

True, that would be a factor.  But more than that, I\'m concerned with 
achieving a bit of balance between Tech/Trade school and 4-year college.  
Tech school is, as far as I know, a place where one learns job skills, 
not general education material.  This fits nicely into the T4 system IMO, 
if Tech schools perhaps provide 2 skills per year, and no Edu bonus.  It 
will help to differentiate those who go to Trade/Tech school and those 
who go to college.

At least, that\'s the way I see it.

Jim, that\'s the best theory I\'ve heard so far.  It makes a lot of sense.

If you supply enough power can you eliminate the need for HPGs in each

black globe power etc.  But at these TLs it takes more volume to store
energy in an HPG than it does to generate the same amount of power.

Along the same lines why do Jump drives require std \'fuel\'.  A jump engine
just turns that fuel into energy to make a jump.  Why can\'t you provide
that energy by other means?

Thanks for any help.

True, but they _would_ work for giant ants, which would be OK in Space 1889
if not Traveller.  (Come to that, I\'ve got plans somewhere for ant-like
critters with proper lungs and all, suitable for frightening adventurers
with.)

Only problem is, I\'ve never seen any (plastic ants).  Didn\'t know they made
them.  Have to start digging around.  The local hobby shops not having any,
and same with Toys-R-Us, guess I\'ll have to find a novelty shop.  Time for
the yellow pages...

I had a similar experience where I live.  Nonetheless, I feel that the 
sell-out of T4 (and the way the Armory was caught flat-footed after 
having only ordered a couple of dozen of the things when their customers 
(retail stores for whom they act as distributor) ended up demanding far, far 
more) will generate more awareness of the product.  Something that sells 
out that quickly is bound to generate some discussion among retailers and 
distributors.

Or so my theory goes. :)

Most miniatures are cast in RTV molds, which are essentially
rubber...they wear out. At this point, the manufacturer has to decide
if it is worth making a new production mold or not (which costs
money).

Not to mention the override that prevents the chip user from

interesting possibilities.

Almost all RPG Combat systems have hit rates that are much too high.
Consider the various figures on the _thousands_ of rounds expended per
casualty in WWII, Korea, Vietnam, etc. There are cases of police
officers (in the heat of a gunfight) firing six rounds at less than 10
feet (!), and missing with all six. Anyway, all systems err on the "to
hit" side of the ledger...some more than others.

To me Steward would combine such things as cooking, bartending, operating
and maintaining the cleaning equipment, providing for the entertainment of
the passengers, keeping an eye on things
(security), making sure life support is working and supplied,
stocking supplies for the ship, and on small ships usually handling gunnery
duties.

After the Engineer, the Steward (or Purser) is the most important crewman
on a passenger carrying ship..IMO. <g>

Certainly plausible. The more powerful the computer, the bigger your
coolant system must be. In Drexler\'s _Foresight_ newsletter, I read a
speculative article which suggested it might be possible to construct a
desktop nanoputer that could, in theory at least, outperform all the human
brains on the planet combined. Problem is, it would need a coolant system
the size of a ten-storey building...

By the way, I suspect that much of this "huge Traveller computers" thread
is based on CT (and perhaps MT and TNE, which I never read). Has anyone
noticed that this problem seems to have "gone away" with T4? As far as I
can tell, in QSDS, there is no step in the design sequence for "Select
Computer Model".

Now I\'ve been out of the loop for a while so correct me if I\'m wrong, but
did computer model and mass simply get simplified out when they created
QSDS? Will the design system in _Starships_ once again include a selection
of computer models and masses?

As far as I can see, QSDS computers are assumed to be able to run just
about any software you can throw at them, so long as the programs are of
equal or lower Tech Level (pg 90), and their mass and cost is either too
small to count, or they\'re included in the mass and cost of the various
componants. In any case, there\'s no mention in T4 of the model or mass of
shipborne computers.

Wondering,

  No, Da"niken\'s stuff clearly supports the Solomani hypothesis, ie
he thinks all that stuff was left by *alien* spacefarers (for example
the Ancients), not Homo Sapiens Sapiens.

  (My only beef with the Solomani hypothesis is indeed that it

  The Solomani hypothesis does *not* mention that the Ancients are the
Droyne. All it assumes is that they Ancients arn\'t Solomani or Geonee.

Nope, however, those books which arrived 3 weeks early ARE suffering

I feel that EDU is a reflection of a) the ammount of education the 
character has, and b) the _effective_ education a character recieves. 
Technical schools represent workplace knowledge more usable than say a 
collage degree. If there is too much problems, make it +1 per 2 years.

Even CT (well Book 4) had combat engineering, and since I am planning 
"work gangs to the stars" campaign, I needed those skills and the Tech 
schools, so that the players have the minimal skills needed to get hired.

It could almost work, excpet that this makes Tech schools seem a lot more 
powerful than collages. Maybe if you did it this way

1 year : Skill only
2 years : Skill + a choice of +1 edu or second skill
3 years : 2 Skills and a choice of + 1 EDU or third skill

I does make it a bit of a pain, as i was looking at keeping it simple. 
Maybe +1 EDU per 2 years is a better choice after all.

This is also the case down under, where you can get an associate diploma

I *like* it Barry!  One of the things that I have integrated within my

Furthermore, because of the conflicting theories, scientists and organizations 
can become somewhat factious at times.  This provides endless sources of 
adventure hooks and ideas.  Just because a bunch of fanatical bigots grab an 
idea and violently force its acceptance on others doesn\'t mean the idea isn\'t 
true.  But imagine the difficulty getting people to accept the truth once it 
is associated with some negative philosophy, movement or circumstances.

As old as the 3rd Imperium is, (or in the confusion during the Rule of Man) 
imagine how the many different threads of research and hypotheses become 
tangled and ideas take on more meaning to people than mere knowledge!  Imagine 
what kind of superstition would be promulgated over the centuries.  Oh, the 
possibilities are endless!  (Remember the good old days when nobody knew 
anything about the mysterious \'Ancients\' and grandfather wasn\'t even heard 
of?)  Signal GK was a really great resource, but it made public knowledge the 
deepest secret of the GDW Imperium backdrop -- <sigh>.

While I\'ve only read Prisoner\'s hope, I must agree that Feintuch is a 
compelling author.  One of the most outstanding things is his depiction of a 
toxically religious military man -- I had flashbacks of the rigidly structured 
religious services in the USMC -- I kept hoping the main character would run 
into a chaplain who would absolve him of his guilt!  A great read!

This was one of the factors that contributed my return to Traveller after 7+ 
years.  I thoroughly enjoyed the depth I was allowed to see into the character 
and his relationships.  If I ever include widespread organized religion in my 
Imperium, it would be because of Feintuch\'s influence.

I spose we aren\'t too far apart in this after all, it\'s just that I haven\'t 
had a consistant group of players long enough to _really_ learn about the 
universe.  As far as I\'m concerned, the Zhodani would probably be the only 
cosmic-scale threat for the players in my 3rd Imperium setting: nothing like 
the virus; giant jump-space fish (ala Feintuch); no Gamalons(tm) or 
Cylons(tm); no omipotent \'Q\' toying with the PCs; no Galactic 
Armageddon...etc.

My vision of the Imperium is a homogenous mix of struggles and secrets, wars 
and rumors of wars, and the constant struggle of masses upon masses of people. 
 History has many fulcrums.  The only cosmic-scale threat might be to the _way 
of life_ that allows the PCs to do what they do, again, such as the threat of 
Zhodani conquest -- but the *threat* of Zhodani aggression serves my purpose 
more than the actual realization of that threat.  

But whatever it is, the cosmic-scale threat should not undo my effort trying 
to convince the players that the Imperium and surrounding regions are really 
vast... and truly homogenous.   If a virus or berserker fleet (a la 
Saberhagen) is all over the place, then the "universe" may appear (to the 
players) to be pretty much the same all over, with the same enemy to fight, 
and it\'s size matters not (We\'ve just got this job to do, and playing 
Traveller means "doing that job").  

The Imperium might then appear to be a only permutation of the "world" in a 
Fantasy RPG.  In FRPG, players all to often think it\'s the job of the ref to 
send adventure their way...  My goal is to create an Imperium so plausible, 
and so compelling, that the players will WANT to go out and explore it, or do 
business in it, or leech off it, or build something in it.  My reasons for 
being a member of TML stems directly from that; I want to glean as many ideas 
from others to add even more variety to my campaign.  (It\'s late, I hope all 
that came across clear and understandable).

     installation*, not a standard package that is placed in orbit around 
     every world marked N. 
     
     We do know that Naval bases are capable of refuelling, recrewing, 
     rearming and (maybe) repelling warships, but they may have a range of 
     capabilities. 
     
     A naval base could therefore be anything from: 
     
     1. a dirt-based facility at an E-class port, with a small office with 
     a base commander and a few technicians capable of refuelling and 
     overhauling some engine components. Defences? Handguns, perhaps some 
     automated antipersonnel lasers inside for security. 
     2. an orbital station (what many games/films would call a \'starbase\')
     3. a training facility 
     4. an entire world (if low pop, asteroid, target range or the like)- 
     but only Naval Depots are system-wide
     5. a moon of a gas giant in the system (good means of defence, 
     especially if there is only one gas giant - but let\'s not open up that 
     discussion again) 
     6. a hidden facility, especially if close to enemy territory; possible 
     hiding places include asteroid belts, gas giant ring systems, hot 
     planets (eg Mercury), comets, rogue worlds/planetoids with highly 
     elliptical orbits, ...)
     7. a small office with a purchasing officer and a whole heap of 
     vouchers ("Okay guys, now you can get everything you need at the local 
     Quik-E-Port"). All services (refuelling, overhaul, refit etc) 
     contracted out to local port businesses, in exchange for Imperial 
     promissory notes. 
     
     One thing: a Naval Base is *not* a shipyard. The Imperium seems to 
     build most ships by contract to local shipyards.

     (other than proofreading!)? Here\'s some to start: 
     
     1. Pre-orders: Imperium Games gives discounts plus various other 
     goodies for people who are willing to pay up-front for upcoming 
     supplements. Although this means buying products sight unseen, it will 
     give them a big incentive (and the resources) to produce and promote 
     the stuff. Encourage as many as possible to subscribe to the Journal 
     of the Travellers\' Aid Society! These preorder clients would get 
     special benefits, such as having their supplements autographed by the 
     team and so on (heh heh heh, Marc Miller is going to have one HUGE 
     hand at the end of all this...)
     
     2. Land Grants: fans pay for the honour of having their own star 
     system (somewhere outside the canon-defined area). Fans can detail 
     their own star system within IG-defined rules (ie a certain time 
     limit, not to contain new major races etc etc), then submit it to IG 
     for amendment/approval. If all goes well and it doesn\'t break too many 
     rules/insult the sacred Canon, it would be included in a future 
     supplement. 
     
     2a. Same as for Land Grants, except the star systems, subsectors and 
     even (gasp!) some of the distant sectors are auctioned off. Note that 
     these could possibly go to organisations like HIWG or even TD. 
     
     3. Take cash off fans to have their characters (oh! already being 
     done), ship designs, alien races, included in the Canon somewhere. 
     
     4. A Map Club "Imperial Grand Survey". Special benefits for paid-up 
     members For example, *exclusive* nifty black starchart of Core sector 
     for members *only*; followed up annually by similar charts of Vland, 
     Spinward Marches, Antares,  etc as the various Milieux Books are 
     released; these starcharts would be accompanied with extra special 
     books something like the Spinward Marches or Solomani Rim \'black book\' 
     supplements. 
     
     5. Charge people money to name their children/pets after famous 
     Traveller characters, places and so on "Oh my god Norris, stop 
     smearing your $h*t on the wall! And leave Kinunir alone..."
     
     6. Take out a copyright on the name \'Beowulf\'. Sue English lit 
     departments everywhere and romp home with the cash (joke for other 
     decrepit old fogies from the Black Book Era (BBE))
     
     7. Some kind of collectible card game (CCG) WAIT! *Hold those flames!* 
     Perhaps an abbreviated, *superquick* ship combat/character combat 
     system could be adapted to cards, for those of us that ain\'t too keen 
     on all the dice-rolling. Different strokes for different folks, 
     folks...

I think I figured out the problem. It\'s the lack of a nozzle that kills
the thrust. Some of those molecules will be exiting almost parallel to
the hull, others at right angles, and all angles between these two
extremes. So only the portion of the "pressure" or velocity that is at
right angles to the hull will actually go towards moving the ship.

Possible, but *much* more likely is something dug *well* into an
asteroid, moon, or even the surface of a planet. What you are thinking
of is merely a dockyard & mooring area. In Star Trek, with Shields, you
can defend such a base. In traveller, lacking such things, you need
*armor* And the easiest way to do it is dig in to something.

Consider the problems with trying to attack a base that is built into a
nickel iron asteroid 20 km in diameter. The vital installations are in
there *somewhere*, but where? The locations would be classified, and
the transit tunnels/corridors would be laid out with an eye to making
it hard to figure out where things were in relation to each other.

Anything short of relativistic rocks can pound on such a base until
they (the attacker) run out of fuel and supplies, and do little damage
except to surface features.

For a surface installation (ie something on the mainworld), dig back a
few months and find my posts on what a spaceport would probably look
like, and then fortify the hell out of it.

Go to the library and look up articles on NORAD\'s command center under
Cheyenne mountain. This is the TL6/TL7 equivalent. If you want to take
it out you have to destroy a *mountain* first!

Check out the British base at Gibraltar. Same idea, but at lower tech.
You dig into a *lot* of rock.

Nope. And any intelligently designed base, even at say, TL8, will be
almost invulnerable to any attacking fleet unless they are willing to
use "planet wrecker" grade weaponry.

Try something more like quintillions or sextillions of DT. A 5 km
diameter, roughly spherical asteroid is about 5e18 (5 sextillion)
displacement tons. 

Remember, since it doesn\'t need drives, you save money. You don\'t have
to *build* the hull, you just have to excavate tunnels, and build stuff
into it.

Heck, every once and a while I\'d ask a player about one of his
character\'s characteristics and have him roll a die. Then go on as if
nothing had happened.

Another good one is to pass notes to players, or take them into the
other room for a minute. If you pass notes, make them return it after
reading it, that way, if it was just to induce paranoia they can\'t go
"Look, it was nothing!". And just watch them *try* to convince everyone
that you didn\'t discuss anything important with them.  :-)

It\'s also good to leave things unexplained. Things that the players
cannot figure out or explain, and never will be able to. If they obsess
on one of them, you may wind up with a new adventure. If not, it keeps
them aware that not *everything* odd has to be part of the plotline.

(There\'s absolutely *no* truth to the rumor that the first humans to
open a sealed building at an Ancients site that had been buried for at
least a hundred thousand years found "Kilroy was here" scribbled on the
wall. None whatsoever! :-)

OK, I think I can reply in a calm, collected and polite manner now.

Some of us receive TML in digest form, and the mime stuff in the original 
message simply came out as junk in the middle of the digest.

A good reason for our limitation affecting the rest of you is that the 
original poster asked for comments on what was sent.  If I can\'t read it, I 
can\'t comment on it.

Thank you for your time.

Proot!

Actually, my reader handles MIME, but the digestifier usually makes
it unreadable to me anyway without a great deal of work. It is much
better if you can give an FTP or WWW address for non-textual matter.

However, you had put TEXT files in MIME format as well. There\'s no
reason to do that, other than to annoy those that don\'t have the
ability to read MIME.

And no, I don\'t think MIME is junk. It is a STANDARD for sending
binary files, unlike the old uuencode method which is done either
by hand or through a number of non-standard extensions. But the
digester DOES give it a hard time.

	The PP provides a steady energy flux, but lasers and a lot

	The HPG is like an high tech condensator.

	The PP only uses up a litle bit of LHy for one year fusion.
	The jump drive has a "very hot fusion chamber" for providing
	the high energy directly for the jump.

Gunnery is easy, we already have a skill for that.
Life Support would IMO be Engineering skill, but Steward duties.
Stocking supplies would be Trader/Broker (Possibly).  Again Steward duties.
Security - a combo of Perception and fighting skills. Definitely Steward duties.
Entertainment - Acting or Music or perhaps just Computer. Good for Steward.
Cleaning Equip - could be engineering or Mechanic.

Cooking/Bartending - This is what I think the Steward Skill is for but the
agruement could be made that Computer skill and the attributes Edu and Int
could be used instead.

Well, it can\'t be that bad. I got my softcover over 3 weeks ago.
And the store has allready gotten their second shippment of four

Third Party Licensees for CT & MT.  Got their start by publishing the 
Travellers\' Digest for CT.  Other CT works to their credit include 
Book 8 Robots (written by DGP staff, published by GDW) and 101 
Robots.

They played a large part in the consolidation and work on the 3 Book 
set for MegaTraveller, + the Referee\'s Companion that followed for 
GDW.  In addition, they published all of the following for MT:

101 Vehicles
Vilani & Vargr (aka Bogs & Dogs)
Solomani & Aslan (aka Rats & Cats)
World Builders Handbook
Starship Operators Manual, Volume 1
Knightfall (published by GDW, but written by DGP staff)
Flaming Eye
MegaTraveller Journal

For the most part, their stuff is of excellent quality, but was 
always a little more difficult to find than GDW\'s...  Worth snatching 
up if you find a deal...

DGP has reformed under the ownership of Roger Sanger, who\'s been 
quiet of late...

> What is GDW-Beta?

A mailing list mostly concerned with Rules Development.  Originally 
formed for testing and comments on the FF&S system, the mailing list 
was also responsible for helping develop and test the QSDS system in 
the T4 rules, and the SSDS system to be in the upcoming Starships 
book...

Hope this helps...

For the 1st few months, the baby, hands down...especially if she\'s 
colicky.  I speak from personal experience, since I have 2 
sons...3-1/2 years & 10 months...  Hell, I didn\'t have a chance to open 
a book with my oldest 1 until he was about 2...

Yes I am.

Its 50 maps of starbases. It also has a few pages about starport

maps are okay, and since I have it, I\'ll use them, but I wouldn\'t buy it.

reestablished in secret.  So there are the same number of Psionic
Institutes in 1100 as in 0. Just now they are secret and illegal. 
During the Psionic Supressions there would be even fewer psionic institutes.

I say you leave Edu alone...or maybe a +1 for the term if you wish.  
Most Technical Schools have a narrow emphasis on teaching a 
particular profession (translation: Skills) and generally don\'t teach 
anything outside of that narrow scope alone.  Heck, most technical 
schools don\'t even teach things outside of the discipline that would 
enable somebody to further their career, such as writing, 
communications, etc...

How do you know that the ATV isn\'t _already_ bent.  The shocks are

I have a few...
Pass a note to a player with the following on it...
"read this, scratch your chin, sign your name twice and smile at (other player) then hand 
this note back to me"
You then send a note to the other player with the following....

> How large a fleet do the Sword Worlds possess? How large for the

Based on what I can recall of TCS I can give you a few pointers:

Each Sword World has its own navy. In times of crisis the offensive ships
(those with jump drive) are consolidated and put under Confederation
control. To calculate the size of one planet\'s navy: Multiply the number
of citizens by 5000. Multiply by some factor (from 0.8 to 1.5 IIRC) to
reflect the government type. I can\'t remember the table, sorry. This will
give you the number of (local) credits the navy is worth. Decide how much
of this has been spent on the defensive armament and how much has been
spent on offensive (I\'d suggest 70% defense forces). Use the defensive
budget to buy non-jump starships and orbital defense sattelites and such
stuff. These ships would normally be built at the local TL, but if you 
wish you may have them buy smaller ships and fighters from friendly 
neighbors with a higher TL. Buy jump-capable starships for the offensive 
budget. These would also mostly be home-made, but there is a greater chance 
that some better TL ships has been bought. Don\'t forget to pay a bit more 
for these ships (5-10% more per tech level).

We don\'t know much about the Darrian Confederation navy, except that there
is a permanet one. Since it is a confederation I suggest that you split the 
individual planetary budgets into defensive ships, local jump-capable ships, 
and Confederation Navy ships. There is also several squadrons of TL 16 ships, 
but the Darrians hoard those and wouldn\'t expose them to danger unless 
absolutely necessary.

Yes, the Solomani hypothesis was probably one of the first major
theories to promote the origin of all humaniti on Terra. Until then,
everyone had their own idea. I read (somewhere) that there was a very
popular
proposal to tag humanity\'s homeworld somewhere-or-another on a planet
that had lots of flora/fauna biochemically similar to humans - except 
that it was in reality an Ancient zoo! Having no fossil record, it was
difficult to prove anything about it one way or another.

Hm. How could he have been racing the Zhodani to the Marches when the
Marches
are where the Imeprium met the Zhodani? The Zhodani fist contacted the
3rd
Imperium circa 500 3I, according to "Imperial Encyclopedia".

I doubt there was any consensus about who the Ancients were. It was
probably a generic term meaning "some race who lived and died a long
time ago". "Ancients" to Imperial archeologists (sp?) is probably like
the
word "Indian" today - you could probably apply the word "Indian" to
a quarter of the Earth\'s population in a bazillion different ways.

Anyways, good thesis. I mean, it\'s wrong, but hey, that\'s what makes it
so good. :)

    'body' => 'Well, someone asked about Vilani nobility, so I took my ownership
of a copy of V&V as a public responsibility and so I\'ll
dig through it. (How Vilani of me)

 * The Vilani have a fairly strict caste system, at least historically.
   (It was of course broken down during the 2nd Imperium).
   To quote:

    "In Vilani society, each individual takes his or her place
     within a caste for life. For each of us, our first role
     in life is to contribute to our chosen occupational caste."

   Note that this means that Vilani who were in leadership
   positions probably stayed there their entire lives, thus
   having their position in society translated into English as 
   "noble". If we consult the dictionary:

   noble /adj/ 1. having or showing high moral qualities
    2. belonging to a class of people who hold titles and
    high social rank 3. ...

  By typical definitions, most Viliani leaders would have fit
  this description - they had high standing and some sort
  of title and, as Vilani, they were not in positions of leader-
  ship for self-serving reasons, but because it was their
  ordained psoition in society and they were going to do a
  good job of it, for the good of the Vilani people in general.

  Pretty noble by Terran standards. ;)

 * The Vilani did not have governments as we know them - the
   Vilani bureaux were corporations and governments rolled 
   into one. Their employees were their citizens. They are
   like governments run for a profit (imagine!)

   Again to quote:

    "To abuse or oppress the \'citizens\' is a conflict in terms,
     since the citizens are also the customers. To make the
     customer unhappy is not good business sense."


 * Finally an actual point on nobility, a quote:

    "The nobility descended from the ancient village chiefs.
     The third child of every noble was a noble: the others
     were commoners. Higher nobles could create new, lower
     nobles." [Note that this rule broke down during the
     Rule of Man, as Vilani influences were replaced with
     Terran ones.]

   Vilani nobles have the same roots and origins as their
   Terran counterparts - as kings, dukes, chieftans, etc.
   The same titles would apply to the Vilani as they do to
   Princes, Kings, Queens, Dukes, etc these days.

Anyways, hope that\'s helpful!

I would also say it is reasonable to get the tickets.  However, I would
  probably rule that the character would use at least a couple of those
  high passages each year for vacations or business travel.  Depending on
  the character, that is.  If you play a miser, I\'d let you keep all the money.
  If you play a playboy type, you wouldn\'t get any.  C\'est la vie.

Yes.  Expect lots of stealthy picket ships coasting along using only
passive sensors.

Well, in the Trillion Credit Squadron campaign I ran many moons ago, the
typical  naval bases the players came up with were multiple buffered
planetoids - the more important the base, the more standard planetoids
would be used.  They each had a couple massive dispersed structures jump
tugs that they\'d use to move the bps from system to system.  Fixed
planetbound structures tended not to get used much as they can\'t dodge, and
it\'s generally only a matter of time before the orbiting fleet pinpoints
your deep meson sites and blows the crap out of them.

Bases without m-drives rapidly earned the nickname "skeet."

Typically, each rock would be barely large enough to support the biggest
spinal mount weapon they could build at their tech level, under the theory
that the more spinal mounts they could bring to a party, the better.  Don\'t
skimp on the defensive systems, though.  Other than the spinal mount, most
of the rocks weapon systems were devoted to defense.

Any place important enough to earn a significant base also typically had a
couple of thousand insystem fighters (once the supercarrier race started,
anyway), typically deployed from many small planetoids hidden in the
asteroid belt or in the gas giant lagrange points.

GDW-Beta is a mailing list, once part of the GDW team, now sort of 
transferred to IG...it\'s a bunch of people who rules hack and beta 
test stuff from the developers.  Informal,. and sometimes quite high 
traffic.  See Joe Heck\'s web page 
http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/ for details on subscribing.

DGP is Digest Group Publications, a now defunct games company that 
published many supplements for Traveller, both CT and MT, which leads 
me to my next point:

to the List:

"Why doesn\'t IG just reprint the DGP stuff?" and

"Why does Core look DIFFERENT???!!!"

	/rant mode -on

	First, neither IG or FarFuture Enterprises owns any rights to the 
DGP material, so they can\'t just go out and print it.

	Second, the DGP material available on the net, as in the fabled 
Genie/DGP sector data, from DGP\'s original Genie forum where they 
posted it.  There is much to like and a lot to dislike about this 
stuff. In the last, or next to last Challenge, someone, (I think it 
was Dave Nillson, damn when I\'m away from my books I can never spell 
his name right, sorry Dave) said the data resembled nothing so much 
as  a \'computer with it\'s needle stuck in a groove\'.  The data were 
generated by computer with a seriously flawed random number 
generator, or a program that didn\'t reseed the generator often 
enough, because it is highly repetitive.

	The data for the Core sector is worse, when I was messing about with 
it, getting it into a database to look at things like \'What is the 
Imperium Mean Tech level?\' and \'what is the Tech Level 
distribution?\', I had to throw out a number of worlds, simply because 
they were missing the entire UWP, and several had nothing but a UWP, 
leaving me to guess at population levels, etc.

	My preference is what IG seems to be doing, which is re-inventing 
the universe, more or less.

	To all of you who will immediately piss and moan about \'All my old 
stuff is no good anymore!!!\', tough.  If you HAVE to play \'in Canon\', 
buy the new stuff, otherwise adapt everything to your own universe. 

	Don\'t bitch at IG for not supporting everything that came
before...I think Marc stated quite clearly that T4 was intended to
be a re-creation of CT \'in light of 20 years of gaming experience\',
not a game burdened down with 20 years of add-ons...that\'s like
blaming Micr$oft for not supporting Win95 on a PC-XT. 

	I guess it\'s pretty clear where I stand...I started GM\'ing when
both D&D and Traveller were still TLB\'s, none of the people I\'ve
ever played with or GM\'ed thought a second about developing their
own world(s).  You\'re the GM: your word is Law (say it with a
Stallone-esque sneer "I YAM the LAW!") in your game.

	I appreciate background material as much or more than the other
guy, but I slip it into my universe, file off the serial numbers,
re-paint it, and then trot it out with fake ID papers. It truly
isn\'t that hard, and that way your players aren\'t ahead of you all
the time.

	In my D&D games, at the beginning of the campaign, I would whip out
the Monster Manual, and say: "See this...It lies, it lies horribly,
and if you believe it it WILL get you killed!"

	It did, too. I had things like intelligent Trolls ganging up with 
Hill Giants in black leather jackets.  Some rules lawyer tried to 
tell me that \'That can\'t work! Trolls aren\'t intelligent!\' 

	The troll eating him, then stopped long enough to recite the
Pythagorean Theorem, before finishing him off. "Mmmm...Chomp, Smack.
Tender, but with a hint of insolence. Rather good for Rules Lawyer!
They\'re usually tough and inflexible"

	Yeah, some of the art in T4 sucks...I believe no one has mentioned 
the \'bolt action\' shotgun yet, but throwing it out for that is truly 
tossing the baby out with the bath water.

	Comparing it to established Canon is also a mistake.  we\'ve had the 
long reign of the GDW church, and Marc has just nailed his \'99 
theses\' to the door. Paraphrasing: "General historical stuff will stay pretty much 
the same, but details will be clarified or expanded."

	Canon is internally so inconsistent now, that maintaining absolute 
fidelity is impossible. Besides how many of you \'Holy Canonists\' out 
there think Virus is NOT a heresy? Show of hands please?...

Much has been discussed about to-hit possibilities under T4 rules, but
what about lethality?  I understand that T4 is using CT\'s wound rules, but
I\'ll blaspheme and say that GDW\'s T2k-based "house system" handled this
better.  If CT/T4 combat represented the real world, war would be a rather
like paintball games, as the lethality is _way_ too low.  This leads to
unrealistically heroic D&D-style action where the players worry little
about their skins; players are always braver with characters who, no
matter how loved, can be re-rolled if killed, than real people tend to be.
This is probably a good thing, but can be taken too far.

The problem resides in the near-impossibility of a one-shot kill w/o using
called shots.  A black-powder pistol is given a rating of 2.  This
generates a _maximum_ damage of 12 which _cannot_ kill Joe Average (UPP
777777).  A damage-4 shotgun is necessary to get a one-shot kill
possibility, as the damage-3 maximum (T4 p.57) prevents even a TL-15 12cm
APFSDSBSD round from killing a normal man.  Perhaps a crit roll would
help this, or some sort of hit-location roll.

What does TML think?

While I didn\'t get out the flamethrower, I was one of those unable to read
your post, and not because my mailreader doesn\'t support MIME. I use Eudora
E-mail, which handles it just fine. Problem is, I don\'t get separate posts
from TML, I get the TML *Digest*, as do many others. (I share my e-mail
account with two other people, so to avoid confusion I subscribe to the
Digest.)

Since your MIME attachment appeared in the middle of the Digest, Eudora
read it as straight text. Garble garble garble. I tried to think of a way
to get Eudora to interpret it without too much work, but I quickly threw up
my hands.

Which reminds me - I wonder if anybody who skims through the TML Archives
is going to be able to parse a MIME attachment either?

My own recent posting of a T4 Combat Reference Sheet was screwed up because
I cut & pasted it from Word for Mac, so I know that it can be difficult
preparing something for e-mail. It would be appreciated, though.

As for my Refsheet - I\'ll try to clean it up and send it again.

A feature of The Traveller Book which I always found helpful, but=
 which I
was disappointed to see left out of T4, was the handy one-page listing=
 of
all the applicable attack DMs. (I\'ve not read MT nor TNE, so I don\'t=

if they had them). Without a reference such as this, you may forget=
 to use
all the applicable DMs.

So here\'s my reference sheet. Of the Special Pools, I have only included
=46atigue. (I didn\'t like the way the rest had been implemented.)=
 Add \'em if
you use \'em.

I\'ve also thrown together a handy Movement/Action Options list for=
 the
players to use, which is included at the bottom. Always good to know=
 what
your options are.

If I\'ve left out anything, let me know.

Which is why, in my old CT campaign, I secretly decided that the Droyne
hypothesis was just as wrong phlogiston theory. The players were terribly
confused - kept coming across evidence that contradicted the Droyne-did-it
idea. Heh heh heh...

According to my rememberances, the "Central Darrian Fleet" consists of 5
squadrons of refurbished
TL 16 Capitol ships and the Star Trigger, a device to detonate suns into
huge novas.  Each world provides it\'s own
system defense, and by 1105, the Darrian base Tech had regained TL 13
(probably TL10 at Mileau 0), with the "flagship" of each
fleet equipped with 1 TL 16 component.

Let me just say that a vaccum protection suit would not be of much use 
if it was to vent its atmosphere witha single small puncture in the 
gloev. The life support system of a vaccum suit would be capable of 
adjusting its "refresh" rate to allow for any loss of pressure (within 
limits). If the life suuport was maintained external to the suit ie. by 
the ships life support via an umbilical, such a condition could be 
maintained for a long period of time.

 I believe also it was said that the surface of the astronauts hand was 
forced up against the puncture effectively sealing the hole, just as 
ones hand gets stuck to a vaccum cleaner knozzle when passed by it. 
Obviously this will not always happen.

OK, good comeback. Let\'s make it champaign. 8^)

Assume a surface area of the hole of about 1 square inch giving us a
good 75 lbs of thrust. Now assume that the volume of the gas in the
bottle is about 4 cubic inches. (I think that these are over-estimates,
but I want my argument to be leak-tight.) Since the gas in the bottle is
carbon dioxide, I should use a "u" of about 400m/s instead of 500. (A
reminder: my half life formula was Halflife = (0.7) * (Volume/Area) /
"u.") This gives us a halflife of 175 /microseconds/. 

This thrust (75 lbs) integrated over the lifetime of the pressure in the
bottle yields a total impulse of 0.083 kg m/s. So getting hit by this
bugger\'s cork would be the impulse equivalent of getting hit by a 5 gram
bullet flying 17 meters per second (56 ft/s). This might make you say
ouch (especially if it hit you in the eye), but it would NOT "knock you
over."

Conversely, holding onto the bottle while opening it would affect you no
more than holding onto the hypothetical gun that fired that hypothetical
slow bullet. Such a gun would have negligible recoil!

Except that the ideal gas law calculates the pressure based only on
those components of the molecular velocity that are at right angles to
the hull. So this problem has already been dealt with just by using the
ideal gas law.

8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  8^(  

Oops, I just realized, that in the ideal gas law, the molecules are
elastic; they rebound with as much momentum as they impact. This means
that my formula for thrust is off by a factor of 2. (Obviously, the gas
molecules cannot rebound off of a hole.)^8

The correct formula is :

	Thrust = (Pressure) * (Area) / 2

My mistake. Sorry. 8^(

(BTW, halve the values for the champaign\'s thrust, and the hypothetical
bullet\'s velocity, in the argument above.)

I think we are getting onto something interesting here. I am a Role-play 
gamer raised in a tradition of no female players. This was not a rule, 
it was just that no female would be seen dead playing RPGs with us. 
Role-playing was, and still is, largely considered anti-social in New 
Zealand. Female playesr are still quite rare.
My question is; How often would players in your games play female 
characters?

As I recall, the Star Trigger only sets off a massive flare, whose emp
pulse hammered Darrian civilization.

I\'d assume that current Darrian shipbuilding regulations call for *high*
radiation resistance.

Male players almost never played female characters in my games.  I can 
think of only three female PCs that were played by males.  

On the other hand, as referee, I\'ve had occasion to play numerous female 
NPCs.  My campaigns tend to emphasize relationships between characters, 
and male-female relationships provide a multitude of situations to 
explore. 

\'Course, at first my female characters were stereotypical (as were all of 
my characters, of course - the big, strong, dumb guy; the wizened old 
mage; etc.), but I like to flatter myself that I\'ve gotten better at it 
over the years.

That is weird; I just bought the five books (the latest being Voices of Hope)

 Yes, I\'ll agree with you on the Stainless Steel Rat - not my

 Thinking about the Stainless Steel Rat, it occurs to me that
 "The Stainless Steel Rat for President" is a wonderful
 adventure for Traveller...

 Yes, I like this as well.  Incidentally, there\'s a prequel to

 Yah.  Nanotech is definitely a deus/diablus ex machina in too
 much SF.  Just like the Transporter and the Holodeck in Star
 Trek.  If I were the manufacturer, I\'d recall the damn things.

 If I know that the player has some acting/storytelling/etc.
 ability, I\'ll take that as a reminder of any appropriate DMs
 and ask him to roleplay the situation.  I occasionally do this
 with players that don\'t exhibit such ability; in doing so, I
 take into account not the _player\'s_ approach, but what the
 character would do with the indicated skill level, and after
 the player explains, I will sometimes recast the explanation in
 more facile terms.

 Syd is taking the wrong approach.  What he should do is discuss
 with the Inspector the possibility of contracting with the
 Inspector privately to learn how best to deal with the
 paperwork in question.  It\'s got a bit more of a figleaf of
 legality (depending on any conflict-of-interest regulations
 that may apply to the Inspector), and if the Inspector is
 sharp, he\'ll be able to milk Syd for a few more credits.

 That\'s about how I like to do it, as well - although I use the
 story to modify the Inspector\'s reaction, rather than Syd\'s
 attempt, which is really solely dependent on the skill.  Bad or
 inappropriate roleplaying will result in a "thug" Inspector -
 "All right, gimme it, I\'ll take care of it for you" with maybe
 a double cross for particularly bad or inappropriate role
 playing, while a smooth, suave presentation could get Syd a
 slightly lower price, and "Of course, sir, I\'m sorry you\'re
 having problems; please, just have a seat right here, and I\'ll
 see what I can do to expedite this..."

 Yep, and that\'s also what I strive for.  I make allowances in
 the above for the shy player who stutters when talking to his
 reflection in the mirror, and I _never_ force someone to do
 what they really don\'t want to.  Most of my players have had
 fun trying, even when their public speaking is worse than my
 public or private singing (and that\'s saying something).

   The material that DGP produced went to GDW.  The individuals responsible
for producing T4 were not with GDW when the DGP stuff (or at least the bulk
of it) was produced.  As for the "huge pile-o-stuff", it is my understanding
that Frank Chadwick sold most of the existing stock off before GDW went
under, and that Marc Miller actually inherited very little of it.  I doubt
that any DGP publications were in the materials Frank handed off to Marc in
any case.  Chances are if any are still around, they are still in Frank\'s
possession.

   I will once again remind everyone that the reason that T4 resembles
classic Traveller so much is because the people producing T4 had little or
nothing to do with the production of MegaTraveller or TNE (some of them had
never even played Traveller prior to joining IG).  These are not people who
lived through the MT/TNE Traveller eras, and so their frame of reference for
Traveller is much different than someone who has been through the past ten
years of additions and rules changes.  The noteable exception to this in T4
is the ship design rules, and their TNE influence is as undeniable as the
fact that they were produced by FF&S enthusiasts.

   I don\'t think it\'s a copyright issue.  It\'s more a matter of the writers
at IG not being aware of it (for the reasons I stated above), or simply not
caring what had been previously published, or both.

   With regard to the copyright--in the worst case scenario, the rights are
in limbo since the current owner of the DGP name probably doesn\'t have copy
permission from Marc Miller, and IG doesn\'t have permission to use the
uniquely DGP material that was included.  Certainly during the
Nilsen-Chadwick-Wiseman Regime (bet you didn\'t think that your name would be
used in relation to the word \'regime\', eh Loren?  :-)  ), Dave Nilsen was
under the impression that GDW owned the rights, and he told me so in a phone
conversation I had with him.  Of course he was also under the impression that
DGP no longer existed, which as it turns out *was* true at the time, but
someone has since purchased the rights.

   In any event, the owner of the DGP copyright would have to press any
claims of copyright infringement, and given that they would be on some pretty
shaky legal ground, I doubt they would pursue it.

   It was not.  "Atlas of the Imperium" predates the founding of DGP, or at
least DGP\'s assocation with GDW.

   While I can\'t speak officially for IG, so far neither IG or Marc Miller
has objected to the posting of materials related to the new setting (or any
previous official setting) to this mailing list, and in fact Marc Miller has
encouraged discussions in this forum related to the Cleon\'s proclaimation of
the Third Imperium.  According to IG, Web pages, newsletters, and fanzines
must have a copyright statement, but they have no objection to their
existence.  As far as making the things that appear here and elsewhere part
of the official setting, my suggestion is that if you post something and you
get some positive feedback on it, send it to IG or Sword of the Knight
Publications or one of the other official Traveller publishers and get it in
print.  Nothing becomes "canon" without becoming widely distributed and
accepted, and there\'s no better way to see that happens than to get your work
into an official publication.

Regards,

Harold

That would work, too.  I was, however, thinking along the lines that Edu 
is used in a lot of task rolls.  This would, it appears to me, balance 
out the 2 skills per year (which, after all, is only 2 extra skills given 
that tech school only goes up to three years vs college\'s four years) 
rule for Tech schools.

Anyway, that\'s just me being picky.  In the end, it probably doesn\'t 
matter.  Your tech school rules are a good addition to the growing list 
of T4 optional rules.

But pine DOES support importing text files... I know, I use the 
program on a daily basis.

When you are in the message editor part of composing a message ^R 
imports a text file, it will even let you go out and search for it in 
your directories.  No pine does not support importing a file from the 
 computer acting as a terminal, but all you have to do is transfer 
the text file from your PC to the unix shell account, and pine can 
handle it from there.

Actually, the scale I was referring to places "acting like yourself via
your character sheet" at one end and "truly getting \'into character\' with
your character" at the other.  I was also referring to how different (or
similar) characters can be from their players and how much referees allow
player knowledge to become character knowledge.  These aspects of
roleplaying don\'t necessarily have any bearing on how dice are used :-)

Ideally; but since this isn\'t so, you can begin to see my reasoning =
behind
not necessarily allowing a player\'s roleplaying skill and REAL LIFE
knowledge to effect their skill rolls.

I guess the style of our group depends on who\'s playing and what the
general mood of the group is (not to mention if one of our payers brings =
a
few bottles of his homemade Mead... Yum!).

If a particular friend of the ref is in town for the weekend (he only =
shows
up maybe once or twice a year) and we decide to do some gaming, =
excitement
is generally the goal and die rolls are either not required or are =
reduced
to a bare minimum, just so everyone has a good time.  Since these =
campaigns
are usually only for a night or two, little effort is made in creating
characters, and they end up being more-or-less extensions of our own
personality.

Some games (like Amber) pride themselves on requiring *no* dice, relying =
on
the referee to do *ALL* the storytelling & decision making.  This, IMHO,
really only works well in a group that is even more interested in =
creating
a non-biased storyline than the referee.  This style of play is =
definitely
not for beginners and in no way guarantees that the game system will
produce good roleplaying (ie: by not relying on dice).  My problem with
this method is that all referees are human and humans can have all sorts =
of
non-gaming factors influence their decisions during a session.  Did the =
ref
have a bad day at work?  Did his roommate tape over his favourite episode
of Babylon 5?  Is such-and-such a player wearing a *bright* yellow
tracksuit (you happen to hate yellow, BTW :-) ?  While I do trust my
referee to provide me with an evening of non-biased entertainment, I =
don\'t
really like the idea of a human mind being the *only* thing that =
determines
whether a random event does occur, and to whom.  Dice are necessary for
this purpose.

Normally, our group of players create characters that (more-or-less) =
share
the same views on morality from campaign to campaign (eg: kind-hearted
players tend to stick to one side of the morality scale).  We have played
in short-run campaigns where we all started out as REAL NASTY types,
however, and a few players did have difficulty playing out these =
character
types (I was one of them).  The campaign progressed to the point that the
"mean \'n nasty" PCs were not nearly as bad as some of the other =
characters
in the campaign, which made the switch that much easier.  By the end of =
the
campaign, everyone was acting like Darth Vader in the final ten minutes =
of
"Return of the Jedi", becoming the most unlikely heroes of the campaign.

Acting in character definitely has its rewards.  However, the level of
"acting in character" must be set by the group as a whole.  Characters =
(and
the referee) also must know when things have gone too far.  We had one
player that insisted on acting out his character\'s voice, which was
extremely low and gravelly (lozenge?).  He also liked to run around the
room acting out what his character was doing (look out for that lamp!),
even though his verbal descriptions of his character\'s actions were =
crystal
clear.  Members of our gaming group don\'t usually physically act out our
character\'s actions due to the cramped conditions of the place where we
normally game, but we did began to talk in character after that.  Of
course, the player who started all of this had lost his voice and wasn\'t
nearly as much fun after that :-)

Our group prides itself on coming up with fresh, creative characters
(depending on the genre) for our campaigns.  Some games make this easier
than others, of course.

I tend to agree with the part on proset..prostel..what he said. I heard
some complaints on the amount of errata a couple days ago at my local
gaming store and offered to supply more current errata sheets from the
Web as they\'re developed (always sniffing for a discount). The
salespeople didn\'t seem to have a problem with it, copies are cheap (I
supply the initial copy; they do the rest), and hopefully it\'ll help
boost sales somewhat. BTW, if anyone knows any legal reason for me to
_not_ do this, *please* post it ASAP (is the errata copyrighted?).

 If it will help We can look at My T4 Group. Males four, Females one,
ages 23 to 46. Of the five two of the Males play Females from time to
time. the rest never play anything but their own gender. I think this
ratio is right for most groups I have played with.

Notes
Type 6 pays the same rate as its parent; referees may decide the planet

Type 7 (balkanized) pay different rates based on the different political

Hear, hear! I enjoy pulling out the old stuff (especially DGP) exactly
because of the amount of background info available. Even if Marc or IG
does come out with objections, as has been posted previously, our
campaigns belong to us. I\'ve been going through some things and found
the following in an article on cloning from DGP\'s Traveller Digest #12:

"Any sentient lifeform within the Imperial borders, regardless of its
origin, is a protected being, and thus a citizen of the Third Imperium"
- - Cleon Zhunastu, 17

"Is it right to allow someone to have a child for the express purpose of
supplying spare body parts? The Third Imperium calls this a highly
criminal act. Using a full-body clone for spare parts is no different.
It is a crime of the highest degree."
- - Cleon Zhunastu, 17

The future of the past from the man himself.

I haven\'t seen T4 yet, but have been following the discussion avidly.  
I\'ve seen variants on the statement above several times, and couldn\'t 
bring myself to believe them...is it true?  Is the M0 background so 
seriously broken that we\'re expected to believe that a major military and 
merchant power, extending out across most of a sector, has *not explored* 
worlds in its own home *subsector* yet?  This would be like Spain 
discovering the New World in 1492, but not running across Portugal until 
1600!

I had difficulty swallowing the premise that Egyrn subsector was "unknown"
in the old Leviathan adventure, what with relatively busy, prosperous
District 268 and Mora subsectors of the Marches right next door, a month
or two away via J-2 or -3 if you took the scenic route.  This whole
Core-subsector thing completely blows my credibility circuit breakers.  If
it\'s true, I may not buy the game.  I feel insulted.

I disagree strongly.  No sane military is going to put all their eggs in 
one basket like that.  I\'ve always pictured a Traveller "naval base" 
system as having distributed *components* of the base scattered through 
the system -- docks and repair facilities in orbit around mainworld and 
gas giants, fuel refineries at the latter, HQ and logistics units on 
asteroids and small airless worlds for ease of access, bureaucratic and 
support functions on habitable worlds for comfort and simplicity, and so 
forth.  Each of these will be defended by SDBs, fixed guns, and so forth 
as appropriate; you\'ll also normally have a task force or two in-system 
to provide overall system defense at need.

The danger of this happening is precisely why you don\'t build One Big 
Station.  For reference, see what that Skywalker twerp and his scuzzy 
rebel pals did to those lovely Great Big Deadly Spheres the Empire worked 
so hard to perfect...

The Sword Worlds operate on a shoestring budget, relatively speaking.  
I\'d be very surprised to find them with naval installations in that size 
range.  Again, more likely their (few) capital ships are each larger than 
any of their fixed naval base components.  I picture a SW capital ship 
nosing its way near a cluster of space stations, small "drydocks", and so 
forth in orbit around, say, Gram, then just co-orbiting with the whole 
messy orbital flotilla while repairs, crew rotations, and so forth occur 
via small craft and the like.

Space minefields are nearly impossible to make work effectively.  Space 
is just too damn *big* to cover any reasonable percentage of approach 
paths adequately.  They definitely *would* have a good extended sensor 
net deployed throughout each of their major systems.

I would expect, at the Sword Worlds\' TL (circa 1100, I\'m presuming) that 
the defenses would consist largely of point defenses and SDBs, with a few 
larger PAWs and the like near the more important targets.  In the event 
of a serious battle, though, the fleets in-system would be expected to 
provide the bulk of the resistance; fixed defenses would be largely for 
harrassment and delaying value.

> How large a fleet do the Sword Worlds possess? How large for the

See "Fifth Frontier War" and other sources for SW; don\'t know about 
Darrians, but I\'d expect it to be roughly on a par with the SW.  
"Typical" on-station force size would very much depend on circumstances 
(peace, tension, high tension, or open warfare).  For a major naval base 
in an important system, I might expect a BatRon, two or three CruRons, 
and a bunch of smaller ships.

I made errata sheets for my local stores as well, but before I 
distributed them I called Ken Whitman and asked whether it was OK to do 
so.  He said it was, so long as the standard copyright and trademark 
notices were included, and the sheet was provided free of charge, and 
never sold.

So, that\'s all you need to do to be all legal-like, as far as IG is 
concerned.

Back in high school, it was not uncommon group for people to play PCs the
opposite sex. But they didn\'t often put much effort into the role.

One of my first long-term AD&D characters received a magical sex-change as
a result of a "cursed" altar in some abandoned temple. My NPC consort was
upset, not being bisexual, but then chose to touch the same altar and thus
be transformed into a man. My PC and the NPC changed our names to better
suit our new genders, and went on with our lives almost as if nothing had
happened.

The trouble started when she returned to the stronghold she was
constructing: her guards no longer recognized her at the gate. Took some
convincing to get in her own front door. Her followers and hirelings were a
bit weirded out; but a transsexual feif-holder was not so odd as some of
the other things walking the town\'s streets, thus no big deal...

I\'ve always found it interesting to play a wide variety of character types,
genders, races, psychologies; and I encourage the players in my games to
stretch themselves. In my T4 game, I plan to give the players a set of
questions to consider during chargen. Things like: What\'s your gender?
Sexual preference? Racial background? Political stance? Religion? Family
background? etc.

It\'s an incredibly diverse universe out there. Or *should* be.

>What does TML think?

A hit-location roll, yup. That\'s what I used when running CT, and I plan to
use one in my T4 game.

For each successful hit, two dice are rolled, for tens and ones (i.e. a
two-digit number between 11-66). Consulting a hit location table, I note
where the hit occurred (sometimes it\'s understood that this is the most
serious of a group of hits). *If* that part of the body is armored, the
damage is reduced accordingly.

The table also lists specific types of injury, depending on location and
seriousness of the hit: a Superficial Wound (no stats to 0) to an arm or
hand can cause you to drop things you\'re carrying; to the head, stuns you
for a round, etc. A Minor Wound usually means internal bone fractures,
which can prevent players from running away, firing weapons, etc.;
sometimes it\'s a lung puncture or similar, something that might cause some
further damage. A Serious Wound can paralyze a PC with a spinal fracture,
or puncture major arteries. In the case of arteries or internal organs
being hit, the PC continues to receive damage due to bleeding, usually 1D
per round (2D in the case of a heart puncture. If they don\'t get medical
attention soon enough... well, that\'s war, soldier. (I usually rule that
any two sixes rolled during damage indicates a Critical Hit - the injury is
considered the same as a Major Wound, even if no stats are reduced to 0,
except that the PC is not rendered unconscious. Yowch.)

It can actually get rather gruesome, and at times I\'ll ignore the results
or won\'t go into much detail, just say "the guy you hit goes down and stays
there." I don\'t like the violence to get *too* graphic, but striving for
realism tends to lead in that direction. Also, it adds another roll to
every successful attack, so it slows things down. There are times when I
just ignore it and simplify things on the fly, such as when there are large
numbers of combatants.

This system is not really that much more lethal than the standard system,
so long as PCs get medical attention quickly. I suppose I could do
something to make it even more realistically deadly, but I don\'t want the
PCs to be *too* easy to kill. That would ruin the fun.

However, what the more detailed hit location system does is it makes the
damage taken more visceral and convincing; you don\'t just take "8 points to
your Endurance." You take "8 points to your Endurance, and a wound to your
<rattle clatter> knee, breaking your <clatter> left patella. And you fall
halfway down that flight of stairs, taking an extra point of damage.
Somebody better get a blanket on you before you go into shock."

So the lethality has only increased slightly. But the player\'s going to
remember that hit; he\'s really going to be more careful next time. And
maybe he\'ll have to get one of those \'dehumanizing\' prosthetics, which he
can show off in the local Cyberjockey bar... :)

Does anybody else use a similar system?

> If you supply enough power can you eliminate the need for HPGs in each
> weapon design?

        No. Required power would rise prohibitively high. However,
        there is other ways to eliminate HPGs.

        In most energy-based weapons, the energy pulse is discharged
        in very short time period (1e-6 - 1e-9 seconds). In practice
        this means that the output power is extremely high, and it
        would be almost impossible to build any practical energy weapon
        with corresponding power input.

        Example: 150 MJ laser discharges in 1e-6 seconds. The output
        power is (1.5e+8/1e-6 =3D) 1.5e+14 Watts. As the efficiency of
        grav-focus laser is 20%, this laser would need 7.5e+14 Watts
        power input to fire. This would be one hell of a continuous
        beam laser, but the wasted energy (6e+14 W) would melt the
        firing ship.

        However, it should be possible to build lasers without HPGs.
        While both 3G3 and FFS use some kind of fast storage system
        for laser pulse (capacitor, superconductor, HPG), I think that
        it could be possible to design quality-switched laser weapons
        where the pulse energy is stored in the laser tube, eliminating
        the need of additional storage system. The basic components of
        this kind of laser would be:

        Laser tube:     Cylinder filled with suitable material that
                        can produce laser when charged. A focusing
                        system is fixed at one end.
        Charger:        Flash tube of functionally equivalent system
                        which charges the atoms in the laser tube.
        Cooling system: System which removes the waste heat generated
                        by laser. Ideally this system should remove
                        all waste heat before next pulse is discharged.
        Battery:        External or internal battery pack.

        This laser would have to be quality-switched (Q-switch), which
        means that during charging laser tube would have high Q-value,
        and when trigger is pressed the Q-value would drop very low.
        (If I remembered in correct way around, high-quality laser can
        hold large amounts of energy in the laser tube, but discharges
        it slowly. Low quality laser can hold little energy in the
        laser tube, but can discharge it all in very short time.)

        Traveller jumpdrive is oversimplified black-box system, and
        there is only vague descriptions of the jump space phenomenon.

        Using FFS, one could assume that jumpspace and subspace are
        the same thing, and Traveller ships need a also gate drive to
        enter and exit the subspace. A normal "jump" would thus mean
        using the ship\'s build-in gate drive to forma a gate around
        the ship (jump flash), manoeuvering though subspace using
        subspace drives, and using the gate drive to enter the normal
        space (jump flash). As Traveller ships do not have subspace
        sensors, the whole operation would have to be pre-plotted and
        carefully timed.

        If this model would be used, the normal Traveller jump drives
        would contain:

        Gate Drive:     Opens hole between n-space and subspace.
        HPG bank:       Stores the energy pulse needed by gate drive.
        Subspace drive: Moves ship through subspace.
        Fusion reactor: Powers the gate drive and subspace drive.
        Cooling system: Vents hydrogen coolant into subspace to
                        prevent the ship from melting. (That is,
                        assuming that this is the only way to cool
                        down the ship.)

        Basically it should be possible to use the ship=B4s normal power
        plant to power the gate and subspace drives. However, using
        this kind of "jump dives" would invalidate the 7-day jump time,
        and blast smoking holes into Traveller background.


        In my TNE campaign one of the major plots was the discovery of
        subspace sensors, ("The technology needed for this kind of
        sensor systems has existed for 3000 years, but the knowledge
        did not. This that we can discard the pre-plotted jumps and
        manouver freely...") and the characters have spend much time in
        the Wilds trying to recover lost data from old jumpdive
        experiments and accidents. (Some of these have been mentioned
        in old Traveller adventures and sourcebooks, such as "Project
        Farstar", Solomani expeditions to galactic arms, ships stuck
        in jumpsace in Abyss Rift, etc.)

Trav ships are *volume* limited, not weight limited. There is an

upload. You\'ll have to fiddle with end-of-line delay and intercharacter
delay.

If it uses the standard editors, *they* can import files. Use kermit or
rz on the host to receive the files. Be sure to tell whichever you use
that you are sending atext file so that the EOL chars get translated
properly. 

I used "VT100" access for around 10 years and managed quite well by
using these methods.

Why?

The MIME inclusion contained *nothing* but text. So why was it sent as
MIME, rather than importing the text file into the posting?

I\'m sorry, but since it *was* text, and as far as I could see, used
*no* special characters, the use of MIME was inappropriate.

At TL 17 a HPG can store 40 Mj of power per M^3, a antimatter PP can
generate 50 Mj per M^3 @ TL17.  If you take all power requirements on a
ship, install a PP large enough to deliver all of that power the need for a
HPG to \'store\' power for that one \'peak\' is not there.  Up to TL 17 it has
not been an issue since the best TL 16 PP can only generate 7 Mj per M^3.  
 If you take an electrical PP of today they don\'t have a huge array of
anything to take the \'peaks\' of load off the PP, they just regulate the
speed of the turbines depending on load. 

The only reason I\'m so interested in TL 17-18 is that I have a character I
rolled up years ago when MT first came out.  He is from a TL 18 world.  Ive
designed lots of stuff under MT but I\'ve been trying to bring him up to
FFS, which allows more freedom of design.

Thanks for any input.

I don\'t have T4 yet, but I started to think - what if the "unexplored"
regions were full of Dorsai-types, or someone who had a really good
defensive navy? A few times over the past couple of hundred years the
Syleans (now the Imperium) went sniffing around - and got thrashed.  I
think that would discourage exploration in that region.  Now, of course,
depending on your mindset, they could be ready to be toppled by an
industrious bunch of PC\'s - or the PC\'s could come back with a thrashing
as well...

Just random thoughts way too early in the morning....

Many thanks for the kind words re the arrival of Sarah.

Chuffed (for Stuart et al) is an adjective meaning \'pleased\'
according to my dictionary.  \'dead chuffed\' is, of course,
the utter extreme of that.  (I was trying to convey my
excitement at getting my T4 book and that despite my
enthusiasm for it, Sarah took me waaaaay beyond that!)

I wanted a quintessentially English word to also convey the
\'alienness\' of some of us (most of us?).  Looking at a 7lb
human being reminded me just how weird we really are!

I like wheels within wheels too, but am better at them
in words than action.  (Though that may be a matter of
opinion).

Now can you guys keep the noise down, little one\'s asleep.

Funny, my experience with that system (through Traveller:2300) was
quite the opposite (but that\'s neither here nor there).

Actually, I thought CT was good in that regard since you were very
likely to be knocked unconscious by a single bullet unless you were
strong and/or athletic. If no vital organs are hit, then one bullet
probably shouldn\'t kill you immediately (although you\'ll probably
begin bleeding to death if you don\'t get medical help immediately).

You\'re right that a good hit should result in damage to a vital organ
(even if not a called shot). Without this, it\'s too unrealistic.

I remember a study on the effects of gunshots being posted to this
list at one time. The interesting thing was that a large percent of
people are taken down (due to system shock?) from even relatively-
minor gunshot wounds, but those that are still up after the first
bullet can take many more (unless they get shot in the head or heart
or someone uses a shotgun at point-blank range on them--ick).

If anything, perhaps there should be an additional pool of "hit
points" to draw from, as long as the first hit still reduces one
attribute and part of each future hit reduces attributes also.
Of course, critical hits would be essential to this scheme.

> A black-powder pistol is given a rating of 2.

I think we treated all bullet-type weapons as damage 3. The older
weapons were less accurate, less penetrating, and had shorter range,
that\'s all.

No, the star trigger caused a nova in a system, which caused an EMP wave in

(Rob whips out his canon to parry.)

This was the first astrographic /contact/ between the 3rd Imperium and the 
Zhodani Consulate , but racial Solomani and racial Zhodani had /known/
about each other for quite some time before the founding of the 3rd
Imperium. The 1st Imperium had /some/ contact with the Zhdant-ites, and
Cleon\'s historians would have inherited at least some of this knowlege
(IMHO).

(Rob drops his old rusty canon and picks up a new shiny one...)

For an interesting twist very relevent to this discussion, take a look
at the Library Data in T4. Look up "Zhodani"...

   Not only that, but if I want to _read_, or even _save_, the included

   There are a lot of people here who are thinking the same things you
are, and some (like me) like the TNE system (which mirrors T2K) as a
better solution. 

   I think you have to decide what you want your Traveller campaign to
look like. Maybe the question of low-lethality doesn\'t even enter into
some campaigns, there are a lot of GMs that role-play their combat without
hardly a glance at the character sheet...

   That being said, if your campaign is an, err, violent one, you might
want to look at multipliers, or use the TNE combat system. (which is only
marginally more lethal than CT but still better)

   To use multipliers, you need a hit location chart. Head hits get
triple, torso hits get double damage. Alternatively you can use the NPC
"quick-kill" chart from TNE.

Questionable actually...  Somebody who has a Pistol-4 is going to 
devote a large amount of time to practice at every opportunity.  
That amount of time could very easily amount to a few hours, 
particularly if you consider maintenance of the weapon, time on the 
gun range, etc.  You don\'t turn firearms expertise off and on like a lightswitch.  
Just as a doctor would become technically incompetent without keeping 
up on medical literature, and actually doing his practice or 
research, a firearms expert who doesn\'t spend a lot of time on a gun 
range, or actually using/practicing his skill is going to develop 
rust...  Just because 1 skill is more physical and 1 is more mental 
doesn\'t mean that 1 person is going to work harder at maintaining 
his expertise...  Hell, doctors must be able to put a little bit of 
it on the back burner from time to time...  You see so many of them 
on the golf course once or twice a week...  :-) 

This brings up another point...  How can a guy maintain a skill level 
in skills that he has no opportunity to practice or use on a daily 
basis...

kraehe@bakunin.north.de (Michael Koehne) mentioned the Frankfurt Book Fair.

BITS will be running the Traveller demos, etc. for OrkCon on 1-3 Nov in
Schweinfurt, Germany (Ken, Larry, etc. will be there). Unfortunately we
won\'t have a presence at Essen (Ken, etc. will be there, but in a "having a
look and wandering round" capacity), although our T4 adventure "The Long Way
Home" should be on sale courtesy of Colin Wheeler of Second Games Galore, if
not with any other Traveller sellers.

THE LONG WAY HOME
- ----
(In case you didn\'t know - the first licensed Milieu 0 adventure for T4)

For UK members of the list, this is available mail-order from BITS at 11.99
(non-members) or 9.99 (BITS members). P&P is 1.00 for the UK only. If you
want the book signed, or anything particular written in the front, just say
so. Please e-mail me for further details.

Air-mail overseas (e.g. the US) is a silly price, so I would advise
transatlantic readers to wait for the future print run from Sword of the
Knight (apologies for the dealy in initiating this).

SINGED HARDBACKS
- ----

Steven Ward <Steven.Ward@brunel.ac.uk> mentioned receiving his singed
hardback copy three weeks ago...

That\'s because Ken kindly dragged over some boxes of signed hardbacks for
BITS (we did a bulk order) back at the start of September for Euro GEN CON.
The singe-ing may be due to all the hot air I expelled hassling Ken or
perhaps because of having to sellotape the copies on the outside of the
transatlantic plane (Ken was trying to exceed his baggage allowance by about
2 tons!!!!).

T4 ERRATA - THE COMPLETE SET
- ----

E.Watters@Queens-Belfast.AC.UK asked why T4\'s Core subsector didn\'t seem to
tie up with previously published materials.

I\'ve not actually got that far through the book on my errata check, but I am
amalgamating a very detailed listing of minor errors (down to grammar and
spelling) and points which need some clarification, including stuff not
covered currently on the IG web site. When this is all done, and I\'ve got
Marc and Ken to clarify the points I don\'t understand, then I\'ll post the stuff.

Craig Berry then went so far as to say:
>or two away via J-2 or -3 if you took the scenic route.  This whole
>Core-subsector thing completely blows my credibility circuit breakers.  If
>it\'s true, I may not buy the game.  I feel insulted.

WHOA! The Core subsector stuff is 2 pages out of 200. Let\'s face it, the
Exit Visa adventure is set in the Spinward Marches which isn\'t even known to
Milieu 0 and isn\'t detailed for the beginner who\'s just picked up the rule
book. I wouldn\'t call that a reason for not buying the book.

It has to be said that there are more errata than one would like, but in
general these are minor irritations and are inherent in bringing a rule book
such as this to market in such a short time.

I believe that the real reason why the Core subsector isn\'t \'according to
canon\' is because Marc Miller has his own view of \'canon\' and it doesn\'t
necessarily agree with everything that others (e.g. DGP) have published.
It\'s not a copyright issue - I believe IG can use DGP material provided it\'s
not quoted verbatim.

MODELLING AND CASTING
- ----

Merrick Burkhardt <merrick@Rt66.com> said he was thinking of adding an area
to his web page (Ants, that is) with step by step mold making instructions...

I\'ve also seen a web site by the Bare Metal Foil people at
http://www.gremlins.com/bmf/
which had some useful info on it - I\'ve not visited this in a while, so
perhaps Merrick would care to dig through this?

EDUCATION
- ----

Joe Walsh <ransom@connect.iconnect.net> commented:
>So, you would agree that +1 edu per year in a technical school is too 
>much?  I\'d say just add the skills, and leave Edu alone...or, perhaps add 
>+1 edu for 3 years.  What do you think?

I pointed out (at the proof-reading stage) to IG that getting +4 Edu for
attending College, added to the lack of clarity over whether any subsequent
schooling (Flight, Medical, whatever) added further Education, meant that
just by going to College a character could severely enhance all their
Edu-based skills. I advocated +1 Edu if they failed the perseverance roll,
+2 if they graduated, +3 if grad with hons.

SEX AND SEXISM
- ----

HDHale@aol.com mentioned coming up with a new career: Prostitute.

Well, I\'m not going to dig into this quagmire of cans of moral worms (you
know what I mean). Most fantasy & SF art is very sexist and hasn\'t changed
greatly over many years. If anyone wants to bring sex and sexuality into
their game, though the netbooks produced for AD&D over the years are
excellent in giving you a range of guidelines from how you can impress
someone with your appearance (whether that\'s a man or woman doing the
flirting), down to how well you perform on the night, or day, or in the
street, or car, or... anyway, if you want to go further, a friend has an
\'oddities\' table which you can use to determine if a character has any
\'hang-ups\' on particular things. This can range from adject phobias to
necrophilia.

HOWEVER, I would only advocate the use of such things in an ADULT game with
CONSENTING adults - even an adult group may contain gamers who - even if
they don\'t want to admit it openly - feel very uncomfortable handling such
subjects. Our AD&D group has had two pregnancies (in the game), our
Traveller group has more than one woman who has used her sexuality to good
effect in overcoming her enemies.

As Harold said, one can integrate adult themes (as in mature not porno).

I know Darryl\'s retracted this, but I just wanted to make some general
points to the list at large...

<sound of soapbox being pulled out and dusted off>

This is not the correct attitude. This is the attitude that makes web page
designers put up Virtual Reality graphics on their web page and then wonder
why not everyone can read them (you must have Netscape 3.0, text-only
browsers are b*ggered, plus VRML support isn\'t available on Suns yet, so
many people using Netscape at work can\'t see this stuff either). On a lower
level, designers put fancy buttons, image maps, etc. as the ONLY links
around their site, without putting a text equivalent. Again, text-only
browsers, or those economy-minded souls who turn off the automatic
down-loading of images, can get very irritated.

People should bear in mind that many people are not as fortunate as
themselves and that you should always try to support the _minimum_ possible
standard, with anything extra being an add-on, and not being critical to a page.

Many people\'s mailers still don\'t support automatic decompression or
decoding of documents, and some  - although nominally supporting it - don\'t
do it correctly or don\'t always interpret documents correctly.

The ethos on this mailing list (unless Rob corrects me) has always been that
any post of sufficient size to require encoding should not be posted to the
list but should be placed on an FTP or Web site, or individually e-mailed to
people who are interested.

DARRYL\'S TECHNICAL COLLAGE
- ----

Nice to see some additions such as these, plus the extra skills he\'s started
adding on his web page. However, college has two Es in it. Currently
characters have the option of Technical Collage, which means sticking lots
of bits of something together to make a picture. "Hey Ed, have you finished
cutting up that Jump Drive manual yet - I need some more pieces for this
collage of Cleon..." :-)

IG GOING DOWN THE TUBES...
- ----

...Is a load of twaddle. Ok, so advertising the game is not currently a
strong point, but in the UK, "arcane" did a huge feature on it, plus the
next Valkyrie is a Traveller-specific issue with reviews, features,
adventures, patrons, etc.

Here\'s a quick dump of what I sent to uk.games.roleplay when people were
bemoaning the lack of new blood in role-playing:

>        What I\'d really like to know is does anyone have any 
>survay or anecdotal information about where new gamers are 
>comming from _now_ and for that matter how did they get into 
>the hobby.

Well, at the Traveller stand at Euro GEN CON, we unashamedly grabbed 
young children from their parents\' arms and forced them to play 
Traveller. It seemed to work - some had looked quite dubiously at 
the games as they were dragged round by over-avid parents. After the 
games, they wanted to play more... that\'s the way to get them!

I\'m hoping that through BITS (British Isles Traveller Support) and the 
efforts of the RPGA (TSR, etc.) that we\'ll be able to get more 
demonstration games (of various RPGs) back into shops, to encourage more 
people into the RPG arena. Events such as EGC are all well and good, but 
(I would think) are events for the \'confirmed gamers\' rather than 
attracting new blood.

Another opportunity is radio, television, newspapers, etc. through news 
programs and the like. Basically, if anyone has contacts out there who 
want to record a piece on RPGs and how GOOD they are, rather than all 
this "Devil worship, Suicide" crud, then I for one would be more than 
willing to contribute some time to promoting RPGs (Traveller in particular :-)).

So, anyone out there got some useful contacts? Alternatively get out there
and start running some demo games yourselves. Any sensible shop with a
little space will be more than willing for you to do so since it will
attract in customers, whether or not they actually buy Traveller at the end...

Finally, I know IG has been a little delayed in getting things like JTAS and
Starships to the printers, but they\'ve had plenty of stuff to sort out
business-wise of late, not to mention moving their office. Ken is currently
working on STRENGTHENING their financial backing to ensure that Traveller
isn\'t run on a shoestring but continues to be able to invest in quality
products. This should be seen as a very POSITIVE move. More information on
this next week, from the man himself...

THIRD PARTY PRODUCTION OF TRAVELLER STUFF
- ----

I\'d like to reiterate what Harold said about IG\'s stance on this. From my
long discussions with Ken Whitman, I have found IG is very enthused about
anyone\'s attempts to produce stuff for Traveller. If you\'re going to send it
out, on the Web, e-mail or printed, then you need to ensure you have the
appropriate (c) notices, etc., but in my own experience IG are very helpful,
i.e.:

(1) When publishing the BITS/CORE Milieu 0 adventure "The Long Way Home",
there were some delays in checking with IG what the (c) notice on the back
had to include, but it turned out to be only a few extra words to cover the
fact that we were effectively licensed by IG to produce the thing.

(2) The stuff (games, ideas, software) that we demo\'d at EGC has been given
the go-ahead by Ken for development to trial products - ok, so he\'s saving
IG the trouble of doing this themselves, but then he can\'t base his
decisions on the fact that everyone at EGC was going crazy over our stuff -
that\'s still a very limited market/audience.

If anyone wants help trying to get their own ideas into print, whether
through BITS/CORE (CORE is the product development group, BITS are the
actual publishers), or by doing it themselves, then please feel free to
e-mail me. I\'m starting to get a feel for the business and financial
problems in such ventures, and hopefully over the next year we (the CORE
group) will be building ourselves into a strong supportive role for IG -
i.e. providing a wide range of Traveller material, but as a supplement to
IG\'s work and NOT as a competitor.

Sorry this was so long, but I\'ve been out of the office a few days. Due to
an e-mail problem I\'ve also missed an awful lot of digest up to a few days
ago, so if anyone was desperately trying to contact me about BITS, The Long
Way Home or anything else, please send me a private e-mail...

Of course the attacker\'s first priority is scrubbing the sensors off
the surface. After they do that, it\'s not that hard to make any
internal sensors (neutrino sensors? Mass detectors?) relatively
worthless. 

The one *big* vulnerability such an installation has is that being
purely military, nobody is going to get upset at you using *nasty*
weapons to crack it.

But for a given energy input, the exhaust velocity (and thus the
thrust) of the drive depends on the molecular weight of the exhaust.
The higher the molecular weight, the *lower* the thrust. 

Water has a molecular weight of 18, 16 of that is from the oxygen. LH2
has a molecular weight of *two*. At Heplar temps, you are dealing with
isolating H and O *atoms*. 

So we put in 1 H2O molecule and 18 "units" of energy (one unit being
that required to boost something with a molecular weight of 1 to a
speed of 1). Output is 2 H atoms at a speed of one, and 1 O atom at a
speed of 1/16th.

Now consider putting in 9 H2 molecules and the same 18 units of energy.
You get 18 H atoms at a speed of 1. 

Guess which gives you a bigger boost? Thrust is determined by exhaust
velocity and fuel flow. Period. So for the same fuel flow, LH2 gives a
lot more thrust. About 9 times as much. :-)

Classic faster-than-light problem...through I\'m surprised that J6+few hundred
km/s is enough. 

If we\'re interested in preserving causality - even more difficult than
preserving canon - we can take the usual way out and introduce a privileged
reference frame (jumps always take 1 week as measured in the CMBR reference
frame regardless of velocity of the jumping ship, for example.)

 Now it is confirmed.
When i upload a simple excel file it becomes corrupt and crunches upon

I assume Excel files are not plain ASCII - make sure you\'re uploading

Also, you should .zip them first - saves time and space, and stops

Ok, Lets take things in order.

First, there are several options for starbase conception;

1). Starbases and naval bases are undefended shells, on the
theory that they are too delicate and would lose flexibility if they
had their own defenses.  If a well armed foe approaches an orbital
facility, it surrenders.  Defenses are Missiles on satellites specifically
designed as missile platforms, system defense "boats" (some of which could
be 10,000+ ton Battle Riders), and regular fleet units which happen to be
in system or are moved to the system when news of an attack reaches them
(obviously due to advance intelligence efforts).  Also, if aplicable, the
bases would be in range of any planetary Meson Weapons.

2). As above, but there are "Orbital Forts", Maybe 200,000 tons, fitted
with hundreds of fighters, laser turrets, meson guns (bay weapons),
heavily armored and armed, whose only purpose is defense.

3). Everything as 1). but the bases themselves are heavily armed and
armored.

I would argue for 1).  Why build a massive ship which can only be used in
one system when the same resources can be used to build several
jump-capable ships, admittedly of lesser combat capability, but with
significantly greater flexibility.

Defenses in orbit would be automated missile launching platforms; these
can be made cheap and small (harder to detect, harder to hit), and
missiles can be used in system or out of system. Also massive numbers of
planet or orbital based fighters, since these too can be easily used for
offensive ops, same with Battle Riders/Battle Tenders.

Defenders would know whenever a large hostile force is within a few light
hours.  Massive Passive and active arrays on the various planets and moons
would pick up invaders easily, and orbital arrays would enhance this
picture.  The planet is under no cumpunction against using active sensors
(its not like the attackers wont know where it is!).

Minefields are very difficult to justify due to the enormity of space
(even within a system).  Instead consider that a planetary defender has
effectively unlimited numbers of missiles they can launch from on planet
in the path of the attackers, or the defender can pre-position missiles in
stand-by mode which, when the right coded signal is sent, activate and
home in on designated coordinates (although I like the platform idea
better than the missiles just sitting there in space).

An American military base will have anti-aircraft and anti-missile
defenses. It will not generally have anti-ship defenses, and mostly it
relys on mobile assets (especially aircraft) to take out a threat before
it is able to do damage rather than on any local defensive countermeasures
or weapons.  On the other hand, Iraqi bases have hardened aircraft bunkers
(armor), Anti-aircraft missiles and guns, troops and tanks stationed
locally, etc.  So the choice is up to you.

If you decide on a "big spacecraft" type naval base (which you seem to
have done) consider the likelyhood of a hollowed out asteroid.  Most
construction would be done "free" in space rather than in a \'space dock\'
(perhaps with a surrounding gantry to allow easy movement of heavy
equipment). Ships would (IMHO) dock onto the outside of a base, not take
the unnecessary risk of manuvering into some chamber inside the base.  

If personnel stay there in a permanent way, I would allow about 20 tons
per person of space to accomadate larger quarters plus all the amenities
we would expect for a prolonged stay (laundry, restraunts, bars,
libraries).

You will also need to make a life support determination.  Is life support
completely ship-like?  this means materials and chemicals (oxygen etc)
needs to be brought in regularly.  If, on the other hand, there is a
closed-system life support structure, more space needs to be set aside
(around 5 tons per person[?!?]) for hydroponic tanks full of 
carbon-dioxide processing plankton and other organisms, which also process
wastes and provide some food. 

This is not even counting the real work components; offices (many many!
think Pentagon!), Workshops, training centers, visitor quarters, sensor
processing, fighter bays, storage facilities, laboratories, hospitals, and
so on.

Well, back to the real world.

Steve, I should have clarified that I didn\'t think they were travelleresque but

and still have time-travel in your game.  (I have some experience in 
the matter, since our group has been playing a time-travel-based 
RPG for over five years.)

To keep consistency, you must rule out paradox -- changing the past 
from what you have already experienced it to be.  The way we do that 
is by "timelock."  Timelock is an alteration of probability that 
affects time travellers.  For instance, suppose you have a dreadful 
thing happen, then travel back a week.  An obvious thing to try is 
to warn your past self.  But, if you try to visit your earlier self, 
you can\'t catch a cab, or you are held up in traffic, or you are in 
a traffic accident.  If you try to call yourself, the line is busy, or 
your get a wrong number, or something of the sort.

Timelock means luck acts to prevent time travellers from creating 
inconsistencies.  Generally speaking, the more bull-headed one is 
about trying to change the past, the worse you can hurt yourself with 
timelock.  It hurts more to try walking through a wall at 100 mph than
at 1 mph.

In terms of the game, it gives GMs a new scope for creativity, and it 
gives the characters an interesting new problem -- is any given piece 
of awkwardness just ordinary "background" bad luck, or are they in 
danger of running into timelock?  Players can develop imaginative 
ways of detecting and circumventing it.  If you don\'t like it, you 
can avoid it by taking modest care that nothing you do would change 
the past if it succeeded.

Other temporal effects include fating, loops and tangles, limelight 
effect, and causal substitution.  See my book "Time Riders," published 
by Iron Crown.

I disagree here, Darryl, if you\'re talking about a trade school.  From
personal experience as a lecturer, most students concentrate on the specific
skills they think they need for a job - and resent \'wasting time\' on general
education courses.

Also, remember that in T4 +1edu is worth a lot more than +1 skill, because
the education can be used for many skill rolls.  

I would suggest that your technical school stick with skills - this
represents the deep-but-narrow approach that trade schools offer.

The other option is to have two types of tech school: (1) a trade school that
offers only skills, but has low entrance requirements, and (2) a polytechnic
that offers mainly skill but some education, which is harder to get into and
takes longer to graduate from.

It\'s the attitude that bothers me.  Traveller for me has always been about
"hard" SF in both technical and social terms; I\'ve enjoyed learning about
the politics, history, sociology, and so forth of the Imperium and its
neighbors as an end in itself, independent of the utility of all this in
game terms.  To be presented with patently absurd, utterly impossible
"facts" about the newborn Imperium in M0 offends me; it damages the
internal consistency of a large construct which I value.  Putting
unexplored worlds in Core Subsector strikes me as lazy, sloppy, flat-out
*wrong*...and I can\'t help reading it as saying "At IG, we don\'t care
about plausibility" between the lines.

I still feel that pushing an error-filled product out the door to meet an
arbitrary deadline was the wrong move, but then again, I work in the
software industry, so sayings about pots and kettles come to mind. :)

It\'s *not* the break with canon that upsets me; rather, it\'s the utter 
silliness of having unexplored worlds in Core subsector.  I wouldn\'t have 
raised a fuss about a new *consistent* background; a new *inconsistent* 
one angers me.

Not quite; temperature of your heat rocket being fixed, the kinetic energy
of the output gases is what stays constant, so your oxygen atom comes
out at a speed of 1/4 the original, which gives you *more* thrust.

Generally, having a higher-atomic-weight exhaust increases your thrust-
to-weight ratio but decreases ISP (or exhaust velocity), which increases
total mass of fuel consumed for a given delta-V. Balancing the two is a
difficult matter for nuclear rocket designers (there\'s a thread on 
sci.space.tech about it right now...) 

Traveller starship performance is nominally based on volume, not weight,
which appears to make dense fuels attractive. This is a simplification,
though; FFS (the root of all starship design) only lets you use volume
to calculate performance for densities below 15 tonnes/displacement ton;
above that you have to use the real mass. Ships with water in their HEPlaR
tanks would rapidly reach this limit (particularly since you\'d have to use
more mass of fuel per g-hour.) Heavily armoured military ships with most
of their mass in the hull might make this tradeoff...

Also, some people (me among them) reconcile the unrealistically high
power-to-thrust ratio of HEPlaR by assuming that some fraction of the 
hydrogen burned undergoes fusion. (Did this make it into T4\'s text?)
In this case water makes a poor fuel.

I had once been thinking about writing rules for HEPlaR drives with
enriched exhaust (higher T/W, higher FC) but since HEPlaR is obsolete
for military purposes it\'s probably not worth it.

Oh, and burning hydrogen gives you the added advantage of having your
reaction mass and jump fuel be interchangeable...

Bruce
P.S. I had also been thinking about rules for TL-15 (or maybe 16) 
fuel tanks that use grav compression to carry metallic hydrogen at very
high densities but considerable cost, power, and danger - might still be 
useful for ultrahigh performance ships to cram jump fuel in.

I like this idea.  I\'ve been trying to come up with something similar myself,
but with one key difference: I don\'t like the idea of \'collectable\', so I\'m
trying to some up with something that doesn\'t require buying new cards. 
Instead, the \'hardware\' and \'people\' cards would be created based on game
stats, while the \'tactics\' cards would allow different options for play.

This is very tentative, as I only have NetRunner, and no incentive to buy
more than the starter set.  (Got it as a teaching aid.)  I know there are
many games out there, but most of them seem to share the characteristic that
newer cards are more powerful than older cards, creating a \'card race\' for
players.  I\'d like to avoid that syndrome.

In my game (ad&d on a weekly basis) we have three women playing, with the 
oposite effect. I have two women playing male characters and normaly at 
least one male playing a female character. 
The best (funniest) example was a woman and her signifiant other playing 
oposites. How they each thought the other should think was sometime 
illuminating, sometimes combustable!

Maybe I missed something, but what I read said that the worlds hadn\'t
been contacted in centuries.  This is different from \'unexplored\'.  There
may be good reasons for that...  Maybe they\'re worthless or excessivly
dangerous.

I must say I\'m more bothered by the break from previous material since
I\'ve got a lot of old original Traveller stuff I\'d like to use (and I
probably will just use) and it\'d be nice if it was consistent with the
new stuff.

I also have more problems with the typos and misspellings I\'ve found.
There are more than I\'m used to seeing, though not enough to cause me
to not want the book.  I like Traveller and I look forward to future
releases.

And, finally... it seems like there are more important things to get
angry about.  I doubt that anyone at IG is trying to screw anyone.  I
also doubt that they just don\'t care.  I would suspect that, if anything,
it\'s an oversight.  But I\'ve never done game design (which is why I\'m
not going to make any assumptions about what\'s behind the material...)

Similar in some respects. I don\'t roll for damage points in my campaign,
instead I use the MT mishap table with modifications inspired by
Striker. This results in wounds of four severity levels: Superficial,
Minor, Major, and Instant Death. (Combat tends to be very lethal in my
campaign.)

If the result is a major wound, I roll on a table (similar to the
critical hit or damage location tables in the starship combat rules) to
see what body part got smashed. Barring some fancy medical work, such
wounds leave permanent damage.

For superficial wounds, minor wounds, and instant death, the effect of
the wounding doesn\'t depend so much on the location, so I don\'t usually
bother rolling. I just decide where the character got hit and tell the
player what the effects are.

You\'re right, the players DO remember those hits! Especially when they
view life thru a cybernetic eye afterwards! 8^)

How about this.  Award Dex instead of Edu for each term in Tech School.
While one may not advance your education much when learning \'General
Robot Repair,\' one does become a bit more adept at twiddling with really
small parts and contorting oneself to fit through those @$%($!@! access
panels.

Or alternatively, for each _two_ years, give the option between a point
of Dex or a point of Edu.  As tech school is _three_ years long, it
holds down the amount of damage this option could do to game balance.

Personally I\'d think Tech School is more akin to an Associate\'s degree.
I\'d say it only lasts for two years and that you\'d gain a Technical
skill level, get a skill for every year you attended and gain either a
point of Edu or Dex.

RTV has a shelf life of about 3 years.  You can get a pull out of an
older mold, but it\'ll most likely take the mold with it.

BTW, I would think that white metal work would be poured into
vulcanized spin molds.  I don\'t, but I know a lot of outfits use
real vulcanized molds (RTV is Room Temp. Vulcanized, a chemical
reaction cures it, not heat/pressure like regular vulcanized molds).

I\'ve seen MWWG and it\'s sequeals; they\'re _satire_, plainly labeled as such for the 
sensitive. What bugs me is the gratituous bikini babes that infest RPGs for no other 
reason but tillilation.

I feel a rant coming on . . .

Don\'t get me wrong; I _like_ women. I was once married to one. I\'m wired that way. It\'s 
just that I\'d like my RPGs to portray women as integral to the human future, not as 
objects. The human race needs all of it\'s members -- no matter how they\'re plumbed OR 
wired -- to struggle for the future. I\'d like to leave behind all the sexist crap, 
especially the odious load of bull that says that it is okay to objectify women, when 
this species of ours finally decides to get serious about reaching for the stars. The 
female of our species has a lot more to offer the entire race; it\'s _past_ time for 
humanity to realize that to deny women their place in the human future is the worst kind 
of racial stupidity.

Rant off.

Okay, Greg, when will "Macho Women with Guns! Guns! Guns! for T4" be done? Hopefully 
_after_ the CSC is done! As for the JTAS swimsuit issue: don\'t even think it! ;)

All too bloody well; pun not intended. There\'s another clanbook that is _much worse_ -- 
closeup of female genatalia ON THE BACK COVER (book was polybagged like a men\'s 
magazine).

Likewise. I started RPGing in the US Navy -- an environment where there were all too few 
women, period. After I got married, my spouse would play _occasionally_, but I wouldn\'t 
do "snooky-wookums" things for her characters (I GMed, see the _Star Wars_ issue of 
Shadis, _The Unofficial Gamer\'s Lexicon_, by Paul Lucas, for the meaning of the term), 
and she stopped playing.

Hmmm . . . I thought we Yanks had a monopoly on the social-acceptance problems. How 
widesread is this phenomenon in Canada, the UK and Australia?

I call this "gender bending." I have had two players -- male -- who prefer to play 
female characters, one of them has _never_ played a male character in any of my games. 
Every one of them is anime-inspired. The other guy doesn\'t play with me anymore, but he 
played a ruthless female Solo in my old C-punk game.

As for me: for some perverse reason, I find it easy to build interesting female NPCs. 
This started in the C-punk game; the campaign centerted around the PCs protecting an 
all-female retro-rock band. I built the five rockergrrls -- thanks to the RTG \'lifepath\' 
system -- with more adventure hooks than a tacklebox full of Runnin\' Rebel fishing lures 
and with enough twists and quirks to their personalities to propel a year\'s worth of 
weekly gaming. The lead singer was a NewAge crystal-crunching NeoPagan with no cyberware 
. . . the drummer was a no-retreat/no surrender martial-arts Amazon who resented playing 
second fiddle to the lead singer . . . the bassist was a ultra-leftist Japanese with a 
lot of \'warez who rode the ragged edge of cyberpsychosis . . . the lead guitarist was 
born in a bus and raised in a nomad convoy, heir to a case of itchy feet but a 
peacemaker\'s soul . . . the backup guitarist was a child of the combat zone in her first 
band who was born with little more than a little luck and a lot of talent.

In T4, this experience helped me with my new rogue/spacer NPC. I\'d _love_ to play her as 
a PC sometime!

I remember that one! Luke was the "Young Farm Kid," I thought the diplomat was Retif. In 
an old Space Gamer, someone wrote up Alois Hammer and Jochim Stuben (I think) from 
"Hammer\'s Slammers" for a character contest, too. Interesting stuff, that.

That _is_ a problem; I\'m forever teaching \'Trav 101\' to newcomers. I usually hand them 
an Imperial Encyclopedia and try to answer their questions as best as I can.

In my Year 0 game, there are other pocket empires thinking the same thing as the Syleans 
are thinking -- just like in the RC game I ran there was the Solee with their 
Starburst-class CL as well as their relic Kinunirs -- all of which could smash the RCN 
flatter than a beer can. There will be no Virus, no hyperspace fish (I read _Fisherman\'s 
Hope_, it was GREAT!) and no Q in my Milleu 0 game. 

I\'ve got one small pocket empire set up in the trailing main of Core Sector -- a single 
world (Ardis, a Tech 12 world with a charismatic dictatorship) has been hiring 
privateers to raid Sylean shipping as a prelude to a campaign of conquest. Look at where 
the trailing naval bases are in IG\'s Core subsector; they are there to protect the 
coreward segment of the main.

The last thing you want is to have the Imperium reflect a vague sameness. Strip malls on 
every world do not help. As my campaign moves away from Sylea and the settled worlds, 
the PCs will begin to see just how vast \'Charted Space\' really is;)

Congrads, Timothy. As the Dadster to a nearly perfect young lady, age 15 Terran years, 
all I can say is; enjoy it while she\'s young!

I say "nearly perfect" because she\'s a great kid -- good grades, great personality, comp

In Australia, TAFE (Technical and Further Education) is 
1. an alternative High School
2. trade school
3. hobby school
4. career focused courses , certificate and Ascotiate Diploms
5. the only  other choice for further education. (The other Choice in 
University)

Part of the Idea for the +1 edu was to allow characters to go to Trade 
schools to gain the minimal edu required for Collages. The option could 
be as follows :

1. Choose 1 skill OR +1 Edu
2. No EDU bonus (defeting one of the main reasons of doing it in the 
first place).
3. Choose 1 skill AND +1 Edu
4. +1 Edu for 3 year course only

Themain problem as I see it is that EDU has gone from a stat used in 
character generation (CT/MT) to a base number used by most knowledge skills.
If you go to Technical school AND Collage, you could get a massive +7 
EDU. While this is good if you are almost illeterate when you start 
generation, It could make D EDU characters omnipotent.


I will concider doing a second version of the Technical schools, as long 
as I get an anwser that pleases the majority AND is concistant with my 
bias <grin>

Polytechnic are only in the UK as far as I am aware, and given that T4 is 
about simplyfying Traveller, I dont think having 2 careers of focused 
Technical schools (trade,polytechnic) is the way to go IMHO.

 Given "present" technology, I\'ll agree with this.  But what
 happens when you have room-temperature superconductors, where
 energy loss and heat generation (really the same thing) are
 absolutely minimized?  This was a big deal in real life not too
 long ago when someone supposedly found or made a superconductor
 that seemed to function as such at inexpensively achievable
 temperatures (liquid nitrogen, IIRC, as compared to near 0K).
 Is RTSC a reasonable expectation for TL11/12?

I just wanted to highlight this; IMHO this is probably the single worst 
problem with T4 - there is far too little background and adventure info to
let people run a campaign with it out of the box. TNE, for all its flaws,
did better - there\'s more information on the auxilliary settings like the
Regency in TNE than on Milleu 0 in T4. (*and* you could still use the old maps
in TNE.)

The adventures they include don\'t help much - one is set in the
Marches in 1105 (*why* didn\'t they reset it in 0?) (and I\'ve always thought
"Exit Visa" was a pretty weak adventure; if new player\'s first Traveller
experience is that dull, they may not want to continue. With all of published
Traveller to draw on, why didn\'t they pick one of the better adventures?
Argon Gambit, Divine Intervention, Night of Conquest, Death Station...)

Just out of curiosity...hands up everyone who\'s running a Milleu 0 campaing.

The "weird" part I was referring to was not the "Travellerishness" of the 
books, but the fact that I just bought and read these books, and have read two 
posts in as many days talking about how keen the books were.  I hope you didn\'t

This whole thing kind of makes me beleive in synchronicity or something...

If they\'re either, that seriously constrains what players may reasonably
find when they get there.  I see no hint of such a constraint being given. 

It just doesn\'t make *sense* for worlds a few weeks\' travel away to be 
utterly uncontacted for centuries, given a society in which 
privately-controlled starships are demonstrably common.  Someone would go 
there just to satisfy wanderlust, or prospect for newly-valuable 
minerals, or to set up a commune, or *something*.  Not many, but enough, 
in a sporadic stream over the years, that it would be quite well known 
what was in these systems.

Heck, consider that unknown Baddies from the Rim could use these systems 
as stepping-stones to Capital!  That by itself argues strongly for 
routine patrols by Federation/Imperial Navy ships, and in all likelihood 
for permanent monitoring stations.

To me, T4\'s Core subsector looks like an alternate history in which the
young United States settled the Eastern Seaboard, then the Appalachian
states, perhaps sent Lewis and Clark out for a quick westward survey,
then...stopped, for two hundred years.  Nobody bothered to cross the
Mississippi for a couple of centuries.

How likely a scenario is that?

Oh, I totally agree.  Consistency with canon is important to me, but I\'m 
willing to shift if need be.  *Internal* consistency is far more 
important, though, and non-negotiable.

Never suggested that!  I merely note that T4 shows signs of (a) being 
unduly rushed to market, and (b) a lack of Traveller\'s traditional 
attention to detail and internal consistency.

Something I have been mentally "playing around with" on this card game thing is 
a Traveller space combat system along the lines of Modern Naval Battles or 
(Better Yet) the Hornet Leader game.  Basically, the aircraft is defined, as is 
the weapons loadout.  The random card elements have to do with the battlefield 
conditions, when the enemy is encountered, what posture you and the enemy are 
in, and "random" events.  Combat itself is fairly simple, and couched in 
real-world terms rather than random draws, but the combat is effected by the 
random draws which reflect ehe elements listed above, as well as human elements 
like panic and tactical competence, as well as plain ol\' luck.  I would not 
want someting like the Modern Naval Battles requirement to draw the ammo for 
your weapons; too often I\'ve had a Iowa Battleship and no 16" gun cards.  You\'d 
think the logistics folks would have noticed the empty ammo bunkers before they 
let the ship leave the harbor.

As I said, I haven\'t really done anything with this.  It would seem that this 
would be more sueful in civvie vs civvie naval battles; military ships would 
have the equipment and skills to avoid or compound the random effects listed.

I do agree with Rob about the "collectible" aspect of the CCGs; it\'s all 
marketing, and leads eventually to completely untenable games.  I never got 
onto the CCG bandwagon, and most of my friends who were so into CCGs when they 
first came out have given up in disgust as more and more variant decks and 
power packs have come out, leaving their own expensive card collections far 
behind in terms of power.

I have to disagree with the sentiment, if not the fact.  I _like_ there being
little milieu to wade through to get to the game.  Since I tend to run my own
home-grown campaigns, anyway, a game like Traveller 4th Edition is well suited
to my style of play.  Frankly, even if I was the sort to use a pre-packaged
setting, I would want something like a later sourcebook than have the rules
constantly interrupted by background specific to a single campaign setting.

And I guess I am disturbed by the "fast food\' mentality being advocated here by
Mr. Macintosh.  Whatever happened to the days of completely original campaigns;
something many readers of this list may recall?

Not quite. Per Alien Module 8 - The Darrians, the Trigger was actually
two unrelated projects - remote meson communications and a subsurface
sun monitoring probe. The two happened to have a synergistic effect in
which, as it states explicitly on page 39, "stellar flares are triggered

    'body' => 'I would like to address four issues regarding gender:

1.  My experience with female players has been discouraging.  Like most,
my early groups (primary/secondary school) were exclusively male and
rather testosterone-addled.  University and later groups were more often
mixed, though unfortunately the typical female player was someone\'s
girlfriend, and disappeared when the relationship ended. The big problem
was when the GM\'s girlfriend joined the game, as most GMs were unable to
treat their lovers impartially (guess who got all the nifty gizmos and
always got to make the big kill?).  I would dearly like to see more
independent female gamers, but sometimes I despair.

2.  Cross-gender RPing I have observed was pretty bad.  Women playing men
tended to play stereotypical men, scratching, belching, bull-headed, etc.
Men playing women were worse, tending to act like drag queens and wanting
to sleep with _every_ man that came along.  Because of this, I have a
blanket prohibition against playing a character of another gender in my
games, unless I feel the player is exceptional.

3.  I think that the treatment of women in the Traveller universe should
be quite varied.  In my (New Era) pocket empire, the different worlds
treat this differently.  One world, Avsten, is a very "advanced" in this
regard, and asserts absolute equality between the sexes.  Another, Savria,
has lived with a Droyne population for millenia, and has adopted a similar
caste system of alpha (breeding) males, beta (non-breeding) males, and
females, and rigidly assigns roles to each.  Novomir, the capital,
survived a hellish civil war after the Collapse and is military-dominated;
thus, women tend to be less empowered than in early 21st-century Terran
"Western" culture.  However, military roles that do not require physical
strength (interceptor pilot, intel, etc.) find women, and noble women
excercise great "behind-the-scenes" power.  There is much room for
variation among 10,000 worlds.

4.  A potentially-dangerous topic is character stats for female humans.
No system I have played realistically portrays the physiological
differences between men and women.  This is, I believe, due to a desire
not to depict women as inferior.  However, women\'s lack of the physical
strength of men (in general) is obvious and should ideally be modelled.
In Rolemaster I devised a house rule that women would be penalised in
strength and would get bonuses in constitution and empathy.  I haven\'t
settled on a system for Trav yet.  Any suggestions, flames, comments?

	WHOO WHOO YEAH (sounds of a large crowd cheering)!!!

	Well said, Rich!

	On the subject of having women game with us, I started when I was in 
college (no, not a late bloomer, it\'s just that D&D and Traveller 
didn\'t come out till then!) and our groups always seemed to end up 
about 50:50...in fact three marriages came out of that original bunch 
I started with (all still together, all still gaming...hmmmdo I sense 
a correlation?) so there never was too much stereotyping.

	My wife plays, and she doesn\'t need any \'snooky-wookums\', 
stuff...in fact she tend\'s to be more along the lines of Ripley 
(Aliens) crossed with Arnie (anything!). She plays MOM, who protects 
and defends the group, (even when we don\'t want to be;-) and 
basically carries big guns, lots of big guns.  Woe betide the people who cross any of 
us...her last Traveller character like that was a retired Colonel in the 
Marine commandos, who had lots of contacts.

"Imperial Services" one contacts to regain lost ID (p. 66) seem to

It seems plausible that the _laissez-faire_ Imperium evolved as it grew
from the tiny Sylean Federation.  However, IIRC, it was the Sylean
_Federation_ which suggests a fair amount of member-world autonomy even
then.  Has anyone heard from MM or IG about this?

Hello!

Simon John Harding asks:
>>How often would players in your games play female characters?<<

Actually, I am a female player (and sometimes GM) in a group where all the
other players are male.

We currently have two Classic Traveller campaigns going on:

In the first our PCs are on a military ship (comprised of square pegs who are
on average far too smart but individual for their own good and careers) and
caught in the midst of the beginning of the Fifth Frontier War.  All the
fellows are playing male PCs and I run one male and one female character.
 (Yes, we have two PCs each, but not for use in every session.)

In our second game (which I GM) is a merchanter campaign and two of the guys
have one each of male and female characters.

In our non-Traveller games (Yes, I admit that I play other systems -- hang
head in shame), the ratio for the guys playing characters male versus female
characters is about 5 to 1.  I myself tend to play a mix of about 50-50
overall, the ratio varying depending upon the game system.

Overall, the role-playing that goes on is done well and the fellows seem to
avoid being really obnoxious and stereotypical most of the time.  For their
female *and* male characters.  :)

I have played in games where everyone was female, and that group also tended
to have a mix of preferences for the sex of their characters.

Thanks for the air time....

There are 10 unexplored worlds in the core subsector. While Sylea and the
other heavily populated worlds are at the "north" (top) end of the map, the
unexplored worlds group towards the "south" (bottom). There are many populated
worlds, and a good feeling that more lie off the edges of the sector given.

I don\'t know. It certainly didn\'t stick in my craw that much. There may be
things about these worlds that we just don\'t know, like who lays claim to them
or astrographic survey information that reveals just why they haven\'t been
explored/colonized/exploited just yet. We just don\'t know.

And until we do, there\'s no point in getting upset about it.

I was dissapointed, as someone who has only played Traveller from a four-
book CT set in a universe of the GM\'s own design, in the lack of any substantial
data about the universe as it now stands in Traveller. I knew there was going 
to be a M0 book later, but I expected a little bit more in the core rules.

Well, I am, but as I get into it, I am more and more discouraged with the
editing of the book.  Granted, my minor in college was Tech Writing, and it
is something of a pet peeve of mine, but I agree with whoever said earlier
that coming out with a poorly done product just to meet a deadline is a bad
move, it is better to not even mention a deadline.

Anyway, I don\'t mind not a lot of mileau stuff in the main book, but the
erros are killing me.  The errors in the weapons tables and the written
weapons section are pretty bad.

I don\'t want to be perceived as a nay-sayer, but I really have doubts about
the ability of any company to survive with continual errors like the ones in
T4.  They may not seem major to many of you, but I am not a real experienced
ref/player, and it is difficult to understand much of the stuff without the
years of CT experience.  I don\'t advocate a more complex system like TNE,
but I do want a system that I can understand.

Heh, well.... to be honest, I was always too pressed for time to actually
work it up in detail. So I never really decided who or what was responsible
for the Diaspora. I figured that the Droyne were just clients of the real
Ancients, and had been dispersed across Known Space the same way we had. I
mean, you didn\'t really believe that obviously patriarchal children\'s story
about "Grandfather", did you? Pfffhahaha!

The main bit of evidence the PCs had to figure out was a hollow asteroid, a
religious pilgrimage site and tourist trap known as the "Rock of Duriam",
which had once been an Ancient starship. Some surfaces could be made to
display an alien glyph language, quite untranslatable. But some of the
glyphs looked suspiciously like pictures of humans, Droyne, Vargr, Aslan,
etc. However, the interior architecture differed somewhat from Ancient
sites in the Marches (my campaign took place in a self-generated sector I
called [unimaginatively] the Frontier Extents, coreward of Dark Nebula).
Most of the thing was clearly not designed for Droyne, though a few little
rooms *were* designed for them.

The PCs never figured it out. Too bad nobody ever found the "go" sequence
that would\'ve taken them on a little jaunt across the galaxy. And nobody
ever noticed that this rock was located in the "Gateway" subsector. Not
Fredrick Pohl fans, I guess. :)

It was probably even more confusing for the players because I hadn\'t
actually read Signal GK! Still haven\'t.

Me too.  I played Dark Sun game opposite another male player who was playing a 
female PC.  It was just so darn *wierd*.  I\'ve played dozens of female NPCs as 
a ref, but I just wasn\'t sure how role-play a barbarian-type fella travelling 
around with a female PC played by a male player.  Call me old-fashioned, but

Yep.

If a female player wants to dispute the strength mods for females in your 
campaign, and she\'s big/strong enough to whup yer ass, then let her have 
whatever she wants.   Just a bit of friendly advice.   ;-)>

Uh - no - Hydrogen doesn\'t burn in a vacuum any more than water!

(T2300 used MHD devices, where they electrolysed water in advance,
then mixed and ignited the gases to power aturbine. For rocket thrust,
they vented their hot gases.)

TNE and T4 use gobs and gobs of fusion generated electricity to heat,
ionise and accellerate a gas. The accelleration is almost certainly
elctromagnetic, applied after the ionisation, as by doing so you can
significantly boost the exhaust velocity over that from simply heating
gases. To get the most out of your fuel mass, you want the highest
exhaust velocity...

Cross-gender role-playing is common.  Not everyone does this, but most of
us do.  We haven\'t had any problems with gender stereotypes.  I don\'t know
if this is a regional thing, related to age, length of time gaming, or
what, but my experiences seem rather far from the norm here.  I do know
that when I went to Origins this year there were a whole lot more women
there than when I last went to GenCon (around 1988).  It was still only
around 15-20%, but Cons tend to have fewer women at them than most gaming
groups I know of.

Interesting call this.  The few people I speak to about it usually think
its a bit childish to be "playing games" at my age (28).  My mum
certainly does :-).  However, if I ever manage to convince them to come
over and sit down and watch a game, then they quickly see the fun in it 
Some say they\'d like to try, others are not so interested.  I guess
that\'s normal.

As a rule I try not to advertise the fact that I\'m an RPGer - I think
over here it has a bit of a \'geek\' image - and given that I also program
computers for a living I can\'t win :-).  So I stick to talking about my
other hobbies:  karate, rugby and surfing - somehow the response is
always better :-)

2 cases: 1 is thermal energy, where the energy per molecule is fixed
by the temp. and then the velocity by E= 0.5 M V^2. In this case the
velocity is reduced...

	Em (energy/molecule) is function fT of temp. and constant
	Em = fT = 0.5 m v^2
	v = sqrt( 2 fT / m ) = k sqrt(1/m)

	the impulse per molecule is	m v = k sqrt(m)
	total impulse I is N m v, where N = Mtot / m
	
	I = N m v = Mtot / m * k sqrt(m) = Mtot * k sqrt(1/m)

so for a fixed temp., the exhaust velocity slowdown knackers your
thrust, and the best current rocket drives use the best thrust ration
fuel of H2 + O

Case 2: electrical energy, where you accelarate a plasma through an
intense field. The gas now behaves differently as you vary the energy
per molecule as you accellerate it, and distribute the enrgy equally
between atoms (atoms, \'cos it\'s a fully ionised plasma)

	Etot = 0.5 Mtot v^2
we discharge the same mass/sec, (lower volume), so exhaust volume is 
the same, we just stretch it 9 times further
You can investigate changing parameters:

	v = sqrt (2 Etot / Mtot)
	I = Mtot v = sqrt ( 2 Etot Mtot)

thrust T = I/sec = sqrt (2 Power Mtot/sec) If you try overloading the
drive, or cutting back on power you see that thrust is proprtional to
sqrt(Power), and sqrt mass rate. If you flood the drive with extra
fuel: eg, the LHyd volume, but water you get 9 times mass rate, and 3
times thrust. Better to throttle back the mass flow and get 9 times
the impluse at normal thrust. (But still handy for overdrive!)
 
Since Trav uses Gobs and Gobs of fusion power to boost the exhaust, I
have assumed that the energy goes only partly to thermal energy to
produce the plasma and mainly to the subsequent accelleration of said
plasma

Does this make sense?
Too much maths?

This makes sense to me.  With only one Sector (or possibly subsector,
though to me this seems rather silly).  The Imperium is a whole lot
smaller.  Even if they only have Jump 3, getting from one end to the other
takes on 10-12 weeks, not several years.  A smaller Empire, especially a
vigorous and new one, would likely be a lot more direct interest in its
(many fewer) member worlds, simply because such interest was possible.

Precisely why BITS published "The Long Way Home" to give new referees (and
old) somewhere to adventure in Milieu 0. The adventure has been carefully
chosen to use \'canon\' background but is sufficiently flexible to be adapted
to most \'custom\' universes.

The problem with this idea is that it\'s fine for us established players
(typically college-educated in our 20s or 30s) to run up campaigns from
scratch. HOWEVER, the market that T4 must address are the teenagers of
today. This is a completely different generation whose imagination seems to
have been squashed by "fast food" computer games, etc., who _expect_ to be
given things on a plate (oven? what\'s that - oh, it\'s ok, I\'ve found the
microwave instructions), and who rarely bother to pick up a book (fiction or
otherwise) unless it\'s mostly pictures. Sorry to sound cynical, but
pregenerated background, adventures, etc. is a _must_ to attract new blood.

Ok, so I\'m not thrilled about the adventures they _did_ put in. The only
solution is to keep printing stuff ourselves (BITS/CORE already have the
next project underway - watch this space!)

>Subject: Re: RPG Babes..kinda LONG

Our AD&D/Traveller group has up to 3 women and 6 men in it. In both AD&D and
Traveller one or two of the men also play female characters (I hesitate to
call Barry\'s sex-mad female half-orc a "woman").

Of our members, 2 are the wives of male players (one is my own wife).
Needless to say I am totally impartial, and have not yet succumbed to the
"You\'re sleeping on the sofa tonight if you kill me" threat. The other
couple who play do not, by any means, work together...

Sorry, you mean there\'s some other type of man? :-)

This _is_ usually more of a problem. Thanasis\' description of the differing
roles the sexes play on worlds even within a subsector is exactly how I see
things too.

TRAVELLER CCG

The BITS/CORE group is already working on two card game concepts. Note the
avoidance of the word \'collectable\'. These games are intended to be such
that players can create their own cards and will be PLAYABLE, not
collectable. They will also be easily adaptable to equivalent computer
versions. IG have asked us to look into the matter further.

If anyone has any particularly strong views on this subject, please feel
free to e-mail me or Jo Grant (Jo_Grant/DUB/Lotus.LOTUSINT@crd.lotus.com).
Our concepts are by no means set in concrete, so we\'re open to suggestions.

My understanding is that initial printer faults delayed the first hardbacks.
Marc Miller then had to sign them all. And handling nearly 3000 mailings of

IG\'s schedules get back to normal.

For every successful hit, roll two dice, pre-selecting one die as "tens"
and the second as "ones". 

Roll damage, reducing dice if location is armored.

If no stats are reduced to zero by the hit, see "Superficial" for secondary
effects of wound.

If 1 stat reduced to 0, see "Minor" wound effect. Minor Wound effects such
as fractures (Frac) and impaired organs (Impd) are temporary and will heal
completely with proper medical attention.

If 2 stats reduced to 0, see "Major" wound effect. Even with proper medical
attention, Major Wounds effects can result in character being permanently
impaired, depending on Tech Level of medical facility.

When rolling damage, any roll of two sixes is a Critical Hit, which is
counted as a Major Wound, even if no stats reduced to 0.

Generally, effects are cumulative: if a Major Wound is received,
Superficial and Minor effects are also applied.

Generally, hit is received on side nearest the attacker. When needed, roll
1D for Right (1-3) or Left (3-6).

#p/r = character receives additional points of damage per
        subsequent round, until medical attention received. 
        At referee\'s discretion, extra damage may cease before
        character dies.
Drop Items = may not be automatic.
Stun = Stunned characters may not attack or move for 1 round,
        longer in the case of more serious wounds. May require
        rest to recover fully. 
Fall = May not be automatic (see below). May incur extra damage,
        usually 1pt, depending on situation.
Frac = Fracture. Referee may determine specific bone fractured.
Impd = Impaired function (see above).
Conc = Brain concussion. May be mild, causing headaches, or
        serious, causing migraines, dizzyness, seizures, etc.
        Severity increases if character loses consciousness.
Lung = Lung puncture, causes additional damage. Usually
        accompanied by fractured ribs.
Throat = Throat wound impairs breathing, causes additional damage.
Intl = Internal organ hit, causes additional damage.
Brain = At referee\'s discretion, effects may include partial
        or total paralysis, coma, speech impairment, blindness,
        personality change, seizures, etc, depending on amount of
        damage taken and swiftness of medical attention. 
Spine = Almost always causes paralysis. Extent and severity to
        be determined by referee.
Heart = Heart injury causes additional damage. Usually
        accompanied by fractured ribs.
Artery = Major artery hit, causes additional damage.
Amp = Potential amputation; if large amount of damage received in
        a single hit, amputation may occur, at referee\'s 
        discretion. If so, character receives further 1 to 3 pts 
        damage per subsequent round until medical attention 
        received. Energy weapon hits do not incur extra damage,
        as wound is automatically cauterized.

Referee should use judgement at all times to determine specific
location/effects. For instance, a Superficial Wound to "cranium/ear" is
clearly a head hit close to the ear, whereas a Minor or Major Wound could
mean skull fracture, impaired hearing, or concussion, perhaps all three,
depending on the amount of damage received.

If "Stopping Power" house rule is being used, head and leg hits incur a
negative DM when charcter rolls to remain standing. Any roll of two ones is
a Spectacular "Success" - in which case the character not only remains
standing, but is not immediately aware that he or she has been hit,
regardless of the amount of injury sustained!

For hits from automatic fire, shotguns, or explosives, it is generally
assumed that the rolled hit location is for the most serious of a group of
wounds (which are not rolled).
 
Separate Hit Location tables should be prepared for each non-humanoid
sophont species.

    'body' => 'Craig Berry <cberry@cinenet.net> and several others have offered excellent
posts on Naval Bases in systems. I\'ve enjoyed them and found them to be
tasty food for thought. here is my 0.02 credits worth.

One of the things that I\'ve noticed missing from the posts is the purpose
of the base. Is it a major refitting/recruiting base, a frontier outpost, a
trip-wire station on one of the fronts, or a transfer point/resupply
station, an R&D base, administrative center, or factory base. Also, it
could be a combination of any of the preceding types.

Without answering these questions, it is difficult to determine how
defended the base is. After all, a tripwire is there only to warn, so it
would consist of something to buy time and something really fast to provide
a warning to the next link in the chain. If it is a major center or supply
point (or a combination, which I suspect would be common) it would be more
heavily defended.

For the rest of my post, lets assume it is a major center combining two or
more of the above types and will be defended by a significant contribution
of forces. Note that one of the operational assumptions that I make is that
since men are "cheaper" than ships, large expensive ships will be minized.

Second assumption for the example: We are defending our solar system.

First layer:    Trip Wire outposts in the outer most orbit. They would
watch for ships jumping in. They would be automated and visited by
repair/patrol ships.

Second Layer:  Bases on Saturn and Jupiter. These would be built into the
moons and serve to support/supply transient ships, the first layer of SDBs
(substantially built, but small and lots of them), and ships designed to
deny the use of the gas giants to the incoming forces.

Third layer: Several small bases scattered through the asteroid belts, most
likely buried inside substantial asteroids. These would again support a
large number of fighters and SDBs.

Fourth Layer: Larger scale SDBs and as many heavy ships or ships of the
line that can be accumulated for point reinforcement to cut off the
incomping OPFOR. Also, if affordable, a scattering of satellites that
launched "stealth" missles designed to act as ship killers.

Final Layer: Minimal HEO/LEO defenses, mostly limited to defending orbital
repair installations and facilities. These facilities are limited to repair
and as transshipment points for supplies and personal. There may also be
manufacturing facilities located in the Asteroid belt, but those would be
included with layer three. On the planet however, would be a number of
"one" shot missle/meson gun emplacements, but these would be interspersed
among the population and manufacturing centers and the majority of the
personal would be dispersed among the population to act as insurgent
forces.

"Total" conquest of the this system would definately be expensive working
in through the layers and as long as the troops are trained and motivated a
very tough nut (I think). It would, however, require substantial
expenditures in build up and then maintenence and training costs. This
would of course lead to my first assumption, that the facility is a large
base in an important localtion (sub-sector capital or resource rich
system).

Hi Kevin

Watch that "disgruntled postal worker" stuff. I happen to work for the 
Imperial Xboat Service and I can tell you we are the most stable group of 
Imperial employees around. REALLY!!!  I WON\'T LIE TO YOU.  AH! THE 
SPIDERS...  <grin>

Really though, I would give Imperium Games a call.  I live in Nevada, and 
received my copy about a week ago.

     I flicked through it in my local hobby shop (the only decent one left, 
     now that Virgin have removed half the shelf space that used to be for 
     RPGs), and I couldn\'t believe some of the artwork used.  It made Macho 
     Women With Guns look tame, and I presume the D6 System isn\'t a parody 
     (in fact, it\'s exactly the kind of thing that MWWG *is* parodying).  
     Haven\'t WEG realised that it\'s the 20th century?
     
     I attended an interesting talk at Euro GenCon given by one of the 
     authors of Dragonlance 5th age about the future of roleplaying.  He 
     talked about how TSR were trying to get at the mostly untapped market 
     - women and older people.  Apparently, they had considered an RPG for 
     women, but thought it would be too patronising.  I think WEG must 
     still be squarely aiming for the male adolescent market.
     
     
     Most of the groups I\'ve played with in the last 5 years have had one 
     or two women out of 4-6 players.  They do tend to be wives/girlfriends 
     and most (with a couple of exceptions) probably wouldn\'t play unless 
     their other half did.
     
     I did used to share a lift to work (which was about 40 miles from 
     home) with a female gamer, but we only got to game together once.
     
     My wife plays in my group, but there are only some games she likes 
     (unlike myself, who is addicted to gaming).  I don\'t *think* I treat 
     her in a preferential way, other than because she is inexperienced 
     compared to the rest of the group (but I do that with any new or shy

Actually, the machine described in the article wasn\'t an electronic
computer, but a nano-mechanical one - it used diamond-based molecular rods
as logic elements. Sounds crazy, but in fact it would be blazingly fast,
and operate on a scale far smaller than the electronic pathways of printed
circuits. The heat results not from electrical resistance, but from
*friction*. Per calculation, there\'d be less waste heat, but since this
thing would operate at insanely fast parallel speeds, the heat produced
would be enormous.

Most certainly. But an RTSC computer, even a tiny nano-assembled electronic
one with single-electron pathways, would still be larger and slower than a
nano-mechanical computer of the same power. Or so Drexlerites claim. We\'ll
have to wait and see.

   You might want to think like a StarFleet Battles player and use a Code
Red based damage allocation system. Combine it with a tactics card set and
you could have a workable system. (Bigger weapons get more cards, armour
subtracts...)

Realistic Income Model: a Traveller House Rules Expansion

The following is a proposed house rule for adding realism, and thus =

work previously done by the creators of the Trillion Credit Squadron and =
I am sure others whose contributions I do not remember.

Base Income:	CR10,000

Tech Level / Port Mod (%)                   	Trade Mod (%)
	  A	    B		C	 D	   X
E      170     150     130     98      65        Ag      120

9        342     4        61
8        185     3        52

Usage: Base Income * Tech Port Mod * all Trade Mods * Social Mod

Comments:
1. Base income of CR10,000 comes from T4 retirement pay after 8 terms.
2. Class C port at tech level 11 (average imperial) is the start point.
3. Ports class C or better, a step in tech level equals a 10% gain in =
income.
4. Ports class B and A equal a 20% gain in income over the lower port.
5. Class D ports equal 75% of a class C port of the same tech level.
6. No port equals 50% of a class C port of the same tech level.
8. Trade modifications are directly from Trillion Credit Squadron.
9. Social levels below 7 are 15% lower than the next higher social =
level.
10. Social levels above 7 are 85% greater than the next lower social =
level.
11. Anything not included on the chart is the realm of the referee.

Examples:
John Normal is an average citizen (SS 7)
Lord Bern is a Baron (SS C)
Bill Labor is a minimum wage worker (SS 3)

1. On a totally average imperial planet with a class C port and an =
average
imperial technology level; John Normal makes Cr10,000, Lord Bern makes
MCr21.96 and Bill Labor makes Cr5200.

2. On a rich, agricultural planet with a class A port and a high =
imperial
technology level of 14; John Normal makes Cr32,640, Lord Bern makes
MCr70.79 and Bill Labor make Cr16,973.

3. On a non-agricultural, non-industrial planet with no port and 1970s
technology level; John Normal makes Cr1920, Lord Bern makes MCr4.16 and
Bill Labor makes Cr998.


Notes on other uses:
1. Income for social level 7 can be used as per capita GDP.
2. General tax burden can be 10% + government level.

Well, the Solommani knew about the Darrians and probably the Sworld Worlders
too, but I doubt that Cleon gave much of a care about any of them. At
any rate, I am at a distinct disadvantage, since I\'m at work and
I don\'t have my trusty library handy. I expect that Cleon would have
been more worried about the Vargr, what being a) not human b) closer
and c) reputed for being very nasty (giant debates about the lack
of reality in Vargr corsairs aside). Hell, Cleon was probably more
worried about the Vilani(!), as they could actually pose a serious
threat to his empire. The willingness of the Vilani to join the new
Imperium was probably a big relief. Actually, if it wasn\'t for
that damned rift in Corridor sector, Cleon may just as well have wooed
the Zhos diplomatically, creating a vey different third imperium...
with those evil non-psi Vilani from the new Restored Empire of
the Stars (see, I forgot the Vilani word!) beating in from anti-spinward...
Now _that\'s_ an alternate Traveller hsitory!

Anyways, I don\'t think Cleon "pushed" towards the marches that much at all.
He was probably more interested in staying in the denser parts of the 
galaxy, reclaiming old  Imperial turf. Mucho easier than breaking
new sod out in the boonies.

Hm. I\'ll have to get my copy of T4 first. However, being in T4 doesn\'t
mean that it\'s common or even uncommon knowledge in the new Imperium.
i.e. jump-6 gets mentioned too.


Oh, and I _know_ there are Toronto-based people on this list. I finally
got out of Ottawa (no Trav players!), so, anyone interested in
starting a campaign, or can I glom onto someone else\'s?

Perhaps my casual approach was too casual, that was an analogy--
I know there would be an ignition chamber where O2 would be added so it would burn
The analogy was from a description of afterburners in a book I read along time ago (no,

The problem here is assuming that just because the rulebook was riddled with
errors,
their other publications will be as well. STARSHIPS seems to be a bit behind
schedule. HOPEFULLY this is because they are taking the time to thoroughly
proofread it and make sure it is as error-free as humanly possible. They
don\'t have to rush with it; none of us would really complain if it came out
a little late, but was of higher quality in the editing department.
        Imperium Games seems to listen to their customers, particularly the
ones here. A major theme I\'ve been seeing on the Net is annoyance and
dissapointment with the editing of the rulebook. Assuming that they want to
make money, they\'ll correct this problem. As much as I love Traveller, I
WILL give up on it if it turns into another MegaTraveller fiasco as far as
errata goes. (Keep in mind it took MT a NUMBER of printings to get rid of
the errors. T4 has had only one so far. let\'s cu them some slack-for now.)

I don\'t know how Mr. Erickson discovered it, but I can suggest how 
you can *do* it:

Position your ship several light-years away from the world on which you 
wish to land in the past.

Work up a velocity of a large fraction of c *away* from the planet.
The relativistic effects skew your "plane of simultaneity" so that 
what *was* the planet\'s past is now contemporary with you.

Make a jump (or a quick series of them) to the planet.  Assuming the 
effective average speed of jump travel is the same in all frames of 
reference, you will arrive on the planet before you made your first 
jump toward it.

Of course, the distance from the target place-and-time, the speed of 
the ship away from the target, and the jump schedule all depend on 
how far back in time you want to go.

If Mr. Erickson has a different way to do it, I\'d be very interested 
to hear it.

You have all given me a lot of good ideas. A lot of the background

expand my Traveller library.

Going back to a previous posting, how many go with the idea that a naval 
base represents a large collection of small installations whose primary 
purpose is logistics?

Of course the attacker\'s first priority is scrubbing the sensors off
the surface. After they do that, it\'s not that hard to make any
internal sensors (neutrino sensors? Mass detectors?) relatively
worthless.

The one *big* vulnerability such an installation has is that being
purely military, nobody is going to get upset at you using *nasty*
weapons to crack it.

  This mirrors my experiences. There is a local GM that flat out denies
cross gender characters. He claims "the only good cross gender role
playing I\'ve seen is by homosexuals". I feel that\'s excessive, but I admit
the stats aren\'t encouraging...

  I agree, but I think it\'s better that we step back and let individual
refs sort this out than try to establish a fair comparison entrenched in
the gaming system (and possibly attract a class-action suit for
discrimination).

  FWIW, Traveller has always been a skill-based (as opposed to an
attribute based) game anyways. Even TNE, which bases skill assets on
attributes, favours skills over attributes. This pretty much makes it a
non-issue; most characters won\'t be anywhere near racial maximums anyways 
(which is primarily where differences would ultimately show up).

three shops that sell gaming stuff, plus one that sells used stuff

I still don\'t see many females, though. Out of two gaming clubs, I only

there were maybe ten women in the whole crowd (most were from out of town)

In my experience, *most* role players are young men with some kind of

You aren\'t looking at this correctly. Since none of the other worlds
have this, their sciences are going to have very weak evolutionary
theories if they have any at all. After all, if humans, and perhaps a
few food animals and plants (which will be *very* widespread by the
time science is invented) don\'t fit in with the rest of the native
organisms, that\'s going to make the jump from genetics (the monk in the
garden with the bean plants) to evolution a lot harder.

We\'ve got a fossil record, so *we* would be suspicious of candidates
that didn\'t. They don\'t and quite likely won\'t notice that lack until
several generations of scientists get beaten over the head with the
idea. 

Actually, a much better argument than fossils is in DNA. There is a
continous spectrum of DNA differences between species, and that enables
us to make pretty good guesses as to when they had a common ancestor.
This is finally getting pretty much accepted (a lot of folks were
unhappy about both how closely related we are to chimps & gorillas, and
how recently we had common ancestors).

On a planet with transported life forms, you\'d have a much different
situation. The natives would have the continous spectrum of differences
and the transplants would stick out.

Note: all comments below are talking about group *averages*, thus a
randomly chosen member of a group that "isn\'t as good" at something may
actually be *better* at it than a randomly chosen member of the group
that is "good" at it. EG, men are stronger than women, but if your
random selections turn out to be the world champ women\'s body builder,
and Joe Average, then the reverse is true OF THOSE TWO PERSONS.

Last I heard, women make up for the lack of strength by having more
stamina/endurance, a much higher "constitution" and a *very much*
higher pain tolerance.

Among other things, it has been speculated that given equal
opportunities/training women would make better fighter pilots than men,
as their small size combined with a higher G tolerance adds up to a
definite plus factor.

So we might just have the Imperial Navy recruiter looking over a guy
and looking really dubious about his desire to enter flight school. :-)
"Even if you manage to meet the standards, most of any unit you get
stationed with will be women. And they tend to make it a little \'rough\'
on men who try to \'break in\' to what they see as a woman\'s job."

(Role playing the hazing the guy would get would be lots of fun. Pity
we don\'t role play character generation)

Both of the above are the *same* timeline. You have the Codominiun,
then after Terra tries to commit nuclear suicide, the Fleet establishes
the Empire, with it\'s capital on Sparta. The Empire lasts a century or
two and falls apart in the wake of the war with the Sauron Supermen.
Eventually a second Empire starts up. "Mote in God\'s Eye" is from the
Second Empire period. So is "King David\'s Spaceship" (and the shorter
version "A Spaceship for the King"). 

BTW, that last story/stories is worth checking out to see how an Empire
might treat a lower tech world being re-contacted, and what sort of
regulations there might be about technology transfer (as well as ways
around them).

> How about John Brunner\'s early stories?

The *entire* "series" of stories about the ZRPs (Zarathrustran Refugee
Planets) is *perfect* for Traveller. In fact, it\'s not that hard to
modify the base storyline to make it work.

The basic idea is that a planet that\'s been colonized for some time
(centuries?) is discovered to have a sun that\'s going to go Nova
*soon*, and the rush to get refugees off-planet by any means available,
*especially* in the last hours after the sun has already started to get
dangerous, led to a lot of overcrowded and ill-equipped ships getting
lost. 

The ships were overcrowded, often obsolete, and they were launching in
a direct path from the nightside of the planet (dayside was dead!) and
having to go FTL while still protected by the planet\'s shadow.

In Traveller terms, this works great. It means that the last ships off
had no choice but to jump *before* reaching the 100 diameter limit.
Sure, outside 10 diameters you aren\'t *too* likely to misjump, if the
drive is in tip-top condition. But these ships were whatever could be
gotten there and carry people and life support for a jump out. So the
odds of misjump go way up, especially as captains are going to have to
balance the risk of getting too close to the edge of the shadow cone,
and misjumping. Close in, no danger from the edge, lots of danger from
misjump, farther out, less danger of misjump, but more danger of
getting fried.

In any case, this leads to lots of planets involuntarily colonized by
these misjumped ships. Mostly on planets nobody would have picked,
given a choice, and with no proper gear except what they can salvage

Oh yeah, since we *now* know that a normal star can\'t go nova, it\'d
have to be something else. Say, discovering that the star is an
irregular variable and is starting to head towards a peak that is
lethal.

Actually, more a case of sexist stupidity...

The rest of your rant is right, dead on...

I have always admired Traveller\'s stance regarding female and male 
characters being equal in all manners...

First of all, they\'d have to be insensitive louts to not be kicking 
themselves over a few of the errors.  I\'m sure Whitman and co, have 
been kicking themselves over the jump drive table, if nothing else... 
 "HOW THE *&^% DID WE FORGET THE *&^% JUMP TABLE?"
Most people WANT to turn out a quality product, and therefore are 
going to be quite concerned over their mistakes, especially those 
that are visible to the public.  Hard to imagine IG wanting to ignore 
the problem...

> 
> Never stopped GDW
> 

I hate to say it, but errata are part and parcel with book 
publishing.  Go back and take a look at your favorite novel, 
particularly if its a first printing/first edition.  I recently 
bought Executive Orders in hardcover, and since T4 had recently come 
out with a bunch of grammatical errors, I decided to pay closer 
attention to it with this book...  There were quite a few errors that 
slipped past Clancy, his editor, AND the publisher...most were simple 
misspellings, typos, or grammatical errors, but there was part of a paragraph 
that was actually reprinted within the same paragraph in 1 instance, 
as well as a missing participle in a particular sentence which 
changed its whole meaning...  

Since you read these sort of things in context, a lot of these things 
GENERALLY go unnoticed in reading in a novel.  In a more technical 
work such as a textbook, manual, or rules book for an RPG, these things 
are a little more easily noticed...  

When I was in college, I\'d seen textbooks with missing and misnumbered 
tables in the past...and these are guys with PhD\'s  for heavens 
sakes....  Its hardly an exclusive problem with GDW, IG or RPG publishers 
in general...  If a company as huge and monolithic as Random House 
can\'t eliminate the errors from a best seller, its hard to imagine 
the 1 guy who does it part time for IG to walk on water...and be able 
to with a 1st edition.  The number of serious errors are minimal, and 
on the whole, it does a good job.  The good news is that the 2nd 
edition should be just about bug free...

Methinks that you should take into account the fact that they are 
being forthright about a lot of the mistakes, and cut them a little 
slack...  

As for GDW, MT was a box o\' bugs, and I won\'t dispute that.  The 
editing for CT & TNE were loads better, so apparently GDW learned 
their lesson from MT and paid more attention to it with TNE...

Remember though, that probably the best selling RPG of all time, 
TSR\'s 1st Edition AD&D was so poorly organized, edited, and written 
that it convinced me that Gygax couldn\'t write his way out of a paper 
bag...so by most accounts I thought GDW did a good job at the time...

Well, sometimes the worst thing that can happen in life is to get 
exactly what you wish for...  Back when T4 was still a conceptual 
project there were a lot of people on this list (including yours 
truly) who expressed a desire for a rulebook that was as specifically 
divorced from the "official" campaign setting as possible.  Since T4 is 
eventually supposed to have multiple campaign settings, its going to 
have to be divorced from the setting a lot, since there\'s supposed to be 
more than 1...

As for TNE, I really didn\'t appreciate the fact that the setting was 
that enmeshed with the rules.  Hell, the setting was in the middle of 
character creation where the players had total access to all of it.  
Along with the House rules system, which I didn\'t like, this was my 
biggest pet peeve with TNE...

I prefer it this way, but I do admit that I WON\'T be running a T4 
campaign until First Survey & the Milieu 0 Sourcebooks come out.  I\'m 
currently writing a CT campaign using the cleaned up MT rules, as I 
always have.

Yes, I agree this seems to be a commonly shared sentiment here, and I hope
that IG is listening to it and will do their dead-level best to produce
error free supplements in the future.  Also, I hope that their dead-level
best is good enough.

Well, I hope you are right, but the response to the trouble some folks had
with the Core Sector Map in the T4 book doesn\'t make me happy.  Don\'t get me
wrong, until IG gets to the TNE universe, there is little \'canon\' of mine
that they can invalidate.  My trouble is that their reply to this problem
sounded to me like they were saying, "Hey, this is the way we did it, if you
don\'t like that tough!  It\'s our game and we will change what we ant to
change."  I know they didn\'t use those words, but that was the impression I
got.  That is not a healthy attitude in a company trying to find new
customers and win over old ones.

My only point to this is that in all of the novels and text books I have
read, I have found VERY FEW errors.  This in contrast with a rushed,
slap-together job on the T4 main book?  I don\'t think asking for a 95+%
error free book is out of the ordinary.  Granted, I have no idea what the
RPG industry as a whole is like, but I know that I do not like error plagued
material.

Please do not misunderstand this post.  I DO NOT WANT TO SEE TRAVELLER
DIE!!!!  What I do want is for T4 to be the absolutely best Traveller
incarnation ever.  Without error free products, I don\'t think IG (or
Traveller, unfortunately) will last long, and I doubt Traveller will survive
the demise of another company.

In order to show my support, I am now offering my help to IG.  I will gladly
proof anything they want me to proof.   Ken, Mark, anyone at IG, I am here
and willing to help.  I will do my part to provide error free, clear, and
well explained Traveller stuff.

Secret Agent

Although somewhat similar to Agents (T4, pg 32), Secret Agents are
especially trained to work covertly and to accomplish their mission without
ever being detected.  And they always work alone.  Secret Agents are field
operatives and are never assigned to desk jobs or managerial positions
(they often transfer to the Agent career if they tire of field work).  If a
Secret Agent is caught, they can expect emprisonment, torture, or
prosecution; most employers will then deny all knowledge of their existance.

Typically they will be hired by secret government agencies, shady
megacorporations, or illicit organizations.

Routine Tasks:  spy on local organizations; infiltrate enemy groups; steal
trade secrets; conduct terrorist activities; neutralize undesirable
opponents; kidnapping; work as a double-agent.

New Skills 

Poison (DEX or EDU):  The character has made an extensive study of organic
and synthetic chemicals which adversely affect other individuals in a
variety of manners from paralysis to death.  This skill includes the
ability to manufacture the poison and an antidote as well as analyze and
identify various poisons.  The character is trained in a variety of methods
in which to detect and to administer poisons.  Poison allows a character to
buy and sell on the black market from a favorable position.  

Surveillance (INT):  The character is trained to use a variety of methods
to observe other individuals without being detected.  Surveillance can be
conducted directly in person or remotely through a variety of electronic
sensors.  The character is trained to hide sensors in strategic locations,
to set up systems to receive input from the sensors, and to interpret that
data accurately.  This skill also allows the character to avoid being
detected by other surveillance systems or to confuse them.

Canada has polytechnics too (not many, I\'ll admit).

T4 may be about simplifying Traveller, but then why are you adding more
options to it? ;-)

There\'s nothing wrong with more optional rules, as long as they (a) don\'t
shift play balance, (b) are dead-end options (ie. other optional rules don\'t
build on them), and (c) are consistent with the main rules in both flavour
and effect.

Adding another career is a great example of a good optional rule, as long as
that career isn\'t unduly advantaged.  IRIS (from MegaTraveller) was a good
example of what _not_ to do:  a career that gave characters many more skills
than all other careers.  The Skimmer career (also from MT) is a good example:
the same number of skills as a Belter, but different skills (more suited to a
gas giant miner).

This weekend I hope to convert all my MegaTraveller optional careers to T4
and post them to the Web.

All the recent discussion over whether IG is or is not concerned with the 
errors in T4 has prompted me to write this message.

I know for a fact that IG is very concerned about it.  I know this 
because I (and, presumably, a number of others) have been asked to edit 
a copy of T4 and send it to IG (who will then send a new copy 
of T4 in return).  My voluminous notations, along with those of the 
other people asked to do such editing, will be used in order to produce 
"version 1.1" of T4 that will be as close to error-free as is humanly 
possible.

I\'ve been quiet on TML lately because I\'ve been so involved with editing 
T4.  :)  I plan on having it done tonight, and mailing it to them tomorrow 
(Saturday) morning.

Each of us who are doing this editing probably missed a few items, but 
together we should have it all covered.  

Oh, and no, I don\'t have any idea when a new edition of T4 would be out. :( 
Presumably sometime next year - perhaps first quarter.  I really don\'t know.

I hate to say it, but I agree with Andy on this one.  Most of the gamers at
my school exist on only prepackaged stuff.  There are some that delight in
writing adventures, but most have trouble doing so.  The English Head and I
are thinking of starting a club/seminar series on writing adventures,
developing background, etc.  (Hey, if we can \'trick\' them into learning
writing and science because they like gaming, we\'ll do it!)

I\'ve had kids tell me that I know nothing about gaming because I haven\'t
played/seen their fav. game.  They\'re usually astounded when I pull out all
the stuff I\'ve had published; then I drop a few names of other
authors/publishers that I\'ve met/talked to...  Takes them down a few notches!

in gaming and back onto more relevant subjects like relativistic rocks, I
submit for your approval the following adventure idea, which is based on
some of the pictures in the T4 rulebook. it shouldn\'t be too tough to figure
out which ones...

RED ZONE   A Traveller Adventure by Allen Shock

        The characters meet a retired Imperial Scout named Yusak
Anguukiimra, with an interesting story to tell (don\'t they all?). He shows
the characters a map of the Core Subsector and points to coordinate 0406. He
says that while the Imperium shows no world located there, the TAS has
designated this area a Red Zone. He says this is because there IS a world
there, and the Imperium has interdicted it. He knew someone who found an old
spacer\'s diary, and he and his crew located this world. However, he never
made it back; his ship was found lifeless and floating, except for one
ancient relic, a crystalline sphere mounted on a iridium base. When the
derelict\'s crew began appearing in phantom form, the would-be salvagers
left, taking only the diary they found in one of the cabins. Yusak beleives
there is valuable treasure on that world. He offers the characters cr150,000
to take him there, and will split equally any profits made on items which
are brought back. If the characters agree, he will want to leave as soon as
possible. Any attempt to locate any information on this so-called planet
will meet with failure.
        When their ship comes out of jumpspace, the characters will find
that there is indeed a planetary system in that region. As they approach the
mainworld, however, have the sensors operator make a Staggering sensors
roll. If they fail, the ship will be hit by a powerful laser (stats 3-3-1-0)
at Very Short range. It can now be determined that it was fired from one of
a number of satellites ringing the world (about 8 in all). If the characters
blow up the satellite, they can bring it aboard. 
Rather than being a relic, it clearly bears the insignia of the Imperium.
The laser has caused damage to the ship\'s contragrav lifters; unless the
ship is of airframe design, the world\'s thin atmosphere is not sufficient to
allow the ship to land. if the character\'s ship does not come equipped with
a launch or other small craft, don\'t trash their contragrav. Also, a sensor
scan of the planet picks up a strange, regular electromagnetic pulse from
the planet surface.
        The characters set down in a heavy jungle region about three
kilometers from the source of the EMP pulse. They move through the jungle
and find themselves eventually looking at a large step pyramid similar to
those constructed by the Aztecs of ancient Terra, but five times as large.
It is surrounded by an electirifed fence, and armed men wearing the uniform
of the Imperial Army patrol it\'s perimeter.
        If the PC\'s try to break in, they may be captured. If so, they will
be taken into the pyramid and marched to a holding cell. They will walk
directly past a strange portal within which is a sight familiar to all
spacers; the coruscating pattern of Jump Space. At this point, the Scout
turns on his captors, catching them by surprise. If the characters follow
suit, they can overcome their less than alert guards and gain their weapons.
The Scout then jumps INTO the portal. With soldiers now closing in on them,
what will the characters do? Do they follow their employer into the portal?
        If the characters don\'t enter the portal, they will be recaptured
and taken to see Major Harland Anders. The Major will be MOST unhappy. He
will tell the characters that their actions will most likely land them in
prison. In the meantime, they will be forced to do menial labor for the Army
mission here. He will not tell the characters what that mission is. If the
Scout managed to escape and enter the portal, he will offer the characters a
chance for a measure of leniency; go into the portal and bring him back.
        Where deos the portal lead? A number of possibilities exist, as
chosen by the GM. Here are some:
        1.) The portal leads to the derelict ship, but it doesn\'t work quite
right. Anyone who uses it gets stuck halfway between our dimension and the
jumpspace one. Since time flows differently there, the crew of the derelict
ship are still alive, and they\'ve found a portal to ANOTHER place where,
unknown to them, the Ancient who built these portals as an escape from the
Ancients War still lives...and will be VERY unhappy about receiving visitors...
        2.) The portal leads to a similar portal in another pyramid, but a
LONG way from this one; possibly on Terra, or Zhdant, or Victoria, or
someplace else. The natives of said worlds may react badly to strangers
suddenly appearing...
        3.) The portal leads to an underground base deep below the planet
surface.
This complex contains LOTS of high-tech (TL17+) stuff, and a strange alien
creature with large eyes and wings which appears to be in coldlseep
(actually in temporal stasis). It does bear some resemblance to Droyne, but
is about seven feet tall.
if anyone messes with the machinery, it will awaken. (If any of you remember
the adventure "Demon Dark" in CHALLENGE 58 by Michael R. Mikesh, you\'ll know
what this is...)

Have fun!
                        Allen

As am I, but all this discussion about M-0 has really enhanced my current 
1100\'s campaign.  It is wonderful to really get a view of the history of the 
Imperium.  I especially appreciate the comments that the Imperium was 
*different* when it was smaller; ie. more involved with policing the 
individual citizen.  This reinforces the logic behind the relative freedom in 
the circa 1100 Imperium.  Keep the kewl stuff flowing, folks!  (and quit yer

 Just thought I\'d add my 2 cents (can) worth to this topic...
 
	here in Sherbrooke, there is no attittude AGAINST gaming,
really...  yes, it is seen as a fairly geeky thing to do, but
there\'s been a \'geeky is cool\' trend in recent years here. :)
The only attitude against it is from peopel who think that gaming is
for kids, but generally they have never seen a real gaming session/.
 
Now as far as girls are concerned with the games, here we have the
additional hurdle of the games being in english and msot people not
being proefficient with english until their late teens, unless they
watch a lot of TV/read a lot of sci-fi. :) Anyways, most mid-teen
girls certainly won\'t go to the trouble of learning english just to
play a game. :)
 
In any case, I would say that there\'s 2 categories of female players
here; theater actors and hmm... "freaks".   I would say that the
majority of female players here are in fact women who started by
being interested in the dramatic arts.   The rest is mostly pariahs,
teenage girls who don\'t fit, etc etc.   
 
I\'d say tehre\'s 1 female player for 8-10 male players though I could
be a little off, I haven\'t made a survey in eyars.

OK you two, I have to drive through Phoenix tomorrow, so don\'t do anything 
destructive to the city\'s infrastructure.  Put the plasma guns away \'til 
Sunday, and divert that .1c asteroid.

Of course, I do have 4WD, just in case...

Only helpful if an enemy jumps into the system in that area.  Granted, that 
would be a good way of standing off and gathering a lot of useful electronic 
intelligence, but you (the attacker) run the risk of alerting the defenders 
long before you can hurt them.  Of course, if I was jumping in to launch an 
asteroid <THWAP>...  Oh, sorry, what was I saying?  Oh yes, I could jump in 
much closer to the mainworld, and avoid these defenses altogether.  I would 
still have these stations, but they would be a fairly minor part of my overall 
strategy.

>Second Layer:  Bases on Saturn and Jupiter. 
Absolutely, ranging from listening posts to good-sized fighter / SDB bases.  
And some SDBs cruising around in the Gas Giant\'s atmosphere, to pop-up later 
for a little surprise.

Yup, and some Meson sites as well for extra fun-n-games.

Really, you\'d have several Fourht Layers; one around each of your more 
important planets/asteroids/space stations.  I would imagine that the "Ships of 
the Line" in these postions would NOT be jump-capable starships, but would 
instead be really big SDBs; maybe even that big planetoid monitor.  Your 
jump-capable fleet should be out in the spacelanes causing trouble for the 
enemy\'s worlds and supply lines; that\'s what you spent all that money on the 
jump drives for.

>Final Layer: Minimal HEO/LEO defenses, mostly limited to defending orbital
>repair installations and facilities. 
I would arm this layer quite heavily, as it would be very cost effective.  By 
arming heavily, I mean have plenty of lasers, missiles and even "spinal" 
weapons on the larger stations, base lots of fighters on them, and support them 
with lots of independant defensive satellites.  Being close in, you are near to 
the support and maintenance personnell, you can spend less money on support and 
waste less space for long-term crew quarters.  The idea about sneaky "one shot" 
missile or gun emplacements is neat; I would suggest these be mobile for even 
more security; enemy intelligence might learn the location of permanent 
one-shot missile silos, but a set of big grav vehicles with missiles or that 
can combine into a Meson Gun would be quite a nasty variable for the attacker\'s 
planners to deal with.

This would be interesting to game out.  I would try using Battle Rider in a 
sort of mini-campaign.  Let the defender develop his layers of defense based on 
a specific budget, and let the attacker try to punch through, one layer at a 
time (each layer being a different scenario).  Eventually, if the attacker gets 
to the final layer, he gets to use his remaining ships to defeat the planetary 
defenses and try to suppress hidden missiles and meson sites while landing 
troops.  IF he gets that far...

The thing is, everyone was warned that this was going to happen! They said
SPECIFICALLY that only the systems that the PC\'s could know about in Year 0
would be detailed. Everything else would just be dots on a map; each
campaign would determine their own survey results. Given the MAJOR errors in
most of the survey data generated by DGP\'s flawed sector generation program,
since they had to change it all anyway, why not change the map, too? It IS
Marc Miller\'s game. The decision to alter the Core Sector was MARC MILLER\'s;
IG just published what he gave them.
        Sylea/Capital still exists. As I recall, in the official GDW
publications, that and Reference were the only planets in the Core Sector
that had been detailed at all. I see nothing wrong with IG\'s attitude;
they\'re doing what the game\'s creator, and the man they pay the licensing
fees to, wants them to do.

No one likes mistakes, but they can occasionally be amusing. I own an Avalon
Hill boxing game called Title Bout. Do you know a boxer can be disqualified
for being an International Butt? I have never seen an RPG product that
wasn\'t riddled with errors on a first printing. With the possible exception
of TSR. companies this small can\'t afford professional-quality editors. They
might get lucky and find someone who has talent, but most of the time they
don\'t.
        Another one of my favorite Traveller typos (this one courtesy of
Pyramid Magazine\'s "Murphy\'s Rules"); the text in TNE clearly states that it
is the PLAYERS, not the "characters", who take burn damage from vehicle
explosions. (" C\'mon, Bob, it\'s in the rules. Now hold still while I get the

Has anyone tried to calculate the amount of fuel necessary to do this? I
haven\'t but it sounds like it would be prohibitive. The only way I can
think of is if the ship has access to one or more of the handy dandy
"bag of holding" Portals from the Signal GK adventure. (Apologies for

You have at least a 95% error-free book in T4.  A book that is 95% error-free 
would have one word in twenty wrong, spelled incorrectly or missing.  ;-)

Seriously, the book has errors, and some of them are big honking ones, but I\'ve 
much worse from much larger companies.  Anybody out there ever look at the 
first edition of Gamma World?  Somebody mentioned AD&D Player\'s Handbook 1st 
edition.  Heck, that was Shakespeare compared to the first edition of the DM\'s 
Guide.  And by that time, TSR was large enough to have several full-time 
professional editors on the job.  The point is that these got better, and 
hopefully T4 will also get better.

I have my own beefs with T4, but quality control probably won\'t be one of 
them.  These guys seem to care about what they\'re doing.  In the ideal world 
they should have kept T4 until it was truly ready, but the realities of 
marketing and venture capital decreed that Imperium Games was REQUIRED to have 
something ready by GenCon.  Sure, they could have been stiffnecked and stuck to 
their principles, but the likely result of that would have been less press 
coverage, less exposure and less venture capital.  I imagine IG would have 
loved another month (heck, even another week), but reality said NO, and reality 
can be a bitch sometimes.  

(Oh, great, now I\'m starting to sound like The Tick.  Slap me if I start mixing 
metaphors).

I\'ve worked on startup (non-gaming) magazines before, so I know some of the 
crap IG had to go through.  Frankly, I\'m amazed they managed to get a book out 
with no upside down pictures; that was always our biggest problem.  Someday I\'d 
love to find a truly first edition copy of Traveller to see how many errors 
were in those little black books.  I suspect the result would be surprising.

IIRC, the _Kinunir_s were built in the eleventh century (pre-Civil War).
I\'m sure I remember a note that only 20 were built and all served in the
Marches (in CT).  _The Regency Sourcebook_ says they were returned to
production during the Final War.  Is it likely to find them in the former
Solomani space (e.g. RC)?

Always glad for your input Joe, but let me clarify.  I have no misconception
that IG isn\'t worried about the errors.  I know that they are intelligent
men and interested in running a good business, and therefore they must be
concerned about the errors.  My big beef is that the errors made it into the
final product.  Yeah, they may not be MAJOR errors, but there are a number
of them.  That is my concern.

I am very glad to hear this, but IMHO, the damage has already been done by
sending out T4 with the (to use your word, Joe) voluminous errors that were
there.  BTW, IG, I would be willing to do this on the same deal if you want.
I want to be very clear, I am willing to do everything I can to provide a
better product.  If that means IG wants me to proofread everything, I will
do my best to clean up any errors I find, and then when the book comes out,
I will dutifully purchase my copy.  I am not just griping, I am pointing out
what I feel is a problem and I am offering a solution.

>Oh, and no, I don\'t have any idea when a new edition of T4 would be out. :( 
>Presumably sometime next year - perhaps first quarter.  I really don\'t know.

Sooner the better, IMO.  I think IG would also be wise to offer this new
book at a discount to those willing to send in their old book (like offer a
mail in rebate or something).  It is more important now that ever that
future products be error free.

For the glory of the Flame...

What you\'re saying is very true, and I didn\'t mean to imply that you 
specifically were concerned about IG\'s willingness to repair the existing 
errors.  I posted that comment simply to get the information out there 
that something IS being done about the grammatical/typographic errors, 
and not just the errata-worthy stuff like missing jump tables. 

In short, my message was intended as a reassurance, not as an attack.  
I\'m sorry that it came off differently than I intended.  I guess I should 
error-check my postings better. [sigh]

And, again, I never intended to say that you, or anyone else, was "just 
griping."  I just saw a lot of posts regarding the seriousness and 
quantity of errors in T4, and thought it might prove reassuring to know 
that there really is an effort under way to make things better the next 
time around.  In other words, something more than what I had said before, 
which was essentially, "Well, IG is a good company, and they\'ll do better 
next time."  Something concrete.

Yup, I could have phrased it better.  Sigh.

I\'m very sorry for the confusion I caused.

I\'m not familiar enough with Relativity to fully understand this, but I 
think it\'s fascinating.  I would like to use it in an adventure, but I need 
more facts.  Could you please explain it further?  Why would your frame of 
reference be in the planet\'s past?  I thought that relativistic speeds would 
make it so that a trip to the center of the galaxy would be 10 years to you 
and 10,000 years to the planet you left (gross approximation here). 
 Wouldn\'t that be time travelling to the future?  How would jump drive 
change this?  Exactly how fast would you need to be going and how far away 
from the planet would you have to go to travel a certain time backward? 
 Please tell me more!  Fascinating!!  Thanks!

time science is invented) don\'t fit in with the rest of the native
organisms, that\'s going to make the jump from genetics (the monk in the
garden with the bean plants) to evolution a lot harder.

This would be very true for scientists on planets which did not evolve any 
life on their own.  But since there are many planets which did, and 
scientists there would be able to see fossil evidence of (alien) evolution, 
I wouldn\'t think that those scientists would have weak evolutionary theories 
(unless they were very religious ;) ).  Even Vland has locally evolved life 
forms that human Vilani can\'t eat without special food preparation 
techniques.  The fossil evidence for the evolution of the local life forms 
would not only help demonstrate evolution, it would highlight the fact that 
some (transplanted) life forms, including humans, did not fit in at all. 
 This would drive scientists to search for a reason why.  Don\'t you agree?

I live in Japan and I haven\'t received my hardcover T4 yet.  I ordered in in 
July or so, and I guess I must have asked to have it sent by surface mail. 
 I\'m really discouraged by all the reports of errata, though.  I hope IG 
gets much more careful about it in the future.  Spell checking their e-mail 
messages would be another way to show us that IG will pay attention to 
detail in the future.  I began to worry about the possibility of errata 
problems when I saw Ken Whitman\'s first message announcing his policy toward 
Traveller fans long ago.  I\'m sure he is a great person, and I mean no 
insult to him or anyone else by nitpicking their spelling, but glaring 
spelling errors on a regular basis tend to give a bad impression of 
carelessness, especially from someone who is going to be publishing many 
books.  It\'s like seeing a tailor who\'s suit doesn\'t fit right.

Anyone know where I can mail order some of the stuff GDW published just 
before going under (like Guilded Lilly, last few Challenges)?

Nope. I just read science articles in things like Scientific American
and Analog.

But the nova stuff is old news. 5-10 years, easy. 

Novas are a binary system with a white dwarf or neutron star (if forget
which, or if it can be both) that is close enough to the other star for
gas exchange to happen. 

The material from the normal star builds up on the surface until
there\'s enough to initiate a fusion reaction. Off goes the star like a
giant flashbulb.

Of course, how big a bang you get depends on how fast the stuff
accumulates. If it accumulates too much, too fast, you get a core
collapse, which gives a supernova and destroys the star. (oops!)

This goes against centuries of precedent. If you can\'t easily put the
defenses "in" the base, you surround it with fortified emplacements
that have to be reduced before attacking the base becomes practical. In
Traveller this is doable.

Way too small. To be of any practical use, they need to be *bigger*
(and nastier) than any ship or combination of ships that will attack.
Check out harbor forts for any pre-WWII naval base. *Big* guns.
Multiple yards of armor.

Because, while a fleet is needed to attack, and is useful for defense,
it is *critical* to be able to keep the enemy from taking important
systems and bases. 

Remember, rule #1 in warfare is HOLD ON TO YOUR OWN TERRITORY. 

Flexibility is useless if the enemy holds your territory. And
non-mobile fortifications don\'t use many of the same resources that the
fleet uses. Powerplants are pretty generic, and they are more likely to
use the sort used for stationary installations, not spacecraft (that
makes them cheaper, because they can be larger and heavier, and easier
to get at for maintenance). They don\'t use drives. They do use weapons,
but many of them will be of a different sort.

Oh yeah, better check the way military budgets are written.
Expenditures for fleets and for bases come out of different budget
areas.

No kidding. Though they may want to hide the location of some sensors,
just to make them harder to knock out.

The difference is that the Iraqis don\'t expect nuclear attack. We do.
Defending against nukes on the ground is a pain, and generally not
worth it. So we only do so at places like Cheyenne mountain, SAC
headquarters, the National Command center, etc. In space, it\'s a
requirement.

The base can be in the asteroid, more likely the base would be
protected by several asteroids that had been moved into orbits
providing overlapping fields of fire. You\'d have to knock out one or
more of them to be able to get near the base without getting blown out
of the sky.

Considering the size of asteroid you\'d want to dig into, the space for
these things is almost inconsequential. To have sufficient thickness of
nickel iron for armor, you\'ll be digging into something kilometers
across. So you\'ve got room for cubic kilometers of equipment. 

Besides the fact that it makes better armor, there\'s another reason for
picking nickel iron asteroids. The metal you cut out to build things
can be sold for a profit, or used to help build ships. In fact, it\'s
quite possible that there will be large *unused* spaces.

scenario. Using *two* ships avoids loading all the accel/decel onto one
ship, as well as the need to jump twice without refueling.

So it\'s much easier to send messages than ships.

Note that fighting a base dug well into an ice moon is going to be
*hell* to reduce. They have essentially unlimited fuel. And in the case
of some of the moons, the base may be mobile (think of a deep meson
site inside a submarine cruising the under ice oceans of Europa). Given
the temp of the moon, heat dissipation is easy. So you can build the
powerplant from hell to run things.

Heck, given the amount heat the base would generate, it could melt its
way thru the ice at quite a clip.

There are good reasons to go ahead and build some substantial "strong
points" in the belt, not just small bases. Partly for the purpose of
building "forts" to be moved into Earth orbit.

With even year 0 tech, it is possible to move sizable asteroids into
Earth orbit if you are willing to take your time. So putting a dozen or
so into orbit as last ditch defenses is not unreasonable. And they\'ll
help draw fire *away* from the planet.

>From discussions in rec.arts.sf.science, you have *one* important
detail wrong. You want to your velocity to be *towards* the planet
(this is assuming a jump out, accelerate, jump back scenario).

And the critical speed is supposedly when the product of your effective
speed from the jump and your realspace velocity exceeds c.

The easy way is to have someone in a jump 6 ship accelerate to high
speed *towards* the target in a system 6 parsecs away. You jump out in
another jump 6 ship, beam the critical info (Zhodani attack coming at
XXX) to the other ship as soon as you exit jumpspace, and they jump to
the system you left, arriving *before* you left.

I have to sit down and work of a good set of example figures to show
this.

Sorry. Very little even existed on paper. Dragging out my old campaign
notebook, I find only this: 

"Hajira/Gateway: G4IV, A000777-E  S      Non-Agri     G.
A vast array of ice and rock belts, mostly claimed by five nations... [etc]

First and last stop on the Frontier Hajj Route. The Larikan Belt is the
home of the Rock of Duriam, considered sacred by the Galactic Spritualists,
Zensunni, and Aljeyans."

And that\'s about it. I\'d intended to develop it in detail, with maps and so
on, but of course I never had the time. My players were keen to get started
right away, so I began running the campaign without being entirely
prepared...

Oh wait, there\'s more in the little "Gateway Subsector Library Data"
booklet I wrote on a terrible old manual typewriter, in around 1982. Here
we are:

"Rock of Duriam: Most famous of several known Ancient sites in the Frontier
Extents. Also called the "Ship of Gold", this 25km wide spheroid of rock in
the Hajira Belt was discovered four centuries ago. Consists mostly of an
amalgam of silicates and carbonaceous chondrite, with an unusually high
gold content. Hollowed out and fitted as a space habitat millenia ago by an
unknown race whose identity is hotly debated by archaeologists. Many
religions, primarily the Galactic Spiritualists, Aljeyans and Zensunni,
consider it a holy shrine and make long pilgrimages to tour the structure.
(See Kilsyth/Hajira War.)"

(The \'war\' was a conflict between the "retro-Islamic" religious
dictatorship that once ruled the Hajira system, and the militant atheists
of nearby Kilsyth, which resulted in the balkanization of Hajira. Lots of
terrorist activity ever since, abortive jihads to reunite the belts, etc.
Typical background craziness in my CT game...)

The Solomani authorites had been unable to fathom its workings, and to stop
the continual agitation and terror attacks agreed to open the thing to
Pilgrims and tourists. Of course, as soon as they heard about it, the PCs
wanted to take the tour, and I had to wing it. Made up all sorts of cryptic
architectural weirdness off the top of my head - that\'s when I came up with
the glyphs appearing in the walls - very little of which actually meant
anything.

I\'d been hoping the PCs would do something crazy, sneak away from the tour
party, knock out some guards and try to steal something incredibly
valuable, and set off some unfathomable Ancient technology in the process.
But they wussed out.

So it goes...

PS: To Trent Smith: Yeah, _Secret of the Ancients_, that\'s the one. Never

Granted that fuel considerations *may* well make missiles on a 30 minute
game turn scale slower and thus be *effectively* equal to a 6G2 or 12G1 or
whatever.

The problem is, of course, that all missiles in Traveller are assumed to
be *one ton*. A 100-ton Bay contains 100 missiles. That\'s always been the
assumption.

Why?

Why not a 5-ton or 10-ton missile? That way you could concievably have
missiles with enough fuel to be a (for example - and, no, I haven\'t worked
this out yet!) 10 ton 48G turn missile (i.e. 48G1, 24G2, 12G4 6G8 etc.).
And, of course, this something that no previous version of Traveller has
ever allowed for - neither have they allowed for *better* missiles. Like
the QSDS which allows only TL8 missiles (for example).

For really large ships you could have larger missiles - perhaps a 100 ton
sensor drone armed with 1 ton missiles (a missile with missiles, in
effect!), or a *really* long range missile. They would be just great for
surprise attacks - the first thing the defending ships would know would be
that all these drive flares on their gravitic sensors would come up, as
the missiles that have been coasting in stealthed mode lit their drives to
attack. Or, you could have one sob of a 100-ton missile with *really* high
speed and *much* longer endurance than anything would likely be able to
get away from!

I know that the Starships book is *supposed* to be finished - but the
release date in the main rulebook is listed as September 96 - and no-one
on any of the relevant lists has mentioned it as being available ... and
it isn\'t listed as being available (well, as of last night, I haven\'t
checked for tonight) by Imperium Games on their Web Page, either. So why
not mention it (missiles, I mean)?

Just some thoughts, anyway.

The 19th & 20th of October sees a games weekend in Sheffield (UK). I now own my 
shiny (though conservatively laid out) T4. So I\'ll inflict it on the assembled 
veteren rpgers. Their verdict on all versions of Trav are split 50/50. 
Irregardless of the task system, it appears to be the background and the depth 
of the vision that either turns them on or leaves them cold.

I\'d like to run something that stretches the game a little and gives them a feel 
for the task system and combat. Any thoughts on a good one off, of about 4 to 5 
hours playing time. I had wondered about playing with a modified Shadows.

The errors and typos don\'t worry me by the way. IG are looking for errata and 
will sort the teething problems out. What does bother me (a bit) is the lack of 
integration between scales in combat. Most systems will have a method of mixing 
character, vehicle, and bigger scales relatively seamlessly. Star Wars, Heavy 
Gear and Mekton all spring to mind. I feel it\'s a bit of a shame this was not 
alluded to in T4. Yep you can \'make it up\', but then so you can with most of the 
rest of the game too. Simplicity yes, but a broader vision here would have been 
helpful. I hope this will be resolved soon. I am multiplying the vehicle armour 
by 5 when defending against character weapons. Does that feel OK?

The D3 in task resolution doesn\'t look that useful, we\'ll see what my lot make 
of it. The 3D max damage also feels wrong. It is very hard to kill someone with 
a single shot. But then perhaps that was the idea :)

Well, an additional chapter with background information wouldn\'t have

See above.  The problem with rulebook the way it is now is, that it might 
be somewhat useful for people running their own campaign backgrounds.  
For people who would like to play according to the material provided (in 
future supplements) by IG it\'s right now not very useful (if you have not 
played Traveller in the past and want to stay consistent with whatever IG 
will produce you\'ll need to wait).

Now adding a chapter with background info wouldn\'t hurt players like you 
a lot -- you could simply ignore it.  Not having such a chapter hurts 
players like me (I want to use the IG background) quite a lot, since I 
can\'t make everything up without becoming very inconsistent to the 
official background.

Well, some people have to work a lot and just can\'t spend as many hours 
creating a new campaign of their own than they could when they were in 
school.  I never thought that I ever would lack the time to write my own 
adventurers and create my own campaigns but right now other 
responsibilities in life prevent me from doing that.  Thus I\'d be very 
happy if there was more "meat " I could be using.

I guess that\'d make me one of the remaining two.  8)

Everyone seems to have this mistaken feeling that TNE is a military 
style game.  It\'s not there\'s plenty of other things going on here TNE 
like our modern world is media influenced and Military opperations get 
press.  When was the last time the CIA or MI9 or the KGB walked up to a 
microphone and told the world what they were up to.  It doesn\'t happen 
intelligence operations are secret and they never take out an add in the 
paper.  There\'s plenty going on in TNE besides smash and grabs.

Dave, sorry I\'ve been so long getting back to you with more stuff for 
your page.  Finally setteled into my new place so I\'ll start writing more 
soon, I promise.  8)

	Ok, now that we have "Milieus", I think someone should sit
down and really take the time to create a Timeline Database so 
we can check what\'s anachronistic and what\'s not.
 
	Of course a lot of the entries would/could be wrong, but I
think it would be a great help overall.

I am still decidedly on the side of keeping background/milieu to a minimum in a
rules book.  Providing examples would be fine, especially if there were
multiple settings outlined in a open framework for later addition by a referee,
but adventures and such like can come later.

Here\'s another suggestion: include with future releases of T4 a set of, say:

*	12 patrons (as in 76 patrons)
*	4 Amber zones
*	possibly an outline of a longer campaign with adventure ideas.

But, please, in the name of the Emperor, avoid getting it mixed in with the
rules.

Here\'s a thought that is probably completely off-base, but what the Hell, 
it would explain some things:

The first printing of T4 was intended for experienced Traveller players.  
Thus, the previously-noted lack of information on the back cover, the 
numerous errors, etc.  They just weren\'t that concerned about making it 
perfect.  Get something out there - something usable.  Make a small print 
run, and sell them out to the hard-core Traveller gamers.  Get feedback 
from them, in the mean-time producing all the supplementary material 
necessary for new gamers.  In January of 1996, release the new T4, 
error-free (thanks to all the feedback from the hard-core gamers).  By then, 
the background, etc. supplements are available.  At that time, produce 
the books in LARGE quantity, and get them into every store.  That is 
when IG expects to sell to neophytes - not now.

As I said, it is probably completely wrong.  But, it _does_ explain 
things.  Right now, IG really doesn\'t have a product that is useful to 
new gamers and those unfamiliar with Traveller.  They won\'t have that 
until all of this year\'s supplements are out, and the revised T4 is 
available.  

If you think this is an evil plan, blame it on the venture capitalists 
who we assume must be funding IG.  They were not willing to provide 
enough capital to allow IG to wait until all those supplements were ready 
to go to press, so IG had to get things out quickly - even if that meant 
the playability would suffer in the short term.  In the long term, 
everything will be OK - especially since relatively few gamers will have 
even heard of the new T4 by January (thus, few will know of the 
error-riden nature of the original version).

Anyway...

Here is an illustration of my viewpoint, and I am sure that most people would 
share it when it comes to their likes/dislikes of various Traveller versions.

I like spaghetti.  It is my favorite food, a well made plate of spaghetti can 
drive my saliva glands into a state of sheer ecstacy...    but...

I like it the way my *dad* makes it.  Anything else is pasta blasphemy!  I 
have taught my wife how to make it that way, and now she makes it perfectly!  
If you ever invite me over to your house for dinner, DON\'T make spaghetti.  
You wouldn\'t get it right (lasagna woud be nice, though).  I know, you think 
that you know how to make a pretty tasty batch of spaghetti, but forget it...  
it just wouldn\'t compare -- you would spoil it by adding your own favorite 
spice or you wouldn\'t add enough meat or something.

Chances are, if you came over to my house and I made the perfect spaghetti for 
you -- you\'d probably think it was okay, but nothing to write home about.  As 
far as I am concerned, you don\'t know how to judge good spaghetti, but that 
doesn\'t matter, because I will keep on eating it the way I like it.

It is not a matter of "Well, Boyd is just USED to that kind of cooking."  But, 
of "Boyd LOVES that kind of cooking."  Is there a "right" way to make 
spaghetti?  Well, if I am going to eat it, there is.  Do I know that other 
people like wierd kinds of spaghetti?  Yes I do, bless their hearts.  ;-)>

I like Classic Traveller for the *flavor*.  If you think it\'s bland, well, 
pour some Zhodani invasion, rebellion or virus on it, but when you come to my 
house -- were having it the way I like it.

I gotta go now...   I\'m hungry.

That may be. But the 3I /did/ reach Mora 60 years after its founding. If
there was no push, then there must have be some pull. Cleon\'s son, Cleon
the Weak may very well have personally set foot in the Marches, since he spent
the years after his abdication on the frontier.

(Very good point you made about the Vargr and Vilani, BTW.)

Point well taken. But I strongly suspect that the "Library Data" section
was geared towards new players in the Milieu 0 campaign. This entry
especially, since it points out that the precise location of the Zhodani
Consolate is "not known." That would surely make the setting pretty
early in the empire\'s history (the first war with the Zhodani was fought
by the 500\'s.)

that the worlds on the rimward edge of the Core subsector map have not
been detailed. I just want to point out a thing or two which may go a
litte way toward explaining any apparent "inconsistancies."

1)	The text explicitly states that there has been no "FORMAL"
contact with these worlds for over 200 years. This is not such an
unusual thing. Japan had no FORMAL contact with the rest of the world
for quite a while. This was not because of some technological or
geographic limitation; it was a political decision by the Japanese
government.

I believe it was true until the last few years that the US had no formal
contact with Vietnam. (Or partly true. "Formal" is sufficiently vague
a word to allow for many interpretations.)

2)	In no place does T4 state that the IISS has no knowledge
whatsoever of these worlds. Just that the players don\'t.

3)	All of the worlds in Core are on a jump-1 main with Sylea EXCEPT
for these "mystery worlds." You need jump-2 to reach any of them. In a
lower tech Imperium dominated by jump-1 ships, these worlds are located
in a pretty serious backwater. This could make them the equivalent of
Pitcairn Island from a Sylean\'s point of view.

	-	-	-

All in all, I\'d say that T4 is following the grand Travller tradition of
giving you just enough information to get you wondering about things,
exploring things, and thinking things through. The mysteries get solved
in later products. (Which can be exciting, but it can sometimes take
some of the fun away. Adventure 12 sure did make my players stop
wondering about the Ancients!)

All this talk about IG putting out an inconsistent product seems a
little premature to me. It\'s Marc Miller\'s universe; he\'s an intelligent
and thoughtful guy. Let\'s wait to hear him out before we knock his work
(or anyone else\'s). And cheer up! It\'s almost certainly NOT going to be as
bad as you fear!

(But, remember what Marc\'s Traveller philosophy is: it\'s just as certainly
NOT going to be what you would expect!)

I\'ve read somewhere over the years that Cleon was half vilani and half 
solomani.  I think his mother was solomani since he was the founder of 
the Zhunastu Dynasty.  If memory serves, this was one of his attributes 
that made him an attractive leader to consolodate the Sylean Federation 
and found the 3I.  

The solomani are adventurers reaching out into space because it is 
there--everyone else be damned.  This spirit in the people was one of the 
main factors that allowed them to conquer the vilani when they ran into 
them.  

I\'ve also read somewhere that the solomani founded the scout service at 
the start of the 3I.  The solomani are explorers while the vilani are 
sedentary and jealous with their technology.  As Cleon started the 
3I, the solomani had considerable political power--a left over from 
the Rule of Man.  This is why the Marches were first explored with the 
landing on Mora in 60.  The solomani settled over 75% of the Marches.  
Look at the Sword Worlds--90% solomani.

So, I agree, Cleon was concerned in the early years with consoldating the 
denser area around him and reclaiming Imperial space, but he also had a 
focus on expansion.  He was, after all, half solomani.  

We hit the Marches in 60 and spread like wild fire.  Refer to your 
Zhodani alien module.  The first contact the zho\'s had with Imperial 
traders was in 50.  This must have been an uneasy time with only 
occasional contact betweeen the two races for 500 years or so.  Solid 
contact with the expanding 3I came during the Imperium\'s 6th century of 
existence, and the First Frontier War followed almost immediately in 589. 

Since then, its been constant conflict with the zho\'s until the 1200\'s 
when the Virus banded the Regency and the zho\'s together.

Actually, I assumed they were half a ton each with the other half ton
being
used for internal transport, storage, and arming mechanisms.  FF&S seems
to
support this (another assumption of mine based on the actual volume for
standard missiles as stated in the FF&S errata sheet).

I have worked it out and you\'re right. I\'ve designed a "Banshee"-class
missile
which volumes out at 13.97 cu.m. with a weight of 17.05 mtons. Built at
TL17,
it can pull *21Gs* constant for 2.24 hours (four combat turns in BL) and
engage
a target at an effective range of 60000km (2 hexes). A host of these
things
blew into oblivion a 5000 disp. ton Midu Agashaam-class destroyer in 1
combat
turn without it getting off a single shot...the launching ship displaced
slightly less than *500* tons.

Or, better yet, how about dumping submunitions canisters out of a
1000-ton
merchant\'s cargo holds to give attacking pirates a very bad day? With
FF&S,
this was all possible; hopefully, the Starship book (or future
supplement)
will allow for this.

To paraphrase Gen. G.S. Patton, 
"Superior firepower is the key to successful negotiations."

I\'ve noted this at the Grapevine (the local comic/game/etc emporium). The under-18 game 
groups seem to be all-male and suffer from a near-fatal case of testosterone overload. 
When one of them wants to play in _my_ game (we have a shortage of older players 
locally), I quickly set him straight. The GM\'s girlfriend issue is what Paul Lucas calls 
the Snooky-Wookums Syndrome. I used to GM for my ex-wife, who expected preferential 
treatment from me . . . and I didn\'t give in! She stopped playing, but I count that as 
her loss, not mine ;)

My few female players were not this obnoxiously male in character . . . but the guys who 
played women seemed to have problems dealing with sexuality. Funny, but my female NPCs 
_aren\'t_ pushovers for the blandishments of any male -- PC or NPC -- that comes along! 
In my C-punk game, I gave each woman in the band a "type," a kind of guy who appealed to 
her, based on the woman\'s own personality. Moonsinger -- the lead singer and NewAge 
crystal-cruncher -- yearned for a guy with a strong spiritual center to complement her 
own spirituality and offset her own moodiness. The right character never entered the 
game. Athena, the martial-artist drummer, liked big, tough lifeguard types. One of the 
party\'s Solos -- a former SEAL -- proved to be her match.

My view -- that gender equality is a prerequisite to a hopeful future -- is not 
necessarily the view  held on the 9,978 _other_ worlds that belong to the RC. Granted, 
the equality-in-imagery is also a protective marketing point in the current political 
climate. Inequality is NOT "PC."

Be prepared to don those Nomex undershorts, Thanasis, but rest assured that I\'m not 
going to be the one spraying the napalm or tossing the WP grenades at this post. 
Consider this: RPG character-generation systems are designed to generate *exceptional* 
human beings. It is axiomatic that the dramatic "stars" of the larger-than-life dramas 
that are RPGs be themselves larger than life. Exceptional men *and* women. Since PCs -- 
male and female -- are, by definition, _exceptional_ examples of humanity, I don\'t think 
that there\'s a real need to vary the stats for the sexes.

Once again, thanks for a tasty post!

I\'m going to make use of it. My noble retinue _needs_ an annoying, reoccuring tabloid 
reporter. I\'m thinking of a tabloid version of Lois Lane . . . .

As far as the "award" is concerned, there are two mentioned in books published by GDW 
(trying to stay away from the "c" word). One -- in Survival Margain -- is a TAS award 
that sends the reporter on a expense-paid trip in the Marches; and the reporter agrees 
to write a feature for the JTAS (my copy is not close at hand . . .). Two, in Challenge, 
is mention of a RC reporter who recieved the "Nimban Palm" for excellence in Journalism 
for coverage of the legendary Venzia Raid.

Keep us posted on this, Allen. I\'d be interested in seeing how you manage to pull off T4

I like your campaign premise. Mine was shaped by circumstances. It started out as a 
"one-on-one" game (one player, me as GM), and the character was a noble, so I decided to 
do the noble diplo-dink/espionage/courier thing . . . now I have five players, all of 
them crew for the noble\'s yacht or retainers. To give the player an experienced 
Traveller-universe sage, I created an NPC aide.

So far, the noble has fought rapier duels, formented a rebellion by assassinating a 
planetary ruler (this will have some *interesting* consequences as the business 
interests behind the former ruler pursue the party across the subsector and strive to 
create political probs for the noble at home . . .), and is in the middle of a web of 
industrial espionage (the noble doesn\'t yet know that the victim of the ind-esp is the 
same  megacorp that propped up the former planetary ruler . . .) and a frontier naval 
war with the Despot of Ardis.

GREAT idea! My own pirates are privateers for Ardis, a world run by a dictator with 
delusions of grandeur and morality. The Despot is the kind of a man who would kidnap a 
random citizen off the street and personally knife him to death just to see if his blade 
is sharp. Most of the privateers would turn against him if not for the effectiveness of 
the Despot\'s secret police or for their hatred of the Imperium.

The _Solee_ in the New Era have _Kinunirs_. The Despot of Ardis has his privateers, none 
of which are over 1000 tons (I like keeping my naval combatants smallish; not even a 
Sylean carrier is over 1000 tons in my game)

I\'m one of them, Dave ;)

I loved the RC setting from the moment I read _Survival Margain_. There are, to my mind, 
few things more compelling than _building_ the future, a future where the acts --or 
non-acts -- of an intrepid few _matter_. After several years of remitting darkness in 
the gaming hobby -- typified by Vampire and Cyberpunk -- I was happy to see a game that 
rejected the darkness in favor of a challenging, but hopeful, vision of the future. 

I\'d sure like to see what happens next with the Solee, with Maggart\'s visit to 
Oriflamme, and all the other stuff that came up in CINet. . . .The Regency can \'keep the 
flame\'; the RC is building its own, improved, torch to light the way for humanity.

Well, I am. What I\'ve decided to do is to adapt my M0 game to what IG has so far 
provided in T4. I assume that not every world on the Core Subsector map is a member of 
the Federation-cum-Imperium. There are several worlds out in Core Subsector -- notably 
Ardis -- that has the population, attitude (based on Gov type and law level) and tech 
base to be a royal pain in the powerplant to the Federation. There is also no Imperial 
Naval base there, and it\'s a TL12 world . . . so I assume that Ardis is to the 
Federation/Imperium what the Solee are for the RC -- an stumbling block, an early 
challenge. The Despot of Ardis (the planetary dictator) dreams of dominating the Syleans 
and is currently using "privateers" and false-flag naval units to disrupt Sylean 
shipping.

I _love_ these books! Honor is a great motivation for me to create realistic NPCs. The

Very Travelleresque.

The former was one of the most significant books I\'ve ever read; it literally changed my

I cite as my authority the novel _To Dream of Chaos_; the Solee had a number of them in 
the book. 

Might these relics be prizes captured by the Solomani during their offensive from the

Same here. I was in the Navy in the mid-late 70s. As I hailed from a then-backwater 
Central Valley town (Modesto, which is no longer a sleepy backwater) I didn\'t even _see_ 
D&D until I went into the Navy. I didn\'t see Traveller until a little later.

The last woman who played in any of my games (it was my personal _GURPS Space_ 
universe, "Swords and Blasters," my ode to 1930s sf space-opera), she played a Felinoid 
sneak-thief. Yes, the aliens were modern Americans in cheesy rubber costumes -- Canoids 
and Feliniods that got along like cats and dogs, the Canoids were loyal and the 
Felinoids were mysterious and sneaky, etc, *but it was fun*! She was the wife of one of 
my Cyberpunk players -- the five-fem rocker game. She played a technoid character in 
that game. She left my games when her husband was transferred by the USAF.

In this rednecked, fundimentalist-Christian dominated community, it is not _physically 
safe_ to advertise that you play RPGs, practice alternative spirituality or are 
otherwise "wierd." The Friendly Local Game Store has been _picketed_ by the local Fundie 
Christians as a source of those _evil_, devil-games.

I always say that my hobbies are "SF, military science, military history, and 
computers." The synrgy is obvious to those in the know, but is not to the local 
mundanes.

I can\'t find a "skill level" either. My only suggestion is fake it with
a target number of 8. I believe this was the number from the Classic
Traveller Animals supplement and the T4 animal concepts seem
to have been from it.

 Freelance Traveller is yet another permutation on the idea of a
 "Webzine", a "Fanzine", and a resource site.  In this case, the
 focus is (obviously) the Traveller game line, including
 versions from the now-defunct Game Designers\' Workshop
 (although I expect to end up with a pronounced emphasis on the
 new Imperium Games/FarFuture release). Rather than having
 "issues" like other \'zines, it will be a single continuously
 updated (meaning irregularly - when I have both material and
 time) site.  The "Title page" and table of contents can be
 found by pointing a browser (preferably Netscape or Internet
 Explorer - table capability is sort of required, so I don\'t
 think Lynx can handle it) to
 http://www.dragonfire.net/~FreelanceTraveller/ - everything
 will be a link off this page.  Do please consider writing for
 us, too; we have submissions guidelines available. I\'m hoping
 to have a chance this weekend to update them; it looks very
 much like I can now take submissions via ftp, which means that
 part of what we publish can be game assist software.

Brovo, Boyd!  Nice job on the metaphore.  

I guess the goal for IG should be to produce a version of Traveller that 
is palatable to the majority of Traveller players (and prospective 
Traveller players - aye, there\'s the tricky part), rather than pandering 
to any of us here online.  

I hear some of you gasping at this blasphemy, but you have to admit that 
we\'re a pretty small part of the /current/ Traveller market - let alone 
the /future/ Traveller market (if it gets the success it deserves).  

I\'ve liked Marc Miller\'s vision of Traveller from the first time I 
encountered CT.  I\'m willing to give up my own personal vision of 
Traveller as far as IG-published product goes, in favor of his vision.  

After all, I can meld T4 to whatever I desire in a game.  This won\'t be 
true for the massive amount of new converts Traveller needs in order to 
survive.  I think Marc and IG have the right idea of what to provide for 
new gamers - that is, once the bugs are worked out (and the necessary 
supplementary material is on the shelves of game stores).

Good points.  But I think the most important point you raised was...

this.  Individual refs will have far more knowledge of the setting than 
players will.  And you have to admit that many players will have access 
to the published material.  It\'s best to put what players would know in 
pubished materials - and leave the rest for individual referees to 
determine for their own games.  Then, the referees can decide how much of 
that information is known to players, the ISS, the Imperial goverment, 
etc. 

While those of us who are more experienced can easily change the "canon" 
to suit our own visions, those who are less experienced will be relying 
on published materials more.  So, by acknowledging that everything which 
is published will be known to many players, and by therefore requiring 
GM\'s to create their own "unknown" aspects of the setting, IG has 
provided a solution to the problem.  IG provides the foundation - 
referees provide the building.

Here, you raise the most important point.  It\'s a difficult one to 
swallow, but: This is Marc Miller\'s game.  However he wants to make it is 
how it should be made.

"But what about listening to customers?!"  When is the last time a 
novelist asked for feedback from his readership while in the process of 
crafting a new novel?  I think creating games is far more of a creative 
process - like writing a novel - than it is like producing other products.

It was nice of Marc and IG to allow us an opportunity to give them 
feedback on some ideas - and it was great that they took some of our 
suggestions to heart - but in reality, they\'re under no onus to do that.
They are free to make the products however they want to, and we\'re free 
to buy them or refrain from doing so.  But there\'s no reasonable basis 
for saying that they\'re obligated to do what we want - or even that they 
would be better off doing so.  So, getting self-ritous about our favorite 
aspects of Traveller being dropped and/or changed is just plain silly.

For better or worse, there are more ways to make money from Traveller 
than by pandering to us hard-core fanatics. ;)  

Since realizing all of this, I\'ve resolved not to be overly critical of 
what IG puts out there.  I\'m going to try to examine it in the light of 
what would be best for their stated goal: reaching a new audience 
(presumably without changing Traveller so much that it bears no relation 
to its original incarnation).

That\'s what I\'m counting on.  :)

David, thanks for the input.  One quick problem with your suggestion, 
although it is easy to fix, is the 8+ attack throw from CT/Animals 
supplement.  T4 is a \'roll low\' system.  Since you are having this same 
problem with the animal attack throws, I suggest inverting this.  Instead 
of 8+, use 6-.

TNE, if you don\'t have it, used the following table to determine hit 
numbers:

	Animal Type		D6
	Herbivore		2
	Scavenger		2
	Omnivore		2
	Carnivore		3

I was hoping to see something like this in T4.  I guess I\'ll have to 
convert the TNE system to T4.

"Ah, Zathras\' work is never done, and neither is the GM\'s."

Thanks again, David.

The stock that was sold off consisted of GDW products only. GDW had no
major quantities of DGP material. indeed, we had none whatsoever,
aside of what was in the company reference library and in the
reference copies of the individual designers (DGP would usually send
us a dozen or so copies of each product, and Marc passed them around,
keeping a few for his own reference.

\'Fraid not. Frank has reference copies (I think), but he doesn\'t have
 cartons of DGP stuff sitting in his living room (neither do I or
Marc, for that matter).

I\'ll have to admit I never saw myself as part of a "regime." I hope
that nothing pejoritive is intended by the term?


>Dave Nilsen was under the impression that GDW owned the rights

Actually, it was Dave\'s impression and mine that GDW had the right
to freely reference and use any DGP copyrighted materials in GDW
products...not that GDW owned the copyrights. At least that was the
case the last time we discussed the matter...Ghod, seems like so long
ago.

Traveler 2300 and the later D20 GDW House system (as used in Twilight:
2000 and TNE) were different kettles of fish. IIRC, under the house system,
a single aimed shot to the head from a 9mm/.38 pistol had a 30% chance of
killing the average character.

A lot of places use production molds are that are vulcanized, and
these tend to be more rugged, but the same holds true of them:
they eventually wear out, and must be replaced. As a side note,
GDW looked into acquiring miniatures production facilities once, and
found the insurance demands were gigantic. Something about spinning
molten metal makes insurance companies nervous...

When I first read _The Killer Angels_ (_excellent_ novel set during
Gettysburg, for those who haven\'t seen it) back in the late 70s, I noticed a few really
several glaring errors (one of them included spelling THEIR as THIER). When
Turner did the book as the movie Gettysburg a couple of years ago, I
bought the reprint tie-in and noticed the _same errors,_ twenty years
later. It always made me feel better that Ballentine books had
similar problems to GDW.

I sent that one in to Pyramid when Scott H. asked if I had any

Yep, I just found it at half-price book store for $4.98  I\'m glad they mixed

local half-price bookstore for 48 cents!  (It has a label on the back "Best 
Role-Playing Adventure for 1979 H.G. Wells Award" -- F.Y.I)

Here is what it says about the first flight: 

"...The Kinunir class is named for the first vessel of its type to fly.  
Although both the Shulgi and Zaggisi were laid down before Kinunir, General 
Products rushed their ship to completion, recording flight three days before 
their competitors..."

A table shows that the Kinunir was laid down 127-1074 and the first flight 
240-1077.
The last ship in the production run was the Adda-Dubsar which was laid down 
292-1087 but never flown.  It was scrapped "208-1089 after a Navy decision to 
discontinue production..."

The adventure repeatedly makes mention of the "ill-fated" Kinunir, of the 
first 24 that were authorized for production, only 20 were made.  Apparantly, 
there were so many problems, production was halted, and General Products 
ceased building military ships entirely.  (I think somebody mentioned that the 
Kinunir went back into production later, but that\'s bad spaghetti as far as 
I\'m concerned.)

So the Kinunir class battle cruiser doesn\'t fly until 1077 years in the future 
(referring to the original discussion).

I cite as my authority the novel _To Dream of Chaos_; the Solee had a number

I think that much of the problem arises from several factors:

- ---- The tendency of role-playing gamers to have an affinity for *wierdness* in 
general, I mean, I wouldn\'t want some of you guys to come into my house... 
;-)>  
(Of course if I was a daddy, I wouldn\'t want my children to have friends like 
I was at certain times in my life...)  :-)>   Anyway, as representatives of 
gaming, their appearance tends to define the activity to the uninitiated.  You 
must admit, if the vast majority of RPG\'ers were straight-A students, had 
respectible jobs, wore Cardigan sweaters, etc.  Public opinion would be 
different.  When I was a young\'n, I got lousy grades and spent all my time 
playing D&D, Gamma World, Traveller, etc.  I know if there were no such things 
as RPGs, I would\'ve spent my time doing something else (still having bad 
grades) but that philosophy gets lost on people sometimes.
- ---- The association of RPG\'s with the occult within the Christian community.  
I don\'t mean merely "Occult-theme" RPG\'s but several Christian authors 
published some scary books linking some very early RPG\'s with the occult, 
ritual abuse, drug abuse, etc.  I would suppose that there are very few 
role-players who haven\'t had some experience with "pop-occult" (for lack of a 
better term) at some point in their lives (not to mention drugs).  I have 
(pop-occult, not drugs); but I probably would have anyway, in spite of RPG\'s, 
since most youngsters get curious about such stuff.  The folks who are 
concerned about such things seem to NEED a focus to vent their concern, so 
picketing a bookstore or game store is what they try to do.  "Mostly Harmless"
(Rabbit-Chasing Addendum:  I don\'t want to provide an opportunity to to rag on 
"fundamentalists" and their anti-occult activities, my previous church had a 
break-in where some local kids scrawled a few occult symbols on the podium.  
Nothing that couldn\'t be helped with a little soap and hot water, but the 
point being that the folks picketing the store do perceive a problem.  I say 
that you *should* tell people that you play RPGs, show them that the image 
they have is different from reality.  My previous church had a saying: "The 
church has always persecuted two groups of people: those who don\'t believe, 
and those who really do..."  In other words: not all fundamentalists are 
Christians and not all Christians are fundamentalists.  \'Nuff said about 
that.)

I had some other things in mind, but I forgot them while chasing that pesky 
rabbit...  Maybe they\'ll come back to me later in the thread.

To sum it all up:  The problem has two areas of responsibility: 
1) is the irresponsibility of the American church culture in general of 
handling what they perceive as a social or moral problem.  I can tell you that 
they are aware of their responsibility or lack thereof and are working on that 
to varying degrees.  The church where my wife and I attend is the most 
fascinating place:  We have lots of older folks wearing conservative clothes 
and another group of younger conservatively dressed folks, but what is really 
neat is the scattered groups of kids with blue hair, mohawks (and other 
unusual cuts), body piercing, etc.  I must say that the feeling of acceptance 
for people (like me who hide their differences on the inside) is enhanced 
because of the way those folks are accepted.  At any rate, there is nothing we 
can do as gamers to change this.
2) What we can do is to counter effects the irresponsibility of Role-Playing 
Gamers in general by our conduct and behavior, by the quality of our games, by 
inviting others to play.  Anyone who has spent any time lurking on this 
mailing list will know how devisive we can be (CT vs MT vs TNE).  I remember 
standing in a gaming store a few years ago listening to a guy talk about his 
D&D character: the guy was grossly overweight, looked to be in his 30\'s, and 
he was ranting about his nth level, multi-classed, character to a couple of 
high-school kids.  It was pitiful!  I mean, the guy should at least faked not 
being a loser!  
Rich Ostero has the right idea when telling folks about all his kewl (and 
socially acceptable) hobbies, but I think that he should include role-playing 
to the mix so folks would associate RPG\'s with "normalcy" 
(no offense intended by the "normalcy" comment, Rich)  ;-)>

My hats off to those of you who catch my drift and are doing so already!

Yup, public opinion would be different...and I might not be a 
role-player.  If it was something for "the polo set," I would have 
probably been disgusted with the whole idea.  I try not to associate 
myself with that sort of people.

What you say is true.  In T4\'s case, the occult stuff still come in there 
(psionics), plus it alludes to evolutionistic beliefs.  Two strikes 
against it for many religious people.

I wasn\'t there, but my reaction is, "so what?"  He\'s in his 30\'s....does 
that make him a "loser?"  He\'s overweight...does that make him a 
"loser?"  Talking at length on any subject to a disinterested audience 
is socially unacceptable, but do you know those kids weren\'t interested 
in his nth level, multi-classed character?

enjoy computers, and read sci fi, than associate myself with those who 
concern themselves with "proper" hobby activities. :)

At least some of the time, we had male players with female characters, and
female players with male characters.  Not a big deal.  Personally, I play
either, and create characters based more on what _kind_ of character I
want, rather than always having to play a male, or a female, or a human
or a vargr or anything else.

What gets _really_ strange is when you start to mix Aslan into the whole
thing.  You see, Aslan divide their society along gender lines: pilots,
warriors, gunners, and similar positions are male (only).  Navigators,
business executives, engineers, and so on are female (only).

Of course, when talking to humans, Aslan tend to ignore various biological
features that humans consider obvious, and attribute gender roles to humans
based on their jobs (conversely, Aslan will tend to assume that anyone only
has skills appropriate to their gender - and wouldn\'t hire a female pilot,
or a male engineer)

One interesting campaign had a (male) player handing a (female) Aslan.  No
choice - he wanted the character to be the owner of a Mercenary company, and
only females can be business-owners.  Of course, her (the character\'s)
brother was the commander of the mercenaries, because only males can serve
in combat positions.

I guess I opened myself up for that one.  Sorry.  I think what I was trying to 
convey was the fact that folks get an idea about things in general, and then 
project their generalizations on everyone else associated with it.  The scene 
I described only proved how judgemental I myself can be.  I abase myself.

First, it\'s got a great start-up-- the Travellers (I always refer to groups
of Traveller PCs as that) are hanging around in the saceport bar on a 
god-forsaken backwater world that seems completely uninteresting when an
intelligent Chirper (their first mention, IIRC) comes in and pleads for
someone, ANYONE, to help:  it\'s siblings have been captured by evil humans
and are going to be vivisected; but as payment he can only offer a few gold 
coins (which later turn out to be the famous Droyne coyns)...
   From there, the course of the adventture is comletely up to the ref and
the players.  There\'s a big chart o\' rumors, which can be used as
side-adventures, red herrings, background color, or hints towards the "main"
plot of the adventure (ie rescuing the Chirpers).  There\'s info and a map 
of the planet, which is pretty low TL, lightly populated, mostly water, and
(at least according to the rumors) populated by naval pirates.  They also
give information about Submarines.  Most of the book-space is taken up giving
a detailed room-by-room description of the Imperial Reserach Station, and 
if the PCs investigate closely enough (and watch out for the Robots) they 
can piece together that the station\'s engaged in Psionics research, along
with various enigmas about the Chirpers, the coyns, and, it seems like, some
oblique references to the Ancients themselves.  The book finishes up with
some rules for operating the Robots, descriptions of the other weird 
creatures held in the Station\'s pens, a description of the scientist who
runs the station (who, IIRC, was somewhat mentally unstable), and a bunch of
Library Data.
   With all that info, it\'s really just a test of player and ref ingenuity to 
see what you can do with it.  You can emphasize the Enigma, exploration of
the world and/or the station, roleplaying, combat with naval pirates, with
robots, with strange critters, or with mad scientists, the ethicality of
the Imperium conducting inhumane experiments in secret, the possible legal
ramifications of the PCs breaking into an Imperial Research Station, and
probably more possibilities I haven\'t thought of.  There\'s no fixed plot or
storyline, so it doesn\'t matter if the players do something clever to
sidestep what\'s expected.
   Anyway, if the ref\'s willing to put in the effort (although I think it\'s
fun effort, rather than tedious number-crunching) of molding all this raw
material into something coherent, I think this adventure\'s really good and
representative of the kind of things that I like best in Traveller (enigmas,
exploration, ethical questions, and negotiations, rather than military
actions or standard Trading).
   There, I think I\'ve said enough of why I like this adventure (even though
I don\'t think it\'s good as a tournament/con scenario).

to get leveled against Traveller pretty often but I, for one, see nothing
wrong with it.  For one thing, Adventure 12 wasn\'t released until 4-5 years
after the Enigma of the Ancients was first presented (in Adv 2-3), so it\'s 
not like they didn\'t give players a chance to wonder.  I\'m of the opinion 
that if they\'re going to throw out an Enigma, that it\'s better to get a 
resolution eventually (even if it\'s not quite what you would have wanted it
to be-- you can always ignore it) than to just leave it hanging forever.  
Sure, knowing that something\'s going to remain perpetually unresolved can
spur the individual GMs on to create their own solutions, but more likely 
(at least in my case) it will cause the ref to disregard it as something 
which obviously can\'t be TOO important or interesting if they\'re not going
to develop it any further.
    And lastly, who says that your players should be curious about the 
Ancients after Adventure 12?  If they bought it themselves and read it, then
they\'ve robbed themselves of the fun of discovery and deserve what they got,
if they actually played through the scenariuo then they should feel a sense
of accomplishment at having resolved this great Enigma and allow themselves 
to go on to other adventures.  The Traveller universe is big and diverse 
enough that no single mystery being revealed (even a really big one) is going
to kill off the game\'s creative potential-- sure, the mystery of the Ancients
was a compelling part of early Traveller, but except for very oblique
Library Data-type references, it really only took up a small part of the
published material; the vast majority of the adventures (and all of the
Solomani Rim ones) being completely unconcerned with who the Ancients really
were.
    Sorry for ranting into thin air, but it just bothers me when people act
like one of the things I value most in Traveller (a search for knowledge that
has eventual tangible results) is some sort of flaw or mistake.

     From what I\'ve read, it seems that the only people who are really bent
out of shape about the errors in T4 are new would-be refs who aren\'t sure
what judgment calls to make due to lack of complimentary knowledge (which is
regrettable, but should be alleviated both by the appearance of new 
supplements and future (error-free) printings of the rules-- therefore 
making this only a temporary problem) and USENET loudmouths, with whom there
can be no peaceful agreements.  
     Plus, if you look closely, a lot of the complaints (beyond a purely
technical and petty level-- typos, the missing tables, etc) seem to really
be matters of taste and personal preference (I don\'t like the character
generation system, therefore it\'s BAD, therefore the game\'s BAD).  I, for
instance, love the new char-gen system and have used it to generate several
really fun personality-filled sample PCs, but that doesn\'t mean that I think
it\'s the One True Char-gen system and that all others suck.  Unfortunately,
some folks don\'t seem to be able to make such distinctions, and they seem to
be statistically over-represented in USENET posters.

Heh.  No need to abase yourself. :P

Seriously, your point that people generalize is, of course, true.  Our 
reaction to that is what differs: I don\'t particularly care what random 
people think of me.  I only care what my friends and family think of me - 
and people who know me don\'t suddenly think I\'m a geek or an occultist 
simply because I play RPGs.

By the way, I don\'t know whether you read the independent role-playing 
magazine Shadis, but this month\'s "The Edge" editorial was along the lines 
of what you were saying in your original post.  The author began by 
saying that gamers tend to be seen as, "unwashed, lacking in social 
skills, obsessed to the point of mania with the games."  However, the 
editorial ended up being about competition - healthy competition vs. 
unhealthy competition, specifically.  

I can agree with the author\'s stance on that.  I\'d like to see all 
gamers being paragons of good behavior as well, in that respect.  
(Although, the author gave an anecdote from Gen-Con of a"twelve-year-old 
on a crying jag because someone twice his age felt the need to utterly 
crush him during a Magic tournament."  But this brings up a question of 
whether 12-year-olds should be playing in the same tournament as adults 
- - are the adults to purposefully lose so the little guys don\'t cry?)  
There\'s no reason to be "in your face" about this stuff.  They\'re just 
games, after all.  

So, as long as gamers aren\'t obnoxious in such ways (having their 
character kill the other PCs, gloating over "winning" a RPG at the 
expense of other players\' enjoyment, etc.), I don\'t have a problem with 
the other "socially unacceptable" aspects.  Like a militant, pro-minority 
friend of mine said about negative views of blacks, "That\'s _they\'re_ 
(white people\'s) problem."  If you\'re overweight, over 30, and eat bad 
spaghetti, I\'ll gladly share a game with you. :)

I guess this is my day to bitch and moan. :)

This choreographed approach bugs me.  While I\'m not one for using 
pre-packaged adventures much, I\'m more likely to use one that is crafted 
along the lines of the old, CT-era adventures than those that are 
currently produced.  I hope IG and the licensees will be using the 
correct approach for the adventures they produce.

Perhaps interestingly, GDW used both approaches, as you may already 
know.  The Annic Nova remains a mystery to this day, as far as published 
material goes (and as far as what Marc Miller has said about it - he was 
asked here and at the Gen-Con seminar, and both times he replied that he 
didn\'t know, because he never planned to provide a solution to that 
mystery - it\'s up to individual referees to do that, if they wish).

UseNET is a wonderful and frightening thing, isn\'t it?  On the one hand, 
I was able to find a core group of enthusiasts of the Atari 8-bit 
computer on there, and share a lot of great discussions with them (as 
well as trade some home-brewed software that we each made).  Where else 
but an international forum could I find dozens of people who use such 
an out-dated computer platform?

On the other hand, as you point out, that same forum gives considerable 
power to every crackpot, con artist, and loudmouth that comes along.  
Whereas in the past such people were pretty limited in the number of 
people they could poison with their words, they now have an almost ideal 
forum from which to wreak their havoc.

As usual, technology has provided a two-edged sword.

So, what should be done about it?  I actually think IG has done pretty 
well in dealing with it.  While that first message by Ken just fed the 
fire (although it was right-on from the perspective of being true - 
it just wasn\'t good PR), his damage-control follow-up seems to have enraged 
only the lunatic fringe.  Those people aren\'t going to be reached 
anyway, no matter what is done.  (At least, that has been my experience.  I 
ran a successful BBS for many years, and there were always those who 
would criticize my board, no matter what I did.  I finally gave up on 
trying to please them.  Some of those people went away, some stuck 
around.  But overall, it didn\'t affect the viability of my BBS one whit.)

My advice to IG:  Prove them wrong by your actions.  If they say your 
game "sucks" or that your company "never returns phone calls," prove them 
wrong by selling lots o\' product and by giving those who do call a really 
good experience (like you\'ve done in the past, as many of us can attest).  

While the nuts bitch and moan, we\'ll be talking about our good 
experiences with IG.  Most people, given the choice between believing 
someone who is ranting and someone who is being reasonable, will believe 
the reasonable person (I learned this in a customer relations course I 
took at college, by the way.  When dealing with irate customers, remain 
calm and reasonable - especially if it is a public setting, like in a 
store on or Usenet.  Bystanders will tend to look favorably on you for 
remaining calm and collected.  As a corollary, if you\'re doing the 
complaining, remain calm: not only will bystanders view you as a good 
person, the person to whom you are complaining will be far more likely to 
rectify the situation than if you yell and scream).

That\'s right.  And, as I said, IG simply isn\'t going to win those people 
over - may as well ignore them and get on with the job of selling massive 
quantity of high-quality product. :)

I just read a message on UseNET that claimed the T4 chargen system was 
just like the one in MT.  Is this true?  It\'s been so long since I owned 
MT, I can\'t recall.

Sadly, true.

Subject: T4 Combat

Much has been discussed about to-hit possibilities under T4 rules, but
what about lethality?  I understand that T4 is using CT\'s wound rules, 
but I\'ll blaspheme and say that GDW\'s T2k-based "house system" handled 
this better.  If CT/T4 combat represented the real world, war would be a 
rather like paintball games, as the lethality is _way_ too low.  >>

Exqueeze me? I always found it to be exactly the opposite: with T2k/TNE 
PCs were virtually indestructible, whereas when I was running CT/MT I 
had to fudge a lot to keep them alive.

<< The problem resides in the near-impossibility of a one-shot kill w/o 
using called shots.  A black-powder pistol is given a rating of 2.  This
generates a _maximum_ damage of 12 which _cannot_ kill Joe Average >>

But it *can* knock him out, which is as good as dead in a combat 
situation. First wound is applied to a single characteristic. Average of 
2D6 is 7. Therefore, on average, you get 1-shot KO.

<< A damage-4 shotgun is necessary to get a one-shot kill
possibility, as the damage-3 maximum (T4 p.57) prevents even a TL-15 
12cm APFSDSBSD round from killing a normal man. >>

This rule is obviously broken in extreme cases.

I think we are getting onto something interesting here. I am a Role-play 
gamer raised in a tradition of no female players. This was not a rule, 
it was just that no female would be seen dead playing RPGs with us. 
Role-playing was, and still is, largely considered anti-social in New 
Zealand. Female playesr are still quite rare.
My question is; How often would players in your games play female 
characters? >>

*Anti*-social? It\'s about as social as you can get.

Depends on the player. Some would always play males, but most tried 
female at least once. Say an average of 1 PC in 5 would be female.

That\'s sort of true. But for example, take a pair of worlds, each
moving at 80% of c *relative to each other* in opposite directions.
Count the time they passed each other as zero.

At 80% of c, time is slowed to 60% of normal. So on world A, after 100
days, they\'d see only 60 days as having passed on World B. Obvious time
is passing slower, right? But World B makes the same observation about
world A. And they are *both* right. To "settle" the question, you\'d
have to travel from one to the other, and that means changing your
speed, which puts you in a *third* reference frame. It gets real messy.

I\'ve got to find the time to work up the details, but the basic thing
is, that observers moving relative to each other see things happen at
different times, and there is no such thing as simultaneous events if
the events are in different places. Different observers will see them
happen at different times.

Nope. The fact that some life forms don\'t fit would *destroy* evolution
as a theory. Claiming they were alien would get you looked at really
strangely (much like supporters of Erik von Daniken :-). Especially if
*humans* are one of the species that don\'t fit. 

Later, when interstellar travel turns up humans on other worlds, if
someone *remembers* that old theory, it might get another look, but it
wouldn\'t happen quickly or soon.

Think how far Newton would have gotten if there had been well known
objects that *didn\'t* obey his laws of motion. He\'d still be trying to
find a way to make them fit in.

Scientific theories have to be *inclusive*. And that would be fatal to
evolution until they had hard evidence to show that there really *were*
two seperate sets of species.

I\'m fortunate, in that, here in Madison, I can do something about these
perceptions. For the last five years, I was a writer for the daily morning
newspaper, "The Wisconsin State Journal."  Twice a year (once for GenCon,
once for Christmas), I\'d get large stories on the best game releases, from
family games to RPGs. At other points, I\'d be able to fit gaming stories
and sidebars to national news items (the elections, the Gulf War, etc.)
I\'ve written  large feature articles on Historical Wargaming and ones on
Warhammer 40,000.  And the response has always been positive.

I also covered stories on muggings over Magic cards. I did it as straight
news, while a local TV station went to the local games store ("Pegasus
Games"), and started asking questions to Magic players like "do you really
believe you can cast spells with these cards?"

I quit the paper this year to pursue a freelance writing and cartooning
career, but I was there long enough to realize that most local papers and
TV stations just do not have the resources to hire experts - or even
individuals with broad enough backgrounds to make educated guesses -  in
every field. Thus, when "knee-jerk" stories like cattle mutilations (long
repudiated by publications such as the Skeptical Enquirer) or RPG/Satanism
come along, some poor schmoe is sent out with no idea what\'s going on.

(Notice how relatively few national publications pick up on such stories?
That\'s because they *have* the human  resources to realize such stories are
garbage.)

It\'s a sad, frustrating situation. I\'m sure the scientists on this list can
also attest to the equally frustrating science illiteracy rampant in local
news outlets. Ignorance, not mallevolence, is often a motivating factor in
gaming coverage by these organizations. But that\'s no excuse.

So what can we do? Gaming clubs can send press releases to TV stations and
papers when they have events scheduled. Conventions are particularly
photo-friendly. Public demonstrations are also good ideas - especially
where miniatures are concerned. Education is always the key, which is
difficult when a public does not necessarily *want* to be educated. But
getting good press isn\'t hard, when many local news organizations have a
difficult time filling their pages. Hell, getting weekly event listings is
downright easy. And remember to send photos with them. The local Historical
Gaming store frequently makes presentations in schools, to boyscout troops,
etc. The local RPG store offers "good student" discounts.

Some people will always associate rock/gaming/science/whatever with
Satanism. They\'ll never be converted. What we have to do is make sure that
reasonable people have a fair understanding of what the various facets of
the hobby are all about.

I have a little pet theory about this phenomenon. I was into gaming in the
late 70\'s when the first reports appeared of christian fundies trying to
outlaw D&D in some rural Bible-belt county. They were all riled up about
AD&D because it "promoted witchcraft and demon-worship" - specifically
through the inclusion of demons and devils in the _Moster Manual_. Demons
and Devils with names that appear in the Bible and other christian texts.
Obviously this game promotes devil worship, right?.

Except of course it\'s not the gamers but the fundies who believe in demons
and witches. Fundies honestly believe the devils and demons named in the MM
are real beings who have power to influence real events and real people.
The fundies may well believe they\'re protecting youth from a real threat of
demonic influence, but I think what really sticks in their craw is that
these supposedly real demons and devils appear in the book alongside elves,
pixies, faeries and leprechauns. In other words, the book clearly promotes
*disbelief* in these fantastic creatures. And that\'s what the Fundies
really abhor. Fantasy RPGs suggest that important elements of their
religious worldview are exactly as fictitious as faeries and pixies.

Not demonology. Blasphemy. In order to actually believe in demons you have
to be a fundamentalist christian (of a sort).

Of course, this theory tends to fall down somewhat in the face of all those
pale and serious black-clad LARPers festooned with crosses...

Jeez, what if the fundies were RIGHT?!

I\'m beginning a Traveller campaign for a group of players, one of which is
extremely interested in focussing on the "gambling" skill.  And, I need
whatever help you more experienced GMs and players can offer.

I\'ve got the article "The Gamesters of Findass II", but have not come across
any other information.  Mind you, I have not combed through everything I own,
but if someone would be so kind as to point me in the correct direction, I
(and the player) would be very grateful.

I\'m not above taking information from other game systems and translating it
into Traveller if need be, BTW.

Thanks for your time (and hoping this isn\'t a done to death question),

MT is my current Traveller system of choice, and probably will be 
until I see some more stuff produced for T4...

Since MT\'s character generation system is basically that of CT 
including Supplement 4: Citizens, and the Advanced Systems of Books 
4-7, this is for the most part incorrect...

Golly...what a shame I received it directly from the Emperor when

Let\'s see...some people think T4\'s system is too lethal, while others 
think it isn\'t lethal enough.  Hmmm.  That must mean IG got it just 
right. :)

Interesting theory, Glenn.  So, the D&D books come out, and 
Fundamentalists are upset that their beliefs are treated as fiction.  But 
they know they can\'t get the populace to rally around that particular 
issue.  Then some kids go nuts and think the world of D&D is real - which 
strangely enough vindicates the view of the Fundamentalists, vis a vis 
the reality of demons and whatnot.  Finally, the Fundamentalists seize 
this opportunity to give D&D a bad reputation, and claim that their 
problem with the game is that it promotes satanism, and they hold these 
nuts up as examples of the effect these occult powers can have on 
unrighteous mortals.

Hmmm.  It\'s just twisted enough to be true. :)

Dunno how helpful this will be, but here\'s what we use.  The rules are of 
the quick \'n\' dirty variety, but they work.



                        Gambling in the Far Future

     Gambling is a favorite pastime wherever people gather.  Trillions of 
credits are lost and won throughout the Empirium every year.  Some 
governments encourage gambling, hoping to reap the rewards of gambling by 
taxing the activity.  Others outlaw gambling to one degree or another.  
In such cases, shady organizations usually step in to provide this 
particular diversion to those who desire it.
     The purpose of this article is to provide several methods of 
resolving gambling situations in which the characters may become involved.  
The rules provided are to be used with Traveller, Imperium Games\' science 
fiction role playing game of the Far Future.
     Gambling rules for poker, dice and slots are provided.  As referee, 
you may of course choose to create additional rules for your own Traveller 
campaign.


Poker

     The rules of Poker for Traveller involve rolling five dice.  A 
player may re-roll a number of dice equal to his or her Gambling skill level.
     The order of hands, from best to worst, is 5 of a kind, straight, 
full house (two of one value, three of another), four of a kind, three of 
a kind, two pair, pair, and high roll.
     The referee should roll for the House and any NPC\'s who are playing 
against the players.


Dice

     Dice is a game that may be played anywhere there is gravity, and it 
has probably been around since the dawn of civilization.
     In the game of Dice, each player rolls 2D, and add their Gambling 
skill, if any.  The highest total score wins the "pot".  In the case of a 
tie, bets are made again and added to the existing pot for the next throw.


Slot Machines

     The slot machine is a favorite of unskilled gamblers, who suffer no 
disadvantage due to their lack of skill.  Experienced gamblers tend to 
shy away from such diversions, knowing they will have a better chance of 
winning at other games of chance.
     Slot machines accept from 1 to 25 credits per "pull", and pay off 
according to the bet made and the roll achieved.
     To simulate a slot machine, simply roll three dice, and read them as 
they fall from left to right.  In the case of two dice being at the same 
point, whichever is closer to the edge of the table is read first.  After 
reading the dice in this way, consult the following table for the 
payoff.  Any roll not listed pays nothing.
     In the table, X represents any number rolled.

     Roll      Payoff         Roll      Payoff
    6-X-X       2:1           3-3-3       8:1
    6-6-X       4:1           4-4-4      16:1
    1-1-1       2:1           5-5-5      32:1
    2-2-2       4:1           6-6-6      64:1

I can relate to this; when I was married, I had to be very careful about who gamed at my 
place. Most who did were current military members who have to maintain certain standards 
of appearance and behavior to remain in uniform. Now that I\'m single again, the 
stangeness coefficient of my gamer buds is irrelevant.

The problem is, the silent majority of gamers _are not_ strange misfits. The _visible_ 
core of the hobby is, but not the majority.

This association is the result of a very insidious and successful propaganda campaign. 
Your supposition is interesting. Prior to getting into rolegaming, I had _no_ interest 
in the pop occult. My interest today in alternative spirituality has _nothing_ to do 
with gaming at all. As for drugs -- forget \'em. Never did \'em in HS, the military or 
later.

I\'m overweight and 30-plus . . . but the absolute _last_ thing I do is brag about my 
characters in a power-tripping manner. THAT does look bad! I like to talk about my 
characters, sure . . . but I like talking about the worlds I run more, the ideas behind 
them and how things all interrelate therein. I also like talking about _other_ things -- 
sports, politics, current events, computers -- to balance the gaming I do.

I remember a little pamphlet published by Tri Tac a few years ago called "Gamers" that 
pointed out the many folibles of gamer folks. One of the cartoons showed an overweight 
guy bragging about his N+1 level D&D god/character to a kid, who promptly shot the guy, 
saying "people like him are too stupid to live."

What\'s "normal"? ;) None taken, and I\'ll have to do some thinking about this. Thanks,

This sounds like the post-GDW era version of the "Golden Cache" mentioned in the novel

Speaking as a mystic, I wouldn\'t consider it blasphemy for someone to 
disbelieve in things spiritual.  Ignorant, but not blasphemy.  The issue of 
blasphemy is in the realm of the "religious" (my use of the word "religious" 
is symantically similar to your use of the word "fundamentalist."

Heh.  No need to abase yourself. :P

Seriously, your point that people generalize is, of course, true.  Our 
reaction to that is what differs: I don\'t particularly care what random 
people think of me.  I only care what my friends and family think of me - 
and people who know me don\'t suddenly think I\'m a geek or an occultist 
simply because I play RPGs.

By the way, I don\'t know whether you read the independent role-playing 
magazine Shadis, but this month\'s "The Edge" editorial was along the lines 
of what you were saying in your original post.  The author began by 
saying that gamers tend to be seen as, "unwashed, lacking in social 
skills, obsessed to the point of mania with the games."  However, the 
editorial ended up being about competition - healthy competition vs. 
unhealthy competition, specifically.  

I can agree with the author\'s stance on that.  I\'d like to see all 
gamers being paragons of good behavior as well, in that respect.  
(Although, the author gave an anecdote from Gen-Con of a"twelve-year-old 
on a crying jag because someone twice his age felt the need to utterly 
crush him during a Magic tournament."  But this brings up a question of 
whether 12-year-olds should be playing in the same tournament as adults 
- - are the adults to purposefully lose so the little guys don\'t cry?)  
There\'s no reason to be "in your face" about this stuff.  They\'re just 
games, after all.  

So, as long as gamers aren\'t obnoxious in such ways (having their 
character kill the other PCs, gloating over "winning" a RPG at the 
expense of other players\' enjoyment, etc.), I don\'t have a problem with 
the other "socially unacceptable" aspects.  Like a militant, pro-minority 
friend of mine said about negative views of blacks, "That\'s _they\'re_ 
(white people\'s) problem."  If you\'re overweight, over 30, and eat bad 
spaghetti, I\'ll gladly share a game with you. :)

been common for long periods of time. 

Thanks to Niko. How did you get started in gaming?

I was a little disappointed that none of the New Zealander lurkers 
decloaked to comment. I can only assume that my impression of the social 
acceptance of RPGs in NZ was correct as was my conclusion about female 
participation in RPGs in NZ. 

As for playing female characters. I have done so on many occasions. My 
character turnover has always been high due to a high death rate. My 
female characters tend to be very anime and exotic much like those 
described by a fellow list member a few digests back. My most recent 
female character was in Shadowrun. Her name was Kristy Lane and was an 
Organisational Change Specialist (Corp) with a custom designed medium 
pistol called the \'Baretta Legionaire\'. I have to admit she was modelled 
somewhat from the character in the French movie \'Nikita\' or in the 
American re-make \'The Assasin\'. Kristy Lane was without doubt my 
favourite female character of all time - the others being mere shells.
