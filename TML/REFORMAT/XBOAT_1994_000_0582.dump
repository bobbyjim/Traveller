Umm..   What about undersea exploration mission, with some Earth quake in

Yeah, I liked it too.  Might use the settings in my planned Reformation
Coalition Adventure soon.  You can always change the story line a bit, so
less combat is elimenated, thus, an adventure with out combat.  It
shouldn\'t be too hard..

The combat section in TNE is large because they are trying to make a
realistic combat rules.  You can always modifie, or not even use them if
you wise.  you have the power.  :-)

No.  "Jumps are possible only along the routes printed on the map" and
     "A jump must be from a stellar hex to a stellar hex.  It may not 
      begin or end on a portion of the jump route between the ends."

No.  Same reasons.  This would make sublight travel fairly pointless.
Imperium uses a "tramline"-style hyperdrive, not the Traveller one.

Monitors actually can move to another system -- but only by sublight.
I don\'t know what the ramifications of your change are otherwise.

Yes.  "When [a tanker] moves to a tertiary system, it is immediately 
       capable of refueling friendly ships, enabling them to leave 
       the hex using hyperspace jumps."  [MOVEMENT -- Refueling]

What does this do to Motherships?  I mean, if you can carry even one
fighter unit on a B(x), then why would you build one of those nearly
defenseless motherships?  They\'re cheap, and maintenance is low, but
they\'re awfully fragile.

In my experience, the Terran player has won ONCE: when the Imperial
player didn\'t set up on the Terran\'s doorstep.  Once the terrans
had Procyon and the other junction (the double star: I don\'t 
remember the name), the game was over pretty quickly.

>Movement: Do you allow a jump into deep space? (I would think no,

No, in the 2nd edition of Imperium, it clearly prohibits this.  You
can only jump along the "green line" jump routes.

>Is a jump from deep space to a world allowed? (Maybe the same missing
>jump number argument, but what if the distance is shorter than the
>lines that connected that world?)

No, I think from a rules POV, once you\'re using sublight movement,
you have to continue using it until you get to the destination.

>We tried an extension rule, that a monitor can be transported with 4
>transports. Comments?

Since basically you\'re trying to dissassemble and then reassemble a
battleship, and  since they take a turn to replace, I wouldn\'t favor that
rule.

>Is it sufficient to have a tanker with the jumping fleet or has the
>tanker stay at the tertiary star? Or has it to be there one turn in
>advance?

We played with the rule that the tanker had to be with the fleet, but
if more than one fleet of ships were just passing through a hex that
required them, the tanker had to stay in that hex.

>We changed the rules (in IM) that all capital ship can transport
>fighter, too. So only outpost can be transported only be tranports.

Hmmm.... again, that\'s interesting, but then it eliminates the
need for REALLY expensive mother ships... it does make capital
ships more useful: I like this one :-)

You are absolutely correct.  A fix we discussed but never tried
was to make the beam weapons work at 1/2 strength at long range.
Terran Heavy Cruisers and Strike Cruisers are neat too.

Do you mean maintenace costs?  Battleships are effective
at blowing things up, but expensive to maintain.  They\'re 
just about the Terran\'s only serious advantage, too. How do you
want to modify them?

>Who declares a break off first? Attacker or defender? (I vote for

Attacker declares first.

We just let the person who had the most ships pair them up.

Yes.

It\'s useful if 1) you\'re attacking a ship with only missles
that has no missles left, 2) if you HAVE TOO take out a larger
ship.  It is a toss up.

I don\'t know about the first one: I liked the % reduction of 
ground troops in Fifth Frontier War.  This is how screening (shielding)
works:

The defender has three units, two troops and an outpost.
If the attacker has two jump troops attacking, the defender can
use his two troops to engage the two attackers.  Those four units
fight until one  side or the other is destroyed.  Even if
the attacker wins, the outpost can\'t be attacked until the 
nexty ground combat phase, because it was screened.

>Too easy...

The Terran troop is screened, and can\'t attack the outpost until
the next ground combat phase.  Theorhetically, the IMperial player
could drop Jump Troops on the planet, and change the course 
of the battle.  Since the Imperial plaer always wins space battles,
this is pretty likely ;-)

>We changed the rules that landed ships etc aren\'t destroyed but

Then I guess you can\'t use them for screening...

>Also there\'s the

No, I\'m against this one.  Ships the size of Battleships would
have to be repaired in Orbit, in my opinion.

No, but it\'s doable.  I think at it\'s heart, Imperium is a great game
with some serious balance problems...

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII


     First off: I attached two files concerning the nobility, from a
recent discussion on Usenet.  If you already saw them, consider it \'for
the record\'.  Of course, further comment is appreciated.
     From my point of view, the noble rankings in Traveller are only
the bare-bones of the Imperial nobility.  Aside from non-human/human,
rank/blood, and high/young divisions within the nobility, there is also
  -- traditionalist vs. modern (i.e. are clones legal heirs?  How about
\'geneticly perfected\' nobles, more attractive and smarter than the
commoners?) 
  -- imperial vs. regional vs. pan-racial/pan-religious nobles
  -- merchantile vs. military nobles 
  (I\'d bet good money that these issues have been discussed before, but
the old archives are still inaccessible and these questions are too
interesting)

     Secondly: I don\'t have a copy of the old MegaTraveller rules: could
someone fill me in concerning which sectors are in which domains? 

     Thirdly: There was once a game called Invasion: Earth, where the
Third Imperium faced off against the Solomani of Terra.  What I want to
know is: 1) What are the main strategic considerations of invading a
            high-tech, heavily-defended world without just nuking it?
            Should you go for the do-or-die assault on the \'hardpoints\'
            of system defence?  Or start at the poles - or the oceans - 
            and work your way in?
         2) What are the advantages/disadvantages of the invaders carrying
            fighter aircraft, rather than just using the warships for 
            orbital fire?  I understand that the fighters can carry
            a lot of very useful payload, but couldn\'t you just launch the 
            payload from near orbit, without risking the pilots on the AA
            fire (I believe it was Peurelle (spell-check) who got rid of 
            future fighters, since high-tech AA becomes just too (beep)
            accurate).
         3) How would High-population woulds configure their system defences?
            At TL 15?  At TL 12?  At TL 10? As an example, how
            is Capital/Core defended?  How would this defence contrast
            with a \'troubled, strategic\' world, like Terra/Solomani Rim?
            With the defence of a Depot?  With the defence of a minor,
            backwater world?
         4) The Third Imperium chose to create hardpoints throughout their 
            their empire; information/communication nodes called scout
            bases, military ones called naval bases, and fortress-systems
            called Depots.  Why did the Imperium choose this method -
            basically, thinly spreading warships thorughout the Imperium - to
            protect itself?  If they had chosen a \'multiple hard-shell
            route\' (i.e. the Roman frontier, the Great Wall of China), 
            there would be few assets available for regionalists to launch a
            rebellion.  Moreover, the only reason I can think of for
            spreading ships like this is A) the military is a militia (good
            enough for the colonial navies, but not so good at accounting
            for serious Imperial warships in Massillia, say) or B) Imperial
            suppression of dissidents within the Empire (rather likely,
            now that I think about it.  Of course, no hint of major
            anti-Imperial hostility is given in Classic Traveller, but GDW
            never worry\'s about continuity, do they :->)
         5) Apparently, the defense of mains (long, jump-1 routes) is
            crucial to the Imperium.  I suspect that the top/end points
            of these mains would be closely watched.  What\'s the best way
            to do so? (Incidentally, Norris successfully defended his
            Domain from Virus by massing his fleets at these chokepoints)
            I suspect that it is exactly for this purpose - and
            for defending High-pop worlds - why capital ships are built at
            all.  Why ships, and not static installations a la the Death
Star?
            After all, you can run a static hardpoint a good bit
            more cheaply than you can a mobile one.  (why dies \'bitzberg\'
            and \'Magnot Line\' keeps coming into my head? ;-) 
         4) The \'High Guard\' of the book of the same title refers to the
            convoy\'s watch over refuelling merchantmen (I never read the
            book - it\'s a guess). This principle is extendable to cover a
            host of circumstances, of course.  Am I missing anything about
            the High Guard\'s function? 

Again, I feel that these questions have been hit upon 10 times already,
but... I\'d love to know.

   It depends. :)  Most nobles don\'t rule, and most worlds have thier own
governments (but all have some sort of noble representation between them
and the Imperium).  The more important worlds will normally have Dukes and
Counts associated with them, the with most senior of the subsector\'s Dukes
being in charge of the subsector.  If my memory is accurate, the Duke of
Regina does not rule Regina (but was in charge of the subsector\'s (and
sector\'s?)) Imperial government; the Marquis Aramis, however, does rule
Aramis directly.

   There is a distinction made between honour, rank, and high nobles.
Honour nobles have gained for performing some service (military, science,
etc.); rank nobles are the less important local Imperial representatives and
administrators; high nobles are the oldest and most powerful nobles.

Hmmm, big question.  It depends on what worlds.  The Third Imperium is
a "feudal confederation".  Member worlds pay fairly minimal taxes to 
support the Imperial government and interstellar military, accepts the
jusrisdiction of the Imperial Ministry of Justice over certain "High
Laws" that the empire requires all sophonts to adhere to, and in return
get protection of trade, diplomatic arbitration with Imperial and extra-
Imperial worlds, but are otherwise allowed to control their own affairs
in-system.  Some (Archduke Dulinor comes to mind) think that the Imperium
should require world governments to behave in a democratic manner, but
in general the Moot doesn\'t agree.  

Many worlds are not ruled directly by the Imperial nobility, but have
locally chosen leaders.  Some worlds are ruled directly by the Office
of the Emperor, like Terra/Sol or Capital/Core, for various political
reasons.  Before the Rim War and martial law on Terra, it had a 
Secretary-General.  However, many other worlds are run either by 
"rank nobles" who hold positions in the Imperial bureaucracy, or by 
"high nobles" who directly oversee Imperial territories.  Some worlds 
are also ruled directly because they are Reserves, or Depots, and some
are placed under interdict and left totally alone.  But the vast majority 
of worlds are run locally.

There are far more honor nobles ("celebrities" of any stripe from a
Sir Alec Guinness to a Sir Isaac Newton to a Viscount Montgomery of 
Alamein) and rank nobles than high nobles, but no exact figures exist.

Let\'s see if I can figure out about how many high nobles we have:

Archduke (SocSt G): They run the seven multi-sector Domains.  Not 
                    counting Sylea (the emperor\'s domain), but counting
                    Norris in Deneb after 1116, there are six.
Duke     (SocSt F): Twenty senior subsector dukes are recognized as 
                    sector dukes.  There are about another 200-300 
                    subsector dukes.  (The Imperium has territory in
                    more than twenty sectors, but they don\'t all rate
                    sector dukes.)
Count    (SocSt E): At two to three worlds each, there are probably
                    four thousand Imperial counties.
Marquis  (SocSt D): At one world a piece (roughly), figure about nine
                    thousand or so.

Figure about 13200, and you have a fair guess for the *high* nobles 
above SocSt-C.  However, some will be overlap (the same person has 
*two* or more titles), some will be vacant, and some positions will 
be filled by lesser nobles that usually expected, especially on the 
frontier.  In places these nobles will be in charge locally -- in 
others, they will merely be the local Imperial authority (which isn\'t 
exactly small peanuts itself), especially in the case of rank nobles.  
In most cases, you get to choose what works for you.

If you want to find more information, your best bets are:

--> GDW
MT _Imperial Encyclopedia_   good general info, best bet
CT _Library Data N-Z_        older, but ok if you can find it
TNE _Survival Margin_        useful background info, Rebellion era

--> Digest Group
_Travellers\' Digest_ #9      Capital/Core issue
_Travellers\' Digest_ #18     "Concise History of the Imperium" article

CT == Traveller; MT == MegaTraveller; TNE == Traveller: The New Era

I\'d also recommend the Traveller Mailing List, but it\'s undergoing a 
change of moderation right now, so it\'s off-line.

Happy Travelling!

The TNE rules are basically the same as they were in MegaTraveller, and yes
it doesn\'t make sense that 10 Tons of Information have the same value as 10
Tons of grain.  They are evil and I don\'t like them.

>Yes, I know this is Xboat.  We\'re running a campaign set in 1110 using

If I understand the charters of this list, and the TML, this message, even
though refering to Book 2, and a campaign set in 1110, should have been
directed to TML, instead of Xboat.

Now the problem with the book 2 system is that the numbers of cargo types
are kinda limited.  One of my old Traveller refs had expanded the trade
charts to 
100 items instead of the 36 that were listed in Book 2.  You could take the
new charts and add a price / ton, and ton range for each item.  I am
probably going to be doing that.

That\'s not true at all.  The price of goods has always been based on a
few simple variables.  The type of world the goods are going to, the
type of world the goods were coming from, and the tech levels of each
respective world.

So, if the world that you\'re heading to is some TL14 technological
wonder, with computers coming from a TL15 world, but there is very
little agriculture, then rice coming in from a TL9 would actually be a
scarcer then the computers, thus the higher price for rice.  See, it\'s
all really simply economics, and supply and demand.

Also, in case anyone out there is wondering, a simple glance give me
the impression that the tables from MT and TNE are the same.  I could
be wrong about one or two little sections though (I didn\'t do a
thourough comparison).

 Well, it was like this. In my campaign (bits of which
have been described previously) the players were press-ganged
(kidnapping is such a nasty word) from their bucolic planet
"beyond the fringe" by a Scout. Eight of them, plus her nibs,
packed onto one scout ship. She drops them for one year basic
training. Their first assignment after graduating was to deliver
the ship, The Parshidona (any Hebrew speakers out there?) to
her some distance away.
 Well now there was only eight of them on the ship. They,
of course, ransacked the ship while onboard and discovered,
welded behind the galley, a low berth. It was functioning and
occupied. They could find no record of it in the computer (those
parts they could get at, anyway) and the data display just said
that it was functioning within normal parameters.
 Curiosity got the better of them, of course, and they
eventually opened it. They found a fairly young woman wearing
nothing but a unicorn tattoo. They tried a medical analysis but
all they could derive was that she had been in there for "more
than 7.5 years". She was recognised as being from a minor tribe,
now almost extinct, from one of the character\'s home planets
even further "beyond the fringe".
 She eventually woke and would listen attentively to them
but would not speak or otherwise try to communicate. She seemed
familiar with the ship and spent the rest of jump sifting though
boxes and collecting bits and pieces. They characters became
resigned to having yet one more person aboard...
 Well that story goes on for quite some time, however,
that is best told under another topic...

#2
 In a campaign previous to the above several "young
aristocrat" characters from the same world "beyond the fringe"
were taken to The Imperium by a trader. He suggested they take
one of the jumps in a Low Berth to relieve their tedium. Later
they worked out that they had actually spent several months
in there...

#3
 I wrote a short story once where the main character is
on an adventure with another. His memory of it seems a bit
jumbled and there are long gaps in the story line along with
bit that were temporally out of order. The mission seems to
go badly wrong and we are left with him becoming slowly
conscious. He has just been woken from "cold sleep" by automatons.
The date is much later than he remembers and he is anxious
about his business. There is a note left, though, saying to
forget about all that and not to try to remember anything that
happened while he was asleep.
 The note was in his own handwriting...
 

Boris says:
>Nop.  The problem is that you can not roleplay much
while you sleep :-)
 Unless you dream :-)
 But seriously, in another campaign in a different system
I have a technocrat pumping money into just how deeply you
can suspend someone\'s animation and still have a neural jack
work. She plans to live a long, long, time and doesn\'t want
to deal with her friends all dieing on her. She plans to "plug
them in" and let them wander cyberspace in a low consciousness
level. Sort of like "Dark Star" I suppose...


 All the above use long term suspended animation tied
in with the theme of immortality. There are several ways you
might deal with this. Say you want to use some elements of
the Imperial Collapse but not the New Era settings. The PCs
might be part of a team used by an "immortal" (either someone
with very good medical tech or a AI or a mega-corporation).
They could be woken up at strategic points during the rebellion,
and or collapse. In the end the whole organisation/secret society
might just decide to "sleep out" the Long Night.
 Was it the Golgafincharians in HHGTTG that did the same?
Alternatively you might examine a similar "Universal Soldier"
like theme in John Fords Start Trek Novel "The Final Reflection"

Briefly, in \'Arrival Vengance\', a mention of \'the sombre Imperial Anthem\'
is made.

But, has anyone have any idea on what IS the Imperial Anthem?

My private nomination for the Imperial Anthem (fit for 11,000 worlds...)
  "Nebraska" by Peter Buffett          Beautiful, but long...about 6 minutes
  "One by One" by Peter Buffett        Awsome and majestic ... but hardly
                                       \'sombre\'! Still... 
  "Agincourt Song" by William Walton   Mr. Walton wrote many movie songs
                                       reflecting the glory of the British
                                       Empire.  This one, a Latin war
                                       hymm, is a good reflection of
                                       Imperial Naval Tradition, but still  
                                       the song speaks of GLORY, not
solemity.
                                       It _IS_ short, though .. 2 1/2 min.
  "Lothlorien" by Enya                 A good match, and only 2 minutes, and
                                       at least calm.  But too many flurishes
                                       for an Anthem.  (The Anthem should
be recoginizable, even if played by a grade-school band, or a
fourth-rate backwater Tech Level 0 bunch of half-barbarians, played on
hollow rocks, who think that the Emperor is God Himself)

Modern Anthems which seem to make the cut...
  "The \'Internationalle\'"              the old U.S.S.R. Anthem.  Sounds
                                       fine to me, and is \'somber\' enough,
                                       if a bit imnposing.  
  Malta\'s Anthem                       Quite nice; if I remember correctly,
                                       it has a good, \'classical\' sound.
  Bulgaria                             A good, solid, Middle Europe anthem.
                                       It even has some character.

But, my final choice for the "Imperial Anthem" IS .......
  
  Japan!       Their anthem is short, graceful, solemn, and it\'s age would
               satisfy the Vilani members of the Imperium. (The anthem is
               at LEAST 2000 years old) 

Incidentally, is there any \'theme song\' you would give to Traveller, the
game?( Off the top of my head, I\'d give "One by One" to Classic Traveller, 
"We Didn\'t Start the Fire" to MegaTraveller, and that sad song in "Platoon"
(Adagio in C?) to the New Era.)

Actually, why nuke it?  It\'s cheaper and more effective to just nudge a
few asteroids into a carefully calculated course intersecting with the
world (and with the ocean, if you can manage).  Lucifer\'s Hammer, by
Larry Niven, does a good job of describing this, although he talks about
a large comet.   The advantage of this is that you still have a habitable
world after it\'s all over.

The besieged planet\'s defense against the asteroids will be to fire up
missiles or spacecraft to nudge the rocks so that they miss the planet.
Fighters and other spacecraft will be needed to attack the planet\'s 
defensive forces to ensure that the rocks are not diverted.

Your point about fighters being obsolete due to the accuracy of AA doesn\'t
work though.  Assume that there are two types of AA:  solid projectiles 
(missiles, mostly) and energy beams (lasers, mostly).  The solid projectiles
need time to travel from launch point to the fighter.  No matter how 
accurate the projectile, the fighter will see it coming and be able to do
something about it.  Energy beams, though, are a different matter. The 
fighter will not have warning about a targeted beam.  Unfortunately, the
cost of these weapons favours the use of missiles.  Thus, the effectiveness
of fighters has been reduced because of AA but not eliminated.

High pop worlds at TL 13+ should consider placing a few spinal mount-type
guns on their surface and on their satellites.  A system navy would help 
as well but having large particle accelerator cannons and meson guns sure
would help against the asteroid-bombing scheme.

   Nukes are more precise, though easier to defend against.  They don\'t
make a world any more uninhabitable than an asteroid strike or two (the
mess an asteroid would make of weather patterns, and the sheer number of
dead laying about, would leave the world less habitable in the short term).
The main effect, however, of using such weapons is to piss off your
opponent.  It won\'t make attacking the planet a lot easier in the short
term - it\'s mostly civilians dying, in the billions.  After a while of
this, there won\'t be a lot of opposition left.  If your opponent was
limited to just that planet, that will probably be the end of it; if it was
an interstellar state, you\'ve just taken the gloves off.

    'index' => 'aa020',

    'topic' => 'Boring Review: Look-over of Classic Rules',
    'body' => '
Last night, I was looking over the Classic books 0 to 3, and the Intro
adventure "The Imperial Fringe", just to re-familiarize myself with the
heritage of Traveller.  (I typically play using TNE rules)

Brief observations below...
  1) "The Imperial Fringe"
      As was previously mentioned, the first mission - to survey all 440
worlds in the Spinward Marches - is a whopper!  If you spend two weeks at
each system, you\'d finish just in time for the Rebellion at 1116!
      However, it\'s a great way to earn a living ... that\'s 50,000 Credits
per system, and an extra 10,000 credits after all systems have been
surveyed ... a grand total of 26,400,000 Credits.  Almost enough to buy
the Aurora, at 29.43 MCr.  

      Looking at the library data, I note that the First Imperium was
founded at 476 AD ... just as Rome fell.  And that the Vilani invented
jump drives at 4715 BC.   Also, the First and Third Imperiums both lasted
about 1100 - 1200 years.

   2) Book 0: An Introduction to Traveller
      The dullest book in the lot ... if your already familiar with
role-playing.  Still, it should be read once a year, just to remind
yourself of the basic tools of role-playing.

   3) Book 1: Characters and Combat
      Does anyone know who "Mary Beth" is? (The book is dedicated to her)
      
      Hey! Everyone is assummed to be in the military services! (Or a
scout).  I like the 8+ basic throw for combat.  Then again, I feel that the
loose, free-flowing nature of Classic Traveller is it\'s greatest strength.  A
short selections of useful tools and vechiles and off you go!

      However, that\'s _not_ why I like Traveller today.  I hardly ever
play the game as role-play.  Instead, I just build things...and more
things...and more things.  I like Traveller (TNE) due to the tools it
gives me as a designer, not as a role-playing enviroment.  I suspect that
this change of viewpoint is prevalent in GDW, too.  

   4) Book 2: Starships

      "The Low Lottery: It is customary for the captain to contribute Cr10
out of each low passage towards a lottery.  Each low passenger randomly
guesses the number of low passengers who will survive the trip. If the
winner does not himself survive, the captain recieves the money.  The
ship\'s steward administers the lottery."  NO COMMENT.

      Hey, I actually LIKE the old \'Jump drive A, Manuver Drive A, Power
Plant A\' format.  This reminds me of a \'soapbox opinion\' I have: Traveller
should have two levels of complexity, the \'Quick and Dirty\' and the \'Slow
and Accurate\'.  Okay, off the soapbox.

      An interesting stress on \'computer programs\', and _the volume they
take up_ (Hard disk space?)  I know that this factor of Classic traveller
was not followed up, but it has potential still...

      I like the education rule..."you can increase your education rank up
to your intelligence level".  _This_ is going into my campaign, and
perhaps a limit that "education may not be higher than intelligence" in
caracter generation.

      In the Trade section, I\'ll only note that the base price of grain is
Cr 300, and for radioactives it\'s 1,000,000.   Compare this with Mega of
TNE formats, where they are equal. ( I spent Friday night designing a sane
trade pricing table for myself).
      
   5) Book 3: Worlds and Adventures
     
      Basic world design.  Standard equipment profile, but...what\'s this? 
Food and Overhead?  Bloody awsome! (Reminds me of the lack of washrooms on
the Enterprise, for some reason...)  More things to be directly copied
into my campaign...  Also, I\'d like to note the steamships, motor boats,
and a submersible (Why aren\'t these things in TNE?)

      And, of course, pisonics.  (Ugh.)

 
Summary: Classic Traveller is a good set of rules for role-playing, rather
         than world building/equuipment designing.

[pragmatic, but valid, reasons why neither, deleted]

Or, worse still, put a ship which is primarily a large mass of rock
on a very high relative vector to the world but *in another system*,
and then jump it in at the 100-diameter limit of the target.  Even
small ships can pack a gigaton-class punch at impact, and the world
would only have a turn or less to react.  Precision may not be very
terrific, but it doesn\'t need to be if you\'re using this tactic.
There are even methods you could use to give the thing some guidance
and possibly even eject and save the expensive jump drive.

However, this sort of tactic doesn\'t look that common in Imperial
warfare unti the Rebellion-era, when the gloves came off because
the emperor at Capital didn\'t quite get why this was so *stupid*.
Among other reasons, with the technology the Imperial worlds had,
this sort of attack may kill a lot of people, and still leave the
defensive systems in place unless you are willing to scourge the
entire planet.  "Destroying the enemy is not the acme of skill;
capturing the enemy is the acme of skill."  And at Terra, the 
Imperials had to be *very* careful not to damage the planet too
much, for political reasons.  (Luckily, the Solomani Confederation
felt the same way.)  Of course, this is a game.  In RL, I shudder
to think of the carnage possible.

 Well, if Lucifer\'s Hammer (and other works) and that comet that
slammed Jupiter recently were any guide, I doubt very seriously that you
would still have "a habitable world after it\'s all over".  Unless "it\'s
all over" refers to several hundred to several thousand years after the
impact.

 I also would suggest that (depending on the Rules Set under
consideration) it would be relatively easy for the defenders to
obliterate your incoming asteroid.  This, of course, depends on the
correlation of forces in the system...
 And, it might do to keep in mind that if you can do unto HIS world,
he can do unto YOUR world...

 A silly point.  If missiles are not especially effective as
anti-fighter weapons, then they will not be used.  After all ONE really
good AA weapon is much better than twelve nearly useless AA weapons...
 Again, the Rules Set in question has a lot to do with the usefulness
of any given weapon against any given target...

 <snicker>  Why bother with "a few spinal mount-type guns"?  Let\'s
put several hundred of them.  Or perhaps several thousand.  Plus a few
hundred thousand sensor arrays scattered over the surface.  Plus around
50,000 bay-mount missile launchers.  Plus anywhere from several dozen
BIG SDBs to several thousand medium size SDBs to several tens of
thousands of fighters (50-90T range)...Or some combination.

 Capital/Core has eight or ten deep meson guns inside the Imperial
Palace alone.  Probably several thousand scattered throughout the
planet, plus similar numbers deployed in every gas giant in the
system...

 Terra has no planetary defenses to speak of, of course.  Primarily
to make it vulnerable to the Imperial Fleet.  Sure that means that the
Solomani can take it away from the Impies easily, but it also means that
the Impies can take it back easily when the time comes...

 And "minor, backwater worlds" have no significant planetary
defenses, and no way to stop even "chicken thieves" like most Vargr
Corsair bands from doing/taking whatever they want to...

 Pretty clever idea really, if you like destroying worlds.  ONe minor
problem with it, though.   Ships DO misjump now and then.  It might be
intensely embarrassing if such a weapon misjumped to one of YOUR major
worlds, wouldn\'t it?  Is the effect (impressive, but remember that the
other guy may do unto you also) worth the (admittedly minor) risk that
you might blow up your own world (and make yourself look like one of the
Galaxy\'s biggest fools at the same time)? ;-)

    'body' => 'Alvin Plummer asks about Invasion: Earth and, more generally, about
invading a high-tech high-pop world and, even more broadly, about Imperial
defense strategy.  I don\'t really have answers, just more questions, but I
hope that they\'ll be helpful ones.  I won\'t address all of Mr. Plummer\'s
issues here, but they\'re all important and worth discussing.  I, too, need
to pay a visit to the ftp site.

1) Main strategic considerations in attacking a hi-t hi-p world:
I suppose that the _strategic_ considerations are "why is this world
important to my plans for expansion, defense, or whatever?"  "what
advantages inure to invading this world? what costs?" "do I need to take
over this world\'s production and divert it to my own empire (or whatever you
call your state)? or is it better (cost-effective, maybe) to bomb it into
environmental collapse?"

_Tactical_ considerations would then be driven by strategy and available
technology (and culture, I suppose, but culture is also a factor driving
strategy).  If nuking them \'til they glow (or throwing rocks at them, a la
Moon is a Harsh Mistress or Lucifer\'s Hammer) is all you need to do, maybe
you don\'t have to worry about troops at all (except commandos to knock out
deep meson gun sites).

Invasion: Earth\'s premise was that the Earth should be occupied.  I always
tried to minimize destruction, but I\'m not sure that that\'s a game effect
(yes, I could just pull it off the shelf, I suppose).  The tactics that I
used as an invader were to bombard any troop and SDB concentrations, which
leads to scattering of defense forces.  I would land troops to surround
isolated units and destroy them, then extract my troops.  I never tried to
take anything except, after sufficient attrition, urban hexes which gave
victory points.  Terrain effects are virtually nil:  The only restriction is
that you can\'t end a movement phase on ocean.  At least that\'s the only one
that made any difference.  So there was no taking the poles or whatever and
working in.  The invader just hits and runs, and the defender eventually
runs out of resources to resupply and rebuild units.  I think that there was
a time limit operating against the Imperium in the game, which is necessary
for balance.  If the besieging force has the time and is strong enough to
defeat the space defense forces, it will always wear the ground-based forces
down eventually.

I\'d like very much to hear the stories of other veterans of this campaign of
the Solomani Rim War.

4) Why did the Third Imperium choose a hard-point based defense?
I think Mr. Plummer\'s ideas are right on.

     A) The Imperium relies on a militia.  This is implicit in the game
Fifth Frontier War, with its multitudes of colonial ground and naval forces.
(See also the discussion in Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium at
5-7.)

    B) Imperial suppression of internal dissidents required significant
naval and military forces to be distributed throughout the Imperium.  This
seems to be implicit in much published material (I disagree with Mr.
Plummer\'s comment that there is "no hint of major anti-Imperial hostility
.. given in Classic Traveller").  For example, who were the Ine Givar?  How
numerous were they?  They took over much of one of the continents on Efate,
and the Imperium sent a huge military force to deal with it.  This happened
just before the 5FW.  There is at least one AZ dealing with Ine Givar
activity in the Spinward Marches (Rule of Man Commemorative, I think).  Were
the Tanoosians anti-Imperial?  To the extent that the Imperium supported teh
the status quo and allowed Vilis to occupy Tanoose (and call it
Garda-Vilis), they probably were.  MT Imperial Encyclopedia describes the
Zid Rachele Society as a secret Vilani supremacist group, that led a series
of revolts in 1010-1011.  The Psionics Suppressions must have left a lot of
people disaffected (like the surviving relatives of psionic researchers and
psi-talented people who were purged or blacklisted).  

I haven\'t even touched on class divisions that could have caused festering
discontent.  The Imperium is ruled by a small noble class that also controls
the megacorporations and the Navy.  To what extent did the employees and
farmers and sailors feel exploited and trapped?  That\'s not explicit in any
GDW (or other, as far as I know) publication, but it could be a source of
dissent and insurrection.  

The Imperium is a Solomani graft on a Vilani stem, and the Vilani stem
itself includes conquered and subjugated societies.  I think there\'s plenty
of room for an Imperium full of wild-eyed revolutionaries suddenly
developing enormous public support and being suppressed and discredited by
tight-lipped bureaucrats and self-righteous noble-ranking naval officers.
That\'s what you\'ll find if you\'re adventuring in my Imperium, anyway.

One more point on this issue:  The Rebellion Sourcebook seems to take the
line that A Few Great Men and Women completely disrupted a stable and
harmonious eleven hundred year old eleven thousand system wide state
virtually overnight.  I don\'t think so.  The Imperium was ready to be
disrupted, and Dulinor was in the right place at the right time (not that
I support his rash action).

6) "High Guard" refers to the practice of some ships remaining in a gas
giant\'s higher orbits while others refuel in the atmosphere.  It\'s not
necessarily a convoying force in the high position.  The High Guard can
defend the refuelling ships from attacks from outer space -- like ships
hidden on the gas giant\'s satellites.  High Guard doesn\'t protect the
refuelling ships from the SDBs hiding in the gas giant\'s atmosphere, so they
have to take care of themselves.  I think that the natural ECM effects of
the atmosphere would probably help a lot here.

Not so.  The danger of destroying one of your own worlds is nil.  You\'re
forgetting one of the first facts one discovers about space...  It\'s BIG.
You just can\'t believe how unimaginably big space is...  You may think
it\'s a long way down the street to the chemist, but that\'s peanuts to
space...
Really, the chances of hitting one of your own worlds is so close to zero
percent as to be indistinguishable from it except in theoretical terms.
I never bothered with the Traveller misjump rules much.  I only had to
invoke them once.  After that the players, (after they had rolled up new
characters), made sure everything was in perfect working order at all
times.  Purified fuel, purged and cleaned systems, the works.  Because
anyone who misjumps is never heard from again if they don\'t have fuel
for multiple jumps.

 First, I\'d like to thank 
      Edwin Fritz, 
      Edward Swatshenck, 
      Steven M Bonneville ("The walking Traveller databank")
      Steve Higginbothan (Good to see you again! And say hi to Cynthia!)
      Glenn Goffin
      and Emilio Desalvo 
 for helping to sort out my humongous question.  Thanks!
 
 Also, now that my education in asteroid artillery is nearly _COMPLETE_
 (Darth Vader voiceover), I\'d like to stretch out my question a bit.
 
 First: the Path of Tears sourcebook implies that the preferred military
 goal - if you don\'t want to exterminate the population - is decapitation.
 For example, a typical Star Viking hit would capture the headman, or smash
 his main force via bombardment or airborne assault. 
 
 This is excellent as an offensive goal: but what about from the defensive
 angle?  I suspect that the answer would center around 1) set up a BIG
 sensor umbrella (a system-wide version of the DEW line, say) 2) do NOT
 advertise the location of your major resources and 3) pour 90% of your
 money and sweat into the local space fleet & deep-site meson guns,
 because If They Go, It\'s All Over.  Do I have it right?
 
 
 Second: The existance of the Imperial Army has always annoyed me... except
 as long-term occupation & garrison troops, they seem only to mark time.  If
 the Threat Force has successfully taken the high ground (be it space or the
 air), the ground force is meat.
 
 (I shouldn\'t really speak against them: in my pocket universe, My Boys
 have a massive occupation army spread out across a ton of worlds.  "You can\'t
 hold land with jets - or even starships")
 
 Even so... with all those grav tanks and artillery, I can\'t precieve the
 Imperial Army as helpless, for some reason.  Even if the Threat Force has
 captured the main cities, the Army should still be able to fight back,
 from prepared undersea sites or polar ice caps, say.  The primary goals
 would focus on 
    1) cutting off the Threat garrison from their orbiting friends.  This
 would make the starports Serious targets.  Can grav tanks intercept
 landing starships?  If not, I\'m sure that the 57th century\'s equivalent of
 the hand-held Stinger missile can.
    2) drawing the Threat garrison into an Unfortunate Incident.  A
 drastically weakened Threat garrison would weaken the Threat\'s control of
 the population and the world\'s resources.  If the Threat garrison falls, they
 cannot use the down starport\'s resources to repair ships or transport
 resources.  Moreover, a strictly nominal conquest of a world - even if no 
 Imperial Navy ships can help out our battalion yet - can become a \'safe 
 site\' for merchantile raiders or intelligence vessels, as well as a great
 morale builder.  (Many times in British Imperial history, British opinion
 was strongly motivated to \'breaking the siege of Kimberley\' or \'rescue the
 garrison at Bombay\') 
    3) Harrassment.  I\'m thinking of the \'Blowing up the railways\' type of
 thing.  Imagine the French Resistance, spread out across a subsector or
 two.  Here, the Imperial Liberation Front would have to be radically 
 reorganised into a semi-covert or covert force, and take a crash course in
 intelligence operations.  The very nature of the Army would be altered, if
 the Occupation continues for, say, longer than a generation.
 
 (Note: as far as I know, no Imperial territory has been held long enough
 to cause an Imperial Liberation Front to arise, pre-rebellion.  Of course,
 you could imagine what would happen if the Zhodani successfully took the
 Spinward Marches in the Fifth Frontier War.  
    However, I believe that hundreds of Imperial systems fell under Aslan or
 Vargr rule during the Rebellion, many within the Domain of Deneb.  Also,
 there are the fractions...)
  
 With these notes, I hope that I have expanded the Imperial Army\' s mission
 into something more suitable of the name \'Imperial\'.

Well, I think asteroids do leave the world more habitable (at least by
Traveller terms) because you don\'t have all that messy radiation lasting
tens of thousands of years.  Calling a weather pattern messy is relative;
there\'re probably lots of worlds with naturally occurring weather far 
messier than the one resulting from a couple of dropped asteroids.

Your point about pissing off your enemy is good but only if the enemy is
the interstellar state you mentioned.  If your enemy is confined to the
planet in question, then fear is probably a better resultant emotion than
anger.

 Well, no.  How effective would destruction of Washington DC be in
conquering the USA?  Admittedly, we\'d lose Congress, the President, and
the Pentagon, but would that be such a bad thing (in terms of conquest
of the US, anyway)?
 It seems to me that a decapitation strike would work well only in
places where the general populace is ready to come over to your side as
soon as the "Great Leader\'s" boot is off your neck.  It wasn\'t even
_that_ easy in Nazi Germany...

 Probably.  I\'ve always been in favour of MASSIVE, MIND-NUMBINGLY
thorough sensor networks.  Mind you, the network doesn\'t really need to
be system wide, since the only parts of the system you need to concern
yourself with is the part you live in (gas giant refueling is a stupid
waste in TNE rules, and not especially useful in either of the other
rules sets - I\'d rather take along a huge pile of drop tanks, myself).
 As to deep-meson sites - I\'ve become skeptical about them recently. 
The TOUGH worlds in my TCS game had anywhere from 12,000 to 30,000
missile batteries as planetary defenses.  None of them had meson tech
until near the end of the game, BUT in previous games, the number of
deep meson sites never exceeded a few hundred (due primarily to the cost
of the supporting power plants).  And the deep meson sites were quite
vulnerable to attacks on the required power plants (which were quite
detectable via neutrino sensors).
 Admittedly, the missile batteries were also vulnerable to attack,
but you can afford a LOT more of them, which makes it a LOT harder to
neutralize them...
 But the Fleet is probably your single best defense against an attack
intended to conquer you.  A Fleet can\'t really protect you against an
attempt to destroy you (as several people found out to their dismay (New
Home and Neubayern and Serendip Belt come to mind)), but it can make a
conquest far more expensive and difficult than any other single factor.
 Note that a Fleet won\'t make your world unconquerable.  Even if it
is the biggest Fleet around.  But it WILL make it MUCH harder to do, and
stretch out the conquest for quite a long time...

 This sounds like the standard line I\'ve been hearing all my life (I
grew up around the Army).  And from what I\'ve read, it has been the
standard line ever since the end of WW2 (with variations going back to
last century).  Every time a new weapon comes along, you hear about the
death-knell of the Army as a factor in future wars.  Hasn\'t worked out
that way yet, and I have this (admittedly religious) feeling that it
won\'t be gone in 5600+AD either.
 Admittedly, the way the Army does things changes as technology
changes.  But so far, in the last 5000 years of technological advance
(and advance in the military art), the basic job of the Army hasn\'t
changed very much really - just the way they DO their basic job (take
control of things that the owners don\'t want to give up).  I expect that
by the time of the Imperium, the Army will fight in ways that are not
easily predictable (I haven\'t done enough Striker/MT mass combat/TNE
mass combat to make a good guess as to what will work), but I will
venture to make a few (not very educated) guesses:

 1)  the fraction of soldiers on the "front lines" will continue to
decrease, while at the same time, a larger fraction of soldiers will
find themselves fighting more often.
 2)  artillery will continue to increase in importance (and the
defense with it).  Note that I don\'t define the _form_ that the
"artillery" will take - I doubt seriously it will still be cannon,
either conventional, ETC, or mass driver.  I wouldn\'t bet too much on
artillery rockets, either.
 3)  the degree to which the Army and Navy function as a team will
continue to increase, probably even faster than at present.  This
depends a lot on rules set in question - the reaction drives in TNE will
produce significantly different interactions with the Army than the
reactionless drives in MT...

 (Gee, it was easy to make those guesses.  Now my guess as to how
many of them will actually be accurate - zero...;-) )

 Why do you assume that the Threat Force will take the main cities? 
Historically, cities have always been among the hardest things to take
(without destroying them).  Admittedly, the Threat Force could threaten
to obliterate the cities if they don\'t surrender.  But unless they are
prepared to carry through on the threat, they\'ll be out of luck if
anyone calls their bluff.  And if they ARE prepared to carry through on
the threat, then they don\'t NEED the real estate, and shouldn\'t be
wasting their time trying to conquer this place.
 It is more likely the initial landings will be well away from the
major cities (if only to avoid destroying the industries you are trying
to capture)...

 Depends on technology.  In the earlier versions of Trav, they
definitely can.  In TNE I don\'t know, but probably.

 Also a good guess.  If only because the lads in the battledress can
carry a pretty big "hand-held missile"...

 If the Occupation continues that long, then there won\'t be a
Resistance anymore.  As to "crash courses", it is quite likely that what
we now consider "covert ops" will be a standard part of military
training then - note that the history of Infantry operations includes a
trend toward smaller maneuver units, and less obvious operations...

 Incorrect.  The Zhos have pushed the Imperium out of the sectors
spinward of the Marches.  Once upon a time, the Impies even owned all
the "Zhodani worlds" in the Spinward Marches...

 Actually, we (Cynthia and I) don\'t even believe that there IS an
"Imperial Army" per se.  We think that the "Imperial Army" is actually a
number of HQ formations for Army and Army Corps level units.  No combat
units at all.  When the "Imperial Army" is needed, the formations are
filled out with individual units seconded from member worlds
militaries.  Which would tend to explain why the Army units in FFW have
widely variable TLs, as opposed to the Marines, which are all TL15...

Before this topic gets too tangled, realize that there are some 
rules changes between CT/MT and TNE that can affect the tactics.
In TNE, meson-gun artillery can easily hit orbiting ships, and
ground-based PD batteries can theoretically hit ships nearly out
to the jump point (4.3 light-seconds from a size-8 world).  In
1977 CT, ranges were minimal, and in MT extreme range starts at
about five-sixths of a light-second.

For instance, at 1.2 light-seconds, Luna is at extreme range for
all Earth-based weapons in MT, while in TNE it is at medium range 
for the standard tech-15 150 MJ laser turret.

In TCS, massive missile/repulsor/damper batteries can make more
sense than the same money on meson-guns, since even the little
mesons are fairly expensive (I don\'t know about Striker).  Of
course, that assumes you aren\'t using the standard planetary
capture rules, but I know few TCS players satisfied with them.
In TNE, you can build little ones, but heavy-duty meson screens 
are fairly cheap and don\'t need much power.  Then again, you
can up the discharge energy on a short gun.  Whether or not 
missiles need maneuver fuel can affect the energy weapon/missile
balance.  The big advantage of a deep-site is that it can hurt
a big ship coming in, has a tremendous armor value, and even
can be meson-screened.  But MT neutrino sensors can ruin your
day.  (Ask the inventors of the "meson-gun-submarine".)  So
in a sense, it depends on which rules you plan to use.

Here\'s a few responses :

Can grav-tanks intercept a landing starship?
Absolutely yes. There isn\'t much difference between a fighter with 
thruster plates and a tank with thruster plates except perhaps one has a 
driver and one has a pilot.Take a look at Renegade Legion:Centurion for 
more on this.

A planetbuster misjumping into a hex with a system in it will 1) Arrive 
at a random point in either 9 square light years or 27 cubic light years 
with a random orientation relative to the system located therein. No 
chance of a hit.

Expect the I.Army garrison on any given world to be prepared for the loss 
of the Fleet units insystem with weapons caches and a resistance plan.

 Can\'t possibly be right; if the First Imperium lasted only 1200

 about three hundred years before Terra put its first man in space,

NOTES:
 
* Humans are listed on both the major and minor race lists due to the
multitude of "native" human worlds caused by the Ancient seeding project
ca. -300,000 imperial.  According to the books, there are 3 known major
human races, and 46 known living minor human races.  Currently, I have the
names and/or locations of some 14 living minor races, counting the Floriani
twice, and not including the Loeskalth, who are believed extinct or
assimilated by the Vilani but who survive (_Fate of the Sky Raiders_; FASA).
   Some Azhanti High Lightning cruisers seem to incorporate names of Ancient-
displaced human races.  Some possible unverified names for human minor races
extrapolated from AHL cruiser names:  Azhanti, Sylean, Fiorin, Acheron,
Ilurian, Luriani.
   This situation is further complicated by Solomani and Imperial genetic
experiments which have resulted in additional races.
 
** The Aslan are listed on both the major and minor race lists due to the
recent discovery that they developed hyperdrive from Solomani artifacts,
namely the starship TRS _Pathfinder_.  Despite this, they have been included
as a major race for some 3000 years, and are one of the most vital aliens in
Known Space, thus justifying their continued listing as a major race.  No
flames about "major/minor" race designation racism please!
 
*** The Chips are listed on both the minor and uplifted race lists due to
their accidental and unpredictable evolution of intelligence in response to
their exposure to advanced silicon materials and circuits in a crashed
Terran vessel during the 7th Interstellar War.  They may currently be
considered either (1) extinct after the nuclear bombardment of their
homeworld in 1127 (assuming none were off-world) or (2) still extant as
the Virus.
 
**** The Eslyat and the Murians were originally from Paranoia Press\'s _The
Beyond_ and _Vanguard Reaches_ sector products, and therefore are no longer
strictly "canonical" Traveller aliens.  However, DGP\'s _Solomani & Aslan_
still shows governmental units labeled with their names in that area, albeit
differently placed than in the PP products.  So the question is open....
 
# Miniphants might not quite qualify as sentient.  The issue of JTAS they
appeared in (#16) stated that they had an intelligence of 2-4, and they do
seem to fit the group above, so they got put there.

 Let\'s see...using Supplement 11 (Library Data N-Z) and Spinward
Marches Campaign, it is possible to put together a fairly complete
picture of the movements of the Impy borders over the last 500-odd
years.  I won\'t bore you with ALL of that picture, just enough to annoy
you...:-)

 First Frontier War:  The Impy Frontier extended into Gvurrdon and
Foreven Sectors.  Not very far into each, but there were Impy worlds
near the Consulate\'s Official Border (note that Zhos colonized beyond
their own borders also, just like the Impies did) in both Sectors.
 During the 15 years of the War, the Impies were expelled from all
the worlds they held in those two Sectors.
 In addition the Zhos took over Zeycude, Reno, Errere, Cantrel,
Thengo, Gesentown, Chronor, and Atsa.  Note that some of these worlds
MAY have had Zho colonists, in addition to the Impy colonists, living
there before the war.
 In addition, the Imperium was forced to allow independence to Rio,
Whenge, Enlas-Du, Indo, Nerewhon, and Puparkin.
 In exchange, they took control of several dozen worlds in Chronor,
Querion, and Vilis subsectors.

 The Second Frontier War:  This time, the Impies lost only four
worlds to the Zhos:  Cipango, Chwistyoch, Riverland, and Clan.  The
Imperium was also forced to grant "several dozen" worlds in Chronor,
Querion, and Vilis subsectors their independence (basically, all the
ones they picked up at the end of the 1FW).

 Between wars:  The Zhos pick up Terra Nova, Asmodeus, and Sansibar,
all former Impy worlds granted "independence" by the Treaty ending the
2FW.

 The Third Frontier War:  A repeat of the 2FW.  The Imperium ceded
directly to the Zhos:  Resatt, Ao-Dai, Foelen, and Farreach.  In
addition the Zhos picked up Attica, Ninjar, Sheyou, Lebeau, Querion, and
Rap\'s World, all of which were granted "independence" at the end of the
2FW.
 In addition, in this war, the Sword Worlds picked up two Impy
worlds:  Margesi and Saurus.  They held these worlds until the Imperium
recovered them after the 4FW, about 100 years later.
 And, as usual, the Imperium was forced to grant independence to
another bunch of worlds in Vilis and Querion subsectors.

 The Fourth Frontier War:  The Zhos grab one (1) world, which had
been a member of the Imperium before the 3FW.  In addition, they force
the Imperium to grant independence to Algebaster, and force joint
tenancy of Esalin.
 At this time, the Imperium recovered Margesi and Saurus from the
Sword Worlds.

 The Fifth Frontier War:  For the first time, the Impies fight a war
with the Zhos, WITHOUT having to give up any worlds.  Unfortunatelly,
they didn\'t gain any worlds either, unless you count the dismembered
Sword Worlds.


> (WHAT? But...but...the Imperium _never_ loses........WHAAAAA!)

 Well, against the Zhos, they have an almost unblemished record of
losses.  They haven\'t EVER taken a world away from the Zhos.  But they
have finally figured out how to avoid losing more worlds to the Zhos,
anyway...;-)  That\'s something, isn\'t it? ;-)

HEY!  This is news to me!

Since the Third Imp. took such a large chunk of the Solomani, I thought
that they hardly ever loss a interstellar war.  When did they lose these
worlds?  How?

(WHAT? But...but...the Imperium _never_ loses........WHAAAAA!)
===================================================================

At one time the Imperium not only owned as the Zhodani worlds in the the
Spinward Marches but it\'s territory even included worlds beyond the Marches
that are now Zhodani.

The first three Frontier Wars resulted in the Imperium losing a number
of worlds, resulting in the current boundary with the Consulate.

 I\'m taking as "official" anything published by GDW or a GDW
 licensed source, for Traveller, Megatraveller, and TNE.  Below are
 all of the races, major and minor, that I can remember
 encountering in sources official by the above definition.  If you
 have any questions about any of them, post or email, and I\'ll try
 to get some specifics.  This list\'ll just be the names.

 Vilani         Solomani        Aslan           Hivers
 Droyne         Zhodani         Vargr           Dynchia
 Ael Yael       Bwabs           Darrians        Virushi
 K\'kree         Sabmiqys        Dolphins*       Orcas*
 Schalli*       Cymbeline Chiplife*

 The four starred names are races that I don\'t recall seeing in
 pre-TNE stuff, but in order for them to be in the state of
 development described in TNE materials, they would have had to be
 extant in the Traveller (classic - black books) era,  The
 Cymbeline Chiplife may have become extinct during the War of
 Collapse (I prefer this to "Final War", which was also used for
 the last of the Grandfather wars, which meant the "end" of the
 Ancients), except in the form of pre-Collapse Deyo transponders
 and post-Collapse Virus.

All those names were published in either a GDW, FASA, or DGP source,
if I recall correctly.  Many are only known from references in text,
sidebars, and the like, so there aren\'t generation rules for all of
them in existance.

Dolphins were published in JTAS, Best of JTAS #2, and a new version
I understand is in TD #13.  Orcas appeared in MT\'s _A.G. to Diaspora_
folio.  The Cymbeline life-form first appeared in CT\'s Adventure 13:
_Signal GK_.  The Schalli, I think, are new.  Xenophiles should note
that there was a minor race at Thorell in one of the RC\'s home sub-
sectors, formerly Nicosia subsector.

Also, add another human minor race, Sylean, at Capital/Core (Core).
(From Travellers\' Digest, no generation info available.)

   Just what does the Imperial Army do?  I have a fair idea of what the 
Imperial Marines do.
They serve as shipboard troop on Imperial Naval vessels.  They perform 
planetary invasions in a fashion similar to present day US Marine Amphibious 
Assault  Groups.   They provide security functions at Imperial Naval bases.  
Given what I know of the Imperial Military model, the Imperial Marines are 
probably under the control, or at least administration of, the Imperial Navy.
   The Imperial Army basic function is to control planetary surface.  As the 
old adage goes, You can fly over it, you can bomb it, but you really dont 
control it till you can stand a 19 year old kid with a rifle on it. The Navy 
performs surface bombardments.  The Marines perform assault landing to take 
control of the spaceport and planetary defenses.  Then the Army comes in to
capture the hearts and minds of the local population.   Failing that, the
Army 
tries to keep the number of bombing and sniper attacks down.
   Such a task takes a lot of troops.  Dont forget that for every trooper you

have carrying a rifle, you have five soldiers performing support tasks.  
Maintaining such an organization full time is a big task, even for the 
Imperium.  This is why I agree with the Steve on the structure of the
Imperial 
Army.  The actual full time, Imperial Army consists of a core of  Officers
and 
senior NCOs who serve as a Cadre core for member planet Armies called up for 
Imperial service.
   For example, after the 5th Frontier War, the Imperium has taken control of

several planets from the Sword World Confederation.  Rather than garrison
each 
planet with several regiments of TL14/15 Imperial Marines, Several Division
of
planetary army troops for each occupied planet are brought in from the
Marches
and placed under Imperial Army Command.   The troops get Imperial Army tags 
for their helmets and Imperial Army patches for their sleeves.  Overall
command and most staff positions would be filled by full time Imperial Army 
personnel.   Some of the captured worlds are only TL 6.  You dont need TL 15 
Marines for that.  A Division or two of TL 8 or 9 troop with TL C support 
units should do the trick.  You can further stack the deck with a light 
cruiser or two in orbit (You take the low road.  Ill take the High Road and 
rain Death all over ye.)
    Using this model the local planetary governments pays the bulk of the
cost
of maintaining the Army units.  The Imperial government would supply some 
funds.  Think of it as incentive to maintain the Army with Imperial standard 
equipment.  This way if you get two TL A divisions from two different
planets,
they use the same ammo, basically the same weapons and theyll be
able to read able to read and understand each others rank tabs.
    The Imperium would start picking up more of the tab once the units are 
called into Imperial service.  Then the logistics machine that makes up the 
bulk of the full time Imperial Army would swing into play.  Making sure the 
units go where theyre supposed to, providing full time Imperial Army cadre 
troops, providing the supply lines, that sort of thing.
    The Imperial Army would have large bases scattered around the Imperium. 
These bases would provide the administrative offices, training facilities and

storage.  Member planets would be required to send a certain percentage of 
their  officers to train at Imperial Army facilities.   
The Imperial Army would also provide specialized training for member planet 
units.  Most member worlds with a standing army would have a small Imperial 
Army detachment.  This Imperial Army unit would consist of mostly officers
and
a logistics staff (perhaps assigned by the local army).  Their task would to
assure Imperial standards in equipment and training are maintained and to 
coordinate local army units in the event of Imperial call up.

assumption that all low berths are constructed to include a small but
serviceable nuclear damper, which effectively stops all nuclear breakdown
in it\'s limited area of effect. I feel this solution makes it possible
for the harried GM to ignore the whole issue and get on with playing the
game. :-) Say after me everyone: "This is only a game! We\'re supposed to

The self-radioactivity damage is trivial compared to environmental exposure.
This shouldn\'t be an issue for low berth stays under a few thousand years.

IMHO, if there isn\'t a medical way to deal with cancer by the time
low berth technology is reliable, we aren\'t going to make it to the

I agree with George Herbert and Anders Lindborg, ignore this for
the reasons the three of us have posted:  technology, relative
effect, and playability.  The dangers of low berth travel are bad
enough as is!

Your right.  It is a wierd way to do trading.  However, the system was
designed to simplify trading, and to incorperate other factors.  But it lost
a lot of flavor from the old trading rules.  

Some people assign price multiplyers to each cargo, so if you pick up gems
at 975-452 and gems have a multiplyer of 100, then the price per ton would be
1,000,000 per ton.  Others figure the cargo, and give it a base price
instead of the default 4000cr / ton.

Some of us from the old world, still use the Classic Traveller Trading rules!!!
:-)

An early edition of Challenge had a system for rolling what the cargo
actually
_is_, coupled with throws to multiply the base cost. I and my group expanded
on
this, adding hazardous cargoes (good for a giggle!) If anyone\'s interested,
I\'ll

The ftp site at ftp.nau.edu has every Imperial sector -- except Core!

Does anyone know where I can download the Core sector?  Thanks for any help!

Also on my mind: how many worlds did the Sylean Federation hold when Cleon I
converted it to the Third Imperium?  Im my "Atlas of the Imperium", the
Federation seems rather small to be the foundation of the Imperium, and in
my (condenced) version of the AAB library, Cleon annexed most of Core
Sector before being proclaimed Emperor.  

Also, my AAB listings say that he was at the head of a financial combine,
and this combine gave him the strength to become \'the real power\' of
Sylea.  Does anyone know what became of this combine?  (The ancestor of a
megacorp, perhaps?)

Finally, Cleon is said to be \'a Solomani noble\'.  And yet, Lucan the
Magificent threw out a Vilani envoy because he would not speak in High
Sylean.  Does anyone know - or make a guesstimate - the relationship
between Syleans (a minor human race), the Third Imperium, and Imperial
nobility?

    Okay already! I\'ve been absolutely bombarded by messages asking for a copy
of the trading details. Rather than send it to each applicant (and no, US Mail
from England isn\'t a good idea, probably as expensive as sending an X-Boat
message (have you ever wondered what that _costs_?)), I\'m just going to submit
the whole furshlugginer thing.

    The original article was in Challenge 20, by Marcus Rowland (who used to
write for the once-great White Dwarf, now a sad house organ Warhammer Monthly),
and covered the hazardous bit. The cargo bit is my own work (blush), produced
from Classic and Merchants & Merchandise (remember that?). If you use this, just
mention that the system was produced by Ace and the Dog. That\'s all the
copyright there is.

    Anyone with Windows or similar proportional fonts will notice that it looks
like boll*cks, with all the columns failing to line up. I can\'t help that - just
drop it into DOS and it will look OK. The original was in WordStar and had to be
reformatted.

    As you might have spotted, I\'m an incorrigible System Designer. If anyone
has any good ideas to trade, lob \'em my way! Now, enough drivel from me - on
with the tables.

Cargo detailing for Merchant Prince

 First, generate the cargo value according to Merchant Prince. This will
produce the purchase cost (although it is perfectly allowable and much quicker
to take Cr4,000 as a base if in a tight corner for time). Then roll on the most
appropriate general table to the source world and throw for a specific cargo
from the indicated subtable. Multiply the cost and price per ton by the factor
shown and determine how many tons are available by the parameters given. The
price & cost may then be optionally multiplied by 2D- 6%. NOTE that the notation
"tons" indicates displacement tons in all cases (ie 1,350 litres of hydrogen to
the ton).

 If units are given (suffixed with an @) the cargo will be available in
multiples of these units. If not, it will generally be divisible into 1-ton
lots.

        In regular use with a gaming group who trade a lot, it\'s probably worth
rolling up a page of cargoes and keeping it handy to improve gameflow. Another
option is to write a program to generate them ad-hoc (I did, but my gaming group
won\'t allow PCs at the table - can\'t think why...)

        Incidentally, apologies to any Traveller die-hards with only d6.

An early edition of Challenge had a system for rolling what the cargo 
actually
_is_, coupled with throws to multiply the base cost. I and my group expanded
on
this, adding hazardous cargoes (good for a giggle!) If anyone\'s interested,
I\'ll

1.) Where/when did this happen? (I don\'t doubt you, I just don\'t seem to have
    read the same sources.)

2.) Possibly Sylean became the court language of the Imperium.

I was under the impression that the worlds of the Sylean Federation 
formed the beginnings of the Third Imperium. I believe that The 
Travellers Digest Number 18: A Concise History of the Third Imperium
gives a good quick summary of how the Sylean Federation rose out of
the Long Night mostly due to four different MegaCorps (LSP,
Zirunkariish, Tukera, and GSbAG).

It also mentions that Sylea had a TL12 Navy with meson screens giving it
a competitive advantage. The Sylean Federation Scout Service increased
the size of the Federation by recontacting other systems and trading 
technology for membership. 

As regards the court language I think that Survival Margin mentions
this Lucan incident. As a reaction to the Rebellion I think Lucan
changed it to Sylean. I don\'t have SM with me though, so its just a
distant memory.

For each race, it includes the home planet location, a thumbnail sketch, and
where to look for more data. I will add the additional listings from the

repost the expanded list.

Feel free to mail me corrections (slings and arrows etc).

Note for you TNEers (tin ears): most of these races live on at least one 
world they would easily have survived upon, so odds are they are still 
around.  However, the "domain ruled" information will be off.

The list is divided into Major races, Minor races, Minor Human Races:

Race            Home World

Droyne          Unknown;
                probably in Spinward Marches

The Droyne are the survivors of the Ancients.   They are a multi-part race;
an individual "castes"  to become a member of a subspecies suited to a
particular role.  Uncasted members do not fully  develop and live as
chirpers.  The Droyne are  psionically inclined.  See "Aliens 6: Droyne."


Fteirle         Kusyu / Dark Nebula 1919
(Aslan)

Evolved from carnivorous hunters, they developed  a society structured by
clan; no central government. Culture places great value on honor to balance
natural aggression. Their society spans 17  sectors spinward of Solomani
space. See "Aslan &  Solomani."


Hivers          (planet) / Ricenden I (Guaran)

Developed from beings that look like star fish.   They are good with
computers.  They prefer subtle  manipulation to confrontation or overt
action.   They control a several sector domain Trailing of  the Solomani
Confederation. "See Aliens 7: Hivers."


K\'kree          Kirur / Ruupiin F (Thirty)
(Centaurs)

The K\'kree developed from hexapodal herd animals, developing intelligence
for defense. They  have a several sector realm trailing the Vargr Extents
and the 3rd Imperium.  See "Aliens 2: K\'kree".


Solomani                Terra / Solomani Rim 1827
(Humaniti major)

The Solomani humans come from humaniti\'s original home: Terra.  Solomani
are known for their  curiosity, impetuosity, and belief that they should
rule scattered humaniti.  The Solomani Confederation is an 8 sector domain
rimward of of Imperial  space.  See "Aslan & Solomani."


Vargr                   Lair / Provence 2402

Geneered by the Ancients 300K years ago from  terran canines.  Their mental
capacity was uplifted  to sentience and their fore paws were reformed as
hands.  They are spread over 18 sectors with no  encompassing government
coreward of Imperial  space.  See "Vilani & Vargr."


Vilani                  Vland / Vland 1717
(Humaniti major)

Taken from Terra 300K years ago by Ancients;   developed jump drive and
created the 28-sector  First Empire, which lasted a few K years before
falling within 2 centuries of meeting the Solomani.  Pure-stock Vilani
known for long life span (up to  200 years).  Culture is group-oriented,
known for  careful, deliberate planning. See "Vilani & Vargr."


Zhodani                 Zdhant / Zhdant
(Humaniti major)

Taken from earth 300K years ago by Ancients;  developed a psionically-
oriented society now  dominating a several-sector domain spinward of Vargr
space that eventually came in conflict with the 3rd Imperium. See "Aliens
4: Zhodani."



Minor Alien Races

Race                    Home world

Adduxar                 Addux? / Tienspevnekr G

Carnivorous reptilian race with small stellar empire of about 37 planets

  Folks, I\'m embarrassed to admit it, which is probably why I never
  did under the _old_ TML, but I\'ve decided that a fresh start 
  means a fresh start all around.

  I\'m on a PC-based BBS whose news and mail gateway is fragged.

  What this means is that I can\'t depend on certain stuff to come 
  through as originally formatted, and I occasionally get long 
  messages as two or three separate messages.  This sucks.

  As far as the formatting goes:  If you\'re using TABS for 
  alignment, please set your editor to replace TABS with an 
  appropriate number of spaces, and set your right margin to stick 
  a hard line break in before about column 75 (65 is better).  I\'m 
  screaming at my SysOps to get this bovine fecal matter fixed, but 
  progress is ...  difficult ... at best.

  Much appreciated.

Attention Traveller Collectors!
 
I\'ve recently aquired multiple copies of the following
out-of-print items by Digest Group Publications, and am offering
them for sale:
 
 
Travellers\' Digest #19      8 1/2" x 11"    48 pages       DGP  $15
 
    TD19 contains an exciting adventure called "The Possession
    Ball" set in Deneb Sector.  Here is an excerpt:  "At the time
    the Kalavatos Institute was destroyed, researchers there were
    experimenting with the psionic transfer of a subject\'s
    thought-force into inanimate objects..."
 
    For convenience, also printed in the mag is a map of Deneb
    Sector, Deneb library data, and world UWP for Deneb.  Plus
    the mag\'s regular features.
 
Travellers\' Digest #20      8 1/2" x 11"    48 pages       DGP  $15
 
    TD20 has the adventure "An Act of Conscience", which deals
    with a robot that has attained true sentience.  The adventure
    takes place in the Trojan Reaches (one sector Rimward of the
    Spinward Marches), and the issue includes a history, a map,
    and library data and library data on that sector.  This issue
    also contains another adventure, a covert operation called
    "The Hiawatha Gambit" set in the Spinward Marches, plus the
    usual potpouri of support articles.
 
Travellers\' Digest #21      8 1/2" x 11"    48 pages       DGP  $15
 
    TD21 contains the adventures "One Last Stop" and "The Pirates
    of Tetrini".  The former takes place at an ancient site in
    Regina Subsector of the Spinward Marches, while the latter
    sends the PCs on a mission to investigate a likely pirate
    base.  The issue also includes equipment write-ups, an
    in-depth article on suspended animation, and more.
 
Megatraveller Journal #3    8 1/2" x 11"   96 pages      M DGP  $20
 
    MTJ3 is a collasal sourcebook crammed with useful gaming
    material.  The main adventure, "Rapid Repo", by Greg Videll,
    "propels a team of Domain Scout commandos into the
    Vargr-occupied Imperial Navy Depot in Corridor Sector".  The
    adventure comes complete with a map of the Depot (essentially
    a huge starport), floorplans, and special equipment.
 
    This issue also includes an IN-DEPTH write-up of a
    highly populated tech-level 16 world in Deneb Sector,
    articles on races to be found in the Domain of Deneb, an
    article on MegaCorporations in the Rebellion Era, equipment,
    news items, an NPC dossier, a ship write-up, lots of artwork
    (including a cool mock-ad for a military equipment supplier),
    and an interview with the popular Traveller writers/brothers
    J. Andrew Keith and William H. Keith, Jr.
 
Megatraveller Journal #4    8 1/2" x 11"   96 pages      M DGP  $30
 
    MTJ4 is actually a campaign sourcebook desguised as a
    magazine.  Nearly the entire issue is devoted to William H.
    Keith Jr\'s "Lords of Thunder" campaign set in Gateway Sector
    (which lies between the Imperium and the Two Thousand Worlds
    (K\'kree space).  The campaign includes a central adventure,
    and loads of loads of background and support material.  The
    front cover displays a painting by WHK himself, depicting
    Gateway Prime, the artificial world for which the sector is
    named.  This work was by far, IMHO, WHK\'s greatest
    contribution to the Traveller universe.
 
    William H. Keith, Jr. says it best, in the interview from
    MTJ3:
 
        "Seeker games had commissioned me to do a campaign
        module, `Lords of Thunder\', and they just gave me an
        entire sector to play with.  It\'s the Gateway sector and
        it\'s out between the Imperium and K\'kree space."
 
        "It\'s far enough from the Imperium that I was able to set
        up seven or eight different mini empires, each one with
        maybe twenty or thirty stars.  K\'kree space is right next
        door, in the next sector over.  One off-shoot of the Two
        Thousand Worlds has kind of broken off from the parent
        group and formed their own Empire.  They\'ve started to
        leak across into this sector.  They\'ve just now absorbed
        a human-dominated subsector.  Also mixed in with this are
        rumors that the G\'naak, the thought to be extinct ancient
        enemy of the K\'kree, are about, somewhere, and the K\'kree
        have agents out looking for them."
 
        "I wrote this entire campaign, where the adventurers come
        in and they can be hired by any number of different
        patrons.  One way or another, they\'ll find themselves
        going out and getting involved in any of the following.
        There\'s an archeological party that\'s tracking down this
        mysterious presumably extinct civilization.  There are
        pirates that are orgainzing raids against ships, there\'s
        a war brewing between all of these human empires, the
        K\'kree are coming through, and there are refugees fleeing
        the K\'kree -- you can really get caught up in the
        politics of this sector."
 
        "But this project really does represent one of my main
        goals.  That was, to take a whole sector and work it up
        with enough detail in the planets and in the conflicting
        cultures and the history so that you could just draw
        dozens of adventures from it."
 
        [RS -- Joe Fugate liked the sound of the campaign so much
        that he contacted Seeker Publications and secured the
        rights to print the campaign in MTJ4!  I\'ve found the
        campaign to be suitable for Classic or MegaTraveller
        settings.]
 
I\'ve got more than a dozen of each of the above items, but I
don\'t expect them to last long, so contact me ASAP.
 
Enjoy,

    'body' => 'Hi, all...I was reading through the original MERCHANT PRINCE Book 7, and 
was reminded that at one time, GDW had available for sale a disk-based 
text program called TRADER.  It was written in DOS 3.3, requiring 48k and 
a single diskdrive.
  I know it\'s laughable these days, but my computer is an Apple IIe, and 
since I am going to be starting up a new MegaTraveller campaign, I 
thought that this program could come in handy...
  The hard part is finding it.  I called GDW, on the EXTREMELY slim 
chance that there were a few copies gathering dust on a shelf in the back 
rooms somewhere, but no luck...
  Which brings us to this plea-- 
 
        Is there anyone online in this mailing list who has the original 
Traveller Merchant Prince program TRADER for the Apple II?  I would be 
willing to pay for it (if not an outrageous price), and would send a disk 
for it, if need be.
 
  Actually, the thing sounds rather interesting.  It supposedly had a 
sector generator, twenty-four starships, the Spinward Marches and the 
Solomani Rim sectors with hex numbers, UPPs, bases, trade 
classifications, allegiance, a tradeworld marking and an 
explored/unexplored marking.
  Any help in this area would be appreciated...
 
Now: Go ahead and ROFL at this poor Apple IIe user, riding my skateboard 
on the information superhighway! :)

    'topic' => 'HG designs: Krait fighters',
    'body' => 'Here are some High Guard fighters. The Krait series is the Rift Alliance\'s
primary fighter from 5631 AD through 5650 AD.

                      The Krait Series of Fighters

FA-5A Krait  FH-0606G81-000000-00004-0 MCr175.25 90 tons
bearing                            1   Crew=1.
batteries                          1   TL=13(14).
Cargo=.41. Fuel=7.49. EP=14.4. Agility=6.

Notes: Has bridge, stateroom. Uses NH3 fuel system and multi-turret system.

Although the FA-5A needs only one pilot, it can (and often did) carry an ER
missile gunner to direct long range fire from other ships.

The FA-5A version, generally known as the Krait-A, was built as a stopgap
measure. The NFN needed a heavy fighter to replace the FA-2B Asp, so they
initiated development of the 90-ton Krait. During development, St. Hilaire
announced the afterburning powerplant, which immediately became a requirement
for the NFN\'s new fighter. Unfortunately, the new powerplant couldn\'t be used
for a fighter until it went into mass production, and in addition Neubayern
had to finish development on the acceleration tanks that would let crews
function under very high G-loads.

The NFN\'s Fighter Design Bureau decided to go ahead and construct 1,250
Kraits of the pre-afterburner design, which would then be refited with
afterburners and acceleration tanks when they became available. These
fighters all saw action in the Serendip War, and were split up among the safe
worlds at the beginning of the Imperial Occupation. As new Krait versions
entered service, the original fighters were upgraded, and most of the
original Krait-A airframes are still in service in 5650.

FA-5B Streak Krait  FH-0606(C)N81-000000-00004-0 MCr185.45 90 tons
bearing                                      1   Crew=1.
batteries                                    1   TL=12(15).
Fuel=19.96. EP=19.8. Agility=6(12).

Notes: Has bridge, stateroom, NH3 fuel system, enhanced output maneuver
drive, afterburning power plant, multi-turret system. When using afterburners
it can accelerate up to 12G and has an agility of 12, although in practice
10G/agility 10 is enough to avoid damage. It has a 9.66 ton fuel supply for
the afterburners. Like the Krait-A, an ER missile gunner was sometimes
carried.

The Krait-B is what the Fighter Design Bureau had in mind for the Krait
program when they learned of the new drive systems. Several thousand
Krait-B\'s were built on the safe worlds during early years of the Occupation,
and they saw some action in skirmishes with the Imperial Navy ships besieging
their bases. During these skirmishes, the Krait-B\'s avoided using their
afterburners to keep the technology\'s existence secret. Despite this
restriction, the Krait-B performed admirably.

By 5634, production of TL15 computers had increased to the point where they
could be used in fighters. Neubayern\'s Fighter Design Bureau, which was
sitting out the Occupation at Station Omega, was called upon to design a new
Krait version incorporating the new technology.

FA-5C Super Krait  FH-0606(C)R91-000000-00004-0 MCr223.14 90 tons
bearing                                     1   Crew=2.
batteries                                   1   TL=12(15).
Fuel=14.96. EP=22.8. Agility=6(12). 50 XO racks.

Notes: Has bridge, stateroom, NH3 fuel system, enhanced output maneuver
drive, afterburning power plant, multi-turret system, anti-missile fire
control. Afterburner performance is the same as the Krait-B, but with only
3.1 tons of fuel. An ER missile gunner is now a standard crew member.

The Fighter Design Bureau decided that in addition to the new computer, they
would rework the basic Krait to include all the new technology. They outdid
themselves.

In the past fighters had been limited by their small armament to engaging
escorts and civilian shipping, but could not take on cruisers or larger
unless thousands attacked a single cruiser. The Krait-C\'s XO racks changed
that forever. Now, only one or two hundred fighters could attack a cruiser,
and expect to cripple it with one salvo (which is, of course, all the
fighters had).

In addition, the anti-missile fire control dramatically increased the
effectiveness of fighters as point defense weapons, an idea that the NFN had
experimented with before the Occupation. Krait-C\'s carried by escort carriers
and _Tisiphone_ class destroyers proved very effective in defending Alliance
fleets from incoming missile fire.

Krait-C\'s saw extensive use throughout the Cluster Liberation War. Although
their sterling performance in the major battles was overshadowed in the media
by the exploits of "super ships" like the _Sol Bianca_, they actually did
more damage to the Imperial Navy. In particular, the Krait-C squadrons (and
the carriers and destroyers that transported them) bore much of the burden of
the clean-up campaign.

Following the defeat of the last organized Imperial force in the Islands at
the Battle of New Colchis, the Alliance Navy\'s heavy ships were all withdrawn
to Amondiage and sent off on the campaign that led to the Battle of
Pamraeltan. With the big ships gone, it was left to the few _Tisiphone_
squadrons and escort carriers to chase down the hundred or so Imperial
warships still in the Cluster. These stragglers ranged in size from escorts
up to heavy cruisers, and represented a real threat to civilian shipping.

FAdm Olson, the officer left in charge of the Cluster, spread her force out
with a destroyer squadron or an escort carrier to each system. These small
forces managed to destroy or cripple many of the stragglers, and the
survivors had either surrendered or managed to escape the Cluster by the time
the main fleet returned. A particularly noteworthy incident occured in the
Sturgeon\'s Law system when a squadron of Krait-C\'s caught up with two
Imperial light cruisers that had been raiding freighters. The squadron
commander split his fire, hoping to cripple the cruisers\' engineering
sections before they could escape. One cruiser was temporarily put out of
action, but escaped before a destroyer could arrive to capture it. The other
cruiser blew up instantly, and Ensign Juliette Romanova went into the
Alliance history books as the first fighter pilot to score a cruiser kill in
over 3500 years.

Shortly after the Krait-C entered service, a trainer version was ordered. The
FA-5D Krait gave up its stateroom for a second set of controls which could
override the first, and an additional ton of fuel. The Krait-D remains in
service in 5650, with around 250 built over the years.

At around the same time, the Amondiage Navy used the Krait-C as the basis for
the MD-1 Mjolnir planetbuster missile. The Mjolnir carries a 5 ton antimatter
warhead and lots of extra fuel in place of the bridge and stateroom, and also
does away with the XO racks. Mjolnirs can be piloted remotely (and usually
are, from an escorting fighter) or launched on internal control. Mjolnirs are
capable of up to 50G thrust, but still have a maximum agility of 12. The
Mjolnir can be carried by any ship with an ER missile magazine if necessary,
but only heavy battlecruisers and battleships would carry them normally. It
was a Mjolnir missile that destroyed the Imperial flagship at Pamraeltan. In
5650, an unknown number of Mjolnirs have been built--the Alliance Navy
refuses to discuss how many there are or where they are located.

The Krait-C remained the primary Alliance Navy fighter for ten years. By the
mid 5640\'s, the Council\'s policy of strongly encouraging Fteirle imigration
was beginning to pay off. Fteirle males were entering the Alliance Navy\'s
fighter program in ever increasing numbers--a trend which exposed a hidden
weakness of the acceleration tanks then used for G-compensation. When they
were developed, nobody expected that the fighters and ships carrying them
would ever have crewmembers who weren\'t human. It turned out that they not
fit people with alien builds, and in addition something in the liquid
irritated Fteirle skin.

The Alliance Navy\'s Fighter Design Bureau decided that rather than refitting
a fighter with new accomodations every time the crew changed, or imposing
limits on who can crew what fighters, they would design a new variant. The
FA-5E Super Krait is identical to the Krait-C in performance, but allows
acceleration tanks and crew accomodations to be altered in around fifteen
minutes at negligible cost, thus ensuring that field commanders would never
have to worry about incompatabilty between fighters and crews. Existing
Krait-C\'s were upgraded to the new design (although it was decided that it
was simpler to refit Krait-D\'s as Fteirle-specific trainers), and over
100,000 Krait-E\'s were eventually built.

In 5650, the Krait-E is still by far the most numerous fighter in the
Alliance Navy, and large numbers have been sold to System Fleets within the
Alliance and to close allies. The first antimatter powered FA-6 Cobra joined
the fleet in 5650, and will eventually replace the older Kraits, but this
will take years.

Technology Notes: Most of the new technology used in the Krait series (NH3
fuel, etc.) simply makes components more compact without affecting how they
work. The anti-missile fire control lets a missile battery act as a repulsor
battery 3 factors weaker. The Krait\'s XO racks let each fighter fire the
equivalent of a Missile-A salvo once before rearming. The acceleration tanks
compensate for 12Gs of acceleration, letting the crews function normally
under full thrust.

Marines=150. 25,000 XO Racks.
                             Y=40, Z=50
Notes: Uses beam lasers, particle accelerator is APAWS. Has NH3 fuel system,
enhanced output maneuver drive, H-C overdrive, afterburning plant,
superconducting armour, anti-missile fire control. Has a 1-tonne AM
containment pod. Has ten shield bays, 1500 ton missile magazine (500
battery-rounds), 80 ER missile gunners, 2 30-ton small craft, 5 90-ton
planetbusters, 12 parsecs jump fuel.

Technology: This class mounts a factor ten shield (the first of the two
"sand" factors). This operates the same way as a Star Cruiser screen. Each
factor can absorb fire from one directed-energy (but not meson) battery per
turn, for 30 factors of absorption in this class. The XO racks hold the
equivalent of 500 Missile-A salvoes. An Antimatter Particle Accelerator
Weapon System (APAWS) is based on a PA, but does 1 surface explosion, 2
radiation, and destroys one armour factor for each factor by which the APAWS
factor exceeds its target\'s hull size (_not_ reduced by armour) until the
target is stripped of armour. Then, it does one surface, 3 radiation, and one
critical hit for the same period. Superconducting armour halves damage from
lasers and nukes.

The planetbuster launch bay is part of a shell game. The Alliance doesn\'t
have anywhere near enough of them to fill the bays on the battleships, even,
so they shuffle them around instead to keep enemys confused.

The _Nagumo Chuichi_ and several others of the class were built during the
Imperial Occupation and served in the CLW. The XO racks and ER missiles had
been kept more or less hidden from the Imperials up to that time, and so the
capabilities of this class came as a shock. A squadron of eight Nagumo-class
ships have a throw weight in their opening salvo comparable to 20
Tigress-class battleships--when told what was being fired at them, some
Imperial commanders simply refused to believe it.

The Nagumo Chuichi-class is one of the Alliance Navy\'s most important ships
following the CLW. There are few heavier ships stationed on the frontiers, so
when the Alliance Navy brings in capital ships to deal with some crisis it\'s
almost always the Nagumo-class that is called. Several squadrons took part in
the Sarage and Quiver Campaigns, and performed admirably.

Not all of the missions assigned to the Nagumo Chuichi-class involve combat,
however. The ships are more commonly seen patrolling Alliance space, engaging
in diplomatic missions, exploring new territory, protecting commerce, and
participating in aid missions.

In 5649 much of Third Fleet, including all of its battlecruisers, was turned
over to shipyards for refit with M/ARA in anticipation of the ready
availability of antimatter. In 5650 these ships have just left yard hands and
are undergoing their post-refit shakedowns.

    'body' => 'Yo,
 As many of the long-timers out there have
had the chance to observe I have continued to produce
a number of traveller tools, mainly for system generation.
Well, I\'m still upgrading the SYSGEN stuff to Windows
but the pressures of my new job has meant this is taking
much longer than when I could do traveller work between
9 & 5 :-).
 Anyhow, in a similar situation a few years ago
I was involved developing the Fantasy Realm of a
Multi-User Dungeon but due to the phone company
quintupling the rates (seriously) I could not dial in
in the evening when the MUD was on-line. So I got a bunch
of interested students (who more or less lived in the
terminal room :-) together and did a sort of remote
group management structure. I would generate high-level
specs, one of them would pick it up and implement it,
I would pop in now and again and check it out and do QA.
 So, I am interested in setting up something similar
here. Let me propose a sort of project plan. Those who are
interested (as either producers or consumers) can contribute
comments and if everyone (or enough) is happy we can make
a start of it.

PROPOSAL
 The Traveller Tools Group; a group for producing
utility Traveller software and tools others can use for
the use of writing their own utilities.

DELIVERABLES
 The output of the group will fill into three levels.
 On one level will be libraries of utility routines
in static and dynamic link libraries. The next level would
be libraries of UI objects for creating, viewing, and editing
objects of the first level. Lastly, applications would be
produced using those UI elements to perform some functionality.
 Documentation and examples will be provided with the
releases.

COMPATIBILITY
 Each area of production would have its compatibility
defined at design stage. Where multiple standards can be
maintained (i.e. Class, MegaTraveller, TNE) they should be
done or if not the structures should be implemented in such a
way that the additional areas could be written when someone
becomes available who is interested in expanding them to
that level.
 Although the drive should be towards being compatible
with official GDW rules the emphasis should be on tailorability
and, ideally, many of the processes should be table driven so
that the end-user can configure them as they wish.
 [My main desire is for MegaTraveller compatibility and
upward compatibility with previous SYSGEN stuff.]

SCHEDULE
 The schedule should be largely driven by who volunteers
for which pieces. As there is already a large code-base for
system generation that would probably come first.
 Other areas: trade, character generation, ship generation,
floorplan construction.

IMPLEMENTATION
 Releases will be produced for the Microsoft Visual C++
compiler [negotiable, if enough volunteers wish to support
another compiler, lets discuss]. Static libraries of level
one deliverables will be produced for those who wish to
construct DOS applications. DLLs will be produced for Windows
development. Level two deliverables will all be for Windows.
Possibly as VBXs. Level three will, ideally, be MFC apps.

ROLES
 Co-ordinator  Someone to co-ordinate and organise
    the efforts [probably me]
 Architects  People to design the objects and
    interfaces of each bit. Co-ordination
    between the architects will be managed
    by either the co-ordinator or else a
    chief architect.
 Implementors People to volunteer to implement specs

Those of us on the list who are not privy to the details of the highly
customized refinements of the TCS crowd would appreciate a rundown
of the non-standard technology listed in the _Nagumo_ class.  Standard HG
charts with TL, cost, mass, etc.

I have always felt that the level of tech displayed in Traveller is not consistent
with what one would expect after 3000 years.  "Long Night"s not
withstanding.  However, it is difficult to retrofit the design sequence with
new toys while retaining game balance.  One must either assume a higher TL
for the new item (which may not be consistent with its materials and
complexity.), or assume that the new item was previously
undiscovered/depends on newly discovered material like "dilithium"/<insert
favorite plot crutch here>

Additionally, a truly potent new technology will spread like wildfire as old
ships are refitted.  This is especially true of weapons tech.  I suspect the
_Nagumo_ will not enjoy its advanatge for long.

There is one nit I will pick.  This designed can hardly be classified as a
High Guard design with all of these new items.  Perhaps we should call it a
TCS design instead.

    'body' => 'Here\'s a summary of the new technology used by the ships I\'ve been
posting--thanks to Andy St. John for prompting me to undertake this
long-delayed project.

This file contains technology used by designs completed so far. It does not
contain everything the Alliance has developed, nor does it contain technology
that has not had rules written for it yet. Those things will be added in
latter versions, and some technology included here may be changed.

Each technology listing includes the name, official tech level, and year
developed (or 5631 if it was in service at the end of Steve\'s PBEM game).
Year developed is not necessarily the same as year entering service--much of
the AM technology didn\'t see much use until around 5650.

Enhanced Output Maneuver Drive (TL15/5631 AD):
Designed like normal M-Drive but with 80% normal size, 125% normal cost, and
125% normal crew.

Afterburning Power Plant (TL15/5631 AD):
Includes fusion rocket as part of power plant. Design like normal plant, but
cost is MCr5 per ton. Designer chooses amount of additional thrust to be
generated--this thrust is limited by fuel and crew endurance. Endurance on
afterburner is calculated as follows:

      endurance (hours) = ln(((ship displacement) + (9.6 * fuel tonnage
allocated to afterburner)) / (ship displacement)) * (225 / acceleration due
to afterburner in Gs)

Laser Bay (TL13/5631 AD):
50 ton Pulse Laser Bay          50 ton Beam Laser Bay
  40 EP/Factor 8                  40 EP/Factor A
  60 EP/Factor 9                  60 EP/Factor B

100 ton Pulse Laser Bay         100 ton Beam Laser Bay
  80 EP/Factor A                  80 EP/Factor C
 100 EP/Factor B                 100 EP/Factor D

Cost is the same as a Particle Accelerator Bay of the same size.

Laser Spinal Mount (TL13/5631 AD):
Type      Tonnage        Pulse Factor     Beam Factor
Light      1000T              E               J

SuperHvy  12000T              V               W

Cost and \'To Hit\' is as for PA mount of same factor. Cost for SuperHeavy
mounts is:
Laser-V, MCr2250; Laser-W, MCr1686

NH3 Fuel System (TL14/5631 AD):
Uses ammonia as fuel--it is run through a special refinery before use,
splitting it into nitrogen and hydrogen. The NH3 takes up 52% of the space
required by hydrogen fuel. The refinery costs double the normal amount. Also,
a jump-capable ship using NH3 needs a special refinery to process the jump
fuel. This special refinery is ten times the normal size (and costs double
the normal amount as well).

Missile-A Bay (TL14/5631 AD):
An ordinary 100-ton missile bay built at TL14.

Acceleration Tank (TL12/5632 AD):
Allows crews on high-thrust ships to function. Compensates 12Gs with
oxygenated flourocarbons (a breathable liquid). A tank using oxygen
compensates 2G--this is what\'s included in TNE. No extra cost or tonnage.

Antimatter Warhead (TL18/5631 AD):
Acts just like a normal nuclear warhead, but is unaffected by nuclear
dampers. Each missile requires 1g of antimatter.

Antimatter Particle Accelerator Weapon System (TL18/5636 AD):
Design as a normal PA of any size. Does 1 surface hit, 2 radiation hits, and
destroys one armour factor per factor by which APAWS exceeds the target\'s
size code. Once the target\'s armour is gone, it does 1 surface hit, 3
radiation hits, and 1 critical hit for the same increment. Uses 10g of
antimatter per shot.

Matter/Antimatter Reaction Assembly (TL18/5634 AD):
Design like normal power plant. Percent of ship required for a plant of Pn
size is: 0.0185Pn, cost is MCr6.75/ton, consumes 8.75kg per EP generated per
year of antimatter.

Antimatter Jump Drive (TL18/5649 AD):
Design as normal jump drive. Fuel consumption per ton per parsec jumped is
100g antimatter and 100g normal matter.

ER Missile (TL13/5631 AD):
Capable of engaging targets beyond sensor range (out to 3 million km).
Requires an "ER missile gunner" crewmember aboard a unit within normal combat
range of target to provide guidance, one gunner per ER missile battery. One
battery-round of ER missiles requires 1.5T for 50T battery, 3T for 100T
battery. No extra cost.

Multi-Turret/Multi-Bay System (TL13/5631 AD):
Allows a craft to carry turrets or bays beyond the normally allowed number.
Each extra turret or bay takes twice the normal tonnage.

Oversize Bay (TL13/5631 AD):
Allows bays more powerful than the normal maximum to be built. For each extra
factor, double size, cost, and power consumption.

Meson Weapon (TL11/5644 AD):
These are included because the Islands Cluster didn\'t have meson technology
originally.

Kinetic Energy Missile (TL7/5633 AD):
Acts like nuclear warhead but unaffected by dampers or superconducting
armour. To hit penalty of -2.

Planetbuster Drone (TL18/5631 AD):
Designed like an unmanned fighter with an antimatter warhead requiring
5T/MCr100. To hit penalty -6 for early models, a hit destroys any ship.

Project Starburst (TL14/5646 AD):
Turn gas giants into small stars, or trigger flares (like Darrian) in
existing stars. Requires three meson guns firing in concert, each 100,000T
requiring 50,000EP.

Ablative Armour (TL14/5633 AD):
Each point of ablative armour counts in combat as 5 points of armour, one
point burns away with each hit.

Helson-Canomaar Overdrive (TL15/5636 AD):
Design as normal jump drive with double normal price, divide fuel requirement
by ten. H-C Overdrive may not be combined with an NH3 Fuel System (although a
ship can still use NH3 for its power plant) or Antimatter Jump Drive.

Antimatter Production Facility, Mark I (TL18/5631 AD):
Design as normal fusion power plant. Produces 15 grams of antimatter per EP
per year.

Antimatter Production Facility, Mark II (TL18/5650 AD):
Build as "habitat" from JTAS orbiting a gas giant. Size required is torus
with 150m cross section, outer diamter 10% larger than gas giant. Production
is 1 million tons of antimatter per year. Cost approximately MCr30 million.

Antimatter Production Facility, Mark III (TL18/5660(?) AD):
As above, but orbiting Gloire supernova remnant. Cost unknown, production 100
million tons of antimatter per year when completed.

Antimatter Containment Vessel (TL18/5631 AD):
Holds a ship\'s supply of antimatter safely. Each 1 tonne of AM contained
requires 1T/MCr3.

Shield (TL14/5638 AD):
Works by expelling a thick cloud of "sand" which is then suspended in a
magnetic field around the ship. Each shield unit generates one shield factor.
Units are built into 50T bays, cost MCr15, and require 5EP. Each shield
factor blocks three batteries of directed-energy fire before burning away.
Shields regenerate automatically every turn.

External Ordnance Rack (TL12/5633 AD):
Cost is MCr.1 per rack, 50 XO racks are equal to a single round of fire from
a Missile-A bay.

Antimissile Fire Control (TL13/5631 AD):
Allows a missile battery to fire defensively, acting as a repulsor battery 3
factors weaker. No cost.

Superconducting Armour (TL14/5635 AD):
Halves damage from lasers, nuclear and AM warheads. First point of armour
costs double.

Sure, that sounds interesting.  I\'d prefer to use the Borland 4.0

Low=67. Cargo=245. Fuel=2235. EP=1414. Agility=6(8). Marines=41. 1000 XO
racks.

Notes: Uses beam lasers. Has scoops, plant, two computers. Has enhanced
output maneuver drive, afterburning power plant, H-C overdrive, NH3 fuel
system, anti-missile fire control, superconducting armour. Has 15 parsecs
jump fuel, 15 ER missile gunners, 120 ton missile magazine (40
battery-rounds), 1 tonne antimatter containment pod. Carries 1 30-ton small
craft and 5 90-ton fighters. The XO racks hold 20 battery-rounds.

The Tisiphone-class can reach 12Gs maximum, but normally has only enough
power to sustain agility 8. However, if four of the laser bays cease fire,
the ship can reach its maximum agility of 12.

The fighters are used as part of an integrated point-defence network. One
fighter can be launched per turn. As of 5650, the FA-5E Super Krait is the
only fighter that has been carried by this class.

The Tisiphone-class destroyer was developed as a result of a NFN project to
improve fleet defence. Starting in the late 5620\'s, the NFN began conducting
experiments to determine the feasibility of using fighters as point-defence
weapons. The fighters of the day weren\'t up to the task, but with the
development of afterburners the project became much more practical.

By the time the _Tisiphone_ was laid down following the CLW, the FA-5C was in
service. The high agility and anti-missile capabilities of the Krait-C made
it very well suited to the point-defence role. Since the CLW, hundreds of
destroyers have been built for the Alliance Navy. The class has seen service
in both the Sarage and Quiver Campaigns, and also patrols many frontier
systems looking for pirates and smugglers.

First: Thank you Steve Bonneville for sending the Core data!  I\'d download
       it here, but SOME people have to pay (gasp) for their e-mail...

Second: A few questions on the Core data...

        a) The data for Reference is D100100-B.  Why is there so few
people on Reference? I mean, this system is important enough to be on all
the \'Charted Space\' maps, but there are only 30 people!
           (And, if Reference was just a astrological point of
measurement, why Reference?  wouldn\'t Capital make a better choice?)
       
        b) Double Star (Core 0635) has only a _single_ star!  Yes, I know
his is nitpicking, but nits are to pick, after all.  Is there an \'offical\'
explanation for this?

Third: Thanks to Rodge Sanger (spelled from memory), I finally got a copy
       of the World Builder\'s Guide!  Horray! 

O.K., now on to the show...

  First: has anyone generated a "home system" for the Scouts?  Or, should I
say, where the largest Scout bases are (Perhaps in the Glimmerdrift
Reaches?)  

Second: Speaking of "culture centres"; Noble culture would be centered at
        Core, and \'archetypical\' Imperial Noble societies at

                           * Capital   2118  A586A98-F (Sylean, too)
(Incidentally, all 25 Sylean Ase       2219  B22098B-F

Capital, Khuir (Core 2513,   Irlu      0428  B53598C-F

                             Unlakhar  3040  B629997-G 

So, that\'s about 19 systems.  Most of the nobility, power, and decisions of
the Third Imp. would originate from here, with Capital taking a major
chunk of the whole.  
   
Third: The Imperial Military\'s patron was the sister of Strephon (if I
remember it right: what\'s her name again?).  Who was (ahem, _is_) the patron 
of the IISS?

Fourth: from the WBGuide: "To date, the Imperium considers such clones
[clones with the memory\'s of the original] to be quite illegal, since this
is \'tampering with the mind of a sentient lifeform, similar in concept to
psionics\' according to a ruling made by Emperor Paulo III in 1070"

Huh?  I knew that the Emperor had military and economic powers, but
judicial ones too?  Well, O.K... but no more Imperial suprises, or I\'ll
start wondering just how centralized IS the Third Imperium!

Also: how does the Emperor make these decisions?  By committe, who makes
it in his name? This seems plausable, but against my gut instinct.

By doing his homework, and then making his call? This seems likely.  But
now we have a single wo/man who has to be _at least_ compotent in the
fields of Macro-Macro economics, 
          BIG TIME Sociology, 
          Domain-wide Naval Strategy, and
          multi-racial, imperium-wide legal concepts.

(can you imagine Clinton I on the throne?  Oh, dear...) 

How many doctorates does Stephon _have_, anyways?

Even with the best of 10 trillion beings behind him, that\'s quite a load on
his shoulders...

Fifth: "Under no circumstances is the first open contact to be made with
weapons visible."  And which (beep) Imperial BUREAUCRAT made up THIS rule?
                   (and did anyone tell RCES?  giggle...giggle...)

    'from' => 'Steven M Bonneville',
    'body' => 'Since I opened this can of worms, let\'s see if I can help 
figure it out (with out mixing more metaphors).

A)  Reference

It\'s in TD #10.  Mainly, it has a low *permanent* population since
most of the rock is filled with thousands of computer systems in
vaccuum chambers.  DGP claims that historically it was a Vilani
research station that the IGS picked as a data repository and 
astrographic datum point for their baselines.  I figure it must 
be an M star with a nearly circular galactic orbit at the right
distance.  The usage must be traditional, sice the First Survey
took place after the sector boundaries were originally set, as far
as I can tell.  M stars last a heck of a long time, so it would
be a better choice than something brighter.  Note that it is in
hex 0140 -- the lower left corner of Core sector; this suggests
that the rimward and spinward boundaries of Core are the original
Imperial Grand Survey baselines.

B) Double Star

The stellar data in that Core sector file seems to be faulty.
Don\'t trust it.  The star for Capital is clearly wrong.

C) IISS Patron

Empress Iolanthe, in particular (Strephon\'s wife).  I forget
where this was mentioned, but it was one of the CT adventure
library data sections.

D) The Emperor

Marc Miller once wrote an article mentioning the "Office of the
Emperor".  This isn\'t just the Emperor, but all the advisors,
functionaries, courtiers, and bureaucrats that directly help
him execute his offices.  There\'s plenty of room in the 1 km
Imperial Palace for legions of them.  That\'s not counting the
IN offices buried in the complex *under* the Palace.

Strephon\'s two biggest skills?  Administration and Leader.
That\'s his job, to coordinate the government, and elicit the
best advice, since no person could possibly know it all.
He knows some history, linguistics, and has some skill in
persuasion as well.  For that matter, Norris has similar
skills, except he has training in law and naval strategy.
Both possess skills appropriate to their specific jobs.
Even Norris\' job is quite a load, let alone Strephon\'s, but
somebody has to try to execute the jobs.

If you haven\'t read Silverberg\'s "Lord Valentine" trilogy,
I recommend them.  There\'s a scene in _Valentine Pontifex_
that this discussion reminds me of.  If the Imperial 
bureaucracy and nobility can\'t be relied on in general,
there isn\'t a lot the Emperor can do to fix it.  That\'s 
part of why the penalties and restrictions on the crimes
of nobles tend to be more dramatic -- they have more 
responsibilities to live up to.  The emperor need to be
able to distinguish bad advice from good, and weed out the
bad advisors from the good in his or her staff. 

Note that the Office of the Emperor is different from the
Imperial Household, which involves other members of the
Alkhalikoi family and their staff.

Well, the scout courier handles unrefined fuel (ie. it has a purification
plant and scoops).  The xboat, not having the maneuver drives necessary
to scoop fuel, doesn\'t handle it.  The express boat tender doesn\'t have
any equipment to handle unrefined fuel.

Yeah, it\'s true. Introductory adventure "The Imperial Fringe" p14 states the
scout/courier can. Anyway, think about it - an exploratory ship (designed to
"go

ain\'t going to get far! Only a very few special designs out of the dozens

Reference was the astrographic baseline for the First Imperium, being
conveniently near-centrally situated; the Second and Third Imperia didn\'t
change this.

The textbook definition of an empire is "a political arrangement in which one
state (the metropole) exerts complete control over the internal and external
affairs of all other member states (the periphery)".  The Emperor can
interfere
in *any* aspect of *any* world or group of worlds in the Imperium; he just
doesn\'t (usually).  This is why an Imperial Warrant is so powerful.

Why do you think Dulinor got his knickers in a twist and decided to rub
Strephon out? Whatever else Dulinor may be/have been/whatever, he is/was/will
be an extraordinarily educated and brilliant person.  At least in *my* game.

Regarding the Core Data:

I don\'t want to start e-mailing copies out, for two good reasons:

1) I don\'t have time for it, and
2) The copyright situation is just uncertain enough right now that
   I don\'t want to mess with it.  We had clear permission to have
   those files on the ftp sites from DGP, who apparently created 
   them in the first place.  (See discussion with GDW currently on
   the main list about what\'s going on with Internet and their
   evolving take on electronic media.  So far, seems reasonable.
   YMMV.)

However, last I checked, those files from sunbane were still on
the ftp server at ghost.cc.missouri.edu.  I suggest you look there.
The ftp site maintainers have a much better handle on all this
than I do.  Beware: some of those files are known to be faulty.

Actually, I can\'t stand the OWL classes.  I use a different class 
library entirely (the Liant one, if you\'re interested).  However, this
shouldn\'t be a problem if your specs include the header files for the
needed Microsoft C++ classes.  I\'ll write my stuff using my classes
and then convert my code (or just stick in a compiler check in an
#ifdef).  Testing, though, will be a problem.

Yes.  IF UNREFINED FUEL IS WATER.

BUT - Unrefined fuel is NOT water.  Refined fuel is hydrogen
only.  Unrefined fuel is mostly hydrogen with those inevitable, and
never-to-be-sufficiently-damned impurities (minerals, trace elements,
and other plot devices) that you scoop up when you skim a gas
giant\'s atmosphere (or take on fuel that has been so acquired).

To turn WATER into fuel you must run an electrical current through
it, SEPARATING the Hydrogen from the Oxygen, then eject (or
store for later use) the Oxygen.  What you\'re left with is Hydrogen,
Minerals, Trace Elements, etc ----> Unrefined fuel.  That can be
refined if you have the right equipment.

Note that you have to be careful separating the Hydrogen from
the Oxygen.  You have to make sure that they STAY separate.
(By default, they will try to recombine into water, giving back the
energy used to separate them in the form of a kaboom.  No
"spark" is required for  this.)

There may be other ways of separating the H from the O in water,
I just don\'t  happen to know them.  Additionally, there may be
higher tech means of separating the elements that nobody knows
about (yet).

   A big question, (and an intentional weak point in several of
GDW games) would be the actual technical limitations of
building, outfitting and staffing starships.  If there is some
bottle neck such that there were on both Kafer and human sides
a limited number of ship yards "capable" of building ships,
a major goal of "attrition" wwould be to destroy them.
  If (IMHO more realistic) a space ship factory could be
built almost anyplace in an industrial zone, the battle becomes
harder, as the society has to be broken down.
   Both 2300 AD and Traveller treat starships like historical
large marine ship construction and ignore the kinds of technical
skills developed around WWII for mass producing aircraft and
smaller ships like destroyers and pt boats.  I don\'t
think it is appreciated what a planetary "war footing" productive
system would be like just with todays technologies, much less 
what we will have after 350 years of "doing computers and robots"

  Visualize if you wish, an automated "astroidal" or "space habitate"
factory capable of producing one fully outfitted "military starship"
per hour.  As a production line, this might a thousand  in the
"pipeline".  The scale of this "factory" is equivalent to
say OakRidge or todays Boing Corp.      
   Think  of a mostly automated factory space, (to hold a thousand
300 meter by 100 meter diameter ships) 10 tunnels, each 300 meters
wide, 600 meters tall and 4 km long)
  It might be a great place for a scenario.

  At the same time as "fighting ships" were being built, I would

   1. large numbers of communication runner ships

        [...] two or three  starship assembly lines
would be up and running, we can take a moderate view and
say these will produce a starship every week or two  or
be technologic optimists and consider 1 per hour, (or faster)
 24 per day, 700+ per month.  assume crews of 100 per ship,
this is not even a big mobilization of military manpower.
Continue this for a couple years and you have the
interesting situation of 20,000 ships and a modest
military (assume 3 to 1 support/active duty)of
8 million.  (this is well below todays earth with
several countries having militaries of around a million
)
   IMHO, while running a large starship and fleet
may be like running this centuries capital fleets,
the production and scales of 2300 would be more like
the aircraft for large and medium space craft.

Re: Cultural/Ethnic Diversity in the Imperium

I think it is there.  I believe that in various planets, you have 
more of an Ethnic concentration of one sort or another. Note: that\'s 
concentration, not sole example. For example, on Zhonguo, ethnic chinese
features probably dominate - but not entirely.  Do remember
that a  major chunk of the Imperium\'s population are ethnic Vilani 
(who look a lot like caucasians).  Some have galanglicized names - 
done as a way to get ahead in a Terran/Sylean dominated Imperium. 
Given a few centuries and some interbreeding, who would know the
difference?

For that matter, I\'d wager that further back, during Terra\'s 
expansion into the second Imperium, an amount of Anglicizing took 
place among those who wanted their parents to get ahead within the
(apparently) US or British dominated administration. So, a chunk of
the "Smith", "Jones", or "McIntyre" families, if you go far enough
back into the past (3000 years or so) may have been named Schmidt, Zhong, or
Makatira.

I\'d imagine that the color issue kind of pales a bit when you start
dealing with "We of Terra vs all those others."  Or, at least, 
that\'s the face turned to others... To my mind, the lack of ethnic
description and the lack of religious discussion at all are ways of 
not stepping on toes or getting cultural statements in the way of 
the adventuring.  Makes a good marketing decision.

Re: Power armor

Output: I\'d believe that the output would be a set number for each
suit. The owner\'s strength would merely operate the waldos.  
Consistent output allows any average set of men to become supermen.
It also provides the commander of a unit of battledress troops with
constant, known troop capabilities.

Stopability: BD is stopable.  Why else would there still be vehicles
at TL14/15 if BD was unstopable? BD is an advantage, but only that.
BD troops hurt by TL6 weapons (or TL2 catapults)? Certainly. However,
they have a number of advantages that allow them to hurt the lower
tech opponents before thay can be hurt. They take casualties in minisule
proportions.  But none? Nope.  They are not invulnerable.
And remember that your PCs invariably fight in small unit actions...

In 5FW, high tech units (presumably in BD) take a very long time to fall
when attacked by lower tech units; it seems to me that the same result
obtains in Invasion:Earth.  TL15+ units are also very difficult to bombard
effectively (see 5FW).  So it looks like they are just hard to kill.

What are probable doctrines for BD use?  Commandoes (Zhodani teleport
commandos [with or without the e?] wear BD)?  Situations where the BD troops
will be outnumbered by weakly armed (relatively) forces?  Or where insertion
of BD troops will force the defenders to turn important assets to tacking
tackling those troops, which will thus have importance out of proportion to
their number?

I don\'t have any problems with your melee weapon idea:  it is science
fiction.  U.S. Marines are very high tech troops today, and they\'re  trained
to use bayonets, knives, and even their entrenching tools as weapons.  Maybe
a bonded superdense titanium/vanadium edged cutlass in a Marine\'s
powered-armored hands would be a meaningful weapon in a close-quarters fight
(like on shipboard, where you might not want to fire plasma guns or RAM
grenades, to avoid damaging what you\'re trying to take or defend).

Cost-ineffective to arm BD troops with energy weapons?  Maybe not; you\'re
trying to protect your investment in the armor, too.

Kill all or no harm to any:  That, it seems from my reading, is often how
the world works (I do my level best to avoid finding out first hand).

Here\'s a (very brief) summary:

The Alliance is an outgrowth of a TCS pbem game Steve Higginbotham ran. The
game was based on the "Island Cluster" from the TCS book, which is located in
subsectors J and K of the Reft Sector. In the pbem game, the Alliance was
formed by group of countries in the Old Islands subsector (Reft K), plus a
small one from the New Islands (Reft J). After several years of game time,
the game ended in 5631 AD (1110 Imperial). At this time, the Serendip Belt,
one of the major non-Alliance powers, kicked off a major war which drove most
of the other countries into the Alliance, and cost over 10 billion lives
(including almost all the Serendip Belt folks).

At this time the pbem game ended, with Steve indicating that the Imperium was
about to send the whole Corridor Fleet in to annex the Cluster. At the time
the game ended, Amondiage, a non-Alliance (but friendly) country, had been
fighting a war with the Imperium--and winning, up to that point. When the
Amondiage Navy destroyed Cyril (the local Imperial capital) with an
antimatter bomb, the Emperor himself stepped in and decided to annex the
whole Cluster.

I\'d previously decided that the background being developed in the pbem game
was much more interesting (not to mention believeable) than that "Virus"
crap, so I decided to work out what happened next. I\'ve set a "start date" of
5650 AD (1129 Imperial) for role-playing campaigns set in this background,
and have been working along with others from the game (mostly Steve) to work
out the "future" of the Alliance. So far, it goes something like this:

The Alliance in 5631 doesn\'t have any hope of beating the Corridor Fleet. The
Alliance and Amondiage (which was by that time almost a de facto member) had
an extremely active R&D community, and had developed or were in the process
of developing technology that would give their ships a big advantage over the
Imperium. Unfortunately, most of the new technology was at best only in the
prototype stage. To buy time, the Alliance and Amondiage decided to pretend
surrender to the Corridor Fleet.

Three worlds in the Old Islands (New Home, Sansterre, and Amondiage) had
defenses capable of holding back even a major Imperial attack for many years.
These three became the "safe worlds." All the new technology was moved to
these worlds, along with the Alliance\'s best ships and personnel, and all
records of the new technology on the other worlds (and there wasn\'t much) was
either removed or destroyed. A recent addition to the Alliance, Joyeuse,
pretended to go over to the Imperium and would act as a sort of Imperial
surrogate during the Occupation.

The plan was that the safe worlds would refit the old ships with the new
technology, and build new ones. When the ships were ready, the Alliance Navy
would sortie from the safe worlds (and the Joyeuse Navy would turn on its
supposed allies) and drive out the Impies. The plan was somewhat desperate,
and had plenty of room for failure, but it was all the Alliance Council could
think of--and events elsewhere helped it work.

In the GDW history, the Corridor Fleet played a key role in driving back the
Zhodani attack on Rhylanor during the Fifth Frontier War. That didn\'t happen
here. Instead, although the Zhodani still got pushed back, their 40th Fleet
made it home intact and the Zhodani were ready for another try a few years
later. The Sixth Frontier War was only the start of the Imperium\'s troubles
though. In addition, the Solomani took grave exception to the invasion of the
Island Cluster, since it\'s the only known enclave of "ethnically pure"
Solomani anywhere in the galaxy--they expressed their disapproval by kicking
off the Second Solomani Rim War. On top of all that, the Aslan had been
skirmishing with the Imperials in the Trojan Reach for some time.

As a result of all this pressure, the Imperium withdrew most of its garrison
forces from the Islands in 5640. The local commanders had reported that the
locals where up to something, but the whole area had been quiet, there was no
proof, and the top brass were at that point more concerned about trying to
keep back the Zhodani and Solomani.

As soon as the bulk of the Imperial force withdrew, the Alliance moved. The
Cluster Liberation War was just the sort of quick and brutal onslaught that
the Alliance Navy favored, resulting in the remaining occupation forces being
crushed in less than a month. The Imperial Navy tried to counterattack with
forces drawn from Gushmege, but the Alliance had found their staging area and
hit it. The CLW ended in a total victory for the Alliance.

The Imperials could have retaken the Alliance if they\'d tried hard enough,
but they didn\'t. Doing so would have called for a massive diversion of ships
from the other fronts, which would have allowed the Zhodani and Imperium to
make substantial inroads into Imperial territory. More than that, though, the
Cluster Liberation War had broken the morale of the Imperial Navy personnel
who had been involved. The Alliance had hit them so hard, so fast, and with
such sophisticated weapons, that the Imperium had lost enough ships to make
up a Fleet without inflicting _any_ losses on their enemies. The Impies were
simply terrified of the Alliance Navy.

The Alliance told the Imperium that they wanted only to be free, and were
willing to end the war--the Emperor, with other crises demanding his Naval
resources, agreed. The Alliance had expanded after the CLW to include all the
Island CLuster systems except Topas, and slowly expanded to include some of
the systems between the Islands, the Trojan Reach, and the Riftspan Reaches.
During this period (which lasted through 5644) the Alliance Free Trade
Agreement was increasing the Alliance Navy\'s budget in leaps and bounds, and
new ships were being built. Aslan immigrants were also being invited in, with
over 300 million Aslan arriving in the first two years.

In 5645 the spinward border of the Alliance (which was technically a
federation by this point) were at Browne, the new technology was fully
implemented, and Alliance naval budget had just broken Cr40 trillion. The
Alliance Council decided to implement its long-term strategy for dealing with
the Imperium, which called for fighting (and winning) a small skirmish with
the Imperium every so often to keep the Imperial Navy afraid of the Alliance
and convinced that the Alliance was a deadly opponent. It would be a delicate
balancing act, though, because the Alliance couldn\'t push the Imperium hard
enough to start a major war (which the Alliance would lose).

The Sarage system (Trojan Reach 2938) was an Imperial client state, and held
an Imperial Naval base established to watch over the route across the
Riftspan Reaches. The Alliance wanted the system, which would complete a
route for ships equipped with Helson-Canomaar Overdrive between Island
Cluster and the main Aslan territory.

Alliance Intelligence prepared the arena by secretly meeting with the Sarage
government, telling them about the generosity of the Alliance (members
routinely tossed around huge sums to aid the development of less advanced
systems) and pointing out that the Alliance Navy could protect the system
much more effectively than the Imperium could. The goal of these preparations
was to help the locals realize they\'d be better off under the Alliance, a
goal which was reached rather easily--the Imperium didn\'t even help out its
own worlds, let alone clients.

On March 15, 5645, Alliance Navy TF11 (led by Fleet Admiral Sir Isaac Connor,
the Alliance\'s best commander) entered the system and attacked the CruRon
stationed there. The Battle of Sarage ended in 20 minutes with only Imperial
couriers escaping intact. The couriers made it to Tobia with a report on the
performance of the Alliance ships. Imperial Intelligence analyzed it, and
realized that the force seen in TF11 was more than the local forces could
handle.

A message was fired off to the HQ of the Spinward Marches Fleet, but before
any response (or help) could get back, TF11 itself showed up in orbit around
Tobia. The Imperial Navy had begun to gather forces in Tobia, but there
weren\'t enough. After establishing control over the system, FAdm Connor
delivered the Alliance\'s terms for ending the war--give up claim to Sarage,
and end the war now, and the Alliance would repatriate all prisoners, return
all ships captured intact (there were a few hulks left), and pay the
replacement cost of the dead CruRon. FAdm Connor also showed the Imperial
Duke the full planetbuster bay aboard his flagship, the _Sansterre_.

The Duke new a good offer when he saw one. Sarage wasn\'t exactly a vital
strategic interest of the Imperium, and it wasn\'t often that someone offered
to pay for ships destroyed in battle. The Sarage Campaign ended with Sarage a
new Alliance Protectorate, and the Imperial Navy once again convinced that
the Alliance people where all ten feet tall.

The Alliance continued to expand in the Trojan Reach, adding two new
Associate Members and five new Protectorates in the next two years. In 5648,
Tisilli (Trojan Reach 2137) became a full member of the Alliance--the first
high population world to join since Browne became a member in 5641. The Navy
budget had broken Cr80 trillion, and ships from the massive post-CLW building
program where joining the fleet in increasing numbers. The Imperium was
starting to get an edge over the Zhodani, and the Alliance Council decided to
start a new skirmish to keep the Impies off balance.

This one would be a bit more serious. The Alliance Navy was much stronger
now, and wanted to seriously disrupt the Imperium\'s war efforts so that the
Zhodani could regain the initiative. The target was Quiver (Reft 2534), a
world on the edge of Imperial space which had asked to become an Alliance
Protectorate. Quiver\'s people had decided that they\'d be better off as part
of the Alliance, and the Alliance hoped that helping them would make other
Imperial worlds think about seceeding.

Quiver declared its independence from the Imperium on June 8, 5648 (1127
Imperial), and requested Protectorate status from the Alliance. By
"coincidence," Alliance TF23 showed up the next day. TF23 chased the ships at
the IISS base out of the system, and settled down to wait. A courier was sent
to Vlad (the new Imperial sector capital) offering to end the war, offering
reasonably generous terms. Alliance Intelligence also allowed the Order of
Battle of TF23 (which was small, and had nothing larger than a BC) to leak,
along with information implying that the Alliance Navy wasn\'t very
enthusiastic about holding Quiver and might just go away if a large Imperial
force showed up. The Imperials assembled a sizeable portion of Gushmege Fleet
for backup, and went into Quiver thinking a show of force would retake the
system for them. It was a trap.

The Alliance had tracked the passage of the Imperial ships. When they jumped
into Quiver, they found the entire Alliance Third Fleet (commanded by FAdm
Mordechai Sackett) waiting. For this battle, the Alliance had deployed
something new--ANS Macross, the second Alliance Star Destroyer. Named for a
type of "super battleship" in an ancient science fiction film, the 2.5
million ton _Macross_ had the firepower of an entire squadron of smaller
Alliance battleships, built around a Star Trigger meson gun. 

The battle was quick. The Imperial admiral had realized that he\'d been
tricked as soon as he saw what his sensors had detected, and ordered his
whole force to run for it. It was to late for many of his ships--before they
could jump clear, Third Fleet got off its opening salvo, which left many of
the Imperial ships destroyed or too badly damaged to escape.

Following the Battle of Quiver, FAdm Sackett offered the same terms as
before. The Alliance would keep Quiver, and in return would promise to keep
out of Reft and Verge in the future and pay for a new Scout base. This time,
no lost ships would be paid for. With their available force crushed, and the
danger that other border systems would follow Quiver\'s example, the Imperium
had no choice but to agree. Before returning the captured Imperial admirals,
the Alliance treated them to a demonstration of Star Destroyer firepower,
using three of them (one an unfinished ship under external power, not that
the Impies knew that) to turn a gas giant into a small star.

With this dramatic example of Alliance power, the Imperium began rethinking
its priorities. There weren\'t any new ships to send to the Alliance border,
with the Imperial Navy losing grounds on all fronts, but there was new
technology. Up to that point, the Imperium had copied some of the Alliance\'s
technology, but was using it only against the Zhodani, who where (they
thought) their most dangerous enemy. Now, the Imperium began shifting its
efforts to upgrade its ships to the Alliance Front.

Following the Quiver Campaign, the Alliance added a new associate member and
three new protectorates. In addition, the antimatter production facility
under contruction in Besancon was nearing completion. In 5649, most of Third
Fleet was upgraded with antimatter power and jump drive. The new ships went
on line with AM power at the beginning of 5650, and more ships went in for
refitting.

And that\'s how it goes so far. Of course, this is still being worked
on--changes are inevitable.

 Greenwich, England, is not a large town. Yet all the lines of
longitude for the whole world are based on it (plus the time system).
Wouldn\'t London have made a better choice?
 From a historical perspective these sort of things have no
real satisfactory answer. It is usually the case the a while range of
"standards" crop up where no definitive answer exists, each one based
on  local criteria, yet one wins out in the long run. The actual basis
for it becomes anachronistic and is overtaken by its justification because
it has been adopted.

  I\'m trying to "build" a city for a campaign that I\'m running.
  The city has the downport component of a class A starport.  I 
  have some questions about designing this port:

  1) An airport has a landing area (the runways) and a service 
  area (hangars/terminals).  A seaport combines the two (into the 
  dock).  Which model should I follow with a starport?

  2) Should I assume that _all_ starships, shuttles, etc., that use 
  the starport are VTOL-capable?  If not, then I obviously have to 
  follow the airport model.  If so, the question is still open.

  3) For ships that use Newtonain reaction mass for takeoffs and 
  landings, how much of a clear area around the vessel itself 
  should I allow?

  4) How big should I make the "parking" zones for the ships, and 
  how far apart?

  Once I have these questions answered, I think I can construct the 
  starport sensibly, and then make a decision on the physical 
  relationship between the starport proper, the extrality zone, and 
  the planetary city.  But I\'m willing to listen to any comments 
  that anyone else has on this topic...

However, the basic trouble with the whole scenario is IMO the incredible

research to make it something you could see results of within years rather 
than the \'one TL in 300 years\' that apparently apply in the GDW universe. But
when you put your Alliance scientists up against the Imperium scientists
without letting the Imperium enjoy the same rapid research ability then
you\'re mixing two different universes. No wonder that the Alliance can
kick Imperial butt if they can play around with anti-matter while the
Imperium is still only experimenting with it. But try postulating that
the Imperium could duplicate any Alliance discovery in the same time it
took the Alliance to develop it and tell me if you still think your
history is reasonable? (Not just a snide question; I haven\'t had time to
study your history in detail. I just feel that the Imperium is getting 
shafted in the research department.) Now allow the Imperium to get the
same amount of new ideas that the Alliance does so that the surprises
aren\'t all on the Alliance side. Now allow them as many MORE new ideas 
proportionally as the Imperium has proportionally more people than the

I think you should look at the history of your planet -- how did your port 
"grow"?  If it started at a low tech level, it would have landing strips for 
aerodynaimc shuttles.  If it started high, it would not.

Technology of the trading partners is important, too.  If most are low tech,
low
tech facilities are needed.  If high tech, then the odds and end from the 
boonies can be told to stay in orbit -- " You wan to land a what???" 

I think the would be seperate, though.  If you want to dock a ship, end the 
engine fails, you might have a problem but you probably don\'t have a
disaster.  
With a spacecraft, though, past the commitment point, though, that sucker is 
coming DOWN!!.  Maybe out where it can do it by itself is a good idea.

I would not let the suckers land in the first place.

believe in the far future, and I\'d like to see it develop further.  I hope
that there is someone on the TML who can tell me if the following facts are
correct:
The Ancients took humans from Terra about 300,000 years ago, and scattered
them among some 46 planets that we know of in Traveller times (I\'m pretty
confident about this fact).
Cro-magnon flourished 35 to 40,000 years ago.
Neanderthal flourished 35 to 100,000 years ago.
Cro-magnon, neanderthal, and some other groups were interfertile.
Races developed on Terra some 10,000 years ago.
The humans that the Vilani encountered when they began exploiting jump drive
were all interfertile.   (this is from DblAdv3, Research Station Gamma, at
21).
It would appear from the foregoing that the Vilani and Zhodani could have
been as different from the human strains on Earth as the neanderthals were
to modern caucasions, for example.  Intermarriage among the Vilani and the
other races absorbed into the Vilani empire might have led to the
development of still other racial types, and would also have blurred the
"racial purity" of the Vilani from Vland.  The Solomani conquest would have
done the same.
The Vilani and Zhodani had 300,000 years of development.  They may well have
developed different races in relatively different times within the general
group "Vilani" or "Zhodani" just as the Solomani had several different races
when they discovered jump drive.
I was glad to see that GDW adheres to position that there will be great
diversity in space; I don\'t know if any other view is remotely realistic.

the language will probably be Inglesh or Ingles.  A thousand years ago, it

I think that the official history supports the hegemony of an English-based

science in the world.  In a few hundred years, it will probably have
supplanted local, national languages in many areas.  (I don\'t think that
this will be a good development, but it\'s happening now.)  There are several
reasons for this development.  One is that the existence of a standard makes
it easier for people to communicate by learning the standard, rather than a
host of languages.  Thus in India, with its plethora of languages, many
people use English to communicate across ethnic lines.  
Anyway, by the time jump drive is developed, English will probably be the
first language of space travel, and will naturally be exported to the
conquered Vilani possessions.  The Vilani will necessarily learn English,
just as the aboriginal Americans and Australians, the Indians, the Persians,
and many Africans did in the last three centuries.
But they won\'t call it English, nor Anglic.  At least not in my universe.

Which is clearly extortionate, at tech-8 let alone tech-13 (the 
original xboat tech-level) where electronic transmission by laser
communicator of interstellar messages is the norm.  Private "ImpEx"
service would rapidly establish itself at a far cheaper level. 
In our local games, those rates only applied if one wanted the
*original hardcopy* to be physically delivered to a specific
address.  Anyone care to make a lower-bound estimate of the 
memory capacity of a holocrystal-based xboat?

The economics are interesting.  Figure in the IISS Commo Branch
salaries, xboat and tender maintenance (and payment to replace
worn out or pirated ships), "cargo fees", and the possible costs
of near perfect duplication for delivery.  Price still seems
high, especially since the messages seemed so much more like 
faxing.

Also, my players often would send the same message to several places
in hopes of catching up with someone who was travelling on an 
irregular schedule (like a tramp freighter).  One way we did this
was to have, as an additional complimentary service of the TAS,
free transmission of casual correspondence between members to
other TAS hostels in the subsector.  (Wider ranges, longer distance,
and big messages had a service charge attached.)  After all, the
TAS has to maintain the communication lines for the TNS anyway, so
a little extra traffic doesn\'t hurt.

What do we have in the way of religion in the far future?  The Vilani have
some sort of general ethical code that emphasizes tradition and community,
and does not seem to have a numinous aspect, at least in popular literature.
The only major religion that I\'ve discovered in the canon is the Church of
the Stellar Divinity, described in DblAdv 6: Divine Intervention, at 6-7, as
a very popular church that places few demands on its members and does not
interfere with government.  Church dogma is mainly that each star is a
divine being.  (See also Chellenge #44 Lost Treasures of the Abyss Rift;
MegaTraveller J. #3 at 97, news article).  The Church was founded in -3883,
during the Ziru Sirka (MegaTraveller J, supra).

The canon identifies many other small religions, like the Irklan of
Menorb/SpinwardMarches; the Society for the Sovereignty of Man over Machine
(based on Terra, I think); the religion of Jokotre/Spinward Marches that
is based on worship of the local deity Ram.
Another religion with some size is the Brotherhood, described in Alien
Realms as a human cult that believes that humaniti is destined to take over
the place of the Ancients in the universe.  It is widespread in Rhylanor
subsector, and has similar organizations in other areas.  (Alien Realms at
45).

So my questions to the TML are
-do you (other refs) have a place for the church as an instrument of the
state, or as a foil (or maybe neither)?
-what effect did the psionics suppressions have on public attitudes toward
religion (especially the numinous/mystical/altered consciousness aspects)?
-are there any broad (Imperial wide) religions?

10 parsecs jump fuel.

The _Tokugawa Ieyasu_ was begun before the Serendip War as a heavier version
of the old Gorbachev-class BC. Before it was completed during the Occupation,
it\'s role and design had changed substantially. The Tokugawa-class as built
was meant to serve primarily as a close-in heavy hitter in a major fleet
action, providing short-range firepower while guiding missiles in for the
Manta Ray- and Alliance-class ships which provided long range firepower.

When the Alliance began expanding outside the Islands Cluster, the
Tokugawa-class began to see use as a flagship for small Task Forces (since it
had a flag bridge). Later, when the Alliance fought skirmishes with the
Imperium and some of its Fteirle neighbors, the class was pressed into
service as a battleship replacement, since the skirmishes generally were over
before a real battleship could arrive.

This expansion of the class\' role has led to a recent shuffling of
assignments. Originally, nearly all _Tokugawas_ were assigned to Third Fleet
along with the other heavy units. Since 5647, though, many have been
transferred to First Fleet for duty on a variety of missions in the Trojan
Reach.

The _Tokugawa Ieyasu_ itself was not completed until a few months before the
CLW--it\'s construction was delayed considerably when the partially-completed
ship had to be broken down and moved from St. Hilaire to Amondiage to prevent
capture by the Imperium. The class has performed admirably in the CLW and a
variety of small campaigns, proving itself more than a match for Imperial and
Fteirle battleships. By 5650, foreign battleships are appearing with
technology copied from the Alliance, which had put them on a much better
footing when facing the Tokugawa-class. However, most of the class has just
recieved the Series C refit which adds antimatter power--this is expected to
preserve Alliance superiority into the 5660\'s.

Jeff Zeitlin asked about starports. My own rules for starport generation 
assume the following answers to his questions:

>Airport runways v. ships docks
Starships are big heavy dangerous things while in the air. Hence valuable 
buildings (hangars, etc.) will always be well away from where the ships 
land. I use runways extensively in my starports because any aerodynamic ship 
should be able to save a good bit of fuel landing and taking off from a 
runway rather than using brute force engine power for VTOL. Runways are also 
safer, reduce the amount of landing beacons, etc. required (kit for 2 
runways vs. kit for 30-100 VTOL circles!); also a clear blast area can be 
allocated behind each runway for all those \'dirty\' ships drives, rather than 
having to build extensive blast bunds around every VTOL location. etc. etc.

>Are all starships, shuttles, etc., VTOL-capable?
Even if they are, see the answer above for why many would still land like an 
aircraft.

>Newtonian reaction mass takeoff clearance area?
Any VTOL pad requires a good bit of clearance around it - ever seen one of 
the Apollo rockets that didn\'t manage to make it off the ground and 
exploded? ANY ship that goes straight up/down needs a lot of safety room - 
hundreds of metres preferably with blast walls et al.! This problem doesn\'t 
apply to runways (in general) because you just dedicate a strip a couple of 
kilometres long and wide at the end of the runway as a clear zone - any 
vessel running off the end of the runway would plough into a \'crash zone\' of 
impact-absorbent barriers to slow it down; one that took off and then 
couldn\'t climb, etc. or an incoming ship that lost too much height, would 
know that they have a totally cleared flat area in front of the runway on 
which to crash-land. And if they still blow up the ship, the several 
kilometres clearance means no one else should get too hurt.

>How big should I make the "parking" zones for the ships, and how far apart?
My low class starports just park you on roadways off the runway! But 
typically a port will have parking bays allocated to ships - either 
individual or in groups, with each ship\'s area enclosed by blast walls which 
will direct any explosions upwards and away from other 
ships/people/buildings. Bays will be of different sizes (e.g. up to 400 ton 
displacement, up to 1000 ton, etc.) with each having a different berthing 
cost. High class and low class bays are available, some with accomodation 
provided on-site, others with no more than a refuelling point.

Then all you have to consider is the multitude of other stuff found at a 
starport - from customs to the cleaners, from security to technical ground 
staff, hotels, shops, air traffic controls, etc. etc. etc. (it\'s a huge
list!)

Hope this is of help...

years ago in a paper mailing list; I\'ve _briefly_ summarized our conclusions
below.
 

Which model to follow depends on how manuverable your starships are on the
ground (or at slow speeds at low altitudes).  If they can maneuver easily
(and safely) then the seaport model is reasonable, otherwise the airport one
makes more sense.

The general conclusion seemed to be that the airport model made the most
sense because landing a large starship was potentially dangerous.  If you
assume that your starships can\'t move easily once landed then you have
shuttle busses and cargo transporters.  From an adventuring viewpoint, this
also provides more places for smugglers to impersonate longshoremen,
air/rafts to swoop in and hijack cargos to kidnap passengers, etc.  

A useful technique is to \'grow\' the starport through several phases, or have
older ports left after a new one is built.  This makes it feel more real and
also lets you have some seedy areas.  

Don\'t forget to route flight paths away from densely settled areas.  Take
planetary rotation and winds into account when planning flight paths and
COATC (Close Orbit and Aerospace Traffic Control) rules.  

As to blast pads, calculate the drive as a high energy weapon and figure out
the danger area.  Multiply by a _good_ safety factor and throw in some more
for pilot error.  Add blast berms around the pad.  

Check out JTAS 5 for a decent example.

reminded me of an issue I had when designing a spaceport a few years ago. All
the starship designs I\'ve ever seen had landing jacks, even the streamlined
little scouts. What do these ships do when they use a landing strip? A 
100 ton Scout/Courier on final approach, landing jacks down, heading for
the tarmac, the jacks hit the strip and then what? Do they act as skids? Or
do they dig into the ground and flip the ship over into a flaming crash?
And when the ship comes to a stop, it\'s still sitting on the runway. How does
it get to the parking area? Do aerodynamic ships come with wheels? Does a
really big tractor come out and drag the ship on its skids off the runway?
Or do they hover under power from landing area to parking area? If they can
hover, then why do you need landing strips in the first place? If they
can\'t hover, how are the ships moved on the ground? If you can\'t move a
ship once grounded, that implies that ships land on their parking area, which

implies no landing strips.

I ended up with the seaport model. The assumption was that ships can land 
on water, so the aerodynamic ships land and takeoff like seaplanes. The
big ships can land and takeoff where ever there\'s an open space of sea.
Tugs move the ships in and out of the landing areas to terminals, cargo
areas, parking areas, etc. Cargo can be moved directly between starships
and surface ships. Landing mishaps occur over water, away from valuable
real estate. Add a lot of artificial floating "islands" that provide
terminal,
customs, maintence, and other services, you\'ve got a configurable starport
that seems to make some kind of sense no matter what the capability of the
starships. You could add a land component with landing strips for aircraft
and aircraft-like spaceships. This could be the old, multi-generation
starport that\'s seen a lot of development over time.

    'body' => 'Question about food aboard starships:

How much space aboard a vessel do rations take up?

Please correct me if I am wrong, but rations are part of the consumables
that folks aboard ship use up (and that cost 1 KCr per crew or passenger per
jump).

Now, its perfectly reasonable to me that some of the volume rations take up
are part of the space used by the life support system. But how much is
that? 1 jump (7 days per person) of rations? 10? 100? 1000?

Assume there is a standard meal pack that takes up one liter volume and
weighs .5 kg. 3 per day means 21 per jump; for a crew of 9, that\'s 100 Kg
and .2 cubic meters per jump. At 10 jumps (10 weeks; you could stay
somewhere for two weeks after 4 weeks travel), that\'s 1 ton and 2 cubic
meters.  And 4 jumps is not a long trip.

When you run to say 6 months, or start talking about vessels carrying more
people, you really start running into a lot of space taken up by rations. A
vessel carrying 20 people with rations for 25 weeks uses 10 cubic meters
and weighs over 5 tons. And those are all the equivalent of freeze dried
rations.

So, how much of my vessel is given over to rations that I don\'t get to
control? Frankly, much more than 1-2 cubic meters "by magic" is
unreasonable.  It should be accounted for in the vessel design. Or
accounted for in the vessel\'s cargo hold.

Ration size, BTW, doesn\'t matter. If a ration pack is only .5 liter, then
you are still faced with a limit; the limit is just twice as large.

Since there is no differentiation by volume or price for ration quality,
does  that mean that there is only one choice on the quality of food served
aboard any starship, be it military troop transport, first rate liner, or
royal  personal yacht?

One fellow player suggested that this isn\'t an issue, because the life
support  system features full recycling, from toilet to table and back
again. So what are you being charged 1 KCr per jump for if it\'s a closed
system? What are you replenishing? What are you adding? How much space does
it take up? How much can you carry? What Tech Level produces it? (Important
if you are out exploring or zooming about the Wilds)

I have a number of problems with that type of system anyway. While I can
easily enough buy that you can process out poisons from bodily wastes and
be left with a fair amount of neutral bulk, where do you get the additional
nutrition?

I\'m curious what other folks have done. Or whether it has occurred to any
of you at all.

Note: this is granted a humano-centric view of food storage and
preparation. I won\'t tackle the Aslan requirement for live food or the
K\'kree preference for fresh plants till later.

Suggestions:

I\'d suggest that a vessel can stock up to a month\'s meager rations or two
weeks large or special rations out of life support. Carrying more rations
requires additional storage.  Meager rations require no special storage
facilities (freeze-dried etc.). Large or special rations require
refrigerated or freezing containers.

Meager: Prepackaged, prepared, ration packs, 1 l  .5 kg apiece. Various
    types: some require just heating; some require mixing with water; some
    are ready to eat (cold, hard, and crunchy; think MRE). Prepared in
    minimal galley. It is not always clear what the component items are;
    the meal is almost always a single item (one bar, one dish or bowl).
    Quality varies from just acceptable to nearly inedible. For example:
    the IN/IM SISR (Std Imperial Survival Ration, called SISO by the rank
    and file for Same in Same Out). Costs 3-10 Cr /meal.

Large: Standard grocery mix of food prepared from raw materials for long
    term storage, but not cooked. Generally about 2 l .75 kg per meal.
    Canned or frozen vegetables, frozen meat, grain products. Requires
    cooking in some form of galley (see below) to prepare. While not the
    highest quality, meals look like meals made of separate courses, and
    you can usually tell what the components are - provided they are
    prepared by a competent chef. Costs 12-20 Cr/ meal.

Special: Gourmet meals made of high quality, fresher versions of the
    above. 2.5 l, .85 kg. This requires a full galley and a fine cook
    (Steward-4+ or Cook-3+); otherwise this tastes simply like a better
    version of the above). Costs 25-50 Cr/meal.

Minimal Galley: Basically just a small Microwave or similar heating
    facility, a hot plate, some open counter space, and a sink. at the edge
    of the crew lounge. This is part of the budget for life support.

Half Galley: 4 cubic meters dedicated to food preparation, cooking, and
    utensil storage. Oven is large enough to cook meals for 6-10 in one
    sitting. Suitable for preparing either meager or large rations. Usually
    opens onto one side of crew lounge; sometimes partitioned off.
    Mass: 1.2 t.        Vol 4 cu. m.    Cost .12 MCr    Power .1 MW

    (Alternative: large ships may require several: .2 cu m./crew &
     passenger; minimum of 4 cu.m. 1 dedicated cook (or steward) for every
     full 8 cu.m. of Half Galley)
     Mass: .3 t. per cu. m.    Cost .1 MCr/ton          Power .025 MW / cu.m.

Full Galley: 12 cubic meters dedicated to food preparation, cooking, and
    utensil storage. Includes variable configuration ovens, toasters,
    stoves, etc; more cooking tools than Julia Child can shake a spoon at.
    Completely separate room. Generally manned by a dedicated cook, who can
    create some truly spectacular meals.
    Mass: 3.6 tons      Vol 12 cu.m.    Cost .6 MCr     Power .4 MW

    (Alternative: large ships may require several: .3 cu m./fed person;
     minimum or 12 cu.m. Note: Not everyone aboard may be served by the
     Full Galley; for example, a liner\'s Full Galley may only serve the
     1st class customers; a rich noble may have his yacht\'s full galley
     only serve his immediate party and have an additional half galley for
     the crew.)
     Mass: .3 t. per cu. m.    Cost .1 MCr/ton          Power .025 MW / cu.m.

Additional Storage:
    Meager rations can be stored in any container with no special
    requirements. To preserve more than the minimal amount of Large or
    Special rations, additional preservative storage space is required. (I
    say preservative because newer technology may come up with something
    beyond refrigeration).

TL      Container       Mass    Storage   Power   Cost
6         1 m3          100 kg    .8 m3  .02 MW   .0005 MCr
6         2 m3          180 kg   1.7 m3  .035 MW  .0012 MCr


Container: Volume of container
Mass: Weight of empty container (decreases with tech)
Storage: Storage volume (increases with tech)
Power: Power used by preservation technology (decreases with tech)
Cost: Cost per unit (increases with tech)


                        1 m3 storage            2 m3 storage
Per TL Increase:
   Decrease Mass:       10 kg                   20 kg
   Increase Storage:    .01 m3                  .02 m3
   Decrease Power:      .001 MW                 .002 MW
   Increase Cost:       .0001 MCr               .0002 MCr

For example, at TL11, a 2 m3 food storage unit is:
    Mass: 80 kg     Storage: 1.8 m3        Power: .025 MW   Cost:.0022 MCr

I think it\'s obvious that the listed prices (Cr10 for a \'page\' or two of
  text, etc) are the result, like so much of black-book Traveller, of
  a 1970s view of technology and computers in particular.  The times,
  they are a changing...

Of course, there\'s inflation to consider.  I can see USmail rates for

Tech level advantages - Alliance vs. Imperium:

ran

Amen to that.  The ongoing disparity is difficult to explain.  Although no
more difficult then the Sword Worlds languishing at TL-11 since
Grandfather-knows-when.  The developments devised by the Alliance are very
good, but it is unreasonable to assume they would not disseminate quickly.

One possible defense is the size of the Imperium reducing the speed of
adoption of the new technology.  However, the degree of local autonomy
allowed to sectors (and even subsectors) would result in the local yards
refitting ships immediately, and worrying about the paperwork later.   Even
the resources of a single high-pop world are considerable, and most
subsectors contain two or three such worlds.

BTW - In my own campaign, I bumped the Sword Worlds & Darrians to average TL
of 13; although in the case of the SW this had not filtered down to the
civilian population.  Shades of the Soviet Union...  The various
developments outlined for the Alliance will probably appear in bits and
pieces.  Luckily, we don\'t do much ship combat, so I won\'t have to retrofit
my INS ships.  :)

> Landing at starports

Most of the starship designs use landing jacks, not wheels.  The Starship
Operators Manual also implies use of the manuver drives for VTOL landings.
 This would rule out the landing strip concept - unless you make a few
pencil changes to the ship designs.

For that matter, even the "streamlined" designs aren\'t all that streamlined.
 Nor do they show any apparent shielding or insulation.  Thus they don\'t
seem to be doing any high speed atmospheric landings.

So if you have to slow down anyway, you might as well just plop down in
whatever landing bay you wish to use.  I have always assumed this to
resemble the starport at Mos Eisley, featured in _Star Wars_.  Actual
interpretations may vary.

It also occurs to me virtually any sort of starport could be justified based
upon local technologies or conditions.  A high-pop, TL-7 world could have
fleets of NASA-type shuttles working out of hugh airports.  A water world
could use the seaplane or harbor approach, etc. etc.

This would make agriculture obsolete (it is, after all, only about
2% effecient).  Now I\'m fairly new to Traveller (well, after a brief
exposure years ago), but isn\'t agriculture clearly implied in the
interstellar trade tables?

Doesn\'t that answer your question ? You\'re being charged to replace the

by
the grossly inefficient carbon-based units (ie crew). In other words,
crudely,
energy. I have always ruled that food storage is assumed into the life

calcs. After all, even after doing common-sense things like not calculateing
LS
for fuel tanks, there\'s still a hell of a lot of it.

However, I like your gourmet options and I will probably use them as a design
option for liners, yachts and flagships.

And IMHO, one approach to take to Traveller is that the tech is 
\'70\'s\' which reinforces that flavour. If I wanted to play 80\'s style 
I\'d probably use 2300AD. And the 90\'s stuff I\'ve got my own ideas on, 
but I haven\'t really seen a game to fit yet (except perhaps TNE - but 
that\'s got loads of hangovers from Traveller).

There\'s a major bulk problem. The carbon you add to the air is miniscule
compared to the amount you eat. Much easier time of it remanufacturing
wastes, as I said.  But then, why are you charged 1KCr for supplies each
jump? Clearly, GDW doesn\'t think you are recycling your wastes.

Actually, you are correct, though.  That was something I left out:
additional cost & space for a waste-to-food reprocessing plant. For extra
cost and volume up front, you can avoid the food supply issue at sufficient
level - if you are willing to have to think about eating your own sh*t!

Certainly, I think most rich nobles and other travellers would just assume
avoid that...

I agree. In fact, the disparity is _not_ as great as it appears. It just
looks great because I haven\'t yet posted anything on tech advances outside
the Alliance. In fact, the Imperium does copy Alliance technology just as
fast as it can.

The way I\'m leaning so far is that the new technology is only adopted in
certain areas that really need it badly (like the Zhodani front), with the
technology being adopted in other areas only gradually.

A good point. I\'ll take this into consideration whenever I get around to
"modernizing" the Imperial Navy.

It\'s worth noting here that the Helson-Canomaar Overdrive, which goes a long
way towards sustaining the "Alliance superiority," was actually developed in
the Sword Worlds.

 If you remember, when computing the space used up by
cabins it says that only half the volume required is for
the cabin itself. The other half includes coridors, lounges,
toilets, ... I always consider that this also includes
kitchens and pantries.
 Thus the space necessary for rations is already
computed.

>I\'m curious what other folks have done. Or whether it has

 The purchase and stocking of food is the duty of
the stewards. On a small ship this just involved going
out to the port and doing the (bi-)weekly shopping. On
larger ships with a regular route they probably already
have previously arranged deals with catering firms.
 Having done a lot of flying recently I am reminded of
sitting in the plane waiting for takeoff as they forklift
into it those large silver crates with those pre-prepared
meals on it.
 Most starports with any sort of facilities will
probably advertise several different catering agencies
that offer a variety of pre-prepared meal packs for ship
in a variety of different styles and qualities. Sort of
like the lunch-boxes they sell to buisness people in Japan
(any Japanese lurkers on the TML?).
 A well appointed ship would allow the customer, upon
booking, to electronically order their meals for the entire
flight. This would then place orders with the local agencies
which get delivered automatically. This could make an interesting
plot device: Someone books onto the players ship, orders a
special meal for a certain restraunt. At the last minute,
after the delivery has been made, they cancel. The meal actually
contains some sort of contraband that is being smuggled.

As for recycling, I always got the impression that the
automatic recycling on most ships just covered air and water.
Material wastes are sorted by category (metalic, plastic,
organic, and scrap) and held for resale to the next station.
Most stations would quite happily pay (small bucks) for
recyclable raw materials.

 The germ of my ideas about food stems from C.J.Cherryh\'s
"Merchanter\'s Luck". It coveres a good number of day-to-day
aspects of running a merchanter. Cherryh was also the origin
of my recycling ideas (cf "Rimrunners" and "Chanur\'s Legacy").

>Reaches?)  
 In my campaign setting the Imperium is much, much larger. This
affects many things, including the Scouts, but I think much of how my
scouts are organised is relevant to a standard 3rd Imperium setting
discussion.
 The Navy and the Scouts can be contrasted as being two
entities of interstellar government that exist in a coordinated
way. Both have had to deal with a very diverse galaxy with members
of all races, religions, and social structures. The Navy has taken
the approach of creating its own culture. When you join the Navy
you *must* become of its society. (Short hair, drinking rum, etc,
etc). The Scouts have taken the opposite approach: creating an
orginisation where *all* cultures can exist.
 The Scouts as sort of the ultimate in a distributed
working group. Sort of modeled like a neural net across stars. Any
sort of structure is loose and free form and subject to change
without notice. There is a high level of empowerment at a local
level for making decisions. Powermongerers are not so much
discouraged but looked down upon where they crop up and aren\'t
invited to the best parties. Money sort of floats around from where
it is generated to where it is used according to the laws of
fluid dynamics.
 What really holds the Scouts together is their Computer
network. It is a vast, interlinked, "information superhighway"
were data gets replicated from planet to planet. The "mission" of
the Scouts is the maintenance and development of this vast
data bank. Any information they can acquire is fed into it.
Most Scouts can access most of the information. There is very
little "traditional" protection. The "protection" is mainly
through the archane and haphazard organisational system. The
longer you have been in the Scouts the better you can navagate
and the real old hacks even claim to understand how it works
(although this may be the effect of going to too many of the
best parties). Hackers and "data vandals", again, are not much
discouraged but looked down on and never invited to the best
parties.
 Scout software itself is known for being extremely adaptable.
This is mainly seen through their user interfaces. Given the
big emphasis in the Scouts on communication *all* programs
are "self-learning". They will modify their presentation and
input parsing not only by user demand but also by what they
perceive as desired behaviour. A simple example:
 Pilot: "Damage Report?"
 Comp: "Life support marginal, power-plant output at
20%, and port thruster unoperational."
 Pilot: "So we\'re fucked."
 Comp: "If you say so."
Assuming both pilot and ship survived the incident and live to
experience the same sort of conditions:
 Pilot: "Damage Report?"
 Comp: "We\'re fucked."
So, interactive Scout programs tend to be chatty, use coloquial
language, be idiosyncratic and general bug the hell out of most
serious users but loved by the Scouts. (Especially X-boat pilots.)
 Scout network software is distributedly developed across
the civilised galaxy. Anytime anyhone feels something needs
to be added, they add it. The chances slowly replicate across
the network. It is similar in many ways to the development of
NetHack.
 Some have theororised that it is the concentration on
communication that makes Scouts such party animals. The more
intamate, the more communication. Alcohol, and other inhibition
removing substances, open the barriers to communication.
 In a typical down-port, the Navy people on leave will most
likely be found in the nearest "Navy" tavern drinking rum. The
Scout people will most likely be found in the furthest local
tavern drinking whatever the locals drink. (And attempting to
claim expenses for "gathering information on the local culture".)
 Once a Scout, always a Scout. You can *never* leave the
service. You just go "on detached duty". While on "detached
duty" you don\'t draw pay (although the Scouts will frequently
pay for freelance surveys done by detached personell) but can
avail of facilities on any Scout base. This includes free fuel,
accomidation and food (see later).
 Of course since everyone is on detached duty that means
there is always the chance they can be called up and
reactivated. This isn\'t as threatening as it sounds. Reluctant
Scouts have been known to flee, hide, or admit themselves
into insane asylums to avoid activation. Generally, depending
on the real urgency of the situation, the Scouts won\'t pursue
anyone beyond a certain radius of inconvienence. If the Navy
is the one re-activating them, that is much more serious and
harder to evade.
 Scout ships are known to have some of the worst
accomidation known to space. There is the famous coffin
X-boats, and the minimal Couriers with their dodgy ventalation
systems. The shipboard food is even worse. However, this is
paralled by having some of the best on-base services. The
rooms border on luxurious (certainly the beds, given the
Scouts gregarious nature) and the food is Cordon Bleu, at
the least. The one things a Scout knows is that when they
get back to base they can have a needler shower, a massaging
bed and their choice of at least eight cheeses.
 


Some examples from my campaign:
 Having evaded arrest the characters have now decided that
they should turn themselves in somewhere (preferably where
there was no navy base). They start querying information on
various administrative heads of nearby Scout bases asking about
their previous rulings in legal cases. After a while the
computer starts describing them in terms of "boring", "a real
A-R", etc, etc. Eventually it asks the players if they are
trying to get a light sentence somewhere. They consider momentarily
if they should admit such to the computer but eventually
settle for "suppose we were". It then proceded to search for
what it considered lienent officers...
 
 The players were on a courier mission that took them
near a "police action" zone. They were picked up by the Navy
(frigates can *really* surprise you when they have their
transponder off and their EMS masking on). A Scout Donasev
attached to this fleet had gone missing. (Donasev\'s have an
impressive scanner array usually used for survey but equally
applicable for espianoge.) It was a Scout ship that had gone
missing, potentially working for the enemy, and these were
Scouts with a ship, therefore, by Navy logic, they were to
be assigned searching for it.
 One crew member had been left behind. He was an incredibly
boring person who kept telling everyone to relax, they rest
of his crew had probably just gone crusin and would be back
in a few weeks. The local Scout representative didn\'t beleive
that they had "gone crusin". There is a reason the Donasev is
so ugly: so Scouts won\'t steal them. She was quite convinced
that they had just jumped system to leave their repellant
crew member behind.
 One Navy opinion and two Scout opinions.

 I\'ll send more to you off-line. I did want to answer some
of your comments for the list.

 My thoughts on Loren\'s recent and previous postings are simple:
"He has to say that." He really has no choice. I order to retain
copyright on their materials GDW has to be seen to discourage anyone
at all times from copying any of their stuff.
 Note: the key word in that last statement is "seen". I really,
honestly and truly doubt that GDW would ever consider taking me to
court for, say, SYSGEN. Hell, it is inarguably Traveller based and
if you asked them they would, indeed, say it was a violation and I
could be prosecuted.
 But why should they? They would only lose money. What they are
technically preventing is the establishment of Traveller as "public
domain" and someone else selling enough Traveller material to impact
on their market share. Do you really think they are going to spend
$10,000+ suing some half-arsed net programmer distributing shareware?
 I\'m sure if you dragged Loren into some quite corner and got
him drunk he would admit as much. However, whenever asked he will always
say that it is in violation of copyright and GDW is within its rights
if it chooses to sue.
 Careful readers will have noted that he has never jumped out
and said anything about this *without being asked*. If you ask, he
replies. If you don\'t ask, he doesn\'t. (As he purportedly doesn\'t
read the XTML he probably won\'t reply to this. If he did he would
probably replay as predicted.)

We have been deviating into some other threads, which
while interesting, are not about Traveller.

Thanks

Chameleon Class

Commerce Raider   AR-81337E2-A00000-40509-0  MCr 443.6  800 tons
                  Batteries bearing 1 1 1    TL=15
                  Batteries         1 1 1    Crew = 15

Low Berths=4 Cargo=100  Fuel=290   EP=50  Agility=3  Troops=10


 Tonnage: 800 tons (standard).
 Crew:  15. 10 troops.
 Performance: Jump-3. 3-G. Power Plant-7. 50 EP. Agility 3.
 Electronics: Model/5fib computer.
 Hardpoints: One fifty ton weapons bay and five hardpoints.
 Armaments: One fifty ton missile bay. Four particle
   accelerator barbettes. One triple beam laser
   turret.
 Defenses: Armored hull (factor-A).
 Craft:  None.
 Fuel Treatment: Fuel scoops installed. No purification plant.
 Cost:  MCr 554.5 standard. MCr 443.6 in quantity.
 Construction: 24 months.

Comments: Every pirate\'s dream is to own and operate a ship like this.
Code named Chameleon by law enforcement authorities, a single ship of 
this class of commerce raiders can easily take on any regular merchant
of up to 2000 tons. Its heavy armaments cause most merchant captains
to give up upon contact.

Details: The upper deck contains most of the living quarters. The twelve
staterooms can berth up to 24 crew members.  Each stateroom is furnished
with a bunkbed, a storage desk, and the usual wardrobe-sanitary closet.
Larger rooms will usually have an extra cabinent.  In the forward 
section of this deck are the four particle accelerator barbettes. Access
to the sole laser turret is through the central stairway.  Aside from 
the engineering spaces, the only other feature on this deck is the three
storage lockers.  These can hold anything from weapons to extra personal
effects.
 The main deck has the bridge, which is always manned, the 
computer, sick bay, and galley.  The recreation space on this ship is 
very limited.  Meals are prepared and stored in the galley and are 
eaten forward in the only common area on the ship.  The large number of 
airlocks enables pirates to swarm around and aboard any victim\'s craft.
The large EVA prep and storage area provides vacc suits and jet packs.
 The lower deck contains the cargo bay and the missile bay. The 
cargo bay has three large access doors for quick loading.  When space
is available, most off duty crew members can be found here.

(One disadvantage I see to this ship is the lack of small craft for 
transport and boarding purposes.  But then again, nobody said that 
piracy wasn\'t without its risks...)

I meant to get at this, but it\'ll have to wait - I was too busy checking

Okay, I\'ll bite.  What\'s a Referee\'s Companion?  I\'ve never heard of it.

S.WENSICAA SHUGILII

by M0B

My own player character from an old MegaTraveller campaign.  

The plot (or what I can remember of it) had the PCs as crew of a Kinuniur 
(sp?) "cruiser" taking a nobleman (one of the PCs) from Mora/Mora to get in
contact witthe Dulinor faction.  

We were taking some vital message from Norris, but I
either can\'t remember what it was, or we weren\'t told.  My character somehow
got on board as Ship\'s Chaplain(!), but was found out soon enough.

Note: despite some similarities to a certain ST:TNG character, this was 
written before that series was televised in Australia.  It was also written
long before all this New Era stuff, which I know nothing about. 

Background
The S.101 project began with great secrecy in the robotics labs of the 
Naasirka Endowment on Vland some ten years ago, based on a partial set 
of blueprints stolen from rival robotics manufacturer Makhidkarun.  
Originally conceived as a Contact & Liaison robot to liaise with 
alien races for the Imperial Scout Service, the S.101 project was 
abandoned when the Naasirka scientists could not find a suitable 
compromise between fuel capacity and performance.  The only prototype 
created, [Simulicrum] Wensicaa Shugilii is therefore the first and 
last of its kind.  

About the same time, NaaSec Group (Naarsirka\'s industrial espionage 
agency) managed, through careful theft, to secure a TL16 brain from 
Star Patterns Trading, the Hiver Federation robotics company.  This 
brain was duly placed in S.Wensicaa, who was then refitted and 
underwent trials as a Covert Intelligence operative.  This option 
too was abandoned, when the Naasirka researchers found they could not
mass-produce the stolen Hiver Brain. The corporation\'s indecision 
about the robot\'s function is reflected in S.Wensicaa\'s eclectic 
programming.
 
Despairing about what to do with its multi-million credit investment, 
Naasirka gave the robot over to its Marketing and Propaganda division 
to use in company advertising.  S.Wensicaa was given star billing in 
several trade and robotics Fairs in Vland sector in the years before 
the war, receiving great acclaim and earning Naarsirka\'s robotics 
division enormous prestige.  Naturally enough, Makhidkarun and other 
robot manufacturers are very interested in how Naasirka (not well-known 
for innovation) were able to construct such a sophisticated machine.  
Although they have their suspicions, the rival megacorporations have 
not been able to prove that the robot was constructed using stolen 
technology.

In late 1116, just before news of Strephon\'s death filtered through 
to Vland, S.Wensicaa and a Naasirka attendant began a leisurely 
journey to Mora/Mora, there to attend the 33rd Spinward Marches 
Triennial Technology Exposition.  S.Wensicaa is travelling in the 
guise of a normal human (thus breaking the 37th amendment of the 
Shudusham Concords) as part of a Naasirka publicity stunt.  S.Wensicaa 
was to arrive at the Expo unannounced. He would suddenly reveal himself as 
a robot, therefore showing that Naasirka robot-design is so good, 
one could travel across three sectors undetected.  

At least that was the plan.  Unfortunately, the civil war got in the 
way.  When the starlanes through the Corridor were cut, S.Wensicaa and his 
human companion found themselves stranded on a backwater world for nearly 
two years.  Although the human intended to return to Vland if transport 
was available, she was unfortunately killed during a Vargr raid.  Unaware 
of the change of plans, S.Wensicaa followed on with his original 
instructions and found a berth on one of the last civilian convoys 
to make it through to the Marches. 

Arriving at Mora in 1119, S.Wensicaa found that there were no 
company representatives to meet him. The Vilani megacorporations 
had declared the Ziru Sirka and had either sold off their assets 
or moved them back to Vland Sector.  As a Naasirka "asset", S.Wensicaa 
has therefore reasoned that it is his duty to return to Vland 
immediately.  Unfortunately, Vland sector is presently cut off to 
normal shipping because of the anarchy in the Corridor.  Furthermore, 
the robot\'s credit card is now all but useless in the Marches and public 
outrage at the Vilani megacorporations\' actions is so strong, it is in 
fact quite dangerous to even admit a connection with Naasirka at 
present.  With so many bankrupted shareholders, unsatisfied creditors and
entrenched workers ruined by the sudden sell-off, if S.Wensicaa was exposed 
as a Naasirka robot, it is possible that he might even be repossessed!  
To S.Wensicaa this is unthinkable: allowing his superior technology to 
fall into the hands of a rival company would constitute disloyalty to 
Naasirka.

Because it was thought that the S.101s were going to spend much  of their 
time in the field, S.Wensicaa has been programmed to be self-repairing.  
This was one of Naarsirka\'s first advances into the area of 
autonomous, self-repairing robots, and is only partially successful.  
In particular, the Hiver brain needs frequent servicing and care that 
the robot itself cannot provide.  He is aware that if his brain does not 
receive a major service within the next twelve months, its functioning 
will begin to be affected.  Therefore, he must reach a Naasirka facility 
soon.  Remember also that every five days or so S.Wensicaa must find a 
source of energy to replenish his fuel supply.  He can simply tap into 
a ship\'s power plant or similar energy source by means of the power 
interface built into a finger.



Meeting S.Wensicaa
The Referee has many alternatives to introduce S.Wensicaa into the 
campaign.  He will most likely be met in a starport or Traveller\'s 
Aid hostel, seeking a ship willing to take him closer to his destination.

Virtually penniless, he may lure the players with promises of huge 
payments from his employers (which he will probably not name) if they 
will take him to Vilani territory.  S.Wensicaa may even consider 
hijacking the ship the players are on if he is desperate enough, using 
the gun concealed in his stomach pouch.  It is also likely that 
representatives of Star Patterns Trading are seeking him, in order 
to get their brain back.  S.Wensicaa might go to the players for help, or
perhaps the players themselves may be contracted by the Hivers (or any 
other rival company) to seek out the robot and retrieve the valuable 
brain.  Even more extreme, perhaps S.Wensicaa has reasoned that the 
best way he can serve Naasirka is by damaging a competitor robotics company
(LSP, Spinward Specialities?) or assassinating a key rival (Duke 
Norris, Dulinor?).  He may try to rope the players into such a s
cheme with assurances of great rewards.  As a bizarre longshot, 
maybe the "Real" Strephon factionists need S.Wensicaa, to create 
a plausible double of the dead emperor.  

The robot is not above forging documents to further its ends, if it 
can justify how Naasirka would benefit from such action.  Indeed, 
as long as it can find a company-approved rationale, S.Wensicaa 
Shugilii is capable of almost anything.


Appearance
S.Wensicaa has been constructed to have the classical good looks of a
full-blooded Vilani male, and the emotion simulation program 
he has been equipped with is Naasirka\'s finest.  Like the robot, 
the program too is a prototype, and it suffers from several quirks.  
S.Wensicaa will scratch, sniff, sneeze, pass wind, fidget, yawn, and 
excuse himself from company to relieve himself, often at the most 
inappropriate times.  He can also shave, eat, have his hair cut and 
function sexually. He will often to refer to his "dear wife and child" 
back on Vland, and even has a "family holograph" in his wallet showing him
sitting with a woman and a young boy.  Beyond this however, details 
about his "family" are vague.  S.Wensicaa will strenuously deny being 
anything but a human; his programming prevents this, even if faced 
with incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. 

S. Wensicaa is dressed in a conservative business suit and carries a 
stylish briefcase and large suitcase about with him.  The suitcase is 
extremely heavy (containing servicing and repair equipment), but S.
Wensicaa can of course lift it effortlessly.  The U.P.P. given in his 
papers is 898DA7; he is described as a 32 year-old Junior Executive 
(rank 4) in Naasirka\'s Client Service division (known in-house as 
"Propaganda & Marketing").  S.Wensica has also prepared excellent 
forged papers with the rather artless pseudonym "Wendell Miller", 
giving his occupation as "university student."

*This program must be kept in CPU at all times.  Among other things, 
it compels the robot to obey the following directives (sorry Isaac):

 1. A robot may not, through action or inaction, allow Naasirka 
Corporation or its High Executives to come to harm.

 2. A robot may not, through action or inaction, allow any of 
Naasirka Corporation\'s property to come to harm, except where 
doing so would conflict with the first directive.

 3. A robot must obey any order given it by a High Executive of 
Naasirka Corporation, unless that order conflicts with the first or 
second directives.

 4. A robot must seek to preserve its own existence, unless doing 
so would conflict with the first, second or third directives.



EQUIPMENT:
-Robotic repair kit (suitcase); useful for rudimentary repairs and 
servicing in the field.

-Gauss pistol and 4 magazines (note that this weapon has been designed 
by NaaSec to be concealed in the visceral cavity, where it is 
virtually undetectable).

-Naarsirka credit card, in the name of "Wensicaa Shugilii" (note 
the  "S." is absent); unlimited credit.

-Vlandian Passport, also in the name of "Wensicaa Shugilii". Company 
rank could now offer the bearer limited diplomatic immunity.

-Travellers Aid Society  membership, "Wensicaa Shugilii".

-Limited gravitic field generator concealed in belt (reduces the 
robot\'s weight to 95 kg.)

-Several dozen holo cartridges, mainly containing promotional material 
about Naasirka\'s robotics operations.  Many feature S.Wensica. It would
be breaking directive one to broadcast these to anyone, unless there is 
a chance of a sale.   These could be taped over, but this would be 
transgressing the second directive.

-A briefcase containing personal items typical of a Vilani 
businessman, including several faked letters from loved ones.

                 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE TRAVELLER MAILING LIST
                          AND THE XBOAT MAILING LIST

                          LAST MODIFIED: 10 AUG, 1994

Hello, and welcome to the Traveller or Xboat Mailing List.

Please read this whole (9-page) document thoroughly (You\'ll only need to
read it once), and then make a hard copy of it and keep it for future
reference. It *should* contain everything you need to start using (as
opposed to abusing :-) the Traveller Mailing List.

SUBSCRIBERSHIP

This all started June 16, 1987 with a posting to USENET, and we have
grown to 519 active member addresses. TML has outgrown GEnie as the
largest electronic repository and discussion of things related to
Traveller. As long as I am co-ordinating this list, membership will be
open to everyone for free (it\'s my personal labor of love for the game
of "Traveller").

The membership seems to be very diverse, and well distributed over the
continent of North America and sites in the UK, Scandanavia, Australia,
South America, Asia, and the low countries of Europe. In the addresses I
see all kinds of sites: defense contractors, electronics manufacturers,
publishers, universities, homebrew USENET sites, Compuserve, and of
late, lots of America on Line addresses. GDW, HIWG, some fanzine
editors, and several other organizations monitor happenings on the TML.

The people that read the list are mostly players and referees of
Traveller. Some of them currently play Traveller but most have played it
at some time or are planning to play Traveller. Many have never looked
at a Traveller rulebook and play other role-playing games, and some are
just interested in science fiction or technology projections in general.

It is my sincere wish that we get the largest possible membership on
this list (the more the merrier), so feel free to tell others about it
that could be interested and have E-mail access. However, since I cannot
be responsible for any transmission charges, the membership is
restricted to those sites which shoulder their own burden of
transmission costs.

This list is included in the USENET list-of-lists, which appears
periodically in the news.lists newsgroup. It is also mentioned in the
FAQ for the rec.games.frp newsgroup.

DESCRIPTION OF THE LIST

There are two lists, really -- TML, and XTML.

TML exists to discuss Game Designer\'s Workshop\'s TRAVELLER Science
Fiction Role Playing System (what a mouthful). It is focused more on
current events and miscellaneous areas, including current derivative
games and rulesets (Traveller: The New Era, Traveller 2300, Striker,
Azhanti High Lightning, etc). Discussion is intended to be unlimited and
to people with a broad base of familiarity with Traveller. Subscribers
can exchange programs, news bulletins, new "rules", war stories,
questions at any level of expertise, answers, etc; or just listen.

XTML exists to discuss the Third Imperium and Rebellion period and their
rulesets, as described in Classic Traveller (the black books or The
Traveller Book) and the MegaTraveller boxed set. Discussion of TNE
rulesets, the Regency, "The Virus", and Imperial history past about
1120, is frowned upon.

XTML was created expressly for those who found the 70-year fast-forward
between the Third Imperium and the Regency distasteful. Many of these
people prefer to play in the Imperium era in order to make full use of
the many supplements which are now out-of-print. Several find the TNE
discussions on TML so tiresome and voluminous that they no longer
subscribe.

Also there are a number of you out there (you know who you are), who are
interested primarily in other gaming systems, but want to transfer
concepts embodied in Traveller to other systems. For reasons listed
below (see CONTENT), lengthy non-Traveller messages are discouraged.

A VERY BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO TRAVELLER

For those of you completely unfamiliar with Traveller, a short
explanation is in order.  Traveller is a set of rules for a Role Playing
Game.  Another common Role-Playing Game of wide familiarity is Dungeon &
Dragons by TSR, in which players attempt to guide fictional people (like
characters in a book) through a plot and setting set up by a person
designated to provide most of the setting and arbitrate the results of
player actions (the Dungeon Master, or DM).  What makes Traveller
different from Dungeons and Dragons is that instead of being set in a
medieval/magical/fantasy setting, it is set in a futuristic,
technological society of Interstellar Government and Commerce.  This is
the primary distinction, as both "games" exist to provide the basic
framework and rules by which each world operates.

An illustration: Dungeon & Dragons could provide the background for a
storyline such as any of the "Sinbad", "Conan", "Lord of the Rings",
"Eternal Champion" or other medieval/fantasy stories (to name a few),
while Traveller provides an excellent framework for stories similar to
"Alien", "Star Wars", and to a lesser extent "Dune".  Unfortunately for
you buffs interested exclusively in "Star Trek", Traveller in general
doesn\'t mesh well with arbitrating that sort of science fiction (but
other gaming systems exist just for this purpose).

Most TML members agree that Traveller\'s biggest plus is the rich
history, technology, and aliens background provided in numerous
supplements. Many other enjoy the creative aspects of the ship design,
world generation, and trade systems. Most agree that the three major
ruleset revisions (Traveller "Classic", MegaTraveller, and the latest,
Traveller: The New Era) are bespotted with conflicts and blatant
revisionism, but when it comes right down to it, rules are guidelines
and usually don\'t get in the way of good clean fun.

For more information on Traveller, you should look in your Yellow Pages
for the most sophisticated gaming/hobbyist shop in a nearby metropolitan
area, and drop in. Examine the Traveller: TNE ruleset, and supplementary
materials published for Traveller. Other sources of up-to-date Traveller
information can be found in "Challenge" magazine (a publication of Game
Designers\' Workshop), and "The MegaTraveller Journal" magazine
(publication of Digest Group Publications, alas, this excellent source
stopped publication at issue 4); there are fanzines you can ask about on
the TML - the ones I am aware of are the HIWG newsletter and Tiffany
Star; other magazines targeted at Science Fiction gaming may have a
small amount of Traveller-related material, but Challenge has a large
circulation and hence, availability. Naturally, members of this list
will be happy to answer any questions you have, too.

The latest ruleset -- Traveller, The New Era (TNE) -- has driven a deep
rift into Traveller fandom, with the old-timers upset at the loss of the
richly-detailed Imperial setting, and new players unperturbed. All I can
say is, find a ruleset you like and stick with it. TML intends to remain
a general, forward-looking list in spite of this frustration, and XTML
is provides a place where the Third Imperium is still alive, a TNE-free
zone for those who find such discussions annoying. If you\'re interested
in both, subscribe to both!

SENDING ARTICLES TO THE LIST

For those of you unfamiliar as to what a mailing list is, it is simply
an electronic mail "mailbox" on a UNIX host computer.  Any mail sent to
that mailbox at that host computer is automatically resent to everyone
in the list.  These mailing list mailboxes are also called "aliases".

There are three mailboxes which exist for TML, and two for XTML.

The first in the address needed to subscribe, signoff, make changes,
list and retrieve the archived messages and so on.  To subscribe to
the list, send a message to:

    listproc@mpgn.com
    
And in the body of the message put the line:

    subscribe traveller Your Real Name
or
    subscribe xboat Your Real Name

The second mailbox broadcasts all mail it receives to everybody on the
mailing list, including you. This is somewhat similar to posting an
article to USENET, and so the usual posting suggestions exist: do not
flame (send those via direct mail), and be reasonably brief (this means
if there is a lot to say, go ahead and say it; but if there is little to
say, don\'t ramble). Here is the "BROADCAST" mailbox:

    traveller@mpgn.com      (for TML)
    xboat@mpgn.com          (for XTML)

By default, you will recieve a digest of the daily messages.  You should
not expect a reply saying that your message was successful.

The third address is used for corresponding with me, the list maintainer. 
Those addresses are:  

    traveller-request@mpgn.com  (for TML)
    xboat-request@mpgn.com      (for TML)
    
Subscription messages, signoff messages and such will cause me to send a
form message back to you (unless you are really having a problem, like
your domain name or host name changed from the time you subscribed).  Other
correspondence regarding the list should go to this address.  I am the
only one who will get this mail (though, the addition of a second maintainer
is a possibility in the future).

Please follow these format rules when sending a message to the list:

 1. Use only standard printing ascii characters: alphanumerics,
    punctuation and special characters (#!|, etc.) are okay.
    No "control codes" except CR (^M), LF/NL (^J), FF (^L), or
    TAB (^I), please.  [Reason: mailers sometimes reject messages
    with unusual characters or control sequences in them.  This
    means my personal mailbox gets filled up by scores of
    undeliverable mail messages.]

 2. Please limit line length to 80 characters or less (78 or less
    if possible).  [Reason: Many people are stuck with standard
    24 line by 80 column terminals, or worse.].  If you do not
    obey this limitation, you will recieve a REJECTION notice.
    As list admin, I can overcome this limit if you are sending
    something intentionally and necessarily wide.

 3. Limit message length to 45000 bytes (45KB) or less.  Some
    TML member\'s mail gateways truncate messages a little longer
    than this. A few TMLers cannot read email longer than 32KB in
    length, and they already are silently suffering, as I feel
    that further restricting the message size from 45KB to 32KB
    would not serve most people\'s interests.

The addresses on the list are as brief and as simple as I can keep them,
Internet addresses if possible, so that the UWO mailing system can
choose the quickest route for each message. Since the mail is in effect
resent by my host, as long as you can reach the list here at
mpgn.com your host, then you can reach everybody on the list,
regardless of the mailer domain they are in.

WATCH THOSE CC:\'S AND YOUR OTHER AUTOMATIC MAILER SERVICES

If you reply to a TML/XTML article you have received, and let your mail
program automatically choose the address to reply to, under most
circumstances it will mail your message to traveller (the broadcast
address). Be careful -- when responding to any article received via the
list, look carefully at who is going to receive it before letting your
mailer send it. It wouldn\'t do to have a private response automatically
and carelessly sent to the whole list! Conversely, if you wanted the
mail to go out to the whole list, make sure that you use the traveller
address.

WHAT TO DO IF MAIL HICCUPS (AFTER SENDING TO THE MAILING LIST)

Occasionally you may get a copy of your message regurgitated to you,
with strange messages such as "user unknown" or "host unknown", or
"message not delivered in 3 days".  If this occurs, PLEASE FORWARD A
COPY OF THE ENTIRE MESSAGE TO traveller-request, so that I can attempt
to determine why the address is bad, and if necessary remove the address
from the list.

Most mail failures are sent back to me, instead of to the originator, so
I can remove addressees from the list that continually cause delivery
failure.  Yes, if I can no longer send mail to you for some reason or
another (I keep getting returned and failed mail), I will after several
failures regretfully remove your name from the list.  PLEASE KEEP ME
INFORMED OF CHANGES IN ADDRESS and account termination, so I\'ll not be
so overwhelmed in maintaining failures and can do a more quality job.

TRAFFIC AND DELIVERY STYLE

The list averages about seventy messages every month, and the average
message usually tends to be about 2-3 pages (66 lines == 1 page) in
length.  The list has been known to hit 230 messages in one month,
though!

A feature of the mailing list instituted in May 1989, and supported for
both TML and XTML, gives each member their choice of delivery styles:

Instant: Instant delivery means that you recieve each individual message
    sent to the list, as quickly as possible, in your mailbox.  Use of
    this format is discouraged because of traffic load.

Daily Digest: This means that you receive bunches of messages sent
    to the list, compacted into a single message, in your mailbox.
    The software sends out a single digest 24 hours after the last
    digest, or multiple digests if traffic warrants it.

If you want a particular form of delivery, or want to chage your current
form, just send mail to listproc@mpgn.com and use one of the following
commands:

    set traveller mail digest       for a daily digest
    set traveller mail noack        for instant delivery
    set traveller mail postpone     for temporarily removing you from the 
                                    list.  When you want to resume, send
                                    one of the digest/noack commands.
                                    
For the XTML list, substitue xboat for traveller in the above commands.
The default delivery message is the Daily Digest..

CONTENT

A word on content is in order. I try to run TML/XTML as a free and
blisteringly open discussion service. I am generally very tolerant of
opinions expressed, even though I may not personally agree with the
originator. I will tolerate general criticism, critique, poor reviews,
and even occasional fits of frustration. However, I will NOT tolerate
direct attacks on another member\'s integrity.

If you feel someone has unfairly attacked your person, don\'t respond to
the TML/XTML broadcast address. Please let me know. It will result in
discussion between the parties, and at my discretion may result in
disciplinary action. Only one severe case has arised, when one member
described another in an obscene and degrading manner on the open forum.

As far as critique or frustration leveled at a company or it\'s products,
it is generally tolerated on TML/XTML. Most people who emit such
commentary are striving to share their opinions as a customer of the
product, and I believe that as long as it is even partially constructive
commentary, that it is acceptable for posting.

It\'s okay to discuss other game systems at length on TML/XTML if they
are discussed in a Traveller-related manner (example:
comparison/contrast). However, long non-Traveller messages are expensive
for those who pay for TML/XTML mail delivery byte-by-byte, so if it\'s
not related to Traveller, keep it to a short announcement of an offline
discussion.

Above all, think about the other 500+ members of TML/XTML before you
post. And if you see something that really gets your goat, cool off
before responding, and send me a message before responding if you think
it\'s appropriate.

TOPIC COORDINATORS

There are also more special addresses to send items to the mailing list.
This is because people wanted to start "special interest groups" for
certain topics:

Traveller EPBM Referee: pbemref@engrg.uwo.ca (Mark Cook and metlay)
 Richard Johnson began refereeing a Traveller Electronic
 Play-by-Mail game, where players are crewmembers aboard the ISR
 Alcyon, on a mission to research a newly-discovered Ringworld.
 Mark Cook and metlay took it over. They periodically keep the
 TML at large informed of game happenings. There are a whole
 family of mailing-list style aliases at the engrg.uwo.ca site,
 to aid characters in routing PBEM mail - for details, contact
 pbemref. The game is usually suspended May through September.
 Note that the engrg.uwo.ca address actually forwards mail to
 their real mailboxes: markc@csos.orst.edu and metlay@netcom.com.

Compter-Aided Traveller "CAT": richard@agora.rain.com (Richard Johnson)
          dan@engrg.uwo.ca (Dan Corrin)
 CAT members discuss how computers can be used as RPG aids in
 playing Traveller, including automated character & star system
 generation.  This list is distinct and mostly seperate from the
 TML.  Please mail to BOTH addresses to be added, as Richard is
 topic coordinator and Dan maintains a redistribution mail alias,
 cat@engrg.uwo.ca.

Traveller Done Right "TDR":
 THIS LIST IS CURRENTLY DEACTIVATED. If you have specific
 questions about TDR, please send E-mail directly to metlay
 (metlay@netcom.com) and/or Mark Cook (markc@csos.orst.edu).
 Discussion on rule changes to Traveller, MegaTraveller, and
 Traveller:TNE rules currently should be directed to the TML.
 (TML thanks Mark Cook for the above statement).

2300AD: ftavares@skull.cc.fc.ul.pt (Pedro A C Tavares)
 Pedro is interested in keeping those with interest in 2300
 together, and reports to the TML occasionally if there\'s any
 interesting material. Write him if you\'re especially interested
 in 2300.

TNE-Pocket: tne-pocket-request@ocf.berkeley.edu (George Herbert)
 George and Guy Garnett (aka Derek Wildstar) have a working group
 to flesh out a pocket empire for Traveller: The New Era. The
 location is the Aoreriyya region (subsectors J, K, M, and N) of
 Reavers\' Deep sector, and the time is 1200 - the dawn of GDW\'s
 "New Era". This is quasi-official work being done with the
 knowledge of GDW. Members of this list are expected to
 contribute regularly. Periodic reports of goings-on are posted
 to the TML, and complete archives are available by FTP from
 ocf.berkeley.edu in the directory pub/Traveller/TNE-pocket.

Space 1889: space-1889-request@mit.edu (Matt Goodman)
 Matt has started a mail list to discuss GDW\'s Space 1889 game,
 which is unrelated to Traveller, but as it\'s a GDW game, it\'s of
 interest to several TMLers.

If you cannot reach these people, send the mail to traveller-request and
I will gladly manually forward mail to them.

HOW TO GET OLD ARTICLES AND SHAREWARE

There\'s some starship designs, programs for world generation and trade
and others, official MegaTraveller Errata, and official Imperium sector
data as posted to GEnie by Digest Group (and much, much, more)! The
whole archives are on the order of 45 MEGABYTES in size.

The primary TML archive site is uwo.ca (or more correctly,
ftp.engrg.uwo.ca, 129.100.100.12, directory pub/traveller). It contains
historical TML message traffic (over 20 MB in size), packages of
collected information (errata, software, sector data, and MT- and
classic Traveller starship designs), additional gaming aid software, and
additional starship and vehicle designs.

There are several additional special-interest sites listed in another
document that I can send you. For specific details on retrieving this
information and what the exact site addresses are, mail
traveller-request@engrg.uwo.ca and ask for the "How to Get Archives"
document.

TRAVELLER SERVICES

Vehicle Design Keeper: robdean@digex.com (Rob Dean) or
   rsdean@apgea.army.mil (Robert Dean)
 Rob has a huge collection of vehicle designs for use with
 MegaTraveller. Send mail to Rob if you\'d like him to send them
 out to you, or better yet, ask traveller-request to direct you
 to the FTP site where they are available.

A WORD ON MANNERS AND LIST OWNERSHIP

I know that everyone on the list is pleasant and excited in Traveller
and will use the list for sharing all the things that make Traveller
exciting, but....

There is no room on this mailing list for people who would destroy the
fun the rest of us are having.  If anyone on the list habitually resorts
to abusive language, misuses the list, or I receive numerous complaints
about them (sent to traveller-request), I will warn them by direct mail.
If the situation cannot be resolved, I will remove them from the mailing
list.  All attempts at fairness and understanding will be attempted.

Furthermore, the existence of this list and the cost for it\'s
administration and existence is supported by Multi-Player Games Network 
(MPG-Net), the site administator, and the list administrator.  The fact 
that anyone is on it at all is because we want you here to listen and to 
share.  If at any time we perceive a need to discontinue the list for 
personal or employer\'s reasons, or discontinue any individual\'s participation

in the list, I must reserve that right with no questions asked.  Sorry.

Also, the Multi-Player Games Network is not responsible for the
traffic that flows through the list.  All traffic is the responsibility
of the originators.  Traveller, MegaTraveller, and Traveller:The New Era 
are Trademarks of Game Designers Workshop, Bloomington, Il.

A few comments on the subject, in relationship to the Third Imperium...

A) All known feudal societies have a single religious viewpoint: one of
the functions of religions in feudal societies is to promote the
idea of "rule by divine right".  

Christian monarchies believe in "Divine Right". Islamic monarchies believe
that they are decended from the Prophet Muhammad.  The Thai monarchy
appoints only Buddists to work for the state.  The Japanese Emperor is,
first and foremost, a Shinto priest.  The Roman and Chinese Emperors made
supplications to the gods.  Both Roman Emperors and Egyptain pharoahs
believed that they WERE gods.  

Hitler had children begin their prayers "Our Furher, who art in Berlin..."
Stalin, Napoleon, Mao and that N. Korean guy had personality cults. 

What does the Emperor of the Third Imperium believe?

B) All enduring societies had a single religious/philosophical viewpoint,
which motivated and justified their actions.  The examples from ancient
history are too numerous and obvious to mention.

Modern Western societies have an anti-religious - especially, anti-Christian
- viewpoint.  Until recently, Eastern Europe worshipped Dialitical
Materialism, and had a large set of rituals and doctrines connected with
this.
Their Holy Texts were written by the Prophet Marx, etc, etc.

Western societies offically worships no god.  However, governments will
ALWAYS impose some form of morality of it\'s subjects, especially
compassionate, caring people like our current rulers.  Said morality
must - and shall - be based on a shared worldview.  The current dominant
worldview (say, from the end of Communism) can be clumisly called "Economic
Conservatism/Cultural Liberalism". 

Offical rituals?  I leave it for you to figure out.  A clue: watch
television.



And regarding the Third Imperium?  Well, the importance of Honour is
stressed, so let\'s explore it.  

Honour is but another word for Truth; percisely, Speaking the Truth,
regardless of consequences.  This is valued in the military, where you
must trust your fellow soldier with your very life.  This implies that the
Third Imp. nobility arose from a military aristocracy, like most nobility
on Earth.  The strong ties between the nobility and the Imperial Armed
forces merely underline it.

This may not have been true from Cleon to Jacquine (spell-check!): they
seem to have been economic nobles, on the Medici model.  However, it wqas
almost certainly true from the last "Emperor of the Flag", Arabella. 
Those who attain power via military means would tend to retain a military
view of morality in power.

Is it possible that this allegiance to Honour - really, The Truth - is
possible without supernatural connotations?  Maybe: but it seems very
unlikely.  Among all the groups I know of, this allegance to truth is based
on supernatural forces. (i.e. swearing on Bibles, "...before God/the
Revolution/Science/Truth/State/People/etc.."  Note the _capitalized_ words)

Nowhere is  it implies that the nobility have an ideological/religious
love of The Truth.  Or God.  Or Science. Or Economics.

BUT... it does appear for The Emperor.  Oaths are not sworn in the name of
God (who may or may not be believed in), but in the name of the Emperor. 
The Emperor attains the Throne by calling, not on God and His priests, but
on the name of the People.

So.  The One True God in the Third Imperium is .... the People.
     And the Emperor is ........................ the representative of the
                                                 Holy Will of the People.
                                                ("God on Earth, in the
flesh",
                                                  as an older religion would
                                                  put it.)

NOTES:

---- The following can be considered to follow from the above conclusion. ----

Lesser religions are tolerated, as long as "the harmony of the Empire"
isn\'t threatened.  So this religion can be considered polytheistic.

An enormous number of religions exist in Traveller.  None exist across
multiple systems.  This can be considered "Imperial policy", to deny any
religion a large enough base to challange the rule of the Emperor.

The Emperor is nowhere worshipped or adored in Traveller literature.  But
people do kill for him.  And a large percentage of Imperial society was
prepared to follow an insane Emperor. 

The People is also nowhere worshipped or adored in Traveller literature. 
But Archduke Dulinor led a bloody rebellion, and killed billions, in the
name of The People.

----

On Traveller\'s view of religion: 

   Traveller, like most modern science fiction (like most modern
intellectual works, actually), tend to view religion as a set of cultural
lies, used to justify the rule of an elite or as an emotional mania.

   This is rather understated in Classic Traveller: there, (as far as my
pitifully small knowledge permits me) it seems to merely assume that
future religions will exist, but materialism is better.  The only religion
of importance was a Vargr Superiority faith, seen merely as a threat to
Imperial Rule.

   In MegaTraveller, religious viewpoints also seem to play only a small role
in the game.  And, in this case, this is as it should be, since the most
dramatic events of the era are basically political.  Only under intense
scrutiny (which is rather unfair) can \'gameworld\' religious structures be
guessed at. 

   Of course, current modernist/atheistic assumptions can be found.  For
example, the World Builders Handbook assumes the typical sociological
model of technology: that, as technology rises, polytheism gives way to
monotheism to deism to atheism.  

   This ignores the example of India, China, the Middle East, half of Africa,
and large areas of North America.  But it did work for Europe (can anyone
say "Eurocentric?").  And GDW can\'t be blamed for following the
intellectual consensus of everyone of importance, after all...


   In Traveller: The New Era, Things Get Interesting.... 

And I quote:
   "I\'ve been out there a half dozen times, and if that doesn\'t give you
religion, I don\'t know what does....
    By Allah, by Buddah, by Krishna, by God - we were created for better
than that."

   "Rational nature exists as an end to itself."

not just idols, but cruel and powerhungry gods, too!

unquestioningly loyal to the wishes of God."  Which, incidentally, is an
insane computer.

   "The likelihood of this world developing a friendly and open
spacefairing culture on its own within the next century is probably less
than 10 percent.  The chances are about the same, perhaps even a bit
better, that it will develop star travel but retain a messianic religious
culture based on the concept of cleansing holy war.  That would be a bad
thing, in our opinion."

    "Stripped of some of the literal parts of the mythical baggage, but
with the ethical structure of the religion intact,[...] we thing that
these people will make an outstanding addition to the Coalition."

     When you get right down to it, TNE remains in the standard pro-tech,
anti-God tradition of most science fiction.  (a la Roddennbury
(Spell-check!),
Asimov, etc, etc.)  However, the universe just got a lot more complex,
interesting, and religious.  Even if that religious resurgance is in the
stereotyped "evil religious ignorant dark age" format.

     Future developments will be viewed with interest by this observer.

 Hmmm...it looks like you are equating "monarchies" with "feudalism".
 Of the examples you provided, only the Christian monarchies (and not
all of them) were feudal.  The Islamic monarchies were patterned on the
Eastern model of the absolute monarch.  The Japanese Emperor did not
actually rule Japan for most of Japan\'s history.  And the Shogunate,
which did rule, was a military dictatorship, _not_ a feudal monarchy. 
While the Egyptian pharoahs may have actually believed they were Gods,
only a few of the Roman Emperors ever gave a hint that the believed that
they were Gods.  Being a Roman God-Emperor was a political move, having
little if anything to do with Religion.

 And then there is the Persian Empire (you know, the one ruled by the
"King of Kings, Great King").  They rather specifically allowed all of
their subject people to worship as they wished, as long as their taxes
were paid and the Imperial Laws were obeyed.
 For that matter, didn\'t the Egyptians allow the Jews to worship as
they wished while they were slaves in Egypt?
 And didn\'t the Caliphate allow their Christian and Jewish subjects
to worship freely?  As long as they paid their taxes (which Moslems were
not subject to), anyway...

 Mention some.  The only one I can think of off the top of my head
were the Jews, who were a minor society, even at their height.
 The Japanese had Shinto and Buddhism (and later Christianity), which
were not necessarily compatible.
 The Persians had many religions, as mentioned above.
 The Romans followed the Persian practice, up to the point when
Christianity was declared the State Religion.  Even after that,
Mithraism and similiar mystery cults were popular in the Legions (the
real political force in the late Roman Empire).
 The Egyptians had the Gods of upper and lower Egypt, which were
eventually combined to form a single Pantheon (with a legacy of much
confusion as a result (Amon-Re was the combination of Amon and Ra, the
two solar deities of the original two pantheons)).  Plus others (the God
of the Jews comes to mind, plus the Roman deities, which were integrated
into the Egyptian pantheon in much the same way the Egyptian deities
were integrated into the Roman pantheon)...
 The Christian Monarchies had Catholicism, Protestantism (in all its
many forms), Judaism, and (in the case of Spain) Islam.  Plus the
Orthodox variation in the Eastern monarchies.  Which resulted in more
religious wars than at any other time in history, as far as I can
tell...
 All of them fought among themselves at times to try to establish
that single religious/philosophical viewpoint you mentioned.  None of
them, except possibly the Egyptians, succeeded.

> especially compassionate, caring people like our current rulers.

 I will assume this is sarcasm...:-) :-)



> Honour is but another word for Truth;

 Well, no.  It\'s not.  If you believe that this is so, then read more
Japanese history.  Or more Roman history, for that matter.  Or try to
explain how allowing one\'s opponent in a duel to recover his feet after
falling on his duff (thus putting him in an unenviable position re the
duel) equates to "Truth"...

 Honour means many things, depending on the culture it is attached
to.
 The Japanese equated Honour and Duty.  Truth didn\'t even come into
the picture.
 In the Christian lands, Honour was more often equated to Fairness.
 The Romans mostly equated Honour and Truth.  Except when Honour was
equated with Duty.  Or Fairness.  Or just Winning.
 The Persians taught their nobles "to ride, to shoot the bow, to
speak the truth".

 And then their were the rest of the people, who tied honour to
themselves, not their Gods/Semi-Clods/Submarine sandwiches/etc.  Most
people I have heard of did not think of "honour" as something done
because God made them do it, but because rather as something they did to
feel good about themselves...

 So?  People have fought for a lot of things that they did not think
of as a God.  The Carthaginians come to mind, who had religion, but who
fought wars for purely pragmatic reasons, and left the Gods out of it.

 Mostly because Dulinor was a complete _idiot_!  If he had studied
Revolutionary Theory, he would have been aware that you need the people
behind you BEFORE you start your "revolution"...Waiting till the
shooting starts to convert the "hearts and minds" of the populace is a
guaranteed road to failure, since human conservatism is almost guranteed
to stick to "the way we\'ve always done things" in Times of Trouble.  So
all Dulinor ever accomplished by his war was to convince everyone that
they should follow their traditional leaders...


 However, I mostly agree with you that Traveller has stereotyped
religion into the H.Beam Piper/Robert Heinlein model.  I prefer the Gordon
Dixon model
of religion myself...;-)
 And in my games, the Gordy Dixon model holds true - religions are a
widespread part of the "Imperial Society", with variations of
Christianity and Islam and Zoroastrianism keeping most of the people
happy, and Buddhism and/or Animisim covering the rest.
 And, yes, this is Terrocentric.  But, then, I\'m a Terran, and I
don\'t have too many non-Terran models to go on.  These are the most
exported religions in our world, and I (on a blind leap of Faith) assume
they will be exported to the Stars also...

I agree that the Imperium allows religions to exist to the extent that they
do not interfere with the dynamics of the state.  Your point that there are
no multi-system religions in the Imperium is wrong on the facts, however:
Double Adventure 6, Divine Intervention, describes the Church of the Stellar
Divinity as a religion popular in the Imperium because it makes few demands
on its members and does not interfere with governmental functions.  Alien
Realms describes the Brotherhood as a human cult in Rhylanor subsector with
similar variants throughout the Imperium that believes that humaniti is
destined to supplant the Ancients as the next rulers of the galaxy.

I\'m not sure where these observations lead as far as determining the place
and role of religion within the Imperium.

Do you have any thoughts on the effects of the psionics suppressions on
religion?  My take on it is that the psionics suppressions served to
suppress spirituality generally, and to make the Imperium more secular both
in dogma and practice.

 This was part of a message I received via private email recently, 
 in connection with the Deneb RICE Paper.

 The idea proposed seems reasonable, but for one thing:  It is 
 information that would not apply to all planets.

 It is partly because not all worlds need the same information that 
 the free-form area of a RICE Paper is included.  It is also partly 
 because some information cannot be reduced to a fixed format,  
 Lastly, it is because narratives are more interesting to read 
 than tables of dry facts.

 Let me emphasize to all submitters:  If you think that a 
 "formulaic" datastream should be included in the Basic Planetary 
 Data, add it yourself - just skip a line after the "standard" 
 data, add your stream (such as the religious specification, or a 
 Classic Traveller Universal Ship Profile for that multi-generation 
 ship that set off during the Vilani Imperium, and has just been 
 rediscovered, or...), with a short explanation (as long as you 
 feel it needs to be), then skip another line, and do the 
 narrative.  RICE Papers are flexible; they have to be - G-d 
 (or the Big Bang, or whatever creative force you choose to believe 
 in) breaks the mold after each one.

    'body' => 'Having seen the data on these for the Alliance, I\'ve got a few comments 
to make. Firstly: it\'s a really brilliant idea. Secondly: I\'m not sure 
how well it\'d work.

The problem is this: while NH3 takes up somewhere between 50% and 55% of 
the volume of liquid H2 (the author quotes 52%, which I\'ll believe), 
fusion powerplants run on L-Hyd. This means one has to convert the NH3 to 
N2 and H2, separate out the H2, and then feed the H2 into the drives.

Converting NH3 to N2 and H2 is easy (it\'s doing it in reverse that\'s 
hard.) It works really well at high temperatures... the problem being 
that it\'d have to be done in the gas phase, so to treat 1kl of liquid 
would require c. 1000kl of volume -- more like 2000kl, since we have

 2 NH3 --> N2 + 3 H2 (i.e. 2 mol --> 4 mol of gas)

For the same reason, you can\'t do the reaction under very high pressure.
(I have assumed 1 atm pressure here, but corrected below.)

Separating H2 and N2 is easy: just freeze out the N2 (since you want 
L-Hyd, you\'ll cool the stuff anyway.). Then discard the N2 and pipe the 
H2 to your drive.

My guess is that at TL14 one would require a refinery approximately 10 
times the size of the powerplant. Perhaps high pressures can reduce this 
significantly... let\'s say by a factor of 50. That gives 20% of the size 
of the PP, which is acceptable. So, you can run your powerplant off NH3.
These are guesses -- 10% or 5% of PP size may be possible.

Jump drive is a different story. I reckon 5% of ship volume is required 
for the L-Hyd to initiate jump, which is burned VERY fast. (And very 
inefficiently at TL9-16, which is how J-fuel usage can decrease at higher 
TLs.) I think that requires all the 5% to be ready as L-hyd at jump. An 
absolute minimum volume for an NH3 refinery (liquid phase) would be about 
10% of ship volume, in order to use NH3 for jump. So maybe it\'s possible 
and just about worthwhile to use NH3 for J-fuel. I think it isn\'t, but
your technical assumptions may vary.

The real problems with using NH3 concern refuelling. In order to refuel 
from a gas giant etc., a starship must collect hydrogen fuel, refine it, 
turn it into ammonia (which requires a source of N2 on board i.e. not 
discarding N2 when it is produced) and store the ammonia. This will take 
lots of volume to produce at a reasonable rate: one has to store the H2, 
N2 _and_ NH3, _and_ provide a large reaction plant. (You also have to 
work out how to remove the ammonia -- you can\'t dissolve it in water as 
one does at present -- but I\'ll assume that problem solved at TL14!). N2 
storage will take up half the volume of the NH3 capacity. Fuel processing 
will be slow: the speed of fuel conversion rather than fuel skimming will 
be rate-determining. Plus, ammonia is going to be far more expensive to 
buy than hydrogen fuel -- another reason for using hydrogen for jump. 
(Ever wonder why no rules exist for anti-matter jump fuel? It\'s insanely 
expensive, that\'s why.)

One possibility is a set of NH3 drop-tanks. There\'d be no worries about 
retaining N2, so it\'d be an efficient way of carrying extra fuel. They\'d 
have to be carried through jump, alas. And of course they\'d be expensive, 
but drop-tanks aren\'t expensive compared to starships. I like the idea of 
NH3 auxilliary tanks.

Summary: NH3 fuel is impractical for jump drives, possible for 
powerplants, and a great idea for auxilliary tanks. IMHO.

Comments welcome.

Since I sent the file, I\'ll try to address this, with the following caveats:

1. I didn\'t invent the thing, and I don\'t know the name of the player who
did, but I hope he or she is reading this and will comment.

2. I know nothing about this stuff in real life, and in fact I had to ask
somebody to find out what "NH3" was. :-)

3. My experience with the system in the Alliance campaign is as an end-user.
I just design ships based on a specified capability, without any idea of
exactly how it\'s supposed to work.

> The problem is this: [something way too technical for me about gas volume]

Well, how about explaining the discrepancy between reality and the stated
performance by saying that the difference is achieved through gravitic and/or
nuclear damper technology? That seems like a pretty popular explanation for
why Traveller science isn\'t "realistic." :-)

> Jump drive is a different story. I reckon 5% of ship volume is required 
> for the L-Hyd to initiate jump, which is burned VERY fast.

As I recall (the hardcopy is filed away somewhere) _all_ the fuel was used at
once when going into jump over a period of around 20 minutes. The NH3 jump
fuel refinery was oversized because of the need for refining the jump fuel 10
times faster than would normally be required.

As far as I can decipher from all this, the NH3 refineries in the Alliance
campaign _do_ work on liquid NH3 rather than gaseous. Okay, so maybe this is
impossible in real life. So what? So\'s jump drive... :-)

> The real problems with using NH3 concern refuelling.

Indeed. To date, I\'ve taken note of the need to refit all existing refueling
systems to accomodate NH3, but haven\'t really gotten beyond that.

> In order to refuel 
> from a gas giant etc., a starship must collect hydrogen fuel, refine it, 
> turn it into ammonia

Hmm. So then gas giants don\'t have any ammonia in them already? How about
those planets that have exotic atmospheres--do they? For that matter, what
about Nitrogen? I was under the impression that gas giants already had stuff
like this in them...

Anyway, if there\'s no way to scoop ammonia, the Alliance (and other NH3
users) would probably build "factory ships" as part of the fleet train which
would carry N2 and use it (along with scooped hydrogen) to produce NH3 as
needed. Considering that the Alliance fleets will already be needing a
substantial fleet train just to lug around spare missiles, I don\'t think this
would be a major hardship...

Anyone else with knowledge of NH3 as seen in the Islands want to comment on
this?

I don\'t think you can do it in this case. The Traveller universe seems to 
take as given real physics, and add a minimum number of 
not-yet-proved-impossible quirks to allow FTL travel, anti-gravity etc. 
(all of which probably derive from one new piece of physics). The problem 
here is pretty straight thermodynamics, which really ought to work in 
_any_ human-occupied universe.

8-). Point taken. The only way I\'ve come up with a liquid NH3 converter 
to work is a laser tuned to dissociate NH3, which will reduce but not 
solve the problems of heating up the NH3 and having the H2 want to 
expand. We can postulate a good cooling system... OK, it\'s probably not 
so physically impossible as I thought, or rather it\'s not provably so, 
and hence (in my book) OK to use.

Yes, they do. The problem is that ammonia is denser than H2, and N2 even 
more so. Thus, it all lies deep in the gravity well of a gas giant -- 
probably too far in for a 6G spacecraft to remove it. The other problem 
is relative abundance: you\'d need to skim for _far_ longer in the 
accessible upper atmosphere in order to get an equivalent amount of 
ammonia fuel to the available H2 fuel. Some exotic atmospheres could 
indeed contain NH3, though it might take some explaining why and it 
wouldn\'t do a starship much good to fly through them too much.

Hmmm. It\'d be rather like adding an extra stage to a space rocket: it\'d 
have to be bigger than all the other stages put together. I think it\'d 
require two or three times the tonnage of an equivalent-capacity H2 
tanker fleet, off the top of my head. But yes, it\'s possible. And it\'d 
lead to some really interesting space actions, as the Imperials try to 
trash the tankers to stop the Alliance fleets....


Let\'s look at it the other way round: why doesn\'t the Imperium use NH3 
fuelling? Either it doesn\'t work, or it\'s too expensive, I\'d suggest. If 
one assumes it to be possible, it\'s got to be expensive (which includes a 
need for extra/specialised tankers, etc.), IMO.


Besides, there\'s a far better way to improve fuel performance. Use D2 
instead of H2! (Deuterium is the isotope of hydrogen which ``does\'\' 
fusion reactions. This is based on nuclear energetics I assume to be 
fixed). Since D2 is < 1% abundant, it follows that fuel volumes can be 
reduced enormously. By my own logic, this is going to be expensive, of 
course. But definitely worth it... one can imagine ships with small D2 
tanks using it to `enrich\' skimmed H2/D2 mixture, to improve range at 
decreased cost. Alternatively, one rules that the H2 is necessary to keep 
the reaction under control, or something, and that D2 can\'t be used, tho\' 
I reckon it\'s implausible.

>And is their a \'realistic\' way to make freight profitable?

Freight merely guarantees that you will have an income per ton of stuff 
in teh cargo hold. Its a reliable income, but not an intersting one. Trim 
ship operating costs to increase your profiut margin.

As an exercise, I created a 200 t freighter in CT, and used its cargo system
and ran about in my campaign space (non-Imperial but randomly generated).

I included docking fees (about 10 times what the docs suggested), 
payments, fuel costs, maintenance costs, etc. They only had a moderate 
Trading skill.  By selecting their cargos with some care as to where they 
were going, they quickly amassed a small fortune - enough to pay off the 
ship in 5 years instead of 20, and to amass a downpayment on a 300 ton 
trader... 

While limited, CT\'s trading rules were easily enough expandable by adding 
new products.  From what I have heard of the MT/TNE trading, the actual 
adventure of merchanting has fallen into deep disrepair/disregard.

I am working on (slowly; its about 3 projects down in my non-work queue) 
is a better (more detailed) means of trading rules based around the 
relation between product, market size, market tech, and planet trade 
classification.

I\'ll let you know how it workds out...

>How profitable is chartering your ship, as opposed to carrying cargo?

 Too true.  14Kl of H2 per Energy Point are required every 2,500,000
seconds under HG rules.  Which translates to 5.6 ml per second per EP. 
Multiply by 1000, and you have 5.6 liters.  Assume that it takes you
about 100 seconds to process the NH3.  That gives you half a Kl per EP. 
Which is 4% of the size of you power plant (assuming TL15 power plants),
smaller percentages for lower Tls.  If you operate at high pressures,
then you can use even smaller refineries.

 Where did you get your "absolute minimum volume" from?  However, the
rule I used required larger fuel refineries than that for the J-drives,
so it really doesn\'t matter, I guess.  Even with a very large refinery,
the savings in J-fuel makes for a net volume gain for the ship.  And
every spare ton helps in designing a warship...


> The real problems with using NH3 concern refuelling.

 I won\'t argue with this.  In general, in the Islands, gas giant
refueling was a minor issue.  It never became an issue after the
development of the NH3  fuel system, though.  Mostly because the Islands
were all civilized, and drop tanks were common, and gas giants were
out-of-the-way places where noone went without an overriding concern
(which happened twice in the course of the game)...

 I should note that NH3 refueling is easier in a terrestrial planet
than a gas giant.  The N2 is available from the air, the H2 from the
water, the energy required from the ship\'s fusion plant...


> Plus, ammonia is going to be far more expensive to buy than hydrogen
fuel -- another reason for using hydrogen for jump. 

 Nonsense.  It is easier to make NH3 on Earth today than it is to
make LH2.  NH3 is extremely cheap compared to LH2.  Also easier to
store.


> (Ever wonder why no rules exist for anti-matter jump fuel? It\'s
> insanely expensive, that\'s why.)

 Exactly so.  AM will only be used for fuel (jump or otherwise) when
the cost comes WAAAAY down, OR when the AM is used by someone without
concerns for money (like a government).  It is, of course, useless to
the Imperium, since the Imperium has a multitude of planets where H2 (or
NH3) can be gotten cheaply.  The Alliance guys might use AM to deal with
the relative sparsity of refueling points out there in the Rift where
they are, but even they will never use it very much until and unless a
Stage II or III AM production facility is built.  Which is unlikely,
whatever Ken thinks, until the Alliance finds itself no longer at war
with the Imperium -- destroying one of them is a trivial effort, unless
the Alliance pushes its borders out about thirty parsecs...

 Well, no.  They don\'t.  If they did that, then the lasers wouldn\'t
be described as using "gravitic focusing".
 However, I wouldn\'t go so far as to say the "gravitic and/or damper
technology" is required to allow NH3 fuel systems to be designed and
built.

 It is not used in the Imperium primarily because the people at GDW
were/are ignorant enough of chemistry to not be aware that NH3 (or H2O,
for that matter) is a more efficient way of transporting H2 than
carrying it in liquid form.
 In MY Universe (which is the root source for this speculation), the
Imperium doesn\'t use NH3 because they find it more valuable to be able
to do "wilderness refueling" than it is to save the space in their
ships.
 Also, over here, the Vargr are big users of NH3, both in the basic
form and the "so-called" "Hellson-Canomaar Overdrive".  Especially out
in the far reaches of "Vargr Space".  Which extends about a third of the
way to the Core, btw.
 Ditto the Solomani.  The Solomani Sphere is still here, but in this
Universe, MOST Solomani live rimward of the Sphere in small states and
independent worlds extending most of the way to the Galactic Rim.  The
Solomani of the Outer Reaches use NH3 almost exclusively, especially
near the big rifts...

 Can\'t make the assumption that D is used to fuse, instead of H.  If
that were true, then the tiny little fusion plants in the back of your
air-rafts would irradiate the driver (and passengers, and bystanders). 
The assumption that GDW makes that fusion plants can be built VERY small
implies that the reaction used in Trav fusion plants produces a minimum
of neutrons.  Which implies Protium fusion.
 And don\'t bother telling me that that is impossible.  It happens in
the Sun (we think) so it is certainly possible (wt).  It is also
certainly VERY difficult.  Quite possibly TOO difficult to be feasible
given Trav TLs.  Which is irrelevant.  No Protium Fusion, no small
fusion plants.  (NOTE:  It bothers me not at all that you might be
restricted to big fusion plants, since I tend to play Trav at TLs below
where the itty-bitty fusion plants are allowed....

 However, I have always assumed that MOST of the H2 used in Trav
power plants and J-drives is actually used to provide cooling to the
reacting mass.  Note that this allows the _possibility_ that an NH3 fuel
system could use that waste N2 as coolant after redesign of the heat
exchanger.  Which is the basic assumption behind the H-C Overdrive,
btw...

Let me interject a couple of comments here.  I don\'t know what the highest
practical pressure would be that would favor the formation of hydrogen and
nitrogen from the ammonia, but I remember bits and pieces of this from my
undergraduate days (12+ years ago) as a chemical engineering student.  The
ammonia reaction is a classic case of a reversible reaction, where "pushing"
any of the factors causes the equilibrium to favor the opposite product.
Thus, remembering that the formation of ammonia is done at high pressure
(600 atm?), to increase formation of hydrogen, you\'d want to go to as low
a pressure as practical, balancing throughput with volume of the equipment.

In terms of volume.  I don\'t have MT with me today, so I couldn\'t say if
the saving in mass on the smaller fuel tank  will make up for the increased
mass of the fuel.

Besides, if you look in the old TML files, you should find a message where 
I calculated that (in MegaTrav) a TL15 fusion plant produced more energy 
from each unit of fuel than could be accounted for by fusion of the naturally
occurring deuterium--so some protium fusion _must_ be going on, given those
fuel consumption rates.

I agree about the balance of the hydrogen probably being used as a heat
transfer working fluid, so nitrogen would proably work for that, too.

Since any spacecraft has anti-gravity, it seems that the limiting factor
would be how low the ship can go before overheating, not how far down the
gravity well is. Of course, it could still be to far down...

Indeed. Keep in mind that the Impies (or whoever) would already be wanting to
go after the fleet train since most Alliance ships only carry enough ER
missiles for one or two engagements in their magazines. If the ammo carriers
can be taken out, the ships would be at a disadvantage against enemy ships
that were still getting their ER missiles resupplied...

Steve answered this one. Personally, I think it\'s an unwise decision on their
part, but it certainly fits with all the other unwise design decisions the
Impies make! :-)

The Aslan would also have access to NH3 (via the Alliance if nothing else). I
haven\'t really given more than passing thought to their technology, but at a
guess I think they\'d use it for their warships at least.

This is likely to be the case throughout Alliance territory in 5650. I
haven\'t worked out the details yet, but basically every system in the
Alliance will have at least a Class B port, and probably a Class A.

They wouldn\'t. I thought at first the Alliance might have an AM powered ship
or two before the Stage II facility was finished, but then I realized that
keeping even one ship powered would use pretty much all the AM produced. It\'s
not worth it, since the AM is more urgently needed for weapons (which also
use much less of it).

> Which is unlikely,

Not really. A big AM plant is vulnerable to destruction, true, but the
Alliance hasn\'t fought any _major_ wars during the 5640\'s, when the plant
would be built. The wars it has fought, with the Imperium and maybe with some
Aslan clans, have been small affairs that ended before anyone hit the other
side\'s commerce or planets. Except for these incidents (which don\'t last more
than a few months at most), the Alliance has been in a "cold war" with the
Imperium, not a hot one--and neither side would be terribly eager to _start_
a major war...

Actually, the problem has nothing to do with G-Forces at this point.  The
A/G drives would counter it.  The problem has to do with the pressures 
placed on the ship by the weight of the Atmosphere upon it.  Most ships are
designed for space operations to systems with normal atmospheres.  Even subs
have a limit of how deep they can go before they buckle in upon them selves.

Most StarShips probably could go to 3 or 4 Atms\' of pressure before they 
started seeing structural damage. (No real scientific basis for that other
than they are designed for higher internal pressures than external pressures)
Depending on the size of the Gas Giant, the Depth to the NH3 may well be 
beyond the ATM limit for the vessel.  The problem would probably be
magnified if refulling modular cutters were used.

    I\'ll take your word for it, Rob.  I don\'t even remember that 
much basic chemistry.  All I recalled was that the reaction is
reversible...;-(

    Irrelevant, Rob.  M-drives in MT were reactionless, and based
ONLY on volume.  Admittedly, MT based "agility" on mass.  On the 
other hand, the definition the GDW provided for "agility" made it
identical with acceleration, which was based on volume.
    Also, we were using HG, which was ENTIRELY volume based. 
Mass wasn\'t even calculated, much less used...
    In a mass-based system (with reaction drives), you would use 
the N2 as additional reaction mass, and thus come out (slightly) 
ahead.  Admittedly, that blows you specific impulse all to snot, 
but so what?  You\'ll have a much better mass-ratio, and unless 
the H2 burner had a pretty good mass-ratio (not for any TNE/MT 
ship, anyway) the advantage would be on the side of the NH3 
burner...

    Almost certainly possible.  I\'m not sure how N2 reacts with 
metals/composites/etc at REALLY high temperatures, but it 
shouldn\'t be any worse than the way H2 reacts.  Well, not much 
worse, anyway.

    True.  However, your basic 1G free trader (in TNE rules) has
a hull thicker than a WW2 U-boat.  Any warship out there (again, 
in TNE rules) will have a hull thicker than any sub *I* was ever 
on.
    In MT, the basic starship hull is thicker than that of any 
submarine ever built (except possibly the Trieste)...
    I don\'t know how this works out in HG, since the "basic", 
non-armoured hull has no volume, no mass, no nothing (except 
price).  I assume that it should be similar to the other two 
versions of the game.

    Well, no.  They are designed to dive gas giants.  As I recall
(someone out there might look this up if you are feeling 
generous) from "Secret of the Ancients", building ships that can 
dive to several hundred atmospheres\' pressure is no big deal.
    I should note also that SDBs were always assumed (by GDW, not
by me) to be able to hide deep in a Gas giant\'s atmosphere or 
deep in an ocean.
    I should also note that (according to Jane\'s, plus my 
calculator) your basic nuke submarine (which has a thinner hull 
than an MT starship) can handle 30 atmospheres or so...

    Ken, and others:  Cynthia and I have been arguing over this 
for a bit.  The only points of agreement we have come to are that
destroying a large AM  facility would either be (a) very easy, or
(b) very hard, and (c) a very good idea for your enemies, or (d) 
a very bad idea.
    We have come up with a lot of good reasons for each of these 
positions.  Please note that the greater the extent that the 
Alliance (or anyone else) depends on AM for its fleets, the more 
valid the arguments for all four of the above conclusions.
    In other words, it is too iffy for advance guessing, but *I* 
certainly wouldn\'t want to bet on a Stage II or III device 
surviving until the Imperium (and other neighbors) decides that 
they have no interest in EVER trying to take you down...

agricultural products available); cargo variety depends on population and
society (larger populations and fragmented societies give more types of

  I was rummaging FFS today, and took it into my head to assume,
  for argument\'s sake, that all of the stardrive technologies 
  listed in FFS were possible, and commenced an economic analysis 
  and comparison among them.  The standard configuration I intended 
  to use was a J3 TL12 100 rate hull.

  When I went to work with the Stutterwarp setup, I couldn\'t get 
  sensible figures: The fuel usage was too low, and the performance 
  was too high (the minimum TL12 fusion plant I could put in gave a 
  stutterwarp performance of 9+ parsec/day [can you say J66 
  equivalent?]).  Worse, the size of the SW/powerplant combo was, 
  by the figures and description, independent of the hull rate.  I 
  don\'t see this as sensible, and feel that there must be a bug in 
  this.  Also, there were no figures on how far a SW system could 
  tunnel before discharge was necessary.

  Can someone _please_ rationalize this info for me?

  For odd and inexplicable reasons, I was going through FFS today,
  and started thinking about weapons systems that I had remembered 
  from previous Traveller experience.  I then started, for equally 
  odd and inexplicable reasons, to consider the peaceful civilian 
  applications of military technology.

  Two weapons I remembered were the Jump Damper and the Jump 
  Inducer.  All I know of them was that the JD could prevent a ship 
  from escaping into jump, and the JI could force a ship into jump, 
  which jump was guaranteed to be a misjump.  Now, what I need to 
  know is:

  Were these "official" weapons, or did they come from my GM\'s 
  fertile imagination?  If the former, can someone provide me with 
  tech specs on them?  A controllable JI/JD combination, depending 
  on how they really work, might have the potential to serve as a 
  "jump gate" method of interstellar travel, and might prove more 
  economical on high-density routes than conventional jump ships.  
  Even if they\'re not, working out the FFS specs to prove it might 
  be educational.

Well, looking at it from the Alliance\'s perspective, they have to take a
chance. The Alliance pretty much has to keep a substantial technological edge
over the Imperium to stay free. Since the Impies start copying Alliance
technology as soon as they see it (mostly in 5640), by 5650 they\'d have
gotten a good deal of it into production. Even allowing for the slow rate at
which it spreads through their Navy, and the greater need for it on other
fronts, by 5650 the Alliance\'s once-great technological edge would be badly
eroded.

The development of AM technology pushes Alliance technology back up to a
comfortable lead--it would take the Impies something like ten years to catch
up, assuming they bothered to. (I\'d think they would, but then I also thought
they\'d develop NH3 fuel systems. :-))

So, given the importance of AM power to the Alliance, the Imperium would have
to consider the possibility that a preemptive strike at the facility would
lead to a major Alliance response. While the Imperium could certainly overrun
the Alliance in an all-out war, the cost would be great--too much for a
country already fighting two other major wars to undertake lightly. In
addition, the Imperium would have to consider the possibility that the
Alliance would retaliate by attacking Imperial planets. Whether the Alliance
would actually do this is undecided, but it\'s certainly working to make the
Impies _think_ it would.

Given all this, I\'d say that the Imperial Navy would have contingency plans
to destroy the facility, and would even run exercises to test those plans,
but wouldn\'t actually do that unless they were _already_ engaged in a major
war with the Alliance.

[comments on stutterwarp performance]

Well, without the actual drive info I can\'t be sure. It is faster than the
ships I\'m familiar with from 2300AD. Keep in mind, though, that stutterwarp
is _supposed_ to be vastly faster than conventional jump drive. In fact,
stutterwarp warships generally are comparable (or superior) in speed to
warp-drive ships in Star Trek...

There\'s a jump gate of a different sort in the Islands campaign--this time,
not developed by the Alliance. As I understand it, the original design had a
big station with a jump drive in it, and a boom. The ship jumping would dock
to the boom, the jump drive would create a jump field around the ship via the
boom, and away it would go. The inventor of the system mentioned an
alternative whereby the jump field would be created around the ship by
induction, giving a "Babylon 5" style jump gate. I still don\'t have a clear
picture of the technicalities for this thing, but when I do I\'ll add it to
that file on new technology.

Komesh has an equatorial diameter of 72,000 km; the diameter is measured to
the point where atmospheric pressure is 1 standard atmosphere ("atm").  The

The atmosphere is 89% hydrogen, 10% helium, 1% water vapor, methane, and
ammonia.

physics that you can use to check this, if you know the mass of the planet.
"Commercial vessels ... can withstand up to 1000 degress K and 1000 atm.
Military vessels can handle temperatures to 1500 K and pressures to 2000

There are also special protective suits which fail at 1,000 K and 400 atm.

The table indicates that crush/burn depth is between 34,000 and 35,000 km
from the center of the planet, and that liquid H2 occurs up to 33,000 km,
where the pressure is 400,000 atm and the temperature 3,000 K.

determine if that information is plausible.

This ship is from one of the FASA Adventure-class Ship packs (#1, I think,
but
I\'m not certain).

It does indeed violate High Guard ship design rules.

It is also copyrighted.  Seeker bought the rights to all the FASA starship
material several years ago.  I don\'t know when they plan on re-releasing it,
but they don\'t want it passed around even if it is out of print.  I know this
because FASA gave me permission to distribute their out-of-print Traveller
material, this permission was explicitly revoked by Seeker when they bought
the rights.  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

>From what I understand, the string of numbers & letters that make up the
High Guard stats can\'t be copyrighted, no matter what Seeker may think. 
It\'s unlikely, IMHO, that *ANY* CT will ever be reprinted again so I think 
this is just more of what Cyhthia was referring to when we were all comment-
ing on GDWs hardcore pronouncements concerning their copyrights. If Seeker
*really* doesn\'t want their FASA stuff passed around then they should
get it into print. Otherwise.......well, if they *say* they care but
*act* like they don\'t then they shouldn\'t be surprised that little at-

 " Two weapons I remembered were the Jump Damper and the Jump

  which jump was guaranteed to be a misjump.  Now, what I need to 
  know is:

 " Were these "official" weapons, or did they come from my GM\'s 
  fertile imagination?  If the former, can someone provide me with 
  tech specs on them?  A controllable JI/JD combination, depending 
  on how they really work, might have the potential to serve as a 
  "jump gate" method of interstellar travel, and might prove more 
  economical on high-density routes than conventional jump ships.  
  Even if they\'re not, working out the FFS specs to prove it might 
  be educational."

   Hello to everyone from a newcomer.  These two weapon systems, as I
recall them were ship-mountable beam-weapons.  Yes, they were official;  I
believe they were from MT.  I was using an idea similar to this in my MT
campaign for >100 ton jump operations...  The vessel would radio ahead to
the Star-Gate controller (just a space station with non-hostile versions of
the JI on it and some comms gear) and indicated where it wanted to be
dropped.  The SGC then set the JI target coordinates and the vessel flew
into the beam.  It was possible to move entire convoys this way, by
pre-arrangement.  The SGC was anti-matter powered, and refueled by tanker. 
TL 17+ Imperial core technology, but fun, nonetheless.

far and away my favorite FTL system ever since.

I haven\'t min/maxed Stutterwarp against the other means of FTL propulsion in
FF&S, but I\'m not surprised that it comes out to be incredibly efficient. IN
fact, I believe GDW had a warning to that effect, and recommended some kind
of limitation be generated by the GM. In 2300AD, the limit was that some
"stuff" builds up on the tantalum coils, stuff that is highly radioactive.
It has to be discharged every 7.7 light-years, or Bad Things happen. It must
be discharged in a gravity well of .1g or higher, I believe.

My question on stutterwarp is: what\'s the mass or volume? (I know one, but the
other is definitiely not iterated.) I was doing a comprehensive set of
star drive types for a GURPS campaign and converted Stutterwarp to GURPS
Vehicles stats, but was unable to figure either the mass or volume - I forget
which and I don\'t have my notes with me.

    This may be.

    So, to use one of the arguments in favour of wrecking the 
facility:

    If the Alliance has shifted largely (say, 80% or so) over to 
AM powered warships in their fleets, they are using pretty much 
every kilo of AM they make every year.
    If the Imperium wrecks the facility, then the Alliance 
suddenly finds itself without fuel for 80% of their Fleet. 
Assuming a one year reserve of AM, the Imperium has to hold on 
for only one year before the Alliance grinds to a halt.  Note 
that use of weapons of mass-destruction by the Alliance speeds up
the time when the Fleet grinds to a halt.
    Given this, the Alliance has to either (a) try to wreck the 
Imperium within a year, or (b) go on the defensive, minimizing 
use of AM until the facility is repaired/rebuilt (which should 
take another ten-twenty years, given the cost and resources of 
the Alliance).
    Given (a), they have to wreck about 1000 worlds, all high 
pop, most heavily defended.  The Alliance will NOT have what it 
takes to do that by 5650AD.  And probably won\'t for another 50
years after that - not enough yard space to build the ships fast 
enough to be that strong that quick.
    Given (b), they may be able to get away with that.  They may 
not, if the Imperium is willing to push a lot.  I doubt that they
WOULD push that hard, since pushing would invite retribution, and
NOT pushing would STILL neutralize the Alliance.

    In either case, the Alliance is removed as a 
political/military problem for the foreseeable future.

    I\'ve never actually looked at SW in FF&S.  From what I recall
of SW in the original 2300AD rules, speeds such as you decribe 
are not unreasonable when coupled with the efficient Imperial Era
fusion plants.  In the original 2300AD, a 150MW fusion plant was 
around 250-260 displacement tons, rather than the Trav standard 
of less than one ton.  Since SW is VERY small, and the limit of 
speed of an SW ship is mass of the ship, then speeds should be 
EXTREMELY high when Impy technology is added in to the picture. 
SW speeds in excess of J-8 equivalent should be quite easy 
really...

Why use this stuff

A/ Its dangerous
B/ Its expensive
C/ You cannot walk thru it

The answer is

WATER!!!!!

Water masses 1 ton per m3 therefore 1 disp ton masses 13.5 tons
Water is by mass 1/9 (one ninth) Hydrogen
13.5 / 9 = 1.5 tons by mass of Hydrogen
No problem

The water can be craked by the Fuel processor on line for anything bar
jump.  Why crack it for jump - the water will break up into conponent parts
by the heat, the oxygen will do I don\'t know what and the hydrogen will do
its stuff.  The only problem is if the oxygen impeads the reaction (like
He3 according to Tom Clancy)

Yes, they\'re in MegaTraveller. You can have \'em as bays (if you\'re at TL

In any case, the original FASA description, which is definately copyrighted,
was also uploaded.

As to caring, last time I talked to them Seeker wasn\'t on any form of
computer network.  They did, however, care about the copyright.  They did not
threaten me with a lawsuit, just explained that they were the new owners of
the FASA designs and asked me not to distribute copies any more.  Nothing
heavyhanded about it.  I strongly suspect that they don\'t have the resources
to sue anyone even in the USA, let alone internationally (I live in Canada). 
However, they paid money for the rights to these designs, and I believe that
they are under no legal obligation to publish them in order to retain these
rights.

Naturally, I asked when they planned on reprinting them, and was told that
they didn\'t know; Seeker runs on a _very_ small budget and can\'t carry many
projects at once (another of those part-time companies like DGP).  They
_wanted_ to, and indeed asked me if I\'d be interested in doing the artwork to
change the deckplans to 25mm scale because then they had no spare resources
to do that inhouse.  They also asked if I\'d like to buy the rights/molds for
the 15mm Martian Metals figures, which they had acquired but didn\'t have the
financial resources to produce themselves.  (I still don\'t, but if someone\'s
looking for a business opportunity and thinks there\'s a market for 15mm
figures I suspect that Seeker would be willing to dicker...)

Obviously Seeker hasn\'t republished these designs yet.  They may well have no
plans to do so.  If this is true, then they would probably be interested in
selling the copyright.  Another business opportunity...

My original request for movement rates got me >lots< of stuff on humans and
horses (thank you), and also a few comments on oxen, but nothing on the
various other animals. So here\'s what I found in the library:
 
 
        MOVEMENT RATES OF VARIOUS ANIMALS
 
I dug this up in the library. The numbers are probably inaccurate, since 
it is 
hard to clock a wild animal (they don\'t always want to cooperate). The 
figures 
are in kilometers per hour.
 
MAMMALS
 
Moose ("Elg")           56      short distances only
Reindeer                51      short distances only
Deer                    40-67   average-max
Horse                   60      short distances
Cheetah                 96-100  short distances only
Wolf                    6-10    normal rate
                        55-65   short distances
Dog                     69      max
Hare                    outruns a wolf
Fox                     42      average max
Seal                    35-65   average-max
Killer Whale            64      short distances
Blue Whale              37      10-15 minutes
Antilope                50-67, up to ~80
 
BIRDS
 
Geese                   40-120  migratory speed
Ducks                   60-113  migratory speed
Eagle                   45-190  average-dive
Falcon                  40-300  average-dive
Diverse waders          50-70   migratory speed
Seagull                 ~50     average
Pigeons                 50-90   migratory speed
Pigeon, carrier         90-95   average
Owl                     65-70   pressed
Raven/crow              ~50     migratory speed
Swallow                 45-60   migratory speed
Diverse small birds     30-50   migratory speed
 
FISH
 
Blue shark              69      max
Salmon                  13      average
                        43      max
Trout                   9       average
Mackerel                11-33   average-max
Sturgeon                70-104(?)       average-max
Swordfish               64      max
Sailfish                110     max
 
 
Hope this is of some use to somebody. It would be interesting to have some
figures on the movement rates of various insects, arachnids, reptiles, and
amphibians as well.

  On a completely unrelated note - Whatever happened to the Traveller

Does anyone know what has become of Digest Group Publications ? When they
discontinued their Traveller line (no more Alien modules, it felt like being
told that Christmas wasn\'t coming...), they announced an intent to produce a
game called AI. Now I thought that if AI was produced with half the love and
skill of their Traveller products, it would be well worrth a few iron tiks.
However, I\'ve seen nothing. Has anybody else ? I notice DGP don\'t have a MAIL
address in the list recently uploaded to the TML.

Sorry if this is not a very Traveller question, but if I had my way they
_would_
still be a Traveller company!

Question:  What set of rules are you going to use?  Can I use TNE to 
generate my Char.?  Any more detail about the PBEM itself (Background, 
kind of adventure, name etc.)  would be helpful in generating char. 
background.   Thanks.

  Well, I have regular Email exchanges with Rob Caswell, Traveller artist 
extraordinaire and former editor of DGP\'s MEGATRAVELLER JOURNAL.  He has 
told me that DGP folded, and never published "A.I.", their roleplaying 
game about "technology as magic".  He has also shown me thumbnails of a 
Mora Worldbook supplement he was working on when DGP folded, and it would 
of been great!  Unfortunately, with DGP out of business, it will probably 
never see print, but hopefully, someone else will jump on the Traveller 
bandwagon (but hopefully not with New Era...not to put it down, but I 
much prefer MegaTrav over the current GDW house system.  It might be a 
decent game, but it just ain\'t Traveller!)
  Actually, late next year I plan on starting to publish my own zine, to 
be called (possibly) TRAVELLER\'S EXCHANGE.  I will probably be starting 
it sometime in July or August, and will announce to the XBOAT crowd when 
I begin, so I can beg for submissions.
  Has anyone seen THE TRAVELLER CHRONICLE?  I have two issues, and-- 
while pretty inexpensively done-- it\'s not too bad.  It even has some 
articles by Terry McInnes and a couple of other HIWG-type folk.  What do 
others who have seen this nice little pub think of it?

  {
    'body' => '    I just picked up World Tamer\'s Guide on the recommendation
of whomever mentioned it on TML last week (thanks for the heads-
ups, btw.  I would never have even noticed that it was out (or
even that it had been conceived of) if not for your note.  And
it is the first thing I have seen recently from GDW that was
worth the cost).  Interesting...

    A few comments:

    The only real hole I saw in the "economic model" was the
lack of provision for "service industries".  Since the model
dealt only with production of real wealth (as opposed to the
distribution methods for same), there is no provision within
the model for things like convenience stores, or fast-food
joints.  This is fine for a starting colony, but it results in
odd results when trying to model LARGE economies...

    I haven\'t pushed all the numbers through yet, but it looks
like the technology curve was accidently inverted in the
model.  It looks like the TL improvements in production (all
kinds) are not sufficient to justify the improvements in TL...

    Also, I note the addition of hydro and wind power generation
in WTG.  Which is the WORST element of the book.  Note
that, at the prices specified in the model (MCr0.25 / KW for
hydro, around the same for wind (which are around 250 times
higher than Real World standards, btw)), an industrial worker at
TL8 (ours now) would take just under 17 years to build
sufficient hydro-power generation equipment to provide the power
required by himself in the model.
    This is possibly realistic (I haven\'t got the numbers
available for the Hoover Dam, so I couldn\'t say for sure), but
it is certainly completely pointless, since ANY of the other
power generation schemes (fission, fusion (STEVE\'S CHOICE
AWARD!), chemical power plants) is much more cost-effective
than the hydro option.
    Note that at TL8, a hydro installation producing sufficient
power for FIVE industrial labour units requires that the five
units spend 17 years building the dam, then it requires that
FOUR of the units do maintenance on the dam in perpetuity.
On the other hand, an MHD turbine requires 0.29% of the output
of ONE materials sector worker to fuel, and 0.032% of the output
of ONE Industrial sector worker to maintain indefinitely (to
provide power for the same 5 workers...).
    Note also that any serious colonization effort done by any
starfaring power should include at least one minimum size TL-9
fusion plant (or an equivalent higher TL plant).  This costs
only MCr20 (and fits into 7 displacement tons of your hold), and
thus, for a cost comparable to the capital investment for your
first 1000 people, you provide power for your first 100,000+
people...

    Other than that, the economic model was fine.  Not
necessarily accurate, but as they said, noone understands it 
well enough to build an accurate model anyways.  But it is more
than adequate for the purposes of the game (and may be the basis
for the economic model used in budgeting my next (if ever) TCS
game...


    Which (WTG) brought up the question around our house:  What
are Imperial rules/regulations/laws regarding colonization of
new worlds?
    Do you get Imperial Charters (a la H. Beam Piper\'s Chartered
Uller Company or Chartered (later Charterless) Zarathustra
Company)?  Or is it first-come-first-served?  Or some other
mechanism?
    Who (if anyone) is in charge of controlling colonization?
The IISS (seems like a logical choice)?  The Navy (they have to
defend these new worlds, maybe)?  The local Sector/Subsector
government (all those lovely new taxes...)?
    Given that multi-system states are not allowed within the
Imperium, how does the Imperium coerce colonies to act
independently from their principals (after all, Trin\'s colonies
can _say_ they are independent of Trin (and even BE independent
of Trin, legally), but how can you make them ACT "independently
of Trin" if they prefer to behave like "New Trin")?
    For that matter, does the Imperium allow members to control
(limit) immigration/emigration?  Or does it control (limit) that
itself?
    Is this last why colonization has never been an issue in the
Imperium?  Because Imperial Law makes it next to impossible to
legally colonize new worlds?

issue 1 (I haven\'t seen such ugly cover art since Judges Guild went out

Content is fair.  There is nothing as good as some of the stuff Digest 
Group put out, but it\'s as good as the stuff we are seeing in Challenge 
these days.  One nice thing is that they have a lot of background 
material (a four part series updating the Astrogator\'s Guide to the 
Diaspora sector, a similar series on the Far Frontiers sector, other 
background stuff).  There is also at least one adventure each issue, plus 
NPC and equipment descriptions.  The overall feel is much like the old

quality (yet; they are definitly improving).

began its execution phase in 1089, shortly after the Fourth Frontier War."

The library data entry goes on to describe the massive recruitment of
convicts and medical cases, refers to the Ministry of Colonization, and
intimates that colonization is ongoing and well regulated.

Anyway, as to your question of who administers colonization, it appears to
be the Ministry of Colonization.  I would guess that local political
situations would dictate additional kibbitzing, interference, or other input
from the IISS, the Navy, the local nobility, and the megacorporations.

  As near as I can tell, TDR was a group of folks who wanted to fix what 
they felt was wrong with Trav, in a vaguely organized fashion.  I believe 
they dealt specifically with MegaTrav, and were truly only interested in 
salvaging the background material.

The early CT adventures mention the Forboldn project, where the Imperial
Ministry of Colonization (or some name to that effect) was settling up a
colony
in the Regina subsector.  Also, the Tarsus boxed set mentions the process
of settling up a colony on Tarsus, chiefly from Fornice in the Mora
subsector.

Other sources mention colonies settled and/or conquered by nearby worlds.
 (Garda-Vilis in _Broadsword_, Jenghe/Regina, which is mentioned briefly in
_Twilight\'s Peak_.  I have always played that the "multi-system entity"
prohibition was used more to curb excesses, i.e. small groupings were
tolerated as long as they don\'t get out of hand.  They are a convenient way
of explaining the various Govt=6 worlds littered about.  Not to mention the
Vegan Autonomous District and the Geonee Cultural Region.

Settlement by the IISS (Their Regina HQ on Hefry probably fills the whole
planet - mentioned in _Twilight\'s Peak_) and the Navy (pick a depot, any
depot) also have precedent.  No canonical analogies to the Chartered Uller
Company (et. al.) come to mind, although various megacorporations could fit
the bill.

Hi All, 

I just finished my copy of the Traveller Chronicle #6 and I have
to say it\'s their best effort to date. Earlier issues contained
little that interested me. However, the quality of the articles
and artwork has improved. 

Issue #6 centers on the TNE pocket universe built around the
Gralyn Union. While I still don\'t like the Virus campaign, the 
pocket universe is more appealing than the official RCES background.
A sense of the old classic traveller look and feel exists. It seems
a brighter, more optimistic background for TNE rules.

The GUESS article is a little heavy on personnel info and light on
equipment. It would have benefitted from the addition of detail on 
Fidelity, Hope, and Faith starships. (Available on
ghost.cc.missouri.edu) 

I also liked Nathan Mezel\'s artwork. He manages to accent the
background well without looking too corny (as per GDW). His
1llustration of the GUESS personnel for page 15 is very good.

All in all, with the recent improvements, I think it\'s worth picking
up. 

TIA

Glenn

Development of this class began shortly after the Topas War. At that time,
FAdm Connor had proclaimed that the _Excelsior_ class battleship was the best
in the Cluster. The NFN was understandably proud of this praise, but they\'d
also realized that the new technologies being developed would soon make the
old ships obsolete. The NFN Battleship Design Team went to President Krieg
with a proposal for a new battleship, one which would be superior to the
_next_ generation of Cluster battleships, and able to go one-on-one with
Imperial battleships. President Krieg gave the go-ahead.

The _St. Genevieve_ was laid down at Sansterre in late 5630. The ship saw one
substantial redesign prior to the Serendip War, and then the Imperials
arrived. The NFN team that had designed the ship was stationed on New Home\'s
Station Omega for the Occupation, while the battleship continued to be built
on Sansterre under the supervision of Sansterre\'s ship design teams. This
lead to the controversial aspect of the _St. Genevieve\'s_ design.

With the availability of such things as H-C overdrive, another redesign was
needed. The NFN team put out a revision that used the space freed up by the
reduced fuel requirement to mount a heavy energy armament, centered on two
Factor-S spinal mounts--one meson and one APAWS. The Sansterran team had
different ideas--Sansterran warships emphasized missile firepower rather than
energy weapons, and they went ahead and modified the battleship according to
their own philosophy.

The NFN team was very angry that their energy-weapon battleship was instead
mounting 300 missile bays, and complained to the Alliance Naval Construction
Board. The NCB studied the situation, and decided that the ship would stand
as redesigned. The missile armament was deemed "good enough," and more
importantly it would take several more weeks to rebuild it the way the NFN
wanted it.

During the CLW, the _St. Genevieve_ performed admirably. FAdm Connor told the
Council that the ship was superior to all known battleships, even the
Imperial _Tigress_, and the NFN\'s ideas about what the ship should have been
were promptly forgotten as all subsequent battleship were built to Sansterran
specs.

Several of these battleships took part in the Battle of Quiver in 5648.
Although the battle was a total victory for the Alliance, it became apparent
that the Imperial Navy was beginning to modify ships on the Alliance border
with new technology that made them much more of a match for Alliance ships.
In 5649, the Alliance began refitting many of its ships with antimatter power
to maintain a technological edge over possible enemies.

The redesign saw the revival of the old NFN energy-weapon design. After
considerable lobbying, the Naval Construction Board agreed to allow one ship
to be equipped with heavy energy-weapons in 5650 as an experiment. If the
ship is a success, other battleship may also be modified.

long could it go before it ran out of life support.

I figure it has to be at least 4 man-weeks/stateroom to cover
2 people for 1 week of jumping and indidental stuff.  But even
this assumes that you need to recover life support every time
you jump.  That\'s at odds of the jump in, refuel at gas giant,
jump out, scenario.  So I would seem to be at least twice that.
Also, I assume that there is an "unrate" capacaity for emergencies.

Sounds normal so far...

Also normal, though these little worlds will be absorbed very quickly into
the major worlds\' control.

Yes, this is normal.  In my last, the SMALLEST player budget was 
MCr40,000, and that world was played on a lark, with no real 
expectation of being able to accomplish anything worthwhile.  Typical 
player budgets were on the MCr3,000,000 - MCr5,000,000 range, 
though one player could lay claim to a budget of MCr25,000,000 by the end of
the game.
Note that I deliberately removed a position with a budget of 
MCr15,000,000 from the allowable starting positions, but this was 
done ONLY because that budget was so much larger than the other 
starting positions, NOT because it was too large in and of itself.

One sector is probably more than enough.  With a uniform 
dispersion, one sector means six players are on average 15+ 
parsecs apart (which means that it will take quite a few turns (10-20) 
for routine communications between players.  This tends to be a problem).  My
last game started out in two subsectors, and added 
pretty much the balance of a sector worth of space before it was 
through.  The original two subsectors had nine players in it, and th rest of
the space was "expansion room" so they might be able to find something to
fight over (trashing home worlds got old fast (but not fast enough,
obviously))...

X-boat if they would object to his presence on this list.

        As one of the original developers of Traveller, I feel he would be
a valuable member, though, due to time constraints, his participation would
usually be low-level.

        However, some individuals may feel that any GDW presence on the
list would hinder free discussion, which they - and I - do not wish to

I vote to let Loren (GDW) to the list.  This is a open list, and anyone 
can join (right?).  Loren has helped me a lot of times, regarding 
Traveller, and I would think that he could only add to this list.

No, as long as Loren is aware that:

1) Most of us believe that the lost of the "classic" (pre-Rebellion) setting
   of TRAVELLER was a mistake.

2) Some of us remember him gloating about the "assassination" of our once and
   future Emperor, Strephon.

3) Almost all of us think that an all black cover with a single bright
colored
   line on it and a title in white lettering would be the best cover art of
   all.

4) No matter how we feel about the rebellion, The New Era is worse.

As long as he is aware that many of us on this list play the new rules with
the old setting, sure, I would be glad to welcome GDW.  I just want him to 
know what he might be getting into...

Long live the Emperor!

This list is open to anyone, including GDW.  However, when GDW subscribed to
the TML, they stated that they would not be joining this list because of 
time constraints.

I personally would love to have them here.

Difference of opinions, I\'d expect. However, having a different opinion
doesn\'t invalidate an opposite postion.

Ouch. A little touchy on this subject, I\'d guess :). While I myself am
fond of both Classic and Megatraveller, I seem to be one of the few people
on this list who actually LIKES the background of the New Era. I certainly
like the rules system more, simply due to the fact that it is (IMHO) more
coherent than the previous releases. I LOVED the Rebellion background, and
still maintain a campaign in that setting. However, I have an equal
fondness for the new background setting, and all the possibilities
inherent in it as well.

I wouldn\'t mind seeing a GDW presence here :).

Sincerely,
Jeff Franzmann

No, not as far as I\'m concerned.  I\'d be interested in what he has to say.

I suffer from chronic fingeritus -- I meant 4-5 subsectors!  My first thought on
a scenerio is to set up 6 subsectors in a 2x6 grid to give a 20 row by 24 column
surface.  Each player would get an empire of the highest tech level worlds 
nearest the centre of his subsector (it was easy to program) totalling about 
half the worlds in the subsector.

On of my friends has been encouraging me to include some rules covering trade
and commerce, with an impact on world tax levels.  Do you have an opinion on 
that?

I, for one, have no problems with Loren (and therefore GDW) recieving
this list.  Just as long as they are well aware this is the
"old surlys\' network".;-)

And while I\'m welcoming him to the list, I\'ll direct his attention
to his forward to MERC:2000, and simply say the same applies to
a 3rd Imperium sourcebook/product line.

  I don\'t recall where it is, but there is a difficult to find comment
somewhere in the combat resolution section of the CT rules that indicates
pulse lasers are -1 to hit but score 2 hits of damage.  I haven\'t looked at
the space combat rules in a bit, so I can\'t remember exact pages #\'s.  I\'ll
look tonight.

  Or, more specifically, that Loren is aware that there are some of us who
don\'t use his Empire at all, and therefore the "Black Book" rules were the
easiest thing to make work in other places of space.....

      I have never done anything but welcome Loren\'s 
all-too-infrequent posts on the Traveller lists.  I think that it is invaluable 
to us to have a willing ear at GDW; and I hardly think, recent copyright 
brouhaha notwithstanding (I think that was maybe on the TML list) that 
his presence will stifle anything, quite the opposite, in fact.

Hi All, 

Two questions for the learned lists...

1) What was the approximate TL at the end of the Rule of Man, 
i.e. Twilight or before the Long Night. I have been cleaning up
some details in my campaign and this is a loose end. I assumed 
a TL = 12 when I first wrote it. Is that accurate?

2) After reading the book "What If The Moon Didn\'t Exist?" I\'ve 
realized that the effects of a nova I had used to trigger a 
collapse would be more devastating than I thought. 

(I know it is a blatant plot device, but I set it 1000 years 
in the past to add background. The civilizations are now exploring
this region again) 

I\'d like to downgrade that stellar event to something which would
permit partial recovery within 3-4 hundred years. Would stellar
flares be applicable? What might cause them? Any other suggestions?

The major civilizations are about 12 to 18 jumps away. I\'d like to 
deny access to a particular region for about 5 - 9 hundred years.
I\'d rather not have more than a 5 jump radius of complete ruination.
I\'d like it to be survivable outside of that distance. What about
other types of collapses besides novae.

TIA

I wonder if there\'s anyone on this list that has ever seen
the 1st ed. rules for \'High Guard\'.

I\'ve never seen them nor have I ever met anyone who has.

I *have* seen some ships stats that hd both 1st & 2nd ed.
entries for each ship & there were, apparently, some significant 
differences.

Would anyone care to post up some of the changes between editions?

I used to have these.   Both of them.  First edition was an unmitigated
disaster, in terms of the ship design rules.  (This was, I believe, the
only significant difference)

The problem was that: 

1) the number of bays or turrets or barbettes needed to achieve a given
attack factor was multiplied by the ship\'s size in increments of (if
I remember correctly) 10,000 tons.  Thus if it took 10 triple laser
turrets to give you factor 9 lasers (the highest possible), it took
100 laser turrets to get that factor if your ship was 100,000 tons.
And 1000 laser turrets if your ship was 1,000,000 tons.

2) you could have 1 (ONE) battery per weapon type.

This led to certain conventions in designing warships for 1st edition
High Guard.

For Battleships, you wanted the SMALLEST ship possible that could
have the Acceleration, Jump, Armor, Weapon, and Screens that you
wanted (remember, there was NO advantage in having a bigger ship,
as you just needed to add more weapons for NO gain), AND still be
able to carry the BIGGEST Meson Spinal Mount you could get at your
tech level.

This typically resulted in 50,000-60,000 ton battleships, 10,000 ton
Cruisers, and Destroyers at around 2,000-3,000 tons, which is in
line with their displacement tonnage in later versions.

Any WARship which didn\'t a spinal mount, was built to NO LARGER than
10,000 tons.

It sucked.

There were no significant differences that I remember in the character
generation rules.  The differences in space combat rules were pretty
much given by the ONE battery per weapon type rule (ie - all lasers
had to penetrate your sandcaster rating, vs the need to design your
ship with sufficient sandcasters to stop the number of laser attacks
being made on your ship.)

You didn\'t miss much.

How did your players wriggle free from the grasp of death?  Or
did they die wimpering on the end of a spit?
 
I for one would like to hear your ongoing storyline, or any portion of
it you would like to tell.
 
And, if you are interested, I\'ll look through my game log for a juicy
adventure or two to tell.  That is, if you like to talk about these
kinds of things here (playing the game).  I run a Traveller game
session (almost) every weekend, so I\'ve got quite a few scenarios
piled up.

Traveller Chronicle is up to issue 6, and is 8.5 * 11 format 
w/ color cover  (REALLY nice one depicting the Battle of 
Coonabarbaran -- even the droyne look right)

The focus of this issue is the Gralyn Union pocket empire in 
Reavers\' Deep, authored by the TNE-Pocket project, a
sub-group of the TML.  Archives are available at ocf.berkeley.edu

Also in the issue are two Hard Times scenarios by Charles Gannon (MT),
another installment of "Pilots\' Guide to the Caledon Subsector" by
J. A. (or W.H. -- I don\'t have it with me) Keith -- Definitely CT,
and two subsectors (map and data only) of Far Frontiers Sector
(previous issues had more of these last three).

Disclamer: I\'m one of the TNE-Pocket contributors, so I may be a
little biased in saying THIS WAS THE BEST ISSUE YET!

	Quite.  Expect fleet tonnage on the general order of 1T per
KCr100 of annual budget.  If your players\' fleets have fewer
than, say, 2,000 ships, they are doing something wrong.  Not
counting fighters, of course...:-)
	And, yes, I know that several of my players had fewer than
2,000 ships.  But several of my players had SMALL main worlds...

>>> 4-5 sectors, or just a couple?
 
>> One sector is probably more than enough.

> I suffer from chronic fingeritus -- I meant 4-5 subsectors!

	Oh.  Yeah, that\'s not too bad.  It\'ll still be bigger than
your players are likely to be comfortable with, though.  They\'ll
average about eight parsecs apart, which still means four (or
six) turns round trip for one message to their neighbor\'s
capital.  And it means that what they read in a turn about their
fleets happened two (or three) turns ago, and they won\'t be able
to get orders to the fleet (to respond to the events of two (or
three) turns back) for another two (or three) turns...

	2x6 = 6?  I suppose you really meant 2x3 grid? ;-)

	By all means!  If you come up with _good_ rules, forward them
to me, please.  I used trade and commerce rules in my last one,
but the rules were quite abstract, and never really had much
effect on the game (except for the Alliance, which had picked up
a sizable amount of excess cash by encouraging intra-Alliance
trade, and by being able to protect their shipping from their
neighbors (the Belters, specifically)).  I expect that they would
have been more significant if I had used another theatre, and
allowed for the players controlling a dozen or so worlds apiece
(makes it much harder to defend, eh?).

	I also recommend, though it tends to be a lot of extra work,
using complete solar systems (as generated by Scouts, or whatever
system you like).  You get a completely different picture of the
utility of gas giants when there are more than one per system. 
And when you go to the trouble of figuring out how long it REALLY
takes to get from one of the gas giants to your main world (or
even another gas giant)...

I use the following guidelines:
    4 jumps max (no mimimum since some lower jumps may be needed to keep a
       later jump 4 hexes or less)
    Jumps should go to systems with a) High Populations, b) Class A or B
Starports,
       c) Scout Bases.  d) A system that could feed several other worlds
with a jump 1
       (basic networking -- place your hubs, where you can easily feed your
satellites).

>Anyone know how they were determined in the first place?

There is little reason to the routes in the Spinward Marches.For instance,
the route from Risek (2712) to Dhian (2510) makes no sense except that  Paya
(2509) would only be a one hex feed from the route, and the route terminates
at Inthe (2410) one hex away.

Another oddity is the route from Lunion (2124) to Aeabicci (1824) to
Lanic(1924).  The route from Luniont o Aeabicci makes sense, but Lanic is a
one hex jump from Aebicci and Lanic is a Class E star port with no scout
base and from my Spinward Marches map doesn\'t classify for a large
population.

For the most part, the map follows simple networking basics (with a little
historic expansion put into things such as the route from Regina to Extolay
(3 - Jump 1\'s).

Rob Miracle came up with an intelligent response as to a good
system.

To that system I would like to add the following:

Once a totally logical XBoat Route Pattern has been determined,
MESS IT UP A LITTLE by adjusting a few routes in totally illogical
ways to reflect the money and power of whiny nobility and politicians
who want xboats to come directly to THEIR systems.

(This might account for some of the illogical routes seen in the
Spinward Marches).

A lot of xboat routes maps appeared in issues of Travellers\' Digest, by 
Digest Group Publications.

	Deneb, Corridor, Vland, Core, Magyar, and a bunch of others.

I think the following would be considerations for the establishment of an
xboat station on a world:

	Its position astrographically speaking.

	Its starport classification.

	Whether or not it has a Scout base (and/or Navy base).

	What type of travel zone it is (green, amber, interdicted).

	Other things being equal, the other stats of the UWP would also be
	considered.

	Then there\'s politics.  :)

I\'d like to use the current X-boat route thread to remind
folks of one of DGP\'s less-known but DANDY oversights, namely:

Their X-Boat routes have this tendency to MISS the way stations!

Kinda embarassing, considering the WS\'s are maintainence and
routing hubs.

My solution was to re-place the WS\'s, since that was easier than
redrawing the map.

It also allowed me to correct another problem I noticed while
checking the "off-route" problem, namely in most sectors there
are too damn few Way stations.  Some sectors have as low as
three, while the Spinward Marches had five (even though the
Impeium only controlled half of it.

I settled on a "standard" density of 1WS per 2 subsectors.
Some areas (like Core and the Marches) would still be a little
above average, but it was easier to rationalize than before,
when they _really_ stood out.

  Statements I go by:
        1.  X-Boat routes are *expensive*.  Dedicated, high performance
jump craft with very expensive data-banks and trained pilots are not to be
squandered.
        2.  Merchant ships hauling mail are *not* expensive.  They were
going there anyway.

  Basic rules I go by:
        1.  Capitol of given subsector is joined by X-boat routes to
capitols of ajacent subsectors.
        2.  The central world in a high-tech clusters of worlds (I go with
a Jp2 cluster, avg TL 13+) are joined to similar clusters by X-Boat routes.
        3.  X-Boat routes *always* take the shortest route between two
points.
        4.  In any condition where there are more than 5 seperate routes in
a sub-sector, remove the lowest-tech routes first until you only have 5. 
These "abandoned" routes will see plenty of frieghter traffic anyway.
        5.  Border areas and fringes generally only have one or two
X-boat"backbones", largely because of rules 1 & 2.  
        6.  Amber Zoned worlds are avoided unless it prevents rule 1 or 2.
        7.  Red Zoned worlds are avoided regardless.

 The rules I would be inclined to assume:

 1) No jump is longer than 4 Parsecs (this is required by the 
 design of the XBoat).

 2) Preference is given to A starports, though B can be used.  
 Connect eligible starports.

 3) A starports that are on worlds with less than population 6 may 
 be bypassed.

 4) C starports are only used to provide connections between A and 
 B starports that otherwise could not be connected.  No more than 
 one C starport may be used in a connection to a B starport; no 
 more than two C starports may be used to connect A starports.

 5) D, E, and X starports are never served.

 6) Sector capitals are always served by the XBoats.

 7) Subsector capitals will be served, regardless of starport, if 
 they are within J3 of a served planet.  If they are class A or B, 
 apply rules 2 and 3.

 On a few randomly generated test sectors, these rules worked 
 pretty well...

First edition turret and bay weapons had a certain point rating assigned

total by the ship tonnage in kilotons (this applied to ships over 1000

Notes: Has the usual Alliance hardware: two computers, scoops, NH3 fuel
system, enhanced output maneuver drive, afterburning power plant,
Helson-Canomaar Overdrive, superconducting armour, anti-missile fire control.
The ship can reach 20G on afterburner, but has an agility of 8 when firing.
If the star trigger ceases fire, agility is 10, and if the lasers also cease
fire agility is 12.

The ! code represents the star trigger meson gun. This weapon is designed to
flare stars (or ignite gas giants) when fired in conjunction with two others.
It can also be used in ship-to-ship combat. It\'s damage rating is not yet
defined exactly, but certainly very high--probably around Factor-ZZ.

Carries 5 95-ton and 15 30-ton small craft, 500 90-ton fighters. Has 5
100-ton launch tubes. Has 60,000 ton missile magazine (20,000
battery-rounds), 6500 ER missile gunners, 50 tonne AM containment pod, 15,000
battery-rounds in XO racks, 12 parsecs jump fuel. The considerable cargo
space is generally fitted with modular office space appropriate to the
specifc function of the ship.

The Enterprise-class is (as far as anyone knows) the largest, most powerful,
and most expensive warship ever built. The ships are labelled "star
destroyers" after a fictional class of ships similar in purpose (and almost
identical in size). The design originated within the NFN as a pipe-dream--the
sort of battleship they\'d like to build but never could.

Following the CLW, the Alliance Navy had requirements for ships with
substantially different missions, all of which would need to be very large.
These were as follows:

During the Occupation, New Home\'s Station Omega, a deep space command and
control station, had served as Alliance Navy headquarters. It had performed
quite well, and was never located by the Imperium, but the Alliance Navy
command was concerned about the possibility that it would be found in a
future action. In response to this danger, the Naval Construction Board
issued a requirement for a mobile version of Station Omega, which could run
away if it was found by a large force, or destroy a small scout force.

In 5646 Alliance R&D completed Project Starburst, the development of star
trigger technology. The star trigger required huge ships to mount it and the
power plant needed to run it (it uses twice the entire power output of a St.
Genevieve-class battleship). The Alliance Navy wanted to build at least two
sets of three.

By the late 5640\'s the Alliance\'s superiority in battleship power was falling
fast. The Navy wanted to make up for that by building something so impressive
that the mere sight of it would terrify any enemy.

These requirements were combined and put together into one ship based on the
old NFN design. The class\' primary function is a deep space command and
control center. In addition to serving as the emergency capital of the
Alliance, the class will also serve as flagships for the Numbered Fleets. The
class also acts as part of the Alliance\'s strategic deterrent, ready to
destroy enemy systems in response to an attack. Finally, the class can be
used as a giant battleship in a major fleet action or in gunboat diplomacy.

The Alliance Navy has ordered six of these ships, but to date only four have
been completed. These ships have been assigned to the numbered fleets as
flagships. To date, only the _Macross_ has seen any action.

When the class was proposed, there were no other battleships so large in
existence--the closest were the million-ton battleships built by the Imperium
centuries ago (and in mothballs for most of that time). The meson gun simply
made giant battleships too vulnerable to destruction.

With the advent of the afterburning power plant, things are changing--meson
guns simply can\'t track afterburning ships. Because of this, large
battleships (with afterburners) are making a comeback. As of 5650, aside from
the Alliance\'s four ships, the Imperium is refitting ten ancient million-ton
battleships, and the Aslan Clans controlling the Riftspan Reaches have
ordered at least two 1.75 million ton battleships.

    'body' => 'Recently I managed to dig up a few old issues of Challenge
I had lying around semi-lost and an issue of the Traveller\'s
Digest. I found some interesting thing in them concerning
Classic Traveller...

The Traveller\'s Digest is copyrighted 1986 (the publishing date
is 344-1112, ho ho) and has an interview with Marc Miller about
\'The Future of Traveller\'. There were some interesting quotes -
"If I had to do it over again, I think I could do a 1,000 percent
better job, knwoing what I know now". I dunno about this one.
While the mechanics have certain improved in MT and TNE (which I
haven\'t seen yet) I think the essential Traveller backdrop remains
very intact and largely unchanged, which I like, but I don\'t know
if the new games are "1,000% better". Another quote - "Traveller is 10
years old and not at it\'s peak." Hm. Maybe he changed his mind. Then
again, Traveller has survived a long time and it\'s not all that
surprising that it\'s gone through a few incarnations. 

Most intersting is the mention of new products. Spinward Campaign is
mentioned and I have that, but they also mention a Darrians supplement,
which I\'ve never seen or heard of. Anyone?

Coincidently enough, in Challenge #29, there\'s another interview.
(And woah, Loren Wiseman is listed as \'Managing Editor\'. He had
a real job when I was, like, 16. Wow. Anyways...) This interview/
massive-back-patting lists all the GDW publication up until 1987
and _doesn\'t_ list Darrians, so I guess it got shelved. Anyone know
why? (Loren?) Not too much meat in this interview, but there are some 
more products I\'ve never seen - \'Alien Realms\' and \'Atlas of the
Imperium\'. Anyone care to fill me in on what\'s in these?

Anyways, Traveller was 15 in 1992 and will be 20 years old in 1997.
That\'s not that far off. Considering the number of games that have
come and gone in that time, it\'s a real testament to the great
game(s) Traveller is. Traveller has survivied a lot of trends in
the industry (re: the \'dark setting\' thread) but has come
through looking a lot today like it did in 1977. Well, somewhat.

Just thought I\'d share that historical data with the rest of the list. :)

Ethan

PS. Anyone got a copy of K\'kree for CT they wouldn\'t mind parting with?
Anyone reasonably close to Ottawa so I don\'t have to pay shipping 
halfway across the subsector?

That would be Alien module 8 (the only one that I have managed to get 
hold of btw). I don\'t know how it compares with other Alien modules 
but as I recal it it includes info about darian history and culture. 
Some info about the Darrian homeworld, stats for the Darrian 
Confederation, and an adventure outline.
It was some time since I read it but as I think that I tought it was 
pretty good.

I\'ve seen those, but I hav\'nt got em. \'Alien Realms\' included 
adventures from different alien viewpoints I think, and \'Atlas of the 
Imperium\' just contained sector maps of th Imperium.

those pesky player characters can make it work.  I\'ll be happy to provide

I had lying around semi-lost and an issue of the Traveller\'s
Digest. I found some interesting thing in them concerning
Classic Traveller...

The Traveller\'s Digest is copyrighted 1986 (the publishing date
is 344-1112, ho ho) and has an interview with Marc Miller about
\'The Future of Traveller\'. There were some interesting quotes -
"If I had to do it over again, I think I could do a 1,000 percent
better job, knwoing what I know now". I dunno about this one.
While the mechanics have certain improved in MT and TNE (which I
haven\'t seen yet) I think the essential Traveller backdrop remains
very intact and largely unchanged, which I like, but I don\'t know
if the new games are "1,000% better". Another quote - "Traveller is 10
years old and not at it\'s peak." Hm. Maybe he changed his mind. Then
again, Traveller has survived a long time and it\'s not all that
surprising that it\'s gone through a few incarnations.

Most intersting is the mention of new products. Spinward Campaign is
mentioned and I have that, but they also mention a Darrians supplement,
which I\'ve never seen or heard of. Anyone?

Coincidently enough, in Challenge #29, there\'s another interview.
(And woah, Loren Wiseman is listed as \'Managing Editor\'. He had
a real job when I was, like, 16. Wow. Anyways...) This interview/
massive-back-patting lists all the GDW publication up until 1987
and _doesn\'t_ list Darrians, so I guess it got shelved. Anyone know
why? (Loren?) Not too much meat in this interview, but there are some
more products I\'ve never seen - \'Alien Realms\' and \'Atlas of the
Imperium\'. Anyone care to fill me in on what\'s in these?

Anyways, Traveller was 15 in 1992 and will be 20 years old in 1997.
That\'s not that far off. Considering the number of games that have
come and gone in that time, it\'s a real testament to the great
game(s) Traveller is. Traveller has survivied a lot of trends in
the industry (re: the \'dark setting\' thread) but has come
through looking a lot today like it did in 1977. Well, somewhat.

Just thought I\'d share that historical data with the rest of the list. :)

Darrians was (I believe) the last Alien module for CT.  I got my copy only
six months ago, direct from GDW, for $8.  The may still have some in stock.
 Unfortunately, I have lost their phone number.

   Darrians did come out (I have a copy somewhere), though I can\'t recall the
year; it was the last of the series.  Alien Realms is a collection of
adventures for alien characters, meant as a companion to the Alien Module
series (specifically, Aslan, Vargr, Zhodani, and Droyne).  Atlas of the
Imperium is a set of starmaps showing positions of all the systems in the
Imperium, xboat routes, and, I think, the names of high-population worlds,
but not a lot of detail (I\'ve never seen this one, alas).

   Oh, and Loren was Editor way back in the beginnings of The Journal of the
Travellers\' Aid Society, around 1979. :)

that the Ancients dumped them on a world where they couldn\'t eat the food

rest of the Darrian Worlds, with lesser effect.  End result:  they dropped a 
couple of tech levels, still have a small fleet of T16 ships, and are almost 
back up to 16 again.  real cutting edge stuff.  No one wants to mess with the
Darrians, as they claim they can do that to _any_ system (don\'t mess with us,

Oh, yes, and the major cultural effect of the Maaghiz (sp?)/EMP blast was 
that they now build _everything_ with non-electronic backup.  Air/rafts with

It would appear you suffer more from youth than anything else :-)

Aliens 8: Darrians - describes the minor human race Darrians that inhabit
   subsector I of the Spinwoard Marches.

Aliens 9: Alien Realms - Provides a mixed bag of adventures for Droyne, 
   Vargr, K\'kree, and Aslan.

Atlas of the Imperium - From what I recall, I listing of the stars in all
   imperial sectors, plus (full sector) maps.

I have a spare Alien Realms (and Aliens 1: Aslan); send me mail if you 
are interested...

Alien Module (erm - can\'t remember the number), Darrians, detailed the Darrians,
their culture, their military forces and their "hole card" - the Star Trigger. A
neat little module, fitted them nicely into line with the \'Marches, nice
Danforth illos. Nothing exceptional however. 

It was always rather rare - I picked mine up in America the only time I\'ve ever
been there - and rapidly disappeared again as Traveller started doing its
impression of a chaemelon on a  flashing eric. 

We all hoped that the rejig of the Alien coverage from the brief GDW format to
the unsurpassed DGP masterpieces would include Darrians, but as GDW managed to
piss off their best licencee before that happened, we must mourn a foreever
lost chance.

In summary, useful as a reference and a completist goodie only unless you want
to run in the Darrian Confederation or use the Star Trigger (like I did - but
there aren\'t any rules for it).

It\'s interesting to note that Marc Miller never did \'do it over again\'.

It seems, from reading the credits on the rulebooks, that the MegaTraveller
re-write was done primarily by the folks at Digest Group Publications,
without a lot of input, checking, or even proofreading by GDW\'s Traveller
people.  It\'s sad to say, but I think a lot of the problems with
MegaTraveller were caused by this, and generally sloppy work on the part of
both groups.

Traveller: The New Era is indeed a complete re-write of Traveller, but
again, this was after Marc Miller left the company.  From reading the
credits on that book, it seems that most of the work was done by Dave
Nilsen and Frank Chadwick.  T:TNE uses the Twilight:2000 role-playing
system, which IMHO has no relation to Traveller (although GDW Official
Company Policy is that the T2k2 system is a direct descendant of original
Traveller, through unspecified provenance).

It would have been interesting to know what changes Marc would have chosen
to make to the game, if HE had to do it over again.

I\'ve had my hands on both.  I believe I own a copy of the Spinward Campaign
(or at least, most of it - purchased used, and rather beaten up).  I have
read, but do not own, the Darrians supplement.  Both are the 8.5x11
(large-size) modules produced late in the life-cycle of Classic Traveller.
It\'s quite possible that these were pulled from the shelves when 
MegaTraveller was released, so there wasn\'t much chance to pick them up.

Spinward Campaign is a campaign-seed (not really a campaign in the sense
that The Traveller Adventure is a ready-made campaign) set, logically enough,
in the Spinward Marches immediately after the 5th Frontier War.

Darrians is a typical Classic Traveller aliens module, and covers the
Darrians in detail.  Not much to say, but this is one I should pick up at
some point.

Loren edited _The Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society_ (direct
predecessor to Challenge, and a truly excellent single-product magazine),
all the way back to issue #1 (and since the Journal was quarterly, go
figure what age you were when he started that particular \'real job\').
If Loren is reading, didn\'t you win some awards with the Journal, too?  :-)

> more products I\'ve never seen - \'Alien Realms\' and \'Atlas of the
> Imperium\'. Anyone care to fill me in on what\'s in these?

I own both of them.  They\'re both the large-size (8.5x11) modules that GDW
produced during the last years of Classic Traveller.  The Atlas of the
Imperium contains computer-generated maps of the WHOLE imperium - I believe
the data files for these maps is the original source for the sector files on
the archive site.  In any case, it\'s just maps showing the locations of all
worlds in the sector, and naming the high-population and subsector capitol
worlds.  This is interesting, but not terribly useful, but does make a neat
wall mural (tape the maps together edge-to-edge, and color occupied \'hexes\'
in in light colors - if you want to get weird, color the \'mains\' in in
slighly darker colors).

Alien Realms is a set of short adventures, each one featuring one of the
alien races in one way or another.  Sometimes the PCs are aliens, and other
times the PCs are humans who have to deal with the aliens.

> Anyways, Traveller was 15 in 1992 and will be 20 years old in 1997.

Keep the dust off those old Books 1-8, and start planning your Traveller
20th Anniversary Campaign now.  :-)

At xboat71, you told me that you were the author of LIBRARY for
1992 (with three built-in sectors) by Jo Jaquinta (is that you??), that
joy and wonder ("Good Job!", in case you haven\'t been told recently...). 

first...
   Where\'s the instruction file in ISLANDS (i.e. "read.me"? The file that
tells me how to rotate the planet...)
   
after this bit of detail...
  How do I modify the details of a computer-generated world?
  How do I print a (PostScript) map of the planet?
  How do I add more sectors... and modify the old data to fit 
  How do I create a pre-generated planet?

and finally
  You mentioned the "Traveller Tools Group".  Sounds good (although I am
only a rudimentairy programmer), where do I sign up?


Thanks a lot,

I just found this article in USENET, on chlorine atmospheres and their
implications.  Does anyone of you PhD\'s here care to expand on what other
atmospheres would entail?

Even if not, I still enjoyed this article... has anyone on the List followed
the entire thread?

You can use chlorine instead of oxygen as the oxidizer in the atmosphere.
There will still be fire, and a technical civilization could develop. 

Positing a chlorine breathing life-form, we get:

a) green skies. very cool special effect.
b) a rather complex biochemistry. Chlorine can only bind to one
other atom compared to oxygen, which can bind to two. This suggests that
we need some other atom to make the complex molecules of life possible.
How about phosphorous? The Kloro "carbohydrates" could consist of carbon
chains
that branch where P atoms connect, and the exact conformation dictated by the
presence of chlorine atoms instead of hydrogen. Or maybe they\'d use basically
earth style organic compounds, since you can get oxygen and hydrogen by
dissociating water. I dunno, and it\'s not terribly important, unless one
of the characters is a biochemist.

Points to consider (off the top of my head):

Water: I believe water should be stable in the presence of chlorine, but since
their electronegativities (how well they grab electrons from other atoms) are so
close, it becomes likely that the equilibrium between the seas and the atmosphere
would lead to lots of HCl or HOCl in the sea -- acidic oceans! Nifty. I can see
a lot of chemical engineering possibilities there. Perhaps instead of an
industrial revolution they have a chemical revolution -- with the coastal states
(already wealthy because of sea trade) funding chemical research and becoming the
super dominant powers. LOTS of sociological implications, even if you assume a
basically human style psychology (but it\'s more fun if you don\'t :-)

Metal distribution: The geology of ore deposits is heavily affected by the
atmospheric composition. There\'s a lot of iron ore (low-grade, but so what?)
on Earth because iron oxide is more or less insoluble -- I think. Go to the
library and compare the solubilities of oxides and chlorides of metals to see
which metals the Kloros are likely to use. This is a very rough first
approximation, since there are all sorts of other factors, but for most purposes
(up to and including a full-length novel) it should be sufficient. Another factor
is that almost all water on Kloro is going to acidic -- this is another factor in
the metal distributions.

Competition with Earth (happy answer): They and we shouldn\'t. The other sides\'
atmosphere is completely toxic and corrosive, and a general pain to deal
with.
Why try to kill each other when ignoring the other is so much easier. It is 
entirely possible for the two interstellar states to inhabit the same volume
of space because we *can\'t* use the other sides\' worlds.

Competition with Earth (unhappy answer): We will. All it takes is for a few
individuals on either side to be stupid, and you can have all out interstellar
war -- especially stupid since it\'s a completely pointless and futile effort.
But hey, that\'s life.

(Whew! I didn\'t realize I had that much verbiage in me. The Kloros are
*definitely* going in my next SF campaign -- they\'re too cool to ignore.)

What?  You\'ve already forgotten Book 0?  (Some sort of introduction to

A leser, but mildly interesting, Question...

Within the Third Imperium (Classic) , under what circumstances does the
"run-of-the-mill" dirtsider\'s life intersect with the greater concerns of
interstellar affairs?

Off the bat...
    Big Business (From Empire-wide megacorps to businessess based on
                  nearby, high-pop worlds)
    The Navy (THE reason for the Empire\'s existance)
    Imperial Taxation (For the above Navy, plus Marines)
    Multistellar News services (The TNS, Domain News, etc...)
        "        Cultural associations (To the Imperial Rotary Club to the 
                                        Imperial Catholic Church (Deneb
Rite))
    The Nobility (as celebrities, leaders)
    Scientific Organizations (probably as Info Exchanges, rather than 
                  a megaresearch \'guild\')

What other structures/associations would tend to have interstellar
connections?

More interestingly, what associations would tend to remain system-bound?

----

Continuing along this thread...

I recently posted a profile of a "noble leader" in TML (Queen
whats-her-name, a marchoniess in the New Era Regency).  How would similar
"minor political forces" operate in an interstellar society?  I\'m thinking
of, say, the President of a TL8 high-pop world in Classic Spinward Marches or
the Ruling Circle of a TL 13 high-pop world in Rebellion-Era Core sector.

How would the concerns of a High-pop world differ from a moderate-pop
world?  A low-pop world?

----

And what about not-so-minor officals, say subsector to Domain nobility
(ie. the Archduke of Sol, the Duke of Trin\'s Veil subsector).  I
understand their military responsibilities, and their responsibility to
"keep the trade lanes open": do they have any others?  How do the
"identities" of the different sectors differ? (If I recall correctly,
Daibei worlds like tricolour flags, Verge people are rebellious, the
Spinward Marches folk have a rough "Colonial" attitude and Core has
entirely too much wealth and privelege)

(Anyone cares to add more "regional stereotypes"?)

And why would these worlds in a sector bond together like this?  Why
aren\'t they just seperate, individual, isolated societies, bound together
only by the Emperor, the Navy and the Megacorps?  Since contact with
insystem folk is so much quicker, how could they maintain "fellow feeling"
with a world a subsector away?  

Thinking about it, I feel that the "atmosphere" of a sector would be
strongly dictated by the high-pop, TL C+ systems in that sector.  The
sector capital and subsector capitals would also influence the "mindset"     
of a given sector.  Also, a shared history would also sustain fellow
feeling, especially pre-imperial, (sub)sector-wide governments.

----

A help would be the nature and scope of the nobility\'s economic powers,
since it is via those powers that the subsector, sector, and Domain
nobility would most strongly distinguish one sector from another.  What
can be banned from one sector, but allowed in another?  Why would a
sector-wide manufactoring concern in Massillia be unheard-of in Diasporia?
A TL 5 moviestar, loved across Gushmerge, be laughed at at Vland?

And what does it take to be famous across the entire Imperium?  A musician
on the level of Mozart (interesting: Mozart himself was at about TL 3)?  
But a society of 15 trillion people should have at least 10,000 Mozarts at
any one time.  A genius on the scale of Newton?  Again, the same problem
as Mozart - actually, even worse; a TL 3  Newton would be merely reinventing
the wheel for the 9354th time.

Again, I suspect that only genuses on TL F - G worlds would obtain the
Imperium-wide fame they deserve.  

But, what about all those people at TL 8 or 5 or B?  Are they just treated
like country bumpkins?  And, in situations where the high-pop worlds are 
lower than at, say TL C, how do the other systems react to it?

Of couse, all and any responses are welcome.

 \'Darrians\' was indeed printed. I own a copy. It was, as far as I can
determine, the last CT product printed by GDW (outside of some Challenge
articles).

 \'Alien Realms\' is a scenario book which concentrates on the various
alien races. Each scenario involves either playing or being heavily
involved with one or more of the major races. Not a bad product aside
from its thinness.

 \'Atlas of the Imperium\' is a book of sector grids for the area shown
on all the standard "Imperial Space" maps in MT and TNE. All systems
were placed, and had the data that was normally shown on maps in
those days: dry or wet world, gas giants, port rating, bases, and
allegiances. Only High Population worlds were named, though, and XBoat
routes were absent.  The sector files available from the old archives
were the basis for this book. I\'m told that GDW will consider reprinting
the Atlas if they get enough requests (like enough to pre-sell most of the
print run), but won\'t do so otherwise. Considering the wide-open nature
of TNE and the prospect of "your very own Pocket Empire wherever you want"
I should think that reprinting the Atlas might be a good and desirable
thing, but this is the wrong list to be discussing such urges ;)

>(Anyone cares to add more "regional stereotypes"?)

Antarean humans/Vargr work well with Vargr/humans. 

Corridor people are somewhat "paranoid" and military-minded (they are
very sensitive to TNS reports about defense cuts!).

Vland citizens are very stuffy, and tend to go on at the drop of a hat
about "Ziru Sirka this" and "Vilani Main never lost jump drive" that
and "five thousand year empire" the other. They also can never do
anything in less than a group of three.

Gushemegites and Dagudashaagites tend to get annoyed at the above,
and exhibit a noticeable "we\'re not Vland, dammit!" attitude, as they
go about their business in their asymmetrical clothes on worlds that
have been settled for thousands of years.

Ilelish residents "buck the Imperial trend" more than most (but don\'t
stoop to outright revolt, like Vergers). Some of them are known to be
outright odd even in faraway places ("Mad as a Dlani"...).

And don\'t forget that different regions of the Imperium have a
different "accent" based on their Galanglic dialect (Transform, Rim
Anglic, etc.). I would expect the Vilani-speaking worlds to have their
own "Vilani accent" as well, but a better linguist than I will have to
codify it. Basically I think it would involve breaking up consonant
clusters that don\'t occur in Vilani, and perhaps mutating "o" into
"au" because the former doesn\'t occur in Vilani either. That and
having trouble when people pronounce the same thing in different tones
of voice. (I once worked with a Thai student who said she had some
trouble understanding English because people kept pronouncing the same
word with different intonation and expecting it to mean the same
thing!)

Television, the drug of the nation. er, subsector.  Look at Terra - 5 or so
billion people and a really disproportionate amount of entertainment comes
out of one place - Hollywood. Although a lot of places have very strong 
regional entertainment industries (India, Hong Kong/China), you still get
Hollywood stuff there. Very rarely does it happen the other way around either
(how many Hong Kong pop starts have broken through on the North American
market?). It\'s very possible the cultural commodities could be just as, if 
not more valuable than more concrete ones. (Pirates make a raid to grab the 
latest shipment of 2-hour holovids from Regina!) Look at some examples today
-
would you rather be in the uranium mining business or in the film business?
Of course, the average asteroid belt dweller has little choice, but a lot
of uranium probably has to go out to get a decent film in.

Given the influences of technology transfer from high tech to low tech worlds
and the influence of cultural industries the same way, I\'d agree with you.
Most of this influence relies on wide channels of communication, something
somewhat lacking in the Imperium. Still, I think a lot of cultural trading
would go on. (Why do I keep thinking of EuroDisney? I dunno. Maybe \'cause
it\'s
the worlds biggest & worstest cultural export to date. Bad example).

Also, I think that the big interstellar organizations would have a life
and culture of their own, which would have a tendancy to influence cultures
across a large reach of space. Being a member of the IISS would be a 
pretty universal thing, probably because the Scout service goes out of its
way to make it so. So wherever you go, a scout is a scout, more or less.
Due to character\'s habits of hanging around familiar places (ie. getting the
free fuel for your scout ship at the local scout base) I think this would
somewhat homogenize Imperial culture for PC\'s.

Mozart, famous? What % of the Earth\'s population do you think heard of him
before he died? Mozart seems big, but that\'s because he\'s had time to get
to everyone. Unfortunately, that amount of time was a lot longer than his
lifespan. And Newton - a lot of people thought he was a wacko back in his
day.
Not to mention he really believed that the world was going to end at the turn

of his century (or something close to that - I make no promises about real
world historical accuracy). I\'d expect that most geniuses would go unnoticed
for a long time by most people.

>Again, I suspect that only genuses on TL F - G worlds would obtain the
>Imperium-wide fame they deserve.  

Unfortunately, I think the only people who will get famous Imperium-wide
are the Emperor and a lot of pop movie stars. Kinda like today. I think the
question is not \'Who will be the Mozart of the 3rd Imperium?\' but \'Who will
be the Madonna, Kevin Costner and Steven Spielberg?\'

>But, what about all those people at TL 8 or 5 or B?  Are they just treated

It depends on how you interpret tech level - level of manufacture, level of
imported or remenant artifacts, level of general population understanding?
A lot of agricultural worlds short distances from high-tech, industrial
woulds could have manufacturing TLs of 0. Just import everything. Especially
if the other world doesn\'t grow much food. It might be possible for two
worlds in one star system to be like this, making it even more plausible.
On some TL F worlds, you might find manufacturing capability of level F, but
general populace comprehension of only around level A.

I don\'t think high tech worlds would look down totally at low tech ones -
look at how North Americans love camping and outdoorsy stuff. Some low tech
worlds might make a lot of tourist dollars by being low tech. Of course,
some low-tech worlds would be backwaters. Again, look around you. Some
"third world" nations do ok, some are ruthlessly exploited by large
corporations
or have repressive governments.

Woah, long response. Hope I don\'t break anyone\'s mailbox.

\'big-boys\' interact with everyday dirtsiders...

I would add:

"Illegal Organisations"
\'Wanted on Thripeen? For a mere CR25k we can smuggle you offworld to 
Kirkwerg, who don\'t have an extradition treaty...\'. Aaah, Thieves Guild Gold 
Card! That will do nicely... There just has to be interstellar Mafias, 
Triads, etc. There would be so many opportunities for bending the rules when 
you\'re operating between say ten worlds each with its different pecularities 
of law.

"Interstellar Banks"
The standard banking mechanism for the Imperial Credit; individual worlds 
may have their own money or use credits, but the Interstellar banks are 
still the only recognised way of transfering (laundering?) money between 
systems (except for carrying large piles of gold bars, etc. - it should be 
pointed out that gold bars are not generally accepted currency in local 
bars, restaurants, etc.)
Of course, banking should also include everything money-related - 
interstellar stocks, shares, trading, brokerage, insurance (how do you 
insure your cargo, or even your ship, if the system isn\'t interstellar?)

With regard to Scientific Organisations, they do not have to be megaresearch 
guilds to avoid the \'info exchange\' tag. Almost any scientific undertaking 
which requires exploration or dissemination of information to the public is 
likely to come to the attention of the local populace: "Famed off-world 
explorer Indiana "Han" Jones Solo discovers ancient Thripean culture in 
jungle", "Interstar Nature Protection League mounts campaign to prevent 
extinction of Thripean Two-Clawed Jungle Tiger", "Imperial Scientific League 
visits Thripeen to distribute anti-smoking leaflets."

SOME THOUGHTS ON LEADERS
State banquet on sector capital...
Young Diplomat: "So from whence do you hail, dear lady?"
Lady: "I am the Duchess of Thripeen."
YD: "Oh, yes, I\'ve heard of you. You must have plenty of time for leisure - 
I hear you\'ve only a few thousand subjects on your jungle-bound planet. I 
guess it _only_ got colonised because it gives access to the western sector 
planets."
L: (scowl) "I have so little time, actually. Mostly I\'m signing orders 
closing the starport because some chauvinistic diplomatic wimp called 
Thripeen \'a pit\' or somesuch. It\'s amazing how quickly they come back 
grovelling when they remember their pitiful little jump-2 traders _have_ to 
pass though my \'humble\' little world.
YD: "Oh, er, yes, er..."
L: "I\'m sorry, I didn\'t catch the name of your planet?"
YD: "My, is that the time. Must dash!"

More seriously, a campaign I played in as a Scout Corp Intelligence officer 
with two colleagues eventually brought the three of us to the level of 
Count(esse)s and we were given control of a world in a developing subsector 
on the Imperial/Aslan border. Countess Marava started an interstellar nature 
protection league - gave her plenty of chance to travel and gave us cover 
for some covert operations. Count Farrar controlled a largish navy; as Count 
Lilly I had control of our system\'s industrial base.
In summary, we had to balance a wide range of tasks, both as nobility and as 
ISC covert operatives:
Subsector stability: there were various powers who each wanted to own more 
land, exploit more planets, convert all to their religion, etc. We had to 
keep the situation stable, preferably without throwing in the navy - a 
clumsy act at the best of times. Other powers mysteriously lost technical 
data (particularly that of general use to the Imperium), one planet went 
bankrupt (after some careful dealing by ourselves which allowed us to buy up 
most of its heavy industry through cover companies, thus achieving control 
over an otherwise unstable populace); we murdered the odd foreign 
intelligence operative (the other planets wanted to infiltrate us and keep 
our Imperial nose out of their affairs); we blatted the drugs baron and 
restored the rightful rulers to their throne; we \'matched\' certain local 
nobles and \'arranged\' marriages to strengthen the more stable planets; we 
coordinated naval patrols of the outer systems where Aslan raiders were 
harrying shipping; we developed starports on nearby low-tech worlds (over 
which we had nominal control) in order to develop a second trade route which 
was controlled solely by us and avoided the Aslan areas; we also wanted to 
build our industrial base using low tech materials from these worlds (okay, 
so call it slave labour...). Clearly we couldn\'t handle every penny of our 
accounts, but we could direct matters, e.g. investment in research into new 
weaponry, psionics, a new gas giant refinery technique, etc. Count/Admiral 
Farrar decided which new warships he wanted built, Countess Marava designed 
her own mansion, I... er, I think I just sat in my concrete bunker and got 
more and more paranoid about attempted assassination - that\'s just another 
hazard of being a ruler - there\'s always someone who disagrees with your 
methods.
None of this was possible without diplomacy, for although we had a great 
deal of power and (secret) Imperial backing, we had to balance other 
factors: the most powerful faction was a fairly independent trading 
alliance, so we wanted to keep them sweet because we couldn\'t (directly) 
control them. And then the subsector Duke was nearing retirement, so that 
meant someone would have to step into his shoes... I\'ll leave you to imagine 
the back-stabbing that went on for that...

With regard to inter-system relations,
(a) The \'colony\' factor is a very strong determinant - almost all worlds 
will have been colonised by people from other nearby worlds in a gradual 
process, spreading out from core (not Core) worlds (probably these are now 
the X-boat routes, which explains why some x-boat routes don\'t seem too 
logical).
(b) Add some star battles in which planet A helped planet B (deliberately, 
inadvertantly, for their own gain, because of a treaty agreement or just 
because they\'re nice people)
(c) Add some mutually beneficial trade arrangements - planet A has the rare 
mineral XYZ which planet B (being older and better developed) swaps for its 
industrial goods.
Ok, stir gently, right now you\'ve got some planets in an alliance.

Now, take (a), but someone left the colony there to die or the colony was a 
group of outcasts. Add (b) where planet A didn\'t bother to aid planet B (or 
was even the attacker themselves). Mix in some (c) but planet B swindles 
planet A by sending them faulty and unrepairable goods and crashes their 
stock markets.
Ok, now you\'ve got a couple of planets who hate each other\'s guts.

We haven\'t even started on the wider issues - Imperial oppression/help, 
similar government types (on planets A and B), the religious nutters on 
planet C, etc. As the Young Diplomat found out to his cost above, some 
planets may only have 10 inhabitants but if they\'re a critical lynch pin on 
a trade route, or the only ones who know where the local lanthanum mine is, 
then they gain an importance totally out of proportion to their size.

TL5 MOVIESTARS
Why is a TL 5 Gushmerge movie star laughed at in Vland? Well, try watching a 
Ronald Reagan cowboy movie now.... Need I say more? Well, okay if pushed... 
remember what flares _were_. How many cultural differences can you get on a 
single planet, let alone between in-system worlds and between systems. Try 
rolling out every planet from DGP\'s Worldbuilder\'s Handbook using the 
cultural oddities tables... you\'ll soon see why one culture finds another 
weird or laughable. There are plenty of modern day equivalences, but they 
are generally racist or ethnic or religious, so best avoided here.

TO BE FAMOUS
There are certain things which are liked by a large percentage of the 
population (never ever 100%). e.g. certain types of music strike harmonies 
which we react to instinctively without having to consciously try to 
appreciate the music. Ever thought about the background music which builds 
up gradually as the bug-eyed monster creeps up on the good guy? You don\'t 
need to see the monster to know that it\'s coming, you automatically 
interpret the music to indicate an approaching threat. Think of the classic 
Jaws music. Mix such things with some advanced social science and computer 
aids and you\'d be able to develop music appreciable by a wide range of 
cultures. Do the same with art, etc. and you have the basis for 
interstellar-famed artists.
Then remember the more important factors - s*d what you actually like, it\'s 
how much it cost and its rarity that matters. Wine from grapes grown on 
Earth would be priceless at the outer edges of the Solomani systems. It 
doesn\'t matter if the grapes grow elsewhere - punters will always believe 
the Earth grapes taste better, and will pay through the nose for them.

TL3 \'country bumpkins\' can become quite respectable and well paid if they 
can harvest the local opiate-equivalents more cheaply than producing the 
drug in a high-tech factory.

Look around you. We have quite a range of TLs (probably from 0 up to 8) 
around us on this planet. Just extrapolate a bit...

Regarding the _Atlas of the Imperium_; if you want some idea of the 
format of the charts, take a look if you can at the GDW _Vargr_
supplement, at the referee\'s version of the map of Gvurrdon sector,
"buried somewhere in the vaults of the Second Survey".  It\'s in
the same format, except in _Vargr_, they included the UWPs for the
sector.  The sector files that we have at the ftp site came by way
of GEnie from DGP, who generated all 35 of them early on in their
existence from _Atlas of the Imperium_.  (Although some non-DGP
files are also there too, and they aren\'t clearly marked....)

(The Gvurrdoun UWPs are interesting...the capital of a Vargr
government just coreward of Aramis is TL16, and there\'s one or
two other Vargr worlds similarly advanced.  Don\'t knock Vargr
technical ability!)

Think about this: if the Imperium had been generated randomly using
the rules, it would probably have about 25 worlds with a population
in the 90 billion range, like Anaxias/Delphi and Aosta/Solomani Rim.
That means that 14% of the population of the Imperium would be 
concentrated on a handful of worlds....

Notes: This ships uses the usual technology--enhanced output m-drive, H-C
overdrive, NH3 fuel, anti-missile fire control, superconducting armour,
afterburning plant. Has two computers, and also two bridges and two frozen
watches. The ship uses modular construction, and can be built in two years.
The Manta Ray-class, due to its modular construction, has many components in
common with the Alliance-class escort carrier.

Has a 7500-ton missile magazine (2500 battery-rounds), 2 30-ton small craft,
12 parsecs jump fuel, a 1 tonne AM containment pod, and space for 5 90-ton
planetbusters. Has 600 battery-rounds of fire in XO racks.

The Manta Ray-class was designed as a firepower support ship. During a
battle, it stays well back at the edge of ER missile range, and fires on
targets designated by fighters or starships in close combat with the enemy.
To fulfill this mission, it has a very heavy missile armament for its size,
and 2.5 times the magazine capacity of the "close combat" ships.

Because it is so focused on fire support, the ship is somewhat vulnerable to
enemy battlecruisers getting in energy weapon range. The class\'s designers
compensated for that by providing a heavy XO salvo, which is normally kept in
reserve and fired only if an enemy ship tries to close the range--the salvo
is heavy enough that even the toughest battleship should lose its M-drive. In
case an enemy ship gets into energy range anyway, the Manta Ray\'s tough
shield can block 45 batteries of energy weapon fire per turn.

Because the class is a fleet support ship, it has seen little action as of
5650. Several ships did participate in the Battle of Quiver, though, and
performed adequately.

Unlike the designs I\'ve posted previously, which came from Neubayern designs,
the Manta Ray is a Sansterran design. The use of modular technology, heavy
redundancy, and reliance on missile weapons is typical of Sansterre\'s design
philosophy.

I just caught up after being *way* behind on reading these. But I think
my comments are still timely.

Someone suggested that you might be safe hiding behind a gas giant. Nice
try, but it won\'t work. A calculation made based on the supernova in the
LMC a few years back showed that at 10 AU (the distance of Jupiter from
Sol) the *neutrino* flux alone would be lethal! That is, if you were
shielded from everything except neutrinos, the neutrino flux would be so
high that even with the incredibly low rate at which they interact with
matter, you\'d *still* receive a lethal amount of radiation damage from
them.

So hiding behind even a gas giant wouldn\'t help. And the gas giant would
be pretty well fried.

As for the effects at a distance, please recall that the energy output
of a supernova is something in the neighborhood of *billions* or
*trillions* of times that of a normal star (essentially it has an output
equal to a *galaxy* for a while). Even with the inverse square law,
that\'s gonna be pretty nasty at even a few light years.

1 parsec = ~400,000 AU (it\'s *exactly* TAN(.5 seconds of arc))
1 parsec = ~6e13 km

So if it\'s a trillion times normal output, at one parsec it\'d be about 6
times the output of a normal star 1 AU away.  Yow!

This is endurable, though it\'ll screw up a lot of things. But chugging
along behind the radiation is the gas shell. This is the outer layer of
matter ejected from the star. It\'s traveling just under light speed and
is equivalent to a *major* PAW!

For example, if the density(d) is 1 particle per cm^3 (high, but it\'ll
do for a calculation) and is travelling at a v of .8c, you get a
particle flux of d*v.

1*(.8c)
.8c
.8*3e10
2.4e10 particles per second.

The flux is *directly* proportional to both the density and the
velocity. So the same velocity, but a density of 1 particle per cubic
*meter* gives 2.4e4 or 24,000 particles per second (or counts per second
:-) That\'s still pretty nasty.

The "plasma shock wave" will disrupt many things for quite a ways. At a
guess 20-50 parsecs. After all, it only has to be as "strong" as a good
solar flare to muck up some things, and be a major pain in the neck.

Jumping into the system where the supernova occured is a good way to get
dead, fast. For years afterwards, the energy flux from the pulsar
"stirring" it\'s nebula will be lethal. The whole system will be a cloud
of high energy plasma, with powerful trapped magnetic fields.

It won\'t be as lethal as flying thru a nuclear fireball, but it won\'t
be a lot friendlier. Remember, much of the luminosity as the brightness
decays is due to the breakdown of shortlived radio-isotopes. Skimming
them may sound like a good way to make a profit, but in reality it\'d be
more like walking into a *running* fission reactor!

Add in the x-ray "searchlight" effect from infalling matter at the
*magnetic* poles of the pulsar and you could get toasted good. You\'ll
have the magnetic field of the pulsar sweeping by several times a
*second* even if you *aren\'t* in the path of the x-rays, and every
sweep will be worse than any EMP you\'ve ever thought of.

As the nebula expands over nearby systems (taking years), it\'ll make
them somewhat hazardous. Eventually the nebula will be dispersed enough
to make visting the pulsar somewhat safe. But that will be *centuries*
down the road. Remember, the crab nebula is from a supernova in AD 1054,
and that colorful glow is from the radiation *still* floating around.

And there\'s still an active pulsar lurking there. Until things quiet
down a lot more, visiting a "recent" (ie last millenium or two) pulsar
is not advisable.

If it went all the way to a black hole, just remember those "cute"
pictures of accretion disks, and remember that most of the radiation is
in the gamma and x-ray range. So if you are close enough to see that
disk, you\'re dead.

If you want a lesser catastrophe, note that all known types of novae
require a binary system, with one member being a white dwarf or neutron
star. Infalling matter from the other star slowly accumulates until it
reaches a point where the pressure on it is enough to initiate a fusion
reaction. That\'s the nova. Though it is possible to get a supernova by a
similar mechanism, but that involves things like a white dwarf
collapsing to a neutron star, and blowing off its outer layers in the
process.

Anyway, this has gotten rather long, so I\'ll end it here.

 Solomani, even the Imperial ones, have a certain level of disdain 
 for centralized authority.  They\'re also more ready to go off the 
 beaten path to find their answers, or just to be "different".  
 There is an attitude of cultural/racial/ethnic superiority, 
 tracing back to "well, _we_ took on the Ziru Sirka when we first 
 developed Jump, and wiped the floor with them", despite the fact 
 that it wasn\'t exactly a floor-wiping.  Solomani are also more 
 likely to make snap judgements about other people (even Solomani) 
 based on physical appearances and stereotypes.

Notes: This ships uses the usual technology--enhanced output m-drive, H-C
overdrive, NH3 fuel, anti-missile fire control, superconducting armour,
afterburning plant. Has two computers, and also two bridges and two frozen
watches. The ship uses modular construction, and can be built in two years.
The Alliance-class, due to its modular construction, has many components in
common with the Manta Ray-class battlecruiser.

Has 2 30-ton small craft, 12 parsecs jump fuel, a 1 tonne AM containment pod,
and space for 120 90-ton fighters (normally FA-5E Super Kraits). Has a
balcony and track launch system with balcony space for 80 fighters and a
track able to move up to 80 per turn. Has 600 battery-rounds of fire in XO
racks. Unlike nearly every other Alliance warship, this class does not have
an ER missile magazine.

The Alliance-class was conceived before the Serendip War as a "battle
carrier," a ship which would assist the Manta Ray-class in providing fire
support, and would also carry fighters to provide ER missile guidance. During
the Imperial Occupation, the Alliance Navy decided to use the ship for its
new escort carrier, since the requirements of a battle carrier were nearly
identical to those of an escort carrier.

The escort carrier is a fleet defense ship, similar in purpose (though very
different in design) to the 20th century Aegis ships. The carrier\'s fighters
are deployed ahead of a fleet to provide a first line of defense against
incoming missile fire. Although a fighter\'s antimissile capabilities are
nowhere near as good as a starship\'s, the fighter screen can thin an incoming
salvo enough for ship-mounted defenses to deal with it. In addition, the
carrier itself stays close to the more valuable units and uses its missile
bays for defensive fire--essentially acting like a giant destroyer. Like the
Manta Ray, the Alliance-class keeps its XO racks in reserve to deal with
anything that breaks through to threaten it (or the ships it\'s protecting).

The Alliance Navy developed the escort carrier idea as a way of defending
against the kind of massive missile salvoes that their own ships can throw.
However, for the first several years the class was in service nobody else had
the Alliance\'s missile technology. During that time, the class served more
often as an independent light carrier than an escort. In 5650, the class
still sees use in the light carrier role, but the spread of advanced missile
technology has returned many of them to escort duty.

NOTES:

ORBITAL INSTALLATIONS:

Several habitats, Grav cities, and factories orbit above Capital. The 
largest habitat, Ton Vorn, serves as Capitals main highport. Ton Vorn is 
Capitals "artificial moon", a ball of rock 400km across orbiting Capital 
at a distance of 497,000km. Ton Vorn, was created to address the growing 
volume of shipping and the influx of immigrants in the founding years of 
the Imperium. Dragged from the systems Oort Cloud in 148, and deemed 
habitable in 301, Ton Vorn is over 814 years old and is a testament to 
the engineering skills of the Empire.

Home to over five billion citizens, Ton Vorn is one of the wonders of the 
sector to visit. 

THE INNER SYSTEM:

Shulligaam, the innermost planet lies uninhabited, and is mainly ignored 
save the occsional probe to map its surface.
Dagll a settlement started during the Second Imperium, is home to a few 
rugged miners who prospect over the surface and in the rings in search of 
heavy materials.

CAPITAL:

See Travellers Digest No 9 (FACT ALERT: I dont have TD:9!!)

THE OUTER SYSTEM:

Courasiis, the first of Capitals five Gas Giants, sports a few 
settlements on some of its smaller moons. Auralin however claims its 
roots from the first Imperium, when Vilani colonists used Corasiis as a 
refuelling point. Today Auralin is a major Military and Naval base, as 
has a small research lab devoted to weapons research.

Valaind, "The Great One" in High Sylean is Capitals largest GG, dwarfing 
Sols own Jupiter. Valaind is one of the brightest objects in Capitals 
night sky. Valaind and its moons are rarely visited, yet there are still 
a couple of old bases on Morgan. Today Valaind is only visited by the 
pleasure cruisers, and is home to the "Great Race". The "Great Race" is 
the systems biggest sporting events, held every Ten years. Competitors 
race in ships round Valaind\'s seven moons, and in a thrilling climax have 
to slingshot round the GG\'s upper atmosphere towards Capital.

Laaglanais, the third GG has a small meteorlogical research base on 
Marain, and is generally avoided. Gribbons moon is a major production 
centre for the system, manufacturing H2 fuel and Hi-tech superconductor 
components.

Marshalls Rock, a captured planet, is mineral rich, having large deposits of
iron. 

Dulaam, fourth of the GG\'s is similar to Sols Uranus in that both have 
severe axial tilt. This resulted in the breakup of Dulaams four moons, 
which now form the spectacular rings. However this has thought to have 
been done by the Ancients, during the Final War. Theorists believe that 
there may be ancient artifacts in the rings, although none have been 
found, yet.

Mingaye is an important Naval base and research estabishment. It is 
interdicted to all civilian traffic.

Clayn, is Capitals outermost planet, a solitary GG used by the navy for 
refueling.

and can be built in just over two years. The Sol-class, due to its modular
construction, has many components in common with the smaller modular designs.

Has 5 30-ton small craft, 10 parsecs jump fuel, a 1 tonne AM containment pod,
and space for 500 90-ton fighters (normally FA-5E Super Kraits). Has a
balcony and track launch system with balcony space for 250 fighters and a
track able to move up to 250 per turn. Has 600 battery-rounds of fire in XO
racks. Unlike nearly every other Alliance warship, this class does not have
an ER missile magazine.

The Sol-class has a small portable shipyard with a capacity of 1800 tons.
This allows up to 20 fighters to be repaired or even constructed at one time.
The Sol-class carrier is the first warship type to use this system.

The Sol-class was designed as a replacement for the smaller Eagle- and
Nimitz-class carriers used by the Alliance Navy. The Alliance Navy wanted its
new carrier to have a fighter group capable of putting an enemy battleship
out of action with one strike. A 500-fighter group was selected, and the
carrier design combined Sansterran construction techniques with Neubayern
carrier systems.

The Sol-class carriers have seen action in both the Sarage and Quiver
Campaigns. During these actions, they proved that their fighters could indeed
take out battleships with one salvo. Although even 500 fighters generally
can\'t destroy a battleship outright, they were able to destroy their target\'s
maneuver drives. With their m-drives gone, the Imperial battleships had no
choice but to jump away or face destruction by a meson gun-equipped cruiser.

The Alliance Navy regards a carrier as equivalent in strategic terms to a
battleship (and when the fighter group is included, it costs almost as much),
and deploys them accordingly. Since a meson gun is needed to force ships that
have lost their m-drive but can still fight to leave the area, carriers are
generally accompanied by Sol Bianca-class light cruisers.

The Sol-class was built to carry fighters with two-person crews (such as the
Krait), but the new Cobra has a crew of four. The Alliance Navy plans to add
new crew quarters when carriers are refitted with AM power, and only deploy
Cobras on the refitted carriers, but if it should be necessary to fly Cobras
off unrefitted carriers an additional 500 crew staterooms can be installed in
the cargo bay.

Islands Campaign Technology File Version 2, 31 Oct 94

This file contains technology used by designs completed so far. It does not
contain everything the Alliance has developed, nor does it contain technology
that has not had rules written for it yet. Those things will be added in
latter versions, and some technology included here may be changed.

Each technology listing includes the name, official tech level, and year
developed (or 5631 if it was in service at the end of Steve\'s PBEM game).
Year developed is not necessarily the same as year entering service--much of
the AM technology didn\'t see much use until around 5650. An asterisk
indicates a change from the previous edition of this file.

Enhanced Output Maneuver Drive (TL15/5631 AD):
Designed like normal M-Drive but with 80% normal size, 125% normal cost, and
125% normal crew.

Afterburning Power Plant (TL15/5631 AD):
Includes fusion rocket as part of power plant. Design like normal plant, but
cost is MCr5 per ton. Designer chooses amount of additional thrust to be
generated--this thrust is limited by fuel and crew endurance. Endurance on
afterburner is calculated as follows:

      endurance (hours) = ln(((ship displacement) + (9.6 * fuel tonnage
allocated to afterburner)) / (ship displacement)) * (225 / acceleration due
to afterburner in Gs)

Laser Bay (TL13/5631 AD):
50 ton Pulse Laser Bay          50 ton Beam Laser Bay
  40 EP/Factor 8                  40 EP/Factor A
  60 EP/Factor 9                  60 EP/Factor B

100 ton Pulse Laser Bay         100 ton Beam Laser Bay
  80 EP/Factor A                  80 EP/Factor C
 100 EP/Factor B                 100 EP/Factor D

Cost is the same as a Particle Accelerator Bay of the same size.

Laser Spinal Mount (TL13/5631 AD):
Type      Tonnage        Pulse Factor     Beam Factor
Light      1000T              E               J
Medium     2000T              L               N
Heavy      4000T              Q               R
SuperHvy  12000T              V               W

Cost and \'To Hit\' is as for PA mount of same factor. Cost for SuperHeavy
mounts is:
Laser-V, MCr2250; Laser-W, MCr1686

NH3 Fuel System (TL14/5631 AD):
Uses ammonia as fuel--it is run through a special refinery before use,
splitting it into nitrogen and hydrogen. The NH3 takes up 52% of the space
required by hydrogen fuel. The refinery costs double the normal amount. Also,
a jump-capable ship using NH3 needs a special refinery to process the jump
fuel. This special refinery is ten times the normal size (and costs double
the normal amount as well).

Missile-A Bay (TL14/5631 AD):
An ordinary 100-ton missile bay built at TL14.

Acceleration Tank (TL12/5632 AD):
Allows crews on high-thrust ships to function. Compensates 12Gs with
oxygenated flourocarbons (a breathable liquid). A tank using oxygen
compensates 2G--this is what\'s included in TNE. No extra cost or tonnage.

Antimatter Warhead (TL18/5631 AD):
Acts just like a normal nuclear warhead, but is unaffected by nuclear
dampers. Each missile requires 1g of antimatter.

Antimatter Particle Accelerator Weapon System (TL18/5636 AD):
Design as a normal PA of any size. Does 1 surface hit, 2 radiation hits, and
destroys one armour factor per factor by which APAWS exceeds the target\'s
size code. Once the target\'s armour is gone, it does 1 surface hit, 3
radiation hits, and 1 critical hit for the same increment. Uses 10g of
antimatter per shot.

Matter/Antimatter Reaction Assembly (TL18/5634 AD):
Design like normal power plant. Percent of ship required for a plant of Pn
size is: 0.0185Pn, cost is MCr6.75/ton, consumes 8.75kg per EP generated per
year of antimatter.

Antimatter Jump Drive (TL18/5649 AD):
Design as normal jump drive. Fuel consumption per ton per parsec jumped is
100g antimatter and 100g normal matter.

ER Missile (TL13/5631 AD):
Capable of engaging targets beyond sensor range (out to 3 million km).
Requires an "ER missile gunner" crewmember aboard a unit within normal combat
range of target to provide guidance, one gunner per ER missile battery. One
battery-round of ER missiles requires 1.5T for 50T battery, 3T for 100T
battery. No extra cost.

Multi-Turret/Multi-Bay System (TL13/5631 AD):
Allows a craft to carry turrets or bays beyond the normally allowed number.
Each extra turret or bay takes twice the normal tonnage.

Multi-Spinal Mount System (TL13/5634 AD):
Allows a ship to carry multiple spinal mounts. No more than 15% of the ship
tonnage may be allocated to spinal mount weapons. For each spinal mount over
one, the tonnage allocated to ALL spinal mount weapons is doubled.  That is,
two spinal mounts = double tonnage for each.  Three spinal mounts = quadruple
tonnage for each. Four spinal mounts = octuple tonnage for each.  It gets
nasty fast, and is really only suitable for REALLY big ships. 

Oversize Bay (TL13/5631 AD):
Allows bays more powerful than the normal maximum to be built. For each extra
factor, double size, cost, and power consumption.

Meson Weapon (TL11/5644 AD):
These are included because the Islands Cluster didn\'t have meson technology
originally.

Kinetic Energy Missile (TL7/5633 AD):
Acts like nuclear warhead but unaffected by dampers or superconducting
armour. To hit penalty of -2.

Planetbuster Drone (TL18/5631 AD):
Designed like an unmanned fighter with an antimatter warhead requiring
5T/MCr100. To hit penalty -6 for early models, a hit destroys any ship.

* Project Starburst (TL16/5646 AD):
Turn gas giants into small stars, or trigger flares (like Darrian) in
existing stars. Requires three meson guns firing in concert, each 100,000T
requiring 50,000EP and MCr30,000.

Ablative Armour (TL14/5633 AD):
Each point of ablative armour counts in combat as 5 points of armour, one
point burns away with each hit.

Helson-Canomaar Overdrive (TL15/5636 AD):
Design as normal jump drive with double normal price, divide fuel requirement
by ten. H-C Overdrive may not be combined with an NH3 Fuel System (although a
ship can still use NH3 for its power plant) or Antimatter Jump Drive.

Antimatter Production Facility, Mark I (TL18/5631 AD):
Design as normal fusion power plant. Produces 15 grams of antimatter per EP
per year.

Antimatter Production Facility, Mark II (TL18/5650 AD):
Build as "habitat" from JTAS orbiting a gas giant. Size required is torus
with 150m cross section, outer diamter 10% larger than gas giant. Production
is 1 million tons of antimatter per year. Cost approximately MCr30 million.

Antimatter Production Facility, Mark III (TL18/5660(?) AD):
As above, but orbiting Gloire supernova remnant. Cost unknown, production 100
million tons of antimatter per year when completed.

Antimatter Containment Vessel (TL18/5631 AD):
Holds a ship\'s supply of antimatter safely. Each 1 tonne of AM contained
requires 1T/MCr3.

Shield (TL14/5638 AD):
Works by expelling a thick cloud of "sand" which is then suspended in a
magnetic field around the ship. Each shield unit generates one shield factor.
Units are built into 50T bays, cost MCr15, and require 5EP. Each shield
factor blocks three batteries of directed-energy fire before burning away.
Shields regenerate automatically every turn.

External Ordnance Rack (TL12/5633 AD):
Cost is MCr.1 per rack, 50 XO racks are equal to a single round of fire from
a Missile-A bay.

Antimissile Fire Control (TL13/5631 AD):
Allows a missile battery to fire defensively, acting as a repulsor battery 3
factors weaker. No cost.

Superconducting Armour (TL14/5635 AD):
Halves damage from lasers, nuclear and AM warheads. First point of armour
costs double.

* Balcony and Track Launch System (TL12/5631 AD):
Provides carriers with a "balcony" where fighters take off and
land--basically, a flat spot on the hull. The balcony is connected to the
hangar bay by the "track," which is basically an overgrown conveyor belt. Any
number of fighters may take off or land on the balcony per turn, up to its
total capacity. The track may move up to its capacity in fighters to and from
the balcony each turn. The track requires 1/2 ton per ton of craft moved per
turn, with cost and crew as per a launch tube. The balcony covers one
hardpoint per 15T of craft capacity (40 90T fighters would need a balcony
covering 240 hardpoints).

* Mobile Repair and Construction System (TL12/5633 AD):
Allows a shipyard to be mounted inside a ship. 1 ton of yard capacity
requires 10T/MCr2.5. Each 10T capacity requires one crewmember.

* Detonation Laser Missile Warheads (TL14/5632 AD):
Available in nuke-pumped and AM-pumped varieties. Nuke det-lasers inflict
damage like nuclear warheads, with a one-factor bonus (i.e. Missile-A bay
fires Missile-B). AM det-lasers get a two-factor bonus. Det-laser missiles
are not affected by nuclear dampers, but are affected by superconducting
armour and shields. AM det-lasers require 1g AM per missile.

MARK:  That depends on who you ask.  According to "official" publications 
of the Zhodani Consulate, SORAG stands for: Study and Operations 
Recording Activities Group", and is a division of the Zhodani Consulate 
Combined Interstellar Forces that observes the progress of emerging 
interstellar societies using overt and passive means.

  According to more accurate, Top Secret sources, SORAG stands for: 
Scientific Operations Research and Administration Group, and is an 
intelligence and counter-intelligence service operated by the Colonade 
Administrative District (CAD) in the Vanguard Reaches (a Zhodani 
Administrative District).  These sources report that SORAG\'s missions 
include: guerilla warfare, subversion, sabotage, escape and evasion, 
"black" and "grey" psychological operations, etc.

  Try finding the SORAG booklet (it will be extremely difficult).  It was 
an excellent little item, designed and written by Chuck Kallenbach II, 
one of the better-known members of the HIWG (History of the Impireum 
Working Group).
  Actually, try getting any of the Paranoia Press supplements...they are 
all very good add-ons to CT (and even to MT, with a little tweaking).

    'body' => 'The Alliance Navy began building a Mark II antimatter production facility as
soon as the Imperial Navy had been ejected from the Islands Cluster. The
facility would be operational in 5650. At the same time, the Navy prepared
plans for antimatter-powered versions of all its ships. These ships would be
built starting in 5647.

All Alliance Navy antimatter ships have several things in common. They all
use superconducting armour, and anti-missile fire control. They all have
antimatter jump drives, and antimatter power plants (called M/ARA in Alliance
terminology). They retain the enhanced output maneuver drives of the NH3
ships, and have a secondary power plant--always a Factor-1 afterburning power
plant. They carry enough fuel to run their M/ARA for one year, and their
afterburner for one month.

The second plant is used partially to provide auxiliary power, but more
importantly to provide additional thrust in combat to supplement the regular
maneuver drive. The idea of two plants used this way dates back to the 20th
century, when wet-navy warships often had a diesel engine for cruising and a
gas turbine for high-speed maneuvers.

The antimatter used by these ships is stored in a series of 1 tonne
containment pods. For simplicity, a ship\'s AM capacity will be totalled--for
instance, a ship described as having a 302 tonne containment pod really had
302 1 tonne pods. All of these pods can be ejected from the ship in an
emergency, as can the M/ARA.

Some Alliance worlds (most notably Browne) are concerned about the danger of
an antimatter containment failure aboard a visiting warship, and forbid AM
powered ships landing on them. The actual danger of an accidental failure is
almost nil, but it\'s more of a problem in battle. As a result, the Alliance
Navy forbids AM powered ships from getting too close to an inhabited planet
during battle.

Although ships are hardly ever destroyed outright in battle, it\'s much easier
to force them to crash in a battle near a planet--over one hundred fleet
escorts crashed on Neubayern during the Serendip War, for instance. Most AM
powered ships carry enough antimatter to reduce a planet to gravel if their
containment pods were to fail during a crash.

facility would be operational in 5650. At the same time, the Navy prepared

built starting in 5647.

All Alliance Navy antimatter ships have several things in common. They all
use superconducting armour, and anti-missile fire control. They all have
antimatter jump drives, and antimatter power plants (called M/ARA in Alliance
terminology). They retain the enhanced output maneuver drives of the NH3
ships, and have a secondary power plant--always a Factor-1 afterburning power
plant.

The second plant is used partially to provide auxiliary power, but more
importantly to provide additional thrust in combat to supplement the regular
maneuver drive. The idea of two plants used this way dates back to the 20th
century, when wet-navy warships often had a diesel engine for cruising and a
gas turbine for high-speed maneuvers.

The antimatter used by these ships is stored in a series of 1 tonne
containment pods. For simplicity, a ship\'s AM capacity will be totalled--for
instance, a ship described as having a 302 tonne containment pod really had
302 1 tonne pods. All of these pods can be ejected from the ship in an
emergency, as can the M/ARA.

Some Alliance worlds (most notably Browne) are concerned about the danger of
an antimatter containment failure aboard a visiting warship, and forbid AM
powered ships landing on them. The actual danger of an accidental failure is
almost nil, but it\'s more of a problem in battle. As a result, the Alliance
Navy forbids AM powered ships from getting too close to an inhabited planet
during battle.

Although ships are hardly ever destroyed outright in battle, it\'s much easier
to force them to crash in a battle near a planet--over one hundred fleet
escorts crashed on Neubayern during the Serendip War, for instance. Most AM
powered ships carry enough antimatter to reduce a planet to gravel if their
containment pods were to fail during a crash.

Notes: This ship has standard AM ship technology.

The ship has 1700 tons of NH3 afterburner fuel, a 7500 battery-round missile
magazine, 1 95-ton and 3 30-ton small craft, 5 90-ton planetbusters, 650 ER
missile gunners, 40 parsecs jump fuel, and a 1207 tonne AM containment pod.

A St. Genevieve can be refit as a Scapa Flow for MCr122,364.7, but as of 5650
this has not yet been done.

The first Scapa Flow-class ships will enter service in 5651, when they will
be assigned to the Alliance Navy\'s Third Fleet. The class is named for the
planet Scapa Flow, which is located in the outer Browne system. Scapa Flow is
the homeport of the Alliance\'s First Fleet. The planet itself is named for a
major fleet base of England\'s Royal Navy during the 20th century.

The Scapa Flow is considerably cheaper than the St. Genevieve. This is
typical of AM powered ships--in fact, other AM ships are cheaper than their
NH3 counterparts by an even greater margin. The major limiting factor when
buying AM ships is not cost, but availability of antimatter to fuel them.

I would like to compare the \'typical Marchman\' with the \'boys from Ley\'... 
  - both are frontier cultures, but Ley is a lot closer to Capital/Core

  - the Marches are colonial, but continually face competition from the
Zho\'s and Vargr.  They would seem both more \'martial\' and more loyal to
the Imperium than the Leyfolk, who face nothing but "strange, new worlds"...
  - Ley sector _was_ colonized by the Ziru Sirka, but the marches have
been settled only during the last thousand years, mainly by Solomani (and
a few \'unoffical\' Vargr settlements)
  - the Spinward Marches has five (count \'em, FIVE) intersteller
governments, while Ley Sector has only the Imperium, a nine-system
\'independent\' polity,  and a pitiful collection of Client states.

I would think that these differences would result in...
  Marches = \'uncivilized warriors\'

Well, every design has its flaws. :-)

Seriously, it\'s not as easy to blow up an AM ship as it might first appear.
First, you have to hit it--all Alliance ships have pretty high agilities.
Then, you\'ve got to get through its active defenses--dozens of missile
batteries firing defensively agaiinst incoming missiles. Finally, you\'ve got
to get through its passive defenses--thick shields blocking energy weapons,
and superconducting armour reducing the effect of lasers and nukes, not to
mention the old fashioned nuclear damper.

Then you\'ve got to get the right fuel. AM ships don\'t carry just AM
fuel--they generally carry about four times as much NH3 as AM, for
afterburner reaction mass and jump drive fuel. A fuel hit is more likely to
hit the NH3. If the AM is hit, KABOOM. Well, nobody said AM fuel was
flawless. The idea is that the merits outway the vulnerability to explosion.

As for taking other ships with it, I don\'t think that\'s a problem. Warships
don\'t exactly stay close to each other in battle. The nearest friendly ship
probably won\'t be close enough to go up in the secondary explosion--and the
nearest enemy ship is probably in just as much danger. Note that I say
_probably_. I don\'t really know for sure what the danger zone of an exploding
AM ship in space is, I don\'t have a clue how to figure this out. I\'m just
assuming that it\'s not a problem because I don\'t know how much of a problem
it would be (if any), and because it\'s an unnecessary complication. If you
know how to figure out the damage radius, by all means please tell me.

Of course, fighing in an atmosphere is a different story. Exploding AM ships
are a major danger there. Not only is an exploding AM ship likely to destroy
other ships in the atmosphere with it, it\'ll also blow off the atmosphere. In
fact, it\'s got a good chance of blowing up the planet. Needless to say, AM
ships do not fight too close to planets that they want to preserve.

For illustration, let\'s take a hypothetical engagement. Here\'s the scenario:

Alliance force: 1 Crazy Horse BCH, 1 Tisiphone DDF, 5 FA-6 Cobra fighters.
Total tonnage 85,450 tons.
Imperial force: 1 Kokirrak BB
No other ships are involved, all XO racks are empty. The Alliance uses AM
missiles, the Kokirrak has anti-missile fire control and is using KE missiles
(wouldn\'t want this to be a complete turkey shoot).
Action begins at short range, the DDF and fighters are deployed to provide
missile defense for the BCH. Again in the interests of fairness, the BCH is
forbidden to move beyond long range (for whatever reason). Fleet tactics DMs
are +1 Alliance, +2 Imperial. 

Turn 1: Alliance is the attacker, and opens the range to long. Combat:
BB fires at BCH, all weapons.
33 Beam Laser-6, 1 hit
23 Particle Accelerator-7, 2 hits
33 Missile-9, 6 hits
DDF fires 6 missile batteries defensively at 6 hits, stops all of them.
BCHs shield stops laser and PA hits.
BCH fires at BB, all weapons.
DDF fires at BB, all lasers and remaining 4 missile bays.
FA-6s fire at BB, 5 batteries total.
43 Beam Laser-D, 25 hits
1 APAWS-S, 1 hit
79 Missile-A, 57 hits
5 Missike-7, 3 hits
BB fires 13 repulsor batteries defensively at Missile-A hits, stops 13 of
them.
BB fires 33 sandcaster batteries at Missile-A hits, no effect (same story if
they\'d fired at the laser hits).
Damage:
Weapon-104
Fuel-32
Maneuver-6 (and then some)
Effects:
BB is dead in space; has 54,400 tons of fuel left
Loses 14 sandcasters, 15 repulsors, 15 lasers, 15 fusion, 15 pa, 15 meson

The BB captain has a choice. If he stays, he needs an 11 with his meson gun
to hit the BCH, but his ship will certainly be crippled and captured by the
Alliance. If he runs, he can go for repairs and fight on, but without
touching the Alliance fleet. The BB would pretty much always run, unless it
was defending Capital or something.

As an aside, I did simulate Turn 2 to satisfy my curiousity. The BB rolled
the 11, and blew up the BCH. In return, it was crippled. Still not a bad
tradeoff, losing a BCH and capturing a BB that cost almost three times as
much.

Hi...

Since nothing much is posted on xboat, I have decided to post a series of
excellent discussions on World Building from the old bundles at

I may have asked this question previously, but, just in case I didn\'t...

Why did the Sword Worlders breakup into the Sord World Federation and the
Sword World Union a.k.a. The BorderWorlds?

Any data would be appreciated...

    'body' => '>And, while we are in this neck of the woods, how\'s about a capsule
>(ie. one - two paragraphs) description of the Julian Protectorate?

This comes from the extensive description of the JP in Challenge 49
(includes a sector map of Mendan sector). 

Politically, the JP is a "balkanized" interstellar state, a
"confederation of confederations", some of whose members are nations
on individual worlds. All conduct their own foreign policy and have
their own armed forces. The "Protectorate-wide" bodies have their 
headquarters on Asimikigir (Amdukan 0223), and provide intra-JP
dispute mediation, interstellar laws, and a standing armed force for
patrols and crisis situations (the Star Legion). It also has bodies
which promote interstellar trade and communication.

Culturally, the JP features a great deal of human/Vargr
cooperation. This reaches its pinnacle on Asimikigir, which is a true
"dual-species culture" - in fact, humans and Vargr on Asimikigir get
along better with each other than they do with different ethnic groups
of their own species.

When the Long Night began, Vargr raiders attacked this region in
force, most brutally at Gashikan, a garden world which had nuclear
weapons used against it. This prompted a strong anti-Vargr reaction
which resulted in Vargr being stripped of their civil rights on most
worlds and subject to outright slavery. As the region recovered, one
of the most powerful forces was the Menderes trading corporation,
owner of millions of enslaved Vargr. An insightful company head
eventually realized race-hatred was bad for business, and turned its
slaves into employees. Humans and Vargr began to work together from
this point, as many states began emancipating their Vargr because of
the benefits of cooperation.

The Julian War (175-191) was an attempt by Martin I to reclaim the old
Ziru Sirka territories in the region. Fearing the region would be
conquered by the Imperium under a pretext of reclaiming the
Makhidkarun areas, the Menderes corporation stirred up anti-Imperial
sentiment, and the humans and Vargr of the area rallied to its
charismatic head, Julian Menderes. The confederations of the area 
created the united Star Legion which, under Julian, repulsed the
Imperial fleets and pressed into the Imperium itself before the latter
sued for peace. "Julian\'s" conferedation dates from this time.

Something which must be mentioned along with the JP is the Third
Empire of Gashikan. Gashikan was mentioned above as a world which had
nuclear wepaons used against it by Vargr. It is, in some sense, the
"Anti-Asimikigir"; Vargr are killed on sight on its surface, and many
other worlds in the Empire still enslave Vargr. The primary cultural
conflict in the JP area is the tolerance of the JP vs. the bigotry of
the Empire. (The Empire is not really a serious threat to the JP, 
technologically, economically, or militarily.)

The symbol of the JP is a Trojan helmet in profile (Menderes comes
from "Maiandros", the name of the river flowing past ancient Troy.) In
1118 when Antares joined, it changed to three solid triangles
surrounding the helmet to form an inverted equilateral triangle
with the helmet at the center.

Yes, there is one other significant alien race in the region, the
cigar-smokin\' Hhkar.

(To add to my previous "regional stereotypes" message: citizens of
Vland sector never refer to the JP as the JP, only as the "coreward 
Makhidkarun territories".)

    'body' => 'Jim Vassilakos made some interesting comments about Classic Traveller 
world generation, and I think his suggestions have some merit on a 
logical basis, but I do think he neglects a couple of factors.

First of all, his basic assumption seems to be that all worlds are 
populated by Humaniti.  If you assume that alien races are included in 
population stats, many of the problems Jim cites are easy to solve.

For example, he cites Sonthert/Lanth as making no sense - Thin, Tainted 
atmosphere and a 19th century Tech Level.  Since this is a red zone 
system, the solution is clear - a developing society of aliens with big 
lungs and a taste for sulfer.  Under the protective eye of the Scout 
service, they\'re being prepared for contact with the Imperium sometime in 
the future.

Alternatly, the rabid survivors of a war-devestated higher-tech society 
cower in the ruins of their bunkers.

The second factor is economics.  Jim feels that, all things being equal, 
people will move to "nice" worlds.  If that were true, why would anyone 
live in Chicago when they could move to Hawaii?  The answer is 
economics.  People are too poor to move, don\'t have skills, have family 
ties.  Moreover, if there are no jobs at the new planet, who is going to 
move there?

Finally, the world profiles don\'t tell the whole story.  Just because a 
place has a "nice" profile - average size, average atmosphere, average 
hydro - doesn\'t mean the rest of it is fun.  The planet could be too hot, 
too cold, inhabited by vorpal bunnies, whatever.

For example, Jim cites La\'Belle/Lanth as an example of a "nice" world with
a low pop.  The world is corporate owned, which might account for the lack
of pop (a world held in reserve for later exploitation).  Aside from the
above too hot, etc. explanations, we could assume the low pop is the
permanent staff of an eco-tourism operation.  "Come vacation on scenic
La\'Belle and see nature in its pure form.  Our J3 luxury liners from
Rhylanor and Porozlo will whisk you there in style and comfort."  Hey,
that sounds good; I\'ll have to use that in the campaign I\'m running now. 

Overall, while the generation system for Classic Traveller might result 
in some seemingly odd results, a bit of logic and imagination can explain 
it all.  Frankly, I like all those wierd world profiles.  For me, they\'ve 
been the start of many interesting adventure ideas.

I would like to make one small comment on James Vassilakos\'s post from
february 
of \'93. 

*** quoted begins ***
Anyway, I\'m continuing to mull over the sunbane data on the
spinward marches despite my limited knowledge concerning the
region\'s recent history, and (at the risk of getting into a
really long discussion) I have to admit that I keep thinking the
same thing over and over: "There\'s something wrong here." What
I\'m talking about is UWP\'s (formerly UPP\'s) which don\'t make a
whole lot of sense to me. Sonthert/Lanth is a decent example of
what I mean.

#PlanetName   Loc. UPP Code   B   Notes         Z  PBG Al.
#----   ---- ----  - ---- -  ---- --
Sonthert      1918 X6266AB-3    Ni              R  314 Im
 
Here we have a couple million folks making a living with their
19th century technology, and look what they have to breathe: a
very thin (and tainted) atmosphere. For all intents and purposes,
a vacuum. I know... I know... they can get by with combination
respirators/filtermasks, right? All couple million of them? With
technology which is over a century old? I can just see it now.
"Don\'t go outside, son. Yer might have to breathe or somethin\'."
Hey, at least TAS had the sense to classify it as a red zone
(don\'t go there if you\'re addicted to oxygen).

Okay, all kidding aside, the thing that gets me about planets
like this is that anybody decided to colonize them in the first
place. Agreed, with a bit of technology, people can survive just
about anywhere they want to survive, but why bother? I see a nice
dirtball only five parsecs trailing.

#PlanetName   Loc. UPP Code   B   Notes         Z  PBG Al.
#----   ---- ----  - ---- -  ---- --
La\'Belle      2416 C564112-4    Lo Ni              701 Im 

Now this is sweet. We\'re talking primo-atmosphere (none of that
chewable Los Angeles gunk). And lo and behold, who shows up to
catch the view? A whopping seventy people. We have more folks on
the TML than this. Yes... I know... the planet is corporate
owned, but who really cares? Why waste a virtual paradise (at
least compared to that other place) on seventy stinking corporate
losers (or maybe corporate winners in this case). Ah, yes... I
can see some cool scenarios... the corporate paradise. The wooing
ground for potential investors. Perhaps it\'s just one big golf
course. You tee-off from orbit.
*** quoted ends ***

I think Mr. Vassilakos is giving too much credit to human good sense.  The
taint
on Sonthert\'s atmosphere is probably the result of running a Victorian 
industrial technology for too long in a row.  If I had a world like that crop
up
in my campaign, I would probably mark these 2 million souls as a pityful
remnant
of a far larger population at the edge of whiping itself off through
polution;  
doubtless due to some deficiency of natural resource or culture (note the X 
starport) preventing them from taking advantage of importable technology or 
progressing themselves.

As for people moving to someplace nice -- well, as far as I can tell they are

all moving the Los Angeles (and the like) instead.  North America is full of 
really nice places to live, provided you consider a functioning economy and
job 
oportunities an optional extra.  Even when people come here from the third 
world, they head for the poluted and crowded places rather than wide open 
spaces.  I don\'t this the people of the 6th millenium will be much different.

Neat idea to post some old stuff to the list alvin, I enjoyed
it, as I hadn\'t seen it before.

And before my comments, I called GDW themselves yesterday and
believe it or not, they still have a fair hunk of out-of-print
Traveller materials in stock. Aslan, Darrians, Beltstrike, Tarsus,
The Adventure and some misc. adventures. Good prices too -
Darrians $8. I\'m in no way affiliated with the company we hate to
love, but it is a good price on hard-to-find stuff. I don\'t 
have the phone # right here, but there\'s a price list on
ftp.mpgn.com and it has it, or mail me. I was impressed that they
still had as much stuff as they did, considering how long it\'s been
out of print.

And he goes on to describe a modified system of world generation,
with a lot of good ideas. (As well as moving Hamlet into the Third
Imperium - \'something\'s rotten in the subsector of Lanth\')

I think the idea behind the original rules is that the only
thing the players care about (on first glance) is the starport.
The rules are set up to give a certain distribution of starports
of different grades. This then needs a way to justify why there\'s
a type A starport there. It\'s is ass-backwards, I agree, but in
the Traveller universe, there\'s a lot of room for slightly 
illogical worlds.

Why are there 20 million people on a planet with a crappy atmosphere?
Maybe there was a population explosion during the long night
and the people have adjusted to that level of population without
amazing technology. Maybe locals have adapted to be a lot less
bothered by the conditions. Maybe the locals go on to become great 
endurance runners on other worlds with denser atmospheres.

Why are there only 20 people on the corporate-owned earth-like world?
Maybe no one wants people to go there. Maybe there\'s a disease
fatal to human life on the world. Maybe there\'s an ancients site.

I think even the stupidest UPP(UWP, whatever) can be justified by a 
good ref with a little imagination. For me, that\'s part of the 
appeal of Traveller.

What I\'d like someone to spout off about is sports in the 3rd
Imperium - a stable, civilized society would have a fairly
large focus on entertainment and lesiure, especially on worlds
nearer the core, but still, everywhere. Would there be an Imperial
Olympics? Would there be different classes for athetes coming from
high-g vs. low-g worlds? Would size-A thin-atmosphere planets
draw lots of athletes to train there? And of course, drugs, drugs,
drugs. Athletics is big business today, it\'d be even more so in
the 3rd Imperium. (Please note however, the 3rd Imperium isn\'t
Rome in space. Is it?)

I didn\'t look at all these old files, but James Vassailikos\'
old article from bundle 441 (5177) caught my eye.  To sum
up, he went over the Spinward Marches data and saw some
stuff that didnt make sense.  Sonthert/Lanth had tons of
people with only local tech of 3, while 5 parsecs away,
La\'Belle/Lanth looks ideal but has hardly anyone.  His
conclusion was that this shouldn\'t happen, and wen\'t about
changing world generation to fix it.

I\'m of the other school of thought.  I think the bizarre
situations are great opportunities to come up with some
local color.  For instance, take La\'Belle:

>La\'Belle      2416 C564112-4    Lo Ni              701 Im 

Corporate rule, 70 permanent residents...tech 4.  Hmmm.
Maybe this world has a nasty climate -- or nasty climate
shifts.  (Is it a two star system?  Would have to look.)
Or local life is too much of a problem to deal with.
But there might be something useful there because of this;
hence the corporate presence.  But since it\'s a source 
of some resource, local production need not be very 
sophisticated -- imports at the company store, or some
local entrepreneurs with scrounged equipment, but that\'s
it.  Or any number of other things.  Where is it in the
subsector?  Is it in the Abyss?  On the Main?  Maybe 
some explanation for the weirdness can be contrived.

Despite what people have said, post-virus, I think the
"blue-sky" Terra-norm worlds might in some cases be
more difficult to settle than a worse world -- there\'ll
be life down there, and who knows what all might be 
going on.  Vaccuum worlds are much more predictable,
and with proper planning might also be easier on the
equipment.  So more people might settle there, especially
if the colony is well established -- a vaccuum world
colony interior can be much more sophisticated and
spacious than, say, Moonbase Alpha.

I agree.  I always found that if presented with a strange UWP, I\'d have
to come upo with reason *why* no one/anyone lived there.  

On a related note, maybe some of the massive pop worlds *were* paradise,
and very, very popular places to move to...

Notes: This ship has standard AM ship technology. The ship uses modular
construction, and can be built in just over two years. The Sol-class, due to
its modular construction, has many components in common with the smaller
modular designs.

Has 960 tons of NH3 afterburner fuel, 600 battery-round missile magazine, 5
30-ton small craft, 40 parsecs jump fuel, a 908 tonne AM containment pod, and
space for 500 90-ton fighters (normally FA-6 Cobras). Has a balcony and track
launch system with balcony space for 250 fighters and a track able to move up
to 250 per turn. Has 600 battery-rounds of fire in XO racks.

The Tyeyo-class has a small portable shipyard with a capacity of 3600 tons.
This allows up to 40 fighters to be repaired or even constructed at one time.

A Sol can be refit as a Tyeyo for MCr98,237.8, but as this is considerably
more than the cost to build a new ship, no such refits are planned.

The first Tyeyo-class ships will enter service in January 5651, when they
will be assigned to the Alliance Navy\'s Third Fleet. The class is named for
the Aslan homeworld\'s sun. In 5650, half of the Alliance Navy\'s fighter
pilots and gunners are Aslan, although Aslan represent less than 1% of the
Alliance population.

It seems that most of the folks here prefer to make "fun new specices" and
unusual explanations for odd worlds (ie. 20 million people with a chewable
atmosphere and victorian technology) rather than \'fix the system\', aas Jim
recommended.

So, it would follow that in your Imperiums (rather than "MY" Imperium), a
major fraction of the imperial population consists of non-human and
Altered-human populations, say from 10% to 50%.  This varies from "MY"
Imperium (and, I think, the "Official" Imperium), where the Imperial
population is something like 90% Solomani/Vilani, and most of the rest
Vargr and Aslan, with a springling of other races.

You know, I find "YOUR" Imperiums more interesting... any space to move in?

On a related topic, how does a heavily non-human interstellar empire
function differently than a heavily-human polity?  

Things that come to mind....
   Language & culture conflicts.    (reminicent of India, with it\'s 17
                                     offical languages.  The British Raj 
                                     with jump drive!)
   Enviromental problems.           
       ... How does the Imperial Navy handle all those atmospheres & grav\'s?
           I think that "specices-specific" ships would be the norm, with
           the favoured Loyal/Martial races having single-species squadrons
           (ie. the Irish Regiment, the dominant Skih element in the
           Indian Army, etc.) Or mabye not - ie. the desegretation of the
           U.S. Army - but I thing that it would be prohibively expensive
           to build one ship that would meet all those standards (and sustain
           battle-damage, too!)
    Trade problems.
       ... Trade would be interesting, to put it mildly.  "Startown" would   
           take on a whole new meaning - not only is it the \'contact
           point\' for the trading and multi-system community, but it would 
           be a madcap mess of atmospheres, languages, ultra-frigid bars
           next to 6 grav gyms...   (why can I hear the the Mos Elseley band
           playing faintly in the background?)
    Diplomatic problems.
       ... I\'d like to imagine the workload that the Imperial Diplomatic
           Core would have.  Especially when some glint-eye religion,  
           Vargr incursion or unthinking megacorp upsets the applecart...
           And what about Ancient Emmities between heavyweights in the
           same subsector?  Who can\'t even understand each other mental
           concepts?  Fun fun fun!
    Government problems.
       ... the idea of a nobility has to be among the most basic,
           easily-understood government-type in history.  (See him?
           With the Guns and the Money? He makes the rules!)  Even so, 
           I wonder how all those aliens precieve the Imperium...  
           How does a incorporal hive mind understand the concept of   
           "taxes"?   Does that large, 16-legged, TL D "spideroid"
           really grasp how the xboat network operates?  [Or maybe \'he\'
           really does understand it, just... differently... than we do.]

All in all, simply too much.  I have enough problems with a handful of
Altered (& Standard) humans in my campaign.  I can\'t imagine handling the
~100 species in the Third Imperium, even with Solomani/vargr dominance.  And
now you expect me to try to handle thousands of species ...in the trilions
of population...a dozen or more species per subsector?     

.. and I thought that being Emperor of the "Official" Imperium was
overwelming...

I\'ve just started running two PBeM games set in the Spinward Marches in 
the year 1111 (just after the Fifth Frontier War).  I prefer this period 
for nostalgia reasons, really - I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1979, 
when a friend ran us through Adventure 1 - The Kinunir.

----

The Spinward Marches is a big place.  Where are your campaigns taking place?

What kind of adventures do you find most suitable for PBeM games?

What procedures do you use for running a PBeM game?

Sounds cool.  I\'m looking forward to your reply.  As others might beinterested
in the answers as well, I\'ve posted your message and this one to the Xboat.

I use the Regina, Aramis, Lanth, and Rhylanor subsectors.  In a fit of
over-organization some time ago, I went through all the Classic Traveller
publications I own and wrote down every refernce to a Spinward Marches
location on a series of index cards.  Since I own everything GDW ever
published for Traveller (including every issue of JTAS), plus everything
Digest Group published, this gives me lots of reference material.  This
provides me with ready-reference background for many worlds without having
to develop it myself.  Since the vast majority of the adventures in
Classic Traveller are set in the four subsectors I mentioned, running
adventures there is easy. 

I also like these subsectors because of the wide range of planets present 
- everything from Tech 15 high pop worlds to isolated balls of rock with 
lots of stuff in between.  There are also three Imperial reseach 
stations, lots of scout and naval bases, and those naughty Zho are just 
across the border.  And who could forget the Ine Givar (I haven\'t)? 

> What kind of adventures do you find most suitable for PBeM games?

Non-combat, since one can\'t resolve combat in a way that\'s fair to player 
characters at the pace I run things.  I do a formal turn only once a 
week, though I encourage the players to interact with one another between 
times.  Those able to run turns more often or those with access to 
real-time forums might be able to handle combat.

My game does three things.  One, it allows the players to show off their 
character\'s personalities by interacting with one another.  Second, it 
allows contact with a succesion of different cultures on different planets 
(the starship is a plot device to move from one isolated location to 
another).  Finally, there is a mystery to be solved that will slowly suck 
the players in and then require solution so that they can live to tell 
the tale.  The first two elements serve as color to keep the game 
interesting, the mystery drives the plot.

> What procedures do you use for running a PBeM game?

See above.  The one other thing I think is important is to encourage the 
players to give their characters a fully developed past.  In other words, 
more than just a set of stats and skills.  All the folks who are playing 
have sent me at least two pages worth of description, and some 
considerably more, all about family, friends, lovers, enemies, places 
they\'ve visited, etc.  This allows me to develop the campaign in a way that 
links the players with their pasts - they act out of motivations, not for 
game reasons.

Frankly, I think I\'ve been very lucky so far - I have a great group who 
are really into Traveller and know the game well enough to play it under 
my not-so-experienced leadership (this is the first PBEM game I\'ve run).

Go right ahead, I don\'t mind, as long as you think it might interest 
others.

This was addressed in World Builder\'s Handbook, I think, and probably in 
the ancestor publication Grand Census as well.  I don\'t have a copy handy, 
but I believe there are provisions for additional landing points and 
extra starports depending on population and other factors.  In other 
words, the rating in the UWP tells you what is the "best" facility in the 
system.  If there is an A starport, there may also be several B and C 
facilities on the main planet or on other planets in the system, or even 
more than one A class facility.  

By the way, there is at least one reference in a Classic Traveller to a
planet with more than one starport.  In Adventure 3, Twilight\'s Peak, p. 
14, the planet Tureded/Lanth is said to have four C class facilities,
equally spaced around the equator. 

>Also, what exactly is the difference between a "Poor" quality spaceport and

>From Traveller Book 3 - Worlds and Adventures

D   Poor Quality Installation.  Only Unrefined fuel avalible.  No repair 
    or shipyards present.  Scout base (with refined fuel for Scouts only) 
    is present on a throw of 7+

E   Frontier instalation.  Essentially a bare spot of bedrock with no 
    facilities, fuel, or bases present.

X   No starport.  No provision is made for any starship landing.

thing in itself, but his feeling that this leads to distortions of the 
population distribution of the Imperium is simply not true.

As other have pointed out before on this mailing list, the vast majority 
of the population of any Sector is concentrated on a few high population 
worlds.  One only has to assume that those worlds are populated primarily 
by humans and the balance Alvin wants is preserved.

As to aliens within the Empire operating on starships, they probably 
build and run their own as local reserve fleets or system defense boats, 
if they have the tech level, and leave the serious fighting to Humaniti.

Finally, the empire does not interest itself in the internal affairs of 
member worlds as long as they pay their taxes.  Aliens would fit right in 
with all those wacky human governments if they ran their planets in a 
hostile and odd fashion.

 As I recall, this was an aftereffect of the Fifth Frontier War.
 The Sword Worlds Confederation was part of the Outworld Coalition,
 which was defeated by the Third Imperium.  I seem to recall something
 about a pro-Imperial (or at least less anti-Imperial) faction 
 based on Sacnoth, which, after the Imperial defeat (and 
 occupation?) of the Coalition, was able to seize power (with 
 [covert?] Imperial help?) in the trailing worlds of the 
 Confederation.  Why they chose "Sword Worlds Union" rather than 
 something else entirely is unclear to me - unless they were 
 claiming to be the legitimate government of the _entire_ Sword 
 Worlds, the government on Gram notwithstanding.

  The system detailing presented in World Builders allowed the mainworld
to have multiple starports (page 74). There is _some_ logic to it if
you subscribe to the theory that starports are Imperially licensed, and
that the Imperium doesn\'t hand out licenses casually.
  If you find no logic in the system, you may assume that the Starport
listed in the sector listings is the best the system has to offer.  There
may be one facility or several at this level, your choice.
  I should point out that, even with all the tables and instructions in
the WBH, die rolling will only get you so far into a world\'s details.
The detailing of multiple starports is right on the threshold of things
better left unrolled.

  Generally, Customs. More correctly, Interstellar Customs. A "spaceport"
is not set up to handle the myriad problems of interstellar customs, only
the smaller problems of in-system travel.
  E starports are the private airstrips of the interstellar scene. They
are usually small and often unmanned. They are, however, still starports.
The landing area is sufficiently built/packed/reinforced to handle the
largest starships that are meant to land. When manned, they will have
someone on hand who can tell outworlders the things they need to know
about the world.
  "Poor" spaceports will generally not be able to handle anything larger
than a 95-ton Shuttle, and sometimes not even that. As handlers of
in-system travel, the staff of such a spaceport will likely not be set
up to deal with unfamiliar visitors (ie. star travellers). The usual
users will be scheduled runs, familiar "bush pilots", and local launch
owners who don\'t have the private space to keep their vehicles. They
will likely have control "towers", but will generally prefer to find
out about their traffic via hand-offs from other ports. They will not
be set up to detect visitors popping out of jumpspace.
  To address your question of "exact" differences: that will vary from
system to system and from port to port, but will usually have something
to do with the visitors the port is ready to handle.

Several references (as well as my independent judgement 8-) say that
starport ratings refer to total capacity, not a single yard.  There are
lots of "Highport/Lowport" setups, with both orbital and ground installations.
There are also lots of published maps with more than one starport on
the surface (one per continent, often).

Plankwell is (the late) Admiral of the Marches Olav haut-Plankwell (if I
remember exactly).  He was the naval commander in the Spinward Marches
when the first frontier war broke out (589?), and there was some problem
with lack of support from the rest of the Imperium during that war, which
led to the later events.

Following his successful defeat of the Zhodani, Plankwell took several
of his stronger fleets and took a trip to Capital.  Not realizing the
depth of his displeasure over the lack of support, Josephine agreed to
see them in person when they arrived.  During that meeting, the Admiral
shot the Emperess and then announced that he was assuming the throne
by right of assasination.  He ruled for about 2 years, then his former
chief of staff rebelled and became emperor due to luck in battle
(Plankwell\'s side won the battle, but Plankwell\'s command ship was
destroyed with all hands by a lucky shot).  There were a succession
of fleet-based emperors for around 20 years.

There\'s a good summary of this in the old Library Data books (classic Trav),
and in various places in subsequent materials.

  Maybe we need to extend the process some more.  Generate a raw world,
using the revised system.  Then, determine how long the world has been

This is what I get for answering offhand.  Turns out my answer was almost 
right, but not quite.  According to Megatraveller Referee\'s Manual, p. 
23, an E starport has no facilities, other than a cleared place to land.  
You can get no repairs done and there is no fuel for sale.  It\'s just the 
place people meet ships when they land - we play that there is a 
automatic nav beacon but no buildings.

A Poor spaceport, on the other hand, is oriented toward in-system travel, 
and will not be the primary ship handleing facility in the system.  It 
has buildings, unrefined fuel is for sale, and the shops can repair 
Superficial level damage.  The code for this type of spaceport is G, by 
the way.

A G-class starport is in-between a D and an E, since a D is the same as a 
G except that a D can repair up to Minor Damage.  An F spaceport, by the 
way, is a D facility with nicer buildings (no lie!) - that makes sense 
(not!).

Boy, yet again I spend too much time telling folks what they already know 
(not to mention getting it wrong!).

	This is pretty much what we do, though we DO use aliens.  At

	We\'ve argued about this one quite a lot.  In general, this is
a reasonable enough way to go (we think), _but_ it neglects to
mention that most low teh worlds won\'t actually produce
_anything_!  After all, they can buy pretty much everything
cheaper than they can make it.

	Anything that would cause a massive die-off in Ireland if
imports were cut off?  I suspect not, myself...

	I\'ve never bothered to tweak worlds either.  Except for
Esperanza, which was a game-balance issue, really.  I just spend
a few minutes working out what the numbers _really_ mean...

One can make the assumption that the starport/spaceport described in the rules
for a given planet is the best one for that world.  Given that, then it\'s
quite possible to have, say, a class C starport on the same planet as a class
A port (with the class A port being used for the UWP).

However, the rules for system generation described in MegaTraveller (and in
CT\'s Book 6 - Scouts) assign spaceports to worlds other than the main world.
If we assume that the spaceports given by the rules is the best one on the
world, then the only place in a solar system where there can be starports is
the main world.

So, your point about multiple starports on a given world is correct.  But,
only one planet per system can have a starport.  It is this rule I find
unrealistic.

Sorry, I was actually referring to the class H spaceport, not the G.  And, from
the rules, the H spaceport is a "primitive spaceport with no facilities". So,
what\'s the diff?

Builder\'s Handbook, and you\'d be surprised how many "Terra-Normal" worlds end
up bloody uncomfortable. Too many moons, or not enough water surface, and the
temperature shoots up or down. By and large, if the sun\'s not G2 V, forget
it...

Now I\'m the first to admit that I tweak some worlds; for a start, I have more
faith in 56th century terraforming than DGP & GDW... But I feel that the stats
as they come tend to be an accurate indicator of what planets out there are
going to be like. There are millions of possibilities, and it\'s sheer racial
arrogance to assume that every system will have a "human-stop" built - a hab
world. 

The rider to that is that I make careful use of a composite table which
determines the miniumum TL to survive a planet\'s conditions. The average TL of a
region tends to creep up, but so what ? After all, _all_ these folk must have
been TL 10 or better, or they\'d never have got to the place (Ancient droppings
excluded). 

I store my Atlas data in a database (my own work, blush) and I\'v applied these
criteria to the whole damn lot. Interesting. Later published stuff tends to be
OK, but the Spinward! Oh dear. Still, only about 10 systems needed a TL hike,
and those not by much.

a game system alive. There are other ways, though.

benefit from:
        (2.a) Editing to a smaller, compact size.

presumably has the time to go back through the archives) were to amalgamate 
the longer TML discussions into single messages - e.g. "The TML Guide to 
Alien Worlds" - including all the atmosphere, gravity, native life, etc. 
discussions..... A "TML Weapons List" with all the FF&S designs (abbreviated 
appropriately).... A "TML starships list" for each of the design eras: CT, 
MT, TNE. I\'m sure a lot of this info is already hiding in the TML archives, 
but I never did find an up-to-date list of what was there. How about storing 
such amalgamated files in the TML archives and telling the rest of us what\'s 
in them. Surely we ought to be able to organise a few people to sit down and 
do this - anyone got some spare days?

In summary, well done Alvin for bringing some gems to light, but ensure 
they\'re diamonds rather than pretty quartz and, where you extract long 
articles, I suggest you summarise or amalgamate them and add some new 
material yourself.

As for Spinward Marches and surrounds:

	The Domain of Deneb (Spinward Marches, Deneb, Trojan Reach, and Reft
	Sector are displayed in a map that was included in MegaTraveller
	Journal #1 by DGP.  The UWP data to go with the map was presented
	in MegaTraveller Journal #3.

	Trojan Reach was developed in The Third Imperium, one of the better
	Traveller fanzines.  A subsector was presented in 10 of its 11 issues,
	along with further development included in each issue\'s feature
	adventure.  TI retained the placement of worlds presented in GDW\'s
	Atlas of the Imperium, and DGP retained TI\'s world names and UWP\'s
	in its portrayal of Trajan Reach in Traveller\'s Digest #20 (which
	includes a sector map, data listings in the expanded format, a feature
	adventure set in Trojan Reach, and Library Data for the sector), MTJ1,
	& MTJ3.  In all, counting the 2 subsectors developed in GDW\'s 
	Adventure 4 - Leviathan, a total of 12 out of the 16 subsectors of
	Trojan Reach were developed on the subsector level (that I know of).

	Foreven Sector (one sector spinward of the Spinward Marches) was 
	developed in The Imperium Staple by Herb Petro (of the HIWG), starting
	in issue #6.  Two subsectors (Reidan, Urnian) and one planet (Hold/
	Reidan) were developed.  GDW later published a map of Foreven in
	Imperial Lines, which only showed  planet positions, and the map 
	did not retain the planet positions presented in Imperium Staple.
	Herb Petro allegedly developed much more of the sector.

	Far Frontiers was fasa\'s "land grant", and they published 6 adventures
	set there, including the popular Sky Raiders trilogy by J. Andrew
	Keith.  Fasa presented but a single subsector map (Jungleblut), and
	4 of the 6 adventures contained library data on the sector.  Dale
	Kemper designed the sector, and he submitted half of it to TSR
	which published it in Ares special edition #2.  This same article
	was expanded and reprinted in The Traveller Chronicle, which is
	also publishing the other half of the sector.  FYI, Far Frontiers
	is 2 sectors spinward of the Spinward Marches.

That\'s about all the time I have for now.  I hope the above info helps.

Just a couple of additional support arguments.  You can not include navel
and scout facilities in the population counts because there are some worlds
(the wonders of computer generation no doubt) that has a class A starport,
Navel base and a population of 8 (UWP code 0, pop modifier 8).  Obviously 8
people cannot run a starship repair facility.  Typically in these cases the
starport is orbital only with a class E on the surface and the people who
run the star port are not included in the count.

As far as aliens go, there is a world in Deneb whos TL is 0-3 (cant remember
off the top of my head), the UWP pop code is a 7 or 8 and its an airless
world.  On top of that, its Interdicted (red zone).  So without any details
available on the system I determined that for my campain that there were
millions of sentient silicon life forms that were developing on their own.
So in this case the local population had to include non-human life (also
consider Vargr and Aslan space :-)  )

X::>What bugs me is why there must be exactly ONE starport per system! That\'s

 I interpret this as not that there is only one starport; only that 
 there is one starport that is understood when you refer to "the 
 starport" in a given system.  Consider:  If you fly into New York, 
 most people are going to assume that you are flying into La 
 Guardia (except international flights, when they assume Kennedy). 
 If you\'re not going to the "default" airport, you specify it by 
 name: "I\'m flying into JFK" or "I\'m flying into Newark".  
 Similarly with a starport - you\'re going to the "default" starport 
 unless you specify "I\'m berthing at Meshuganeh Skyside".  
 Conventionally, ports capable of handling stellar ships are 
 considered "spaceports" if they are not the primary for the 
 system.  But they may very well be of starport grade.  One thing 
 you _can_ be sure of: No starport in the system will have a higher 
 grade than the one that appears in the UWP.

 Naturally, different starports will have different focus; usually, 
 you want to look at fuel availability and graving/dry docks.  
 Those will usually determine the TAS rating (in my universe).  So, 
 if you need for a C port to be able to transship starships, go 
 right ahead...

Thanks for all the info on Admiral hault Plankwell.  A hero went bad, indeed.

So Cleon III was the one who was first assassinated... and justifiably
too! (an accursed proto-Lucan, apparently).  So NOW it comes out!
Slowly, the Imperial puzzle fits into place.

And (recalling some info I recieved a long time ago...) Martin III
is the top contender for "Most Able Emperor", as the negotiator of that
Aslan treaty and a fighter (did he put down the Illeish rebellion of the
400\'s?).

Which brings us to the question... who was the most disgraceful Emperor?
(Cleon II doesn\'t count: he abdicated, but made himself useful in other
ways...)  Excluding homocidal lunatics, of course... and Emperors of the

Well, the histories we have don\'t dwell on Imperial blunders, but
consider the following (dates are birth-coronation-death):

Martin I (12-166-195): lost the Julian War
Cleon IV (423-475-555): probably murdered Nicholle and her family, 
   obtained Moot approval by blackmail of and threats against its members
Zhakirov (624-666-688): married a filthy Vilani and put the Imperium
   in the pockets of the Zirunkariish bankers (oops, I guess SolSec
   inserted that...)
Paula II (752-768-836): instantiated the Psionic Suppressions -
   whether or not this was a blunder is a matter of opinion
Styryx (920-945-989(abdication)): presided over the "mismanaged" 
   Third Frontier War

Of this list, Cleon IV (a "nondynastic interloper") sounds the most
disgraceful on the face of it.

A special award goes to Marava (551-620-620) for destroying the Grand
Palace of Martin II on Capital. Civil War or no Civil War, destroying
monuments of the Imperium is just Not Done.

Since UWP 0 tends to occur for smaller planets with vacuum, thin or tainted

xboat83, could provide a system for determining whether the world is truly

There\'s enough info floating around to expand on this a bit.  Remember
that Jacqueline was *elected* Empress by the Moot; before that, she
was likely an archduke or other high-ranking noble, but we don\'t know
from where.  However, she was the one who decided to open the rimward
frontier of the Imperium -- Terra joined the empire in 588, just one
year before the First Frontier War began.  It looks like she really
wasn\'t that interested in the region "behind the claw".  (Maybe she
was the Archduchess of Sol or supported by those interests in the
Moot -- before the late 500s, Sol would not have included much of
Old Expanses or Solomani Rim, at least.)

The library data suggests that Jacqueline was transferring the Imperial
focus from the spinward regions (where it had been concentrated for
over half a millenium) to the rimward regions.  Then, when the 1FW
broke out, Imperial reaction was slow, and all the settlements in 
Foreven and some in the Marches were lost.  This may have been partly
caused by Imperial indifference to the previously peaceful Marches 
at the highest levels.  (Possibly combined with a fear that the
cultural Solomani would form a non-Imperial state to rimward if not
soon absorbed.)

This mirrors events following the conclusion of the *other* Frontier
War the Imperium lost big, the Third.  At it\'s conclusion, a palace
coup engineered by General Dienne of the Imperial Guard forced Styryx 
to resign in favor of his son, Gavin -- too late to stop the Solomani
Rim War, though.  (Dienne made him abdicate at the gunpoint of his
gauss pistol, when he found Styryx cowering in a \'fresher in the 
Imperial Palace.) 

(I\'m being nice about the 2FW, but Arbellatra was working with only
the meager resources of the sparsely-settled Marches, and I doubt
Cleon V and his numerous successors of the same mind were able to
help her with much.)

Two things. Alvin, as you know, fellow WAT, I\'m a sucker for more Classicstuff.
Second, it occurs to me that there might be a significant percentage of similar

The only problem that I have is it doubles the archive size (when I put the old
bundles on line.

If you post the contents of a long message from say bun100 then not only is
that message in bun100 but it will be in digest 1024 (or what ever). 

Personally, I think there is a lot of cool information in the old bundles, but
the best thing would be to FTP them.  When we get more ftp slots at ftp.mpgn.com
then we can consider putting the old bundles up.  I need a way to index the 
contents of the digests.

I haven\'t been around too long.  And I have NO ABILITY to retrieve
stuff from the archives.  So I, too, would like to see this material.

A Yokohama can be refit as a Charleston for MCr22,762.7, but as of 5650 there
are no plans to do this.

The first Charleston-class ships will enter service in late 5651, when they
will be assigned to the Alliance Navy\'s Third Fleet.

Like all AM ships, the Charleston is cheaper than it\'s NH3 counterpart. It is
also MCr5000 cheaper than it\'s Imperial counterpart, the Ghalalk-class
armoured cruiser--which is 10,000 tons heavier.

The Charleston-class carries enough jump fuel to reach the Imperial Core
Sector without refueling. The Alliance Navy is keeping this fact secret until
the class enters service, at which time it will be announced as a further
deterrent to Imperial agression.

 An iffy assumption, IMO.  Depends very highly on the definition of 
 "transients".  Armed Forces bases are usually, as you indicate, 
 considered "transient" populations.  But people raise families 
 there, vote there in many cases, and when the government allocates 
 resources based on population, the base is figured into the 
 calculations - because the base is not self-contained, and has an 
 impact on local services.

 OTOH, it _does_ nicely account for the occasional world with a POP 
 of 1 or 2, but with a Naval base...

 But is this inability because of the (a) local level of technical 
 knowledge, (b) strict lack of physical infrastructure, or (c) 
 economic nonviability?  I\'d call (a) a case of "hard" tech level; 
 (b) and (c) different kinds of "soft" tech levels.  In the case of 
 Ireland, I\'d bet that the Irish inability to produce its own mass 
 transit busses is because of a "soft" limitation, rather than a 
 "hard" limitation.  Or are you suggesting that nobody in Ireland 
 knows how to construct a diesel engine?

 Practically, I suppose that it doesn\'t make a difference - but if 
 I were a TL 3 society on an airless world, you can bet I\'d be 
 directing economic development toward being able to supply the 
 bare minimums needed to keep the planet going - food, air and 
 water management, and dome construction and maintenance.  That 
 way, I have a bare chance of surviving another Long Night...

No we\'re not all vets.  I\'d also like to see

I just wanted to comment on what Alvin said ( and I stuck the rest in 
because I can!  I\'ve only known how to do this for about a fortnight - 
with  any reliability - and it still impresses me. )  I would love to see
more of the archive material! I have only been around for a couple of
weeks and so I would find this interesting!  Please do post it!  I have
NO KNOWLEDGE about how to retrieve stuff from the archives, so
I would love to see it!

respond to emergency calls--in short, it\'s a spacegoing police car. As such,
most Navy encounters in Alliance space will be with patrolling Tsunamis.

In combat, the first priority for any PF is to destroy enemy fighters and
gunboats before they can bother Alliance starships. Imperial light combatants
are so pathetic that Tsunami crews hardly give them a second thought. The
fighters and gunboats of the more advanced Aslan Clans and the Florian League
are a different story, though. Tsunami crews regularly practice engagements
against their ships, and would expect to have a real fight on their hands in
an actual battle.

Once enemy light combatants are dealt with, the PFs would rearm their XO
racks and engage the enemy\'s cruisers and capital ships. In this role, they\'d
act just like overgrown fighters.

The original Alliance PF was the Thunderbolt, of which 40 were built. They
performed adequately during the CLW, but when the Alliance\'s new technology
was incorporated into a new PF design the design team decided to classify it
as a new class. The name refers to the effect they hoped it would have on
attacking forces. (And also as a tribute to the fate of Democratic candidates
in the recent U.S. elections, to whom I say: Welcome to the unemployment
line, you authoritarian scumbags!)

re-posted.

I don\'t think they should be. First of all, I enjoy more topical reading
material, and while the reprints may inspire new debate, I don\'t think
they\'re necessary to foster a new discussion. There\'s also the matter of
archiving. It is a waste of disk space to archive TML bundles that contain
the same material.

On the other hand, I sympathize those for whom diret perusal of these
archives is not feasible, whether due to facility or training.

Why not a compromise? Alvin can collect the addresses of all those who like
a copy of the old stuff mailed to them and can send it to them directly,
rather than posting to the list. That way we not only get rid of the
reprints, but all the discussion about whther or not they are acceptable
(which is worse, IMHO).

Sounds good.  On sunbane, for a while a table of contents was kept which
was a list of the authors and subject lines in each bundle, with one
digested posting per line.  Even that little information got really big
fast, and I don\'t think the file was kept updated after a while.  But
that\'s enough to at least "narrow in" on interesting-sounding topics.

The file had to be split into parts.  I think it\'s still on sunbane,
if you want to look at it -- something like TOC.1 and TOC.2. 

I don\'t know much about such things, having not needed to mess with
them, but is there a way for people without normal ftp access to
get at ftp site files, in some cases?

Sounds terrible.  I get mail.  ONLY MAIL.  It is physically impossible
to get to ANY ftp site from here.  If I sound irritable it\'s because I\'ve
already been EXTREMELY offended by a post I\'ve already seen
on this list today, with the result that I AM irritable.

But the plain fact is that I CAN\'T get ANY of the old stuff unless it\'s
mailed to me.

Notes: This ship has standard AM ship technology.

The ship has 198 tons of NH3 afterburner fuel, a 200 battery-round missile
magazine, 1 30-ton small craft, 30 ER missile gunners, 75 parsecs jump fuel,
and an 88 tonne AM containment pod. The Elbereth also carries ten 90-ton
fighters (normally FA-6 Cobras) to assist in fleet defense. Like the
Tisiphone, the Elbereth can reach Agility 12 if four of the laser bays cease
fire.

A Tisiphone can be refit as an Elbereth for MCr5905.1, but as this is
somewhat more expensive than building from scratch, it is unlikely to be
done.

The first Elbereth-class ships will enter service in early 5651, when they
will be assigned to the Alliance Navy\'s Third Fleet. The class is named for
the queen of the Valar in Tolkien\'s stories. The name means "Star Queen."

The Elbereth costs only about half as much as its NH3 counterpart. It has no
direct Imperial counterpart--what the Imperium calls a destroyer is called
"light entertainment" by the Alliance. The Elbereth class is roughly
comparable to the Imperial Gionetti-class CL in combat power, but costs less
than one-third as much.

what it must be like for a group of Travellers on a new planet, trying to

I\'ve got a copy of MT2. I haven\'t done much with it. It runs ok on my
286 with VGA, but on my Tandy 1000/TL3 it screws up the video. Weird.

I haven\'t figured out *how* to get world info, even though I managed to
launch the ship!

The game is in mint condition, because I came across a store that had
found it sitting on a shelf in the back room along with a bunch of other
old software.

I\'d be interested in hints. I\'d also be interested in a copy of MT1.

Saw your entry on XBOAT about NOT having FTP access.
I only have mail access to the INTERNET as well.
However, I can do FTP through an FTP MAIL server site.
Send a mail message to   FTPMAIL@DECWRL.DEC.COM    (in the USA)
                    or   FTPMAIL@CS.UOW.EDU.AU     (in oz)
                    or   ... many other sites ...

The SUBJECT is ignored.

In the body put just the word     HELP

The server will tell you how you can send it an FTP request to action.  It will FTP
to the host specified, do the directory listings or file grabs for you and then
mail the results back to you.

Not all servers have the same command sets.

Binary files (and some servers do ascii files too) get UUENCODED so you will
need to piece them back together and decode them.

Its slow and tedious BUT if it\'s the only way you\'ve got then try it.

The one I got as new several years ago had the inner book unstapled to the
cover, so my guess would be that this was intended. Funny how its the only
one of all the modules that came like that.

I think my copy, which I bought new soon after release, was the same.  Struck me
as strange at the time.

I wonder if anyone at GDW would remember why that was done that way?

    'body' => 'Here\'s a first look at Alliance internal politics in 5650. This information
is subject to change and addition as I think of new things to cover...

Membership:
12 Full Members
5 Associate Members
27 Others (Only the members have a significant voice in policy.)

This does not include the GRA, which if it joins could add as many as 6 new
members. The GRA (Great Rift Administracy) is a six system country spinward
of the Islands Cluster within the Great Rift. It is inhabited by Vilani, who
are at TL12 but have developed jump-gate technology, and have a very strong
economy as a result.

Alliance Council:
12 Councilers representing Full Members
1 Counciler (from Falcon) representing Associate Members
Supreme Commander, Alliance Naval Forces (nonvoting)

Seven votes are needed for any motion to pass the Council. Of the present
Councilers, 12 are human and one (from Barstow) is fteirle. In addition, one
of the Assembly is of the unknown alien race on Garden.

There are no political parties in the Alliance yet, although it\'s likely that
they will develop when the Alliance gets big enough to support them. A
potential exception is the GRA. If the GRA has several worlds that would be
full members, and it joins, they\'d almost certainly vote as a block (and
might take over the Associate seat as well).

A hypothetical GRA party would advocate slow, careful expansion to be
undertaken only when it can be done without risk, economic development,
curtailment of R&D (they\'re Vilani, after all), and closer ties to the Vland
Domain (or Ziru Sirkaa, as the case may be). Later comments will include
(where appropriate) a mention of how a GRA Party would vote. The actual
impact of a GRA party is impossible to determine without a real idea of how
many votes it would have.

There is the possibility that some Imperial worlds in the Trojan Reach and
ajoining section of Reft might join the Alliance rather than be overrun by
Aslan. However, that is uncertain, and in any case will have to wait until I
have some idea of what Imperial worlds are likely to be overrun.

In addition to the GRA, there are several worlds which traditionally vote
together, but aren\'t powerful enough to be considered "parties." These are:

New Home/Neubayern/Barstow
These members were the original two allies from which the Alliance developed.
New Home has traditionally been the senior partner of the two, in large part
due to New Home\'s role as the author of the Alliance Charter. Since 5627,
Neubayern has typically followed New Home\'s lead in the Council, agreeing to
nearly everything New Home ever proposed. During the early years of the
Alliance, Neubayern didn\'t do much in the Council, but in the last two years
of President Krieg\'s administration Neubayern became more active while New
Home\'s power was lessened by a change in government. Today the two members
still vote together much of the time, but on the subject of expansion in the
Trojan Reach the agressive Delaz Administration tends to disagree with New
Home\'s more conservative position. Barstow started out as a colony of
Neubayern, and still votes with them fairly often out of loyalty.

Amondiage/Sansterre
These members were allies even before the Alliance existed, and they have
remained closely tied ever since. They are very cooperative, and always work
out their position in private before announcing it in the Council. Since
Amondiage joined the Alliance in 5633, the two members have always voted the
same way.

St. Hilaire/Browne
This is the newest but most powerful block. St. Hilaire had been the second
most powerful member since the Alliance was founded. It\'s power largely
disappeared during the Occupation, but when the Alliance began expanding into
the Trojan Reach following the CLW it returned. Browne saw that it\'s
interests matched St. Hilaire\'s almost perfectly, and began voting with the
St. Hilaire Counciler. Since Browne is the single richest, most populous, and
most industrialized member of the Alliance, this inevitably gives the two
considerable clout.

Note that much of St. Hilaire and Browne\'s power comes from the fact that
they\'re floating in credits. If the GRA joined, they might be replaced as
most wealthy faction, and much of their power would shift to the GRA as a
result.

Issues
Although there aren\'t any parties, there are groups of members who vote the
same way on certain issues. Some of the major issues being addressed in 5650
are:

1. Power of the Alliance government
Generally, the entire Council favors a strong central government--hardly
surprising, since they\'re the ones controlling it. However, several members
have considerable sentiment at home for limiting the power of the Council.
These members will generally vote to oppose anything they see as granting the
Council too much power. On the other hand, there are also some who favor
increasing the Council\'s power.

Anti-Federalists: Amondiage, Sansterre, Tisilli, Joyeuse
Federalists: Browne, St. Hilaire, Neubayern, New Home, Barstow
Swing Votes: Colchis, New Colchis, Falcon, Zuflucht
GRA: Would probably join the Federalist camp, but this might push the swing
voters into the Anti-Federalist camp.

2. Role of Psionics
Psionics became a part of the Alliance military by default during the
Occupation, and got lots of good press during the CLW. In addition, several
members have active psionics programs. There are also some members who oppose
Alliance use of psionics on the grounds of privacy.

Psi Backers: Neubayern, New Home, Barstow, New Colchis, Browne, St. Hilaire,
Joyeuse
Opposition: Amondiage, Sansterre, Tisilli, Falcon, Zuflucht
Nonaligned: Colchis
GRA: Would definitely join the Opposition.

3. Expansion in the Trojan Reach
The entire Alliance backs expansion, but there are a few more conservative
worlds which prefer to keep it to a slow and controlled pace. The strong
pro-expansion members are getting the most wealth from it, and believe that
the Alliance should dominate the sector.

Manifest Destiny: Browne, St. Hilaire, Falcon, Barstow
Slow Growth: New Home, Amondiage, Sansterre, Tisilli
Swing Votes: Neubayern, New Colchis, Joyeuse, Zuflucht, Colchis
GRA: Would probably join the Slow Growth Camp, but might instead favor No
Growth.

4. Support for the Zhodani
The Zhodani are fighting the Sixth Frontier War against the Imperium, and
they are slowly being worn down by the Imperium\'s material advantage. The
Alliance has so far aided them by supplying them with most of the Alliance\'s
new technology, and by ambushing a large Imperial force. In 5650, there are a
variety of opinions on what the Alliance should do to aid the Zhodani against
the Imperium. Some members favor strict neutrality, ending the aid that has
been given so far. Others prefer to continue the Alliance\'s policy of giving
covert support in the form of technology, intelligence, and occasional
well-timed strikes to divert Imperial resources. The third faction advocates
armed intervention, sending an Alliance Expeditionary Force to aid the
Zhodani directly, strikes at Imperial bases in the Domain of Deneb, and sales
of antimatter and antimatter technology to the Zhodani.

Armed Intervention: Barstow, Amondiage, Sansterre
Covert Support: Neubayern, New Home, Zuflucht, Joyeuse, Colchis, New Colchis
No Support: Browne, St. Hilaire, Falcon, Tisilli

That\'s all I\'ve come up with so far. More will be added as I think of it.

No. Mine was like that when I bought it - and it was brand-new, just published.

Does anybody actually ever _use_ patron encounters? It seems like
a good idea at first, but IMO, after about 30-45 minutes, you begin
to discover that you really should have done a bit more planning 
on this adventure. Does anyone have any good suggestions on using
patron-type encounters effectively? As a brief interlude in a larger
campaign? More interstingly, does anyone have any intersting
patrons/NPC\'s? 

Would anyone be interested in posting/seeing patrons/NPC\'s along
the lines of something out of Challenge\'s \'Casual Encounter\'s, etc?

        I multiply frieght-rates in my world by a co-effieicnt equal to the
twice the number of parsecs per week the ship can cover divided by the
distance to go.  So, a jump 1 ship carrying cargo at a distance of jump one
has a multiplier of 2 ( 2* 1 parsec per week / 1 parsec =1).  A jump 2 ship
carrying cargo a distance of 1 parsec also has a multiplier of 2.  However,
when we get to a 2 parsec trip, we get a pay off:

  Jump 2 Ship :  2 * 2 parsecs per week / 2 parsecs = mult of 2
  Jump 1 Ship :  2 * 1 parsec per week / 2 parsecs = mult of 1

        I have a base multiplier of x2, since as noted by others,
frieghters don\'t make enough hauling frieght to pay for themselves and not
everyone can trade by speculation.  In fact, the large proportion of modern
container ships don\'t own the goods on them.  I don\'t see why that would
change;  while speculative trade is certainly going to be a major aspect of
interstellar trade, it won\'t be the main-stay.  Not at the ship level,
anyway.
        Notice that while a Jump 1 ship can still make some profit in
servicing jump 2 lines, as soon as a Jp2 frieghter shows up, they are
toast.  The Jp2 ship can make twice as many runs, at twice the profit
level.
        A 4 parsec run creates an even greater shelf:

   Jump 4 Ship : 2 * 4 parsecs per week / 4 parsecs = 2
   Jump 2 Ship : 2 * 2 parsecs per week / 4 parsecs = 1
   Jump 1 Ship : 2 * 1 parsecs per week / 4 parsecs = 0.5

        The high-speed trader servicing way-ward trade routes with his Jp6
ship is going to make a killing under this system.  However, because of the
expense to maintain the ship (annual overhaul and more crew!) he will not
fair as well on a 1 parsec run against Jp1 ships;  thier maintenence and
operating expenses are less.
        In practice, what this does in my campaign is convinces players to
build Jp3 frieghters.  They can still get the mult 1 on cargo all the way
up to a 6 parsec haul, but get a mult 2 on 3 parsecs and shorter.
        Another thing this has done has led to the creation of the
Transporter ship.  Some cunning company buys a surplus and stripped
dreadnaught hull, bumps the engines up to jp6 and 6g\'s and takes the left
over space as HANGAR.  Got a Jp 2 ship that needs to make a Jp 6?  For 25%
of your trip profits, we\'ll take you there!  As a result, the frieghter
gets and effective mult of 1.5, and the Transporter can get 20 or 30 x .5

Actually, the fuel costs are the same - the fuel required for 1 jump 2 or
two jump-1s is the same (with a jump governor, anyway). So, it\'s only faster
than a series of jump-1s. Presumably, the faster vessels will get more
cargo requests than slower ships.

In my campaign, faster ships COULD charge a premium for faster
deliveries. In fact, small cargo ships wth a high jump capacity could
earn livings as couriers for high priority cargos.

No, though if I review my notes I can tell you about several of them...
And I\'m sure someone here can probably list more than I can.

    We have always assumed that interstellar prices/fees are
regulated by the Imperium, to the advantage of the Mega-Corps.
Outside the Imperium, we have always let people set prices to

The problem is that if a ship powered by antimatter takes
a fuel hit that affects, say, 1 ton, the detonation will definitely
release ALL other AM fuel on the ship.

So the mass used in the E=mc^2 equation needs to be

2*M(a)

(Two times the total mass of Antimatter on board.)

Remember that when one ton of AM is annihilated, a ton
of MATTER is annihilated with it.  So for each ton of AM,
TWO tons of mass are converted to energy.

What does that do to your figuring?

VERY much! Two reasons; 1 my players all get the same magazines I do, so any
good plot ideas in them are wasted. 2 As stated above, patrons are\'nt much use
for the whole evening\'s adventure basis, but they _are_ damn good for sub-plots
and side adventures for sub-sets of your gaming group. If one character\'s in
hospital (again...) or training or researching or shopping or just plain absent,
the others often look about for something to do on-planet while they wait and at
this point the Patron-based adventureling comes into its own.

It\'s kinda fun to rescue someone\'s daughter or something while your purser is
trawling Sainsbury\'s for Galaxy chocolate...

On the same note, I would personally love to see full-scale adventures posted,
tho\' I can understand why writers would rather sell them to magazines. However,
if Challenge ain\'t paying any more...

Well, I never had the Hivers book, and only have the Aslan book
handy - so I can tell you what those codes mean:

ASLAN GOVERNMENTS:

G:  Small facility.  Operated by an offworld clan or controlled by a
company.  Population must be 3-.

H:  Different parts of the world are owned by several different
clans on the world.  Aslan equivalent of Balkanized.

J:  Single Clan control by an on-planet clan.  Other, smaller, non-
dominant clans may be present.

K:  Single Clan control by a Clan that controls multiple worlds.

L:  World controlled by one of the 29 Major Clans.

M:  World controlled (not owned) by a Clan that is Vassal to another
Clan.

N:  As above, but the controlling Clan is Vassal to one of the 29
Major Clans.

I think you\'ve been misplacing exponents.  1 ton of antimatter is 1000 kg,
with a mass energy of 1000x9e16 joules.  (E=mc^2)  This is 9e19 J or
9e13 MJ.  At 4e15 joules to a megaton, this is about 20,000 Megatons.  This
explosion has 10x the danger space as one 100x as small, 200 Megatons.
I believe the largest nuclear explosion ever was a russian test at about
100 Megatons.  Thus, a ton of antimatter won\'t destroy the sector, but it
shouldn\'t have a problem vaporizing the ship.

At one hex range = 3e7 meters this delivers about 1MJ per square METER.  this
would toast a human, but superdense is safe.  This stuff is probably more

A slight confusion.  When I a mean by "jump 2 cargo" is cargo that is going
to a world that is jump 2 away, not being carried on a jump 2 ship.  Thus,
while I got a bunch of useful stuff, but I still have a question.  Shouldn\'t it
cost more to send something to a world that is jump 2 away than it costs to
send it to world that is jump 1 away.  Or what if you are sending it to a world
that takes multiple jumps (say jump 10), does that also cost the same as a
world that can be gotten to in one jump?

some specific questions...
>  Jump 2 Ship :  2 * 2 parsecs per week / 2 parsecs = mult of 2
>  Jump 1 Ship :  2 * 1 parsec per week / 2 parsecs = mult of 1

>   Jump 4 Ship : 2 * 4 parsecs per week / 4 parsecs = 2
>   Jump 2 Ship : 2 * 2 parsecs per week / 4 parsecs = 1
>   Jump 1 Ship : 2 * 1 parsecs per week / 4 parsecs = 0.5

So what you are saying is that a cargo being taken 4 parsecs costs the same
as a cargo being taken one parsec, if you can get it there in a week, other
wise you have to give a discount?

This means that jump 1 ships can\'t compete on jump 2 lines.  However,
the jump 1 lines will still be more profitiable (same income, less
fuel and cheaper ships) and all the mega corps will be concentrating
on them and leaving the longer routes for the independents.

>    We have always assumed that interstellar prices/fees are
>regulated by the Imperium, to the advantage of the Mega-Corps.
>Outside the Imperium, we have always let people set prices to

Again this makes jump 1 most profitable.  You would have megacorps
monopolizing those routes and the free traders would have to service
higher jump routes.

VERY rarely.  About the only time I use them is to delay the players
if I\'m not ready for what they\'re about to do.  Like, if they\'re almost
done one adventure but I haven\'t finished the next one yet, I\'ll use a
quick patron encounter to keep them busy.

My players don\'t like the "I\'ll pay you Cr xxx if you ... " type adventures,
mostly because they\'ve got enough money to be choosy.

Well, I\'m going to go over some of the patrons in the Traveller Book and
the old challenge magazines I have to get a feel for the kind of stuff they
put in the descriptions and then try my hand at writing up a patron or two.
Even if I do a dismal job, I can improve for the second one! Besides, it\'s
free. Anyways, I\'ll post it when I\'ve done it (and not a moment sooner) and
if you use it, I\'d appreciate some feedback on how well it went.

    'subj' => 'AM and warships...',
    'from' => 'JSHiggin@aol.com',
    'body' => '    I\'ve been reading with some interest the discussion of the
pros and cons of using anti-matter as fuel for warships.

    The general concensus seems to be that AM is far too
explosive to be a "safe" fuel for any ship that gets shot at.

    Interesting theory, really.  However, it brings to mind the
HMS Hood.  Which ship was destroyed by a single hit to its
forward magazine (resulting in loud explosion, and total
destruction of said ship)...
    Note that there was NOT a great outcry to remove magazines
full of high explosives from warships.  They were OBVIOUSLY far
too dangerous to take into combat.  After all, a hit on a
magazine usually resulted in loss of the ship wrapped around
the magazine. Nonetheless, we kept on carrying large amounts of
high explosive in the magazines of our warships.  "Why?", you
ask.  Well, it seems that removing the high explosives from the
warship pretty much obviated the utility of the warship.  A war-
ship without guns/missiles/bombs/whatever is pretty much use-
less.  So we suffered through the dangers of the magazines full
of high explosives.  We continue to do so.
    I can see people saying now "That\'s not the same thing at
all, though!  A warship works just fine without antimatter on
board."  Certainly this is true.  Of course, once upon a time,
warships didn\'t carry explosives on board (pretty much through-
out history before the introduction of gunpowder, with the
exception of the period when greek fire was carried on Byzantine
ships).  They worked fine too.  But they couldn\'t compete with
the gun-armed ships.  Just as, later, the sailing ships couldn\'t
compete with the steam-powered warships (which, incidently,
added in flammable fuel oil , which greatly increased the
chances of destruction of the ship when a fuel bunker was hit,
and increased the loss of life even when the ship was NOT
destroyed by the hit on the fuel bunkers).

    I could not say absolutely for certain, but it seems to me
that the availability of VASTLY more power to an anti-matter
powered warship will increase the capability of the warship by
similar orders of magnitude.  Which means that the AM powered
warship will probably kick any non-AM-powered ship around the
block several times.  This is reason enough in itself to
justify the additional danger of the AM fuel.  After all,
winning is its own excuse, eh?

    On to more practical concerns, though:

    A 75000T warship may carry a few tons (say 100) of AM.  That
amounts to only 1/750th the target area of the ship, which makes
it a pretty unlikely hit.  I note that the magazine of an M1
tank (or a battleship) is MUCH larger in proportion to the size
of the vessel, though a magazine hit on a tank (or battleship)
produces pretty much the same effect as a hit on the AM supply
of a warship.
    However, some of you undoubtedly think that an AM hit (which
will destroy the ship) is MUCH, MUCH worse than a magazine hit
(which will destroy the ship).  Then, the obvious solution is to
do unto the AM storage facility some of the things done to
ammo magazines in history.
    How this would be done in HG rules would probably be as
simple as putting 15 points of armour around the AM storage
facility in addition to the 15 points of armour (more or less)
around the ship as a whole.  Under those conditions, the AM
facility would be essentially invulnerable to anything that any
weapon in HG could do.  Therefore safe enough that the ship is
likely to be vaporized BEFORE the AM blows.  And who really
cares whether the fuel tank blows up AFTER the plane crashes
into a mountain?  The guys on the plane aren\'t going to get
any deader...
    In TNE rules, you build a containment facility with around
6000 points of armour.  Sounds like a lot, but it is only about
3.2 meters thick, which amounts to a trivial load for a major
warship.  A weapon could be built to penetrate 6000 points of
armour, I\'m sure.  But such a weapon will destroy the ship
with or without antimatter on board, so who really cares?  How
much deader can you get?

    Which is my roundabout way of saying that the people arguing
that AM is much too unsafe to carry on a warship are a lot like
the people who said that the crossbow was so terrible a weapon
that it would make war obsolete (sound familiar?).  It\'s been
said about every new weapon that has been imagined, from the
crossbow to the thermonuclear warhead.  So far, it hasn\'t come
true, and I don\'t think it terribly likely to come true any
time soon...or late, for that matter...;-)
    So bet on AM being used as soon as it becomes plentiful
enough.  People will bitch and complain about how unsafe it is,
but they\'ll still use it, since NOT using it means that they lose
and lose and lose (sort of like the guys who tried to keep on
with the wooden sailing ships after the big boys switched to
steam-powered ironclads - it didn\'t work then, it won\'t work in
5650AD, either)....

Recently, a kind gentlemen finally clued me in in the Emperor\'s List.
One of the things I noted here is the "Vargr Campagins" from 210 to 348
(over a hundred years, from Martin II (b. 53, crowned 195, d. 244) to
Anguistus (246/326/365), both of the Lentuli dynasty)

Well, what about these campagins?  What happened?  Were they just
glorified Corridor sector insurgencies, or did the Third Imperium really
try to annex part of the Vargr Extents?

Also: apparently, Terra was part of the Imperium from 588 to ?.  Why did
they join?  What were they before?  And why did they seperate? [Luckily, I
_do_ know why they were reconquered in the Solomani Rim War of 990
to 1002... to deprive the Solomani racists from their rallying flag...]

Is the Third Imperium more backward, technologically, than it\'s neighbours?

I know that the worlds in the Solomani Confederation average High Stellar
(i.e. TL 14 - 16) and the worlds in the Hiver Federation have TL 11 - TL
12 for non-hivers, TL 13 - 14 for Hivers.  Both are rather higher than the
Third Imp. at about TL 11 (see Bonnevile\'s post on the Third Imperium on
TML).

I suspect that the main reason for the disparity in Imperium TL\'s is to
provide a greater range of enviroments for us Travellers; but does it mean
that the Imperium is like the India of the galaxy?  (Incidentally:
India _is_ a great and varied place for adventure, due to it\'s wild TL
shifts, while Britian, say, is boring and univesally "High Tech")

Re: antimatter fuels...

In addition to Steve\'s commentary about the necessities of having
dangerous stuff around sometimes, and the relative dangers,
I would like to correct the impression that released antimatter blows
up instantaneously with 100% conversion on exposure to matter.
It does not do so.  Extensive simulations run by people who
are considering practical antimatter applications today (the Military,
for one, who like Isp>10,000 8-) indicate that if you have a release
you get a very slow (order seconds) reaction, not an instant fireball.
The first contact turns both the AM and any M nearby into plasma, which
expands out some and has a much slower reaction rate.  You don\'t
get a detonation per se (well, you do, but a lot less than the
full energy content).  You get a prolonged flare.

This means, among other things, that properly designed starships
with AM fuel on board can survive leaks or failures or penetrations
of the AM supply.  You put the fuel on the outside somewhere (thoug
in a shielded container, obviously).  If anything happens, it will
turn the container and nearby parts of the ship into plasma, and you
will be sitting inside a matter/antimatter plasma ball, but that\'s
not necessarily lethal to those inside the ship.  Some of the hull
probably will get burned off, but it\'s not automatic turn-to-photons.

Well, that\'s one way to look at it. In fact, I\'ve been assuming that the
Imperium will look at it that way, since they\'ve already decided not to use
NH3. I\'d expect that at least some of the other powers with the means to
research AM would refuse to do so for some time, as well. As Steve pointed
out, history suggests that people, especially in military organizations, can
be slow to react to dramatic changes in technology. How many wooden hull
warships were built after HMS Warrior?

Armouring the AM pods might not do much good, I\'m afraid. The sample battles
I\'ve run to date suggest that the only way to get to the AM is with a meson
spinal mount--which ignores armour. Of course, I haven\'t tried that many
different scenarios, so this initial impression may prove to be wrong...

But this does lead me into my next point:

Why hasn\'t anybody said anything about the lack of meson screens on all those
Alliance ships? When I was designing them, I thought _that_ would be the
design decision that would attract criticism, but it seems like nobody even
noticed. :-)

        Time is, by and large, the limiting line in cargo carrying.  People
will pay for the haste they need....  If you need it there in 2 weeks,
you\'ll pay the premium required to get it there in 2 weeks.  If 10 weeks is

        That is what I am saying (in my campaign anyway).  It isn\'t a
discount, so much as the client will not be willing to pay the same amount
to have a cargo take *TWICE* as long to get there.  Very simple.  Think of
FedEx and UPS.  They charge substantially more for thier same-day service
than their "when ever" service.  If you really weren\'t concerned, you\'d
send it my regular mail.  Its not that the post office is giving you a

days if they can go elsewhere and pay $10 for next-day delievery.
        Same principle.

        The Far Trader is more likely to be hauling speculative cargo to
"Out-past-heck World" than just straight frieght, since the Mega-Corps
can\'t be bothered.
        It also means that the independants will have a fighting chance on
the long-haul routes, since they will not be dealing with the optimized

[lots of good points deleted for brevity]

        You are, of course, completely right.  The nature of warfare is
such that you have to keep up with the Jones\'.  The point I was trying to
evaluate, however, was the *collateral risk*.  I think it has been
adequately proven that my initial numbers were wrong, because of a couple
of logic flaws.  Essentially you are safe from a one ton of AM/M reaction
at one light second.
        However, lets look at look at a BR hex map.  A task force is
usually in adjacent hexes to each other or the same hex. While I haven\'t
mathed it out (which I want to do today), I suspect that at 20000km, a one
ton of AM/M reaction will obliterate a starship though.  So, in standard TF
ops, hitting an AM starship might well take out the entire TF;
particularly if any of the bystander ships are AM powered as well.
        Which is not a risk with the Hood scenario.  The Hood explosion
left human survivors, if I recall.  Some of whom were on the upper decks at
the time.

        My gut reaction is that the collateral risk is too high to include
AM warships in typical fleet operations.  I\'ll play with numbers and see if
I am right.  If I am, this doesn\'t mean AM warships don\'t have a role.
They do, but not in a convetional fleet operation.  High-speed raiders,
deep intruders and the like, who will be operating in a "lone-wolf"
capacity are suited to AM power.  Carriers and Dreadnaughts, who require
fleets to be clustered around them, might not be such a bright idea.

Just to put in my two cents worth, I think that Steve is correct overall, but
there is an opportunity here for a bit of chrome to reflect the nasty stuff that
AM is.

The Hood went up after the first hit for the same reason that so many BC\'s were
lost at Jutland, and one was almost lost at the Falklands (no, the one during
WWI).  The British never got the hang of flash control in those  designs -- a
flame in the turrent went down to magazine, and there she went.

I would suggest that it will take a while for all the bugs to get worked out of
AM handling.  At the tech level of first introduction, at any critical hit, make
an additional roll for AM containment failure, resulting in a ship destroyed. I
think that would get the point across.

[I posted this once, but there\'s no sign of it in the digest.
 Other people said much the same sort of thing in that digest,
 but I think that this sums it up nicely enough to re-post.

 Incidentally, Steve Higginbotham\'s suggestion of using internal
 armor to protect the Antimatter Plant from damage is very good.
 Even though the plant is hard to hit, its\' small size makes it
 a good candidate for thick internal armor.

 Another note:  AM8: _Darrians_ states that experimental TL17
 antimatter plants on Darrian and Mire both detonated due to
 the effects of the Maghiz.  (Flare on Darrian, electronic
 effects and maintenance failures on Mire.)  Not like they
 didn\'t have enough problems!]

There are some math errors.  For one thing, I think your units are off.

Say we convert one ton of matter to energy.  Energy == mass * c squared.
Energy is in Joules.  Mass is in kilograms.  Lightspeed is in meters per
second.

E == 1000 kg * (3 * 10^8 m/s)^2
  == 9 * 10^19 J
  == 9 * 10^13 MJ

One megaton TNT == about 4.2 * 10^15 J of energy (sci.space FAQ)
                == about 0.05 kg of matter -> energy

So the blast is roughly equivalent to 21 gigatons of TNT.

Ships on the surface of a one-tenth light-second diameter sphere
centered on the explosion would take

                       9 * 10^13 MJ
  E per cm^2 ==  ---- == 3.2 Joules/(cm^2)
                 4 * pi * (1.5 * 10^9 cm)^2


[That\'s MJ divided by the surface area of a one-tenth light-second
 diameter sphere, with 0.1 light-second == 3 * 10^9 cm.  These
 are real-world calculations throughout, although not insanely
 rigorous.

 If you look at E == m * c^2, c^2 is a constant, so that the
 amount of energy released is directly proportional to the amount
 of mass converted.  A ten-metric ton conversion is a blast with
 a 210 gigaton TNT release.  A one gram conversion is a 20 kiloton
 TNT energy release.]

Anybody spot any errors with this?

everyone has posted here, correctly computing flux in Mj/cm^2 as a guide to
penetrations, and consistantly calculating in MKS until that last division of
the flux in MJ/m^2.

3. If we say that the danger zone for a warship is within the 1 MJ/cm^2 sphere
(which would represent a pretty nasty attack on surface features if nothing 
else,   and ignores the very unpleasant heavy particle wave that the rest of  the

about 40km.


4.   The last alliance ship I recall seeing had 377 tonnes of AM on board. That
works out to about a 750 km danger zone.

5.   SO if you have AM in your fleet, dispersion becomes VERY important to avoid
a chain reaction.

My opinion is it should be *both*.  The Alliance ships using AM
are based in CT, but AM *is* listed as a power source available at
high TLs in TNE/FF&S.

  There\'s been a bit of talk on interstellar shipping here; I just
  wanted to toss in my own 2cCr on the nature of this shipping, and
  some of its implications

  One ton displacement of anything isn\'t really all that much.
  Even at 1000Cr (the money-losing proposition for most ships),
  it\'s going to take a major chunk of any planet\'s economy to
  sustain it if it isn\'t self-sufficient (though self-sufficient
  may mean restricted rations, rather than what Traveller\'s
  audience would consider a "middle class" standard of living").
  Given this, it stands to reason that what you _can_ produce at
  home, you produce at home, and anything that\'s imported from
  off-planet becomes "luxury goods".  _This_ will be the mainstay
  of interstellar shipping.  Regardless of whether we\'re talking
  freight or spec cargo.

  Rarely, there will be "essential" goods that need to be imported
  from off planet; this will almost invariably be due to near-total
  unavailability of natural resources needed to produce the item
  domestically - for example, if there are no radioactives at all
  available in a system, all products that _require_ the use of
  fissionable materials will have to be imported.  Figure out for
  yourself how likely such a scenario is.  If you\'re playing in the
  New Era (not on this list, I know), it\'s likely that if the
  products in question were absolutely essential, the planet is
  dead, now; if the planet isn\'t dead or dying, the product wasn\'t
  essential, and probably could have been made locally at a
  competitive price.

  So, we assume that most interstellar trade is going to be
  luxuries - except for the small portion that represents the XBoat
  network (Gov\'t operated), the secret J6 couriers (also Gov\'t
  operated), and government officials.  Note that passenger
  traffic is going to be limited to the wealthy, for the most
  part (8,000Cr one-way), meaning that such travel is a luxury.
  What kind of traffic level does this suggest?  How can you
  justify the expense of A and B starports, unless there is a lot
  of in-system traffic - and how do you justify those levels of
  in-system traffic?  How do you justify the costs of servicing
  such a low level of trade?  How do you justify warfare on an
  interstellar scale, or even empire building not at the expense of
  neighboring empires?

  In short, while I thoroughly enjoy playing Traveller, is there
  any reason to believe that it really is possible, even from a
  theoretical standpoint?  Interstellar colonization is certainly
  not something to rule out; social and population pressures would
  provide a strong impetus toward colonization.  But once that
  colony is launched, what benefit can the mother planet
  reasonably expect from maintaining contact - and what benefit
  does the colony realize from maintaining contact?  I contend that
  there is none, and that therefore, there is nothing driving the
  colonies together into any sort of interstellar polity.

    Interesting...Have you any idea how much of a bang you DO get

things ever bothered to figure out how to increase the detonation
fraction of the reaction?  Not that you really have to have all

    The assumption that "standard TF ops" means that ships will
be close together (even comparatively) is fallacious.  "Standard
TF ops" will be developed by the individual nation-states
involved.  Included in the development process will be such
questions as "What kind of ships are we using?" and "What kind of
ships will the other fellow be using?"  If WE are using AM
powered ships, then WE won\'t park our ships that close together.
If HE is using AM powered ships, then we will assume he will not
park his ships that close together, though we will, of course,
pray to God Almighty that he be that stupid...;-)
    I should also point out that the Alliance Doctrine that Ken
is using (or should be using, if he\'s not ;-) ) assumes ships
with weapons that reach out several million Km.  There is very
little need for Alliance warships to be closer to one another
than about 3,000,000 Km, except for joint point defense
operations.  Certainly there is not a reason for any two Alliance
capital ships to be within that range of each other.  And not a
damn lot of reason for them to be within 30,000,000Km of each
other...

    Your gut reaction is wrong.  Just like the gut reaction of
people after the development of the A-bomb that aircraft-
carriers were now obsolete (they were vulnerable to being
destroyed by land-based planes, by nuclear attacks (surface, sub-
surface, aerial), and their air groups would always consist of
planes inferior to those based on land).  It doesn\'t work that
way because you design your Doctrine around your ships.  And you
design your ships to complement each other.
    Certainly a "conventional" fleet is not going to function
very well with AM power plants welded in place of the old fusion
plants.  But that\'s not what you should be building if you have
plentiful supplies of AM.  You should design ships to USE that
AM, to work with other ships so designed, and to defeat both
conventional fleets and fleets of AM equipped ships.  Anything
less is a waste of an enormous amount of time, money, and lives.

    Actually, I get considerably less than that.  As we were
taught in Nuke Power School, a considerable part (half?  more?)
of the energy released by pair-annihilation is in the form of
neutrinos, which couldn\'t hurt anything (except your neutrino
sensors, of course).  So a better estimate would be 25Km.

    My guess is lower, but not much...Also, most warships need
much less than that amount of AM.  A tentative design I roughed
out over lunch required only 60T for a year\'s extended cruising
(including multiple J-6\'s)...

> important to avoid a chain reaction.

    Certainly it does.  But I don\'t believe that spacegoing war-
ships will spend much time within that range of each other.  On
the contrary, I believe that if you find yourself keeping certain
ships very close to each other all the time, you should redesign
your fleet so that the collective missions of all those ships are
performed by a single ship.


    I should add a caveat about the danger space of an AM
reaction, though.  I think that GDW vastly overestimated the
energy density required for damage to be caused.  If, in fact,
it takes only a small fraction of 1MJ/cm^2 to mess up your whole
day, then the danger space is much larger than was estimated by
either of us above.
    A further caveat:  1MJ/cm^2 is only enough energy to get
a penetration of 1cm of hard steel (under TNE rules).  It is
nowhere NEAR enough to actually cause more than surface damage
(burn off unprotected antennae, and similar things) to a real
warship.  Even the featherweight ships I am currently playing
around with at home.

    They were the Old Earth Union, or perhaps the Terran

    Because the Impy policies were very annoying, and because
they could get away with it.  The Imperium never really had the
power to FORCE the Solomani to join/stay in the Imperium, after
all.  The Terrans joined of their own free will, and left when
they were good and ready...

    Sounds like a large pile of what you find in pastures around
here.  Terra was reconquered as PART of a campaign aimed at the
conquest of the entire so-called Solomani Confederation (more
properly the Solomani Autonomous Region <of the Imperium>).
    Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of
view), the Imperium did not have the resources to conquer the
Solomani separatists completely.  So after they took Terra (and
exhausted their resources in the doing so), they declared Victory
(Yay!), and went home.  Which was probably lucky for them, since
they still had MOST of the Solomani Confederation left to
conquer, and not nearly enough Fleet or Army to do the
conquering with.  It is likely that the only thing that kept the
the Solomani from continuing the war and reconquering Terra was
that they were entirely too aware of how hard it is to conquer
a world like that, and had no desire to burn themselves out (the
Aslan were still out there on the Borders, after all) trying...

    And then began the Imperial Propaganda Campaign against the
Solomani, which was designed to convince everyone (especially the
racial Solomani outside the COnfederation, and their traditional
allies (like the Darrians, for instance)) that the Solomani
Confederation were EVIL EXPLOITERS of ALL GOOD PEOPLE in the
UNIVERSE...or something like that.  I note that the Terrans plus
the Dolphins plus various uplifted apes make for more diversity
than the predominantly Vilani Imperium, even ignoring the "minor
races" in the Solomani Confederation", which are probably as
numerous (and as poorly treated) as minor races in the Imperium.
   In other words, the "evil Solomani racists" are a figment of
the Impy imagination, just as much as the "evil, mind-burning
Zhodani" are...

There\'s no reason why a regular line is going to have 2 jumps per
month, if you know the ship will be bye on X day, and have a booking
agent on the planet, you can pre-allocate the tonnage to a large
degree, not sit there hunting around for cargos for a week, and jump
out in a few (2 perhaps) days.  Modern containerships spend under
24 hours in port unless something serious is wrong.  A Traveller cargo
ship on a regular route could easily do 3 jumps a month (with over 2 days
on average in port), perhaps 3.5 (with 1 day in port).  That makes just
about anything you can design profitable.

So the core transports, on regular lines etc, are profitable at 1000 Cr/ton.

That\'s interesting. All Alliance AM ships (and presumably anybody else\'s AM
ships) are designed to jetison their AM pods and reaction assembly in seconds
in case of emergency. I hadn\'t realized that might help in battle. Perhaps
some sort of roll to see if the AM is ejected in time would be in order...

Well, yes and no. The Alliance Navy ships can be grouped in two
categories--ships that fight at close range (i.e. normal High Guard ranges)
and those which fight from as far away as possible. The close ships provide
guidance for the missiles from the far ships, as well as firing their own
weapons. The close combatants would be the cruisers and battlecruisers I
posted (except for the Orca-class).

The Alliance Navy\'s idea of an ideal deployment would go something like this:

The close ships jump in englobing the enemy force, which has no idea they\'re
coming. The try to reach and maintain a range of about 300,000 km, so they\'ll
be dispersed over the surface of a globe 600,000 km across--that allows for a
pretty substantial dispersion between ships. The destroyers and their
fighters would form another globe at around 250,000km where they can
(hopefully) intercept passing missiles.

The far ships would come out farther away--around 3 million km. These are
mostly high-value units like battleships and fleet carriers, and are the most
likely targets for enemy missile salvoes. They would _not_ be especially
dispersed, because the closer they are together the easier it is for their
escort carriers and destroyers to cut down incoming missiles. They\'d keep as
close a dispersal as they could without being in danger from exploding ships.

He also writes:

Well, I\'m still unclear on what that means in High Guard terms, but it
doesn\'t sound very impressive. All Alliance ships are required to have a
minimum of Factor-4 superconducting armour, which ought to laugh at anything
that can only get through 1cm of steel. That sounds about like an assault
rifle round...

Don\'t forget the shields, though. All Alliance ships larger than a light
cruiser have them, and possibly that energy might be enough to affect them.
Or possibly not--it\'s worth considering, though...

The Rule of Man officially dissolved the Confederation. (I would
suspect that Hiroshi Estigarribia vies with Zhakirov Alkhalikoi for
the title of "#1 traitor to the Solomani people".) The Terran
Merchantile Community corporation formed at that time, cementing the
trading bonds among Terra and her first colonies. The TMC evolved into
a political entity, the Old Earth Union, "well into the Long Night",
and around the same time the Easter Concord and Dingir League formed.

More specifically, the Solomani Movement was at its peak right after
the Civil War, as many of Arbellatra\'s buddies in the upper echelons
of the Navy were racially pure Solomani. However, her son Zhakirov
preferred to work toward alliances with the Vilani-dominated
industrial interests in the central-coreward regions, and eventually
married a Vilani noblewoman, alienating the Solomanists in court. 
The SAR was a sop given to these folks by Zhakirov\'s daughter
Margaret I; after declaring it, the Imperium generally channeled
development efforts coreward rather than rimward, further alienating
the Solomanists. The SAR\'s independence move was certainly helped by 
the diversion of the Third Frontier War.

Well, the histories we have do generally state that the conquest of
Terra was mounted primarily for the reason of putting the "Solomani
superiority" issue to rest once and for all ... if they couldn\'t keep
control of their own homeworld, the reasoning went, how could their
claims of historically ordained rulership of all humaniti (at the very
least) be taken seriously?

Well, the Terrans had just lost most of their "Grand Fleet" at the
debacle of the Battle of Dingir; the histories state that the
Confederation was glad for the chance to rebuild that the Imperium\'s
olive branch gave them. The Imperium realized, though, that the
Solomani would be fanatic in defending the rest of what they had
(remember that part of their undoing was inflexibly defending every
single border world in the Sphere) and that the Grand Fleet would
still be a threat on defense. 

In a way, Dingir was like Dunkirk; the Imperium could have pressed on
and crunched up the rest of the Solomani military, but it decided to
try for a Battle of Britain-style "quick victory", failing in a
similar way (even though they beat Hitler in terms of actual territory
conquered).

However, they don\'t make much use of this diversity; note that the
faction which is generous enough to accord all humans "Solomani" status
is still considered part of the _liberal_ wing of the Party. 
The HDV and Pan-Sophontists are considered liberal loonies by the 
majority of the Party.

I think it\'s a bit misleading to call the Imperium at the time of the
Rim War "predominantly Vilani" when all the sources we have state that
it really was a Solomani-Vilani mixture ... Solomani had been
spreading throughout the Imperial territory for 3000 years, after all.

Now this is probably the case. However, we all know that the K\'kree
are a race of inflexible, bigoted jerks and the Hivers really _are_
behind your excessive Imperial taxes...

Subject: Analytical Approach to Cargo Costs

Yo,
	I did a article a few weeks back that doesn\'t
seem to have made it out on the net. Bugger.
	Anyhow, the centrepiece of it was that I had
created a spreadsheet for ship design. Or, more
specifically, cargo ship design. Take out all the
bells and whistles of weapons and other frills and
it isn\'t that difficult.
	On the end spreadsheet I could just say "I want
a J-3, M-2 ship that carries 400t of cargo and 20
passengers." It did the rest.
	Having done this I then calculated the cost of
making a J-1 ship that carred 100t, 1000t, and 10000t.
>From this you could derive your mortgage payment cost,
maintenance overhead, and crew costs. Basically all the
standard listed operating expenses for ships. With all
this data I could compute *the running cost per ton of
cargo*. I then did this for J2 to J6 ships.
	The result was a table of the *actual* cost of
supporting cargo per ton of cargo space. Unfortunately
this table is in the spreadsheet and I haven\'t got 123
loaded on my computer just now. (Eeek. I\'ve just checked
and I may have deleted the spreadsheet too! Damn!)
	From memory, Jump 1 freight made a small (10Cr)
loss. Larger cargos lost more, obviously. I was able to
construct a table, though, of "Arnelia Reccomended Prices"
assuming a constant profit percentage.
	I also expanded normal High Passage into 5 classes,
each with different room sizes, steward proportion, and
cargo allowance. Their costs were computed accordingly
taking the difference between the cost of standard class
and the price as the specifier for normal markup. Traveling
by Low Berth came just between 4th (Tourist) and 5th (Student/
Military) class.
	What I wanted to do next was come up with tables for
cargo and passengers divided up into classes and distance
traveled. I was going to wrap it all together and call it
"Merchanting Ships of the Shattered Imperium". However,
things have become a bit disorganised. I wanted to test out
the logic of the rules on the Sysgen universe and my software
was in the middle of a re-write.
	However, the new TTG tools are shaping up. They have reached
"level one" (mainworld generation). This is enough to compute
trade figures. If people are interested in the above data
I can try to re-create it. If anyone is interested in a
"Merchanting Ships" like project, lets discuss it.
	[On business *again* for the next two weeks. If any of
ye are in the Atlanta or Boston area, drop me a line and maybe
we can go out for a drink...]

    Sounds like you\'ve been listening to Impy historians again...;-)
This is as specious a bunch of reasoning as any I\'ve read anywhere
in Real World (tm) history...

    So how much of their Navy was their "Grand Fleet"?  If it was even
a significant fraction of their total strength, then the Impy commander
was a complete idiot for fighting it - he would have been better off 
conquering everywhere the "Grand Fleet" was not, which would have
weakened the Solomani much more than losing a few thousand war-
ships ever could...
    The "Grand Fleet" could never be a threat on defense, as anyone
who actually looked closely at jump physics would know.  Once I 
arrive somewhere, I have a MINIMUM of two weeks to do whatever
I want to the locals before the "Grand Fleet" can even arrive to 
interfere.  If the locals aren\'t as big and tough as I am, they lose.  If
they are, I shouldn\'t be here, and will jump out long before the 
"Grand Fleet" arrives, so I still don\'t have to fight it...
    And the Solomani couldn\'t defend every world they owned, if 
they allocated so much of their resources to the "Grand Fleet".
Also, I point out that if the Solomani were so beaten up by the
Impies as you imply, how could it matter if they "were fanatic in
defending the rest of what they had"?

    Well, no.  If they Impies were not completely stupid, then they must
have been able to figure out that having an enemy on your borders
that was just about as high tech as you were (they averaged higher,
certainly), that was larger than the Zhodani Consulate, and that hated
your guts was an insanely bad idea.
    If the Impies had had the resources to keep coming, they would
have kept coming.  They gave up the offensive (forever, it seems),
so they didn\'t have the power to continue.
    Note that the "they\'ll lose heart if they lose Terra" idea obviously
didn\'t work out, but the Impies never restarted the war even after 
realizing that the "logic" of their plan failed to produce demonstrable
results.  Ergo, the announced goal of the plan was a coverup for the
failure of the Impies strategy....

   Sounds like Impy propaganda to me.  Besides, why would a Dolphin
(or any other sentient) want to be an "honorary human"?  Sounds like
the most racist idea I\'ve heard in weeks?  Anyone on the XBOAT know
any blacks who want to be declared "honorary whites"?  Come on,
people!

    The Solomani-Vilani mix is another piece of bull.  Original Vilani 
population of the First Imperium was on the order of trillions.  Solomani
population was on the order of billions.  Mix the two groups thoroughly,
allow to interbreed, and see what comes to the surface.  It WON\'T be
a solomani-vilani mix, except by courtesy.  The Vilani will absorb the 
Solomani so thoroughly that the only way you\'ll be able to tell that there
ever WERE solomani in the Imperium is by inherited surnames - they 
are all going to look as Vilani as the last Shadow Emperor...
   Or are you suggesting that the two populations didn\'t interbreed much,
and that the Solomani fraction rose to be a significant fraction of the
total population, in much the same way as the Jewish population stayed
separate, and grew to be a significant fraction of the world\'s population
today?   Hmmm?

   Good point on the Hivers and the Impy taxes.  I\'d always wondered
why they were so high...;-)

Not quite. The information we have about the Terran Mercantile Community
is somewhat contradictory (they took over from the Rule of Man, yet they
were created to circumvent RoM regulations), but I think I\'ve managed to 
reconcile them. The TMC was trade  association formed in -1862 by Terra 
and her closest ex-colonies that later grew into a corporation by the
governments of those worlds.  They took over from whatever Rule of Man
provincial government that used to run that part of the RoM when that
collapsed (in -1690). In -1110 the TMC in turn transformed into the Old 
Earth Union (my interpretation is that they gave up on all worlds outside 
the Union). The Old Earth Union existed from from -1110 to 588 and 
consisted of Terra  and  the  worlds  closest to her:  Barnard,  Calgary,
Dismal,  Ember,  Fenris,  Forlorn,  Hades,  Heiphaistos,  Inferno,
Junction,  Loki,  Midway,  Peraspera,  Prometheus,  Sirius and Ys. After
looking at a map I decided that they would at least have retained a foothold 
in the form of fleet bases on Aggida,  Markhashi, and Meshan too (these 
three worlds are all within jump-3 of Terra  -  and the top technology of
the day ran to jump-3 ships).

[Quick plug: I worked all this and more into a set of library data that 
recently got published in The traveller Chronicle #6.]

    'body' => 'IMHO, the history of the Imperium is closely tied to the history of
the Solomani Movement.  The following is my take on all this:

The early Imperium was nearing the point where absorption of
the territories to rimward were feasible, when haut-Devroe
published his "Solomani Hypothesis" in 114.  What started as an
innocent statement that Terra was the homeworld of humanity was
rapidly appropriated and turned into the 47th century\'s version
of social Darwinism.  Cultural Solomani seem to like living on
HiPop worlds, and it\'s likely that the Second Empire and Long 
Night gave the Solomani the chance to solidify their hold over 
the rimward end of the old Vilani empire.  It seems likely that
more barons are made on higher population worlds, so sudden
absorption of the Solomani region could have seriously altered 
the political balance in the Moot.  (DGP made the population
density in Solomani regions higher than everywhere else.  For
game reasons, this makes sense -- it helps explain the heavy
duty Solomani cultural influences.)

Artemsus, intent on maintaining the character of the Imperium
and worried about the situation, declined to absorb Terra,
and stopped expansion at the line running from the thumb of the
Great Rift to Delphi Rift.  He wanted to put off absorption until 
the empire could take it.  There was no Sol Pacification Campaign.
(A parallel with the RC\'s problems.)

Later emperors expanded carefully into the region.  Porfiria
opened a trade corridor to the Easter Concord in 305, and Martin III
finally accepted its\' allegiance in 426.  Ambassadors, client-
states, and a growing Imperial presence became common.

Then Cleon IV overturned everything, by killing the last of the
Lentuli line.  When somebody finally got rid of him, it\'s likely
that the Moot was controlled by Solomani nobles.  With no Imperial 
line, the Moot came into its\' own politically.  It elected the
next two emperors.  Jerome ruled for less than a decade before
someone killed him.  The next, Jacqueline, aggressively expanded
to rimward, although it\'s likely that Jerome was of a similar
mind.  However, Jacqueline neglected the power of her admirals
and the discontent of the Spinward Marches (and perhaps the
established Vilani interests), and helped set off the Civil War.

Note that all the claimants to the throne during the Civil War 
were genetically pure Solomani.  If Solomani nobles controlled
the Moot and hence the acknowlegement process, being pure
Solomani may well have been a necessity to have even a chance of 
Moot recognition.

Arbellatra came along.  The end of the Civil War gave her
a chance to replace a lot of nobles, and no doubt this was an
opportunity to quietly lay the groundwork for the eventual
breaking of the power of the most powerful members of the
Solomani faction at Court.  The plan didn\'t come to fruition
until Zhakirov married Antiama and replaced many of the high
officials in his counsels.  (This is what Norris and Strephon
mean when they deride Dulinor\'s precipitous actions.  Think
long-range.)  The Solomani faction was caught unprepared and 
was broken.  (A concerted action by the rest of the Moot would
probably be enough.)

Then the Solomani managed to get Margaret I to give them an
autonomous region (that included some Aslan worlds she had no
right to give them, probably on purpose).  Zhakirov may have
defeated them, but they still had power in the government.
This worked out for about a century and a half, and then the 
independence movement, radical politics, and the build-up 
toward the Solomani Rim War started in the 860s, leading to
virtual secession in 871, and the Rim War in 990.

With the DGP data files, I did a real rough estimate of total
Confederation population once, and the total population of the
Solomani Confederation (without the post-Rim War divot)
may have been about three-quarters that of the rest of the 
Imperium in 990.  I think that by the Battle of Terra, they\'d
basically worn down each other\'s will to fight already,
and what Terra did was stalemate the war again, but with 
neither side willing to continue.  Before the Second Civil
War and Collapse, it was the worst war the Imperium fought.
This helps explain why the Imperium waited a century to act.

Anyway, JSHiggin@aol.com wrote that Solomani-Vilani mixing was bull, because
the trillions of Vilani would completely absorb the Solomani in a few
thousand years.  Would someone please do the math and tell me what
birthrates the Solomani and Vilani would require for the Solomani to equal
the Vilani population in 3,000 years?  At least one reason for Solomani
expansion in the first place was population pressure.  It seems likely,
especially if Vilani culture was stagnating, that the Solomani reproduced
much faster than the Vilani.  Moreover, the UN probably tried to boost
Terran population through various incentive programs once contact was made
with the Vilani.

CASUAL ENCOUNTER

	The PCs should have a jump capable ship. Ideally they
should be on a short insystem haul near either a multi-mooned
gas giant or a planetoid belt. Their sensors will pick up a
short/haul vehicle (equivalent to pick up truck) coasting on
a vector near theirs. On a nearer pass or good sensor scan they
can determine that it has nearly exhausted its fuel supply and
probably doesn\'t have enough left to change its course to
get anywhere meaningful. Backtracking its course only reveals
that it may have come from any number of places. The vehicle
does not answer hails or attempts at communication.
	A close approach will reveal that the vehicle is
occupied by one woman who waves a bit anxiously. She has no
vacc suit and is dressed quite inappropriately. It is also
readily apparent that by the conventional norm of this system
she is also *devastatingly* beautiful. She has not answered
hails because she does not know how to operate the radio.
She will try to communicate with sign-language or any other
means the players can come up with.
	The short/haul does not have an integral airlock.
To gain entry the players must either rig a lock between
their ship and the short/haul or take it into their dock
or hold (8t craft). Alternatively they can talk the woman
into a rescue ball (which the vehicle does have) and
blow the seals.
	Once abroad she will thank the players profusely
but say she needs more help. If they ask her name she
says Mlny (the local system isn\'t that fond of vowels).
If pressed for a surname she panics slightly and picks
something obvious (like one of their names, if embroidered
on their suits). She says she is fleeing from her ex-husband
and wants to get out of the system. She has no ids, papers,
or really anything more than what she is dressed in. Any
system they say they are going to she says is fine.
	Any character attracted to her gender is extremely
distracted in her presence. It probably wouldn\'t occur to many 
to even think of asking money for doing a favour to someone
who looks like a supermodel. For those who do she will say
she can access funds in their destination system and will
agree to any price that the characters feel is reasonable.
She is also willing to work passage.
	While on their ship she seems to display an extreme
neivativity. Yet, at the same time she is also incredibly
quick on the uptake. She is extremely agile with very fast
reactions and, as any forward players might find, much
stronger that you would think a woman of her build would be.
Although she appears familiar with no task or skill she is
willing to try her hand at most things and generally does quite
will for someone who obviously knows nothing about it.
	If the PCs stop to take on passengers (since they
were only traversing insystem, possibly on special contract
to pick up extra passengers), they will be approached by
a man named Smth. He will ask after Mlny and wish to meet with
her. She absolutely does not want to meet with anyone other
than the players. Smth will not be too forthcoming of answers
but if refused contact he will attempt to buy a ticket on
the ship. If they refuse he will book passage in a different
name through a travel agent. If they refuse to let him board
he will go to the starport authorities. Depending on your interstellar
law they will probably have to take him as a ticketed passenger.
	If they have registered Mlny as crew then they can
try to keep her in crew sections. She is more than willing to
cooperate. She is not interested in mixing with anyone but
crew anyway. Smth will doggedly attempt to find her but not so
far as breaking Ship Law.
	After extended contact with Mlny the players will notice
a number of incongruities. What first appeared as neivativity
can be seen as very strange holes in her education. The idea of
a book will come as a surprise to her, yet she will be seen to
have a tremendous reading speed. She has no training in ballet
or stage art but after observing some can enact it perfectly.
	Her looks are naturally devastating and chemical analysis
does not reveal any illegal pheromones. She is perfect in form.
Very perfect. Her stats are FFFF2A.
	If she does win the hearts of the players and becomes
close with them she may eventually admit that she really doesn\'t
have any money. She just want desperately to get away from
the man who claimed he was her husband. She can\'t really remember
things that clearly but she knew she was being treated terribly.
She throws herself on their mercy.
	The referee can choose whatever solution bests suits them:

1) Mlny is a genetic creation, commissioned by Smth\'s employer to
	be his perfect wife. Legally she is his property. He is
	very rich and will continue to pursue her as long as she
	is within 6 parsecs of his system.
2) Mlny is a genetic creation, commissioned by the local government
	from GeneCorp as the perfect assassin. She escaped before
	her training/indoctrination could commence. Smth is a government
	agent sent to recover her.
3) As 2) but for the Imperial government. Smth must recover or destroy
	her.
4) Mlny is an android, a bio-robot. She escaped from her institute
	before her educational programming could be completed. She
	was halfway through domestic education and has a fixation
	that the institute is her "husband". Smth must recover her
	but really has little resources.
5) Mlny is an android, a bio-robot. She was created by the local
	system computer net which has grown to the complexity of
	a self-aware AI. It has placed a subset of itself in her
	to explore the human experience. Her husband is a fiction
	to give her drive and Smth is to observe, put pressure
	on her, and eventually repossess her for integrating her
	experience back into the AIs knowledge base.
6) As 5) except Smth is another biological peripheral. He has been
	given the compulsion to love and pursue her, she to hate
	a flee him. The computer seeks to observe and learn, and
	eventually reintegrate.

Allow me to quote from Stephen Hawking\'s "A Brief History of Time":

	There may be primordial black holes ... that were made by the collapse
   	of irregularities in the very early stages of the universe.  Such black
	holes would have a much higher temperatre and would be emitting radiation
	at a much greater rate [than normal black holes].  A primordial black
	hole with an initial mass of a thousand million tons would have a 
	lifetime roughly equal to the age of the universe.  Primordial black
	holes iwth initial masses less than this figure would already have 
	completely evaporated but those with slightly greater masses would still
	be emitting radiation in the form of X rays and gamma rays. (pg 108)

So, you see, the primordial black holes (a.k.a quantum black holes) may still
be
around.

OK.  Any idea what proportion?


Anyway, I think that we agree that:

1. AM is a more hazardous power source than fusion.

2. AM is too damn useful: doctrine will be developed to take advantage of its

energy while minimizing the risks.  (Personally, I think there are going to
be 
some nasty incidents while the bugs get worked out of the doctrine).

Is it worth working out some sort of a damage curve for an AM explosion?
Taking
into account a "long flare" model, the neutrino component of the reaction,
and 
the heavy particle flux from the unconverted matter and AM, including
secondary 
radiation from the AM flux encountering target ship hull?  Lots of work, but 
would it be worth it?

Well, all you have to do is seperate the Saucer Section, which I would
presume would probably be some sort of Engineering/Mechanical subskill.
Piloting would be handled by Ship\'s Boat -- No "Jump/Warp Drive" on the
Saucer, after all...

(This ties into the whole "Keep the antimatter in a seperate armored pod out
on a boom away from the main hull" suggestion, too...)

(From "Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy" by the Editors of Analog and

"The famous philosopher Will James had just finished giving a lecture on 
the solar system in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when he was approached by 
an elderly admirer.  She was shaking her head and umbrella and looking 
very stern.

"Mr. James," she admonished him, "I am shocked by your notion that we 
live on a ball rotating aroung the sun.  That is patently absurd."
   Politely, James waited, incluning his head towards her.
   "We live on a crust of earth on the back of a giant turtle," the grande 
dame announced.
   James, ever gentle, asked, "If your... um... theory is correct, 
madame, what does this turtle stand upon?"
   "The first turtle stands on the back of a second far larger turtle, of 
course," the old woman replied.
   James lifted his hand. "Ah, madame, but what does this _second_ turtle 
stand upon?"
   The dowager\'s eyes were bright.  She laughed triumphantly, "It\'s no 
use, Mr. James - it\'s turtles all the way down!"                  :)

    Weren\'t around for Classic, eh?  Gvurrdon was written up in Alien
Module 3: Vargr.  Unfortunately, while a map WAS provided, plus standard
world Data (3 TL16 worlds in the sector, FYI), they did NOT name any other
subsectors.;-(

    Solomani Rim was written up in Supplement 10: Solomani Rim,
also in Alien Module 6 : Solomani.  Possibly also in Rats & Cats.

    Plus many others that others will no doubt remind you of.  There
was a moderately complete list posted some years back...

I don\'t know if it mentioned anywhere but there are hints in High Guard 
(CT) and MT (I don\'t know how much is mentioned in FF&S or TNE).

High Guard mention how much capacitor-charge is available to the ship due 
to normal jump drives.  If my memory serves me right - 0.25%?? of ship mass 
per jump number - don\'t quote me on that!!

MT gives a value for the storage charge per cubic metre of \'capacitors\' - 
"raw energy".

Reading DGPs Starship Operators Manual vol1, they mention how the jump 
drive is simply an oversized, extremely inefficient fusion powerplant.

Fuel usage from MT and High Guard (and Striker and Book 8 Robots if you 
want to use some obscure sources) give a relationship between fuel 
consumed and power output.  CT and MT (does TNE - I\'m not sure) give time 
from starting the jump sequence to actualling jumping.  This is the time 
it takes the powerplant to power up the capacitors.  Engine efficiency 
can be worked out from this.

>From there, there are two possible philosophies we can follow.
1) The jump (fusion powerplant) engine consumes energy at a continual, 
consistent rate for the rest of the jump - keeping the ship in jump space 
and moving.

2) The jump drive releases more energy at the reentry stage - to \'break 
through into the \'real\' universe.

in 1) it is easy to work out the EmLevel of the ship at breakout.  Find, 
or guess, some figures on the time it takes to complete the transistion 
back to normal space; multiply by the power output of the jump plant 
during the normal jump flight and add this to the powerplant of the ship 
(assumed to be running on full - ready to manoevre) - hey presto a new 
output level to calculate the EmLevel of the ship.

in 2) things get more opinionated.  Really its simply a matter of what 
you like, but I would suggest that it requires the same energy to 
traverse the jump/normal space barrier in either direction, if it takes 
any to exit (which personally I am in favour of).

Therefore, the process is even simpler - if you agree with the \'same 
energy either way\' concept.  Just calculate the energy output of the jump 
engine at entry to jump space, and that is the energy output of the jump 
enginer at exit from jump space.

Another argument that can be put forward in support of this theory, is 
that of forced re-entry into normal space.  In the words of various books 
- I don\'t have my bibliography here to access - ships that try to jump 
inside of the 100 diameter boundary re-enter "..violently.." at the 
boundary.  It is my view that as the engine is not actually running at 
any higher rate (not programmed to re-enter at that point in time/space), 
the energy required to re-enter is \'taken\' from the ship itself.  This is 
manifested in either temperature and/or physical changes.  The structure 
gets stressed, is warped in shape, heats up or cools - whichever...!

I know the physics theory is not there but we are dealing with jump 
space/FTL drives.  We all know that the physics theory for those is not 
there either so...it\'s all a matter of opinion anyway.

Anyway, if anyone has got comments or additions they would be interesting 
to read - please do tell.  //count@easynet.co.uk

Y\'know, this makes me sick. "We want to get more sales so all the laws of [game]
physics change and reality\'s different - so the game works better." Have you any
idea how much contempt players pour on an established background where the most
basic laws of reality suddenly change ? One of the reasons I _still_ like AD&D
is that you can take a character you used to love playing in 1983 and still play
them today - and recognise them.  All my old Traveller characters equipped
themselves with the best equipment they could get. Suddenly - bang! Their
equipment\'s crap and the other options are better. Realism ? Hah! 

NB this is NOT a flame at the poster of the above comment - sorry guy - nor even
at GDW. I\'d be quite happy to buy your Traveller products, guys, but you no
longer make any...

  The (no longer canonical) thrust plates always bothered me a 
  little on the basis of blatant violation of physical law - they 
  appeared to be a reactionless propulsion system that had the 
  effect of changing the momentum of a closed system.

  Last night (yes, I had been "drinking"; my family and I went to 
  the Crown Plaza for a champagne brunch) something occurred to me:  
  Thrust plates weren\'t reactionless - what they did was convert 
  grav energy into neutrinos, and toss the neutrinos in the 
  direction opposite the desired direction of travel, a la Newton, 
  II.  This would have the effect of _appearing_ reactionless, 
  because neutrinos are about as near to non-existent as you can 
  get without actually failing to exist - they ignore almost 
  anything smaller than a small sun.

  I didn\'t follow this up at all; I\'ve got a couple of other 
  Traveller-related projects already in the works (crashing Sol and 
  Dingir subsectors, and seeing if I can rebuild a Terra-centered 
  pocket empire - yes, I\'ll post my results on the Traveller list 
  when I finish).  But it at least seems plausible; my roommate, a 
  BS(Physics), says that neutrinos do indeed possess that quality 
  known as momentum - which quality (or lack thereof) was the 
  problem with the original thrust plates.

  Anyone have the urge to do some _real_ math and decide whether 
  I\'m still soused?

I\'m pretty sure I remember Steve saying that normal PAWS fired neutrons. The
APAWS described in the Alliance tech file is basically just a normal PA that
fires antimatter. So, assuming my memory hasn\'t failed, this is indeed an
anti-proton particle accelerator.

This should probably be on a ftp site somewhere.  The following
list was put together with the help of HIWG as part of a
continuing effort to avoid contradicting existing Traveller
materials.  Some of the listings are not necessarily "in the
canon" but reflect development efforts -- I tried to mark as
many of these as possible.  Gvurrdon is based on Roger Myhre\'s
development efforts (beyond the bottom four.)  This list was
prepared before the top half of Far Frontiers was published.

THE CONSOLIDATED _TRAVELLER_ SUBSECTOR LIST     version 2.0b2
by Steve Bonneville                             9 June 1994

The following is a list of subsector names known in many of the
sectors in charted space.  There are a fair number of holes in the
data which await filling.  The list is organized alphabetically by
sector, and positionally within the sector, in the standard format.
Some sectors which may be "apocryphal" end the list in a separate
section, out of order.  Some are on the main list -- depends on
rough guess.

While most information is from products, the more obscure information
was either gleaned from the DGP/GDW sector files in the TML ftp
archives, or was obtained from HIWG members.

Subsector names may change without warning after the Collapse!  The
list data is circa 1100.
Examples:  Massilia/A was Kerr is Ershur.           [DGP/GDW]
           Old Expanses/M was Nicosia is Aubaine.
           Old Expanses/N was Sarid is Oriflamme.
           Alpha Crucis/A was Ximenes is Lazzerton. [Sol. Rim]
If no conflicting data is available, TNE name (if known) is given on
main list.

The "Apocryphal":

These are published sectors in which the "canonicality" of the data
is uncertain or questionable.  By topic:

1) Judges Guild.  GDW has revoked the land grant to Judges\' Guild and
   all four sectors they published are "non-canonical".  No loss, folks;
   the quality was bad.  The sectors involved were Ley; Glimmerdrift
   Reaches; Crucis Margin; and Gateway, called "Marantha-Alkahest".
   The retcon was done for _Atlas of the Imperium_.  No information
   from these products appears here.

2) Paranoia Press.  All Paranoia Press materials were judged "non-
   canonical" by GDW at about the same time as all Judges\' Guild
   materials for Traveller were.  They published two sectors, "The
   Beyond" (blue book) and "Vanguard Reaches" (gold book), and
   subsector names for surrounding sectors comes from map margins.
   Both sectors appear on the positional map in DGP\'s canonical
   "Solomani & Aslan", and the star positions do not match. (DGP\'s are,
   IMHO, more interesting.)  Governments were moved around a bit, but
   some of the names are similar (Duchy of Treyln in same place, Esylat
   in subsector B instead of H).  Since something was saved and there
   was some relation to FASA products, the sectors/subsectors they
   listed are below:

3) Group One.  Theta Borealis was published by Group One back in the
   very early days.  I saw a copy once a long time ago, but I have no
   idea how good this product is or how close it fits into the "canon".

4) Far Frontiers.  FASA held the "land grant", and their materials are
   still considered fairly canonical.  The _Traveller Chronicle_ has
   been printing subsectors recently, but note that they seem to reflect
   Paranoia Press materials more than DGP\'s material, so it\'s mentioned
   here.  (This makes sense, since the FASA material was originally
   developed at the same time as the Paranoia Press materials.)

   Since the FASA adventures still fit very well into the main flow of
   Traveller, the sector is listed in the main text.

5) Magyar.  DGP printed the Magyar sector library data and maps in
   _Traveller\'s Digest_ #14, but unlike every other sector they printed,
   this one had major consistency problems.  First, the subsector names
   along the trailing edge of the sector did not match those in GDW\'s
   _Solomani Rim_ supplement.  Second, the X-boat lines, as shown on the
   map, cross the Solomani/Imperial border as if it weren\'t there.  The
   star positions match those in DGP\'s later _Solomani & Aslan_ book.

   This one could be squeezed into the canon if (1) Solomani subsector
   names are different than Imperial subsector names in places, and (2)
   the X-boat routes shown show the system as it appeared prior to 990,
   when the Solomani Autonomous Region revolted.  Therefore it is listed
   in the main text as well.

As much as I\'d like to see a lot of out-of-print Classic Traveller stuff
re-appear in electronic form for redistribution, it probably isn\'t going
to happen because people are for the most part nice enough not to go around
violating copyrights like they wern\'t there.

My question is, what\'s the limit on copyright protection? Patents are only
17 or 20 years (somthing close to that) and although I know copyrights hold
longer than that, eventually they too expire (which is why Great Classics Of
Literature goes for $5 and the latest Stephen King drek goes for $50 for
the same size/format).

So, anyone know when it would be passibly-legal to put stuff like
The Travellers Digest into electronic form? In our lifetime?

 Anti-neutrons do exist, (They were discovered in 1955 at the Berkley
Bevatron) but they have the same problem that neutrons have, you can\'t
guide them or accelerate them with magnetic fields. You would have to
use some sort of gravity focusing or some science fiction thing.
Anti-protons would be more useful.
 I don\'t think they would be more effective then normal neutrons. A
normal neutron would smash into an atom, releasing photons though
Bremstrahlung, (The release of photons by a decelerating charged
particle) THe atom it hits will also be effected, either flying away or
releasing other particles.
  An anti neutron will collide  into things until it hits a neutron and
it decays into gamma rays. These are pretty lethal to crew memebers,
but so are just neutrons, hence the old concept of the neutron bomb.  I
think anti-matter bombs are a more inventive way to use anti-matter.

    You heard it on Xboat, I don\'t do TML anymore.

    As to the growth rates required, they are not excessive in
either case.  The only problem is the assumption that the
Vilani will grow slowly enough for the Solomani to catch up.
    Note that both groups are still Homo Sapiens, therefore both
still have the same inherent birth rate (monthly fertility
cycles, nine month pregnancy, such like).
    Note also that the Vilani (more about this farther dwon the
page) also have a significantly longer lifespan than Solomani
humans do.
    All other things being equal (they won\'t be), the Vilani will
then have a higher growth rate than the Solomani do.  Their birth-
rate is the same, but their death-rate is lower, therefore more
net growth.

    Considerations that will effect either or both groups:

    1) local population density.  The more people living on the
world in question, the lower the birth rate is likely to be.  In
the early days of the 2nd Imperium, the Terrans (in minute numbers
on a myriad of worlds) would not be significantly impacted by
this.  Later, as Terran population rose (and the Long Night set
in), the Terrans would be as affected by this as the Vilani.  Note
that the effect on the Terrans would come long before the Terran
population rose to match the VIlani population, in all likelihood.
    Note also that Terrans moving to sparsely inhabited Vilani
worlds would not be affected at all.  As the world population
rose from a few million (or less) to billions, the two populations
would tend to equalize in numbers, or merge into a single
population.
    Note that if the Vilani were, in fact, stagnant, that there
would be very few "sparsely inhabited Vilani worlds" for this to
happen on.

    2) Social mores of either/both group.  If interbreeding were
encouraged, then the Terran population would disappear into the
Vilani genepool in only a few generations.  Note that the Vilani
will have a uniform attitude toward interbreeding with "lesser"
breeds of humanity.  What that attitude is, I have no idea, but
it should be uniform.  Terran attitudes will vary, but it is
reasonable to expect that they will be fairly open to such ideas,
given the assumption that the Terran Confederation is dominated
by the USA.  That is by no means certain, but it is the way to
bet given the very near future of the Interstellar Wars.

    3) Biological compatibility.  They are both the same species,
but that DOESN\'T mean interbreeding is a trivial exercise.  Note
that a pygmy and a Watusi are the same species, and casual
reproduction between two representatives of these groups would
be a non-trivial exercise, given the significant difference in
average size of a pygmy woman and a Watusi man.  Carrying a babe
to full term _might_ be difficult in the extreme for the little
lady...

    In any case, further note that Terran colonies were spread
far beyond the bounds of the First Imperium.  So, in those areas,
at least, the Terrans would be free to grow without restriction.
And the Spinward Marches certainly qualifies in as one of these
areas, so it is quite possible that the Marches/Trojan Reaches
area has significant Solomani populations.  Possibly even a
majority.  But in the main body of the old Imperium (in front of
the Claw?), the Vilani should have long since absorbed the Terran
immigrants into the general populace.

    Note that this thesis applies to ANY minor human race
encountered by the Vilani during the First Imperium.  Vilani and
Vargr notes that lots of Vilani blood implies a longer than
normal lifespan.  They also make this fraction of Vilani blood
unusual, even within Vland Sector.  This is inconsistent with the
assumption that the VIlani have absorbed all the other human
races into their own genepool.
   However, also mentioned is that several minor human races have
disappeared completely in the 10,000 years of Vilani space-faring
history.  This leads me to speculate that a minor human race
encountered very early in the Vilani expansion may have been very
long-lived.  When this race was abosrbed into the Vilani
population, it introduced a small set of long-life genes into
the Vilani pool.  In susequent millenia, this importation from
an early minor race has come to be identified with classic
"Vilani bloodlines".  Therefore it is rare, even in Vilani
dominated territory, and closely associated with the "racial
Vilani" since the otehr race would have been absorbed and
all but forgotten very early in Vilani history...

    Good one.   A few minor (potential?) problems:

    In the Imperium, that is illegal.  Even if she is geneered, she
is a "sentient lifeform", and therefore has all the rights of an
Impy citizen...

    Ditto for both of these.
    Of course, governments have been known to violate their own laws
in the past...The implications (both for the government and for the
PCs (who _may_ be in it deep by this time)) could be VERY interesting.

    What\'s the difference between an android and a "genetic creation"?
Therefore possibly the same problem as the previous three...

    This is very close to something happening in our game.  The
potentials (in ours) so far have been ...interesting...

    Note that there are no real disqualifiers here.  It\'s actually
the best Casual Encounter I have seen in a long time...

    Quite possibly.  I am the first to concede that I haven\'t
thought through all the implications of ANY new technology.  The
commlag problem will always be with you, though.  In a battlefield
where seconds can make a crucial difference, even 1,000,000Km may
be too far.  But if you know this, and build that assumption into
your Doctrine, then something can probably be made that will deal
with the problem, albeit imperfectly...

    Certainly is tricky.  But almost everything ever declared to
be obsolete (including spears) still finds use in military actions
somewhere (consider the bayonet, if you doubt me).  Perhaps the
biggest mistake that can be made in military and scientific
matters is saying "It can\'t" or "It\'s impossible"...

    More than half.  Beyond that, I don\'t remember.  A safe assumption
should be half, since that way the real thing would never be as bad
as your theoretical model...

    Yep.  I agree that there will be some nast accidents early on.
Not as many as you might think, because AM can be treated as "just
another explosive", like we have been dealing with for 4000 years
as of then.  But some certainly.  I personally expect to see at
least one major city ruined by an AM ship losing it at the wrong
time.  Which should mean that AM use on/near inhabited planets
should be absolutely forbidden before real long...

    I don\'t know.  I am inclined to say that dramatic license should
apply here, but that is a copout.  George, you know more about the
"long flare" model than anyone else is willing to admit.  Care to
take a stab at the effects of a ton of AM going up in an

True - I believe that is why the NPAWS is not introduced until the same tech
level as the other gravetic technologies.  Remember, too, that we are talking

about technologies which (in the case of the Alliance ships which have been
posted on xboat) can produce and handle anti-matter on a scale that, seems,
well, pure science fiction ;-).

But would they not all have a negative charge, and so tend to disperse -- a
poor

Now, it is clear from your answer that you are quite knowledgable on these
matters, but I find the conclusion surprising.

Looking first at the neutron stream impacting armour: The armour is dense and

thick, designed to absorb attacks such as this.  That means that there is a high
probablity that the neutron, having caused some photon release, broken up a few
neuclei, etc will finally exhaust itself having done some degree of damage to
the material proportional (more or less) to its kinetic energy.  This will
doubtless cause some damage to the hull material (such as happens, say, to the
materials within a fission reactor) but will probably cause most of its effects
to the target as a result of secondary radiation: I believe that this was
expected to be the main cause of AFV crew kills with the neutron bomb.

On the other hand, the anti-neutron stream will do damage not only as a result
of the kenetic effects but as a result of the release of the rest-energy of
both the anti- and target neutron.  Also, since the target material is designed
to absorb neutrons, the stream should be fully converted to energy within a very
short period of time.  I would expect that the  resulting release of energy and
wholesale atomic breakdown within the fabric of the hull itself should not just
have particle level effects: there should be obvious macroscopic effects from
the shock wave as a portion of the target suddenly becomes a plasma.

That is, wouldn\'t it blow a boody great hole in the hull?

I am prepared to be disuaded of this (Lord knows it wouldn\'t be the first time
on this list). ;-).

Not unlike every other sector they printed. There were some serious problems
in their Dark Nebula and Reavers\' Deep information too. They had an Ulane
Hegemony run by a minor non-human race in place of the Union of Harmony,
their data about Coventry in Reavers\' Deep did not agree with the Gamelords
data, and Kusyu were moved from ca. 12 parsecs from the border to 2 parsecs
from it (the last may not be their mistake, but it is nevertheless a big
mistake IMO).

Here are the rules I think I would go with:

1.    High Guard combat:  small craft launched or to be recovered in the turn
of
      an AM explosion in the mother craft subject to a role for destoyed/
severe
      damage/ no effect.


2.    Role Playing: Ships outside of 5000 km safe, 5000-1000 km possible sensor 
      damage, 1000-100 km definate sensor damage, 100-50 km, sensor damage and 
      possible ship damage, possible radiation effects, 50-10 km, same but
      more severe, possible destruction, under 10 - toast.

3.    BL: same hex, conduct a "difficult" attack against each sensor system 
      to cause 1h.  Probably some more rules are needed, I don\'t have BL.

4.    BR: same hex, temporary sensors hit.  White-out should be 5 turns.

Sorry to "polute" xboat with TNE references, but I cross-post this stuff.

The Universe I am working on is only tech 8.5, so I have a way to go before I
have to worry about AM.

Neutrons don\'t emit bremsstrahlung radiation for the reason you mentioned
above - they\'re not charged!

At the energies of PAWs (which I presume must be greater than the energies we
can reach in current day paticle accelerators) the anti-neutron will not
need a neutron to \'decay\'. Instead what happens is that it will form a
shower of particles as the 3 quarks which make it up are pulled apart from
one another by the force of the impact. (this is technically what happens
but it\'s the easiest way to descibe it).

Generally speaking there will be very little difference between a neutron or
anti-neautron stream at the energies which we are talking about. The
present-day
SPS accelerator at CERN produces 450GeV protons, which, on striking a target
are easily capable of producing 2-300GeV neutrons. The rest mass of these
neutron is around 1GeV and hence this accounts for less than 0.5% of the
energy
of typical high energy neutrons today and we already have plans for
accelerators
with 10 times this energy...

The only difference between the two is their interaction cross-section which
will be slightly greater for the anti-neutron beam rather than the neutron
one. Hence the neutron beam has a greater penetration (slightly) then its
antimatter couterpart and is probably preferable since its a lot easier to
make.

I believe that the best way of creating a neutral beam though is not to use
neutrons but to accelerate both protons and electrons and eject the beams 
together - using gravity would be extremely unlikely as you require such
enormous fields (its about 10E37 weaker than the EM field) and if they can do
this then why bother with anti-matter - you can create blackholes and use
those as your power source (matter in => energy out).

Digests are busted every 1000 lines or 24 hours since the last digest.  At
what
point is your mailer dieing?  A 1000 line digest is about 30K, which is under
the standard 32K mailer limits (and should be ok for windows based programs).

Of course, messages, such as the subsector names contain a lot of long lines
which might push the digest size over 32K.

What do you think?  Should I lower the line count down to 800 before a digest
is busted?  This will increase the number of digests, but generally wont 
increase traffic.

The intent is that one week is spent in hyperspace.  All calucations are done
in the trip out to 100 planetary diameters.  (I know this is Xboat, but
forgive
me) In TNE, they refined the jump description by saying that the average jump
is 6 days, some are shorter some our longer (by at most one day unless there
is a mishap).

> Also, what is hyperspace? 

J-space is another dimension where the laws of physics are different from
that
of N-Space or normal space.  A ship basically aims it self where it wants to
go, punches its way into J-Space and in about 1 week, the ship is
precipitated
out back to n-space.  How far one can travel while in j-space is a function
of the ships jump drives.

> What is its effects on the ship and the crew? 

Bascially inside the ship, things are normal.  Communications, combat, or
contact with the outside are impossible.  Many people suffer nausea, and
other
"sea-sick" ailments during transition to and from Jump.  Typically this is
taken care of with a drug (Space age Dramimene).  Interestingly enough in 
Challenge 75, there is an adventure that takes place based on Jump sickness.

> What would someone see if they looked outside a window when the ship

In my universe, hyperpaces consists of a blur of colors: Fushica, Mauve, 
Turqouise, Teal, lavender and other generaly anoying colors, such that they
really don\'t want to look.  I also say that if they do look insanity is sure
to infect them for the rest of their lives.  So my goal is to get it so the
players dont want to look, so I don\'t have to deal with it.

Others have claimed that it is solid white, or a starfield moving real fast,
(ah la Star Trek or Star Wars).

I don\'t know if GDW has ever defined the effects of space, so make it up.

What happens if a ship is thrown into j-space without having done the

to go next? 

Is J-space constant, or is it created by a ship choosing to use it. 

If a ship jumped from an one point in  space to another point in space
and then repeated that jump at another time, will j-space remain
constant?

Let me begin by reminding the reader that the
following is not legal advice, that I do not
specialize in intellectual property law, and that
I am not rendering any legal opinion on the
following matters.  Caveat lector, as the saying
is.
 
There was a question on this list regarding the
expiration of copyrights on Traveller products. 
As to Traveller itself, copyrighted in 1977 (if
memory serves), the rule is:
"Any copyright, the first term of which is
subsisting on January 1, 1978, shall endure for 28
years from the date it was originally secured." 
17 U.S.C.A. 304(a)(1)(A) (West Supp. 1994).  
 
In addition, 
"In the case of ... any work copyrighted by a
corporate body ... the proprietor of such
copyright shall be entitled to a renewal and
extension of the copyright in such work for the
further term of 47 years."  Id. 304(a)(1)(B)(ii).
 
So GDW, Inc., has the copyright for 75 years (until 2053).
 
The foregoing assumes that Traveller was
copyrighted in 1977.  Many products -- adventures,
modules, revisions, periodicals, etc. -- were
copyrighted on or after January 1, 1978, however. 
The rule applicable to these items is as follows:
 
"In the case of ... a work made for hire, the
copyright endures for a term of seventy-five years
from the year of its first publication, or a term
of one hundred years from the year of its
creation, whichever expires first."  17 U.S.C.A.
302(c) (West 1977).  
 
The copyrights on these items would accordingly
not begin to expire until 2053 (=1978+75).

In theory the j-drives wont fire unless they are programmed properly, else
a mis-jump would occur.  There are no navigational changes that are makeable
in j-space, no land marks.  A ship unexpectidly thrown into space with out
the aid of their j-drives would basically sit for 5-7 days and would
preciptate
out right where they were.

Casual Encounter/NPC

This is more of an NPC description than a more fleshed out casual encounter,
but I hope it will serve as a springboard to adventures revolving
around the NPC. I\'ve seen NPCs detailed like this in the Casual Encounter
section of Challenge, so that\'s where I took a lot of my cues from.

Any comments or feedback to me would be appreciated.

Having a copy of CT Aliens Module 4, Zhodani, would be handy to help
describe Piebzdhe\'s armor as well as showing you how to say his dang name.

Piebzhde-atl (Captain)
78B8AB Psi-13 32 years old
Guard/Thought Police-O3
Skills:
Cbt Rifleman-2  Grav Vehicle-1
Mechanical-1    NV Communication-3
Forgery-1       Psychology-3
Bribery-1       Streetwise-1
Carousing-1     Interrogation-2

Psi Abilities:
Teleport-13     Telepathy-13
Clairvoyant-13  Special-13 (see below)

Possessions:
(usually) approx Cr.60,000
Gauss Rifle
Snub Pistol
Zhodani-style Chameleon Cbt Armor
(TL13. Guards Model Zhodani armor. everything)
Grav Trunk
 (A Grav Trunk is a large hard-bodied trunk for carrying personal
belongings - like a steamer trunk. It is fitted with low-gain grav
plates on the bottom that allow it to neutralize up to 150kg. It
carries about .5m^3 of cargo, sufficient for his disassembled armor
and rifle. It also has a formidable lock)

Appearance:  Piebzhde is a typical native Zhodani - tall, with dark
hair and complexion.  He is 2.1m tall (6\'10"), 110kg(~240lbs). 
Zhodane\'s gravity is about .85g, so Piebzhde is more comfortable in
slightly lower-gravity areas.  He is, however, used to and
comfortable in fields up to 1.2g. Like most space travelers, he can
withstand up to 2g before becoming severely incapacitated.

His special psionic ability is one which is rare but not unheard of -
perhaps 5% of all non-standard psionic powers are similar to his -
almost perfect memory.  Piebzhde can remember the face and name of
every person he has ever met. He can look at complicated technical
drawings and written scripts he does not even understand and retain
them perfectly, often later transmitting the images telepathically to
someone who can understand them.  To retain very complex images, like
blueprints or text written in a alien language, Piebzhde has to
expend one psi point per day per item memorized that he has not had 
time to study in detail. Detailed study requires 1D+2 hours for
something simple like a document to 1D+2 days for a large building to
1D+2 weeks for an entire spaceport/city.

Background:  Piebzhde is the classic story of Zhodani success - he
was born to a common Zhodani prole family on Zhodane, but because of
his exceptional psionic abilities discovered (relatively) late in life
(14 years) was quickly whisked off to training for life as an
intendant.  He signed on with the Zhodani Consular Guard and was
quickly transferred to the Tavrchedl\' - the Thought Police.

He has served as a shipboard officer, dealing with uncomfortable and
often intemperate troops, helping to weed out dissidents and keep
morale up.  More interestingly, he served as a staff officer on
newly-occupied planets during the Fifth Frontier War, including Lysen
during its occupation in 1109 and later, Querion.  He actively served
in the suppression of local uprisings and the reprogramming of
belligerent Imperials. His exposure to Imperial citizens and his
experience in dealing with non-Zhodani led to his transfer to
Intelligence.  He is quite used to dealing with Imperials, Solomani,
Vargr, Hivers, K\'kree and various other human and alien species.  He
has rarely dealt with Aslan and Aslan client races and will seek to
study them if it can be done safely - otherwise, he will avoid them. 
He avoids traveling in Aslan space.

Description:  Although Piebzhde is his real Zhodani name, he is
rarely know by that name where he is most likely to be found. 
Piebzhde will pick a Vilani or Solomani name as it suits him - often
probing the mind of the person his is dealing with to choose a name
that evokes familiarity or sympathy - the name of a close friend or
relative.  This results in him traveling under dozens of names,
although he is almost never questioned about it.

Piebzhde currently serves as an intelligence officer gathering
intelligence and general information in the Solomani Rim and along
the Solomani/Hiver border.  He is the perfect officer in the perfect
position for what he does - almost all authorities in this area of
space are totally ignorant of psionics and those who aren\'t ignorant
can do very little to stop their use. Piebzhde remembers everything,
everywhere and everyone.  He can forge documents to prove he is anyone
or to get him anywhere, largely aided by his ability to influence the
thoughts of the person checking the documents.  Although no casual
observer would guess that he once served reprogramming the minds of
Imperial citizens on a war border, anyone who works or spends time
with him can detect that he has a military or para-military
background.  His thoroughness and perceptiveness usually makes most
people (semi-mistakenly) think he was once a police officer in the
Solomani/Imperial sense - one who solves mysteries, tracks down
criminals and enforces the law.  While he will deny any accusations of
being a police officer, he will play up to anyone who suspects him of
such - he will make dramatic Sherlock Holmes-like inspections of crime
or archaeological scenes and conduct  Hercules Poirot-esque group
interrogations given the chance.  Since he can, of course, read minds
and see though walls, these are more showmanship than actual wit.  In
general, aside from these rare demonstrations, he is very cautious
about the use of his psionic powers although his prolonged stay in
Solomani space has made him less cautious than he should be. He does,
however, resist the temptation to reprogram disturbed individuals
he meets in Solmani space.  This is not to say he has never done it.
It is usually a bad idea, as he can leave a person effectively lobotomized.

His only major problem is the difficulty in returning him to Zhodani
space to give the occasional report - he is well known in the Marches
from his military police activities during the Fifth frontier war. 
Even worse, the closer he gets to Zhodani space, the more likely he
is to be recognized by Imperial authorities either as a Zhodani, or
worse, as himself.  Due the his unfamiliarity with Aslan customs and
minds, coupled with the large areas of empty space between the
Consulate and Aslan space, he is forced to go through the familiar
but unfriendly territory of the Spinward Marches whenever he wants to
return to Zhodani space.  This can pose a considerable problem.

Adventure Possibilities:  1) If the campaign is taking place in the
early/mid fifth frontier war (1108-1110), Piebzhde may be encountered
as a military police officer commanding a garrison on Lysen or
Querion. In this case, the players will meet him as a police officer
who may be their friend or foe.

2) If the campaign is later, around 1112, he will be somewhere around
the Solomani Rim, towards the Hiver federation border.  He will be
actively gathering intelligence on Solomani activity, Hiver
technology, possible Ancient sites and general cultural information.

3) Around 1114, he will be seeking to return to Zhodani space. This
won\'t be much of a problem (provided he detours around Core) until he
reaches the Marches. Then he is going to need the help of resourceful,
inconspicuous Imperial individuals. PCs.


After about 1114 to 1115, I don\'t know what he\'s going to be doing.
Piebzhde was generated as a CT Zhodani character, you may well need
to modify his abilities/attributes to fit him into a MT/TNE campaign,
if that\'s possible at all.

Just because both are Homo Sapiens does not mean their birth rates
will be equal.  Birth rates have traditionally been higher in the
poorer parts of the world, where lifespans tend to be shorter.  In
fact, the overall growth rate has been higher in those portions of
the world.

You can blame it on lack of birth control, religion, or whatever,
but I think birth rate has more to do with people\'s attitudes.
Those that are "secure" will tend to have lower birth rates, while
the "upstart" nations will tend to have higher birth rates.

So that means that if someone or something were to attempt to place landmarks

there , they may remain constant.

Let me tell you where I am going with all this. I am trying to create a race
of beings who are attuned to psionically to hyperspace. When they move about,
they open a hole and matter transport from one landmark to another.

	Anti-neutrons do exist. A neutron is made of of one UP quark
(charge +2/3) and two DOWN quarks (charge -1/3). An anti-neutron is made
of 1 UP and 2 DOWN anti-quarks (charge -2/3 and +1/3 respectively).
	The neutron is a fermion. Like all fermions it has a distinct
anti-particle of opposite parity. (Neutrons have positive parity,
anti-neutrons have negative parity.) Only a boson (like, for instance a
photon or meson) can be its own anti-particle; and even then, only if
it\'s neutral.

>	(anti-protons can absorb and store neutrons, for that little

	An anti-proton cannot absorb a neutron and remain an
anti-proton. Both protons and neutrons are baryons, and baryon number is
strictly conserved. Protons and neutrons have a baryon number of +1,
anti-protons and anti-neutrons have a baryon number of -1. So the
reaction:

	anti-proton + neutron  -> anti-proton
	(-1)        + (+1)     -> (-1)
	           (0)         -> (-1)	!does not conserve baryon number

cannot occur.

    There is no real provision for this in HG per se.  I suggest
that the role be defined as for critical hit/normal damage
(surface hit + radiation hit)/no damage.

    No comments.  I have neither BL or BR, and don\'t really expect
to pick either up in the near future, even though C and I are
working up our own version of the collapse/new era.

    I generally try to do most of my playing at either 10-12 or
15-16.  So AM _is_ relevant to me.  But only just, and NOT if we
switch to a post-collapse campaign...

remember where and I have almost certainly mutated it.  Anyone who recognises
it feel free to let me know.  This takes the form of an explanation given by an 
astrogator to an enquiring passenger on a liner.

It is a common misconception for people to think that Jump Space is one 
definite place that we go.  That\'s not so.  There are a large but finite number 
of dimensions, collectively know as jump space.  These are alternate dimensions 
which exist adjacent to ours and indeed in these the laws of physics that we 
are ruled by don\'t apply at all.  

These dimensions have the property of holding properly shielded matter and 
dropping it out into the \'real\' world a distance from the start point.  These
dimensions have levels of removal from our own space.  There are a number of 
discrete groupings of dimensions.  

The \'nearest\' ones are in group one and they are the easiest to enter.  
Dimensions in this group (called collectively the J1 space) move the ship about 
one parsec.  Any Jump drive has the power to force the ship into J1 space.  
Once in there, if the computers did their jobs, you cruise along for a week or 
so and come out at the right spot.  Some spaces allow quicker travel and some
are slower, some go slightly further and some slightly less.  Thats why a jump 
sometimes takes a day or so longer or shorter.  The computers can pick the 
right distance and direction but we still don\'t know how to select the faster
spaces, maybe someday we will.

The further out groups allow travel over longer distances.  There are J2, J3,
J4, J5 and J6 spaces for definite.  They get much harder to enter the \'further 
out\' they are and computing the distance and direction is much harder.  Thats
why J5 xboats need such big power plants and computers.  Theoretecists think 
that there are more J spaces out there but if they\'re there, they\'re so far out 
we can\'t even detect them.  All these groupings contain a large number of 
subgroup spaces which are \'longer\' or \'shorter\' and \'quicker\' or \'slower\'.

The scientific bigwigs are unsure what happens when a mis-jump occurs.  My 
favourite theory is that there are wild spaces which cross over from one group 
to the next.  If you are very, very unlucky your ship enters a wild space and
you are precipitated into a much higher space than you wanted.  You could end
up anywhere.

Some people say that  _things_  live in Jump Space and they prey on ships that 
enter.  If you enter an inhabited space then maybe all that arrives at the 
destination is a dead hulk with the bulkheads torn open from the outside and 
all the passengers and crew.......just gone

Another theory is that there is a race of warlike aliens which originated deep 
in the rifts above the galactic disk.  This ancient race learned how to stay in 
J Space jumping from space to space watching and waiting.  Every now and again 
they\'ll attack a ship and leave it\'s gutted shell to travel the spaces for ever.

Rumours aside we do know that an uncontrolled jump by a ship with a damaged 
grid or a bad computer will enter a space at random.  It\'s possible for the 
chaotic energy burst to push the ship into higher spaces than they could manage 
in a controlled jump.  Not recommended for the less than suicidal amonst us.

Dying of starvation or ashyxiation light years from the nearest star with a 
burnt out J Drive is not a fate I\'d want.

Of course I\'ve seen J Space with my own eyes.  Any Navigator worth his salt 
has.  If you can\'t even look at the spaces what good are you going to be to the 
ship if something goes wrong?  If you could beat the over-rides on the external 
viewers you\'d see it out there.  It\'s entirely grey and it moves over the ship 
like it was alive.  Like being imersed in the thick grey liquid that flows 
slowly all over the ship.  The longer you look at it the more you think you can 
see things in it.  Often you start to see colours in the shades of grey.  
Delicate patterns of blue and green and red.  Sometimes you find yourself 
thinking that the ripples writhing across the surface of the viewer is the 
inside of a giant throat and the ship is being devoured slowly by some ghastly 
thing.  People go mad easily watching it.  Sometimes it\'s like their mind just 
leaked away.  All thats left is an unthinking husk, incapable of doing anything 
except drool.  Often they rave.  More than one has claimed that there was 
something outside the ship.  A hand (or a claw) forcing its way through the J

Space material.  A face, seemingly of some lost traveller from a missing ship, 
pressed against the screen pleading for help.

One final thing.   If some mad fool opens a lock or there is a breach in the 
hull it oozes slowly inside the ship.  It acts like it is one enormous thing,
it seem very thick and viscous.  If the opening is small it just forms a small 
intrusion.  The bigger the opening the bigger the intrusion.

Back when I was in the navy I was aboard a ship that jumped with a hull 
breach.  We were trying to seal off the section with the intrusion when the 
second drive engineer stumbled.  He fell into the intrusion.  To my death I\'ll 
remember how he died.

For those who may not want to make it up, I quote from Starship Operator\'s
Manual, by Digest Group Publications, at 11-12:
"In order for a starship to be able to travel through jumpspace, the ship\'s
jump drive must first open a portal into the desired jumpspace.  To
accomplish this feat, the drive energizes a lanthanum grid which has been
incorporated into the ship\'s hull.  The vast energy flow across this hull
grid net causes \'unravelling\' to begin in the region of space the ship
occupies.  As the discharge of the drive energies to the hull grid
increases, the unravelling becomes great enough to open up a \'rift\' in the
weave of jumpspace. 
* * *
"As the rift closes, the protective jump field \'bubble\' around the ship is
also sealed.  This bubble keeps out the strange physics of jumpspace, and
serves to provide a safe region for the ship, where the normal physics of
our universe operate.  The bubble follows the contour of the jump grid
exactly, and appears as a dull, gray, undulating \'wall\' about a meter from
the surface of the hull."

It\'s a little more complicated than that, but not a whole lot.
Specifically, I\'m referring to the spinward portion of that "rift line" 
in Reavers\' Deep.

In 260-something, the Imperium had enough "interests" in the Deep
to warrant siding with the Principality of Caledon (based in subsector G)
against the Empire of Drexilthar (based in subsector K).

Drexilthar was the last of what could (with some legitimacy) be called a
Reaver State, run by a fairly obnoxious human minor race.  The Imperium
sent in "the Imperial White Fleet," which was apparently off the scale of
what the Iltharans could deal with, crushed the entire empire, and bombed
the homeworld down to pre-stellar tech.

The Imperium didn\'t occupy the Iltharan worlds (except for a base at 
Drexilthar itself), so this wouldn\'t quite qualify  as a Pacification 
Campaign, but it may have served as a demonstration of what the
Imperium COULD do, if it really felt like it.

Of course, with this buffer state out of the way, the Imperium started to
become a major player in the Aslan Border Wars for another century
or so, until the Peace of Ftalhr (sp?). [not that Aslan hadn\'t been 
tricking through for quite a while.  Remember the Emporer\'s Aslan Guard?
Formed from Aslan settling in what became Imperial territory.]

All right, you all...

I\'m compiling a subsector list for the Imperium (and anything else 
nearby): this is what I\'ve got now... (for the year 1116):



The full subsector list for Old Expanses is:

A: Dethenes     B: Quinoid   C: Ahrhi          D: Rusco

[1] Ile is spelled EYE-ell-eey, in case it isn\'t clear.


also,
Reavers\' Deep:

A: Farrift         B: Riftdeep          C: Riftrim       D: Gulf

[2] Yes, spelled with "gg" not "qq".  Thank a typo in FASA\'s 
     "High Passage" that got passed along by DGP for any
     confusion on that score.  Keith Bros. material published

Don\'t be so quick with the "unlike".  One continuity flaw that ran through
almost every sector was a failure to draw the X-Boat routes so that 
they connected with the Imperial Way Stations (you know, those oversized
scout bases that served as MAINTAINENCE DEPOTS AND ROUTING HUBS

They hit them occasionaly, but it seems only by obvious choice or blind

Subject: My View of Jumpspace

Yo People,
	I don\'t quite follow the standard published
Traveller view of Jump Space but rather that of
some of its literary inspirations. However I thought
it might contribute to the discussion...
	Jump space is a superset of normal space.
When a jump-engine activates it hurls the ships into
this space, after which it follows a ballistic course.
This works best in flat space. Where there is a gravity
gradient (curved space) the ship has a tendency to be
precipitated back into normal space.
	The formulas for calculating a jump are horrendously
complex and take non-polynomial time to solve. However,
in theory, you can jump from any point in the universe to
any other. It would just take a near infinite amount of
time to calculate it. There are, though, derived sets of
simpiler equations that work most of the time (except on
your normal mishap) that can be calculated much faster,
or even pre-calcuated within certain parameters. They
result in a varied transit time (usually 6-8 days) and
exit point (usually 100 diameters from target).
	When a ship is build there is usually encoded into
its mainframe\'s BIOS several thousand precalcuated jump
routes. These cover the normal range of mass the ship should
be carrying, the normal distances, and gravity points.
They provide a baseline from which the computer can interpolate
specifics.
	The human body has difficulty dealing with jump-space.
This is particularly bad in a high gravity gradient. Eyes have
a tendency to see around corners, joints bend oddly, just
lieing with a sheet on top of you can become an interesting
topolocial experiment. Consequently most civilised spacefarers
take drugs upon entry and coming up to exit of jump. This
cuts about a day off of both end.
	[There is one primitive culture that has been accelerated
to spacefaring by unscrupulous agents. They consider Jump Space
"The Otherworld" and the home of their god. Thus jump is a
religious experience. The gods must be placated and think well
of the ship to safely enter jump-space. The crew must be in a
suitble frame of mind. Most commonly they all take hallucinigenics
before jumping!]
	If you try to vary the parameters outside of 100 diameters
the simple equations are no longer valid. Frequently they will
still get you there but often with a large varience in exit point
or duration. Sometimes if the target gradient is missed the ship
may continue on and on until another graident is hit. This is like
finding a needle in a haystack, though, and a ship is quite likely
to run out of life support before it precipitates.

    Let\'s see.  Assume Vilani birthrate is "normal" for a high-
tech society.  That would be in the range of 1.2% to 1.5% per
year.  Let\'s assume a population of 10 trillion for them.  And
a lifespan of 150 years.
    Let us also assume that Solomani lifespan is 90 years.
Realistically, it\'s probably more, but let\'s assume that (note
that GDW assumes around 70 year lifespan...).  And an initial
population of 10 billion.
    Under those conditions, Solomani birthrate would be about
2.16%.  Which is around the world average today, I believe.
    Note that these assumptions are insanely stupid, really.
This results in equal number of Solomani and Vilani, but the
"equal numbers" are 1,216,993,250,000,000,000,000.  Just a tad
higher than the "reality" of the Third Imperium, eh?

    Someone has suggested that longer lived species have slower
birthrates.  This is true, but the Vilani and Solomani are the
same species, last I checked, so that argument is irrelevant.
    It has also been suggested that birthrates vary quite a lot
by society.  This is also true, but note that the determining
factor seems to be the relative wealth of the society.  With
wealthier societies having lower birthrates.  By that definition,
the SOLOMANI should have the lower birthrate in the Second 
Imperium period, since they made up the aristocracy of the
2I.
    Note also that the Long Night implies a certain amount of
die-back in the space formerly controlled by the First Imperium.
There is not much reason to believe that the die-back was
restricted to the Vilani, though (being the larger fraction of
the population) they undoubtedly suffered the greater number
of deaths.  It is doubtful that their losses were out of
proportion to their numbers though.

    Which, I guess, means that I stand by my assumption that
the Imperium is predominantly (99%+) Vilani genetically....

Anti neutrons do exist I am afraid.  The use of the term \'anti-\' does not 
in any way refer to electrical charge.  The proton is not an 
anti-electron, but would be based upon your presumption.  The key 
defining criterion is a quantum physics factor known as the Baryon 
number.  In \'real\' matter this is positive.  In anti-matter this is 
negative.  

There, hope that sorts out that argument.  Please look up any \'beginners 
guide to quantum physics\' style book, and look up Baryon Number.  How 
else do you think you get a molecule of anti-helium...with anti neutrons, 
anti-protons and anti electrons....of course!!!

Also, a few other things...

1 - I was looking at the CT Aslan module and it didn\'t seem to make any mention
of psionics. Are Aslan psionicly aware? Can they be trained? Can their minds
be read? Considering they almost share a big border with the Zhodani Consulate,
this could be a big deal...

2 - Erwin Fritz asked about the Zhodani combat armor I mentioned with the NPC
I posted. I\'ll post some info on it and maybe a name pronouncation too, soon.

3 - If anyone\'s curious, I got the Trav. Adventure and Darrians from GDW. Both
decent products except DARRIANS IS ELVES IN SPACE!!! What\'s with the darn pointy
ears?? Live in forests, high \'magical\' tech, pointy ears, tall, slim, blah,
blah, blah. Do Sword Worlders look like Orcs or something??? Sheesh.

Actually, they are more Vulcan like than elf like, but I guess that is ones 
perspective on them.  I have always liked the Darrians, but maybe its because
I like elves.

Now Sword Worlders look like troglodytes, no lizard men, no  . . .  (just
kidding).

One of the things I found interesting is the fact that Darrians are
genetically compatiable with Humans, and that the Darrians appear to be of
Solomani decent.
The Darrian book implies that most of the current "Darrian" is a half
solomani/half darrian.

  I\'ve been doing some thinking (it\'s tough to get the smell of the
  smoke out of my hair!) and came to the conclusion that there were 
  a number of races that have appeared in SF of varying levels of 
  plausibility that would make for potentially interesting 
  Traveller (any era).  I\'ve been thinking also about "translating" 
  some of these races into Traveller terms, and generating 
  "Contact-cum-Alien-Module" articles on them, or RICE Papers on 
  them and their planets.  How would this be received on the list?  
  Can I get into trouble, either from GDW or the Authors (or their 
  estates) for doing it?  Should I go ahead and do it?  What races 
  would people like to see? (No guarantees.  I\'m not going to try 
  to convert a race that I\'m not comfortably familiar with, or that 
  I haven\'t read.)

  My list so far:

        Fuzzy Sapiens, from H. Beam Piper\'s Fuzzy books, and the 
                       "add-on/alternate" Fuzzy stories by William 
                       Tuning and Ardath Mayhar.

        Sime and Gen,  from the series by Jacqueline Lichtenberg 
                       and Jean Lorrah.

  I\'ll be doing some spatial and temporal displacement to make them 
  fit into Traveller a little better, but I\'ll be keeping as much 
  of the physiology and cultural background as I can - obviously, 
  there\'s likely to be a strong need to "evolve" the cultures and 
  modify the history slightly, but what results should certainly be 
  recognizable...

 Spelled that way, it sounds like "pyebz-deh." Think of it as some local
holiday: Pyeb\'s Day.

 If it is spelled Piebzhde, then it would be pronounced as the above
but with a drunken slur: "pyebzh-deh," with the \'zh\' being pronounced
like the \'s\' in \'measure\' or the \'z\' in \'azure\' (admittedly, some regional
English speakers pronounce both of these as a bare \'z\'), or in the
same way that I was taught to pronounce (many years ago...) the French
pronoun \'Je.\'

You then drew certain conclusions.
 
I specifically did not ask you to estimate birth rates to begin your
analysis, however.  
 
Rather, I asked you to determine what birthrates were necessary to
reach the stated result.  
 
Please do that for us.  Thank you.
 
My intention is to see whether the birthrates arrived at by this backwards

Sorry about that.

It\'s not a question of birthrates, but rather RELATIVE GROWTH rates.  It
doesn\'t take much difference in growth rates when you are talking over a
period of 2422 years.  Essentially, take the 2422th root of the relative
proportion of the two populations.  That gives you the relative growth
rate that the Solomani need to catch up.

If the initial Vilani population was 10,000 times as large, it is about
0.381% per year.  If the initial Vilani population was only 1,000 times
as large, it is less than 0.286% per year.  These seem like very small
numbers, but remember this is the RELATIVE growth rate and is yearly.

To find the Solomani birth rate, you must calculate the Vilani growth
rate (Vilani birth rate - Vilani death rate), then get the Solomani
growth rate (Vilani growth rate * 1.00381), then add the Solomani
death rate:

Solomani B.R. = (Vilani B.R. - Vilani D.R.) * 1.00381 + Solomani D.R.

You can calculate the death rates given average lifespans.  Simply
take the <lifespan>th root of 0.5 (and subtract from 1).  I don\'t
remember the average lifespan of a Vilani and a Solomani (and even if
I did, it needs to take into account wars and such), but lets take
a guess at a Solomani lifespan of 100 years and a Vilani lifespan of
250 years.  That leads to a Solomani death rate of 0.691% and a Vilani
death rate of 0.277%.  Overall, that means:

Solomani birth rate = Vilani birth rate * 1.00381 + 0.413%

(The way I did the calculations, specify all of the birth rates as
greater than 1.)

If the Vilani birth rate is 0.277% (1.00277), which would mean zero
population growth, the required Solomani birth rate would have to be
1.00277 * 1.00381 + 0.00413 = 1.01072, or 1.072% per year.  If you
raise that to the 100th power (lifespan) and subtract 1 for the
original (now dead) person, you will find that the average Solomani
will have 1.9 children (or 3.8 per couple) over their lifetime.
The average Vilani will have 1 child (2 per couple) in order to
maintain zero population growth, of course (which you also get if
you raise 1.00277 to the 250th power and subtract 1).

If there were only 1,000 times as many Vilani to start, the formula
would be:

Solomani birth rate = Vilani birth rate * 1.00286 + 0.413%

(the last term was only altered by 0.000263%)

Then, if the Vilani had zero population growth, the Solomani birth
rate would be 1.00277 * 1.00286 + 0.00413 = 1.00977, or 0.977% per
year.  The average Solomani would have 1.643 children (3.287 per
couple) over their lifetime.

You can play with the numbers to examine different scenarios.

A few things:

o The "average" lifespan I gave is probably way too high.  That
  might be the "average" lifespan for people to die of natural
  causes, but the real average might be much lower (especially
  for the Vilani who have more time to get killed).

o The Vilani would be more vulnerable to the effects of large-
  scale wars/plagues/etc. on their death rates, but then again
  the definition of large-scale would be different for them.

o I wouldn\'t even think about dealing with intermingling of the
  species.  It would be easier to define the higher birth rate
  as a "Solomani" trait and leave it at that.

        I have not felt the urge to call anyone on the TML/XBoat an
idiot for a long time now.  But this may be the time.
        In case you didn\'t notice, we have eight variables in this
process :
        1) Solomani birthrate
        2) Solomani lifespan
        3) Vilani birthrate
        4) Vilani lifespan
        5) time (number of years in consideration, in this case either
2400 or 3500)
        6) initial population of Solomani
        7) initial population of Vilani
        8) final population of VIlani/Solomani (50% each, therefore only
one number required).

        You very carefully specified approximate values for three of
these variables.  A fourth value can be obtained (with even less
certitude since only part of the Vilani/Solomani mix is inside the
Imperium where numbers are available.
        Which leaves four (or five) variables to solve for, and only
one equation (or two, if you choose to solve it that way).  In either
case, more variables than equations means that there are a large
number of possible solutions.  For instance, zero percent birthrate for
both Solomani and Vilani would result in equal numbers after 2400 
years, IF AND ONLY IF a lifespan is ASSUMED that is less than 2400 (or
3500) years.  And you didn\'t want to see assumptions...
        Or we can say that a Solomani birthrate of 30% per year (EVERY
fertile woman pregnant all the time) will allow parity in population
after 2400 (or 3500) years.  This is true as long as we make the
correct assumptions about Vilani birth/death rates and Solomani death
rate.  Which assumptions you didn\'t want...

        In that line, in order to give you what you asked for, my
conclusion (HAH!) is that Solomani birthrate must be 75% per year,
and Vilani birthrate must be 5% per year.
        There.  Real useful, isn\'t it?  Two totally meaningless
numbers that are absolutely uncheckable.  I doubt you could even
prove (from the numbers) whether I calculated them or pulled them
out of my arse.  I tell you now that I pulled them out of my arse,
BUT, I could, if I chose (and if anyone is interested, I will),
pick lifespans for Vilani and Solomani that make these birthrates
correct.  Still useless, but consistent...


gerald.s.williams:

        Not so acid with you, since what you said was entirely correct.
Mostly.  As to your conclusions:

        The numbers you chose are not consistent with the Traveller
Aging Tables.  Using them (the Aging Tables) for your baselines,
"average" Imperial lifespan (assumed to be Solomani or Solomani/
Vilani hybrid) is less than 70 years.  Average Vilani lifespan may
be as high as 200 years, based on Aging Tables and V&V.

        Only if you assume that low birthrate is "normal" for them.
There is no really good reason to believe that this is so.  Not much
reason to believe that it is not so, either, other than the fact
that, as you say, that would make them more vulnerable to large-scale
catastrophes.  And they\'ve been surviving large-scale catastrophes
for at least as long as we have...

        Intermingling would be a BITCH of a problem if you included
sociological factors (how likely is a young SOlomani guy/girl to want
a Vilani wife/husband), but is pretty straightforward if you ignore 
those factors (of course, the answer is probably pretty meaningless
if you ignore those factors, too).
        As to defining higher birthrate as a "Solomani" trait:
Doing so means that (given your numbers above) the Solomani 
achieved numerical parity about 1100 years in the "past".  It also
means that in 1100 (3I), the Solomani population would be a LOT higher
than the VIlani population (about 16 times as high), and getting higher
all the time...is this the picture you want?  Or are you making the 
(idiotic) assumption that the Solomani birthrate will be high
long enough to match the Vilani numbers, then will taper off to
ZPG?  If so, reread my first two lines of this post (the rude ones).

birth rates to catch the Solomani up to Vilani population levels.  In
recent years a period of plague among the Vilani has been added to explain
the rapid collapse of the First Imperium.  If one assumes die-back on the
order of the encounter between Europeans and the residents of the Americas
in the 100 years after 1492, one can get rid of 90% of the Vilani at a
stroke. 

In fact, the die-back would actually be much greater, unless we assume 
Solomani intervention with medical treatment.  First Imperium 
Vilani had primitive medical science, due to lack of animal models to 
work with - no genetically similar animals on the Vilani homeworld to 
experiment on.  Also, without animal vectors, many infectous diseases 
died out, so Vilani had no natural immunity.  I seem to remember some 
recent Traveller publications talking about the development of 
wide-spectrum anti-virals as the eventual solution by the Solomani, but I 
can\'t remember exactly where offhand.

Frankly, this one-time reduction of the Vilani population makes more sense
than some sort of long-term constant differential in birth rates, IMHO. 
Look at our own world, for example:  birth rates for Western Europe have
changed dramatically in the last two hundred years, first expanding and
then contracting.  Moreover, current rates vary from the high of some
African countries to the slightly negative rate of the former East
Germany.  Postulating a differential that persists over thousands, let 
alone hundreds of years, is a bit rash.

However, I could make an arguement that Vilani would have a birth rate 
that tended to replacement level.  Given the apprenticeship idea in 
Vilani society that you train to take over someone\'s job, even small 
positive or negative growth rates would soon throw the economy out of whack.

This whole discussion reminds me of how much Traveller reflects GDW\'s
origins in an academic environment and its early focus on wargames.  As a
professional historian, I enjoy seeing how Traveller has evolved over the
years from a one-dimensional space-opera background to a more
sophisticated product grounded in current historical (and other social
science) thinking.  The addition of the impact of disease I\'ve discussed
here is only one example; one can also point to the more sophisticated way
alien races are described and the expanded focus on economics.  One need
only compare the depictions of the Zhodani in early issues of the JTAS
(Evil Commie Mindsuckers with Turbans) to the Megatraveller version
(what do you mean, they\'re _happier_ than we are?) to see how much things
have changed.

Unfortunately, according to the Zhodani word generation tables, the
cluster "zdh" is impossible. Which leads to...

Maybe you could say it this way if you want an Anglic
accent. According to the tables, again, "zhd" (as well as "cht",
"sht", and "jd") are considered unbreakable consonant cluster by the
Zhodani. I thus think the syllabification is "pieb-zhde". One just has
to learn how to pronounce (and think of) things like "zhd" as single
consonants. Since I\'ve been looking at a lot of sector maps and other
Zhodani stuff lately, I have been walking around muttering things like
"Tiens-pev-nekr", "Echt-ovr Da-zhia", "Vlez-pridl-iashav", "Tavr-chedle\'",
and "Zhdant" under my breath, so I\'m beginning to see things this way.
(With the help of my psionic tutor, of course....)

Personally, I think it\'s likely the race calls themselves "Zhdani" -
natural if their homeworld is "Zhdant" - and the "o" gets stuck in by 
tounge-tied Imperials (especially Vilani native speakers, who can\'t
handle the vast majority of consonant clusters; but then, Vilani has
no "o", so they probably say "Shadani" with the first "a" a schwa).

I wonder who first called the Vilani homeworld "Vland"? Certainly not
speakers of High Vilani, who probably call it "Bilanid".

I also wonder if the GDW folks have generation tables for Vegan names
somewhere. (I was reading something about Hong Kong the other day and
I saw the name of one of its neighborhoods, "Tsimshatsui" -
immediately "Dzim Zhia Gwi" was called to mind. I think I\'ve been
looking at too much of this stuff lately.)

    I take it you are assuming that the Terrans were quite willing to ALLOW
their Vilani subjects to die by the BILLIONS?  You may assume that if you
wish, but I can\'t imagine a stable society built by a group that passively
encouraged such an act.   Also, I generally work on the assumption that 
the Terrans were the good guys.  That behaviour is not consistent with
"good guy" status...;-)

DGP\'s MT Solomani & Aslan (Rats & Cats for short :), has a couple of
paragraphs on psionics, in the New Game Rules for Aslan.  Briefly, 
they say that psionic potential is lower for Aslan, and any Psi 
Institutes in Aslan space will be proportionately less equipped.  
It is otherwise assumed that the list of Aslan psionic abilities can 
be derived from human abilities.
 
They list two minor clans that \'make regular use of psionics\'.  The 
Aslan Assassin profession can best utilize it.  Reading on, the Die 
Modifiers for age are heavily weighed against much useful ability.  
There is also an extra point cost penalty against other aliens.
 
I see a cultural bias, besides the physiological, against encouraging
psionics.  A few things could be said about mind reading versus the 
Aslan view of honor, but I\'m not trying to start a hotly debated

Actually, I was just trying to answer the original question about
what birthrates would be needed.  As you and I pointed out, it is
not quite so simple, but you can go through the math if you make
enough grossly oversimplifying (and probably wrong) assumptions.

Yes, I believe one of the side-effects of making a high birthrate
a Solomani trait is that the Solomani would eventually pass the
Vilani and leave them in the dust, so to speak.  Since the default
aging is given for Solomani or Solomani/Vilani descent, this may
even make sense.  There would still be pure-breed Vilani, of
course, but the Solomani numbers would eventually be higher, and
the Solomani-Vilani mixes would tend more towards Solomani.

Of course, genetics are not so simple, so that is possible (though
unlikely).  It is also possible that high birthrate is merely a
BEHAVIORAL trait (which I was trying to point out all along), in
which case anything is possible.

However, it is unreasonable to assume that the Vilani maintain a
zero population growth.  As you pointed out, they could never
recover from disasters that way.

Overall, I think I prefer the concept of some large-scale
disasters, coupled with a somewhat higher Solomani birth rate,
which perhaps could be attributed to a "colonize and populate"
attitude as opposed to a "status quo" attitude.

Well, Steve, look at that the other way around. We are told (in Rats&Cats,
I think) that during the Diaspora non-solomani humans across the empire 
were ravaged by germs brought by the Solomani and that on some worlds these 
plagues made the Solomani the majority. This is an official fact that we
have to deal with (unless you decide to ignore it, in which case we\'re not 
really talking GDW universe any more). But that dosen\'t mean that the 
Terrans callously let their Vilani neighbours die. The alternative
explanation is that they couldn\'t help it. The Solomani were undoubtedly
able to deal with those plagues that they were suceptible to, but there\'s
no reason to think that they would be prepared to deal with diseases that
were fatal to people without the Solomani immunity. There are diseases
today that we \'deal\' with by making sure that children catch them young.
It\'s true that TL 12 medicine is pretty advanced, but a small Solomani
settlers\' laboratory might not have the capacity to deal with massive 
plagues. 

(Incidentally, at some point during the Diaspora a Vilani doctor named 
Duskir created a wide-spectrum vaccine capable of handling these plagues
(and had the whole mess named after him for thanks), and after that new 
colonists would presumably carry this vaccine. But propably this vaccine 
could only handle _most_ plagues.

And finally, Steve, it\'s pretty simple of you to put a label like \'Good
Guys\' on a group of people the size of the population of the Terran
Confederation. Not like you at all...

Normally, I don\'t read the digests, since I get both instant and digest.  I
basically just notice that they go out.  But I just noticed what is going on
and I have tried to contact the postmaster at the site causing the problem.

Basically they are replying to the list and its bouncing and they keep replying to the list.  

> Will the digests be cleaned up and made available in the archives?

I don\'t know if I will have a chance to.  However if a volunteer wanted to 
grab the files cut the replys out, and mail them to me I would put them up
as an edited version.   :-)

    All this is true.
    I have a hard time believing in a 99+% die-back, though.  I
can\'t imagine ANY situation other than deliberately encouraging
the die-back with a death-rate that high...
    As to dealing with diseases that were fatal to people without
Solomani immunity, seems to me that a vaccine could be made from
the Solomani that would allow the development of that immunity 
in the locals.
    Note that "a small Solomani settlers\' laboratory" will not be
all that is present on a high-pop world.  And the high-pop worlds
are where the die-back must occur to lower Vilani populations to
be comparable to Solomani populations...
    I also don\'t believe that even the "official" history includes
the assumption that somewhere around nine trillion people died 
during the Second Imperium.  If it _does_ make that assumption,
then I WON\'T be talking the GDW universe any more...

    Yes, I was aware of that.  I guess I made the point primarily
for the people who might assume that your calculations would easily
solve the problem...

    To a major extent this is consistent with the Trav "history".
The only places it really fails the test are an assertion a LOOONG
time back that Solomani amounted to about 30% of the Imperium, 
with Vilani making up the rest.  Also the assumption that TL15
is as far as we get in 3700 years, which is not especially 
consistent with observed progress today...

    This is also a good point.  I apologise.  Certainly genetics
is not so simple as to allow one to make the blanket statement
that birthrates will be relatively unnaffected by external
factors (such as the total population of a given world)...

    I don\'t actually have too much problems with this theory,
BUT...
    Adaptability is necessary for survival.  If the Vilani 
could not adapt to the increasingly intrusive Terrans by increasing
their own growth rates (and chucking "status quo" out the window),
(if nothing else by increasing the number of tickets in the 
Birthright Lottery), then the Vilani are headed for extinction.

    Note that I have no real problem with pushing the Vilani in
the direction of extinction.  I don\'t really believe that it 
would happen that way (they are one of the three most successful
homan subspecies, after all), because if they were THAT vulnerable,
then they would have been taken out long before the present by
some other species (Vargr, for instance)...

almost 46,000,000,000 times while the Vilani population would have grown
less than 215,000 times (warning: I calculated this on a Pentium :-).
It\'s probably even worse than that, since the span between generations is
probably smaller, which would work to the Solomani\'s advantage.

In this case, plagues, wars, and such might actually work to the Vilanis\'
ADVANTAGE, since it would encourage them to have children young (those
that were inclined to have them later in life wouldn\'t get the chance).
You could also raise the average number of children per Vilani couple
until you got the number you wanted (if they have 4 children per couple,
the Vilani population would have grown almost 1,300,000,000 times in the
same 2422 years).

I think this might be a more logical way to look at things, since people
with longer lifespans don\'t necessarily have more children in their
lifetime (actually the reverse tends to be true on good-old 20th century
Earth).

And yes, this also means that the Solomani trait of a shorter lifespan
will tend to dominate and displace the "longevity gene" (or whatever).
Natural selection favors breeding, not living longer.

Not having Cats & Rats with me, I can\'t check this, but I seem to remember
that the Solomani used various sorts of artificial means to increase their
population during the Nth Interstellar Wars.  The implication was that they
used In Vitro fertilization of human ova, froze \'em, and then used...I
dunno, Birth Labs or some-such to grow a bunch of kids really quickly.

This sort of thing would be pretty far beyond the Vilani\'s pitiful medical
technology and would allow the Terrans to populate colony worlds pretty fast
(although trying to raise all the kids with only a handful of colonists
might have been awfully tricky -- I\'m not sure how such societies would
develop, but they\'d be fairly interesting...)

Can anybody verify this, or am I misremembering?

Well, it can get pretty bad.  The usual historical example is the
Spanish contact with the Central American natives in the 16th cent.
The pandemics of 1519 to the early 1520s were estimated at the time
to have mortality as high as 50% in places.  I\'ve seen figures as
high as 90% for the first century after contact.  And if Duskir were
something that hits like one of the more horrifying filoviri, all
bets are off.  Remedy this to some degree by a more modern Solomani
understanding of medicine -- after the first few years, things
may get more under control.

But Vilani microbiology was a bit backward, and the trained techs
and equipment needed might not be readily available.  Meanwhile,
the planet is dying....  The HiPop world might also be more densely
populated, making it harder to control spread of the plague.

Not necessarily.  There\'s some historical evidence that some 
diseases have lessened in severity over the historical time
frame, judging by Roman records among others.  One theory is that
a pathogen and its target might co-evolve in such a way that
the pathogen stops killing so many hosts.  Evolutionarily speaking,
it\'s to the agent\'s advantage that the host not die, but live
longer so that it can reproduce more.  And of course, hosts that
survive to reproduce get a chance to spread genes which helped
the host to survive the attack of the pathogen.  And the Vilani
have been separated from the Solomani since the time of the
Neanderthals.

Then there\'s things like toxic shock, and possible Vilani 
allergies to specific antibiotics that normally would work
fine.  This could be a problem if one of the bacteria is 
vulnerable to only one antibiotic.  (This is a very serious
concern today.  For various reasons, some bacteria are becoming
resistant to antibiotics -- a couple of previously easily
treatable diseases have developed strains which are treatable
with only one antibiotic.  The medical nightmare is if they
next become immune to *that* antibiotic, too.)

TD #20 talks about the Plague of Duskir, claiming that it was
a complex infection of yeasts, staph, various common digestive
bacteria, and VD.  This is similar to the New World infections.
They had problems with multiple infections of smallpox, measles,
influenza or typhus, diptheria, various fevers, and possibly 
the Black Death.  The fevers would weaken the victims, and then
a respiratory sickness like pneumonia would get them, in many
cases.

However...

TD #20 states clearly that the death toll was one billion, over
several thousand worlds.  Even with other plagues, this doesn\'t
seem to be in the order of magnitude necessary for the population
reduction folks.  Terran response was "swift".  Make your own

One billion or one trillion? If you killed one billion people
on Earth, today, aside from the huge mess, you\'d set us back less than
a century. Assuming even distribution of deaths, of course. A billion
people dying in North America would be a veeeery different story.

Did Solomani contact kill other populations en masse? Darrians makes no
mention of huge die-offs, which seems odd...

 Yes, 99+% is a bit high.  But I don\'t recall seeing anything that 
 presents even a strong implication that the dieback was in fact 
 this high, except perhaps in extremely localized areas.  Terra\'s 
 Black Death of the 1200s and 1300s (Solomani dating) _averaged_, 
 as I recall, about a 35% dieback in its area of effect, but 
 "locally", there were rates as high as 75%, and some towns were 
 wiped out completely.

 Yes, but how quickly can such a vaccine be developed?  
 Furthermore, what specific diseases are we talking about?  
 Influenza has been with us for centuries, and even so, it mutates 
 so quickly that the vaccine for any given year\'s variety always 
 comes out a week or two after people start catching it, and it\'s 
 still pretty severe.  How is it going to affect a population that 
 hasn\'t been culled by related strains?  How would this year\'s 
 version of the flu affect a population from, say, 200 years ago?  
 What about diseases that we have lived with from our animals for 
 centuries, and diseases related to them - cowpox/smallpox/chicken 
 pox, syphilis, and so on - how are they going to affect a 
 population that has not needed to build up an immunity?

 There are also the things that are simple allergies to Terrans 
 which might provoke a fatal reaction in populations that have 
 never encountered those substances.  Remember, the Vilani were in 
 effect "The Race In The Plastic Bubble" for most of their 
 existance.

 The more compatible a planet\'s biochemistry is with human 
 biochemistry, the more likely it is to produce diseases that will 
 affect humans, and which humans can build up an immunity to.  
 Terra is at one extreme of the scale - it is, after all, where 
 that human biochemistry developed.  Vland was probably pretty darn 
 close to the limit at the other end, where human life is possible 
 without high technology, but where the biochemistry has so little 
 compatibility that Vilani humans and Vilani germs basically ignore 
 each other.

 True; a Solomani settler\'s lab won\'t be there.  Probably, no 
 Solomani lab will be there at all until Solomani/Rule of Man 
 government officials notice that there\'s a bit of a problem with 
 disease.  Hell, for all I know, that might have been the proximate 
 cause of the collapse of the Rule of Man - the government was 
 overextended trying to combat plagues all over the place - plagues 
 that they brought themselves, and had no idea could have that kind 
 of effect.  Plagues like "the common cold", "chicken pox", 
 "mumps", "measles", etc. - anyone wanna include "Montezuma\'s 
 Revenge" in the list?

Solomani and Aslan does indeed describe GenAssist\'s solution to the
problems of insufficient populations on colony worlds:  
 
"[After contacting and fighting the Vilani,] [o]ur leaders saw the Vilani
greatly outnumbered us in both population and resources.  If we were to
compete with the Vilani in the long term, we must set up new colonies in
strategic locations and expand existing ones in all haste.
***
"GenAssist first sought to genetically alter Terran and alien life forms so
that food supply was not a problem.  Next, GenAssist sought to increase
the birth and growth rates of the colonists, expanding their populations in
record time.  Although our ancestors were eager colonists, most sought
to settle on habitable worlds.  Unfortunately, most worlds were not
suited for humans, but these same worlds often had the best resources for
a rapidly growing interstellar civilization.  Plus, we needed workers to
increase our productivity.
 
"Once again, GenAssist offered a solution.  Once established on a world
with a hostile environment, GenAssist set up \'artificial wombs\' producing
thousands of infants per year.  A staff of a few human and robot nurses
cared for these budding populations.  Others educated these new \'test-
tube\' colonists using tapes feeding the subconscious mind.  Using these
techniques, we could establish a fully productive, heavily populated
colony world in under twenty years."

Neither can I, but is 99% nessecary to explain how the Solomani caught up
with the Vilani? Do we need any single explanation? Couldn\'t it be a
combination of factors? Someone else proposed that the Solomani used
cloning to expand. I\'ve never seen any suggestion of that (as far as I
can recall) and certainly some Solomani groups wouldn\'t use it, but some
might. My genetics is pretty shaky, but what if the main Vilani 
characteristics (especially the long life) was recessive? Wouldn\'t that
make most of the descendents of a Solomani/Vilani offspring effectively
Solomani? Especially when combined with a tendency to ape the Solomani
culture.

There were no single plague but a lot of different ones. Duskir was the
researcher who came up with a broad-spectrum antibiotica that could
handle these plagues. This implies that such did not exist before,
regardless of what we think TL 12 meditech should be able to provide.
(Also, I think that such an antibiotica would only be able to handle
_most_ plagues).

But that\'s exactly my point. It _will_ be all that is present. The Vilani
medical tech level would be far below what was needed, so you can\'t use
them. The Vilani doctors and med-techs would not know what to do either.

>But Vilani microbiology was a bit backward, and the trained techs

Yup.

How fast? How many Solomani donors do you have? How many doses of vacchine
can your laboratory make per day? How many Vilani gets infected per day?
How many _different_ plagues do you have to deal with simultaneously? How
do you split the manufacturing capacity (Oh, the doctors in those day
must have had a fun time).

But it\'s one factor more to take into consideration.

Vilani-Sumerian matches? (I had this zany idea that, after the
Solomani conquest, the very Vilani-sounding name of the Terran hero
"Gilgamesh" (changed to "Gilugamesh") might become popular for Vilani
boys. Remember that the next time you meet a dark-haired man who goes
by "Gil" - he might not be "Gilbert".)

2) I was also thinking about the status of shugilii in modern Vilani
society. One might think that after the Terran contact the Vilani
would get hold of things like Terran rice and wheat, which are much 
more palatable than their "traditional" crops, and start growing them
for food. (The Vilani values of traditionalism and
resource-consciousness come into conflict here.) I can see modern
residents of Vland eating bread and rice much like we do today, and
the gourmet cuisine being the traditional foods (cared for in small
plots at great expense) with their nasty toxins leached out in the
traditional way. Think of blowfish eaters. I imagine a restaurant in
the AAB museum complex where the ordinary citizen can experience their
glorious culinary heritage.

Dear RPG Afficionado,
 
The MACROCOSM RPG development project is looking for kibbitzers.
 
MACROCOSM is the name of a new colossal role-playing game system
currently under development.  It shall be multi-genre in nature,
with a central rules system that shall be applicable to campaigns
of almost any type.  Several campaigns are being developed for
the system, each of which can be crossed with the others or used
independently as standalone campaigns.  "Hard" sci-fi,
multi-dimensional interloping, twisted parallel universes, and
magical fantasy are examples of campaigns under development for
MACROCOSM.
 
MACROCOSM has three defining characteristics:
 
    1)  We\'ve gathered together some of the most creative writers
    in the industry.  The result is shaping into a family of
    imaginative campaigns that will capture and keep the
    attention of referees and players alike.  The backgrounds are
    so vivid that they almost come to life!  Come and explore the
    frontiers of adventure.  Venture out into the MACROCOSM.
 
    2)  We are taking advantage of high technology and are
    applying it to enhance the role-playing experience.
    Macrocosm is being designed to be displayed on computer
    screen.  It shall include powerful features to provide easy
    access to the information it contains.
 
    3)  We are going all out to learn what YOU the gamer want in
    a new RPG, what you like and dislike about existing games,
    and what features and characteristics you wish current games
    had but don\'t.  Gamer input is resulting in a MAJOR
    refinement of the rule conventions and systems used to
    administer role-playing activity.  Thus, Macrocosm shall
    represent a new generation in RPG advancement!
 
"Kibbitzer" is the name which our development team has
affectionately given to MACROCOSM team members responsible for
proofreading, playtesting, and commenting/participating in design
discussions.
 
If you would like to become a kibbitzer for the MACROCOSM RPG
development project, please let me know.
 
Sincerely,
Roger Sanger,
aka Hyperodge
 
 
P.S.:  HyperDynamics, Macrocosm\'s sister project, is seeking
programmers interested in state-of-the-art hypertext and
node-processing software development.  If you are a programmer
with some spare time to invest, by all means, drop me a note.
The project has nearly completed its first program, and is
preparing to start development of additions to the product line.

        Actually, there is little evidence that long lifespan
has much to do with number of children.  There\'s a lot of
evidence that wealth has a lot to do with number of children.
        And, of course, wealth and long life are usually

        It certainly does.  It also favours numbers.  And the
Vilani have the numbers.

        50% isn\'t really any worse than the black plague in
Europe.  And if you were to kill every other Vilani, then they
would outnumber the Solomani by only 500 to 1...

        Vilani microbiology may be backward COMPARED to the
Terrans, but it isn\'t really very backward.  Keep in mind the
basic principles of vaccination was developed empirically.  Keep
in mind that the Vilani had thousands of ecologies to study in
the millenia before the Terrans even thought about space travel...

        And I would hope that the the HiPop worlds are more
densely populated...:-)
        But, by the same notion, the HiPop world have more
resources to deal with plagues, both scientific and industrial...

        And new diseases appear all the time.  So?  The Vilani
took Terran microbiology (their intestinal bacteria, if nothing
else) along with them, just like every other subset of humanity
taken by the Ancients.
        The Vilani had 300,000 years for the evolution of new,
improved diseases, so they should have had some disease
resistance...

        <snicker!>  The Vilani, like every other official variant
of humanity transplanted by the Ancients, has been separated
since the time of Homo Erectus.  Neanderthal came along almost
200,000 years after the Vilani were separated...

        a billion!?!  Is THAT all?  A billion people dying of
plagues in the Vilani Imperium is roughly comparable (10 deaths per
100,000) to the losses on Terra during the Influenza epidemic of
1919...it\'s peanuts! :-)


Glenn:

        Interesting, but not really applicable to the period AFTER
the conquest of the Vilani Imperium.  It does imply that the base
Terran population at the beginning of the Second Imperium may have
been considerably higher than 10 billion, though.
        On the other hand, colonization of resource worlds should
require millions of people, but not billions.  So it may not mean
that GenAssist built multi-billion person colonies.  They are more
likely to have built colonies in the 10 million range...
        On the other hand, it implies that the Terrans may be MUCH
more numerous out on the Rim than I expected.  I have long since
assumed a HUGE "Solomani" population rimward of the Solomani
Confederation.  It may be even huger than I thought...:-)

        99% means that the Vilani outnumber the Terrans by a factor
of ten.  90% means that there are still 100 Vilani per Terran.  You
figure it out.


> Do we need any single explanation?

        No.  As long as the total of ALL the explanations adds up

        Sure.  But all of them will be disasters that make the
"Rebellion" look like a tea-party, frankly...

        What a concept!  All their traits are recessive!  How likely
is it that if you sample a poppulation, that everyone in your
sample will have all recessive traits with respect to the general
population?


> Wouldn\'t that make most of the descendents of a Solomani/Vilani
> offspring effectively Solomani?

        Let\'s see.  If we assume that the Solomani make up 1% of
the general population, and assume that the VIlani long-life gene
is both representative and recessive.  Let us further assume that
interbreeding is purely random (race is not considered at all in
choosing mates).  Let us look at the population after, say, 12
(picked randommly, I assure you, I have no idea where the numbers
will end up as I type this) generations down the line...

        We will have essentially three groups then:

        "pureblood Vilani" (anyone with the long-life gene
reinforced);
        "mixed blood Solomani" (anyone with ONE (and ONLY one
sample of the long-life gene - effectively Solomani);
        "pureblood Terran" (anyone without any long-life genes
- effectively Solomani);

        The three groups will be represented in the following
percentages:

        Pureblood Vilani:     98.01%
        Mixed blood Solomani:  1.98%
        Pureblood Solomani:    0.01%

        Effectively 98% Vilani and 2% Solomani...

        Surprising.  I would have expected a drift away from the
2nd generation numbers...probably happened because there was not
an assigned "lethality rate", that is, no tendency for any of the
three groups to reproduce with any less frequency than any other.
        In any case, we seem to have a stable situation where,
for all intents and purposes, "Vilani" equals the percentage of
the original Vilani population squared.  So 90% Vilani means a
stable population that is 81% "Vilani", a 99.9% Vilani base
means a stable population of 99.8% "Vilani"...

        Now, this may mean that I have to re-evaluate my initial
position.  These numbers (assuming I did them right, anyway, and
assuming that simplification was not carried to an unnatural
extreme) imply that the "official" position could be reasonably
close to correct given a marginally higher Terran birthrate plus
an initial population no less than 10% of the Vilani population.
        Note that a 10% initial Terran population implies that
the Vilani must have had a stable population (over 10,000 worlds
and 10,000 years) no more than one trillion.  It also implies
that the Terrans used fairly extensive cloning to increase their
own base population.  Neither of these is really too far out to
lunch for me to buy into (and justify to myself) though...


> Especially when combined with a tendency to ape the Solomani

        Unfortunately, I cannot buy into the assumption that the
culture has much to do with the genetic mix.  Though I concede
that this could produce a whole bunch of "Jones families" whose
name in the old country was unpronouncable...:-)

        HOWEVER.  Note that the assumption used here is rather
bizarre.  I can buy the idea that long-life is a recessive
trait, but not that EVERYTHING Vilani (or even MOST Vilani
traits) is recessive.  Note that the above conclusions change to

        Pureblood Vilani:     98.01%
        Mixed blood VILANI:    1.98%
        Pureblood Solomani:    0.01%

        which is 99.99% Vilani and 0.01% Solomani, if the Vilani
are no more likely than the Terrans were to have recessive genes.


        Given that we assume that MOST of the IMPORTANT differences
between Solomani and Vilani are recessive traits that confer
neither advantage nor disadvantage on reproductive/survival
probablility, then we can assume that the original GDW picture is
reasonably correct, IFF we can assume that there were very few
Vilani (compared to what would be expected given the number of
worlds occupied), and that there were rather more Terrans than one
might expect...
        Note, though, that almost all the "Solomani" will look
rather more Vilani than not.  Only a very small number of the
"Solomani" will actually look like pure-blooded Terrans.  Even
assuming we can speak meaningfully of "looking Terran", or
"looking Vilani".  Which I doubt...

        But without 99+% dieback among the Vilani, the Vilani
genes will dominate the genepool of 1100 3I...

        Doesn\'t much matter.  99+% dieback is going to make the
Rebellion/Hard Times look tame.  And without it, one has a fairly
hard time explaining the Terrans as a dominant factor in the
Imperium...

        By the same token, the reverse is probably true.  Allergic
reactions by Terrans is as likely as allergic reactions by
Vilani.  And the assumption that the Vilani have never had to
deal with diseases before the arrival of the Terrans is ludicrous.
After all, there were 30-odd other worlds encountered with Human
populations.  SUrely SOME of those populations introduced unknown
diseases into the Vilani scene.  Just as the Vilani intestinal
bacteria must surely have mutated (at least ONCE) into something
unpleasant...

        Which implies that MOST worlds colonized by the VIlani were
more terrestrial, and therefore likely to introduce unpleasant
diseases to the Vilani.  And this has been going on for 10,000
years, guys...

        Do they not have a hospital in your town?  Hell, we have
large, well-funded hospitals and associated labs on every other
street corner around here...;-)
        Why do you assume that the Terran colonists would go to
a world without taking along enough medical types to take care
of them.  Or did they trust the Vilani? <snicker>

        Well, no.

        Nine trillion is 90% of ten trillion, which is a not too
unreasonable estimate of the population of the Vilani Imperium.  If
a 99+% dieback is postulated, then the total deaths are on the
general order of nine trillion people.  Actually, ten trillion is
closer, but let\'s be nice and call it nine trillion, eh? :-)

        This looks like a good time to end this thread.  I concede
that with a little work, we can justify the GDW picture.  I don\'t
actually consider the required conditions very likely, but I don\'t
really have too much problem with "unlikely" things happening
now and then.  So, I guess this is my way of saying that no matter
what else is said on the subject, I am done now....:-)

Not as far as I know.  The problem with such systems is that they tend to
produce humans-in-rubber-suits instead of real aliens.  Formula systems
yield results within the constraints of the formulas, while aliens are
supposed
to be exotic.

Yeah, you just have to get those creative juices flowing.  If you need some
sort of random inspiration to get started, maybe you could try making up
a suitably chosen random animal using the animal generation rules, and then
evolve it to intelligence.  Using MegaTraveller, you can even convert the
animal\'s "hits" to approximate physical stats (life force vs. hits, in the
first bit of the Combat section).  For particularly large aliens (such as
K\'kree or Virushi), you might need to expand the table beyond it\'s upper
limit in order to make appropriate estimates of alien physical UPPs, since
it is expecting humans, I think.  But you need to do most of the tough
work with your imagination.

    I didn\'t know that I WAS adding control-Z\'s to my files.  Perhaps that

JSHiggin: 
In a piece of mail in the XBOAT digest 123, I noted you talking about the 
\'huge\' Solomani population to Rimward...  Here\'s the latest (well, I note 
that no one else knows about it....! so it must be the latest - even if 
my HIWG stuff was written 2 years ago plus)

Back in the good ol days of HIWG - I am not familirar with it now,., I 
did an article on the Solomani population to rimward of the Solomai Rim 
sector...

Basically I based the discussion on a section of text out of one of the 
LIbrary entries about the proportion of population compared with 
Vilani....  I then counted the total number of HiPop worlds in the 
Imperium (out of the Atlas) and came up with a total High POP worlds that 
must exist in the Solomani sphere.  I then back tracked to work out how 
many must be off the map in the Atlas.

The density of HiPop worlds was equal to or in excess of the density 
present in the Solomani Rim sector!!!! 

If you have a copy of the Atlas handy take a look at that one page....  
The number of worlds named (Hi Pop) is _IMMENSE_...  To realise that the 
rest or the Solomani sphere, to rimward of that covered by the Atlas (3 
sectors centred on Solomani Rim), is this dense in all of the three other 
sectors is mind boggling to me!!

It has several times encouraged me to make a \'large scale strategic\' game 
using this fact and seeing how the total industrial output of the 
Solomani - in such a small region of space (6 sectors is small cf Vilani 
25+).  Interesting results...I\'d say that the Solomani could easily 
attack and occupy, controlling, upto two or three sectors into the 3rd 
Imperium.

If you get the chance look up a document index on the Solomani articles 
with HIWG.  You should find mine in there somewhere - surname BOOL, don\'t 
remember my membership number.

Anyway...happy hunting...back to work!

    I suspect that you should have raised the average pop of Solomani
HiPop worlds, rather than run up that many.  Or maybe not...hmmm...

    I do.  I will.  Thanks...

    Not to me.  What passes for political thought about the Third
Imperium sort of implies that the Solomani are immensely populous,
and immensely rich (on average, TLs should be higher, so per capita
wealth should be higher than the Imperium...) compared to the 
Third Imperium...

    If you ever decide to try it, let me know.  I\'d be interested in
both the game (simulation) itself, and the results of a few dozen
trials...;-)

    I\'d guess more than that.  But then, I think more highly of the
Terrans than I do of the Vilani...

    Where?  I never bothered to write down the location of the HIWG
archives....

Does anyone here have an idea on how Holiday (001-XXXX) is celebrated in 
the Imperium?  Besides the Holiday Honor\'s list, that is...

And about the Solomani Confederation\'s version of Holiday, Christmas 
(celebrated by nearly all Solomani - Christian or not - for the last 3000 
years)... does anyone here have an idea on how it would be celebrated?
Would it be - as always - an occasion to exchange gift\'s and wish for 
galatic peace?  What new twists on the non-Christian legends would be 
added? (Santa Claus lives in jumpspace?  Present\'s left in airlocks, 
rather than chimmey\'s?  Or something completely new?)

A lllong time ago, I posted something on the culture of the Imperium, and 
one fellow said that the only people/things known Imperium-wide would be 
rock stars and major political leaders.

Well, I wonder.  In aristocratic cultures, the \'tone\' of the society 
would tend to favour the nobility\'s interests, if only because they 
control the big money and act as patrons to the arts.  Art, therefore, 
would tend to be more elegant, stylized and subtle, rather than brash and 
vigourous (ie. 17th century Europe vs. 20th century America).  So I would 
suspect that forms of opera (live, VR, or televised) would be the most popular 
form of entertainment... moreover, that this opera would be layered with 
signals and signs that derive form the older Vilani civilization.  Think 
Chinese opera, or Noh (Japanese) opera, both from ancient civilizations.

So where would the rock music come from?  Well, interestingly, if you 
mean modern rock music, the examples that survive the Long Night would be 
as revered and lovingly protected (with _real_ Solomani singers of 
N.American desent in a _real_ LSD haze, made the same way as 4000 years 
ago!) 

If you mean the thumping beat, crash-bang, \'youth revolution\' attitude... 
well, such revolutions only go with the revolt of comparatively wealthy 
children (ie. white middle-class Americans) in democratic societies.  
Most societies in the Imperium are non-democratic, and the society as a 
whole is an aristocratic bureaucracy.  Moreover, with neo-fuedalism, 
wealth is centralized in the hands of a few truly powerful families (I 
suspect there are about 10,000 high-noble families in the Imperium, who 
together own 50% of all Imperial wealth... ), who value stability and 
continuity, not revolutions.  And remember that the basic gestalt of the 
Imperium is a Vilani society with a large minority of "Conquerors" in 
high positions, rather than a high-tech society settling in a rich but 
(largely) empty land.  (For the first 600 years of Imperial history, the 
Imperial Line was pure-blood Solomani, for crying out loud.)

If you believe that most of the Imperium is pure-blood Vilani with a 
sprinkling of Solomani, the best model may be the Ming Empire, where a 
small minority of invaders rule over a vast and ancient culture.  Both 
sides would place high value on ancient culture, but for different 
reasons. (The Solomani for prestige, propaganda, and to restore some 
pride verses the Vilani... the Vilani to underline their superior, 
civilized nature vs. the Solomani barbarians.)  Interesting, Solomani Rock 
Music would transmigify from a banner of the sexual revolution to a 
banner of Solomani warrior\'s!  An interesting development... 


If, in contrast, you believe in a near equal split between Vilani and 
Solomani, _and_ assume that the Solomani always love to press the 
boundary\'s (I thing that this is the offical GDW Imperium), there would 
be less formal, stylized music and cultures (though they would still 
dominate), and more openings for "rebellious youth" culture\'s, great sea 
changes in public attitudes, and the iron grip of Tradition would be 
weakened, though still greater than today.  Perhaps Europe between the 
discovery of the America\'s (1492) but before the French Revolution (1783) is 
the best model of this society.  

[I favour this viewpoint... it would allow for a Dulinor, who not only 
wanted the Throne, but to totally rebuild the Imperium.  It would also 
account for the continued allegance of many billions to the mad Lucan] 

Of course, in both instances these are rather general gudelines, with 
lots of flexibility when it comes to individual worlds.  


Alvin Plummer
(Among the Solomani Conquers!)

P.S. And about those 10,000 families who own 50% of Imperial wealth... 
     
With THAT kind of wealth, it\'s likely that they form the backbone of 
Imperial society, and have final say on what - or what doesn\'t - happen 
in it.  NOT the academic\'s, who serve them.  NOT the Megacorps, which are 
owned and controlled by these people.  The Imperial Navy may have a real say
on what happens, but is \'a step behind\', if you will, to the high nobility.
And there are no Imperium-wide religions to challange these pepole, 
although there _is_ an ideology that can fight them off... the 
"Rule-of-Man" belief.

Hi,
I promised a while back I\'d post a short note on Zhodani combat armor
relating to the Zhodani NPC, Piebzhde-atl, that I\'d posted earlier.
(Xboat digest 107) This information comes almost totally from CT Aliens
Module 4, Zhodani. I won\'t post the whole thing which should keep me safe
on copyright grounds. If you can find a copy, it\'s interesting, but not
up to the quality of the MT Alien books, I\'m led to believe. As far
as I know though, it\'s the only big source of Zhodani information,
with Expedition to Zhodane containing only a subset of the info
therein (no news for you people who have all this stuff).

Anyway, to quote the opening paragraph on Zhodani combat armor,
"One of the most distinctive and characteristic pieces of Zhodani
equipment is the ever-present Zhodani-style combat armor.
Recognizable by its clamshell helmet (which splits down the center to
open), Zhodani combat armor is a standard issue piece of military
equipment found in nearly every Zhodani military unit."

The immediate implication of this is that Piebzhde is well advised
not to take it out of the well-locked box he keeps it in if he\'s in
the Marches and looking to keep his life. He avoids wearing it in
general and due to its difficulty to put on, only wears it knowing
he\'s going into combat and won\'t be seen by very many people. People
who are going to live, that is. If necessary, he can make a
telepathic assault to wipe the memory of anyone who sees him in it.

His set of armor is standard guards model armor. It provides
protection per the combat armor column in the combat tables and can
function as a vacc suit for short periods of time. To quote, "Guards
armor is a specially produced model which has been designed and
tested for its ability to enhance (or not hinder) psionic activity.
Its mass and bulk has been reduced to provide the least hindrance to
teleportation." The armor also contains psionic shielding which can
be de/activated psionically. The glove palms can be removed for
activities that require direct contact. It has a multi-channel
communicator capable of handling 5 channels with a 50km range.

The armor also has the following built-in capabilities:
 - Filter for tainted atmospheres
 - switchable IR/Image Enhancement faceplate.
    (Image Enhancement as per all those green nightime CNN shots)
 - Chameleon Surface (prevents IR detection)
 - Magnetic boot soles (for zero-g operations)
 - external sensors (temperature, atmosphere, pressure, etc)

The armor has a base weight of 6kg. (miracles of technology, eh?)

Piebzhde also carries several several attachments which can be
fitted quickly (< 5 minutes) if need be:
 - Oxygen tanks good for up to 6 hours (5kg)
 - grav pack (as per a grav belt) (10kg, when off)
   (the grav pack is good for about 2 hours without an extra
    powerpack)
 - holo display computer (allows computer generated heads-up display
    in the helmet; 2kg belt module)

If the referee is feeling especially over-zealous, the armour is also
available as battle dress, doubling the wearer\'s strength and giving
unlimited endurance (but not for combat hits). This raises the base
weight to 22kg.

You may think "This is sheer overkill munchkinism!", but it isn\'t
necessarily so. Piebzhde doesn\'t exactly wear the armor to do
everyday tasks like going to the bathroom. It takes 3 minutes under
the best conditions to put on (for him). Under adverse conditions (or
if someone else is trying to put it on) it can take 5 or more
minutes.  (This may not seem like long, but when you\'re under fire, I
figure 5 minutes is 4 minutes and 59 seconds too long). Piebzhde isn\'t
a mercenary, he is an intelligence officer. He won\'t wear the armor
anywhere he thinks there\'s Imperial troops who have been through more
than a day of basic training. Generally speaking, Solomani troops
aren\'t briefed on Zhodani soldiers and tactics - after all, why would
they be? Piebzhde isn\'t too cautious about showing friendly PCs his
armor, especially if he knows he will be with them a while to give
him an opportunity to wipe their memories.

The armor is Piebzdhe\'s insurance to make sure he doesn\'t get stuck
in any nasty situations. He will always try to make sure the trunk he
keeps it in is easily accessible (and locked). He will also go to
long lengths to recover it if lost. He most certainly not let a PC
borrow it.

That\'s, uh, it, in a rather large nutshell.


On an unrelated note, I got a copy of K\'kree and the cover is
unstapled on it, but even wierder, on the back, in the write up it
says "K\'kree, Traveller Alien Module 1", but on the front in a big
title, it says "TRAVELLER Alien Module 2". Whoops.

	When the characters don\'t know the language I usually
make them try to communicate with grunts and hand-waving. Where
they might have some knowledge or some commonality I restrict
them to the number of syllables they might use.
	For example, if they have started a language course
in Scout (Scout, Navy, Merchant, and Army are all seperate
languages in my universe) they might be able to communicate
in that in works of one syllable. When they have, say,
Scout-0, skill level I let them use two syllables, etc.

	I disagree totally. Automated translation is 
currently in its infancy (Guess what the branch of my
company that I work for does: translation! Guess something
we\'re very interested in: translation software!) however
it is improving and as the capacity for storage and
processing improves it will rise to an acceptable level.
But *only* for written matter! With current technology
we can barely interpret speech. Suppose we bridge that
gap, then we can pipe the output through our textual
translators.
	This, however, has many drawbacks. The amount of
information conveyed by tone is huge. Not only that but
in spoken language we use coloquialisms or shortcuts
*all* the time. Written language tends to be a bit more
formal. Believe me, I am very concious of this. I frequently
have to deal with people whose English skills are not that
of a native and I have to be very careful about the language
I use so that I can be understood.

	In my Traveller campaign the characters had a
read/write lead attached to their optic and aural nerves.
They could plug this into a hand computer. One of them
spent some time configuring their translation software
so that it would scan the incoming image/wave, identify
it by language, and then overlay the translation to the
brain. Pretty cool, but not always 100% accurate...

Although there will be traditional art forms -- and with no 
revolutions, wars and invasions for centuries, that\'s going to be 
a loooong unbroken artistic tradition --  existing alongside them 
will be a popular culture driven by fashion. If it is rich enough, 
every society, no matter how conservative, will have its fads and 
fashions come and go. Twentieth century Solomani music one decade, 
Vegan nose yoddeling the next.....Since everything that goes out 
of fashion eventually becomes fashionable again, we might see this 
cycle repeat itself again and again over the centuries (a thirty 
year cycle, like the Schlesinger cycle in politics?)

Would these fashions extend across the whole Imperium, I wonder? 
And if so, how quickly would they propagate?

Rock music has only been around for the last few decades, so it\'s 
hard to predict how it will survive into the future. But the 
Vilani (if they\'re out there listening now), with their love of 
continuity and tradition, would surely approve of the Rolling 
Stones still touring after thirty years, and showing no signs of 
stopping. In one of our campaigns -- the 1120 tour of the Spinward 
Marches by the psychastro rock band Battle Damage -- the band had 
been touring for over a century, although, not surprisingly, none 
of the founder line-up remained.

And with the nobles owning most of Makhidkarun, and presumably the 
other media giants, you can bet that coverage of their lifestyles 
wouldn\'t be of the Charles and Di squidgygate variety.

The interesting thing about fashions in the Imperium, as well as music 
and other cultural traits is the time lag in communications. A fashion 
would appear in one area and begin propagating at the speed of jump. Very 
\'hot\' or highly promoted material would be spread faster than a less-well 
publicized fashion would. 
	This raises two issues, context and mutation. Two ideas which 
arise in the same place and time would not neccessarily be communicated 
at the same rate. So culture would be out of touch with continuity, in 
fact causality in a sociological sense would break down.
	Further complicating the issue is retransmision. If a wave of 
fashion is altered by a subculture before being passed along the lines of 
communication then culture becomes more heterogeneous as the distance 
from cultural centers increases.
	As a sociological study, the 3rd Imperium is fascinating.

	Like, radical dude. We got chicks going around with
clogs from the 1970s and chizzlers with haircuts from the

	The Villani Department of Cultural Preservation is pleased
to announce that after thirty years of deliberation the Cultural
Presentation Subcommittee of Cultural Artefacts Committee of the
Department of Music - Plutonium Rock, has come forward with a plan
to thaw from its low berth archives *Nick\'s Law* and present them
for their 800th anniversary.
	Nick\'s Law was a radical band from the early 300s that refined
the Plutonium Rock substratum of music expressing many of its
quintesential qualities as defined by the Department of Music - 
Plutonium Rock. The band was siezed a few years after their formation
under the 197 Cultural Perservation Act as representative of
the Culture of the Vilani People and thus property of the
Government.
	They have since been revived on six occasions to do whirlwind
tours of the Dagushag sector and record "More of the Same, 200 years
after" which topped charts in 597, 823 and most recently in 1023.
	The band\'s legal firm was been trying, so far unsuccessfully.
to retreive a share of the profits from sales while the band has
been in statis but that is not expected to overshadow this
momentous occasion. Other elements in the media have commented that
it was, perhaps, inappropriate to revive them at this time as the
already planned revival of the Pulmmera Concerato has gone ahead and
there are some fears that this will detract from the occasion.

More from my great pile of two-centicredit coins...

A: Pyrric Wars


   From my partial grip on history, my classification of \'good/bad\' wars 
can be cut down to this...

1) Good Wars - wars being fought to prevent mass enslavement, rapine, theft,
               or murder.  
Examples: the Allies in World War II, the American side in the Cold War, 
          the Chinese against the Mongol hordes, etc.

2) Political Wars - wars fought to further politics ends.

Examples: The several dozen \'bushfire\' wars fought by the British to 
          build their Empire, the Mexican-American war, the (Second) Gulf 
          War.  The vast majority of wars can be classified under this 
          heading.

3) Religious (Ideological) Wars - wars fought to promote a single 
          ideology or religion.  
Examples: The Crusades, the First Jihad (??? what do the Muslims call that 
          massive Islamic campagin in the first hundred years of Islam\'s 
          history ???), several Judean wars, the Communist wars.

[Q: Does the anti-psionic attitudes of the Imperium clasify the Frontier 
    Wars as Ideological?  
 A: Perhaps the later (post-Suppression) wars, from the Imperium side.  
    However, the Zhodani Consulate fought these wars strictly from a Political
    basis.

 Q: How about the Rim War?
 A: Yes.  According to canon Traveller, the war was started by the Imperium 
    because of mistreatment of non-human minorities (esp. the Vegans) by 
    the Solomani.  ]
    
4) Evil Wars - wars fought for the sake of mass enslavement, rapine, 
          theft, and murder. 
Examples: The Russian Revolution (from Stalin on), World War II (the Nazi\'s).

5) Pyrric Wars - wars that shouldn\'t be fought, as the price of fighting 
          it - even the price of victory - is far too steep to pay.
Examples: World War One, Vietnam; the Second Civil War in _Traveller_ 
          history. 

Note: distinctions can most certainly be blurred in real life.


So much for preamble. 
My question is: how can an interstellar society (or any society) tell the 
difference between a Pyrric War and either a Good War or a Political War?

For my purposes, a Pyrric War is not neccessarily a war that cannot be 
won. After all, even if the British were absolutely certain to lose to the 
Nazi\'s, they should still have fought against them.  I mean a war that, 
if fought, would only cause great grief, pain, and sorrow for a victory 
unworthy of the price paid for it.

Incidentally, at what point in the Final War should the combatants 
realized that victory is either unattainable or not worth the price, and 
organized a general ceasefire?

----

B: Interstellar strategy

In my own private universe, a largely TL C government (Gov1), about a 
sector in size, is planning to attack another gov\'t at TL E-F (Gov2).  
Assuming that the war is  - certain to happen in 10 years
                          - unavoidable
                          - basically Political, with Ideological (racial)
                            overtones
What advise would you give Gov1?

Statistics: 
Gov1 has about 150% the people of Gov2
Gov1 is about a sector in size, but Gov2 is about a sector and a half
Gov1\'s population is evenly spread out compared to Gov2, which have two 
     \'high-pop areas\' and vast areas of low-pop and no-pop systems.
Both governments have existed for about 900 years; Gov1 was more powerful 
     for the first 400 years, Gov2 since then. 
Gov1 is primarily TL C, but has high-pop systems from TL A to TL F.
     Gov2 is primarily TL E, with systems ranging from TL D to TL F.
There is a large buffer state between them, about 2 subsectors in size, 
     at TL D-F.  An ally of Gov1, but more like U.S./Japan rather than 
     U.S./Britain.  It has no love for Gov2, but does not wish to commit 
     it\'s limited forces unless certain of victory.  Moreover, it does 
     not fully trust Gov1.

Gov1 is a unitary state, Gov2 is more like a federation of nations.

So far, the only thing that I have come up with is that Gov1 should focus 
on maximising their (relatively recent) TL F capasity for electronic 
warfare, to provide an element of equality when it comes to sensors, 
decoys, etc.

Moreover, I want to leverage the numerical superority of Gov1\'s navy, but 
how?

Yeesh.  Tricky one.  In TNE (for combat etc, BL/BR, FFS) you\'ll have a few 
problems, but they\'re not too bad to solve (I\'m having similar problems making
the Zho forces I\'m designing a reasonable threat against the Imperials (since
they are *supposed* to be a threat).  One thing is to remember that the 
"standard" turrets and barbettes, don\'t always make sense (the sizes seem to be
an arbitrary choice) at lower TLs.  TL E turrets would be bigger if it was 
needed to give them a resonable shot against their higher TL ememy.

Also, fusion rockets instead of HEPlaRs will give an increase in fuel efficiency
(I was thinking of having them improve above TL B since power plants do (and
dampers show up then)... They\'d be easier to spot on passives, though, I bet.

Does government 1 *care* about getting all the gov2 worlds intact?  If it is
indeed a war against ideological enemies, throwing rocks at them at a couple
hundred km/sec would be a possiblity...  their ships get killed fast, but if 
even one gets through...

The possibility of non-traditional (in the CT sense) rules of engagement
could
be interesting.  

What side do you want to win?  :)

	..........Hynes follows what he calls "the trend line\' in 
antimatter production, much as a technical analyst follows a stock\'s 
performance on Wall Street. "We started producing p-bars in 1955 --sixty 
of them when they were first discovered.  . . .  The slope of the trend 
line now is about an order of magnitude every two-and-a-half years.  If 
you extrapolate to the future, we\'ll produce about a gram in 2007.

	"Now, a gram of antiprotons is about 6 X 10(23) p-bars, and that 
represents a substantial amount of energy-- about six megawatt-years.\'
Why so much?  Antiproton-proton annihilation releases far more energy 
per gram of material than either nuclear fission or fusion. In fission, 
using uranium or plutonium, the amount of mass converted is a mere parts 
per thousand.  In fusion, using hydrogen or deuterium, the fraction is 
almost one percent; that\'s why a hydrogen bomb is so much more powerful 
than a fission bomb.  But in antimatter annihilation, the amount is 100 
percent.

Costly antimatter

	That fantastic energy potential is undoubtedly what has given 
rise to speculation about antimatter bombs.  But any time I mentioned 
the possibility to physicists who are involved with antimatter, the 
notion was met with ridicule because of the enormous cost of generating 
antimatter, the difficulties in handling it, and the fact that it would 
make a "lousy\' bomb. The nature of the explosion is not a bang, says one 
physicist, but a "poom.\'

	"An antimatter bomb of twenty kilotons yield, the same size as 
the Hiroshima bomb, would probably cost at least $10 billion, about one 
percent of the national budget,\' says Robert L. Forward.  "You\'d go 
broke trying to destroy an enemy with them, and they wouldn\'t even make 
good bombs.\'

 	Forward is a senior scientist at the Hughes Research 
Laboratories in Malibu, Calif., high in the hills overlooking Malibu 
beach and the Pacific Ocean. He is an impressive figure, tall and 
portly, with a mop of pure white hair. When I met him, he was 
resplendent in a white-on-white shirt, white-on-white bow tie, and a 
vest striped in many more colors than are in the spectrum. His career 
has been equally multifaceted, ranging, in 31 years, from gravity
wave detectors (a design he worked on is in the Smithsonian Institution, 
in Washington, D.C.) to space science.

Antimatter rockets

	If antimatter doesn\'t make sense for bombs, Forward says, it 
does make sense for something else:  space propulsion.  The reason is 
the ferocious cost of getting any kind of fuel into orbit, even low 
Earth orbit.
	"It costs up to $5 million a ton to lift the fuel into space, 
beyond what it costs to manufacture.  And a milligram of antimatter will 
replace something on the order of twelve tons of the best chemical fuels 
we have, liquid oxygen and hydrogen.\'

	Although Forward is a successful science fiction writer (and 
despite the fact that Star Trek ships used antimatter propulsion 
drives), the concept is being treated seriously by the U.S. government. 
 Last year, Forward completed a hefty report, titled "Antiproton 
Annihilation Propulsion,\' for the Air Force Rocket Propulsion 
Laboratory, awarded to him on a personal consulting contract.  (Studies 
in antimatter propulsion have also been conducted at NASA\'s Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and a number of 
aerospace contractors.)............

    What is "worth the price"?  Dulinor would probably have
considered any final victory over Lucan "a bargain, the best I
ever had".  Ditto for Strephon, I think.
    The rest of the Final War was a waste of time and effort for
pretty much everyone involved, of course.
    Or were you talking about the REAL "Final War"?  The one
between Yaskaydroy and the kids? ;-)

    Surrender, making the best peace possible.  I am a long way
from an expert on TNE rules (yet), but from what I have seen,
there has been no fundamental change in the relations between
TL\'s.  Sure, the technologies are different, but so what?  The
rate that capabilites change as TL goes up (or down) is pretty
close to where it always was.
    Which is a roundabout way of saying that the TL12 lads are
going to lose this war in a big way.  Note, if you haven\'t
already, that TL14 ships are, ton for ton, cheaper than TL12
ships by a factor of around 50%.  So the differences in the
industrial bases of the two powers will be cancelled out by the
differences in cost of ships.  And, ton for ton, the TL14 ships
(if well designed) will be about ten times as effective as the
TL12 ships...


> Statistics: 
> Gov1 has about 150% the people of Gov2

    Useless advantage, given the differences in ship costs.

> Gov1 is about a sector in size, but Gov2 is about a sector and a half

    Big advantage for Gov2.  They only have to defend a small
area (their high-pop areas), while Gov1 will be losing industrial
base in approximately direct proportion to their world losses.

    Irrelevant to the issue.

    Here is where the equalizer can be fit in.  Depending on the
relative distributions of TL15 worlds/populations, of course. 
Note that, to all intents and purposes, the TL15 worlds will
dominate both polities, unless they are VERY small.  And
whichever side has the most TL15 people will probably win the
war.
    Note that a single high-pop TL15 world pretty much makes the
polity a TL15 polity, NOT a TL14 (or TL12) polity.

    Probably irrelevant, but note that the war will not occur
without at least the tacit permission of the buffer state.  In
fact, I would expect that the attacked party (Gov2) will pretty
much automatically consider the buffer to be on the side of the
aggressor if the buffer allows the aggression to occur without
fighting back.  And if it DOES resist the passage of Gov1\'s
fleets, then Gov1 will never get around to fighting Gov2...;-)

    Probably irrelevant to the issue.

    That is about the best you can do.  It probably will NOT be
enough.  Note that if the war is inevitable within ten years,
then Gov1 should spend the next nine years preparing for the war.


> Moreover, I want to leverage the numerical superority of Gov1\'s

    There is no numerical superiority.  Or very little.  The only
numerical superiority will be if Gov2 designs EXPENSIVE ships. 
In which case Gov2\'s ships will so badly outclass Gov1\'s ships
that mere numbers will be irrelevant (Note that New Home Wasp in
my late TCS game - one Wasp could defeat the entire fighter
complement of the Neubayern Fleet, all 20,000-odd of them).
Quality counts.  And in Trav (all incarnations to date), quality
usually means TL, and very little else.


> (Incidentally, I\'m using TNE stat\'s, not Trillion Credit

    What does the one (TNE) have to do with the other (TCS)?  TCS
is basically system-independent.  All it provides is a campaign
system for interstellar wars.  It works equally well with
Classic, MT, and TNE.  And could be adapted to GURPS Space with
little difficulty...

> (Does anyone here read Dragon?)

    Yes.

NOTE:  I am ignoring the possibility of genocidal war by either
power.  Based on earlier incarnations of Trav, a genocidal war is
virtually impossible to defend against.  That changes SLIGHTLY in
TNE, but I still would not bet too much on any government
surviving long against attacks meant to kill as many people as
possible, as quickly as possible.

I presume the "poom" is caused by the antimatter surrounding itself by
plasma (does this mean it would hit the ground and rocket itself into
the air?).

What if you imploded matter INTO the antimatter (like fission bombs--in
fact, you might even want to use plutonium)?  For the costs involved,
hydrogen bombs could even be used in the trigger.  I think the scientists
are thinking like scientists, not warriors.

With the wise advice of someone else, I too won\'t argue your definitions
for the sake of bandwidth. Good War/Bad War is pretty subjective - History
is written by the victor. . . and subsequently rewritten by the grandkids
;)

"Certain to happen" and "unavoidable" are synonomous, neh? Other than those
stipulations, my advise would be "don\'t do it".

Starting with the assumption that this will be a conventional war, I second
the notion that gov1 prepare extensively for war as much as it can. Hitler
spent 6 years between attaining office and attacking Poland, and practiced
by annexing countries that, unfortunately, no one cared about. Gov1 needs
to anticipate as many of gov2\'s stratagems, and have as advanced a military
as possible - which means tactics and discipline, not just toys.

How many of gov2\'s low/no-pop worlds are still uses? That is, do any of
them have vital resources? I would assume so, otherwise they wouldn\'t claim
them (nost of them, anyway). In attacking, I would advise gov1 to attack
small, undefended worlds that have vital resources - take the oil & wheat
fields, basically. If you do that, you may be able to squeeze the hi-pop
worlds that you won\'r be able to take.

BTW, in response to Merrick\'s comments on how the TL/econ superiority of
gov2 neutralizes gov1\'s numerical superiority. . .there are a number of
reasons that may not be as true as imagined. Gov2 is a federation - I
imagine that while there may be a "Grand Navy", a good number of the
vessels will be provided by the member-states, at whatever TL they have. If
Gov1 attacks the planets it out-classes tech-wise, they\'ll fair better than
attacking their tech-equals and superiors. Eat what you can first. Besides
which, they may not have devoted that much money to lots of high-tech
ships; Many nations facing less advanced opponents settled for fewer
numbers but more advanced weaponry. IMHO it\'s almost axiomatic that
high-tech means smaller numers.

>There is a large buffer state between them, about 2 subsectors in size,

Annex them.
This will put gov2 on alert, so don\'t wait too long before continuing the
attack. Hitler walked through Belgium to get to France; Gov1 can do the
same.

They should do more. Drill, drill, drill. Each soldier has to be so
well-trained that he is better than five enemy soldiers. Officers need to
know tactics in order to counter them better on the battlefield.

>Moreover, I want to leverage the numerical superority of Gov1\'s navy, but

Blitz. Pick some poor-defended but important world and throw everything you
can at it. Repeat as often as needed.

Of course, all of above assumes conventional war. If you just want to kill
people (which I doubt; the animosity is likely due to gov2\'s surpassing of
gov1\'s economy and technology, meaning gov1 would like to capture those
resources) then go cheap. Throw jump drives on missile launchers; have them
jump to system, launch a whole lot of missiles (nuclear or antimatter
tipped) and blow up the planet(s).

You could also simply practice an isiduous propaganda war - inciting riots,
social discord, and so on. . .maybe even locate nationals of gov1 in gov2
territory, and have them complain abot being ill-treated by gov2, giving
gov1 an excuse to invade. . .

Hi All,

Merry Christmas - here is a rather long scenario from my Forward
Fringe campaign. It follows two scenarios I posted to the 
short-lived Sunbane XBOAT list.

This was my first attempt to create a truly alien race. I was reading
a lot of H. P. Lovecraft and wanted to capture some of those types of
space dwelling creatures in my adventures. Though Traveller all
things are possible.

Note that it is in setext format for those of you using EasyView.

TTFN,

Glenn

Scenario - Kyeth
================

Contract
----

A contract is offered by Molke Heavy Industries to investigate the
fate of a research expedition into the Davion subsector. The mission
of the lost expedition was to explore the subsector for trade
opportunities. A 400 ton frontier trader may be assigned to the group
for the mission. They are to depart from Raphia and retrace the flight
plan of the expedition. 

Background
----

The expedition consisted of 7 ships. A type T patrol cruiser 
acted as the command ship. Three Enhanced Performance Scouts
were used to survey unexplored systems in advance of the main
expedition. Three Close Escorts provided protection for the
expedition.
The expedition commander was Jotarin Ramik, a young merchant captain
who had recently successfully opened trade with the systems of Kubae 
and Jascek. He built his reputation as a 2nd officer on a frontier
trader buying empty cargo from the owner and speculating on small
cargos. His rapid rise has earned him some enemies in the trader
community. He is known as an eccentric captain; one who actually
enjoys low berth travel. He has spent a lot of time researching
improved low berths.

Jotarin Ramik 878BA9, Age 34, Merchant, 4 terms.  Final Rank - .
Assets: MCr9.2 (personal wealth),
Equipment Qualified On:
Starship, Ship\'s Guns, Vacc Suit
Skills:  Broker-3, Liason-2, Leader-1, Vacc-1, Pilot-1, Gunnery-1,
Handgun-1

Comments: Jotar owes his success to the fact that he has strong
psionic abilities. He has been careful to hide this fact and uses it
to his advantage in trade negotiations. He has found that while in
low passage his psionic powers remain available to him if he is in a
customized chill berth (as opposed to a low berth). He frequently
travels in this manner, putting his first officer in charge of all
shipboard duties. Because of this longtime associates have noticed a
slowing of the aging process in the last five years.

(Referee Only - Jotarin\'s psionic ability is beyond normal telepathy.
He constantly intercepts thoughts of those around him. Play him as 
if he were overhearing the players\' discussion around the gaming table.)

Valkek 
----

At Valkek, it is learned that the MT has put a contract out on the
destruction of the players vessel. 1 MCr is offered for conclusive
evidence that the recovery mission was destroyed. 

Scarab
----

At Scarab, the astrographic archives of the Scorpi Aureak Advanced
Research Directorate (SAARD) will be made available. This will
give the players accurate data for all systems up to the edge of 
explored space. In exchange, Molke Industries has agreed to let 
SAARD analyze all ships logs recovered from expedition vessels. 


Quorus
----

In a Quorus starport bar, the recovery team is offered a substantial
bribe to drop their current contract and make a special freight haul
to Rulmela.  The agent making the offer may be recognized as the
pirate Drakob Khovar by players with streetwise experience. If they
accept the cargo, Cr200,000 will be advanced to them. Another
Cr800,000 will await them upon delivery.


Rumela
----

At Rumela, the special freight reciever will not come to the arranged
meeting in the starport. Investigation of the cargo will reveal drums
of liquid chemical byproducts. Some have begun leaking. The freight
haul is an obvious set-up. The local authorities have been informed
and are sealing off this wing of the starport. A Type T Patrol cruiser 
is maneuvering to block escape off-world. The leaking chemicals are 
beginning to strain the environmental systems. 
 
(In Classic Traveller tradition, further events are to be determined
by the referee.)

If the cargo was not accepted, a 400 ton Corsair will be waiting to 
ambush the recovery team as they enter the system.


Draask
----

At Draask, a transponder signal from an expedition Close Escort will
be detected originating from the planet\'s surface. Four survivors from
the crew are found living in near starvation conditions. They will
tell of a corsair attack by five 400 ton raiders. Their ship was
crippled and forced down on the planet. The remainder of the
expedition drew off the attackers and jumped. The expedition was to
pick them up on their return trip. They are non-technical specialists
and are incapable of repairing their ship.

The foilage present on the planet contains an incompatible amino
acid which makes most food poisonous to the crew. They have survived
for three months on the rations of the ship and by making use of the
emergency low berths in the gig. They will agree to low berth passage
for the duration of the recovery team\'s mission if required. 

A civilization of small reptilian humanoids inhabits Draask. They
possess TL-4 technology and are ruled by a tribal system. Their 
religion is based on the worship of Agralthg, god of the three-lobed eye.
Apparently, at irregular intervals a large body is seen in the sky,
resembling a winged three-lobed eye. It remains for a month with its
wings spread before it disappears. The population spends this time in 
worship and feasting. Recently, Agralthg\'s visit resulted in severe
disruption among psionic Draask. This is due to hostility caused by the 
radio signal (see below). If the Draask capture expedition members,
they will attempt to placate their god by sacrificing the humans.


Pnakus
----

At Pnakus, an Enhanced Performance Scout from the expedition is found
abandonded in orbit around a habitable planet. The pilot, Maxmillian
Vismark, was marooned on the planet when the life support systems
failed in his ship. 

Maxmillian Vismark 777A87, Age 34, Ex-scout, four terms, Enlisted in
Communications. 60,000 Cr 
Special Assignments: Special Mission - courier.
Awards and Decorations: XP = 9. Morale = 12.
Equipment Qualified On: Electronics, Starship, Ship\'s weapons, Rifle,
Handgun, Vacc Suit
Skills: Gunnery-3, Broker-2, Navig-2, Handgun-2, Pilot-1, Brawling-1,
Electronics-1, Vacc-1, Prospecting-1

Maxmillian Vismark was recently discharged from the Rhalta Scout
Service. He was hired for the expedition because of his familiarity
with Enhanced Performance Scouts. When rescued, he will tell what he
knows of the fate of the expedition. He had finished exploring hex
0436 when he jumped to 0326 Kyeth. He found the expedition in close
proximity to several large vessels. When he signaled by radio,
several of the vessels accelerated to meet him. Severe electrical
discharges were exchanged from the vessels to his ship causing
computer failure. When he brought the computer online and began to
maneuver his vessel the attack resumed. He tried to jump out of the
system when a misjump occurred. He found himself at Pnakus with a
severely damaged ship. He travelled to the surface of a habitable
planet and has survived there for two months. His scout ship has
suffered computer, power plant, and life support damage. 

Maxmillian suspects that Jotar has made some special agreement with
a newly contacted alien race and wishes to keep others from learning
this. He will graciously agree to join the recovery expedition in
any role which is useful.


Kyeth
----

At Kyeth, the recovery team finds 18 alien vessels clustered around the
surviving ships of the expedition. The expedition will attempt to 
signal by maser that radio transmissions should not be used. If 
radio transmission occurs, the aliens may interpret this as a
challange. The survivors are still repairing their ships although 
two are jump worthy now. If radio is not used, the recovery team 
will be permitted to approach the expedition and board. The 
survivors will relate the experiences which have occurred at Kyeth.

When the expedition intially entered the system, twenty vessels of 
about 1000 tons each reacted agressively. A universal hail 
transmission provoked an attack. Electromagnetic pulses from the 
aggressors wreaked havok among the expedition ships. On the bridge 
of the Darkind , Jotar was critically injured. As the expedition ships 
evaded the attack, the second officer managed to get Jotar to his 
chill berth. While in his dream state, Jotar was able to psionically 
contact the Kyeth and convince them to end the attack. He was able 
to determine that the attacking vessels were not ships crewed by aliens
but lifeforms. Jotarin named them Kyeth for the system in which they
were discovered, but he suspects they originated elsewhere.

The next six weeks were spent repairing the ships and preparing to 
depart. A week ago, Jotar arranged for a 20 ton gig to be equipped 
with his chill berth and the maximum cargo of provisions it could 
carry. He departed the Darkind and flew into the maw of the largest 
Kyeth present. He left behind records promoting his first officer to 
captain and explaining his mission. He had learned that the Kyeth 
were capable of interstellar travel and wished to explore the Khalij 
Expanse from within one of the beings. A day later, the largest 
Kyeth moved away from the rest and disappeared from normal space at
a phenomenal speed.


The Kyeth
----

The Kyeth are massive vaccuum dwelling life forms discovered in the
Kyeth system from which they are named. They are intelligent and 
highly psionic. The young develop in the atmosphere of a large gas 
giant. Their immature form is a tubular structure composed of several
gasbag subdivisions. During this stage they resemble airships and
drift with the atmospheric winds. They can change altitude by
absorbing or rejecting heat which expands or contracts the gasbags.
Their metabolism processes the gases present in the atmosphere.
Gradually, the soft membranes harden and form a thick polymeric
shell. As their mass increases, a psionic telekenesis ability 
develops to keep them continually aloft. The mature Kyeth leaves the
atmosphere and lives in space. A very efficient absorption of stellar
radiation supplies their energy needs.

The adult Kyeth has a trilobed symmetrical pod structure. Three 
large fans can be unfolded for the purpose of absorbing or 
transmitting energy. Three long appendages exist slightly forward of
the fans. Further forward, the three lobes separate to form a maw 
when opened. Small asteroids can be injested through this opening 
when minerals are required. When the fans are folded, they lie next 
to the tail and aid in psionic movement. In the center of the body 
are internal organs. Running down the center is the system capable of
breaking down minerals for the purpose of regeneration and growth. 
The brain is a ring shaped organ towards the front. Behind it is the 
energy storage organ which acts as a bank of capacitors. At the rear 
is the reproductive organ which stores jelly like embryos for 
release in gas giant atmospheres. 

In addition to their antigrav lift, Kyeth are capable of high power
electromagnetic pulse, which can be used as a weapon. The fans focus 
the bursts, which inficts damage as a particle accelerator of equal 
EP output. The output can be up to one fourth the total charge. 

Kyeth are capable of limited interstellar travel through a psionic 
teleportation effect which approaches stutterwarp when rapidly cycled.
Each hop requires an instant of thought to resolve the destination. 
Within a gravity field this resolution is difficult so very short hops
are used. In the emptiness of interstellar space they are capable of 
FTL travel as the lengths of the hops increases.

The Kyeth communicate by radio emissions. They can also communicate 
telepathically, though less efficiently. They have little interest in
human ships except when radio transmissions excite them to attack. 
Meson and Ladar transmissions are not received by the Kyeth and have 
no effect. Active sensors may distress them. They exhibit above animal
intelligence, barely sapient.

The Kyeth can be up to 18000 tons (3D6*1000) in displacement. The 
energy storage is equal to 1 EP per 25 ton of total displacement. They
can achieve 1-G acceleration through antigrav. One month is required 
to fully charge the capacitors in most systems.

When first encountered most will have their fans extended, basking in
the stellar radiation. A few will be navigating the asteroid fields in
search of minerals.

There is evidence that the Kyeth did not evolve naturally. The home
system of this alien race is not known. They have been encountered 
throughout the Khalij Expanse. It is surmised by some researchers that
Kyeth were developed by another alien race for space travel. Remains
found in the Yekt system (0433) are of a large Kyeth fitted with
hardware which would be weapons systems and propulsion rockets.

The information on the Solomani population was in both MT and CT library 
_I think_.  However I am away from my stuff (gibber gibber wimper - 
withdrawl symptoms) so I can\'t check for you sorry (Im on the other side 
of the world...)

Also as for raising the average population of worlds - I used averages!  
To expand, if my memory serves me correctly (HIWG 208.01 may give more 
info on method), I took the proportion of Hi Pop to Low Pop worlds from 
Solomani Rim, and worked out the average pop of the lower pop, unnamed, 
worlds and of the high pop, named, worlds

This gave a low pop or 10^4 odd and a high pop avg between 10^9 and 
10^10.  As the difference is x10^5, most of the pop appeared in hi pop 
worlds.  Considering the way the Solomani colonised worlds to rimward - 
baby banks and genetics - I would have thought they would find most 
suitable \'garden\' worlds and boosted pop through the roof there, while kept 
pops in other \'resource\' worlds to the optimal for resource recovery.

If you raise the pop of all of the worlds then you end up with every 
world having a pop close to 1 bill if not more (ie all having major 
populations, ie named worlds.  This is due to the fact that for every 
world having (let\'s say) 90 billion - if you reduced the number to 10 
billion, you could raise the pop of 80 worlds to major world status!!!!!
(1 bill+)

Hmmm scary thought playing with numbers of people that way!!!!  Also 
scarier if you consider the tax potential under Striker and TCS that 
doing so gives all of those 80 worlds..read the articles on taking major 
worlds earlier in xboat or traveller...oh well there go the ideas of 
conquest of the galaxy.

PS I support the Sol - my guess on depth of conquest was an estimate.  It 
takes them into Zarushagar sector through Diaspora and more..,any more 
and they take Capital!! which would be a frightening thought for the 
Vilani, and I think would once again end the Imperium like the Rule of 
Man did...  then the Solomani would get apathetic again, and ...well the 
rest would be _alternate_ history

    So I assumed.  I was suggesting raising "average population" so as to

    I will generously assume that you produced these erroneous numbers
because your stuff is far away...;-)
    Actually, a "hi-pop" world averages 20,000,000,000 (pop 10), and a 
"non hi-pop" world averages around 50,000,000 (pop 7).  At least is you
use the standard traveller role-up scheme...

    It still is, even if you use the correct population "averages".  Over 90%
of the population is on the high pop worlds, which amount to about 8% of
the number of worlds...

     Truly.  And I don\'t NEED to read the articles on taking major worlds -
I wrote a lot of them, and read the rest (and filed them)...

     Exactly so.  But I am using the Islands Alliance (Rift Alliance?) to do
the same job.  Along with the Zhos, the Solomani, and the Vargr...

I have recently discovered this list server. I have written a MegaTraveller
character generation program and would like to make it available to other
Mega-

It features advanced character generation for Mercenaries, Navy, Scouts,
Merchant Princes, COACC, IRIS, and Scientists. It includes Imperial, Solani,
Vilani, Darrian, Jonkereen, Aslan, Droyne, Hiver, K\'kree anf Vargr races. It
uses basic character generation where I could not find advanced character
generation rules. This is all I had access to in advanced character types and
races or I would have done others. It produces a screen with the character
description on it to be printed when you finish the generation process.

I used an IBM compatable computer. It does not do any fancy graphics. I wrote
it in "PowerC" and converted it to "Turbo C", so it should be portable to
other
platforms. I would be happy to make the source code available in addition to
the executables.

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance...
