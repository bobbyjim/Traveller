DingDingDing! We have a winner! Scott, give

Bruce, you were exceedingly close and, Black
ICE, you made the same guess I did initially.

Thank you all for playing. :-)

The article the above link leads to is the one I
was reading. The conditions are so hellish that
air must be forced into the mines to allow the
miners to breathe (note: not breathe well, just
breathe) and watersprays are used to stop the
miners from slowly cooking..literally.

These conditions exist at the lowest levels of
the mine, around 2 miles deep.

Not a place filled with long-term prospects but
a great bit of detail for designing a world near
the inner limits of a star\'s habital orbit(s).

Then they wouldn\'t be spinal mounts, would they?  The idea of a spinal

I don\'t see why it costs less to put the waste on a moon or asteroid. 
You also have to hit the moon or asteroid *precisely*, don\'t you? (And
they are a lot smaller than the star.)  In fact, you can\'t just hit it;
you have to land the stuff there and off-load it.  On the other hand,
you are correct that the waste would be recoverable if someday anybody
wants it.

Hmmm, from back of envelope calculations, the answer seems to be the relativity
equation.

M = orbital period of moon around GG.
G = orbital period of GG around star.

Day length = M / (1-sqrt(M squared/G squared))

It could be argued that the IQ of news *viewers* has been dropping over the

For the life of me, I can\'t figure out why this is an asinine question.

The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of people are *not* snipers
with lots of confirmed kills... myself included. It\'s entirely possible that
people who are not snipers with lots of confirmed kills might be interested
in what a sniper feels when he shoots the bad guys, if he feels anything at
all.

In fact, if I ever was in a situation where I personally felt comfortable
about asking a sniper with lots of kills what he feels when he pulls the
trigger, I would most likely ask..

What I would consider an asinine question would be something like "What sets
you apart from the average clocktower mass-murderer?" or a loaded and
childish question like "Do you think that you\'re a good role model for
children after the recent rash of high-school shootings?"

(Of course, the *real* question I would ask a SEAL if given the chance is:
"Does Charlie Sheen have what it takes?" but hey... that\'s another story.)

Well, let\'s take a look at GURPS: Traveller, and see what technologies
they list that are less advanced in G:T than in standard GURPS TL.

1.  Medical technology.  "Braintaping and regeneration rays are
unavailable."  My guess is that the anti-psionic taboo precludes
research into braintaping.

2.  Beam weapon technology.  Nerve guns and stunners appear only at G:T
TL-12 (in other GURPS products, they appear at TL-10 and TL-9,
respectively).  Further, they are 10 times the standard GURPS cost. 
GURPS beam weapons not found at all in G:T include paralysis guns,
displacers ("tachyon shotguns"), and space-time disruptors (this list is
a sample only).  Displacers and space-time disruptors are probably not
included because the FTL paradigm of Traveller is incompatible with
these devices.  Note, however, that the other weapons in question (nerve
guns, stunners, and paralysis guns) all affect the nervous system of a
creature.  Again, the anti-psionic attitudes in the 3I probably prevent
(or at least retard) some research
into these areas.

<>skipping electronics and force field tech; the examples don\'t seem to
be due to any stigma<>

3.  Neural interface, implants, and cybernetics.  G:T explicitly states
that the rarity of these items (other than non-augmented prosthetic
devices) is due to "Imperial distrust for technology that smacks of
robotics or mind control (\'Zhodani influences!\')"  Again, these items
are related to the first two examples given, as all require a knowledge
of sophonts\' nervous systems that could lead to what I would call
"psychoelectronics."  (While the term "psionics" was originally used to
describe just such electronically-enhanced psi powers, it has come to
refer to natural psi powers.  Thus, I have had to devise a new term.)

Well, the Solomani Confederation would be _far_ less squeamish about
such things as "psychoelectronics", for a couple of reasons.  One, the
Solomani Confederation does _not_ border the Zhodani Consulate.  Two,
psychoelectronics might make it easier to run a
totalitar^h^h^h^h^h^h^h^h^h highly centralized government.

As for the others, I leave them to the other members of the TML.

I\'m no expert, but my understanding of Triage in disaster or
battlefield situations is a little different from what I\'ve seen
posted.  There are three groups (well, really four groups if you
include those with minor injuries), and they are treated in this
order:

1.  Those who will probably live *if* they get immediate treatment.
    Treating them is the most efficient use of resources, if saving
    lives is the goal. 

2.  Those who will probably live even without *immediate* treatment.
    Get this group ambulatory (or at least transportable) and out
    of the danger area where more resources are available so their
    long term disabilities will be minimized.

3.  Those who will probably die even with immediate treatment.
    Don\'t waste valuable time or resources on them until you\'ve
    saved as many lives as you can.  Just make them as comfortable
    as you can, knowing you probably won\'t save any of them.  It has
    always seemed heartless to me, but I can see the logic.
    
4.  Those with minor injuries who will certainly live.  Ignore them,
    let them treat themselves and each other, or remove them
    immediately from the danger zone.  Don\'t spend your medical
    resources on them in the emergency area.  Treat their non-life
    threatening wounds elsewhere if/and when time permits.

My understanding may be totally at odds with the way triage is
taught, but I thought I\'d thrown my 2 cents out there.

You\'ve already seen a reference to Freelance Traveller; as its
owner, let me toot my own horn a bit and say that (a) I try to
keep a level of quality worthy of the best of Traveller-gone-by,
and (b) in the probably about five years and two redesigns I\'ve
managed it through, I\'ve outright rejected exactly one article, a
fiction submission, for being a poorly-written and
thinly-diguised combination of D&D and Star Wars, rather than
being Traveller. I\'ve worked with submitters to fine-tune
articles into a shape that I would be willing to publish them in,
and I will continue to do so. Have no fear about submitting your
work to Freelance Traveller; betting that you _won\'t_ be
published is \'taking the short end\', and you\'re likely to lose
the bet.

My objectives are (a) to have the best Traveller site on the net
(and I have competition that makes me work at it, and keeps me
honest - not the least of which is my own host, The Traveller
Downport, at http://www.downport.com !) and (b) to ensure that
Traveller fans have at least one Traveller resource on the net
that they will feel good about visiting.

My idea of quality _material_ was formed by Traveller
publications such as the original Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid
Society and the MegaTraveller Digest, as well as the DGP
supplements. My idea of quality _writing_ was formed by
publications such as The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,
TIME Magazine, and the old Byte and Computer Language magazines.
I\'ve tried to make Freelance Traveller reflect both kinds of
quality. It helps to have as many top-notch Traveller writers as
I do allowing me to publish their material under the Freelance
Traveller masthead; I\'d be nothing but another schlock toy web
site without them.

I\'d like to think that, even though it\'s a web publication,
rather than paper-and-ink, Freelance Traveller holds true to the
ideals of the fanzine. Please, give it a visit, form your own
opinion, and let me know. I think you\'ll be happy; certainly, I
_hope_ you\'ll be happy.

I also think I\'d better lay off before the rest of the list
starts throwing rotten vegetables at me! >:)

Oh, one more thing - while I\'m not aware of other sites that are
structured to resemble \'zines, I do think you could do worse than
visiting some of the other Traveller sites out there.  There\'s
Downport, http://www.downport.com, which I mentioned above;
there\'s Carlos Alós-Ferrer\'s Geonee Sourcesite and Beyond The
Extents campaign site, at
http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Station/8772/ ; there\'s the
Missouri Archive, run by Joe Heck, at
http://web.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/ ; there\'s David
"Hyphen" Jacques-Watson\'s (I _think_ that\'s how his name is
spelled) pages at http://www.pcug.org.au/~davidjw/ ; and there\'s
loads of other good sites out there - just start following the
Traveller Web Ring links, and the links on the links pages of any
of the Traveller sites you visit.

Ah, that helps!  I didn\'t think the book *I* read as a kid was called _Space Prison_, but I remembered the plot you guys were discussing. I\'d forgotten who wrote it and could never find _The Survivors_ after I grew up and started looking for it...

Sorry.

Although the temp and seepage fit, the atmosphere
is merely oppressive. It just *feels* like the
pressure is doubled.

Nice try, though.  ;-)

Oh, I hope so!

Neural links were first written up in one of
GDW\'s JTAS publications, stun carbines
were featured in one of the adventures, and
a gravity rifle (I think) in one of DGP\'s
adventures. I\'d love to see what old/new
devices are going to be made available for G:T

What is asinine about that question?  

Your Traveller idea is good, and you can play it either way.  The PCs
can be hounded by an insipid journalist who really doesn\'t understand
what they do for a living and how it is for the benefit of their
employer.  That NPC can be annoying and possibly dangerous if he or she
learns anything important that should be kept secret (like which laws
were broken on that recent escapade, and by whom).  On the other hand,
the PCs could be playing reporters playing dumb to get real information,
or it could just be their cover story that they are reporters.

I don\'t know enough about asteroidal impact sites to say one way or  the
other but  placer deposits proximal to the weathered remains of one of the
very rich ore bodies cited above would be a possibility.   Sedimentary
processes could concentrate the metal from the primary body in rich enough
quantities to be worth extracting.  If I remember correctly I read or was
told about a site like this which occurs some where in Alaska.  The metal in
the primary body is low grade and not economical to mine but placers
proximal to it were rich enough but not extremely extensive.   Plar

the standard dton is

          2m x 2m x 3.5m (=14m^3)
or        1.5m x 3m x 3m (=13.5m^3)

When I did the deckplans for the Pioneer Ecks, I allocated deck squares
to life support and grav compensators.

I\'m intending to claim that ship as a prototype. If I ever do the
Pioneer Ecks Eye, I\'d use a 3.5m inter deck gap and put all the
grav compensation and life support in the space between the decks.

Remembering that half the volume of your staterooms is available for
common rooms and corridors should provide enough space.

A good example of this type of NPC was in the Alacrity FitzHugh (sic?)
set of books. The reporter began writing "penny dreadfuls", similar to
the Buffalo Bill books, etc. This immediately led to several situations,
some in which their reputations actually acted to their advantage,
scaring locals etc. and numerous others that worked against them when
youngesters etc. came gunning for them, etc. For the most part the books
were total fiction but the reputation attached to the characters stuck.

No laws requiring them here, but the cell compaines are rushing to
create overlapping tower fields.  However, several neighborhoods
down here are complaining loudly that they don\'t want "those
unsightly towers in *their* neighborhoods!"  They say the towers
lower property values.  Just a reminder that almost any new
technology will have opponents with good (and not so good) reasons
for opposing it.

Only in this crowd would someone submit an erratum for a vignette :-).

Point noted.  When I have time (yeah, right) I\'ll decide whether this actually
warrants an erratum or not.  Its already been pointed out to me that the
rules for placing orbits are a bit too grainy -- if you tinker with the Bode
constant you can probably design systems where the planets are more
closely spaced.  A K3 V isn\'t going to have a very wide life zone, though.

The moon\'s "day" is the same duration as its orbital period. Next, (drawing
on what I did for Tavonni), work out the length of the gas giant\'s
shadow-cone. Check if the moon\'s orbit is greater than the shadow-cone. If
not, there will be periods of total eclipse. Work out the length of the arc
that falls within the cone, then work out how long the moon is in shadow -
this becomes a short second "night". BTW, when mapping the world just draw
it normally. Don\'t bother drawing the world as you would a world that is
tidally-locked to its star - from the star\'s POV, the moon still rotates,
and there *is* day and night.

One for our biologists, I think, but my guess is something to do with the
inverse-square "law" (plus simplicity of the creature\'s construction).

Someone posted that it would be difficult to get it to not orbit the star. That
seems odd to me, but the guy is obviously quite educated, and I know squat on
orbital dynamics.But I am with you on star-dumping for anything completely
useless AND excessively dangerous.

Oh, and if you are interested, "Jaques" (no \'c\') turns out to be English,
not French - Cornwall, I think. *Probably* a corruption of a Norman name,
but it goes back at least as far as the Crusades, where a Jaques was

Probably not, mainly because Pulver is now a full-time employee of another
company (Guardians of Order?) doing anime-related game stuff.  His contract
allows him to work on some GURPS books, but only those specified ahead of
time.  By 2002, things may change, but I wouldn\'t count on it.

Thus it is nice to have another "grabber", but this deeloped later and
is not a limb. Imagine a prehensile tail on, oh, say a bird type critter
that is marsupial. Now that sounds alien with terran proven forms.

Because the other two are wings. They WERE legs once, it was a sacrifice

They can\'t grow new limbs this late in their development.

O.K. I like this, but what about life evolved on a more arid planet? Or
in gas giants like the Jgd? BTW, are they really canonical? my arbiter

But how about a catfish like critter which evolves prehensile whiskers?

Is there any reason endoskeletons exclude exoskelotons? The terrapins

Now wait a sec, isn\'t the last bit about insects true? I know the others

Now that is a wonderful idea. But we always seem to go to even numbers
on limbs. What about asymetrical designs like some starfish? And has
anyone heard of trichordates, presumably some ancient extinct life form
whom I assume to have three spines.

Can\'t wait to hear what theories THIS stirs up. :)

But smaller parallel mounts ... If you want to be a true gearhead,

	Parallel mounts are fixed, IIRC, and point with the ship. Ergo, they
all have to engage the same target ... unless you mount them with an
offset between them. But in that case, the second target would have
to be in just the perfect position relative to the first. I can
probably be convinced you can tweak the beams slightly as they exit
the accelerator to allow minute variations in targeting, but not much
more.

	If you want to aim them separately, make\'em big honking bays.

I saw something recently on either Discovery channel or The Learning
Channel about the development of robots. Various robot designs have been
tried. It turns out that the four-legged ones offer the best combination
of stability and power usage.

The six-legged robots were stable, but required too much power for
motion. The power required increased exponentially the larger the robots
got, which might explain why the only species on Earth that have six
legs are very small. 

The two-legged ones were the most unstable (read: required the most
computing power for balancing acts) but offered the lowest power
requirement for locomotion.

I couldn\'t stop laughing at the hopping one-legged robots, so I won\'t
comment further on them.

I\'m no biologist, but it seems to me that any ground-dwelling species
will evolve the same way. Natural selection will eliminate all but the
most efficient designs, given enough time.

This gets back to the recently popular theory that birds evolved from
dinosaurs (and that theory was popular even before a certain movie came
along).

Sure they can. It is possible for a mutant bird to be hatched with two
extra limbs. However, unless these limbs give that bird an advantage
over its peers, it won\'t survive long enough to breed.

The Jagd are mentioned in one of the JTAS issues. I guess that\'s
canonical, since GDW created them.

Or how about a six-legged insect that, over generations, gets larger and
larger? As it does so, two of its legs shrink into prehensile stubs,
like what happened to our toes.

I hope so.  

Seriously, I hope the movie gets made and turns out to be a critical

Traveller, a hit with D&D makes a Traveller film a stronger
possibility, and that would be "a good thing"...we can only hope.  I

Now this is a good framework to go from. But some alien life may exist in a

leniency given to their form. Maybe?

Right. What I should have said(typed?) was it was a rather drastic mutation
with a much lower chance of being "functional". Limbs are what I would
classify as a major morphological structure. I am not a biologist but the
only more broad form choice I can think of is linear spine or perhaps
bilateral in general.

Cool! Now the question is fore, mid, or hind? I imagine shortened forelimbs
would be prone to adapt to food-gathering, while the hindmost would probably
be best used to secure traction. The mid limbs, other than possibly being
wings or struts for some kind of gliding membrane between fore and hind
limbs, baffle me. Anyone? I am intrigued.

I use stutterwarp, but limit it to STL in my games, it\'s my
"reactionless thruster."  FTL is still jump drive.  By limiting
stutterwarp\'s pseudo-velocity (fastest in "known space" is 6000 kps)
I don\'t have to worry about the discharging bit.  I also get to keep
a more "Travellerisk" feel with the one week in jump.

You know, I suspect you can find similar conditions around various

The Traveller reasoning; I am moving stars out of the center of their
hexagons in order to make more believable star maps. I figure I will
move them 1% of a hex towards the right for each
((random number from 0 to 99) - 50) and 1% towards the top for another
random number.

Since we know that from one hex side to another it is 1 parsec, it is
easy to figure out what 1% up/down is.

Now; Each angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees. If I cut a hex up
into 12 right triangles I end up with 12 30/60/90 triangles, and I
know that the side opposite the 60 is .5 parsecs. I can then do a
sin(60) = .866 , and a little more math ((.5 / H = .866), (H = .667)
H*2 = 1.333) (OK, I rounded more here than I did on the calculator)),
so a little more math shows me that the width of a hex is 1.333
parsecs.

Am I crazy? (It\'s been a long time since I used geometry, even though
I regularly program graphs.) I started to do the cosine of 30 to
double check until I realized the cos(30) = sin(60). Exactly.

Feel free to reply off the list, so everyone doesn\'t start screaming
that I started the hexagonal geometry thread!

Chris, I think the SEAL *gave* the reporter her answer.  I don\'t
doubt at all that when he pulls the trigger he has compartmentalised
his mind so that he really doesn\'t feel anything except recoil.  How
he handles it *later* might be another story, but I doubt he would
*want* to talk to a reporter about that.

    First it was a he speaking not a she, Eris, that is way to damn PC for
me.  And, there are some people who do not feel the death\'s of others.  When
I was in the USMC, & in DS/DS, I know when I shoot Iraqi troops, I really
did not feel a thing, then or now.  I do wake up with nightmares about the
shelling of the beach, or the heat & thirst, the sun shinning down right
into my eyes, but I never dream about the men I killed.  My father faught in
WWII, Korea, & \'Nam & before he died, we talked about it, man to man, Marine
to Marine.  He also did not feel a thing about it.  It is a job, nothing
more nothing less.  It would be different to me, at least, if I knew the
person, but to me, they are targets.  And, targets do not mean anything.
    Though, my father did say that he once felt something about killing a
bad guy, happiness & satisfaction.  Durring, an assualt on an island in the
S. Pasiifc, my father & his platoon came across a Field Hospital.MASH Unit &
the patiants were all dead, the men murdered in cold blood, & the women
raped to death, when the platoon caught up to the Japanese unit that did
this, they killed everyone of them.  Even the ones that surrendered.  It
seems some of the patiants were fellow marines, so the CO a 90 day wonder,
who was also a pre-law student held a courts martial for the ones who
surrendered & had them dig their own graves & then gave the order to fire,
each one of the POWs were killed.
    As my father says, "If you do not follow the rules of war, do not seek
their protection."

Now this sounds like you are wanting to "zoom in" and overlay a smaller
hexgrid onto the one parsec standard, then jink these systems around a
little in that framework?

I\'ve been puzzling over some simular problems while fiddling with hex

If you\'ll start it, I\'ll join! Can we get into the orientation of
hexagonal grids laid onto icosahedral globes? I say current conventions
are 90 degrees off!

Yeah. Next I might go full 3d, but one thing at a time. I am trying to 
come up with a map of space outside what we currently know of space
that is as realistic as a map of known space is (something like
http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html shows).

I was thinking I would give them coordinates base on my homeworld. Amho is
.76 parsecs rimward, .34 parsecs spinward of Eideann.

>Up down as in Rimward Coreward?

Up as in towards the top of the map, but yes, on the OTU maps, up is
coreward, right is trailing.

I noticed that the wording wasn\'t clear when I read my post on the
TML.  I had gotten that the SEAL was a he and the reporter was a
she.  So, for clarity revise my sentence to read, "...the SEAL gave
the reporter his answer to her question."

As for the rest, I don\'t share your background and I don\'t I share
what I preceive to be your attitude on this subject.  I do agree,
however, that there are people that don\'t feel the death of others.

It wasn\'t the validity of the answer that I was calling into question, I\'ll
take the sniper\'s word for it. It was how the *question* was in and of

Personally, I think it was a gauche question, which David might have meant
by asinine. When I read the message the meaning came across as: a question
that people with low I.Q. might ask since the answer is so plainly obvious
to everybody.

about the system generation process in First In:

1.) How does a worldbuilder figure out a blackbody temp for a moon? In the
formula B=(278 * Fourth Root of L) / Square root of R (p. 75) is R the
radius of the parent world\'s orbit in the case of a moon?

2.) Are there any special considerations for the moons of gas giants in
general?

3.) Are there special considerations for Sulfur Icy Rockball GG moons? Do
the active volcanoes raise the average surface temperature at all?

4.) Should "Detailed World Typing" (Sidebar p. 65) be used for moons as well
as planets?

5.) What kind of life can exist on Hostile worlds? (Look down for specific
questions)

    a.) Hostile (SG): "A gas subgiant close enough to its primary star may
support life." (p. 68) What is "close enough" exactly? What type of life can
it support?

    b.) Hostile (N): "Terra itself was a nitrogen world early in its
history, before the advent of photosynthetic life." Does this mean it\'s
possible for a Hostile (N) world to support very primitive,
non-photosynthetic life?

    c.) Hostile (A): "If an ammonia world is warm enough, it may have oceans
of liquid water and ammonia in a so-called "eutectic" mixture. Such a world
may support life." What is warm enough, exactly? It would appear that the
only Hostile (A) worlds that can appear only appear in the Outer Zone, where
it doesn\'t seem that they could actually be warm enough.

6.) The formula D = 309,000 * Square root of L / T^2 on page 53 says that D
is the star\'s diameter in astronomical units. However, if I plug in values
from the table on page 50 I seem to get what\'s listed as the radius in the
table.

Example: the temp of a G5 V star is listed as 5,800, the Luminosity is
listed as 0.79 and the radius is listed as 0.0082.

If I plug the temp and luminosity into the formula I get: 0.0081642. It
seems to work the same way for other values I\'ve picked at random from the
table.

Is this the diameter or the radius? Does the table on page 50 show the
diameter or the radius? Is the formula wrong, or the table, or both, or
neither?

Finally:

7.) What other factors can contribute to heating up or cooling down a planet
(or, presumably, a moon)? In the main body of text on page 75, there\'s the
statement "This temperature should only be considered approximate, since
there are many other significant factors." Then, in the sidebar on the same
page, there\'s the similar statement "Had the temperature falled outside the
range, the GM had many ways to adjust it."

What are some of the other factors that could be involved, and what kind of
effects might they have on the world\'s average temperature? What are the
"many ways" to adjust the temperature? I imagine terraforming could play a
role, but are there other ways as well?

Sorry about the number of questions, just a little confused at points.

Okay, let\'s try another test.

Take 7 equally sized coins/washers/buttons. Put one on a table and
arrange the other six around it so each of them touches the middle one.

Now, you can immediately see that there are 6 directions in which
the centres of two adjoining coins are 1 diameter apart.

Any other coins must be further apart...the small bit of table you can
see is a clue to the difference.

If the coins touch vertically, then the horizontal gap between centres
is...

Some sums:

	v = vertical gap between centres
	h = horizontal gap between centres
	r = length of hex side

	v = 2 r cos30
	h = 1.5 r (draw it and see)

=>	h = (1.5 v) / (2 cos30)

	v = 1
=>	h = .866

Your problem of dividing up the hexes is that you cannot divide a hex
into equal squares. Or hexes.
You would have to divide it into 6 equilateral triangles, each of which
can be divided into 4 triangles, which divide into another 4 and so on.

Otherwise, your distribution will not be even or it will cause stars
to change hex.

Hopefully, this "explanation" should cause more problems than it solves.

Agreed. Also, the different gravitational forces on other worlds will alter the
power required for locomotion. On low-G worlds, six-legged creatures could well
be larger, because they don\'t require as much energy to move.

Agreed. The possibility is, IMO, very, very, low. Now, if we had Mr. Burns

Well, let\'s not assume that the mouth is at the front of the beast. What if the
mouth is located centrally between its legs, like that of an octopus? Then the
mid-legs could be used for food-gathering, with the outer legs splayed wide for
traction during this maneuver.

Hmmm, pre-coffee imagination starting to run away with me. Picture the mouth as
a extensible burrowing tool. The creature resembles a four-legged camera stand
(but lower to the ground), with the mid-legs and mouth digging away at the
ground for prey (or adventuring PCs, of course).

Correct.  Distance to the primary star is the relevant item.

Specify.  What special considerations would you expect?

Almost all gas giant moons will be tide-locked to the gas giant.  They\'ll tend
to be small.

Maybe, since the volcanoes are there because tidal effects heat the moon\'s
interior up.  I have no data as to how big an effect this would be, so I 
ignored
it.

Close enough to have liquid water or ammonia-water oceans.  Presumably
with that you could get even pretty complicated life-forms, although the
biochemistry would obviously be very different from our own.

The point is, the ammonia-water mixture has a lower freezing point than
water does by itself.  Presumably, then, the liquid eutectic mixture would be
possible for some distance out into the outer zone.  With the liquid for a 
sub-
strate, life is possble.  I would have to do some further research to 
establish
exactly how far out the mixture can remain liquid.  It\'s a complicated 
question
and I didn\'t feel like addressing it in detail in the book (since that would 
have
probably required yet another orbital zone and more rules).

This is a known erratum.  The tables should refer to "diameter."  
Unfortunately
the rules for computing the 100-diameter radius from a star are based on the
assumption that the value from the table is a radius; that needs to be fixed 
too.
When I have time I plan to track down all the places where this mistake
cropped up and submit a list to SJG.

What I had in mind was that the GM could adjust the exact planetary
orbital radius or the planet\'s albedo (or both) in order to get a desired 
surface
temperature.  You could probably fudge the greenhouse effect a little, too,
if you felt like it.  It would be a big job to describe exactly how all these
adjustments could reflect local conditions, but that\'s just handwaving anyway.
The point is that there\'s plenty of leeway in the random-generation systems
in the book.

One more factor to consider: the inclination of the planet\'s orbit around
its primary. The moon\'s orbit is tilted with respect to the Earth\'s, so 
that when it passes behind the Earth (from the Sun\'s viewpoint), it usually
passes above or below the resulting Earth shadow.

Admittedly, if it\'s a large GG and a close orbit, it would need to be a very
large inclination for this to happen in this hypothetical system.

Agreed. The use of the word "asinine" was a poor choice

"Gauche" would have been a much more accurate choice,
exactly for the reason you\'ve stated.

Well, I assumed that the tidal forces from the gas giant could heat up the
moon\'s interior, if the moon was close enough. That\'s one, but you\'ve
already said that you weren\'t sure about that. Other than that, I figured
that there might be something that was obvious, but I just didn\'t know
about. I seem to remember hearing that gas giants emit some radiation, for
example. I was wondering if this might be enough to heat up a moon.

That\'s just it, though. I don\'t know what special considerations to expect,
since I don\'t know all that much about gas giants and their moons ;)

Ouch! That\'s a biggie! I assume that the various assorted formulae that use

  I saw something recently on either Discovery channel or The Learning
  Channel about the development of robots. Various robot designs have been
  tried. It turns out that the four-legged ones offer the best combination
  of stability and power usage.

It was Scientific American Frontiers.  I was a grad student in the MIT
Leg Lab when Arcwelder Films came through to film for that show.  Some
of what they used was in fact our archival footage.

  The six-legged robots were stable, but required too much power for
  motion. The power required increased exponentially the larger the robots
  got, which might explain why the only species on Earth that have six
  legs are very small. 

If you are going to move with substantial speed, you are not going to
be statically stable.  I can\'t think of _any_ creature which regularly
moves in a statically stable manner.  So this data point regarding the
six-legged robots is not applicable.

  The two-legged ones were the most unstable (read: required the most
  computing power for balancing acts) but offered the lowest power
  requirement for locomotion.

I disagree on a couple points here.

If you go to a dynamically stable robot, the extra power requirements
for size are not really connected to the number of legs.  Just make
the legs lightweight compared to the body, and how many of them you
have is not very relevant.

  I couldn\'t stop laughing at the hopping one-legged robots, so I won\'t
  comment further on them.

I will.  Running is basically hopping on your legs as though they were
springs.  The power requirements are actually those of putting the
legs in the right place and replacing energy lost in the leg springs.


The one legged hopping robot, however funny, was immensely instructive
in making the two legged one.  There were two limits on the running
speed of the one-legged robot.  The first was the fact that when you
swing the leg forward, the body tilts down.  While the leg\'s on the
ground, you have to correct for it.  The more important one is that
while the robot is in the air you have to reposition the leg for
landing.  You can give yourself more time by hopping higher (or
lowering gravity), but the greater your air time the greater the
effect of any inaccuracies in your hop.  Eventually, you don\'t want to
hop higher, so you are left with moving the leg more quickly.  Quick
movements mean higher power requirements.

The two legged robot was a natural extension of the one legged robot.
It addresses both of the speed limitations.  Two legs means that when
one leg swings, the other leg can swing the other direction to
decrease the body tilt.  More importantly, you have twice as long to
position a leg for landing.  The two-legged hopping robot we built has
the land speed record for a legged robot (about 11mph on flat ground -
compare this to an ostrich, which has been clocked at 50mph).

The four legged robot, using its legs in pairs, was generally more
stable and conceivably just as fast as the biped.  After all, we used
pairs of legs to make a single "virtual" leg, then used the biped
running algorithm.  Its _big_ problem was that there were more parts
to maintain.

A hypothetical six-legged running robot would have the following
qualities:
1. More parts to break.
2. More redundancy.
3. Higher maximum speed, if you are willing to be less stable (running
with three pairs of legs).
4. Higher stability, at the cost of maximum speed (running with an
alternating tripod gait).


Regarding the comment about the processing power required to run:

It turns out that the processing power required to run is actually
quite small, if the creature is constructed properly.  In fact, in the
right conditions you need neither a brain nor sensors to run in a
stable manner.  This means that if you build the robot (or creature)
properly, the brain only needs to deal with unusual conditions.


Someone else asks if tripods can run:

Certainly.  I\'ve made physically realistic simulations of them, they
work just fine.  Think about how a dog runs if it loses a leg, too.


My hypothesis on what evolution will favor:

For our purposes... whatever you want.  There are enough arguments
any way.  Although you are unlikely to get one-legged hoppers, because
if something happens to their leg there is no backup.

Anyone have a guide as to how to set radiation zones for gas giants so that
it can be established which moons are beneath them, which in the zone, and
which are outside the zone?

For example Book 6 Scout states that Regina is a moon of a large gas giant
and orbits 55 radii out from the large gas giant. This would probably be
outside any radiation zone. However there is apparently a farming colony on
the moon Redes which orbits 3 radii from the same gas giant. Apart from the
possibility that this orbit may be rather irradiated the sesmic stress
factor of the moon must be enourmous.

I don\'t understand. Picture, say, a cheetah, the fastest land animal on Earth.
Why isn\'t that statically stable?

Or perhaps I should ask you to define "statically stable". To me, that means
that it will not topple over when at rest. Is that the wrong definition?

My point about the extra power required for extra legs was from the show. Either
I misunderstood the narrator, or he was just plain wrong.

Treating a pair of legs as a single, virtual, leg means you end up with a robot
that walks like an elephant: both legs on a side move in tandem. Now, there are
many creatures whose legs do not work this way. Now that I think of it, my cat
doesn\'t walk like that; each leg operates independently.

I don\'t know if there are advantages to having independent legs or not, but I
can see that the walking motion becomes much more complex when all legs move
independently. There must be an evolutionary advantage to having independent
legs. Anyone care to put forth an opinion?

> A hypothetical six-legged running robot would have the following
> qualities:
> 1. More parts to break.

Right. However, the original discussion was on creatures, not robots. I just
mentioned the show because I thought it was applicable. In a six-legged
creature, this point isn\'t a factor because

a) the body parts of living organisms tend to be more more durable than those of
machines
b) in cases where a) isn\'t true, natural selection will weed out those species

> 2. More redundancy.

Agreed.

> 3. Higher maximum speed, if you are willing to be less stable (running
> with three pairs of legs).

I think that this point suffers from the law of diminishing returns. There is a
huge increase in maximum speed when you go from one leg to two, a lesser one
when you jump to four legs, and it\'s probably minimal after that. 

This assumes that the legs do not move in tandem. If they move in tandem, then
you\'re not gaining much by adding legs.

> 4. Higher stability, at the cost of maximum speed (running with an

> 

Agreed.

Just so we\'re clear: I\'m no expert on this stuff, and am just venturing my
layman\'s opinion. I really enjoyed your thoughts on this topic.

Sure they can. It is possible for a mutant bird to be hatched

Because tripods, while stable when motionless, present a \'worst case\'
two-legged situation when walking. Two leggers are hard because of
balance, but they do balance because the can relatively easily keep the
center of gravity (cog) between the feet. With a tripod, you pick up one
foot, and you have two legs, with the cog removed from their geometric
center. Fall over. You are then acting more like a one-legged model.

They can work as a \'man-on-crutches\' model, but since two of the legs
are working in unison, that actually simplifies into a two legged model.
This also requires more flexibility in the design than current robots,
whihc was what the design study was about. A tripod being in \'man on
crutches\' mode could change direction astonishingly fast in 60 degree
angles, though.

Four and greater leg designs work because they can either simplify to a
two legged model with the correct cog (alternate legs off the ground) or
a tripod (one leg at a time off the ground)

Interesting, perhaps a useful trait for evasion. Also, could a tripodal critter
compensate for "Fall Down Syndrome" by using a counterweight? I am visualizing a
giraffe like "neck" on which might be it\'s sensory organs. Like an upside-down
pendulum.

I am loving these Xeno-bio posts, thanks to all of you wonderful folks with such
great ideas.

While for creatures that run (ie, having at some point of their movement no
legs on the ground) I can\'t see the advantage in having more than 4 legs,
for creatures that cannot run the limitation on speed is how fast they can
put one foot in front of the other. 

Creatures that cannot run are those who are too large, live on planets where
the gravity is too strong, or whose armour is too heavy for the creature to
safely lift it\'s entire body off the ground. Terrestrial examples include
Tortoises. For such creatures, the more legs the merrier. Take for example
the centipede or millipede... they walk with their legs moving in a wave
like motion, while some legs are pushing against the ground, others are in
various stages of lifting up, moving forward, and setting down. 

Remember not to look at terrestrial examples of life too closely... after
all, that monster in the deep ocean trench is your very distant cousin,
sharing a good portion of your DNA. An Alien would be just that... very
Alien.

My Traveller imagination, actually, is usually fueled by excess quantities of

Don\'t they, though? I\'ve told my players that there are no herbivores IMTU. All
creatures are carnivores that have developed a taste for human/Vargr flesh, even
if their digestive tracts can\'t handle it. Imagine the looks on their faces.

One day I\'ll tell \'em I\'m kidding.

Getting back to my second idea: Here are our brave adventurers, zipping along in
their air/raft at tree-top level. Unbeknownst to them, they fly right over ...

  Just so we\'re clear: I\'m no expert on this stuff, and am just venturing my

Thanks.
My responses will frequently talk about robots, rather than creatures,
but I believe they\'re still applicable.

  I don\'t understand. Picture, say, a cheetah, the fastest land animal on Earth.
  Why isn\'t that statically stable?

Because when it is running, it spends time airborne.  It may be
statically stable when standing still, but the important parts of a
cheeta\'s locomotion are when it is running.

  Or perhaps I should ask you to define "statically stable". To me, that means
  that it will not topple over when at rest. Is that the wrong definition?

Aaah.
"Statically stable": if it completely stops moving, it won\'t fall
over.  Examples: Cheeta standing still.  Four-legged robot which
always has three legs on the ground, and the center of mass over the
triangle formed by the grounded legs.  This isn\'t quite right,
actually, but the differences are irrelevant to the conversation.

"Dynamically stable": if it completely stops moving, it _will_ fall
over, but over time it takes actions which keep it from falling over.
Examples: Cheeta running.  Four-legged robot trotting (diagonal
pairs).


  My point about the extra power required for extra legs was from the show. Either
  I misunderstood the narrator, or he was just plain wrong. 

Maybe I\'ll go look at the videotape again.  But I suspect that either
you are misinterpreting the comment or it is out of context.

Think of it this way:
I have a four-legged robot.  It walks.
I add two legs, which wiggle back and forth but do nothing else.  The
added power requirement is the amount necessary to move the legs.
If you start putting weight on the new legs, you\'re taking it off the
old ones.

If you build the new legs right, the power required to move them is
extremely small.  If the robot moves consistently at a given pace, I
can add springs which will bounce the new legs back and forth at the
correct rate.  If the pace varies, I can add a more complicated system
which (essentially) allows the spring constants to be adjusted.

Nature cheats in this way, too.  If you take a human cadaver and swing its
leg, it swings at (approximately) a normal walking pace.

  Treating a pair of legs as a single, virtual, leg means you end up with a robot
  that walks like an elephant: both legs on a side move in tandem. Now, there are
  many creatures whose legs do not work this way. Now that I think of it, my cat
  doesn\'t walk like that; each leg operates independently.

Your cat trots (diagonal pairs) instead of pacing (left side, right
side) or bounding (front, back).  But that\'s still pairs.  Horses
gallop (rotary or transverse gallop); that\'s much like a bound, except
the legs don\'t quite come down together.  And under certain
circumstances the legs do act separately.

Yes, in nature the control systems are quite a bit more complicated.
Your cat knows how to climb through a window, and (if your cat is at
all like mine) open doors.  In fact, your cat probably knows how to
make more cats.  Comparing it to a research robot isn\'t quite fair. :>

But watch next time your cat comes running -- it\'ll either be
galloping, or trotting.  There\'s a definite pattern to the footfalls,
one which depends on speed and terrain.

And pay attention the next time _you_ run.  You\'re using the tendons
in your legs like springs.

  I don\'t know if there are advantages to having independent legs or not, but I
  can see that the walking motion becomes much more complex when all legs move
  independently. There must be an evolutionary advantage to having independent
  legs. Anyone care to put forth an opinion?

*grin*
Yes, there are advantages.  You can deal with non-level surfaces, you
can deal with unexpected forces, and so on.

  > A hypothetical six-legged running robot would have the following
  > qualities:
  > 1. More parts to break.

  Right. However, the original discussion was on creatures, not robots. I just
  mentioned the show because I thought it was applicable. In a six-legged
  creature, this point isn\'t a factor because

  a) the body parts of living organisms tend to be more more durable than those of
  machines
  b) in cases where a) isn\'t true, natural selection will weed out those species

Yes, but they still have to be metabolically maintained.

  > 3. Higher maximum speed, if you are willing to be less stable (running
  > with three pairs of legs).

  I think that this point suffers from the law of diminishing returns. There is a
  huge increase in maximum speed when you go from one leg to two, a lesser one
  when you jump to four legs, and it\'s probably minimal after that.

Depends on how much air time you\'re willing to tolerate, you are right.

  This assumes that the legs do not move in tandem. If they move in tandem, then
  you\'re not gaining much by adding legs.

Moving in tandem is point 4 - you gain stability - to which you agree.


The question I have:
Is the difference between 4 and 6 legs enough to actively select
_against_ six legs?  I\'m not sure.  For my trav universe, I\'m just
saying that Earth favors large 4-legged creatures by chance.

	- Robert Ringrose
	  ringrose@ascent.com

Tidbit:
Did you know that American cockroaches, when going really fast, end up
on four and then even two legs?  (mostly because their forelegs, and
then middle legs, are just too short to keep up)

Obtrav:
If you don\'t have grav vehicles, you want a walking tank for
situations like deserts and swamps.  You can put large pads on the
feet to put the weight on a larger surface area, and you can
completely enclose the leg in a flexible material, keeping the
sand/mud out of the mechanism.

Won\'t dynamic stability depend on an good inner ear (the correct
name totally escapes me at the moment)?  I\'m guessing without a
really good idea of the gravity vector (which way down is) and
where it is in relation to the COG, that the Cheetah would be
dynamically "unstable" and fall over if it leaned too far in a turn.

Might not Xenos from different environments have different
mechanisms for maintaining dynamic stability?  Instead
of the fluid-in-a-tube model of humans, perhaps something
that \'tunes\' them into their planet\'s magnetic field?  I don\'t
really know enough to speculate well on this subject.
What do aquatic animals use?

Presumably, robots would use gyro\'s to deal with this.

Personally, I hate bipedal robots in futuristic settings,
especially when they get to be building sized.  Androids,
I can live with.  But is that just a bipedally biased/humano-centric
view of robots?  I think the legs of a bipedal robot/android
must be, at a minimum, as flexible and useful as human legs to
be desirable.  If it can manage that, then grav. technology
would be more desirable.  So, IMO, robot legs need to be
better than human or not at all.

To a large extent I agree, but I expect it\'s for a slightly different
reason. I just don\'t like the Japanese mecha concept. Whenever you get
humanoid robots the size of buildings, you start to drift into that
territory.

That\'s if you focus simply on the legs, and not on the overall humanoid
structure and the advantages that can result from that form.

Before I start, keep in mind that contra-grav rules. Period. Once that
technology is introduced into a setting, there can be no comparable
technology. It replaces ground travel, air travel and sea travel. It
completely and utterly changes the face of warfare.

From the biological point of view humans, and many other primates, are
largely vertical creatures. This increases our ability to overcome vertical
obstacles. When faced with a cliff face, a human might climb it. A wolf
would have to go around it. On the same token, it\'s entirely possible that a
humanoid robot might be able to climb obstacles that other vehicles (even
vehicles with more legs) would have to go around. Of course, that\'s if the
huge robot is in the traditional mecha vein.

If the robot is in the traditional mecha vein, with hands and such, then
swapping weapons back and forth between units becomes much easier. On the
battlefield, a human being can drop a jammed, broken or empty weapon and
pick up one from his fallen comrade. Technically, you could pretty much do
the same thing with robotic arms mounted onto other types of vehicle
bodies...

However, powered armor is a part of many sci-fi campaigns, Traveller
included. Therefore, it\'s assumed that the technology exists for the sort of
controls that come naturally to your average soldier, person, whatever.
Scale that concept up to building sized and it\'s even easier than riding a
bike. Strap in, and you\'re literally off and running.

In addition, the form is very flexible. A group of guys inside big robots
can be dropped off on a world. They can move and carry ammunition, dig,
create entrenchments, move prefabricated building sections as easily as
children playing with blocks. Of course, this works both ways: A group of
guys inside big robots can smash and tear open entrenchments in close. The
can muck around with enemy buildings.

Further, if they move just like people, they can hit the dirt, take cover,
crawl, crouch, all of the different things that people do to avoid being
hit.

So, there\'s alot of utility with big humanoid robots.

Of course, there are some serious disadvantages. They\'re really vulnerable.
Knock out a leg and the big robot is down for the count. They\'re big,
relatively flat, vertical targets. If you catch one in open terrain and have
a good weapon that can take it out, you can obliterate it.

Of course, these are just the military applications of such a design. The
peacetime uses aren\'t half bad either. They\'d be useful for large
construction and demolition projects, for example. Really, you\'re only
limited by the tools you can devise for them to use. They could fill in for
dumptrucks, forklifts, backhoes, whatever you need, they\'d likely be able to
do.

As a conveyance, the bipedal robot loses out, no doubt about it. The
flexibility of the humanoid form, however, is where the real advantages
would come into play. At least that\'s the way I see it.

Speaking as a trained sniper, let me assure you that we do *not* sit down
and have an impromptu jam session to discuss our feelings after taking a
shot.  What we do is get the hell out of Dodge very carefully.  For some
reason, people dislike us, and have the amusing habit of not taking snipers
prisoner.

As for later.. we wouldn\'t be snipers if we had a problem with shooting and
killing.  We\'re not psychos, but we understand that we are professional
soldiers, and our job is to kill single targets using highly accurate rifle
fire at distances out to 1500 meters.

Interestingly enough, the Army did studies of combat infantrymen and found
that the mind set of most troops in combat is one of self-defense.  Even in
the attack, troops fight more out of a sense of self preservation than
anything else.

I had a conversation with a squid in Hawaii once.  When he found out I was
a sniper, he started waxing about Murder, Inc, and how we didn\'t fight
fair, etc. etc., I asked him what his MOS was.  He was a missileman on an
Ohio-class nuclear sub.  Evidently, carrying around more firepower than has
been used in all of human history and being ready to launch it on
population centers is more morally acceptable than crawling around with a
bolt-action rifle.

Rant over, back to Traveller.

Assume that those \'stabilizer legs\' are light, small, and retractable and
the large center leg is very muscular (due to it always moving and shaking
prey to death).  Although it would use its outrigger legs to move normally,
when startled, or when being chased, the creature folds up it outriggers and
pushes against the ground with its well-muscled mouth, and *bingo* - a
one-legged hopper!

Perhaps your review of the video will answer this question by doing a better job
of illustrating the disadvantages of 6 legs than I have done.

I can see an evolutionary advantage to six-legged creatures where the
consequences of losing stability are serious. Has anyone ever read Dragon\'s Egg,
by Robert Forward. That book, one of the best sci-fi stories ever written IMO,
details life on a neutron star. The consequences of falling over in a million-G
environment are very serious, and I would think that a six-legged creature would
have a natural advantage here.

The vehicle design rules in MT handle this method of locomotion. In fact, one of
my players is custom-designing a "bike" (which really shouldn\'t use that name,
since it has no wheels) for his character. For a while, he was seriously
considering putting legs on it, but gave up because he wanted sub-orbital
capabilities.

I like it! Now imagine that this creature uses this technique not only for
self-defense, but also for attacking larger animals by leaping on them.

I can just see my PC group with their "what\'s he going to do, nibble my bum?"

Not particularly ductile. Rough stuff to work, as it is hard and has a high
melting point. It\'s sheer resistance to deformation makes it popular for
mens wedding bands (at least amongst the oil-worker crowd crowd). The
melting point prevents it\'s use like early copper... much historical copper
was open smelted and poured into molds. Some tools were merely hammered
ores, but generally, most copper was smelted.

>3) Is there any possible reason for evolution to (seemingly ;) favor a

mild one, as I understand it: the bigger the critter, the more resources
required per limb; quadrapedal is stable enough for most purposes. HOWEVER,
had the fish that crawled ashore been 6 limbed, we\'d probably be arguing
the other way...

Let\'s compare a few bodyforms
2 arms, 2 legs: Tool use/food reach, poor stability, upright stance
2 arms 2 legs and tail: Upright stance, tool use/food reach, good stability.
4 legs: No tools, good stability, can function missing one limb. can
sometimes use upright stance for short periods.
6 legs: very stable, can function missing 2 or possibly three limbs.
Coordination problems increased.
4 legs and 2 arms: tool use/food reach, good stability, can function
missing a leg, potentially semi-upright stance (especially if equipped with
a balancing tail).

The problem is that early life forms probably didn\'t need a whol lot of
reach, nor tool use. So, then, does the increased mobility outweigh the
increased bio-energy costs of growing two extra limbs? For predators,
probably (think of GW\'s WH40K tyranids), but for herbivores, less useful.
For fish, the porbable source of limb layouts for land-life, 2 extra fins
wouldn\'t be that big an advantage....

Quite expensive I\'d say.

Not spines, but neural cords... From what little I\'ve seen &/or read, they

modified trilateral symmetry.

I have just come across an interesting book, which looks at the impact of

The book is by David Keys and is called \'Catastrophe: An investigation into
the origins of the modern world\'. It ties in the (UK) Channel 4 two part
series. The book details research into the possible domino effect of a
major volcanic event in the AD 500s which caused enough climatic impact to
have geo-political repercussions across the world. I\'ve only skimmed it so
far, but it looked quite interesting. The Independent carried an article a

Earth have four legs seems to be very much arguing from limited
experience.  All vertebrates have common ancestors and are constrained by
the limits placed on them by their ancestor\'s biology.  You can\'t simply
evolve another pair of legs, evolution doesn\'t work that way.  Parts can
be modified, but if you don\'t have the potential for X in your DNA your
offspring will never develop X.  Stephen J. Gould has numerous excellent
books on related topics, the one on Burgess shale life (call IIRC
_Wonderful Life_) is especially relevant.  His point is primarily that 
life looks as it does today largely through a combination of both chance 
and adaptation.  If teh chance resulst were a bit different, life today 
might look very odd indeed.

Given that both six and four legs work (examples of 6-legged locomotion
taken from arthropods and the comments regarding research at MIT) I think
we could expect both types of critters.  Also, since four legs usually
work better than two for walking I can easily see a whole Phyla of critter
which evolved with four walking legs and two other limbs which can
variously serve as mouth-parts, attack claws, grooming tools or
manipulators depending upon the species in question.  Instead of centaurs,
I would expect such creatures to look more like ordinary quadrupeds with
arms, but I\'m sure numerous other options are also possible. Given the
vast diversity of life on Earth, little would surprise me in the universe.

  Won\'t dynamic stability depend on an good inner ear (the correct
  name totally escapes me at the moment)?  I\'m guessing without a
  really good idea of the gravity vector (which way down is) and
  where it is in relation to the COG, that the Cheetah would be
  dynamically "unstable" and fall over if it leaned too far in a turn.

As usual, yes and no.
A Cheetah depends on its sense of balance.  It is built that way, to
operate on the edge of the running envelope.

However, it is possible to create a robot which runs (not walks, but
runs) on mostly flat terrain with no sensing.  This includes no sense
of "down".  You can even make it stable -- if you give it a moderate
push in any direction, it will come back to its previous motions.
Trust me on this, running made stupid was my doctoral thesis. :>

Of course that is an extreme no sensible animal will reach.  However,
I believe difficulties in sensing would simply cause the animals to
evolve into a state which depends less on the unreliable senses.  I
believe successful legged robots will be _built_ to be stable, even
while running.

  Presumably, robots would use gyro\'s to deal with this.

Gyros have two uses: sense down, and reorient the robot.  In a robot
such as the ones in the Leg Lab, it is only used for sensing because
it is a research lab.  In a production robot, I would expect any gyros
to be used for stabilization in an emergency, but not during normal
use.

  Personally, I hate bipedal robots in futuristic settings,
  especially when they get to be building sized.

Me too.

The greys and whatever we see in the literature today are (pick one): 
Hiver manipulations; disinformation produced by the shadow government to
distract Mulder and others from learning that the aliens are just as
human as we are; disinformation produced by the local Vilani governor
for the same purpose (his or her attitude is, "I don\'t have any real

I don\'t see why "the answer is so plainly obvious to everybody."  It
certainly is not obvious to me.  "Recoil" is the physical sensation one
feels when shooting a firearm, but the question also -- even primarily
- -- inquired about the sniper\'s emotional state.  That\'s a subject about
which the reporter (probably) has no personal knowledge, nor does her
audience.  

(I thought the answer was fair and concise; the sniper in effect said
that he feels only the physical sensation, and no emotion.)

My mother and her sisters can\'t wear a lot of metals (mostly copper, silver
and gold, iirc) because their skin turns green and black where the metal
touches after a time.  Its that hypo-allergenic whatsis.  Either that, or
we\'re part faerie folk and/or lycanthropes.  I think I have it too, but
I don\'t wear any rings or necklaces and never have.

Anyhoo, her latest husband (don\'t ask), had her wedding ring made of
platinum.  Pricey!!  Took him a good long time to even find the place
that would make it.

No foreign security commitments? Tell that to our chaps currently in Europe

armed forces have been part of _every_ UN operation.

Mind you, we\'re not worried about another American military invasion.
Figure you chaps learned you lesson the last time. (Besides, your economic
onvasion is working.)

Historical fact: during the world wars we had a greater proportion of our
population under arms, and converted more of our economy to wartime
production, than the US did. Of course, with less than ten percent of the
US population we were still outnumbered.

Perhaps I didn\'t make myself clear. This will be my last comment in the
thread not just because it\'s off topic, but it seems that every post gets
misunderstood ;)

David posted a message to the list, calling the question that the reporter
asked asinine. I questioned the asininity (TM) of the question.

In other words, I read the message at face value: I thought that what David
meant by saying the question was asinine was this: The question is a stupid
question. Generally, the only stupid questions are those that everyone knows
the answer to.

However, later in responding to Eris, I said that the question may have been
gauche: In other words, it\'s not the kind of question that someone should
just walk up and ask out of nowhere, as it is a potentially touchy subject.

I mentioned the possibility that David had meant the question was asinine in
that respect. He agreed. Misunderstanding is over.

To the best of my knowledge, nobody seems to be questioning the validity of
the question in and of itself, nor the validity of the SEAL\'s answer. Just a
misunderstanding based on imperfections in the language. ;)

And with proper "stack scrubbers" even stuff containing metals can be
dealt with. You wind up with an ash which might even be worth
re-processing for metals. 

Matter of fact, I\'m toying with a couple of real-life ideas for dealing
with certain medical wastes ("sharps", and dental x-ray film "backing")
that resembles this. Heat in a low/no oxygen until the organics start
to decompose (pyrolisis). The gases thus generated can often be
processed for fuel or even for producing oils/plastics. Once all the
organics are gone, feed in a reducing agent such as hydrogen to
scavenge the rest of the carbon, and reducing any metal oxides to
metal. Then process for the metals (iron in the case of "sharps" and
lead in the case of the film backing).

I think he\'s talking about *mining* the old landfills etc. Which *does*

Specifically, the site was *fine* until the *city* (county?) dug a
trench right thru the middle of it to lay a sewer line. Ignoring all
sorts of warnings on the maps in the process. My personal opinion is
that said city should have had to make the payoffs, not the companies
who\'d buried the wastes.

And non-fissionable radio-isotopes have a lot of uses too. Seperating
them out is actually a good idea. Use what you can, mix the rest into
blocks of "glass".

Nuclear dampers make cleanup easy for impact sites. Stuff that *burns*
up in the atmosphere is another matter.

But frankly, right now we can afford to encapsulate nuclear material
such that it\'ll hit the ground intact and stay that way. That\'s what
they\'ve done with the radio-isotope generators on probes to the outer
planets. 

Convert the waste into "glass": or other ceramic material, and give it
a good casing and you\'ll be able to dig it out of the crater, replace
the damaged casing, and re-ship it.

Such attitudes are common *now*. I seriously doubt that they\'ll survive
even 500 years from now, much less 3000.

> You can run but you can\'t hide from irrational fear.

But as centuries go by *without* the predicted disasters, the fear will
go away. Radiation will be about as feared as flooding or fire.
Something to worry about, and possibly a reason to avoid building in an
area with high hazard ratings, but not something to be paranoid about.
Remember, the fear of radiation is only a generation old. It *won\'t*
stay this virulent.

> These people have had

> zones perhaps a couple of centuries old on some planets.

Sorry, but the radioactivity from a blast won\'t last that long. Fission
by-products are no more radioactive than the original ore after 300
years. And fallout is pretty well dispersed. All the SF with high
radiation areas hundreds of years later is flat out *wrong*.

There\'s a simple rule of thumb involved here. The more radioactive
something is, the *shorter* the half-life. Radioactivity is measured in
Curies, which is basicly a measure of how many atoms decay per second.
Obviously, the longer the half-life, the fewer atoms decay in a given
time period. 

And once you\'ve got HEPlar or other efficient space drive, kinetic kill
ordinance becomes cheaper than nukes. And it doesn\'t leave
radioactivity. So a lot of those wars will have the *same* destruction
without the radioactivity.

At TL??? they get nuclear dampers, which can clean up any rad hazard easily.

> They "know" the

Again, you are basing attitudes *far* in the future on attitudes about
something a mere generation or two old. Attitudes *will* change.

And besides, they really *will* know the consequences. Not like now
where we have all sorts of folks giving different projections of what
*might* happen. 

I will note that 3-Mile Island had *more* things go wrong than even the
worst of the anti-nuke folks had put forth in any of their scenarios.
Yet instead of a major "China Syndrome" accident, we had a *minor*
radiation release. Chernobyl was about as bad as you can get short of
deliberately "dusting" an area with radio-isotopes. Yet the only *long
term* contamination is purely local. And this from a design that was
*criminally* negligient.

As the centuries go by, and it becomes obvious both how *rare*
accidents are and that they *aren\'t* the sort of "cosmic catastrophe"
that they\'ve been made out to be, folks will develope a *realistic*
attitude towards the hazards. It\'s inevitable.

Much less delta-V involved. Cost goes roughly as the *square* of the
required delta-V.

You can\'t use "terminal guidance" when attempting to hit a star. It\'ll
fry before you are close enough to be *sure*.  Making it hardere to fry
increases the cost greatly. 

And at least for a moon sized object, you *don\'t* need to soft-land the
wastes. Any container sturdy enough to survive an accidental re-entry
(however unlikely that is, I\'m sure the locals will require it) is
going to stay intact if you pick the right sort of trajectory for
impacting it. 

For an asteroid, you\'ll probably have some poor slobs who spend
six-month tours intercepting the incoming containers and placing them
in the tunnels on the asteroid.

And sooner or later, they\'ll want it for *something*. Just as an
example, the current *commercial* source for a couple of metals is the
"flue dust" from processing molybdenite ore in Arizona.

One other use would be to file off the world names, and use some of the

Hanging out with Moties? Speaking of which, they are ALIEN! Has anyone
else read "The Mote in God\'s Eye", and what opinions are there on
Moties? Does anyone use them in their campaign? And to get off the
Xeno-Bio topic, what about the way Jump Drives work in that book? I have
seen that unlike Traveller campaigns I have played in, many folks out
their insert their own Warp field/Stutterwarp/Jump drive rules or borrow
from other games. I like the added kink of needing to find the right
point to "jump" from(Anderson Point was it? Alderson?)

I myself lean towards quadraped and biped life being more common than
others, but I have yet to "run" a campaign. I usually just help my
Arbiter-of-the-moment with building up his/her setting. I like that
aspect even more than playing, actually! Soon I will put up a page with
some of my more interesting Traveller ideas.

Regarding crayfish I understand that they acually pick up a grain of sand

A point. Shoving it towards the sun is not complicated, but would require
careful aim. And imagine the liability suit if you missed!

To make my idea work, make the industrial world one with a fairly strong
environmental lobby and rampant lawyers. Waste is shipped to the low-tech
world for storage, incineration, or reprocessing. Messing manufacturing is
_also_ done at the low-tech world. Bhopal, anyone?

Not exactly. Natural selection will tend towards local maxima inside the
evolutionary phase space, but it won\'t necessarily be the most efficient.
Like the old joke with two guys and a bear, you don\'t have to outrun the
bear, just the other guy.

Again, not quite.

The bird might well breed even if it was at a disadvantage. Remember that
evolution works on averages, not individuals. Luck helps a lot.

As well, limbs are quite complicated. The chances of getting a whole new,
functional limb are small. Non-functional limbs are usually a definate
disadvantage (often crippling). Check out the latest Scientific American
for a small piece on multi-limbed frogs.



Two books you should read are:

"Dark Nature" by Lyall Watson

"Figments of Reality" by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen

"The Collapse of Chaos" by Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen

(OK, I lied. That\'s three books.)

All are good explanations of biology, aimed at the intelligent layman, with
lots of footnotes so you can hunt more technical information if you choose.

Watson is looking at sociobiology, specifically the biological component of
evil. Lots of interesting stuff there. For example, you know that cuckoos
flip other birds out of the nest when they hatch. Pretty complicated
behaviour. Turns out that many birds flip their siblings out of the nest!
(Those birds on the lawn that "tried to fly too soon" were actually the
runts, flipped out by their stringer siblings.) From the parents
standpoint, more babies is better. From the babies standpoint, fewer
siblings is better. Thus the evolutionary conflict. Hyenas are even more
interesting.

Stewart and Cohen are a mathematician and biologist, looking at evolution
and conciousness from two perspectives. Neat stuff. Cohen has a reputation
for designing interesting beasties for science fiction writers.

Not that it does the crawfish much good once you start to boil them. 
_Good_ eatin\'!

True story:  At my first National Guard drill after moving to Louisiana,
my unit held a crawfish boil for NCOs and officers.  I told a friend of
mine, "I\'ll eat these things, but you\'ll have to give me a block of
instruction first!"  Even now, after seven years here, I\'m only
proficient at Skill Level 1 crawfish eating (in other words, I _still_
haven\'t gotten up the nerve to suck the crawfish head).

ObTrav:  Unusual foods, that offworlders find disconcerting, disgusting,
and/or difficult.  IIRC, "crottled greeps" fill that niche in _The
Gripping Hand_.

I\'d use Sting, in the Sword Worlds subsector.  According to BtC, the
chlorine taint in the atmosphere tends to settle in low-lying areas. 
Sounds like a good place for making halogenated hydrocarbons, and the
atmosphere is _already_ tainted....

Sure, but those were re-entering from decaying orbits. Re-entry from a
botched transfer orbit would be faster.

Even so, the radio-isotope generators on US deep space probes *are*
designed to land *intact* in case of such an accident. You\'d just dig
them out of the hole in the ground and haul them to a waste storage
site. If they came down in the ocean, they\'re stable enough to just
leave there, though if you can locate them, the "gentler" impact might
leave them worth refurbishing.

Well, the good news is that the planet wouldn\'t be there when the dbris
cloud came back. Not the first time, anyway. 

The trick with hitting the star is that it takes *very* little sideways
velocity to turn an "impact" orbit into a "grazing" orbit.

Doesn\'t matter as only suicidal characters would try to land on such a
moon. For that matter, I don\'t think moons can have stable orbits if
the planet is that close to the star.

To check, figure out the force exerted on the moons by the star. Then
figure the force exerted by the planet. I\'m fairly sure that the result
will be overwhelmingly in favor of the star. Which means that the moons
would be lost at some point as the planet got closer to the star.

It\'s possible to calculate the day of a moon, but I haven\'t done it in
years.

Believe it or not, in terms of energy (delta-V) requirements, the star
is the *hardest* place in the system to reach! It\'s easier to reach
system escape velocity than to hit the star!

To go from one planet to another, you basicly have to supply the
difference in orbital velocities. To escape from the system, you need
to add (1-sqrt(2)) of the planet\'s orbital velocity to the orbital
velocity. To hit the star, you have to kill *all* of the planet\'s
orbital velocity. And *cost* is roughly proportional to the *square* of
the delta-V.

So for Earth:

trip		delta-V		relative cost
- ----	----	----
To Mars/Venus	~5-8 km/sec	1-2.6
system escape	~13 km/sec	6.8
solar impact	~30 km/sec	36

And for dumping on a planet, you don\'t need to "soft land" the waste.

Say you are starting from Earth. The earth is moving around the Sun at
about 30 km/sec. That\'s the tangential velocity (sideways). Depending
on the time of year, it might be moving in or out at maybe 1 km/sec
(radial velocity) because the orbit isn\'t a perfect circle. We\'ll
ignore that part.

So, if you kill 29 km/sec of that, it\'s still moving "sideways" at 1
km/sec. And moving radially at 0 km/sec. Now, the sun will start
pulling at it, so it\'ll move faster and faster towards the sun. But it
still has that sideways velocity. It\'ll take about 90 days to fall from
Earth orbit to the sun. So, in that 90 days, you\'ve got that 1 km/sec
sidways component working. Over 90 days, that adds up to almost 8
million km! The sun is only something like 600 *thousand* km radius. 

See the problem?

You can get the package to the sun quicker by adding a radial component
to the velocity, and that *will* reduce the effect of any remaining
tangential velocity. But it takes a *lot* of extra radial velocity to
make a difference.

Aaaagh.  This just isn\'t so, no matter how many of you say it :-).

Let me see if I can explain why the length of the moon\'s day is also
dependent on the orbital period of the gas giant around the primary
star.

Consider the Moon.  Its orbital period around the Earth -- that is, the
"sidereal month," the length of time it takes the Moon to complete
one 360-degree circuit -- is about 27 days, 8 hours.  How long is a
"day" on the Moon?  Well, we can tell that without having to actually
go there and time it.  Since the Moon always presents the same face
to the Earth, the lunar "day" must be equal to the time between one
full Moon and the next.  In that time, a point on the apparent center
of the Moon\'s surface will go from high noon through night and back
to high noon.

How long is the period between full Moons, the "synodic month"?
Turns out to be about 29 days, 12 hours.

The difference is because while the Moon orbits the Earth, the Earth
also orbits the Sun.  Both of these motions are in the same counter-
clockwise direction, if you\'re north of the plane of the ecliptic looking
back at the system.  So visualize this: at a given time, the Sun is
"straight up," and the Moon is on a line between the Earth and Sun.
It\'s now high noon on a point on the Moon directly opposite from the
Earth.  Start the clock running.  The Moon makes a 360-degree circuit
in one sidereal month, ending "straight up" from the Earth again -- but
the Earth has moved in the meantime, and is now somewhat above and
to the right of its earlier position.  As a result, the line between Earth
and Moon is now at an angle to the line from Earth and Sun, so the
point we marked earlier has not yet reached "high noon."  That takes
another couple of Earth-days to happen.

(Wish I could drop a decent animation into the e-mail at this point. :-)

The situation of the tide-locked moon of a gas giant is exactly the
same in this respect.  If the moon\'s orbital period is very short compared
to the gas giant\'s, then "one day equals one orbit" may be good enough
as an approximation.  If you want precision, though, you have to go
through a computation like the one in First In -- or like the formula Mr.
Buston gave a day or two ago, which ought to be mathematically
equivalent and is probably easier to work with.

I suspect that the "recoil" answer is given because it\'s not *possible*
to explain the feelings to someone who hasn\'t been there. And that\'s
why the question is asinine. Any sort of *meaningful* answer is far to
long and complex for a soundbite.

This is a sure bet? Is it because if the object hurled is hurled at any speed not
within a tight margin of error it won\'t come back at all, thus at the right speed
to enter orbit it has an orbital period similar to it\'s launch planet? Could this
cloud become a permanent or semi-perm system feature? I hope I am getting my
query across, sorry for sounding so disjointed. I know alot of variables are
still being left, open such as how much waste, what sort of world, steller type,
etc. I am sort of fishing, having caught scent of what may be great background.
Actually already is. Thanks!

But they can\'t have evolved from free-swimming fishes. You\'ve described
how we get such things as land-crabs and spiders. But exo-skeletons
*do* impose severe size limits. Especially if you need to molt the way
crabs do. You wind up limited by the maximum size that can survive out
of water *without* the support of the exoskeleton.

If you check, you\'ll find that *none* of the more than 4 limbed
critters have internal skeletons. The ones with external skeletons are
limited as above. The ones with no skeletons are even *more* limited.

What you\'ve got is the *ideal* case. The problem is that since *time*
is one of the "limited resources" in most triage situations, you have
to consider things like "should we *really* devote 12 man-hours to this
really bad case, or should we put him in group 3 and use the time to
save these other *12* people?"

There are similar arguments for other resources such as available blood
or plasma for transfusions.

There *will* be people that you *could* save, but only at the cost of
letting *several* other people die. That\'s why triage is so unpleasant.

This part I do agree with, it would be what sets you and other\'s in that
skill apart from the ordinary grunt.  As to how *every* sniper feels after a
kill away from danger, left to relax and think, well, I\'m sure that it is a
very different, personal thing for the individual (some perhaps thinking
that they are murderers [note: in the very extreme!!], other\'s thinking they
need a beer after a good days work, while some may think, "Damn!  What a
buzz!, and other thoughts and variations).

As a former assault trooper (mounted infantry), I personally admire the
skill, but where I could have been fielded with nine other\'s out of the back
of an APC and (in theory) fire off at dark shapes in the scrub to kill the
enemy, or at men charging at me trying to kill me back, I don\'t know if I
could get as "personal" in a me-on-one situation (as I see a sniper action)
and like it very much... different march, different drum.  And for the big
talkers who haven\'t been there, but say they could do it (snipe) without a
blink, I\'ll add that I have NOT had to fight for my country, I believe I
would perform on the battlefield as expected due to reflexes drilled into me
at the time plus a deep patriotic bond for my Australia... other than that,
I have no promises in all honesty, on how I would have reacted if I had to
do it?  It would be nice to say, "I love my country and will kill and die
for her anytime she asks" but, let\'s face it, history is full of people who
did say that (or similar) and never lived up to the boast when put to the
test!

The reason assault rifles became "the norm" was because tests showed that
bolt/auto rifles used in conflicts were being used at "average" ranges of
50m and that in the heat of a firefight, most if not all troops involved did
not aim the weapon, but pointed it in the general direction of the person
they wanted to kill (from the shoulder, un-aimed at a chosen target).  Why?
Because they were scared shitless!  There was a lot of noise and (in their
minds), a lot of lead flying about their heads trying to kill them!  In
otherwords, getting off more shots at the enemy than he could get at you for
the purpose of self preservation as you say.  This study was conducted
during the war, circa 1942 IIRC.

Of those who didn\'t fire un-amied at the enemy I should note, there was an
almost equal proportion of men sub-divided (from those who fired) into those
that hid and did not fire, those that hid and fired periodically, and those
that ran or otherwise removed themselves from imminent danger... which gets
back to the individual mindsets.

Yep, I started in Artillery!  I\'m pretty sure I would have been able to fire
over hills at targets I never knew what were what!  Although, during WWII,
there was a high incidence of bomber pilots and crew that suffered mental
problems from bombing faceless targets too!  We are complex animals...

That\'s actually what I meant. I should have said that evolution produces
a bunch of different designs, some good, some not. Natural selection
weeds out all but the most efficient of the ones produced, even though
there may be better designs that weren\'t produced.

If the bird\'s extra limbs prove to be hindering its ability to survive,
then the mutation will not last more than a few generations. I think
that\'s what your saying, and if it is, then we\'re in agreement.

The chances are small, but finite. And, over the course of millions of
years, the chance may appreciate enough to be significant.

I think we\'re in agreement here; we just phrase things differently.

Also we are discussing highly hypothetical situations involving a variety of
factors such as climate, planetary composition, size, distance from primary,
etc. Radiation increases the chance for mutation, and although I started off
being resistant to more legs evolving on an organism after it\'s general
morphology has been determined, I believe this is in part a terracentric
prejudice. Given a higher degree of radiation in an ecosystem, a large enough
population  and rapid enough procreation I might find it more believable. This
is a real dicey situation though, and we have no "real data" on
extra-terrestrial evolution.

Wonderful ideas though!

Well, unless evolution follows a *really* different path, life is still
going to start in the water and move onto land later.

We\'ve seen three cases of this on Earth (four if you count plants).

1. Arthopods moved onto the land from seaside areas. (Crabs, etc). 
2. Insects either moved onto the land or evovled from arthropods.
3. lungfish crawled between shallow lakes/puddles.

The first two are limited by exoskeletons. The third isn\'t. 

> Or in gas giants like the Jgd? 

Gas giants are effectively a *big* ocean, with no land. And no "bottom"
either, at least as far as dwellers in the regions humans might contact
are concerned. This is going to limit options a *lot*. Without "shallow
water", a *lot* of forms aren\'t going to evolve. Squid/nautilus type
critters are the only likely ones to have mainiplulatory appendages.
Alas, I suspect that they evolved from a bottom dwelling form such as
an octopus. 

For that matter, what is there to manipulate?

That\'s *armor*, not skeletal (ie support) materials.

And the trick required would be for a 6 or more limbed form to move

You will *not* find an insect that lives under Earth-like conditions
that has a point more than an inch from the surface of its body. That\'s
the max distance that air can diffuse thru the spiracles that insects
use for respiration. 

Spiders get bigger because they have a rudimentary form of lung.

Actually "chordate" refers to the spinal chord *not* the spine.

Do be aware that the Bode rules are one of many possible spacings that
fulfil a *required* condition. Simply put, no planet may have an orbit
whose period is related to that of another "near" orbit by an integer.
And simple fractions (2/3, 3/2, etc) are likely ruled out as well. 

The reason being that if (for example) there\'s a 2:1 relationship, that
means that every other orbit, the "inner" planet will be at closest
approach to the outer one AT THE SAME POINT IN ITS ORBIT. That means
that the gravitational effects on each other *add up*, resulting in one
or both of the bodies being shifted to a different orbit.

And during formation of a system, the initial dust cloud will wind up
with bands depleted oth material due to this effect as soon as the
first bodies start to form. Even the current (very thin!) asteroid belt
shows this sort of resonance gap behavior. It\'s also responsible the
gaps in Saturn\'s rings.

I don\'t have Kepler\'s Laws handy, but one of them relates the ratio of
orbital diameters to the ratio of orbital periods (As I recall, the
square of one equals the cube of the other). A bit of work with that
could likely produce a list of "forbidden" orbits in a system.

I thought the answer was simply "witty" and I liked it.  However, I also

  Vaguely related, I recall an old SF short of near-future lowish tech shipping
in the Solar System, where the critical hazard (IIRC) for the protagonist was
investigating the history of a debris field dumped overboard* from a distressed
vessel several decades before. This unknown drift or swarm of lead bricks* from
this freighter inflicted carnage on this transit, was then implicated in a past
disappearance (?), and could be charted if enough data could be gathered, which
included using informed guesswork to browbeat crucial admissions from one of
the few surviving ancients who knew the dreadful truth of their ships escape
from disaster.

 * yes, they dumped hundreds of lead bricks from their reactor shielding
  while at high relative velocity to much of the system. Anyone remember
  the various KKM discussions? :>  And, yes, this was illegal, too...

  The title (& author) escapes me, but IIRC the feature was called the
Sunflower Drift after the vessel. The authors name might have been White?

flight).

However, I agree that this is still a popular myth, even to a song "Who

The Moties are the Droyne.

All right, so the Droyne aren\'t THAT scary.

But I\'m sure that the Moties are at least the _inspiration_ for the Droyne.

My personal views on the TLs of these two other milieu would probably 
be closer to:

Star Wars: TL 17
Star Trek: TL 18

Both utilize alternate FTL travel methods.  Both have true AI
robots, hence the TL 17 minimum, but Star Trek seems a bit higher on
the TL scale than Star Wars.  Maybe not, but that\'s just my opinion.

is probably a better explanation of how FTL violates causality,
but once again the only way to violate causality in the 
Traveller universe is jump from a system that has a velocity
of 0, to a system that has a velocity of near C (.82C is what
is specifically mentioned). I don\'t think this is ever
possible, because said system would pass into another hex in
less than 4 years.

I was going to make some comments about such a jump, but it
has already been discussed enough.

And thank you and every other combat vet, past and present, retired and
active, on this list and off it, for volunteering to do the job and
accepting the
obligations it required of you.

Ladies and gentlemen, you are some of the people who make the human
species worth being part of.

This does lead me to ask a question.

Would any combat vet on this list mind sharing 
1) their reasons for joining the military
2) reasons they see for making the military a career.

I\'d appreciate it if you would also share the country/military branch you\'ve
had experience with so I can pick up any differences.

ObTrav: I\'m running a merchant/paramilitary  campaign and need to understand
the motivations for the career combat types.

For First In, yeah, there are some gaps.  As you might expect for such a
big (and rushed) project, there are plenty of minor errata -- but those will
be addressed by SJG once they come up.  There are also *lots* of places
where I chose one approach for simplicity or playability, but where other
choices might have been made.  Those might make good optional rules.
There are also lots of worldbuilding issues that I just didn\'t address in as
much detail as one might like.

I plan to build a First In web page with optional rules, more examples,
lessons in the pertinent science, links to good worldbuilding sites, and so
on.  How soon that happens depends entirely on how much time I have,
which at the moment isn\'t much.

I had to think a long time before posting this and I fully expect to get
toasted for it. However here goes. Why I joined the military? I was too
young and too stupid. I saw a "glamorous" career with real prospects.
Why I planned to make it a career? It seemed like a good idea at the
time. I saw a stable career with good prospects for advancement. Why
I left? I saw too many things its better not to see. Not talking about the
gory side of death and maiming, but the nasty side when a child clings
to their mother shaking with fear at the uniform you wear and the gun you
carry. The utter and total culture of expediancy that dominates the way
the military is used. I guess I found there was no honour or glory, just a
nasty vicious job.

Aha!  An interesting point, and to be honest I\'d completely forgotten about
resonances.  The situation won\'t come up too often with planetary orbits,
but I suspect it might be a good thing to check for when building satellite
systems.  Sounds to me like another good item to put on the web page.

Hi, Gordon Duke here,
Long time lurker, first time poster.

Couldn\'t you transform some of the tangential velocity by either deflecting
the container off of a stationary object or use a gravitational body such as
a moon to impart radial velocity?

Didn\'t NASA do a probe launch within the last year or so where they used the
moons gravitational well to impart some extra velocity on a probe?

A planet orbits a star in an elliptical orbit. Say something like a K5 main
sequence. A second star also orbits the primary say a K7 main sequence, also
in an ellipse.

What effect would the radiation from the companion do to the planet?

In the old World Builders handbook it gave a method of doing this assuming
all orbits were circular, but how about ellipses?
I want a planet that remains habitable but cold when the secondary is
furthest away, but very warm when it is at its closest, without actually
becomming completely uninhabitable.

B A L T I M O R E,   June 23 - Bell Labs scientists say
they have found what they believe is the limit for making
ever-smaller computer chips using current materials. 

Five atoms is the minimum thickness possible for the silicon
dioxide film at the heart of computers - a part of the
transistors that turn on and off at lightning speed, the
scientists report in Thursday\'s issue of the journal Nature. 

For practical purposes, the layer will have to be about twice
that thickness. Currently, the so-called gate oxide films used
are about 25 atoms thick, said Greg Timp, one of the study\'s
authors.

I\'m kinda proud of this one \'cause Bell Labs is a subsidiary
of Lucent. Not that *I* had anything to do with this but it\'s
still cool. The article has some great details such as a
10-atom wide chip would conceivably run at _at least_
10,000 MHz. The fastest we have today is 600 MHz.

Longstanding urban/suburban/rural legend, probably started by the mame

the nest, or otherwise near death anyway (baby birds will die of
starvation/thirst very quickly). If the baby bird is healthy, mama will

Not quite...female hyenas, particularly pack leaders have a high level
of testosterone, and behave like males, but there are no truly
hermaphroditic mammals, other than occasional mutants.

There is a subspecies of lizard, who reproduce asexually, but that was a
special case of a population that arose from only a few idividuals on an
isolated island. The same species on other islands reproduces sexually.
It seems that reptiles can turn on asexual reproduction if needed, it\'s
just rare that we have a poopulation large enough to observe yet
exclusively one sex.

>well, nevermind.

Sorry, that\'s another urban myth. (Veldt myth?)

"The sexes in spotted hyenas are so much alike that the only way you can be
certain that you do in fact have a pair is if they breed. Female hyenas
have a clitoris the same size as the male penis and equally erectile. Her
vaginal labia are fused to form a pseudoscrotum which is filled with fatty
bodies as large as male testicales. In every external respect the sexes are
identical and when two hyenas meet and go through a greeting display that
involves mutual sniffing and licking, both male and female genitals become
erect and the animals stand head to tail with one hind leg lifted in
precisely the same way...

"Spotted hyenas lead a complex social life in which females play the
dominant role. Clans of as many as seventy or eighty individuals are always
led by females, and all adult females are dominant to all adult males, who
leave the group when they reach puberty. Females assert their dominance by
being far more aggressive than the males at every stage of their lives,
producing of the most chilliung phenomena ever seen in any mammal.

"Hyenas usually have twins, which are well-developed at birth, completely
furred, eyes open, canine and incisor teeth fully erupted. This is true of
some other carnivores, but what makes the spotted hyena exceptional is that
within minutes of birth one of the cubs attacks its twin, sometimes
savaging a a brother or sister who has not even emerged from its amniotic
sac. If both offspring survive this pre-emptive strike, the battle begins
in ernest as \'the pair roll in a bitter embraces, each with the skin of the
other locked in its jaws\'.[131]

"This is not the normal rough and tumble of siblings at play. This is a
fight to the death between two baby animals scarcely an hour old...What is
disturbing about the hyena neonatal cpnflict is that it seems to be the
norm. Spotted hyenas nearly always have twins and seldom get to raise more
than a single cub, because the cubs themselves seem to be genetically
programmed to attack and kill their siblings on sight...

"...The fact that spotted hyenas do so routinely suggests that this loss is
one worth taking.It must be offset by an even larger gains elsewhere. But
where, exactly?

"...Laurence Frank has found that the cub that usually wins the murderous
battle in the den is female, and that if shee is the daughter of a
top-ranked female, she will inevitably replace her mother as head of the
clan. This is clearly something the genes would like, the kind of
continuity that they thrive on and seem to have contrived by a very simple
chemical device... Spotted hyena foetuses, no matter what their sex, have
levels of testosterone higher even than adult males... The result is bizare
genetalia, sexual confusion, and adult females so large, competent and
aggressive that they run a tight and genetically stable matriarchy."

According to some of the licensed SW source material, the Holonet
was somewhat limited - only major worlds would have Holonet
transmitters, during Old Republic days. When the Emperor took
over, he wanted a monopoly on instant insterstellar communications,
so he "borrowed" the vast majority of the Holonet transmitters and
installed them on the flagships of the Imperial Fleet. The remaining
installations were under Imperial control, on sector capital worlds 
and places like that.

Yes, it blows away X-Boats. It was also expensive, tempermental,
and power-hungry - you only saw them on kilometers-long Star
Destroyers and up. Recall in Empire Strikes Back, Vader had to move
his ship out of an asteroid belt to get a clear signal - perhaps it doesn\'t
even work on a planet\'s surface.

Well I knew it wasn\'t TRULY hermaphroditic, but they have odd, um, eh, er,

Well, I never saw any sort of action, and I\'m not career - but I\'ll take a stab.

I love my country (USA). I\'m not a blind patriot that believes there\'s nothing wrong 
with America - quite the contrary. Give me a soapbox and I\'ll talk your ear off about 
the things I think need changing. _BUT_, I love my country, and wouldn\'t want to live 
anywhere else. And I _have_ lived in and traveled to other countries (my parents worked 
for the government - we travelled around a lot)...so this isn\'t the viewpoint of 
someone who hasn\'t seen the "outside world"...

My interest in joining the military (Air Force) was twofold - to earn some money for my 
eventual trip to college, and to give something back to my country. I guess I think 
like the K\'Kree (ob Trav) - everyone should at one point do something for their 
country. Military service, civil service, or whatever - giving back a little. Was a 
prepared to give my life for my country? Well, I\'d like to think so - I asked myself 
that when I joined, and answered yes. Of course, you never know until you face the 
situation, which I never did. 

For the record, I was a medical discharge. Long story. However, I had decided I didn\'t 
want to be career - I didn\'t hate it, I just wanted to move on.

Why is a question asinine if it can\'t be answered meaningully in a

In the Real World, tidal heating does increase the surface temperatures of

I\'ve been toying with this my mind as I design a Traveller Campaign.
Stutterwarp has some interesting complications for in system travel.

One thing that occured to me in my pondering was that Stutterwarp ships,
since they do not accellerate in real-space, they are still affected by
gravity and do not thrust against it.  So, you need station-keeping
points, were ships use local gravitational forces to cancel out residual
motions...

. have you considered this effect for in-system travel?

. how about for inter-stellar relative motions?

OTOH, Star Wars does have FTL-capable small craft, and planetoid-sized

Luckily for Our Heroes, SW _doesn\'t_ appear to have fast FTL

IIRC, Fiji actually _does_ have more ground forces overseas in
peacekeeping forces than at home.  From what I understand, the money
paid to Fiji as compensation for providing peacekeepers is a major part
of the military budget.

You _know_ it will, though.  Let\'s face it:  For every Traveller player
who, upon hearing the word "Vargr", first thinks "Archduke Brzk", there
are ten who first think "corsair."  Add the Hollywood attitude deplored
by the Extraterrestrials For Media Equity to the mix, and you can\'t
_help_ but annoy the EME.

Let\'s just hope that they don\'t push for repeal of the Cassiopeian
Accord in response....

Only when they have more ground forces overseas, or off-planet, than

Some more thoughts:

Maximum time, per orbit, in eclipse for a tide locked moon is approximately:

   (diameter of GG / circumference of moons orbit) * moon day length

usually much less.

Note that First In says large moons orbit GGs in the 3 to 15 GG diameter range.
Earths moon orbits at 30 diameters and only gets eclipsed only every couple of
dozen rotations or so. Closer moons are eclipsed much more often. The inner
three of Jupiters four large moons get eclipsed every orbit (at 3 to 7.5
diameters).

Worlds orbiting GGs have bad jump masking problems. But then there is probably a
suitable unmasked moon, or three, beyond the GG 100D limit to use as a far port.

Hmm. The whole climatic domino effect in it is postulated to occur from a
major (>>Krakatoa scale vulcanic event in the Far East) which put out
enough ash to cause several years of drought and heavy rains in different
reason. In Africa this acts as a trigger to start the movement of rodents
bearing the bulbonic plague across Europe. Droughts in the East (China etc)
cause changes the political structure of the steppes and leads to a
barbarian invasion into Rome; there\'s also stuff on how the South American
climate changed and collapsed some societies. The author argues that the
vulcanic event resulted in a \'resynchronisation\' of history, and the birth
of much of the modern world.

It\'s interesting and plausible.

This is my Book 8/101 Robots translation of "The Luggage", from _The Colour

writeup at the moment.

And yes, it does have "lots of little legs", even if they are just for show

Personally, I think K-9 (see The K-9 Papers) is scarier, skill-wise. For
those interested, K-9 is a Book 8/101 Robots version, with dimensions taken
from the Dr Who blueprints book PLUS stats translated from the Dr Who

Only in the sense that it allows a chance for gas-giant moons to be
Europa-like or Io-like -- you can have ice moons with subsurface liquid-
water oceans, or sulfur moons.  I didn\'t come across anything quantitative
on how much effect tidal heating would have on surface temperature, so
the book doesn\'t go into it.  To be sure, I didn\'t look real hard.

Urrr.  That\'s a tough one.  I *think* I know how to approximate this, but I
want to go back and re-derive the formula for blackbody temperature in
the case of multiple heat sources before I hold forth on the subject.

The more I think about it, the more I suspect this really should have gone
in the book to begin with.  In *most* cases, a companion star is too far
away to have significant effect on the climate of a world in the life zone.
(That is, if it\'s too close then the planet can\'t form in the life zone at 
all.)
But there are exceptional cases.  There are also those "habitable moons
of gas giant" cases. . .and First In is currently silent on the heat output
of gas giants.

Ah, well.  More material for the web page :-).

Well started as a summer job (Resuve Force) to pay for school.
Never thought about having to kill any one, have not head to eather (thank
god)
Like to think I do my job when push come to shove, and thats what it is, a
job.
I may leave soon (the policical-infighting/empire building of senior NCO is
starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth), But I do love being out at sea
in the middle of a cloudless night ( the stars are increadable)

>>>[Thousands of years of continued occupancy implies some attempt at

Good point, many of the problems of today are the result of short sighted
thinking, to the next election, to the end of the next budget cycle etc.
If people or at least the powers that be had the sure knowledge that longer
term planning was in their vested interest i.e. 30, 50 or even 100 years
because they could expect to live that long or longer perhaps it would
foster such an ethos.  I doubt it though.   You will always have greed,
ignorance and dishonesty.

Picture this, a waste stream needs to be disposed yet the price of recycling
or proper disposal results in a red ink.  Someone comes a long and says for
a very low price I\'ll take the problem off your hands no fuss no muss.
Perhaps that someone looks legitimate and charges what appears to be what is
the legitimate market price yet they make an even better profit by improper
disposal.  I\'ve seen both circumstances.

Consider the following scenario,  I had Fed tell me just the other day of
this slick dodge.  Haz waste loads put in box cars and shipped to a distance
disposal/recycling site.   The load got to its destination and the listed
receiver refused the load because they hadn\'t contract to receive it and
didn\'t recognize the generator.   Investigations show the manifests to be
bogus.  The hauler was stuck holding the bag at approximately $1,000 a 55
gallon drum.  With a little thought it\'s an easy scenario to set up for some
unwary PCs in a merchant campaign.

Take another case, a company is going bankrupt and they have numerous
facilities that are being shut down.  Liquid waste at one facility is stock
piled, bulked in a tank and shipped of planet to a higher tech recycler.
Incompatible wastes are mixed in the process bulking the waste.  In route
chemical reactions produce both heat and gas.   Pressures build slowing in
space as the cargo hold is unheated.  Maybe it blows while the PC\'s are in
jump, maybe while they are in the next port.  Again this is an adaptation of
a modern example.   A load from the Southern  U.S. from a company going
under was shipped north for disposal.  It got about 7 hours north by tanker
truck when the tanker trailer took off like a rocket sled.  The trailer sans
the tractor went about a quarter of a mile before it stopped.

How about a different tack, perhaps the waste is generated as the result of
a criminal enterprise, the fabrication of some elicit drug as in a modern
meth lab.   As in the first example the criminals ship it off planet.  The
load gets where it supposed to go and there is no one to receive it.  The
PCs not wanting to be stuck with the cost of disposal contact the
authorities.   The "powers that be" get very interested.   The PC\'s get
"drafted" into helping out the investigation.

The above are just minor variations on a theme, if you want to work
environmental justice issues into a Traveller setting it would not be hard
to do at all.  All you would need to do is create the correct social
stratification and add a bit of greed, poor planning and apply the "law of
unintended consequences".

Yes, I have.  The actual adjustment of velocity and vector has to be
done with reaction drives and the use of gravity wells.  The ship\'s
astrogator has to develop a launch plan for the route out to and in
from the jump point where the ship can slowly change it\'s vector to
match its eventual destination.  IMTU, Stutter doesn\'t work in an
atmosphere (I don\'t have gravity affect them like in 2300AD), so
lifting and landing has to be done with a secondary drive as well.

This means that ships end up with 5 seperate drives. ;-> 

  1.  Jump for interstellar travel (1 to 6 pc/wk)
  
  2.  Stutter for intersystem travel (0.5 to 6+ kkm/sec)
  
  3.  Small HEPlaR, Fusion or chemical rockets (depending on TL) to
      adjust vector  (5 to 20 dv)
      
  4.  Anti-Grav or reaction rockets (depending on TL) to lift and
      land.  Anti-Grav works only very near a surface.  It
      complicates things a little, but *want* grav belts and
      air-rafts, darn it!  ;-)
  
  5.  Cold gas thrusters to alter the ship\'s attitude for things
      like docking in deep space.

You can combine 3 and 4 if you use reaction drives to lift and land.
The TNE way to handle this would be to have CG (instead of AG) to
negates most of the gravitational effect, but still requires a
reaction drive to provide the thrust.

 Naboo has at least two: one in the Palace and another on the Queen\'s
(rather small) Yacht.  The Trade Federation also makes shipbourne use of them.

 As for not having transporters, I would ask how Anakin\'s blood sample gets 
back to the Yacht...

 No, Star Wars is probably about equal to or better than Star Trek Next Gen, 
but has been there a VERY long time. The general lack of large-scale 
antimatter production/use (as far as we can tell) means that the Star Wars 
universe doesn\'t use energy-hungry toys like transporters. Things like 
gravitics, high-octane magnetically-steered jet engines, FTL drives, and AI 
robots are all CASUAL tech in the Star Wars universe.  Consider the things 
that Han Solo and Anakin both do without a second thought. Consider that 
Queen Amidala\'s yacht has a complete hyperdrive replacement done in (roughly) 
two hours, and that they found the replacement drive IN A JUNKYARD.  C-3PO 
and R2 are both more sentient than the computer aboard the Enterprise-E 
(though not necessarily better educated), and are closer to human than Data 
is.

 Star Wars is only perceived to be lower tech than Star Trek because, in 
general, the Star Wars universe tech is declining while the Star Trek 
universe tech is still advancing.

Indeed. Once you stop the "one star per hex at its middle" design, why not
just record the coordinates, throwaway the hexes and do all sums with a

Observation: While dinking around with hex paper and polyhedrons, I noticed that
apparently twenty tetrahedrons make an icosahedron, and as far as I can tell
this can be continued as a pattern out from each exterior point making twelve
more icosahedrons intersecting the first, and so on. If you consider each of
those points to be a "space", you can map them on multiple layers of hex paper.
Each sheet must alternate so that two held up to the light show a pattern like
that Escheresque cube inversion we all doodle while on the phone(well, I do),
and three held to the light appear as isometric paper. You could add depth to
your galaxy too, but astrogation will involve more page turning. Might work
better with transparencies.

I would, but I suck at math, and have no clue how to calculate all that. Is
there any programs out there to do this? Mac preferably, although I do have

In 2D, the easiest solution for roleplay use (IMO) is to printout
your map at 1cm = 1 parsec and then measure distances using a ruler.
(Or 1/2" = 1 parsec depending on locally available rulers. :-)

The formula is quite simple.

If FIRST_STAR has coordinates (a,b,c) and SECOND_STAR has coordinates (x,y,z)
the distance between them is:

	square root((a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2 + (c-z)^2)

(for 2D, just assume c & z are 0.)

Jo Grant has a nifty little PC program called CHview at
ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/chview/

It doesn\'t use hexes at all, but you can represent systems in 3D and it
automatically calculates distance in light years (I think).

It\'s not that big a program and probably would work under a virtual PC
(depending on the way it handles the display, I would guess).

The Trade Fed had one in the flagship of a planetary conquest force,

Very good point. This backdrop of  old technology adds an interesting flavor

decline of the old and the birth of the new, and the "feel" of the technology
is part of that.

Thank you, thank you. I\'m glad I helped make someone else spew. As for me, I had
a delayed reaction to that one. Because of a busy work day, that one didn\'t
really sink in until later that evening. I started laughing uncontrollably that
evening, and couldn\'t tell my wife why because she\'s a player in my game (and
I\'ll probably use this beast).

At Ft. Benning, my spotter and I were working a patrol of IOBC (Infantry
Officer Basic Course) students.  These are guys who have been commissioned,
but still have to learn how to be infantry types.

We were trying to figure out who was in charge (does the term Chinese Fire
Drill mean anything to y\'all), when Gordon told me to look in a certain
direction.  "Tell me that I\'m not seeing this."  Since I had much better
magnification on the scope than he had on the binocs, I obliged.

And there he was.  About 40m away from the rest of the patrol, and behind
some trees, one of the LTs had decided to stop and..  ummmm... enjoy the
view.  With his pants around his ankles.  I kid you not.

This was too good to pass up.  I picked the target closest to our friend,
and shot him (MILES laser tag system) this of course set off an immediate
action drill.  I then started peppering the wanker with near misses, just
enough to make his buzzer make bleeping noises that said that a bullet had
passed close enough to hear.

Sure enough, the rest of the patrol ran towards the guy, and found him
cowering in the dirt, BDUs still wrapped up in his boots.  The laughter was
clear even at 200m.

It\'s not that difficult to believe that one mindset might differ from
another in the arena of medicine. In addition, there might be some stigma
attached to geneering and wetware in the Star Wars universe and we don\'t
have all the facts. After all, the Clone Wars are a part of the history of
that universe. Perhaps wetware smacks of the technology that the Empire used
to climb to power. I\'ve always imagined that the Storm Troopers were clones,
and that the Clone Wars got their name from this... the first time clones
were used on a large scale in battle.

I\'ve never been fond of the idea that Annakin Skywalker had fallen into a
volcano and that\'s why he needs an extensive cybernetic life support system.
I always thought that it was more traditional than that. Simply put: a guy
in black armor is inherently more evil by at least an order of magnitude.
However, I\'ve also always figured that the dark side is a corrupting
influence, and Vader\'s condition is a result of this. Maybe even with a
series of genetic repairs the dark side continues to corrupt and warp his
body.

Not trying to handwave things away here or anything, there just might be
other factors that we\'re not privvy to. The mindset of the Empire might be
one that certain technologies are corrupting influences.

For a more in-depth look at a concept like this, I can\'t recommend Bruce
Sterling\'s Schismatrix enough. I just finished it last night and my head\'s
still swimming thinking of all of the possibilities. For the uninitiated:
Sterling\'s Shaper / Mechanist universe details a complex future history in
which mankind ventures into the solar system and is quickly factionalized by
two divergent technologies. The Mechanist faction favors electro-mechanical
life support and life extension technologies while the Shaper faction favors
wetware and genetic engineering.

My oversimplified synopsis of the Shaper / Mechanist universe does not
nearly do it justice, as there is so much more depth to it. I highly advise
it. I also read Heinlein\'s The Moon is a Harsh Mistress this week, and the
two books are merging in my mind and will likely influence my own Traveller
campaigns heavily.

"Well, unless evolution follows a *really* different path,

	No argument there. It is hard (though perhaps not
	impossible) to imagine life evolving without a solvent
	such as water.

"We\'ve seen three cases of this on Earth (four if you count 
plants).

1. Arthopods moved onto the land from seaside areas. (Crabs, etc). 
2. Insects either moved onto the land or evovled from arthropods.
3. lungfish crawled between shallow lakes/puddles.

The first two are limited by exoskeletons. The third isn\'t."

	"Plants" may have colonized terrestrial environments more 
	than once, though the early colonizers did not seem to
	fossilize well. Insects are arthropods, but I\'m not sure
	what you mean by "limited by exoskeletons." Exo- and
	Endo- skeletons have advantages and disadvantages.

"Gas giants are effectively a *big* ocean, with no land. And no 
"bottom" either, at least as far as dwellers in the regions 
humans might contact are concerned. This is going to limit 
options a *lot*. Without "shallow water", a *lot* of forms 
aren\'t going to evolve. Squid/nautilus type critters are the 
only likely ones to have mainiplulatory appendages. Alas, I 
suspect that they evolved from a bottom dwelling form such as an 
octopus.

For that matter, what is there to manipulate?"

	Materials trapped in huge floating mats of vegetation,
	tangled webs of vines with helium bladders. Haven\'t you
	ever had to clean out your skimming funnel?  ;)

"> But how about a catfish like critter which evolves 
prehensile whiskers?

Ok, it\'s a possibility. But so is an Elephant. :-)"

	And we do have elephants. :)

"> Is there any reason endoskeletons exclude exoskelotons? The 
terrapins
> come to mind, as do armadillos.

That\'s *armor*, not skeletal (ie support) materials.

And the trick required would be for a 6 or more limbed form 
to move from *exo*-skeletal to endo-skeletal. That\'s *really* 
unlikely."

	Such an evolutionary change is unlikely, which is why
	the prevalence of endoskeletons in large Terran animals
	may be absent on some worlds.

"You will *not* find an insect that lives under Earth-like 
conditions that has a point more than an inch from the 
surface of its body. That\'s the max distance that air can 
diffuse thru the spiracles that insects use for respiration."

	Once again, the question should not be "what do we have
	on Terra?" For your information, there is active movement
	of air in and out of insect trachea (the spiracles are
	just the openings of the trachea). I have no doubt that
	the size of animals with respiratory systems like insects
	is limited, but I\'m not sure that even the largest insects
	that have walked our planet represent that limit. In any 
	event, there is no reason that an animal with an 
	exoskeleton has to have an insect\'s respiratory system.
	In fact, there is no reason that I have seen that an
	animal with more than 4 legs has to have an exoskeleton.

Spiders get bigger because they have a rudimentary form of lung.

	Are the biggest spiders bigger than the biggest insects?

I\'m going to assume you\'ve not been to my site yet.  It\'s at:

Reavers\' Deep is one of my all-time favorite areas.  <grin>

Simple.  The Marlheimers are intent on conquering anything they can get their hands on.  Ma is for \'Grand Duchy of Marlheim\'.  Not exactly the nicest place in space to hang out in.  The local military is *VERY* triggerhappy and territorial.

The forbidden orbital zones will probably prevent there being a planet in the
hab zone of the primary in any binary close enough for the second star to make a
difference to the planet temp. 

Maybe it would work around the secondary though, but only if the stars were of
very different sizes, say F0/M0.

How about a binary system where the small secondary star has a planet in its
life-zone. The secondarys orbit ellipse crosses the life zone of the primary.

Or the secondary has a planet outside its very small life zone but its orbital
extremes fall within the life zone of the primary. Needs to be a non-eccentric
orbit of the secondary for this to work. What seasons that planet would have...

Probably not generalized, but just last night I saw a show on TLC
regarding a herpetologist who was quite surprised when his grown,
handraised female rattlesnake gave birth to a male offspring. Uhh, did I
mention that the snake in question had lived its entire life in a glass
aquarium in his lab out of contact with other snakes? They\'re waiting
for the male to reach sexual maturity to see if it is fertile. If so,
this has BIG implications for rattlesnake population studies...

I would be surprised if it were a generalized trait of all reptiles, but
I\'ll be equally surprised if parthenogenesis _isn\'t_ more widespread in
reptile populations that we currently think...they\'re not exactly the
most well-studied critters on the planet...

You could do that, and then to make it easier to figure out jump distances
you could draw range bands around all stars that are within one parsec of
each other. Then, because all systems that are within one parsec take
exactly the same time to travel to, you could move the stars to equidistant
points to represent their equal travel time. Do the same thing with all
stars that are more than one parsec but less than two parsecs distant. Draw
the "range bands" as hexagons and you get... exactly the same star maps you
started with.

To find distance from a to be with 3d coordinates:

D=([(Xa-Xb)^2]+[(Ya-Yb)^2]+[(Za-Zb)^2])^.5

But, if you really want it, I can bang out an ugly text-interface Mac
Application in a few hours, sometime next week (private email only,
please.. I\'ll be gone all weekend). Or, if you have excell, layout your top
4 rows and left 4 collums with the name and coordinates, and in e5, input
the following formula:
	=sqrt((($b5-e$2)^2)+(($c5-e$3)^2)+(($d5-e$4)^2))
This assumes row 1 and Collumn A are names
2 and b are X coords
3 and C are Y
4 and D are Z.
You can fill down and right; this formula is specifically keyed for filling
(that\'s what all the dollar signs are for). In lotus, it is very similar
(altho I haven\'t touched lotus in years).

I will take them out of the hexagons. The 3D starmaps I have been looking at
have been making MTU look foolish, so eventually every star will be (x,y,z)
with ME being (0,0,0) of course. I was just thinking of using the hex as a
standard "world exists within this parsec" test.

I didn\'t figure on range bands ala TNEC
(http://www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/traveller), I figured on connecting every
one jump star with a red line, two jump stars with blue lines, etc...
Of course, we are at TL9 IMTU, so it will be a while before jump-2 becomes
available. An example of this (7 parsecs around earth) is at
http://www.rmharris.com/pub/nyrath/closegal.gif, and of course starmap.html
in the same directory is where most of my nutty ideas are coming from. 

Now I see there is a 3dstarmaps thread, I will have to go read it!

Hmm, I didn\'t get all the specifics, but a quick search on yahoo with

But that was the whole point of the novel.. the Moties, if let out of the

I roll 48 on D100, so I add (48-50 * .01) or -0.02 to the Y value

Amho (actually a binary G8 V / K0 V system with one gas giant) is now

I am thinking 1 parsec is the max.

My next question becomes what are some reasonable rules for adding depth to
a starmap? It would seem to me that you would want to change the density
rules to make the roll for system presence harder, then generate a cube,
say 7*7*7. (Would this mean system presence would be 7 times harder?). My 
other thought is to make system presence easier, and while I might generate
several systems in the same \'hex\', they would get moved up or down (on the
Z axis).

Finally, I am thinking about loading the gliese3 data into a database, and
coming up with some statistics based on that.

Maybe I\'ll just stick with 2D for now...

Great site Rob, thanks. From my understanding, it is not necessary to jump
between systems that have a near-c relative velocity, but only that
interactions between systems take place at near-c relative velocities. For
example, communicating with a starship that travels at a high speed.

Objects moving relative to each other have different time/spaces axes.
Everyone knows that time and distance of a moving object are dilated
relative to a stationary observer, but apparently simultaniety is also
broken. For example, an event A that happens before event B in my frame of
reference may happen after B in a reference frame dilated by a high
relative velocity. Note this does not mean that the other observer merely
sees light from event B first, from that frame of reference it *really
happens first*. Normally this does not cause any paradoxes because the two
reference frames have separate "light cones"; regions of their time/spaces
axes they can interact with. So whereas the second observer will see B
before the first observer sees A, he cannot communicate that information to
the first observer until that observer also sees B. I don\'t understand the
mathematics, but apparently this is not some kind of coincidence but a
necessary result of the speed of light being the same in all frames of
reference. You can\'t interact with objects in the future, or at a distance,
because they are outside your light cone. Causality is maintained because
two observers who observe conflicting sequences of events must move into a
consistent light cone to be able to communicate. The sequence in this third
light cone may not agree with their observations, but it is consistent.

But FTL travel breaks all this. FTL travel lets you interact with events
outside your light cone; you will be able to observe events before they
happen.

So what does this have to do with Traveller? Well, you can now use jump
drive to get rich. Find some pair of planets which exchange time-sensitive
data; for example, stock quotes, news stories, or battle plans. Call the
point in space/time where your ship is on one planet event A.  Call the
event where the stock quote (or whatever) is revealed point B in space/time
such that from the first planet\'s frame of reference A happens before B.
Now, figure out a time axis where B happens before A. You will probably
need a velocity close to c to do this, but it\'s possible. Now start
following that trajectory, and have someone radio the time-critical data to
you at B as you pass by at 0.9c. Now from your frame of reference, A is in
the future, but to travel there or send a signal you have to move into the
other planet\'s light cone, which according to relativity must take longer
than the time between A and B. Or it would, if you didn\'t have jump drive.
With jump drive you can short-cut the normal flow of time and move directly
into the other planet\'s light cone and transmit the data you got at B. From
your frame of reference you exchanged information between two strongly
time-dilated planets. But from A\'s frame of reference they get information
from the future. Not a prediction, mind you, or information from an
alternate universe, but from an actual point in space/time from its future
light cone.

Nature of film/TV.  Realistic infantry combat would involve a flurry of
shots, each side throwing smoke, and calling in artillery.

Also, television and film have to tone down what really happens when you
shot someone.  Imagine the sequence when the Stormtroopers break into
Leia\'s ship in the early parts of SW:ANH.  Instead of that tidy little
corridor, imagine rebel troops half-burned, loose organs spilled onto the
deck, a mutilated Stormtrooper screaming for his mother.. sort of loses the
space opera touch..

That\'s part of the reason Saving Private Ryan was so acclaimed by combat
vets.  It\'s probably the first film to deal so graphically with the
absolute charnel house nature of war.  A friend remarked that given the
mediocre nature of the rest of the film, SPR was probably the only film
ever to win Best Picture on the strength of one scene.

In the character template I\'m doing for Imperial Marines (part of my work
for the G:T Ground Forces book, which I hope to be writing), I\'m having a
hard time justifying given many traditional infantry skills to the Marines.
 These guys fight in Battle dress, and would probably only learn to fire a
rifle as sort a precursor to the *real* training.  A Marine out of his
armor might even have Combat Paralysis from being "naked" when combat
breaks out.  He\'s seen what happens to unarmored bodies.

I will have to disagree here.  Several points.

Number 1. Not every use of marines will involve 
battle dress. In less dangerous environs, the marines will be armed 
with lesser weapons and in body armor. Not every job for them will 
be one that combat is expected. They had best be able to handle 
trouble in that state.

Number 2. The battle dress is expensive. Perhaps only some of the 
contingent of marines in a garrison will have battledress. 

Number 3. In a safe zone, marines could be attacked by surprise. 
It would look really bad for the Emperor\'s best to be trashed by 
some unarmored schmucks.

I have served in the airborne. So my viewpoint is colored by what 
I know. That may not be the same view that others have.

Perhaps I should shut up, and I usually do, but this must be my month to pop
my head up.

In my current campaign there is a distinctly early-Asimovian flavor.  There
are no alien intelligence\'s, no ancient manipulators.  Human colonization of
the stars began slowly because it was found, in star-system after
star-system, that nothing living exists off of Terra.  Every world is a
"Terra-formed" world.  All life forms, no matter how mutated from their
original forms, began on earth.  Earthmen expanded their domains in the new
frontiers, until expansion could not be sustained any longer.  The empire of
man throbbed, expanding and contracting, until it reached intergalactic
space and could no longer expand exponentially.  Then it began to collapse.
See a Foundation tie in here?  Not surprising.  But the reason that I have
chosen this background is rather simple.  History repeats, for one.  But
more importantly, according to statistics, that _is_ most-likely the actual
situation.  The odds of life existing are remote in the first place.  The
odds of there being two planets in this galaxy with life on them is
staggering.  Jumping off from there, I\'m trying to explore what humankind
might be able to do with all of this real estate!

BTW, this milieu is in it\'s infancy.  If you are interested, take a peek at
http://www.downport.com/pbem to see how the play-by-e-mail game is going.
Please bear in mind that it has been close to twenty years since I created a
new universe from scratch.  It seems much harder, now. ;-)

I also have a Un-OTU, and I am trying to base it as much upon reality
as possible. Life exists on many systems, but getting above the 
pennsylvanian era (IIRC: plants, insects, and fish) is rare, getting any
intelligent life is very very rare (out of 442 worlds I generated (1 
sector) there were 15 intelligent species, 9 of them had already done
themselves in (you know: nuclear wars; greenhouse gases; overpopulation
and food riots), 5 of them had low tech, and 1 was a spacefaring,
pre-interstellar system. I tend to think this is a little high, but the
rest of them may still do themselves in. After all, if there are so
many intelligent beings out there, why haven\'t they radioed us yet?

On the other hand, the particular Gas Giant that my homeworld orbits
around has several planets that support life, three of them have 
intelligent beings. Perhaps they seeded each other somehow?

My thought was that I cannot use FTL to communicate with a _ship_ moving
at near C. I can only jump from system to system at near C velocities.

I myself also do not get the math, but it seems to me that if I travel 
past a world and recieve a message, all this is taking place within
the light cone. Now I jump to a system (FTL travel) moving at close to 0
relative to my origin and radio that information to them. I don\'t see
this as disrupting anything. The only questions I have are - is the jump
week relative to the ship, or to the system?

Of course, in the real world it would take 3.24 years to get the
information, but if the 1 week jump is 1 week relative to the system,
then it takes just as long to transmit the information in a near C 
ship as it does in a 0 speed ship.

I hope I am making sense, \'cause all I did was read Feynman & Hawkings,

That\'s the Army\'s job.  The Army is the force you send in for peacekeeping,
internal security all that rot.  The Marines are a pure shock and combat
force.  They are nothing but kick ass.  Tell a Marine to be subtle and
he\'ll refrain from using micronukes.

In short the Imperial Marine Force is the ultimate level of Imperial
intervention.  When they come in, just their presence can stop rebellions
in their tracts.

One of the sidebars I\'ve composed has a Marine fire team popping a
micronuke on a single sniper.. an observer in the command craft wonders why
the excessive firepower was used, when the rifle the sniper had couldn\'t
even scar the Marine armor.

The Force Ensign in charge explained that the witnesses to the event would
tell everyone that not only is resistance futile, but extremely deadly to
boot, and that the Marines will be able to mop up without having to inflict
massive casualties.

>Number 2. The battle dress is expensive. Perhaps only some of the

When not on combat deployments, they wear some sort of utility/fatigue
uniform.

The Imperium can easily afford to equip the 5000 or so Marines in each
subsector.  Assume that Marine Assault BD costs about Cr. 500,00 with
weapons.  That\'s 2.5 billion credits per subsector.  Easily raised by the
Imperium.

>Number 3. In a safe zone, marines could be attacked by surprise. 
>It would look really bad for the Emperor\'s best to be trashed by

That\'s why they are used only as assault troops.  Army troops do the
consolidation thing.  

They do have weapons for self defense, but they don\'t train in combat ops
the way the Army does.  Think of them as tankers.. they are lost outside
their vehicles, with minimal training on what to do if their vehicle is
disabled.

Marines on Embassy duty stand in their best class As and look impressive.
When the Embassy is threatened they do don items like CES and use shotguns,
but Embassy duty is a special case.  The vast majority of the Fleet Marines
only use battledress in combat, and that could leave a Marine forced to
fight without it with a bad case of the shakes.

Quite true, especially your last point (calling for artillery).  IMHO,
anyone who, given choices of Traveller skills, generates a combat-arms
character (rank E5 or above) without Forward Observer skill is
criminally negilgent.

Some ways to justify traditional infantry training for Imperial Marines:

1.  "First In."  Marines often perform deep recon missions, in support
of Fleet operations.  It\'s much easier to hide and observe if one can
function without Battledress.

2.  "Show the Flag."  In peacetime, Marines may be sent to wavering
client states, as a show both of force and of support.  Such deployments
are essentially diplomatic in nature, and thus under the direction of
the Imperial Foreign Service (or whatever analogue YTU possesses). 
Often, diplomatic concerns preclude the use of battledress, for fear of
overly frightening the locals.  (see "Somalia, lack of armored vehicles"
for a 20th century equivalent)

3.  Raiding.  Some raids, such as those performed by the Roughnecks in
Heinlein\'s novel _Starship Troopers_ [not to be confused with the
erroneously- titled movie], are best conducted by battlesuited troops. 
("Put them all to the sword; the Good Lord will know His own.")  Raids
that require stealth, OTOH, need troops that can operate without wearing
anthropomorphic tin cans.

Having presented these points, I still like your idea of including the
Combat Paralysis disadvantage (at reduced points, since it only applies
when the character is not in battledress) as a possible disadvantage in
a Marine template.

Either

It boils back to the sensors available for locomotion - tilt-sensors, etc,
for a biped.  We move other body parts to keep our cog stable (within
certain parameters) at different rates.  An example excluding one of these
sensors would be to spin on your fancy new office chair for a few seconds,
then try to stand up.

Single, horizontally or diagonally opposed legs moving in tandem, depending
on speed.  Standing still is standing still, obviously.  Slow movement is
one-leg-at-a-time.  Faster movement \'trotting\' can be diagonally or
horizontally joined.  Sprinting is generally horizontally opposed, back legs
pushing then front legs pulling with a major lump of back movement in the
middle.  Directional agility is a little limited though.

Different speeds with grace, I guess.  Just speeding up a two-virtual-legged
operation won\'t necessarily work since some movement equations will scale
differently to others.  Everything must use the minimal amount of energy to
get the job done.

Thats the point though - why have more legs if they move in tandem? Have
more legs and make them move independantly, thus increasing their usability.
The front legs can be used for other things while still being statically
stable on unstable terrain. (Imagine a goat with arms, on a mountainside).

> Agreed.

What about other factors, not just movement.  Hiding, for instance.
Climbing?  Attack prowess?  A biped can hide a lot of power in a small area
(as can a quadraped, if you\'ve ever tried to hold a cat that doesn\'t want to
be held...  diminishing returns again).

Having a brother who continually harasses me for electronic designs for
robots means I read lots about robots (note: reading lots doesn\'t make me an
expert!).  A recent cool idea is movement using single-direction pull and
spring return actuators.  A ductile material that when power (heat) is
applied actually shrinks.  I think it was subject to metal fatigue though.
Keeping tension for a bidirectional actuator would be fun, too.

Another one is a polymer gel that swells and contracts in response to
chemical stimuli.  Some israli scientists discovered it in the late 40\'s.
"The fiber bundles shrink when the solution they\'re immersed in becomes
acidic; but stir in some base and they swell to many times their former
size"...

The best designs still mimic their genetic counterparts though.  Bipeds for
freedom of movement, quadrapeds for speed and stability.  It is hard for a
biped to be statically stable without expending power, too.

Hybrid designs such as a four-legged two-tracked robot can be used to give
the best of two worlds (it pulls the legs out of the way to use the tracks
on flat ground, but uses the legs on rough ground), but in the end whoever
gets the four-legged thing to move fast will win since the component count
and maintenance equation will be lower.

As for redundancy, a wolf may be able to chew its own leg off to get out of
a bear trap, but it\'s not going to be a happy wolf afterwards.  I don\'t
think that is a good argument for a biological entity - even less so for a
robot designed to operate such.

Thats my rambling for the night...

Got that one wrong - it expands with heat, but some property causes it to
return to its original shape even although cooling under tension.

does it presume the possibility of time travel; what it DOES do is break the
presumed law identified in Einstein\'s General Theory which is that
INFORMATION cannot travel faster than the speed of light between the points
at which the information is generated or incorporated. There are now known
instances where that presumed law does appear to be broken, such as in some
quantuum tunnelling effects and in the general class of objects known as
tachyons (which theoreticaly cannot travel SLOWER than the speed of light).
However, neither of these cases has been shown to be able to transfer
information, due to the relative uncertainty in making measurements on the
basis of the elementary particles involved.

Light, in fact is not the limiting factor, nor the \'cone\' it describes in
any way related specifically to the process and flow of the \'arrow of time\'.
It is merely a simple descriptive term used to roughly outline the
relationship between two or more points in spacetime. Spacetime, regardles
of the \'cones\' within it is a single, consistent, medium with defined
properties, one of which presently appears to be that the flow of events it
describes proceeds in one direction. There are some possibilities that time
travel may be permitted in certain circumstances, but none of these have
been demonstrated, even theoretically, and none rely on FTL travel at all.
Instead, all rely on the use of negative energy.

I\'m sorry, but in this instance, the canon is - and IMHO is likely to
remain, except perhaps in very special conditions - quite correct. I can see
no case as yet discussed here that either implies or describes a time travel
situation.

        I agree whole-heartedly.  Otherwise, I have a problem justifing for
why Humanatii would not have been over-run or assimilated as a client state/
race to the other "super races".  As an aside, in AD&D, how many groups have
you seen that even have a *majority* of humans?  Too many benefits to taking
one of the demi-human races.
        As a result, I tend to work on a simple accounting system...  a
given race cannot be any more than "+2" greater than human...  Every point
af stat or skill better must be balanced back down with a dis-add of some kind.
        One of my favorite home-brew races from my first CT Traveller game
were the Zevarians.  Sentient Otter-folk, about four feet tall.  Phenomenal
engineers (automatic Eng +1 or Mech +1, player\'s choice) with good reflexes
(Dext +2).  Unfortunately, Zevaria is a size 6 waterworld.  This resulted in
poor strength and endurance in normal G  ranges (-1 Stren, -1 Endur).  The
other issue is that the average Zevarian has absolute nightmares trying to
even concieve the vector math required to work out interstellar jumps (Nav -1).
        The result in my game was that the ship\'s engineer was usually a
Zevarian.  Murder with a laser, handy with a hyperdrive, and a nightmare at
a Nav console.  A good balance.

        Hi!
        My first CT game had sixteen different races within an average
density three sector area...  My current CT game, the Terrans are sure they
aren\'t alone, but haven\'t actually encountered any other races.  One extreme

Well, the Moties were limited by their need to breed incessantly and by the
sole Alderson point in their system ending up inside a star.  Even with
their modified Langston Field, they were pretty effectively trapped in
their home system, doomed to the Cycles.

Oddly, most of the AD&D games I\'ve played have been mostly human, but that
might be an artifact of our DM, whose game world feature some strong racism
between the major races.  A group of elves, dwarves and humans were about
as popular most places as civil rights workers in 1963 Mississippi.

One thing I\'m doing for my upcoming GURPS:Traveller game is using so of the
templates from Biotech to design aliens and divergent human races. Works
pretty well.

I\'ve gotten several groups of mercenaries this way.. they piled on Combat
Rifleman and Tactics, but nobody took Forward Observer.  Then the are
outnumbered 5-1 by an enemy force that would be decimated by the fire
support, if only they knew how to call it in!

Note for the civilians: Calling in artillery support is not easy.  In fact
it\'s one of the hardest things to learn to do properly.  Do it wrong, and
you can easily kill dozens of your own troops.  Artillery units won\'t
answer incorrect fire requests, on the theory that a Bad Guy has gotten the
radio and COI and is trying to cause friendly fire.

Troops chosen for Special Operation Groups get special training.  Like most
recon types, this training is more about evading contact that stand up
fighting.

In a Battledress Diplomacy situation, the Marines will probably parade in
their gray and maroon dress uniforms, cutlasses held at present arms, then
suit up for a firepower demo.

In a situation like Somalia or the current one in Kosovo, the Imperial
marines would only be used until an Army unit, such as a Lift Infantry
Brigade, could be packed up and sent to the scene.  Army troops have the
training and equipment to support peacekeeping or humanitarian missions.

The Scout/Commando battledress in Star Mercs was pretty heavily stealthed.
Once again, Marines in SOGs get special training.  There is one SOG company
per Regiment, which is enough to handle most "soft" mission requirements.

Thanks.  I didn\'t mean to imply that your average Marine is utterly
helpless without BD, but that their operational mind set is tied up in
having all the advantages of Battledress.  A good example is that Marines
don\'t have the instinct to drop to cover when shot at, since they can\'t
really do that in their armor.  Infantry tactics are more a set of reflexes
that require endless repetition to learn.  A battlesuited Marine is going
to learn a whole different set of moves, since he\'s used to having that
armor, and all the sensors, and the integral weaponry.

One thing I\'ve had fun with is justifying the infamous Marine Cutlass.  At
BayCon, I had a chance to speak with Frank Lurz, a fairly well-known artist
and fencer, and learned from him that fencing is mostly about body
position.  The light went on in my head.  Marines are taught the basics of
fencing both as tradition and to make them "body aware", since they\'ll be
controlling their armor by subtle movements of the head and hands.  Many
Marines keep up the hobby, and become master fencers.

Would this also include Marines who are on shipboard duty?  Marines are
still used aboard ships as guards/ship\'s troops/etc.  Are they constantly
wearing bat dress in these situations?  Are they tromping up and down
starship halls in bat dress?

I could see them wearing bat dress in a boarding action or some such thing,
but do they put on bat dress when the rest of the Navy crew is putting on

I don\'t see what physical laws the Moties break, and the reason for keeping

Yes, but only great for reading. I will have to read the books again and put
my mind to a solution that is not a mere handwave. They are fantastic
aliens, and I would like to bring them "out" into the rest of the universe.
Except that they would make it a Motie Universe. Maybe they could be
contained in an isolated cluster?

No, they\'d wear shipsuits like everybody else.  At general Quarters, the
guards on the bridge would be suited up.

Marines would wear their battledress when the Navy got into, Vacc gear.
It\'s easier than having two sets of tanks, etc, for each man.

But once again, ship board duty is an exception to the Marine norm.  While
acting as ship;s security or doing patrols of Startown during liberty, they
aren\'t (normally) going to get into firefights.

I subscribe to this theory already, or at least a variation of it. The star
Sol is simply a reflection in the physical universe of the spiritual entity
known as Horaktay, or Hyperion. All other stars we see are "shadows of this
first of shadows", and are simply manifestations on the same entity in
different time-lines. But then again, I\'m a nutball! CHIRP!

Can\'t agree with your BD-only interpretation and the clear lines
between Army and Marine responsibilities.  One important factor
in my mind is that because of the distances and time lags involved,
you send in whoever is closest.  That means flexibility of response.

I tend to think of the Army as slower to mobilize.  They\'re on
one planet, you determine the destination, put \'em on ships,
several weeks later, you put \'em on another planet.  Whatever the
duty is on the destination world, it is known and the Army is
a tailored response.

IMO, Marines are the flexible, rapid-response guys.  To a large
degree, they\'re already aboard Navy ships.  So they can get
there first.  And since they often won\'t know what they\'re facing
with enough lead time to prepared an ideal response, they have
to be ready for anything.  Orbital drop, ground assualt, point defense,
extraction, search and destroy, recon, etc.  It might be easier to
describe what marines don\'t do:
 - they don\'t fly ships
 - they don\'t drive tanks
 - they don\'t do artillery
Sure, there are minor nits to that, but this is the general rule, IMTU.

I like the cheesy line that was in the Clint Eastwood marine movie
where he plays a Top Sergeant.  All through the film he says:
"Improvise.  Adapt.  Overcome."  Reminded me of some old
competitions I saw years ago on television that involved
some physical and mental test that was a training method
that the British marines used.  It involved using paint cans of
varying weights and using them to climb rope to the top of
a small tower, or something like that.  It was a mental puzzle,
but once you had a solution, it was still a serious physical
challenge.  I have these ideas in the back of my head when
I think about Traveller marines.  They should be ready for
everything from a knife-fight in the jungle, to an orbital
drop, to shipboard fight in zero-g.  And they can still do
that and not be subtle.  :-)

Umm.  I\'m wondering why with the Imperial Rules of War,
the Marine would even have access to a micronuke.  In GT:Star Mercs,
the discussion of the rules of war says the only place that small nukes
would ever be tolerated is in aerospace defense and space combat.

The Navy supply ship carrying the necessary parts to maintain and
repair damaged BD misjumps.  The marines still have a mission
that can\'t wait.  Are they going to say:  "But Colonel, we can\'t
use our BD.  And we can\'t carry our FGMPs without the BD."?
I hope not.  But even if they did, I would expect the reply to
be, "You\'re a marine.  Find a way.  You have 4 hours.  Get it done.
Use rocks and sticks if you have to."

Again, that might be the ideal, but things rarely go according to plan.
The Army guys might be more than a month away.

Hmm.  Can\'t say I like that much at all.  But I\'ve already blathered on about
my reasons for that above.

The biggest objection I have to this approach is Book 4, p. 6: Marines
receive the same unit assignments as Army units (with the addition of
Ship\'s Troops), just in different proportions. These include Counter
Insurgency, Internal Security, and Police Actions. The proportions
themselves may not be definitive -- this may represent PC backgrounds,
rather than Joe Jarhead -- but they are indicative.

In TNS entries, it is a retired Imperial Marine major who is "captain of
auxiliaries engaged in counter-insurgency actions" (004-1106). This seems
unlikely, if his prior experience was limited to high-intensity raids and
full-blown combat actions.

I suggest that Imperial Marines are the Quick Reaction Force for whatever
trouble is brewing, large or small. Then, if it looks like the mission is
going to drag on, you send in the Army and save the Marines for the next
crisis.

Most groups I\'ve ever played with. Then again, the people I play with tend
to be more serious, so campaigns tend to be longer. The distinct advantage
of being able to freely advance is a big one in such a campaign. You do see
a couple of half elves and elves from time to time though.

    'body' => 'Doug, how you envision the use of Imperial Marines is perfectly fine
for a TU, and it might agree with (or become) the standard for the
OTU, but it might not match up with how others *want* the Marines to
work in their TU.  Whew, did you follow that?  ;-> Anyway, I suggest
you consider some options to your "if it ain\'t battlesuited it\'s the
Army\'s job."

IMTU, for instance, Battlesuited troopers are elite units, the skill
is rare, and the suits are even rarer.  Only in very specialized
games that focused on combat by elite units would battlesuits
appear.  In almost all the games I run the battlesuit skill would be
wasted, because its use wouldn\'t come up in play.

Let me suggest, that you provide a broader model for the Marines.
In this model the Marines consist of *up to* four branches:  Fleet,
Drop, Line, and Garrison.  As a sidebar you could present the
*option* for GM\'s that Marines be limited to just Fleet and Drop
while the Army covers the Line and Garrison function.  In this way,
GM\'s could decide if they want TTU to have Marines be a small elite
force, or a larger more standard force with some elite units.

Here\'s my suggestion for functions of Marine Force Branches...

Fleet:  Elite, normally ship based, forces tasked with ship
        security, boarding, anti-boarding, and small unit actions in
        support of ship operations.  Special training in Battlesuit
        Ops, low-Z g combat, Marine Ax (or Force Sword), Energy
        Weapon, Boarding Tactics and Otillery support (Fwrd Obs).
        Regular training as per Line Troops.
        
Drop:   Elite forces tasked with insertion by Drop Capsule for
        assaults on hostile planets.  Special training in Drop
        Capsule use, Battlesuit Ops, Marine Ax (or Force Sword),
        Energy Weapon, Ground Tactics and Otillery support (Fwrd
        Obs).  Regular training as per Line Troops.
        
Line:   Regular forces tasked with independent combat actions at
        company and regimental levels.  Trained in Cbt Rifleman,
        (and Pistol for Officers), Cutlass, Ground Tactics, and Fwrd
        Obs. Armory, Support Wpns optional.  Regimental Support
        Units include...
        
        Artillery:  Light artillery/heavy weapons unit attached at
                    regimental level to Line Marines.  Special
                    Training in Hvy Wpns, Artillery, and Energy
                    Weapons. Regular training as per Line.
                    
        Armor:      Light Grav tank unit attached at the regimental
                    level to Line Marines.  Special Training in Grav
                    Vehicle, Hvy Wpns, Energy Wpns.  Regular
                    training as per Line.

Garrison:  A Line unit without Artillery and/or Armor support tasked
        with security, pacification, control and/or defense of
        planetary areas from insurgent forces.  Special security,
        intelligence and logistic units may be attached to a
        garrisoned unit.

The Army would be a much larger organization, but mostly just cadre
units during peacetime.  During mobilization reserve and planetary
conscript units would fill out the cadres.  The Infantry Branch of
the Army would be organized similarly to Marine Line and Garrison
units.  The Army would also have separate Armor, Artillery, and
Support Branches.

Just some things to think about,

Steve -- remember that version of the Golden Rule that runs, "He who has
the Gold, makes the Rules?" 

The Imperial Rules of War are for *other* people in the Imperium --
mercenaries and planetary governments, primarily -- who want to mess around
in the Imperium\'s demense: warfare. The Imperium can do whatever it
pleases. The Vilani Imperium was fond of the "nuke them from orbit; it\'s
the only way to be sure" school of counter-insurgency. I can imagine that
the Third Imperium is somewhat kinder and gentler, but only as long as it
suits their purpose. 

Besides, nuclear dampers make clean-up a snap.

I beg to differ here.  We have no info on sentient life, the galaxy may be
teeming with it, or we may be the only one.  However, life seems to have
evolved on Earth shortly after it cooled. The chemicals of life (amino
acids...) are found in interstellar gas clouds throughout the universe,
and Mars may well have once had life.  All that adds up to a strong
likelihood that life is found everywhere it can possibly evolve. 

Currently we have no idea whether that means most habitable planets in the
galaxy have oceans filled with blue green algae and other single celled
critters, or whether complex multicellular life is more common. The earth
has had life for most the its 4.5 billion years, but for all but the last
800 million years it was merely single-celled. 

Assuming we won\'t find at least single celled life nearly everywhere it
could possibly exist seems unlikely.  However, further speculation beyond
that point is most definitely guesswork.  In a decade or so we\'ll
hopefully have more data on the Europan oceans.  If we find life there
then current theories looks to be correct, and if we find multicellular
life there then all bet are off.

SPR *didn\'t* win Best Picture -- Shakespeare In Love did. SPR was very
well filmed, but I don\'t think it deserved Best Picture either. I\'m 
still not sure Tom Hanks was awake during his scenes... :)

But you\'re right, a movie like SW with the realism of SPR would be
different... and probably not go over too well with a lot of people.

ObTrav: how realistic is the violence in multimedia entertainment in 
the 3I? How *violent* is it? Or does it vary from place to place?

The problem is to prevent a long-term problem developing.

I like the idea of Imperial Marines feeling \'undressed\' without their suits.

I also think that actual armed revolts against the Imperium are rare enough
that Imperial doctrine would have adapted it\'s tools to lower-intensity

The other issue to remember is that most Imperial wars have been fought

Trust me, as I write this I\'m trying my damndest to stay true to Book 4,
and everything that has been written since.

Counter-insurgency is what we were doing in Vietnam, which as any one who
was there (or studied it at all), was a full blown war vs. a wily foe.
Perhaps the Major was involved with a Mike Force operation, or since it was
specified as auxiliaries, perhaps he was working with a group of locally
raised troops as a cadre.  marine leadership training is very good.

Exactly!  The Marines carry a very small transportation cost.. they are
very light, and can be shipped to a trouble spot far more quickly than the
Army.  If it looks like a long haul, you start bring in the Army who are
optimized for long, drawn out campaigns.

It\'s a tortoise/hare situation.  The Marines are great in the short dash of
rapid, intense combat, while the Army has the ponderous weight to grind
opponents down over the long run.

I\'ve had some interesting discussions on whether the Vilani would even have
had much of an Army.  Much more cost efficient to go into orbit with a
battlewagon, issue the ultimatum, then stat razing cities until either they
surrender or you\'ve destroyed the population, and can resettle the world.

In playing with GURPS:Vehicles, I\'ve designed a six shot box launcher for
30mm grenades that include micro nuke rounds.  This wouldn\'t be the
standard load of course, but mighty handy when you are doing something like
trying to silence a planetary defense station.

The Imperium rules the space between the worlds, but the vast majority of
Imperial citizens live on the 11,000 planets inside the borders.  To defend
these worlds, the Emperor depends on the three prongs of the ground forces
trident.  These are the Imperial Army, the Imperial Marine Force and each
world\'s Planetary Defense Force.

THE IMPERIAL ARMY

The Imperial Army (IA), also known as the standing, or regular army, is the
largest single body of troops in the Imperium.  The Army is designed to be
the heavy defense force on the surface of planets.  

Because the Imperium is so vast, and faces different threats on every
border, day-to-day control of the Army is vested in the local subsectors.
Each subsector has its own Army command, able to organize and plan for its
own particular needs.  From the top down, the IA command structure for the
Spinward Marches is as follows:

ARMY SUPREME COMMAND (Capital/Core)

This is the highest command authority for the Imperial Army.  This command
is concerned with the long range planning and defense of the entire
Imperium.  This council of senior officers organizes all R&D, mass
equipment upgrades, and changes in Army-wide doctrine and regulations.  The
Supreme Command has almost no influence of line units, directly controlling
only the Imperial Guard regiments stationed on Capital..

DOMAIN COMMAND: DENEB (Depot/Deneb)

At the Domain level, the Army maintains a level of command for the purpose
of strategic planning "behind the claw."  Officers assigned here have a
better focus on the problems and threats facing their area of operations.

Deneb Command also oversees the allocation of Imperial funds to the Sector
forces.  Many worlds in the Imperial Core do not bother with extensive
military development, and pay into a general fund rather than raising units
that are three years from the border in the first place.  The Supreme
Command allocates this money as block grants to the domains, who use it to
fund projects of local need.  Many times, this money is passed down the
line with no strings attached.  This is generally the case in Deneb, due to
the wildly varying threats the region faces.

Domain level commands control a small group of elite troops, rarely more
than a Corps, who act as a "fire brigade" for the command.  Since this is
traditionally the Marine mission, there is a great deal of friction over
these unit\'s existence.

SPINWARD MARCHES HIGH COMMAND (Rhylanor/Rhylanor)

The sector high command is the highest level of command that directly
commands regular Army units.  In a wartime situation, units leaving their
home Subsector come under the control of the sector command for the
duration of their transit.  Leaving this control only when the unit either
returns home or is handed off to a local command for combat.  The sector
command controls the reserves and logistics for the Army when it mobilizes.

The sector command also distributes funding to the Subsector Armies.  Since
planning is done decades in advance, each Subsector force submits an annual
update on its projected needs over the next ten years.  Budget allocations
are made based on both these figures, and on the needs of the sector as a
whole.

The sector command controls the strategic reserve for the sector.  This
consists of all Army units out of their home Subsector and in transit, as
well as all colonial forces (see below) committed to action.

SUBSECTOR ARMY HEADQUARTERS (subsector capitals)

The Subsector Army is the heart of the Imperial defense.  Each Subsector
crafts its force to meet its unique needs and threats.  Subsector
Headquarters is where the actual purchasing of equipment takes place.
Within guidelines from higher headquarters, each Subsector is pretty free
to equip its forces as it wishes.  All of the forces in the Spinward
Marches equip their forces with psionic shields due to the threat of
Zhodani commandos.

Operationally, the Army HQ coordinates the actions of its forces, in
addition to those assigned to it by higher command, in the defense of the
Subsector.  If offensive operations are called for, Subsector forces may be
seconded to the assault force at the Sector Command\'s discretion.

COMBAT ORGANIZATION

The basic combat organization of the Army is the Brigade.  Designed to be
an independent fighting force, brigades can fight without much support for
several weeks, assuming regular supply.

The basic maneuver element of the IA is the brigade.  Designed to be a
self-contained, independent fighting force, combat brigades come in three
basic types:

(note: TO&E illustrations would be added before descriptions.)

The Lift-Infantry Brigade has a headquarters (30 men, 3 Astrin APCs), three
lift-infantry battalions (420 men, 44 Astrin APCs), a tank battalion (200
men, 40 Intrepid Tanks, 2 Astrin APCs), an artillery battalion (220 men, 18
Multiple Rocket/Drone Launchers), air defense battery (60 men, 8 air/space
defense vehicles), reconnaissance company (57 men, 12 air/rafts), engineer
company (70 men, 4 Astrin APCs), medical company (25 men, 2 G-carrier
ambulances), maintenance company (65 men) and a transportation company (70
men, 40 G-carriers).

The Grav-Tank Brigade has a headquarters (30 men, 2 Intrepid tanks, 2
Astrin APCs), three tank battalions (200 men, 40 Intrepid tanks, 2 Astrin
APCs), a lift-infantry battalion (420 men 44 Astrin APCs), an artillery
battalion (220 men, 18 Multiple Rocket/Drone Launchers), air defense
battery (60 men, 8 air/space defense vehicles), reconnaissance company (57
men, 12 air/rafts), engineer company (70 men, 4 Astrin APCs), medical
company (25 men, 2 G-carrier ambulances), maintenance company (65 men) and
a transportation company (70 men, 40 G-carriers).

The Rapid Interface Brigade (also known as jump troops) has a headquarters
company (30 men) three jump battalions (400 men), and a support company (60
men).  RIBs have no organic vehicles, and need to be supported by their
heavier counterparts.  They are trained as raiding or light infantry.

Lift-infantry Brigades make up 67% of the available forces in the Spinward
Marches, with Grav-tank units contributing 29% and RIBs at 4%.

Brigades are combined into divisions; a lift-infantry division would have
two lift-infantry brigades and a single grav tank brigade.  Tank divisions
would switch this ratio around.  Divisions also have extensive artillery
and combat support units.  A typical lift-infantry division would be
equipped with:

Division headquarters (320 men), two lift-infantry brigades, one tank
brigade, an artillery group (1,800 men, meson weapons, MRLs, Drone
launchers, tube artillery), and air/space defense battalion (250 men), an
independent tank battalion (220 men, 45 Intrepid tanks), reconnaissance
battalion (300 men), engineering battalion (340 men), support battalion
(560 men).

Grav tank divisions use two tank brigades in place of the two infantry
units, and dispense with the independent tank battalion, otherwise they are
much the same.

Above the Division level, come the Corps.  Corps are composed of three to
five divisions, with additional support units.  Corps rarely standing
formations, being formed on an as needed basis.  Corps Headquarters exists
in peacetime, but have no real duties beyond readiness exercises.

The highest operational level of the Army is the Field Army.  This massive
grouping is made up of several corps, and can easily field over 100,000
troops and all their equipment.  

THE ARMY MISSION

The Imperial Army exists to defend the member worlds of the Imperium.  It
accomplishes this using the best equipment available and training in all
the skills the soldiers need.

In peacetime, soldiers in the IA can find themselves on any of a number of
assignments.  Many planetary governments use the IA for peacekeeping
duties, or as disaster relief when the local forces are unable to cope.
The IA is never committed without a great deal of thought and planning,
since moving even a single brigade can tie up many thousand tons of
shipping and require the service of several Navy escorts.

The most common role for the IA is that of peace-keeper.  On many worlds,
the IA sits on disputed borders or between feuding ethnic populations.
These missions can be quite stressful, but the presence of a massive
over-whelming force is usually enough to calm even the hottest tempers.
These missions also give much-needed combat experience to junior officers
and NCOs.

The Army also trains against local forces, providing an opposing force in
invasion scenarios.  Many planetary governments find that having the
Regulars "invade" their world is a good way to shake up a military that
might have become complacent about their skills.

REGIMENTS AND LINEAGE

While the combat commands are organized around brigades, the Army\'s history
and honors are handed down to Regiments.  Each Battalion is part of a
Regiment.  These Regiments are not actual organizations, but exist only as
a source of esprit de corps and pride for the members of that Regiment.

When the Sylean Army began the change into the Imperium Army, many units
resisted giving up their old unit ties for the new system, also, as the
Army grew, it became clear that without some new type of organization, the
army would soon be dealing with extremely large and unwieldy unit numbers.

In the year 123, the Army High Command instituted the Regimental system.
Under this plan, each world of the Imperium raises specific Regiments for
the IA.  These regiments are named for the world, or can be named for a
specific region on that world where the bulk of the troops lived.  Some
units carry more colorful names, referring to a particular habit or notable
trait of the troops.  One hard rule is that the name has to identify the
type of troops in the regiment, although even here some leeway is given.
There exists a list of acceptable terms for infantry, cavalry, and other
types of units (see _Star Mercs_ for details).

For example, an infantry regiment from Mora could be called the 102nd Moran
Rifles, or be named the Culhoon Heights Regiment of Foot, or even the 4th
Matriarch\'s Guards Regiment.

Regiments tend to be composed of three battalions.  It is very rare to see
all three battalions serving together in a brigade, since the presence of
several different regiments encourages competition between the units to be
the best soldiers.


THE IMPERIAL MARINE FORCE

When the average citizen thinks of Imperial power, the image that comes
first is usually the battledress clad Imperial Marine.  The Emperor\'s
striking force, the Marines have a long history of taking the dirtiest jobs
and succeeding against heavy odds.

The Marines are tied to the Imperial Navy.  The Navy provides the Marine
force with all the various support activities it needs, from supply to
orbital fire on hostile targets.  The Marines also act as ship\'s troops,
along with guarding Imperial installations such as consulates.

The highest level of Marine organization is the Regiment.  Regiments  are
made up of three force commands (see _Star Mercs_) plus a Regimental
command company.

Marine Regiments are distributed throughout the Imperium on the basis of
two Regiments for each numbered fleet.  At any given time, one Regiment
will be dispersed in company and platoon sized assault ships, carrying out
patrols and missions within their assigned subsector, while the other
Regiment will be at a base, exercising as a whole.  The Fleet\'s Marines are
commanded by the Fleet Colonel (O-7).  The highest rank in the Marine Force
is Sector Marshal (O-9), the commander of an entire sector\'s Marines, both
fleet and regimental.

MARINE RANK STRUCTURE

O-5  Force Commander (FCDR)
O-6  Colonel  (COL)
O-7  Fleet Colonel (FCOL) 
O-8  Marshal (MSL)
O-9  Sector Marshal (SMSL)


The high end NCO ranks require some explanation.. A Ship\'s Sergeant is the
senior NCO of either a Marine Company or any detachment smaller than a
Battalion.  A Master Gunner is a Marine serving in a 
technical position without command authority.

Fleet Sergeants are different from Command Fleet Sergeants in that the
CF/SGT is the senior NCO of a Battalion or larger unit.. There is an
unofficial rank of Regimental Fleet Sergeant for the CF/SGT of a Regiment.
Master Fleet Sergeant is the rank given to senior NCOs of entire fleets or
subsectors.  There is one Sector Command Master Fleet Sergeant per sector,
and the Force Master Fleet Sergeant has his office on Capital. 

Enlisted Marines who make Corporal may apply to OCS.  This is the only path
to commission.  There are no Academy Marine officers.  A new officer can
expect his year as Force Ensign to be spent as a gopher for senior officers
as he learns the ropes of his new position.

An Enlisted Marine E-5 or above may request a bust of one rank and "Career"
status.  That marine has acknowledged he has been promoted beyond his
means, and wishes to freeze his rank at the one he just left.  Such a NCO
uses the word "Career" before his rank in most situations.  {example: "I am
Career Gunnery Sergeant Redding, and you now belong to me and the Emperor.
You had better pray he comes for you, because I will show you no mercy.")
If the Marine Force determines that the request is being made for any
reason other than a true devotion to duty, the petition will be denied and
the NCO will usually be separated.

Career NCO\'s are accorded extra respect for giving up advancement in order
to stay in the position where they can serve best.  In game terms, Career
NCOs should have a +1 Reputation (large group).

MARINE OPERATIONS

More than any other service, the Marines are dedicated to the raw
application of force.  Marines are not trained in the peacekeeping or
limited operations that the Army excels at.  When the Marines engage in
combat, their creed is to use the maximum amount force possible to
overwhelm and destroy the enemy in the minimal amount of time.  Marines are
infamous for using fusion weapons to destroy an entire building to root out
a single sniper.

The Marine Force\'s main job is to secure a foothold on hostile worlds.  To
this end, all Marines are trained in rapid interface techniques and
equipped with the absolute best the Imperium can give them.  The usual
target for the Marines is the world\'s starport, which coincidentally is
usually heavily equipped with ground to space defenses. 

Marines are also tasked to board vessels in deep space whenever called
upon.  This can be as simple as assisting in a deep space rescue or customs
inspection, or as difficult as boarding a crippled enemy warship against
armed opposition.  If there is any one mission the Marines dread, it is
fighting their way through the killing zones of an unfamiliar starship.

Outside of open warfare, the Marines still serve an important duty.  One of
the most visible Marine roles is their part in piracy suppression.  When a
pirate base or haven is located, the Marines will raid it to both insure
its destruction and to secure whatever intelligence might be found.
Imperial Intelligence has found that the personal nature of these actions
shocks the backers of the pirates, and can effectively scare the backers
into moving operations elsewhere.

Non-Fleet Marines play a variety of roles in the Imperial defense
establishment.  Marines are the Emperor\'s troops, and guard all Imperial
facilities.  The most visible of these guards are the  sophonts assigned to
guard Imperial consulates on member worlds.  These Marines are selected for
their appearance and poise, and serve as a daily reminder of the implied
force that the Imperium controls.

MARINE ARMORED CAVALRY REGIMENTS

The only truly heavy force in the Marine arsenal, Armored Cav regiments are
fairly rare.  The regulations call for one MarArmCav regiment for every
eight line regiments.  In effect there is one MarArmCav regiment for every
four subsectors.  These units are capable of devastating entire worlds, and
sit only one step below unrestricted orbital bombardment in the list of
options the Imperium has to a crisis.  

MarArmCavs are never committed without a clear, immediate threat that
warrants the Imperium releasing it\'s full power.  A MarArmCav requires
heavy support from the navy for transport and supply, and given the
Marines\' "no holds barred" approach means whatever force is on the
receiving end of this force had better be prepared for a desperate fight.

A MarArmCav Regiment consists of a Headquarters company (70 men, 2 Intrepid
tanks, 4 Astrin APCs), three Armored Cavalry Battalions (165 men, 40
Intrepid tanks, 2 Astrin APCs), a Meson Artillery Section (70 men, 8 meson
sleds, 4 G-carriers)

MARINE TRADITIONS

The Imperial Marine Force traces it\'s roots to a detachment of Rule of Man
Marines stranded on Sylea at the beginning of the Long Night.  The RoM
Marines were in turn based on the assault troops of the Terran
Confederation.  These troops were drawn from several sources on Earth, most
notably organizations such as the United States Marine Corps, the Royal
Marines, and various airborne and special operations groups.  With such a
long history, the Marines have developed some unique and fiercely guarded
traditions.

Marines were a maroon beret.  This beret is only granted to a recruit after
he successfully completes rapid interface training, and is awarded in a
very solemn ceremony.  It is a point of pride for the Marines that incoming
Army troops should be greeted by Marines who have taken off their helmets
and donned the berets.  This is a subtle hint that the hard work has been
done, and that the Army is just coming in to "mop up."

Another tradition that the Marines have fought long and hard to retain is
the bagpipe.  Marine pipers have been around since the Sylean Marines were
founded, and it doesn\'t appear that the armor-rending wails will ever fade
from Marine lore.  One of the most coveted skill badges is Master Piper,
and a Marine lives his tour of duty hearing the pipes daily.

Some have theorized that the only reason the Marines cling to the pipes so
intensely is that the sound of bagpipes in a confined area like a starship
drives the Navy insane.  Whether or not this true, a Regimental band of
pipes and drums remains one of the Marines\' best recruiting tools.

Strangely, the Marines have turned the pipes to their combat advantage.
While it is a myth that Marines land with a piper equipped with a
battle-dress mounted set of pipes, they have adapted the sound to an
effective psychological warfare tool.  Marine drop ships are equipped with
powerful radio jammers, and also drop electronic warfare pods that are
likewise intended to interfere with enemy communications and sensors.  The
Marines play prerecorded bagpipes with enough strength to drown out the
enemy\'s own transmissions.  The demoralizing effect of having your radio
channels suddenly flooded by "Sylea the Brave", along with the knowledge
that the music indicates that you will soon be dealing with the
overwhelming, merciless fire of a Marine unit, has caused more than one
defender to immediately surrender.

In defiance of their "spit and polish" image while drilling, the Marines
are notorious for covering their personal armor, equipment, and vehicles
with all sorts of graffiti.  Marines may scrawl commentary about the enemy,
outsized Imperial Sunbursts or regimental crests, or cartoons based on
perceived characteristics of vehicle commanders.  While officially frowned
on, this activity is tolerated due to the Marines\' battlefield abilities.

One Marine tradition with roots strongly grounded in sound tactical
thinking is the cutlass.  Originally, the Marines retained the ancient
weapon merely as a symbol.  During the Chaestin War immediate preceeding
the founding of the Imperium, the Sylean Marines found themselves called on
to board and capture disabled enemy vessels.  The powerful fusion weapons
used by the Marines tended to cause more damage than necessary, prompting
Star Sergeant J. Redding to begin carrying his dress cutlass ointo battle.  

The cutlass proved quite useful in breaching enemy vacc suits. Also, the
sight of a squad of Marines in battledress waving swords often proved to be
too much for the ship\'s crews, who would often surrender without a fight.

In honor opf Star Sergeant Redding, all Marines learn basic swordplay as
part of their intial training.  Many Marines have gone on to win great
acclaim as fencers or duellists.

PLANETARY DEFENSE TROOPS

The largest arm of the Imperial ground forces triad is made up of the
individual armies of the member worlds.  Almost infinite in variety, these
forces provide the depth of defense that keeps the Imperium safe.

Each world of the Imperium is responsible for its own defense.  While the
Imperium will assist the member worlds, the final responsibility for a
government\'s survival rests with that government.  To that end, most worlds
raise at least a token force of armed troops.

On many worlds of the Core, these armies are little more than glorified
police forces.  With no strife since the Civil War, and the borders over a
year\'s travel away, these worlds have decided that there is little cause to
spend billions of Credits maintaining a force that will have few
responsibilities beyond keeping their weapons clean.  The closer you get to
the frontiers, the more interested planetary governments get in maintaining
an effective protection against outside aggressors.

On other planets with more repressive governments, there may exist large
forces mostly gear towards the suppression of internal dissent.  At the
most extreme, these forces can act as an occupying force in their own
homeland.

It should be stressed that local forces are completely independent of the
Imperial chain of command.  They answer only to their governments.  This
freedom also means that these armies are able to procure equipment to their
own standards, rather than using the Imperial standard.

Local defense forces, also called PDF (Planetary Defense Forces), are
divided in three broad categories.

GROUND FORCES

PDF Ground Forces are similar in concept to the Imperial Army, but
specialized for local conditions and technology.  Freed of the need to
travel far from their home world, these forces can use levels of
mechanization that most Imperial planners can only dream of.

Since the implied mission of a PDF unit is defensive in nature, planners
tend to stock up on the items that will help them hold off a besieging
force.  Vast stocks of artillery ammo, along with extensive spare part and
fuel depots are usually foremost in priority.  

An exception to this rule is balkanized worlds, where the various
nation-states will be arming not just for defense, but possible against
each other.  These worlds have a history of engaging in conventional arms
races of almost suicidal proportions, since they know that the Imperium
stands ready to intervene if things get out of hand.

PDF ground forces are the last place a traveller is likely to see tracked
vehicles used in any front-line role.  Jewell (Spinward Marches/Jewell) is
notable for equipping it\'s PDF with tracked and wheeled vehicles.  A desire
to keep cost low, along with the cluttered nature of Jewell\'s cities, make
these vehicles effective even against modern grav tanks.

Local forces in the Imperium use a bewildering number of organizational
plans and formats.  Almost any imaginable plan, no matter how crazy, has
been tried on at least one world.  It\'s not uncommon to encounter units
with titles like Legion, Cohort, Band, or anything else from human history.

NAUTICAL FORCE COMMAND

Also known as the "wet navy," the NFC is found on worlds with significant
oceans.  Often an addition to the ground forces, the NFC is strongest on
balkanized worlds of moderate technology (tech 6-9) with more than fifty
percent hydrosphere.  In these situations, the wet navy can become the
dominant military force on a world or in a nation.

Wet Navies are rarely much more than glorified search and rescue
operations. Once grav vehicles become common, the need for massive warships
fades.  The height of naval technology is seen at TL 8.

Since water interferes with most sensors, the Nautical Force Command
becomes a convenient hiding place for planetary defense weapons such as
meson-equipped submarines or secret supply depots for system defense boats
on the ocean floor.  An Earthlike world with large oceans can hide any
number of surprises for an invader.

Of all the PDF forces, the Wet Navy tends to be the most tradition bound.
For many races, the first truly organized military effort was the navy, so
the sense of history is strong for these sailors.

CLOSE ORBIT AND AEROSPACE CONTROL COMMAND

The third leg of the PDF triad is COACC.  This branch is responsible for
the defense of the world\'s airspace, from ground level to geosynchronous
orbit.  They also have responsibility for defense of any in-system assets
such as gas giants or secondary settlements on other worlds.  In many
systems, COACC is responsible for carrying out custom inspections and also
serves as a rescue service.  

There is considerable debate in the Imperium over the viability of
atmospheric fighters.  Many feel them to be anachronisms, without purpose
against fighter craft designed for the rigors of space combat.  The other
school holds that vehicles built explicitly for air to air combat hold a
great advantage over more general purpose interface vehicles.  Both sides
in the debate can point to various battles that seem to give support to
their views.

Many worlds without real navies of their own give COACC operation of the
system defense boats.  This allows a planet to have a consistent defense
structure from deep space to the planet\'s surface.  The majority of worlds
that can afford SDB\'s prefer to organize them as a separate service.

On balkanized worlds, the various national COACCs (more often called "Air
Forces") can field a wide variety of different purpose built bombers, recon
craft, and fighters.  On single government worlds, where the mission is
defense, the most common vehicle seen is the hypersonic interceptor.

COLONIAL FORCES

In times of great peril, such as a major war, planetary forces may be
volunteered for Imperial service.  Such forces are referred to as "Colonial
Units," and are generally considered to be of a lesser quality than
front-line troops.  Regardless, these troops can take a great deal of
pressure of harried commanders by assuming garrison and security roles,
freeing up units for the front lines.  Since these are not Imperial units,
their equipment and training can vary wildly, making it hazardous to mix
them with Imperial units.  During the 5th Frontier War, there was one
recorded case of an Imperial Marine point-defense system firing on
approaching colonials because their non-standard G-carriers were not in the
fire control computer\'s memory.

http://www.hooked.net/~dberry/imfrank.html


The Imperium rules the space between the worlds, but the vast majority of
Imperial citizens live on the 11,000 planets inside the borders.  To defend
these worlds, the Emperor depends on the three prongs of the ground forces
trident.  These are the Imperial Army, the Imperial Marine Force and each
world\'s Planetary Defense Force.

THE IMPERIAL ARMY

The Imperial Army (IA), also known as the standing, or regular army, is the
largest single body of troops in the Imperium.  The Army is designed to be
the heavy defense force on the surface of planets.  

Because the Imperium is so vast, and faces different threats on every
border, day-to-day control of the Army is vested in the local subsectors.
Each subsector has its own Army command, able to organize and plan for its
own particular needs.  From the top down, the IA command structure for the
Spinward Marches is as follows:

ARMY SUPREME COMMAND (Capital/Core)

This is the highest command authority for the Imperial Army.  This command
is concerned with the long range planning and defense of the entire
Imperium.  This council of senior officers organizes all R&D, mass
equipment upgrades, and changes in Army-wide doctrine and regulations.  The
Supreme Command has almost no influence of line units, directly controlling
only the Imperial Guard regiments stationed on Capital..

DOMAIN COMMAND: DENEB (Depot/Deneb)

At the Domain level, the Army maintains a level of command for the purpose
of strategic planning "behind the claw."  Officers assigned here have a
better focus on the problems and threats facing their area of operations.

Deneb Command also oversees the allocation of Imperial funds to the Sector
forces.  Many worlds in the Imperial Core do not bother with extensive
military development, and pay into a general fund rather than raising units
that are three years from the border in the first place.  The Supreme
Command allocates this money as block grants to the domains, who use it to
fund projects of local need.  Many times, this money is passed down the
line with no strings attached.  This is generally the case in Deneb, due to
the wildly varying threats the region faces.

Domain level commands control a small group of elite troops, rarely more
than a Corps, who act as a "fire brigade" for the command.  Since this is
traditionally the Marine mission, there is a great deal of friction over
these unit\'s existence.

SPINWARD MARCHES HIGH COMMAND (Rhylanor/Rhylanor)

The sector high command is the highest level of command that directly
commands regular Army units.  In a wartime situation, units leaving their
home Subsector come under the control of the sector command for the
duration of their transit.  Leaving this control only when the unit either
returns home or is handed off to a local command for combat.  The sector
command controls the reserves and logistics for the Army when it mobilizes.

The sector command also distributes funding to the Subsector Armies.  Since
planning is done decades in advance, each Subsector force submits an annual
update on its projected needs over the next ten years.  Budget allocations
are made based on both these figures, and on the needs of the sector as a
whole.

The sector command controls the strategic reserve for the sector.  This
consists of all Army units out of their home Subsector and in transit, as
well as all colonial forces (see below) committed to action.

SUBSECTOR ARMY HEADQUARTERS (subsector capitals)

The Subsector Army is the heart of the Imperial defense.  Each Subsector
crafts its force to meet its unique needs and threats.  Subsector
Headquarters is where the actual purchasing of equipment takes place.
Within guidelines from higher headquarters, each Subsector is pretty free
to equip its forces as it wishes.  All of the forces in the Spinward
Marches equip their forces with psionic shields due to the threat of
Zhodani commandos.

Operationally, the Army HQ coordinates the actions of its forces, in
addition to those assigned to it by higher command, in the defense of the
Subsector.  If offensive operations are called for, Subsector forces may be
seconded to the assault force at the Sector Command\'s discretion.

COMBAT ORGANIZATION

The basic combat organization of the Army is the Brigade.  Designed to be
an independent fighting force, brigades can fight without much support for
several weeks, assuming regular supply.

The basic maneuver element of the IA is the brigade.  Designed to be a
self-contained, independent fighting force, combat brigades come in three
basic types:

(note: TO&E illustrations would be added before descriptions.)

The Lift-Infantry Brigade has a headquarters (30 men, 3 Astrin APCs), three
lift-infantry battalions (420 men, 44 Astrin APCs), a tank battalion (200
men, 40 Intrepid Tanks, 2 Astrin APCs), an artillery battalion (220 men, 18
Multiple Rocket/Drone Launchers), air defense battery (60 men, 8 air/space
defense vehicles), reconnaissance company (57 men, 12 air/rafts), engineer
company (70 men, 4 Astrin APCs), medical company (25 men, 2 G-carrier
ambulances), maintenance company (65 men) and a transportation company (70
men, 40 G-carriers).

The Grav-Tank Brigade has a headquarters (30 men, 2 Intrepid tanks, 2
Astrin APCs), three tank battalions (200 men, 40 Intrepid tanks, 2 Astrin
APCs), a lift-infantry battalion (420 men 44 Astrin APCs), an artillery
battalion (220 men, 18 Multiple Rocket/Drone Launchers), air defense
battery (60 men, 8 air/space defense vehicles), reconnaissance company (57
men, 12 air/rafts), engineer company (70 men, 4 Astrin APCs), medical
company (25 men, 2 G-carrier ambulances), maintenance company (65 men) and
a transportation company (70 men, 40 G-carriers).

The Rapid Interface Brigade (also known as jump troops) has a headquarters
company (30 men) three jump battalions (400 men), and a support company (60
men).  RIBs have no organic vehicles, and need to be supported by their
heavier counterparts.  They are trained as raiding or light infantry.

Lift-infantry Brigades make up 67% of the available forces in the Spinward
Marches, with Grav-tank units contributing 29% and RIBs at 4%.

Brigades are combined into divisions; a lift-infantry division would have
two lift-infantry brigades and a single grav tank brigade.  Tank divisions
would switch this ratio around.  Divisions also have extensive artillery
and combat support units.  A typical lift-infantry division would be
equipped with:

Division headquarters (320 men), two lift-infantry brigades, one tank
brigade, an artillery group (1,800 men, meson weapons, MRLs, Drone
launchers, tube artillery), and air/space defense battalion (250 men), an
independent tank battalion (220 men, 45 Intrepid tanks), reconnaissance
battalion (300 men), engineering battalion (340 men), support battalion
(560 men).

Grav tank divisions use two tank brigades in place of the two infantry
units, and dispense with the independent tank battalion, otherwise they are
much the same.

Above the Division level, come the Corps.  Corps are composed of three to
five divisions, with additional support units.  Corps rarely standing
formations, being formed on an as needed basis.  Corps Headquarters exists
in peacetime, but have no real duties beyond readiness exercises.

The highest operational level of the Army is the Field Army.  This massive
grouping is made up of several corps, and can easily field over 100,000
troops and all their equipment.  

THE ARMY MISSION

The Imperial Army exists to defend the member worlds of the Imperium.  It
accomplishes this using the best equipment available and training in all
the skills the soldiers need.

In peacetime, soldiers in the IA can find themselves on any of a number of
assignments.  Many planetary governments use the IA for peacekeeping
duties, or as disaster relief when the local forces are unable to cope.
The IA is never committed without a great deal of thought and planning,
since moving even a single brigade can tie up many thousand tons of
shipping and require the service of several Navy escorts.

The most common role for the IA is that of peace-keeper.  On many worlds,
the IA sits on disputed borders or between feuding ethnic populations.
These missions can be quite stressful, but the presence of a massive
over-whelming force is usually enough to calm even the hottest tempers.
These missions also give much-needed combat experience to junior officers
and NCOs.

The Army also trains against local forces, providing an opposing force in
invasion scenarios.  Many planetary governments find that having the
Regulars "invade" their world is a good way to shake up a military that
might have become complacent about their skills.

REGIMENTS AND LINEAGE

While the combat commands are organized around brigades, the Army\'s history
and honors are handed down to Regiments.  Each Battalion is part of a
Regiment.  These Regiments are not actual organizations, but exist only as
a source of esprit de corps and pride for the members of that Regiment.

When the Sylean Army began the change into the Imperium Army, many units
resisted giving up their old unit ties for the new system, also, as the
Army grew, it became clear that without some new type of organization, the
army would soon be dealing with extremely large and unwieldy unit numbers.

In the year 123, the Army High Command instituted the Regimental system.
Under this plan, each world of the Imperium raises specific Regiments for
the IA.  These regiments are named for the world, or can be named for a
specific region on that world where the bulk of the troops lived.  Some
units carry more colorful names, referring to a particular habit or notable
trait of the troops.  One hard rule is that the name has to identify the
type of troops in the regiment, although even here some leeway is given.
There exists a list of acceptable terms for infantry, cavalry, and other
types of units (see _Star Mercs_ for details).

For example, an infantry regiment from Mora could be called the 102nd Moran
Rifles, or be named the Culhoon Heights Regiment of Foot, or even the 4th
Matriarch\'s Guards Regiment.

Regiments tend to be composed of three battalions.  It is very rare to see
all three battalions serving together in a brigade, since the presence of
several different regiments encourages competition between the units to be
the best soldiers.


THE IMPERIAL MARINE FORCE

When the average citizen thinks of Imperial power, the image that comes
first is usually the battledress clad Imperial Marine.  The Emperor\'s
striking force, the Marines have a long history of taking the dirtiest jobs
and succeeding against heavy odds.

The Marines are tied to the Imperial Navy.  The Navy provides the Marine
force with all the various support activities it needs, from supply to
orbital fire on hostile targets.  The Marines also act as ship\'s troops,
along with guarding Imperial installations such as consulates.

The highest level of Marine organization is the Regiment.  Regiments  are
made up of three force commands (see _Star Mercs_) plus a Regimental
command company.

Marine Regiments are distributed throughout the Imperium on the basis of
two Regiments for each numbered fleet.  At any given time, one Regiment
will be dispersed in company and platoon sized assault ships, carrying out
patrols and missions within their assigned subsector, while the other
Regiment will be at a base, exercising as a whole.  The Fleet\'s Marines are
commanded by the Fleet Colonel (O-7).  The highest rank in the Marine Force
is Sector Marshal (O-10), the commander of an entire sector\'s Marines, both
fleet and regimental.

MARINE RANK STRUCTURE

E-0  Recruit (RCT) (only used during initial training)
E-1  Armsman 3rd Class (AM/3)
E-2  Armsman 2nd Class (AM/2)
E-3  Armsman 1st Class (AM/1)
E-4  Corporal (CPL)
E-5  Sergeant (SGT)
E-6  Gunnery Sergeant (G/SGT)
E-7  Master Sergeant  (M/SGT)
E-8  Ship\'s Sergeant  (S/SGT)
     Master Gunner   (M/G)
E-9  Fleet Sergeant  (F/SGT)
     Command Fleet Sergeant (CF/SGT)
     Master Fleet Sergeant  (MF/SGT)
     Command Master Fleet Sergeant (CMF/SGT)

O-1  Force Ensign  (FENS)
O-2  Force Leader (FLR)
O-3  Force Lieutenant (FLT)
O-4  Major  (MAJ)
O-5  Force Commander (FCDR)
O-6  Colonel  (COL)
O-7  Fleet Colonel (FCOL) 
O-8  Vice Marshal (VMSHL)
O-9  Marshal (MSHL)
O-10 Sector Marshal (SMSHL)


The high end NCO ranks require some explanation.. A Ship\'s Sergeant is the
senior NCO of either a Marine Company or any detachment smaller than a
Battalion.  A Master Gunner is a Marine serving in a 
technical position without command authority.

Fleet Sergeants are different from Command Fleet Sergeants in that the
CF/SGT is the senior NCO of a Battalion or larger unit.. There is an
unofficial rank of Regimental Fleet Sergeant for the CF/SGT of a Regiment.
Master Fleet Sergeant is the rank given to senior NCOs of entire fleets or
subsectors.  There is one Sector Command Master Fleet Sergeant per sector,
and the Force Master Fleet Sergeant has his office on Capital. 

Enlisted Marines who make Corporal may apply to OCS.  This is the only path
to commission.  There are no Academy Marine officers.  A new officer can
expect his year as Force Ensign to be spent as a gopher for senior officers
as he learns the ropes of his new position.

An Enlisted Marine E-5 or above may request a bust of one rank and "Career"
status.  That marine has acknowledged he has been promoted beyond his
means, and wishes to freeze his rank at the one he just left.  Such a NCO
uses the word "Career" before his rank in most situations.  {example: "I am
Career Gunnery Sergeant Redding, and you now belong to me and the Emperor.
You had better pray he comes for you, because I will show you no mercy.")
If the Marine Force determines that the request is being made for any
reason other than a true devotion to duty, the petition will be denied and
the NCO will usually be separated.

Career NCO\'s are accorded extra respect for giving up advancement in order
to stay in the position where they can serve best.  In game terms, Career
NCOs should have a +1 Reputation (large group).

MARINE OPERATIONS

More than any other service, the Marines are dedicated to the raw
application of force.  Marines are not trained in the peacekeeping or
limited operations that the Army excels at.  When the Marines engage in
combat, their creed is to use the maximum amount force possible to
overwhelm and destroy the enemy in the minimal amount of time.  Marines are
infamous for using fusion weapons to destroy an entire building to root out
a single sniper.

The Marine Force\'s main job is to secure a foothold on hostile worlds.  To
this end, all Marines are trained in rapid interface techniques and
equipped with the absolute best the Imperium can give them.  The usual
target for the Marines is the world\'s starport, which coincidentally is
usually heavily equipped with ground to space defenses. 

Marines are also tasked to board vessels in deep space whenever called
upon.  This can be as simple as assisting in a deep space rescue or customs
inspection, or as difficult as boarding a crippled enemy warship against
armed opposition.  If there is any one mission the Marines dread, it is
fighting their way through the killing zones of an unfamiliar starship.

Outside of open warfare, the Marines still serve an important duty.  One of
the most visible Marine roles is their part in piracy suppression.  When a
pirate base or haven is located, the Marines will raid it to both insure
its destruction and to secure whatever intelligence might be found.
Imperial Intelligence has found that the personal nature of these actions
shocks the backers of the pirates, and can effectively scare the backers
into moving operations elsewhere.

Non-Fleet Marines play a variety of roles in the Imperial defense
establishment.  Marines are the Emperor\'s troops, and guard all Imperial
facilities.  The most visible of these guards are the  sophonts assigned to
guard Imperial consulates on member worlds.  These Marines are selected for
their appearance and poise, and serve as a daily reminder of the implied
force that the Imperium controls.

MARINE ARMORED CAVALRY REGIMENTS

The only truly heavy force in the Marine arsenal, Armored Cav regiments are
fairly rare.  The regulations call for one MarArmCav regiment for every
eight line regiments.  In effect there is one MarArmCav regiment for every
four subsectors.  These units are capable of devastating entire worlds, and
sit only one step below unrestricted orbital bombardment in the list of
options the Imperium has to a crisis.  

MarArmCavs are never committed without a clear, immediate threat that
warrants the Imperium releasing it\'s full power.  A MarArmCav requires
heavy support from the navy for transport and supply, and given the
Marines\' "no holds barred" approach means whatever force is on the
receiving end of this force had better be prepared for a desperate fight.

A MarArmCav Regiment consists of a Headquarters company (70 men, 2 Intrepid
tanks, 4 Astrin APCs), three Armored Cavalry Battalions (165 men, 40
Intrepid tanks, 2 Astrin APCs), a Meson Artillery Section (70 men, 8 meson
sleds, 4 G-carriers)

MARINE TRADITIONS

The Imperial Marine Force traces it\'s roots to a detachment of Rule of Man
Marines stranded on Sylea at the beginning of the Long Night.  The RoM
Marines were in turn based on the assault troops of the Terran
Confederation.  These troops were drawn from several sources on Earth, most
notably organizations such as the United States Marine Corps, the Royal
Marines, and various airborne and special operations groups.  With such a
long history, the Marines have developed some unique and fiercely guarded
traditions.

Marines were a maroon beret.  This beret is only granted to a recruit after
he successfully completes rapid interface training, and is awarded in a
very solemn ceremony.  It is a point of pride for the Marines that incoming
Army troops should be greeted by Marines who have taken off their helmets
and donned the berets.  This is a subtle hint that the hard work has been
done, and that the Army is just coming in to "mop up."

Another tradition that the Marines have fought long and hard to retain is
the bagpipe.  Marine pipers have been around since the Sylean Marines were
founded, and it doesn\'t appear that the armor-rending wails will ever fade
from Marine lore.  One of the most coveted skill badges is Master Piper,
and a Marine lives his tour of duty hearing the pipes daily.

Some have theorized that the only reason the Marines cling to the pipes so
intensely is that the sound of bagpipes in a confined area like a starship
drives the Navy insane.  Whether or not this true, a Regimental band of
pipes and drums remains one of the Marines\' best recruiting tools.

Strangely, the Marines have turned the pipes to their combat advantage.
While it is a myth that Marines land with a piper equipped with a
battle-dress mounted set of pipes, they have adapted the sound to an
effective psychological warfare tool.  Marine drop ships are equipped with
powerful radio jammers, and also drop electronic warfare pods that are
likewise intended to interfere with enemy communications and sensors.  The
Marines play prerecorded bagpipes with enough strength to drown out the
enemy\'s own transmissions.  The demoralizing effect of having your radio
channels suddenly flooded by "Sylea the Brave", along with the knowledge
that the music indicates that you will soon be dealing with the
overwhelming, merciless fire of a Marine unit, has caused more than one
defender to immediately surrender.

In defiance of their "spit and polish" image while drilling, the Marines
are notorious for covering their personal armor, equipment, and vehicles
with all sorts of graffiti.  Marines may scrawl commentary about the enemy,
outsized Imperial Sunbursts or regimental crests, or cartoons based on
perceived characteristics of vehicle commanders.  While officially frowned
on, this activity is tolerated due to the Marines\' battlefield abilities.

One Marine tradition with roots strongly grounded in sound tactical
thinking is the cutlass.  Originally, the Marines retained the ancient
weapon merely as a symbol.  During the Chaestin War immediate preceding the
founding of the Imperium, the Sylean Marines found themselves called on to
board and capture disabled enemy vessels.  The powerful fusion weapons used
by the Marines tended to cause more damage than necessary, prompting Star
Sergeant J. Redding to begin carrying his dress cutlass into battle.  

The cutlass proved quite useful in breaching enemy vacc suits. Also, the
sight of a squad of Marines in battledress waving swords often proved to be
too much for the ship\'s crews, who would often surrender without a fight.

In honor of Star Sergeant Redding, all Marines learn basic swordplay as
part of their initial training.  Many Marines have gone on to win great
acclaim as fencers or duelists.

PLANETARY DEFENSE TROOPS

The largest arm of the Imperial ground forces triad is made up of the
individual armies of the member worlds.  Almost infinite in variety, these
forces provide the depth of defense that keeps the Imperium safe.

Each world of the Imperium is responsible for its own defense.  While the
Imperium will assist the member worlds, the final responsibility for a
government\'s survival rests with that government.  To that end, most worlds
raise at least a token force of armed troops.

On many worlds of the Core, these armies are little more than glorified
police forces.  With no strife since the Civil War, and the borders over a
year\'s travel away, these worlds have decided that there is little cause to
spend billions of Credits maintaining a force that will have few
responsibilities beyond keeping their weapons clean.  The closer you get to
the frontiers, the more interested planetary governments get in maintaining
an effective protection against outside aggressors.

On other planets with more repressive governments, there may exist large
forces mostly gear towards the suppression of internal dissent.  At the
most extreme, these forces can act as an occupying force in their own
homeland.

It should be stressed that local forces are completely independent of the
Imperial chain of command.  They answer only to their governments.  This
freedom also means that these armies are able to procure equipment to their
own standards, rather than using the Imperial standard.

Local defense forces, also called PDF (Planetary Defense Forces), are
divided in three broad categories.

GROUND FORCES

PDF Ground Forces are similar in concept to the Imperial Army, but
specialized for local conditions and technology.  Freed of the need to
travel far from their home world, these forces can use levels of
mechanization that most Imperial planners can only dream of.

Since the implied mission of a PDF unit is defensive in nature, planners
tend to stock up on the items that will help them hold off a besieging
force.  Vast stocks of artillery ammo, along with extensive spare part and
fuel depots are usually foremost in priority.  

An exception to this rule is balkanized worlds, where the various
nation-states will be arming not just for defense, but possible against
each other.  These worlds have a history of engaging in conventional arms
races of almost suicidal proportions, since they know that the Imperium
stands ready to intervene if things get out of hand.

PDF ground forces are the last place a traveller is likely to see tracked
vehicles used in any front-line role.  Jewell (Spinward Marches/Jewell) is
notable for equipping it\'s PDF with tracked and wheeled vehicles.  A desire
to keep cost low, along with the cluttered nature of Jewell\'s cities, make
these vehicles effective even against modern grav tanks.

Local forces in the Imperium use a bewildering number of organizational
plans and formats.  Almost any imaginable plan, no matter how crazy, has
been tried on at least one world.  It\'s not uncommon to encounter units
with titles like Legion, Cohort, Band, or anything else from human history.

NAUTICAL FORCE COMMAND

Also known as the "wet navy," the NFC is found on worlds with significant
oceans.  Often an addition to the ground forces, the NFC is strongest on
balkanized worlds of moderate technology (tech 6-9) with more than fifty
percent hydrosphere.  In these situations, the wet navy can become the
dominant military force on a world or in a nation.

Wet Navies are rarely much more than glorified search and rescue
operations. Once grav vehicles become common, the need for massive warships
fades.  The height of naval technology is seen at TL 8.

Since water interferes with most sensors, the Nautical Force Command
becomes a convenient hiding place for planetary defense weapons such as
meson-equipped submarines or secret supply depots for system defense boats
on the ocean floor.  An Earthlike world with large oceans can hide any
number of surprises for an invader.

Of all the PDF forces, the Wet Navy tends to be the most tradition bound.
For many races, the first truly organized military effort was the navy, so
the sense of history is strong for these sailors.

CLOSE ORBIT AND AEROSPACE CONTROL COMMAND

The third leg of the PDF triad is COACC.  This branch is responsible for
the defense of the world\'s airspace, from ground level to geosynchronous
orbit.  They also have responsibility for defense of any in-system assets
such as gas giants or secondary settlements on other worlds.  In many
systems, COACC is responsible for carrying out custom inspections and also
serves as a rescue service.  

There is considerable debate in the Imperium over the viability of
atmospheric fighters.  Many feel them to be anachronisms, without purpose
against fighter craft designed for the rigors of space combat.  The other
school holds that vehicles built explicitly for air to air combat hold a
great advantage over more general purpose interface vehicles.  Both sides
in the debate can point to various battles that seem to give support to
their views.

Many worlds without real navies of their own give COACC operation of the
system defense boats.  This allows a planet to have a consistent defense
structure from deep space to the planet\'s surface.  The majority of worlds
that can afford SDB\'s prefer to organize them as a separate service.

On balkanized worlds, the various national COACCs (more often called "Air
Forces") can field a wide variety of different purpose built bombers, recon
craft, and fighters.  On single government worlds, where the mission is
defense, the most common vehicle seen is the hypersonic interceptor.

COLONIAL FORCES

In times of great peril, such as a major war, planetary forces may be
volunteered for Imperial service.  Such forces are referred to as "Colonial
Units," and are generally considered to be of a lesser quality than
front-line troops.  Regardless, these troops can take a great deal of
pressure of harried commanders by assuming garrison and security roles,
freeing up units for the front lines.  Since these are not Imperial units,
their equipment and training can vary wildly, making it hazardous to mix
them with Imperial units.  During the 5th Frontier War, there was one
recorded case of an Imperial Marine point-defense system firing on
approaching colonials because their non-standard G-carriers were not in the
fire control computer\'s memory.

Finding amino acids is but one tiny part of the problem.  Now find twenty
specific ones, all left-handed, and assemble them into usable chains to make
a valuable protein without destroying your building blocks.  Now do it a
thousand times in the thousand different configurations that will fit
together perfectly to may one usable cell.  The odds turn out to be greater
than 20^100 against*.  Not too promising.

That\'s what the diplomats and nobility are for.  Think of the Marines as
the tools of last resort, sort of like nuclear weapons during the Cold War.
 The threat of having the Marines come down on you can be very persuasive.

None of which requires battledress, which was my point. 

I have done my fair share of peacekeeping/LIC/security-and-stability
operations, including writing the exit strategy for US Forces-Haiti. There
are many times when armored force -- be it M1\'s, armored HMMWV\'s, or
battledress -- is the only way to go, but there are many more where it is
simply counter-productive to put that much firepower on the line. Maintain
the threat, yes -- but in reserve, behind a screen of regular troops who
can actually talk to people and just maybe understand what is really going on.

[Vietnam arguably *was* a full-blown war, certainly in its latter stages,
that was wished away as a "counter-insurgency" the way Korea was a "police
action". A better model to consider would be the Marine interventions in
Haiti and Nicaragua earlier this century, the Moro uprising in the
Philippines, or the US-UN operations since 1991.]

You must also consider that if you use it, it will break -- even in the
Imperium. Battledress units are tremendously logistics-intensive compared
to light infantry, and the Imperial Marines routinely operate far from
their support infrastructure. They would stand down to the lowest level
consistent with the threat, lest the hare become mired in his own baggage,
or worse not be able to recover in time to meet a real threat.

I\'ll take a look at the proposal and get back to you offline. You might
want to check with John Trasler <trasler@trasler.demon.co.uk> for what he\'s
said about the Imperial Marines in the GT: Imperial Navy draft.

I dont want to start a Vietnam flamewar, on the grounds there is enough
shit to stick to everyone in that fiasco, but I think part of the problem
was that it was a war that was partly conventional action (Kontum, Khe Sanh
or Tet), partly terrorism and counterterrorism (Saigon except for Tet and
just at the end), part insurgency (\'routine\' ambushes and closing of
roads), partly diplomatic (attempts to get the allies of each side
involved/uninvolved, or avoid the same), and partly political (the various
coups, countercoups, the various Buddhist Crises etc).

One problem was that these were occouring simultaneously in time, and
sometimes simultaneously in space.

Given that the US Army was only doctrinally equipped to do the first and a
little bit of the third, and kept working at cross-purposes to the various
orginisations trying to do the other parts, then it wasnt really surprising
to me that bad things kept happening to them.

Where this cuts back to the Imperium is that most internal wars and revolts
will be such a complex mixture. To complicate things further, \'the
Imperium\' doesnt really operate as an entity in most Imperial
entanglements, as it is a government of Men, not Laws.

For example, let us assume we have an internal revolt on a world. The
world\'s government have annoyed certain elements of the Imperial power
structure, and those elements want to show their displeasure without
actually intervening.

The solution is to invite the rebel leader to a dinner party at the
Marquis\', which will indicate to the government\'s outside supporters that
the rebels too have powerful off-world friends. Now, the problem with this
is Che is holed up in the mountains, surrounded by government troops and
cant RSVP.

Therefore, the Marquis asks his friend the Admiral if he could arrange for
an invitation to be hand delivered - both sides are careful to allow enough
room for confusion to enter, in order to ensure deniability later.

The Admiral therefore issues a set of suitably confused and contradictory
instructions to his subordinates. His subordinates, treading a careful path
between doing what he wants and not being so impolite as to ask directly as
what he wants, detail a squad to get onto the world, find the rebel leader,
and give him this package, then get either a receipt for it or him and get
out.

It\'s a black mission, so the whole thing is deniable. Your records will
indicate you never left. You have 28 days.

And God thinks this one\'s important.

This model also explains why the Imperial Army maintains its own "forced
entry" units.  As I see it, there are four paradigma for forced-entry
operations (as experienced by US forces in the Pacific during WW II):

1.  Marines seize the terrain in question.  Examples would be Tarawa and
Iwo Jima.  Here, the USMC took all the terrain, with Army participation
(if any; my ready-to-hand history references mention none) pretty well
limited to garrisoning the land in question.

2.  Marines seize a beachhead, and are relieved by the Army prior to the
final conquest.  Guadalcanal falls under this category.  The island was
by no means secure when 1st MarDiv departed, but the soldiers of the
"Americal" division came ashore (several months after 1st MarDiv hit the
beach) unopposed, and finished the job of securing Guadalcanal.

3.  Army forces seize and expand a beachhead, without Marine
assistance.  The reconquest of the Philippines falls under this heading,
as did the New Guinea campaign.  This category provides the Army with
the justification of maintaining its own forced-entry-capable units.

4.  Army and Marine forces conduct simultaneous forced-entry operations,
on different parts of the objective.  Okinawa is the best example of
this, where the Marines landed in the north, and the Army landed in the
south.  A Traveller equivalent would be the invasion of Terra during the
Solomani Rim War.  Without the Imperial Army forced-entry operations,
the Marines could not, by themselves, have secured enough territory for
follow-on reinforcements to land.

I especially expect Marines to train for unarmored (or lightly-armored) 
action if the armor has a high maintenance time compared to active
time, or a cost high enough that every marine doesn\'t get a set unless

Quite true, especially your last point (calling for artillery).  IMHO,
anyone who, given choices of Traveller skills, generates a combat-arms
character (rank E5 or above) without Forward Observer skill is
criminally negilgent.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
I was reading Jim Dugan\'s _How to Make War_ a few nights ago. He
presented the statistic that more than 50% of the battlefield casualties 
inflicted during World War 2 were caused by artillery fire. In the North
African theater, where more open and flattish terrain existed, the
percentage of casualties from artillery was more like 75%.

He also presented a case that most of the rifles in an infantry company
were pretty much ineffective at causing casualties - the vast majority of 
casualties inflicted by an infantry company came from their machine guns 
and other special equipment.

Guns don\'t kill people. Heavy weapons kill people.

I suspect this would still be the case at higher tech levels if Hydro
percentages over ~95%, or if lots of the population are water dwelling
species.  Of course, at this point it will be as \'triphibian\' as anyone
else, but it\'s \'natural habitat\' would still be water.

At high TLs \'ships\' (submarines) merge with spacecraft (SDBs), and \'boats\'
with grav vehicles (tanks, APCs, artillery sleds).  On a personal level,
wet navy personnel are likely to be trained in the use of Protected Forces
equipment like Battle Dress and Battle Pods, the latter being particularly
likely in deep, high-pressure environments, or when the species using them
don\'t actually have legs!

Like a whole other army besides the one above the surface.

In addition, economically and strategically important installations,
including entire cities, can be found on ocean bottoms.

The interference with sensors tends to imply a certain need for specialised
units to operate in nautical environments.  They would of course also need
to be able to operate outside the water as well.

IMHO, the Wet Navy would survive as a mix of specialised underwater units,
as well as relatively conventional units with \'wet\' traditions.  They would
tend towards being a mix of Protected Forces trained lift infantry and
cavalry units, as well as artillery, engineers and so on.  They may even
operate some SDBs and other planetary defence units!  They would have a
distinct advantage in training, and a relative one in equipment, over
standard units in a maritime environment, and would be quite capable in a
\'normal\' environment (being grav equipped).

They would regularly spend time in inhospitable places - like the bottom of
the Marianas Trench - and would very possibly consider themselves an elite
force.

And in a campaign, they will be the ones that appear out of nowhere, and
\'hit the beaches\' while your sensors are scanning the sky...

Yep.  And if you ignore them, they\'ll kick your a**.

Depends on how you work your probabilities. Is there a characteristic
of amino acids that gives them a tendency to form useful proto-protien
assemblies? Life is seen to be self-organizing to a great extent, it\'s
possible that this self-organizational tendency occurs further down 
the developmental chain than what we call "life".

I\'ve even seen some work on proto-life chemical reaction chains, 
chains that were self-sustaining, relatively self-stablizing, competitive
and quite complex. These chains may have arisin by themselves in
the pre-life chemical goop of Earth, and in localized protected
environments (deep earth rock strata?) may have led to true lifeforms.
All it takes is one chemical reaction developing a film that allows it to
keep it\'s catalysts to itself... 

We have seen life occur on one world, proving that it is *possible*. 
It\'s even possible that this life is based on chemicals (even lifeforms!)
that came from other worlds - in that case, whatever brought these
"seeds" to Earth may have brought them to thousands or millions of 
other planets.

We have insufficient evidence to say that Earth is a special case.
When you say the chances are 20^100 against, you\'re making
assumptions that can\'t be checked until we consistently *don\'t*
find life elsewhere.

I think it depends. Verhoeven, for example, always uses a goodly amount of
gore. Granted, it\'s not the intensity of Saving Private Ryan. The intensity
in the film came mostly from the audience\'s knowledge that stuff like that
really did happen.

When the audience sees the mutilated members of the devestated Mormon colony
in Starship Troopers, or sees the bad guys messily gun down civilians on the
escalator in Total Recall, there\'s a certain distance for the audience.

Of course, there\'s the third point: big and well-respected directors like
Spielberg don\'t usually use massive amounts of visceral gore as a tool in
their films, so when it is seen, it adds much to the shock value of it.

>ObTrav: how realistic is the violence in multimedia entertainment in
>the 3I? How *violent* is it? Or does it vary from place to place?


It\'s a tough call. "Realistic violence" doesn\'t have to necessarily be what
people think of as violent at all. For example, the sequence in Unforgiven
where one of the "bad guys" gets shot in the belly with the rifle. The scene
was realistic, but it wasn\'t particularly violent.

However, I think that the violence in multimedia entertainment will vary
from place to place. The Imperium is built on trade, not on censorship. The
Imperium doesn\'t tend to meddle in the affairs of individual member worlds.
I think it would be up to specific worlds to decide what their citizens are
allowed to see.

I think that some entertainment would be violent, some entertainment
wouldn\'t be. In the Third Imperium there are potential markets for every
product... somewhere. In fact, violent media might be used in ways we
haven\'t imagined yet:

Imagine a world that staurates its population with extremely realistic
violent imagery... in order to cultivate the message that violence is bad.

Sounds like a creationist argument to me.

Usually when I hear this argument the creationist is trying to demonstrate
how absurd it is to believe that even a single cell could somehow fall 
together
all at once and from scratch, as a result of purely random processes.  Yes,
it would be absurd to believe that could happen, but to the best of my
knowledge no serious biologist does believe it.  Straw men are easy to
knock down.

Evolution doesn\'t just operate by chance, it saves intermediate results and
builds on them.

Try the "Yahtzee" experiment sometime.  Take five six-siders, roll all five of
them repeatedly, and count how many times you have to roll before you get
five of a kind.  It takes a *long* time.

Now start rolling again, but this time do what any Yahtzee player would do.
As soon as you get two or more of a kind, set them aside and start trying to
match that number with the remaining dice.  Once any die matches, set it
aside too.  See how long it takes you to reach five of a kind this time.  I
guarantee it will reliably take a small fraction of the time it took in the 
first
experiment.

The difference is more striking when you start with a larger set of dice.

ObTrav: Has anyone actually done any statistical studies of how likely an
Earthlike world is using the CT world-building system?  I wonder what the
Drake equation looks like for the Third Imperium. . .

Don\'t place too much faith in odds... as any bookmaker will tell you ;)

Anyone can stack odds and numbers to make something look more or less
probable. Frankly, I don\'t know enough about the subject to really argue it.
However, I\'d be willing to bet I could find someone who wrote a paper that
says that the odds are better than anyone had previously expected.

Until we actually really get down on planets and look, we really won\'t know.
Anyone who professes to have solid knowledge either way is suspect, at least
in my opinion.

Yes, we *can* make educated guesses. It\'s true. No matter how educated the
guesses are, educated still simply qualifies guess.

Yeah, there are.  They still work ok, except getting apps for them is a

Canonical info or Solomani history is almost zip in this item. It\'s a game,
somewhat akin to Imperium, but with a map made up of subsectors you
can swap around with each other (and are supposed to for game
variety). Aslan vs Solomani, but so generic about ships and planets so
as to give no historical info.

The game is fun, but nowhere near as good a game as Imperium (which
uses a similar system to portray the 1st through Nth Interstellar Wars).

counters representing comabt vessels and ground forces.  I liked it for 
several reasons.
1)  The scale of the game is small, so you can set it up and play it quickly.
2)  The map is composed of eight sub-maps, which the players lay out in 
various patterns prior to play.  The astrography changes every game.
3)  It includes limited economics and diplomacy.
4)  It has some nice chrome, particularly the "Dark Nebula" of the title.  
This is an uncharted region that the players can explore in hopes of 
discovering a variety of possible advantages.
As to solid canon information, it\'s a little weak.  My copy just had a short

No statistical studies, but I am building a program based on Book 6 and

dares not put it to the touch, to win or lose it all."

ObTrav:  The current thread concerning the Imperial Marines inspired my
posting of this toast.  Additionally, long-standing units of the
Imperial Army and Marines would have their own traditional toasts and
ceremonies.  "Prop Blast", anyone?

For instance, IMTU, in the 1199th Jump Infantry Regiment, part of
initial drop qualification with the unit (regardless of one\'s drop-troop
training documentation) is a "Hell on a half-shell" drop (i.e., ablative
reentry kits in place of the normal drop capsule).

You have to admit, toasts and traditions such as this add an authentic
martial flavor to a campaign.

I\'d tend to agree.  I can\'t see an IM so drilled in the use of BD that he
rolls out of bed in the middle of the night to have a slash (pee, wee, whiz,
et al.), thinking "Must put on Battle Dress... Must put on Battle Dress..."

And economics do play a part in every military budget, and I imagine the
IM\'s being no different?  In a perfect universe, perhaps...

I still think an IM would work off a warrior code, such as
defending/attacking/killing under ANY situation, fully equipped or not, is
the military norm.

Of _course_ not!  After all, a Marine _that_ accustomed to battledress
would not even stir to relieve him/her/itself; the catheter (or
equivalent) that is part of battledress would be second nature.  (Note: 
add "Incontinence" [at reduced cost; only applies when battledress is
not available in a combat situation] to the list of disadvantages
available to Marine templates....)

To me, this gets back to the perfect universe, throwing out all those
adventure seeds about corrupt officials or the syphoning of funds for one
project to boost another, less palatable project.  Why?  Because the money
always gets through to where it is going and therefore, no corruption in
that regard... a perfect universe?

Money is always an issue with governments, sure they can raise 2.5 bill (and
that\'s just for BD), but do they spend it all on what\'s needed? ("Well, we
can trim off .5 of a bill from the defence BD budget to get your office
redecorated Senator Extravegance?").

I\'m sure that in WWII, US Marines were used as plain old grunts at times
(not purely for beach assaults and such -- as storm troopers), who spent
weeks/months trudging through swamps and jungles clearing out enemy pockets
of resistance.  I don\'t see the IM\'s doing the assault thing then saying,
"It\'s knock-off time... where\'s the army?"

I know some turretheads that would stoutly disagree with you here.  History
also shows that vehicle crews who have lost their vehicles were quite
capable of taking up a small arm and fighting alongside the grunts.  Tobrok
was just one example, when the city was under seige, vehicle crews defended
on foot after losing their vehicles or running out of ammo for them.  I
personally think you are selling IM\'s short.

I remember reading an article in an Encyclopedia Britannica yearbook about
evolved traits. The author identified several traits that evolved
independently in several different species, which he called "universals",
and traits that appeared only once in the evolutionary record. I forget
what he called these other specific traits. The point was that some traits
are so useful they become dominant in every species that develops them
while others, though they may be useful, do not have an overwhelming
advantage.

The interesting part is where he listed several universal and specific
traits. Universals included things like specialized tissues, vision,
flight, and intelligence. He claimed there is something so advantageous in
these traits that they reappear over and over.

Specific traits included things like bone and crossed breathing/digestive
passages. Though vertibrates are common, they all descended from a common
ancestor and bones were never developed in any other evolutionary line.
There were other examples I can\'t remember. I could look up the reference
if anyone is really interested.

I find it interesting that many sci-fi aliens have things like
undifferentiated tissues and no eyesight to make them "alien", but nearly
all have skeletons and combined breathing/eating orfices.

Well, if the star systems one jumps to are in our universe, then it has to
be FTL travel because there are no star systems within a few light-weeks of
Earth but there are lots within a few jumps.

The idea has been proposed before to solve the "space is 2D" problem. Alas,
there are many canonical references to Traveller star maps matching both
jump and normal space travel distances and directions. Additionally,
interstellar borders in the OTU only make sense if jump space maps to 2
dimensions.

I disagree and yet agree.

The historical reason that is usually cited for the use of the atom bombs at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki is quite similar to the one Doug\'s Force Ensign
gives. There\'s also a story, possibly a myth, about the Soviet Union\'s
response to hijacking terrorists: simply blow up the whole plane. It\'s
common in war for one side to use extreme measures to terrorize the enemy
into believing that resistance is futile.

However, the method doesn\'t always work. There are many cases in which the
use of excessive force actually strengthens the will and resolve of the
people to win. Take a look at Germany\'s invasion of the Soviet Union during
World War II. The Nazis were brutal and absolutely merciless, but after the
initial shock was over the Soviets fought even harder. They knew that the
only way to survive was to win. Then, years later, the same thing happened
in reverse in Afghanistan. The Soviets were brutal and absolutely merciless,
and it only strengthened the resolve of the various factions they were
fighting after the initial shock wore off.

The use of excessive force, at least in my humble opinion, is ultimately a
gamble. I\'ve never seen the Imperium as being the type to gamble.

In Doug\'s defense, the Imperial marines aren\'t American marines, or British
marines, or any other marines that exist (or have existed) in the real
world.

The Imperial marines are not specially trained soldiers that land in Higgins
boats, en masse, to take a beach. Imperial marines exist as well trained
pilots for the biggest and baddest force multiplier the world has ever
known: battle dress.

Imperial marines work in small groups with heavy powered armor with really
nasty and brutal heavy weapons. The high-tech, state of the art nature of
their battle dress means that Imperial marines simply *cannot* be used just
like infantry.

It\'s possible that my vision of Imperial marines is heavily influenced by
the M.I. Starship Troopers. Marines would be sent in to quickly demoralize a
world and, if required, secure a landing point for infantry to come and do
the grunt work.

The closest comparison for Imperial marines in the modern day are combat air
pilots and tank crews.

In their aircraft, pilots are missile firing, target bombing, smart-bomb
guiding badasses. Outside of their planes, they are just guys with guns. All
of their extensive and expensive training and skill in using high tech
weapons is gone.

In their tanks, tank crews are big-gun shooting, building smashing, infantry
crushing badasses. Outside of their tanks, they are just guys with guns.
When they\'re outside their tanks, all of their training, experience and
skill goes to waste.

Inside battledress, an imperial marine is a brick-busting, lightning spewing
hardcore badass. His training, experience and skill is in using the ultimate
single-man force multiplier the world has ever known. Outside of his suit,
the Imperial marines skill, training and experience goes to waste.

American marines in WWII were often used as vanilla infantry because their
skill sets overlapped with those of infantry. You\'ll also note that
sometimes infantry were used to take beaches, which should have been done by
marines. However, in the modern day, only a sadistic or utterly desperate
American leader would use combat air pilots or tank crews as vanilla
infantry.

I think you missed Doug\'s point. He wasn\'t selling them short. Look at it
this way:

I\'m an Imperial marine. I am trained to wear a suit of powered armor. High
tech powered armor is nothing like modern day body armor by any stretch of
the imagination. It\'s climate controlled. It\'s impervious the the majority
of small arms. It lowers the volume of the loud explosions outside. It saves
me from being blinded by darkening at just the right moment. Combat for me
is not about sighting down the barrel of my rifle and firing. It\'s about
keeping an eye on my HUD, my suit computer assessing the value of potential
threats. My suit allows me to zoom in on an enemy bunker with the image
superimposed in just such a way that I can still view the battlefield. When
I jump, robotic legs and maybe even contragrav packs or gravitic thrusters
allow me to soar through the air. I have most likely never smelled burning
flesh, plastic and rubber on a high intensity battlefield.

If I get out of my suit I am at a distinct disadvantage and my chances of
being killed are entirely different. I am not an idiot. I know this
inherently. I am not infantry. I don\'t want to be infantry. I am a
battledress pilot. I am an Imperial marine. If I get out of my suit am I
completely helpless? No. Maybe I can get to my sidearm. Maybe I can pick up
a falled rifle. However, I am now helpless. I am a specialist without my
specialty. I know how to fire an ACR, I remember from basic. Actually, I was
pretty good with the ACR. However, while the Imperial infantry soldiers were
drilling day after day with their ACRs, I was practicing smashing into
entrenchments in a suit made of a high-tech, ultra-dense alloys that also
has the added bonus to increase my strength to superhuman levels. While the
impie infantry was out there, making an art out of the belly crawl, with
live rounds going over their heads, I was being hit with a barrage of false
suit failures.

I know how to react when my oxy-tank has been ruptured by an armor piercing
shell. I know how to deal with a sudden failure of the climate control unit.
I know that sometimes the suit can get touchy and switch to the backup
battery when a micronuke goes off nearby. I know how to jettison my ammo to
avoid losing a large chunk of my suit and my left arm when it\'s warranted.
That infantry soldier belly-crawled though. He\'s a hell of alot better than
me at doing it.

Can an Imperial marine survive on the field of battle without his armor?
It\'s possible. However, any battlefield hostile enough to warrant the use of
Imperial marines in powered armor is likely hot, hot, hot.

You\'re also making a very unfair comparison by going back in time and
picking a very specialized situation.

1.) Tank crews and their training programs were entirely different in WWII
than they are now. It takes a greater degree of specialization to be a
modern tanker than a WWII tanker. If I remember correctly, in that campaign
the danger of running out of fuel and ammo was always looming for both
sides. As a result, the the training was more intensive. I may be off base,
but I\'m reasonably sure I\'ve read or heard that somewhere. My own historical
specialty is the time period between the Reconstruction and World War II,
focusing strongly on the early 20th century in America. I\'m not as up on my
WWII history as I should be.

2.) You\'re talking about a siege where the soldiers in question had only a
few options: fight, surrender or die. Running out of fuel and ammo was not a
matter of if but when.

3.) Allied WWII tank crews were much "closer" to combat than modern tank
crews are. Their effective range for punching through German armor was
relatively short. The ports on the tank were big open holes, which forced
the tankers to experience much of the experience of combat in the open. The
danger from enemy infantry was much more real to an Allied WWII tanker than
a modern day tanker. Ultimately, a modern day tank crew without a tank is
utterly useless in the roles that tanks perform and, all things being equal,
they are far less useful than the same number of infantry soldiers in the
roles that infantry soldiers perform.

If an Imperial marine is caught with his pants down, he\'s going to haul ass
to get in his suit. If the suit is unavailable (because it\'s destroyed) he\'s
going to try to get to a place where he can get a new suit. He is more like
a pilot than anything else.

I\'m not trying to insult tankers or pilots here, nor am I trying to talk out
of my ass. The fact remains that, all things being equal, someone with more
training and more experience with something will be much better than someone
else. I\'m not  downplaying natural talent here, it does (and should) play a
factor.

Tankers aren\'t trained to be rank and file infantry, nor are pilots. I think
that Impie marines will be very similar.

tell that to the marines in the 4th and fifth frontier wars... as evidenced
by AHL, they fight aboard ship without BD.

At least IMTU, Marines are all TRAINED to use BD, but most actual mission
time is spent in regular uniforms... BD suits are generally issued to
troops who need it for the operational mission.

The combat paralysis doesn\'t make much sense to me; The ImMar training
cycles would assure that they were as prepared for fighting outside the
suit as in it... BD is just too expensive for "Normal" operations. Combat
armor, however is typical marine "Threat Environment", and typicall "Low
Threat" is the CES, as per the TD on earth.

IMTU, Battle Dress ops were probably a bit rarer that the TU\'s described
by Chris and Doug. That Super-Suit wasn\'t something they handed out
to every Marine who passed basic, it was something you *earned* and
kept on earning - because there were a dozen (or more) marines who
would kick your butt to wear your suit if they could. Being a Drop
Commando (or other elite BD trooper) was the best a Marine could be.
Therefore, these BD Troops were frightening even when stark naked.

I think my PC\'s saw a whole squad in Battledress once. They frequently
saw Marines in combat armor, but Battledress - that was something
special. 

Granted, I never ran a middle-of-a-major-war campaign, where you might
have a situation where every super-suit in the Domain was brought
to one battle fleet.

This too, was pretty much how I saw IM\'s and BD in my old campaign, and I
don\'t recall where BD was the equipment of only marines (it has been some
year\'s since I GM\'d a CT game, so I may be forgetting something vital
here?), but thought even army units were equipped with it.  Please, someone
let me know if I am wrong in this?

My old campaign was in the Marches, I featured regular border clashes with
Vargr and Imperial patrols, and the odd Zho vessel testing the water
(Saying, "Whoops!  Sorry Mr Imperial person... I errr... misjumped... I\'m
leaving now! While thinking, "Hmmm, quick response, lucky they fell for the
old \'misjump\' ploy."), so both the army and marine units close to the danger
areas were equipped with BD or CA, depending on different factors (policy,
politics, etc.), but otherwise, not a lot of BD floating about.

As the history old books say, it was to save the lives of all the GI\'s that
would have to fight for the main islands, but the new books say that the
American commanders knew the Japanese were about to capitulate, but did not
tell Truman... the military simply wanted a live test bed for the two
designs while they could use it against the monster that was Japan, the
baby-eating rapists that they were (as they were seen at the time anyway).

No, but I knew of several games once where the IM\'s were based heavily on US
Marines (I didn\'t know of any based upon the British?) of WWII to Vietnam
era, and I\'m sure a lot probably still are (IMHO).  In My game, I had a
generic variety, SF, not real-world based at all.

Which is why they probably take them out of their suits to fight like real
men in certain conflicts.  Personally, I see BD skills no different than any
land-based vehicular skill, the troopie with BD-2 skill can use the suit
better than his mate with BD-1, just like the ground-car -2 driver can keep
his vehicle under control better than the Ground-car -1 driver.

Well, and again, this is just me... but I have never seen BD use as such an
expensive skill as being a pilot.  And I have never seen EVERY IM character
rolled as having BD skill, yet they still went to war and won awards (using
Book 4).  This means that if ALL marines to see combat are BD equipped, that
a 0-level BD skilled marine performed just as good (or better) as a 1-, 2-,
3-, 4-, 5-level BD skilled marine... why bother teaching the skill at all?

Like I said, the tankers I know would dispute this heartily.  Also, I know
several of those have attended the same survival courses as the Aussie north
enders and SAS quite successfully with high ratings.  To say they are
unskilled outside of their vehicles is not a good thing at all, nor is it
truthful.

And why call them Imperial Marines?  Why not call them "Suiters" or some
such, like you call armour crews "Tankers" for example.  The line of thought
I see here is that Marines are like unskilled soldiers who can only perform
with a comodicum of skill in a "vehicle" (BD) they are skilled in using.  It
was kinda put forward that tankers are unskilled soldiers without their
vehicles, so I see the same difference with IM\'s occuring with this argument

It sounds to me that IM\'s cannot fight at all?  No real basic infantry-like
training?  They don\'t have to be skilled at unarmed combat and only lightly
skilled in small-arms usage.  They have a suit that does everything for
them... as long as you can see your target, you will have a good chance to
kill it.  So I assume that with this line of thought, if you take the
"average" IM (not the one that works out doing kickboxing) out of his suit
and put him into a bar brawl against an Imperial grunt (who is trained to
kill with whatever he has handy)... the grunt will win?  My goodness, I
can\'t see any John Wayne like movies of the Imperial Marine Corp!  ;^)

But we are talking about a trained ground troopie, not a pilot or tanker.
He is still a troopie in a suit.  I still see an IM in basic training
learning to be a Grunt before he gets close to a suit that possibly doesn\'t
require the same training as a tank (where you have 3-5 people trained in
their individual jobs and in acting as a "hive mind" for one unit -- the
tank) or much less than an aircraft.

I see IM\'s doing survival courses, firing courses, medical courses (first
aid), stealth training, etc., just like a grunt.  I can see them fielded
without BD in combat to prove worthy of using BD.

I wouldn\'t give a soldier a suit if he didn\'t know everything else.  The
incidence of armour loss on the battlefield would be reasonably med-high, so
would the loss of BD... not a feasable bad-arsed reputation when you lose
the "Battle of Naked Trooper" because "To many troops lost their BD, caused
a complete route.  Enemy swarmed over our armour support and they had to be
abandoned... bloody cowardly marines!"  Not one for the recruiting poster...
plus all the war correspondence filming IM troops without armour cowering
and/or fleeing in every battle where their BD is lost!

It just doesn\'t jell with how I (again, it\'s my opinion) imagine a fierce
Imperial Marine operates...

As opposed to a battlefield hostile enough to warrant grunts in BD (unless I
missed that thing I mentioned about only marines having such armour) with
armour support?

Which puts him in the situation where, if there are no other "vehicles"
(suits) available to him for whatever reasons, our big bad marine is
relegated to the field kitchens out of the way of the real fighting men?

I\'m not having a go at you personally, I\'m just trying to make sense of the

Fairly likely around main sequence stars.

I once detailed every system in four subsectors (Aramis, Regina, Lanth,
Rhylanor) for my campaign. Every world in every system had all possible
data generated (except maps). I had to tweak about 1/3 of the worlds to
make them habitable, which means that 2/3 had habitable temperature ranges
(the main problem) from the start.

Mind you, this was starting with the Travller UWP stats. I haven\'t kept
track of any systems generated from scratch.

Not much history. This is the game system from "Imperium", presented as a
series 120 game. Nice little game, some neat twists, but not a lot of
history. (For one thing, the astromorphic maps are in a different
configuration for each game!)

Quite.

After all, what happens if the enemy fleet reappears and interferes with
resupply and reinforcements.  The Marines may have to fight for several
weeks isolated from their logistic tail. Eventually power cells and oxygen
tanks are depleted, and the BD is effectively out of commission.  These
elite forces will then have to rely on more mundane methods of force
projection... perhaps even as mundane as fatigues and cutlasses <g>

After all, except within the confines of a single system, we aren\'t looking
at a situation with real time intelligence and command/control.  They can\'t
just radio in a request for resupply if their fleet has been forced to jump
out of the system by enemy activity.  There may not have been time to evac
them. It will be at least two weeks before friendlies reappear, maybe longer
if a sufficient force to repel the enemy fleet takes time to assemble.
These troops will *have* to be able to operate without their BD, or at the
first hitch their assault will fail.

YMMV

If you have a different take on the way that they\'re used, you have a
different take on the way that they\'re used. I\'m not going to argue with
that. However, Battle Dress is relatively cheap and the mission directives
of the Imperial Marines are specialized enough that I\'m not sure I can see
much use for the marines if they\'re not tied in with battle dress. That\'s
just my spin on the situation.

Fair enough. My PCs have never actually seen anyone in Battle Dress at all.
Battle dress in IMTU is rare on the order of modern day MBTs and jet
fighters. Most of my campaigns have been distinctly non-military in flavor
anyway.

Some army units are equipped with it. The army units who are equipped with
it would likely have similar problems. However, Imperial marines are a
specialized lot. They strike hard and strike fast from orbit. A requirement
for this is powered armor. Powered armor is the only weapons platform that
can be dropped from orbit effectively and multiply the force strength of the
marines enough to secure the initial beachhead. Powered armor is also the
best weapons platform for onboard defense of the Imperial Navy\'s big ships.

Just to point out that this is a proposal for a GURPS book, so that the
templete for an Imperial Marine *will* include a point or two spent on
Battlesuit.

There is a world of difference between going to training and actually

Why is the 1st Cavalry Divison still called Calalry?  They don\'t seem to
have any horses..  As I pointed out in my essay, the current Imperial
Marines take their lineage from the Sylean marines, who trace themselves
back to a RoM unit.  The RoM Marines were originally drawn from units like
the 82nd Airborne, the USMC, Rangers, Royal Marines.. all the units trained
to fight light and hard.

*sigh*  The original idea was a limited form of Combat Paralysis that
*some* Marines might might have.

Each individula Marine will differ.  Yes, there will be hand to hand
training, simply as a confidence booster if nothing else.

Also, the average Marine has been trained as a fencer (to increase body
awarness) and so can take that trooper down with a pool cue.

Every single soldier in the United States Army learns to fire the M-16A2
rifle.  Only a few MOSs continue to train and fire it after basic.  A
Chaplain\'s Assaistant might only fire his weapon twice a year.  That skill
is going to degrade.

So the Recruit learns some basic infantry tactics before getting into his
suit.  Then he\'s either in the suit of doing jobs like Consulte guard for
the next ten years.  Suddenly one day, his suit fails during a battle, and
he crawls out.  How much of that training will he remember?  He has ten
years of battle habits based around by almost invulnerable to fire.

That\'s fairly ridiculous.  They don\'t make tankers serve as infantry before
their allowed to drive M1\'s.  Battledress infantry is a skilled position,
just like driving a tank or being an artillerist.

Considering that the one suit of BD we\'ve seen for G:T had heavy enough
armor to stop *any* hand-held weapon, I don\'t think that armor loss is
going to be that high.

Anyway, that\'s why the Marines do things like pop micronukes on snipers.

This is what\'s known in military circles as a "fucked up situation."  What
happens when any units logistical tail is cut?  They tend to die.  

Let me make this clear.  I am *NOT* saying that deprived of their armor,
Marines curl up in fetal positions and make whimpering noises.  What I am
saying is that Marines and trained and equipped to use Battledress.  They
are not designed for extended combats, the are designed to provided brief,
precise bursts of overwhelming violence to either neutralize a specific
target or open a breach for follow-on forces.

If they are forced to abandon their battledress, they will probably fight
on, but *they won\'t be as good at it as the Army troops who train for this
situation.*

They train for unarmored ops the way the Coast Guard trains for riot

Actually, this is a good question.  Do nuke dampers permanently
\'absorb\' troublesome radiation or do they \'dampen\' it only so long
as it it powered?

If the former, then NDs can be used to scrub an area clean.
If the latter, then they are only temporary abatement.

I have to agree.

I guess what\'s troubling to me is that Doug\'s vision of the I\'rine\'s is
different
from what I\'m used.  Not bad, just different.  The picutre I have involves
BD as a rare sight.

In Book 1, there is no Battledress skill at all, but then BD probably
didn\'t exist yet.

In Book 4, BD skill is there, but it is difficult to get requiring a roll
of 6 and a TL12+ world.  The automatic skill is Gun Combat.
The second skill (MOS) is either
Gun Cmbt (2/6)
 Zero-G (2/6)
Hvy Wpns (1/6)
Fwd Obs (1/6)
Battledress (1/6 + TL 12+ requirement).

The type of action the I\'rine will see in Book 4 Chargen:
Raid (2/11)
Counter Insurgency (2/11)
Police Action (2/11)
Ships Troops (2/11)
Inernal Security (1/11)
Garrison (1/11)
Training (1/11)

In my mind, the real elite of these were those who went to Commando
School and Protected Forces Training, neither if which involved BD

Command School Skills:  Brawling, Gun Cbt, Demolitions, Wilderness
Survival, Recon, Vacc Suit, Blad Cbt and Instruction.  BD is available
to the Commando Branch, but with the same rarity for a regular marine.

Protected Forces Skills:  Vacc Suit, Zero G Combat

I guess the picture Doug paint\'s says to me that a Marine without
Battledress skills is not a marine.  And that isn\'t interesting to me.
But doing some reading and its not Doug\'s fault.  Seems GT is
BD-happy.

In GT templates, all marines have either BD or Exoskeleton,
but I think that has something to do with the point-based chargen
system that makes it easy to throw a point, or half a point at
just about anything.  (We can debate chargen systems elsewhere).

And Star Mercs drove this home even further.  On page 116,
describing a marine security detachment:

"For formal duties, mariens are armed with the traditional
cutlass and a snub autopistol along with their dress uniforms.
Normal shipboard duties are carried out in everyday uniform,
supplemented by flak jackets and gauss rifles (gauss pistols
for officers) as necessary.  In an alert situation, they don
battledress. . . ."
   "Marines assigned to a downport or other non-space duties
are equipped with battledress and gauss rifles . . ."

Describing a Marine Task Force on page 118:

"All marines are equipped with battledress and armed with
FGMP-12s unless otherwise specified."

"All commandoes are equipped with commando battle dress and
armed with FGMP-12s unless otherwise noted."

I guess the knife-fighting, jungle-humping marine commando is gone.

Whoever is making the BD is getting really wealthy.  If I were the Zhodani,
for the 6th Frontier War, I\'d target the BD manufacturers.


A minor point:
Note:  We\'re already headed for inconsistencies within GT.
The inks not dry on Star Mercs.   On page 21, Marine Commandos
wear Green Berets with a golden sunburst and the words
"All Means To Victory".  So in the end will we have an OTU with
regular marines wearing maroon berets and the commandos wearing
green ones?  I don\'t care which color but I appreciate consistency.

But green?  That will clash with the maroon dress uniform (not that I\'m
a fan of that either, but I think its time to call a fashion consultant.
Things are getting ugly).  ;-)

I admit the "Watchmakers" pushed it a bit, I just took it that they
worked at the instruction of an Engineer, communicating in subtle ways
only millenia of symbiosis can develop. Perhaps even empathy or
psionics. I think that is very deft "hand-waving" on my part, a skill I
employ often. :)

Basic, yes, but in a zone of great potential socio-scientific friction.
Propagation of the species is hard-wired deep within our bio-chemical
framework. Hard to look at the problem objectively, IMHO.

"Nuclear Dampers: A common term, damper units actually may be used to
increase or decrease the stability of atomic nuclei. Projecting from two
separate stations, the intersection of the two transmitted broadcasts
produces as series of nodes and anti-nodes. In the area of the nodes, the
strong nuclear force is enhanced, making the nucleus more stable. In the
area of the anti-nodes, the strong nuclear force is depressed, making the
nucleus much less stable." Book 4, p. 42.

To use nuclear dampers for cleaning up fallout, one sweeps the affected
area with anti-nodes. This reduces the stability (and thus the half-life)
of the radioactive by-products, causing them to decay into more-or-less
harmless substances much more quickly than in nature.

So do I.

I preface my remarks by saying I think Doug is as entitled to his
vision just as much as, but no more than, any of the rest of us.  I
either don\'t understand, or don\'t agree with this vision, cum si cum
sa.  IAC, what I post below is my own muddled vision on the subject
of Marines in Traveller the Game, make of it what you will.

>I guess what\'s troubling to me is that Doug\'s vision of the I\'rine\'s
>is different from what I\'m used.  Not bad, just different. 

IMO, I\'m afraid I have to say it\'s bad, not just different.  The
problem I have is *game* related, not universe related.  

IMO, doing Marines Doug\'s way devalues the entire Marine career when
it comes to developing characters for most types of Traveller Games.
Maybe I\'m wrong, but I think Doug envisions Imperial Marines as
being akin to Heinlein\'s Starship Troopers. Fine, but I don\'t think
Trooper characters work in *most* Traveller scenarios.  IMTU (and I
think most TU\'s) the appearance, availability and use of Powered
Battlesuits is far from routine.  In most cases, Player Characters,
simply don\'t have access to them, and a skill set that focuses on
them is unused and wasted.

Conceptually, when a player says, "I want my character to have
been a Marine."  I\'m thinking Pournelle\'s Line Marine (Johnny
Christian Falkenberg\'s boys) not a Heinlein Starship Trooper.  I
expect lots of infantry "grunt" skills like combat rifeman, ground
tactics, brawling, forward observer and wilderness survival on that
character sheet.  

This kind of character, call him Joe, *does* fit into roleplaying
parties of many kinds.  Merchant Campaign, Joe provides protection
and muscle for the group.  A Mercenary campaign, Joe is one of your
officers or troopers.  Exploration of new planets, Joe protects the
Scientists and Scouts (as if they need it.)  Diplomatic missions,
Joe is the bodyguard or part of the security detail.  Then *when*
the party eventually gets into the kind of combat that roleplaying
parties always get into Joe is the combat wonk and his character
shines.

OTOH, when a player says, "I want my character to have been a Jump
Trooper."  *then* Heinlein\'s Starship Troopers (Johnny Rico\'s mates)
springs to mind.  I expect this character, call him Sam, to be more
like Doug describes...a Powersuit driver with a little infantry
training.  

IMO, Sam doesn\'t mesh with most roleplaying parties nearly as well
as Joe. Sam works fine in a high-tech combat game and he might fit
okay in a mercenary scenario *if* he has that battlesuit, but if he
doesn\'t...  

In most scenarios, IMTU at least, he *isn\'t* going to have a powered
battlesuit, and Sam\'s training is going to be inferior to Joe\'s.
The player, and I, want to be able to build a Marine like Joe more
than we want to build a Marine like Sam.

So, Doug, in your vision how do we get a Joe instead of a Sam out of
the Marine career?  Does Joe come from the Army, while Sam comes
from the Marines?

Yesterday, I posted a suggestion that has been mostly ignored.  I\'ll
briefly present the gest of it again.  

   All Marines are combat rifemen first and specialists second.
   
   All Marines are trained, and continue to train, in infantry
   skills throughout their career.  Every Marine is expected to be
   able to fight and win with ACR and cutlass.
   
   A few Marines are given specialty training in powered Battlesuit
   and/or Jump Capsule use and are assigned tours with *elite* units.
   
   A few Marines are given specialty training in medicine,
   administration, armor or air, too, and are assigned tours with
   support units.
   
   But *all* Marines are always combat rifemen first and foremost.

Personally, I think this works better in *game* terms.  Now, we can
get a general-purpose Marine like Joe (he stayed in the
infantry/line his entire career), and we can get the specialist Sam
too (along with infantry training he received and did several tours
in Battlesuits).  We also can get Hank (infantry, then received
Medic training), Sue (infantry and then grav-tank), Eneri (infantry
and then air), and Rnold (infantry and then commando).

In GURPS game *book* terms, there are lots of career tracks
(Templates) to write and fill the pages.  In game *play* terms,
there are lots of career tracks for players to choose characters
from.  Again, I think this works better than Marines being a force
of specialty Powersuit drivers.

That\'s more than my two cents on this subject and I\'m done.

While I can certainly understand your point of view regarding the relative
abilities of the army and marines in long term deployments, and that your
view is that marines have a different skill set to the army, I am not sure
that your point of view is the same as that of many of the posters on this
list.

This would be no problem if you were simply describing the marines in YTU,
after all "vive le difference".  However, your description is that of the
proposed *canon* marines.  I thought you were posting your proposal in order
to receive constructive criticism, and to get a feeling for the "de facto"
canon. ie the way marines are used by the majority of Traveller gamers.

Obviously, the TML doesn\'t necessarily reflect the majority of traveller
games, but it probably contains some of the most in depth thought about the
traveller universe.

The majority of the replies I have read in the threads spawned by your
initial post seem to be of the view that they are not only BD supertroopers,
but are also damn hard in the role of PBI.

I appreciate the need for a difference in the GT templates for marines and
army, but this can be taken up by such things as Marine Codes of Honour, and
better diplomatic/interpersonal skills in the army (representing more
emphasis on peacekeeping/long-term occupation etc).

Also, I don\'t think you are fully taking into account the deployment and
reinforcement timetable imposed by jumpspace.  You *have* to allow for
disruption to the timetable as I previously outlined.  Or send in such
overwhelming force that you cannot be defeated.  However, such a force may
not be available on hand to deal with a situation, or if it is, what is the
enemy doing elsewhere, and how do you (as in theatre commander, not you
personally) respond to that?

If you just send in the marines, while a follow on force of grunts is
assembled and shipped, you cannot guarantee that the timetable will be met.
Think 18th / 19th century troop deployment, not late 20th.  Yes, the BD
Shocktroopers *will* establish a bridgehead, but they may need to hold it
for weeks before the follow on forces arrive, and they can\'t be suited up
continuously for that long.

It\'s not that he\'s not a Marine, but he\'s been not using the tools with
which he\'s been trained.  In the ongoing comparison of B Marines with
armored vehicle crews, a few people have pointed out that some tankers do
quite well outside their disabled vehicles.  True enough, but they aren\'t
doing what you want them to be doing, which is driving around killing enemy
tanks.

IMO, the Marines are *the* strike force.  On occasion, they\'ve had to fight
unarmored.  This isn\'t what they are trained to do, and it shows.

The template I\'m working on for basic Marine characters includes the
following skills:

Battlesuit/12
Beam Weapons/12
Gunner (Rocket Launcher)/12
Guns/12
Armoury (Battlesuit)/12
Electronic Operation (Sensors)/12
Tactics
Camouflage
Savoir-Faire (Marines)

That\'s just the most basic list.  Getting professional levels in just those
skills could easily eat up 30-40 pts.


>I guess the knife-fighting, jungle-humping marine commando is gone.

That image is an artifact of the 20th Century.  Marines used to be troops
whose job it was to stand in the rigging and snipe at officers on enemy ships.

Anyway, you said the magic word: commando.  Airborne Rangers operate
exactly in the way you describe; knife fighting, sneaky as all hell.  There
are just over 2400 Rangers in the entire US Army.  They are special duty
troops.

The Marines are special troops also.  In 5FW, there are only 8 Marine
Regiments in the entire game, 40 points of combat power (IIRC).  Compare
this the thousands of points of Army troops.  Marines are obviously
something special.

>Whoever is making the BD is getting really wealthy.  If I were the Zhodani,

Who says they don\'t?  One of the biggest Zho thrusts in the 5th War was
towards Rhylanor, perhaps that\'s where the SM\'s biggest BD contractor is
based?

Anyway, as a matter of scale the cost of one Marine Regiment is dwarfed by
the cost of providing an Imperial Army division with tanks, APCs, and the
ships to transport them.  You can store a suit of Battledress in about the
same area as a cold sleep berth IMTU (this includes spare parts, a work
bench, etc.)  Since the Marines carry their fire support with them, they
don\'t need anywhere near as much transportation tonnage.

In the current US Army:

Enlisted men where overseas caps
Officers wear the traditional brimmed cap
Airborne troops wear maroon berets
Rangers wear black berets
Special Forces wear green berets
Drill Sergeants wear campaign hats

and that\'s not to mention that female soldiers have variants on all the
types mentioned above!

If I\'m allowed, I\'m changing the uniform color to dark gray with maroon
highlights.

OK, I hate to sound like I\'m getting pi**ed off, but nowhere have I stated
that Marines are sealed into their armor at the start of Initial training,
only to be released after their tour of duty is up.

Of course they have other uniforms, and they are trained in other weapons.

My point is that a Marine, who by training and experience fights pitched
battles in a suit of Battledress, *might*, I say again *MIGHT*, have the
disadvantage of Combat Paralysis if he is suddenly caught in a firefight
without the protection he\'s used to having.

Now, if your Marine had to fight blackguards storming the Embassy while in
black tie and tails, it\'s not likely that he would have this little
problem.  In fact, if he was into martial arts, or just was a real fun
drunk, he\'d probably be used to fighting unaugmented.  It was just a
suggestion that someone could use to make an interesting character or NPC.

This is one of the reasons the Marines teach fencing, to keep the men alert
and on guard, if you\'ll forgive the pun.

Actually, they\'re based on the US Army\'s Airborne Rangers, a group I have a
passing familiarity with.

OK, but Ground Forces is the sourcebook for the Imperial Military.  Star
Mercs has wonderful templates for former members of the herd.  This book is
for those who want to play active duty folks.

So why play a Marine?  That Marine is going to have been more places, and
have more technical skills that his Army counterpart.  The Marine will have
access to skills that would make him a valued crewman on a small merchant.
He will even have decent levels of military skills.  The ex soldiers will
have seen starships as a passenger, with pissed off Navy crewmembers
telling them to stay in the damn hold and don\'t touch anything!

So the Marine would be a more balanced character for most groups with their
own spaceship.  For a group riding with others, take along the ex-grunt for
better combat power.

When I joined the infantry, I didn\'t think that my job skills would include
maintaining 10 ton armored vehicles and operating a multi channel radio.
If the player wants that kind of character, there is going to be an Army
Jump Infantry template that is much more what you are describing.

<snip>

>So, Doug, in your vision how do we get a Joe instead of a Sam out of

As I\'ve pointed out above, Sam is going to have more ship orientated
skills, and probably been more places (more Area Knowledge and Language
skills).  An old Gunnery Sergeant could legitimately spend a dozen or two
points on AK just of Startowns in the game area!

Joe is going to have more combat skills, but might not be all that
interesting when there isn\'t combat around (unless he was Combat Engineer
or something.)

So Sam is the ship\'s steward (spent some time as the valet for a Marine
Vice Marshal), helps tinker with the engineer (some mechanical and
engineering skills from long deployments), and still provides the kind of
muscle you describe in the text I snipped.

I believe the canonical description has them either speeding up or slowing
down the natural process, for example causing nuclear materials to decay
quickly to harmlessness, or surpressing it long enough for clean up.

They\'ve tried.  Repeatedly.  The problem is that if the don\'t reproduce,
they die.  I got the impression that many, many Crazy Eddies tried to break
the connection between pregancy and survival.

It\'s a basic problem because we don\'t have it.  What\'s the solution to our
basic problem:

We can\'t easily expand through the universe because we need to breathe.  So
the easy question is how do we stop breathing.

You better believe it.

One of the side effects of my illness and chemo was a near total loss of
sexual desire.  You cannot *belive* how sex-drenched this culture is when
your not interested.

The urge to mate is very strong in humans, often over-riding intelligence.
In the Moties it is as vital as eating.

IIRC, and I\'m fairly confident of this, in the US Marines,
you don\'t get out of basic training without qualifying as
a Marksman.

Neither do you in the Army.  In fact, I\'m not aware of any military
organization in the Western world that *doesn\'t* require basic skill with
the service arm.

Now, how often do the members of a Marine Air Wing go out and practise
infantry tactics?  How about Marine tankers?  Do they spend enough time out
of the shell to realistically call themselves skilled infantry?

Infantry is a very difficult discipline, and requires constant traing and
drill to master.

OK, *one* thing you guys are forgetting is that the Moties used genetic 
engineering on themselves and other native species to enhance their 
abilities.  The three arm modification common to most Motie subspecies is the 
major case in point.

Yes, at least I was forgetting that, where did I put that book? ;) The
"Watchmakers" were engineered "Motie-monkeys", right? Was their breed-or-die
syndrome related to the genetic engineering?

How many races in the Imperium have modified themselves? The Vagyr, Dolphins,
etc. don\'t count as they were uplifted by another race. I consider the
Jonkereen(sp?) to be close to what I am talking about, although it is more like
an isolated project. Have any species taken it to the extreme that the Moties
did, where the entire population is altered even on a socio-economic military and
psychological level? Just curious.

Yeah, it was.  I forget the reasoning behind it, though.  But *all* Moties 
are hermaphroditic, which isn\'t a bad lil survival trait...

Humaniti uplifted the dolphins.  And there\'s a not-quite canon reference to 
uplifted jabberwocks on the BARD pages.  I have no knowledge of genetic 
engineering on an entire population level that I\'m allowed to talk about; 
some of my PBEM players read this list!  <grin>

From (my less than perfect) memory, I would have agreed... I thought that
standard Marine gear was the Combat Environment Suit plus gauss rifle, with
the occasional support-weapon (FGMP) wielder in battle dress.

Certainly, the Assault groups are full battle dress - in fact, they use
Assault Battle Dress, the AF 22 one with knee greaves and the
skimpy-looking Cloth skirt (if you are brave, insert wolf-whistle here).
These guys would certainly be candidates for Combat Paralysis. [Hey, they
may even have some sort of cross-dressing quirk... <smack!> OK, I\'ll be
good! <whimper>]

Even so, at firebases in "undress" they still need to know what to do when
it "drops in the pot" and they don\'t have the required 10 mins to "dress".
(Or do they "don" their armour - y\'know, like in all those news reports
about firemen, when they "don breathing apparatus" ;-).

Well, I remember that a little while ago there was a raging flamewar on just
this topic. I\'d really rather not get into it. I used it as an example to
point out the use of "instructional" excessive force is not unknown to the
world.

If somebody wants to use a "template" from history for his Marines, that\'s
cool, but I personally just can\'t see it that way.

I think that we aren\'t on the same page here with the concept of powered
armor. I don\'t know if there\'s a way to rectify this. Using the suit is not
simply climbing in behind the wheel and driving around.

Well, I\'m not going to argue with Book 4. I will say that, despite the fact
I like the concept of a random character generation system that creates a
life history, it does have its failing. It was possible, for example, to
come out with a character who had little or no "useful" skills at all. A
free trader crewman who had bow combat, admin and groundcar skills, for
example. ;)

I\'m being harsh toward the system, as that was something that turned most of
the people I knew off to Traveller. I find it endearing and interesting to a
large extent, but it also has some serious flaws. There were many times that
people went into the system expecting Han Solo who came out with a
distinctly unromantic character.

Yes. And there will be Imperial Marines who will be able to match up pound
for pound and ounce for ounce with infantry soldiers. I honestly think that
you\'re missing the point here. I also think that you\'re guilty of what you
accuse me of, you\'re selling the infantryman short. After all, if every tank
crew is actually comparable to soldiers from hardcore kickass infantry
units, why bother spending money and time on training infantry to be
infantry?

Besides, you\'re stacking the deck in your favor again. ;)

You\'re talking about a survival course. I\'m not denying that tank crews and
pilots are trained for survival. The government spent alot of money on their
specialized training, and any experience they\'ve had on the battlefield is
invaluable, even if it was the kind of experience that got their tank
disabled. You want people like this to survive, get back to base, and hop
into another vehicle to perform the job they\'ve been trained to do.

It

argument


The line of thought I see from you is that training and experience don\'t
factor in at all. Any guy with a gun is magically as well trained and has
the same skills and experiences that an infantry soldier has... which is
selling the infantry soldier short.

I am not saying that tankers are completely unskilled when not in their
vehicles. I am saying that the bulk of their specialized training is utterly
worthless if they don\'t have a big metal beast to ride in. Their talents,
skills and abilities go to waste if they are not in a tank. I don\'t think
that this is at all unrealistic.

>It sounds to me that IM\'s cannot fight at all?  No real basic infantry-like
>training?  They don\'t have to be skilled at unarmed combat and only lightly

Not at all. I think, though, that there\'s something that hasn\'t been
communicated yet, and this discussion hinges on it:

This debate arose because Doug said he was going to put disadvantage into
his Imperial marine templates for a GURPS book. This does not mean that
every single Imperial marine will actually have this disadvantage, nor does
it mean that every single Imperial marine without this disadvantage is a
candy-ass without his suit. What it means is that there will be a template,
a group of skills, advantages and disadvantages. Some will be required,
others won\'t be. In the case of disadvantages, the template will say
something like "100 points in the following disadvantages." There will be a
couple hundred points worth of disadvantages, including the one that makes a
marine a candy-ass without his powered armor. A marine character will not
have to take this disadvantage. It\'s just one of many possible
disadvantages. In addition, the disadvantage itself is not crippling all of
the time. It is possible for a character with this disadvantage to fight.
Sometimes, however, the Imperial marine will freeze up when the adrenaline
dies down and he realizes that he\'s in a hot LZ without his lobster suit.
That\'s what the disadvantage means.

No. That\'s not what I\'m saying at all. You\'re taking what I\'m saying to the
extreme. This might be my fault, or you just might be being difficult ;)

The vehicle they\'re in does many, many things for them, but they\'re not
unskilled. In order to use it properly, they have to be fast, they have to
have good judgement, and they have to be trained heavily in *battle dress*
small unit tactics. They have to be able to read the coded information on
their HUDs and know what those mean while firing their fusion gun at an
enemy entrenchment and keeping a lock for their shoulder-mounted missile
launcher on that converted mining drone with the heavy drilling laser that
floated over the nearby ridge just
a second and a half ago.

They aren\'t unskilled, it\'s just that their training, their skills and their
experiences do not happen to be those of your basic grunt.


Can they fight outside of armor? Sure. I\'m not disagreeing with this, and it
would appear that Doug isn\'t disagreeing with this either.

Battle dress tactics will be different than infantry tactics. Battle dress
skills will be different than infantry skills. Battle dress, at least as far
as I\'ve seen, is not simply a suit of armor. It is a complicated
technological wonder, the absolute greatest force multiplier a single person
can pilot.

Oh... I must have missed that part in the modern world where pilots and
tankers prove themselves in combat before being allowed to handle their
vehicles ;)

This creates a rather interesting problem both in GURPS and in reality.
There are only so many hours in a day to train. There is only so much a
single person can retain. If you\'ll pardon me for saying so, what you\'re
proposing sounds to me like something out of a comic book.

>I wouldn\'t give a soldier a suit if he didn\'t know everything else.

Everything? Does that include classical Vilani literature? ;)

Seriously though, where does the line get drawn? For example, every infantry
soldier learns some first aid. Is every infantry soldier as good as a combat
medic? I mean, I don\'t want to give a rifle, a helmet and a flak vest to
somebody unless they know *everything*.

How about a pilot? Does a pilot have to be a field medic, a commando, and a
computer repairman before he gets his hands on a plane? The Imperium is
going to have to draw the line somewhere.

I apologize if I say, again, this sounds a bit unrealistic. You\'re expecting
Imperial marines to be Rambo. I disagree strongly with this. I\'m not saying
that they shouldn\'t be tough. I\'m just saying that their skin isn\'t
bulletproof.

Do you honestly think that any single human being without a suit of powered
armor is equal to with a suit of powered armor? I am really baffled here. If
the combat zone is hot enough to kill a battle dress piloting marine, the
marine has very little chance of surviving no matter how many skills or how
much experience he has.

It seems to me that you expect superheroic levels of ability from human
beings. To assume that a single man with a sidearm or rifle would be able to
survive and *win* a combat that took out his battle dress is, well, not
particularly realistic.

Now you\'re just being argumentative. The Imperial army guys who use battle
dress will be just as specialized as Imperial marines.

If marines are required on the battlefield an unarmored man will have little
chance of surviving no matter how many skills he has. Period. There is no
changing this, at least not realistically. Plasma guns, fusion guns and
their splashes, radiation and blasts from meson sleds... There are *no*
"real fighting men" on a battlefield like that. There are no guys with
sidearms and Imperial issue coveralls that will have the slightest chance of
turning the tide of battle.

I didn\'t think that you were having a go at me personally. It\'s okay.

<shrug> You\'re overstating and / or misunderstanding the comments and claims
I made. I can\'t help that. I never said that Imperial marines are helpless
as babies without their suits. I did say that they are not on par with an
infantry soldier in the same situation. I did say that the skill set of an
Imperial marine is entirely different than that of an infantry soldier.

Did I mention that your site and Adam Getchell\'s (The guy who started the
FTL == Time Travel thread) campaign, http://hapkido.ucdavis.edu/traveller/
were two of the things that made me disgusted at how SOFT SF my campaign
world was, and started me on this absolute gearhead "Scout" mind set. _I_

"Every Marine a Rifleman." They really do live it, too. Every Marine, from
Recruit Private to the Commandant himself, qualifies with the rifle every
year -- no other service that I know of can make that claim; the Army
certainly can\'t. If they expect to stay in the Marines, they\'ll do a damn
sight better than simply qualify, too.

Every Marine aviator does a tour as an infantry platoon leader *before*
he\'s allowed to go to flight school, so that he never forgets his mission:
support to the infantry. They also spend a huge fraction of their careers
in ANGLICOs and other direct support positions, humping along with the
infantry.

Marine tankers do the complete infantry course, then go to Fort Knox to
learn the tank part from the Army; same story for the artillerymen. The
ones I know are only passing good tankers, because they spend so much time
worrying about the infantry they support. When there are *at most* four
tanks in a battalion landing team (by far the most common MAGTF), this
makes a certain amount of sense -- they don\'t really engage in mounted
warfare per se all that often, and they don\'t have the depth of experience
available to an Army armored unit.

I have a tremendous amount of professional respect for the USMC and their
brethren of other nationalities (I\'ve served with Dutch and Norwegian
Marines as well). The Army would do well to adopt much of what they teach,
starting with the notion that it should be *hard* to graduate basic and a
matter of pride to call yourself a Marine.

US Army Rangers are a very poor model for what the Imperial Marines are
asked to do: they are far too specialized, though they are wonderfully good
at what they do. Use them instead for the Sylean Rangers, Imperial Marine
Commandos, and other special purpose forces. Whatever their qualifications,
Imperial Marines are a general purpose force; in fact, they are all too
often the *only* force available for whatever crisis is at hand.

P.S. I cannot recommend too highly _Warfighting_ (Lt. Col. H.T. Hayden,
ed), which is a reprint of the USMC\'s FMFM 1 Warfighting, FMFM 1-1
Campaigning, and FMFM 1-3 Tactics, all in one volume. I make all my
lieutenants read FMFM 1-3 for professional development, because it is the
single best description of what we are trying to achieve in training, and
it addresses all arms -- infantry, aviation, support -- rather than just
the combat types.

Tom Clancy\'s _Marine_ also has a pretty fair laundry list of all the
missions a MAGTF is expected to undertake.

What\'s useless about bow combat and groundcar skills for a free trader 
crewman?  If you\'re constantly bouncing about on low tech planets, ground 
cars are usually readily availiable, as are bows.  And admin helps you cut 
through the paperwork to get offplanet faster.  The big cash scores are gonna 
be *away* from more \'civilised\' worlds.

I\'m especially intrigued by that last part: the big cash scores are going to
be *away* from more \'civilized\' worlds. How do you mean exactly?

Admin isn\'t useless for a trader. I know. However, there were times that
this was the only useful skill I ever rolled for a character. I consider bow
combat useless as I have yet to actual see a bow used in a Traveller
campaign. Ground car is marginally useful at best.

Am I to believe that free traders squeeze these guys with useless skills on
their ships just in case they ever need someone to use a bow or drive a car
with wheels? The classic Traveller system was a system that was light on
starting skill points anyway, and it was a little while before they even
introduced a method to learn new skills or improve old ones.

>The system makes *useable* characters.  That was its purpose.


Who wants a character that\'s usable if it\'s not much fun to use?

    Major, what Army are you in?  I may have only been lowly Specialist
(E-4, one rank below Sergeant E-5), and I was just generator mechanic, but I
know that I qualified every six months with my M16. Plus once a week for at
least four hours one day during the time called Sergeant\'s Time we trained
on the basics combat and survival skills. Keep in mind, as a mechanic my job
was to keep our generators up and running.
    I do know that as much as I trained in the basics combat skills, the
Marines must do it twice as much.  To use an old term, They are Hard Core.
You have to look at the big picture, what happens when that aircraft get
shot out from underneath them or there tank gets hit in the tracks.  They
are on foot and become Infantry.  So they have to know what to do or they
will be someone else\'s burden and that will just get more troops killed or
wounded.
    Even I, as a mechanic, I knew how to shoot, to read a map, to move under
fire, what grenade is best for what job and how to drop another human at 300
meters with my M16. I could set claymores and fire light anti-tank weapons
too.  The training even goes the other way also, I trained to drive, load
and fire a M-1 Abrams  while I was with Support Battalion that supported two
Armored Cavalry Brigades and a Mechanized Infantry.  The Infantry had
Bradlys, but you could not pay me enough to get in those in combat.
    While I was with a Combat Engineering Battalion I was trained in the use
of high explosives.  If I had some C-4 and Det-cord I could  take out a
bridge or blow out other things to hamper the enemy.
    I was even in two different Combat Aviation Brigade while stationed at
Ft. Hood, Texas. One flew Cobras and the other Apaches.  And there I trained
just as hard in two outings to the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort
Irwin, California in the basics of land and air tactics.

    So you could say that in a short amount of time a trooper could have the
opportunities  to learn a lot of combat oriented skills, and some could be
enough to be called "skilled" in the other areas out side of there assigned
duties.

Because the megacorps are going to be trying to corner the markets on the 
civilised worlds.  I\'m not saying *every* jerkwater planet\'s gonna make you a 
killing, just that it\'s more likely that an independent will do better on one 
than trying to cut out a megacorp on a high pop TL15 planet.  They just won\'t 
have the resources to compete.

Fun is what you make of it.  Do you *REALLY* wanna play a character who\'s so 
over the top that *nothing* is a challange for him?  Not me.

The only race that I can think of that modified itself is Humaniti,

Different campaign styles probably.  I have seen bow\'s used a time
or two, but you are right it\'s not what I\'d call a very *useful*
skill.  ;-) BTW, I looked at my copy of B1 just now and didn\'t see a
Bow skill in the Merchant\'s career.  I know it showed up eventually,
but Bow skill wasn\'t in my B1 at all.

OTOH, ground car is an *extremely* useful skill when ground
transportation is the norm on a planet and grav vehicle is the norm
for the TL of the group in general.  Famous last words, "Hey, I can
drive an air-raft, of course I can drive that truck!"

Oh, I agree with you on that.  CT *was* a little light on skills,
and lighter on skill improvement.  There are howevers to both of
those objections, though.

In CT the PC could attempt any "task" with or without a skill in
that area, there were some hefty -DM\'s for no expertise in some
cases.  So, the PC wasn\'t *quite* as limited as his character sheet
might seem to indcate.

In character generation you only got 1 or 2 skills every 4 years.
Given that you shouldn\'t expect characters to advance very fast in
game play.  That\'s why I don\'t think CT considered skill improvement
to be especially important.  If a campaign continued for 3, 4, 5
years the Ref (to use CT terminology) could just pick, or tell the
player to pick a skill to go up a point. ;->

>>The system makes *useable* characters.  That was its purpose.

>Who wants a character that\'s usable if it\'s not much fun to use?

Um, well, we could always counter with how much fun the character is
depends more on how you play them than what is on their character
sheet. ;-J  You do have a point, though.

I don\'t much care for point based chargen, that\'s my biggest
problem with GURPS. 

Personally, I think a mix of random selection, career packages, and
a little free-choice gives the most "interesting" characters.

Something like...

Pre-Career
    Randomly select Attributes

    Choose a small set of background skills from lists that vary
    based on the PC\'s Social Class and homeworld factors (TL, Hydro,
    Atmos, etc)

Career
    First Career:  Receive a small set of Career/Occupation Skills
    corresponding to "Basic/Advanced Training"
    
    Succeeding Careers:  Receive a potentially smaller set of skills
                        (if you already have that skill you don\'t
                        get an inprovement)
    
    Each 2 year term
        Randomly select:  1 skill from Career Occupation table
                          1 skill from Career Life table
                          1 skill from Career Mission table
                          
        Freely choose 1 skill as a hobby/interest (with GM approval)
        
        On Commission receive a small set of Officer skills
        
        On promotion 1 skill at random from one of the tables (BTW,
                    I\'ve never quite understood why you get a skill
                    when you are promoted.  It seems to me you\'d get
                    a promotion when you reach certain milestones,
                    seniority or skill levels.)

What does this remind you of, CT Advanced? ;->

Fair enough, not too far from my own idea of trade. Generally, in my
developed areas, tramps carry the stuff the megacorps don\'t want to carry.
In other words, the kind of stuff that makes for good adventures and
scenarios.

Before: "What\'s that? You need to get an adult Narinvan Mantis from Cameron
to Wendell? Sure, we can do that!"

After: "That jerk never told us that its diamond-hard teeth could rend
through the standard transport cage. <sigh> Oh well, hopefully I can find
another engineer at Wendell Down."

Usually in the more developed areas of the Imperium. That\'s what my players
seem to like best.

You\'re right. Fun is what you make of it.

However, there *is* a wide gulf of difference between allowing the players
to play the sorts of characters they want to play (with the sorts of skills
they want) and characters that are so over the top that *nothing* is a
challenge for them!

Fortunately, I\'ve been blessed with a non-munchkin gaming group. Apparently,
other folks have problems with this sort of player, and fortunately, I\'ve
never had to worry about this.

For the record, we used the T4 rules the last time I ran a campaign, and we
combined the two methods of character creation. T4 gives one skill per year
and there are 4 years per term. The tables are set up so 1D decides the
skill category and 1D decides the skill. Year 1: Roll for each. Year 2: Roll
for category, pick skill. Year 3: Pick category, roll for skill. Year 4:
Pick category and pick skill.

I *like* random character generation systems. I\'m a diehard for them. I just
never got along well with the CT / "Advanced" CT / MT systems. For some
reason, T4 seemed to work very well, but it might have been the
"combination" method that I came up with.

 The theory is that the "easy" money to be had on the hi-pop, hi-tech
worlds is already being made by someone else.

 Not quite. CT skill scales were such that most skills could earn you a good
living at just Skill-1, and only one such skill was necessary. The rest could
afford to be extras, hobbies, or "color."  Given a character with Admin,
Wheled Vehicle, and Archery, I would provide a Captain/Owner who
doesn\'t like robots for his cargo handling. Instant need for a Supercargo
who can drive a forklift. Admin and Wheeled Vehicle ARE the character\'s
reason for being onboard.
 With CT and MT, your determined skill set isn\'t _everything_ you can do,
it\'s what you do WELL.

 Turn the Archery into an excuse to be on certain worlds at certain times, for
Grark hunting season, a big archery tourney, or a showing of an
archeological site with ancient (or Ancient) archers.

  Half the fun is getting into situations you aren\'t suited for. Two 
characters
come to mind immediately: Hobart Floyt and Arthur Dent. Hobart is a
Librarian, and Arthur\'s sole useful skill turnes out to be sandwich-making.
Both lead very interesting lives that are very interesting to read about...

Bow combat: I was being a little extreme in my example, although I vividly
remember getting several characters with one largely useless skill, two
useless skills. I know, bow combat didn\'t come along for a little while. I
was hoping nobody would catch my error ;)

Different Campaign styles: I\'m sure it is. The games I run tend to be very
urbanized, for example. I also am partial to the region where the Daibei
sector and the Solomani Rim meets. That\'s not exactly a frontier region.

True enough. That might be fine on the frontier, or even somewhere that is
simply "off the beaten trade routes"... However, a character generation
system should be capable of generating characters that can be used in any
Imperial-type setting, even if it isn\'t the Spinward Marches or another
frontier.

Well... Okay. You got me. I *have* gotten some characters that are nearly
that bad. As an example: under vanilla CT character generation merchant
characters aren\'t guaranteed a single starship related skill until they
reach 1st Officer.

True enough. Also, it was a system that was created while RPGs were in their
infancy. Wasn\'t it one of the first systems to use the concept of skills at
all? Can\'t blame GDW if it was rough around the edges ;)

Yep. Then again, game design was a young art.

I will agree, but only in theory. I enjoy taking on challenges when I play
games other GMs are running. I\'ll frequently take skills or characters that
have little practical value. Most of my friends who are GMs run combat heavy
games and I never really take combat heavy characters. I always have fun
playing, and people tend to remember the characters I play.

However, I\'ve found that the quickest way to driving off players is to force
your own gaming aesthetic on them... whether it\'s by not being responsive to
the type of campaign they want to play or not realizing that some people
don\'t *like* playing the cabin boy who provides comic relief until there\'s a
bow to be fired or a ground car to be driven ;)

<in best Road Warrior aussie accent: "I\'ll drive that tanker!">

>I don\'t much care for point based chargen, that\'s my biggest
>problem with GURPS.


I have my issues with point based character generation. However, I\'ve
managed to come to terms with GURPS, to some extent. One of the problems
with random character generation is the potential of a severe imbalance
within the party. The people I play with are hardened RPG veterans who like
playing quirky and entertaining characters, so I don\'t have to worry about
them looking for ways to get serious advantages in point based character
generation. However, as a rule, they don\'t like to play characters that are
too far from what they want to play.

>Personally, I think a mix of random selection, career packages, and

I completely agree. Fortunately, so do my players.

IMTU, there aren\'t a whole lotta tramps flying in the developed areas, at 
least, not before the Rebellion anyways.  Now, they\'re starting to come back, 
flying interface between the Wilds and the Safes, places where the corporados 
don\'t *even* wanna be flying.

Personally, I like running around on the fringes.  Dunno why, but it *seems*

For me, the challange is to roll something up and *play* it as it falls.

Here\'s the guy I play in Roger Barr\'s \'Lucky Credit\' PBEM:

Romli Issak Elvis Hamlin, ex-Sharurshid employee, 5 terms, 38 yrs old.

UPP (Original):  78A987  UPP (Final): 78ABB7    Cr:  110 KCr

Skills:
Engineering-3                     Handgun-4
Dagger-1                          Vacc Suit-1
Commo-1                           Admin-1
Computer-1                        Leader-1
Sh Tactics-1                      Trader-2
Liason-1                          Broker-3
Pilot-1                           Legal-1

He did 4 years in the regional Sharurshid \'baby brass school\', then 16 years 
bouncing in and out of the company and a couple of its subsidiaries.  He got 
stuck having to take the O-3 exam twice due to department & corporate 
bouncing around.  Finally, he\'d had enough and told them to shove it.  He 
finally got a berth onboard a tramp freighter, the \'Lucky Credit\', as 3rd 
Officer/Chief Engineer/Lead Broker.

Hamlin\'s straight outta \'Merchant Prince\', and I was happy with how he ended 
up.  We worked the Handgun-4 into his bio as him being on the corporate 
Shooting Team that was trendy in the Deneb area for about 5, 10 years (copped 
a gun & a couple more Gun Cbts as material bennies).  And he has serious 
problems adjusting his thinking from 20 years of \'right way, wrong way, 
Sharurshid way\', even though no corporation will bother talking to him about 
a job due to Sharurshid\'s blackballing him when he quit.

All in all, a fun guy to hang with.  And a guy who\'s looking to skipper his 
own boat someday.

A guy with Wheeld Vehicle-1 & Admin-1 would be picked up by a tramp skipper 
to handle his cargo *AND* buy/sell it on pick up & drop off points.  The DM 
\'spread\' on Admin-1 is 2, i.e., DM -1 on all buying rolls on the T&S price 
table, +1 on all selling rolls on the same table.

FWIW, I *don\'t* like the abstract trade spec system that debutted in Merchant 
Prince.  Under the original T&S rules, I could usually take a 20-100KCr stake 
and start up a full blown merchant company within 5 game years.  <grin>

LOL!  I was all prepared to pounce on you.  I caught it, but thought I\'d
be nice.  I figured you had meant to say Blade CBT instead, and was
waiting for you to dig your way out of saying that a character with
Blade-1,  Admin-1, and Ground Vehicle-1 was useless.  But then
you went and dug the hole deeper.  ;-)

Right.  (assuming Edu<8) They can only get:
Blade CBT, Bribery, Gun CBT, Streetwise, Medical or +1 Str, Dex, or End.
Those are useless for a merchant on a starship.

Only 8 of the 18 available rolls are \'directly starship-related related skills:
0/6 on the Personal Development Table (no suprise)
4/6 on the Service Skills table
4/6 Advanced Education Table (not the Edu 8+ one)

Thought just occured to me:

Limiting max skill level by appropriate attribute.
Half the Attribute.
Dex 6 limits Rifle to max of 3
Edu 8 limits Physics to max of 4

Thoughts?

Sort of like Merchant Prince chargen?
In a min-maxing sense, IMO, there should be some reward for promotion,
either something gained directly (like a skill), or something that the rank
enables (muster out bonuses, special skill tables, special schools, etc.).
Else, why does it matter in chargen?  Else why is it desirable to the player
(as opposed to the character)?  I have virtually no interest in creating a
character that I want to play in GT with _any_ level of former rank,
whatsoever.  I can spend that point somewhere else.  But I would really
like to get 5 skills every year instead of just 4.

        Its a missile with an alblative sand in it...  the missile is fired
"up threat" towards probable origins of laser or missile fire.  The missile/
canister sails out, explodes and creates a "slick" or "plume" of material
between the ship and the threat.  The sand has a vector...  which means that
if the ship does anything but station keeping, it leaves the plume behind
and will have to disperse more sand next round.
        Incoming energy weapons fire is absorbed by the sand.  Missiles can
be damaged when passing through the cloud or proximity fuses triggered by
the cloud.

This is where I have made my biggest mistake, looking at the Traveller
Universe from a CT slant and past real history.  BD it seems is going to go
from a highly prised, rare skill to a shoved down every marine player\'s
throat in GT.

I shall try and think of it in GT terms from now on (a system of traveller I
don\'t care to play, but that is actually beside the point).  I don\'t even
know if GT has a generation system that includes details such as Raid,
Counter Insurgency, Police Actions, etc., but don\'t imagine there will be
all of them as some of these assignments sound out of the area of IM
operations in GT as they require extended periods on the ground in army-like
operations.

Sorry for the confusion, CT/GURPS, you know how it is :^)

Well, as I now see it Matt, GURPS is comic book heavy on things like BD, and
in a sense, it is "de facto canon."  If there is still a T-5 system in
production, then surely it must be what you would call "Traveller canon," as
I assume (and again I may be wrong) it is based on the established Traveller
history the older Traveller players started off with.

Therefore, in GT, you have every IM in BD with micronukes, while in CT, IM\'s
have to work to earn their BD-skill, let alone a suit of BD.  This suits me
fine if that\'s the way it is meant to be.  GT IM\'s = vehicle (suit) crew
(suiters perhaps?), while CT IM\'s = multi-role, ground fighting forces.

I step aside from this argument now (if I don\'t have to answer further on
it).  I do not play GT so the minority may have this rule their way (GT
player\'s will have to carry on the debate alone as I am not qualified to
argue against GT rules) from where I stand.

Not arguing here, just further curiosity about GT rules.  Do, or will, all
military personnel be lumbered with this CP disadvantage?  I mean, the oft
mentioned tankers and pilots who lose their particular vehicle?  Artillery
crew and navy (wet and space) when they lose their specialty equipment?

And their heroic reistance to the last will become legends to inspire
the generations to come.

However, I think Doug was expecting that normal service for the IM
involved winning battles more often than being wiped out.

If the situation needs Imperial action now and it has to be the marines
from the navy and not the contact group from the scouts, then it seems
to follow that 100 marines in body armour and a gauss rifle cannot secure
a planet.

If they cannot win using battledress and the navy high guard, then, when
these facilities are removed, I think they\'ve lost the battle.

I am in an Army where all aircrews and virtually all officers above the
rank of lieutenant qualify with the pistol, not the rifle. (Tankers used to
carry pistols and M3 submachineguns, but with the advent of the M4 carbine
this is less necessary.) Pistols are (out the hands of specialists like
SFOD-Delta) designed for self-defense, not combat. *Every single Marine*
qualifies with the rifle, every year; officers who carry pistols qualify
with them in addition, not in lieu.

I have fought this trend my entire career; I carried both a pistol and an
M4 on every mission in Somalia, despite the weight of ammunition and the
incredibly cramped size of a Cobra cockpit.

Excel 97 has a date function that says Jan 9 4531 is a Tuesday. That is 
theoretically the benchmark date.

BUT, is it a Tuesday?

Does the Excel 97 function recognize Feb 29 4000 as a valid date? The 
Traveller Solomani calendar (perhaps at odds with the current concept of the 
Solomani calendar) says that every 4th year is a leap year, but the 00 years 
are not, but every 400th year is (ie, 1600, 2000, 2400). That makes 4000 a 
leap year. The Traveller universe makes the further adjustment that years 
divisible by 4000 are not leap years.

If the excel function recognizes Feb 29 4000 as a valid date, then Jan 9 4531 
isn\'t a Tuesday. What should it be?

Lets look at the Marines. From the 5FFW counter mix it can be seen that
even for a frontier sector on the verge of war they are fairly thin on the
ground, so I think it can be safely assumed they are an elite force. So the
question is, just what is their role? Well most people seem to agree that
they are the Imperium\'s rapid reaction force. Now, just what are they
reacting too? Well there\'s the obvious Zhodani Consular Guard storming
across the frontier (suit up and hold the line till the Army arrives). Then
theres "assisting the civil powers". I think this role would be the most
common Marine role by a long chalk. So just what does this entail? Well
sometimes it will mean suiting up and going out to kick insurgent (or any
body elses) butt.

However, I think far more frequent would be "preemtive" intervention. This
is where the situation has not moved to a full on combat situation, but
you\'ve got riots, strikes, civil disobediance etc. here the Imperial Marine
in battledress with their FGMP-14 (or 12a) is not the best option, firing
over a milling crowd\'s heads with fusion guns is *not* a smart idea, nor is
trying to subdue a rioter with BD enhanced superstrength. Here you want
most of your Marines in Combat Environment Suits and carrying Gauss
Rifles (plenty menacing for the run of the mill) with a few in full kit hidden
out of sight in case things turn ugly.

I see the Marines a a highly skilled flexible response force. Sure if the
lead (or plasma) starts flying, they will adopt the philosophy of "Don\'t tap
it, thump it". But for the majority of their missions, this will not be the
required response and the Marines are going to have to be able to deal
with a wide range of situations. As I see it the difference between the
Army and the Marines is that when the Army goes in, its a shooting war.
Whereas the Marines are used mostly to prevent the Army being needed,
with a side order of rapid application of maximum firepower if required.
However the prime role of the Marines is to avoid the need to apply that
firepower.

I believe the beauty of a good role player is using what one gets with
random roles.  But then again, I never accepted players in my game that
required the best stats and skills (and the only walk-outs I had was when we
switched to MT!  Weird huh?  The rules changes were to confusing for them??)

I was an assault troop (QMI -- Mounted Infantry -- a grunt with transport)
and our vehicle (APC) crew were armour, there was the distinction between
the two.  They too had to train as infantry.  They were not trained to lose
their vehicle in combat, but if it happened, they were trained to help us
grunts defeat the enemy we faced and return to take control of another
vehicle later.  I believe Australian arnour crews have to spend a period of
time each year on the ground as grunts also.  Go figure?

Well, that\'s because you see BD as a be all and end all of IM equipment, it
is equated as a vehicle, where I see it as just another piece of ground
troop equipment.  You are saying IM\'s are dedicated to wearing BD in combat,
that IS their specialty where I say it is just a piece of equipment they are
skilled in using, like not every marine may be skilled in FO or even the use
of a VRF-GG, not every marine is skilled in the use of BD.  I see them as a
troopie, not a pilot or turrethead :^)

That means that my APC crews couldn\'t learn that infantry stuff they did
along with specialised vehicle training and tactics?  Like I said, I don\'t
read comics.  It\'s sad that there don\'t seem to be military vehicle crews on
this list, I\'d like to know if the US or British vehicle crews are as
incapable of learning multi-skills as suggested?

My, my... Now who is taking thisng to extremes?  We were talking about
combat situations with the smells of burnt bodies, blood, cordite (or

you know, the general battlefield canvas.

With this anology, where the answer is no, we are saying that an IM cannot
service his own suit and do reloads, because typically, this is outside the
realms of a pilot\'s job discription.  So if you wish to go that way, that
does seem to limit our marine somewhat as he is as highly skilled in the use
of his suit as a pilot is in his aircraft and have been equated to each
other all through this thread.

You seem to assume that there will only be one type of enemy encountered,
those armed with weapons to take out a BD-equipped trooper.  I assumed that
our marines would also assault strongpoints where the heavy weapons would be
capable of taking down armour support and BD-equipped marines.  You are now
saying that if the marine has his suit disabled and has to leave it behind,
he is also no match for the supporting enemy troops with ACR\'s and cloth
armour.  I\'d mention that historically, when a piece of armour was
neutralised, those firing upon said armour would usually change target to
another functioning piece of armour, leaving the crew and supporting ground
troops to their own supporting ground troops to neutralise, but you told me
before that using real life/historical examples was
incorrect/unfair/unrealistic(?), so I guess I\'ll assume that the gunners
neutralising the BD\'s will continue to fire upon the man inside the suit
after the suit itself is destroyed and ignore the other functioning BD\'s
attacking...

No, bugger it, I will mention that historically, when a piece of armour was
neutralised, those firing upon said armour would usually change target to
another functioning piece of armour, leaving the crew and supporting ground
troops to their own supporting ground troops to neutralise.  I would assume
that on most battlefields, that when a man is forced to abandon his
"armour," he is not written off altogether, that he can still contribute to
the fight as per your "If the combat zone is hot enough to kill a battle
dress piloting marine, the marine has very little chance of surviving no
matter how many skills or how much experience he has" statement... Sorry,
history always gets in my way like that.

Well, the point is, if the army has that equipment (BD\'s) available to them,
why bother fielding the marines in the first place?   Field the army units
and if some should lose their suits, they are skilled enough to go to ground
and still do some damage as they are multi-roled where the marines are not?
They can diddly bop off to a flank and take out one or two of the enemy
support crews where possible, perhaps damage some of the enemies equipment
before going to ground again (or getting micronuked like snipers do?).

Thanks, and believe it or not, that still stands... I am just defending my
statements as I still don\'t see logic with the proposed "all marines in BD"
rule.  However, being a GURPS thing, they can have whatever rules they like
as I don\'t play GT (I guess I\'m a CT loyalist).

Perhaps.  I don\'t see these guys as traditional marines if forced to be
BD-bound.  I always saw marines as a multi-role capable force, in and out of
suits, not a vehicular-bound force like turretheads and pilots... they are
just not the same...

This sounds to me like politically-correct historical revisionism...
The politically-correct of today are so horrified by the idea of the
use of atomic weapons that they gloss over the reasons for their use
in 1945: there was a war on. I am appalled by the peaceniks who every 
August 8 stage a protest shouting "No more Hiroshimas" -- I\'ll agree 
to that so long as they agree to the idea of "No more Pearl Harbors".
(The ironic part of all this: I\'m a Canadian.)


In an effort to avoid another flamewar, an ObTrav:

The Imperium has been around for over 1100 years in the "present" of 
most Traveller campaigns. What kind of "historical revisionism" is there
in the year 1120 about past events? The Solomani Rim War and some of the
early pacification campaigns are probably good starting points... 

eg, What does a schoolchild in the Imperium learn about the Solomani
Rim War, and how does it differ from what a schoolchild in the Solomani
Confederacy learns?

Wasn\'t a high enough level of Vac Suit skill (2? 3?) originally considered
sufficient for using battle dress? That would be along the lines that
"Vac Suit" was a generic skill with protective gear, and that Battle Dress
is an armored form of an advanced hostile environment suit - Battle Dress
skill would be the result of an advanced and specialized training course
focused on the capabilities of BD. 

Thus a crack Vac Suit user might be good with HUD\'s, backup systems, 
user-friendly sensors and even Exoskeleton-assists, but wouldn\'t be very adept with things like HUD-linked targeting computers or BD repair.
A character with Battle Dress skill - a much rarer animal - would have
most or all of the Vac Suit skill knowledge, would know how to maintain
BD, might know some unusual tricks for getting more out of BD, and
might even know useful things about wrecking other people\'s BD.

Of course, a skill with the FGMP\'s would probably cover the targeting computer for the Vac Suit guy. 

I may have Vac Suit as BD skill confused in my memory - my CT books
are not at the desk I\'m working from now.

Marines, from my view, are going to be the troops of choice for almost 
*every* short-term mission. Every major (and most minor) Imperial Navy 
vessel and installation has some on hand, they\'re usually the closest 
manpower to be had. Very, very few of these short-term missions will be 
of the "drop from orbit and storm the citadel" variety...I would even say
that in many of these missions, if a Marine even has to fire a weapon then 
something has gone very wrong. Remember, the Imperial Marines spend
most of their time working inside the Imperium, on security and internal
policing duties - a major interstellar war only comes along once a
generation or so.

I see BD-specialist marines as elite troops, while it seems Doug\'s
design has the average line marine being a BD trooper. I believe my
take is closer to CT canon, though I may be wrong. I\'m almost certain
Doug\'s take is GT canon - after all, he\'s the one writing this part 
of it. :-) 

FWIW, I think Doug\'s idea for a Combat Paralysis disad for elite
BD-jockeys is an excellent one. It was when he described Marines
as never seeing a fight outside their armor that he went too far for my
taste. His telling of Marine veterans who had never smelled the smoke
of a battlefield may have been some playful hyperbole, of course.

Not sure if you still want this, as I am some what behind on the TML...

I joined the US Navy in 81, right out of high school. At that time the US
economy was not great, and I was in trouble with the law.  As a bargaining
chip with the judge I expressed an interest in the military.  With that much
thinking I walked to the recruiting office and joined.

It was the best thing I could have done.  I loved bootcamp, finally had some
discipline in my life, and felt part of something.  I was part of the task
force in Grenada, Beirut, and the Gulf, working on the flight deck of the
USS Independence on F-14\'s. (Avionics, troubleshooting)

After I got out in 85, still wanted to be part of the military, and needed
the cash to help pay for school, so I joined the Marines.

They agreed to pay for school.

Got sent to the Gulf War, and fought in 4 battles - at the first line,
outside the oil fields, farm house, and airport.

After the war, I could see the writing on the wall, the old USSR was gone,
Clinton was in office, and the military was downsizing.  I decided to move
on.

Not sure if that\'s what you wanted, or if that helps...

They\'ve tried.  Repeatedly.  The problem is that if the don\'t 
reproduce, they die.  I got the impression that many, many 
Crazy Eddies tried to break the connection between pregancy and 
survival.

It\'s a basic problem because we don\'t have it.  What\'s the 
solution to our basic problem:

We can\'t easily expand through the universe because we need to 
breathe.  So the easy question is how do we stop breathing."

	We also have the drive to reproduce, all evolved organisms
	do. Of course, geneered ones could have this drive reduced,
	but that could be dangerous and even fatal for the Moties.
	Nevertheless, simple measures available currently on Terra
	could control Motie population growth: therapeutic abortions
	or infantacide. And even that assumes that there is some
	bizarre reason that the Moties cannot use hormones (or other 
	measures) to fool their bodies into thinking that they are 
	pregnant. By the way, given the abilities that the Moties 
	demonstrate in the books, I would expect that they could 
	allow a human to live without breathing (by ventilating the 
	lungs with a tube, or directly managing gas exchange with an 
	artificial lung).

Being a Solomani freedom fighter I can tell you right now that the 
Vilani library data is full of lies! First of all, calling the ROM
the \'ramshackle empire\' when it brought a higher tech-level and a 
higher degree of freedom to the populace than any rule before is 
ridiculous. Claming that Solomani are terrorists is another lie.
A terrorist is someone who terrorizes the civilian population into
getting what he wants. Being a revolutionary, I only attack military
targets, and do my best not to inflict civilian casualties. Finally,
there was never any reason to place Terra under Vilani control. The
library data incorrectly states that we were supressing non-Solomani
worlds, and Empress Margaret II was forced to revoke our charter.
What nonsense! Who has ever heard of a politician doing something
simply because it was \'the right thing to do\'! More akin to the 
Pacification wars of the early 21st century, where states where
taken over because they needed \'food & health care assistance\',
Empress Margaret II simply used this as an excuse to raise her
popularity ratings at the Vilani court.

No.  Some vehicle crew member perform spectacularly outside their vehicles
either through training or just innate competence.  The vast majority of
Marines if forced to fight un augmented will do a decent job of it.
However, there is that one guy who isn\'t prepared for the smoke and smells
and noise, and freezes.  It might be your company Ship\'s Sergeant or Force
Lieutenant, or it might be the guy calling in your fire support.

The rational is that no matter how many roles they serve unarmored, when
heavy combat comes up Marines suit up.  This means that the truly horrible
aspects of war are seen through a HUD from behind heavy armor.  A Marine
suddenly deprived of that protection might not be able to get the image of
what happens to unarmored people out of his mind, especially if the Opfor
is wearing BD.

Since we haven\'t seen much grounf combat in the HH novels beyond the
battles in _OBS_, the assault on the asteroid base in _THOTQ_, and the
attack on the prison complex in the latest one, I really couldn\'t say.

The Royal Manticoran Marines seem to more of a ship based force that the
traveller Marines.  They don\'t do jumps, and don\'t seem to have powered
armor in the Battledress sense.  They do carry gauss rifles.

Doing HH in Traveller might be difficult for two reasons:  The sheer size
of the ships, and the different FTL method used.

    'body' => 'Sometimes it is helpful to go back to the source material:

From "Imperial Marine Task Force Organization", by Loren Wiseman, JTAS#12,
pp. 42-45:

"The marines serve several functions. They provide a hard-hitting, rapidly
deployable strike force for offensive and defensive military operations.
They guard vital installations for the navy and other branches of the
Imperial government. They serve as an interstellar police force in many
places along the frontier, keeping the peace and enforcing the Imperial
rules of war. Because of this last function, they are known in mercenary
parlance as "the cops."

So it would appear that police actions and peace-keeping *are* missions for
the Imperial Marines. However, the article also says:

"All marine line troops are jump trained, and are issued jump capsules if
the mission warrants."

"Line marine units are equipped to tech level 15 standards. Marines used as
ship\'s troops usually lack vehicles, and are armed with hand-carried
weapons only. All marines are equipped with battle dress, and are armed
with FGMP-14s. Unlike other units, even administrative and logistical (but
not medical) personnel are equipped in this fashion, as all but medical
personnel in a marine unit are expected to be able to fight."

So Doug is quite correct in insisting that all Marines be battle dress
troopers. I suppose the slogan becomes "Every Marine a Trooper." I\'ll have
to think about what implications this has for operations less than
full-blown combat.

There is some ambiguity about whether the Imperial Marines follow the USMC
practice of getting their medical personnel (Hospital Corpsmen) on loan
from the Navy. MT Player\'s Handbook, p. 45, says "Marines have no medical
officers; they are treated by Navy doctors." If the medical personnel are
actually IN, then all Marines are expected to fight.

From the discussion of Task Forces, it appears that an Imperial Marine
regiment consists of:

[Regimental Headquarters]
3 Force Command Headquarters
9 Line Marine Companies
5 Meson Gun Batteries
2 Lift Cavalry Companies
1 Grav Tank Company
1 Commando Company
Various support elements form the "regimental pool", including:
	point defense
	nuclear damper
	scouts (called "recon" in GT: SM)
	medical
	maintenance
	mess and transport
	admin and logistics

The Imperial Marine Task Force in GT: SM (pp. 116-118) is therefore
somewhat misleading, in that it includes a complete Commando company "from
the regimental pool", when there is only one (GT:SM, p. 21, also says there
is only one company per regiment). It is also designed without the
additional assets required for long-term independent ops, and so is more
suitable for operations closely associated with its parent regiment.

From what I\'ve seen of the thread [may have missed some over the weekend]
it assumes that the GT template is not mutable [I always assumed it was],
and that all Marines are Imperial Marines.

CT Book 1 had Battle Dress, but not Battle Dress skill. IIRC this was
because BD was brought in later [Book 4], wherein BD subsumed Vacc Suit
_and_ how to operate the suit\'s built-in weapons and electronics. In
Book 4, about half the plasma weapons could only be used when in BD, as the
whole suit was used as a recoil carriage for the weapon. This makes
GT Battlesuit exactly parallel to CT Battle Dress.

CT Book 4 and JTAS both stress the Imperial Marines as a body which
responded "with speed and overwhelming force" and was equipped to TL
14-15. Again by CT Book 4, that would have had almost all of them in
Battle Dress, which IIRC is supported by the JTAS articles detailing
the structure of a Marine force.

But IMTU they don\'t work that way. Mind you, IMTU, which is heavily
CT based although now played in GT, Free Fall is not a prerequisite for
Vacc Suit which in turn is not a prerequisite for starship Piloting...

I am working at it all the time, I act as computer-4). At the end of 4
years you can continue to throw your self improvement at this target
(pretty sure I will), and then the bonus becomes permanent.

There was one paraplegic NPC in Trail of the Sky Raiders.  I imagine that
most forms of nerve damage will be repairable, but in some cases there will
be no way to restore function in the lower body.

I\'m currently playing with a GURPS write up for Arameth Gridlore.  Now Ari
was born in, and lived in, microgravity for the majority of his life.  He
has several disads surrounding this, like a very low strength, Skinny, Low
G-tolerance, and Quirks like "hates dirt" and thinks planet dwellers are
idiots"

Speaking from experience, chemotherapy *is* the Spanish Inquisition.  When
the nurse comes in wearing all sorts of gear to insure that not a single
drop of the stuff they are pumping into your veins touches her skin, you
gotta wonder.  Not to mention that bleomyacin (sp?) burns like hell until
it dilutes, making the entire arm with the IV feel like it\'s being eaten by
Army ants..  TL-8 medicine sucks.

There is a comment in one of the GURPS books that prosthetics and limb
cloning can be assumed to be rather common, so, in a High-Tech universe
players should come up with a reason why they are "still" disabled.

As a result, I don\'t think that every building would be fully accessible to
those who are handicapped. I think this would be a rare sight and the would
exist only on worlds with low tech levels.

However, I just got this great image in my head... MedTraders. The crews of
these merchant ships include those who are well trained in high-tech medical
techniques. They jump from world to world on a circuit selling what low-tech
folks will pay most for: a way to circumvent disabilities. They carry the
best generic prosthetics money can buy: arms, legs, eyes, high-tech
pacemakers, stuff like that. Some see their role as a romantic ideal:
providing relief to the unfortunate. Others, however, are opportunistic and
they pore over newsfeeds and are often the first to arrive after rebellions,
wars and disasters...

Hmm...\'cal\' on our Digital Unix box claims to be accurate for years
1-9999

cal 2 4000 gives:

       February 4000
Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
         1   2   3   4   5
 6   7   8   9  10  11  12

20  21  22  23  24  25  26
27  28  29

cal 1 4531 gives:

       January 4531
Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
     1   2   3   4   5   6
 7   8   9  10  11  12  13

21  22  23  24  25  26  27
28  29  30  31

Jan 9, 4531 is indeed a Tuesday, unless the underlying algorithms in
both MS Excel and Digital Unix 4.0 are both wrong, identically.

I vaguely recall having seen, somewhere, the algorithm for determining a
day for a given date, but for the life of me I can\'t remember where. If
It bubbles to the surface, I\'ll look it up and pass it along.

Book 8, Robots says that at TL14 direct computer implants into the brain
are possible, though 3I basically keeps these for curing neurological
disorders, not for IQ enhancement. I imagine this would include running an
ethernet cable between T9 and T7, skipping that damaged batch of nerves at
T8 altogether...

Then again, Christopher Reeves thinks we will have spinal cord injury cures
in the next few years.

Cool.  I\'m currently writing a calendar converter program in Delphi for
traveller.  Enter in a date in either Imperial, solomani, Vilani, Aslan, or
Zhodani date format, and it\'ll convert it to give you the equivalent date in
all the others.

I was going to assume that 001-0000 was a Jan 1, on the basis that as the
Imperial calendar was based on the solomani calendar, it would make sense
for Cleon to announce that his new calendar will start on the first day of
the next (solomani) year.

Also, using the calendars as described in the MT Ref\'s Companion, the dates
given for various events in the chronologies soon seem to get out of sync.
What do you feel are the *true* base dates for the calendars? Do you (or
anyone else) have a definitive list of equivalent dates for 001-0000 (or any
other given date) in each calendar?

This has gotten me thinking, and an apology if this has been covered in the
distant past.  In a few weeks I\'ll be starting MCSE classes for
certification.  In the Traveller, what level of Computer skill would that
confer?  Or for that matter, if you get certified by Sun for Solaris or
gain A+ for hardware?

IMO, I would give it Computer 2 or perhaps Computer 3 with limitations on
how the skill applied.

I figured this out for myself once.  But, as I recall, the founding date
given in the GDW _Solomani_ alien module was 19 Jan 4521.  That turns out
to be a Sunday according to UNIX\'s cal(1) program.  If we implement the
4000-year correction Herschel suggested, then Holiday is a Saturday, and 
the first Oneday of 0 Imperial (002-0) is on the third Sunday in AD 4521.

This is the current concept of a leap year. 1900 was not a leapyear, but
2000 will be. 4000 will not be. This is because the length of a year is
not 3.25 but (IIRC) 3.241 days. (Or some other ridiculous number like that.
You\'d think that knowing we were the center of the universe, things would
turn out differently.)

The algorithm for computing a the day of the week is stupid. Get a well
known date, for instance, January 1st 1900 was a Monday. (Great way to
start out the century <g>). Calculate number of days between january 1st
1900 and january 1st <your year> using the above leap year algorithm/kluge.
Count the number of days in between 1/1/<your year> and <your day> with a
table of 30 days hath september, april, june, and november, etc...
divide this whole mess by 7. The remainder (days modulus 7) is the day of
the week with monday being 0 (because of the well known date we picked).

Hmm... Should I import the imperial calendar into Office. I can then set a
reminder - email me two days before Cleon becomes Emperor. Then if I am 
busily working and not watching the news, I will know to send him an
online greeting card. (or course it will take several weeks to arrive...).

Besides, I think the Solomani Confederation uses their own calendar still.
Maybe it isn\'t ours, but it most certainly isn\'t based on the formation of
the 3I.

This is very true, however a freelance merchant can do best IMHO if he or she
skirts the edge between "backwater" and developed systems. Megacorps many times
ditch fractions of their cargo that have damaged cases or don\'t round out to
full cargo holds. And one never wants to be too far from a port able to make
repairs/modifications to your ship.

Now this is real free-trading, screw that fifty ton shipment of wood. Has any
body created a list of unusual cargoes? If I find mine, I\'ll post it.

I would say that the character learned those skills because he HAD to. Sounds
like a merchant working backwater systems in the service of an up-and-coming
trade consortium where such skills were very useful.

CT skills are very "grainy" in ratings, it would be unwise to allow skill
advancment if skill resolution remained the same.

Probably too scared of piracy in unpatrolled space. Pirates always make me

Lucky little Skin-Monkey. I am usually surrounded by "munchkins".

Very much like my arbiters choice of mixing High Guard with the basic CT
system, although you will note that this creates very skilled characters. I am
thinking of using this system for a home-rules campaign, but I think I will
convert skill resolution to something more like White Wolf\'s Storyteller
system. That should reduce the grainy nature of CT skill ratings.

Never played any Traveller except CT, but I have to agree on liking random
character generation. The approach CT takes makes it like playing a whole other
game. I like generating characters even more than playing actually.

I don\'t think Medical is EVER useless, Bribery (Yes inspector, I know I shouldn\'t
be transporting Bio-Hazardous materials without proper papers, but all safty
precautions have been taken. Perhaps we can come to some sort of, eh, aggreement?)
and Streetwise (Jik, we are running behind, and I need you to find me some high
profit cargo to fill up that last ten tons of space. No, I don\'t care if the cargo
is "hot", I need PROFIT! Just be quick, alright?) are like way Han Solo, Attribute
bonuses(boni?) are always appreciated, and who ever turns down Blade or Gun CBT?

  ISTR from the novel that many of those features (including Brown gear-
headism?) were attributed to mutations that occurred in the aftermath of
the destruction associated with the first few cycles - if so (and there
were _lots_ of Moties and mutagens running around during those years) then
must Motie geneering skill at the time be much greater than that of a 17th C.

My arbiter always allowed high rank to equate with background contacts, so
ranking military characters could try and finagle military surplus weapons and
equipment by calling in old favors, Merchant types could get trade information,
Scouts might know all kinds of odd rumours, etc.

No. Mr. Daniels was not saying that those skills are useless. They are
useless for a merchant on a starship. Medical doesn\'t quite work on the
drive system when it fails. You can\'t bribe the navigation computer when you
need to make a jump and you\'ll just look like an ass trying to use
streetwise to navigate through a planetoid belt. ;)

I based my thoughts on Traveller, the silly era.

(You\'ll of course want to go back and look at the rest of the silly stuff
on this site.)

Basically, if I mustered out right now, I would probably get computer-3, but
because I am inside them all the time now, and constantly reading more stuff
I gave myself a 4 based on the LBB rules on experience. 

Translating vacc-suit to computer, I think this means: Talks to other
programmers about computers as if they were sexual experiences, can whip
up a program to do perfect hashing or large number calculations w/o 
reference materials. Has studied algorithms, AI, parser generation at a
graduate level and worked for a number of years in the computer industry.

Now electronics is another story. I think electronics-4 would include \'can
build a CPU using transistors and a breakout board\'. I thought of this, 
never actually tried.

  FWIW, under CT/Striker being in BD wasn\'t _that_ big a deal - a PGMP-14
still kills most bugs dead, and Combat Armour of the same TL offers a very
similar level of protection (mobility isn\'t augmented, but that won\'t matter
much for a lot of missions). The BD as super-suit is a post-CT aberratio^h^h,

I\'ll call your bluff. Seeing as you take great pains to point out that you

Traveller Battle Dress?

My own canon line is something like this:

Marc Miller is way at the top of the period. He is the creator of Traveller
and the Third Imperium setting.

Loren Wiseman runs a close second. He worked closely with Marc, and he was a
strong influence on the Traveller universe.

Official GDW Classic Traveller materials are next on the list, including
JTAS.

Official GDW MegaTraveller and TNE materials are next.

DGP is next. They are spoken of highly, but they never seemed to make it to
my area. I\'ve never actually seen a DGP product...

I find it vaguely insulting that you are attempting to invoke the grognard
rule here. By the time you read this, you will most likely have seen
Christopher Thrash\'s post concerning Loren Wiseman\'s JTAS article on the
subject of Imperial marines. Specifically, I call your attention to the
statement "All marines are equipped with battle dress, and are armed with
FGMP-14s."

Obviously, anybody can play Traveller in any of its incarnations as they
would like. However, it\'s not very sporting to try to imply that your own TU
is "canon" because you think that you might have been playing longer.

If you\'ll pardon my asking, can you please find me a Classic Traveller canon
reference that says that Imperial Marines have to "work to earn their
BD-skill, let alone a suit of BD."

This is not a personal attack on you, but you did invoke almighty canon, and
a level of "grognard empathy" with the universe of the Third Imperium. I\'m
only asking you to back up your bold statements. ;)

Wow. I\'ll have to mark this date on my calendar! The first time I\'ve ever
argued *in favor of canon!* ;)

We do fully crew our starships, don\'t we?

G\'Day All,



I\'ve seen a bit of interest on the list about "designing" aliens. This stuff was
from an old New Scientist article by Jack Cohen, and has a number of interesting
bits in it, and chunks I don\'t agree with too. All my comments are in [square
brackets] and you can take them as my opinion only...



How to design an alien

======================

[from New Scientist, 21 December 1991, Vol.132 No.1800 Page 18]



During 30 years as a university lecturer in reproductive biology, I have
lectured to many school audiences. I thought it was an important and enjoyable
part of the job. One of the most popular requests was for my favourite subject:
\'The possibility of life on other planets\'. I must have given this talk more
than 300 times, and over the years science fiction writers have heard about it
and come to use my \'expertise\'. [Just ignore his self congratulatory note...]



Science fiction writers are in the business of giving us stories with an
alternative social or environmental background. They want the background to be
as authentic as possible. If the stories are based on another planet this means
building a new world ecology with a detailed evolutionary history so that the
plot does not have any obvious contradictions.



Over the years, I have been faced with many ideas about the kinds of aliens that
could be out there, but have always firmly rejected the usual anthropomorphic
(human-like) versions that some science fiction writers, as well as lay people
and professional scientists, have suggested. The famous geneticist Conrad
Waddington [Famous?! Well, to some perhaps!], for example, was sure that the
highest form of life on any Earth-like planet would closely resemble Waddington.
I reject this idea. Evolution is a contingent process: even if evolution on this
planet was run through again, the land vertebrates [The main point of this
article...] would be very unlikely to reappear and, even if something like them
did, their anatomies would have many important differences .



On any other planet, the chances of the same genetic systems as ours arising,
with the same oddities selected, leading to the same combinations of genes seem
slight. Finding another planet with our kind of dinosaurs or people is more
unlikely than finding a remote Pacific island on which the natives speak perfect
German or cockney rhyming slang.



So, if we can\'t have human beings or dinosaurs on alien planets, what are the
rules to use? Aliens cannot just be invented. \'Enter an intelligent gas cloud,
left . . .\' does not work without a lot of build-up. Biologists have learnt some
rules from our own evolutionary stories. Although every detail must be
different, there are patterns of general problems, and common solutions to those
problems, that would apply to life anywhere in the Universe. The most useful
clue to such common, or \'universal\', solutions is that several very different
organisms invented them separately on Earth. For example, aerial flight was
developed by the ancestors of birds, insects, and bats, and by the teleost
fishes.



Another example is photosynthesis, which was invented by several different
bacteria-type organisms (violet bacteria, cyanobacteria, and the ancestors of
green plants, and probably many more, now extinct). Yet another is evolutionary
symbiosis, in which several disparate organisms combine to make a much more
complex reproductive system, for example in the original eukaryote (nucleated)
cell, in termites and in cows, which have symbionts in their guts.



These universal solutions will, I am sure [Ah, to be sure...*grin*], be found on
pretty well all other planets with life. Many scientists think that such life is
extremely common in the Universe and that there are at least a million planets
with life even in our Galaxy. And, to answer your next question: yes, I do think
that intelligence [Wishful thinking. IMHO: intelligence doesn

society], though perhaps not self-awareness, is one of the universal solutions.
On this planet the cephalopods (octopuses, cuttlefishes [Interesting example.
Cuttlefish would be one of my alternatives that could have developed in place of
the vertebrates, but didn?t.] and squids), and several vertebrate clades
including carnivores, toothed whales and primates have achieved a great increase
in versatility of complex behaviour over their ancestors; I could argue for the
mantis shrimps, too, among the arthropods. So I reckon that there are plenty of
intelligent aliens, derived from diverse evolutionary pathways. That memorable
bar scene in the first Star Wars film may well have a real counterpart \'out
there\'.



There are, however, many important \'accidental\', contingent inventions too, such
as the suite of anatomical oddities that we, Waddington and all other land
vertebrates have inherited [Did they?  Early vertebrate evolution is
controversial!] from the fish-that-came-out-of-the-water (possibly
Eusthenopteron). These oddities I call \'parochial\'; they would be specific to
one evolutionary line on one planet only. What do I mean by a universal or
parochial solution? I have argued that two of the adaptations explained so
whimsically in Rudyard Kipling\'s Just So Stories - how the elephant got its
trunk and how the giraffe got its long neck - could be examples of the same
universal solution. The elephant has immensely thick legs - surely a universal
solution to the problem of supporting bulk on a planet with a reasonably high
gravity. But it has a trunk, which looks like a contingent evolutionary
characteristic that could only occur on Earth. How the alien got its universal
characteristics Now look at the giraffe. We usually assume that the adaptive
advantage of a long neck is being able to browse on the higher branches not
reached by its competitors. But another way to view the giraffe is not primarily
as a peculiar feeder but as a peculiar strider. Because of its unusual
locomotion, the longer the front legs are, the faster it can run (its gait is
more of a \'pace\' than that of most mammals). So selection may have been mostly
for longer legs, which took its head further from the ground. Feeding was not
difficult, because now it could, indeed, browse higher than its competitors, but
drinking was. Water is found only at ground level, so if you want to dr=
ink
without kneeling you need a long neck - or a trunk. These characteristics
provide the same solution to the drinking problem, not the browsing-competition
problem.



Alien evolutionary solutions would produce these subtly but deeply similar
solutions as well as the obviously similar ones. This is why a knowledge of the
local experiment in evolution is necessary for inventing and assessing alien
designs; it requires a generalisation of the biology we know. This involves
deeper, more divergent science than DNA-is-God-and-RNA-is-its-Prophet molecular
biology and is much more fun, too.



Every evolved creature will not only have the universal solutions; it will also
have its own special, peculiar set of parochial ones. Just as we can recognise
universals in our evolutionary story because they manifest themselves in many
diverse ways [Dubious argument, but I think I know what he means.], so we should
be able to recognise parochials because they happened only once. Sometimes,
however, we cannot tell if something happened once, or many times over. RNA and
replication may have originated many times in an abiotic world, or only once,
and then multiplied enormously - molecules are not stamped with their patent
date. Usually we can tell, however: mammalian-type hair, with its follicle and
papilla machinery, bird feathers, hydraulic locomotion in spiders, delicate
manipulation by multiple suckers in cephalopods are all parochials. These
evolutionary tricks contrast with the use of hairy structures by both mice and
bumblebees for thermal insulation, jointed exoskeletal limbs in crustaceans,
spiders and insects, and thin branched ends to limbs for manipulation by mammals
and insects, which are universals.



Some of our own parochial characters are common to all land vertebrates, and
were presumably \'invented\' by our common ancestor, perhaps Eusthenopteron. We
all have ventral lungs, so the trachea opens ventrally from the floor of the
\'throat\'; consequently, all of us have airways that can get in the way of our
food-ways. This is an awful bit of design, and is one of the best arguments
against special creation. Our hands and feet have the common \'pentadactyl\'
pattern, variations of which are characteristic of all the descendants of
Eusthenopteron but of no other organisms on this planet [Objection, your honor!
Somewhere in Nature I seem to remember seeing some paper on 6, 7, & 14 digit
amphibians from the Carboniferous era!].



Joints are a universal, but knees and elbows, five fingers - even bone - - are
parochial. The development of vertebrate gonads and their ducts is inextricably
mixed up with the kidneys and urinary ducts, and usually with the cloaca too. So
our \'instinctive\' reproductive behaviour has all kinds of parasitological
hang-ups. It could have been anticipated that an intelligent vertebrate social
species would find much of its social excitement in sexual guilts [What the
hell?! I think this comes under the category of "brain fart"]. Aliens that do
not share this set of parochials (and few would share some of them) will not
have faces like ours at all - eyes, yes, but nose, external ears,
teeth-like-scales, no - and certainly will not share our interest in prurient
experience. No alien pornography of our kind, then. Some of the standard cliches
of science fiction come to pieces when they are viewed in this light.
Anthropomorphic aliens are everywhere, like Star Trek\'s Mr Spock - whose
evolutionary convergence is so close to us that hybrids can be made (when we cannot even breed with our brothers
and sisters the reptiles and fishes, or a cousin like the octopus). The Klingons
are obviously a device to save make-up, no more alien than our sibling species
the chimpanzees. I disbelieve all the flying saucer stories that have little
green men, not because they are little and green, but because they are men.
Little green splots would be so much more believable.



Science fiction writers have two opposing temptations when designing aliens -
towards and against aliens that resemble people. Towards, because the reader can
identify more easily and the extras for the film version are not so costly. And
against, because of scientific likelihood and the opportunities to exercise the
disciplined imagination. So there are many respectable aliens in literature, as
well as the strictly impossible such as Mr Spock. Hal Clement\'s famous story,
which he wrote in the 1950s, called Mission of Gravity [I?d like to read this,
has anyone else?], concerned the giant, rapidly rotating planet Mesklin. It had
a variable gravity of 600g at the flattened poles and only 4g at the equator.
The scenario was correct scientifically - Clement, alias Harry Stubbs, is a
college physics teacher.



The intelligent Mesklinites were like enormous centipedes, derived from aquatic
jet-propelled ancestors, and they have diverged in biology and culture. Their
culture near the north pole has all the phobias you would expect at high
gravity, but Clement exposes the world and its life to us via an odyssey to
rescue a United Planets probe that crashed at Mesklin\'s south pole. Barlennan,
the hero, is an odd Mesklinite who is prepared to endure psychological stress -
like being six inches above ground, or having a heavy object above him briefly -
in order to learn new things. Like most 1950s aliens, Barlennan and his crew are
really dressed-up Americans in outlook, but the book is one of the first
systematic attempts to invent a world, and it is still fun to read.



One of the best-realised alien cultures, found in Larry Niven and Jerry=
Pournelle\'s book The Mote in God\'s Eye, is much more complex and alien =
[I feel the same, but a biologist friend of mine still thinks they?re little green men
with funny backbones *grin*]. During an alien war, for example, the so-called
\'watchmaker\' variants of the aliens not only invade human ships, but repair and
improve their equipment too - and that is a necessary part of both the ambience
and the plot. Other aliens in Niven\'s books inhabit his Known Space: a
moderately consistent fictional construct with about 20 well-worked-out kinds of
aliens. He has Outsiders, exposed to space on their skeletal \'spaceships\',
following the Star-Seeds on their 100 000-year cycle into and out of the Galaxy
(I do not think we are ever told what Star-Seeds are), and serving as
information-brokers. There are the cowardly Puppeteers, the Bandersnatchi, great
galleon-like creatures on many planets, disseminated by the ancient Slavers - no
one knows if they are intelligent. Some of you will have met this universe in
Niven\'s best-selling novel Ringworld, or others of the series. You may know of
Jim White\'s Hospital Station series, too, in which a plethora of unlikely - that
is to say, likely - aliens crew a space hospital. White imports a series of
puzzles, one per story, to exercise the hospital\'s staff and the reader\'s mind.
I helped White with many of these. Some of my ideas have also got into Niven\'s
Known Space stories, but my best known alien contribution to Niven is probably
the grendels [He admits inventing grendels!!!  Such a boring alien!  A crocodile
on speed - and even then such a poor one, to this day I don\'t know whythey
needed to invent the magic go-juice instead of better muscle/bone leverage, or
some group-hunting mechanic, in fact, a whole bunch of things that are more
likely to evelove than magic go-juice. And the ecology! So simple! - ahhhhh
don\'t get me started - my opinion of grendels are off-topic].



I have helped Brian Aldiss a bit with his Heliconia series, despite the
unlikelihood of Heliconia\'s anthropomorphic creatures. Heliconia is a world
orbiting in a complex planetary system of a binary star such that its seasons
last hundreds of years. Aldiss uses these bizarre (and impossible) climatic
swings to probe the social structures on a world of exotic but Earth-like
creatures. Aldiss works the aliens into our minds much as stories of earlier
eras used goblins and ghosts and long-legged beasts. His aliens latch onto our
myths, and Aldiss then twists our real-world perceptions most agreeably - his
aliens do not have to be likely, they have to be potent symbols, and I was happy
to be able to help with this artistic, rather than scientific, endeavour.



I have not yet invented any aliens of my own because I am convinced that aliens
would be so different as to make any interaction with humans unlikely. And that
would not make much of a story. But there are two science-fiction universes
where I have contributed ideas about the interaction between humans and alien
life forms: Harry Harrison\'s West of Eden series, and Annie McCaffrey\'s Dragons
of Pern series. In Harrison\'s novels, the meteorite supposedly did not hit the
Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period and kill off the dinosaurs and their
relations. The result was that intelligent reptiles, the Yilane, developed from
mosasaurs. I was able to create a credible world-view for them, because they are
our cousins.



McCaffrey\'s Dragons of Pern was more difficult. McCaffrey had already invented
alien life forms: \'Thread\', an irrational \'menace\' which rained down from the
skies of Pern and \'destroyed everything organic\'; and fire-lizards, an
indigenous life form from which the dragons she needed for her plots had been
engineered. She had written most of the later stories before we cooperated on
the \'first\' one. Nevertheless, McCaffrey\'s dragons have been made by people,
engineered from local life forms to solve a problem by symbiosis with people, so
it is alright to assume that there is a mutual understanding between people and
dragons. What was really difficult was putting together all the other props into
a consistent alien ecology [I agree].



Even if interaction with way-out alien life forms causes problems, there is
another way that a biologist like me can enjoy thinking about alien life. This
involves testing my evolutionary paradigms by generalising them to wider
contexts. Universal evolutionary solutions are OK, but how do you test invented
alien parochials? My test has been, again: \'if an organism on Earth solves a
particular problem using a parochial trick, this shows it is possible\' for an
alien. I gave a talk at the World Science Fiction Convention in 1979, and was
challenged to invent likely evolutionary scenarios for a variety of famous types
of alien - by their creators. I have done this publicly some tens of times since
then, and it has been fun.



I will give you an example of a tiny bit of constructed evolutionary history for
an invented alien creature. The creature is the Tribble, famous from David
Gerrold\'s episode of Star Trek in which they provided the major story line.
Tribbles are, when we see them on the screen, galaxy-wide cuddly pets. They are
furry hemispheres with almost no features, but of many different colours. We are
told that they eat almost anything organic, and that they are prolific breeders.
Indeed, they \'devote half of their metabolism to reproduction\', are \'born
pregnant\' and \'reproduce at will\'. In the course of the story they multiply
amazingly, especially in dark cupboards and other spaces. They make a purring,
trilling sound when stroked, which seems to soothe everybody\'s nerves. They seem
most unlikely aliens.



One of the least believable characteristics of the Tribbles is that everybody -
except the Klingons - loves them. Clearly they are symbionts, eating anything -
anything? Who would want a symbiont that ate everything? You could not leave any
food about. But just a moment, they would eat faeces, wouldn\'t they? Like
village dogs in the tropics, they would clean up after their hosts. Let us
imagine a burrowing alien whose food, perhaps a grass-like plant, is eaten
outside the burrow - something like a rabbit, mouse or marmot. The last is
potentially interesting, because marmot burrows can be shared, by a burrowing
owl and a rattlesnake. Let us imagine the alien or \'exo-marmot\' burrow also
inhabited by a couple of very different predators. A slug-like detritivore would
find rich pickings in abandoned burrows. Perhaps, later, some exo-marmots would
welcome a creature that acts as a Hoover.



This \'proto-Tribble\' would lose any characteristics that made its ancestor
repellent or obvious as it adapts to living with its exo-marmot symbiont. Those
that do not get noticed by the other inhabitants of the burrow system do even
better. So the Tribbles lose an obvious head, sense organs and proper locomotory
organs as they become the \'every burrow should have one\' general symbiont. The
requirements of their breeding system, however, are very stringent: they must be
continent within the burrow, but be able to multiply extremely rapidly if they
get a chance to colonise a new burrow system. This is similar to the problem
faced by Gyrodactylus, a monogenean ectoparasite of fishes, which should not
dam-age its host fish (but frequently does, in ponds and aquaria) but should
multiply rapidly on a new host. This parasite has two, or even three,
generations in its uterus, and sperm from its last few matings can invade any
mature embryos. The parasite can be a grandmother even before it is born. On
transfer to a new fish, the embryos, and their embryos, hatch quickly and each
generates more babies from the mixed sperm population that they all inherit. In
the same way, our proto-Tribble could be \'born pregnant\', and each Tribble would
be many genetic lines, not just one individual\'s genetics (that is why so many
differently coloured Tribbles appeared all over the Starship Enterprise, of
course). I have a picture of them creeping out of their individual burrows on
moonlit nights, mating on the exo-grass and returning with their renewed genetic
diversity (but I have not assumed an egg-sperm system, which might be a
parochial; diploidy [My biologist friend says: Diploidy =3D 2 chromosomes. Two
chromosomes are a necessary safeguard against information loss. Egg-sperm system
are almost certainly local - but some means of generating random mixing of
proven genetic patterns may be universal] or an equivalent is probably a
universal).



The exo-marmot, however, did not stay like that; it evolved slowly towards a
kind of universal innkeeper organism, becoming intelligent and acquiring many
more guest symbionts to add to its original couple of predators. Young
exo-marmots, much bigger now, were intrigued by Tribble behaviour - they bred
them for colour pattern and, later, for the purring sound. I have not space here
to give the long and eventful history of the exo-marmots; in the end, they never
managed to restrict population growth. They never learned from their Tribbles,
either the lesson of continence or the penalties of profligacy. Apart from
keeping science fiction readers and writers happy, why should scientists like me
be interested in inventing and criticising such alien life forms? Science works
by asking questions around what we think we know, of the type \'what might be . .
. ?\' That is the way we generate theories, design experiments and test
explanations, so our prejudices about evolution on Earth can be tested against
hypothetical but rational alternatives. And it is worth remembering that science
fiction is a hidden, and often unappreciated asset to the scientific community.
A well thought out best-selling novel by Clement, Niven or McCaffrey does much
more for the public understanding of science than any number of public meetings
or worthy popularisations of science on television, or even in New Scientist.

I think that there are different kinds of action. In the more developed and
established areas, you\'re going to have alot more intercorporate "black
ops," since, to some extent these things are almost legal. Stuff like
kidnapping, assassination, data and research theft, headhunting, defections,
stuff like that.

To be honest, I agree. There are certain considerations that Traveller has
that many other games don\'t. Andy Slack went into some of these
considerations years ago in his excellent White Dwarf article "Backdrop of
Stars," and many of them hold true today.

What I mean, Keven, is that you, from what I\'ve seen, have an excellent grip
on canon. You can put those random rolls together and create a character who
has depth and who you feel you can play. Hamlin\'s a great character, but it
also looks like he was blessed with a number of good skills.

Unfortunately, not all players have the same knowledge of the universe going
in. While I don\'t doubt you can create an effective merchant character with
bow combat, groundcar and admin skills, not everybody can.

Thnk you very much for informing me that fixing the drive when it breaks is

If you would have deigned to try to understand my original point, perhaps
you wouldn\'t have needed to resort to base sarcasm. It is possible to roll
up a character that doesn\'t have a single ship-based skill. Hence, it is
quite difficult for him to be part of that fully crewed starship that you

him to be on the free trader in the first place, except to use his
specialized abilities when they\'re called for, and that means that in the

This is not known at all.  It is currently believed that life
began "quickly" on the _Earth_.  There is solid evidence of life
3.5 billion years ago and decent evidence for life 3.9 billion
years ago.  The planet was almost certainly uninhabitable more
than 4.2 billion years ago and the "late heavy bombardment"
(which is thought to have impactors big enough to sterilize the
planet) is thought to have lasted until about 4 billion years
ago.  It can be claimed that the error bars in estabishing the
length of the interval are bigger than the interval itself.
Basically, life is thought to have arisen over a period of
0-700 million years.

The idea that life began so quickly on Earth has lead to the
speculation that life is common (and increased interest in seeing
if there was ever any life on Mars or Europa).  However, this
is, indeed speculation.  It is based mostly on the assumption
that there is nothing "special" about the Earth.

Ah, um! ;->

OTOH, it *could* be a cloud of magnetically charged (or
gravitationally suspended) particles that are held in place for a
few turns by a field generated by the ship.  In which case the
"sand" would travel along with the ship...for a while.  The downside
could be that the sand reduces the ship\'s sensors to 0 along the
covered arc while in use.

Hum...well, I can understand the reasoning behind it, and in CT (and
maybe MT) it makes some sense.  

A brief synopsis of how the different Traveller systems looked at
Characteristic and Skill levels...

In CT, Attribute (Characteristic) levels were only sometimes used
and then mainly as a +/- 1 DM on a 2d6 roll.  Skills (if you had
them) were more important than the Att although their average level
(~1.5) was only about 1/3 the average ATT level (7).  What really
dominated was the 2d6 roll.  I don\'t recall a lot of complaints
about it, at the time, but then I wasn\'t "hooked up" with a large
group of vocal folks like the TML then.  ;->

In MT, Attributes were used at A/5, so the range was 0 to 3 with 1
most common.  This meant that Skills were still more important than
the Att (and by about the same amount), and the 2d6 roll was still
most important of all when it came down to doing things.  The
largest complaints I recall hearing about the MT task system were
that the Att was undervalued, and the Task Level steps
were...(something or other...hard to remember?  Was that it?).
Actually, I think most people *liked* the MT system...didn\'t like
the errata.

With TNE, things turned on their head..it seems to me.  The Att and
the Skill had equal weight in the Task resolution, *but* the Att
averaged about twice as high as the skill (even though you got more
skills than before).  So, here the Att level became more important
than the Skill, and lots of folks didn\'t like that.  Then there was
the 1d20, I think that bugged CT purists more than even the V word.
;-> Thing is, this system does *work* pretty well, and is, darn it,
down right elegant.

T4 stayed with full Att + skill, so Att remained too dominate in
many people\'s opinion.  OTOH, it used multiple d6\'s, rather than the
d20, so a lot of us old CT folks were more willing to give it a
shot.  ;-> Think is T4 broke down on hard tasks making them too easy
for most people\'s tastes.  KB\'s alternative system actually fixes
the problems pretty well, but it isn\'t official.  Heck, I get the
feeling that it is actively disliked by the only source of official
approval/disapproval we have.

Personally, I think I would prefer a system where the *average*
Skill level is about the same as the *average* Attribute level.
Maybe like MT, but with Att/3 rather than 5 and a broader range of
Task levels.  Here Skill is still a little more than Att, but they
are much closer. Example:

(A/3+S+2d6) against task level. 

Average Guy: ATT 7 (7/3=2), Skill 2 = 4+7 = 11

 3+  Easy           success
 6+  Routine        success
 9+  Difficult      83%
12+  Formidable     42%
15+  Staggering      8%
18+  Hopeless       failure
21+  Impossible     failure


.or like TNE, but with the first time you gain a Skill you roll a
d6 rather than just take 1 level (this boosts average Skill levels
by 2.5) and, on average, makes the two parts of an an Asset just
about the same.  Then the Task could be Att+Skill, Skill+Skill, or
Att+Att >= (some D) and it would all work out. 

I see two possibilities for the dice and Task difficulty to go,
either 3d6 and +/- numbers for the different levels or 1d20 and the
normal */ of TNE.  Frankly, I think the TNE method is the most
elegant way to go, as per...

Average Guy: Att 6, Skill 5 = 11

Assetx4  Easy       44  95%
Assetx2  Routine    22  95%
Asset    Difficult  11  55%
Asset/2  Formidable  5  25%
Asset/4  Staggering  2  10%
Asset/8  Hopeless    1   5%
Asset/12 Impossible  0   5%

Sorry, about all this, but when Skills come up I start tinkering
again. ;->

I agree you should get something, but I don\'t think it should be an
automatic extra skill level.  Um..maybe the number of rolls you get
on the mustering out tables equal 1 plus the number of promotions
and commissions you received in a career?  So, if you spend 20 years
in a career, but never get promoted you get only 1 roll when
mustering out, but if you get a commission and 4 promotions you get
6 rolls.  Now, *that* would make promotions desirable!  Makes some
sense too, a 20 year Private won\'t get the same benefits as a 20
year Major.

Roc, you sound bitter.  Don\'t be.  There are still a lot of us out
here that aren\'t completely bought into GT\'s way of doing things.
There is a lot of good material in the GT books, but everyone can
pick and choose the parts they want to use and adapt to their games.
If every Marine is a BD pilot that won\'t be a part I use, and that\'s
okay with me.  I\'m used to going my own way, it\'s part of being a
heretic, you know.

Now, *you* can be a heretic, too!  I promise it only hurts for a bit and
then you don\'t feel a thing.  ;->

As for my universe; all Marines get trained in Battle Dress (at least for
familiarization) and have it issued.  It is the preferred gear for combat
but it is NOT always used in combat (due to space considerations,
psychological or political reasons).  But all the Marines have a suit of BD
fitted to their frames; some Marines end up wearing them only at annual
maneuvers, some Marines wear the same suit through many battles in a
20-year combat career, and some Marines get new suits every few years
because of battle damage, transfer to a recon or commando unit, or
promotion to officer.  When the Marine leaves the Corps, the suit is
recycled for a new Marine, or scrapped for parts.  It is not available as a
muster-out benny.

And since the Battle Dress armor value is not that much better than Combat
Armor, BD does not become an invincible walking fortress; BD Marines die, a
bit slower than Combat-Environment Suited Marines, but they die
nonetheless.

I have no trouble with them all having issue battledress but I 
cannot envision an elite force that is so lacking without 
their special toy. Imperial Marines without BD should still 
be something to make most yahoos run for cover. As fast as they 
can. 
 
If GT is going the route that IM\'s are exclusivly BD, I disagree 
and will chart the course of the heretic. IMTU they will be something
to be feared with or without BD.

No doubt. Query: How almost legal? There seems to be a strong undercurrent of
"shady dealings" in my arbiters campaign(he\'s very good at GMing), and I
alway\'s get nervous with black ops. I am not a strong Imperial sympathizer, but
neither do I want to get on their "bad side". Additionally, the less "almost
legal" actions are, the more cut-throat the participants usually are, so...  ;)

Some of the resposibility lies on the arbiter as well. A party can be rounded
out with a non-player character, the campain can focus on what you are good at,
"freebie skills" etc. can be given in moderation (it IS *your* game), or
secondary characters can be added. The Traveller Universe has the nice aspect
of an enormous backdrop of a variety of tech levels to stage a campain. You
could easily mis-jump and crash-land into nearly any setting, or augment
low-tech skills with high-tech tools (T15 Compound Bow w/ HUD and HEAP
Gyro-Shafts (tm) anyone?).

That\'s...well, let\'s back up a step.  I haven\'t really been following this
thread, so bear with me.  There\'s a more mathematical analysis at the same
site in http://caliban.physics.utoronto.ca/neufeld/FTL.stuff/acausal.ps.

As best as I can tell, the Traveller jump drive is defined in such a way
that there\'s a preferred reference frame; it behaves differently from the
ship\'s point of view depending on the relative speed between the ship and
some given world.  This violates special relativity.  If this *isn\'t* true 
we can build a time machine, which I think works as follows.

Let\'s say that we\'ve got a ship that can teleport at an effective speed
of 1020x lightspeed (effectively jump-6).  It\'s also got a 6G drive.
We\'ll start at rest relative to Earth, and jump 20 ly (about 6 pc) away
to Remulak.  We exit jump at Remulak, still at rest relative to Earth.
While there, we refuel and accelerate away from Earth to some speed v,
spending time t in system.  Then we jump back to Earth; total trip time
measured at Earth is T.  Now, according to the analysis in acausal.ps,
we get a final equation which can be re-written in this case as

  T == 20(2/1020 - v) + t
       where t and T are in years and v is measured as a fraction of
       lightspeed.

If we don\'t accelerate relative to Earth at all while at Remulak (v == 0),
and spend 3 hours (0.000342 years) there, then elapsed trip time for the
ship as measured at Earth is
 
  T == 20(2/1020 - 0) + 0.000342 == 0.0396 year, or about two weeks.

Let\'s try that again, but this time we\'ll spend the three hours at Remulak
accelerating to 600 km/s (0.002 c) relative to Earth with our 6G drive. 
Elapsed trip time as measured at Earth is then

  T == 20(2/1020 - 0.002) + 0.000342 == -0.000442 year, or -3.87 hours.

.so, the ship ends up at Earth almost four hours *before* it left!

I believe the beauty of a good roleplayer is to work as one in a larger
group and contribute to the fun and enjoyment of human interaction.

Anything else is just icing. I\'m not sure precisely where the concept of
"allowing players to play the sorts of characters they want to play" got
mutated into "giving players the best stats and skills."

<Shrug> You\'ve not added anything new to the debate here. I\'m not denying
that Imperial marines are trained to fight without armor. I do think that,
in the majority of cases, their training, skills and experience will not gel
in the same way as those who are expected to always survive without the
assistance of the ultimate single-man weapons platform.

"Training, skills and experience" has been my mantra throughout this entire
discussion. Perhaps I\'m unclear on what I mean by those words:

Training covers instruction, study and basic drilling. Natural talent can be
factored in.

Skills cover what a person learns from applied training. This would cover
stuff along the lines of the survival course you mentioned before or
full-scale wargames. The training is honed to a razor sharp point. Again,
people can discover natural talent in the skill-gaining phase as well.

Experience covers everything a person learns when that razor sharp point is
applied in real life. If a situation goes right, the experience gained is
valuable, if the situation goes wrong, the experience gained is priceless.
Once again, natural talent can play a large part in this.

To use a non-military example that everyone can understand: Imagine I\'m
taking a college course, say a math course. Training covers the teachers
instruction and sample problems done in class. Skill-acquisition covers
homework and testing. After all, I\'m doing problems on my own, without a
safety net. I\'m learning how to apply my training in various ways.
Experience covers what happens once I get out in the real world and start
using my training and skills to earn a living.

Experience is the only thing that can\'t be taught. All things being equal, I
am of the opinion that experience is probably the most important of the
three categories.

As an example, an Imperial marine may be trained in the use of many small
arms. He may even, like modern marines, have be skilled well enough with the
use of the rifle to maintain his post. An imperial marine may be able to
kill someone with a knife, his bare hands, or a popsicle stick. That\'s
secondary.

That doesn\'t mean he\'s got experience. He hasn\'t held that popsicle stick in
his sweaty hand and driven it into the throat of an enemy.

An Imperial marine\'s training may very well cover alot of different things.
However, since the skills an Imperial marine needs to survive are tied in
with his vehicle, that\'s where the bulk of his training is going to fall.

Imperial marines might do very well on survival courses. They might do very
well with ACRs and gauss guns. However, most of the skill-acquisition is
going to be based on the suit. As I\'ve already said: If you\'d like to think
of a marine\'s suit as a piece of equipment that is roughly the same as
tossing on a Kevlar vest, go right ahead. However, that\'s something that is
completely impossible to rectify in my own mind.

Fair enough, and I honestly don\'t think that we\'re going to be able to find
middle ground on the issue of "vehicle vs. a suit of armor."

Personally, I think that the very tactics of battle dress use would be quite
different from anything we\'ve seen. I also think that the use of spaceships
and gravitics would galvanize a new theory of combined arms. I think that
this, coupled with the innate technological sophistication and control
considerations of battle dress would specialize the soldier to such a degree
that it could no longer even be considered "infantry warfare."

As an example of what I mean, look at how Heinz Guderian\'s influential book
"Achtung Panzer" helped to reinvent modern warfare after World War I. Prior
to this, the role of armor was entirely different, sort of like rolling
bunkers with light artillery to support infantry. The role of air power
changed drastically as well.

Then, with each new form of technology, the face of warfare has changed,
sometimes subtly, sometimes drastically. Airmobile infantry, attack
helicopters, cruise missiles, smart bombs, intercontinental ballistic
missiles...

Personally, I find it difficult to imagine that powered armor will be used
in the same capacity as infantry, or that the training, skills, esperience
and tactics will be completely compatible with each other.

I think I\'ve made my opinion on this clear several times. It\'s a matter of
both focus (where the bulk of the training and skill acquisition is aimed)
and experience (how it\'s applied on the battlefield).

Note the smiley face ;)

However, I wouldn\'t say that\'s completely incompatible with literature. Many
fine examples of literature, especially poetry, have come out of the
"battlefield canvas." The British ranks were swelling with fine poets during
the First World War. In fact, it is thought by some that if a good number of
them had survived, a new movement in English literature would have been born
in Britain. However, I digress. That\'s not entirely relevant to the
discussion at hand.

Once again, I think it comes down to our differences in the way that we see
powered armor being used in the Third Imperium.

>You seem to assume that there will only be one type of enemy encountered,
>those armed with weapons to take out a BD-equipped trooper.

Well, yes. That would most likely be the quickest way to remove an Imperial
marine from his armor. Otherwise, they\'re not going to have to much of a
problem.

>I assumed that
>our marines would also assault strongpoints where the heavy weapons would
be
>capable of taking down armour support and BD-equipped marines.

Okay. That seems to be a fair enough assumption as well.

>You are now
>saying that if the marine has his suit disabled and has to leave it behind,
>he is also no match for the supporting enemy troops with ACR\'s and cloth
>armour.

Yes and no. I am saying that the bulk of his training and skills, and the
*overwhelming majority* of his experience is going to be aimed towards using
his kickass weapons platform.

I am saying, that all things being equal, an Imperial marine climbing out of
disabled battle dress is going to be, pound for pound, less effective than
an infantry soldier. I am saying that in open combat, with both sides being
armed and armored equally, an infantry soldier would be at a distinct
advantage.

Now, on the other hand, I\'m not adverse to the concept of elite Imperial
marines. Guys who are both masters of battle dress and non-battle dress
combat. These guys would be on the same level as, say, theNavy Seals or
other hardcore high-end special forces. However, they\'d be the exception,
not the rule.

Few people in real life can measure up to the sheer Adonis-like perfection
that these elite groups require. They would not be the adventuring rank and
file.

>I\'d mention that historically, when a piece of armour was
>neutralised, those firing upon said armour would usually change target to
>another functioning piece of armour, leaving the crew and supporting ground
>troops to their own supporting ground troops to neutralise,

Fair enough. However:

1.) A high-tech battlefield is likely to be extremely hot. A guy climbing
out of his lobster suit is going to havea damn good chance of being turned
into a puddle by incidental fire.

2.) Imperial marines will *usually* be involved in assault, not defense.
Those defenders dressed in cloth will have the distinct advantage as they
can already have their weapons trained on the poor Impie marine before he
even gets out.

3.) There\'s alot of time, effort and specialized training that goes into
making an Imperial marine. The enemy does not want that specialist getting
off the battlefield to come back in another suit.

>but you told me
>before that using real life/historical examples was
>incorrect/unfair/unrealistic(?),

Bah... Now I can tell that you\'re simply trying to bait me, or you haven\'t
been reading my posts. Either one is not very sporting, Roc. As everyone\'s
favorite baldheaded evil genius might say: "Throw me a frickin\' bone here,
people!"

No. I said that with the real life examples you were using, you were
stacking the deck in your favor picking things that, in my opinion, are the
exception, not the rule. Here are the ones I remember:

WWII American marines filling in for American Infantry: I stated my opinion
clearly on this. To assume that American World War II marines are anything
like Imperial marines is like assuming that the B2 Stealth Bomber fills the
same role as a WWI Gotha bomber. As technologies change, roles of fighting
forces will change, and the names attached to them might no longer apply in
the same way.

To use an example I\'ve already mentioned: The leaders in World War I did not
use their armor pieces in the same way as the Germans did when they went on
their offensive campaign.

The Siege of Tobruk: You picked a special case where backs were to the wall
and tried to apply it across the board.

Australian survival course: You equated a survival course with a combat
situation, which I don\'t think is a fair comparison.

No. However, it seems like you\'re starting to put words into my mouth,
something that I don\'t usually react favorably too.

It takes a mighty big nutcracker to crack battle dress. Any weapon of
sufficient power to crack battle dress is going to be more than powerful
enough to decimate the poor battle dress pilot who hatches from his cracked
egg like a vulnerable baby bird. Okay, that was flowery and pretentious. I
think I\'m having too much fun here ;)

However, it doesn\'t take a huge, high-tech nutcracker to nail the poor
battle dress pilot who discovers himself suddenly unprotected. A sniper with
a low-tech rifle can ice him. A guy with an even lower tech bow can stick
one or more shafts through him. A machine-gun emplacement can riddle him
with bullets. Shrapnel, stray bullets, the splash from a plasma rifle or the
larger splash from a plasma cannon, all of these things can conspire against
the poor Imperial marine.

But what, there\'s more! Hell, the majority of worlds are rather unpleasant
to begin with! How long does our intrepid Johnny Rico clone last in a
vacuum? A hostile atmosphere? An insidious atmosphere? A <sigh> Chlorine
based atmosphere?

C\'mon, tell me. ;)

My assumption is that you mean David and Goliath. There are real world
examples where the human spirit wins despite opposition by a larger, more
accomplished and formidable foe. I don\'t doubt this. These are exceptions to
the rule, and I honestly don\'t think that they should be considered the
standard.


>Well, the point is, if the army has that equipment (BD\'s) available to
them,
>why bother fielding the marines in the first place?

A very good question. I\'d say that the doctrine and tactics of the Impie
Marines are different than that of the Imperial Army.

Impie marines are expected to work closely with the Impie navy. One of their
specialties would be a sort of orbital blitzkrieg. They are dropped in their
capsules to the surface of a planet where they eliminate the enemy\'s big
guns that would otherwise endanger troop ships and the vessels that would
serve as ortillery. They\'d also clear LZs for landing craft.

Of course, again, you\'re assuming that the battlefield is not hot, and that
the world is not hostile to human beings. Neither case is likely to be true.

Fair enough. You say tomato and I say...um... that marines are battle dress

I feel that less than 50% of the marines will have battledress training.
Not every marine will qualify for battledress training (disqualifiers
include [even if controlled with medication] mild clostrophobia
[anything more would disqualify for the marines], lack of body control
[mussle "ticks", mild sezures, etc.], lack of mental control). The
breakdown of the Imperial Marines will be as such:

Marine Infantry: This is the first unit a marine recruit will see after
bootcamp.  This unit is more a training ground than anything else.  Its
duty in combat is to expand and hold a bridgehead until the army
arrives.  It will take over a bridgehead established by the Drop Troops
and expand it to the size needed by the army.  The young marines entire
goal while assigned to the infantry is to qualify for another unit (if
they wanted this knid of job they would have joined the army).  Most
NCO\'s in the infantry are instructors.  Infantry are equiped with combat
armor and gauss rifles.  Marine infantry is never seen on recruiting
posters.

Ship\'s Troops: Must be qualified for battlesdress training (assumed that
training will occur on the ship if not already trained) or naval gunnery
training. Duties include shipboard gaurd duty (Captains cabin, weapons
lockers, ordinance lockers), boarding actions (customs, military
boardings, and repelling boarders), shore patrol when at ports without
naval bases.  Drop Troops are recruited from the ranks of Ship\'s
Troops.  Equipment is a mix of combat armor and battledress.  Ship\'s
Troops are not seen on recruiting posters except "on liberty in a new
port".

Technical:  These are the mechanics and technicians that keep the marine
equipment working.  This is not a seperate branch, they have to be as
qualified as the troops in the unit they are assigned as there are no
non-combat MOS\'s.  They are equiped as the unit they are assigned to.

Diplomatic Corps:  Some times called the "Spit and Polish Corps" as they
spend as much time in thier dress uniforms as in other uniforms.  They
are trained to expect combat to occur when they are without armor and
with little amunition.  Duties include gaurding embacies, nobles,
admirals, and naval bases, also shore patrol.  The best personal
bodygaurds in the Imperium are drawn from the Marine Diplomatic Corps.
Equipment includes extra dress uniforms, diplomatic cloth armor and side
arms, other equipment as required. Commonly seen on recruiting posters.

Armored:  This is the smallest of the marine units (size as Doug
stated). Equipment cloth armor, side arm and vehicle.

Drop Troops:  The elite of the Marine Corps (minimum rank sargent).
Duties include key instalation attack, initial bridgehead, rapid
response.  Equipment; Battledress and Heavy Weapons.  Commonly seen on
recruiting posters.

Equipment overview:
Marine Infantry:
     Armor; Combat armor 100%
     Weapon; Gauss rifles 80%, other weapons 20%
Ship\'s Troops:
     Armor; Combat armor 50%, Battledress 50%
     Weapon; Gauss rifles 50%, heavy weapons 50%
Technical:
     Armor; as unit assigned
     Weapon; as unit assigned
Diplomatic Corps:
     Armor; Diplomatic cloth 80%, combat armor 20%
     Weapon; side arms and gauss rifles 80%+
Armored:
     Armor; vehicle, cloth armor
     Weapon; side arms
Drop Troops:
     Armor; battlesdress 100%
     Weapon; heavy weapons 100%

equipment will be lighter closer to civilization and heavier towards the
fringes.

On Pg 18 of FT, it says "Jumps longer than two parsecs are only permitted

using a jump-3 route."

My question to the learned members is; does this entirely preclude a Jump-3
Minor route ?  Many ships travelling "behind the claw" are J3 capable, and
it would make sense to me that to a shipper, \'time is money\'.  Ergo, I
would have thought that running a J3 (if possible) would be better than a
circuitous double J2 route.

I\'ve just done the routes fro Pretoria/Deneb and have a J3 Minor Route that
would otherwise follow a J3 Feeder then a J1 Minor to get to the target
world.  I\'m working on other Deneb s/sectors and will post them somewhere
if anyone\'s interested.

Given the fairly generic nature of vehicles, what do people use for
differences between manufacturers or brand names for their manufactured
goods ?  For example, in Australia, we have the co-called \'big-four\' family
cars, each with their own foibles, quirks and selling points, but basically
they\'re a mid-large family car at around $30K.  I would suggest though,
that in Traveller terms, they\'re all essentially the same vehicle.

What do list-folk do about introducing pros and cons, quirks and features
to their goodies to make them appealing to the buying public (PC\'s) ?  Or
are people using no-name brand generic products ?

While I have read your reasoning, I do not agree completely. Maximum

With the number of roles they fill, they had best be as good or better
than the general army sophont. It looks really bad when the embassy

And with those long traditions, they would be appaled at becoming 
nothing more than the men in the armor. That are Imperial Marines 
and could not stand being less than the best. If they lacked skill 
at fighting without their armor, they would rapidly fix that problem.

GURPS lets you design whatever character you want, with any set of skills,
as long as it fits a set point total.  There are also provision (seldom if
ever used in play) for skill atrophy.  You could quite easily say that a
character had been trained in some skill (like battlesuit) but had not used
it in some time and thus had forgotten it and did not have to pay for it. 
If they wanted to relearn it, I\'d give them a great headstart, but
otherwise, the forgotten skill has no cost and no game effect.
 
So the short answer is no, military characters won\'t be burdened with
useless skills, unless they want to keep them at low level for background. 
A GT character will probably have more skills than a CT or MT character, so
tossing a few points into some old skills to reflect previous experience
isn\'t a stupid thing to do.

It isn\'t know if out current set of amino acids is the only usuable
set or if you can get by with some subset (getting left handed ones
is easy since they will tend to come in racemic mixtures).  Nor
is it clear how hard it is to come combinations the form enzymatic
molecules and how many enzymes you need to start up a protobiochemistry.

Such calc can be used to help look at the problem but need to be taken
in context.

Unless they are wired differently than humans, it won\'t work. Humans are
apparently hard wired to become accustomed to anything which is common in
their environment. Humans are hard wired to adapt. Biophysical studies have
shown that persons exposed to lots of violent imagery grow less and less
affected from a biological standpoint by that same type of imagery with
repeated exposures. The exceptions are in cases where some direct physical
stimulus is applied while the imagery is viewed causing pain or discomfort
of a physical nature. In short, unlesss you are made to be violently ill or
in great pain, the more you watch, the less you\'ll feel upon seeing it
again.

The same principle applies in the movie industry to special effects of all
kinds... Which is why hollywood MUST keep pushing the envelope, rather than
sticking at a plateau of graphical quality... if you don\'t keep pushing,
eventually everything becomes "normal"....

hardly true. On both counts. Orbital drops can be handled in at least three
methods: Orbital BD OR COMBAT ARMOR drops (specified that combat armor can
be used in drop capsules in several places, don\'t have books to hand to
cite), Shuttle to HALO Parachute Drops, and shuttle to ground drops.

As far as ship-board, Battle dress is big, bulky, and prevents certain
types of movement, as does combat armor. Additionally, BD INSIDE a ship is
probably not a  good thing... the enhanced strength, excessive mass, and
extremely tough armor make for being able to cause extensive friendly
damage before weapons. Now, on the OUTSIDE, sure, it makes sense.

Besides, Azhanti High Lightning provided canon support for both BD and CES
suited marines aboard a late period imperial cruiser. Striker, MT, and CT
never said all marines are BD trained and equipped, just that the marines
were the primary source of drop troops in BD. Otherwise, all marines would
have had Battle Dress Skill under Mercenary (Bk 4) or MT. Simply put, the
"All marines have BD training" was added in an issue of Traveller Digest
(DGP).

The Imp Marines are obviously NOT the MI of Starship Troopers... they
actually do have shipboard duties (including gun crews, see AHL and
Lightning Class Cruisers). Also, Marines as generated in all editions of
Traveller prior to GT Could and often did wind up with massive combat
skills without being battle dress trained. Likewise, BD is not exclusive to
the Imp Marines... Army, Scout and a couple of others could and did wind up
with the skill under Bks 4,5,6, and MT.

Mind you, IMTU, all marines get BD-0 during basic, and there are large
units using Combat armor, and equal numbers in BD, but even more in CES.
Not counting parade units, units on loan as huscarles, etc. (IMTU, the Duke
of Regina has a regiment of Imp Marines "on loan" as huscarles, in addition
to the 4518th LIR.)

Question to Doug Berry now: Why the change in the ranks titles (established
in canon in CT and MT by the tables in the expanded CGen)?

Um.  I was being sarcastic.

They may in fact be useful to make  starship go.
But they are not useless to anyone who might be _on_ a starship,
since that will inevitably take the character somewhere else.

Apparently only with old merchant crews (or with young naval crews). I
guess merchants have to "earn" the right to be a spacer. Not unlike how our
modern armor crews have to "earn" the right to be tankers ... oops, wrong
thread! ;-P

Nope, *always* kill the guy who can talk to the outside world first.  Once
you\'ve dealt with the problems of artillery fire, air support, and

Remind me to tell you about a character submitted to my PBEM sometime.  
Downright scarey.  This guy wanted to come into the game as a fleet commander 
of a hostile government, *complete* with 200KT ship, and join the rest of the 
party.  Skills out the ass, full tilt blue blood.  Can you say \'over the top\'?

CT & the *other LBBs make definitely playable characters.  And occaisionally, 
I haul out my old copy of \'Scouts and Assassins\' (2nd edition, *NOT* for

I like *playing*.  Reffing is ok.  Just constant rolling of characters can 
get boring.

OK, your \'ship based\' skills keep your boat flying.  Your *non* ship-based 
skills (weapons, Broker, Trader, Admin, Streetwise, etc) are what make and 
protect your money on the ground.  And IIRC, *ANYBODY* could be a steward on 
a ship, doesn\'t take Steward skill, they just screw up people\'s dinner orders 
a lot & the ship\'s laundry breaks down on them.  A *lot*.

Would I pay for a \'utility infielder\' without hard ship skills (Pilot, Nav, 
Engineering, Gunnery)?  Depending on his skills, I might.  Give him Wheeled & 
Grav Vehicle, some decent Admin (2+), and I\'d hire him on the spot to be my 
loadmaster & purser in flight.  He\'d also be the guy I\'d send to town to 
unload my speculative cargo and find the next load to slick out and make a 
cred or 3 on.  Add a Handgun level, and he\'d double as a security officer 
during flight, keep the biofreight from gettin too awful out of hand.

Great idea, actually.

Speaking as one of the guys who helped raise funding for spinal cord injury 
research for 5 years, I can safely say that some of the ideas coming out of 
the PVA labs these days are pretty wild.  That \'ethernet\' idea already came 
up a couple years ago, spurred on by developements in the process of growing 
neurons in silicon chips.  <grin>  Main problems with it at present, as far 
as replacing a chunk of spinal cord goes, anyways, is being able to culture 
enough cloned nerve cells to \'dope\' the chips.  Last I heard of the 
technology, they were about 10% of the way to getting enough nerve density on 
the chips.  Second hardest problem, and the one they expected to solve within 
5-10 years was the software package needed by the computer that would handle 
the signal switching; it needed to be able to \'learn\' which nerve cells had 
grown back in, store that information, and find other pairs to relink.  Best 
WAG on then-current state of the art was, it\'d take up to 5 years to retrain 
the computer to take up 10% of the spinal cord\'s functions.

Hee! Hee! Good one!

That\'s a good one too! You two are real cards! ;->

Keep in mind, both of you, that in CT a party *can* fly a ship with
a crew that doesn\'t have the Pilot, Engineering, or Navigation
skills.  Sure, you *want* skilled people, but computer programs can
be substituted for some of these tasks and anyone can try almost
anything with appropriate -DM\'s.  It makes it tougher to perform
risky tasks, but the routine things are still pretty routine.

To answer Chris\' point, *if* I had people with ship skills I\'d
certainly put them in those positions.  The PC in question could
still do productive work, though, as Steward, Medic, Gunner (you
hope you never actually *need* him, but regs require one to be
aboard), Cargohandler, and a swing-man to relieve the more skilled
PC\'s on the ship.  He could *train* for a skilled position and he
would have uses on-planet (where most adventures take place).  No,
you wouldn\'t want *all* your PC\'s to be like this guy, but it\'s
unlikely they all would be.

Thanks a lot Steve! I have been hoping that someone with a better grasp
than myself would come along and confirm or deny. I didn\'t realize that 
such a small amount of acceleration would be needed though.

You seem to confirm my uninformed opinion of this though - if the week 
that a jump takes is measured in _system_ time, there isn\'t much you
can do to time travel, but if the week is measured in _ship_ time,
you can break it a lot easier than I thought!

Well, its not that original, but I promise I didn\'t steal it from anywhere

A couple of years ago, I was speculating on military branch common
insults/nicknames.  "I\'rine" for "Imperial maRINE" was a natural since
it sounds just like "GI\'rine" (G.I. maRINE), a term I\'ve heard once or
twice for USMC.

Yes, however, are they to be considered police actions and peace-keeping as
we know them today? I haven\'t taken a look at the Imperial rules of war
recently, so I may be a little off base.

The line I\'m really interested in is "enforcing the Imperial rules of war."
I seem to recall that most of the Imperial rules of war the Marines might be
called in to enforce is the use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.
In other words, weapons of mass destruction. Somehow I don\'t think the
marines are going to go deal with this with kevlar vests, assault rifles and
blue helmets with a big white Imperial starburst on them ;)

The same thing with peace-keeping. Forces. Is it peace-keeping in the modern
sense or a sort of efficient Imperial peace-keeping.

Do the marines get down on the ground in white grav-APCs and blue combat
armor with big, white Imperial Starbursts emblazoned on their heads and
wedge themselves between combatants to keep the peace? Or do they say:
"Start blowing each other up again, and we send the marines down with a
six-pack of whoopass."

It\'s a tough question. Imperial forces answer to the emperor. The emperor
only has to worry if the moot strongly disagrees with him... I think that,
especially with the Vilani mindset, peace-keeping will be of the second
sort, not the first. It\'s the most efficient use of materials and training,
both of which are expensive.

I would tend to think that whenever the Imperial Marines are used, the
situation heats up to full-blown combat if it hasn\'t already.

Heheheheheh...

Not so much bitter, I just realised I was thinking from another point of
view.  I do use other game products as resources and  have even used GURPS
for fantasy, just never played the rules or any of their worlds/backgrounds,
just adapted what I needed.

I also didn\'t play every single Traveller rule as "gospel" either, took my
slant on various things also.  I really don\'t mind what rules are made
GT-canon, but something\'s CT-canon work well for game plots which I like
(handwaves or no, they do assist in making plots work), like marines not
being forced into BD all of the time.

But as established, it is CT-canon that IM\'s were issued BD, but nothing
mentions they have to be fielded all the time with it, so I\'m happy :^)

Well, like my son used to read GI-Joe, how they always had the biggest and
badest stuff at their disposal, sounds very similar.  Like the current
generation of comics he likes to read, where everything is available and
almost common to the characters.  You know, that sort of thing.

Yes I did, and I also stated that because you are issued with something does
not mean you always use it.  I don\'t see an IM in a pair of issued jocks,
singlet, dress uniform under fatigues under urban cam under desert cam under
jungle cam under his BD.  Mission specifics tend to state what a troopie
takes into the field.  If a mission specific says don\'t take BD, then I\'m
sure the marine won\'t take BD?  What\'s hard to work out about that?  I was
issued a rifle but never had to carry it about all the time.  Sometimes I
even had to carry a GPMG or a SMG instead, even though my rifle was
officially issued to me, it was on occassion exchanged for other weapons.

Now from your military experience, were you lumped with only one piece of
equipment all the time or did you to find you had to swap?  Or is the
Australian army the only one that does this?

I don\'t think my traveller universe is canon, I am saying that CT is, oh, I
don\'t know... more canon than GT?  I did bow to the CT canon about the
maines in the JTAS article, but I\'m also saying that just because you are
issued a piece of equipment, doesn\'t mean you are compled by every situation
to use it.  But again, I draw from history/real life.  BD is kit, you don\'t
have dress BD (but then again you might), you don\'t have KP-BD or mess-BD...
you have it, but the situation does not demand you use it.  Certain actions
are like that.

That\'s the part where when you roll your character, he still performs raids,
CI\'s, PA\'s, etc., yet doesn\'t seem to roll a single BD skill or even a
vacc-suit skill... Not all marines get the skill.  In my opinion, it is not
a gimme as it is going to be in GT, thus you have to work to earn the
skill... don\'t work hard enough and you don\'t get the skill (it\'s like an
abstract interpretation of an abstract rule if you will, like puting in
words other than "unlucky enough not to roll it").

I am not saying that if a marine had the chance to don BD for a combat
situation, he wouldn\'t, one always equips oneself to the highest standard
when one has a choice.  What I am trying to say is, that a marine would
probably be put into certain combat situations where he was not permitted to
use his issued BD.  I see the IM\'s as a flexible arm of the military able to
perform to a high standard regardless of what situation and equipment is
present.  I do not see a marine as being less capable than an infantry grunt
out of his suit.

Marines by (any canon) tradition I imagine, are more proud and capable than
a standard infantryman.  No that of course is just my take on it remember.
Pilots are considered elite in their own right, and you are relegating
marines to the same status as a pilot.  A pilot is still a fighting man, but
not a "fighting man" if you know what I mean.  Your take is making a marine
a pilot type fighting man, not a blood and guts, in amongst the thick of it,
smell the enemy\'s urine as he dies kind of fighting man that I thought most
players imaged an IM to be... he is now a pilot of a suit.  Sure, he\'s still
in the think of it, but take away his suit and he has little training to
survive on a battle field.

What I do agree with is, that a hit bad enough to "take out" a suit of BD
must surely have an effect on the wearer due to his proximity to the suit
(how much room is in a suit anyway?), so I guess the wearer would get hurt
when the suit goes down... whether that fact causes CP if the trooper
survives is pertinent.  However, the loss of a suit on the battlefield could
also be the simple putting out of action of the BD by a near miss ("Damn!
Systems just went down... I\'m a sitting gbud here!  I\'m bailing!!), where
the wearer ejects from the suit and where capable, is still a fit and
fighting ground trooper acting in no fashion different from a regular
infantry man.

Obviously, it\'s okay by me and probably everyone else, if your marine is a
pilot-type fighting man, but I don\'t think it should be forced upon every
other player by a resource book that they have to have pilot-type fighting
men too.  If this is not the case (that the resource book is not forcing all
IM\'s into suits for ALL actions), then I hope it will reflect the fact
somewhere in the text that some actions do not require them to be marine
pilots of suits, by suits not being required in all combat situations.

I have taken up far to much bandwidth and to much of your time with this
issue.  I am sorry for that, but I see indications that the majority of
posters do not want to see IM\'s BD-bound.

Thanks Chris, I certainly won\'t argue with that, but I do have to mention
that even though a troopie is issued with a piece of equipment, they don\'t
always use that equipment everytime due to mission directives.  I was issued
an SLR, but often found myself lumped with an M60 or an F1.  I still
personally see BD as another suit, like jungle greens/cam, dress uniform,
etc. which they are issued with, they wear them on respective occassions and
not all combat actions would require the expense of wearing BD?

It paints a rather amusing picture of IM catering Corp personnel making
brekkie or peeling spuds in a field kitchen in full BD!  Not to mention
admin just behind the lines... computer keyboards must have 3" square keys!

I recall something along these lines too, that a high enough vacc-suit skill
allowed you to use any environmental suit, including BD at a lower
standard(?),  I don\'t recall the reverse being the effect though?  If BD was
a "super vacc-suit" I\'d imagine you could automatically posses vacc-suit
skill, but it never worked that way from the rules I remember?

Well, I\'m an Aussie who also had family fight against the Japanese.  I don\'t
think this is so much "revisionism" as more a fact that documents actually
came to light suggesting the military planners kept Truman in the dark (I
can\'t think for some reason... to lazy to get the books out... it was Truman
at that time wasn\'t it?) because they WANTED the two bombs to be dropped and
tested while public opinion was still on their side.

I too, feel the bombs had to be dropped... but for very different reasons.
It has changed the way people think for better or worse.

  FWIW, if an example could be made of a WW I UK infantry unit known for its

had little or no combat experience, and yet if the Boer War had been only a

  "Achtung! Panzer!" was published in 1937; you\'re probably thinking of

My own reading suggests that Steven is right:  they use no genetic
engineering techniques more advanced than breeding/eugenics.  Motie
generations are very short, especially among the smaller forms (like
Watchmakers); presumably, the Masters simply bred their subjects for the
desired qualities until they got Warriors, or Doctors, or whatever caste
they wanted to create.

The real reason that trying to invent some sort of birth control method
(whether surgical, chemical, geneering, what have you) doesn\'t work is that
the Moties have no central government.  If one Master\'s subjects stop
breeding, eventually the others outnumber him and wipe him out so they can
take his land.  Population pressure leads to total ruthlessness.  (Niven
uses a similar theme in his description of the constant warring between Pak
protectors to gain living space for their bloodlines.)

So unless someone has the ability to IMPOSE a solution on the entire Motie
population at once, it won\'t work.  Cue the sequel...

Doug, he say, many digests past while I was sleeping: "The rational is that
no matter how many roles they serve unarmored, when heavy combat comes up
Marines suit up."

How come then in "The Kinunir" only 1/3 of the ships troops are equipped
with BD and PGMP-13\'s?They\'re the jump troopers who get bunged in capsules
and dropped on the unsuspecting. The other 2/3 are a Vacc Suited boarding
unit and a unit of motorised infantry.

Loads of people seem to be assuming that BD makes you invulnerable to small
arms fire. What a load of cock. A Gaus Rifle, ACR or Autorifle with a
moderately competent user breaks through often enough to make most people
wearing BD dive for cover. AHL and Striker made it a bit better, but even
then there\'s a fair chance of injuring someone in BD with the slug throwing
small arms.

So, if GURPS Traveller is giving BD a massive PD and DR, IMO it aint right
and someone ought to change it.

Another thing... The Quote of Loren the Wise "All marines are equipped with
battle dress, and are armed with FGMP-14s." If the Marines are all equipped
to TL 14 - 15, how do they get on in the Regina subsector (highest TL was 13
in 1105)? Presumably the marines there use TL 13 gear (as in "The Kinunir")
so they can get it fixed locally. (Side issue: Do the Imperial Navy and
Scouts also have some lower tech gear so they can get it fixed on more
worlds?)

Finally, the Roc says: "It paints a rather amusing picture of IM catering

Not at all - ever tried lifting a 40 pot of porridge for a platoon without
BD on?

When generating a group a player characters, my usual preference is
to have an ex-Navy pilot out of flight school with pilot 3 or 4 and
just use the owner/captain\'s pilot 1 as a backup.

The same goes for most of the other technical ship skills, so it
seems reasonable to me.

Let the armed forces provide the technical training which they
seem good at, and the merchants provide the people whose career
ambition was to make money.

IIRC, things improved with book 7 and megacorp engineering branches - 
finally organisations who can afford training in the technical stuff.

A large body of literature exists describing ways of building plausible
worlds. When it comes to \'critters\' one is left a little more to one\'s
own devices.

The purpose of this series of articles is to consider relevant aspects
of biology, (bio)chemistry, physics, physiology and ecology in order to
flesh out game statistics.

[The rules presented in the various incarnations of Traveller and some
other RPGs (I haven\'t sighted a copy of \'GURPS Bestiary\' or \'Uplift\')
present a good starting point for creating creature encounters
(approximate ecological niche, size, speed, armour, health, damage
capacity, etc.)]
	
* Definition of life
For the purposes of this discussion, \'living things\' are those systems
which :-
 - are capable (to varying extents) of growth, self-repair and
reproduction ;
 - require various energetic and chemical inputs to enable these
processes.

These criteria get blurry at both ends of the size scale : is a prion
\'alive\'? a single enzyme? an ecosystem? a biosphere?

Leaving this philosophical problem aside, let us begin.

* Prequisites
Three basic conditions seem to be necessary to the development of life.
 - Building blocks ;
 - Energy ; and 
 - Solvents

1. Building blocks
Appropriate elements need to be present for anything to happen at all.

Cosmic abundance of the first thirty elements :-
Hydrogen	1		Chromium	9 X 10^(-7)
Helium		0.25		Manganese	5 X 10^(-7)
Oxygen	        10^(-4)	        Phosphorus	2 X 10^(-7)
Carbon----		Chlorine	"
Neon            |		Potassium	10^(-7)
Magnesium	~5 X 10^(-5)	Titanium	9 X 10^(-8)
Silicon         |		Cobalt		7 X 10^(-8)
Iron----		Fluorine	5 X 10^(-8)
Sulphur	        2 X 10^(-5)	Zinc		"
Nitrogen	7.5 X 10^(-6)	Copper		2 X 10^(-8)
Nickel		"		Vanadium	10^(-8)
Aluminium	5 X 10^(-6)	Boron		5 X 10^(-9)
Sodium	        2 X 10^(-6)	Scandium	10^(-9)
Calcium	        "		Beryllium	10^(-10)
Argon		10^(-6)	        Lithium	        10^(-11)

Heavier elements are RARE.

In the 1960s, Urey and Miller demonstrated that the four basic classes
of terrestrial \'biological molecules\', (amino acids, fats, sugars and
nucleotides) could be generated from a mixture of water, methane (CH4),
ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen subjected to electricity.

Carbon provides a skeleton on which complex compounds can be built ; it
is tetravalent and forms strong stable covalent bonds (electron sharing)
with other elements.

Oxygen is a highly reactive chemical which permits the development of
polar species.
Its higher affinity for electrons leads to localised negative charge
around the oxygen atom - the donor becomes relatively positively
charged. Water molecules are a good example :-
        H d+
        /
    d- O            [approximately, allowing for text-only messages]
        \\           [d+ and d- represent weak but significant charges]
        H d+

Nitrogen can form a wide variety of compounds with the other elements ;
ammonia is an important solvent.

Are there any other candidate elements for the \'short list of building
blocks\'?

Silicon : like carbon, it is tetravalent and therefore has the potential
to form complex structures.
	However, silicon has a larger covalent radius (bigger atoms!) and
therefore compounds with pure silicon backbones e.g. the silanes
(SiH4, Si2H6, etc.) are not as stable as their carbon analogues.
	In fact silanes larger than SiH4 decompose explosively in water and
oxygen ; they may be more stable in less polar solvent systems or
at extremely low temperatures, neither of which are conducive to the
development of the complex chemical systems we are looking for.
	Silicones (chains of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms) are
very stable and represent a viable (but unusual) alternative to carbon
as a foundation material.
[Silicates - silicon oxides - comprise much of the mass of rocky
bodies!]

Boron : It has a similar covalent radius to carbon, so compounds are
likely to be more stable. Being trivalent, it can replace nitrogen in
most carbon compounds. Like silicon, boron hydrides (B2H6, etc.) react
vigorously with water and oxygen.

Other elements reflect the metals and salts present in the primordial
solvent. The following elements are also present in varying proportions
in terrestrial life (in no particular order) :-

Chlorine, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, selenium, iodine, sodium,
potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, copper, cobalt, manganese,
molybdenum, and vanadium.

Many of the metallic elements listed above have catalytic functions.
The non-metals could be important in the formation of solvents and
metabolic pathways.

2. Energy
The Second Law of Thermodynamics implies that a chemical system will
tend to move towards the lowest energy state. Living things rely on
energy from outside to maintain internal complexity and order.
	The most important source (at least for surface-based life) is from the
star(s) the planet orbits.
	The solar constant is ~1353W per square metre at one AU (150
million km) ; it varies inversely with the square of the distance from
the primary, directly with luminosity, and is attenuated by the
atmosphere, depending on its composition (roughly inversely with
atmospheric pressure/density ; the maximum energy (100% efficiency)
obtainable on the ground on Earth is 956W per square metre).
	Internal heat, from the decay of radioisotopes in the mantle and
core regions of metallic and rocky worlds (in First In terms,
non-rockballs) leads to familiar phenomena such as plate tectonics and
vulcanism. As recently demonstrated, the deep ocean vents allow the
development of a vigorous ecosystem in the vicinity of the plume.  
	Satellites of gas giants develop a significant amount of internal heat
from tidal effects driven by their primary.
Io is a good example of this. Europa may have large bodies of liquid
water beneath its icy exterior.

Other compounds may be present that make important reactions more likely
to happen (catalysts). The required activation energy may be reduced by
the presence of intermediary electron donors (e.g. metals and metal
ions) or a substrate which allows compounds to interact more readily
(e.g. clays, porous rocks, etc.) 

3. Solvents
Chemical reactions need an appropriate medium to take place in.
Solvents need to have certain properties for our purposes.
	They should be composed of common elements from the list above.
	They should be liquid across a wide temperature range - this increases
the probability of life processes starting in them in the
first place.
	They need to be relatively polar to encourage the dissociation of salts
into their constituent ions ; this facilitates the transfer of
electrons and thus enables the development of potential differences.
This becomes important in a wide variety of cellular functions (to be
discussed in a later post).

Some candidate solvents :-

Solvent	        Formula	  Melting Point	  Boiling Point	  Dipole moment
* Water		H2O		0		100		6.2
* Hydrogen	H2O2		-0.4		158		7.3

Melting and boiling points are in degrees Celsius ; boiling points
assume one atmosphere (101 kPa, 14.5psi or 760mm mercury/Torr) ambient
pressure.
Dipole moment is a measure of molecular polarity and is expressed in
units of 10^(-30) coulomb metres. Salts are obviously much more polar ;
for example sodium chloride has a dipole moment of 30. 

The two most likely compounds are water and ammonia, on the basis of
cosmic abundance and their intermediate reactivity, but the others are
certainly plausible.

* Likely Worlds (using G:T \'First In\')
Given the criteria above :-
i. Surface based life requires an atmosphere to prevent important
chemicals from boiling off into space.
ii. Underground life requires active geology or tidal heating.

There is an enormous degree of latitude possible with (underground)
life, especially considering more exotic solvents of freezing points of
- -100 degrees Celsius or lower!
	This gives us plenty of world types to play with. 
In fact almost any world could support some sort of subsurface microbial
life, given the right chemistry.

Worlds with surface liquid are much more likely to be life bearing.
This liquid will be the solvent system in which life arises, on balance
of probabilities.

* What? No cryogenic creatures or plasma beings?
I have ignored the possibility of creatures that function at extremes
of temperature for the following reasons :-
	Reaction rates will either be very slow or terribly fast depending on
which end of the scale is being considered.
	The other problems with high temperatures are that very few compounds
remain stable ; certainly complex molecules are unlikely to survive.
Their formation in any case is problematic as there is plenty
 of energy available but not enough time for reactants to stick
together. 
	Low-temperature creatures (superconducting nervous systems?)
need highly concentrated building blocks in order to happen at all
(again, consider the composition of typical superconductors).
	In summary : high/low temperature = high/low energy = low probability
of establishing the necessary level of order. 
 	
* Aside : Eutectic mixtures and temperature ranges :-
A eutectic mixture is one whose melting point is lower than any of
its ingredients.
	This effect is a consequence of freezing point depression - one of the
colligative properties of a solution. (Those properties depending on the
amount of substance dissolved in a solvent rather than the identity of
the solute - the others are boiling point elevation, vapour pressure
depression and osmotic pressure).
	An example of freezing point depression : water\'s freezing point
 can be depressed by 1.86 degrees C per mole of substance added per
 kilogram of water.
	Ammonia has a solubility of 480g ammonia per kilogram of water
 at 25 degrees C. The mass of one mole of ammonia is 17g (NH3) - so 480g
 is 28.2 moles. The freezing point of our saturated ammonia-water
 solution is roughly -50 degrees Celsius!

"Fully qualified" means someone you would trust to fly a
starship, lead a platoon in combat, fix your groundcar etc.
Personally I would rate this as 2-3 years of experience,
based on software teams I\'ve led, and that stacks up quite
well with CT.

Depending on whether you use Books 4/5 and the Instruction

an expertise level. Taking the doctor as a yardstick, level 3
[GT skill level 15] represents probably four years of

Because that\'s how the Navy decided the Marine complement of the class

Why?  You can build powerful Battledress using Vehicles, and why shouldn\'t
the Marines and select Army troops have the best?  You can take a shot at
the vision slit (-9 to hit), or use a heavy weapon, but the whole idea is
that the battledress equipped trooper is going to be something as
terrifying to normal infantry as a King Tiger was on the Western Front.

We took our TL-8 Marines and soldiers to Somalia, and they didn\'t suddenly
become TL-5.  The Navy and Marines train and equip at the Imperial standard
level.  They carry spares and have those nice Navy bases.

Acorrding to FFW, there are many Army units from TL-11 to 14.  Only the
Marines are exclusively TL-15.

You know, I did KP when I was in the Army.  Even though I was infantry, I
didn\'t do it in steel pot, full camo, while carrying an M-16.

No, not the characters, but the Marines.  There is an important difference.  

The book this proposal is for is the sourcebook to the *active duty*
Imperial ground troops.  Not the retired, ex-Marines you see running around
Free traders.  So the TO&Es and skill templates are going to reflect the
needs of the Imperial will.

If you design a Marine, he *will* know how to use Battledress.  It\'s a
required skill in the template.  If you decide the rest of his career was
spent as a file clerk at a logistical dump, then his skills will reflect
that choice.  But someday, he might find himself in a position to use the
half-forgotten skill.

Two reasons:

1.  I don\'t really think that rank titles are going to freeze for the next
few millennia when the rank structure it was based on has already changed
twice since the publication of Mercenary.

2. I like mine better.

        LOL!

        Seriously, I have preided over two types of gunfights, in general,
in my Traveller games.  The first was "Rogue Prince" game where SMG-2 was
the *meanest* weapon skill anyone had....  Body-pistol-1 was the norm.  More
than one gunfight looked like Storm Troopers vs Rebel Soldiers with two
sides of five or six blasting away at each other....
        ....And only making a real mess out of each other\'s clothes in the
first *minute*, since they were all wearing balistic cloth underneath.

        The other was a CAT Squad (Counter, Actively, Terrorism) game, where
Fusion Pistol -2 was standard for the Home Team and one-shot kills were the
norm and the sniper had Laser Rifle-5.

        It really depends on what type of game you are running and how
important the fight scenes are.

Friends,

Over the weekend someone brought up the Yahoo/Geocities merger and the new,
revised Terms of Service.  Simply put, if you have any sites hosted by
Yahoo/Geocities, you risk loosing control and ownership of the content and
materials on your site, even if it is copywritten or trademarked.

Here is a link to an article that goes into detail regarding the situation.
 You may need to cut and paste it into your browser as it is a bit long.

http://technews.netscape.com/computing/technews/newsitem/0,290,38463,00.html
?pt.netscape.fd.hl.ne

Here is the relevant portion of the Yahoo/Geocities TOS that states the
changes:

>8. CONTENT SUBMITTED TO YAHOO
>
>By submitting Content to any Yahoo property, you automatically grant, or 
>warrant that the owner of such Content has expressly granted, Yahoo the 
>royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable 
>right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, 
>create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Content 
>(in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any 
>form, media, or technology now known or later developed. You acknowledge 
>that Yahoo does not pre-screen Content, but that Yahoo and its designees 
>shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to

>acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Yahoo or 
>submitted to Yahoo, including without limitation information in Yahoo! 
>Message Boards, Yahoo! Clubs, and in all other parts of the Service. 

Note:  If you sign in using the new TOS, you will unfortuantely be bound by
them.

Free sites are nice, but now they are nice if you have nothing to loose.
Most of the larger free site hosts have similar or comprable Terms of
Service, so please re-read them and if you have any questions, either
contact the Host\'s help desk or pull your site and host it with your ISP or
with a pay for use site.

One way to keep the the canon-cockers happy would be to mention that
these rank titles are part of a post-FFW reform and reorganization.

Come to think of it, that would work to explain your increased emphasis
on BD training and use by the IM.

MT Imperial Encyclopedia, p. 28:

"The main aim of the rules was maintaining the economic and military
well-being of the realm. They gave the Imperium the right to intervene only
when local military action threatened this well-being. The primary causes
of instability, as viewed by Imperial analysts, have been long-term
economic dislocation and excessive extraplanetary influence:
"A. Long-term social or economic dislocation is suffered when a region
loses its ability to cary on at its pre-war level of economic activity.
"B. Excessive extraplanetary influence is even more vague. Historically,
the Imperium has tolerated the use of force as a necessary outlet for
built-up political and social pressures. In such cases, a short war is
deemed preferable to continuing tension, sabotage, political agitation,
etc. However, attempts by extraplanetary forces, such as offworld
governments or large commercial interests, to seize control of a world\'s
affairs are beyond the scope of the "safety valve" rationale....
"Unlike the above rules, one prohibition is clear and firm throughout the
Imperium: use or possession of nuclear weapons, if discovered, and
regardless of size or type."

So there are a whole range of actions that could trigger Imperial
intervention. Use or possessions of WMD\'s is simply the only automatic one.

Only if the threat is believed. Somewhere, sometime, there will be some
jerkwater dictator/corporate climber (Burke) who doesn\'t believe the
Imperium has the will or the skill to stop him from doing whatever he wants
(sound familiar, anyone?). At that point, the question becomes, how do I
employ all these lovely battledress-equipped Marines without doing more
damage than good? If you can\'t do this reasonably well, your threat loses
its credibility with everyone else. 
Shooting wars are easy: both sides line up, wear uniforms to identify who
is on which side, and duke it out in the open. Anything less than a
full-blown war is hard, especially when some of the "combatants" are
civilians or part-timers. Vietnam is not the only war in recent memory
where just finding "the Enemy" was one of the most difficult parts of the
entire operation.

Now picture the mission and intent the Marine Task Force CO has just been
handed (probably by the IN fleet or squadron commander, as the senior
Imperial official present):

"On order, deploy your task force to and occupy planet Quagmire to
establish Imperial presence. Secure the starport and consulate in order to
protect Imperial interests and create a beachhead for further
reinforcement; garrison forces are attached to you upon linkup. Clear
belligerents from Quagmire City and a 10km radius around it in order to
restore security and stability. Be prepared to clear and maintain a zone up
to 100 km in radius.

"I want you to use surprise and overwhelming combat power to shock the
belligerents into inaction, then exploit your momentum to seize the
initiative from both sides and establish a new status quo with you in
charge. At the end of the operation, your task force has secured the
starport and the consulate, you have put an end to all active hostilities
within Quagmire City and the 10km buffer zone, and there has been minimal
collateral damage to the city and its inhabitants."

That\'s actually pretty clear cut, and even so it begs the question of how
he\'s supposed to know a "belligerent" if they aren\'t actively shooting. Are
the corps on-planet involved ("excessive planetary influence") or are they
entitled to protection ("Imperial interests")? What is "security and
stability", and how does he know when it\'s achieved? 

More likely, the usual op order consists of "Get in there, and stop the
fighting!"

>I would tend to think that whenever the Imperial Marines are used, the
>situation heats up to full-blown combat if it hasn\'t already.

My point is that this makes them an extremely blunt instrument; you might
just as well nuke \'em from orbit instead. 

As the proverb would have it, "Fighting for peace is like copulating for
virginity." Somewhere along the line, you have to employ carefully
modulated and focused violence against just those elements who are still
causing problems in an otherwise innocent population, one that you have
been sent in to protect. This requires extensive human intelligence and
face-to-face contacts. It requires TRUST, not only for the locals to give
the Marines the information they need to carry out the mission, but for
them to accept that the solution the Marines offer is a better alternative
than continuing to fight each other (or the Marines). 

I\'m having a hard time imagining how faceless battlesuited stormtroopers
are going to get to this level of trust, or how (as you say) they can avoid
becoming a provocation to total warfare. Certainly, if "the Marines have
landed" is automatically equivalent to "everything you care about will be
destroyed, whether you had any part in this conflict or not", they are not
going to get much cooperation.

"Peace-keeping" cannot mean "Kill them all, and God shall know his own," if
the Imperium is to survive.

platoon on Kinunir class ships.

"Because that\'s how the Navy decided the Marine complement of the class

I was only 12 or 13 when I saw "The Kinunir," so I didn\'t have the benefit
of Sir\'s intense wisdom about what was right and what was wrong about the
ship design. Having said that, it\'s the oldest example I\'ve seen in print of
a Marine platoon: Only 1/3 wearing BD: It\'s a de-facto standard. Saying "All
marines wear BD and use FMGP-14s" goes against that standard.

I mentioned that BD is not as rock hard as various peoples implication: Doug
replied that using (I assume GURPS)vehicles that you can build something
that is. He goes on:

"...but the whole idea is that the battledress equipped trooper is going to
be something as terrifying to normal infantry as a King Tiger was on the
Western Front."

Sorry old son, but it patently isn\'t that scary. AFAIK taking out a Tiger
Tank with a small arm is an exercise in futility, not the chance a character
with a Gaus rifle gets shooting at someone in Battle Dress gets. What I\'d
hate to see is one weekend we play in a universe where a burst of Gaus rifle
fire has a fair chance of taking out a man in TL 13 BD (using Book 1 / AHL
or Striker) and the next weekend we have the situation where the same weapon
in the hands of a comparable character won\'t stand a chance (using GURPS).

That\'s interesting. Traveller always gave me the impression that there was

I don\'t recall anything in any of my Traveller sources that years
divisible by 4000 are not leap years... do you have a reference?

There is a Perpetual Calendar on the Web at
	http://www.wiskit.com/calendar.html
which can give you the month\'s calendar for any month from 0001 to 9999.
According to that calendar, 4531 01 09 is a Tuesday.

However if in YTU, 4000 was not a leap year, 4531 01 09 is a Monday.

Needless to say, I have the above website bookmarked. Comes in handy
for campaigns set in the future and/or involving Time Travel...

Wha!?!? You\'re claiming that you don\'t need *people* to fly a starship? You
can just use these new fangled... what\'s your word for them? com-PYOO-ter
programs?

Poppycock!

Everyone knows that *people* fly starships, not these new-fangled
com-PYOO-ter programs. After all, if we begin to rely on these <hrmph>
machines, what happens if someone... say, finds a silicon based lifeform and
manages to (as improbable as it may sound) turn it into some sort of
high-tech weapon. A *disease* of computers, roughly analagous to... hmmm...
I think virus is the term your race of savages uses for such a concept.
Fortunately, we were never burdened by such nastiness on Vland. Heh. We
don\'t even have a term for them in our language!

So, if this <ahem> Virus were to break loose, it would mean the very end of
the Third Imperium! Bah! Not worth the risk, after all, who knows what sort
of *miscreants* would band together afterwards? Without the Imperium, just
about anybody could claim that the stars were their birthright...

Hmmm... Wait just a second. If such a thing happened, then the Three Bureaux
would be untouched, since after all, we still do our *own* long division on
our starships. I\'m proud to say that we don\'t even use those infernal
calc-YOO-lay-tors! If the Three Bureaux were untouched... yes! Now I see it!
A new Ziru Sirka might rise like... like... one of your Phoenixes, from the
ashes of Cleon\'s...

<ahem>

Yes, yes... I\'m all for it.

Pardon me. It\'s too early and I haven\'t had enough caffeine. Eris, you do
know that you are appealling to the dark side of my Traveller upbringing by
simply mentioning the concept of automation? You heretics are shameless.

I digress. I took myself entirely too seriously. My apologies for such an
outburst. It\'s these damnable machines. Communication occurs so quickly.
It\'s not something I\'m used to. I prefer the traditional Vilani art of
writing, but I wouldn\'t expect you Solomani types to understand such things.
You just can\'t see the inherent value in tradition. ;)

You do remember that we were zipping around the stars while you people were
mucking about building stone fortresses and such, right?

Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I must dim the lights and put some clothes into
the drying-machine. You look puzzled? Ah, that\'s understandable... You
Solomani wouldn\'t know about such things as the fine, age-old tradition of
Dryer Dimming. You see, when your kind were traipsing around in caves
sticking sharp pointy things into animals, we invented this device to dry
our freshly washed clothes. Thanks to our grand technological advancements,
we Vilani were always at a loss for power. We had to turn down the lights,
just a bit mind you, in order to make sure there was enough energy. Funny
thing, though, I could have sworn Marc said he\'d be sure to put Dryer
Dimming in as library data.

<hrmph> As I previously stated, you Solomani have no respect at all for
tradition.

Alright. Alright. I\'ll go back to my cage now.

The Science & the Citizen article "Mutations Galore" in the 04/99 issue of
Scientific American supported this theory.
http://www.sciam.com/1999/0499issue/0499scicit4.html

Basically they determined that humans have a scarily high mutation rate and
theorized that sexual reproduction has allowed us to select out the bad
genes and reduce the overall fatality through mutation rate.  If this is
true all the modern work on fertility therapy should have an even worse
effect on the gene pool than I have long thought.

the 04/99 issue also has some good articles on tissue engineering and an
article called "Is Space Finite?"
(http://www.sciam.com/1999/0499issue/0499weeks.html) that talks about the
possibility that the universe isn\'t as vast as it appears.

It does not preclude a J-3 Minor route.  In fact, there\'s a "canonical"
example in the District 268 route map on pg.125 of FT.  (That map has lots 
of other things wrong with it.  For some reason it was significantly changed 
from the accurate map I submitted.)  In the text it says the route is 
maintained for "political purposes" by Trexalon.

The reason J-3 minor routes do not generally occur is that they are not 
economic for through traffic.  J-3 ships are slightly more expensive on a 
dton-freight/parsec basis than J-2 ships.  Since astrography generally makes 
J-2 the most convenient J-3 ships are somewhat specialized.  While the J-3 
ship would save money on the one J-3 hop of a multi-jump journey, it would 
*lose* money on all the other jumps.  

Some J-3 minor routes make sense and some don\'t.  Where there is enough 
traffic originating and terminating in a pair of worlds 3pc apart, feel free 
to have a J-3 minor route.  The rules in FT regarding route placement are, 
by necessity, somewhat abstracted.  The only really accurate way of doing it 
would be to take the roll of a megacorp, local line, and free trader and see 
how these economicly rational actors would behave in a given situation and 
then make route decisions based on the results of this simulation.

Just please be sure you note in the accompanying documentation where you 
depart from the strict guidelines on things like J-3 minor routes.  That\'s 
what I did in making special notice of the J-3 route from Trexalon to Kwai 
Ching.

Never been on a Tokyo subway, but I assume they are too crowded to fix a jump
drive in. ;)
I do see free traders as more like submarines than the Millenium Falcon. Crowded,
bare, and perhaps a little stinky at times. T he Falcon has a crew of two, is
very clean, has nice walls, lights, etc. I don\'t see two people being all you
need to run an intersteller vessel.

Anybody can perform many of the skills listed, exceptions being perhaps
Battledress and other such skills. A score of one in Traveller(CT at least) means
a hell of a lot. Scores are hardly ever above four. Traveller is very grainy in
rating things like attributes, skills, planetary population, etc.

Same here. If he is just handling paperwork and not actually buying and selling,
I\'ll hire at Admin 1 even, as long as he has a couple more interesting skills
(recruit comes to mind)

Yeeeooooowwwwww!!

Goodnight copyright.  Thats giving the farm away, lock, stock and barrel.
It looks like the intention is to allow them the ability to remove troublesome
content from their webservers, potentially a prudent move given liability
laws that \'could\' make them liable for content of those who publish on their
with them.  But they couldn\'t do that without taking total control.  So
what might have been originally intended as a legal move to protect the
company, ends up being a wholesale transfer of copyrights.


Essentially, they\'re saying that their servers are like chalkboard in
public.  You can write what you want, but its their chalkboard,
and they can take, sell, edit, destroy, copy, etc., anything that
appears on their chalkboard.  You post anything at all, and you\'re
giving it away.  Well, at least the issue is known.  I\'d doubt they\'d
ever actual touch anything you post.  But they want the full arsenal
available in case there ever is a problem.

I have to agree with Mr. Berry on much of what he wrote.  IMTU the IM are
THE toughest bunch around, and are the only ground force that acts as the
will of the emperor.

What we all need to remember is that in the 1100\'s the imperium is big.
very big.  REALLY REALLY BIG.  SUPER SIZED BIG.  For any small action the
local forces, rulers, nobles, etc... will have many many many options.
Mercs, local forces, army units, scouts, noble troops, starport secforces,
etc...  enough people running around with guns to scare anyone from doing
something wrong.  However, when the s**t hits the fan, you need something
that will shock the entire sector into recognizing that the imperium has the
final word on any dispute.  When the I\'renes (and to whom ever came up with
this term, good job)hit, little is left standing.  It is not important who
was right or wrong, only that the Emperor has decided to make a statement.
The only way for a very small force in the very big imperium to make that
much of a statement is with overwhelming force with something unique.

I see that the I\'renes are the only force in the imperium to be equipped
100% uniform.  EVERY unit has the same equipment.  And that includes BD. And
just like every marine today is trained with a rifle, so is every IM trained
with BD.

Here is a little sample from my battledress rules.  Please understand that
99% of my games never have BD in them.  It would be like seeing an M1
today...  You may see one on the news once and awhile, or if you go on to a
base, but never around town. I hoppled these rules together from several
sources for some players that wanted to try out BD in the game.  What they
found out was that unless you come in with a completely integrated force
structure, with support, a well equipped army can defeat you...  just having
a couple of suits was not enough. But that is another story.

BATTLEDRESS DATA
OVERVIEW:
Battledress is a full coverage exoskeleton with its own power supply and
servos.  The first suits of Battledress appear at TL-13.
In order to use Battledress, the wearer must undergo extensive training and
in some cases, surgery.  Because of the great expense involved in preparing
and training someone in the use of Battledress, the warriors are far more
valuable then their suits.  Only the most highly qualified are selected for
assignment to Battledress units.
The Armor Panels on each suit are replaceable, and are mounted to an
internal structural frame.  The frame provides all joints, hydroelectronic
mounts, and equipment mounts, as well as structural strength.  The size and
strength of the frame determines the suit\'s combat load and the weight of
armor that may be carried.
One of the primary limitations on Battledress is that its great weight can
collapse normal floors and structures which are not designed for heavy
loads.  Because of this, three different classes of Battledress have been
developed; Heavy, used for field combat; Medium, used in cities; Light,
which is for use on board starships and low-intensity conflicts.  Some suits
are able to be modified for different classes.  With the addition, or
subtraction, of Armor Panels, the suit can be adapted for any environment.
Most suits, however, are developed for a separate purpose.

Battlepack Bays:  The primary weapons of Battledress are Battlepacks.  These
weapon systems are carried in Battlepack Bays on the rear of the suit.  The
number of bays available varies for each suit.  Each Battlepack weapon has a
number of bays required and is shown on the Weapons List.

Heavy Battledress can sometimes carry two light Battlepacks rather than one
heavy battlepack.  If carrying two Battlepacks each must be aimed and fired
separately unless they are linked together.  If two Battlepacks are linked
they have to be the same type of weapon system.  The To Hit roll is combined
into one roll, but the damage is kept separate.

Auxiliary Packs:  Some suits have spaces for Auxiliary Packs, on each limb a
nd on the body.  These are small, semi-independent weapon systems and
equipment packages which enhance the ability and efficiency of Battledress.

All Battledress suits have the standard Equipment listed in the Battledress
Systems.  The only variation is the number of Body Aux Packs.  All suits
have at least two Shoulder, two Thigh, two Abdomen, two Chest Aux Packs,.


BATTLEDRESS
Imperial:  The Imperium came out with one of the first suits of Battledress,
and have followed it with a long succession of improvements.

BD13:  Due to the high cost and training involved, the BD13 was designed
specifically for supporting Non-Powered Infantry.  It is slow and cumbersome
by current levels, but still packs a surprising punch.  Effective Str. is
27.  The BD13 has 8 Battlepack Bays and one additional Arm Aux Bay.  The
Operator must have surgery in order use the suit.

BD14 Series:  Built in three different models; Light, Medium, and Heavy, the
BD14 was a substantial improvement over the BD13.  The suits were for the
first time, designed to operate in groups, and fielded as large combat
units.

BD14H:  The Heavy version, the BD14H has 8 Battlepack Bays, 6 additional Aux
Bays (2 Chest, 2 Abdomen, 2 Arm), and an effective Str. of 40.

BD14M:  The Medium class of the series.  The BD14M has 4 Battlepack Bays and
3 additional Aux Bays (2 chest, 1 Arm).  Effective Str. is 30.

BD14L:  The Light variant of the series, the BD14L has 4 Battlepack Bays and
an effective Str. of 18.

BD15 Series:  Identical to the BD14 Series, only with more armor and
increasingly ease of use.

MBD15 Series:  The Imperial Marines, with their unique mission, recognized
the need to have a force that could rapidly change its configuration.  The
result is the MBD15, a suit that with the addition or subtraction of Armor
Panels can change from Heavy to Medium to Light.

MBD15 Heavy Configuration:  8 Battlepack Bays, 10 additional Aux Bays (4
Chest, 2 Abdomen, 2 Thigh, 2 Arm), and an effective Str. of 45.

MBD15 Medium Configuration:  4 Battlepack Bays, 3 additional Aux Bays (2
Chest, 1 Arm), and an effective Str. of 60.  The Str. is higher due to the
loss of Armor Panels on the same Frame.

MBD15 Light Configuration:  4 Battlepack Bays, no additional Aux Bays, and
an effective Str. of 70.

CD14&15:  The Imperial Army and Navy recognized the need for the crews of
combat vehicles, landing craft, and small ships to have some protection.
The result is the Crewdress, a light form of Battledress, based on the same
technology, but much lighter.  The CD14&15 have no Aux Packs and can carry
no Battlepacks.  The effective Str. is 15.

CBD14&15:  The Colonial Battledress is a cheap alternative to the high
priced Imperial versions.  It comes with only 2 Battlepack Bays, and half
the normal Aux Bays and one Arm Bay.  Its effective Str. is 18.

Seems a shame, what with said equipment costing half a MCr or so. An awful
lot like sending tank gunner out into combat a without his tank.

One of the fundamental issues here seems to be how BD is envisioned. Some
seem to see it as a high-tech, armored jumpsuit that takes little skill to
use properly, and others see it as a specialized vehicle that requires
great skill to use properly.

Battledress ain\'t like a set of heavy clothes. It *does* take a skill to
use properly, and to be *really* professional in it you are going to have
to spend a lot of your training time suited up.

Thinking about it in game terms, every skill level or character point you
put into battledress skill is a skill level or character point that doesn\'t
go to something else. IIRC, any actions that you take in battledress are
(more or less) limited to your skill level in battledress. So it would
behoove combat personnel to have lots of ability in battledress -- in other
words, specialized training.

Of course, if battledress *is* a highly specialized vehicle it seems seems
somewhat ridiculous to say that every Imperial Marine learns the skill.
After all, not every joe in an air force learns how to fly a fighter, nor
does every member of an army know how to operate a tank. What about IM
support personnel? What about marine fliers for interface craft or drivers
for grav armor and artillery? Why waste time training them in battledress
when they could better spend the time training in their own specialty?

As written, the IM don\'t seem very autonomous. Rather, they look to me like
highly specialized shock troops for the Imperial Navy. I guess that this
might be a better model than the U.S. Marine model that a lot of people
seem to be equating them with.

Hmm. I don\'t remember it actually being put to a vote, so I\'d be reticent
to say a majority felt either way about the matter. I personally though
Doug\'s piece was terrific.

In any event I don\'t think this has been a waste of bandwidth -- to me,
it\'s been entertaining, informative, and timely. My next game, while not
Traveller, has the PCs as troops in battledress (MARS guys in HAAM suits).

IMTU several things would happen, the BD computer would ID the source of the
grenade, and target return fire on command by the operator, while several
defensive systems would automatically act to neutralize the grenade...  AND
if it did hit, it would not penetrate the suit.  It may damage a system one
the suit.

I have changed the AV of BD, and pen of weapon systems.  My games tend not
to have too much gunfighting in them, as people die very fast when shots
fly.

I agree with everything except Exoskeleton assist repair. That is only on BD,

Interesting point, FGMP\'s always come with tageting computers? Where are my

I don\'t see how one could argue against using one skill for the other in areas
that require the same technical know-how. Learn to set your VCR clock and you
can probably do the same on your microwave.

Yeesh, that sounds scary. Do the Exoskeleton -assists have an "off" setting?
Battledress requires alot of traing to avoid smashing things on accident. I
would think that BD skill could be used for Vac Suit, but an arbiter could
convince me otherwise for his universe by saying BD is more user-friendly or
even completly automatic for some of the basics, rendering BD users somewhat
pampered. But able to crush their enemies!

Hmm, maybe Vac Suit should be a prerequisite?

It looks like the intention is to allow them the ability to remove troublesome

That\'s almost like saying that my local TV station owns the copyright to
_The Wizard of Oz_, since they got to broadcast it a time or two.

I\'m surprised that Yahoo and Geocities need to own the material to
censor it. All they should need, as part of their usage agreement,
is a notice that certain subjects are taboo, a notice that the poster is
responsible for what he puts on the site, and a notice that the service 
provider reserves the right to terminate service based on certain criteria.

Maybe they thought it was simpler to say, "If you post it, we own it.
Since we own it, we can take it down or leave it up at whim."

If I were a Yahoo/Geocities user, I\'d be worried about some vice
president reading their service agreement and getting the wonderful
idea of harvesting the entire web community for saleable content. Want
to see your web page\'s logo on a T-shirt, with you forbidden from using it?

The trouble with the image of BD Marines in the GT universe is the
inconsistency with the previous canon.  In CT / MT / TNE, BD was good armour
but was still vulnerable to hefty, man-portable, slugthrowers etc.  It
enhanced strength, and gave effectively unlimited endurance.  In the actual
GT book, the two types of BD mentioned are in this same mould. PD 4 DR 240
tops...

Then came Star Mercs and the horrendous Commando BD.  DR1200!!, speed
70mph!!!...  Whuh?!?

Let me get this straight... You want me to put my legs in here while it runs
at 70mph? Human limbs (even when being moved by an external device rather
than under their own power) just aren\'t designed for that.  If my legs
aren\'t in the BD legs, then I\'m just the Pilot/Driver of a very small Mech\',
and I want to play Traveller not Mechwarrior.

Also, the max damage for an (Gurps) FGMP-12 is 8d6*20, with no armour
divider, for a max of 960.  Hmmm, BD that is *invulnerable* to the best FGMP
in the Imperium.... I don\'t think we\'re in canon any more, Toto!

I can see the situation now...
"Stop using those Californium Rounds, or we send in the Marines...."
"Send \'em in, at least we\'ve got something that\'ll hurt them...."

Ran a couple PCs with a platoon of BD-wearing, PGMP-toting NPCs
up against the Chamax Horde once. They were feeling pretty good
until reports started coming over the tacnet...

"I\'m out."
"I\'ve got five left."
"Marines, fire by reduction, go!"

That was when they called for transport out.

Ugh.  Commando battledress was never seen in the Star Mercs playtest (actually,
none of the vehicles are, which could have made problems with all of them; for
example, I suspect I hsould have designed the Astrin as an IFV with a lot more
armor and firepower, rather than as a basic APC).  For the most part, one is
best off ignoring the commando battledress in Star Mercs.

Nah.  This wasn\'t clear in the stats, but DR is _squared_ against concussion. 
6d*2000 won\'t scratch DR 1200 (actually, it might cause the frame to
disintegrate, I don\'t remember how many body hp it has, and hp^2 will
disintegrate the frame).  The Intrepid has enough armor to survive a direct hit
with a kiloton nuclear weapon, though the frame will break apart at only about
0.2 kilotons.

The FGMP\'s that hook up to Battle Dress seem to - they include a
socket on the suit, part of the firing procedure is to plug in the gun. It
gives you a targeting reticle in your HUD, status readouts, and IIRC
even helped you get your BD into one of the predefined stable firing
stances so you wouldn\'t knock yourself on your metal-encased keister.

It may be that only the BD versions had integral firing computers, while
the grav-stabilized FGMP\'s used simpler sights. Remember, you can\'t
use a standard optical sight with a BD (or even Vac Suit) helmet on - 
you can\'t put your eye up to the optics. Even an ACR or Guass Rifle
intended for BD troops would need some kind of targeting link to the HUD.

You do realize the book that Doug is planning to do is on marines who are in
current service, right? It would be more akin to, to use the pilot analogy
again, American fighter pilots flying fighter craft. It\'s their job to use
the biggest and baddest stuff.

Fair enough. Again, I think this is a matter of how we see battle dress used
and as I said, it doesn\'t appear there\'s common ground between us.

Fair enough. You\'re just seeing things quite differently. I see Battle Dress
as integral to Impie marines. You seem to see it as something that the
soldier is issued, but may never put it on. Ostensibly because he\'s got to
prove himself to be a real snake eater to use it.

Alas, I have no military experience to say one way or another. To the best
of my knowledge though, folks like fighter pilots are usually given
airplanes when they go into the field, and tank crews are usually given
tanks.

>I don\'t think my traveller universe is canon, I am saying that CT is, oh, I

Well, I\'m not going to prod you and turn this into a potential flamewar. You
did make it quite clear that established Traveller canon included the
concept that marines had to work to get battle dress skill, let alone battle
dress.

I also draw from history/real life. You keep referring to like it\'s some
sort of magic wand that you can wave over things, as if merely saying that
*you* are drawing from history and real life gives my side of the discussion
less validity. I\'m not saying that to fire you up, but it seems to be the
case.

I assure you, I also draw from history/real life. It would appear that Doug
does too. You\'re not the only one who does. It\'s not a matter of real life
and history. The problem is that the real life and historical parallels we
see are entirely different.

Pilots don\'t have dress planes, or KP-planes or mess-planes. You have a
plane, but the situation does not always demand you use it.

>That\'s the part where when you roll your character, he still performs

Fair enough. As I\'ve already said, I have certain problems with that method
of character generation. It can give results that are not consistent with
written canon. I\'m not sure if I can agree that if it doesn\'t match a
specific character generation system then it\'s not canon.

Fair enough. Do keep in mind that, as I\'ve already said, Doug\'s book is
about Imperial marines in Imperial service. Even in Classic Traveller, it
would be difficult at best to give out skills for such a campaign by random
chance.

"Well, you\'ve got battle dress, but you two don\'t. Fred, you\'ll be hitting a
hot dirtside LZ in your battle dress and a plasma rifle. You two guys have

Well, in composing this message I took a break and walked into the living
room where I found the May-June 1999 issue of Army RD&A face down. On the
back there\'s this picture, a collection of concept art. Above it is the
phrase "Force XXI." It shows various pieces of equipment, but the
centerpiece of the image is an infantryman. His entire body is sealed inside
a suit. He\'s got some sort of device strapped to his left forearm. On his
back is some sort of high-tech equipment. His face is completely covered by
a sort of visor and helmet, and in the image we can see that there is a
targetting HUD projected onto it. He\'s got a nasty looking gun with some
sort of double scope.

From what I know of the Force XXI program, it\'s an attempt to create a new
military doctrine based on the new technologies that are available to the
military. The new combat rifle, for example, will most likely debut as part
of a suit not unlike the one the soldier is wearing. If the theory becomes
practice, the soldier will be able to use the HUD in conjunction with the
rifle to find the range to a target and make sure that his grenade explodes
where the target is. In and of itself, that\'s an entirely new skill that no
infantryman has ever needed to know before. That\'s only one part of the
suit\'s utility, apparently, the suit will venture into territory that you
seem to claim is comic bookish. This will not supplant the infantryman\'s
usefulness without the suit entirely, but it might very well start such a
trend. In theory, the soldier\'s not expected to survive without the suit. It
makes the assumption that the battlefields of the 21st century will likely
include contaminants of all sorts: biological, chemical, radioactive. What
kind of new doctrine such a suit will usher in, if any, is unclear now. The
suit is still in the concept stage. However, we\'re on the verge of seeing
the very first suit of "combat armor," and who knows where it\'s going to
take us.

It\'s gospel to me that the more we rely on technology, the less we\'ll be
able to do without it. I know you\'re getting tired of the discussion, but
I\'m going to step off of the pilot angle and propose one last scenario...
from history ;)

Imagine on one side there\'s a group of German soldiers from WWI. On the
other side is a group of late 18th century British regulars. Who would you
lay money on? The British regulars were historically renowned for their
abilities. They had an excellent reputation. The German WWI soldiers were
also renowned for their battlefield prowess. My money would be with the
Germans.

On the other hand, let\'s change the experiment. Suddenly, the German
soldiers are issued Brown Bess muskets instead of their rifles and machine
guns. For the sake of argument, we\'ll even say that they\'ve been trained to
some extent with the guns, but the bulk of their . The Germans don\'t look
like such a sure bet anymore, do they? In fact, most bookies, if given the
proper information, would probably favor the British regulars.

It has nothing to do with how impressive the fighting force\'s record is. It
has more to do with the training, skills and experience the fighting force
has and where the bulk of the training, skills and experiences happens to
be.

Fair enough.

No. I do understand what you mean.

Because the battlefield won\'t be one of the past, it\'ll be one of the
future.

That seems to be the way the world is going in real life. Ever since the
first cavemen figured out that they could sharped a stick or make a flint
knife this has been the case mankind has had to rely on technology. This is
not modern, it\'s ancient. Charioteers, Longbow men, native americans in the
role of light cavalry. Like you, I can call on history for examples. History
is full of specialized soldiers who were feared and respected by their
enemies but who were not as effective without the tools they had trained,
had skill with and had experience with.

<Shrug> It\'s unavoidable when a setting or background reaches a certain size
that every single element of the background isn\'t going to appeal to
everybody. The Traveller Universe codes at the bottom of posts to the lists
were a lighthearted attempt to deal with this concept during (if I remember
correctly) the great automation debate. Whenever any changes (or imagined
changes) are proposed on the list there\'s always a "smacking around" period
of tension, with different opinions of how the Official Traveller Universe
should be.

I\'ve traditionally been the one being smacked around mind you ;)

The problem is that canon is not written by one person. It\'s a creative
collaborative effort by many people. There *are* contradictions in it here
and there. That\'s inevitable for anything that\'s lasted for 20 years.

Thirty years from now the folks playing Traveller might look back at this
debate and say, "Sheez! Everybody knows that the Heavy Armored Infantry in
real life can\'t even be seperated from their suits! How could anybody be as
backwards as these two guys."

The resource book isn\'t forcing anything on anybody. There are resources
such as the Traveller mailing list where you can ask what other people think
of products. Most game stores allow people to browse through their books
before buying them.

I can\'t read minds, but I suspect that Doug submitted his proposal to the
list for the kind of feedback that we are now giving as we type to each
other. It\'s going to help him to temper and forge the work he\'s writing. He
may take my comments under advisement, he may take yours, or Mr. Thrash\'s,
or anybody else\'s. He may press on with his own vision and ignore all
comments. That\'s what helping to shape a universe is about.

Nobody\'s forcing anything on anybody here.

>I have taken up far to much bandwidth and to much of your time with this

<shrug> I\'ve seen no indications of the sort one way or another. I\'ve seen
people weigh in on both sides. Then I\'ve also seen people way in on one side
with reservations, and then I\'ve seen others prod Doug about specific points
and what they feel is right or wrong with it, but I haven\'t seen a landslide
of opinion one way or the other yet.

However, you haven\'t taken up too much of my time. I\'ve enjoyed the
conversation. I don\'t think that either of us managed to "win" and I think
continued discussion of the broad points would be useless. I see battle
dress one way, you see it another way. I didn\'t really set out to win. I\'d
never really thought much one way or another about the Marines, and this
discussion has allowed me to fit them into my own Traveller universe more
effectively. So, don\'t worry about taking up my time. I\'ll manage. ;)

Yes, you can! Just log into the geocities ftp-server with you name and

That should get you around this idiocy.

BTW: As far as I know they can´t just go and claim everything as their own
suddenly when
they feel like it. This is not the deal i signed when joining geocities.
As deal is a deal and without my consent, they cannot suddenly change that. 
So if i don´t react at all, i won´t be bound by this as silence can´t be
interpreted as a willful action. And you need at least that for a new
contract.

danger to himself and to  his team, as much as he is to the enemy. Green
troopers will statistcly break quicker than veteren troops, and would not
focus their fire power effectively as they would if they had some
experience.

The last thing I want is a power suit is some person who has done minimal
training or had little combat experience. I want someone who knows what a
shooting war is, knows how to survive a shooting war, and be able to use
the force multiplier available to him with the PA to make sure the other
person dies for his king/country/corperation/religion.

In my Trav campaign, Ship troops and shock troops would have access to PA
(i disagree with limited PA in ships, as you may have to fight outside a
ship, in the fuel tanks or even jump to an enemy ship in space).  Power
armour would be the Best of the Best, the goal that other marines spend
their career trying to earn. Other marines fight in combat armour (which
would be augmented, but not to the level of PA).

People may disagree, its their job.

In many wargames (Star Grunt II and WH40k spring to mind, both small
company level combat as seen in traveller games), only elites get Power
armour. While there are PA only troops (Deathwing Terminators in 40k, New
Israeli in SGII), these are extreamly dangerous units limited in number.
While there is nothing stopping you in SGII from having PA for every Tom ,
Dick and Harriet in your army, giving PA to green or regular troops is just
asking for trouble (I know i have PA, but there is no way I am charging
that hill, theose guys have guns!!!!!). (In Stargrunt close assult, the
attacking player makes a morale check before attacking, based on leadership
and troop quality. If you cant guarentee your troops being able to attack,
why are they there???).

Well, then they have to define whats taboo.
"How to make a pipe bomb" might be a good example of taboo.
But "Chemistry notes on combustive reactions" might be hunky dory.
By being rather sweeping in the privileges they get in the deal, they
don\'t have to deal with any fine lines.  If I was them, since the web space
is free, its the deal I\'d want.  The other option is disclaimers and liability
waivers.  If I\'m a web publisher, I want control of my intellectual property.
If I want control, they want liability waivers.  Even though its not really a
legal issue, if you pay for the privilege to post, you\'re more likely to
refrain from illegal conduct.  If its totally free, it almost becomes and
invitation to say whatever you want, regardless of the consequences.

Thats about what it says, translated from the legalese.

The agreement says "non-exclusive", so they couldn\'t stop you from
doing anything with your material.  But, they could do whatever you
could do.

You mean contrary to previous "agreements" don\'t you?
If you make a new agreement, the old one is gone.
Otherwise the original is valid until it expires or is otherwise terminated.
Things like TOS are changed all the time.  By continuning to use whatever is
the object of the TOS, you agree to them.

That particular design was totally broken (in terms of playability) and was
never playtested.  It caused a rather large hue and cry on Pyramid, where
the playtests happen.  I would tend to ignore it.

I do apologise for that, I did take a liberty with the number of posts, not
an actual vote.  I looked at (at the time), that there were two people
saying marines eat, sleep, shower in BD* ...
(* an exaggeration to get my point over that they really, really, really,
want ALL marines to be in BD -- not what they actually said)
. and wanted non-suited IM\'s to have a chance at being penalised, against
what I saw as several individuals posting that marine players should not
have BD-skill shoved down their throats.

I took the afore mentioned liberty, knowing I would be "right" (no further
posters = the majority of posts say no forced BD) or "wrong" (poster\'s such
as yourself being almost compelled to post a view one way or the other as I
have "no right to speak for you"... and this has been the case).  I was
working on the old premise that "if you do not vote in a government
election, you have no rights to complain about whom is elected." (not that
that stops non-voters :)  However, I wasn\'t actually going to ask for a
consensus, but it sounds like an idea :^)

Actually 12d*2000 max for a 0.001kT micronuke.  Which will also do 12d*400
flash damage, for which DR definitely is not squared.

Yes! Advanced Classic Traveller is alive in my game world. In 1975 I was
introduced to Traveller and have been involved in role-playing and refing a
Traveller universe ever since. I like the way Traveller developed characters on
a year-by-year basis and not just throwing a fixed number of skills points at a
PC. But I also felt that the character generation rollup was weak and somewhat
unrealistic. So I decided to create a much more comprehensive and realistic
system. Ive spent hundreds of hours during the past twenty four years
developing a better system that provides a much more dynamic and realistic PC.
Theres an overview of the chargen system I have been using over the years. This
includes an extensive pre-service background:

The first roll is for Special Characters: Theres a remote possibility (a roll
20 on 1d20) of the PC being a laboratory massed-produced clone, or genetically
enhanced, or cybernetically enhanced, or psionically enhanced, or a symbiont, or
a shape-shifter, or an intelligent android. Some of these will affect the base
characteristics scores.

For normal PCs roll the characteristics, or roll and modify if PC is Special

Family Structure: PC was raised by: Orphanage, Multiple Foster Families, Single
Foster Family, Natural Parent(s), Grand Parent(s), Other Extended Family,
Commune (Multiple Parents). Adds to fleshing out a PC.

Roll for each Parents Background: Education Level, Social Standing, Family
Wealth, State of Health (healthy, chronic illness, dead), Ethnic Background
(first, second or third generation), Profession(s), Siblings (number, sex) and
PCs High School Type (religious, public, elite private, military, home, private
tutoring) along with High School Honors/Scholarships

Next roll PCs Home World: Planet Type (garden, ice, ocean, vacuum, desert), Tech
Level (TL-5 to TL-16), Production (agricultural, mining, industrial,
technological), Population (very high, high, medium, low, very low), GNP (very
rich, rich, medium, poor, very poor), Law Level (very high, high, medium, low,
very low)

Roll for Pre-Service Skills (consistent with PCs background and home world): An
automatic SL-3 for Primary Language. Roll once for each catagory: Computer,
Personality, Sports, Performance, Second Language, Technical,
Vehicle/Aircraft/Watercraft, Survival, Weapon

University or Military Academy: Entrance, Graduation, Honors, Skills

Branch Selection, Branch School Skills, Honors

(In real life situations commissioned officers are in command of military units
and make all major decisions. I make it easier to receive a commission. If a
failure occurs for University or Academy entrance or graduation the PC may save
eight skill points during their enlisted service and earn a bachelors degree
(going to college at night). In this way they can be almost guaranteed of a
direct commission.) I also have a Warrant Office program for each service.

Each year contains a series of rolls: Assignment, Position (command or staff),
Unit/Ship/School/Other (POW, Hospital/Rehab), Honors for Schools, Mission,
Survival/Capture/POW, Wounds/Hospital/Rehab, Skill Roll (normally one or
numerous for military schools), Efficiency Report*, Decorations, Special Life
Events (marriage, divorce, birth of child, death of parent, bankruptcy, win the
lotto, become famous due to military mission, etc.), PIPs** Received/ Used,
Promotion, Friendly or Hostile Contact***, Aging.

Eventually, the PC either transfers to another service/organization (allowed
only once) or resigns his commission anytime before retirement and begins the
game, or retires and rolls for money saved, equipment owned, additional contacts
(friendly or hostile), ship title, established credit lines, special permits,
professional licenses, guild or association memberships, cybernetic
implants/devices, finding psionics training, anagathics, noble title and estate,
etc. Some PCs may be court marshalled and serve prison time before being
released into the game.

* Efficiency Reports are critical to promotion and future command assignments.
They can be Poor (charges filled and Court Marshal ordered), Average or
Excellent (Receiving PIPs)

** PIPs are Personal Influence Points awarded for duty as Generals/Admirals Aid,
Diplomatic Attache, Liaison to the Imperial Moot, Special Command Assignments,
Military Academy Professorship, Excellent Efficiency Reports, Decorations of
High Level, etc. These are in essence political favors owed the PC by someone
with influence that can be used to affect die rolls either plus or minus for any
roll except survival and efficiency reports. Example: the PC rolls a 4 on a
skill table but wants another skill on the table, he adds or substracts PIPs to
the roll reducing his PIP bank.

*** Every year roll for a contact - an NPC that may be a special family member,
a best friend, a patron or mentor, a former commander, a professor, or a
powerful enemy. Each contact will have a name, service, position, rank, world
location and if frieendly or hostile and reasoning for their feelings. Other
game PCs can be contacts making for common interests or experiences on group
startup.

 I have used this system in dozens of roll ups with excellent results. Players
always enjoy their PCs more having more extensive background knowledge. The
system I use was taken from hundreds of manuals and books on the military
personnel systems of the US, UK, Germany and Israel.

After a long period of inactivity, I\'ve decided to try to revive
what started out at the Traveller Language Project, and which
later did a partial morph to the Traveller Cultural Development
Project.  The revival includes moving the list to ONEList and
renaming it.

Now, comes the hard part: recruitment.  We still have most of the
people who joined the original TravLang list out of interest in
the language concept.  We\'re still interested in that aspect, but
it\'s not exclusive.  Now, we want people with vocations,
avocations, hobbies, interests, skills, and so on in just about
anything that we could use to flesh out a potentially massive
sourcebook on a focus culture in the Traveller universe.  And I
mean _anything_.  Interested in military history and/or
operations?  Tell us about Vilani military doctrine and
philosophies.  Medicine?  What\'s Vland\'s medical history and
current approach to medical diagnosis and treatment?  Literature?
What are the various Vilani literary forms, and how did they
develop, and what are some noteworthy works?  Architecture?  How
did it develop on Vland, what sort of styles are favored (and
what styles have been favored historically), and what are the
philosophies behind various types of designs?  You get the idea.
Basicly, if you have something to contribute to _this_ list,
chances are you also have ideas that can be used in
Traveller-Culture.  Come give us a try.  You can subscribe by
visiting

The much maligned Scout/Commando BD in _Star Mercs_ has:

10 mile AESA (Active sensor)
5 mile PESA (Passive sensor)
1 mile passive sonar
.5 mile geophone
2 mile radscanner
.1 mile gravscanner

All of this integrated and run by the onboard minicomputer.

I think I put in a hint that the ranks had changed before in the section on
the Marine Cutlass.  i mentioned "Star Sergeant" what\'s-his-name, mumble

Never!  The Army Jump Brigades take the jobs that are too big for a Marine
Regiment!  The also jump with artillery support in module form.  Army
Jumpers have to assemble their field guns on the LZ, and they are muscle
moved until support comes in.

About as ridiculous as modern USMC pilots keeping up their M-16A2
qualification.

You learn it because every Marine learns it.  Someday, that Marine fighter
jock may be forced into a position where he has to suit and fight a
desperate rearguard action, just like a USMC F/A-18 pilot could find
himself leading a bunch of jarheads.  

In the template as written, the mandatory investment is a whopping 2 points
out of 140 for an average campaign.  This gives you DX worth of the skill,
or Battlesuit (TL12)-10 for an average human.

Bingo!  We have a winner.  The marines and Navy are part and parcel of the
Emperor\'s will.  The Marines depend on the Navy for the vast majority of
their support and supply, and even to haul them around.  The Imperial
Marine Force is nowhere near as autonomous as the USMC.

The strength augmentation would of course have a "safe" setting that allows
an individual to move, carry his/her load of gear and do the predrop
routine.  After the trooper is secured in the drop capsule, then the safety
interlocks are turned off and full power is routed to the suit\'s "muscles."

The advantage in advanced Battledress is that it does do a lot of the work
for the trooper inside it.  The true advantage isn\'t the strength and
armor, but the amount of information a BD equipped soldier can process.
The BD computer processes all the sensor information and presents it to the
trooper on his HUD.  It\'s also tied in to a network consisting of the
trooper\'s squadmates.  What they see, he sees, and his chain of command
sees.  The battlecomp also does a lot of information sorting.  Say a sniper
fires at a Marine.  The point-defence radar picks up the incoming slug,
analyzes the flight characteristics, assigns the round a position in the
threat queue for PD fire, and back-tracks to the point of origin.  It then
puts up an icon (I\'ve always pictured red inverted triangles) over the
probable location of the shooter, along with a quick rundown of what he\'s
using against you.

Since all the squaddies get the same info, it\'s much easier for the
Sergeant to direct an appropriate response.  Also, the contact information
filters up to platoon and company levels much faster.

Except that the Kinunir model was broken when Loren wrote "Imperial Marine
Task Force Organization" for JTAS #12.  In there it was explicitly sated
that *all* Marines are equipped with BD and armed with fusion weapons.

If you use Kinunir for your canonical standard, then Regina Subsector is
adequately protected by five 1200 ton battlecruisers.

Persoanl note: please don\'t call me "son", don\'t want to get into it, but
it\'s guarnteed to set me off.

To make things clear, I\'m not designing for a shooting gallery, I\'m
designing for an elite military force that has the power (and credit lines)
of the Iridium Throne and 11,000 worlds behind it.  The early versions of
Assault BD are a bit slower (no sprinting at 70MPH! Carry about the same
armor, and have nasty intergal weapons systems.  It\'s designed so that a
sixty man platoon can handle forces several times their own size without
being wiped out.

In a general sense, do the following Terms of Service (Homestead.com)
grab as much as Yahoo has?:

As a layman, I would think that Homestead is limiting itself more than
Yahoo has (due to the first clause), but I wonder about the vagueness of
the term "all intellectual property rights" in the second clause of the
sentence.

These were about the range I was thinking. Someone with no
computer skill could use application programs (library,
return-fire, auto-evade), computer-1 would mean competent
to oversee a system - so when the pilot says, "My quick-start
menu bar has disappeared" (or the TL15 equivalent) this guy
could say, "You dimwit! Copy <menu-bar> to your rc1 directory
and reboot."

Computer-3 would be a comp-sci graduate.

Electronics-1 could plug off the shelf components into your
computer, and diagnose which part was faulty when the pilot
was saying, "My <instert tech here> button isn\'t working".

Electronics-3 would be an electronics engineer.

I suppose medic-1 would be like an LPN.
          medic-2 would be like an RN.
The equivalent 4 year degree would be BSN? Bachelor of Nursing?

An MD, OTOH, has more 4 years of just pre-med, then 2? years
medical school. If he just wants to be a GP, he then has 1
year of internship (working in the field).

I had forgotten about the instruction skill rules though. This
seems to say that skill-1 is achieved in a semester, which
makes the skills cheap (which is why they say the GM should 
make it difficult to find instructors).

On the fringes, you get all of that, plus brushfire wars flaring up every now

After all, Sharurshid is a Villani mega, and even casual perusers of the TML

I\'m not completely convinced that it\'s purely biological. There are various
tribes that exist to whom the sexual act is not considered "dirty." I\'m not
an anthropologist or anything of the sort, mind you. However, there\'s a
distinct possibility that the taboo status of the sexual act has less to do
with its actual "dirtiness" and more to do with the little tiny people that
it produces. In other words, sex can lead to another mouth to feed for the
community.

For example, I can easily imagine that this is how various marriage customs
got started over the years. After all, on the base level, you are "getting
permission" from your community\'s authority to engage in the sex act. Of
course, the spirit of the institution may no longer exist in the same
fashion, but it\'s not hard to see how it can be based on the result, not the
act itself.

While I have read your reasoning, I do not agree completely. Maximum 
nessisary force yes. Take out the entire floor, yes. The whole 
building? No.  

You do know the how \'to secure a building\' is interpreted by the branches of
the United States Armed Forces.

If you order a Marine unit to secure a building they will either call in an
airstrike, or set demolitions to level the building to the ground.

If you order an Army unit to secure a building, the unit will set up a fence
and bunker to protect it.

If you order a Navy unit to secure a building, a guard will turn out the
lights and lock the doors.

If you order an Air Force unit to secure a building, they will sign a long
term lease agreement for it.

A Marine unit securing a site is a pretty serious bit of business, from what
some of my ex-military friends have told me.

It would seem to me that Doug is essentially right.  Although I dont believe
that guard duty on a ship would require BD, I have to believe that a Marine
is going to be armed with that option at every turn.  The point is brought
up that in AHL people will snub pistols are taking down BD.  This seems
reasonable to a degree ( in the maze of the ship ), but as the writer said,
" in a battlefield, the guy with the pistol would be toast ".

Doug is also right in this:  In an Imperium where messages take months and
years to get out to the people, nothing says " Get your ducks in a row "
like the threat of Marines coming down on your ass.  Marines have to be
fearsome.  Marines have to come in with a big show of force and use that to
scare the people into line.  It has to be this way, I see no other way
around it.

We had a game being run at a FLGS at one point though where TL15 BD Marines
were fighting the local TL6 " warlord ".  The BD Marine tried to stand down
the local equivalent of a Tiger.  The tank shot, knocked him down, and then
basicly ran over him.

The sound was described as "  that sickening lobster-in-the cracker crunch
".

I always liked that.

First thought : would \'dickhead\' be a term of endearment?
Second thought : where would the foetus gestate? (Although Athena sprang
from Zeus\' forehead...)

Sorry.
On a more serious note :-
Sex (the reproductive act rather than meiosis, etc.) being "dirty"
probably has its basis more in culture than anything else.
Sex feels good so reproduction will occur - consider it as an exercise
in risk-benefit.
For humans, sex and the search for it can be so time consuming that a
person could spend their time doing little else.
This is discouraged so that other aspects of life can go on :- feeding,
self-defence and cultural activities, for example.

    'body' => '* From Building Blocks to Biomolecules
Simple molecules - for example sugars, amino acids and nucleotides
(purine or pyrimidine [nitrogen-containing] bases joined to phosphated
sugars) - can join together to form polymers.
	Polymer formation is relatively easy to induce. Heating of dry
organic compounds can lead to polymer formation, as can catalysis by
a wide range of substances e.g. inorganic phosphates.
	These compounds would initially be completely random in their
structure. Polynucleotides can act as templates for further
polymerisation reactions, e.g. :-

A-G-G-U + nucleotide soup -> A-G-G-U -> A-G-G-U + U-C-C-A,
                             * * * *
                             U-C-C-A

where A = adenine, C = cytosine, G = guanine, U = uracil and * represent
hydrogen bonds (\'weak\' areas of relative negative and positive charge).

A can only link weakly with U and C with G due to the shapes of the
molecules and the distribution of charge.

	This process, called complementary templating, is the basis of
genetic information transcription in all terrestrial organisms.
	Polynucleotide chains will adopt unique three-dimensional shapes
depending on their sequence. Such molecules have been demonstrated to
exert catalytic activity on other molecules and the ability to copy
themselves.
	With time, errors would arise in the copying process, leading to
new molecules being produced. Given an initial set of conditions, a
group of \'replicators\' would have eventually dominated the environment.
One presumes the fastest, most accurate and most stable replicators
prevailed. 
	Nucleotides are limited however in the variety of reactions they can
catalyse. The potential number of amino acid polymers - proteins - is
much larger, simply because there are more amino acids to choose from.
[Note that even though twenty amino acids and five nucleotides make up
almost all of those found in Earthly life, the number of possible amino
acids and nucleotides is almost endless].
	The number of possible sugar polymers [carbohydrates] is larger still.
Consider this : eleven chemically distinct compounds can be created from
two molecules of glucose.  

It is currently thought that nucleotides came first, then proteins, then
carbohydrates. Any sequence is possible, although carbohydrates are yet
to be shown to be capable of catalytic activity - but the science of
glycobiology is still relatively young. 

* Aside : Optical isomerism
Compounds can display optical isomerism - they rotate polarised light in
different directions. The structural requirement is simple - a carbon
atom linked to four different chemical groups.
	Chemists group compounds into those that rotate polarised light
clockwise (dextro, + or D isomers) or counterclockwise (laevo, - or L
isomers).
	In terrestrial life, all amino acids are L isomers.
Almost all sugars are D isomers (gut membrane glucose transporters will
accept L-glucose with 1% of the avidity of the D form - but most
organisms can\'t do anything with L-glucose). 
	Where optical isomerism is possible, in time one form will dominate
over another because to catalyse reactions with the other isomer
requires more energy. This phenomenon is known as \'stereoselectivity\'.

How did this situation arise?
It is currently thought that a small excess of one isomer, created by an
abundance of circularly polarised light (common in star forming
regions), and subsequent amplification by later chemical reactions, did
the trick.

[If left alone for long enough, amino acids will revert to a mixture of
both isomers (a so-called racemic mixture). This is the basis of a
relatively new sample dating technique, since this process occurs at a
known rate].

So with time and the right conditions, molecules capable of
sophisticated stereoselective synthetic reactions are possible.
\'Communities\' of these chemicals represent the precursors to life as we
know it. How are their energy needs met?

* Metabolism : What does it mean to be an \'oxygen breather\', anyway?
The sum total of the chemical reactions taking place in an organism is
termed metabolism.
	Reactions are of two broad types : catabolic, where energy is
liberated in a series of small usable steps via the breakdown of complex
molecules, and anabolic - the synthesis of complex molecules from
simpler substrates, which costs energy.
	In Earthly life, there are two important chemical reactions that 
illustrate both processes :-

Catabolic : the aerobic breakdown of glucose
C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + 3085kJ/mol glucose (50% stored in the
high energy phosphate bonds of 38 molecules of adenosine triphosphate,
ATP ; the remainder is \'wasted\' heat).

and the reverse anabolic reaction, photosynthesis - this allowed the
replenishment of organic molecules from atmospheric gases.

Photosynthesis is the reason why worlds have oxygen in their
atmospheres. Oxygen is difficult to liberate from rocks, etc. without
extensive violent geological activity.

Early in life\'s history, it is presumed that energy requirements were
met by the anaerobic degradation of glucose (glycolysis) as it forms the
"backbone" of most contemporary organisms\' metabolic pathways :-
glucose -> lactic acid + 2 ATP

The capability to use oxygen came later when it became more abundant.
Aerobic respiration [the citric acid or Krebs cycle and the electron
transport chain] is based entirely within mitochondria, which are
symbiotic bacteria which merged with our distant ancestors early in the
story of life.   

Chloroplasts, the organelles of photosynthesis, also appear to be
endosymbionts.

* Some alternative systems
Hypothetical central metabolic pathways take the following general
form:-

\'biomolecule\' + \'reactant\' <-> \'breakdown products\' + energy

Reactant       Breakdown Product of Reactant
[\'inhaled\']    [\'exhaled\']   
[Oxygen        Carbon dioxide and water]
Nitrogen       Ammonia or urea (NH2 - CO - NH2)
Sulphur        Hydrogen sulphide
Hydrogen       Water 
peroxide
Chlorine       Chlorides
Methane        Carbon dioxide
Phosgene       Carbon dioxide
Hydrogen       Methane
Ammonia        Nitric acid
Hydrogen       Sulphuric acid
sulphide

The forward (left -> right) reaction is equivalent to the breakdown of
glucose ; the reverse, photosynthesis.

In general terms, reactions analogous to glucose breakdown should :-
 - cause the \'biomolecule\' to lose electrons (oxidation) ;
 - cause the \'reactant\' to gain electrons (reduction) ; and
 - lead to the release of energy from bond rearrangements.

The ammonia -> nitric acid and hydrogen sulphide -> sulphuric acid
systems do not fulfil the criteria above, in that the reactant
substances are oxidised, not reduced ; but energy production is
reasonable. Exotic or corrosive atmosphere worlds could be populated
with organisms that run on such systems.

* The coming of cells : the importance of membranes
To maintain large amounts of complicated machinery in a stable
environment, the machinery should be enclosed.
	Cells can be seen as complex chemical plants. Membranes develop to let
nutrients in, wastes out and to keep interconnected machinery in close
proximity.
	Cell membranes are made up primarily of phospholipids : molecules with
a charged end and an uncharged one. Fats form droplets in water ;
phospholipids form vesicles with a bilayer of phospholipid molecules
separating inside and outside.

Outside    0======  =======0   Inside
           0======  =======0
           0======  =======0

where 0 represents the charged (hydrophilic) end, = the hydrophobic
portions.
	Keeping cellular machinery and metabolic intermediates charged prevents
them from leaving the cell, as they can\'t easily cross the hydrophobic
portion of the membrane. [Uncharged compounds with reasonable solubility
in both media can cross easily - e.g. oxygen and carbon dioxide].
	As cells become more complex, internal membranes arise to divide the
cell into compartments or organelles.
Some notable examples include :-
	- the nucleus, where genetic information is stored, transcribed and
repaired ;
	- the endoplasmic reticulum, where protein and lipid synthesis is
performed, as well as many miscellaneous reactions (e.g. breakdown of
foreign compounds) ;
        - the Golgi apparatus, which adds carbohydrate chains to
proteins ; and
        - vesicles which serve storage, secretory and degradative
functions (lysosomes and peroxisomes as examples of the last category).

* Multicellularity : the grand experiment
Most terrestrial life is made up of single celled organisms without
nuclei (prokaryotes or bacteria). Depending on which estimates you read,
most of the Earth\'s biomass could actually be subsurface bacteria.
	Why do multicellular organisms exist at all?
	There must be some benefits from specialisation e.g. easier to maintain
a certain environment (temperature, acidity, solute concentration) and
the ability to better make use of available resources (e.g. a tree vs. a
blue-green alga or cyanobacterium).
	With the advent of different organisms, different ecological niches
arose - and yet more creatures appeared to inhabit these new
environments.
	The process probably had its beginnings in colonial organisms,
single-celled forms which grouped together because they could feed more
efficiently. Examples include myxobacteria (which \'hunt in packs\' and
form \'fruiting bodies\' when resources run low), and green algae e.g.
Gonium sp. which aggregate in groups of 4, 8, 16 or 32 cells.
Volvox sp. can have more than 50,000 cells linked together to form a
hollow sphere. There is some division of labour within these colonies,
with a small population of cells serving a reproductive function.
	From these humble beginnings, things became very complicated as
organisms adapted to meet the challenges of varied and varying
environments. For example :-
	The development of extracellular substrates to serve as foundations for
sheets of cells (epithelia) ;
	Folding these sheets to produce enclosed regions e.g. the digestive sac
or coelenteron of hydrae, anemones and corals ; the space between the
inner and outer cell layers of these organisms in which their nervous
system enjoys conditions amenable to the propagation of signals
(saltatory conduction) ;
	The development of nervous and sensory systems to adapt to changing
environments ; and
	Other systems to handle waste and nutrient transport, maintain fluid,
electrolyte and acid-base balance, structural support and locomotion,
etc.	 	
	Vertebrates have over 200 distinct cell types, which can be grouped
into several organ systems.

* Summary
- - Biological molecules are complex. Their formation given appropriate
conditions seems inevitable. Stereochemistry develops early as it is a
more efficient way of using available resources.
- - Metabolism is dependent on chemical reaction pathways that turn \'food\'
into usable energy ; waste products are recycled with the assistance of
external energy sources (light, heat, chemical gradients).
- - The formation of cells and multicellular organisms are mechanisms for
making better use of available resources. The activity of living things
can dramatically change the planetary environment, creating new niches
for life to occupy.

* What\'s in the next post?
Scaling laws :- relating metabolic rate to size and a few other
interesting parameters
Organ physiology :- hearts, lungs, kidneys, etc. Why they are necessary
and some other functional considerations.

IIRC, somewhere in TMiGE, it is mentioned that one crazy eddie did manage
to find a reliable form of birth control. And, his Master WAS wiped out by
over-breeding neighbors. It\'s mentioned when the midshipmen are trapped on
the surface of Mote Prime. 

Okay. I\'ve pulled out the book. A hormone was developed that would trick
the motie body into thinking it was pregnant and then turn the motie into a
sterile male. The problem is, the hormone only works on a female who hasn\'t
been pregnant yet, and the change isn\'t reversible. Therefore, the moties
this procedure is used on can never have kids.

That would certainly explain its\' lack of popularity.

Obviously, the equation is reversible - it works in either direction, so any

system, as you say. However, that movement, relative to Earth, affects not
the speed (1020) but the distance to be travelled (20 light years) so that
on the return journey and using your figures the distance to be travelled
(D) is as follows:

    D = 20 + (0.002 * 0.000343)  = 20.000000686

the return journey therefore takes

    t = 20.000000686 / 1020 (= 0.01961)

In other words, the difference is insignificant and no time travel has taken
place.

Being the oldest source doesn\'t make it the best.  As has been pointed out,
later canonical material said otherwise.  Given that Kinunir is Adventure
1, I think it\'s safe to say that things have changed a bit (you\'ll never
see a 1200-ton ship with a black globe now either.)
 
FWIW: I submitted a Kinunir conversion for the GT Imperial Navy book and
gave it battledress space for all troops.

Me too.  And if you discount the Commando battledress, which everyone
agrees is a bad idea, done by someone not real familiar with GURPS, then
you do have almost this situation.  A Gauss Rifle firing stock ammo won\'t
generally do the trick (except on a critical success, which can often
bypass all armor), but switch to hyperdense penetrators or some such and
it\'s a real threat.

One of Roderick\'s very early designs was a very heavy rifle designed for
use within battledress. Plasma/fusion guns are nice clamshells, but I cant
see why a trooper in BD couldnt use some sort of chain gun from the hip. Or
lug a dirty great big recoiless rifle.

One of the key points about the survivability of BD troops is the efficacy
of BD point defense. Rocket-propelled grenades are a too-obvious
countermeasure to BD for them to lack defenses against it.

If I was building BD, I\'d certainly build it with a grav belt, which should
reduce the contact mine problem (mines with prox fuses of various sorts,
OTOH will be an issue for all troops).

    'body' => '* Scaling laws : some interesting rules o\'thumb
In the 1930s an American veterinarian, Max Kleiber, noted that metabolic
rate was proportional to an animal\'s mass raised to the 3/4 power.
        This relationship has been investigated in plants, animals and
cellular organelles and would appear to be generally valid
across 27 orders of magnitude (!).
        Other parameters that seem to fit power functions include
longevity, heart rate, number of offspring, lung surface area, etc.
        In general :-
        variable = constant X mass^power

The constants vary with the group of organisms concerned (birds,
mammals, etc.)

Why are such relationships important?
For the purpose of this discussion, it allows us to guesstimate sensible
answers to questions like "How much methane does this creature need an
hour to survive?" or "What is the IR signature of a K\'kree in ceremonial
armour at laser rifle range?"
        In more general terms the presence of power laws suggests that
organisms are optimally adapted to get nutrients in and wastes out, and
as they get larger the adaptations required change (and are generally
more efficient).

* Some (more) biological gearheadedness
It is assumed that all life on a given world arises from a given solvent
system (e.g. water) and has common central metabolic pathways (e.g.
glycolysis / photosynthesis).
	- Metabolic rate is proportional to oxygen consumption.
Each litre of oxygen consumed (at standard laboratory conditions,
25 degrees Celsius and one atmosphere (101kPa, 14.5 psi, 760 Torr)
pressure) liberates 4.82kcal or 20.15kJ.
        In physiology, the respiratory quotient (R) is the ratio of
carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed.
 Different energy substrates have different R values when oxidised :-
        carbohydrates 1.0, 4.1kcal/g
        fats 0.7, 9.3kcal/g
        protein 0.82, 4.1kcal/g
        average diet R=0.8

	A simple, if somewhat inaccurate rule of thumb could be as follows :-
One litre of oxygen at standard lab conditions is about 0.04 mole.
This amount of all the reactants is required to liberate
4.82kcal/20.15kJ.

	- Metabolic rate varies with the fourth power of absolute temperature
(living things behave like blackbody radiators).
Over the liquid temperature range of the solvents mentioned in the first
post (113-433 K) a 216-fold range of values is therefore possible.
	Creature core temperature (that of the most metabolically active
tissues) must be more than ambient to permit radiation of waste heat.
(Aside : The core temperature of birds and mammals ranges from
29-39 degrees Celsius).

Creature mass is approximately volume X solvent density :-
Solvent         Formula   Density of liquid (g/cc)

	Let us consider an example.
	The PCs capture a 0.5kg \'methane-breathing\' animal (about the size of a
rat) on an icy world (average surface temperature 240 K).
We shall assume the beast has a core temperature of 260 K.

Metabolic rate ~ (temp ratio)^4
For convenience we shall use a rat\'s core temperature for this
calculation :-

metabolic rate ~ (260/310)^4, or 0.49 that of a comparable mammal

metabolic rate in kJ/hour = 17.42 X (mass in kg)^0.75 for mammals

0.49 X 17.42 X (0.5)^0.75 = 0.59kJ/hr

This requires (0.59/20.15) L/hr of methane at 298K.

Using the ideal gas law, the volume of gas required at 240K is
 (0.59 X 240/(20.15 X 298)) = 0.024L per hour (24mLs).

N.B. The metabolic rate derived using the formula above is a basal one
(sitting quietly, reading, etc.) Metabolic rate can be increased by a
factor of eight with vigorous exercise
(e.g. cross country skiing).	

	Just for completeness :- what is the IR signature of our K\'kree
guard?
	K\'kree mass upwards of 500kg. Let\'s say he weighs in at 600kg
and behaves in physiological terms much like a terrestrial mammal.

Metabolic rate = 17.42 X (600)^0.75
               = 2111.8 kJ/hour
               = 586.6J/sec or 586.6W
In DSR terms, the K\'kree has a passive IR sig of -2.5.

* Organ Physiology :-
The development of organs is a consequence of specialisation of
function. This section aims to touch on certain important functional
considerations.

i. Digestive system :- processes foodstuffs, breaking the constituents
into smaller molecules to facilitate absorption. These absorbed
compounds are either stored or distributed to working tissues as
required.
	In man, food is chewed to increase its surface area ; saliva
is secreted to moisten the bolus and begin digestion of carbohydrate ;
the food bolus is then propelled into the stomach, where acid and pepsin
are released to facilitate protein digestion. Food is then propelled
into the small intestine where it is exposed to digestive enzymes
released from the pancreas and bile, which helps emulsify fats.
Absorption takes place predominantly in the small intestine ; waste
material is dehydrated in the large intestine and stored pending its
expulsion.
	Other animals have variations on this basic theme e.g. multiple
stomachs to facilitate the digestion of cellulose in cattle.
	Absorbed material is conveyed to the liver - the body\'s
metabolite processing centre and either stored (carbohydrates ->
glycogen), shipped (fats to fatty tissue, sugars to the brain, etc.) or
spent.

ii. Cardiorespiratory :- a transport system is required to move
nutrients and wastes to and from the tissues and to exchange gaseous
substances with the atmosphere (lungs) or surrounding fluid (gills).
	Creatures that rely on liquids or solid reactants (e.g. sulphur
or hydrogen peroxide \'breathers\') may have a combined digestive/
respiratory tract, as the volume of reactant required is small compared
to gases.
	Gas breathers will require a specialised lung or gill arrangement with
sufficient area to permit gas exchange (300 million
alveoli in man have a total surface area of 70m2). 
	A negative pressure gradient needs to be generated to draw air into the
lungs, which requires distensible lungs and a sealed muscle lined
compartment to hold them in.
	[The arrangement described for the K\'kree in G:T Aliens Module
2, where a muscle lined windpipe and the \'gut booster\' mechanism
(diaphragmatic pump) helps inflate two sets of lungs not
confined in a ribcage is plausible but inelegant].
	Very small creatures will have a network of interconnected air
pores or trabeculae to enable gas exchange by diffusion. The circulatory
system in insects is largely separate from the trabecular system,
serving mainly to shuttle nutrients from the gut.
	Specialised transport compounds will arise to convey
reactants in the case of the gaseous ones in most cases ; there is not
enough gas dissolved in a solvent to meet metabolic needs until very
low temperatures are attained (-100 Celsius or thereabouts).
	Haemoglobin is the oxygen transport compound in terrestrial
life ; it relies on an iron atom to co-ordinate with molecular oxygen
(and is the reason why blood is red).
	
[Aside : For fans of funny coloured blood :-
sulphated haemoglobin is brown,
reduced (met)haemoglobin is blue.
Copper-based compounds will be blue, green or red ;
Cobalt-based compounds will be red, pink or blue.]

Blood, whatever its chemical constitution (nitric acid as solvent?),
requires at least one pump to maintain its circulation. Multiple hearts
are frequently encountered in science fiction ; as long as the pumps are
co-ordinated so as to guarantee forward flow, all is well (as anyone who
has worked with circulatory assist devices in people will attest).
	Terrestrial life tends to have one primary heart and an \'informal\'
system of pumping driven by surrounding muscles - vasomotion.
  	 
iii. Renal
The internal environment of an organism tends to remain stable despite
changes in nutrient flows, etc.
	In terrestrial life, the kidneys act primarily to regulate body fluid
composition and blood pressure, as a second level of control on
acid-base balance (carbon dioxide elimination from the lungs is the
primary controller), and eliminate nitrogenous (urea is one of the waste
products of protein breakdown) and other non-volatile wastes.

iv. Nervous
Command, control, and integration.
Feedback loops are a common motif in physiology :-
- - stimulus
- - interpret sensory inputs
- - determine appropriate response
- - relay instructions to effector systems
- - stimulus

The nervous system relies on electrical and chemical transmission of
information in order to rapidly adapt to a changing environment.
It displays plasticity - neurones will change the way they are
interconnected in response to stimuli.

Some sensory modalities :- vision/photoception ; galvanic (the electric
field organs of some fish) ; hearing (pressure receptor) ; taste and
smell (chemical analysis) ; touch (pressure, heat, cold, pain) ;
proprioception (joint and limb position) ; vestibular system
(accelerometry) 

v. Endocrine
Hormones are chemicals that mediate longer term changes in organ
function. These are under negative feedback control (so that when the
target condition is achieved the secretion of the stimulatory or
inhibitory hormone is decreased).
	The relevant glands are distributed throughout the body ;
canonically, the Hivers have one master gland located under the brain?

vi. Immune
The organism needs to protect itself from microbial and parasitic
threats. Recognition of \'self\' and \'not-self\' cells is an ancient
feature ; most worms have a developed immune system.
	Surveillance is conducted, as always, at borders - in the gut,
respiratory tract and the skin.

Body plans, and a little about evolution, plants and ecology.

Actually I said "on a *conventional* battlefield".

You know, the big area of mixed terrain, inhabited by big, organized
military units, heavy weapons, armored vehicles, artillery support?

IMO, these will be relatively rare - the Imperial military only has a major
war once a generation or so, the rest of the time they spend on
internal policekeeping. A Marine will probably see a lot of action, but
I\'ll bet it\'s more often of the small-scale variety. 

Is BD the appropriate uniform for counter-insurgency work? I don\'t mean
the final assault on the main rebel stronghold, I mean the day-to-day work?

All I disagree with here is the use of maximum destruction. Controlled 
force is the key. If the marines land where a civil disorder is 
happening and kill everyone and destroy everything, that will 
spawn hatred of the Imperial forces and distrust for them. They MUST 
be more controlled. If not, call them stormtroopers and play star 
wars.

The problem there is that one becomes the other. Those retired marines 
will have come from the active duty. Most folks want characters will 
what they consider useful skills. They way you seem to be angling, very

few, if any, of the posters here on the TML would be satisfied. 
Why make it so that most users must handwave the characters to what 
is playable? You will propose the book as you want, and that is as 
it should be. However, I urge you to think about what we have said. 
Some kind of optional rules set perhaps or a varient set of templates.
If you don\'t, you can be certain that the most folks will stray from 
your vision of cannon in that area.

My appologies if this offends.

Now wouldn\'t this get the IISS\'s attention: a plague breaks out on a low

2300AD is simply the revised edition of Traveller 2300. It was apparently

Correction. I made an assumption in stating that most folks would 
differ. I withdraw that line of the statement.

I like this idea myself, and will probably implement it IMTU.

Now, to calm down the profit-hungry private doctor ships, there will probably be
an organization like the Red Cross that does the same service, but charges far
less.

That would be about right. So getting back to Traveller, you submit your
jobs in JCL (Job Control Language), which usually some guy who knows 
specifically about MVS has written for you, and an operator watches the
console and  varies the i/o devices you need on and off line.

Not what is happening on a Beowulf. To imagine later TL8 computers used
by free traders between Earth / Luna / Mars / the international space
station, there would be a graphical display of the planets, you would 
click where you want to go, and some sexy algorithm will determine what
gravity wells you should use as slingshots.

About as ridiculous as modern USMC pilots keeping up their M-16A2
qualification.
You learn it because every Marine learns it. Someday, that Marine fighter
jock may be forced into a position where he has to suit and fight a
desperate rearguard action, just like a USMC F/A-18 pilot could find
himself leading a bunch of jarheads. 
In the template as written, the mandatory investment is a whopping 2 points
out of 140 for an average campaign. This gives you DX worth of the skill,
or Battlesuit (TL12)-10 for an average human.

Bingo! We have a winner. The marines and Navy are part and parcel of the
Emperor\'s will. The Marines depend on the Navy for the vast majority of
their support and supply, and even to haul them around. The Imperial
Marine Force is nowhere near as autonomous as the USMC.

- ---- quote ----
Harnessing Nuclear Energy On A Truly Tiny Scale

Extremely small amounts of radioactive material already perform
functions in smoke detectors, photocopiers, pacemakers and other
devices. Now a trio of University of Wisconsin-Madison engineers
envision tiny batteries turning a single microscopic gear...

Known as micro-electromechanical structures, or MEMS devices,
they tend to be smaller than a width of human hair, about 60 to
70 microns, Blanchard said. Because of their small size, they can
perform extremely precise functions in applications such as
medical equipment, environmental management and automobiles...
- ---- endquote ----

What\'s really wild is that such devices can possibly be used in
the lubricants of machinery to sense when maintenance is needed,
according to the article.

Even if you\'re not running a G:T campaign, this can be additional
color for characters with high-TL Engineering/Mechanical skills.
Just another example of how to use nano-tech in Traveller without
it overwhelming a campaign.

This sounds to me like politically-correct historical revisionism...
The politically-correct of today are so horrified by the idea of the
use of atomic weapons that they gloss over the reasons for their use
in 1945: there was a war on. I am appalled by the peaceniks who every 
August 8 stage a protest shouting "No more Hiroshimas" -- I\'ll agree 
to that so long as they agree to the idea of "No more Pearl Harbors".
(The ironic part of all this: I\'m a Canadian.)


In an effort to avoid another flamewar, an ObTrav:

The Imperium has been around for over 1100 years in the "present" of 
most Traveller campaigns. What kind of "historical revisionism" is there
in the year 1120 about past events? The Solomani Rim War and some of the
early pacification campaigns are probably good starting points... 

eg, What does a schoolchild in the Imperium learn about the Solomani
Rim War, and how does it differ from what a schoolchild in the Solomani
Confederacy learns?>>

As I remember in DGP\'s Solomani/Aslan supplement the Confederations
official name for the Solomani Rim War is the War for Solomani liberty or
the War for Independence.  Although the Imperium doesn\'t officially
recognize the Solomani Confederation it still has 2/3 of its prewar size.

I don\'t know, when I am browsing on the web, I consciously avoid Geocities
sites unless the content sounds too interesting. Even then, those pop-up\'s
can drive you NUTS! Sometimes it seems if you let the first page load
totally, the pop-up can be closed without it coming back on going to a
deeper page. Sometimes. Pop-ups suck. ;)

This sounds a lot like FGU\'s Freedom Fighters.  FF takes the prize as the
most detailed and time consuming chargen I\'ve ever seen.  One character to
the better part of 8 hours...Then again, I love detail.  One player had a
severe attack of the stupids and got himself killed three hours into the
first session...

Well, one *big* difference between artillery and bombers is that the
bomber crews *see* the target, even if they don\'t see the people there.
And since a *lot* of the targets were cities, I\'d says it\'s not *that*
big a jump. After all, one city looks much like another from the air.

I assume they mean close enough for water to exist as a liquid.

Sure, but you are talking *really* primitive. Single-celled sludge.

Warm enough depends on a lot of things. The mix of water & ammonia for
one. Pressure will play a part also. I don\'t have the phase diagrams
for a water/ammonia mixture. But I understand that they get really odd.

Check out Hal Clement\'s book "Star Light" for an example of a
water/ammonia world.

Actually, the "odd colored bodily fluids" isn\'t that strange. Even on
Terra we\'ve got examples of several chemicals *other* than hemoglobin
being used for oxygen transport. And they are all markedly colored.

You missed the most "obvious" prehensile appendage. At least it\'s
on\\bvious to folks who\'ve spent much time around cattle. A bull\'s penis
is *very* prehensile. 

Of course, there *are* evolutionary disadvantahes to having damage to
your manipulatory appendage interfere with your ability to reproduce.

And I want to see the look on the player\'s face when he finds out what
he just "shook" when greeting the alien ambassador. :-)

Yep. Even a "typical" tarantula has a body that\'s far bigger than any
insect can have. And there are spiders with bodies even larger. The
infamous "bird-eating" spider comes to mind.

BTW, one of the big limits on exoskeletons is a combination of lack of
leverage as the limbs get larger, and problems with load bearing at
joints. There\'s just too much "stuff" going through the joints.

Uhm... slight detail problem here. Parthogenesis can produce *female*
offspring. It can\'t produce *male* offspring (the mother doesn\'t have
any Y chromosomes).

ROFL!

You\'ve just given me an idea for an *evil* pysch warfare weapon. 

We all know about the "bouncing betty" aka "castrator mine". 

Well, picture a mine intended to be deployed in the "right" sort of
terrain. It has simple chemical and moisture sensors. It waits for the
unique signature of a troopie taking "the pause that refreshes" and
homes in on the source (alternately, fires a small explosive projectile
at the source). Obviously, a much smaller than normal charge will do,
since body armor won\'t be a factor.

Deployed properly, you could have the troops too scared to take a dump
or a leak outside their perimeter. This tends to disrupt patrols
considerably. 

Even nastier is a biological weapon. A sort of tick, chigger, or other
small to medium sized insect that responds to the same "cues" and leaps
at the target and starts *burrowing*. It can be species specific, or
perhaps respond to differing chemical signatures caused by differing
diets. So the natives are safe and only the imported troops are at risk.

Yes, these are "sick" weapons. But they serve their purpose admirably.
They make troops *very* unwilling to go out in the field.

Nope. If you have enough 4 sided dice you\'ll find that you *cannot*
construct an icosahedron out of tetrahedrons. There will be gaps.
Significant ones. 

Tetrahedra cannot be used to "fill" space. Cubes can, and so can a
*mix* of tetrahedra and octahedra. No other regular polyhedrons will
"fill space".

Nice idea, but as I note above it doesn\'t really work. 

If I ever go to 3-d "maps" they\'ll either be computerized (possibly
even using "3-D" glasses) or they\'ll be *models*. Basicly, small
plastic beads on *really* fine wire. Use thicker, painted wire to
indicate X-boat routes. Then you can pick up the "map" and look at it
from different angles.

But more viscous also means that it\'s *harder* to move.

Actually, six legs *always* require more energy than 4 legs. Think

Wow.  Yet more rather silly tech.  Passive sonar is only useful if you\'re going
swimming, and not very useful there with that little range.  A geophone is
useful for detecting heavy objects on the ground.  Hm...oh that\'s really
relevant in traveller at TL 9+.  As for the gravscanner -- that\'s too low range

LOL!!

This reminds me of bubblejet printers.  Supplied very cheaply (often free
with some systems), but when you have to replace consumables -- Holy
Snapping Duck Shiiiiit!

ObTrav:  What is the upkeep of BD?  Do local governments have a choice in
forces used on their worlds?

"Yes, I understand this civil war is getting out of hand and disrupting
vital supplies manufactured locally.  Yes, yes, I understand the Imperium

sir, another few weeks is neither here nor there... I do not want Imperial
Marines anywhere near my world!  Send me the army or we will oppose the

Yes, I understand such a threat shouldn\'t mean a lot if the Imperium has
chosen to move... but it may have certain political ramifications that those
in need of rescue oppose being rescued this way -- The truth being stranger
than fiction credo can also apply to RPG\'s.

And the reason for not wanting IM\'s to come to the rescue?  Cost, the
facelessness of IM\'s in their suits, fear, hated by the general public, and
their habit of overkill...

In comic style... I\'m assuming the power doesn\'t run out until after the

Ahhhh yes, the Crunch Gun.  Based on the 14.5mm Norwiegan(?) anti-tank
rifle.  They used skis to trek it around the countryside.  Perfect answer
to the classic smash and grab TNE scenario ("There\'s a *hole* in his
F*cking Armor!").

<Buzzzz> Thank you for playing.

The Imperial Navy logistics infrastructure dictates that the BD Marine
trooper carry a weapon that does not require resupply, such as an energy
weapon or a laser weapon (which is also an energy weapon I guess).

Carrying something that takes real ammo brings up all sorts of potential
resupply difficulties.  The best course of action is to use weapons which
do not require ammo.  Exceptions, of course, exist.

Back to the tiny, turret mounted radar guided point defense gun on board
BD.  I thought this was a freaky idea when it first was floated.  Then when
it was published I nearly ruined a keyboard.

I felt then and still feel now that Battle Dress is stealthy, and the
"active defense" of a BD trooper is to kill the GL gunner before he is in
range, or not provide a target after he is in range.  Battle Dress is a
very capable tool for a soldier to have, not a cure-all for the dangers of
the battlefield.

The power required to constantly run a grav belt at TL15 or less makes the
image of the BD trooper constantly hovering a few centimeters above the
ground unlikely.  On the other hand, battle dress is not particularly
susceptable to most mines, except those specifically designed to defeat it.
I think vehiclular mines would *not* be set off by BD (The weight is a lot,
but not what the lightest military vehicles weigh, and more sophisticated
mines will be designed *not* to go off for BD, but to wait for real
vehicles) and most anti-personnel mines are shrapnel makers to which the BD
is generally immune.  The purpose built anti-BD mine has a thin penetrator
set vertically about 6" below the surface, a pressure trigger (that
activates when the pressure goes on) sets off a small charge which drives
the \'spike\' right up through the foot of the BD trooper and hopefully
through the leg and body as well.  Such a mine would be set for about #400,
more than the largest man and most animals, but less than the average BD
suit.

Note that the materials must not be metal, and the mines cannot give off
any heat (even batteries give off trace amounts).  Otherwise detecting them
would be much too simple a matter.

All this is, of course, IMTU.  All the usual disclaimers intended to
prevent flame wars apply.

Yep. "Statically stable" means that if you *froze* the motion at any
point, the critter wouldn\'t fall over. "Static" equals "not moving". 

Insects are statically stable because they use their six legs as a
*pair* of tripods. So, for instance, they\'ll have the front and back
right legs and the mid left leg "planted" while they move the other
three to a new position. Once they are in position, the insect shifts
its center of gravity from being over the first tripod of legsd to
being over the second. Once it\'s over the second tripod, the first set
of three legs is free to move. But at no point is the insect in an
unstable position.

Dynamicly stable is stuff that\'s stable *only* because it is moving.
For example, when you walk, your center of gravity is ahead of your
feet. You are continually "falling" forward, but placing your feet so
as to keep from completing the fall.

My (somewhat buried) point was that modern "reporters", especially TV
reporters don\'t *want* long, complex answers. They want a quick, simple
answer. A "soundbite". 

Think back over the new broadcasts you\'ve watched recently.

Keep in mind the fact that "native platinum" (ie loose nuggets of the
metal) are actually a *mix* of platinum, iridium, osmium, etc. As such
they are *damned* hard. 

Platinum-iridium alloys are used for certain measurement standards
*because* they are so hard to deform. And osmium-iridium alloys are
used in the Osmiroid pens because it takes next to forever to dull the
pen tip (paper being *very* abrasive).

It\'s like this. The period of an orbit is determined by the length of
the semi-major-axis. For a circle, this is the radius. For an ellipse,
it\'s half the long axis. 

The *perfect* "drop it into the sun" orbit is a degenerate ellipse (aka
a straight line) with a focus at each end. So the semi-major axis is
1/2 the distance to the center of the star. 

Kepler\'s third law says that for bodies orbiting the same primary the
semi-major axis cubed divided by the period squared equals a constant. 

Thus:

	1^3     .5^3
       ---- = ----  
        1^2      P^2

         1    .793
        ---- = ----
         1     P^2

        P^2 = .793
        P = .89

So the period of the "junk" will be roughly 89% of the period of the
planet it was dumped from. So if you dumped it from Earth on Jan 1,
it\'d be back at that point in Earth\'s orbit about 325 days later
(around Nov 21).

> Could this cloud become a permanent or semi-perm system feature?

Unlikely. It\'ll be expanding and dissipating. And every periastron more
of the material will either be capturing by the star or driven into
even more divergent orbits by light pressure and stellar wind effects.

It\'d also be *really* small, unless you were accumulating truly
*awesome* amounts of wastes. Consider that a measly 1 km diameter
asteroid has a volume of 523,598,775.6 cubic meters and a mass of over
2 *billion* tons. So your waste shipment is going to be pretty trivial
compared with that. And that\'s a *minor* body in a star system.

Actually, most of those variables "drop out". That is, they don\'t
really affect the situation that much.

If you do it right, you are approaching "head on", so those effects
would merely delay the impact a *tiny* bit. They can\'t give it a
sideways component unless it is *already* moving sifeways. If it *is*
then they\'ll magnify the effects somewhat.

"Deadly Litter" by James White. Alas, he made an *incedibly* stupid
error. He didn\'t understand the concept of "escape velocity". 

Since the ships in question were "constant boost" ships, even if the
acceleration was fairly low, the velocities of the "litter" were in the
hundreds of kilometers per second range dut\\ring much of the trip. And
solar escape velocity at Earth orbit is ony about 40 km/sec. 

Thus, the junk would be on hyperbolic trajectories and *never* return. 
For that matter, stuff at velocities *close* to system escape could
take *millienia* to come back.

There *aren\'t* any "stationary objects". And at the velocities
involved, you don\'t deflect, you splash.

Gravity sling manuevers get used all the time. But they trade initial
fuel use for *long* travel times. Given Traveller tech levels, it\'s not
worth it. Too many more things that could go wrong.

<interesting scenarios skipped>

Here are some scenarios based on historical details (and in one case on
an *actual* occurence!).

Planet A has just started processing petroleum to make kerosene for
lamps. This results in a lot of tar that they use on roads, and a bunch
of distillate that\'s *too* volatile to use. They are just dumping it.
Along comes a merchant who offers to haul it off for a small fee. He
hauls it to plent B which has just started using internal combustion
engines. He\'s able to *sell* the gasoline at an incredible profit. :-)

An offworlder is going around offering to re-roof various buildings for
*free*. He\'s got a bunch of mumbo jumbo about why, but after he finally
gets someone to accept his offer, and the new roof proves to be good,
he\'s swamped with customers. He only makes the offer to *some* places
though. He\'s nice enough to haul off and dispose the old roofing.

What\'s *realy* going on? The buildings have lead sheet roofing (quite
common in some areas and periods). He found out that one particular
lead mine in this area had a *high* silver content in the lead. It\'d
gone unnoticed due to primitive assaying and refining techniques of the
time. He\'s tracked down the places that were roofed with lead from this
mine. He bought enough pure lead for the first roofing job. He then
refinined the silver out of the old roofing, and was able to make a
profit even though he did have to buy extra lead to replace the silver.

This actually happened in Europe!

Offworlders buy up a bunch of old, worked out mines, including the
tailings piles and other places contaminated by tailings and ore
processing. And they start cleaning up the mess!

The gimmick is that the tailings contain *valuable* amounts of other
metals. So does the mine. There are places in the American West where
the same mine has been worked for as many as *four* different metals. 
It\'s also *routine* to re-process the "sludge" left behind by several
refining processes, as the process has concentrated metals that
wouldn\'t otherwise be worth going after. 

And with modern bio-tech, a lot of the "toxic" materials leaching from
old mines and facilities is actually a recoverable *resource*. Add in
the avialability of stuff like fusion "torches" at higher TLs and
reprocessing mine/smelter wastes will be a major industry. So will
mining old garbage dumps. 

The problems will be the organo-metallic soups left behind by some
chemical industries. But I expect that *somewhere* someone will have a
use for even those. And if not, it\'s still fairly simple to concentrate
them and ship them to a holding facility on a moon or asteroid.

Sorry, but given that such moons are almost certainly tidally locked
*to the GG*, then to a first approximation, their solar day is equal to
their orbital period around the gas giant. 

Check any reference about the length of Luna\'s day for diagrams and
references. 

If the moon *isn\'t* tidally locked, *then* things get interesting. But
that\'s unlikely.

It\'s possible that a 2:3 *is* stable, I\'d have to try running things
thru. I know that x:1 resonances *aren\'t* stable.

Either the Motie Engineer they first encounter or one of the

computer. One of the ship\'s officers states that it\'s not *possible,

Actually, the increased capabilities are inherent in the Langston
field, as the humans figure out how to do it (much later) from nothing
more than observations. "All" they did was make it able to expand the
field as the absorbed energy increased, thus giving it more area to
radiate away the absorbed energy.

They\'ve got an "instinct level" understanding of machinery and
electronics. That wouldn\'t necessarily be "magic", just a *lot* of
selective breeding plus (perhaps) some genetic engineering.

And while they aren\'t necessarily intelligent, I have to wonder if they
don\'t have something similar to a hive mind when they are in large
groups.

Frankly, humanity *doesn\'t* have any experience with a
symbiote/competitor that isn\'t intelligent but *can* not only use but
*make* tools. They wouldn\'t have to be as bright as a chimp to be a
*major* hazard.

Also, there\'s little evidence of Motie genetic engineering
capabilities. They seem to be *very* weak in the bio-sciences.

Sorry, wrong calculation. 

What you need is *not* to get them to form a cell. That comes *far*
later in evolution. What\'s needed is for them to assemble into a
moloecule capable of replicating itself (with some errors allowed). 

Once *that* happens, evolution begins. You get variants of the molecule
competing for available resources. The ones that work best will
proliferate at the cost of others. *Eventually* you\'ll get groups of
molecules working together, and finally, cells.

BTW, there\'s some evidence that the surfaces of various clays form a
sort of template that encourages formation of amino acid chains and the
like.

It\'s *specifically* mentioned that NDs can clean up fallout. So the
ability to *permanently* destroy radio-isotopes is canonical.

And from the descriptions, they work by either speeding up or slowing
down nuclear reactions (including decay of isotopes).

So to clean up after a nuke, you just increase the decay rate
drasticly. Thus will result in a fair amount of heat as all those
alphas, betas, and gammas come off the radioactive materials. You just
keep the rate to something that\'ll not cause excessive heating (too
much heat and you have boiling groundwater and induced updradfts, both
of which can carry contamination out of the area).

Slowing down the rate is useful for storing things like short-lived
isotopes (including those Californium mini-nukes), but not for anything
else.

IN CT they are *explicitly* described as staying on the vector the ship
had when it launched them. So if you manuever, you leave them behind. 

You use them when you want to use them. Given that you\'ve got limited
numbers of canisters, I\'d only use them if I was running directly away
from the firing ship, or if I had a reason to not change course.

Alas, this ios being toned down. I\'ve heard reports that DIs can no
longer make recruits "drop and give me 50" from drop[ping their rifle.
In fact, assigning push ups as punishment apparently requires cinsent
of the recruit now!

I got this from some marines griping in another newsgroup.

While it isn\'t confirmed, it\'s all too likely given the serious
civilian/military differences. :-(

        I ref R.Talsorian\'s "Cyberpunk 2020" RPG in alternation to my CT
game.  CP2020 has one of the most reasonable POV\'s on BD (which it calls
Powered Armor, or PA Suits), including the issue that mecha are basically
impossible due to weight vs terrain issues.
        Here are some excerpts from the "Maximum Metal" supplement for
CP2020.  This information is reproduced without permission and is not an
attempt to challenge copyright or reserved rights.  Information in square

        [Underlying System to handle the "work" part of a PA Suit is a
modified linear frame]
        A linear frame resembles a suit of contoured metal body armor. The
frame is grafted onto your body, while its systems are directly neurolinked
to your muscles and bones. Linear frames are designed to take over a
percentage of the load, while leaving you enough "work" to allow you to
gauge how much you\'re lifting and maintain control of the weight.

        For example, if you exert enough force to lift ten pounds, the
linear frame provides no more power than would be required to move its own
bulk. if you lift a hundred pounds, the linear frame splits the difference,
lifting 20% of this mass so that you lift 80 lbs. If you lift 500 pounds,
the linear frame takes 80% (400lbs), leaving you to lift 100lbs. At the top
end of the scale (2,000 lbs for Linear Q), the frame lifts 80% of the
weight, while you lift only 200lbs.
        [Here is the answer to the "what about the guy walking in a starship
corridor"...  he doesn\'t feel any different than being out of his suit,
since the suit is just dealing with *extra* load, not what he or she can
handle.]

        Why powered armor? Veteran CP players know the advantages of
strolling through a combat zone in MetalGear(R), an all-body exoskeleton
armor which provides 25SP of protection. 
        [In Cp2020, people *die* at 20pts of damage.  a 5.56mm will do 5d6;
7.62mm will do 6d6+3.  This stuff makes you Superman to small arms fire]
        Now, imagine that the good folks at Arasaka, Militech, OrbitalAir,
and Zetatech are not satisfied with 25SP of armor-, that some of their
personnel are too highly trained to be cheaply expended; that some ventures
are too covert to leave their own dead bodies around: or, that a battle zone
is so hot that a conventional soldier cannot conceivably fulfill the
objectives. Suppose that you need soldiers who can walk around in 35SP,
50SP, or even more armor, whose primary weapons are capable of clearing out
dozens of personnel, AFV, and hardened installations. Suppose, that by
spending a little real money now, you can save the expenditure of lots of
real money later. Powered Armor. The simple answer to these and many other
fine questions. Not cheap, not subtle, but hard to stop - very hard to stop.

a locally managed troubleshooting force which can rapidly react to
sistuations in such a fashion that the Bad Guys think twice about even
starting up.  Further, the Marines are there to buy time for the Army to
moblize and redeploy in overwhelming numbers.  BD/ PA is an awesome force
multiplier.]

        The design sequence for Max Metal is nice and straightforward.
Battlefield endurance for a suit and wearer is 24hrs.  You can ramp up the
suit easily with extra battery packs if you don\'t mind turning over option
spaces to that.  The wearer, on the other hand, is more complicated to
stretch for endurance.
        Control systems on the best PA suits are by Direct Neural Interface
connections to VR inputs based on sensors.  You don\'t feel the suit, it
isn\'t in your way, and the sensors are the world.  Any real suit is fully
NBCW proofed.
        A "classic" PA Suit from the CP2020 millieu is the Miltitech Commando:

        Commando Highlights
        945Kg   
        Reaction Bonus of +4/20
        STR 35 (Punch 4d10, Kick 6d10)
        Cost 108,306Eb (1EB = 2USD)
        Armor 65pts
        Internal/ Mounted Weapons:  R Arm - 20mm Cannon, L Arm M31-PA,
Ribbon Canister, BFC-4, BSP Variety pack, 1-H Hvy Blade
        Carried Weapons:  40mm Auto-GL, Relodable ATGM
        Electronics: VR, Radio, A/V recorder, Laser Detector
        Misc:  Smoke Canisters, Auto-Doctor, EMP Sponge, Mutliple Reloads
for all weapons and defenses

        A LAW rocket will effectively do 8d10 (40pts avg, armor ignores,
operator annoyed), an RPG-A will effectively do 12d10 (60pts, armor creaks,
operator hoses you in case you get lucky next time).  A 75mm MBT cannon will
splatter the suit and its wearer all over the landscape.

        The point?  Glad you asked.
        Ignoring the GT-Commando suit, and looking at the more reasonable BD
which the CP2020 Militech Commando is a a fair representation of from my
POV, I cannot fathom why an empire that will build a Tigress *would* *not*
equip every marine they had with this kind of gear.  The communications
times mean that when the word gets to the garrison and the garrison gets to
the deployment site, the $hit hit the airlock a month ago...  which means
that the $hit disturbers have to be *soooooo* scared about what is going to
happen when the IM shows up that they don\'t *dare* actually do anything.
        The IM with CES and Guass are rapid-reaction infantry who you can
slaughter as easily as any other well-trained infantry with CES and Guass.
Not very scary in the short term.  A BD trooper who you have to use tanks
against to kill are another freakin\' story...  200 marines land and *you*
now have find 200 tanks to play tag with them in urban centers and in the
woods.  Depending on your design system, the BD man has just as good odds of
one-shot-one-kill on your tanks as you do on him.
        Except he can hide.  He can snipe from building tops.  He can fit
down alleys.  He can fight you from everywhere you can\'t follow.
        Imperial Marines and Battle Dress.  It Just Makes Sense.
        So, about that little insurrection of yours....  Are you gonna want
to make enough noise that the Imperium gets involved?  Nope.  Result:  A
nice, "quiet" Imperium, just the way the Emperor, the Moot and the Corps
like it.

        JMHO, YMMV, YAAA, BYE.

folks to a comic book limited series of a few years ago: Shadow Empires by
Chris Moeller.  It follows the leader of a battalion(?) built around a
squad (platoon?) of what is known as "Iron" in this TU.  It\'s beautifully
rendered (fully painted) and has a nifty politico-socio-religious
background.  Cool visual realizations of BD and other personal armor,
weapons, vehicles, ships, etc.  I\'d also take a look at another series of
his, more recent: Sheva\'s War.  This story is set a few subsectors over
and follows a noblewomen in charge of troops when the stuff hits the fan.
Interesting take here is on psionics--not pyrotechnically strong, but
subtle and strictly the purview of the nobility.  Also fully painted. 

When it comes to Xenobio/psych: A little while ago I read Ring of Swords
by E. Arnason.  (No real spoilers ahead.)  It\'s set about a century from
now and humanity has made contact with another interstellar race; it has
not gone all that well--there has been some shooting.  Surprise: they are
REALLY similar to us, as in they are mammals, bipedal, etc.  Problem:  their
psychology/culture, especially their attitudes towards sex and
reproduction, are so dissimilar that they can\'t decide if we are human or
not, that is, not animals.  Up and down as a novel, but some interesting
ideas. 

Etiquette question: I have some old CT and MT books (mostly DGP) that I
want to sell.  Thought I\'d give people on this list a chance before I put
them up on Ebay.  Have I said too much already for politeness? 

Judge\'s Guild is back, and some of their Traveller stuff is available

And just _which_ branch secured the building with the greatest long term

are reasonably happy to have them there...

This IS  a trade centered Imperium, after all ;-)

Wow.  Yet more rather silly tech.  Passive sonar is only useful if you\'re going
swimming, and not very useful there with that little range.  A geophone is
useful for detecting heavy objects on the ground.  Hm...oh that\'s really
relevant in traveller at TL 9+.  As for the gravscanner -- that\'s too low range
to be worth _anything_ (it was also unclear whether the tech is actually
available in GT, which is why the grav tanks don\'t have gravscanners.  They hav
enough waste space to add one, though).

Which is why Marine training takes a year.  Eight weeks for the basics,
then several months learning to use the equipment.  Even then, an Armsman/3
is considered to be barely qualified to walk a straight line.

It\'s important to remember that in the Traveller universe battledress has
been known and used for over two thousand years.  It\'s not like the Marines
of 1120 are receiving something new and precious, they\'re just the latest
users in a *very* long line.  The SGII time line goes barely 300 years
forward, IIRC.

Imperial Army Engineers, which get a big space in a section on "Ongoing
Military Campaigns."

While I\'ve ben arguing in favor of my BD Marines, I agree that a straight
combat unit makes for lousy role-play.  So I\'ve included some suggestions
on basing a campaign on an Engineer or Medical unit.  These guys tend to do
more in peacetime, and have the disadvantage that their not a bunch of
combat monsters.

Yes, he said Medical.  M*A*S*H in space.  Think about it, when they weren\'t
being utterly silly they got some good plots in.  To steal one:

While supporting a Counter-Insurgency mission, the staff notices that a
united of mixed Vargr/Human troops is taking casualties that are
disproportionately high among the Vargr.  A little detective work shows
that the commander of the unit lost his wife to Vargr corsairs many years
ago.  Problem, the guy is a bloody hero, outranks the PC commander, and is
a minor noble to boot.  How do we get this butcher away from his troops?

While the small group of Marines who were first on station wait for the
Army to arrive, yes.

Let\'s assume that the People\'s Democratic Liberation Front of Judea is
struggling to throw off the Imperial yoke.  In doing this, they have
triggered an Imperial intervention (they\'ve spread their brand of terrorism
to other systems, and have severely slowed trade.)

The nearest u it is the scattered companies of a Task Force, which are
notified and diverted to Judea.  At the same time, Army Command starts
making plans to move a Division or two of Lift Infantry to the world if it
becomes necessary.

The Marines are given the job of guarding the Consulate, the starport, and
acting as a Mike Force for the local troops who are hunting out rebel
strongholds.  The Marines are going to be in BD for two reasons: they are
there to project Imperial power, and they cannot afford to take casualties.

If the problem looks to be long term (i.e: the rebels don\'t collapse in the
first few weeks), then the Army will come in for the long term solution.  A
Lift Infantry Division has the assets to conduct a long term campaign, and
to provide the internal security needed in the aftermath.  The army grunts
will be in CES with gauss rifles.  There will also be a hell of lot more of
them.

1.  Everyone is judging this based on a *single* proposed disad that would
be *available*, not mandatory for Marine characters.  

2.  The mandatory investment in Battlesuit takes up 1.4% of the average
character\'s pool of points at character generation.  The total package of
skills and advantages costs about 80 points, and has many options built in.
 This leaves about 60 points for customizing your character to your heart\'s
content.

3.  The most wonderful book _Star Mercs_ contains eleven templates for
*former* military types, including naked, manly-man infantry.

4.  The book I am trying to write is the guide to the active duty Army and
Marines.  The aforementioned _Star Mercs_ is for retired types.

5.  _Ground Forces_, if I write it, will contain far more than simple
templates.  It will give the reader an idea on how the Army and Marines are
run, how they fight, their equipment, and a host of other informational
pieces.  One more time: It\'s for people who might like to run/play *active
duty* games.

6.  Like any other game book, if you don\'t like what I write, ignore it!
The game police are not going to come to your door if I see print and you
decide that the Imperial Marines are actually a dance troupe who use
interpretive ballet to shame their foes into surrendering.

At which point the Imperial representative (with a small smile [or
his/her/its race\'s equivalent] playing across his/her/its face) says,
"Of _course_ we didn\'t plan on sending in the Imerial Marines!  Army
troops are even now en route to restore order."  [thinking to self:
"Interesting that the nearest unit available for deployment was the
1199th Jump Infantry Regiment, Imperial Army, and _they_ have
battledress _too_.  How..._unfortunate_ for the troublemakers...."]

Never forget that, even if the Imperial Marines are universally
BD-capable, this doesn\'t imply that they are the _only_ BD-equipped
forces.

	Just a thought, but has anyone figured out the ground pressure of this

a tank.

The key is "relatively".  This is one of the significant issues
in the field, particularly for amino acids.  Drying cycles is
one of the mechanisms that have been invoked, but it is not
entirely satisfactory.

This is the matter of some debate and I wouldn\'t hazzard to guess whether
this is accepted be more people in the field or not.  It certainly
has its share or detractors.  I may also be that _none_ of these
came first.  There is evidence that amphiphiles may have formed,
or been delivered by meteorites, first and formed "protocells"
(see the posters discussion on cell membranes).  These then
contained reactions and may even have had catalytic effects.

This is only one theory.  We know so little about this that many
theories abound.  It is also possible that life didn\'t go entire
to on isomer until _after_ life started.  It is entirely possible
that protiens need to be made out of one isomer, or the other,
to fold right.  Life could have started with both isomers and died
out.

Note: no one has made enzymes out of right handed amino acids.  It
is not impossible that left handed ones simply work better.  This
is probably better for Traveller because it explains why, since
everyone is alway trading food around, most species can eat alien
food.

Point on minimizing casualties noted...I was thinking more in terms of,
"How many hours straight can a troopie use his battledress before he
has to take it offline for X hours of maintenance?". If downtime hours per
uptime hours are too great, the small Marine contingent may have to
ration their BD usage. Do all of them wear the BD while doing a standard
security sweep, or just the point man and the guys with the heavy weps?

Not a problem if BD maintenance is trivial, nor if the Imperium sends
along a lot of spares.

BD maintenance profile isn\'t a problem for orbital assault or starship 
defense/starship boarding situations. In either case, you know
pretty far in advance exactly when the op will start, and it should 
be over pretty quickly (at least for your unit). These are the prime
missions Marines seem equipped for in GT (all BD, all energy weps),
IMO Marines will often find themselves in situations with an entirely
different pace and duration of operations.

Or you can have a group that sets up small hospitals on "technologically
challenged" planets throughout the Imperium. They use technologies that may
be cheaper in scale, but less portable. Stuff like limb cloning, maybe even
extensive anagathic regimens[1]. In fact, that might be one of the reasons
why anagathics are so expensive. Various private organizations might funnel
off the excess profit and use it to help those who are less fortunate.

[1] My own version of anagathics differs from the traditional canon view.
Living longer isn\'t a matter of simply popping a pill every once in awhile
and stopping the aging process. There\'s high-end genetic engineering, which
has certain distinct advantages, but sometimes results in strange physical
or mental side effects. There\'s also cybernetics, but you can only go so far
in the Imperium with this. After all, too much cybernetic tech and you\'re no
longer a citizen. In my own Third Imperium, this rule was political. It was
a method employed to remove certain extremely conservative (and long-lived)
nobles in the moot and to marginalize their possible influence. There\'s also
the use of nanotechnology to stop the aging process. Then, there are more
traiditional medical technologies, drugs, therapy, minor implants, etc.

I\'d say, a good *bit* of genetic engineering, to make sure the necessary 
memory engrams get reproduced in every generation.  And the more instinct you 
genetically wire into them, the *less* room there is for intelligence, to the 
point where they can *barely* understand simple commands.

Accent on *SEEM*.  They have this annoying habit of hiding things they don\'t 
want outsiders to see.  Also, the modifications were made something on the 
order of a *million* years previous; once made, the technology doesn\'t have 
to survive, just its results.

What is canon as to how sandcasters are used?  Do they the cast a

At least in CT, sandcasters were cast in a cloud on a specific vector,
and then didn\'t maneuver so you would loose their effect as you
continued to maneuver.  Sand was almost ignored in MT as far as I could
see.  In TNE, sandcasters became more of the "shield" effect, with a
cannister worth of sand being held in a field by the casting turret and
being used to actively intercept fire.  A nice visual of this effect is

That is absolutely crazy, you can\'t train soldiers like that!  My grand dad
would of put me on some kind of work detail for a month at least for
dropping a rifle. And I\'m a civilian! Of course HE was a gunner in WW2...

I believe it, typical skin monkey behavior. ObTrav: Compare this to the
decline of the Sardaukar(sp?) in Dune... Where are such parallels in Trav.
I\'m thinking CT , early 1000\'s. The Empire seems stable as far as I see,
although I only have the LBB\'s. Seems to require an assassination to erupt
into chaos, or am I interpreting what little I hear? How do the Imp\'s feel
about this "Star Trigger" of the Darrians I just recently read about? That
is one serious "Weapon of Mass Destruction"! I can\'t  remember any declining
power of that time period, is there one?

possible just occurred to me. Apologies if it has been mentioned before
(some of those replies were pretty long, so I may have missed it).

Acclimation.

Marines, more so than any other force in the Imperium, have to land on
worlds with any conceivable combination of gravity, pressure, and trace
gasses and expect to function -- without time for adaptation.

The suit provides a controlled environment and carries its own weight (and
the weight of weaponry and equipment) against the local gravity. This
allows the Marine Task Force to effectively ignore local conditions and
concentrate on the mission. Part of the handover process to the Army may
involve giving them time to acclimate and adapt (where possible), so that
they can continue the fight without all the life support gear and attendant
logistical tail. 

[This was a significant lesson learned in Somalia, by the way -- the 10th
Mountain Division troops sent directly from Fort Drum, NY, in the dead of
winter suffered mightily in East Africa. When the time came for UPHOLD
DEMOCRACY in Haiti, the timetable included 10-14 days for the 10th Mountain
troops in Florida, so they could acclimate. This worked much better.]

This suggests a need for Marine vehicles like a mobile NBC shelter, large
enough for the Marines to shuck their suits when they need a rest. Such a
shelter could be installed in a cutter module, in a series of cargo
containers that link together, in tents or be integrated with field
maintenance shelters on grav sleds. The US has a system called Force
Provider which covers essentially these functions, less the maintenance
requirement for the suits.

I\'m still considering how battlesuited troops do the "hearts and minds"
schtick, but that has become the issue for me, rather than whether or not
battlesuited troops make sense in the first place. They do.

There are other possibilities as well. For example, here in Philadelphia
there\'s an interesting law on the books. If your company wants to come in
and build a building downtown, you\'ve got to spend 1% of the building price
on beautification projects in the area. Usually, the company erecting the
building hires a sculptor and plops down a sculpture somewhere. Sometimes
it\'s used to create small parks or shady little areas. As a result, downtown
Philadelphia has *tons* of nice stuff around.

An idea like this could be added into a Traveller Universe. It might be very
common for planets to request that megacorps perform some "good" service in
order to close a lucrative deal. Of course, some megacorps might do that
*anyway* to sweeten a deal or to edge out competitors.

A megacorp might contract a bunch of medtraders to do work on a specific
world to help close a deal. Of course, it doesn\'t have to be medical-types,
it could be anything. I\'m thinking of the scene in "Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade" where the Germans are trying to lure the local Arab bigwig
into letting them borrow a tank and a bunch of soldiers to help them with
their dig. He\'s not really buying it. They wave gold and jewels in his face
and he\'s unimpressed. Then he sees their car... and it turns out he\'s a huge
car buff ;)

I believe I went over this briefly in one of my responses to The Roc. It
didn\'t go into the detail that you\'re going into here.

I hadn\'t thought of it that way. That makes a hell of alot of sense.

Like I\'ve already said, I\'m not sure that the marines would be expected to
do the "hearts and minds" routine. Even if a government is *trying* to win
the hearts and minds of a population, not every branch of the armed services
will be handing out candy bars to little kids or helping to relocate people
living in areas where fighting is growing more intense.

This, I suspect, is where peoples\' CT experience is tripping them up.  In
Book 4 (let alone, god forbid, Book 1), being *required* to devote two or
more of your skill picks to Battle Dress is a Big Deal(tm)... especially
when most CT campaigns are NOT active duty, and thus these picks will be
"wasted" (unless the GM lets his PCs get their hot little hands on a suit
of BD, yeah right).

GURPS characters have a LOT more skills, and basic competency in them is a
LOT easier to come by.  So long to the one-trick-ponies that CT chargen so
often produced.

As for the concerns that the Combat Paralysis disad will be mandatory:
well, I suspect this is two-fold.  First, many people have been raised on a
portrayal of Marines, whatever their country of origin, as (to use the
phrase of Sgt. Apone) "absolute BADASSES!"  The notion of their manly-man
PC curling into a ball and wetting himself if caught outside of his
Superman suit during a fight (which you KNOW is gonna happen sooner or
later, GMs live for that sorta thing) does not fit in with that image.
Secondly, the memories of arbitrary restrictions that WERE mandatory - like
"cannot wear armor" and "cannot use edged weapons" - are probably still in
the living memory of many of the old-timers on this list. :)

What it comes down to is:  it\'s your book, write what you like.  You at
least seem to have a grasp of past canon on the subject and some RL
experience to boot, which is more than some game writers can say.

Peace.

Depending on how low-tech the planet is and the prevailing cultural
mores, blindness *would* be a death sentence ; the Australian
ophthalmologist Fred Hollows\' work in Nepal and other Third World
locales doubtless prolonged the lives of many locals with cataracts.

Depending on the size of the problem, \'travelling medicine shows\' may be
woefully inadequate to do anything constructive (although unlike
historical snake oil sellers, the stuff they peddle might actually
work!) ; or they could train up the locals and make a real difference
(citing Hollows as an RW example again). 
	Doing the latter takes planning comparable to any military operation ;
Medicine Sans Frontieres is perennially short of logisticians as well as
medical and nursing staff!

Perhaps we should expand the terms of discourse of this thread.
\'Star Mercs\' rely on superior off-world expertise, contracting out their
services (any service) to lower-tech worlds.
	The 3I equivalent to Anderson Consulting or Drake ("Solutions, Inc.")
can provide trained individuals and materiel to solve *almost*
any problem, if you pay the fee....

[Apologies if this has already been covered, I am a bit
behind on the TML.]

When you say that Tl-8 medicine sucks I assume you mean in comparison
to TL9 and higher medicine.  IIRC the cure for cancer is TL
9 or 10
according to canon.

However compared to _lower_ TL medicine I think that TL 8 medicine
is wonderful.  I know that I would be dead, probably several
times over,
with TL 5 or 6 medicine.  I suspect that this is the case
for many others as well.

Firstly, thanks for passing a keen eye over over my ramblings.
My casual knowledge of boron chemistry was distilled into the post.
I will try and find some appropriate references to answer both
questions.

Gut feeling : there is a lack of appropriate solvents for boron
compounds unless they were combined with carbon or silicon to get around
the \'boron hydride\' problem (they react explosively with water, oxygen
and most of the solvents I listed later in the post).

Apparently several groups have replaced the nitrogen atoms in a wide
range of organic compounds with boron. This is intriguing. Again, I will
try to dig up some info (RW commitments willing).

True. As Leonard Erickson has repeatedly alluded to in recent posts, the
\'catalytic clay\' theory is becoming more popular. I should have spent a
little more time going over various theories ; but this series is
designed to stimulate idea exchange, primarily.

I\'m more than happy to sit back, see what comments come in and make
appropriate modifications.

Do you have a reference for your last statement? I\'d love to read about
catalytic activity in fatty acids ; my (possibly misinformed) stance on
this is that this group of compounds is unlikely to behave in such a
way.

But, like the carbohydrates, perhaps they haven\'t been put together in
the right way.. yet.

Regarding the development of isomerism :-
Again, I should have covered some of the alternate theories.
In optically active systems, it is energetically \'cheaper\' to develop
enzymes, etc. that will handle only one isomer. This must afford
evolutionary advantage to those replicators that deal exclusively with
one isomer.
	David, your other points are well taken. Constructing peptide chains
out of D-amino acids would make an interesting, if not overtly Ph.D.
worthy, project.

<one isomer everywhere?>

But our 20 amino acids aren\'t the only possible ones. There are six
equally likely alternates to tryptophan that have the same empirical
formula, for example.

Alien food is as immunogenic as your local nosh, but may cause bloating,
wind and diarrhoea because you can\'t absorb funny sugar X or amino acid
Y. Or some complex organic in the foreign food acts as an
anti-infective, anti-tumour drug or causes hallucinosis.
	Sky\'s the limit for intriguing possibilities.

Thank you for taking the time out to read my post!

Ok, right up the there, you are consistent with the Gregorian calendar.

Here you part company with the Gregorian Calendar. BTW, the Russian
Calendar (adopted from the Orthodox churches) has a somewhat different
rule:

        Every year which when divided by 900 leaves a remainder of 200
        or 600 is a leap year.

This corrects the year length more accurately than the 4000 year rule
does.

A Monday. It\'s really quite simple. You\'ve dropped Feb 29, 4000. Thus
all dates from that point onward are one day earlier.

BTW, thanks for letting us know about this. I was about the start
writing date routines for interconverting the calendars. You\'ve just
saved me from making a mistake.

I do have a question though. I can\'t recall if the Imperial Calendar
has leap years every 4th year (like the old Julian calendar), never has
leap years, or has the 100/400 year rule. Which is it *officially*.

Please check the Calendar FAQ. The 4000 year rule has been *suggested*.
But it is *not* part of the legal definition of the calendar (which,
for the UK and all former British colonies *including* the US is
defined in an Act of Parliment, and *does* have to 4 year, 100 year and
400 year rules).

Could you be a bit more specific as to *exactly* what you want?

Assuming that what you want is to take the (x,y,z) co-ordinates of two
points and generate a relative bearing, it\'s doable, but *messy*. 

The "simple" part is modifying the (x,y,z) co-ordinates so that one
ship is at (0,0,0). You just add/subtract the same amount to the X, Y
and Z co-ordinates of *each* ship. 

Then you just do a rectangular to spherical co-ordinate transform. The
new co-ordinates will be theta, phi and r. Theta is the angle from the
X or Y axis (I forget which). Phi is the angle from the X-Y plane. And
r is the distance from the origin. 

If that\'s what you want, I\'ll dig up the formulas, but they are messy.

I suggest that all of you go looking for old Murray Leinster
paperbacks. One of the many "series" he wrote involved the Med-Ship
Service. Lots of ideas, and not *that* hard to adapt to Traveller.

With Traveller drives, there\'s no point in doing slingshot manuevers.
Those save fuel, but cost time. given the low fuel consumption of the
few manuever drives that even *use* fuel, it just ain\'t gonna happen.

Not that far from the plot of one of Leinster\'s Med-Ship stories. But
the Med service doesn\'t approve of that sort of thing. And crossing
them can be *really* bad news.

From the Office of the Sector Capital:  I am sorry Commander, but the
Emperor agrees, that for political reasons beyond your obvious
comprehension... the Andrew Young will be several sectors away from this
situation and we do not care to have marine presence within "Cooee" of the
place.  We have a more politically palatable regiment of Lift Infantry
enroute as we speak.  Move your faceless baby-eaters out of system now or be
relieved of command.

To which, the Army arrive, and conduct a politically favourable mission
(perhaps this world has felt those micronukes before, and never again?),
leaving the city virtually intact, while the Andrew Young is following
orders assisting Customs patrols in the Upperkickatinalong Sector...

Canonical examples run from three to eight riders. There are no firm

It\'s in the description: Ground Pressure Low (1,065 lb/sf); it had to be
calculated to arrive at Off-Road Speed. This is the same rating as the M1
tank in VE2 (p. 141). There appears to have been a deliberate effort on the
part of the designer to reduce ground pressure by making the legs huge in
proportion to the rest of the body: 

	200lb pilot	Commando BD	increase
Head	0.5 cf		1 cf		x2
Body	2 cf		6 cf		x3
Arms	0.2 cf each	0.4 cf each	x2
Legs	0.5 cf each	2.6 cf each	x5.2

So forget about all those illustrations of cool-looking, man-shaped
battledress. When you consider that there is a limit to how wide the stance
of the trooper within the suit can be, and remember that the volume of
armor is *not* anywhere taken into account, you can see that all that
excess volume has to go on the front, back, and sides of the legs. This
thing is a troll, with bulbous legs, a barrel chest, and tiny (in
proportion) head and arms. Add the flight pack, and you get a hunchback as
well.

Someone asked about maintenance: by GURPS rules (p. VE146), the Commando BD
requires 4 hours of maintenance after 32.4 hours of use. Call it 4 hours
out of every 36. This means that your Commando BD force would require one
mechanic for every 3-6 suits. Regular Improved BD (p. GT118) requires 4
hours of maintenance after 80 hours of use, or one mechanic for 8-16 suits.
The variation depends on how many hours you work your mechanics a day, from
8 to 16.

Cut-and-paste the above, hand to a player whose Marine officer just
badly blew a reenlistment roll. The above was probably said by an
Imperial diplomat or other non-military representative - but once the
Marines land, the noble in charge of this world is going to hold the force
commander personally responsible for damages caused that don\'t
meet *his* expectations of a best possible outcome. Especially if the
guy giving the above speech is too high for the world\'s noble to touch.

This noble didn\'t win this world out of a crackerjack box. He has it 
because he has connections and influence. His 3rd Cousin the Sector
Duke may think him an idiot, but an idiot with a noble patent has more
clout than a Marine Colonel. If someone\'s head has to roll because
the Marquis de Garda Villis\' pet Museum of Interstellar History got
micronuked, the Marine officer in charge on the ground will look like a 
mighty tempting target.

How can said scapegoat target protect his career? Time to get as good
at playing politics as he is at planning assaults...or be so damn good
at planning assaults that someone big and important wants to keep
him around. (Of course, in the latter case, his career lasts as long
as the big important guy does).

        Hi, Leonard!
        We have a similar problem in Canada.  The work around that most
DI\'s, etc use is to simply say the individual requires more PE training to
get to a "minimum level of endurance"...  The push-ups and laps are
scheduled for leave periods, etc.  Its not punishment, its extra training.

As a contribution to the very interesting BD thread, I\'d like to refer
folks to a comic book limited series of a few years ago: Shadow Empires by
Chris Moeller.  It follows the leader of a battalion(?) built around a
squad (platoon?) of what is known as "Iron" in this TU.  It\'s beautifully
rendered (fully painted) and has a nifty politico-socio-religious
background.  Cool visual realizations of BD and other personal armor,
weapons, vehicles, ships, etc.  I\'d also take a look at another series of
his, more recent: Sheva\'s War.  This story is set a few subsectors over
and follows a noblewomen in charge of troops when the stuff hits the fan.
Interesting take here is on psionics--not pyrotechnically strong, but
subtle and strictly the purview of the nobility.  Also fully painted.

Chris is a good friend of mine, and I will pass this along to him.  Thanks
for the great review.  Much of that history and story came from traveller

What was I thinking? There are five other equally likely tryptophan

have the same empirical formula.

Now think about what happens when you start swapping atoms e.g. boron

If you know the x,y,z relative to you, then its basic trig (from
tangent=opposite/adjacent):

  bearing (left to right) = arctan(z/x)
  mark (up/down) = arctan(z/y)

you will also need to test the signs of x,y,z to determine left/right, up/down,
fore/aft.

You miss the point. The same reference that says all Marines (in a line
Task Force, which may or may not apply to ship\'s troops) wear battledress
also says that they "serve as an interstellar police force in many places
along the frontier, keeping the peace and enforcing the Imperial rules of
war." This has nothing to do with handing out candy, it has to do with
identifying and separating belligerents from uninvolved civilians in
situations that are not clear-cut. That requires talking to people, which
in turn requires gaining a measure of trust. If no one talks to you, you
don\'t know what\'s going on and you can\'t complete your mission -- period.

Micronuking a sniper is an effective tactic, *IF* the local populace agrees
that it is a reasonable use of force. The standard response to snipers in
Operation URGENT FURY was a volley of 105mm HE. This was clearly spelled
out to the populace, who weren\'t too happy with the Cubans and their
supporters anyway. There was also a token bounty offered for any
military-grade weapons turned in to the US forces, no questions asked.
Result? The populace turned in anyone who might have remotely thought about
sniping at US forces, before the incident occurred. This, however, would
not have worked at all if someone in the task force hadn\'t been able to
explain the set up to the locals.

Use excessive force, cause unjustified collateral damage, and don\'t
communicate the need to the local citizens? Sure -- once, maybe twice.
After that, you turn the population against you, whatever their
inclinations were before. For all his high-tech weaponry, a Marine is still
just one man, he has to sleep sometime, and enough determined people can
still take him out -- the historical examples are too numerous to mention.
Long before it gets to that point, however, the Marine\'s mission has
*failed*, because he can no longer get the information and cooperation he
needs for "keeping the peace and enforcing the Imperial rules of war."

I went to the simplest reference I could find, the encyclopedia on the
bookshelf behind my computer.  Upon opening the M volume to "Moon"
the first thing that hit me in the face was a diagram showing the Moon\'s
orbit around the Earth. The caption said, and I quote:

"The Moon takes 27.3 days to complete one revolution around the Earth
with respect to the stars, but 29.5 days with respect to the Sun because
of the Earth\'s simultaneous motion around the Sun."

Does it have to be any more clear for you?

I will grant you, the effect will likely be smaller for a gas giant\'s moon.
The gas giant has a longer orbital period, the moon will likely have a
much shorter one.  But the discrepancy will still exist.

    'body' => 'Greetings All:

Two items that I think you ought to take a look at...

First, for those who have DVD players, take a look at the "Alien Legacy" 
boxed set. My daughter (really my wife) gave this to me for my recent 
birthday (40! 40! When did I hit 40! Panic attack! Mid-life crisis! Time to 
seriously play Traveller again and capture my lost youth! "Yut? Yut? What\'s a 
yut?")

Anyway...

Four DVD\'s, one for each of the movies. Plus, if you send in a coupon and a 
nominal fee, you can get a fifth DVD on the "making of". Not sure if it\'s the 
making of the movies or the making of the boxed set...

Alien: Has Ridley Scott commentary that you can overlay on the movie. You 
also get some trailers (movie and TV), which are kind of interesting to see 
what they were pushing the movie on. Plus, you get two "outtakes" (one of 
which adds something to the movie, the other is kind of a throwaway) and you 
get all the footage that was filmed, included, but then cut (I think after a 
preview). One of these scenes is the (in)famous scene where Ripley comes 
across her crewmates that have been...entombed...a scene that, IMHO, 
**should** have been left in as it\'s creepy as all hell.

Downside to this disk is that (at least I haven\'t found a way) in viewing the 
movie, you can\'t choose to include these missing scenes sequentially back 
into the movie. You\'ve got to view them separately, or use the menu function 
to pause, jump to the missing scene, jump back to the movie, etc.

Aliens: Again, various doo-dads (trailers, commentary, some making of stuff 
showing the models and what not). Missing footage--some of this you may have 
seen a few years ago in either a cable version or a broadcast version (Ripley 
learns the fate of her daughter, etc.). This time, there is **more** missing 
footage added in (early scenes of the colony, how they discovered the aliens, 
etc.), but better than Alien--the footage is part of the movie, no jumping 
around! Makes it a better movie, IMHO. I think that (as with the re-released 
Abyss), Cameron usually cuts stuff that he should not have!

Alien III and Alien Legacy: Haven\'t viewed these disks yet, but there\'s some 
doodads (trailers, etc.), but no missing footage.

The other recommendation:

Look for "Chariots for Apollo: The Untold Story Behind the Race to the Moon" 
by Charles R. Pellegrino and Joshua Stoff. Avon Books, reprint 06/99, $13.50 
US, ISBN 0-380-80261-9.

Why am I recommending this?

Three uses for Traveller, not all "canonical":

1. If you are running one of the alternative Traveller games that have 
floated around this list on occasion (e.g., the 1960\'s space race, the 1950\'s 
"Conquest of Space" race, etc.), you\'ll find this useful. Good details 
(including drawings) of the Soviet Union\'s moon plans, stuff that I have not 
found in other books I\'ve read.

2. "Ghost in the Machine": Are spaceships haunted? Do spaceships have 
personalities? One chapter (including a interview with Jesco von Puttkamer) 
talks about the Saturn IB that would have launched the Apollo 1 crew into 
orbit (this was the crew that was killed on the pad). This Saturn IB was 
later used to launch a non-manned test capsule. Pellegrino and von Puttkamer 
talk about how machines have "personalities", some interesting stuff that 
could be adapted to Traveller, both canonical and some of the alternative 
universes.

3. Lots of interesting descriptions of how complicated the LEM was. Machined 
parts. Tolerances. Weird stuff with repairs, tests, quality control. Yes, 
Traveller assumes standardization, mass production, etc. but you might find 
some good stuff here to throw at your players on repairs, retrofitting older 
ships, etc.

Take a look! Highly recommended as a book, as well as a reference...

Largely irrelevant, since it has contragravity, but not that high.  Of course,
this is in part due to ground pressure in Vehicles being slightly futzed to
encourage mecha.  Of course, as someone else notes, the legs in commando BD are
absurdly huge (the reason for this was probably _not_ correcting ground
pressure, actually.  It\'s probably because G:Vehicles has some magic
breakpoints in most drivetrains at 5 kilowatts, and the writer decided to
exceed 5 kilowatts so the BD could go absurdly fast on the ground.)

If any of you have access to "On Killing" (author\'s name escapes me),
there is a discussion about this, i.e, range to target.  Not seeing the
target is psychologically helpful.  But not sensing the target directly
is better.  There is the example of "hand-grenade" range given in regard
to WWI tranch warfare, where hearing the targets after a grenade
was very disturbing, though not as disturbing as "bayonet range"
and closer in.

The book is worth skimming, especially for non-military types.
You might even be able to quickly draft a table of morale modifiers
based on range.  But then, we could do that with the people on
the TML in less than a day.

But I can\'t say I\'d recommend the book.  Although the author was
an Army officer for some time and is now a professor, I found the
book to be rather thin on the documentation.  Its clear that he
interviewed many combat veterans and that he has read a lot
of studies, and he cites the latter, but not in detail and not well.
There is also some good ol\' B.S. in portions.  I was expecting
something a good deal more academic than this.  You might have
seen the author on TV.  He was everywhere after the Columbine
incident.

Grossman. Dave Grossman I think.

Yeah. I saw this guy on television. I *stopped* seeing him after different
television news programs started pairing him up against lawyers and
academics whose views on video game violence weren\'t quite the same. A *big*
warning about the author: he was quite lacking in his ability to defend his
viewpoints. He was the type of guy, who when confronted intelligently by
people who disagree would chuckle condescendingly and then simply blurt out
a soudbite that had little to do with the subject at hand.

While I know this is said in jest, let\'s just think a moment...that
tactic worked _so_ well when it has been tried in the past!

(excuse me while I mop up the sarcasm)

The trend here seems to be that the IM are just a faceless bunch of baby
killing chrome freaks with severe cases of cyberpsychosis (to mangle
several game metaphors).

Their use as indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is jarringly
different from their clear literary progenitors, Heinlein\'s Mobile
Infantry. There\'s a sizeable section in there regarding their training
in the _selective_ use of force, where if they were ever asked to go in
and kill every left-handed red-haired male in a drop zone and leave
every thing else standing untouched, they could do it. They made extreme
violence extremely personal. That was the mission of the MI. Mass
destruction was left to someone else.

The IM, like the MI, (he he) specialize in the selective application of
overwhelming force. If you\'re going to take out three buildings to get
rid of a sniper, hell, just ask the Navy to nuke it from orbit. Deadfall
ordinance is cheaper, just as accurate, and just as randomly
destructive.

If the IM are always used as the fbbkcfcp\'s they\'re being described as,
the Imperium will soon have a lot more than a few brush wars to deal
with. The use of terror troops to maintain order will inevitably lead to
widespread rebellion, and that will disrupt trade more than anything
else.

I remember that you said something similar when I asked what things might be
like if I happened to live on a gas giant\'s moon some time back. Okay, is
there a quick and dirty method for figuring out the radius of a gas giant\'s
radiation belt? Or is there a rule of thumb?

What are possible ways that the high-tech society of the Traveller universe
may have figured out to combat such a problem? Are ships in the TU shielded
against such radiation, or are there special considerations that pilots
might have to keep in mind when skimming for fuel?

Would it be possible to erect some sort of shield around a colony? In a
crude fashion, would a dome made out of, say, lead or something similar be
feasible?

Are there other methods to defend against radiation? I\'d suspect that, on a
moon, it would be best to just dig in. How about an orbital colony or base
though?

Thanks though. Your response has been quite helpful.

Not quite true. Among other things a Regiment of the Imperial Marines serve
in the Imperial Guard, which I would think include all kinds of duties. They
also act as security on Navy ships, where collateral damage is an issue.
Stopping a mutineer by discharging plasma guns in engineering is a bad idea.

Maybe. My impression is that the Marines not only have a standard black or
camouflage
battle dress, but also a maroon battledress for ceremonial occasions (Read
as any time they want to stick out.) I suppose some kind of chameleon
covered battledress could allow one suit to serve both purposes, but I kind
of think that the maroons would be more ornate, probably with rank insignia
and unit markings, something I wouldn\'t expect to see on common battledress;
or at least not prominently displayed.

Absolutely, and the color would, of course, be maroon.

I would compare them more to present day U.S. Marines, where everyone, from
tanker to embassy guard is a rifleman first. Imperial Marines are combat
infantry first. They also provide security to starports and Navy vessels and
embassies.  I\'ve no doubt that the Embassy guards and members of the
Imperial Guard are cream of the crop. But I don\'t really think that Marines
assigned to shipboard security live in their battledress or that Marines at
Starport gates are all in their Battledress Maroons, all of the time. This
implies a range of training.
I do agree that if you drop a Sylean Ranger and an Imperial Marine naked in
a marginal Terran environment that the Ranger would do better. But if you
dropped an IA tech or a Marine tech into the same position I would expect
the Marine to have a higher chance of survival.

Hm..."enough to clobber inner moons"?  I\'m not really certain, it depends on
the magnetic field of the gas giant, not sure how consistent that is.

Ships in traveller clearly have some sort of uber-shielding against radiation,
simply because people don\'t get fried by conventional solar radiation, nor do
they get fried by skimming gas giants for fuel.

Radiation shielding is mostly a matter of raw mass per unit area.  For long

Realistically, the best methods are either lots of mass in the way, or
generating a magnetic field (which is, incidentally, another good reason to
have circular space stations, since magnetic shielding is sort of
torus-shaped).  However, I believe that canon has superdense and bonded
superdense with extraordinary protective abilities against radiation.

I would like to suggest you include the use of hyperdense blades on Marine
cutlasses during boarding actions. Its very CT. There have been extensive

Don\'t forget the biggest difference between the IA and the IM. The Imperial
Army is made up of units raised in each Domain. If the Archduke of the
Domain is popular these units might be a touch more loyal to him than to the
Emperor. The IM recruit from across the Imperium. Like the Navy (which is
also partially raised by the Domains, but is often then sent to serve in
other sectors) the IM are a more inherently loyal force. I would expect
Marine tradition to revolve around loyalty to the Iridium Throne, the Corps
(the IM as a whole), and ones\' comrades, with a smattering of Foreign Legion
fatalism thrown in, while Army tradition would center on the regiment and
the corps (COACC, Wet Navy, Armor, etc.)

Yahoo! bends after GeoCities users grousing
By Michelle Collins

In response to concerns by people who set up home pages on GeoCities,
Yahoo! clarified its terms of services to alert users that it does not
own content posted on their servers. 

Yahoo! on May 30 completed its purchase of GeoCities, which hosts Web
pages for users who are known as homesteaders. 

This past weekend, all GeoCities pages were integrated in Yahoo!,
which required users to sign a new terms of service agreement. That
agreement, which included several sentences about Yahoo!\'s rights to
use content on homesteaders\' pages, angered many users and prompted
several to complain to Yahoo! 

Yahoo! late Wednesday added to its terms of service a statement
clarifying its section on promotional use of the material on the
pages. 

"Yahoo does not own Content you submit, unless we specifically tell
you otherwise before you submit it," the terms state. "You license the
Content to Yahoo as set forth below for the purpose of displaying and
distributing such Content on our network of properties and for the
promotion and marketing of our services." 

The statement was added to a section the terms of service, which still
state: "By submitting Content to any Yahoo property, you automatically
grant, or warrant that the owner of such Content has expressly
granted, Yahoo the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive
and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify,
adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute,
perform and display such Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or
to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now
known or later developed." 

Many users understood the passage to mean that Yahoo! had ownership of
all material on the pages, and that GeoCities homesteaders couldn\'t
log in to the system to retrieve their files without agreeing to the
new terms. 

That isn\'t true, however, said Tim Brady, executive producer of Yahoo!
Inc. 

"A lot of our users expressed extreme concern that they thought the
wording was too broad," Brady said. "The intentions have not changed,"
but the wording is clarified. 

The section without the clarification had angered many people who had
pages on GeoCities before the integration on the Yahoo! site. 

"I don\'t like the fact that I have no way of changing my page, taking
advantage of Yahoo!\'s tremendous promotional Web presence, and
continuing without the songs on the Web site," said Glenn McMurray,
creator of a GeoCities Web site for Chicago-area band Screaming
Bluedogs. 

"I don\'t like that there was no warning," McMurry said. "I really
don\'t think I would have missed any notice. It would have/should have
been professionally done as most all of the correspondence has been
with Geocities." 

"The targeted advertising and mandatory pop-ups aren\'t enough for
them," said Marcela Musgrove, a GeoCities homesteader from Chicago.
"Now they want to take away all rights to our material? That\'s going a
little too far."

And like I\'ve already said, I\'m not entirely convinced that translates into
the same thing as we\'re familiar with in the real world. Enforcing the
Imperial rules of war seems to me to be something that would be decisive and
brutal. Also, keep in mind that it doesn\'t say that Imperial marines are the
*only* group that keeps the peace in the Imperium. We\'re running into
another snag with differing canon views though.

Why? Upon reviewing the Impie rules of war in MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia it
appears that military intervention is a last resort. The Imperial policy
seems to be "Hands off until it gets really bad." In fact, upon rereading
the entry again, it almost seems like they\'re saying, "A war is good for a
planet every once in awhile." Hence, the concept of a peace-keeping force
may be quite different when viewed through Imperial eyes.

The first criterion that is listed in the entry is "Long-term social or
economic dislocation is suffered when a region loses its ability to carry on
at its prewar level of economic activity."

In other words, the war has become so protracted that there\'s no way to end
it but by the Imperium stepping in and putting its foot down.

The second criterion relates to "excessive" extraplanetary interference. The
definition is somewhat blurry. Basically, if another party is interfering in
such a way that the first criterion will be met by their mucking about, the
Imperium has to come in and put its foot down. This might not even mean
influence on the planet\'s surface. It might mean that the Imperial marines
take a trip to the interfering organization\'s world or base as a show of
force.

The third criterion is the possession of nuclear weapons. Individual GMs may
change this rule to cover all "weapons of mass destruction": nuclear,
chemical, biological and (if they\'re included in the campaign)
nanotechnological.

Fair enough.

However, by the time the Imperial forces show up, I would imagine that the
war has been going on for a goodly amount of time. Your making the
assumption that in all cases it will be a Vietnam-type situation where it\'s
difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys. In some cases, for
example, destroying offworld supply lines from an interfering party might be
appropriate, or dropping marines into the heat of battle to eliminate both
sides in a conflict.

There are many other methods that don\'t rely on what our late 20th century
view of peace-keeping and police actions are.

Of course, the Imperial rules of war seem to imply that once the trade and
manufacturing infrastructures are destroyed on a planet it\'s time to bring
in the guys in powered armor and end the war.

I\'m still not sure I can understand what cooperation the marines need to
enforce the Imperial rules of war. As far as peace-keeping, I\'m still not
convinced that it\'s the same concept we know here on late 20th century
Terra.

Well, I don\'t know what Lord Vader\'s take on the Imperial rules of war would
be. He\'d probably vote to just destroy whole planets out-of-hand. ;)

That\'s not what I\'m talking about. I\'m saying that the Imperial marines
are... I don\'t know how to say it exactly... the smartest of smart bombs
maybe. They are a razor edge that\'s applied to get a very specific result. I
don\'t believe I ever said that I think the Imperial marines come in and
destroy whole cities. I did say that I think they would be dropped to use
overwhelming force. However, such force is applied surgically. I never said
that they indiscriminately murder every man woman and child.

Remember, Imperial marines can be dropped just about anywhere on a planet in
a very short time, if their "mothership" is in orbit. It\'s not like Terra,
where the U.N. hears a war is going on, debates action for a period of days,
weeks, months, even years, and then eventually a peace-keeping force is
assembled and set in another period of weeks or months. If the marines are
in orbit, they can land and wipe out combatants in a matter of hours,
possibly even before a large battle is over.

That\'s why I\'m saying that there are differences between how we see these
concepts and how the Imperials might see them. A peace-keeping force in the
Imperium might be a "Sword of Damocles" type situation, where just the
knowledge that there are some real tough bastards in orbit might be enough
to set in motion treaties and peace talks and the like... Even if they
*don\'t* go in and destroy everything in sight.

This is part of the idea behind Downport.com, in a way.  For people who
don\'t need to maintain a large site on a regular basis, we can host pages
that they send to us.  In some cases, where folks do have larger sites to
maintain, we can work out ftp access for them.  We are paying for space on a
server and have dedicated this domain to Traveller.  Our host has a very few
restrictions and doesn\'t have the luxury of trying to steal intellectual
property because they are competing for our dollars in a buyers market.

For now the site is relatively small and we are covering the costs out of
pocket and by having a tiny commercial area called The Traveller Trader
where I sell used Traveller publications and give 10% of the gross toward
site expenses.  We\'d like to see the site grow to the point where we could
offer virtual domains (like "yoursite.downport.com") to people with larger
content needs and they would help with the expenses, perhaps on the order of
$25 per quarter (not sure, would depend on how many people are involved and
the relative space usage).  We have also considered the idea of trying to
attract a commercial user (game store, publisher, etc.) whose site we could
host and maintain for a fee that might subsidize the whole site.

On the other hand, there are a few TML members who own their own web servers
outright and might offer web space freely.  There is certainly room for more
than one site like Downport.com on the web.  If you know of other
Traveller-friendly sites, now would be a good time to pipe up.  Yahoo! is a
big player.  I can see the rest of the market following their precedent.

Publish isn\'t the one to bitch about.  They need that one to display your web
page (putting a page on the web is publishing it).  The terms to bitch about
are \'perpetual, irrevokable\' and \'modify, adapt, and create derivative works\'.

when associated with the phrase "royalty free" and "sub licensable".

From a photographers point of view, they could take any photo I have on a 
GeoCities site, and then sell it to Coca Cola for an ad, making say $2000 
and I get squat.  They could also take that photo, sell it to a marketing 
company for $0.01 and that Marketing company could take it, digitally alter 
it, and then sell it to Coke for $2000.

If the license agreement read something like:

You grant Yahoo, a royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable right to display 
your content to the Internet.  Any other use would require a separate 
license between you and Yahoo.

That would let them display the pages legally.  The problem with them and 
if you check other sites as well, they have the same terminology is they 
are trying to protect themselves from suit.  Most "Photo Club" sites use 
the exact same terminology and its wrong.

Now, I can understand that this... erm... homesteader complaining about the
possibility of losing her copyrights for her own material. However, to
complain about the "targeted advertising and mandatory pop-ups" seems to be
just a bit overboard. If she doesn\'t like GeoCities\' "free"[1] webspace,
then she could always do the research and start her own server or lease
webspace from an ISP.

Read that clause above CAREFULLY.  Now they say they don\'t "own" your work,
they just have the perpetual right to use it as they please without paying
for it.  Perhaps I\'m an idiot, but that sounds like "ownership" to me.
Better even, because they get all the benefits of ownership and none of the
liability!  (If I buy a copy of Digidesign\'s ProTools III, I\'m most
definitely NOT allowed to reproduce it -- even after paying that company
over $5000 for it!)

As a digital audio engineer and producer at an independant label, I have
asked all my clients who have posted ANYTHING original (music, lyrics,
photos, etc.) on a Yahoo!-owned site, including Geocities, to REMOVE that
material ASAP -- if they are not willing to give up their exclusive rights
under Copyright law or their Publishing rights.  This is absolutely the
worst TOS language I\'ve seen --  and any claim that they need \'publishing\'
rights in order to allow you to put material on Geocites is a bogus,
unsubtle grab for hard-to-come-by original content for free.  What happens
to an artist or band who may later get signed onto a major?  Major labels
require an exclusive contract with the artist(s) for rights to mechanically
reproduce, promote and distribute that artists\' material -- including photos
or other likenesses of the artist(s).  They are NOT going to like the fact
that the original material they are paying for can be reproduced at will by
Yahoo! due a previous contract that is "irrevocable" and "royalty-free."  If
a songwriter wishes to receive \'mechanical\' royalties or \'synchronization\'
royalties, to say nothing of basic Publishing rights for his/her/their work,
then they need to avoid this kind of TOS agreement like the plague.  This
goes the same for graphic/multimedia artists.  Their professional future may
very well be compromised by such an agreement.  No joke at all.

Hell, Yahoo! may one day decide to release CDs for sale -- without bothering
to ask permission of the authors/performers of such material, and without
paying them a dime, no matter how much Yahoo! makes out if it.  This is
beyond the pale.  And completely consistent with the language of their TOS
agreement.

I\'ve been dealing with record labels for 15 years, and I\'ve seen every trick
in the book attempting to strip an author of their rights so as to increase
the profits of the label.  What Yahoo! is doing now is an extremely serious
issue with many in the music industry -- I\'m certain that other
industries/communities are talking about it as well, it\'s just that I follow
music industry newsgroups and mailing lists on a regular basis.

Another major concern that I\'ve been hearing is "What if other
businesses/labels take a cue from Yahoo!?"  Which isn\'t unlikely if people
continue to *accept* this assault!  There needs to be a LOT more hue and cry
against this sort of thing, or -- before you know it -- this will become the
standard.  The \'laws\' of the biz are similar to the laws of nature:  the
shortest, quickest path to increasing the bank accounts of major companies
is *always* the chosen path.  Yahoo\'s draconian contract is a seriously
damaging step backwards for artists.  It reminds me of the days when music
acts had to give up their claim to any exclusive publishing ownership of
their material in order to get a record contract.  They got paid an
insulting percentage in royalties and maybe a new Cadillac ragtop to appease
them.  If you are not only the performer --  but the \'author\' -- of original
material, then you are entitled to 50% of the Publishing proceeds paid to
the label every time a copy of your CD gets sold or one of your songs gets
synched to video -- in addition to the usual 5-8% of the *net* profit from
the sale of that material.

That new convertible they bought you is fine with a label that will be
receiving 100 times that in profits from the sale of your songs.  Thing is,
with Yahoo!, you don\'t even get the Cadillac!  The only reason it isn\'t
outright theft is that you DO NOT have to put anything on their sites, or
deal with them at all, unless you are incredibly generous or stupid.

BOYCOTT YAHOO! until they cease and desist their war against original
authorship!

That and the "...to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or
technology now known or later developed." bit...

For instance, you post your snifty shareware (or freeware) program,
Traveller supplement, whatever, on yahoocities. 

They can, per this agreement, sell (\'distribute\') the program on a \'Best
of Yahoo\' collection, with your name erased (\'modify\' or \'derivative
work\', take your pick), on a CD or book they sell in bookstores (\'...any
form, media, or technology\') and keep all the profits.

This doesn\'t mean they _intend_ to do that, but we all know about the
paving of certain roads with good intentions...

What they _still_ don\'t get, apparently, is that new clause they
inserted doesn\'t change, and in fact, is directly contradicted by the
vastly over-reaching assignment of rights they have in the assignment of
licensing statement.

If all they want is to advertise themselves using your work as an
example of "the Best of Yahoo" and be able to distribute material to
various mirror sites so they can manage server loads, why doesn\'t their
licencing clause just state that, plain and simple? Why the endless
right to do anything they want, in any medium? That\'s just legal
overkill.

ObTrav. Hmmm....maybe Yahoo\'s legal staff is ex-IM, and they were
ordered to \'secure these contracts\' ;-)

A good recent analogue of this would be that, if my sources are correct, the
Brits put seasoned veteran pilots in Harriers when they were introduced.
The USMC originally put hot young pilots in the cockpits of theirs and their
training loss rate was much higher.

Dad is one of the "Cold Guard" and retired after his 20 in 1968.  I can
still remember sitting on the riding mower mowing the parent\'s front yard,
it\'s across the road from Camp Lejeune, when a pair of Harriers came
streaking over my head just above the tree tops.

Well, superdense and higher-tech hull materials ought to provide some
radiation shielding during transit of the radiation belt, and, once
in-atmosphere, the GG\'s own atmosphere should also help.

It would be much better to use hull materials such as superdense and its
derivatives of such a dome.  Since they are (IIRC) denser than lead,
they would give more shielding per cm of thickness.  Further, their
superior rigidity would make them more capable of supporting their own
weight.

Maroon battledress and fatigues would, of course, give the other
services yet another way to razz the Marines (in addition to the
insulting inflection of the term "I\'rene" and the "Girlie Marines in
[battle] dresses"):

<Bugs Bunny voice>

What a _maroon_!

Of course, this game is best played when the Marines in question are
inhibited (for whatever reason) from defending their honor....

How could we forget the Dolphins?  Any Imperial Army NFC worth it\'s salt
would have to include Dolphins, at least as a recon force. Worlds with
greater than 95% Hydro percentages would probably have a significant Dolphin
population, unless there\'s an indigious marine sophont population. Even
there a regiment of Dolphin Marnies or a Battalion of Dolphin IA troops
would be the best force to have.

You can also stack spheres.  They did it all the time with cannon shot.
Yes, there are gaps,  but if we make the analogy to starcharts, then each
sphere can be concidered the outer boundary of a star system, about half a
parsec out (I know that\'s WAY past the kuiper belt but its  the halfway mark
between adjacent systems).   Note that switching to this system for
starcharts puts 12 spheres adjacent (6 around plus 3 on top and 3 beneath)
rather than the customary 6 hexes.

The catalytic clay theory may well have peaked.  The maing point,
however, is that nobody should take anyone theory as the "right"

The catalytic activity is still bit speculative.  The main result
I know about is that people have used them to create pH gradients.

Deamer D. W. and Harang E. (1990) Light-dependent pH gradients are
generated in liposomes containing ferrocyanide. Biosystems  24, 1-4.

Hey, \'round here one of the local toys for tots programs happens to be

Of course, I think that the Pagans just signed a pact with one arm of the

I\'ve lost the earlier messages, but didn\'t Doug say at the outset that
Out-of-BD Combat Paralysis was an _optional_ disadvantage?

As to the roles of Imperial Marines, in my interpretation of Classic
Traveller canon they have the following main roles:

1) shipboard security (best done in combat armour with light weapons)

2) base security (frontline elements in ballistic fatigues with light
weapons, reaction units in combat armour with heavier weapons)

3) assault (battle dress, really heavy weapons)

4) forward observer (combat armour or battle dress - whatever matches troop
type so they don\'t stand out)


As all marine units can theoretically undertake any mission, all marines
are trained in battle dress. Some units, of course, never use it outside
training and thus have relatively low skill levels (ie BD-0).

With no basis in canon whatsoever, I\'ve also decided that enlisted marines
usually stay with their units for their career. Officers tend to stay for
long times as well, working their way up the ranks within their regiments.
(Influence of Falkenburg here, I think.)


In terms of the CoDominion universe, I translate Imperial Marines as the
Fleet branch of the CoDo Marines, with the Imperial Army acting as Line and
Garrison Marines.

I\'m not a lawyer but it sure sounds like they can take anything
they want from any of their users\' sites and sell it. 

Example: If Jesse\'s material was on a GeoCities/Yahoo site, he
could wake up one day to find his Traveller graphics on T-shirts
sold across the world without his knowledge and he wouldn\'t make a
cent. The same goes for anyone who sends him their work and he
posts it, even if _they_ don\'t have a website with GeoCities/Yahoo.

That\'s the definition of a "free" website? 

"Sure, you own your car..but I can drive it, wreck it, or sell it
at any time without your permission, without telling you I\'m going
to do it, and without reimbursing you in any way. But you own your
car."

Sounds like blatant theft to me. I *was* considering setting up my
own Traveller site with GeoCities.

Not any more.

Heresy! (Not you Eris) When I did Infantry OSUT a Ft. Benning back in 1984,
we got dropped for *everything* and *anything*.  We did push-ups before we
were allowed to eat, after we ate, before lights-out.. The Sunday mornings
we allegedly had a s free tyime, the Drills ran a "voluntary" PT session.
Lots of road work and endurance drills.

It worked.  Out of 200 or so trainees in my Company, only three failed the
EOCT PT test.  More than half of us scored above 200.

Hell, I got dropped for *100* after saying "damn" in front of the Senior
Drill Sergeant.

ALPHA!  SEVEN!  ONE!  INFANTRY!  ON THE ROAD!!!!

We also got smoked once for crushing Drill Sergeant Colom\'s brown round
hat, but that\'s another story...

If yhay\'s how their enemies see them, so much the better.  The problem is
you are seeing the Iron Fist, and assuming that\'s all there is.  I\'m not
about to post a hundred odd page book to the TML.  The Marines are the
final act, the big stick.  Their prescence is a clue that you have screwed
up, and that retribution will be coming down with the wrath of whatever
gods you hold dear.  They come after the diplomats and nobles and IISS
advisors have failed.  Like the nuclear aresenals of the US and USSR, they
were the weapons of last resort.

>Their use as indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is jarringly
>different from their clear literary progenitors, Heinlein\'s Mobile
>Infantry.

That\'s about the eleventh time someone has said this, so let me set the
record straight:

My take on the Inperial Marines is *not* directly based on Robert A.
Heinlein\'s classic novel _Starship Troopers_.  The number of books and fil
influences are numerous; but the one single most important influence on my
view of the IMF is the US Army\'s romp through souther Iraq in 1991.  

US tankers could hit targets when the Iraqis couldn\'t see them, were
impervious to return fire, and dominated the field like nothing else.  By
day three of the war, entire divisions were crumbling as word reached the
troops about these unstoppable metal monsters.  

That\'s what the Marines are.  They are going to walk into your best troops
and decimate them, not because they are karate masters with knives in their
teeth, but because they are highly trained members of a tightly woven team
equipped with the best technology the 11,000 worlds can give them.

The only things I took directly from _Starship Troopers_ were the ranks of
Ship\'s Sergeant and Fleet Sergeant.

It sucks in that I probably went undiagnosed for up to three years, and the
treatment left me weighing 113lbs, pasty, with no short-term memory and
unable to climb a flight of stairs without gasping for breath.  Not to
mention the complete lack of usable veins in my arms for blood draws.

Too true.  Thirty years ago Hodgkin\'s Lymphoma was something you died from.
 Now, it\'s ver survivable.

Humanoid aliens with non-human internal arrangements I can accept
(convergent evolution handwave). And aliens that are interfertile with
humans I can (just) accept (common ancestry handwave). But aliens with
non-human internals who can interbreed with humans I refuse to take even

I\'m not absolutely sure about either point.

IMO the Imperial Army is a command structure for units raised on Imperial
worlds - the Imperial Army bit is the Army- or Corps- level command, but
the actual maneuver battalions are world units.

I would expect units to be loyal to their officers, as this seems to fit
the \'government by men, not laws\' theme. The Corps is an idea more than
anything else, and the Iridium Throne is far away. The Old Man, on the
other hand, is someone you see every 6-12 months.

What about something like Sherman\'s Shennandoah Campaign, or the Free-Fire
Zones of Vietnam, or the population displacement tactics of Vietnam,
Afghanistan or the modern Balkans ?

Let us assume that we have Vietnam, except the I Corps has a ban on tactics
likely to lead to population displacement. II and III Corps dont, and have
a major refugee problem. If the Imperium declares intervention, is it total
(occupy Washington, possibly trashing it), partial (occupy Vietnam),
focussed (occupy II and III corps) or exceedingly focussed (land a force,
and say declare you are shooting down any and all air support and artillery
fire in II and III corps with the point defense weapons on the IM Grav Tanks).

This one is real sticky. Let us assume you pay a social call on LSP\'s HQ,
and they say \'OK\', but then start using front orginisations to funnel money
thru to the rebels. The rebels then use this hard-to-trace cash to buy guns
off Free Traders.

On Terra, maybe.  

I have to wonder where I slipped up and typed "Marine recruits are sealed
into their Battledress, where they are fore-fed a diet of Prednizone,
caffeine, and Adam Sandler movies to turn them into slavering death-dogs.
If ever let out of the armor, the Marine will hide in the corner crying for
Mr. Bear, his favorite stuffed toy."

What I did say that was *combat ops* Marines will wear their Battledress.
In my day, battle gear was a steel pot, LB-40, M-17A1 gas mask, and a
M-16A1.  I did not wear this when detailed to paint the hallway outside the
Colonel\'s office.  I wore the uniform appropriate for the duty, as assigned
by my chain of command.  If they had told me to paint he hallway in MOPP 4,
I would have done so.

So we have our Marines doing peacekeeper duty, keeping two minorities
(let\'s call them Less Filing and Tastes Great) apart while the nobles and
diplomats try to find a peaceable end.  The majority of Marines in the
compound are going to be in fatigues, doing the day-to-day job of living.
Sentries will be suited up, and locked into the base sensor net.  A ready
squad might be in armor, waiting to rush out and provide cover.  The guys
who just got off sentry duty are scrubbing themselves in the shower, while
that day\'s KP staff are attempting to make combat rations look good.

A few miles away a Force Ensign is running a check point.  He\'s in field
undress, to better deal with the local police and population.  The fireteam
manning the post is in armor, as an implied threat.

So despite the Marines being ready for combat (the entire company can suit
up within five or six minutes), the majority of Marines will not be suited
up for their day to day business.

These would be the GURPS characters who just buy the basic 4 points of
Battlesuit and leav it at that.  The base DX in the template is 11, so this
gives you skill-12, which os described as "Rather skilled"

Officers tend to branch out due to the limited opportunities for command at
higher levels.  There are only so many slots for Fleet Colonels after all!

Pretty good comparison.  It\'s been years since I read Pournelle (meeting

again.

On that note, a good set of reads can be found in the Starfist series.

Also there is a hard limit of 1,000,000 dtons for any ship in CT. Whether
this means tender+riders can\'t exceed 1,000,000 or whether the tender alone
can\'t exceed that figure depends on how you interpret the rules. I myself
would say that tender and riders combined can\'t exceed 1,000,000 dtons, but
I admit that it\'s debatable.

        There is an interesting Star Trek graphic novel called "Debt of
Honor" which I have.  Without going into the plot, at one point, Kirk and a
Romulan captain of similar reknown discover a Klingon battleship that is
wrecked in space.  Aboard, they discover the ship is a cloak-equiped planet
buster a spinal phaser array capable of doing a "Death Star" on any
habitable world.

        The Romulan\'s comment is that if she reported that the ship existed
to her Command, the Romulans would go to war with the Klingons in an
instant.  It would be a genocide war with no quarter and no middle ground,
with racial survival at stake.

        I sorta view the Star Trigger as that kind of weapon.  Everyone
knows they can do it.  Fine.  Its  a great "Please Leave Us Alone... Or
Else" kind of weapon.  First time they vape another stellar nation\'s system
with it in aggression, their neighbours would be pouring attack fleets
across the border like a tidal wave to prevent these lunatics from every
threatening that kind of genocide again.

        JMHO.

I\'m pretty sure this isn\'t true.  My boss\' son is just finishing boot, and 
since my boss is a retired Marine colonel, I\'m sure I\'d be hearing if
they\'d watered down the course that far.

The DIs can\'t *touch* you without consent anymore, which is designed to
avoid situations where DIs were beating boots within an inch of their lives
for no apparent purpose.  A few even died at the hands of the DIs, which
was totally unacceptable.  And they can\'t curse at you, but it hardly
matters what they say if they use the right tone of voice.

If you want a good idea about modern Marine Corps boot, read Tom Ricks\'
_Making of the Corps_  It\'s an interesting book, written by a Wall Street
Journal reporter who is definitely not a Marine.  Does a good job of
capturing the evolution of civilian to Marine, but also raises some
questions about what happens when the Marine Corps values and those of the 
rest of society become too disparate to reconcile.

What is true is that recruits at Ft. Benning are now given "stress cards."
If they feel overworked, then can pull the cards and take a little time out.

<Imperial rules of war and Imperial intervention>

>It\'s goanna be a lot more complex IMO.


<Shrug> Maybe, maybe not. It\'s going to depend on many different factors.
Terrain is a big one, technological sophistication of the combatants, etc...

It\'s an assumption that even Mercenary makes and spells out on the very
first page:

"Conflicting local interests often settle their differences by force of
arms, with Imperial forces looking quietly the other way, unable to
effectively intervene as a police force in any but the most wide-spread of
conflicts without jeopardizing their primary mission of the defense of the
realm. Only when local conflicts threaten either the security or the economy
of the area to Imperial forces take an active hand, and then it is with
*speed and overwhelming force*" (Emphasis mine)

(Book 4: Mercenary, p.1, Introduction)

Now, I\'m not going to presume to speak for Marc, Loren, Frank, nor any of
the earliest Traveller authors. However, it seems to me that even from the
early point when Mercenary was written (1978) that this was the intended
concept.

No. Let me rephrase that. It was essential to the creation of the Third
Imperium as we know it. Upon rereading the introduction it\'s obvious that
this is the rationale for why mercenary campaigns are possible at all.

Now, I know that Frank Chadwick doesn\'t mention the Imperial marines
specifically here. In point of fact, it would appear that the Imperium
setting had not yet matured to the level we think of it now. I cite the
following comment, from the same page: "Traveller assumes a remote
centralized government (referred to in this volume as the Imperium),
possessed of great industrial and technological might, but unable, due to
the sheer distances and travel times involved, to exert total control at all
levels everywhere within its star-spanning realm."

I\'m not sure how the Imperium would react to such a situation... or if it
would, in fact, actually be a violation of the Imperial rules of war.

How are those free traders getting through? A world *is* a big place, but
not when you have naval vessels in space prepared for such a contingency.
Only lucky free traders would manage to get through without being turned
away and / or boarded.

Of course, it depends on the situation. Traveller was originally designed in
the late 70s, when the threat of nuclear war was the real kicker that
everyone was worried about. Advances and the easy availability of other
"weapons of mass destruction" might require us to broaden the scope from
nuclear weapons (wave a damper over it) to any weapon of mass destruction
that is intended to be used as a last resort.

However, simply waving a damper over the area doesn\'t have the psychological
effect of dropping Imperial marines to the surface spewing plasma and death.

Yes, I am. As I said at the outset, if the sides are clearly identifiable
(a WWI-type conflict) I am reasonably convinced the Imperial Marines can
handle whatever comes their way.

But Vietnam is only one example of a type of conflict that is far more
common than open warfare, and just as destructive in the long run.

You are assuming in turn that there are identifiable "supply lines"
separate from  everyday trade and commerce, or that there is a "heat of
battle" into which to drop.

>There are many other methods that don\'t rely on what our late 20th century
>view of peace-keeping and police actions are.

In the last century, the US (to cite one example) has been involved in
about 70 identifiable "conflicts", but only 7 "real" wars (counting Korea,
Vietnam, and Panama). Participation in the "UN School" of peacekeeping is a
recent phenomenon; the vast majority of these were unilateral actions
undertaken for reasons of national interest or policy. So I, at least, am
not relying on the "white truck/blue beret" approach.

>Of course, the Imperial rules of war seem to imply that once the trade and

This is also what triggered the US interventions in Haiti (twice), the
Dominican Republic (twice), Nicaragua, and Lebanon (twice). Note that none
of these were originally under the auspices of the UN.

Look at it this way: no matter how you go about "keeping the peace", sooner
or later you\'re going to leave and turn the situation back over to the
natives. If all you did was make them hate you more than they hate each
other, then as soon as you are gone they will quite happily go back to
slaughtering one another -- cf. Yugoslavia. To keep from having to come
back in one year or ten and do it all over again, it is necessary to
address the real causes. 

Similarly, no "excessive extraplanetary interest" worthy of the name is
going to be easy to find, much less prove. Considering the influence that
megacorporations wield in the Imperium, I\'d say some sort of proof is a
prerequisite for taking decisive action.

I don\'t know -- if every conflict goes on long enough to send in the Army,
then perhaps all the Marines need do is suppress everyone without
understanding the situation. That is a recipe for disaster, however, in
that it leaves the Marines open to manipulation by all sides. It also
precludes quick resolutions, even in relatively simple matters, because the
Marines can\'t be expected to use any diplomatic tact at all. That seems
unnecessarily restrictive, and goes back to my "blunt instrument" comment:

"To a man with only a hammer, all problems look like nails."

You are not the only party to this debate, however. Doug Berry, with his
proposed disregard for collateral damage, has said (in essence) just that.
If nothing else, you have argued that there is no need to enlist the help
or understanding (or even avoid alienating) the natives, on the strength
that the Marines can overcome any possible resistance. I consider this
obtuse, to say the least.

If there *is* a large battle, I agree 100%. But if the Marines are dropping
into a Northern Ireland gone bad? Sure, they would have no trouble picking
out the British Army -- but are those really the guys they _need_ to find,
even just to put an end to the immediate fighting? This is a much more
likely scenario than a stand-up fight.

And if the local pooh-bah\'s name is Kim Il-Sung? or Saddam Hussein? or
Mu\'ammar al-Qadhafi? Not everyone is equally impressed with threats, and
_all_ wars result from a miscalculation on somebody\'s part.

It was a borderline complaint, IMO. My take on this was, "The popups

complaint wasn\'t against the original TOS, but the IP-threatening

Of course, I have heard homesteaders complaining about Geocities...

What will probably happen is the Marines will land to deal with the
immediate problem (the displacement of civilians.) They will put a stop to
this by whatever means deemed necessary by the Task Force Commander.  Once
the situation stabilizes, then investigations can begin into who is to
blame for the problem.  If necesary the Marines, now replaced by Army
troops for a long term partition, can whomp all over Washington and take
Tricky Dick and Kissinger out.

Just how credible is a threat to set off a Star Trigger in a system that

IRC, the Darrians went to a lot of trouble to keep the details of the
Star Trigger to themselves. If all you know is, "Darrians can blow up
stars" - and you don\'t know what the limits on this capability are - you\'re
more likely to tread carefully around them. This is exactly what the 
Darrians want out of the deal.

That does make some sense - smaller-scale, lower-threat activities I\'ve

Mercenary groups and such. It doesn\'t quite explain the relative rarity
of Battle Dress skill amongst Marines (from Book 4), but I suppose it\'s
no big deal to assign Battle Dress-0 to *active duty* Marines - assume
that most Marines just *wear* the suit (the BD-0 troopies), and thus
quickly forget the tricks when they\'re no longer wearing it regularly,
while some (BD-1+ troopies) really got the knack for it - where others
are just wearing it, these guys are living it.

        Hi, Chris!
        Just wanted to comment on this last little bit.  The problem with
these dictators is that they know that there is a un-written ROE amongst
nations that says "no assassinating the other guy\'s President".  On Earth,
RealLife(tm) say the US picked off and did so overtly (or even covert and
the only the espionage community knew about it), say Saddam, as a method of
disposing of the threat.  That immediatley puts the US president in the
firing line;  as has been proven at least twice in the 20th Century...  the
Bad Guy will get through security.
        So "we don\'t do that".
        They know this.  This affects how seriously they take the sabre
rattling...  its just the peasants who are going to suffer, not them.
They\'ll have lights,oil, food and medicine, even if thier subjects don\'t.
So, they can ignore us.
        Remember the F-111 raid over Libya?  Heard anything from al-Qadhafi
since?  Nope.  They almost killed him...  He got the message.  He didn\'t try
a serious reprisal against the US, because he knew they\'d get it right the
second time.

        In the 3i, the Marines will get it right the first time. Some Duke\'s
cousin\'s fourth son doesn\'t have an inheritance, and y\'know, that little
world just might be the right opportunity for him to show his stuff.  So,
yeah, if the local dictator doesn\'t catch on and play nice, make sure that
he "gets dealt with" when the drop capsules start touching down in the capital.
        Is yon petty dictator going to threaten to off the sub-sector duke
if he gets sniped at?  Not a hope.  He\'ll hear the Marines are coming, and
realize the quickest way to hang onto power is to meet the troop carrier in
orbit with his yacht and open the starport to them.  And be the first to the
barganing table so that the noble sent with the troop ship to mediate feels
that he\'s not the problem.

<<<Digging up a six year old conversation on the science of Jurassic Park>>>

Actually, the Y chromosome coding for males is limited to mammals. Reptiles
and birds code for sex using different chromosome pairs and other
variables. Some examples, the sex distribution of a clutch of sea turtle
eggs can be predicted before they are born if you know the temperature
history history of the nest. If it\'s in a colder environment, the eggs will
turn male, warmer, female. In certain species of birds, paired identical
chromosomes lead to male offspring, paired non-identical chromosomes lead
to female offspring. In these cases, Parthogenesis does lead to male
offspring.

I would suggest a reasonable range of uniforms.

1. Dress Maroons (with an additional dinner dress tie and tails version for
officers and senior NCO\'s). The uniform a Marine is most likely to wear a
**Dress** Cutlass with.  Full Dress Maroons mean ribbons and medals and
definitely include cutlass and side arm.
2. Utility uniform. Grey with maroon highlights. Fatigues. What a Marine
would wear while aboard ship or while servicing his BD.  Has lots of pockets
and an equipment belt for stuff.
3. Combat armor. Used where BD is too much. Typically worn for low key
roles, like Embassy duty or by Officers on Starport duty, with a few Marines
in BD for muscle. Typically chameleon cloth, Grey with maroon highlights
when in neutral.
4. Battle Dress. see GT:SM p61.
5. Battle Dress Maroons. Worn by Marines assigned to the Imperial Guard.
Worn by Marines anywhere engaged in policing and guarding duties where they
need to inspire awe as well as kick ass.  The cutlass worn with this uniform
is definitely not just for show.

[snip]  

I know it\'s forbidden cannon, but Traveller Digest did an article on
"Uniforms of the Terran Occupation," which is all Marine and very long
term. If it\'s possible not to contradict that source, it would be nice.  

> 3. Combat armor. Used where BD is too much. 

I\'d suggest this should be a Combat Environment Suit, possibly with
clamshell torso armor.  There\'s too much overlap between real "Combat
Armor" and BD; both are sealed, spacesuit types of armor.  A trooper in CES
with a conventional open helmet will be a lot more approachable.  That can
be a good thing in lots of low intensity conflicts.

> 4. Battle Dress. see GT:SM p61.

No, no, a thousand times no.  This particular battledress is an
abomination, preferably never to be mentioned again. It\'s too big, too
fast, and too heavily armored to be any fun at all.  The stock BD in GT or
possibly an uprated TL12 version would be perfectly sufficient.  I\'d just
as soon not have Vehicles-style stats for it or only minimal ones, not the
full write-up they did for the commando-BD in Star Mercs.

I\'d say that the chameleon circuit in the standard BD should be tunable to
maroon for dress occasions.  DGP did something along those lines, but it\'s
such an obvious idea that it\'s hard not to include.

And let me second the request for hyperdense cutlasses. When driven by
powered armor strength, they can go through battledress reliably and safely
(for friendly forces, that is) Marines don\'t even necessarily have to have
two blades, since a ST 11 person can, just barely, wield a hyperdense
cutlass.  Interchangeable fittings, a fancy guard, scabbard, and swordknot
for dress occasions, would be a lot cheaper.

Not everyone, I actually like the disad for those who have only seen
battle will in BD or CA (which could apply to 90% of MTU marines).

This is closer to my complaint.  NO Previous version of Traveller has
manditory BD skill for marines in character generation.  And if all
marines use BD every time they go into combat, more would have BD skill
upon mustering out (Check, one suit of Battledress.  Check, one Fusion
Gun. And check, BD skill. All issued property has been returned, have a
good retirement Marine.)

What does this level of skill equate to in the other versions of
Traveller(CT, MT, TNE, and T4).

It is a good change and protects the you as poster/publisher.  If they
use any of your Intellectual property for other purposes, you can sue them
for infringement.

The line about ownership is simply "plain" language for those not
savvy with copyright law.  The original term didn\'t transfer ownership.
The current one doesn\'t either.  Although it does transfer all the same
rights as the owner, it is "non-exclusive", meaning the owner doesn\'t
give up any rights.  If it was ownership, you\'d lose all rights you had
to material as soon as you posted it.  Sure, its a fine point, but literally
speaking, it doesn\'t restrict your rights as owner.  This is a "six and one
half dozen" issue.

Without the right to publish the material, as has been said elsewhere,
they couldn\'t let anyone view your pages.  They would be left as nothing
more than a file-storage place for you.

The TOS is an agreement.  You post a webpage, you agree to the terms.
This is an implied contract, the requirements of which are fulfilled by
the performance of the parties.  You post, you give permission.
As long as you have notice of this, there is no problem, legally
speaking.

Actually, its Yahoo who has been taking a cue from many other ISPs.
Check yours to make sure you haven\'t already agreed to similar
terms.  Yahoo is catching the hell for terms that many other ISPs use.

Check with other free web publishers before you start boycotting.
You may be left all alone, since yahoo didn\'t invent these terms.
And once you know, its caveat emptor, buyer beware, foretold is forewarned,
etc.

Exactly.  By gaining full rights to edit webpages, which may
create legal liability, they have the authority to remedy any
problem situation immediately.  Which will often be all that
complaintants want.  Also, it gives them the authority to
deal with "borderline" material which isn\'t clearly illegal
but is problematic.  Earlier, I gave the example of "how
to make a pipe bomb"  vs. "combustive chemical reactions"
pages.  They might well contain the same material.  It might
be protected by the First Amendment.  But Geocities/Yahoo
doesn\'t have to let it exist on webpages that they maintain.
If you accept the agreement and publish such material on
their site, they can edit it or remove it.  Thats the ticket you
buy when you publish with them.  Want your full rights?
Publish elsewhere.  They\'re not the government and you
have other outlets.

The old agreement is binding until both parties agree to the new one.

They made a clarification today, that loggin in to remove your
pages, etc., didn\'t equate to acceptance of the old terms.  IIRC,
someone else said that there was still an easy way to access Geocity pages
without agreeing to the new terms.

Theft is the conversion of property to which you have no legal
right.  They have legal rights derived from the contract that you
agree to when you accept the deal.  As long as there is notice
of the terms, there is no legal problem.

Its a contract.  Fail to read the terms at your own peril.
Agree to them, and you can\'t complain.

This also might be of interest to The Roc as well, as he claimed that B4:M
supported the idea that battle dress and battle dress skill was assumed to
be quite rare according to CT canon as set forth in B4:M.

On one hand, yes, no previous version of Traveller chargen forces marines to
have battle dress, there are some things that we need to keep in mind:

1.) B4:M was designed to be a resource book for mercenary campaigns. It\'s
not a resource book for active duty soldiers.

2.) The Imperium as set forth in B4:M was quite different than the one we
have now. I\'ve skimmed through the book and nowhere does it seem to indicate
that the rules are designed to create ex-*Imperial* marines. Just
ex-marines, which is an important distinction. For example, according to
B4:M\'s chargen, a character cannot receive skill in battle dress *at all* if
their homeworld is not CTTL-12. Keep in mind that when Mercenary came out
Traveller was still a "generic" space game, just like (A)D&D was a generic
swords & spells game. There were certain *assumptions* in both games, but
they were still intended to be more or less generic. I\'d welcome a
correction from Marc Miller, Frank Chadwick or Loren Wiseman, but I don\'t
think I\'m too far off base here. So, the character creation systems were
purposefully somewhat "generic."

To some extent, the early Traveller books had to cross over certain lines.
Think about how *little* source material covering the Imperium existed for
Trav by the time that B4:M came out. If you don\'t believe that the
prevailing attitude was different, check out Andy Slack\'s excellent
"Backdrop of Stars" and the advice he gives in that article. (Note: Andy
just moved his page, http://www.halfwaystation.freeserve.co.uk/ is the new
address, I\'m not sure if he has it up there).

In my humble opinion, and others may differ on this point, the important
point is retaining the *spirit* of Classic Traveller canon, not the
specifics.

If anyone wants to see the relative rarity of skills, please take a look at
the MOS table on p. 6, under the Marine column. Please note that, with the
exception of the level in gun combat received during basic, if your
homeworld is CTTL-12+ you\'re exactly as likely to get "Gun Cmbt" as you are
to get "Battle dress." You also have a 1 in 6 chance to get heavy weapons.

In fact, let\'s look at the averages:

CTTL-11- Infantry: 4 in 6 chance of getting a weapon skill. 4 Snake Eater
points.
CTTL-12+ Infantry: 3 in 6 chance of getting a weapon skill. 3 Snake Eater
points.
CTTL-11- Marine: 3 in 6 chance of getting a weapon skill. 3 Snake Eater
points.
CTTL-12+ Marine: 2 in 6 chance of getting a weapon skill. 2 Snake Eater
points.

(Note: Marines and Infantry both get a point in Gun Cmbt.)

It\'s interesting to look at it that way. In fact, it almost seems a waste to
play a high-tech marine, except of course that you get a 1 in 6 chance of
getting Battle Dress.

Wait just a minute. This is awfully strange... If I\'m not imagining things,
B4:M seems to solidly support the concept that the lowly grunt will, all
things being equal, be better in non-Battle Dress combat than the mighty
marine. Hmmm...

However, an interesting dilemna pops up. I call your attention to B4:M page
43 under "Part II: Overview of Equipment: Infantry Small Arms and Personal
Equipment" I\'ll type out the important parts, it\'ll save the wear and tear
on the spine of your own copy:

"Tech level 11: Combat armor is available... but expense precludes general
issue."

This is acceptable, however only marines who serve as ship\'s troops are
capable of getting the proper skill to use combat armor if their homeworld
is CTTL-11. However, B4:M is unclear on this. I can\'t find a reference that
states that Vacc Suit is required to use Combat Armor in B4:M. However, my
copy of The Traveller Book says that this is so. Does anyone know if this
rule introduced *after* B4:M?

CTTL-12 introduces the gauss rifle and the grav belt, which is "used for
scouting purposes." No mention is made of personal armor.

"Tech level 13: All infantry is generally now in combat armor... Battle
dress is issued to selected assault troops."

If your character is serving in a CTTL-13 military, he\'s assumed to be using
combat armor. There\'s a big problem though. A non-marine infantry soldier
from a CTTL-13 world has only a 1 in 6 chance of getting Vacc Suit. Very
strange. A marine, once again, can only get Vacc Suit if he serves onboard a
ship for that time period. On the other hand, a high-tech marine has a 1 in
6 chance of getting battle dress skill, as does a high-tech commando. So
battle dress skill seems to be properly rare for the tech level.

"Tech level 14: A higher number of infantry is equipped with battle
dress..."

Doesn\'t look that way from the table on page 6. In fact, CTTL-14 is treated
exactly the same as CTTL-13 for the purposes of acquiring skills.

"Tech level 15: Most infantry is by now equipped with battle dress and has
converted to the FGMP-14."

Most infantry? Bah! Not according to the table on page 6! Well, of course,
that\'s unless you consider a 1 in 6 chance for a marine to get the skill and
a 1 in 6 chance for a commando to get the skill to be "most infantry."

So, which should it be then?

The letter of the law (a few rows and columns on the top of page 6), which
says that battle dress skill is rather rare.

The spirit of the law (a series of descriptions of the battlefield at
different tech levels), which happens to say another thing entirely.

Mercenary does not say that marines are real hardcore combat monsters,
struggling through massive amounts of weapons training in order to get the
chance just to *peek* at a suit of battle dress.

In fact, my resolve is strengthened. However, for the time being, I\'m
finished with both the rarity of battle dress arguments and the toughness of
non-BD marines vs. non-BD infantry. B4:M seems to speak very clearly on the
subject. In my opinion, not only is Doug\'s view of the Imperial marines easy
to rectify with B4:M, it actually keeps true to the spirit of the holiest of
Classic Traveller supplemental tomes.

That isn\'t how I interpret High Guard. I believe that the phrase:

"Eash specific tonnage level includes all values between it and the
 next highest stated level"

means that code Y is 1,000,000dt *and up* (since size Z isn\'t used).
Also such ships can be controlled by a model 7 computer and thus
built at TL13.

In practice, tenders much bigger than 1Mdt don\'t save a lot per
rider deployed, can still be destroyed by a single spinal mount hit
and are inflexible in deployment.

Unless you want something capable of Jump-6 whilst deploying 200kdt
buffered planetoids, the fact that the optimal rider seems to be in
the 10-30kdt range (getting smaller as TL rises) suggests that ships
bigger that 1Mdt are pretty rare.

High Guard has the line:

"Big craft require tonnage equal to 110% of their mass in the ship"

This tends to suggest that, if you want your 1Mdt tender to carry
500kdt of riders, then you only have 450kdt available for other systems.

I\'d have thought a marine in BD, wielding a cutlass, would do even less
damage to the ship.

The entry for combat armour in CT Book 1 states that Vacc Suit -1 or better
is required to use it.

The description of Vacc Suit skill in Book 1 states "the individual has
been trained and has experience in the use of the standard vacuum suit ...
including armored battle dress ...".
Battle Dress skill, as defined in B4:M, is the same as Vacc Suit, but adds
the ability to use the PGMP-13 & FGMP-14 safely.  Someone without Battle
Dress skill has a chance of mishap when firing these weapons, with Vacc
Suit skill acting as a beneficial modifier.

The apparent intent was that Vacc Suit skill was fine for using battle
dress for all things *except* when weapon systems only usable with battle
dress were used.

I THINK its the issue with the picture of that ship from Niven\'s "The
Mote in God\'s Eye" travelling accross the cover.  Not too sure.  And
before you go lording it over that you have all those, <evil grin>, bear
in mind I have a mint condition, original publication of "Who Goes
There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr.  :)

Also have an original of Ringworld which Niven himself claims is a
collectors\' item due to the incorrect math and such used in it. 
(apparently some MIT students read him the riot act and in later
publications he re-dressed his earlier blunders.)

There\'s at least one story where a star seed is watched as it "sets

It\'s established in "World of Ptavvs" that Bandersnatchi are

Another one I recall was a commander who incurred heavy casualties
among his troops by insisting on recovering the bodies of anyone killed
in action. 

This can turn a single casualty into a real meat grinder.

Actually, eco-systems *do* compete. That\'s how we get things like the
progression from grassland to "climax forest" after a fire. 

An area will have the ecosystem best suited to it. But some ecosystems
change the conditions such that *other* eco-systems are now better
suited. Thus the "succesion" phenomenon.

No idea. I assume there\'s some way to figure it out from the strength
of the planet\'s magnetic field, the speed of rotation, the size of the
planet, and how active the star is. 

Earth has its Van Allen belts, but they are smaller.

The ships seem to be shielded well enough to survive short periods in
the belts.

Burying is easier than trying to find a bunch of lead. Also, it pays to
keep in mind that since this is particle radiation, you have to watch
out for secondary radiation. With high speed particles, you can
actually be safer with *less* shielding, as the high speed particles
mostly zip right through you. But any that hit shielding create
"showers" of secondary particles. These, because they move more slowly
will almost all get stopped by the body. This is why our spacecraft
right now *don\'t* carry shielding.

In orbit, you could *try* playing games with magnetic fields, but the
problem with that is that they deflect charged particles in opposite
directions depending on the charge. And also, if they deflect stuff
past the "equator" they\'ll be guiding it directly *into* the poles.
Oops! 

And the magnetic field would interact with the *planet\'s* field and
screw up your orbit *seriously*.

So the only real solution is lots of mass (dirt, rock, water, whatever)
between you and the source. In orbit, it\'ll be all around you. So the
best bet is to have a thick hull, and then put all the water tankage
just inside that and storage areas for stuff that radiation won\'t hurt
inside that. After all, this *isn\'t* the sort of "radiation" that makes
things radioactive. You could store just about anything but seeds and
film near the hull.

You *can* stack spheres, but for maps or co-ordinate systems, gaps are
a no-no. 

Also, they recently proved that the densest packing of spheres in 3d
space is cubic. I forget whether it is "face centered" or "body
centered". But it\'s essentially the stack you get with layers like this:

1
4
9
16

In other words, a square grid, with alternate layers offset 50%. Oddly,
hex grids are equivalent to "staggered square" type grids. So stacked
hex maps (stacked with the hexes on top of each other) actually make
sense. 

Just like the old Star Force: Alpha Centauri "light-zulus".

OK, here\'s the conversion, both ways. It\'s in Pascal (more or less) but
should be easy to convert:

Phi:	angle from the positive X-axis, measured in the X-Y plane
	range 0 to 360

Theta:	Angle above or below the X-Y plane
	range +90 to -90

Rectangular to polar:

Function atn2(y,x : real):real;
  const
    rad=0.0174532925199433;
  var
    ax,ay,phi :real;
  begin
    if (x=0.0) and (y=0.0) then
      atn2 := 0.0
    else
    begin
      ax := abs(x);
      ay := abs(y);
      if (ax>ay) then
        phi := arctan(ay/ax)/rad
      else
        phi := 90.0-arctan(ax/ay)/rad;
      if (x<0.0) then phi := 180.0-phi;
      if (y<0.0) then phi := -phi;
      atn2 := phi
    end
  end;

procedure polar(x,y,z : real; var r,theta,phi : real);
  var 
    rho : real;
  begin
    rho := x^2 + Y^2;
    R := sqrt( rho^2 + z^2);
    Phi := atn2(y,x);
    if phi<0 then phi:=phi+360.0;
    rho := sqrt(rho);
    theta := atn2(z,rho)
  end;

Now for polar to rectangular:

procedure cart (r,theta,phi : real; x,y,z :real);
  var
    rcst : real;
  begin
    rcst := r*cos(theta);
    x := rcst * cos(phi);
    y := rcst * sin(phi);
    z := r* sn(theta)
  end;

The Med Service doctors in Leinster\'s stories are rather more
resourceful than that. They have to be. You see, in his universe,
interstellar war isn\'t practical for several reasons. Thus no "Imperial
Marines".

But just stop and think what a *really* upset doctor with facilities
capable of things like *routine* curing planetwide plagues can do to
the people he\'s upset with.

Slight problem. You have to agree to the new terms before they\'ll let
you modify *anything* on your web-site. That includes deleting files. 

On the brighht side, setting it up that way pretty much guarantees that
they\'ve shot themselves in the foot. By not allowing you to removing
things *without* "agreeing" to the new terms, odds are that they\'ve
made your agreement worthless.

On the other hand, don\'t forget to tell your customers to tell Yahoo
that they *demand* their material be removed from all existing backups.

It depends. *That* is an area where the law ain\'t at all clear. But
they\'ve definitely gone overboard. They could cover their ass with
regards to publishing rights in re allowing access to your web site
*without* all this "in perpetuity" stuff.

The problem is that the *original* use of the Star Trigger is supposed

Years back there was an adventure (possibly in the CT Darrians book?)
that had the players discover that the Star Trigger as then
deployed was a collossal bluff. It wouldn\'t work. But in the process
they discover what *did* trigger y\\the original disaster. And with that
info, it wouldn\'t take all that long to reconfigure the non-working
Star Triggers into something that really would work.

    'body' => '* Body Plans
The history of life on Earth suggests that body form becomes tightly
conserved once a lineage is established. For example, all vertebrates
have a head at one end of the spinal cord and four limbs.
	Looking back into the fossil record, one can see that a huge range of
potential \'ancestors\' were generated in the Cambrian \'explosion\' where
life attempted to exploit all niches available to it at the time. The
Ediacaran flora and fauna and other fossils found in the Burgess shale
look decidely strange.
	As Steven Jay Gould attests, if things happened a little differently,
we wouldn\'t be here ; intelligence may or may not have arisen in another
lineage.
	However, the overall sequence aquatic -> land plants -> amphibians ->
land animals -> flying animals seems a reasonable one.

	In practical terms, the following flags suggest themselves :-
1. Habitat :- aquatic, amphibious, land, aerial, triphibian
2. Neuraxis :- vertebrates and invertebrates have only one spinal cord
or central set of ganglia. Multiple brains are unlikely, but multiple
cords are not.
3. Endo or exo-skeleton :- structural support and fulcra to anchor
muscles and tendons to.
	The upper bound for size for exoskeletons (in one g with carbon
compounds) appears to belong to an extinct arthropod whose remains were
recently excavated in Europe. Picture a centipede 2m long and about 0.5m
in diameter! [The largest living arthropods, spider crabs, have bodies
0.5m in diameter and a leg span of up to 1.5m].
4. Number of limbs :- no restriction really ; the limit is on structural
strength (why elephants have thick legs, insects spindly ones and us
somewhere in between).
5. Coverings  :- determined by the creature\'s habitat. Aquatic forms and
flyers need to minimise drag. Some may require insulation depending on
their habitat.
6. Warm or Cold-Blooded? :- does the creature attempt to maintain a
constant core temperature or not?

* Plants
Could be considered as being made up of the following :-
- - Energy collecting system (e.g. leaves)
- - Nutrient collecting system (e.g. roots)
- - Skeletal system (e.g. the woody parts of stems, tree trunks)
- - Circulatory system (e.g. xylem and phloem vessels which rely on
capillary flow)
- - Reproductive system (e.g. flowers, seed cones, etc).
They also have well developed immune and hormonal systems ; but unlike
animals these do not appear to be based in specific \'organs\'.

<I would like to get some background info on the Ahetaowa     
[Ahetaowa/Ihearu (Ealiyasiyw 2604)], if these are the intelligent plant
race.>

* Ecology
This is well covered in \'First In\' and other Traveller books.
The only point I could add is the \'10% rule\' :- each level of a food
pyramid is 10% the size of the level below.

E.g. 100kg of producers (plants, etc.) supports 10kg of primary consumer
(herbivore) supports 1kg of secondary consumer (carnivore), etc.

* A \'Worked Example\'
This world caught my eye in BtC :-
i. Zeta 2 (Vilis 0919) :- This world apparently has oceans of hydrogen
fluoride and a Hot climate (average temperature 314-319K).
Since hydrogen fluoride boils at 292K at one atmosphere\'s pressure,
surface atmospheric pressure must be several atmospheres. The Viji, if
native to Zeta 2, have HF as a solvent system.
	Using fluorine as a metabolic reactant would have explosive
consequences ; but a methane or phosgene -> carbon dioxide system is a
viable alternative.
	CO2 could exert the atmospheric pressure required to keep the oceans
from boiling away ; it is also a good greenhouse gas.
	Since the average surface temperature is 41 to 46 degrees C, the
Viji must \'tick over\' at a higher temperature than this. Metabolic rate
scales with the fourth power of temperature - and being \'not much more
than microscopic in size\' they will metabolise even faster, by Kleiber\'s
law.
	A small, hot, compressed lifeform which apparently has a group
sentience? A truly alien alien, and that\'s ignoring the \'silicon based\'
bit.

Gahhh... I\'ve run out of steam.
What next? (Polite suggestions, please!)

You forgot to mention "hydrostatic" skeleton type (tough gristle-like
segments filled with some sort of fluid).

A study of earth\'s life forms can give a wide array of different things.

For instance, Bees see in the ultraviolet and use the earth\'s magnetic
field to guide them.  Sharks sense electrical fields when the water is
too clogged with blood to see.  The Rattlesnake has infrared pits all
over that can detect a temperature difference of a 10th of a degree.

Small insects have open ciculatory systems and a passive breathing
arrangement thru tubes in their carapace that lead right to the
bloodstream.  This is why man-sized insects are impossible.  they\'d
suffocate without some other form of non-passive oxygenation.

Multi-faceted eyes work great on small scale, but a man-sized critter
would be nearly blind.

To be honest, this item didn\'t occur to me when I was working on the First

You seem to confirm my uninformed opinion of this though - if the week

that a jump takes is measured in _system_ time, there isn\'t much you

I still think the slickest way past this whole FTL = time travel
business is to say (as I have IMTU) that Jump takes *approximately* one
week in Jump Space time, which is not directly related to any particular
relative frame in our universe.  For my purposes though, time spent in
Jump Space seems to match _system_ (or low speed with relation to C)
time best.

My question is -- if not the Imperial Marines, who? The Imperial Army? S3?

From all accounts, the problem-solving techniques used by the Imperial
military do not seem to have derived the same benefit from the advance of
years as technology has. The Imperium is probably up the same creek Britian
is when it comes to stopping a conflict like that going on in Northern
Ireland.

The way the Imperial Marines are organized and equipped may not necessarily
be what works best for every situation. In the same way that modern armies
have difficulties with certain duties they are given, the IM are going to
have difficulties with certain actions. This does not mean that the
Imperium doesn\'t use them, though.

	Certainly. While in a solvent.

	So do the limits of endoskeletons. Your point should be
	that the disadvantages of larger size accumulate faster

The folks writing the stuff I\'ve read seem to be fairly sure."

	Try reading: Schmidt-Nielsen, K. 1984. Scaling: why is 
	body size so important? Cambridge University Press, N.Y.

Yep. Even a "typical" tarantula has a body that\'s far bigger than any
insect can have. And there are spiders with bodies even larger. The
infamous "bird-eating" spider comes to mind.

	"Far bigger?" A little digging on my part produced a weight of
	about 4 oz for the largest known bird-eating spiders. The
	goliath beetle (which can fly) is about 3.5 oz. The goliath
	beetle is about 5" long, while the largest bird-eating
	spiders have a leg span of about 13", and an extinct dragon-
	fly had a wingspan of about 24". A large tarantla is not even 
	larger than known insects, let alone comparing a "typical"
	tarantula to possible insects that could be even bigger (If
	a flying insect can be so big, requiring lightness and high
	metabolic rate, then a relatively sedentary insect could 
	probably be considerably bigger).

"BTW, one of the big limits on exoskeletons is a combination of lack 
of leverage as the limbs get larger, and problems with load bearing 
at joints. There\'s just too much "stuff" going through the joints."

	"A mechanical analysis, based on fundamental principals of 
	mechanics, suggest that an exoskeleton is superior to an 
	endoskeleton in regard to failure by buckling and bending. 
	When it comes to forces of impact, however, ...the exoskeleton 
	is at a disadvantage, particularly for large and active animals 
	such as vertebrates."
		-Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984 (p. 53)
	Once again, each has it\'s own advantages and disadvantages. 
	Endoskeletons gain more advantages as body size increases.
	We have not necessarily seen the upper limit on body size for
	terrestrial organisms with an exoskeleton and/or tracheal
	respiration.

Actually, a major secondary reason why assassination is discouraged is that it
doesn\'t work worth a damn, because most of those people are professional
paranoids with local enemies who are already better situated to set up an
assassination than the CIA is, and would be perfectly happy to do so if an
opportunity arose.  Also, for every \'bad guy\' who gets through security, a
hundred more don\'t.

Incidentally, an argument can be made that Reagan bombing Tripoli was an
attempted assassination, and blowing up some of Miloseviches homes is
definatately a statement that we wouldn\'t feel terribly bad about killing him..
Again, these people are professional paranoids (does anyone have any idea how
many different bunkers Hussein has to live in?) and in practice decapitation
strikes against dictators aren\'t going to be all that easy.

Same type or same image specifically? Also, "technically" should there be a
difference between say, biophysical effects and psychological cultivation?

The reason that I\'m quite intrigued by your statements are based on the fact
that I am a voracious horror movie watcher, yet, if anything, I am sort of
anti-conditioned. I wince, for example, when I hear a particularly nasty
story on the news, or visibly shudder when a football player takes what
appears to be a painful fall. What\'s interesting also is that many of my
friends and such *also* are voracious horror movie fans, and the majority of
them have the same sort of sensitivities towards violence.

I\'m not looking for a distinct cause and effect type situation, but what is
known as the cultivation of concepts. I\'ll gladly draw a tenuous connection
between what I\'ve seen with my own eyes and broad societies ;)

Again, is it the same "type" or the same "image." For example, I recall that
there was a psychiatrist who tried the "Clockwork Orange" idea out with
homosexuals. It was a system of electroshock when they appeared to be
getting excited by same sex pornographic imagery. I think during the late
70s or early 80s. He did what you\'re talking about here, and the success
rate was quite low, if I recall correctly.

<shrug> I\'ll agree in a broad sense, but I\'ll disagree on the specifics.
I\'ve easily seen many movies with violence that puts the beginning of Saving
Private Ryan to shame. Yet, during the opening of Saving Private Ryan, for
example, I was asked if I was alright because I had become quite pale and
sickly looking. There are other example I can think of where similar things
have happened to me or others.

It\'s interesting to mention that a friend of mine decided against med-school
because he was completely squicked by blood. Yet he is a huge horror movie
fan.

As long as it has a strong enough field to deflect protons, the fact that it
deflects opposite charges in opposite directions isn\'t a big problem.  For the

The model I\'m working with is a Confederate Army Officer\'s jacket.
Replaces the shiny brass buttons with an alternate fastening method, do the
jacket in a very dark gray with maroon collar patches for rank.  White
trousers with a maroon stripe, polished boots.  Top it off with a maroon
beret, or if your are a SpecOp type, a forest green beret.  Black leather
"Sam Brown" belt to hold up the Cutlass, Dress.

There would be a variety of these. A Marine might have a set of mechanic
coveralls for doing dirty jobs, and set of undress issue for situations
where he has to look good, but Full dress isn\'t called for, daily fatigues
much like the modern day BDU..

Travellers\' Digest #9 showed a member of the Marine Guard in some sort of
parade uniform.  For their "dog and pony" (or would that be dog and poni?)
BD, I imagine highly polished maroon and silver.

(I would just like to point out that I managed to misspell "maroon"
everytime I typed it in this message.  Thank you, I\'ll be here all week.)

Seeing as how everybody seems to hate this, I\'m going to do some work with
Vehicles and design some suits.

But I\'m not going to design for a PC shooting gallery.  These designs are
going to address some of the major complaints made about the Scout/Commando
dress, mainly that you\'d rip off your legs trying to run at full speed.  If
I can lather 800 points of armor on, that\'s what it will get.

Since cammo coatings are avalible in both Traveller and GURPS, it would be
a natural.  I could even see having an onboard-ship pattern with your name,
squad assignment, and drop sequence order in BIG LETTERS front and back, to
assist the Navy crew in loading the Marines into their capsules.

You really want to carry that thing all the way through a four hour

Except this isn\'t a version of Traveller.  It\'s the Traveller setting and
flavor ported to GURPS.  Judging GURPS character creation by Traveller
standards is like saying that Traveller is a poor game because it doesn\'t
do alignments and magic like AD&D.  The two systems are radically different.

For a Traveller character to have the same investment pushed upon him, it
would mean that the CT Marine had *98* other skill levels before taking
Battledress-1.  I have never seen any Traveller character with this many
skills.

>What does this level of skill equate to in the other versions of

The basic investment of 4 points, with a DX 11, gives you Battlesuit-12.
This translates to a 74.1% chance of succeeding at a task with no
modifiers.  Spending 16 points with a DX 11 gives you Battlesuit-14, with a
90.7% chance of succeeding.  How this translates to CT, et al, is left as
an exercise for the reader.

Hm...hadn\'t noticed this initially (sort of skimming this thread), but if we\'re
talking about alien races, this assumption is false -- you can set up genetics
so that either parent is responsible for sex determination, and as I recall
there\'s species on earth which are determined by the mother.

Well, there\'s the option of multiple reproductive schemes (i.e. both sexual and
asexual reproduction are possible).

  Not individual wars, but if the Motie characters are off-handedly referring
to imprecise history/myth then it certainly does apply to things like the
apparent advantage of settled agricultural populations versus hunter-gatherers
wrt population density limitations (i.e., was the displacement and eventual
supplantation of the latter necessarily overwhelmingly violent?).

Totally irrelevant. The point is, each of these "gentlemen" provoked an
armed conflict with an overwhelmingly superior force; in the case of Kim
Il-Sung, with the only power ever to use nuclear weapons in combat, at a
time when it was not at all clear that they wouldn\'t be used again. They
clearly either did not expect to lose, considered the potential rewards
worth the risk, or proceeded from some irrational set of criteria. These
same considerations could apply in any confrontation with the Imperial
Marines. Ergo, the mere threat of overwhelming force is not always sufficient.

[I agree with Anthony, by the way, that if it were possible to assassinate
these individuals, someone would probably have done so. In particular, the
Israelis have consistently demonstrated the capability and the will to
arrange fatal "accidents" for their adversaries, US diplomatic policies not
withstanding. The fact that Saddam Hussein survived after directly
attacking Tel Aviv says to me that he was simply not vulnerable to those
tactics.]

	More like around 4 suits presuming 16 on, 8 off for wartime work and
we eat while fixing the suit.....
	And that Commando suit uses drekloads of batteries, 1 per hour. It
should at least have had two, that way you could hot swap. Otherwise you\'re
stuck in a dead suit in the middle of a possible firefight.

	Much better off here.
	Which means at least two sets of suits per Marine.

	BTW, on that reference to \'ALL\' marines having BD. Please note that
reference is to \'LINE\' Marines, not necessarily others, therefore Ship\'s
Troops, Commando Units and Garrison Marines do not necessarily have BD.

Something I read on Xenobiology a long time ago.  Perhaps it was Poul

The Israelis have never assasinated the sitting head of any state, nor
have they tried, AFAIK. They have assasinated lower-level, quasi-state
functionaries, like that PLO member some years back, and terrorists,
such as "the Engineer", but even the craziest of the Mossad ccowboys
would know better than to try against someone like Assad, Hussein or
Ghadafi. To do so would merely precipitate the kind of all-out war
they\'re trying to avoid.

Whacking a TED is only a viable strategy if your country isn\'t on the

If you design a Marine, he *will* know how to use Battledress.  It\'s a
required skill in the template.  If you decide the rest of his career was
spent as a file clerk at a logistical dump, then his skills will reflect
that choice.  But someday, he might find himself in a position to use the
half-forgotten skill.

In other words, an Imperial Marine in GT will have the CT equivalent of
Battle Dress - 0.  This is enough to avoid negative DMs when using this
equipment, but doesn\'t confer any other advantages.  Not understanding
GURPS very well, it sounds like each IM will have 1 or 2 points of BD
skill required in the template.  It also sounds like the template will
probably  strongly suggest that there be more points spent on BD skill.

They were the Cliaandians, and (IIRC), their uniforms were not quite the
same color as dried blood; rather they were the color blend of half
arterial red and half venous blue blood.

(_All_ Cliaanidans [including the "civilians"] had color-coded
uniforms....)

  FWIW, at least battledress is using similar mobility skills to those that
most people learn in childhood; a battlepod pilot (for those who hate mecha
& b-suits) would probably have to learn an "armoured vehicle warfare" skill
in addition to vehicle and gunnery/heavy weapons skills - _none_ of which
are of any use dismounted!

You can use FTL to communicate with a ship just as easily as a planet. The
only requirement is that you be able to predict its location at the correct
time.

True, you need to be in the light cone of anything in order to receive a
message. This is easy enough to arrange. You can easily communicate with
someone while moving at relativistic velocities; just compensate for the
blue-shift and time dilation.

>The only questions I have are - is the jump
>week relative to the ship, or to the system?

This is a good question. If the "week in jump" is relative to the ship,
ships moving at relativistic speeds will take longer than one week to jump
relative to the outside universe. If it\'s relative to the outside, the
occupants will be in jump less than one subjective week.

Actually, this opens up an enormous can of worms because distance is
dilated as well as time by relativity. A ship moving at relativistic speeds
sees the universe contracted in front of it; at about 0.9c a star 2 parsecs
away is only 1 parsec in the ship\'s frame of reference. This means you
could jump 2, 4, even a hundred parsecs in a scout ship going fast enough,
though it would seem to take proportionally more time from the outside\'s
frame of reference.

To remain most compatible with canon I suggest that all jumps be relative
to the background stars. This means that jumps will take approximately 1
week and require about 10% of the ship\'s displacement in fuel for each
parsec between all destinations that are not in relative motion near the
speed of light. From a ship moving at relativistic speed\'s frame of
reference, however, jumps take more fuel but less time the faster you go. A
ship moving at 0.9c will require 20% its displacement mass of fuel to go 1
ship parsec (which is 2 parsecs to the outside universe), but will get
there in 3.5 days subjective time (but still 1 week to the outside
universe).

Some have proposed making "jump space" a separate frame of reference which
is the same regardless of velocity. I would avoid this. The notion of a
privileged frame of reference which is the same for all observers violates
relativity and apparently has significant consequences to the laws of
physics.

It does from the ship\'s frame of reference, but not from the outside
universe\'s. The problem is that objects with relativistic velocities have
different time axes; "1 week" is different things to the ship and to the
outside universe. As I posted before, it is possible to create a trajectory
in space-time such that a ship can experience outside events in the reverse
order to the rest of the universe. Hence the "time travel" paradox.

Is this right? I thought Augmented BD was TL 13, therefore not generally
available until milieu 200 or so. Please don\'t tell me you think the Rule
of Man had TL 13+...

This is important because my campaign is in milieu 0, and IMTU ABD is
extremely rare, cutting edge tech, and marines generally use armored combat
environment suits.

As an aside, would everyone writing for GURPS Traveller please consider
including rules for earlier Traveller milieu? Not everyone\'s campaign takes
place after the 5FW.

That would be the case if he shook hands with the Hiver ambassador. 
Remember that the Hivers are always sending delegations around within
their own empire specifically to "shake hands" and spread genetic
material around.  Sex for the Hivers is always totally casual, even
anonymous (and child-rearing is left to mother nature).

I agree that tv reporters want soundbites.  Moreover, a reporter who
asks a question that calls for a long and complex answer but expects a
soundbite in response is herself asinine.  The question itself, however,
is not asinine.

I could never figure out how sandcasters could work.  If you run
auto-evade or maneuver-evade, you leave your sand cloud instantly.  

If the other side is going to shoot a beam weapon at you, your first
knowledge of it is when their active sensors lock on you.  Is that time
enough to cast sand before the radar or whatever bounces back to the
other ship and it fires its beam weapon?  

If the other side is going to launch a missile, you have more time
because the missile isn\'t going at light speed, but sandcasters were
marketed as anti-laser technology.

Well, use gravetics to hold it in place.  The other problem is that any sand
cloud dense enough to degrade beam weapons in any important manner will
completely blind you.

Depends on range and design.  Given BL hex sizes, at ranges of more than 1-2
hexes, probably.  Unfortunately, most likely they\'re going to be continually
targeting you with active sensors, not merely when they\'re ready to fire.

Oh, sandcasters are perfectly wonderful anti-KKM technology.  Then again,
there\'s not a serious shortage of such technology.

I think we\'re missing some equipment that Doug hasn\'t mentioned, but no
doubt knows about (and has probably included): GTL12 chemical sniffers and
GTL12 point defense radar.

When I was running a noble in a MegaTraveller campaign, I made extensive
use of high-tech gear. My forensics kit could sniff damn-near anything. If
you accept that MT is canon, then the Imperial Marines can do the same
thing: send squads out with a tech to sniff out the bomb factories.

Likewise, there was an item in the news within the last couple of years
about a system that could track back and locate the source of a sniper\'s
bullet. Add in GTL12 sensors and a dedicated computer, and any Marine squad
on patrol can probably incinerate a sniper.

(I\'m also not cerain what the Marines would be doing in Northern Ireland.
With all due respect to my Irish ancestors, it\'s hardly the kind of planet
that would warrant Imperial attention.)

I presume you mean that "logging in to remove your pages doesn\'t equate to
acceptance of the NEW terms."  I\'ll check it out.  Thanks for the
information.

On a related note, anyone want to host a collection of Traveller vehicles?

Not a cutlass. Claymore or battleaxe, now _those_ are deadly.

When the Azhanti High Lightning rules came out I re-equipped my Marines
with claymores. The ballistic-weave kilts and bagpipes were just to strike
terror into the hearts of the opposition.  I mean, how would you react when
an armoured Scotsman wades into your midst, merrily slicing off important
body parts?  :-)

(Seriously, the battle-axe, when wielded by an enhanced-strength trooper,
was a better _close_quarters_ weapon than most ranged weapons... PROVIDED
that its wielder didn\'t have to survive several turns of weapons fire to
close.)

IIRC, Gary Gregor ordered his Marine escort to play "Will Ye Nae Come Back
Again?" to the retreating enemy, just to rub salt in their wounds. :-)

I was showing this thread to a friend who is a Vietnam vet, and he wondered
what you\'d think of their habit of calling in artillery fire on suspected
snipers, "just in case."  He told me that the even napalmed single snipers
if they got annoying enough.

Nobody is going to skim all 2.5 billion!  Whay happens is that a suit that
should cost Cr. 300,000 per unit is sold at 310,000 per uit, and the
Imperial offcial involved and the contractor split the mark-up.  If you
sell just enough suits to equip a regiment, you\'ve made 25 million credits!

Selling sub-standard material to the Imperium is a good way to end up dead
or on a Prison Planet for the rest of your miserable life.

Why should the Imperium hide project funding?  They\'re not responsible to
the people!  Nobody is going to elect a new Emperor.  You need BCr 17.1 for
a project?  The Navy allocates it in their research and deleopment funds.
They probably spend more on decor for the Officer\'s Clubs.

It\'ll be more like "Where the &!@@#%* is the damn Army!?"

If the Marines are a shock force, that\'s what they\'ll do.  They don\'t have
the long-term staying power that an Army Brigade or Division has.  That\'s
the trade off:

Marines: 
  Pro: easily redeployed, quick response time, overwhelming firepower.
  Con: limited endurance, lack of flexibility

Army:
  Pro: Very flexible, equipped for long haul
  Con: slow response time

I know some treadheads who think that they are invulnerable when buttoned
up.  I know some pilots who think that WWII was won with the bombing
campaign.  

The fact is that infantry skills are hard, and even the best tanker is
going to be a mediocre infantryman at best.

Exactly.

A combat monster Marine would get best results by buying his DX up to 13
(30 points) and buying Battlesuit at DX+4 (24 points).  This gets his
Battlesuit-17 at only 30 points more than the basic DX 11/DX+1 Marine (54
points vs. 24 points).

That\'s still only 37% of the possible 145 points avalible to a "Hero
Material" character, and the DX 13 helps you with all physical skills,
reducing the cost of getting better scores.

This should probably be stated, then.  I realize it probably is, in the
main rules or one of the compendia, but many of us use GT for source
material only, and others will have missed that little detail.

OTOH, I think Doug\'s intention was that all Imperial Marines can use BD,
just as all US Marines can use a rifle. But I could be wrong here.

And this was forgotten by the chap who wrote a Journal article about the

I wondered whether GDW was pulling my leg or desperate for articles.

No. \'Good wars\' are fine. \'Bad wars\' arent. 

The Imperium could stop a \'bad war\' outright, but sometimes the Imperium
could use a much smaller amount of resources to turn a potentially bad war
into a good war.

OK. Ignore a regional conflict like Vietnam. Take World War 2 in 1940 -
involving most of the important states on the planet, and both sides are
enthusiastically trying to destroy the other side\'s industrial base. Does
the Imperium intervene completely ("You blokes break this up *now*"), or
does it do a measured response ("You blokes - no blockade and no strategic
bombing. You other blokes, no U-boat attacks on commercial shipping. and no
strategic bombing") ?

The Free Traders got through the same way much of those arms got to the
LAVN - go to a third "uninvolved" country (Cambodia) and then the rebels
trans-ship.

On the other hand, it\'s a much more effective use of limited Imperial

My point is that the best method of stopping the problem has a number of
solutions, some invovling excessive force, others not.

Incidentally, knocking over LBJ/Nixon would be best done by indicating that
a series of resignations leading to a government acceptable to the
Imperium. That way, you arent trying to sit on bayonets. Get a diplomat to
indicate that Humphrey resigning for RFK, and then Johnson resigning for
RFK is acceptable and will end the intervention is a better solution that
getting the Marines to occupy the capitol. If you run an Empire, never do
anything you can get the locals to do for you.

One good thing on this debate is that we are arguing the actual why, where
and how of Imperial intervention.

I\'ve seen both TL12 and TL13 for the introduction of BD.. If not, then the

_Star Mercs_ contains eleven templates for former military folks.  I\'m
writing templates for serving troops.  There will be suggestions for making
retired characters (mainly removing the -20pt Extremely Hazardous Duty
disad).

Exactly.  Every marine a Trooper.  Even the guy who\'s going to spend the
next forty years as a grav vehicle maitenence specialist in an armored cav
regiment.  He might *never* wear an active suit again, but he\'ll have to
take an annual VR test to show that he can still operate the systems at a
basic level.

If you build a retired Marine, you could get away with paying only 1/2pt
for Battlesuit, and say that he\'s forgotten almost everything about
Battlesuit from his active days.  Might be fun paired with Delusion: I\'m
still a great suit jockey.

One could also ask if other military forces even _have_ Marines in the first
place. I\'m Canadian, and our military has no marines. It took me a long time
before I even understood why Imperial Marines are around. 

IMTU, I say that Marines are shipboard troops. They occasionally do rapid-strike
ground action because they can be on the scene faster than Imperial Army units.

Why would a gap be a no no?  The coordinates get you to the center of the sphere
and then you switch to a relative coordinate system which could extend into "gap
space".  You could also have spherical overlap where a specific point is within
two or more spheres.  Assuming that the point is an object, the applicable
sphere would be the one the object is orbiting,  presumably the sphere with the
largest gravity source.

Since stellar bodies are NOT actually in the center of the spheres/hexes, the
sphere/hex coordinate system would only be useful as classification/labeling
aid.  Actual coordinates that you plug into your jump computer would be relative
to your current location and not some arbitrary label.  And there\'s nothing
wrong with having something labeled twice if it happens to be between or within
multiple spheres.

  Oops, I appear to have distracted myself around the first line.
How about: "Not individual wars, but an attritional series (which, given
Motie generation times, wouldn\'t be a lot of years - depends on how much
hardware they have to use, and their relative productive efficiencies).
IIRC, they seem to be quite comfy with the idea of breeding right up to
the ragged edge of their carryign capacity with Warriors and then count
not only on winning but of losing a bunch of the surplus in the war...

  FWIW, we don\'t know enough about how Moties conduct small wars to
guess; over-population is no real help in large/long wars.

Well, Leonard, it has been shown to happen that a virgin female rattler
gave birth to a male offspring. The female had been isolated in the lab
since hatching.... without exposure to other rattlers, or males of any
species.

The young male was found when an aborted clutch was being cleaned out of
her cage... he struck at (but missed) the handler.

Reptile genders are known not to be XY/XX state dependant. Several species
are thermally triggered between male and female.

I might be wrong but are you sure you have the right book?

Pg15 of HG2 is discussing character generation, the naval academy etc..

I looked all through my copy of HG2 3rd print,scaned the 15th print

I found no rule anywhere in the book that says there is an upper

I don\'t mean it like that. I\'m not talking about a deep space ticket. I
mean:
So the XYZ Megacorp has hired the Lilly Livered Battalion to take care of
the anti-corp rebels on Middiam\'s World.  Lilly Livered is losing so they
figure their best bet is to knock out the rebel HQ. They know its location
within a twenty mile radius. So the sadistic bastard of a leader of Lilly
Livered Marshal Scatch decides to hell with the Rules of War and he nukes
\'em.  The Marquis of Middiam has been neutral through all this. The rebels
haven\'t been attacking the main Starport, only XYZ\'s private port. They\'ve
also limited their attacks to XYZ offices, ships, buildings and Lilly
Livered Battalion\'s staging areas.

But now he has a problem. The planetary government belongs to XYZ. Their
contract mercenaries have violated the Imperial Rule of War.  Lilly Livered
is a big bad GTL11 Battalion, with grav tanks and BD infantry.

He contacts the sector duke via XBoat and it\'s decided the Imperium will
interfere. An Imperial Marine Regiment is sent. LL hears they\'re coming and
Scratch is ready for them. XYZ on the other hand is scared to death because
The Imperial Ministry of Commerce is at their home office going over their
books. The Imperial Navy is now blockading their ships and doing searches
and seizures. And their stockholder, most of who are Imperial Nobles asking
what the f*** the Board or Directors thinks it\'s doing.

The Marines drop from orbit on Marshal Scratch and his boys and give them a
whipping.  INI and IISS contact scouts find surviving rebel groups and begin
to ask questions about why they\'re so pissed at XYZ that they\'ve taken up
arms. About this time Imperial diplomats (Probably Nobles and career
government types) descend onto Middiam to find out why XYZ can\'t keep its
worker-citizens peaceful.  IN or IA cleanup units arrive to relieve the
Marines and conduct decon operations.

You get the point. The Marines are only one part of a complex Imperial
Machine.

Same Types of images. One of the studies (I\'ve read several, but it has
been years) specifically used a collection of some 200 bits, using around
10 per session, selected randomly.

Conditioning has some key factors not covered by generalization, as well.
Such as: Viewing imagery does not prepare one for the SMELL of the inside
of the human body. But, at least for the vast majority of those who pass
surgical rotations, they become to some degree "acclimatized" to that
smell. Plus, the uncontrolled outside environment might not make the same
trigger responses. That being said, however, the general trend is that the
more exposure one has to a given stimulus (even pain) the more used to it
one becomes; enough exposure, and one begins to expect, and possibly even
crave, said stimulation.

The "Clockwork Orange" scenario is probably not going to have the
spectacular effects envisioned by Kubric. But after the 10th watching, I no
longer had any wincing when the protagonist takes one to the family jewels.
Now, I even anticipate the seen and look forward to it....

All conditioning works by one of two methods: reward appropriate responses,
and punish inappropriate ones. Most combine some of both (I know US Army BT
in 1987 did).  Excessive viewing without some form of reward for the
desired response (disgust), or punsihment for lacking the response, will
only cause acclimatization to some degree... how much has been shown
repeatedly to be heavily individual.

Back to your original idea, how about a way to make it work:
	At birth, they wire all the kids pleasure centers. They make then
watch the videos, and put trases of a nausea inducer into the beverages
served during the exposure time. Then, after they throw up, they trigger
the pleasure center.  This links the pleasure to the combination of
violence and nausea, and ending the exposure by vomiting, then feeling good.

all attempts to "treat" homosexuality have been shown to have low success
rates. Just like the attempts to treat sexual predators have been pretty
dismally ineffective. (Some experimental success in reducing sexual drives
in pedophiles has been reported, but that\'s from chemical or physical
castration.)

I\'ll try to find the study titles for conditioning experiments... One, from
the late 60\'s was by the US army... which found the best way to train
soldiers was "as realistic a drill sequence as possible" so that only the
blood was really new to the equation.

I just want to point out that SJGames TNS brief for 152-1116:

"The monthly changing of the guard at the Imperial Palace took place today,
but palace watchers say the ceremony is a little late. Imperial guard
uniforms all look pretty much alike, especially to those unfamiliar with
them, but a local military enthusiast whose hobby is Imperial uniforms says
the differences are like night and day, and to her trained eyes, the Antares
guard has been on duty for almost three weeks.

"It is fairly easy to pick out the Aslan, " says Minaro hault-Yunami, author
of Uniforms and Equipment of the Imperial Guard, 1080-1110, " and the
Marines are in maroon, so they stick out too....."

"Every day when the Emperor enters the Long Hall on his way to the Iridium
throne, he is preceded by an honor party of the guard. On the first day of
the week, the honor party always wears battle dress instead of the normal
full dress uniform."

This pretty much limits full dress for Marines to Maroon. I might suggest
that Imperial Marines have an equivalent to the USMC Full Dress, which is a
dark blue jacket with lighter blue trousers. NCO\'s and Officers have a red
stripe down the trouser leg symbolizing the blood shed by the Marines who
served before them.

Now if you see a Marine in dress uniform on base he\'ll almost certainly be
wearing his green dress uniform. (I\'m Navy so I can\'t give you the official
\'Class A\' -- \'Class B\' Uniform designations.) The only time you\'ll see a
Marine in blue is when (s)he\'s in a parade, at the White House or on Embassy
guard, or at a funeral. You get the idea.

So how about Maroon (Which could easily symbolize the blood of one-thousand
years of Marines) for Full Dress, and Grey with maroon highlights for the
ordinary dress uniform?

According to GT:Alien Races 1 The Consular Guard is the Zhodani equivalent
of the Imperial Marines. GT:AR1 says that The Guard is less focused than the
IM, with a higher percentage of Armor. It also says that they are armed like
Army Lift Infantry in CES with gauss rifles.

Not true. Points in a space-time graph represent actual events, not when
they are observed. In any case, you still get paradoxes from FTL travel
whether you talk about causality or observation.

Well, I suppose this depends on your definition of "FTL travel" and
"causality". I can imagine myself on an alien planet an instant from now.
Does this mean my imagination is "faster than light"? Not by my definition.
Does being able to send information back in time break causality? It does
by my definition, and you can do this with Traveller\'s definition of FTL
travel.

I would be very interested in any reference you can quote of these "known
instances" of information traveling faster than light.

Waitaminnit, you just said there were "known instances" of information
traveling faster than light. AFAIK, tachyons are hypothetical and have
never been experimentally detected. IIRC their velocity is related to phase
velocity and cannot be used to transmit information.

>Light, in fact is not the limiting factor, nor the \'cone\' it describes in
>any way related specifically to the process and flow of the \'arrow of time\'.

I don\'t understand that sentence, but the light cone in a space-time graph
is most definitely related to the "arrow of time" since its axis of
symmetry is *by definition* the time axis.

>There are some possibilities that time

While I\'m no expert, every serious proposal for time travel I have heard of
has run into some fundamental flaw. There are proofs that FTL travel does
imply time travel; one of the more accessable ones is at
http://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hinson/ftl/html/FTL_part4.html. If you can
refute this please inform me, but I\'ll need better than just your say so.

>Instead, all rely on the use of negative energy.

Well, the ones I\'ve seen rely on undiscovered particles or spinning objects
of stupendous densities. Since the potential energy of anything moving
faster than c will be imaginary, I don\'t know if they "rely" on it so much
as "imply" it.

The example where a ship with relativistic speed jumps between two planets
can send information back in time. Does this qualify as a "time travel
situation"?

  p. 16. The obvious question arises, though - given that dispersed hulls
carry such "attached to their exterior" then why the heck are they even
required to allocate _interior tonnage_ (at KCr 50,000 per DT!) for them,
as opposed to counting them only for drive performance/L-Hyd consumption.
FWIW, they should treat the tonnage totals the same way as drop tanks*.

I hadn\'t heard about differing training loss rates between RAF (or RM?)
and USMC.  If I recall correctly, (1) no twin-seat training version of
the Harrier was made because it would have very different handling
characteristics, especially in VTOL mode, than a combat version and (2)
in VTOL mode the Harrier can only go off center one or two degrees
before control is lost.  A lot of pilots died in learning how to do
vertical take-offs because they tried to save a Harrier that had
wobbled.  Did the veteran RAF pilots have steadier hands (and didn\'t get
off center) or did they hit the eject button more quickly? or did they
spend way more time in simulators?

  And without armour they can\'t be used (cost-effectively) in the line
of battle; it\'s a shame that HG2 doesn\'t have any sort of scaling limit
on criticals or drive damage from the standard damage charts. IIRC, Mr.
Macintosh\' MCS does take that into effect, thus opening up a new design
niche for certain operations (e.g., a intrusion cruiser that relies on
redundancy and sub-craft, while getting fantastic defense vs meson guns).

They look so fragile and such easy targets, but many of them had to be tough

I imagine that a helium airship could probably take quite a few holes before

I remember this rather scary series of articles in the WSJ a few years
ago.  I don\'t think the IM and IN will have this problem.  At the
commoner level, civilian values in the Imperium are all over the place;
the Imperium is a great hodgepodge of societies and species.  At the
noble level, however, the values of honor, loyalty, and obedience are
themselves military values, and nobles pervade the IM and IN, in both
the officer and enlisted ranks.  I think that the Imperial armed
services, especially the IM and IN, will identify strongly with the
Imperial nobility.

In my Traveller universe, that strong identification was a problem that
fed the Civil Wars.  Nobles might be granted starships or fleets as
fiefs, so the crews would owe loyalty to them.  Nobles had the right and
obligation to raise other military forces as well.  Naval and military
personnel owed personal loyalty to the nobles first, not to the
Emperor.  After the Civil Wars, Arbellatra as Regent and then Empress
reformed the Imperial armed forces in various ways to make the loyalty
to the Emperor and to the idea of the Imperium central.

The British Harrier T2, T4 and T6, the US TAV8-A and TAV-8-B, the
Indian Sea Harrier T60 are all two seat trainers.

The RAF tends to invest a lot of time in simulators, plus RAF pilots are
trained more extensively in low altitude ops. I remember one story of a
joint US/UK exercise where the US pilots were barrelling along at what
they regarded as "on the deck", only to be shocked by the sight of two
RAF Buccaneers flying 100m below them.

Anything to do with individual atmosphereic reentry is going to be tricky.
IMTU there is a sport, Orbital Paragliding. You jump out in orbit, reenter
using an emergancy reentry kit and try to land on a 2m diameter target.

I have 1st ed, plus the pull out section of rules fixes from JTAS. The
pagination must be different. <shrug> Comes from being a grognard, I
suppose. I\'ll be more precise with my references in the future.

Look at the very first introductory paragraph under Starship Construction.

If the "Starships" chapter remains more or less intact from 1st to 2d ed (I
have no idea -- it wasn\'t in the pull out), you might also look under
"Design and Construction" there. In any case, the intent seems clear enough.

        Hi, Ian!
        Ummm.....
        Lets make a couple of statements & presumptions.  First is that a
Supp9 Tigress BB costs 363BCr.
        Next, here is a Book 3 / Book 4 Marine Battalion.
        
Equipment                                            Cost Per Unit
Number          Total Line
FGMP-15	                                                400
1,500 	 600,000 
Battledress	                                200 	           1,500 	 300,000 
G-Carrier	                                              1,000
107 	 107,000 
G-Tank	                                              2,000
214 	 428,000 
Recon Drone	                              2,000          	 36 	 72,000 
Nuclear Dampner	                              95000             	1	 95,000 
C-FCS master & 
1 man-pack terminal per platoon	 396 	          1	                       396 
Battle-computers - 1 per platoon	100	           37	                     3,700 
Meson Acc - 1 per five platoons	30000	          7	               210,000 
		                                                               MCr	 1,816,096 

        So, lets add wages and support staff and round up to 2BCr for a TL15
BD/FGMP battalion.  Oh, hell, *double* it to 4BCr to account for bases,
troop ships, transport charges and training costs.
        That\'s 90 battalions, or 135,000 combat troops per Tigress of
budget.  They build Tigresses by the SQUADRON.

        I don\'t see this being an issue.  You\'ve got 11,000 worlds to work
with...  raising 11,000 battalions is only 16.5 million troops...  there are
some planets that would gleefully unload that many citizens to ease
population pressures.

The Zhodani have the Consular Guard, the all-psionic elite force.  Since
_Fifth Frontier War_ doesn\'t give them the abilities of jump troops (being
able to land on a planet even with active enemy SDBs in the system), I\'d
wager that they weren\'t trained in this tactic. Since Kirsten is still
asleep three feet from the _FFW_ box, I can\'t root through the Zho counter
mix to see if they have any jump troops.

The CG\'s are a terror themselves.  They all can teleport, and can do nasty
things like telekineticly turn your safeties on, pull pins on grenades, use
clairvoyance to scout out you position...

Canada has never had Marines because of its close relationship with Great
Britain.  Marines are a force-projection arm, and Canada hasn\'t needed to
do that.  Canada is a very good example of a Client State.

        Heck, get mean and put a small rocket charge on it with a trigger

But it would take a long time to do it.

To a certain extent, true. But we need to consider the frame of reference
here. by definition, any FTL travel is in a frame of reference separate from
the \'normal\' spacetime frame of reference (since one of the limiting factors
in Eisteinian spacetime is the speed of light).

No. Imagination is not information. Information relates to the actual state
of the object concerned. Unless you can demonstrate that the alien planet in
question both exists and is in the precise state you imagine then no
information transfer has taken place.

Several articles during this year and the end of last year. New Scientist
has perhaps the most accessible ones with the clearest descriptions. In
particular, they demonstrate the transfer of information faster than light
by particles - in this case quantuum particles - travelling slower than
light. Very interesting stuff.

If you look, I did refer to tachyons being theoretical.

I think you will find Stephen Hawking disagrees with you here - and he does
so very well in \'A Brief History of Time\'. Can\'t remember which chapter, but
take a look. You are looking at classical thermodynamics, which cannot
describe relativistic or quantuum events (that is still THE big question in
physics - the person who makes that link has a Nobel Prize for sure).

Hmm I really have problems with open, web-based lists.  Perhaps one done

While I haven\'t tried it myself for LTA craft you might try GURPS Vehicles.
Since you can design both LTA and spacecraft using the system it might be
what you\'re looking for.

My question is whether there\'s really a need for a distinct GURPS Traveller
list.  I don\'t like the implication that GT players should go somewhere
else and stop bothering "real" Traveller players.  Maybe I\'m being
oversensitive, but having a separate list seems to be a step in that
direction.

Ok, if the required level from the template is equivilent to BD-0 in
other versions, or can be reduced to the equivilent of BD-0 due to lack
of use or recertification, Then I remove my objections. (I do not yet
understand GURPS).

Do ship and vehicle designers ever put design flaws into their creations, or
do they assume that they all work perfectly as per their specifications?

For example the original type S scout had a problem with its air system. Or
from real life a US report indicates that our brand new super Collins class
submarines here in Australia produce about the same amount of noise as a
rock group. This is obviously designed to confuse sonar operators after all
submarines are supposed to be quiet, therefore it must be a rock group.

In my universe a class of TL11 armoured scouts had a problem with  the
crystal iron hull material. It seems the batch used in this build had had
inadequate quality control and fractured under load. This slightly annoyed
the government that built them. No one asked the crews what they thought.

Quite frequently. My favorite use of such flaws is with "killer" equipment
which gives some valuable edge, but at a cost. The best example is a
weapon in my campaign known colloquially as a "Blazer", basically a plasma
pistol produced at TL-13 on a very few worlds. It has its good points:
relatively concealable (bulky for a pistol, more like SMG size),
devastating effect (not enough to burn through battledress reliably, but
almost), and relatively cheap (compared to a PGMP-13.) But there were some
down sides: horrendous recoil (comparable to a large-caliber hunting
rifle), short range (Medium range in classic TRAVELLER--past that it just
musses up your hair a bit as the hydrogen drops back from plasma to
gaseous state), and the occasional tendency for the power pack to explode
if fired too rapidly (a random and dramatic event.) Initially, Blazers
became a highly-sought item by the party: for relatively beefy charactes
who can handle the recoil they were quite useful.  Once a few characters
had to start making up new characters because of exploding powerpacks,
however, they became decidedly less popular as a standard weapon--though
one or two got held back as backup weapons for "special occasions."

I\'m highly fond of having the characters\' ship filled with "personality"
(read: broken stuff they have to fix) to the point where they typically
spend a week or two with a new ship doing complete overhauls and ship
diagnostics to find all the broken stuff.  I don\'t mind--it gives me a
good excuse to familiarize them with the ship, teach them a bit of the
mechanics behind things (which make for better gaming flavor, since
they\'re more directly familiar with the ship\'s guts.)  Characters with
high levels of Engineering are also handy in that they might know about
such "defects"--the existence of a ship class whose doors are extremely
fragile can be a very GOOD thing if you\'re trying to break into one...

        In my TNEC game, the Arquebus-class Patrol cuttter has a serious
problem with the cooling pumps and emergency safeties for its nuclear
fission powerplant.  Crews refer to them as "Blunderbus" or "Arc-and-Burst"
due to the number of times a vessel has been lost due to a powerplant hit
that resulted in the reactor going critical.  Thankfully, they are being
phased out of use and replaced with a more modern design that has a far
safer fusion reactor.

        Anyone else intentionally design a lemon?

Now begins again the Great TML Discussion of How Many Lists Are We? 
When GDW produced TNE, the TML, after much discussion, split into the
TML (for TNE discussions) and X-Boat List (for CT and MT).  I hope we
don\'t go down that path again.

I support this attitude myself. GURPS has done a magnificant job on the 
Traveller project, and even though I prefer CT and T4, the availablility of 
GURPS Traveller has made the game accessible to my play group in two ways. 

First they were fans of GURPS already and this allows them to use their 
favorite rules when they referee  Traveller, secondly the GURPS staff has 
done an excellent job in consolidating the Traveller data so they are now 
more comfortable playing my games because what is true in there new GT books 
is true in my CT game.

Remember, the point of a co-ordinate system is to *uniquely* identify
*all* points. Gaps and overlaps screw that up. If you "expand" the
spheres uniformly until they touch and allow them to distort until the
gaps are filled, you\'ve got the octahedral/tetrahedral pattern I
mentioned a few posts back. Or you\'ve got a cubic pattern. Or one of
the other 4 or 5 basic crystal structures. Since you want relatively
uniform axes in a co-ordinate system, that eliminates several crystal
structures that are essentially cubes stretched in various ways.

I can\'t see how it\'d be of *any* use whatsoever. At least not one that
can\'t be better served by rectangular, spherical or cylindrical
co-ordinates.

So why not use those in the first place?

Sure there is. Which do you look it up under? It can get *really*
embarassing if some vital bit of info (like the fact that the place is
a red zone) is filed under the *other* set of co-ordinates.

That\'s why co-ordinates *have* to be unique, and mustn\'t have "voids"
(gaps).

You\'ve got two problems. First, it\'ll try to flip the station until the
field is oriented counter to the planet\'s field. And once it\'s
accomplished *that*, it\'ll start *accelerating*.

You see, if you are using it for shielding in a radiation belt it has
to be on *all* the time. That makes it the same as having a thruster
that is *always* on, and always pointing in the *same* direction. That
makes a stable orbit impossible. And it\'s rather likely to throw you
into the planet\'s atmosphere long before it can throw you away from the
planet.

That\'s because it\'ll act to increase the ecentricity of the orbit. And
that means that the periapsis gets dangerous long before the apoapsis
gets usefully far.

Doesn\'t matter. EMP is subject to the inverse square law too. A parsec
is something over 200,000 AU. 

The planet was 1 AU away. That means that at 1 parsec the effects would
be 40 *billion* times weaker. At 2 parsecs they\'d be 160 billion times
weaker. At 3 parsecs they\'d be 360 billion times weaker.

Let\'s try 1 parsec. To damage stuff EMP has to generate multiple
thousands of volts per meter of induced current. And that\'s for
*unsheilded* stuff. We\'ll go with a mere thousand volts per meter.

That means at 1 AU, the EMP was generating fields that induced 40
*trillion* volts per meter. Said voltages and fields are incompatible
with things like life, metallic objects, and possibly even solids. 

To give you an idea, they used *far* weaker magnetic fields to
*levitate* a rat a few years back. We are talking about the sort of
forces that could grab *people* on the planet\'s surface and boost them to
escape velocity. Except that being non-uniform, it\'d more likely rip
them to shreds.

That was in the 70s. I know, I have it. Remember, the *story* wasn\'t

It\'s easy to check. Check the cities Louis Wu visits as he "follows"
the new year around the world. Then check a time zone map. In the first
edition, Niven had him going the *wrong way*. Oops!

For anyone who cares, New Zealand is the first place of any importance
to see the new year (there\'re a couple of "earlier" time zones, but
they only have a few unimportant Islands and outposts in them). Next is
Australia, and so on going *west* around the world until you hit
Hawaii. 

This proved important back in 1996 when a plant in New Zealand had a
computer problem, and then, an hour later several in eastern Australia
had the same problem. Some idiot hadn\'t allowed for the possibility of
a "day 366" in the year, so at midnight, Dec 30 all the places with
these computer systems crashed *hard*. Once Australia made it obvious
that it was a date related problem they were able to notify the rest of
the world and shut things down in time. 

I plan to be watching for odd new reports from New Zealand and
Australia come the end of the year. They\'ll get hit by the y2k bug first!

Actually, we\'ve found that the *biggest* habitat is inside the crust!
The single-celled organisms in deep rock may well outmass the rest of
the biosphere.:-)

Anyway, I\'d divide it a bit more widely: 

Aquatic is strictly water.
"Amphibian" is "water/land"
"land" is strictly land surface (or near surface). 
"aerial" is more of an "amphibian" that lives on the ground and spends
a lot of time in the air.
"triphibian" is obviusly "seabirds", as they spend time on thw water,
and in the air, but need land also.

One habitat that seems to be mostly untenanted on Earth is *totally*
aerial. Say an airborne jellyfish analog with a higher level or dust
and micro-organisms (aerial plankton) in the air. That\'d lead to more
strictly arial forms, some of whom might attack ground dwellers, but
most would be *way* up in the sky.

Actually *oxygen* is almost as reactive as fluorine. Thus things like
forest fires. The big drawback with flurine as an oxidant is figuring
out how the plants can get enough energy to produce free fluorine!

Alas, it\'s not stable under those conditions. If there\'s that much HF
around, there *won\'t* be more than traces of CO2 in the atmosphere. The
carbon will have been grabbed by the fluorine, giving you (probably)
H2O and at least partially fluorinated carbon compounds. You might even
wind up with some oxygen fluoride! *That* makes fluorine seem tame.

And on top of everything else, HF plus water means that rocks erode
*rapidly*. As in no mountains, and possibly no land surface worth
mentioning. 

Earth went thru a nasty period of erosion after it got an oxcygen
atmosphere. A lot of previously stable minerals oxidized like crazy.
This lead to a rather noticeable layer of iron oxides in the geological
record, and a lot of vulcanism as the rapid erosion cause tectonic
stresses to shift.

Since the rock would be a *lot* more porous (due to the HF) I can see
life going a lot farther in the deep crust. 

Well, as I noted above, things to consider are what the secondary and
tertiary effects of various decisions are. For example, those HF
oceans. 

It might also be useful to list the biomes found on Earth, and consider
what others are possible. 

On Earth the main factors for *terrestrial* biomes seem to be
temperature and precipitation. Thus this list from some posts a few

To these we can add two other *known* biomes:

Deep ocean vent chemosynthetic
Deep rock chemosynthetic

And then, as I noted, it may be possible to have a sort "Aerial

I do wonder if there are more possibilities for chemosynthesis based
ecologies on some worlds. Instead of rainfall, they\'d be more
interested in availability of the chemicals they process for life. On a
world like Titan, they might actually be a form of rainfall!

Otherwise it\'s likely to depend on veins on minerals, or some sort of
volcanic activity. 

Hey! That\'s it! How about an ecology on something like Io that\'s based
on using all that free sulfur?

But that means that it differs *wildly* from system time in other parts
of the universe. Remember, there are galaxies moving at near lightspeed
relative to us. Or, more to the point, *we* are moving at near
lightspeed relative to them. And the whole point of relativity is that
it\'s not *possible* to say one of us is right and the other isn\'t.

So talking about "low speed" the way you are makes our frame of
reference somehow "special". And special in a way that has some odd
implications for physics.

Alas, this *can\'t* work. Some of those "backround stars" are quasars
moving at 90% or more of lightspeed relative to you. Velocity is *not*
an absolute. 

You have to make measurements in your own frame of reference. And they
*have* to agree with those made by others in *their* frame of reference
(subject to the Lorentz-Fitzgerald conversion factors). 

Measurements of space and time have to be converted into "interval".
*All* observers will agree on the interval betwen two events. Where
they differ will be in how much of the interval is "space" and how much
is time. Which brings us back to the fundamental problem. 

If you disappear at point A and reappear at point B, with an interval
such that you arrive at B before light can cross the distance from A
to B, then in some reference frames, the time portion of the interval
*has* to be negative.

Yep.

I\'ve *got* to dig up the formula for interval. If I calculate the
interval for a jump, I should be able to work backwards to figure the
required frame for any desired amount of time travel.

You are cheating. You are using weight, wingspan, and length. Those are
*not* interchangeable. And, as I said earlier, the limiting factor is
the maximum distance of an internal point from the surface of the body.

Length is *definitely* not related to that. Neither is length of
weight. *Thickness* is. But only in a minimax sense, That is, the
critical factor is the maximum "minimum distance to the surface".

Also, there\'s some debate as to what the partial presure of O2 was back
when that dragonfly was around, If, as some suggest, it was higher,
then the dragonfly likely couldn\'t survive under current conditions.

Exoskeltons, maybe. For tracheal resipiration, I want some hard

<sigh>

*Of course* the males aren\'t needed for parthogensis. That\'s the
*definition*. What I said had *nothing* to do with that. 

Might I trouble you to try a bit harder to write responses that
actually deal with the issues being discussed, rather than with some
*different* issue? 

I\'m getting tired of having you continually "refute" points I never

Yeah, but in my example the situation is a lot "closer to home", as I\'m
assuming a species with sexual reproduction. And, one can assume
nowhere *near* as casual as the hivers about it.

Nitrogen compounds have this slight problem. They tend to be unstanle
(except in a few configurations). Nitrogen-nitrogen bonds are one of
the more unstable configurations. 

There\'s a *reason* most explosives contain nitrogen!

True, but that requires hitting the bomb *during* the few milliseconds
(microseconds?) when fission is actually *occuring*. 

It\'s much simpler to hit it with an increase. That causes the
sub-critical masses to at least heat up and deform (making the bomb
impossible to detonate). Or maybe they\'ll get zapped enough to melt
(definitely won\'t go off then!) or even for the sub-critical masses to
go critical. In that case, it\'ll go boom, but before it gets near you.
A definite win.

This is IMO a furphy. The Collins class does have problems (eg too big, too
expensive and the fire control system doesnt work), but it is plenty quiet
when going at 3-5 knots.

It\'s only loud when hooning around at 15 knots, and if you try that in a
diesel-electric you die anyway when the batteries run out and you have to
schnorkel. The USN has a very, very big blind spot when it comes to
non-nuclear submarines (possibly why other navies, such as that reknowned
first-rate naval power Argentina, manage to regularily deep-six US CVNs
with diesel subs in exercises).

To haul this back OnTrav, give the PCs the job of blindtesting some new
piece of equipment. I\'m not talking Paranoia R+D here, rather something
that is a critical part of some very big procurement contract.

 Of course, not all disadvantages are mechanical. IMTU the freighter design
that (in the distant past) became the basis for the classic Corsair is still a
fairly common design, but has a tendency to attract more than its fair share
of Customs inspections.

 Back in the MT era, a "variant" Scout was posted on the TML that had an
Armor rating of 39 (Starship minimum was 40) due to inferior materials
that only became obvious after a whole bunch had been built and spread
all over the region.
 The classic Type S problem of inadequate filters is, IMTU, a simple 
combination
of the hull size, typical usage, and the fact that those Scouts were 
supposedly
built at TL9. Long term life support is still tricky at that TL...

 Aside from the above example, how would such mechanical problems
be represented? Some are going to be simple "not up to spec" problems,
which get designed the normal way. Others could be purpose-built
by the architect. Another poster on this subject mentioned "hot" hardware
that makes sacrifices in the long term for short-term gain. This could be
represented (in MT, TNE, and T4) during design by using a component
from one TL ahead, or that has some characteristic of the next TL, in
exchange for problems. TNEs Wear Value mechanic works for some
cases, as some hardware will be generally touchy from word one, while
other cases are going to be specific.

Actually, that\'s the first time anyone\'s pointed out that the pages are
different. I had thought that 2d ed was arranged differently, but that the
page numbers were the same from the pull out to the 2d ed. Oh, well --
learn something new.

Unless I get overruled, GT: Starships is going to say that 1 million dtons
is the largest starship that has been built to date, but that there is
theoretically no reason one couldn\'t build larger ships if desired. Larger
vessels do exist in the OTU (the sublight colony ships that reached the
Islands Clusters, or those used by the Suerrat), but they seem to all be
non-starships.

Other species depend on chemical concentrations: one sex releases a
chemical that causes all hatchlings to develop as members of the other sex
(unless the level is low, in which case you get a mixture of sexes). IIRC,
some of these species have an extreme degree of sexual dimorphism, too
(female 200kg, male 20g, that kind of thing).

MT Ref\'s Manual - the tables only go up to 1 million (1e6) tons displacement.

Under FF&S, ships in the 5e5 - 1e6 range don\'t have enough surface area for
full useage of their volume except as cargo. (Or so it has been shown about
3-4 years ago on the list.)

Also, no canon design has ever exceeded 1e6 tons.

Isn\'t it true that in insect colonies, the queen bee or queen ant must apply
a special enzyme to all the larvae in order to make them into neuter (though
all-female) \'workers/soldiers\'?  And that if this enzyme is not present, the
larva will automatically become a new queen?  (Insuring the survival of the
colony if the queen dies and cannot administer the enzyme.)

Of course, a different chemical would be used on a small percentage of the
larvae to make them male drones, IIRC.

Correct me if I am wrong, but ins\'t a parsec approximately 3.21 light

Ahh.  I also have the glow-in-the-dark model of the McArthur, complete
with opening cargo bay and tiny pinnace inside.  BTW, I love its
design.  Far as I know, at time of creation, only 200 of these models
were ever fabricated.  Know where I might pick up a mint copy?

The handwave my old GM used to limit ship sizes was the gravity field
generated by thier mass.  I wanted to design a teraton-sized ship and he
told me if I tried to launch my fighters they\'d go "BLAT!" on the side
of the ship as soon as they left the launch tubes due to the gravity
field generated by the ship\'s mass.

Just how on the mark is this reasoning?  Is it bunk, or as size
increases, do we get problems with passive grav fields due to
mass/density?

But Leonard, you forget that in Traveller space is 2D, so the EMP only

Nope. That\'s why the US Navy gave up on them. One good storm cell would
rip a dirigible to shreds. As happened to both the Shenendoah and the
Akron if I recall correctly. 

They were too big and fragile to survive a storm, and too slow to avoid
one. 

And those smoking sections were rather ingenious. They too a *lot* of
pains to keep the smokers and the hydrogen apart. :-)

Holes are a problem. But as you note, not fatal. But any sort of
explosives means that you\'ve got shockwaves hitting both the gas cells
and the outer surfaces. 

Again, *because* they have to be *very* light, the structures of a
dirigible just *can\'t* take all that much extra stress.

The hydrogen *can\'t* burn *or* explode unless it is mixed with air
(from 4% to 75% mix). And since *all* explosives are selfcontained, you
can\'t smother them.

Using that logic, the existing hex pattern couldn\'t be used.  There\'s close to
a square parsec of points that all have the same coordinate.  The hex pattern
isn\'t a locator, its a classifier.  All points in that hex are labelled as
such.

Well the cannon shot stack is a skewed cubic pattern.

Well, yea.  Cartesian would be good.  But we\'re trying to reconcile the
pre-existing hexagonal mapping pattern and extruding that into a hexagonal 3rd
dimension.

I dunno.  Why use Hexagons?  I guess because some bean counter at Capitol
thought computer memory was too expensive and decided to reduce the coordinate
system from 24 bytes down to 4.

Either.  It\'s just an index.  Multiple indices can point to the same object.

It\'s not (unless you\'ve got a bonehead bean counter back at Capitol trying to
save half a nibble here and there).  An object with multiple indices will be
the same object no matter which index you use to find it.

        Diplomat-Class Battlion Transport and Support Ship

Note:  Z=162, Y=121

        The "Diplomat"-class _Andrew Young_ carries three full battalions of
battle-dress TL15 Imperial Marines plus thier G-carriers, Tanks and
associated equipment.  She carries three model 9/Fib computers;  one for the
ship, one for battle-field coordination and a redundant backup.  Her
fire-power is orriented around support of her ground troops and landing,
hence the dozen meson bays and CPAWs spinal.  
        She carries 20 "Bulldog" class landing craft, allowing an entire
battalion to be landed with equipement at once.  The first landing wave,
however, is delivered by drop capsule....  the entire first batallion is
deployed in a single launch in this fashion.  The third wave down must wait
for the Bulldogs to return to the mothership before they can deploy.
        She also carries 5 "Terrier" class scoop ships to refuel her while
on station;  her cargo stores allow three months of operations without
replenishment.  However, she carries only enough fuel for one month of
power-plant operations.  The Terriers, during full scale operations, supply
fuel slightly faster than the Diplomat consumes it.  A typical month of
uncontested operations will allow them to supply 5 weeks of refined fuel in
4 weeks.
        While certainly capable of dissuading light skirmishers from
engaging her more than once, the Diplomat-class ships are not designed to
operate by themselves.  Usually a light cruiser and a DesRon are assigned to
provide a barrier defense to allow the Diplomat to do what it is she does
best...  dominate the battlefield over which she is parked.  It is also not
unusual to see such a strike group with a hospital ship and a heavy
frieghter for logistics support.

        ======

        Personal Comments:   A very good variant of this ship would be to
rip out the spinal PAWs, reduce the powerplant appropriately and add 60
fighters and some more cargo.  The fighters would be for defense suppression
and scoop-ship escort.
        Also, it is argueable about the merit of having a single-salvo
ability for an entire *batallion* of BD/FGMP troops...  I probably could
have saved myself some tonnage by going with a company per salvo deployment
rate and had multiple waves of DC\'s.  However, the design was heavily
influenced by the reoccuring theme of "overwhelming force" in the BD debate.  
        Hence the very heavy array of meson bays...  since you can fire
through the planet with them, they are perfect for this type of application.
The hordes of low-USP pulse-laser batteries are for pounding the crap out of
the LZ and anything else on the facing hemisphere...  that\'s a great deal of
fire raining down on 121 targets simultaneously...  \'sides, pulse laser fire
looks cool.  =)
        The three computers are mostly because once the troops are on the
ground, communications, sensors and information gathering/ compilation
becomes paramount...  dedicating a 9fib to that in lieu of rules for
specific systems seemed to be the right answer.  

        The Bulldog was another set of compromises...   Once the troops are
down, they have to be useful as something else...  hence the high agility,
armor and missles...  they do nicely as air-strike vehicles.  Also, with the
40-ton cargo area, they can do logistics runs to FEB-area troops with
reasonable risk.  
        The pop-down anti-personnel turrets are just my mean-streak showing
through...  more than enough firepower to "pacify" an LZ.  4 platoons of
BD/FGMP troops with G-carriers & G-Tanks also achieve that effect, too.  ;-)

I\'d argue that the current position of the US Marines is an anomaly that is
unlikely to be duplicated elsewhere.

Whilst marines can be used in a force projection role, the only reason the
US Marines are especially useful in this role  is because of their integral
air and artillery support. And that they have this is merely an accident of
history, and an outgrowth of the strange way the U.S. military is funded and
organized in the first place. It\'s possible one could attribute it all to a
single strongman, but I\'m sure Doug knows more about that than I do.

The vast majority of other countries marines follow the normal marine
concept of marines being shipboard security troops. This includes the
Russian, Chinese, French, Dutch, Beligian, Indonesian,  German, Canadian,
Japanese, and British marines. (Though I\'m not sure alll those countries
still have marines,  they have done so in the past )

The closest to the US concept of marines are probably the Royal Marine
Commandos, but they are special forces, not just marines, and again it\'s
pretty much an accident of history that they are descended from Marines.

Part of my argument stems from the fact that "force projection" is a concept
that requires more than even the US Marines are capable of.  The Duke of
Wellington\'s Peninsular force and the WW][ British Expeditionary Force were
"force projection", the raids on Grenada or Vera Cruz by US Marines were
not. The deployment of the Sixth Fleet in the Gulf to blockade Iraq, was
"force projection", the deployment of US marines to protect the US
embassy in Lebanon was not.

Now this does not affect Traveler, because the Imperial Marines are
organized as a  US-style marine force, but have for some reason in Traveller
board games been given better capabilities to assault planets from orbit
than the Army. Not particulalry sensible IMO, given historical precedents in
airbourne and seabourne invasions. However, cannon now suggests otherwise,
so we have to live with an Imperial Marine force that is "Marine"  in name
only, and more powerful than historic "marine" forces.

If I was writing Travelleer from scratch, I\'d likely have dropped the
archaic "marine"  title and used either "Airbourne" or "Spacebourne" or more
likley forgot the references and have specially named units, such as the
1066th Planetary Assault Division and the 677th Orbital Defense Brigade,
etc.

If I had decided to continue the "marine" concept to follow the "navy"
concept, they would be used as they were used in the Royal Navies (Dutch,
Belgian, French & British), primarily as shipbpard security to repel
boarders.

And as marines were often landed to deal with emplaced guns that threatened
ships or to raid enemy ports,  torch enemy ships in port, gather
intelligence for a planned naval raid, to "lower the chain" etc, or to hold
important "Naval" locations, ( such as South Georgia , the island not the US
state )
(All these have Traveller appropriate equivalents BTW)

So, Imperial Marines would be shipboard troops, would tend to have higher
numbers of zero-G / Low-G tranied troops than all but the specialist Orbital
Defence brigades and would tend to be involved in "ground" operations only
when they were the only troops available to the local Navy commender, such
as when a single Imperial gunboat is out on patrol in the outback.

If a serious military engagement or seige was required, the Army would be
brought in.

But that\'s just how I would do it if I had a clean slate.


And just to keep Doug\'s stirring going :

Yes, but currently it is a US client state.

Actually, the other reason is that usually it is impossible
.
In the case of Saddam, for instance, the US _never_ knew where he was except
when he appeared publically, and they didn\'t know when that was going to
happen.

And the US president is _already_ in the firing line, ordering the deaths of
other leaders isn\'t going to make him any  less safer while president. The
major problem is that the US president may not be president in four years
time, and then it\'s relatively easy to off him.

I\'d say Quadhafi left Reagan alive becuase he sensed a kindred spirit, and
because of the Moslem belief that madmen are holy. <grin>

Er, Michael, you don\'t consider the Locherby aircraft bombing,  the World
Trade Centre bombing, and the destruction of the Marine  barracks in Lebanon
"serious"  reprisals ?

These dictators are no fools, they know that no-one _cares_ if the US
president is killed, but that the best way to get American presidents to
change ther minds is to prey on the US public\'s squeamishness. Kill enough
US troops and civilians in messy ways and the US president will capitulate
and deal.

All that Quafhafi has done is not be able to _publically_ (in the sense of
world media attention) attack the US as much, largely because of US
political pressure on media organizations to _not_ publicize his rants (and
in England actual laws preventing such publicity, designed for the IRA but
just as effective against other terrorsists)

He\'s still out there training and funding terrorists and trying to get OPEC
to increase oil prices.

Which just makes Sector Dukes targets as well, and it\'s _so_ easy in the 3I
to conduct huge terrorist raids.

A spacecraft crash makes a bigger mess than a plane crash, and you only need
a couple of nukes a  few explosives, a textbook on orbital mechanics, and
some patience, to nudge a few rocks into a planet. They don\'t even need to
be near-C

Of course he will.

Not at all.

 He\'ll force the Imperial Marines to bloodily kill a lot of his supporters
in ways that will make it seem the Sector Duke is being a bloodthirsty
psychotic, and then ensure that TAS and other news agencies gets lot of nice
gory news footage of Imperial Marine brutality, immediately lodge a protest
in the Imperial Senate, and start talking to the Sector Duke\'s rivals, and
request assitance from the  _Emperor_ according to the terms of their
membership in the Imperium against this renegade Duke.

Said dictator is not scared of being killed, the marines will be hard
pressed to find him, and the only real way to get him would be to slag the
whole planet, which would play right into his hands.

While your scenario is possible, mine is just as possible, you can\'t be
guaranteed that  any particular dictator is
going to act in any particular way.
